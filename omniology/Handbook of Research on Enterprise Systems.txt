Section I
Enterprise Systems: Technologies, Solutions, and Strategic Perspectives
Section I of this handbook starts with the growing importance of increasing agility in the organization 
and then focuses understanding the technologies available to develop and deploy Enterprise Systems 
(ES) in organizations. In the current global and competitive business environment, it is essential to be 
.exible and agile simultaneously. Appropriate design and alignment of enterprise systems with business 
strategies can enable a business to create a competitive advantage in the global markets, at least in the 
short-term.  Various chapters in this section discuss the technologies for enterprise systems’ integration, 
solutions such as SAP Business Blueprint, and the strategic perspective of implementing and using 
enterprise systems for providing sustained competitive advantage.
Chapter I
A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility............................................................................................. 1
Nancy Alexopoulou, University of Athens, Greece
Panagiotis Kanellis, University of Athens, Greece
Mara Nikolaidou, University of Athens, Greece
Drakoulis Martakos, University of Athens, Greece
The .rst chapter of this handbook presents a holistic approach for Enterprise Agility and explains why 
the term “enterprise agility” has been adopted for characterizing this capability.  Furthermore, it provides 
a holistic approach for analyzing enterprise agility that is based on a viewpoint-oriented Enterprise 
Architecture. The ultimate purpose of this chapter is to provide the means for researchers to explore 
enterprise agility in a systematic way and to identify a number of important issues regarding the attain-
ment of such capability.

Chapter II
What is SAP Business Blueprint?.......................................................................................................... 19
Hossana H. Aberra, Enterprise Integration, Inc., USA
This chapter discusses the concepts behind SAP Business Blueprint. It views the ERP solution as an 
integral component of the design process. It argues that the modernized approach for SAP Business 
Blueprint may be driven by the technical configuration of the solution landscape; hence the layout and 
foundation for the organizational design are set from the start. The chapter concludes that such an inte-
grated environment simplifies the enterprise design process during SAP implementation and facilitates 
the transition, support, and maintenance of the new enterprise environment.
Chapter III
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning.......................................................................... 32
Rogerio Atem de Carvalho, Federal Center for Technological Education 
  of Campos, Brazil
This chapter introduces the key aspects of Free/Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning systems 
(FOS-ERP). The chapter highlights (a) the differences between FOS-ERP and their proprietary equivalents 
(P-ERP) in terms of business models, selection, customization, evolution and maintenance; and (b) the 
challenges and opportunities that they offer to adopters, vendors, researchers, and individual collabora-
tors. The chapter also identifies the challenges and opportunities that the open source enterprise systems 
offer to stakeholders and developer communities.
Chapter IV
The Changing Nature of Business Process Modeling: Implications for Enterprise 
Systems Integration................................................................................................................................ 45
Brian H. Cameron, The Pennsylvania State University, USA
The chapter discusses the Business Process Modeling (BPM) concepts and evolving modeling standards 
and technologies that have the potential to dramatically change the nature of phases of the systems de-
velopment life cycle (SDLC). Although the notation is still in working draft format, this chapter suggests 
that the system architects and designers should consider incorporating the concepts of BPM into their 
current and future systems analysis and design procedures.
Chapter V
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems: Effects and Strategic Perspectives in 
Organizations......................................................................................................................................... 57
Alok Mishra, Atilim University, Turkey
This chapter discusses the Enterprise Resource Planning system’s effects and strategic perspectives in 
organizations. The focus of the chapter is on how information technology and ERP, together, facilitate in 
aligning the business to achieve excellent productivity. Because the ERP systems are large and complex, 
taking years to implement, the inclusion of today’s strategic choices into the enterprise systems may 
significantly constrain future action. By the time the implementation of an ERP system is completed, 

the strategic context of the firm may have changed. Therefore, this chapter explores various ways by 
which an ERP system can provide sustained competitive advantage.
Chapter VI
An Overview of Executive Information Systems.................................................................................. 67
Gary P. Moynihan, The University of Alabama, USA
This chapter describes an Executive Information Systems (EIS) as a software system designed to support 
the informational needs of senior management. The EIS is characterized by an easy to use and main-
tainable graphical user interface; integrated capabilities for data access, analysis, and control; analysis 
and report generation across multiple files; and on-request “drill down” capability. By understanding 
the concept and functionality of traditional executive information systems, readers will be able to bet-
ter understand how EIS has adapted to meet the requirements of senior management in an enterprise 
system environment.
Section II
Enterprise Systems: Risks, Performance, and Business Value
Section II discusses the risk and performance issues related to enterprise systems. Business operations 
are composed of a collection of business processes. The enterprise system is an approach to integrate 
business processes people, applications and systems; in essence integrating the business, for business 
transformation and business value creation. Studies have proven that integration is not only a key reason 
for the adoption of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) but also for improving business value. However, 
in doing so, it is important to assess the risk of implementing enterprise systems and the performance 
gains that can be achieved. Further, it is important to consider integration in a wider concept, including 
the entire supply chain and the customer relationships.  Various chapters in this section are devoted 
to the discussion of relevant topics to enable the reader to understand the relationship between risks, 
performance, and business value while developing, implementing and deploying integrated enterprise 
systems.
Chapter VII
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards.................................................................... 83
Joseph Bradley, University of Idaho, USA
As ERP systems have proven difficult and costly to implement, organizations must consider the risks 
and rewards of embarking on complex and time consuming implementation projects.  Therefore, this 
chapter describes the reasons for the firms to adopt Enterprise Resource Planning systems, identifies the 
benefits firms seek, discusses various risks firms face as they adopt these systems, and suggests ways 
firms can manage these risks. It also discusses some well publicized ERP failures, risk management tools, 
and future trends in ERP implementation. The chapter suggests that while organizations will continue 
to adopt ERP as a strategic necessity to remain competitive in their industry, few, if any, will gain any 
sustainable competitive advantage by adopting ERP.

Chapter VIII
ERP-Driven Performance Changes and Process Isomorphism............................................................. 96
Andrea Masini, London Business School, UK
This chapter contends that ERP investments may contribute to the achievement of improved business 
performance and examines the conditions under which this contribution occurs. The findings presented 
in this chapter also suggest that, while in the long-run the pervasive diffusion of standardized software 
may decrease its strategic value, in the short-run early ERP adopters can profit from a window of op-
portunity to obtain above average returns.
Chapter IX
Application Integration within the Enterprise Context........................................................................ 110
Ronda R. Henning, Harris Corporation, USA
This chapter deals with the enterprise information system’s administrative and execution context as 
a component of the application software development process. It is argued that while the application 
software lifecycle considers the functionality of a given collection of components within the context of 
a consumer’s requirements definition, it frequently overlooks the application integration requirement 
within the context of the enterprise environment. The chapter illustrates the potential impact of these 
considerations on the acceptance and application of enterprise systems.
Chapter X
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business Value......................................................................... 119
Sanjay Mathrani, Massey University, New Zealand
Mohammad A. Rashid, Massey University, New Zealand
Dennis Viehland, Massey University, New Zealand
This chapter explores a model of transforming ES data into knowledge and results by comparing two 
case studies that examine the impact of enterprise systems information on organizational functions and 
processes leading to realization of business value. A qualitative research methodology is used to explore 
how firms can leverage ES technologies to realize improved business value. These findings suggsest 
that the ongoing transformation of an organization to extract value from data, distribute results from 
analysis, apply knowledge, and establish decisions for strategic organizational benefits will lead the 
path towards business success.
Chapter XI
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration........................................................................................... 134
Charlotte H. Mason, University of Georgia, USA
Aleda V. Roth, Clemson University, USA
This chapter discusses two popular initiatives of supply chain management (SCM) and customer re-
lationship management (CRM). SCM focuses on optimizing the materials, information, services, and 
financial flows through a supply network. CRM focuses on marketing, sales, and customer service, and 
aims to maximize the value of customer relationships. The chapter highlights some lessons learned in 
the SCM-CRM implementation.  

Chapter XII
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value.............................................................. 152
Euripidis Loukis, University of the Aegean, Greece
Ioakim Sapounas, University of the Aegean, Greece
Konstantinos Aivalis, ICAP, Greece
This chapter discusses the alignment of enterprise systems with business strategy and its impact on 
the business value that enterprise systems generate. It reports the results of an empirical investigation 
conducted by the authors to ascertain the impact of enterprise systems’ strategic alignment on business 
performance. The chapter provides guidelines to help researchers and practitioners to incorporate the 
strategic alignment of enterprise systems in their research and practice respectively.
Section III
Enterprise Systems: Small, Medium, and Large Organizations
The initial developments in enterprise systems in the form of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems 
concentrated on their deployment in large business firms. However, in the modern competitive landscape, 
it is essential to apply these systems in small to medium enterprises. ERP requirements, investments, and 
challenges for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are different from large organizations. Skeptics 
argue that heavy investments in ERP implementation in SMEs may not bear the same fruits as large 
organizations. It is thought that SMEs may take a great deal of time, money, and effort to understand 
the business processes restructuring and technology, and may never effectively customize enterprise 
systems due to nature of its small and medium size.  The chapters in Section III of this handbook discuss 
the issues related to the development, implementation, and use of enterprise systems in SMEs. The final 
chapter in this section explores the impact of organization size on the benefits of enterprise systems.
Chapter XIII
Enterprise Systems in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises.............................................................. 170
Sanjay Mathrani, Massey University, New Zealand
Mohammad A. Rashid, Massey University, New Zealand
Dennis Viehland, Massey University, New Zealand
The purpose of this chapter is to gain insights into what is a typical case of enterprise systems (ES) 
implementation and to understand how current implementations in the SME sector differ from the ear-
lier implementations in the large enterprise sector through a perspective of ES vendors, ES consultants, 
and IT research firms in a NZ context. The chapter further discusses the implications for practice in the 
implementation processes, implementation models, and organizational contexts.
Chapter XIV
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs............................ 185
Kerstin Fink, University of Innsbruck, Austria
Christian Ploder, University of Innsbruck, Austria

This chapter investigates the use of knowledge processes and knowledge methods for SMEs. The 
learning objectives of this chapter are to assess the role of knowledge management and knowledge pro-
cesses in SMEs. Based on the results of several empirical studies, an integration concept for knowledge 
processes, knowledge methods, and knowledge software tools for SMEs is introduced. In concluding 
their chapter, the authors propose a three-dimensional theoretical framework for successful knowledge 
diffusion in SMEs.
Chapter XV
Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing Mittelstand............................................................ 201
Tobias Schoenherr, Michigan State University, USA
Ditmar Hilpert, Reutlingen University, Germany
Ashok K. Soni, Indiana University, USA
M.A. Venkataramanan, Indiana University, USA
Vincent A. Mabert, Indiana University, USA
This chapter discusses the challenges and issues faced in implementing integrated enterprise systems in 
small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Using the observations from eight SMEs in the German 
manufacturing sector, the study provides valuable insights towards understanding ES implementations 
and their peculiarities in the German manufacturing sector. Results reported in this chapter suggest that 
further exploration of these topics, preferably related to the experiences of companies in regions and 
countries other than North America and Germany will be useful.
Chapter XVI
Size Matters! Enterprise System Success in Medium and Large Organizations................................. 218
Darshana Sedera, Queensland University of Technology, Australia
This chapter explores the proposition that the size of the organization (e.g. medium, large) may contribute 
to the differences in benefits received from enterprise systems. The alleged differences in organizational 
performance are empirically measured using a previously validated model, using four dimensions 
employing data gathered from 310 respondents representing 27 organizations. Results from this study 
indicate that organization size undoubtedly has a strong influence on the benefits received from the 
enterprise system.
Section IV
Enterprise Systems: Implementations and Applications
The implementation and application of enterprise systems is a complex technical and organizational 
process. Lack of understanding of the issues involved in successful application development and 
implementation is responsible for many enterprise system failures in practice. However, utilizing 
appropriate implementation and application development methodologies, tools, and techniques can 
significantly increase the chances of success in beneficial use of enterprise systems. Various chapters 
in this Section IV of this handbook discuss the issues involved and the possible approaches that can 
be taken for application development and successful implementation of enterprise systems in various 
industrial sectors.

Chapter XVII
Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems.......................................................................................... 233
Joseph Bradley, University of Idaho, USA
This chapter examines what ERP implementation projects involve, what the best of breed strategy is, 
when it is used, and what advantage adopting companies seek. Utilizing examples of best of breed imple-
mentations, differences in critical success factors in “vanilla” and best of breed projects are identified, 
and future trends in the best of breed strategy are suggested. The chapter argues that the best of breed 
strategy offers firms the opportunity to maintain or create competitive advantage based on unique busi-
ness processes while “Vanilla” ERP implementations may result in all competitors adopting the same 
business processes leaving no firm with any advantage.
Chapter XVIII
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation..................................................................... 245
Ganesh Vaidyanathan, Indiana University, USA
This chapter discusses ERP implementation procedure using the SAP implementation. ERP implementa-
tions in recent years have raised a number of questions regarding its success. Many companies regard 
ERP as their one and only savior, and many others despise that ERP as a single-system that has brought 
them to their knees. Regardless, many more companies, small to medium size companies in particular, 
are beginning to invest in ERP. An industrial practitioner from such small to medium companies needs 
to understand how to implement ERP. This chapter provides the necessary tools and background for 
the industrial practitioner to implement not only ERP systems but implement the next generation of 
enterprise applications as well.
Chapter XIX
Restructuring the Marketing Information System for eCRM: An Application of the 
Eriksson-Penker Method...................................................................................................................... 262
Călin Gurău, GSCM – Montpellier Business School, France
This chapter discusses the importance of business modeling for implementing e-CRM systems. The intro-
duction of e-business models requires the adaptation of the Marketing Information System to the specific 
characteristics of the online environment. Considering the specific requirements of this adaptation and 
re-structuring marketing information system, this chapter presents the advantages of the Eriksson-Penker 
Business Extensions of the Unifying Modeling Language (UML), and exemplifies their use for modeling 
the Marketing Information System during the implementation of an interactive e-CRM approach.
Chapter XX
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment....................................................... 274
Albert Boonstra, University of Groningen, The Netherlands
This chapter describes and analyzes how ES implementation within a hospital affects the interests of 
stakeholders and which specific problems may arise as a result. It uses the evidence from a case study 
to reveal important dimensions of the organizational change issues related to ES implementation within 
hospitals. The author suggests that an understanding the possible impact of ES on particular stakeholder 

interests may help project managers and others to manage ES implementation within hospitals in a more 
effective way.
Chapter XXI
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively............................................................. 287
S. Padmanaban, S2 Nikita Meridien, India
This chapter discusses the experience from two projects on designing to deploying ERP systems for 
two different organizations engaged in education and construction. Reporting on various processes, 
practices, techniques, and methods employed through the projects, and the lessons learnt from them, the 
chapter argues that time has come for designing and deploying industry-neutral generic ERP systems 
cost effectively. It proposes that through a combination of appropriate technologies, innovative tools, 
techniques and strategies, highly adoptive and customizable ERP systems can be designed and deployed 
at affordable costs and within reasonable timeframes.

ERP Systems in Higher Education from Regional Perspective........................................................... 302
Mateja Podlogar, University of Maribor, Slovenia
Katalin Ternai, Corvinus University of Budapest, Hungary
This chapter introduces the ERP systems, their complexity, and especially their integration in higher 
education as a significant challenge for many institutions. Information society paradigm, globalization, 
and the rapidly changing environment affect both the contents and the organization of higher education. 
In the always-conservative academic world, the organizational structure is very hierarchical and the 
knowledge transfer is fragmented. This chapter illustrates a way to develop training programs in higher 
education on an integrated ERP platform from a regional perspective.
Section V
Enterprise Systems: ERP and Beyond
ERP is already the mainstay of present business applications. The next generation enterprise applications 
will focus on supply chain management, customer relationship management for collaborative decision-
making while encompassing more domains of business and other public organizations. Also, the drivers 
for future enterprises would be applications with open and flexible architectures. Thus the enterprise 
architecture will move towards service-oriented architecture (SOA) and will include a wider range of 
applications and scope of enterprise systems. Various chapters in the final section of this handbook 
discuss these aspects and look beyond ERP to suggest a wider scope and role for enterprise systems 
including e-government and knowledge distribution.

Valentin Nicolescu, Technische Universität München, Germany
Holger Wittges, Technische Universität München, Germany
Helmut Krcmar, Technische Universität München, Germany

This chapter provides an overview of past and present development in technical platforms of ERP systems 
and their use in enterprises. Taking into consideration the two layers of application and technology, the 
chapter presents the classical scenario of an ERP system as a monolithic application block. The chapter 
highlights how ERP is shifting towards more flexible architecture like the service-oriented architecture 
(SOA) in modern companies. The chapter not only discusses the historical development of ERP system 
landscapes but also presents its application and technology view.

This chapter discusses the evolution of ERP and salient features of ERP II including the disruptive 
technologies which will help reengineer ERP systems rapidly. The results of an international survey 
pertaining to the embedding of intelligence in the modern day ERP are also presented. The common 
causes for the failure of ERP implementation are included to shed light on aspects which are of utmost 
importance to ERP implementation. The example of placing order remotely over Internet by a sales clerk 
sitting away from the factory forms a part of this chapter to benefit the readers in better understanding 
the functioning of an ERP system.

E-Government and ERP: Challenges and Strategies........................................................................... 346
Gita A. Kumta, SVKM’s NMIMS University, School of Business Management, 
   Mumbai, India
The chapter introduces the essence of ERP in Government as a tool for integration of government func-
tions which provides the basis for citizen services. It discusses the challenges faced in modernization of 
government “businesses” and the strategies available for ERP implementation. Acknowledging the basis 
of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions as integration of functions which capture basic data 
through transactions to support critical administrative functions such as budgeting and financial manage-
ment, revenue management, supply chain management and human resources management, the author 
argues that Enterprise solutions (ES) today go beyond ERP to automate citizen-facing processes.

Advances in computing and communication technologies have profoundly accelerated the development 
and deployment of complex Enterprise Systems (ES) in small, medium, and large enterprises seeking 
organizational improvements and business benefits. These systems are helping organizations reduce 
working capital requirements such as cash and inventory, and improve customer service by reducing 
cycle time and increasing service levels thus increasing companies’ operational effectiveness. In fact, 
Enterprise Systems have evolved to become the information backbones of the organizations. This back-
bone has been further expanded to supply chain optimization, customer relationship management, data 
warehousing, and many other management intelligence systems. The implementation of such complex 
information systems in industries and organizations is considered as one of the most important develop-
ments in corporate use of information technology. 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is now being hailed as a foundation for the integration of or-
ganization-wide information systems. ERP systems link together entire organization’s operations such 
as accounting, finance, human resources, manufacturing, distribution, and so forth. Moreover, they 
also connect the organization to its customers and suppliers through the different stages of the product 
or the process life cycle. ERP is a part of the larger set of technology and operations driven systems, 
called Enterprise Systems that aim at integrating the entire enterprise and even a set of enterprises. The 
literature on ERP success and/or failure is inconclusive. While some analysts report positive impacts 
and outcomes of ERP application, others have revealed ERP failures. One of the reasons behind these 
different views lies in the multidimensionality of the concept of success and the difficulty of developing 
a single success/failure measurement. 
This Handbook of Research on Enterprise Systems aims to encompass the most comprehensive 
source of coverage related to the past, present, and emerging directions of Enterprise Systems in their 
broadest scope and role in the organizations. Topics included in this handbook provide a broad basis for 
understanding the issues, technologies, theories, applications, opportunities, and challenges being faced 
by researchers and organizations today, in their quest for Enterprise Systems development, implementa-
tion, management, and vision for the future.
To create such a handbook of research on Enterprise Systems, we decided to launch this project where 
researchers from all over the world were invited to contribute. The primary objective of this project was 
to assemble as much research coverage related to the Enterprise Systems as possible. The idea behind 
this project was to gather the latest information on Enterprise Systems from researchers worldwide. 
Therefore, in order to provide the best balanced coverage of concepts and issues related to the selected 
topics of this handbook, researchers from around the world were asked to submit proposals describing 
their proposed coverage and the contribution of such coverage to the handbook. All proposals were 
carefully reviewed by the editors in light of their suitability as well as the researchers’ record of similar 
work in the area of the proposed topics. 
Preface

xxii  
The goal was to assemble the best minds in the Enterprise Systems field to contribute to the handbook. 
Upon the receipt of full chapter submissions, each submission was forwarded to expert external review-
ers on a double-blind, peer review basis. Only submissions with strong and favourable reviews were 
chosen as chapters for this handbook. In many cases, submissions were sent back for several revisions 
prior to final acceptance. As a result, this handbook includes 27 chapters highlighting concepts, issues, 
emerging technologies, and applications of enterprise systems. All entries are written by knowledge-
able, distinguished scholars from well-known academia and prominent research institutions around the 
world. The authors who have contributed to this book are well known Enterprise Systems experts who 
have been doing research on various aspects of Enterprise Systems for several years and have tried to 
present their work in most lucid and simple words. It is hoped that readers will find it easy to understand 
and implement some of suggested approached.
This handbook is organized into five broad sections for cohesive and comprehensive presentation of 
a variety of topics related to the Enterprise Systems.  A brief description of each section, followed by 
coverage of the various chapters in each section, is provided below.
Section I, Enterprise Systems: Technologies, Solutions, and Strategic Perspectives, begins with 
the growing importance of increasing “enterprise agility” in the organization with the understanding 
of the technologies available to develop and deploy Enterprise Systems (ES) in organizations. In the 
current global and competitive business environment, it is essential to be flexible and agile simultane-
ously. The six chapters in this section discuss the technologies, solutions, and strategic perspective of 
implementing and using enterprise systems and the tools available to analyze and evaluate proposed 
solutions. These research-based discussions include topics such as the means for researchers to explore 
enterprise agility in a systematic way and identify a number of important issues regarding the attain-
ment of such capability, the concepts behind SAP Business Blueprint as an integrated environment that 
simplifies the enterprise design process, the key aspects of Free/Open Source Enterprise Resources 
Planning systems (FOS-ERP), Business Process Modeling (BPM) concepts and evolving modelling 
standards and technologies for enterprise systems’ integration, how information technology, and ERP 
together facilitate in aligning the business and the role and place of executive information systems in 
the evolution of enterprise systems. 
Section II, Enterprise Systems: Risks, Performance, and Business Value, discusses risk and 
performance issues related to enterprise systems. Business operations are composed of a collection of 
business processes. An enterprise system is an approach to integrate business processes, people, ap-
plications, and systems; in essence integrating the business, for business transformation and business 
value creation.  Studies have proven that integration is not only a key reason for the adoption of Service 
Oriented Architecture (SOA) but also for improving business value.  However, such a wider scope and 
holistic view of enterprise systems creates high level of complexity which leads to increased levels of 
risk and issues concerning their performance and business value. Therefore, it is important to assess 
the risk of implementing enterprise systems and the performance gains that can be achieved.  Further, 
it is important to consider integration in a wider concept, including the entire supply chain and the 
customer relationships. The six chapters in this section are devoted to the discussion of relevant topics 
to enable the readers to understand the relationship between risks, performance, and business value 
while developing, implementing, and deploying integrated enterprise systems. The chapters in this sec-
tion discuss the alignment of enterprise systems with business strategy and its impact on the business 
value that enterprise systems generate, the potential of integrating SCM and CRM, ERP investment and 
achievement of improved business performance, the potential impact of the consideration of enterprise 
information systems’ administrative and execution context as a component of the application software 
development process.

  xxiii
Section III, Enterprise Systems: Small, Medium, and Large Organizations, is devoted to the 
ERP implementations in small, medium, and large organizations. The initial developments in enterprise 
systems in the form of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems concentrated on their deployment in 
large business firms. However, in the modern competitive landscape, the ERP solutions have received 
favourable response from corporate as well as small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Many SMEs 
are implementing ERP initiatives for enhancing their inventory management, cash management and 
thereby trigger the overall efficiency of the enterprise. ERP requirements, investments and challenges 
for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are different from large organizations. Sceptics argue that 
heavy investments in ERP implementation in SMEs may not bear the same fruits as large organizations. 
It is felt that SMEs may take a great deal of time, money and effort for them to understand the business 
processes restructuring and technology and may never effectively customize enterprise systems due to 
nature of its small and medium size. The first three chapters in this section discuss the issues related to 
the development, implementation, and use of enterprise systems in SMEs. The final chapter in this sec-
tion explores the impact of organization size on the benefits of enterprise systems.
Section IV, Enterprise Systems: Implementation and Applications, deals with the approaches, 
frameworks, methods, tools, and technologies that are used in ES implementation and applications. Usu-
ally, companies have silos of information making retrieving and exchanging disparate corporate data often 
a complex and time consuming process. ERP systems are used to consolidate the desperate resources 
into an integrated database for seamless exchange and retrieval of information. Integrated information 
helps in enhancing enterprise performance and increase business value.  However, lack of understanding 
of the issues involved in successful application development and implementation of enterprise systems 
is responsible for many enterprise system failures in practice. Utilizing appropriate implementation and 
application development methodologies, tools, and techniques can significantly increase the chances of 
success in beneficial use of enterprise systems. Six chapters in this section discuss the issues involved 
and the possible approaches that can be taken for application development and successful implementa-
tion of enterprise systems in various industrial sectors.
Section V of this handbook deals with the topic of ERP and Beyond. The boundaries of the enter-
prise have shifted and now extend to customers and suppliers who are outside the organization. The 
next generation enterprise applications will focus on supply chain management, customer relationship 
management for collaborative decision-making, all while encompassing more domains of business and 
other public organizations. Also, the drivers for future enterprises would be applications with open and 
flexible architectures. Thus the enterprise architecture will move towards service-oriented architecture 
(SOA) and will include a wider range of applications and scope of enterprise systems. Five chapters 
in this final section of the handbook describe state-of-the-art developments in Enterprise Systems and 
look beyond ERP to suggest a wider scope and role for Enterprise Systems including e-government 
and knowledge distribution. The authors having contributions in this section also suggest guidelines to 
emerging frameworks and next generation IT for knowledge distribution in enterprises.
This handbook is edited to cover a wide range of topics that are considered at the core of research 
and development of enterprise systems and applications. The coverage of this Handbook of Research on 
Enterprise Systems provides a reference resource for enterprise systems researchers both from industry 
and academia and professionals in obtaining a greater understanding of the concepts, issues, problems, 
trends, challenges, and opportunities related to this field of study. It is hoped that the diverse and com-
prehensive coverage of Enterprise Systems in this handbook will contribute to a better understanding 
of the research focuss and trends towards future developments in this evolving field of study. It is our 

xxiv  
sincere hope that this publication, with its great amount of information, will assist the enterprise systems 
researchers, faculty members, graduate students, and organizational decision makers in enhancing their 
understanding of the current and emerging issues in enterprise systems. Furthermore, we hope that the 
contributions included in this handbook will be instrumental in the expansion of the body of knowledge 
in this vast .eld.

Efficient response to change, both upon expected and unpredicted contingencies, is a critical character-
istic for modern enterprises. This chapter presents the various ways this feature has been addressed in 
the literature and explains why the term “enterprise agility” has been adopted for characterizing this 
capability.  Furthermore, it provides a holistic approach for analyzing enterprise agility that is based on 
an introduced viewpoint-oriented Enterprise Architecture. The ultimate target is to provide the means for 
researchers to explore enterprise agility in a systematic way and identify a number of important issues 
regarding the attainment of such capability. 
IntroductionTRCTI
Nowadays, organizations operate in highly turbu-
lent environments having to cope with a frenetic 
pace of change (Rockart et al, 1996). Globalization 
and continual technological evolution are the main 
drivers of this turbulence. Other change factors 
include political issues, deregulation, consolida-
tion in the business network, etc. (Oosterhout et al. 
2006). As firms continuously sense opportunities 

2  
A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
for competitive action in their product-market 
spaces, it is agility which underlies firms’ success 
in continuously enhancing and redefining their 
value creation in highly dynamic environments 
(Sambamurthy et al., 2003).
Indeed, agility has been recognized as a key 
characteristic of a modern enterprise. It has been 
therefore the concern of a plethora of researchers 
who have identified that agility is of a polymor-
phous nature and cannot easily be attained. To 
explore the concept of enterprise agility taking into 
consideration all necessary aspects, we propose 
an approach that is based on a viewpoint-oriented 
Enterprise Architecture. The term Enterprise 
Architecture as employed in this chapter is in 
contrast to enterprise architecture as perceived 
by IFEAD (http://www.enterprise-architecture.
info/ifead%20about.htm) or Zachman framework 
(Zachman, 2004) where IT is considered the focus 
of attention. Our approach treats all perspectives, 
for example people, business process and infor-
mation systems, as of equal importance. This is 
necessary for a proper examination of enterprise 
agility, as any partial approach will not be able 
to identify all the parameters necessary for an 
enterprise to be deemed agile. 
Through this viewpoint-oriented architecture 
and the proposed approach, we provide a struc-
tured method for a holistic analysis of enterprise 
agility, aiming at helping researchers to identify 
issues or requirements for the attainment of agility. 
This chapter provides such an analysis through 
which a number of important agility issues are 
identified. 
The chapter is structured as follows: First a 
literature review is provided which leads to the 
deduction of useful conclusions regarding agility. 
Then, the viewpoint-oriented Enterprise Architec-
ture and the proposed approach are presented. The 
following two sections demonstrate the approach. 
The last section wraps up the chapter with some 
concluding remarks.
LITRTRRI
Enterprises able to respond efficiently to change 
are characterized by different terms in the lit-
erature, such as flexible organizations, agile 
enterprises, adaptive enterprises, sense-and-
respond enterprises, and less often, intelligent 
enterprises. 
The term flexible organization is introduced 
by Leeuw and Volberda (Leeuw and Volberda, 
1996) who describe organizational flexibility 
through synonyms such as mobility, responsive-
ness, agility, suppleness and litheness. Based on 
system control theory, they have developed a 
definition for organizational flexibility accord-
ing to which “flexibility is the degree to which 
an organization possesses a variety of actual 
and potential procedures, and the rapidity by 
which it can implement these procedures, in 
order to increase the control capability of the 
management and improve the organization and 
the environment”. Evans (Evans, 1991) denotes 
that flexibility is the ability to do something other 
than what was originally intended, emphasizing 
thus the ability to respond to unforeseen changes 
as well. Evans characterizes flexibility as a poly-
morphous concept and analyses it by relating it to 
other similar concepts, most notably adaptability, 
agility, versatility, resilience and malleability. 
Evans distinguishes two types of flexibility in 
terms of intention, namely offensive and defen-
sive flexibility, and two types in respect to time, 
namely ex ante and ex post flexibility. Offensive 
flexibility concerns creating and seizing an ini-
tiative, while defensive means guarding against 
predatory moves or correcting past mistakes. Ex 
ante flexibility involves in advance preparation 
for future transformations, while ex post concerns 
adjustments that take place after a triggering 
episode has occurred. Golden and Powel (Golden 
and Powel, 2004) define flexibility as the capacity 
to adapt and specify four flexibility dimensions; 
temporal, intention, range and focus. The first 
denotes how long it takes for an organization to 

  3
A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
adapt and the second indicates whether the adap-
tation is proactive or reactive. Range denotes the 
options an organization has for expected as well 
as unpredicted changes. The distinction between 
flexibility for expected changes and flexibility for 
unforeseen changes has been also addressed by 
Carlsson (Carlsson, 1989). Lastly, focus specifies 
whether the flexibility is internal or external with 
regard to enterprise boundaries.
The term agile enterprise has been exten-
sively used by Dove (Dove, 2005a) to characterize 
firms in terms of knowledge management, value 
proposition skills and response ability. Knowledge 
management concerns the timely awareness that 
a change should be made, both in a reactive and 
proactive manner. Value proposition skills regard 
the ability to effectively select the most appropriate 
among competing response alternatives. Response 
ability refers to the modification of business 
processes in real time. Response ability, besides 
change proficiency, requires a system response 
architecture structured as reconfigurable systems 
of reusable modules in a scalable framework, and 
an efficient change management process. Dove et 
al. (Dove et al., 1996) have defined four change 
proficiency metrics, namely time, cost, robustness 
and scope. Time and cost are self-explanatory. 
Robustness measures the quality of the change 
process. Scope indicates how much change can 
be accommodated. The term agile enterprise has 
been also used by Kubil and Nadhan (Kubil and 
Nadhan, 2005) and Henbury (Henbury, 1996). 
The term adaptive enterprise, and more specif-
ically adaptive complex enterprise, is introduced 
by Desai (Desai, 2005). Desai is influenced by 
systems theory, and in particular from complexity 
theory. Complexity theory is based on relation-
ships, patterns and iterations and specifies that the 
universe is full of systems which are complex and 
constantly adapting to their environment; hence 
complex adaptive systems. Haeckel (Haeckel, 
1995; Haeckel, 1999) also suggests managing 
organizations as complex adaptive systems. Based 
on systems theory, he introduces the sense-and-
respond enterprise to distinguish a modern orga-
nization model from that of the more traditional 
make-and-sell model. According to Haeckel, the 
behavior of sense-and-respond organizations can 
be represented by a four-phase adaptive loop; first, 
sense change in their environment and internal 
states, second, interpret this change in the context 
of their experiences, aims and capabilities, filter-
ing opportunities from threats, third, decide how 
to respond and fourth, act according to their deci-
sions. Haeckel believes that through the adaptive 
loop process, sense-and-respond firms can cope 
with rapid change in an uncertain environment. 
Haeckel (Haeckel, 1999) relates agility to the 
sense-and-respond enterprise, based on the two 
dimensions suggested by this model. More spe-
cifically, following this dual perspective, a firm’s 
agility can be distinguished to sensing agility and 
response agility. He defines sensing agility as a 
firm’s capacity to rapidly discover and interpret 
the market opportunities through its information 
systems. Response agility relates to the organiza-
tional capability to effectively transform knowl-
edge into action in response to the environmental 
signals. The terms adaptive complex enterprise 
and sense-and-respond enterprise are also used 
by Ramanathan (Ramanathan, 2005) to character-
ize firms that have embraced change and learned 
to operate in varying circumstances. Jeng et al. 
(Jeng et al., 2005) and Evgeniou (Evgeniou, 2002) 
have employed the term adaptive enterprise in 
a similar fashion.
In contrast to the aforementioned terms, the 
term intelligent enterprise occurs much more 
rarely in the literature. However, it has been also 
used to denote an enterprise that has the ability 
to easily evolve, following the changes of its eco-
system. Delic and Dayal (Delic and Dayal, 2003) 
claim that an intelligent enterprise is one that can 
behave like a biological system morphing into 
new forms whenever imposed by environmental 
changes, and bearing the characteristics of agility 
and adaptability. To achieve this, the enterprise 
should be able to sense its environment, under-

4  
A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
stand the situation, exhibit learning behavior and 
create a feasible and effective plan to execute. 
Our literature review reveals that the need for 
a new kind of enterprises able to cope with envi-
ronments that are intensely competitive, highly 
turbulent and continuously innovative has been 
widely addressed, even though there is no stan-
dardized or common term to characterize them. 
Most prevailing terms are based on the concepts 
of flexibility, adaptability and agility. However, 
there is confusion regarding the relation among 
these concepts. Some researchers consider them 
synonyms or almost synonyms (Leeuw and 
Volberda, 1996; Evans, 1991). Others specify a 
dependency relationship between them. Evgeniou 
(Evgeniou, 2002), for instance, deems flexibility 
as a prerequisite for an adaptive enterprise. Dove 
(Dove, 2005b) on the other hand, differentiates 
flexibility from agility by stating that the former 
refers to the ability to respond to expected changes 
while the latter concerns unforeseen changes as 
well. This is in contrast to other researchers who 
employ the term flexibility both for expected as 
well as unforeseen contingencies (Evans, 1991; 
Carlsson, 1989).
Furthermore, there is apparently an overlap 
among different research approaches. For ex-
ample, offensive and defensive flexibility defined 
by Evans (1991) correspond to active and passive 
flexibility respectively, specified in Leeuw and 
Volberda (1996). Likewise, knowledge man-
agement, value proposition and response abil-
ity introduced by Dove (Dove, 2005a) are very 
close to the interactive loop stages suggested by 
Haeckel (Haeckel, 1999). In particular, knowl-
edge management corresponds to sensing and 
interpretation, value proposition maps to deci-
sion, and response ability corresponds to action. 
Temporal and intention dimensions of flexibility 
defined by Evans (Evans, 1991) are also stated in 
Golden and Powel (2004).
It should be noted that most researchers, 
although using different terms, they have recog-
nized that the ability alone to adapt quickly and 
easily to change does not adequately delineate 
the profile of the enterprise that can thrive in 
highly dynamic environments. Therefore, they 
have extended the meaning of either flexible or 
adaptive or agile enterprise to include the capabil-
ity to analyze information effectively and sense 
environmental changes in a timely manner, and 
make not only reactive but even proactive move-
ments based on efficient decision-making. Thus, 
they have designated a manifold interpretation to 
these terms.  
In the remaining of this chapter, the term 
agile enterprise is adopted, as we regard that the 
meaning of the words flexibility and adaptability 
is narrowed to the ability to change. According 
to Oxford Advanced Genie Dictionary, the terms 
flexibility and adaptability are synonyms and 
mean the ability to change to suit new conditions 
or situations. In the same dictionary, the term 
agility is defined as the ability to move quickly 
and easily. As such, agility is a more appropriate 
word because it incorporates also the meaning of 
rapidity - a very important aspect. For example, a 
company may adapt to new market conditions in 
10 years. This may render the company adaptable 
but by no way agile, as its response to change is 
far from fast. In addition, the word agility may 
be used in a broader sense to denote not only ef-
ficient response to change but also the ability for 
proactive movements in advantageous positions, 
implying not only responding to change but even 
causing change.

The attainment of an agile enterprise is a difficult 
issue. It requires effective knowledge management 
and learning capacity through data collection and 
analysis. It involves efficient decision making 
and quick deployment of a rigorous solution in 
response to environmental signals, enabled by 
flexible information systems. Therefore, agility 
as a property should characterize all aspects of 

  5
A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
a firm, such as employees, information, business 
processes, technology, etc. Consider for example 
an enterprise that has developed a ‘super agile’ IT 
infrastructure. Such an infrastructure has no value 
at all if personnel are unable to understand and 
adjust themselves to new circumstances. Likewise, 
efficient response to change will not be feasible if 
the necessary applications exist but the fast and 
effective communication between stakeholders 
is hindered due to an inflexible organizational 
structure. Consequently, an enterprise is agile 
only if it exhibits agility at any level from any 
perspective.
As already mentioned, to explore the concept 
of enterprise agility taking into consideration 
all necessary aspects, we propose an approach 
that is based on a viewpoint-oriented Enterprise 
Architecture, which treats all organizational per-
spectives as of equal importance. IEEE’s Recom-
mendation Practice for Architectural Description 
of Software-Intensive Systems (IEEE 1471-2000) 
proposes that an architecture is a collection of 
viewpoints, i.e. architectural descriptions that 
concern each individual stakeholder. Each 
viewpoint is associated with a specific view. A 
view is a representation of a whole system from 
the perspective of a related set of concerns. This 
approach has been adopted by various initiatives 
(Zachman, 1999; ISO/IEC & ITU-T).  The Open 
Distributed Processing Reference Model (RM-
ODP), for example, is a conceptual framework 
established by ISO (ISO/IEC & ITU-T) for the 
specification of large-scale distributed systems. 
RM-ODP integrates aspects related to the distribu-
tion, interoperation and portability of distributed 
systems, in such a way that network/hardware 
infrastructure is transparent to the user. RM-ODP 
manages system internal complexity through the 
“separation of concerns”, addressing specific 
problems appearing during system development, 
from five generic and complementary viewpoints 
(namely Enterprise, Information, Computational, 
Engineering and Technology). 
Similarly, IEEE recommendation can be ap-
plied in order to specify a viewpoint-oriented 
Enterprise Architecture. The introduced Enter-
prise Architecture, as presented in Figure 1, is 
considered from five distinct viewpoints, namely 
people, organizational, business process, infor-
mation technology and information. 
The identification of different viewpoints 
facilitates the procedure of agility analysis as 
it is easier through the ‘separation of concerns’ 
to focus on certain issues associated with a spe-
cific viewpoint. However, as these viewpoints 
are interrelated, analyzing enterprise agility by 
merely considering each view in isolation does 
not suffice. What is additionally required is the 
examination of view interrelations, resulting in 
the ‘integration of concerns’. As such, our analysis 
approach includes two phases:
1.	
Separation of concerns: implications for 
enterprise agility are identified for each 
different view.
2.	
Integration of concerns: implications for 
enterprise agility are identified from the 
interrelation between views. 
In the remaining of this section, we present 
the enterprise architecture from each separate 
viewpoint.

A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
People View
The enterprise architecture from the People 
viewpoint is depicted in Figure 2. The role of the 
people within an entrepreneurial environment, i.e. 
the information systems users or stakeholders, 
has been extensively examined and analyzed in 
the literature.  If what is deemed necessary is an 
“agile user”, he may be defined by the knowledge 
that he posses, the competence and technical skills 
he can display relevant to the particular line of 
day-to-day work he undertakes in the organiza-
tion plus the culture that he has.  
Knowledge refers to a ‘dictionary’ of solutions 
to problems that he has to propose in a multitude 
of situations and the certainty that he has that these 
solutions will each time provide a satisfactory 
result.  Although knowledge requires – and is the 
result – of extensive experience, competencies 
and skills are just the toolset needed to carry out 
the range of specific tasks that he is accountable 
for.  Culture permeates a user’s worldview and 
hence informs his actions as it is a set of beliefs 
and assumptions regarding the possible ways each 
activity should be performed.
Organizational View
The enterprise personnel operate in accordance 
with the organizational structure of the enterprise. 
Thus, every employee has a specific role in the 
company (e.g. manager, secretary, etc.) and a 
specific relation to other employees based on the 
role hierarchy (e.g. the general director is senior 
to the director of every department).  In addition, 
every employee acts according to the company’s 
policies, which are a set of rules defined by the 
company, governing its operations, as well as its 
employees’ actions. Lastly, the organizational 
structure includes also the division of the en-
terprise into specific units. The elements of the 
organizational structure as presented in Figure 3, 
are interrelated. Indeed, regarding roles and role 
hierarchy, their relation is self-evident. Moreover, 
both, roles and their hierarchy are usually associ-
ated with specific policies. Policies may also be 
defined regarding the organization and collabora-
tion between units. Units may be associated with 
specific roles (e.g., the inventory manager is the 
one who is in charge of the Inventory department; 
in this case unit represents a department).I
Information View
Information is the most valuable asset of a modern 
enterprise. The enterprise architecture from the 
Information viewpoint is depicted in Figure 4. 
A fundamental component of information is its 
structure, i.e. grammar and syntax. Content can 
be generated using structure. Content is charac-
terized by semantics, which is the meaning that 
content conveys based on various parameters 
such as context, for example, or the person that 
interprets it. As such, the same content may have 
multiple meanings. 
The U.S. Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) defines information as any communication 
or representation of knowledge such as facts, data 
or opinions, in any medium or form, including tex-
tual, graphic, numerical, narrative or audiovisual

forms (OMB A-130). Therefore, representation 
and communication aspects are also included in 
the information building block stack. The double 
arrow between them shown in Figure 4 implies 
that there is a two-way dependency between rep-
resentation and communication aspects. Indeed, 
in case of a graphical representation for example, 
information cannot be easily communicated by 
word of mouth. A printed form would be more 
appropriate in such a case.B
Business Processes View
Business processes constitute the heart of an en-
terprise. Presley et al. (Presley et al., 1993) define 
an enterprise as a collection of enterprise activities 
organized into a set of business processes, which 
cooperate to produce desired enterprise results. 
Enterprise business processes may span multiple 
corporations because apart from internal opera-
tions they may also include business-to-business 
transactions.

A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
Figure 5 presents the basic entities involved 
in a business process description in a technology/
methodology-neutral manner. As depicted in Fig-
ure 5, a business process includes a set of actions 
which, as mentioned above, may regard internal 
operations or business-to-business transactions. 
Each action may be hierarchically decomposed 
to sub-actions. Actions are executed by actors 
(users, systems, etc.) that take over specific roles. 
The sequence and execution of actions are gov-
erned by events which play the role of control 
signals, and rules which specify different paths 
of actions i.e. routes. During the execution of an 
action, each operational process both uses and 
produces resources. Resources involve anything 
which is necessary for the accomplishment of an 
action such as data, devices, and even people. The 
resources used represent the inputs of the process, 
while those produced represent its outputs. Every 
business process always has a final output which 
constitutes the purpose of its execution.
Additionally, business processes are distin-
guished into operational and management pro-
cesses (Davenport, 1993). Operational processes 
are those that embody the execution of tasks com-
prising the activities of an organization. Manage-
ment processes refer not only to those carried out 
by managers or conducted at management level of 
organizations, such as decision making. Instead, 
they are associated with information handling, 
coordination, and control procedures, ensuring the 
efficiency and effectiveness of primary operations, 
which are the focus of operational processes. As 
such, management processes are usually carried 
out by humans who are aided by decision sup-
port systems, while operational processes may 
be partly or fully automated.
Information TeTchnology View
Nowadays, the operation of most enterprises is 
extensively based on Information Technology (IT). 
Figure 6 presents in a layered fashion the elements 
that compose the IT of an enterprise. Again, this 
is a technology-neutral description.
As depicted in Figure 6, the lowest layer is 
the IT infrastructure, which is distinguished into 
hardware and software infrastructure. Hardware 
infrastructure comprises all physical devices, 
such as computers - either servers or worksta-
tions - printers, scanners, etc., and the network 
equipment like switches, cables, routers, etc. On 
the other hand, software infrastructure, which is 
depended on hardware infrastructure, includes 
operating systems, middleware, network protocols 
and core data-processing applications, offering 
basic services such as communication, messag-
ing, security, etc. Such basic services provided by

A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
both software and hardware are common to all 
enterprises independently of their type. Through 
these services, which are characterized as infra-
structure services, IT infrastructure provides the 
foundation to enable present and future business 
applications (Duncan and Bogucki, 1995). Busi-
ness applications (e.g. CRM, ERP, etc.) along with 
the business services they provide, constitute the 
top layer. As opposed to infrastructure services, 
business services are enterprise-specific. Busi-
ness services can be regarded as the crossing 
point between Business Process and Information 
Technology views, as business processes utilize 
for their implementation business services of-
fered by IT.
Obviously, a service-oriented approach for the 
description of IT view is in consistency with the 
current trend which suggests a Service-Oriented 
Architecture (SOA) for IT. SOA is an architectural 
style whose goal is to achieve loose coupling 
among interacting services (IFEAD, 2007). A 
service is a unit of work done by a service pro-
vider to achieve desired end results for a service 
consumer. Both provider and consumer are roles 
played by organizational units as well as software 
agents on behalf of their owners.

A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
Agility Implications from the People I
Viewpoint
People are wary of change. As such, change is 
not easily instigated and one of the key chal-
lenges facing any change initiative is to manage 
the stress and the problems that will come with 
the change (Hammer, 1990). Agility in human 
IT infrastructure implies that employees have 
adopted the perspective that they work in an un-
stable environment where any change may occur 
at anytime, and that they have the competency and 
skills, the knowledge and culture to accept first 
and then cope with change efficiently.  Organi-
zations must search and examine or devise ways 
to implant a culture which not only accepts but 
assigns to change a value emphasizing its neces-
sity regarding an organization’s evolutionary path. 
In the same vein, organizations must seek ways 
to manage the corporate knowledge efficiently. 
In other words, to define, design and implement 
the mechanisms to collect, store and disseminate 
the knowledge that is produced daily and is one 
of the main survival tools of the post-modern 
organization.
In a dynamic environment, it is critical for the 
employees to operate having adopted the perspec-
tive that they work in an unstable environment 
where any change may occur at anytime. This 
means that agility in human IT infrastructure is 
a matter not only of the aforementioned skills and 
knowledge but also of a specific mentality.
Agility Implications from the I
Organizational Viewpoint
An enterprise, in order to be deemed agile, should 
be always willing to adjust its organizational 
structure, if market demands prove its function 
inefficient. Agility of organizational structure 
though, is often hindered due to conflicts arising 
from the established relationships in the existing 
hierarchy. It should be realized however that agility 
in the organizational structure is critical for the 
overall enterprise agility. The way an enterprise 
is organised, affects the efficiency of decision 
making, as well as of activity coordination and 
execution.  
Agility in the organizational structure is 
translated into the willingness to reconsider roles, 
role hierarchy and policies and to move on to 
changes if necessary, even radical ones, in order 
to improve company’s operation and ensure thus 
competitiveness. Also, a company’s operation is 
largely depended on the way departments col-
laborate, as it is quite common that an enterprise 
comprises several cooperating departments. For 
example, it may include a department responsible 
for acquiring raw material, another for production 
and another one for dispatching the products. As 
such, an agile enterprise should exhibit agility 
in the organization of the interdepartmental col-
laboration.
Developing an agile organizational structure 
is indeed a critical issue for the attainment of 
enterprise agility. The typical pyramid-like hi-
erarchy, for example, exhibits less agility, since 
the functions and skills are distributed among 
departments (Fernandes and Duarte, 2005). In 
addition, coordination becomes difficult, as each 
of these departments has internal aims, which may 
create interdepartmental conflicts. As a result, 
clients’ needs cannot be satisfied efficiently and 
with quality. However, as mentioned earlier, agile 
enterprises are oriented towards clients’ needs and 
not internal interests. Process-oriented organiza-
tion seems more appropriate for agile enterprises, 
since in such an organization all the necessary 
functions are embodied in the corresponding busi-
ness processes that cross department boundaries 
and have the same objectives with the client’s ones 
(Hammer, 1996). Such an organization however 
may need to be combined possibly with new roles 
and policies in order to ensure agility. 
It should be noted that the organizational 
structure should facilitate the development of a 
business environment that is supportive of change 
but on the other hand it should ensure the required 
stability so that chaos can be avoided. 

  11
A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
Agility Implications from the I
Information Viewpoint
Agility in the information domain concerns first 
of all its communication aspects. More specifi-
cally, agility in information denotes the efficient 
diffusion of information among stakeholders, as 
well as the easy discovery, at any time, of the re-
quired information. Also, the ability to represent 
the same information in different forms should be 
supported in order to be more easily understood 
by different target groups. Such capabilities lead 
to better control of activities and facilitate sensing 
agility through the knowledge acquired from the 
exploitation of information.
However, to facilitate knowledge management 
and value proposition (Dove, 2005a), the efficient 
acquirement of information does not suffice. It 
should be additionally ensured that information is 
of high quality. Quality of information is specified 
in terms of accuracy, timeliness, coverage and 
relevancy (Sanjay et al. 2004). Only if informa-
tion is of high quality, can its meaning (denoted 
by the Semantics element in Figure 4) be deemed 
reliable and hence valuable. 
Agility Implications from the IB
Business Process Viewpoint
The ability to respond rapidly to changing mar-
keting opportunities by utilizing agile business 
processes is a key attribute of an agile enterprise 
(Goldman et al. 1995). Enterprise agility from 
the business process perspective means that the 
enterprise is able to adjust its processes easily, in 
a timely and cost-effective manner, and efficiently 
execute them, in order to meet new market de-
mands. This presupposes flexibility to modify the 
business process definition. The business process 
definition is the formal and precise description 
of the elements composing a business process 
such as those presented in Figure 5. As such, the 
business process definition should be agile itself, 
allowing even the radical change of the business 
process characterized by Davenport (Davenport, 
1993) as process innovation. Currently, there are 
several approaches for business process definition 
using various modeling techniques, aiming at the 
attainment of agility (Bhat and Deshmukh, 2005, 
Lin and Orlowska, 2005, Ramanathan, 2005). 
Modifying business processes easily implies 
high performance in their execution through their 
continual improvement, as well as their constant 
alignment with the objectives they are meant to 
satisfy. In an agile enterprise, a business process 
always reflects business objectives in a consistent 
manner. This presupposes a methodology or 
technique that will enable efficient analysis of 
all necessary parameters (strategic, market, cus-
tomer-specific, etc.) which should be taken into 
consideration for the generation of a consistent 
business process definition. 
Based on the Business Process View as pre-
sented in Figure 5, we argue that agility in the 
business process definition means the ability to
 
•	
add new actions or delete actions that are 
no longer necessary,
•	
change process sequence by rearranging, 
eliminating or inserting routes,
•	
redefine roles in order for example to reflect 
changes in the organizational structure,
•	
modify rules so as to apply, for example, 
new regulations or new policies adopted by 
the company,
•	
handle events to ensure smooth flow of the 
business process,
•	
use alternative resources if those specified 
initially are not available, as well as map re-
sources to roles in an ad hoc manner, as may 
be imposed by unexpected conditions.
The achievement of maximum agility however 
implies that the modifications mentioned above 
can take place at run time as well, i.e. while a 
business process instance is being executed. Shui-
Guang et al. (ShuiGuang et al., 2004) proposed 
such a method. According to this method, a busi-

12  
A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
ness process is composed of general activities, 
which are predefined in detail at design time and 
flexible activities, which are like a “black box”, 
representing an undetermined sub-process with-
out detailed specification at build time. In other 
words, flexible activities encapsulate the uncertain 
sub-process at run time. At run time, depending 
on current circumstances, a flexible activity can 
be replaced by a concrete sub-process composed 
of selected activities from existing or newly added 
activities (constituting a pool of activities), based 
on selection and composition constraints.
The above pool of activities implies the ability 
to change a business process at run time upon an 
expected event for which a relative activity exists 
in the pool. The ability to change a business process 
at run time upon an unpredicted event reflects the 
highest grade of agility, as depicted in Figure 7. 
On the other hand, the lowest grade corresponds 
to the ability to change a business process at build 
time upon an expected event. The other two cases 
(run time modification upon expected events and 
build time modifications upon unexpected events) 
are regarded of equivalent agility as the former 
has the parameter of runtime while the second 
has the parameter of unexpected. Obviously the 
greatest challenge is the implementation of super 
agile business processes.
Especially for management processes, agility 
has different implications. It basically means the 
capacity to sense environmental changes and make 
the right decisions at the right time. As such, man-
agement processes are mainly related to sensing 
agility which denotes a firm’s capacity to rapidly 
discover and interpret the market opportunities, in 
order to make not only reactive but also proactive 
movements and gain thus competitive advantage 
(Haeckel, 1999). 
Agility Implications from Information II
T chnology Viewpoint
IT agility is a critical factor for the success of 
corporation during periods of intense change, 
especially if agility in IT infrastructure acts as a 
foundation for overall IT flexibility (Davenport 
and Linder, 1994). The attainment of high IT flex-
ibility presupposes a common IT infrastructure 
rather than separate IT platforms and services for 
separate business activities (Keen 1991, Rockart 
et al. 1996). In other words all information sys-
tems of a company should share a common IT 
infrastructure to enable high flexibility. 
As presented in Figure 6, the IT view is ser-
vice-oriented. As such, we argue that an agile 
IT is able to always offer the required services.

A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
The ability to provide the required services at 
any time entails that new applications offering 
the desired services can be quickly and easily 
embodied into the existing infrastructure in a 
plug and play fashion. This in turn, implies that 
IT infrastructure has been deployed as a set of 
reusable and reconfigurable modules. Further-
more, the software and hardware infrastructure 
should provide for scalability as new applications 
are added and more users employ infrastructure 
resources. Reusability, reconfigurability and 
scalability have been identified by Dove (Dove, 
2005b) as the three basic IT infrastructure prin-
ciples with respect to agility.
Currently there are a number of emerging tech-
nologies promising agility like MDA, Business 
Process Management Systems, Grid Computing 
and others. Each of these technologies has a 
different target though, so the issue is how such 
technologies could be combined for the develop-
ment of an agile IT bearing the characteristics of 
reusability, reconfigurability and scalability.

As explained previously, approaching enterprise 
agility by considering each view in isolation does 
not suffice.  As viewpoints are interrelated, it is 
those interrelationships that must be examined 
and analyzed.  By doing so, the complexity of the 
issues at hand is unearthed; a necessary first step 
to a true understanding of enterprise agility. Due to 
space limitations though, we examine only agility 
implications derived from the relation between IT 
and Business Processes views. However, examples 
of issues derived from the rest view interrelations 
are included in Table 2 below. 
Agility Implications Derived from the IR
Relation Between ITB
siness 
Process Views
Business processes are becoming more and more 
interlinked with IT. As such, agility in the former 
presupposes the existence of agility in the second. 
It is true that IT has been characterised as funda-
mental in enabling the redesign of business proc-
esses (Broadbent et al., 1999; Davenport, 1993). 
It should be stressed however that while IT is a 
potential enabler of business process change, it 
may also constitute a potential constraint or inhibi-
tor (Grover et al., 1993). This is particularly true 
when the firm’s IT infrastructure is inappropriate 
or inflexible (Brancheau et al., 1996) due to the 
existence of incompatible systems constructed 
to serve local needs. Such systems cannot easily 
achieve the level of seamless interoperability re-
quired, putting thus limits on both process change 
and process integration. On the other hand, a tight 
integration among systems serving a specific 
business process may also constrain business 
process redesign, since even a small modifica-
tion to the business process may require a great 
effort usually translated into time and money. 
Moreover such an infrastructure is frequently the 
outcome of significant investments. As a result, 
firms cannot easily replace these systems with 
new ones that will satisfy the new requirements. 
Besides, in intensely dynamic environments 
the frequency of change is sometimes so high 
that systems become obsolete before even their 
implementation is finished.
Obviously, agility in IT in terms of efficient 
business process integration and redesign dictates 
an appropriate architecture of IT infrastructure 
that is process-oriented so that IT can play an 
enabling role. An emerging technology enabling 
a process-oriented IT infrastructure is Busi-
ness Process Management (BPM). BPM is the 
descendant of Workflow Management Systems 
(WFMC 2002). While business process manage-
ment supports the main concepts of workflow, it 
bears however broader capabilities, supporting 
the flexible management of dynamic business 
change. For the achievement of true agility, 
BPM technology should be combined with agile 
business process modeling techniques as those 
mentioned earlier.
The above discussion concerns mainly opera-
tional processes. However, IT infrastructure has 
implications for both operational and management 
processes (Mooney et al., 1996). Management 
processes are augmented by improved availability 
and communication of information, decision sup-
port systems, data warehouses and data mining 
systems. These technologies mainly contribute to 
sensing agility which, as explained earlier, denotes 
a firm’s capacity to rapidly discover and interpret 
the market opportunities, in order to make not only 
reactive but also proactive movements and gain 
thus competitive advantage (Haeckel, 1999). As 
a result, effectively utilizing and embedding such 
technologies into the existing IT infrastructure 
so as to ensure agility in management processes, 
constitutes a significant issue for the overall en-
terprise agility.

A Holistic Approach for Enterprise Agility 
C NCLCUSIOSIN
Evidently the realization of an agile enterprise is a 
tough matter raising multiple research issues. Such 
issues can be more efficiently identified through 
a structured approach as the one presented in the 
chapter, which is based on a viewpoint-oriented 
enterprise architecture that ensures a holistic 
analysis of enterprise agility. Based on our analy-
sis of agility through the enterprise architecture 
viewpoints, we identified a number of research 
directions which exemplify a fruitful area for 
further applied and theoretical work.

SAP Business Blueprint is a vital part of SAP implementation exercise. A well-defined business blueprint 
may set the foundation for successful implementation of the subsequent SAP implementation phases; 
provided that the necessary project success factors are in position. This chapter clarifies some of the 
concepts behind SAP Business Blueprint. It explains and views the ERP solution as an integral com-
ponent of the design process. It outlines different aspects of SAP business blueprinting from technical 
infrastructure enablement, while setting the solution landscape, to the details of business process defi-
nition. It points out how the SAP Solution Manager facilitates (business process) architecture-driven 
implementation through tight integration with ARIS Business Architect for NetWeaver. It details ways 
of moving toward Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) utilizing Enterprise Services, and an approach 
for generating Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) models using Web Services Description 
Language (WSDL) imported objects for analysis. I
IntroductionTRCTI
In the past, it was implied that the task of SAP 
Business Blueprinting may be conducted inde-
pendently of the solution landscape. The solution 
landscape was set and configured after the Busi-
ness Blueprinting phase of the SAP implemen-
tation lifecycle, that is, during the Realization 
(Configuration & Testing) phase. In a sense, the 
design was independent of the solution landscape. 
This approach may also be considered as the pre-
SAP Solution Manager practice. 
After the introduction of SAP Solution Man-
ager in January 2002 (Oswald, 2002), the solu-
tion landscape became an integral component of 
the Project Prep and Business Blueprint phases. 

20  
What is SAP Business Blueprint?
The SAP Solution Manager is a complete solu-
tion lifecycle management tool that facilitates 
SAP implementation, as well (Prior, Hommel & 
Vonkarey, n.d.). Assessment and design of the en-
terprise is one of the major activities accomplished 
during the Business Blueprinting phase. While 
some still favor using the tools and methodologies 
prior to Solution Manager, such approach may 
also force reassessment of the enterprise during 
the Realization Phase. 
The following discussion focuses on three 
areas on the enterprise pyramid (see Figure 1): 
enterprise architecture, applications and services. 
Strategic, Communication and Technical Infra-
structure levels are outside of the scope of this 
discussion.
This chapter discusses that the modernized 
approach for SAP Business Blueprint may be 
driven by the technical configuration of the solu-
tion landscape, hence the layout and foundation 
for the organizational design are set from the 
start. The discussion also covers the challenge of 
pre-developed enterprise architectures that reflect 
semi-system enabled enterprises as enterprises 
move toward a fully modernized environment. 
It points out how the SAP Solution Manager 
facilitates (business process) architecture-driven 
implementation through the tight integration with 
ARIS Business Architect for NetWeaver, as well 
as describes how to move toward Service Oriented 
Architecture (SOA) utilizing Enterprise Services, 
and how to develop complete and consistent archi-
tecture traceability up to the strategic level.B
BackgroundCKR
The SAP Business Blueprint phase includes a 
number of activities, events, milestones, and 
deliverables as described in the Accelerated SAP 
(ASAP) Roadmap (2005), generally classified as 
having overall project management significance. 
The Business Blueprint is the output (or product) 
of the project design tasks as they are managed in 
the appropriate tools – the SAP Solution Manager 
and ARIS Business Architect for SAP NetWeaver. 
These tools support architecture-driven imple-
mentation through a tight integration of the 
solution (SAP) and the enterprise architecture 
(ARIS).
While enterprise services design is not part of 
the SAP Business Blueprinting phase, the phase 
may be a viable starting point. With that in mind, 
the topic is addressed in the following section.

 Business BlueprintBSISSBRIT
A comprehensive approach to the SAP Business 
Blueprinting is necessary to design a solution 
that accurately reflects the enterprise landscape. 
This implies that the Business Blueprint to in-
clude the solution landscape configuration and 
to support Enterprise Services development. 
Such an approach makes the design of the enter-
prise operation and the solution landscape fully 
complementary.

What is SAP Business Blueprint?
To support this notion, the topic of SAP Busi-
ness Blueprinting will be discussed in terms of en-
terprise architecture, application and services.
A Business Blueprint process can be applied 
based on the guidelines provided by SAP; however, 
this chapter discusses the development of Business 
Blueprint from a practical SAP implementation 
project perspective.
Enterprise Architecture
SAP Business Blueprint is derived through an 
iterative definition of the business process and 
technical requirements for a specified project using 
the SAP Solution Manager and ARIS Business 
Architect for NetWeaver. The Business Blueprint 
also refers to determining the contents on the solu-
tion and business process architecture repository. 
The phase begins after Project Preparation on the 
SAP implementation lifecycle and ends prior to 
the Realization (Configuration) phase (Feuring, 
2005). Therefore, it is important to note that noth-
ing is built during the Business Blueprint phase. 
The plan (i.e., the completed Business Blueprint) 
describes a completely configured SAP solution, 
including all interface and security requirements. 
During the Realization phase, the customer and 
the implementation consultants, working together, 
“realize” the plan that is defined by the completed 
Business Blueprint. 
The SAP Solution Manager is critical for 
generating content for the solution architecture. 
Three key elements are required in order to create 
Business Scenarios for a project on the Solution 
Manager. For each Business Scenario scope, 
SAP Solution Manager creates a corresponding 
Organization Unit, Master Data, and Business 
Scenarios structure (SAP Library, 2005). These 
three elements defined during the blueprinting 
phase set the foundation for accurately align-
ing the SAP solution to the enterprise business 
processes.
A high-level solution architecture content 
generation process includes (Business Process 
Modeling, 2006):
a.	
Creating a project in the SAP Solution 
Manager;
b.	
Selecting cross-functional business pro-
cesses from predefined Business Scenarios 
in the SAP Solution Manager;
c.	
Synchronizing the SAP Solution Manager 
project content to the solution architecture 
repository in ARIS Business Architect for 
NetWeaver; 
d.	
Further developing the business processes 
using the ARIS Business Architect for 
NetWeaver; and 
e.	
Synchronizing solution architecture content 
from the ARIS business process repository 
to the SAP Solution Manager. 
The Solution Manager controls both the SAP 
part of the solution as well as those business pro-
cesses that are not enabled by the SAP software 
(SAP Solution Manager, 2002). This step is less 
critical if the enterprise enables all of its business 
processes in the SAP product suite, but that is 
seldom (if ever) the case. 
In reality, a number of activities have to be 
accomplished to ensure that the Business Blue-
print, on the solution side, and the architecture 
side comply with applicable rules and regulations. 
Most organizations must be compliant with some 
larger regulatory environment, from Sarbanes-
Oxley to one of the many public sector compliance 
requirements. Thus, the somewhat simplified SAP 
guidelines fall short of addressing the compliance 
requirements as they apply to existing architecture 
development and implementation guidelines.
For example, SAP recommends using the 
SAP Solution Composer as a starting point to 
pick suitable business scenarios from the SAP 
Business Process Repository (BPR ST-ICO150) 
inside the SAP Solution Manager (Business Pro-
cess Modeling, 2006). The predefined business 
processes serve as the basis for the “to-be” busi-
ness processes to be realized in the SAP solution. 
Thus the existing processes may be forced to fit 
(align) to the predefined business processes. This 
approach is known to work in some private sector 
www.ebook3000.com

22  
What is SAP Business Blueprint?
organizations, but in large and complex institu-
tions, these “to-be” processes are problematic. 
These “to-be” processes may not “fit” within 
the “as-is” scenarios (in customer terms) that 
are bound by systems which may not be replaced 
by the SAP solution. This alignment requires 
considerable additional modeling and analysis 
outside of the solution architecture. Further align-
ment of the end-to-end business processes to the 
SAP solution’s predefined business processes 
is required to develop a new “to-be” scenario, 
as well as a “transition” architecture that “fits” 
organizational requirements. 
In some organizations, architecture develop-
ment starts without tight integration with a live 
solution. Some solution architecture may con-
tain proprietary concepts, standards, structures, 
and semantics that can be described using any 
acceptable architecture frameworks. Thus the 
“as-is” architecture, which may also serve as 
the compliance architecture, matures faster. As 
the SAP implementation begins, a new “as-is” 
(a redocumentation) is captured during the SAP 
Level 1 and 2 blueprinting workshops. This makes 
it even more cumbersome to maintain a reposi-
tory that captures a matured “as-is” architecture 
in addition to the new workshop “as-is” models, 
the predefined solution architecture, and the “to-
be” architectures. 
Unfortunately, compliance takes time. Con-
current development of the “to-be” architecture 
from a combination of the “as-is” and the solution 
architecture could be time-consuming. To fully 
realize the benefits of enterprise architecture, 
the architecture repository must be designed to 
enable multi-purpose analysis by incorporating 
the different “flavors” of the business processes 
in a single architecture repository, as well. Such 
analysis includes the different patterns of the 
SAP Scenarios to the Processes. For every SAP 
Scenario, there could be one or more processes 
performed, which could be mapped into a pattern. 
Such analysis in turn makes each instance on the 
pattern a unique instance. For instance, for Sales 
Order Processing and Third Party Order Process-
ing (SAP Scenarios) and Credit Management (SAP 
Process), there could be Credit Management in 
Sales Order Processing; Credit Management in 
Third Party Order Processing, etc. Such relation-
ship-based analysis could be performed to evaluate 
the state of the “to-be” enterprise operation. 
In addition, relationship-based architecture 
analysis supports communication with the gen-
eral user community by providing clarity on the 
system capabilities. For instance, often when 
stating a scope, statements may be made implying 
a process (like Credit Management) that resides 
within the scope of an SAP project. Such no-
tion may be too vague for setting organizational 
touch points and boundaries. Instead, it may be 
important to articulate the scope in reference to 
the result of an architecture analysis. Thus, for 
instance, it may be possible to state that Credit 
Management in Sales Order Processing is within 
the scope of SAP project. While this may be one 
example of an architecture analysis, a number of 
analysis schemes may be derived based on the 
core solution architecture content to help better 
understand the enterprise.
Nevertheless, the enterprise depiction process 
is critical and must be comprehensive because the 
SAP solution must completely align with the non-
SAP business processes in a complex organiza-
tion with many systems enabling the landscape. 
If the SAP software enables only a portion of an 
organization, the Business Blueprint must define 
how the “to-be” SAP processes align with the 
“as-is” business processes that fall outside of the 
SAP solution. Otherwise, the organization cannot 
efficiently execute the cross-functional business 
processes that flow across SAP and non-SAP 
solution components.
The subsequent section discusses the details 
of the SAP solution landscape configuration, 
including the delineation of the system organiza-
tion in terms of structure and units, as well as the 
determination of master data.

What is SAP Business Blueprint?
Enterprise Application: SAPS SSolution 
Landscape Configuration
Some of the terms used in this section are sum-
marized and adopted from various definitions 
posted on the line SAP Help Portal (SAP Library, 
2005). Refer to the Terms and Definitions section 
for more information.
System Organization
Organization in SAP implies two distinct sets of 
expressions: one referring to a system configura-
tion structure, and another, to organizational units. 
In SAP, a system configuration structure defines 
the financial and logistical operational structures 
while configuring the solution. It is defined in 
terms of company code for financials, plant for 
logistics, and sales area for sales and distributions. 
System configuration structures are derived from 
the reporting hierarchy and roles of units in terms 
of production, procurement, maintenance and 
material planning, selling, and purchasing power. 
Selecting a suitable SAP organization structure 
is an intricate analysis process.
An organizational unit in SAP implies to the 
organizational (org) roles of units in terms of re-
sponsibilities for the associated costs. On the other 
hand, a traditional organization unit structure 
usually reflects a hierarchy and authority rather 
than financial obligations. Hence, an org unit in 
SAP is derived from creating a cost-controlling 
area. Both system organization structure and 
organization unit will be discussed in the next 
section.
System Organization Structure
An organizational structure defines an enterprise, 
reflecting its focus. The structure defines, at a 
minimum, information flows and financial roll-
ups hierarchy for reporting and control. In order 
to set-up the SAP software, the organization must 
ensure that its structure will be enabled by the 
SAP software solution. The system organization 
model reflects the degree of centralization across 
an enterprise. For instance, an enterprise with 
one company code, controlling area, and funds 
management area is considered highly centralized. 
Decentralization for such enterprise begins at the 
profit, cost, and business center levels. Conversely, 
an enterprise with multiple company codes mim-
ics a highly decentralized enterprise, even though 
each entity may have, to a certain degree, identical 
controlling and funds management area.
If the SAP solution is fragmented, it may be 
impossible to truly align the software with enter-
prise information flows and reporting structure, 
forcing an artificial Business-to-Business (B2B) 
e-commerce solution inside of the enterprise. 
Similarly, for logistics, organizational struc-
ture is configured through the purchasing power 
of plants. The purchasing organization unit divides 
an enterprise according to the purchasing require-
ments. Unlike the financial system organizational 
structure, the logistics system organizational 
structure determines the degree of cross-organi-
zational business process harmonization for ac-
tivities such as inter-plant planning and transfers. 
As an example, a purchasing organization may 
have one or more plants that are further sub-or-
ganized to multiple storage locations containing 
warehouses. Such structure simplifies business 
processes largely among the plants. Conversely, 
multiple purchasing orgs with individual plants 
increase the complexity of business procedures 
among the plants.
The sales area ties the products and services 
offered within an enterprise with the correspond-
ing financial transactions. The sales area consists 
of a sales org, distribution channel, and division. 
When defining an enterprise on SAP, a sales org 
is assigned to one company code, as well as one 
plant. However, multiple sales orgs may also be 
assigned to a plant. Distribution channel(s)--
product/service outlet vehicles–and division(s)--
product/service sellers--are designated to one or 
more sales orgs. The assignment of a sales org 

24  
What is SAP Business Blueprint?
to a plant provides transparency to the activities 
within a plant, including warehouse inventories 
and services. One organizational entity that is 
not tied to any of the org structures discussed 
above but has important relationships with sales 
and distribution is a shipping point. Shipping 
points are simply stated schedule and process 
shipments. 
As discussed previously, defining a system 
organization structure has a greater operational 
implication on an enterprise, unless outlined 
diligently. This is because, once configured, it is 
hard to go back and undo the company structure 
unless the system is re-installed.
Organizational Unit
An organizational unit in SAP takes a slightly 
different approach than the traditional functional 
job classification used by most organizations. An 
organization unit could be a plant, cost center, 
distribution channel, project team, group, etc. 
with a responsibility over cost. SAP maintains 
each organization unit’s information, such as ac-
count assignment, cost distribution, address, work 
schedule, and quota planning, based on functional 
requirement, allocation criteria, physical loca-
tion, and responsibility for cost. Examples of an 
organizational unit are sales area, receiving point, 
shipping point, storage bin, and loading point.
How is the organization structure on the 
Human Resources (Personnel) side linked to or-
ganization units defined per cost centers? SAP’s 
enterprise organization supports such relationship 
by assigning cost and profit centers to traditional 
organization structures. Thus, it provides a com-
prehensive view of the enterprise by roles and 
responsibilities, costs and revenues. 
Ultimately, each user is then given a role in 
and assigned to an organizational unit, and this 
must be defined and documented in the Business 
Blueprint. SAP’s scheme for assigning roles and 
authorizations applies a three-tiered approach for 
granting access to transactions and task delegation 
(Accelerated SAP, 2005). The ASAP Implementa-
tion Roadmap (2005) strongly recommends that 
the three-tier approach be followed and if possible, 
only Tier 3: Specific job access authorization be 
given to users. This reduces the complexity of 
assigning user roles and authorization. Still, the 
assignment of roles and authorization is a com-
plex process, and SAP does not provide adequate 
tools to enable it. ARIS may be used to manage 
the roles and authorizations, since it provides a 
methodology for maintaining tight configuration 
management control over those assignments.
Master Data Component
Master data is part of each Business Scenario 
scoped on the SAP Solution Manager. Rather 
than addressing master data as it applies to the 
scoped scenarios, its significance may be viewed 
in terms of the importance to the overall project. 
A properly sourced and identified data should be 
linked directly to the enterprise architecture, as 
the data is the information that fuels the enterprise 
(Dr. Carsten Svensson, personal communication, 
February 7, 2007). 
Master data are identified, inventoried, and 
targeted for data conversion as part of the Busi-
ness Blueprint. Master data are key variables that 
are relatively constant. These data may change, 
but infrequently. Master data could include 
business partner records, product conditions, 
master records, material information, material 
classification, charts of accounts, cost centers, 
fund centers, customer material information, 
etc. Data conversion requires that all necessary 
master data be migrated from legacy sources and 
loaded into the SAP production database. This 
can be efficiently accomplished using Extract, 
Transform, and Load methods and tools, but this 
approach cannot alleviate problems of improperly 
identified (i.e., sourced) or missing data on the 
system side.
The SAP solution requires high quality mas-
ter data, and since the solution is enabled by a 

  25
What is SAP Business Blueprint?
consolidated production database, there is a low 
tolerance for data gaps. Therefore, significant 
pre-analysis is required to assess master data 
readiness for any SAP project. The Master Data 
essentially becomes a critical element in applying 
Enterprise Services to SOA.
What are the CoCntents of SAPS 
B siness BlBueprint on the 
Architecture and SoSlution Side? S
The contents of SAP Business Blueprint on the 
solution side is thus the details of the SAP solu-
tion landscape configuration, system organization 
structure, organization units, and master data with 
the supporting documentation. On the architecture 
side reside the details of the business scenarios, 
including business process, process steps, and 
transactions. 
For documentation purposes, the solution 
landscape configuration information can be 
stored in the SAP Solution Manager and may 
be translated into architecture framework in the 
enterprise architecture repository. 
The enterprise architecture repository may 
contain various types of models that depict the 
enterprise business process. For instance, the busi-
ness process can be displayed using the Extended 
Event-Driven Process Chain (eEPC) model type in 
ARIS. The process (represented via SAP function 
object) on an eEPC may be assigned directly to 
the SAP process step using the Function Alloca-
tion Diagram (FAD) model type. This model also 
depicts the details of organizational units, master 
data entities, and transactions. Figure 2 portrays 
an eEPC and FAD models representing the SAP 
process and process step, and their tie with the 
SAP Solution Manager. Other relevant objects 
could be displayed using the FAD, including in-
terfaces, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), or 
any additional information that may be relevant 
for planning purposes. The Business Blueprint 
architecture products can then be used to further 
analyze and optimize the enterprise business 
processes, support enterprise-wide governance, 
and manage process performance once the solu-
tion is deployed.

What is SAP Business Blueprint?
Upon launching of the SAP solution, users are 
able to execute a transaction from the solution ar-
chitecture side on ARIS to SAP. Such tight integra-
tion of the architecture and the solution facilitates 
transition to the new “to-be” business processes, 
as well as user training and acceptance.
Properly documented Business Blueprint is the 
core of a larger implementation plan. It may be 
important for projects to have a complete Business 
Blueprint phase prior to entering the subsequent 
SAP phase. Many projects move forward with an 
incomplete Business Blueprint and a promise to 
“catch up” during the ASAP Realization phase. 
The “catch up” seldom occurs and it is possible 
to have an incomplete Business Blueprint, which 
may significantly reduce the scope upon imple-
mentation or lead to failure.
Furthermore, architecture-driven implemen-
tation reduces implementation cycle-time and 
facilitates future project upgrades; hence good 
documentation is an absolute requirement. It is 
a good business practice to document solution 
information, so that it may be continually reused 
for maintenance over the solution lifecycle.
Enterprise SeSrvices 
To identify where enterprise services fit within an 
SAP Business Blueprint, it is important to discuss 
their details. Enterprise services development 
strategy, as stated on SAP Development Network, 
“are one of the ways that SAP is implementing a 
program of service enablement as part of its over 
all strategy of moving toward enterprise SOA 
across all of its products” (Enterprise Service 
Wiki, 2007).
The standard steps for developing enterprise 
services include identifying process, designing, 
and documenting (Enterprise Services Design 
Guide, 2005, p. 21). Organizations may assess their 
processes using a combination of performance 
data to identify candidate scenarios that may be 
best be handled by enterprise services. A busi-
ness case may be proposed to asses and identify 
the scenarios based on “high-execution time” 
or “high-execution cost” (2005). Performance 
data for enterprises that are blueprinting may be 
computed based on information provided from 
manual and legacy system processes, or there 
may be documented performance matrix using 
frameworks such as Six Sigma or the Supply 
Chain Council Reference (SCOR) model.
Once the process or a set of processes is iden-
tified, SAP’s Enterprise Services Design Guide 
(2005) outlines three approaches for designing 
enterprise services (pp. 21-23). Level 1 is the 
design of a single enterprise service such as as-
sembling information across many systems for a 
particular process. Level 2 is to develop a set of 
enterprise services to address a group of processes; 
in this case, each service may be analyzed when 
executed individually and collectively. And Level 
3 is to develop large scale enterprise services to 
enable multiple enterprises. 
For the purpose of this discussion, numerous 
tests were conducted to assess the intricacy of 
enterprise services and to explore ways of devel-
oping architecture models that depict enterprise 
services framework. 
There are two approaches for developing en-
terprise services. The first approach in a nutshell 
involves converting process models known as 
(eEPC - Extended Event-Driven Process Chain) 
to BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) 
model in ARIS, exporting the model in WSDL 
(Web Services Description Language) format, 
and importing the WSDL to SAP NetWeaver 
Exchange Infrastructure (XI), Integration Reposi-
tory (Natarajan, 2006, pp. 3-6). This approach 
requires further defining the details in XI, such 
as data elements and data types.
The second approach is as stated on SAP 
Development Network (SDN) portal. They state 
that WSDLs are developed in bundles based on 
the demand “independent of an actual imple-
mentation” of the SAP environment following 
an accepted standard (Enterprise SOA, p. 5; 
Enterprise Service-Oriented, 2005, p. 3). These 

  27
What is SAP Business Blueprint?
services may be then be integrated on the SAP 
NetWeaver XI Integration Repository for testing 
and implementation. 
A list of WSDL Enterprise Service bundles 
in XML are listed on SDN. Those services cover 
different areas such as SAP ERP 2005, SAP SCM, 
SAP SRM, and various Industries. Therefore, the 
other option is to import the WSDL directly to 
ARIS Business Architect for NetWeaver and then 
further analyze and integrate the imported content 
in the existing architecture repository. 
 When importing WSDL into ARIS, a folder 
structure containing the enterprise service objects 
is created (Figure 3). A large number of objects 
are created after importing the contents of the 
enterprise services bundle into ARIS. Among the 
imported objects are Port Type, Service Operation, 
Message Type, Message Data Type, Global Data 
Type, and Core Component Technical Specifica-
tion (CCTS) Core Data Type, marked “Imported” 
on Figure 4. The figure shows the structure, object 
type and relationship of the Enterprise Service 
objects. The Service Interface, which is equivalent 
to Process Interface object in ARIS, depicts an 
enterprise function such as Manage Sales Order, 
i.e. an operational activity within an organization 
enabled by the enterprise service bundle.
It is then possible to auto-generate a BPEL 
model (BPEL allocation or BPEL process model) 
using WSDL imported objects and further develop 
analysis models such as SAP integration process 
(XI) model in ARIS.
The Process Component is equivalent to a 
scenario on SAP Solution Manager. A Business 
Object in a simple term is a form. Business Objects 
help trigger the execution of a set of functions or 
simply facilitate information entry and presen-
tation. A Business Object and Business Object 
Node may be inherent to the solution (mySAP 
Business Suite: Service Provisioning, 2006, p. 
43). For instance, SAP SRM Enterprise Service 
bundle enables Supplier Order Collaboration in 
SRM service bundle, having Sales Order Pro-
cessing in SRM process component, Sales Order 
Figure 3. ARIS business architect for NetWeaver, folder structure after importing predefined WSDLs

What is SAP Business Blueprint?
business object, and Create Sales Order service 
(Figure 5).
Enterprise Services Wiki (2007) also describes 
how the process steps flow when executing the 
business process within a Supplier Order Col-
laboration in SRM as an example. The other 
alternative is to identify all the models that depict 
Supplier Order Collaboration in SRM from the 
solution architecture repository, developing BPEL 
process model by referencing multiple process 
models, as applicable, and then fine-tuning the 
BEPL model to make sure it is consistent with 
the process flow depicted on SAP NetWeaver XI 
Integration Repository. The rest is creating the 
appropriate assignment (object to model relation-
ship hierarchy) within the solution architecture 
repository. 
How is it then possible to make the maximum 
use of enterprise services contents during the SAP 
Business Blueprinting? A comprehensive design 
of the solution architecture repository supports ar-
chitecture coherency - a well structured repository 
that not only supports the SAP Business Blueprint-
ing, but also enterprise services, as organizations 
move towards SOA. Ultimately, the imported data 
would be consistently reused across the reposi-
tory. The contents can be analyzed for different 
purposes like grouping the data into information 
clusters and defining it in relation to other objects 
in the solution architecture repository.

What is SAP Business Blueprint?
Enterprise Services
Currently, there is no single product that supports 
design, development, documentation, and execu-
tion of enterprise services. To assess the level of 
effort required for enabling enterprise services, a 
clearly defined migration plan may be necessary. 
What could be achieved now and in the future 
may be driven by new technology developments. 
A realistic plan may pave the way for integrat-
ing capabilities as opportunity avails, not only 
to address the business process pain-points, but 
also all business processes that support the entire 
enterprise operation.

SAP Business Blueprint phase is the phase where 
the operational foundation is set. The modernized 
approach to develop the SAP Business Blueprint 
products may be viewed as one that embraces the 
enterprise architecture, application, and services. 
A comprehensive SAP Business Blueprint product 
consists of the tools to configure, define, synchro-
nize, integrate, and analyze the solution blueprint. 
Good implementation practice requires careful 
planning and disciplined execution. The approach 
discussed makes use of the ARIS Business Archi-
tect for NetWeaver, SAP Solution Manager and 
pre-defined enterprise services that provide the 
pre-conditions to develop a well-documented and

SAP System Organization Structure Com-
ponents:
Company is a unit for which legal financial 
statements are created, while a Company Code 
is a legal entity within a company having external 
financial reporting obligation. There could be one 
or more company codes for a company. Normally 
each company code within a company uses the 
same chart of accounts. 
Funds Management area is a unit for disburse-
ment of funds, while a controlling area is where 
costs and revenues are collected. Then follow 
profit, cost, and business centers, which are used 
for internal purpose for creating balance sheets 
and income statements.
Plant is a production or a service providing 
entity. It could be referred as a storage location, 
shipping point, or work center. A plant may also 
have a warehouse for managing materials. Ware-
house in a plant allows segregation of materials 
by storage bins.  (Adapted from: ASAP Imple-
mentation Roadmap, 2006).
Enterprise Services are “a standards-based 
way of encapsulating enterprise functionality and 
exposing it as a reusable business service that can 
be combined with other services to meet new re-
quirements. Enterprise services, defined by SAP 
and its partners and customers, can be assembled 
together to compose new applications or enable 
new business processes.” (Source: Enterprise 
Services Wiki, Service Oriented Architecture) 
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a 
style of software architecture that uses services 
as the fundamental building blocks. SOA “A 
software architecture that supports the design, 
development, identification, and consumption 
of standardized services across the enterprise, 
thereby improving reusability of software com-
ponents and creating agility in responding to 
change.” (Source: industry term.) (Source: SDN 
Enterprise Services Wiki, Service Oriented Ar-
chitecture)
Service-Orientation describes an architec-
ture that uses loosely coupled services to support 
the requirements of business processes and users. 
SOA is a design for linking business and com-
putational resources (principally organizations, 
applications and data) on demand to achieve the 
desired results for service consumers (which can 
be end users or other services). A paradigm for 
organizing and utilizing distributed capabilities 
that may be under the control of different own-
ership domains. It provides a uniform means to 
offer, discover, interact with and use capabilities 
to produce desired effects consistent with mea-
surable preconditions and expectations. (Source:

Abstracta
This chapter introduces the key aspects of Free/Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning systems 
(FOS-ERP). Starting by related work carried out by researchers and practitioners, it argues in favor 
of the growing acceptance of this category of enterprise systems while showing how this subject is not 
yet well explored, especially by researchers. The goals of this chapter are to highlight the differences 
between FOS-ERP and their proprietary equivalents (P-ERP) in terms of business models, selection, 
customization, and evolution; and showing the challenges and opportunities that they offer to adopters, 
vendors, researchers, and individual collaborators. Therefore, this chapter tries to broaden the discus-
sion around the FOS-ERP subject, currently focused only in cost aspects, bringing more attention to 
other aspects and pointing out their innovative potential.
Inoduon
Free/Open Source1 ERP (FOS-ERP) systems are 
gaining a growing acceptance and consequently 
improving their market share. According to a 
recent market study, FOS-ERP related services 
would hit about US$ 36 billion by 2008 (LeClaire, 
2006). The reasons for this phenomenon are 
basically two: lower costs and free access to 
application’s source code. On the cost side, they 
impose reduced or no investment in licensing in 
general. On the access to code side stands the 
perception that if customization is inevitable, why 
not adopt a solution that exposes its code to the 
client company, which can freely adapt the system 
to its needs? Maybe this second reason is more 
complex and much less studied and is addressed 
in many topics later in the chapter.
Given this raising on FOS-ERP deployment, 
and the relative small number of references to 

  33
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning
this subject, instead of simply comparing func-
tionalities of various different solutions, this 
chapter aims to a) present tendencies on open 
source software in general and open source 
enterprise systems that directly influence on 
FOS-ERP, b) highlight the differences between 
FOS-ERP and proprietary ERP (P-ERP) in terms 
of business models, selection, customization and 
maintenance, and c) identify the challenges and 
opportunities that they offer to stakeholders and 
developer communities. 
Relaed
WORKo
While increasing in market importance, FOS-ERP 
is still poorly analyzed by academy, where large 
quantities of articles put their research efforts on 
P-ERP deployment, project management, and 
economic aspects (Botta-Genoulaz, Millet & 
Grabot, 2005). Research on FOS-ERP software is 
rather deficient, and, therefore, a series of relevant 
aspects of FOS-ERP, which differentiate them 
from P-ERP, are still not well understood. As an 
example of this situation, a research conducted 
on the FOS-ERP evaluation subject, has shown 
how evaluating FOS-ERP brings more concerns 
than evaluating P-ERP (De Carvalho, 2006). One 
indication that FOS-ERP seems to be another 
situation where technology has outstripped the 
conceptual hawsers, is the fact that, according 
to Kim and Boldyreff (Kim & Boldyreff, 2005), 
“by September 2005 only one paper about Open 
Source ERP (Smets-Solanes & De Carvalho, 
2003) has been published in the whole of ACM 
and IEEE Computer Society journals and pro-
ceedings, whereas more numerous articles have 
been published in non-academic industrial trade 
magazines.” Although nowadays more research 
work has been done on FOS-ERP, this subject is 
still a new one, with many topics to be explored 
and tendencies to be confirmed, since the num-
ber of adopters and the operation times are still 
small in relation to the P-ERP figures. In fact, 
FOS-ERP is a barely explored research subject. 
As said before, the first academic paper on this 
specific subject was Smets-Solanes & De Carvalho 
(2003); the first paper on evaluating FOS-ERP is 
De Carvalho (2006); and the first international 
event on FOS-ERP was held in Vienna, Austria, 
also in 20062. These facts show how FOS-ERP is 
a young research area, with relatively very little 
academic effort put on it until now.
However, some good work on related topics 
can be found. Currently the most in-depth analy-
sis of the economic impact of Free/Open Source 
Software (FOSS) in enterprise systems was the 
one conducted by Dreiling and colleagues (Dreil-
ing, Klaus, Rosemann & Wyssusek, 2005). The 
authors argue that “standards that supposedly 
open development by ensuring interoperability 
tend to be interpreted by enterprise systems global 
players according to their interest”. The authors 
follow this reasoning showing the deeper conse-
quences of this: “[global players interests] might 
be incongruent with the interests of the software 
industry at large, those of users organizations, and 
may also have effects on local and national econo-
mies.” And more: “despite control of interfaces 
and standards by few software developers, even 
integration of the information infrastructure of 
one single company with one brand of enterprise 
system cannot be consolidated over time [citing 
many other authors].” On the open standards 
subject, they conclude, “software engineering 
principles and open standards are necessary but 
not sufficient condition for enterprise software 
development becoming less constrained by the 
politics of global players, responsive to user inter-
ests, and for ensuring a healthy software industry 
that can cater for regional market.” 
On the innovation side, Dreiling and colleagues 
state that many economists agree to the point of 
dominant companies – like the ERP global play-
ers – are less disposed to respond to articulated 
customer requirements, and monopolies as well 
oligopolies tend to stifle product and service inno-
vation. Furthermore, “controlling architectures by 

34  
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning
means of proprietary software and open standards 
in the enterprise application industry appears 
to actually preclude innovation that could be of 
benefit for many users of enterprise systems”, 
which includes less developed economies. This 
seems to be a serious problem, since adapting is 
a crucial point to ERP, which by nature must be 
adapted to the adopter needs. This conclusion 
reinforces a positive consequence of the freedom 
of manipulating the source code by itself in FOS-
ERP: if the vendor changes its contract terms, the 
client company is not locked in to a particular 
solution supplier (Kooch, 2004). Additionally, 
can two competing companies derive a strategic 
differential using the same ERP? Although this 
problem can also happen with FOS-ERP, it seems 
to be bigger for P-ERP, since, due to the tightly 
control over source code, adaptations are limited 
to parameterization or high-cost functionality 
changes through Application Program Interfaces 
(APIs) or proprietary languages, restricting real 
differentiation and raising customization costs 
(De Carvalho, 2006). Therefore, if the fact that 
integration among processes can by itself becomes 
a source of competitive advantage (Caulliraux, 
Proença & Prado, 2000), this can be extrapolated 
to the possibility of changing source code to drive 
an even better advantage. 
If on one hand FOS-ERP can foster innova-
tion and give more power to adopters, on the 
other some important questions are yet to be 
answered, given that this type of FOSS is still a 
newcomer to the enterprise systems landscape. 
Even some enthusiasts recognize that FOS-ERP 
vendors service level have much to improve and 
gain experience, while in contrast, P-ERP have 
a mature network of consulting partners and a 
long history of success and failures (Serrano & 
Sarrieri, 2006). In fact, evaluating FOS-ERP for 
instance is a subject with only a few works on it. 
Herzog (2006) presents a very comprehensive 
approach that identifies three different methods 
for implementing a FOS-ERP solution - select a 
package, develop one by itself, and integrate best 
of breed solutions – and five criteria for evaluating 
alternatives: functional fit, flexibility, support, 
continuity, and maturity. This method introduces 
the interesting possibility, not yet well explored 
in practice, of integrating solutions from different 
vendors through Enterprise Application Integra-
tion (EAI) techniques. A successful case study on 
mixing P-ERP solutions is described by Alshawi 
and colleagues (Alshawi, Themistocleous & Al-
madani, 2004) – but the literature lacks examples 
on doing the same with FOS-ERP.
De Carvalho (2006) also presents an FOS-ERP 
evaluation method, named PIRCS, that holds some 
similarity with Herzog’s3, however stressing more 
on risk evaluation, given the strategic nature of 
ERP. In fact, according to Caulliraux and col-
leagues (Caulliraux, Proença & Prado, 2000) ERP 
is strategic, given that “it is a major commitment of 
money, and thus with long range implications even 
if only from a financial point of view”, and ERP 
systems are also important not only as a tangible 
asset, but “as a catalyst through their implementa-
tion in the formation of intangible assets and the 
company’s self-knowledge.” Aiming to include 
risk considerations, the PIRCS method seeks to 
identify weaknesses in the FOS-ERP’s develop-
ment environment during its evaluation process 
phases. These phases name the process, and are 
summarized as Prepare the evaluation process, 
Identify the alternatives, Rate alternatives’ attri-
butes, Compare alternatives’ results, and Select 
the one that best fits the adopter needs. 
Also related to the strategic nature of ERP, 
during PIRCS’ Preparation phase, the adopter 
must define its strategic positioning in relation to 
the product, behaving as a simple consumer, only 
getting the solution from the vendor, or becom-
ing a prosumer (Xu, 2003), by mixing passively 
purchasing commodity parts of the system with 
actively developing or customizing strategic ones 
by itself. Of course, choosing how to behave is not 
a simple decision in these cases, since it involves 
a series of demands like expertise on the FOS-
ERP platform and architecture, dealing with the 

  35
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning
developer community – which can mean manag-
ing demands of disparate stakeholders (West & 
O’Mahony, 2005), and allocating resources for 
development. It is a question of weighting the 
direct and indirect gains of developing parts of 
the system with the shortcomings of doing so.
Many other subjects related to open software 
in general that affect FOS-ERP should be ad-
dressed to better understand their dynamics. 
Crowston and Howison (2006) assess the health 
of Open Source communities as a way of helping 
checking if an FOSS is suitable for the adopter or 
contributor needs – this kind of assessment can 
be one of the tools to check a specific FOS-ERP 
project maturity. Assessing FOS-ERP communi-
ties means understanding other organizations’ 
behavior towards the project: since ERP in general 
are not for individual use, contributors most of 
times are companies’ employees, not free-lancers. 
Hence, to understand the differences between 
this and other types of open software, it is neces-
sary to understand how commercially sponsored 
and community built FOSS projects behave. 
According to West and O’Mahony (2005), one 
of the key moments of commercial FOSS is the 
start-up phase: when the project code is opened, 
“an infant community is presented with a large 
complex system that may be harder to decipher”, 
thus the FOS-ERP creator may have to wait until 
contributions from other firms become viable and 
also advantageous - the main economic incentive 
for firm participation is the emancipation from 
the price and license conditions imposed by large 
software companies (Wang and Chen, 2005), but 
the potential for doing such substitution must be 
only latent in the project. The same type of in-
centive is identified by Riehle (2007), who stats 
that solution providers can take advantage from 
open source software “because they increase 
profits through direct costs savings and the abil-
ity to reach more customers through improved 
pricing flexibility”. Other aspect on the vendor 
side identified by these authors is that opening 
the code can reduce the costs on software test-
ing and Research & Development tasks. These 
advantages are stimulating a better market accep-
tance, according to a Zinnov (2006) study, which, 
among other things, shows figures on the raising 
of venture capitalism participation and the higher 
penetration in the US enterprise systems market 
by open source solutions. Furthermore, Goth 
(2005) affirms that the open software market is 
on a “second wave” towards enterprise software, 
and that FOSS business models are finally ready 
for facing this new market challenge. These two 
last references points to a general improvement 
on the relation between FOSS communities and 
enterprise systems users.
	Despite the differences, FOS-ERP and P-
ERP certainly have one thing in common: both 
have a company behind their deployment activi-
ties. Although there exist FOS-ERP maintained 
almost solely by communities formed basically 
by individuals, like GNU Enterprise, it seems 
that only company-sponsored FOS-ERP, such as 
Compiere, ERP5, OpenMFG, and SQL Ledger, 
are really successful. In other words, FOS-ERP 
are typically of the commercial open source kind, 
which “a for-profit entity owns and develops”, ac-
cording to Riehle (2007) classification. The next 
topics show how FOS-ERP differs from P-ERP, 
present opportunities and challenges that this kind 
of software offer to developers and adopters, and 
finally drawn some conclusions on the subject.
DIFFEREffeenee
weenFOSS-ERPR 
and P-ERPR
The fact that FOS-ERP expose their code forces 
vendors and adopters processes to accommodate 
the consequence that customization and mainte-
nance can be done by other than the vendor. This 
fact means that the adopter is free to choose the 
participation level of the vendor in the different 
phases of the ERP life cycle – meaning that, at 
some extent, vendor participation can be also 
customized4. Analyzing the differences between 

36  
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning
open source and proprietary ERP depend on side 
of the commercial relation the organization is: 
adopter or vendor.
Differences for the Adopter
Selecting an ERP for adoption is a complex pro-
cess, because, besides the size of the task, it is 
an important enterprise component that impacts 
the adopter organization in financial and in self-
knowledge terms. Therefore, it is important to 
use a framework to understand how open source 
alternatives can impact this kind of project.
The Generalized Enterprise Reference Archi-
tecture and Methodology (GERAM) is a well-
known standard that provides a description of all 
elements recommended in enterprise engineering 
and a collection of tools and methods to perform 
enterprise design and change with success (IFIP 
– IFAC, 1999), providing a template life cycle 
to analyze FOS-ERP selection, deployment, 
and evolution. GERAM defines seven life-cycle 
phases for any enterprise entity that are pertinent 
during its life. These phases, presented on Figure 
1, can be summarized as follows:
a.	
Identi. cation: identifies the particular 
enterprise entity in terms of its domain and 
environment.
b.	
Concept: conceptualizes an entity’s mission, 
vision, values, strategies, and objectives.
c.	
Requirements: comprise a set of human, 
process, and technology oriented aspects and 
activities needed to describe the operational 
requirements of the enterprise. 
d.	
Design: models the enterprise entity and 
helps to understand the system functional-
ities.
e.	
Implementation: the design is transformed 
into real components. After tested and ap-
proved the system is released into opera-
tion.
f.	
Operation: is the actual use of the system, 
and includes user feedback that can drive 
to a new entity life cycle.
g.	
Decommission: represents the disposal of 
parts of the whole entity, after its successful 
use.
Except for decommission and identification, 
which are not influenced by licensing models, 
these phases can be used to better understand 
how FOS-ERP differs from P-ERP, providing 
key aspects for evaluating alternatives and suc-
cessively refining objectives, requirements and 
models, as next subtopics address.C
Concept
During this phase, high-level objectives are 
established, such as the acquisition strategy, 
preliminary time and cost baselines, and the 
expected impact of ERP adoption. In the case of 
FOS-ERP, the level of involvement of the adopter 
in development can be established. In other words, 
at this point the adopter can start considering the 
possibility of actively contributing to an open 
source project, becoming a prosumer. Of course,

this decision will be possible only during the 
more advanced phases, when the adopter better 
knows the solution requisites and the decision 
alternatives.R
Requirements and Preliminary 
Design
Taking as a principle that most software develop-
ment (and customization) today is done through 
interactive and incremental life cycles, it can 
be considered that there is no clear borderline 
between the requirements and preliminary de-
sign phases and between the detailed design and 
implementation phases, thus they are considered 
together in this analysis.
The requirements phase deals with system’s 
functional and non-functional requirements. The 
adopter may model some main business processes 
– part of the Preliminary Design – as a way to 
check how the alternatives fit to them. At this 
point FOS-ERP starts to differ more from P-ERP. 
Evaluating P-ERP involves comparing alterna-
tives under the light of functionality, Total Cost 
of Ownership (TCO), and technological criteria. 
For FOS-ERP these criteria and others related spe-
cifically to FOSS must be also taken into account 
– remembering that even if the implementation 
represents a smaller financial impact, in terms 
of a company’s self-knowledge it can assume a 
much bigger importance, since it holds not only 
a inventory of records and procedures, but also 
how those records and procedures are realized in 
technological form – through source code.
In other words, a FOS-ERP can have a smaller 
financial impact but a much bigger knowledge 
and innovation impact. Although P-ERP are also 
highly parameterized, and adaptable through 
APIs and/or dedicated programming languages, 
the access to the source code in FOS-ERP can 
drive much better exploration of the ERP’s capa-
bilities, thus allowing a better implementation of 
differentiated solutions. 
From this standpoint, the strategic positioning 
of an adopter in relation to a FOS-ERP seems 
to be of greatest importance, given the possibil-
ity of deriving competitive advantage from the 
source code. Therefore, the adopter must decide 
to behave as a simple consumer, only getting the 
solution from the vendor, or become a prosumer, 
by mixing passively purchasing commodity parts 
of the system with actively developing strate-
gic ones by itself. Thus it is clear that when an 
adopter considers FOS-ERP as an alternative, it 
should also consider developing parts of it to fit 
its requirements – taking into account that, as 
said before, this kind of positioning involves al-
locating managerial and technical resources for 
development tasks in a FOSS environment.
	
Detailed Design and ImplementationI
	
The detailed design phase focus on refining 
models, and is associated to business process 
modeling and parameter identification and value 
definition. The implementation phase concentrates 
on validating, integrating modules, and releasing 
its modules for initial use. 
If the adopter decided to participate actively 
in the selected FOS-ERP project, deeper design 
decisions are involved, such as creating entire 
new modules or extending the basic framework. 
A consequence of assuming a more active role is 
to invest more human and financial resources for 
learning the FOS-ERP platform and framework, 
developing and maintaining parts of it, and manag-
ing the relationship with the project community. 
In that case, customization and maintenance 
contracts must define responsibilities of each part 
on the deployment process. For instance, what the 
vendor should do if the adopter finds a bug in the 
original code, written by the first, which is being 
adapted by the second? What is the priority that 
the vendor must follow for correcting this bug? 
Actually, is the vendor responsible for correcting 
this bug, since for this part the adopter decided 
to take advantage of the solution’s free license, 

38  
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning
therefore exempting the vendor of responsibility 
for the bug?
The adopter has the option of assuming dif-
ferent grades of involvement for each phase. For 
ordinary modules, like payroll, the adopter can 
let the vendor do the work. However, for strategic 
modules, where the adopter believes that it holds 
competitive advantage in the related business 
processes, it can take an active role from detailed 
design to implementation and maintenance, to be 
sure that the business knowledge, or at least the 
more precious details that keep the competitive 
advantage, will be kept in the adopter company. 
In that situation the vendor is limited to act as 
a kind of advisor to the adopter. One can think 
that it is possible to keep secrecy on parts of the 
system by properly contracting a P-ERP vendor, 
which is true, but the adopter will become de-
pendent of the vendor in a strategic part of the 
system. Becoming dependent means to wait for 
other vendor’s priorities or pay a high price to 
become the priority when changes are needed. 
Even if the P-ERP adopter decides to develop 
these high-strategic parts, it will have to deal 
with licensing costs anyway.
A very interesting point is the openness of 
parts customized for and sponsored by a specific 
adopter. Maybe the adopter doesn’t want to be-
come a developer at all – which is most likely to 
happen, but it still wants to keep some tailored 
parts of the system in secret. In these cases, the 
vendor must adapt the licensing terms for its 
solution, so that general openness of the code is 
guaranteed, while some client-sponsored custom-
ized parts can be kept closed5.
Operation
	
During the operation phase the resources of 
the entity are managed and controlled so as to 
carry out the processes necessary for the entity 
to fulfill its mission. Deviations from goals and 
objectives or feedbacks from the environment 
may lead to requests for change; therefore dur-
ing this phase system maintenance and evolution 
occur. During operation the adopter can decide 
at any moment, unless contractual clauses hin-
ders, to shift to another vendor or to assume the 
system’s maintenance by itself. Minor changes 
can also be conducted by the own adopter or 
even by community individuals that may help 
on specific matters.
As a conclusive remark on the differences of 
FOS-ERP on the adopter side, experience has 
shown that most of the times the adopter will not 
get involved on customization or even mainte-
nance tasks. Still, FOS-ERP can be a good choice, 
since it reduces vendor dependency. Moreover, 
the openness of code on FOS-ERP also makes 
adapting it to specific needs easier, thus reducing 
costs in customization and further evolution of 
the software. In other words, the central points 
to consider are cost reduction and freedom of 
choice. Last but not least, as a general rule, FOS-
ERP also rely on other open technologies. For 
instance, while most P-ERP systems export and 
import data to and from MS-Office, FOS-ERP, 
like ERP5, interact with the also free Open Office. 
The same is truth for databases and operational 
systems – thus reducing licensing costs on ERP 
supportive software too.  
Differences for the Vendor
The FOS-ERP vendor business models are a 
consequence of the customer’s freedom of choice 
and of the general open source market character-
istics. Like in other types of FOSS, if on one hand 
vendors benefit from the community improve-
ments and testing work, on the other hand they 
face the competition of this community when 
dealing with deployment and maintenance. In 
fact, as previously shown, even an adopter can 
become a competitor, at some extent of course. It 
is important to note that there are three types of 
vendor: the original system creator, its partners, 
and free-lance vendors. In the case of partners, 
a formal, most of times contractual, agreement 

  39
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning
is set between them and the system creator. This 
agreement involves some responsibilities to the 
partner, in special, following creator’s deployment 
practices, communicating new business generated 
by the system, opening the source code of new 
and improved parts of the system, and helping in 
development tasks managed by the creator. Free-
lance vendors are free of these obligations, and as 
a consequence, have no special treatment by the 
creator, that expects that the free-lancer at least 
open the code of its own system improvements, 
following the general FOSS code of ethics6.
	Following the common reasoning about FOSS 
pricing, FOS-ERP vendors can take advantage 
from open source software because, according 
to Riehle (2007), FOSS “increase profits through 
direct costs savings and the ability to reach more 
customers through improved pricing flexibility”, 
as shown on Figure 2.
Figure 2 shows a situation that maybe is more 
applicable to partners and free-lance vendors of 
FOS-ERP, which can switch from more expensive 
proprietary software to less expensive open source 
software, thus potentially increasing their profit 
margin. The creator organization must know how 
to manage the community around the project, 
finding prospective partners, hiring individuals 
that become highly productive on the project 
whenever possible, and even trying to transform 
free-lancers into partners. Like their proprietary 
counterparts, FOS-ERP needs a network of part-
ners that can help on deployment projects where 
the creator has no conditions to be the main con-
tractor, and finding new markets and customers 
for the system. However, gathering contributors 
for a starting FOS-ERP project can be a hard task. 
As said before, ERP users are organizations, not 
individuals, and therefore the creator must learn 
how to attract partner firms that are willing to 
contributing to the project without becoming 
competitors. As a main conclusion, FOS-ERP 
vendors must fight hard to form a community 
around the project and to retain customers. This 
seems to be a big difference between the open 
and proprietary licensing models, since the risk 
of the vendor loose a client after deployment is

almost inexistent in the current P-ERP dominated 
market landscape, where global players dictate 
market rules in practice. 
	The differences between FOS-ERP and P-
ERP can led to a shift from the vendor-dominated 
perspective of P-ERP to a more customer-driven 
FOS-ERP perspective. These differences in con-
ducting selection, adoption, and selling also bring 
a series of opportunities and challenges for both 
vendors and adopters, which are addressed in the 
following topics.
OppoRTUNITIESune and
Challenge
FOS-ERP offer a series of opportunities for actors 
that are currently out or ill inserted into the ERP 
market. These opportunities come together with 
a series of challenges, as listed below.
For smaller consulting firms:
a.	
Opportunities: P-ERP vendors generally 
impose high costs and a rigid set of rules 
for firms that desire to enter their partner 
network, raising the difficulties for smaller 
firms to become players in this market. In 
contrast, smaller consulting firms can enter 
the FOS-ERP market in an incremental way, 
increasing their commitment to a project as 
new business opportunities appear and bring 
more financial income. In other words, firms 
can start contributing with small improve-
ments to the project as a way of gaining 
knowledge on the system platform and 
framework, and, as customers to the solu-
tion appears, more money can be invested 
on a growing commitment to the project. 
Additionally, with the raising of venture 
capitalism investment on FOSS startups, a 
smaller firm can even get financed in a way 
that would be very unlikely to happen if it 
worked on top of a P-ERP solution, given the 
restrictions imposed by the global players.
b.	
Challenges: If on one hand it is easier to 
enter the market, on the other it is harder 
to retain clients: a broader consultancy 
basis empowers the demand side, making 
customers more demanding.
	
Keeping quality level among a heterogeneous 
network of consulting services providers is also 
a major challenge. FOS-ERP in general lack 
certification and quality assurance programs that 
guarantee service levels to clients. Moreover, 
FOS-ERP skeptics argue that few reliable con-
sulting firms have experience on implementing 
them. But exactly those programs keep smaller 
consulting firms way from P-ERP, pushing them 
towards FOS-ERP. For a small consulting firm, a 
possible solution to this deadlock is to start with 
smaller, less demanding projects, and then go 
towards bigger ones, as the deployment processes 
and related activities gain maturity. This maturity 
will become the competitive advantage of the firm 
on a high competitive FOS-ERP market.
For smaller adopters:
a.	
Opportunities: lower costs open new op-
portunities for Small and Medium Enter-
prises (SME) to become ERP adopters. With 
globalization, small firms suffer more and 
more with competition, and when they try 
to modernize their processes, they hit the 
wall of global players’ high costs, or have 
to adopt smaller off-the-shelf (and also 
proprietary) solutions that ties them to a 
single supplier that normally doesn’t have a 
partner network. In contrast, FOS-ERP are 
less expensive and support can be found in 
different ways, including individuals and 
other SME. 
	
This is also truth for local governments 
and countries in development in general. 
FOS-ERP reduce costs, thus helping local 
governments focus on their core business 
– directly taking care of citizens – and 
reducing technological dependency from 

  41
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning
global players. In fact, FOSS in general is an 
opportunity for countries in development to 
shift from buyers to players in the software 
industry (Ouédraogo, 2005).
b.	
Challenges: lower costs can also mean that 
adopters have to deal with lower service 
levels, then stressing the necessity of care-
fully evaluating FOS-ERP options and the 
maturity of their supportive services. Actu-
ally, as said before, consulting certification 
is yet on the early stages for FOS-ERP, 
thus quality of service must be carefully 
addressed during contract negotiation.
For researchers:
a.	
Opportunities: The author has been con-
tributing to a FOS-ERP project7 since its 
conception. During this time it was possible 
to know deeply, and sometimes take part 
of, all the process that compose an ERP 
solution, from conception and development, 
to business models, deployment, operation 
and maintenance, and evolution. This is a 
really good opportunity, since most research 
papers on ERP are related to deployment 
and operation, given that P-ERP companies 
don’t usually open their projects’ internals 
for researchers. Smaller research groups can 
find their way in this area by getting associ-
ated to a FOS-ERP project, and contributing 
to specific parts of it.
b.	
Challenges8: If on one hand the openness 
of FOS-ERP may give researchers more 
information on their internal features and 
development processes, on the other hand it is 
harder to get information from a distributed 
set of partners that sometimes carry informal 
agreements. Social and economical aspects, 
like reward structures, must be taken into 
account to understand the dynamics of FOS-
ERP, like in every FOSS, bringing more 
components to be analyzed. 
For individuals:
a.	
Opportunities: FOS-ERP represent an 
unique opportunity for an individual to in-
stall an ERP framework and understand its 
internals. It is the chance of participating in a 
big software development project without be-
ing an employee of a big company (Spinellis, 
2006). Also, the developer can incrementally 
gain knowledge of the system, and get free 
support from the community, without the 
necessary investment on the P-ERP high 
cost training and certification programs. In 
that way an individual can improve his/her 
employability without investing too much 
money on courses, books and certifications. 
In the future, these advantages can make 
more free-lance developers enter FOS-ERP 
communities, currently formed mostly by 
companies’ employees.
b.	
Challenges: learning the internals of a FOSS 
in general means to spend considerable time 
in understanding system architecture, design 
decisions, and specific features. Moreover, 
FOS-ERP in special currently lack books and 
courseware in general to help accelerating 
the learning process, and many times the 
individual must count on Web sites, mailing 
lists, discussion forums, and the good will 
of community members to acquire deeper 
knowledge on the framework. 
	
Conluon
In this chapter Free/Open Source ERP particu-
larities, opportunities and challenges were briefly 
presented. It is important to note that this type of 
software inherits all advantages and shortcom-
ings of open source software in general and have 
some more of both. As a matter of fact, FOS-ERP 
two main advantages are both directly related 
to FOSS: lower TCO given the reduced or non-
existent licensing costs - including of supportive 
software, like spreadsheets, databases, network-

42  
Free and Open Source Enterprise Resources Planning
ing and operational systems; and the possibility of 
having direct access to the source code whenever 
is needed.
Nevertheless, despite the growing interest on 
this subject, it still has many topics to be explored 
by researchers and practitioners, given the short 
period of time that passed since this kind of soft-
ware appeared in the market and the relatively 
small number of users, which indicates that the 
list of opportunities and challenges aforesaid is 
a reflection of current tendencies that must be 
confirmed and better scrutinized as new deploy-
ments occur. For instance, currently there are no 
research figures on FOS-ERP success rates. In 
other words, in this arena, it is necessary that 
more data on deployment, customization, op-
eration, and evolution become available so that 
tendencies may be confirmed and can become 
facts and figures.
Hence, as a relatively new kind of software, 
FOS-ERP has a potential to be realized, but many 
questions about it are yet to be answered. Nev-
ertheless, their growing commercial acceptance 
is a fact, and their lower costs, easier adaptation, 
and potentially more competitive supplier market 
can slowly force a shift in the ERP market from 
the current vendor perspective to a customer 
perspective.

According to Xu (2003) it is possible to classify 
a software user company in accordance to its 
positioning in relation to a FOSS:
•	
Consumer: a passive role where the adopter 
will just use the software as it is, with no 
intention or capability of modifying or dis-
tributing the codes.
• 	
Prosumer: an active role where the adopter 
will report bugs, submit feature requests, 
post messages to lists. A more capable Pro-

and new features.
•	
Profitor: a passive role where the adopter will 
not participate in the development process

conditions in order to be considered open source 
licenses:
1.	
The software can be freely given away or 
sold. 
2.	
The source code must either be included or 
freely obtainable. 
3.	
Redistribution of modifications must be 
allowed.

open source.
10.	 License Must Be Technology-Neutral
The official definition of Open Source Software 
is very close to the definition of Free Software, 
however, it allows in practice more restrictive

The precise definitions of Free Software

are differences between them – the Free 
Software Movement has also some political

Despite the fact that these methods hold some

having knowledge of each other and were 
published in a very close range of time: 
Carvalho’s method was published in April 
and Herzog’s in June, 2006.

This is a generic assumption, since in practice 
the vendor can impose specific license terms 
that keep the software open, but constrain 
deployment to terms that keep vendor control 
on it.

Although this seems to be nonsense in FOSS 
terms, it is a common real life situation in

Business process modeling (BPM) is a topic that is generating much interest in the information tech-
nology (IT) industry today. Business analysts, process designers, system architects, software engineers, 
and systems consultants must understand the foundational concepts behind BPM and evolving modeling 
standards and technologies that have the potential to dramatically change the nature of phases of the 
systems development life cycle (SDLC). Pareto’s 80/20 rule, as applied to the SDLC, is in the process of 
being drastically altered. In the past, approximately 20 % of the SDLC was spent on analysis and design 
activities with the remaining 80 % spent on systems development and implementation (Weske, Goesmann, 
Holten, & Striemer, 1999). Today, with the introduction of the Business Process Management Initiative 
(BPMI), Web services, and the services-oriented architecture (SOA), the enterprise SDLC paradigm is 
poised for a dramatic shift.  In this new paradigm, approximately 80 % of the SDLC is spent on analy-
sis and design activities with the remaining 20 % spent of systems development and implementation. 
Once referred to as workflow and process automation, business process modeling (BPM) has evolved 
into a suite of interrelated components providing significant business value. Emerging BPM technolo-
gies will be the primary vehicle by which current application portfolios transition to service-oriented 
architectures and Web services (Aversano, & Canfora, 2002). Business Process Management Initiative’s 
Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) subgroup is currently finalizing a standardized notation 
for business process modeling. Although the notation is still in working draft format, system architects 
and designers should consider incorporating the concepts of BPM into their current and future systems 
analysis and design procedures.

The Changing Nature of Business Process Modeling
ITRCTI
Adaptive organizations want to be able to rapidly 
modify their business processes to changes in their 
business climate including competitive, market, 
economic, industry, regulatory/com­pliance, or other 
factors.  Meanwhile, enterprise architects within IT 
organizations have long dreamed of a repository 
for models that are interconnected and extend to 
support application delivery.  No single tool exists 
that enables enterprise architects to connect the 
dots between high-level models geared toward a 
business audience and executable code to instantiate 
the vision (Carlis, & Maguire, 2000).
BPM is both a business concept and an emerging 
technology.  The concept is to estab­lish goals, define 
a strategy, and set objectives for improving particular 
operational processes that have significant impact 
on corporate performance.  It does not imply re-
engineering all business processes; rather the focus 
is on business processes that directly affect some 
metric of corporate success.  Business performance 
management and measurement emphasize using 
metrics beyond financial ones to guide business 
process management strategies (Delphi, 2001). 
Metrics related to customer value or loyalty are 
examples.  Business process modeling is becoming 
the central point of organization for many sys­tems. 
BPM as a concept is not new; multiple process 
management methodologies such as Six Sigma 
and Lean Manufacturing have existed for years. 
However new BPM technologies are fueling a 
renewed interest in process thinking (Ettlinger, 
2002).  New BPM technologies promise busi-
ness modelers and managers a visual dashboard 
to manage and adjust, in real time, human and 
machine resources, as well as information being 
consumed as work progresses.  
The business and IT worlds are taking more 
strategic and holistic views of IT and how it sup-
ports the business.  IT strategy, business process 
improvement, and IT architecture are experienc-
ing a renaissance.  Enterprise architects have 
tackled the technical architecture effectively. 
Now, enterprise architects are looking to expand 
their efforts into the business architecture space. 
Enterprise business architecture is the expression 
of the enterprise’s key business strategies and 
their impact on business functions and processes 
(Adhikari, 2002b).  Business architecture efforts in 
most organizations are limited to thematic project-
level initiatives.  Thematic business architecture 
artifacts generally fail to evolve once the projects 
are complete because little perceived value exists 
for keeping business architecture content alive. 
However, emerging standards show promise in 
keeping business architecture and associated 
artifacts alive to serve as key business strategy 
enablers.  
The IT world is moving more toward a model of 
integrating pieces or components, versus building 
from scratch (Adhikari, 2002a).  Organizations 
are looking to strategically optimize, automate, 
and integrate key processes to provide seamless 
service to more demanding customers in a multi-
channel world.  To do this effectively, systems must 
be integrated at the process level as well as the 
data level.  Integrating systems at the process level 
has been a challenge which, when unmet, leads to 
data duplication and inconsistency and functional 
overlap (i.e., inefficient processes/processing) 
(Reingruber & Gregory, 1994).  Many organiza-
tions are embarking on process improvement 
exercises to increase organizational efficiency 
or effectiveness.  
These efforts go by many names, including 
industrial engineering, ISO certification, Six 
Sigma, enterprise business architecture (EBA), 
business process improvement (BPI), business 
process re-engineering (BPR), and lean think-
ing, to name a few.  Most of these techniques 
involve visual modeling to capture the current 
state and validate improved future-state design. 
Several notations exist for visual process modeling 
(e.g., event-driven process chains (EPCs), IDEF, 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI)); 
however, a new standard (BPMN) is emerging 
that promises to allow extension of visual models 

  47
The Changing Nature of Business Process Modeling
into executable script or source code (BPMI.org 
Releases.., 2005).  Although reminiscent of the 
promises of computer-aided software engineer-
ing (CASE) technologies, advances in the fields 
of mathematics and computer science make the 
“model to execute” vision more viable.  While 
notations and methods for process modeling and 
improvement within the business are mature and 
notations and methods for application delivery 
within IT are mature, business and IT process 
models and methods fail to align well with one 
another (Adhikari, 2002b).  
BPMN is mapped to Business Process Mod-
eling Language (BPML) and Business Process 
Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL-
4WS), thus any models created in a manner that 
is closely aligned with BPMN will automate 
more rapidly (Ewalt, 2002).  Business Process 
Query Language (BPQL) has been put forth 
by the Business Process Management Initia-
tive to process repositories as SQL is to data 
repositories.  Although currently in draft state, 
several concepts presented in BPMN should be 
considered for immediate adoption.  First and 
foremost is agreement on a standard notation and 
principles for process modeling.  A plethora of 
software vendors are incorporating support for 
BPML and BPEL4WS.  Modeling technologies 
are beginning to incorporate BPMN notation 
because it supports both BPML and BPEL4WS. 
Technical models (e.g., UML, entity relation-
ship diagrams) are being married with more 
business-oriented approaches (e.g., swim-lane 
diagrams, BPMN) to graphically narrow the 
business/IT alignment divide.  The outcome of 
these efforts is to incorporate, at a minimum, a 
recommended set of common guidelines into all 
modeling efforts organizationally and interorga-
nizationally (i.e., process integration with trading 
partners).  Organizations are moving to standard-
ize on an approach to process/business modeling 
and select common tools to support disparate but 
related improvement and change initiatives.  
Software tools have long been used to automate 
tasks and reduce manual interactions.  Thus, it 
is important to distinguish business processes 
from IT applications.  A business process is a 
sequence of activities performed by people and 
machines necessary to produce a desired result 
(Adhikari, 2002b).  It is initiated by the arrival of 
work (such as a phone call, faxed order, or timing 
event) which triggers the sequence of operational 
activities.  An application is a logical grouping of 
tasks automated by a computer with the objective 
of reducing or augmenting human interactions. 
Thus, an application is a subset of the tasks of a 
business process.  Many human-centric activities 
of a business process have largely been unauto-
mated (though some organizations use workflow 
automation to manage electronic work queues).  
A business process management suite (BPMS) 
is a new development environment that enables 
business users to collaborate with IT profession-
als in the design and development of optimized 
business processes (not applications), thus reduc-
ing the communication gap between business 
and IT.  Ideally a business process management 
suite supports a business process modeling en-
vironment that is shared by business analysts, 
process engineers, IT architects and program-
mers.  The modeling surface or palette exposes 
different capabilities to support each of these 
roles.  Unlike earlier code-generating tools, the 
modeling environment creates XML metadata 
that describes how application functionality and 
information and human activities should interact 
and be instantiated at runtime.  
The new runtime engines interpret the meta-
data at runtime (Mangan & Sadiq, 2002).  Increas-
ingly, vendors are endorsing Business Process 
Execution Language (BPEL) as the standard 
process description language.  Thus, changing a 
business process requires changing the graphical 
model, regenerating the metadata and redeploy-
ing process instances.  This is a much simpler 
and faster approach to changing how work gets 
done.  This faster rate of change to operational

best practices and the ability to change activi-
ties dynamically are what make an organization 
adaptive.  An adaptive organization can adjust its 
operational business processes in near real time 
to capitalize on opportunities, avoid threats, and 
maximize corporate performance.  
MODELING IMADNESS: SSA BriefBRI 
HISTR
 
Modeling has been taught in a variety of forms 
for years in university curriculums.  Models have 
long been a part of many technical curriculums, 
traditionally leveraging ANSI standard flow 
charts.  The technology field leveraged this ap-
proach to communicate logic flow prior to creation 
of machine executable code.  Some readers may 
remember those flimsy green flowchart templates 
provided by IBM.  As business and technol-
ogy continued to evolve, so too did the field of 
modeling.  Modeling tools were introduced to 
technology-enable modeling.  Spreadsheets were 
introduced as well.  To business purists, model-
ing became synonymous with financial modeling 
- a series of spreadsheets with what-if scenarios. 
To the IT world, modeling became synonymous 
with a host of visual techniques, including the 
following: 
•	
Entity relationship diagrams 
•	
ANSI standard flowcharts 
•	
Process models 
•	
Data flow diagrams 
•	
Unified Modeling Language (UML) dia-
grams (activity, class, etc.) 
•	
Network diagrams 
•	
CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) 
matrices 
•	
Integrated Definition (IDEF) charts  
•	
Engineering Process Control (EPC) charts
Models have been used as a mechanism to 
communicate a complex ecosystem.  Business-
oriented modeling approaches tend to focus on 
productivity and quality metrics (e.g., processing 
time, wait time, cycle time, cost, setup time, out-
puts, defects).  IT-oriented modeling approaches 
have properties that tend to focus on logic, business 
rules, and data elements.  Differences in model-
ing notations and rules around modeling have 
suboptimized the benefits of visual modeling.  A 
group of leading modeling tool vendors has joined 
forces to develop a common notation for business 
process modeling (BPMN) that can do much to 
optimize the potential of visual modeling (BPMI.
org Releases.., 2005).  This group is leveraging 
collective best practices of its organizations and 
currently has published Version 9 of its notation 
(www.bpmi.org).  
Although currently in working draft stage, 
some of its leading practices can and should be 
incorporated into all courses that utilize model-
ing.  There should be an expectation that visual 
business models help expose characteristics of 
the underlying business process.  For example, 
a business process related to entering purchase 
orders should be able to expose the underlying 
user interface for all data entry points of the 
process, as well as expose the underlying data 
tables related to the transac­tion.  At a higher 
level of abstraction, the business models should 
be linked to entity-­relationship diagrams as well, 
which highlight the overall table structure.  
A technique for process modeling popularized 
in the 1990s with the business process re-engi-
neering (BPR) rage, swim-lane diagrams, are 
near universally accepted among all who model. 
Often referred to as UML activity diagrams 
with lanes, the line-of-visibility method/tech-
nique (i.e., LOVEM - IBM’s process modeling 
methodology), or Rummler-Brache swim-lane 
diagrams, this modeling technique graphically 
denotes responsibility for work with vertical or 
horizontal lanes (i.e., lines of demarcation).  BPMN 
also incorporates the notion of pools, which can 
contain lanes, to relate external entities.  This 
is extremely important when moving toward a 

  49
The Changing Nature of Business Process Modeling
world of linking and automating processes with 
customers and suppliers (Aversano & Canfora, 
2002).  Incorporating pools and lanes enables 
responsibility to be recognized throughout the 
extended enterprise.  When appropriate, visual 
modeling must incorporate lanes and pools to 
clearly bound business areas and define or ar-
ticulate ownership and responsibility.  
UML is maintaining its popularity as the mod-
eling language of choice for software development. 
Object Management Group’s (OMG’s) Model 
Driven Architecture (MDA) is gaining traction, 
with the release of UML 2.0.  However, UML 
was originally designed by technical people for 
technical people.  OMG recognizes that UML does 
not provide a facility that actively addresses the 
needs of IT business modelers (Sadiq, Orlowska, 
Sadiq, & Foulger, 2004).  OMG is currently 
considering BPMI’s Business Process Modeling 
Notation (BPMN) to fill this void.  A merger, al-
liance, or convergence of the modeling standards 
efforts of OMG with those of BPMI would be a 
major advance for enterprise architecture.  Joining 
BPMN with UML would do much to minimize 
redundant questioning by IT organizations during 
the system development life cycle.  
One of the strengths of BPMN, and the 
languages it supports, is the ability to support 
more ambiguity.  Beyond process triggers and 
end states, events have been undermodeled by 
BPM teams.  Processes have events and trig-
gers.  BPMN distinguishes among beginning, 
intermediate, and ending events, as well as, 
events start, interrupt, and end the flow of the 
process.  Often, intermediate event information 
is buried in symbol properties or text annotations 
(BPMI.org Releases.., 2005).  BPMN provides 
for several types of events and the current event 
types are more comprehensive than most, if not 
all, modeling notations.  For example, one of the 
challenges with prior modeling notations and 
workflow systems is their inability to effectively 
contend with exceptions.  An BPMN error event 
symbol assists with meeting this challenge.  A 
compensate event exists to mirror roll-forward 
and roll-back conditions (i.e., two-phase commits). 
This is another event type that exists in the real 
world and has posed an artistic challenge to the 
modeling community.  
A distinction must be made between model-
ing and drawing business processes.  Modeling 
requires adherence to guidelines when depicting a 
process ecosystem graphically.  By adhering to ap-
propriate guidelines, process models can be used 
for simulation, refinement of existing processes, 
automation, and integration (Smith & Fingar, 
2003a).  Unless tied to a rigorous methodology 
or technology (e.g., workflow system), modelers 
have much discretion in modeling process flows. 
BPMN formalizes process flow gates to enable 
consistent modeling of forks, joins, and decisions. 
The notation’s standardization of these process 
patterns is elegant in its simplicity and is gaining 
wide acceptance.  B
BPMN ANDand
UML, conceived in 1996, was designed to pro-
vide a common modeling language to support 
software development.  It was adopted and refined 
by OMG and 21 member companies.  Since its 
inception, it has become the de facto standard for 
visual software development, spawning a host of 
new products to increase developer productivity 
and augmenting the functionality of existing 
modeling tools.  As UML and XMI (i.e., XML 
Metadata Interchange, a standard enabling UML 
model interchange) advanced, interoperability 
was made practical among tools traditionally 
used for business process modeling/enterprise 
architecture and those used for visual development 
environments (Carlson, 2001).  Further advances 
in UML enabled modeling of more complex 
software systems.  
UML, however, failed to provide the simplic-
ity needed by non-IT business modelers.  At best, 
a UML activity diagram could be created with 

50  
The Changing Nature of Business Process Modeling
swim lanes to provide the functional equivalence 
of swim-lane diagrams; however, adhering to 
UML standards might be overly burdensome to 
business modelers.  OMG recognizes this and is 
currently moving up the stack to provide the ap-
propriate level of standardized modeling language 
to enable business modelers to perform their 
needed tasks without undue effort.  BPMN has 
been mapped to the UML standard (Torchiano 
& Bruno, 2003).  
BPMN was developed to provide a common 
modeling notation to support a common process 
modeling language.  At the outset, BPMN was 
designed to appeal to both IT and non-IT modelers 
of business processes.  BPMN is gaining rapid 
acceptance; leading modeling-tool vendors sup-
port or plan to support BPMN (Smith & Fingar, 
2004).  This feat is accomplished by providing 
simple swim-lane diagramming ability to non-IT 
modelers and enabling the subsequent addition of 
technical detail to the same models as notational 
properties (i.e., the gory details are hidden from 
the non-technical audiences within the tool).  
If BPMN is accepted into UML, even in part, 
BPMI’s efforts will be further legitimized.  At 
present, much flux exists in the process model-
ing language space.  Two languages, BPML and 
BPEL4WS, were viewed as competitors running 
a head-and-neck race for market acceptance. 
However, the broader vision of BPMI is to have 
a common modeling notation that generates a 
process modeling language that can be stored in 
a process management system, used to manage 
automated process change within and between 
organizations .  If OMG adopts BPMN, even in 
part, the likelihood of BPMN as the notational 
support for BPEL4WS dramatically increases.  
Long has been the vision of a modeled enter-
prise that maintains linkages from the conceptual 
business leaders to the operations.  However, due 
to lack of standards and insufficient tool support, 
this vision has remained out of sight until now.  As 
developers adopt service-oriented architectures, 
they will continue to rely on UML.  As enterprise 
architecture continues to evolve to include enter-
prise business architecture, enterprise architecture 
modeling will expand to include business model-
ing.  If BPMN is incorporated into UML, simple 
business process models can rapidly be extended 
to generate BPML, BPEL4WS, or additional UML 
diagrams to extend down the MDA stack (Frankel, 
2003).  The vision of an enterprise repository of 
accurate models becomes reality as UML and 
MDA enable automation with insurance against 
technology obsolescence.  
A NEW PARARDIGM IFOR PROCESSRRCSS  
MODELINGI
With the introduction of BPMI, Web services, 
and the services-oriented architecture (SOA), 
the enterprise SDLC paradigm is poised for a 
dramatic shift.  An SOA is dynamic, general-
purpose, extensible, federated interoperability 
architec­ture.  Designing for SOA involves thinking 
of the parts of a given system as a set of relatively 
autonomous services, each of which is (potentially) 
independently managed and implemented and they 
are linked together with a set of agreements and 
protocols into a federated structure (Clark, Fletcher, 
Hanson, Irani, & Thelin, 2002).  A composite ap-
plication (i.e., based on SOA principles) is made of 
relatively autonomous services, each of which is 
(potentially) independently managed and imple-
mented.  These services are linked together with 
a set of agreements and protocols into a federated 
structure.  For enterprise application architects and 
developers, composite applications will be based 
on the SOA principles of dynamic, extensible, and 
federated interoperability and will be enabled by 
XML-based technologies such as Web services 
(Shegalov, Gillmann, & Weikum, 2001).  
Mobile calculi, process algebras, and pi

importance to lines of business, IT professionals,

modeling and management systems.  Pi calculus 
systems are evolving to become the new wave of 
software infrastructure to manage business pro-
cesses (Smith & Fingar, 2003b).  These systems are 
being front-ended by BPMN.  Enterprise business 
architects are embracing BPMN because it brings 
life and longevity to their modeling exercises.  
Pi calculus systems are becoming prevalent, 
supported by BPMN.  With the advent of third-
generation languages (3GLs), application develop-
ers adopted a paradigm that was procedural and 
deterministic.  This paradigm can be expressed 
with a form of mathematics known as lambda 
calculus.  3GLs tended to be sequential in nature, 
lending themselves to rigid codification of busi-
ness activity.  Pi calculus, providing a paradigm 
that is parallel, non-deterministic, and tolerant of 
change and ambiguity, enables systems to more 
closely resemble real life.  Pi calculus enables 
systems to treat “things” as processes and rela-
tionships.  It changes the programming paradigm 
from procedural and deterministic to one of inter-
related processes (Smith & Fingar, 2003b).  
This shift in thinking enables relationships 
and processes to be automated in a manner that 
more closely resembles natural workflow (and in 
fact, how computers work at the machine level). 
Ironically, computers, at the machine level, are 
well suited for a pi calculus paradigm; machine 
language, which manipulates operands within a 
computer’s memory location based on the opera-
tor selected, atomically resembles a pi calculus 
paradigm (Smith & Fingar, 2004).  BPML is 
a pi calculus-based standard text language to 
define and automate processes developed by 
the Business Process Management Initiative. 
BPEL4WS a pi calculus-­based standard language 
for automating business processes as Web ser-
vices.  This standard was jointly developed by 
Microsoft and IBM.
Enterprise Business Architecture (EBA) is a 
creative process of future-state design of business 
processes, functions, and organizations.  Business 
architects rely heavily on visual modeling to refine 
future-state design.  Selected future-state busi-
ness design must be implemented, which usually 
includes a certain degree of automation.  One of 
the challenges of EBA has always been keeping 
models alive through the system development life 
cycle (including maintenance and enhancement) 
(Smith, 2003).  However, with BPMN, keeping 
the models current is critical to keeping the un-
derlying BPMS functioning.  Also with BPMN, 
the underlying pi supports simulation, an art 
returning to popularity within businesses.  
The Business Process Management Initiative 
(BPMI) formed a subgroup to develop a notation 
to front-end its pi calculus-based language, BPML. 
The BPMN subgroup recognized three important 
things.  First, modeling notations needed to exist 
that were interpretable to business audiences and 
could subsequently be used by solution delivery 
specialists; the BPMN subgroup chose a tiered 
approach, with the first tier resembling swim-lane 
diagrams.  Second, a more detailed visual model-
ing notation needed to exist for system delivery; 
BPMN’s tiered approach maps the swim-lane-like 
business process modeling notation to a more 
precise technical notation. Third, the BPMN 
subgroup recognized that BPML and BPEL4WS 
could merge/converge or coexist, or BPML could 
be replaced by BPEL4WS; the BPMI proactively 
chose to map its visual notation to both BPML 
and BPEL4WS.  Business architects and technolo-
gists can design models with the top-tier notation 
with business leaders, easily passing the baton to 
delivery specialists after a decision to proceed 
is made with little or no rework (Delphi, 2001). 
BPMN enables changing of the visual notation per 
audience without losing the requisite values/prop-
erties/attributes necessary to extend to executable 
process language.  This critical functionality was 
lacking or less robust in previous attempts to 
standardize on a notation-to-execute modeling 
approach (Smith & Fingar, 2003a).

tomation technology as a departmental workflow

The Changing Nature of Business Process Modeling
a planned approach for implementing processes 
centered on enterprise business strategy.  Using 
this new paradigm, and associated technologies, 
to orchestrate and execute these processes enables 
organizations to move beyond simple automation 
to business process optimization. Workflow, 
process automation, and business process man-
agement tools and technologies will evolve into 
fully integrated BPM suites in the near future. 
BPM suites will be the primary vehicle by which 
current application portfolios are transitioned to 
service-oriented architectures.  Emerging BPM 
suites will include the following integrated com-
ponents (Smith & Fingar, 2004):
•	
Process modeling: This component pro-
vides a graphical tool for modeling business 
processes in the “as is” and “to be” states. 
Models can also be tailored to depict best 
practices for exception handling or be pre-
packaged to reflect vertical industry-spe-
cific needs.  The visual representation used 
(e.g., swim lane diagrams, UML models) 
increasingly must enable a business user 
(not a developer) to model the process from 
a business perspective, not a programming 
perspective.  
•	
Process improvement methodology: Align-
ing the enterprise business strategy with a 
process improvement program is a critical 
success factor for process improvement. 
Many modeling tools have incorporated 
support for business-oriented improve-
ment methodologies (e.g., Six Sigma, Lean 
Thinking, business process integration and 
management, balanced scorecards).  
•	
Process orchestration engine: A process 
orchestration engine (POE) takes runtime 
instructions from a process model.  These 
engines have been fairly proprietary to date. 
Many are migrating to support emerging 
description and execution standards (e.g., 
BPML, BPEL4WS), yet few of these are 
commercially available.  Engines must 
understand the modeling language and be 
able to track the progress of a process (in 
other words, manage state).  State manage-
ment directly impacts how long-running the 
process can be managed.  
•	
Integration servers: These tools bind the 
abstracted business process to the data, docu-
ments, business logic, messages, and events 
needed by the process.  Adapters connect the 
Integration server under the orchestration 
engine controller to structured data and logic 
in the underlying applications, unstructured 
data from the content management environ-
ment, search terms from a taxonomy library, 
and messages/events from message queue 
managers.  
•	
Process monitoring and analysis: Products 
in this category are some of the newest, 
thus there is significant variation in their 
capabilities.  The primary function of these 
tools is to enable the analysis of live data 
as it moves through the process.  There 
are two aspects to this real-time activity 
monitoring and analysis; 1) analysis of the 
process itself for optimal design (complete-
ness and bottlenecks); and 2) monitoring of 
the performance of the operational process 
for predefined key performance indicators 
(KPIs) and notifying users of out-of-toler-
ance limits.  This provides the opportunity 
to define and initiate corrective actions, 
including transactions.
•	
Process simulation/optimization: These 
tools are used to simulate the business pro-
cess through multiple options, discovering 
bottlenecks and creating alternatives.  Al-
lowing the analytics captured above to be 
used as input into the simulation creates a 
more efficient process (via both design and 
runtime feedback).  Some products allow a 
process to be simulated against production 
conditions to provide feedback.

The Changing Nature of Business Process Modeling
PROCESS MRCSSODELING I
C ALLENGESS
Many organizations are seeking new methods for 
developing software and system automation.  The 
convergence of Web services (promising univer-
sal connectivity) and model-driven development 
and architectures (promising technology-neutral 
system development) paints a compelling vision 
of the future of systems design and development. 
This future will be process-oriented, with sys-
tems created by using a process model to direct 
the interaction of various systems and human 
actors.  The systems will be accessible, since 
their functions are exposed as services, and the 
process engine will be sophisticated enough to 
capture all the semantics of the business process 
at various levels (O’riordan, 2002).  
Currently, most organizations use business 
process automation in discrete areas, primarily as 
part of their integration environments.  Leading 
organizations will enable process development 
across organizational boundaries, but most will 
struggle with the business (rather than technologi-
cal) issues associated with these activities.  The 
process model is becoming a standard part of the 
developer toolkit and standards-based engines will 
shortly replace proprietary ones.  Many organiza-
tions have this future vision, particularly those 
that are adopting service-oriented architectures. 
However, IT organizations struggle with how 
to advance this vision incrementally, due to the 
many challenges of the interim states.  
The first roadblock organizations encounter 
on the path toward business process management 
is its basic value proposition.  Although many 
projects using BPM tools have shown significant 
value (in terms of ROI), much of that value comes 
from the automation of manual processes.  These 
processes, typically those that span organizational 
boundaries, involve manual touches to informa-
tion and manual decision making that are not 
tracked through the formal automation systems 
embodied in the enterprise applications.  The sim-
plest means of creating value in this circumstance 
is to use process automation to automate these 
manual processes and their interfaces to enterprise 
applications and systems (Sharp & Mcdermott, 
2001).  This is useful, since it creates automation 
for manual tasks, and often will significantly re-
duce the costs and errors inherent in those tasks. 
However, the scope of this automation is clearly 
not the complete process, but only that portion of 
it that is reflected in these manual steps.  
Even in this limited scope case, there can be 
significant challenges.  The manual processes 
often are developed to address exceptions and 
inconsistencies in the formalized processes em-
bodied in the enterprise application portfolio. 
These processes often are either incomplete as 
implemented, or the business activities have 
changed yet the process assumptions on which 
the enterprise systems are based have not.  In 
either case, one finds a situation where the manual 
parts of the process often are undefined or do not 
have clear rules, roles, or responsibilities.  They 
may even contradict logic that is embodied in the 
formal systems.  The BPM exercise will highlight 
the weaknesses for interaction in the existing 
model (Ettlinger, 2002).  Furthermore, many 
of the manual parts of the process will retain 
manual components, since they primarily focus 
on exception handling.  
Compounding this issue is the challenge of the 
ownership and stewardship of business processes. 
Unless an organization has taken an aggressive, 
process-oriented view toward its business, there 
often is a tremendous amount of confusion about 
process definition and ownership (Adhikari, 
2002b).  Because the processes whose automation 
can provide the most value often span functional 
areas, there are usually no individuals with re-
sponsibility for the overall process.  Instead, we 
have functional managers, each with individual 
responsibility for the subprocess performed by 
their areas.  Effectively automating these pro-
cesses requires the creation of new channels of 
communication as well as new decision processes 

54  
The Changing Nature of Business Process Modeling
to enable the organizations involved to reach an 
agreement on how to handle the processes.  
Another issue affecting the achievement of 
this vision is that Web services are not complete. 
Although substantial progress is being made re-
garding the standards for and interoperability of 
Web services, the practical use of Web services 
within corporations is in its early stages (Charfi 
& Mezini, 2004).  The universal connectivity 
that is required to link a process execution en-
gine with the various actors and systems in the 
environment requires a substantial investment 
in integration technologies, and the minimal 
integration among various components in the 
infrastructure demands a substantial investment 
in the software platform.  There is little doubt 
that creating business process models, deriving 
application code from those business models, 
and monitoring such models can create the 
right level of organizational linkage between 
IT and business executives. The problem is that 
much of this is an afterthought in a world that 
contains a collection of ERR best-in-class, and 
legacy applications that are either unmodeled 
or modeled with multiple tools.
C NCLUSIONCSI
Business process modeling is quickly becoming 
the central point of organization for many sys-
tems.  Model-driven development frameworks 
are quickly becoming the preferred platform 
for service-oriented architecture, Web services 
composite application design, development, and 
deployment (Smith & Fingar, 2004).  Business-
user-oriented modeling environments enable 
businesspeople to model the process as if it were 
an assembly line of swappable components (tasks) 
that can be reordered to achieve various results.  A 
business process management suite exposes these 
components as XML Web services.  Business 
Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) will offer 
a common standard for enterprise process model-
ing that has the potential to make the “model to 
execute” vision more viable.  Business analysts, 
process designers, system architects, software 
engineers, and systems consultants that utilize 
process modeling should begin their evaluation 
and adoption of emerging business process man-
agement suites that utilize BPMN.  
These IT professionals must understand foun-
dational BPM concepts as well as the emerging 
technologies and standards that enable these 
concepts.  With this foundation, they will be 
able to better assess the importance of business 
agility, better perform business process perfor-
mance analysis, and model business process and 
systems in a manner that expedites development. 
More than technology, becoming an adaptive 
organization requires leadership and change 
management.  The cross-boundary characteristic 
of BPM initiatives creates a unique opportunity 
for the leaders of the initiatives to become the 
enterprise change agents.
Corporations are beginning the transformation 
to a process culture and the implementation of 
business process management methodologies and 
technologies (Smith, 2003).  The first steps can be 
problematic and political, even within organiza-
tions that have already committed to transforming 
to a process culture.  Organizations are looking 
to strategically optimize, automate, and integrate 
key pro­cesses to provide seamless service to more 
demanding customers in a multi-chan­nel world. 
To do this effectively, systems must be integrated 
at the process level as well as the data level (Sim-
sion, 2000).  This environment requires system 
architects, consultants, analysts, integrators, and 
developers that have an organizational perspective 
and a diversified set of skills.  R

In the age of globalization, organizations all over the world are giving more significance to strategy 
and planning to get an edge in the competition. This chapter discusses the Enterprise Resurce Planning 
(ERP) systems effects and strategic perspectives in  organizations. These are significant how informa-
tion technology and ERP together facilitate in aligning the business in such a way so that it should lead 
to excellent productivity. It further explores in what ways effects of  ERP system in organizations can 
provide sustained competitive advantage. I
IntroductionTRCTI
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software is 
one of the fastest growing segments of business 
computing today (Luo and Strong, 2004) and 
ERPs are one of the most significant business 
software investments being made in this new 
era (Beard and Sumner, 2004). Davenport (1998) 
has declared  that ‘the business worlds’s embrace 
of enterprise systems may in fact be the most 
important development in the corporate use of 
information technology in the 1990’s. Mabert et 
al. (2001) noted that industry reports suggests 
as many as 30,000 companies worldwide have 
implemented ERP systems. According to a report 
by Advanced Manufacturing Research, the ERP 
software market is expected to grow from $ 21 
billion in 2002 to $ 31 billion in 2006 and the en-
tire enterprise applications market which includes 
Customer Relationship Management and Supply 
Chain Management software will top $ 70 billion 
(AM Research, 2002). Further, AMR Research 

58  
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems 
has projected as much as $ 10 billion in global 
investments in ERP (as cited in Kalling, 2003). The 
ERP market is projected to grow from a current 
$15 billion to $ 50 billion in the next five years and 
to reach $ 1 trillion by 2010 (Bingi et al., 1999). 
ERP systems offer the advantage of providing 
organizations with a single, integrated software 
system linking the core business activities such 
as oprations, manufacturing, sales, accounting, 
human resources, and inventory control (Lee and 
Lee, 2000; Newell et al., 2003; Shanks and Seddon, 
2000). According to Brown and Vessey (2003) 
this integrated perspective may be the first true 
organization-wide view available to management. 
According to Lee and Myers (2004) much of the 
literature on ERP implementation suggests that 
ERP systems should support  the strategic objec-
tives of the organization. They observed that some 
ERP vendors tend to assume that implementing 
their products is a straightforward translation from 
strategy to IT-enabled business processes.                     
ERP helps organizations to meet the challenges 
of globalization with a comprehensive, integrated 
application suite that includes next-generation 
analytics, human capital management, financials, 
operations, and corporate services. With sup-
port for industry-specific best practices, ERP 
helps organizations improve productivity, sense 
and respond to market changes, and implement 
new business strategies to develop and maintain 
a competitive edge. ERP is designed to help 
businesses succeed in the global marketplace 
by supporting international legal and financial 
compliance issues and enabling organizations to 
adapt internal operations and business processes 
to meet country-specific needs. As a result, orga-
nizations can focus on improving productivity and 
serving their customers instead of struggling to 
ensure they are in compliance with business and 
legal requirements around the world. Companies 
that automate and streamline workflows across 
multiple sites (including suppliers, partners, and 
manufacturing sites) produced 66% more im-
provement in reducing total time from order to 
delivery, according to Aberdeen’s 2007 study of 
the role of ERP in globalization. Those companies 
that coordinate and collaborate between multiple 
sites, operating as a vertically integrated organi-
zation, have achieved more than a 10% gain in 
global market share. The majority of companies 
studied (79%) view global markets as a growth 
opportunity, but of those companies, half are also 
feeling pressures to reduce costs (Jutras, 2007). 
Those companies that coordinate and collaborate 
between multiple sites, operating as a vertically 
integrated organization, have achieved more than 
a 10% gain in global market share (Marketwire, 
2007).
INFORMATIORTIN TECHTCNOLOGY AND 
STRTIS
Inspite of lots of literature and guidance available 
less than 10% of strategies effectively formulated 
are effectively executed (Kaplan and Norton, 
1996). Mintzberg (1992) defined strategy as “ a 
plan –some sort of consciously intended course 
of action, a guideline (or set of guidelines) to 
deal with a situation. He further tried to define 
strategy from the perspectives of being a plan, 
a ploy, a position, a pattern, and a perspective 
(Ikavalko, and Aaltonen, 2001). Michael Porter’s 
(1996) definition of strategy focuses more on the 
outcome, “the creation of a unique and valuable 
position, involving a different set of activities”. 
He believes that a strategy is a  way an organiza-
tion seeks to achieve its vision and mission and 
that a successful strategy allows a company to 
capture and sustain a competitive advantage. 
Porter’s (1985) value chain methodology identified 
five key forces that impact on an organization’s 
competitive position:
•	
The bargaining power of suppliers;
•	
The bargaining power of buyer;

  59
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems 
•	
The threat of new entrants;
•	
The threat of substitute products; and
•	
Rivalry among existing organizations.
He believed that the impact of these forces 
could be influenced by strategies that focused on 
low cost provider and on product differentiation. 
These strategies determine how various discrete 
activities are performed to add value and eventu-
ally a competitive advantage. An organization’s 
activities can be categorised into primary activities 
that can directly add value and supporting activi-
ties. These interrelated activities make up Porter’s 
Value Chain. One of the supporting activities he 
identified was the technology development. Porter 
and Miller (1985) proposed an information inten-
sity matrix to assist in identifying where informa-
tion technology could be used strategically in the 
Value Chain. Later on Somogyi and Galliers (1987) 
supported this by identifying how information 
technology could be used to assist organizations to 
accomplish competitive advantage in the various 
focuses across the Value Chain. During last two 
decades organizations have already identified the 
significance of information technology in achieve-
ment of strategic objectives. Scott Morton (1991) 
identified five interrelated factors (Structure, 
Strategy, Technology, Management Processes, 
Individual & Roles) that influence the attainment 
of strategic objectives. One of these factors was 
information technology. A recent survey of more 
than 300 CEO’s and CIO’s identified  the align-
ment of IT and business strategy as their number 
one priority (Beal, 2003). Tallon and Kraemer 
(2003) in a survey of 63 companies found there 
was significant value gained from the alignment 
of these strategies.  Broadbent and Weill (1993) 
define this IT-business alignment as the extent 
to which business strategies were enabled, sup-
ported, and stimulated by information strategies. 
Teo and King (1997) proposed four different 
scenarios or degrees of integration between the 
business and IT strategies. These included:
•	
Administrative integration: Where there 
is little relationship between the business 
and IT strategy.
•	
Sequential integration: Where the business 
strategy is developed in firstly in isolation to 
the IT strategy. The IT strategy is then de-
veloped to support the business strategy.
•	
Reciprocal integration: This is where a 
reciprocal and interdependent relationship 
exists between both strategies. The IT strat-
egy is used to support the influence business 
strategy.
•	
Full integration: Occurs when both strat-
egies are developed concurrently in an 
integrated manner.
This increased need for closer alignment has 
resulted in companies focussing on Strategic 
Information Systems Planning (SISP) and the 
development of  methodologies to support this 
(Pant and Hsu, 1995; Hackney et al, 2000). 
Hackney et al. (2000) identified the assumptions 
which underlie SISP and discuss their validity. 
According to them main assumption are:
•	
Business srategies must exist as a precursor 
to SISP,
•	
Business strategies are different from IT,
•	
IT and Business strategies can be aligned.
They further argue that as business strategies 
evolve, it is often difficult for IT strategies to 
respond.
ERP ARND CORPORATECRRT 
STRTIS
ERP systems are widely adopted in a diverse range 
of organizations and define the business model 
on which they operate. For many organizations 
they were relieved that ERP system could help 
them define a business srategy and provide the 

60  
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems 
IT infrastructure to support it (Davenport, 2000). 
Hackney et al. (2000) believe that ERP systems 
can provide a “dynamic stability” to the align-
ment of business and IT strategies. These systems 
can provide a stable predictable environment of 
which their usage can evolve in accordance with 
a company’s business strategy. Brancheau et al. 
(1996) observed that alignment of an informaion 
system (IS) with the strategic goals and opera-
tional objectives of an organization has been an 
important issue through the 1980s and 1990s. ERP 
research has exlpored how these types of systems 
contribute value to an organization (Markus and 
Tanis, 1999; Ross and Vitale, 2000; Somers and 
Nelson, 2001), as well as how they should be integ-
rated with already-existing IT resources (Hayman, 
2000). Large and small organization’s continue to 
invest between $ 300,000 and hundreds of millions 
of dollars in ERP software and accompanying 
hardware (Markus, 1999). Different business 
justifications, including improved productivity, 
reduced costs, greater operational efficiency, 
enhanced customer relationship management, 
and better supply chain management (Brown 
and Vessey, 2003; Mabert et al, 2001). Finally, for 
the return on investment in ERP systems to be 
achieved, these systems should yield a strategic 
advantage. Kalling (2003) argues whether ERP 
systems provide a competitive advantage. Cur-
rent perceptions of ERP systems, as evidenced 
in trade publications and the academic literature, 
emphasize their role in enhancing economic ef-
ficiency and improving financial performance 
(Dillard and Yuthas, 2006).
Beard and Sumner (2004) observed that re-
garding competitive advantage one challenge is 
that ERP systems impose a ‘common systems’ 
approach by establishing a common set of applica-
tions supporting business operations. Successful 
implementation of an ERP system requires re-en-
gineering business processes to better align with 
the ERP software, so that the common systems 
approach is imposed (Brown and Vessey, 2003; 
Dahlen and Elfsson, 1999). This ‘common’ stru-
cture approach allows for faster implementation 
of the ERP system because there are fewer cus-
tomized pieces to the software and the limited 
customization means that it will be simpler to 
upgrade the ERP software as new versions and 
features emerge over time (Beard and Sumner, 
2004). Another challenge related with accomp-
lishing a competitive advantage through ERP is 
the significant complexity of the implementation 
and integration process as it often takes several 
years to fully implement the ERP system. This 
includes integrating ERP with already-existing 
IS and accomplishing the related reengineering 
of the organization (Beard and Sumner, 2004). It 
is time consuming process to refine the alignment 
of organization to the ERP system and to more 
fully leverage the opportunities offered by the 
ERP system .                      
As ERP provides both tangible and intangible 
benefits, many organizations consider them as 
essential information system infrastructure to be 
competitive in today’s business world and provide 
a foundation for future growth. A recent survey of 
800 top U.S. companies showed that ERP systems 
accounted for 43% of these companies budgets 
(Somer & Nelson, 2001). The market segment of 
ERP systems varies considerably from industry 
to industry. According to  Computer Economics 
Inc. Report 76% of manufacturers, 35% of insu-
rance and health companies, and 24% of Federal 
Government agencies already have an ERP system 
or are in the process of installing one (Stedman, 
1999). The global market for ERP software, which 
was $ 16.6 billion in 1998, is expected to have 
had 300 billion dollars spent over last decade 
(Carlino, 1999). There are number of vendors of 
ERP systems in the market although major one 
is SAP with approximately 56% of the market. In 
Australia 9 out of the top 12 IT users were SAP 
customers and 45% of the total list were also SAP 
users (BRW, 2002). Growth in ERP systems is 
due to several factors for example; the need to 
streamline and improve business processes, better 
manage information system expenditure, compe-

titive pressures to become a low cost producer, 
increased responsiveness to customers and their 
needs, integrate business processes, provide a 
common platform and better data visibility, and 
as a strategic tool for the move towards e-com-
merce (Davenport et al. 2003; Markus et al., 2001; 
Somer et al., 2001).
ERP SYSTEM ARSSTND STRATEGICSTRTIC  
ADVANTATGE 
 
Davenport (2000) believes that ERP systems by 
their very nature impact on a organization’s strat-
egy, organization and culture. Mabert et al. (2001) 
report that companies view the standardization 
and integration of business processes across the 
enterprise as a key benefit. As one of the executives 
mentioned ‘ERP is the digital nerve system that 
connects the processes across the organization 
and transmits the impact of an event happening 
in one part to the rest accurately’ (Mabert et al. , 
2001). Regarding tangible benefits, the companies 
often observed reported lower inventories, shorter 
delivery cycles, and shorter financial closing 
cycles although, the ERP system did not lead to 
reductions in work force or savings in operational 
costs in the short term (Beard and Sumner, 2004). 
According to Davenport (2000) cycle time reduc-
tion (e.g. cost and time reductions in key business 
processes), faster information transactions (e.g. 
faster credit checks), better financial management 
(e.g. shorter financial closing cycle, improved 
management reporting), and laying the ground 
work for electronic commerce (e.g. providing 
the back office functions for Web-based product 
ordering, tracking, and delivery processes), as 
well as a better understanding of key business 
processes and decision rules are general benefits 
of ERP systems. Laughlin (1999) suggests that 
the business justification for ERP includes both 
hard dollar savings (e.g. reductions in procure-
ment cost, inventory, transportation, increased 
manufacturing throughput, and productivity) and 
soft dollar savings (e.g. revenue growth, margin 
enhancement, and sales improvements). Inter-
estingly both Mabert et al. (2001) and Laughlin 
(1999) observed that there is no evidence of ERP 
providing headcount reduction.
When an ERP works well it can ‘speed up 
business processes, reduce costs, increase selling 
opportunities, improve quality and customer 
satisfaction, and measure results continuously 
(Piturro, 1999). Regarding business benefits of 
ERP, managers mention many productivity en-
hancements, including the ability to calculate new 
prices instantly, more accurate cost comparisons 
among different facilities, better electronic data 
interchange with vendors and suppliers, improved 
forecasting, and the elimination of bottlenecks 
and duplicative procedures (Plotkin, 1999). Other 
benefits deal with eliminating the redundanci-
es  associated with leagcy systems (Beard and 
Sumner, 2004). For example, at Owens Corning, 
there were 200 legacy systems, most running 
in isolation from one another. Eastman Kodak 
had 2600 different software applications (Pala-
niswamy and Frank, 2000). Organizations with 
ERP systems have made improvements in cross 
functional coordination and business performance 
(Oliver, 1999).
According to Markus et al. (2000) larger value 
of ERP is measured when the organization captu-
res actual business results (for example reduced 
inventory costs), but these results don’t occur until 
the phase in which the systems have already been 
successfully implemented and integrated into 
business operations-in referred by Markus et al. 
(2000) as ‘onward and upward phase’- a stage three 
evolution. Holland and Light (2001) also support 
that the business benefits of ERP occur in a ‘third 
stage’ of evolution, during which innovative bu-
siness processes are thoroughly implemented. As 
observed by Beard and Sumner (2004) that ERP 
may not necessarily directly provide organizations 
with a competitive advantage through reduction 
of these organizations cost below or by increa-
sing these organizations’ revenues above what 

62  
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems 
would have been the case if these systems had 
not been implemented. They further argued that 
the advantages mentioned are largely value-added 
measures, such as increased information, faster 
processing, more timely and accurate transactions, 
and better decision-making.  C
CONCLCUSIOSIN AND FUTURETR

ERP systems are increasingly popular IT platform 
that are being installed to assist  organizations 
in better capturing, managing, and distributing 
organization-wide operational data to decision 
makers throughout the organization (Beard and 
Sumner, 2004). They further discussed that

sustainable competitive advantage with an ERP 
system,  important characteristics that will create 
sustained competitive advantage and reengineer-
ing the organization without disrupting or destroy-
ing the characterisctics that gave it a competitive 
advantage are further research areas to know 
more about effects and strategic advantages of 
ERP. These may be include empirical, qualita-
tive or both the approaches in the organization. 
Comparison of ERP implementation effects and 
strategic advantages in two organizations may 
be an interesting area. Regarding limitation and 
concern as observed by Lee and Myers (2004) is 
that ERP systems are so large and complex and 
take years to implement, the inclusion of today’s 
strategic choices into the enterprise systems 
may significantly constrain future action. By 
the time the implementation of an ERP system 
is finished, the strategic context of the firm may 
have changed.     R

An executive information system (EIS) is a software system designed to support the informational needs 
of senior management. The EIS is characterized by an easy to use and maintainable graphical user 
interface; integrated capabilities for data access, analysis, and control; analysis and report generation 
across multiple files; and on-request “drill down” capability. Most existing management information 
systems provide an enormous quantity of detailed status reports. However, they lack the capability of 
providing summarized levels of information, in an appropriate format, for higher levels of manage-
ment. This problem has continued despite the emergence of enterprise resource planning systems. By 
understanding the concept and functionality of traditional executive information systems, readers will 
also be able to better understand how EIS has adapted to meet the requirements of senior management 
in an enterprise system environment.I
IntroductionTRCTI
Executives are upper-level managers who exert a 
strong influence on the direction and activities of 
the entire organization (e.g. McLeod and Schell, 
2001). An executive information system (EIS) is 
a computer-based system designed to support the 
unique informational needs of these very senior 
managers. These systems are designed to simplify 
the user’s interface with the computer, facilitate 
retrieval and manipulation of data from different 
sources, and display results in a single presen-
tation. Finally, executive information systems 
provide the capability to highlight exceptions, 
and explore data at progressively lower levels 
of detail. 
The concept of the executive information 
system can be traced to 1982, when Rockart and 

68  
An Overview of Executive Information Systems
Treacy introduced this term to describe an emerg-
ing category of information systems. They noted 
that there are four critical components to the EIS 
concept. First, there is the Executive, the human 
element in the EIS environment. The executive re-
quires timely information, quick inquiry response, 
and systemic ease of use. Information supports 
both critical success factor analysis and leading 
indicators of potential problems. The third compo-
nent is the System architecture that encompasses 
linkages to the relevant, and the processing of this 
data into critical information. The final component 
is the Organizational structure that manages the 
databases and systems, and maintains information 
security. All four components must be integrated 
for the EIS to be successful. 
To do this, an EIS combines two complimen-
tary approaches. According to McNurlin and 
Sprague (2002), “at its heart, an EIS should filter, 
extract, and compress a broad range of up-to-date 
internal and external information. It should call 
attention to variances from plan and also monitor 
and highlight critical success factors of the indi-
vidual executive user” (p. 386). This perspective 
defines an EIS as a structured reporting system to 
meet the unique needs of executive management. 
The second fundamental approach of the EIS, as 
identified by McNurlin and Sprague (2002), is as 
a human communications support, such that. “the 
managers make requests, give instructions, and 
ask questions to selected members of this network 
to get people going on the desired action” (p. 387). 
Alter (2002) confirms this by emphasizing the 
networks of internal and external contacts used 
to gather information about specific issues of 
current importance, as opposed to only utilizing 
formalized information systems.
The terms executive information system and 
executive support system (ESS) are often used 
interchangeably (e.g. Laudon and Laudon, 1998). 
Other authors make a distinction between the two, 
based upon the fundamental approach used or 
emphasized. For example, based on Rockart and 
DeLong’s (1988) original discussion, Turban and 
Aronson (2001) further define an executive sup-
port system as “a comprehensive support system 
that goes beyond EIS to include communication, 
office automation, analysis support, and business 
intelligence” (p. 308). An important feature, es-
pecially to upper-level management, is access to 
external data. Thus, where core EIS functionality 
focuses on the processing and presentation of 
information, an ESS implies other communica-
tions support capabilities more oriented toward 
the second fundamental EIS approach mentioned 
above. These communications support capabilities 
may include e-mail, office automation functions 
like electronic calendars, and linkages to stock 
market news and industry trends. 
Further, EISs were initially developed to sup-
port a small set of high-level executives within an 
organization. These systems normally served up 
to 10 or 15 senior executives. The success of these 
initial implementations has led to an expansion 
of these systems to support mid-level managers 
with cross-functional information needs. This 
type of system served up to sixty executives and 
managers, and has been termed an “extended 
EIS” In some cases, EIS, have been adapted to the 
entire organization (McLeod and Schell, 2001). 
Rockart and DeLong (1988) first observed this 
migration. For this paper, the term “executive 
information systems” will be used across this 
spectrum of applications and levels of use, with 
consideration of how the EIS concept has evolved 
in the process.B
BackgroundCKR
Historically, the traditional management informa-
tion systems (MIS) within a company have been 
developed independently of each other. These 
systems typically supported marketing, manufac-
turing, distribution, personnel, accounting, order 
entry, inventory control, and purchasing. They 
are used to support organizational planning and 
control, and are capable of producing both sum-

  69
An Overview of Executive Information Systems
mary and very detailed reports. Senior managers 
have typically tried to utilize these MIS reports 
to identify exceptions and trends that require 
management attention. However, in attempting to 
assimilate outputs beyond the limited functional 
areas, MIS systems are frequently deficient in sup-
porting the company-wide perspective required by 
executive decision-makers. Although these MIS 
systems may be subsequently interfaced, there 
was no true integration. There is a wide variety 
of screens and reports provided. Each system 
focuses on individual areas of concern, and each 
may have its own format under separate security 
access. Timliness of the resulting information 
may vary based on the specific system execution 
and the data that it uses. These reports frequently 
take the form of an endless stream of computer 
print-outs or online reports, which the executive 
has little or no time to review. There is a limited 
capability of providing summarized levels of 
information, in an appropriate format, for higher 
levels of management. Even when the reams of 
data are condensed and summarized, relevant 
information is frequently difficult to extract or 
understand. Too often decisions were a reaction 
to an event that has already occurred. 
Briefing books, sometimes referred to as 
management reporting systems (MRS), were an 
early effort to address these problems by auto-
mating data acquisition from a wide variety of 
corporate systems and databases, and providing 
online output in the form of fixed-format reports 
(e.g. Laudon and Laudon, 1998). The purpose of 
a MRS was to integrate, select, and reduce raw 
data to valuable information; create and distribute 
finished quality reports and charts; and to ensure 
reporting of consistent information across the cor-
poration. Management reporting systems tended 
to be MIS-based transaction systems linked to 
a presentation manager interface. These levels 
represent the major functional components of 
the MRS, where the transaction system tracks 
the status of operations and reports performance 
relative to plan based on data accessed from the 
appropriate data source. The presentation manager 
provides the formatted executive information in 
the form of reports to the user, as well as a means 
of system access and inquiry. Thus, they only 
addressed the earliest phases of decision-making 
(i.e. isolating problems and raising questions). The 
information output was considered to be restric-
tive and inflexible. 
Review of the literature has noted consider-
able work on the development of decision rules 
and computer-based support systems to aid in 
entire decision-making process. Decision support 
systems (DSS) are software systems that utilize 
sophisticated algorithmic approaches to solve 
problems. Within the DSS, the data processor 
(i.e. the database management system) controls 
the access and update of data from external files 
and datasources. The modelbase contains the 
specific analytical methods used for processing the 
accessed data. Although decision support systems 
were originally intended to serve the needs of up-
per management, they became to tools of analysts 
and lower-level managers. A further evolution was 
needed to better meet executive needs. As noted 
in Figure 1, the integration of DSS capabilities 
within the MRS framework led to the emergence 
of the true executive information system. 
Insertion of the DSS level into this framework 
provides a means whereby users can better develop 
their plans, specify what activities should take 
place, and better organize the operational informa-
tion for executive inquiry. For example, Turban 
and Aronson (2002) describe a pharmaceutical 
company’s product managers utilizing an EIS-
based DSS module to predict the end-of-month 
order status. Similarly, the commercially-avail-
able DecisionWeb EIS software provides ad-hoc 
analysis for determining trends and variances. 
As noted in Figure 1, this DSS integration may 
be executed either by using the presentation 
manager as a selection interface, or automatic 
access from the source database(s). The results 
of the DSS analysis are then formatted through 
the presentation manager for display to the user. 

70  
An Overview of Executive Information Systems
Although, DSS and EIS capabilities were initially 
considered to be separate and distinct, as reported 
in the literature, Alter (2002) noted an accelerating 
trend during the 1990s towards their integration. 
This is frequently expressed through the use of a 
spreadsheet facility.
	
Executive RequirementsR
Considerable research has been conducted on 
the informational needs and decision making 
processes used by executives. Watson et al. (1993) 
provided a comprehensive survey of the available 
research at that time. Executives’ busy schedules 
preclude either long training sessions or long un-
interrupted time for system use. Systems must be 
intuitive and easy to use, with very quick response. 
They must allow “environmental scanning” by 
accessing and integrates a broad range of inter-
nal and external data, and support management 
by exception by highlighting potential problems 
and tracking critical data. The EIS should store 
aggregated data for rapid access, efficiently index 
and retrieve information, and sort screen data ac-
cording to user defined criteria. Although earlier 
research focused on large corporations, Walters 
et al. (2003) confirmed that executives in smaller 
manufacturing companies also shared these same 
requirements.  Perhaps the most important aspect 
is that an EIS must meet the information needs of 
the executive user. Determining precisely what 
information should be included in the system 
continues to be a major topic of research in this 
area (e.g. Rainer and Watson, 1995; Walstrom 
and Wilson, 1997).
The literature particularly notes executives’ 
reliance on critical success factors (CSFs). Criti-
cal success factors consist of a relatively small 
number of easily identified operational goals 
that are believed to ensure the success of an 
organization. These CSFs may be derived by 
the industry, the specific firm, the manager, and 
the broader business environment. For example, 
McLeod and Schell (2001) identify “styling, an 
efficient dealer network, and tight control of 
manufacturing cost” as critical success factors 
within the automobile industry (P. 332). Rockart 
and Treacy (1982) argued that the information 
requirements of an organization, and particularly 
of that organization’s executives, are shaped by 
these critical success factors. The CSFs then 
determine a smaller data set on which resulting 
information systems can focus to best meet the 
executives’ requirements. 
The EIS is subsequently utilized to monitor 
each of the CSFs according to five categories of 
information (Turban and Aronson, 2001). Key 
problem narratives are reports that highlight 
overall performance, major problems, and the 
potential underlying reasons for these problems. 
Associated narrative explanations are often linked 
to supporting tables and graphs. Highlight charts 
display summary information based on the user’s 
indicated perspective and judgment. Since they 
are personalized to the user’s concerns, they visu-

ally highlight the performance status of priority 
areas versus respective CSFs. Key factors provide 
specific measures of CSFs, referred to as key per-
formance indicators (KPIs). These corporate-level 
displays usually employ management by excep-
tion to investigate measures of CSFs identified as 
problems, or potential problems, on the highlight 
chart. Typical key performance indicators include 
profitability measures, financial ratios, turnover 
rate, sales growth, market share, and demographic 
data. Detailed KPI responsibility reports indicate 
the detailed performance of or business areas 
critical to the success of the organization.  
Functionality
Consistent with these defined executive user 
requirements, an EIS promotes a proactive an-
ticipatory style of management by which problem 
indicators are closely monitored based on their 
CSFs, and timely corrective action implemented 
prior to serious problem occurrence.  This type 
of system may be further defined by having the 
following characteristics:
1.	
An easy to use and maintainable graphical 
user interface.
2.	
Integrated capabilities for data access, 
analysis, and control.
3.	
Analysis and report generation across mul-
tiple data sources.
4.	
On-request “drill down” capability to lower 
levels of detail.
5.	
Depiction of organizational critical success 
factors.
6.	
Functionality for decision support, ad-hoc 
queries and what-if analysis.
7.	
Sophisticated tools for system navigation.
8.	
Data analysis features.
9.	
Advanced report generation.
10.	 Access to a variety of external data sourc-
es.
The resulting combination of capabilities 
provides a powerful tool for senior management. 
They can navigate through data hierarchies, view 
data from different dimensions, analyze it, and 
create reports tailored to their specific informa-
tional needs. 
As noted by Laudon and Laudon (1998), most 
EIS systems provide “colorful presentations and 
pictorial menus that can be learned intuitively, 
with variances and exceptions highlighted in 
color” (p. 611). Users frequently access data and 
make selections via touch screen, keyboard, or 
mouse. Navigation to deeper levels of detail may 
be conducted based on their own selections, or by 
following pre-defined paths. The screen displays 
frequently incorporate management by excep-
tion by comparing the planned (or budgeted) 
performance with the actual performance of an 
operation. Accordingly, the executive’s attention 
is focused on exceptions to standards. Significant 
exceptions (i.e. those beyond a pre-identified 
threshold) are automatically identified by the 
EIS and highlighted (or otherwise brought to the 
executive user’s attention. This saves significant 
time in sifting through the data for exception 
conditions. 
This last capability allows the pointing and 
clicking on a specific data field for which the 
user desires an additional level of detail. As a 
result, the components of that data field are then 
displayed. EIS systems have a top-level menu, 
often referred to as an “executive dashboard” 
or “executive scorecard” (Liang and Miranda, 
2001). The intent of the dashboard is to provide 
a single-screen display of relevant and critical 
business metrics and/or statuses, frequently fea-
turing stoplight indicators. It is configured with a 
“hotspot” button at the intersection of the report-
ing categories and the organization identifiers, 
indicating the appropriate status. (See Figure 2.) 
Red, yellow, and green lights are indicated based 
on comparison to preset thresholds, where green 
indicates a nominal condition, yellow indicates a 
warning, and red identifies performance outside 

72  
An Overview of Executive Information Systems
of the pre-established boundaries. (Some EIS 
systems also provide audio signals to alert the 
executive to arriving information.) White indi-
cates that no information is currently available. 
The colors thus allow the user to prioritize his 
actions, and address potential problems requiring 
immediate attention. This enables more efficient 
and effective decision-making. 
Clicking on any of these stoplights allows 
drill down to the desired level of reporting, in 
order to indicate the source of any problems. 
(See Figure 3.) This concept allows users at 
various managerial to see data details relevant 
to their position and viewing responsibility. For 
example, the dashboard may provide a set of KPIs 
(e.g. revenue forecasts, gross profit, or inventory 
levels) with drill-down capabilities for each KPI 
monitored (Bose, 2006).Users at lower levels 
can view data details specific to their individual 
business function, while users at higher levels 
can view summaries across multiple functions. 
All levels are able to track data across multiple 
months. Drill-down capability exists for visibility 
to even further levels of detail. 
An EIS normally includes tools for modeling 
and analysis within its DSS layer. These frequently 
include built-in functions for statistical (e.g. 
trending, regression, and Monte Carlo analysis) 
and financial models (such as profitability analy-
sis, marginal utility, and benefit-cost analysis). 
Other functions may include goal-seeking (i.e. 
specify the values for the output data and the 
system will determine the required value of the 
input variable) and forecasting models. This may 
be deployed through the use Excel or similar 
spreadsheet program linkages in order to create 
graphic comparisons (e.g. by time period; by 
product: by region; or by price range). Costlier 
systems include more sophisticated specialty 
analysis built-in programs as part of their on-line 
analytical processing (OLAP) capabilities. OLAP 
supports decision-making based on analysis of 
multi-dimensional aggregated (i.e. summary) 
data. Examples of these include Pilot Software’s 
Decision Support Suite, Informix’s MetaCube 
Product Suite, and Cognos’ PowerPlay.  To aid in 
the decision-making process, interactive support 
functions are normally available which allow

the user to initiate ad hoc queries and “what-if” 
analysis. What-if analysis is a particularly useful 
tool for managers, whereby they can project the 
effect of modifications to the input data or other 
parameters will have on a resulting decision.
Construction of an EIS implies the need for a 
security system that will control access to sensitive 
information. The EIS, its data and software, must 
be protected at all times from unauthorized access. 
Accepted backup and recovery procedures need to 
be incorporated. Additional security features also 
need to be incorporated that will restrict access to 
data and information outside a specific user’s or-
ganization and/or subordinate offices. Multi-level 
security for data access needs to be established 
for any EIS that is used by multiple executives. 
In addition to prohibiting access to the system by 
unauthorized personnel, the security system must 
be multi-level in nature, to restrict access within 
a variety of classifications (Moynihan, 1993b). 
The security system should also be as transparent 
as possible to the executive user. Multiple levels 
of user-input passwords should be avoided Most 
senior managers prefer “one-button” access to 
their systems. Security supports the integrity of the 
data by ensuring that the data cannot be tampered 
with, viewed by outside parties, or that the data 
cannot be lost. The security feature enforces the 
drill-down functionality such that users at various 
levels of the organization see data details relevant 
to their position and viewing responsibility. Users 
at the lowest levels view data details specific to 
their functional area, while users at higher lev-
els initially view summaries across subordinate 
organizations, but can drill-down for visibility to 
further levels of detail. There are several strategies 
in addressing this problem. Some organizations 
adopt a multi-level security system utilizing the 
capabilities of an EIS application development 
software. An alternate approach utilizes a multi-
level, centralized database system to support data 
having different classifications and users having 
different clearances.

sion support system. Accepted DSS development 
methodology identifies four primary phases: data 
acquisition, system design, system construction, 
and verification and validation. During the data 
acquisition phase, the key concepts, relationships 
and sources are identified.  One major purpose 
of the general system design phase is to establish 
the overall definitions and descriptions of the 
proposed system. This is represented through the 
development of a requirements definition (RD) 
document. Laudon and Laudon (1998) provide 
a series of recommended steps for determining 
EIS requirements:
1.	
Identify a set of issue-generating critical 
events.
2.	
Obtain, from the executive, his assessment of 
the impact of the critical events on his goals 
and determine a set of critical issues.
3.	
Determine three to five indicators which 
can be used to track each critical issue.
4.	
Obtain, from the executive, a list of potential 
information sources for the indicators.
5.	
Identify exception heuristics for each indica-
tor.
During the subsequent detailed design phase, 
the acquired data and candidate mathematical 
models is organized within the RD context. This 
may provoke further investigation into support-
ing models and data. A functional system design 
document is then developed identifying the overall 
system architecture, processing considerations, 
and defi­nition of displays and reports. The identi-
fied requirements and functionality can be utilized 
for software selection. The general design is then 
“fine-tuned” to map to the capabilities of the soft-
ware. This step precedes actual programming of 
the EIS system. Upon completion of the system’s 
construction, a thorough verification and valida-
tion is conducted.  Traditional software engineer-
ing techniques, i.e., using a set of predetermined 
tests, are generally used to verify the integrity of 
the system. The validation process establishes that 
the system’s functionality addresses the original 
engineering problem and the user’s needs.
Because executive’s needs may change rapidly, 
some developers recommend utilizing prototyp-
ing, also referred to as rapid, application develop-
ment, to develop an EIS. In this approach, a series 
of preliminary working versions, each having 
progressively more functionality, are constructed 
for demonstration and evaluation. Due to the ex-
ecutive user’s expectations, developers must be 
certain that the system will work before demon-
strating it to the user. Each stage of the prototype 
must have an intuitive user interface, i.e. one that 
the executive can learn very rapidly.
Alternatively, a commercial off-the-shelf 
(COTS) product can be utilized. While early 
EIS systems were programmed exclusively using 
internal company resources, by the mid-1980s 
Comshare and Pilot Software introduced the 
first COTS development products (Watson and 
Carte, 2000). A COTS product is not an EIS per 
se, but rather a set of software tools with which 
to construct an EIS. They generally include the 
capability for constructing standard executive 
information features, such as picture menus, 
icons, hotspots, key performance indicators, and 
drill-down. Utilization of a COTS diminishes 
EIS development cost due to the availability of 
such product-specific data manipulation tools. 
The literature review indicates that subsequent 
maintenance costs for a COT-based system would 
be substantially less than in-house development 
(e.g. Watson et al., 1993). A variety of such EIS 
application software shells are now commercially 
available, which allow customization to individual 
company needs.
Executive information systems tend to be 
unique in that the implementation (and even 
post-implementation) issues often overshadow 
the actual system development. According to 
Rockart and Delong (1988), “the fragmented 
nature of executive work, the high degree of 
environmental uncertainty at this level of the 
organization, and the political ramifications of 

  75
An Overview of Executive Information Systems
providing top management with more and bet-
ter information, as well as other factors, make 
implementing EIS a special challenge” (p. 158). 
While data management may not be considered 
to be a significant problem when an EIS prototype 
is first installed, the practical barriers to provid-
ing executives with the data that they need can 
be a major road block post-implementation. As 
such, the system developers must contend with 
a number of issues relating to data availability, 
ownership, infrastructure, integrity, integration 
and management (Moynihan, 1993b). Once the 
EIS application goes online, the data owners 
are responsible for insuring the accuracy of the 
data. If the data are too old, too detailed, or too 
summary, or simply wrong, the executives may 
make the wrong decisions. Procedures need to be 
instituted in order to insure that the appropriate 
data are collected on time, refreshed when nec-
essary, consolidated where applicable, and made 
available in the appropriate format. An underlying 
problem with traditional data management is the 
difficulty of integrating data originally designed 
to meet the needs of isolated applications. This 
problem of decentralized development has lead to 
discrepancies in data definitions, data redundancy, 
and synchronization problems. The resulting lack 
of accessible, quality data often limits executive 
access to information, and hinders system main-
tenance (Moynihan, 1993b). 
Rather than providing direct linkage to 
source data, one approach to EIS construction 
recommends the establishment of a separate EIS 
database. As noted by McNurlin and Sprague 
(2002), there is concern that the executive would 
need too much detailed knowledge to access, in-
terpret, and use the raw source data. Instead, the 
desired data should be extracted from these data 
sources, formatted and incorporated into the EIS 
database. This information should be organized 
into a hierarchical fashion such that highlights are 
indicated in the top layer. Most raw data sources 
contain mostly current data, with little historical 
context. In order to be able to identify trends, the 
EIS database needs to incorporate time series 
data. Further, the executives need to track exter-
nal sources of information. An EIS that accesses 
internet-based sources gives executives a greatly 
improved ability to assess competitive conditions. 
Conversely, this access has its limitations; i.e. 
internet-based sources may be of questionable 
accuracy and reliability. Those data definitions 
that are closely defined and controlled in an 
EIS, are not controlled in these external internet 
sources. This may lead to confusion as outside 
information is merged with the well-defined EIS 
database (McNurlin and Sprague, 2002).
It is also to be noted that, as executive user 
personnel, become familiar with an EIS and 
its capabilities, these users inevitably begin to 
identify new system “requirements”. Sometimes, 
this occurs before the system is even formally 
implemented. This user community is used to 
getting its own way. Despite the flexibility inher-
ent in most EIS systems, some of these requests 
may involve modifications well beyond those 
originally specified in the design. Some requests 
are relatively easy to accommodate, others are not 
(e.g. those requiring the establishment of a new 
database). The fact that users are discovering in-
creasing potential for the system is beneficial and 
should be encouraged. However, the introduction 
of major modifications too early can result in an 
unforeseen, yet interrelated, impact elsewhere 
in the EIS. Therefore a strict policy should be 
established as early as possible, regarding the type 
and extent of changes that are permitted before 
implementation, and how post-implementation 
modifications will be handled. The subsequent 
addition of numerous enhancements can degrade 
system efficiency. Judgment must be applied in 
order to balance system capabilities versus re-
sponse rate. Rapid response is considered vital 
to the executive user.

cationsICTIS
A variety of executive information system appli-
cations have been developed for private industry. 
By necessity, very large corporations were among 
the first to realize the advantages that an EIS 
could provide. One such representative example 
is Conoco’s EIS (Belcher and Watson, 1993). 
Senior management was interviewed regarding 
their specific needs, and statistics tabulated on 
utilization of specific software applications. The 
system was designed and constructed by in-house 
staff with a heavy emphasis on the use of financial 
and refining capacity models. The completed EIS 
has continued to grow in usage and capability, 
including 75 decision support applications which 
were used in some form by over 4,000 Conoco 
employees throughout the world (Belcher and 
Watson, 1993). The cited benefits of the system 
included increased productivity, improved deci-
sion-making, and cost savings. 
Pratt and Whitney’s Commercial Engine 
Business purchased Commander, a commercial 
EIS software package from Comshare, to view 
metrics on customer service and jet engine prod-
uct performance (Laudon and Laudon 1998). 
The Commander software shell was customized 
to track critical quality and reliability measures 
(e.g. parts availability, spares inventories, and 
delivery statuses) for each engine model by the 
specific customer. As with many such COTS 
shells, Commander has graphics facilities, ex-
ception reporting/ variance highlighting and an 
easy-to-use system navigation capability. The 
resulting EIS was used to provide drill down 
capabilities to determine the reasons for specific 
engine repairs, and where quality improvements 
should be implemented. The system was initially 
utilized by approximately 25 executives, but was 
planned for significantly expanded use (Laudon 
and Laudon, 1998). Pizza Uno, a food service 
chain, similarly employed the Pilot Software 
OLAP-based (Online Analytical Processing) 
shell to integrate its existing corporate intranets 
(Turban and Aronson, 2001). The resulting EIS 
was characterized by a user-friendly graphical 
user interface and an ability to conduct multidi-
mensional analyses across different product lines. 
For example, marketing executives utilized the 
system to measure the results of test marketing 
a new menu and how it relates to labor and other 
costs (Turban and Aronson, 2001).  
A number of EIS systems have also been 
applied to the government environment. One of 
the first was an EIS developed for the New York 
State Office of General Services beginning in 
1988. With a budget of $500 M and over 4000 
employees, the agency needed to consolidate and 
integrate its data and information on the “design, 
construction, and maintenance of state buildings, 
food and laundry services to both correctional 
facilities and health-related institutions, statewide 
vehicle management, and centralized printing” 
(Laudon and Laudon, 1998, p. 612).  The system 
provided conventional EIS capabilities of status 
monitoring, comparison of budgets to actuals, 
and financial estimates, with drill-down to view 
details in any category. The EIS was fielded on 
a set of networked PCs linked to the agency’s 
mainframe computer. 
Another early public sector system was the 
center-wide EIS for NASA’s Marshall Space 
Flight Center (MSFC). Prior to this effort, there 
were a variety of Program Office and functional 
directorate systems. In March 1992, the MSFC 
Center Director appointed a steering committee 
and working group to begin efforts toward a cen-
ter-wide EIS (Moynihan, 1993a). The resulting 
system linked existing communication networks 
to support both Windows-based and MacIntosh-
based workstations then used at the Center, with 
the capability to also support a planned UNIX-
based platform. Based on an analysis of MSFC 
executive user requirements, the HOLOS EIS 
application shell was purchased. HOLOS provided 
a comprehensive set of tools for constructing 
standard EIS features, such as picture menus, 
icons, hotspots, key performance indicators and 

  77
An Overview of Executive Information Systems
drill-down. The software also allowed multi-di-
mensional modeling with associated calculations, 
statistical analysis, regression, and financial- and 
time-based functions (Moynihan, 1993a). 
Watson and Carte (2000) completed a compre-
hensive survey on the use of EISs in the federal 
government environment. Among the organiza-
tions they cited include the Internal Revenue 
Service, the Government Printing Office, De-
partment of Commerce, Department of Defense, 
and the General Services Administration.  Liang 
and Miranda (2001) note that non-federal public 
sector EIS applications remain limited but are 
anticipated to grow. Among the state and city 
governments they cite with active EIS develop-
ment projects are: Utah, Texas, San Francisco, 
Albuquerque, and Philadelphia. Recently, the State 
of Minnesota Department of Finance has pursued 
the development of an executive information 
system. The purpose of the system is to permit 
executive users to access pre-defined views of 
data stored on legacy state information systems. 
Conventional EIS capabilities (e.g. graphical 
and tabular formats, drill-down, and exception 
reporting) have been implemented in conjunc-
tion with Web-based access (Liang and Miranda, 
2001). Planned development would increase user 
flexibility and functionality with the ability to 
develop what-if analyses, cost projections, and 
scenario sharing/update. R

The advent, and subsequent adoption, of enterprise 
resource planning systems would appear to have 
addressed much of the underlying rationale for 
EIS development. As noted by Umble et al. (2003), 
ERP provides the twin benefits of integrating the 
information processing of many departments in 
order to create a coordinated corporate response, 
and creating a consistent, common set of data-
bases. It may also include integration with the 
information systems of other companies. These 
overall enterprise systems accumulate all trans-
action data from sales, purchasing, manufactur-
ing, and other business functions, then provide 
coordinated and integrated reporting of this data. 
This solves such traditional EIS development 
problems of disparate databases and conflicting 
data definitions. However, senior management 
may still be inundated with status report output 
from the enterprise system. The primary mission 
of the traditional EIS still remains in the ERP 
environment: to extract, filter, compress and 
track critical executive information (e.g. Liang 
and Miranda, 2001; Walters et al., 2003). 
As noted by Bose (2006), “managing enterprise 
performance is an important, yet difficult process 
due to its complexity. The process involves moni-
toring the strategic focus of the enterprise, whose 
performance is measured from the analysis of data 
generated from a wide range of interrelated busi-
ness activities performed at different levels within 
the enterprise” (p. 43). Effective management thus 
requires an understanding of how each discrete 
business action affects the entire organization. 
Conventional ERP provides snapshots of organi-
zational performance but do not adequately sup-
port continuous planning activities increasingly 
necessary for enterprise management. EIS has 
evolved to become a complementary component 
to ERP systems. 
As suggested by McLeod Schell (2001), Fig-
ure 3 depicts how enterprise systems provide the 
foundation for various business area systems (e.g. 
manufacturing information systems, and financial 
information systems). One aspect of the enterprise 
system is to gather and distribute data to all of 
the business processes within the organization. At 
the top of this architecture resides the executive 
information system. Executives and managers still 
need to make decisions based on data within this 
framework. Thus, the EIS provides an overlay to 
the ERP system such that it the processes enter-
prise data into decision-making information for 
senior management.    

78  
An Overview of Executive Information Systems
During the late 1990’s, the independent EIS 
concept described previously began to be inte-
grated with more cost-effective enterprise-based 
systems. Martinek and Szikova (2005) have 
discussed such an extended system to support 
printed circuit board production in Europe. Umble 
et al (2003) detail a successful implementation at 
Huck International, Inc. during 1998 and 1999. 
Huck purchased the Baan ERP system to replace 
a legacy MRPII hosted on HP3000hardware plat-
form at ten international sites. In addition to the 
expected personnel reductions, cost of information 
processing, better inventory and order control, 
and improved cash management, the capabili-
ties for improved management decision-making 
were identified and added as an enhancement to 
the system. 
This type of integration serves to better lever-
age existing ERP capabilities. For this reason, 
EIS has begun to transform into an acronym for 
enterprise information systems. This connotes an 
organization-wide system that provides consistent 
and integrated managerial information from a 
company point of view. Different users across 
the enterprise can utilize the system for different 
purposes, as well as serving the purposes of top 
executives. Increasingly DSS and traditional EIS 
capabilities are routinely added to commercially-
available ERP software products. In the SAP ERP 
software package, these capabilities are referred 
to as “strategic enterprise management systems” 
(Turban and Aronson, 2001). 
FUTURE DIRECTIONSTRIRCTIS
As the EIS concept has expanded and adapted to 
serve more levels of management utilizing enter-
prise systems and databases, the term executive 
information system has begun to lose its relevance. 
Data warehouse products can provide data in 
user-friendly, graphics-oriented query systems, 
consistent with EIS requirements. These data 
warehouses also provide filtered enterprise-wide 
data. The traditional linkage of an EIS to multiple 
subject area databases, or specific applications 
databases, is being replaced by a data warehouse 
interface. Further, information delivery via the 
corporate internet is evolving into Web-enabled 
support systems to better access internet-based 
information. For example, the SAS Institute 
includes this internet support function in its En-
terprise Software Suite. Vendors are increasingly 
beginning to use the term enterprise information 
system, or “business intelligence” (BI), to reflect 
this emerging role of EIS (Negash and Gray,

2003). With the advances in data warehousing 
and Web-networks, the traditional independent 
EIS is continuing to evolve into the concept of the 
enterprise (or corporate) portal for business intel-
ligence purposes. This portal concept is intended 
to better integrate internal company applications 
with a variety of external applications available 
via the internet. 
Ease of use has always been a primary re-
quirement for executive information systems. 
Traditionally, this has inferred an intuitive graphi-
cal user interface. To further improve the user 
interface, software vendors have begun to provide 
capabilities to quickly customize the EIS for the 
specific executive user through the inclusion of 
a toolbox option for analytical and graphical 
objects (Turban and Aronson, 2001). This allows 
easy customization capabilities. Pilot Decision 
Suite and Comshare’s DecisionWeb provide two 
examples of this emerging capability.
However, “ease of use” is also beginning to 
imply that the system has sufficient intelligence to 
automate some (if not all) aspects of the process. 
Although EISs are effective in monitoring present 
status, they can neither interpret nor explain. This 
necessitates a combining of EIS functionality with 
artificial intelligence capabilities. As these intel-
ligent EIS system expand, the task of drill-down 
will be progressively automated. By querying a 
“Why” function, the executive will initiate an 
intelligent agent to conduct the drill-down and 
ascertain the answer. This will depict the logic 
stream to locate and evaluate the significance of 
key indicators influenced the results. Simple trend-
ing or comparisons can already be determined by 
such agents, with automatic alerts provided based 
on comparison to a threshold value. Turban and 
Aronson (2001) report on such a deployment of 
EIS-based intelligent agents for improved environ-
mental scanning, i.e. to monitor specific websites 
for relevant news and pricing data. The collected 
data will then be routed for quantitative analysis 
by DSS components of the EIS. Results will be 
customized for each executive, and communicated 
as an e-mail alert. 
As an extension of the ESS aspect, it has 
been proposed that linkages be established to 
groupware to facilitate communication among 
executives to solve common problems. (Group-
ware refers to collaborative software and technolo-
gies beyond e-mail or videoconferencing. Lotus 
Notes is a common example.)  Other authors have 
proposed architectures for distributed intelligent 
EISs composed of an integrated framework of 
intelligent agents, expert systems, neural networks 
and conventional DSS to support the executive 
decision-making process. For example, Bose 
(2006) discusses such a framework as the basis 
for business intelligence-based enterprise perfor-
mance management. C
CONCLUSIONCSI
Much of the value of executive information sys-
tems come from their flexibility. Executives are 
free to determine the problems that they need to 
address, using the system as an extension of their 
own thinking process. The most apparent benefits 
of EIS are their ability to analyze, compare, and 
highlight trends, frequently through the use of 
graphics. EIS becomes a reality when executives 
access vital information, analyze trends with 
integrated diagnostics, and can model multiple 
alternatives. To be truly successful, the EIS sys-
tem components must require a minimal level of 
support, offer a fast development cycle, and are 
responsive and adaptable to the changing needs 
of executives. 
The progressive incorporation of EIS capa-
bilities, within the enterprise system, reduces 
the quantity of data that an executive must filter 
while dramatically increasing the quality of the 
information output. Future applications of intel-
ligent EIS will automatically incorporate expla-
nations, analyses, and forecasts that will further 
enhance the executive’s understanding of this 
output. They will anticipate potential business 
problems by examining leading indicators and

Enterprise Resource Planning systems have proven difficult and costly to implement. Organizations must 
consider the risks and rewards of embarking on complex and time consuming implementation projects. 
This chapter explores why firms adopt ERP systems, identifies the benefits firms seek, discusses the vari-
ous risks firms face as they adopt these systems, and suggests ways firms can manage these risks.
ITRCTI
As global business markets become increasingly 
competitive, firms look to technology to man-
age and improve their performance.  Timely and 
accurate information is a key to gaining perfor-
mance efficiency.  Many firms have implemented 
Enterprise Resource Planning systems (“ERP”) 
to meet these objectives.  ERP systems are com-
plex, off-the-shelf software packages that claim 
to meet the information needs of organizations. 
These systems replace hard to maintain solutions 
created by IS departments or older off-the-shelf 
packages that often provided only piecemeal 
solutions to an organization’s information needs. 
ERP systems evolved in the early 1990s from 
material requirements planning systems (“MRP”) 
and manufacturing resources planning systems 
(“MRP II”).  MRP dealt with material planning 
and control.  MRP II dealt with scheduling and 
planning a firm’s manufacturing resources. 
ERP systems serve the entire enterprise, not just 
manufacturing and inventory control as with its 
predecessors.  ERP integrates information for the 

84  
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
entire organization in a single database.  But ERP 
implementations are often complex and experi-
ence serious problems (Liang et al., 2007; Xue 
et al., 2005).  Failures, abandoned projects and 
general dissatisfaction have been well publicized 
in the business press.  ERP systems are “expensive 
and difficult to implement, often imposing their 
own logic on a company’s strategy and existing 
culture (Pozzebon, 2000, p. 1015).”  Muscatello 
and Parente (2006) cite ERP failure rates to be 
as high as 50%.  
agound
Three characteristics distinguish ERP implemen-
tations from other IT projects (Somers, Ragowsky, 
Nelson, & Stern, 2001).
•	
ERP systems are “profoundly complex 
pieces of software, and installing them 
requires large investments of money, time 
and expertise (Davenport, 1998, p. 122).”
•	
Software packages may require changes 
in business processes and procedure, may 
induce customization, and leave the imple-
menting firm dependent on a vendor for 
support and updates (Lucas, Walton, & 
Ginsberg, 1988).
•	
The adopting firm is usually required to 
reengineer its business processes.  As a re-
sult, the project must be managed as a broad 
program of organizational change rather 
than a software implementation (Markus 
& Tanis, 2000; Somers et al., 2001).
Despite these risks, global firms were spend-
ing $10 billion on ERP software and another $10 
billion on consultants to implement the systems 
in the late 1990s (Davenport, 1998).  An AMR 
study expected firms to spend $47 billion on ERP 
packages in 2001(Cotteleer, 2002).  Large sums are 
still being spent on ERP implementation projects. 
A Forrester survey found that ERP and enterprise 
applications remained “the top IT spending pri-
ority for 2005 (Hamerman & Wang, 2006).”  A 
summer 2005 survey of members of the Society 
for Information Management (SIM) showed that 
ERP is among the top six application concerns of 
its members (Luftman et al., 2006).  Hunter and 
Lippert (2007) forecast the ERP market to reach 
$US 1 trillion by 2010.
This article discusses the benefits firms expect 
to realize by adopting ERP systems, why some 
firms do not adopt these systems, risks associated 
with ERP implementation, some well publicized 
ERP failures, risk management tools and future 
trends in ERP implementation.
Benef
WHYhy DO oFIRMS m ADOPTdop 
ERPR?
Firms adopt ERP systems for both technical and 
business reasons.  Technical reasons include: re-
ducing systems operating costs, solving specific 
problems, such as Y2K, accommodating increased 
system capacity, and solving maintenance prob-
lems with legacy systems.  Business reasons may 
include: presenting a single face to the customer, 
quoting realistic delivery times, accommodat-
ing business growth, improvement of business 
processes, standardization of data, reduction of 
inventory carrying costs, and elimination of delays 
in filling orders (Markus & Tanis, 2000).
The rapid growth of the commercial market 
for ERP is attributed to the following factors 
(Watson & Schneider, 1999):
•	
Use of the popular client/server platform,
•	
Can be used as an enabler for reengineering 
projects,
•	
Y2K compliant,
•	
Marketed to CEO’s and CFO’s as “strategic 
solutions” rather than as transaction process-
ing software, and
•	
A way to outsource a significant part of the 
IS function. 

  85
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
Advantages of ERP systems include (Rashid, 
Hossain, & Patrick, 2002):
•	
Reliable information access by using a single 
database. 
•	
Avoiding multiple data entries, reducing 
cost and improving accuracy.
•	
Delivery and cycle time reduction minimiz-
ing delays in reporting.
•	
Cost reduction including time saving and 
improved controls.
•	
Easy adaptability with business process 
options based on best practices easy to 
adapt.
•	
Improved scalability.
•	
Improved maintenance with long-term 
vendor contracts.
•	
Global outreach with extensions to modules 
such as CRM and SCM.
•	
E-commerce and e-business capabilities. 
An example of a decision to adopt an ERP 
system is provided by Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a 
manufacturer of generic drugs.  Faced with erod-
ing margins and continuing price pressure, the 
existing systems were proving inadequate.  Data 
shared across business units had to be re-keyed 
resulting in frequent errors.  Data was locked in 
“functional silos” and did not support new pro-
cesses.  Geneva adopted ERP to solve the following 
problems (Bhattacherjee, 2000, p. 12):
•	
Implement best practices in business pro-
cesses,
•	
Integrate data across business units (hence 
reduce re-keying and maintenance costs),
•	
Enforce data standardization (to reduce 
software maintenance costs),
•	
Integrate well with new technologies or 
systems of acquired companies,
•	
Provide scalability with growing product 
and customer base, and
•	
Be Y2K (year 2000) compliant.
A survey of Fortune 1000 firms identified 
organizational changes following ERP implemen-
tations, including (Jones & Young, 2006):
•	
Greater collaboration among functional 
areas in divisions,
•	
Reorganization of processes,
•	
Greater integration of processes across the 
organization,
•	
Reduced silo behavior within divisions of 
the organization,
•	
Reduced costs of operations,
•	
Reduced silo behaviors across the organiza-
tion,
•	
Greater collaboration across divisions of the 
organization, and
•	
Greater integration of processes within 
divisions.
In addition, Jones and Young (2006) found 
people have a better view of the big picture, 
utilize more teamwork, and are more receptive 
to change.
Shang and Seddons (2000) developed a com-
prehensive framework for classifying benefits 
of ERP systems. They identified five major clas-
sifications of benefits: operational, managerial, 
strategic, IT infrastructure and organizational. 
Components of the Shang & Seddons framework 
are listed below.
Operational benefits include cost reduction, 
cycle time reduction, productivity improvement, 
quality improvement and customer services im-
provement.
Managerial benefits which accrue from ERP 
centralized data base and build in analytic tools 
include better resource management, improved 
decision making and planning, and performance 
improvement.
Strategic benefits include support of business 
growth, support of business alliances, building 
business innovations, building cost leadership, 
generating product differentiation, building ex-

86  
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
ternal linkages with supply chain partners.  An 
example of supporting business growth is the 
case of Smith Bits and Services.  An Oracle ERP 
system enabled this manufacturer and distributor 
of drilling bits and related products and services 
to absorb 32 acquisitions in a 24 month period, 
something that would have been impossible with 
its legacy software (Bradley, 2004).
IT infrastructure benefits include building 
business flexibility, IT cost reduction, and in-
creased IT infrastructure capability.  A benefit 
of the ERP implementation at MI Drilling, a 
Houston based energy services company, was 
to make IT costs more scaleable and less subject 
to the necessity of layoff and hiring cycles as 
demand for the company’s products fluctuated 
(Bradley, 2004).  
Organizational benefits include support of 
organizational changes, facilitation of business 
learning, empowerment, and building of com-
mon visions.
The timing of benefits from ERP implemen-
tation may be delayed for some time after the 
implementation.  Nicolaou (2004) cites a Bench-
marking Partners report that indicates “synergies 
of people, process, and technology” reach their 
peak 9 to 24 months after implementation fol-
lowing periods of productivity decline and skills 
development.  Hunton et al. (2003) found that 
financial performance differed little between ERP 
adopting firms and non adopters until two years 
after adoption of ERP.  Shang and Seddons (2002) 
found ERP operational, managerial, strategic, IT 
infrastructure and organizational benefits were 
realized 2-3 years after implementation.
With the identification of the prospective ben-
efits of ERP, why have some firms not adopted 
ERP?
Why Do FIRMS NOT AmoDOPT ERPdopR?
Markus and Tanis (2000) identified three very 
broad categories of reasons why firms that oth-
erwise have all or some of the reasons to adopt 
ERP systems, do not adopt it or only adopt ERP 
in part.  These firms may adopt only certain mod-
ules and rely on legacy systems or new custom 
systems for their needs.  Other firms may begin an 
implementation only to discontinue it for a variety 
of reasons.  The reason for this non-adoption or 
partial adoption can be categorized as follows:
1.	
Lack of feature-function fit,
2.	
Company growth, strategic flexibility and 
decentralized decision-making, and
3.	
Availability of alternatives to increase sys-
tems integration.
Lack of feature-function fit may be due to the 
design of most ERP for discrete manufacturing. 
Many companies have specialized processes com-
mon to their industry, which may not be solved by 
the best practices embedded in ERP systems.  The 
various modules may not fully support process 
manufacturing industries, such as food process-
ing and paper manufacturing, project industries, 
such as aerospace, or industries that manufacture 
products with dimensionality, such as clothing 
or footwear (Markus & Tanis, 2000).  Although 
as the ERP market becomes saturated, vendors 
are designing packages for industries that were 
previously viewed as too complex.
Companies concerned with maintaining rapid 
growth rates, those needing strategic flexibility 
and those without a top down decision making 
style may be non-adopters or partial adopters 
of ERP systems.  Dell Computer Corp. planned 
full implementation of SAP R/3 but discontinued 
the implementation after installing the human 
resource module.  Dell’s CIO expressed concern 
with the software’s ability to keep pace with Dell’s 
extraordinary growth rate.  Visio, a software 
company subsequently acquired by Microsoft, 
expressed concern with the ability of SAP to 
handle the frequent changes it required to its sales 
analysis and commission requirements (Markus 
& Tanis, 2000, p. 29).

  87
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
The experiences of Dell and Visio focus on the 
need for efficiency and flexibility in dealing with 
the external environment and internal processes. 
In a stable environment, mechanistic structures 
are appropriate consisting of “high degrees of 
standardization, formalization, specialization and 
hierarchy (Newell, Huang, Galliers, & Pan, 2003).” 
In a dynamic environment, organic structures are 
needed to enable organizations to be flexible to 
change products, processes and structures.  In 
these organizations low levels of standardization, 
formalization, specialization and hierarchy are 
most appropriate.  ERP may maximize organiza-
tional efficiency at the cost of flexibility (Newell 
et al., 2003).  The result may be an inability to 
respond quickly to changes in the environment, 
reducing the firm’s competitiveness.
Organizational culture may also be a factor in 
non-adoption or partial adoption of ERP systems. 
Kraft Foods Inc. was highly decentralized but 
slowly moving to a one-company philosophy. 
ERP was regarded as culturally inappropriate 
with this strategy (Markus & Tanis, 2000). 
Lean enterprises succeed “as a growth strategy 
for increasing sales by trimming the company’s 
product delivery system into a competitive weapon 
(Bradford & Mayfield, 2001).”  Lean enterprises 
have difficulty using ERP systems due to the lack 
of flexibility.  “ERP creates many nonvalue-added 
transactions by making companies track every 
activity and material price in the factory.  This 
is counter to Lean philosophy, which aims at 
speeding up and smoothing production (Bradford 
& Mayfield, 2001, p. 30).”
Alternatives to ERP systems include data 
warehousing technologies that integrate data from 
source systems for query and analysis.  These sys-
tems, sometimes described as “poor man’s ERP,” 
are limited by the quality of the underlying source 
systems (Markus & Tanis, 2000).  In 1993 Great 
Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc. completed a 
supply chain and business process infrastructure 
based on a “robust data warehousing capacity for 
category management and other grocery-specific 
functionality (Retek, 2003).”
Other problems identified with implementation 
of ERP include time, expense, vendor dependence, 
and complexity.
RISKS
ssocSSiated with ERPCITITR 
ITTI
Implementing ERP can be a risky proposition 
for firms.  Brown and Vessey (2003) observe 
“although failures to deliver projects on time and 
within budget were an old IT story, enterprise 
systems held even higher risks - they could be 
a ‘bet-our-company’ type of failure (Brown & 
Vessey, 2003, p. 65).”
Markus (2000) proposes 10 categories of IT 
related risks, all of which would apply to ERP 
systems: 
Financial risk
Non-use, underuse, misuse risk
Technical risk
Internal abuse
Project risk
External risk
Political risk
Competitive risk
Contingency risk
Reputational risks 
“IT-related risk includes anything related to IT 
that could have significant negative effects on the 
business or its environment from the perspective of 
an executive investing in IT (Markus, 2000).”
Some firms may be averse to the risks an ERP 
implementation can create.  Scott (2003) discusses 
some of the risks identified by Markus (2000). 
He describes project risks, information systems 
risks, organizational risks, and external risks in 
ERP implementations.
Project risks stem from the customization of 
purchased packages and the difficulty of interfac-
ing with legacy systems.  When firms believe their 
business process are unique, they may customize 
ERP software instead of adopting best practices 
imbedded in a standard implementation.  Data 
conversion can also be a problem when firms do 
not clean up their data before embarking on a 

88  
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
project.  After implementing SAP, Halliburton 
reported that inventory accuracy stood at less 
than 80% (Anderson, 2003).  Project leadership, 
limiting project scope, avoiding customization, 
and a phased implementation (rollout) can mini-
mize this risk (Scott, 2003).
Information systems risks arise from system 
performance problems.  ERP systems may be 
poorly configured or the hardware may need 
upgrading.  Another risk arises when the use of 
multiple vendors creates the need for multiple 
interfaces.  Multiple vendors contributed to 
the problems in the Hershey Food Corporation 
implementation.  Information systems risks can be 
minimized by avoiding customization, use of data 
warehousing for reports and queries and avoiding 
multivendor implementations (Scott, 2003).
Organizational risks of a bad ERP implemen-
tation can impact the firm’s operating profits. 
Customer deliveries can be delayed putting cus-
tomer relationships at risk.  Impacts can be with 
customers, financial performance, or internal 
business objectives.  Organizational risks can be 
minimized with training and strong leadership, 
which assures that sufficient resources are allo-
cated to the project and inspires employees who 
may resist the implementation (Scott, 2003).
External risks center on litigation associated 
with the implementation.  Firms with implemen-
tation problems may sue consultants and/or ERP 
vendors.  Overbilling by consultants and use of 
incompetent trainees have been sources of litiga-
tion (Scott, 2003).  Gore-Tex claims its consultant 
promised expert staff and delivered incompetent 
trainees.  Managing consultants by specifying 
goals and individual competence of consultants 
can minimize this risk (MacDonald, 1999).
Political risk occurs “if a dominant coalition 
attempts to use the ERP package as a means by 
which to impose its views on other functional 
areas” (O’Gorman, 2004, p. 25).  A case study at 
an international energy supplies company, where 
the ERP implementation was dominated by the 
financial management of the business, left the sup-
ply chain management function without the tools 
they believed they needed (Bradley, 2005).
A survey of members of the Chinese Enterprise 
Resource Planning Society identified the top ten 
ERP risk factors as follows (Huang, Chang, Li, 
& Lin, 2004):
•	
Lack of senior management commitment to 
the project,
•	
Ineffective communication with users, 
•	
Insufficient training of end-users,
•	
Failure to get user support,
•	
Lack of effective project management meth-
odology,
•	
Attempting to build bridges to legacy ap-
plications,
•	
Conflicts between user departments,
•	
The composition of project team mem-
bers,
•	
Fail to redesign business processes, and
•	
Unclear/misunderstanding changing re-
quirements.
Competitive Advantage.  Another reason for 
non-adoption may be that a standard software 
package available to all potential purchasers 
may reduce a firm’s competitive advantage.  A 
resource-based view of the firm assumes that the 
individual firm’s unique collection of resources 
and capabilities are a potential source of competi-
tive advantage.  Capabilities leading to competitive 
advantage may be embedded in current business 
processes.  
To create competitive advantage such capabili-
ties must be valuable, rare, costly to imitate and 
non-substitutable.  “Valuable and rare organiza-
tional resource can only be sources of sustained 
competitive advantage if firms that do not possess 
these resources cannot readily obtain them” (Bar-
ney, 1991, p. 107).  An off-the-shelf ERP package 
may be costly, but would not be rare or costly to 
imitate.  Adoption of ERP packages based on “best 
practices” may cause the loss of the unique and 
valuable advantage imbedded in current business 
processes.  A case study showed that: 

  89
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
…the introduction of SAP-specific business rou-
tines can threaten established core, enabling and 
supplemental capabilities and related knowledge 
sets.  The integration of SAP’s embedded business 
routines and reporting functionality contributed 
to the creation of (a) highly rigid reporting struc-
tures; (b) inflexible managerial decision-making 
routines; and (c) reduced autonomy on the factory 
floor… (Butler & Pyke, 2004, pp. 167-8). 
WELL PUBLICIZBICIED FAILURESIRS and
PROBLEMSRBS
Numerous descriptions of ERP failures have ap-
peared in the business press.  The experience of 
serious problems at many well run, well-financed 
firms may be enough to discourage some firms 
from beginning an ERP implementation.
Hershey Foods embarked on an ERP invest-
ment in mid-1996 to solve its Y2K problems and 
improve its ability to perform just-in-time store 
deliveries to its customers (Severance & Passino, 
2002).  After spending $112 million on an ERP 
project, Hershey Foods Corporation was unable 
to fill Halloween candy orders in October 1999, 
resulting in a 19% drop in third quarter profits 
(Stedman, 1999).  As a result of Hershey’s prob-
lems its stock price fell by a third and the firm 
lost market share to Mars and Nestle (Severance 
& Passino, 2002).  Hershey estimates it suffered 
a 3% permanent decrease in market share from 
this experience (Sutton, 2003).  
Nike’s ERP implementation is included in a 
listing of “infamous failures in IT project manage-
ment” (Nelson, 2007).  Major ERP related inven-
tory problems at Nike resulted in a profit drop of 
$100 million in the 3rd quarter of 2000.
A study by the PA Consulting Group found that 
“92% of companies are dissatisfied with results 
achieved to date from their ERP implementation 
and only 8% achieved a positive improvement in 
their performance (“ERP Implementation Disap-
points Companies,” 2000).”
Davenport (1998) identifies several unsuccess-
ful implementation efforts:
•	
Fox-Meyer Drug claims that an ERP system 
led to its bankruptcy.
•	
Mobil Europe spent hundreds of millions 
on ERP, but abandoned the project when a 
merger partner objected.
•	
Dell found that its ERP system did not 
support its new decentralized management 
style.
•	
Applied Materials gave up on its ERP 
implementation when it became over-
whelmed with the organizational changes 
it required.
ERP success stories receive much less pub-
licity.  
Manag NG RISKSngR
ERP vendors have tried to overcome the concern 
of potential clients by developing tools to assess 
and manage risks associated with ERP imple-
mentation.  Risk management as a process should 
(Zafiropoulos, Metaxiotis, & Askounis, 2005):
•	
Identify the context and criteria of the risk
•	
Identify the risks
•	
Determine the significance of each risk
•	
Identify, select and implement risk manage-
ment options
•	
Monitor and review the corrective options
These risk management systems allow project 
managers to make more realistic cost and time 
estimates to help avoid problems during imple-
mentation.  Zafiropoulos et al. (2005) found that 
the use of a generic risk management tool they 
developed provided a structured way to assess 
risks, better integrated the use of consultants, 
improved communications between consultants 
and the project manager, led to more realistic time 

90  
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
planning, and reduced the impact of problems 
when they occurred since the problems were 
expected and part of the project planning. C
Critical Success FactorsalSueao
Practitioners and academics have attempted to 
reduce the risk of ERP projects and improve the 
ability of firms to successfully implement ERP 
by identifying the factors critical to implementa-
tion success.  Critical Success Factors (CSFs) are 
defined as “the few key areas of activity in which 
favorable results are absolutely necessary for a 
particular manager to reach his goals” (Bullen 
& Rockart, 1981, p. 383).
Nah (2001) reviewed ten articles written by 
academics and practitioners between 1998 and 
2000 discussing “What are the key critical fac-
tors for ERP implementation success?”  These 
articles discussed eleven critical success factors 
listed in Table 1 together with the number of 
articles discussing each of the factors.  Nah did 
not distinguish whether empirical research, case 
studies or other methods determined the factors 
mentioned. 
Brown and Vessey (2003) identify five critical 
success factors based on case studies of a dozen 
ERP implementations.  The five factors are:
•	
Top management is engaged, not just in-
volved
•	
Project leaders are veterans and team mem-
bers are decision makers
•	
Third parties fill gaps in expertise and 
transfer their knowledge
•	
Change management goes hand-in-hand 
with project management
•	
A satisficing mindset prevails.
Bradley (2005, 2004) examined ten CSFs 
proposed in IT and ERP literature in a multiple 
case study of eight implementation projects and 
identified three factors related to successful project 
but not to unsuccessful projects.
•	
Choosing the right full-time project man-
ager
•	
Quantity and quality of training
•	
Project champions
ERP risks will likely be reduced by follow-
ing these and other CSF factors examined by 
practitioners and academic researchers (Pinto 
and Slevin, 1987; Laughlin, 1999). 
FUTRTS
The Gartner Group coined the term “ERP II” 
to describe a shift in ERP from an enterprise 
information base to moving information across 
the supply chain (“Taking the Pulse of ERP,” 
2001).  New risks and challenges will be faced 
by organizations opening up information systems 
to supply chain partners.  Supply chain partners 
could be potential competitors or pass information 
to existing competitors.  Resolving trust issues 
will be a key factor in the advancement of ERP 
II.  Gartner does not expect to see ERP II systems 
fully deployed before 2005 (“Taking the Pulse of 
ERP,” 2001).  
Davenport and Brooks (2004) discuss the need 
for both infrastructural and strategic capabilities 
in the organization.  ERP or Enterprise Systems 
provide core functionality but are expensive and 
time consuming to implement.  “These infrastruc-
tural capabilities provide very little in the way 
of real business value (p. 13).”  These systems 
do not provide “short-term cost savings or other 
competitive advantage (p. 13).”  In contrast, SCM 
applications provide “strategic, competitively-
oriented capabilities (p. 13)” which can reduce 
inventories and improve customer service.  Firms 
beginning to build infrastructure with ERP sys-
tems may run out of time and money, neglecting 
the strategic supply chain management systems 
(Davenport & Brooks, 2004). 
Along with the benefits describe above, ERP 
II brings significant new risks.  Most Interorga-

  91
Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
nizational communication involves web services. 
Swart et al. (2007) identify some of these risks by 
interviews with vendors, consultants and CIOs. 
Using a supply chain partnership model, risks 
are identified.
•	
Once a supply chain partner has access to a 
system the partner could explore other data. 
Security features tend to be added on, rather 
than built into these systems.
•	
Few organizations plan for the dissolution 
of a partnership and how to remove an or-
ganization.
•	
Companies tend not to invest in the resources 
necessary to protect their data.  Conversely, 
if they do invest it may send a message to the 
partner that they are not trusted, impacting 
the partnership in other way. 
•	
Once partner access is added, from a network 
security view the IT systems are merged

into a unified system enabling participant 
organizations access to the system.   
Another trend in ERP systems is that small 
and mid-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) will become 
leading adopters of ERP system as the large 
company market becomes saturated.  Vendors 
are developing less expensive versions of their 
software to appeal to the SME market.
Conluon
ERP implementation projects continue to present 
risks to adopting organizations.  Continuing ERP 
spending demonstrates that most organizations 
have concluded that the benefits resulting from 
such implementations outweigh the substantial 
risks and cost of ERP systems.  Perhaps the risks 
of not adopting ERP are determined to be greater 
than the risks faced by adopters.  The prospect of 
extending ERP beyond organizational boundaries 
to supply chain partners makes ERP even more 
attractive and possibly more risky.  Organizations 
will continue to adopt ERP as a strategic neces-
sity to remain competitive in their industry, but 
few, if any, will gain any sustainable competitive 
advantage by adopting ERP. R

KEY TERMSeyTem
Critical Success Factors (CSFs): Bullen and 
Rockart (1981) define critical success factors 
(CSFs) as “the few key areas of activity in which 
favorable results are absolutely necessary for a 
particular manager to reach his goals.”  Success-
ful managers must focus their scarcest resource, 
their time, “on those things that make a differ-
ence between success and failure” (p. 389).  The 
concept of critical success factors is consistent 
with a Drucker (1973) statement: “One has to 
control by controlling a few developments which 
can have significant impact on performance and 
results.”

Enterprise Resource Planning System Risks and Rewards
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems 
(ERP): An off-the-shelf accounting-oriented 
information system that meets the information 
needs of most organizations.  A complex and 
expensive information tool to meet the needs of 
an organization to procure, process and deliver 
customer goods or services in a timely, predict-
able manner.
ERP II:  Gartner group coined this expression 
to describe opening up ERP systems beyond the 
enterprise level to exchange information with 
supply chain partners.  ERP II extends beyond 
the four-walls of the business to trading partners. 
ERP II includes supply chain management (SCM) 
applications, customer relationship management 
(CRM) applications, and e-commerce applica-
tions.  ERP II is also referred to as extended 
enterprise systems.
IT-Related Risk:  This risk includes “anything 
related to IT that could have significant negative 
effects on the business or its environment from 
the perspective of an executive investing in IT”. 
(Markus, 2000).
Legacy Systems: Transaction processing 
systems that are designed to perform specific 
tasks.  These systems usually involve only a single 
functional area a business and are not integrated. 
Many legacy systems become outdated as busi-
ness needs change and the hardware and software 
available in the market place improved. 
Material Requirements Planning Systems 
(MRP):  Processes that use bills of materials, in-
ventory data and a master productions schedule to 
time phase material requirement, releasing inven-
tory purchases in a manner that reduces inventory 
investment yet meets customer requirements. 
Manufacturing Resources Planning (MR-
PII):  Extends MRP by addressing all resources 
in addition to inventory.  MRPII links material 
requirements planning with capacity requirements 
planning avoiding over and under shop loading 
typical with MRP.
Risks: “A risk is a future event that may or 
may not occur.  The probability of the future event 
occurring must be greater than 0% and less than 
100%.  The consequences of the future event 
must be unexpected or unplanned for” (Hall & 
Hulett, 2002).
Risk Management: A system designed to 
avoid “problems during a project, which can lead 
to deviation from project goals, timetables, and 
cost estimations (Zafiropoulos et al., 2005).

Abstracta
After observing that the pervasiveness of IT may soon render it strategically irrelevant, management 
scholars have recently questioned the value of information technology. This chapter challenges the above 
view, contends that ERP investments may contribute to the achievement of improved business performance, 
and examines the conditions under which this contribution occurs. The panel analysis of a sample of 
SAP R/3 adopters provides several insights. First, it suggests that the ERP exerts a generalized positive 
impact on both productivity and profitability. Second, the results confirm that the widespread diffusion of 
best practices embedded in the software may limit the ability of firms to use ERP to effectively differenti-
ate from competitors. However, they also suggest that, whilst in the long run the pervasive diffusion of 
standardized software may decrease its strategic value, in the short run early ERP adopters can profit 
from a window of opportunity to obtain above average returns.
noduon
The rising level of competitiveness and the high 
degree of market turbulence of most industries 
induces business organizations to increase their 
investments in information technology (IT) to 
improve the efficiency and responsiveness of 
operations. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP1) 
applications represent perhaps the most relevant 
example of this trend. ERP has become preva-
lent over the last few years, particularly in the 
manufacturing sector (Scott and Shepherd, 2002). 
Investments in this technology continue to grow 
steadily in all major markets. Compound annual 

  97
ERP-Driven Performance Changes and Process Isomorphism
growth rates for 2005 ranged from 5.2% for the 
Europe, Middle East and Africa market (EMEA) 
to 11.8% for the Asia-Pacific region (Pang and 
Eschinger, 2006).  
While highly complex, risky, and often charac-
terized by difficult implementations, ERP applica-
tions have a clear appeal: they generate internal 
operations benefits and help firms improve their 
competitiveness. Yet, in spite of their pervasive 
diffusion, the benefits of ERP are still uncertain 
(Vemuri and Palvia, 2006). The scale of ERP 
projects suggests that ERP deployment should 
have a significant and measurable effect on firm 
performance (Hitt et al., 2002). However, there 
is conflicting empirical evidence regarding the 
benefits of ERP investments (Hayes et al., 2001; 
Poston and Grabski, 2001; Hitt et al., 2002; Cot-
teleer and Bendoly, 2006; Wieder et al., 2006). 
A significant amount of heterogeneity also exists 
across firms, as large and mostly unexplained 
performance differences have been observed 
across ERP adopters (Mabert et al., 2003; Umble 
et al., 2003).
Although management scholars and practi-
tioners have dedicated a significant amount of 
attention to study enterprise systems, several gaps 
still remain in the literature. First, whilst most 
studies have sought to establish whether a link 
exists between ERP adoption and performance, 
few scholars have analyzed the conditions under 
which this link occurs. One important aspect that 
has been often neglected is the issue of adoption 
timing. As a result of the increasing uncertainty 
and of the high cost of ERP implementation, most 
companies prefer to defer their ERP projects and 
wait for newer and less complex versions of the 
software. Yet, deferring implementation is also 
risky because it causes delays in the realization 
of operational improvements. Very little research 
has been conducted to shed light on this trade-off 
and help managers in making this decision. 
A second important aspect that has been over-
looked is the extent to which the pervasive diffu-
sion of standardized business process templates 
embedded in the ERP software may reduce the 
ability of firms to differentiate from competitors. 
Some scholars have indeed questioned the stra-
tegic value of IT, arguing that as the technology 
can be easily imitated, it does not bring any long-
term competitive advantage (Carr, 2003). A few 
anecdotal examples have been used to support 
this claim. However, to our knowledge, very few 
studies have provided sound empirically grounded 
evidence for this hypothesis.
Finally, with the relevant exception of Hitt et al. 
(2002), most empirical studies seeking to establish 
a link between ERP and performance were based 
on cross-section analyses. A cross-section model 
enables the researcher to verify whether such a 
link exists at a particular point in time. Yet, it 
does not allow for the analysis of the long-term 
implications of the phenomenon investigated. In 
the case of ERP systems, which often exert their 
benefits several years after implementation, this 
is clearly a limitation.  
These observations constitute the point of de-
parture for our study. We use a panel data analysis 
to shed further light on the relationship between 
ERP adoption and performance. The study has 
three specific objectives: i) to quantify the average 
impact of ES investments on both productivity and 
profitability; ii) to examine whether the timing 
of adoption affects this impact; iii) to examine 
whether the widespread diffusion of best practices 
embedded in the software creates business process 
isomorphism and presents risks for the achieve-
ment of long-term competitive advantage.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as 
follows. In section 2 we provide some background 
on Enterprise Systems. In section 3 we develop 
three sets of testable research hypotheses. In sec-
tion 4 we describe the data and the econometric 
approach used to test the hypotheses. In sections 5 
we present and discuss the results of our analysis. 
Finally, in section 6 we discuss the implications 
and some limitations of our study, and we identify 
some avenues for future research.

ERP-Driven Performance Changes and Process IsomorphismB
BackgroundCKR
Enterprise Systems are one of the most repre-
sentative information technology innovations 
appeared on the market in the past few years. 
They are large computer systems that – through a 
common database - integrate different application 
programs in many (possibly all) functions of the 
firm: accounting, sales, manufacturing, finance 
and human resource management.
Besides the important technical benefits they 
produce (increase of accuracy, homogeneity and 
timeliness of information within the organization), 
these systems also help organizations create busi-
ness process competences. These competences are 
generated primarily during the implementation 
of the system, through various mechanisms: the 
redesign of processes in various functional areas, 
the customization of the software, or the integra-
tion of the business knowledge of internal business 
experts with the technical skills of external IT 
consultants (Hitt et al., 2002). 
IT managers, software vendors, and informa-
tion systems consultants provide numerous recipes 
for maximizing the success of ERP implementa-
tions. Yet, these recipes are often inconsistent. 
Some suggest that ERP should be considered as 
a strategic resource and therefore managed in-
house, because implementation projects require 
process re-engineering efforts that facilitate the 
development of core process competences. Oth-
ers stress that these benefits are minimal and that 
these projects should be outsourced to minimize 
costs (Ettlie et al., 2005). By the same token, 
some organizations report having successfully 
profited from ERP projects, streamlining busi-
ness processes and promoting organizational 
changes (Davenport, 2000). Others argue that 
this strategy is potentially dangerous, because it 
combines the technical uncertainty of large IT 
projects with the organizational uncertainty of 
change-management programs.
Regardless of the specific implementation 
strategy adopted, ERP systems have the distinc-
tive characteristic of becoming catalysts for 
business process re-engineering programs. This 
property is due to the fact that Enterprise Systems 
are organized around “best practices” or “refer-
ence models”. These are generic built-in process 
templates contained in the software library that 
suggest an organization what the optimal process 
configuration and the most efficient resource al-
location scheme(s) should be for the execution of 
a particular task. As a consequence of this par-
ticular structure, a firm that adopts an enterprise 
system is forced to analyze its business model, 
to map and codify its processes and, possibly, to 
re-configure them (either to eliminate possible 
bottlenecks that have emerged or simply to bet-
ter match the process templates contained in the 
software library). This architectural reorganiza-
tion is de facto a major business re-engineering 
process and one of the causes of the performance 
changes observed after the adoption of the system. 
It is also – as we will argue – a potential source of 
strategic risks because it may reduce the ability 
of an organization to differentiate its processes 
from those of its competitors. 
IMPACT OCTF ERPR ON BUSINESSBSISS  
PERFORMANCERRC
Direct Impact of ERPIR on Productivity 
and Profitability
Enterprise systems can impact business perfor-
mance through various mechanisms. They can 
affect productivity by reducing operating costs. 
For instance, the centralization of IT applications 
and the replacement of fragmented legacy systems 
with a single integrated application can help firms 
reduce the time spent in planning, developing and 
maintaining and using the systems. The automa-
tion of business processes can help manufacturing 
companies decrease their production and distri-
bution costs. ERP can also reduce infrastructure 
and capital costs and improve information quality, 

  99
ERP-Driven Performance Changes and Process Isomorphism
thereby promoting operational efficiency and 
management effectiveness (Salmela, 1997; Gupta 
and Kohli, 2006).
ERP can also exert an impact on revenue 
generating activities. For instance, it can leverage 
organizational competitiveness, by improving the 
way in which strategically valuable information is 
produced, shared and managed across functions 
and locations (Gupta and Kohli, 2006). Also, the 
increased interoperability across functions allows 
for faster new product development processes, 
while the ability to disseminate timely and ac-
curate information translates into an improved 
capacity to match demand changes and better 
communication with customers (Davenport, 
2000). Consistently with this view and with previ-
ous studies on the productivity and profitability 
impact of enterprise systems (Hitt et al., 2002) we 
propose therefore the following hypotheses:
•	
Hypothesis 1a: The adoption of ERP adop-
tion exerts a positive impact on productiv-
ity
•	
Hypothesis 1b: The adoption of ERP adop-
tion exerts a positive impact on profitabil-
ityT
The RoRle of Adoption TiTming
Management scholars have recently observed 
that the pervasiveness of IT may soon render 
it strategically irrelevant (Carr, 2003). A direct 
consequence of this observation is that, in order 
to minimize the risk of starting costly projects that 
yield limited and uncertain returns, firms should 
postpone the adoption of IT innovations until the 
technology becomes sufficiently commoditized 
and well understood. This argument applies 
well to the case of enterprise systems, which are 
characterized by long and extremely expensive 
implementation projects. Yet, both the academic 
literature and some anecdotal examples demon-
strate that a few organizations have been able to 
achieve significant advantages after adopting an 
aggressive (i.e. innovative) stance with respect 
to ES adoption.  
As a matter of fact, there are arguments for and 
against the occurrence of first mover advantages 
in ERP adoption. On the one hand, there are real 
efficiency gains from the ERP implementation 
because the system is a business process opti-
mizer. Clearly, early adopters can enjoy these 
benefits for a longer period of time. Furthermore, 
early adoption can be a signal to the market. It 
can effectively differentiate companies with 
high quality processes from competitors and 
generate additional demand for firms that pursue 
this strategy. If early adopters meet customer 
expectations, reputation and trust increase even 
more, and further differentiate adopters from 
non-adopters in a self-reinforcing process similar 
to the one described in a Spence signaling model 
(Mas-Colell et al., 1995).
On the other hand, companies that defer ERP 
implementation may enjoy other types of ben-
efits. The literature has noted the occurrence of 
important performance dips after ERP adoption 
(McAfee, 1999). As the number of ERP imple-
mentations increases, the technology becomes 
collectively better understood: ERP vendors may 
release newer and simpler versions of the software, 
while IT consultants devise more effective imple-
mentation strategies. As a result, late adopters 
typically face less risky and less expensive ERP 
projects. The combined effect of these benefits 
should reduce the magnitude and the duration 
of the performance dips usually observed after 
implementation.
We argue that the benefits associated with a 
deferred implementation are not large enough 
to offset the delays in the realization of the 
operational benefits produced by a late ERP 
adoption. Accordingly, we propose the following 
hypotheses:
•	
Hypothesis 2a: The positive effect of ERP 
on productivity is larger for early adopters 
than for late adopters

Hypothesis 2b: The positive effect of ERP 
on profitability is larger for early adopters

BI
and Decreasing Heterogeneity in 
Performance
In his often cited Harvard Business Review article, 
Nicolas Carr questioned the value of informa-
tion technology as a strategic resource and sug-
gested that the widespread diffusion of systems 
that can be easily imitated does not lead to the 
achievement of long term sustained advantage 
(Carr, 2003). This risk is particularly important 
in the case of enterprise systems because of the 
particular nature of the technology. The imple-
mentation of ERP usually forces the adopters to 
reengineer their business processes according 
to the templates embedded in the software (so-
called “best practices”). The market for enterprise 
systems is extremely concentrated, with the five 
largest vendors enjoying more than 70% of the 
overall market in 2005 (Shepherd, et al., 2005). 
Clearly, the pervasive diffusion of a specific type 
of enterprise system from the same vendor gener-
ates business process isomorphism and reduces 
heterogeneity across firms. As a result, ERP 
adopters may not be able to rely on their business 
processes to effectively differentiate from their 
competitors. Therefore, even if on average ERP 
adoption is expected to exert a positive impact 
on performance, we expect post-ERP adoption 
performance to be converging among adopters as 
the number of adoptions increases. We propose 
therefore the following hypotheses:
•	
Hypothesis 3a: Differences in productivity 
across firms tend to decrease over time as 
the number of ERP adoptions increase
•	
Hypothesis 3b: Differences in profitability 
across firms tend to decrease over time as 
the number of ERP adoptions increase

Impact of ERP and ERP Adoption 
Timing on Performance
To test hypotheses 1-3 above, we examined the 
impact of ERP on two performance measures: 
productivity and profitability. Following Hitt et 
al.(2002), we employed two approaches to assess 
the impact on productivity. The first approach was 
based on the Cobb-Douglas production function, 
which relates value added (VA) to capital (K) and 
labor cost (L) through an exponential function: 
VA = cKb La. To estimate the effect of ERP adop-
tion on productivity, we first linearized the Cobb 
Douglas function by taking log transformations 
on both sides and then added appropriate control 
and dummy variables as displayed in eq. 1:

A first dummy variable, ERPit, was introduced to 
reflect whether a company had or had not adopted 
an ERP at time t. Extant research has suggested 
that the impact of ERP on firm performance does 
not become evident until the system becomes 
fully operational (Hitt et al. 2002). In the ERP 
jargon this event is denoted by a specific date in 
the system life cycle: the ERP live date. Accord-
ingly, we used this date to construct the dummy 
variable that indicates ERP adoption. At any 
given year t, and for any company i the dummy 
ERPit was set equal to 0 if the company i’s live 
date was smaller or equal than t and it was set 
equal to 0 otherwise. 
To test whether the time of adoption created any 
first-adopter advantage we constructed a second 

  101
ERP-Driven Performance Changes and Process Isomorphism
dummy variable, rankit, which indicates the year 
in which company i adopted the software relative 
to the other companies in the sample (rankit  = 1, 
2, 3, etc…  if company i adopted R/3 in the first, 
second, third… year of observation). We finally 
added year and industry dummies to control for 
differences in industries and for changes in the 
economic cycle2. The coefficient β3 in eq. 1 was 
used to assess the impact of ERP adoption on 
firm output, whereas the coefficient β4 indicated 
the impact of adoption timing.
In addition to the production function ap-
proach, we also analyzed the effect of ERP 
productivity by examining changes in revenue 
per employee. We regressed revenue against the 
number of employees, the ERP adoption dummy, 
the adoption timing dummy and the usual year 
and industry control variables (eq. 2). The impact 
of ERP adoption and ERP adoption timing on 
performance is indicated by the coefficients β2 
and β3.

A second set of models was used to assess the 
impact of ERP on business profitability. The IS 
literature traditionally used ratios such as return 
on asset (ROA) and/or return on equity (ROE) as 
dependent variables to assess this impact (Hitt and 
Brynjolfsson, 1996). Hitt et al.(2002) proposed a 
slightly modified version of this approach, arguing 
that using the log of the numerator (profit before 
taxes) as dependent variable and the log of the 
denominator (total assets or equity) as indepen-
dent variables allows for a more flexible model 
specification. Similarly to what discussed in the 
case of eq. 1 and eq. 2, this approach also allows 
for the incorporation of price deflation through 
year dummies. Following this approach, we used 
therefore the model specifications represented in 
eq. 3 and eq. 4 (for ROA and ROE, respectively). 
As usual, the coefficient β2 and β3 reflect the im-
pact of ERP adoption and ERP adoption timing 
on the two profitability measures.

Studies in this area have mostly used pooled 
OLS as estimation method. Yet, pooled OLS is 
inadequate to address firm heterogeneity and 
endogeneity issues, because it assumes there is 
neither serial correlation nor correlation between 
the error term and the regressors. This may cause 
inconsistent coefficient estimates. For example, 
firms with superior IT management tend to adopt 
ERP earlier. At the same time superior IT manage-
ment may also contribute to improve performance 
as well. When this is the case, endogeneity issue 
arises because IT management quality is not 
observed and it is implicitly accounted for in the 
error term. 
To avoid this problem, we estimated eq. 1-4 
using a fixed effect model with a single error 
component structure εit = αi + ηit (where ηit is 
iid). This approach takes effectively into account 
the above issue (a Hausman specification test 
rejected the random effect model and confirmed 
the potential endogeneity problem).
Business Process Isomorphism
A thorny problem in the evaluation of changes 
in performance differences occurring after ERP 
adoption is the measurement of performance 
heterogeneity. As sample variance is not a good 
measure (it is sensitive to outliers and to the 
measurement unit employed), we used an ap-
proach derived from the method developed by 
Dess and Beard (1984) to measure environmental 
turbulence.

102  
ERP-Driven Performance Changes and Process Isomorphism
We initially focused on the restricted sample 
of ERP adopters with the objective to examine 
whether the performance differences among these 
firms changed over time. For every performance 
measure of interest, we first conducted a cross 
sectional analysis. In each year t we estimated 
the model:
 
ln( PRN )
ln( PRD )

where PRN and PRD are the numerator and 
the denominator of the performance ratio of 
interest (Revenue per employee, ROA or ROE). 
A first performance heterogeneity measure 
Perf _heterogeneity_1 was created by dividing 
the standard error of the coefficient estimateβ1 in 
the cross-section regression by the mean of the 
dependent variable, i.e.: Perf _heterogeneity_1= 
StandErr(β1)/Mean(PRN). In the second step we 
conducted a longitudinal analysis and estimated 
the model represented in eq. 5. The coefficient 
γ1 was used to examine changes in performance 
heterogeneity and to test hypothesis 3.

The above approach assumes that a large part of 
the remaining variance in firm performance is 
due to ERP adoption, which may not be neces-
sarily true. To address this issue and relax this 
assumption we applied a slightly modified version 
of the above method to the pooled sample, which 
included both adopters and non adopters. The 
presence of non adopters required the use of an 
ERP adoption dummy. This approach examines 
therefore how the contribution of ERP adoption 
to changes in performance changes over time. 
Accordingly, the cross sectional analysis was 
based on the following model:

ing the standard error of the coefficient estimateβ2 
in the cross-section regression by the mean of 
the dependent variable, i.e.: Perf _heterogene-
ity_2 = StandErr(β2)/Mean(PRN). Finally, as 
in the restricted sample case, we estimated the

Sample Selection and Data S
C llection
The panel for this study was obtained by combin-
ing a sample of ERP adopters and a control sample 
of non-adopters. The sample of ERP adopters 
included 174 small and medium companies operat-
ing in Italy that implemented SAP R/3 between 
1994 and 2002 in the manufacturing and in the 
consumer products sectors (table 1). The data set, 
obtained from SAP, included information about 
the client, as well as the ERP project start date 
and live date. This information was integrated 
with financial data obtained from public sources 
(AMADEUS). 
The window 1994-2002 was chosen because it 
covered the entire diffusion process of a specific 
release of SAP R/3 in the country examined. The 
ERP adoption pattern for the companies in the 
sample followed the well documented S-shaped 
curve: no adoptions were registered in 1994; only 
7 companies adopted the software in 1995; the 
number of adopters increased to reach a maximum 
of 48 in 1999 and gradually fell to reach a mini-

  103

mum of 1 in 2002. The data base of ERP adopters 
was then matched with a control sample of 174 
non-adopters selected randomly from a popula-
tion of companies of similar size that operated 
in the same country. Table 2 displays descriptive 
statistics and Pearson correlations coefficients for 
the pooled sample for all the variables used in the 
various econometric models.

Impact of ERPR and ERPR Adoption T

Profitability
Table 3 presents the results of fixed effect estimates 
for models (1)-(4). The models are all significant 
at the .01 level and have high explanatory power. 
All coefficient estimates are also significant at 
the .01 level. The results provide strong support 
for hypotheses 1 and 2. The coefficient of the 
ERP adoption dummy is consistently positive 
and significant at the .01 level in all the models 
tested. This suggests that the adoption of ERP 
contributes to generate productivity and profitabil-
ity increases. The result is consistent with earlier 
studies on ERP that used a similar methodology 
(Hitt et al., 2002). Conversely, the ERP adoption 
timing variable is significant at the .01 level, but 
it is negative in all models. This suggests that the 
adoption timing has also a strong impact on the 
ability of firms to generate benefits from their 
ERP investments and provides strong support 
for hypothesis 2. The learning effects and the 
reduced performance dip associated with late 
ERP adoption were outweighed by the delays in 
the realization of operational benefits as early 
ERP adopters clearly enjoyed greater benefits 
than late adopters. 
The coefficients of models (1)-(4) can also 
be used to calculate the point in the observation 
window after which the adoption of ERP started 
generating negative returns. The production func-
tion model in eq. 1 can be used as an illustrative 
example. The coefficient estimates for the ERP 
adoption dummy and for the ERP adoption tim-
ing (column 1 in table 3) show that the effect of 
ERP adoption on ln(value added) can be written 
as ERP adoption*(0.39-0.23*ln(ERP adoption 
timing)). As 0.39-0.23*ln(6) < 0 < 0.39-0.23*ln(5),

of our observation window (i.e. after 1999) had 
a lower productivity compared to firms that ad-
opted the system earlier. A similar analysis can 
be repeated for models 2, 3 and 4 and provides 
similar results.

Table 4 displays the results of the longitudinal 
models used to examine the evolution of perfor-
mance heterogeneity over time. The regression 
results are consistent across all models. The 
coefficients γ1 in eq. 5 and eq. 6 are negative and 
significant at the .01 level in all models tested, 
both in the pooled sample and in the restricted 
sample. The results of the restricted sample analy-
sis indicate that performance differences among 
ERP adopters have actually decreased during the 
period of observation. The results of the pooled 
sample analysis suggest that the contribution of 
ERP adoption to increases in performance has 
also decreased over time. Altogether the two sets 
of models provide strong support for hypothesis 
3. As ERP systems are becoming increasingly 
commoditized, the widespread diffusion of the 
standardized process templates embedded in the 
software reduces differences among firms and 
tends to generate business process isomorphism 
at the industry level. As a consequence, relying 
on solely on ERP for achieving competitive ad-
vantage becomes progressively more difficult with 
an increase in the number of adoptions.  
Analysis of Adoption Drivers
To rule out the possibility that the above results 
cold be affected by a self-selection bias, i.e. by 
the fact that ERP adopters could be already the 
most profitable companies before implementing 
the software, we conducted several additional 
tests. As a first step, we examined the impact 
of profitability on the survival time Ti. For the 
generic firm i, the survival time Ti was defined 
as the time elapsed between the year in which 
R/3 was first released to the market (alike to a 
“birth”) and the year in which company i adopted 
the system (alike to a “death”). To estimate the 
model we used a Cox-proportional hazard model, 
which controls for data censoring and allows for 
time-repeated measurements without imposing a 
specific form for the underlying survivor function. 
We run several versions of the model, using firm’s 
profitability and lagged profitability (from T-1 to 
T-3) both jointly and individually as explanatory 
variables and revenue or number of employees as 
controls for firm size. 
All the models analyzed were consistent. 
Table 5 reports the results of a general model in 
which all the profitability variables are introduced 
simultaneously. The results suggest that, after 
controlling for firm size, the impact of profit-
ability on survival time is not significant. It is 
also worth noting that larger firms were likely to 
adopt an ERP system earlier than small firms, at 
least within the time window examined (1994-
2002). This observation is in line with anecdotal 
evidence, as the first generation of enterprise 
systems was primarily targeted to the market of 
medium and large firms.
Overall, the analysis suggests that – at least 
in the time window examined - the decision to 
adopt an enterprise system was driven more by 
idiosyncratic and technical factors (solving the 
Year 2000 problem, upgrading the IT infrastruc-
ture) or by internal process optimization needs 
(improving business process performance, sup-
porting growth) than by the financial health of the 
organizations in the years prior to adoption. This 
confirms that the observed performance differ-
ences between adopters and non-adopters were 
actually driven by the operational improvements 
generated by the implementation of the software 
rather than by other contingent factors.

ERP-Driven Performance Changes and Process Isomorphism
Con CLUSIONSluon lmaon

fuueeeah
In this chapter we have shed some light on the 
relationship between ERP and business perfor-
mance. The panel data analysis of a sample of 
Italian manufacturing companies that adopted 
SAP R/3 between 1994 and 2002 provided several 
interesting insights.
First, the analysis confirmed the results of 
previous research in this area and suggested that 
the adoption of ERP exerts a positive effect on 
both productivity and profitability (ROA and 
ROE). Second, the results indicated the existence 
of a window of opportunity for adopting ERP. 
This is suggested by the fact that early adopters 
exhibit higher performance than late adopters and 
by the fact that the contribution of ERP adoption 
to performance improvements decreases as the 
number of adoptions increases. Finally the study 
clearly indicated that the widespread diffusion 
of a technology that embeds standard process 
templates decreases process heterogeneity and 
tends to level out performance differences among 
firms.
This result questions the role of ERP as a 
strategic tool. The pervasive diffusion of best 
practices may reduce the possibility that firms 
are able to use this technology to create strategic 
operational advantages in the long run. Yet, the 
results also suggest that in the short term there 
exist some windows of opportunities during which 
early adopters can obtain important productiv-
ity and profitability advantages from their ERP 
investments. While in the long run the massive 
adoption of enterprise solutions tends to level out 
performance differences (high-performing com-
panies become better, and low-performing com-
panies improve even more), the analysis clearly 
showed that early adopters enjoy higher returns 
than later adopters. This suggests the existence 
of strong first-mover advantage effects.
Our study makes several contributions. A first 
set of contributions is theoretical. The chapter 
contributes to the literature on the “IT paradox” 
by shedding additional light on the relationship 
between ERP investments and performance. It 
also clarifies the role of adoption timing in this 
process, which had been somewhat overlooked 
in the literature. A second set of contributions is 
methodological. We proposed the use of a fixed-
effect model as a correct econometric approach 
to estimate the panel data equations. We also 
devised a general method to measure changes 
in performance heterogeneity over time which 
overcomes the limitations of traditional vari-
ance-based measures. A third contribution is 
managerial. By quantifying the benefits of ERP 
as well as by identifying the conditions under 
which it may no longer guarantee the achievement

of competitive advantage, the chapter provides 
useful insights to firms that are investing or aim 
to invest in this technology.
Our results should be viewed in the context of 
some limitations. First, the target population of this 
study was narrowly defined to include a reason-
ably homogeneous set of firms that had purchased 
their ERP systems from a specific vendor and 
operated in a specific country. While a restrictive 
sampling approach enhances confidence that the 
findings are indeed a result of the hypothesized 
relationships, it may limit the generalizability of 
the research. Second, our study focused on the 
first and second generations of ERP systems, 
which are mainly aimed at streamlining internal 
business processes. With the advent of the network 
economy, organizations increasingly invest in 
IT to streamline processes not just within their 
own boundaries but especially across the value 
chain. This new generation of systems has greater 
complexity and a wider reach. As a consequence, 
it is likely to have a far greater impact on perfor-
mance. These observations point toward several 
avenues for future research. These pertain to the 
extension of our analysis to other industries, to 
other geographical regions and, especially, to 
other IT technologies.

Application Integration within 
the Enterprise Context

Abstracta
The application software life cycle considers the functionality of a given collection of components 
within the context of a consumer’s requirements definition. One set of requirements that are frequently 
overlooked are the requirements for application integration within the context of the enterprise environ-
ment. If an application creates vulnerabilities for other applications, is an administrative nightmare to 
maintain, or does not consider the security context required for execution; the application may not fulfill 
the intended requirements. This chapter addresses the question of the consideration of the enterprise 
information system’s administrative and execution context as a component of the application software 
development process. The potential impact these considerations have on the acceptance of an applica-
tion by the application’s user community is presented, with illustrations of some representative problem 
areas for the reader’s consideration.I
IntroductionTRCTI
During the software application development life 
cycle the primary emphasis is on fulfilling the 
user’s functional requirements.  For example, if 
an enterprise specifies a transaction based service 
that is initiated in response to a user request, the 
software development team takes great care in 
defining the format and contents of a transaction, 
the initiation logic, and the criteria for completion. 
The primary emphasis is placed upon application 
functionality, user and process interaction, and 
system verification. These processes are used to 
measure the success or failure of the application 
development team in meeting the user’s expecta-
tions.

  111
Application Integration within the Enterprise Context
Beyond the basic software development pro-
cesses, however, there are implicit requirements 
that require integration of an application within 
the enterprise’s operational infrastructure.    An 
application that is deployed on an independent 
server, with unlimited bandwidth, and its own 
user interface is a relative rarity in the current 
enterprise computing environment. 
To address the fact that various applications 
may share a processing infrastructure, the concept 
of a technical reference model has been developed. 
Technical reference models provide a blueprint 
for the coexistence of applications within a given 
enterprise.  However, a technical reference model 
may not address all the integration issues that can 
be anticipated in during the integration of a new 
application with the existing infrastructure.  An 
enterprise may support a specific user authentica-
tion process that relies upon digital certificates 
and directory services.   If the development team 
does not have access to these capabilities, the ap-
plication may not execute correctly when placed 
in the enterprise infrastructure.B
BackgroundCKR
The focus of the application development life 
cycle is the satisfaction of the functional require-
ments that must be fulfilled to address the user’s 
vision.  Applications are developed in response 
to perceived user needs, or requirements.   They 
collect, process, and present information from 
one or more sources to the user in a specified 
format.  The application is tasked with collect-
ing the information, providing analytical or pre-
sentation functions, and interacting with either 
the user or other applications as required.   The 
development process ensures that the application 
addresses the requirements as specified, and that 
these requirements are traceable and correctly 
allocated to various component elements of the 
application.
Few applications exist as independent entities 
that do not integrate with the other applications 
within an enterprise. Provisioning is defined as 
“a preparatory step in anticipation of some need” 
(Microsoft, 2003).  In the case of an enterprise 
application, this preparatory step is the integration 
of the application with the enterprise’s information 
technology infrastructure.   This infrastructure 
includes the network, servers, and other software 
applications.   The enterprise user or subscriber 
must also be made known to the application.  For 
example, Xuan Shi (2006) defines a provisioning 
context in which the application is responsible 
for providing:
•	
A valid user name and authentication mecha-
nism 
•	
The data source used in the application
•	
Using the combination to find the data re-
quested.
An application can only perform as expected 
if it has an ability to communicate within the en-
terprise to find its data, determine the authenticity 
of its users, and process the information requests. 
If an application cannot access and exercise the 
enterprise infrastructure, then it cannot function 
successfully within the enterprise’s information 
processing context.
ADDRESSINGRSSI THE TENTERPRISETRRIS 
CTT
The provisioning process facilitates enterprise 
application integration and verification activities. 
Provisioning should be the final step in the applica-
tion integration planning process.    Well executed, 
the enterprise infrastructure will be transparent 
to an application’s users.   Poorly accomplished, 
enterprise context integration activities can result 
in a cost and schedule nightmare.  If additional 
network capacity, hardware, or software licenses 
are required, these must be acquired through the 

112  
Application Integration within the Enterprise Context
corporate procurement processes.  The project 
may not have the budgetary reserve to address 
these issues if they are not considered during the 
early design phases of a project.
Further, if access privileges are not correctly 
established and testing during integration, user 
information access will become a nightmare. 
Access controls will not be deployed on a least 
privilege basis, but on the basis of what is expedient 
to gain a working application environment.  This 
may not be good security practice, but it does ac-
complish project implementation schedule goals. 
It may also leave the organization vulnerable to 
malicious code or information piracy.
Considering the provisioning process during 
the system development process forces the devel-
oper to consider the constraints on the application 
environment while there is still time to adapt the 
design to them.  Ignoring the enterprise context 
ensures additional complications and may require 
last minute corrective measures to integrate the 
application with the enterprise computing envi-
ronment.  To maintain flexibility and enforce an 
enterprise’s architecture standards, provisioning 
issues must be addressed throughout the develop-
ment process.
Provisioning extends from the network in-
frastructure, to the hardware platform, the sup-
porting software environment, the applications, 
and the user.  With the integration of physical 
security systems into the information technol-
ogy infrastructure (Alliance for Enterprise Se-
curity Risk Management, 2006), provisioning 
becomes a cradle-to-grave user function that is 
part of the user’s employment lifecycle within 
an enterprise.  
Figure 1 illustrates this activity flow.
Decomposing the Enterprise CoCntext
Yuri Pikover and John Drake (2006) presents a 
comprehensive set of checklists to ensure that 
an application developer addresses the contex-
tual constraints a given enterprise infrastructure 
may place upon an application.  These checklists 
provide an audit template that can be used to 
validate a provisioning process. This model is 
adapted in Figure 2, and described in the follow-
ing paragraphs.

Application Integration within the Enterprise Context
A development assumption that an enterprise 
has sufficient network bandwidth and processing 
power to address a given application’s communi-
cations requirements may not be a prudent act. 
Applications may require large volumes of data 
originating from multiple sources, all of which 
require network capacity to migrate the eventual 
result to the target client system.  The network 
management team usually maintains a margin 
of excess capacity to accommodate new applica-
tions and occasional peak traffic loads. However, 
there is no guarantee that an existing network 
infrastructure can accommodate increased traf-
fic loads without coordination with the network 
infrastructure maintenance personnel.
An additional consideration is the backup and 
recovery infrastructure required for continuity 
of operations. If an application is critical to the 
organization’s operation, it should be integrated 
into the organizational contingency management 
plan.  An application developer that assumes all 
transactions are written to recovery logs may have 
to make alternate arrangements if the operations 
team has a policy to limit transaction log size. 
Data replication and backups during off peak 
hours may not be possible if network capacity is 
not in place to support these operations.
Measurement of network bandwidth require-
ments both from the client and the processing 
infrastructure perspective should be accomplished 
during the system development process.   Projected 
bandwidth calculations should be compared to 
actual network traffic generated by an application, 
or the application subscribers may be faced with 
unacceptable network performance.  That is other 
applications may pay a performance penalty for 
a network traffic intensive application if there is 
contention for network resources. Advance coordi-
nation with the network team allows them to plan 
sufficient network capacity, establish bandwidth 
management parameters and projected rate limits 
for specific applications. 
Platform provisioning activities focus on the 
processing power, memory, and disk sizing as-
sociated with the server hosting the application. 
Development platforms usually support excess 
resource capacities to facilitate the development 
and debugging process.  If an application will be 
installed on a shared production platform, it may 
develop resource contention issues.  Memory or 
disk space may be at a premium, or a given suite 
of network protocols may not be installed on a 
given device.    
If an application expects to have unlimited 
access to data from diverse sources, there may 
be contention and conflict in resource access. 
Queries that are compute intensive may execute 
flawlessly and quickly in a development lab, but 
have unacceptable response times in the produc-
tion environment.   In these cases, live data trials 
can be applied to optimize resource allocations and 
access requirements.  For example, an application 
that routinely accesses a remote server may benefit 
from a shadow server being established locally. 
Both network bandwidth and user performance 
may be more satisfactory if the data was moved 
closer to the end user.
Application processing priorities may need to 
be established.  An application that has no resource 
contention in an isolated development environ-
ment may be constantly waiting for responses

Application Integration within the Enterprise Context
when faced with competition and contention 
among other applications. In this situation, priori-
ties and pre-emption strategies may have to be 
considered.  If every user considers his process-
ing requests the highest priority need within the 
organization, the information technologist has 
to apply prioritization across the enterprise to 
address the needs of all user requests.
A step in the provisioning process that may 
be missed is the configuration of middleware ser-
vices, the supporting software that facilitates the 
application.   With the emergence of services-ori-
ented architecture (SOA) development paradigms, 
there may be several layers of software utilities 
and supporting applications that are required to 
execute a given application.  A key consideration 
in using software utilities and services is software 
usage licensing.   Developers may underestimate 
the number of concurrent licenses which are re-
quired to support a given application, or a utility 
may be used by many applications and exhaust the 
supply of license keys.  This can lead to resource 
contention issues, licensing noncompliance, or 
locked out user accounts. 
An application is usually installed within an 
operational network infrastructure, the issues 
associated with that integration are corrected, 
and the application is never touched again.  The 
subscribers or users of an application may have 
frequent account or privilege modifications based 
on personnel activities such as hiring, termina-
tions, and promotions.   When a subscriber moves 
to an alternate role in an enterprise, the access 
privileges or authentication requirements associ-
ated with that role may also change.  Access rights 
have to be modified and propagated throughout 
the enterprise. These activities can be greatly 
facilitated with provisioning software products.
A subscriber’s identification and authentication 
credentials must be updated when they expire.  For 
example, if a password is changed, or a digital cer-
tificate has been revoked, the user’s authentication 
data has also been changed.   Updating account 
information is a relatively simple task in a small 
enterprise, but when business is conducted on a 
global scale changes must be propagated rapidly 
and efficiently. Beyond account revocation, as 
users move throughout the enterprise their ac-
cess rights may change as well.  These changes 
must be reflected across the enterprise in a timely 
fashion, or the user will not be able to accomplish 
the required tasks.  Privileged roles provide ap-
plication users with the capability to modify cor-
porate databases. These capabilities can subvert 
the integrity of corporate data. For example, sales 
figures can be modified and executive decisions 
made based on faulty information.  
When an application spans multiple enter-
prises, it is possible that the management hi-
erarchy is not uniform among the cooperating 
enterprises. For example, a vice president may 
have financial responsibilities in one division, but 
a vice president in another division may not have 
financial control.  The application development 
team should be sensitive to such organizational 
distinctions and have an infrastructure in place 
with the flexibility to map subscriber roles and 
responsibilities across diverse organizational 
management hierarchies.
Additional Benefits of Enterprise C
Context IntegrationI
Consideration of the enterprise information con-
text in the provisioning process can be used to 
enforce conformance to enterprise architecture 
standards.  For example, in Murat Erder’s  and 
Pierre Pureur’s work (2006) the concept of a series 
of architecture standards is introduced.  Over 
time, an information technology organization 
could gradually evolve an enterprise from the 
current model to the future desired state model. 
An organization could start out with a simple 
user database and evolve to a comprehensive 
X.500 directory based environment in a series 
of steps. 
Incorporation of an enterprise’s information 
infrastructure through the provisioning process 

  115
Application Integration within the Enterprise Context
allows an organization to enforce policy standards 
in a uniform and efficient manner.   If a corporation 
determines that data can be accessed remotely, but 
only during business hours when the help desk 
can provide technical support, that policy can be 
readily enforced with a directory based solution. 
Users with a remote access attribute can have the 
access hours modified to reflect the corporation’s 
business hours.  Similarly, an enterprise might 
choose to enforce a policy that particular data-
bases may only be accessed at a corporate facility. 
Such location-based policies can be established 
and enforced with a centralized user management 
infrastructure. Consideration of such constraints 
during the application development process can 
allow the developer to focus on the application’s 
core functionality and minimize duplication of 
system service functions.	
FUTURE TRENDSTRTRS
The provisioning of an enterprise application is 
gradually becoming a more automated process. 
As infrastructures grow and incorporate more 
location-based technologies, it becomes more 
difficult to ensure that all applications understand 
the current enterprise context.  Promising tech-
nologies include active networks and autonomous 
provisioning languages.
Active Networks
	
Active, or aware networks, react and adapt to 
dynamic changes in the enterprise infrastructure. 
In this context, the network management func-
tion monitors bandwidth consumption, potential 
security issues, and access violations, adapting 
the network posture if required.   Francine Krief 
(2004) states the four functions of an aware 
network are:
1.	
Self-configuration – configuration of com-
ponents
2.	
Self-optimization – seeking to improve 
performance and effectiveness
3.	
Self-healing – detection, diagnosis, and re-
pairing hardware and software problems
4.	
Self-protection – protecting the system from 
attacks or cascading failures by anticipation 
of the network’s response.
For example, if a given user is consuming high 
percentages of the network’s available bandwidth, 
an active network will adjust the user’s bandwidth 
allocation according to a specified quality of 
service (Krief, 2004).  
 In the increasingly network centric informa-
tion environment, an application must establish the 
user’s resource allocations and is responsible for 
enforcement of enterprise governance constraints 
on the user’s environment.  Within the enterprise 
context, the application developer should verify 
the bandwidth, privileges, and performance uti-
lization factors as part of the development life 
cycle.S
Standardization of Protocols 
and Processes
There are two emerging provisioning standards 
that are gaining a foothold in the marketplace: 
1.	
The Service Provisioning Markup Language 
(SPML), and 
2.	
The J2EE provisioning environment.
The Service Provisioning Markup Language 
standard (OASIS, 2006) is being promulgated by 
the Organization for the Advancement of Struc-
tured Information Standards (OASIS) Provision-
ing Services Technical Committee (PSTC).  SPML 
defines an XML-based framework for exchanging 
user, resource, and service provisioning informa-
tion.  The Technical Committee specification is 
an end-to-end, open, provisioning specification 
that includes the following components:

116  
Application Integration within the Enterprise Context
•	
Active Digital Profile (ADPr)
•	
eXtensible Resource Provisioning Manage-
ment (XRPM) 
•	
Information Technology Markup Language 
(ITML) 
SPML is an “overlay” language, in that it ex-
pects to work in conjunction with a Lightweight 
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) metadata 
model (Internet Engineering Task Force, 1997). 
SPML defines a set of formatted request/response 
structures and the legal attribute/value pairs that 
comprise the query/response format.   It expects 
that each end user will have a standard X.509 
Distinguished Name, and that some sort of digital 
trust relationship exists between the requesting 
authority and the provisioning service provider 
(Internet Engineering Task Force, 1999).   An 
overview of SPML interaction is provided in 
Figure 3.
The SPML standard is now at version 2.0. 
SPML has been adopted by several integrated 
solution vendors such as Computer Associates 
and IBM as a method of providing transparent 
interoperability in heterogeneous enterprise 
environments.  An SPML compliant application 
accommodates registration and configuration of 
user accounts in response to an authorized request. 
This capability will become increasingly neces-
sary as service oriented architectures become 
more commonplace.
For Java based applications, the J2EE Client 
Provisioning Specification (Sun Microsystems, 
2003) serves the same purpose as SPML, but it 
is specific to the J2EE application development 
environment.  The Java language is very popular, 
and by defining a set of standard libraries for 
client provisioning, third party software appli-
cations are more readily created and integrated 
into existing Java based environments.   Figure 4 
illustrates the J2EE Client Provisioning Specifica-
tion architecture.
In the J2EE model, a provisioning API pro-
vides the interface to the provisioning application, 
which, in turn, accesses the enterprise services 
that provide essential provisioning information. 
In this regard, it is very similar to SPML, but it 
is a Java based architectural instantiation instead 
of XML.  
Enterprise infrastructure vendors such as IBM, 
Computer Associates, and Sun Microsystems 
all support products that facilitate middleware 
and user provisioning.  These products provide 
a centralized user interface for account registra-

tion, maintenance, and privilege management 
functions.    In most cases, these applications also 
provide a recovery and propagation capability 
to ensure change management is effectively ac-
complished throughout the enterprise.  
 Consultancies such as Gartner frequently 
survey the commercial marketplace (Witty, Ant, 
and Wagner, 2006) to determine standard features 
and emerging trends.    If an enterprise has ad-
opted an infrastructure management paradigm 
and tool suite, the integration capabilities of the 
tool suite are also used to facilitate adaptation of 
new applications to the enterprise’s processing 
context.  C
CONCLUSIONCSI
Integration of the application within the con-
straints of the enterprise’s processing context is an 
often overlooked aspect of system development. 
Without careful early consideration, performance 
modeling and possibly simulation, an application 
environment may not meet user expectations.  An 
application that requires additional expenditures 
for improved performance creates hidden costs 
for the enterprise. The final application integra-
tion process proceeds in a more orderly fashion 
when the contextual constraints of the enterprise 
environment are considered throughout the 
development process. The choice, like so many 
others in system development, is simple:  invest 
resources and pay attention to the enterprise’s 
operating constraints early, or invest more heavily 
in later program phases when time and resources 
are at a premium.

Abstracta
A significant investment in resources is required for implementation of integrated enterprise systems as 
technology solutions while the effectiveness of these systems to achieve business value remains unclear 
and empirically largely unexplored. Enterprise systems integrate and automate business processes, but 
unarguably, the real business value can only be achieved from improvements through the transformation 
of enterprise systems data into knowledge by applying analytic and decision making processes. This study 
explores a model of transforming ES data into knowledge and results by comparing two case studies 
that examine the impact of enterprise systems information on organizational functions and processes 
leading to realization of business value.I
IntroductionTRCTI
The implementation of enterprise systems has 
been considered the most important development 
in corporate use of information technology (Dav-
enport, 1995, 1998; Davenport & Prusak, 1998; 
Deloitte, 1998). Enterprise systems (ES) broadly 
include all enterprise-wide systems. These include 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems or any 
extended modules such as supply chain manage-
ment (SCM) or customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM) systems. However, despite a few 

120  
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business Value
dramatic successes, many organizations still fail 
to realize the benefits while incurring huge costs 
and schedule overruns (Dalal, Kamath, Kolarik, 
& Sivaraman, 2004). It has been estimated that 
half of all ES implementations fail to achieve the 
desired results (Jarra, Al-Mudimigh, & Zairi, 
2000). In most cases enterprise systems are imple-
mented to improve organizational effectiveness 
(Davenport, 1998, 2000; Marcus & Tanis, 2000). 
These software applications connect and manage 
information flows across complex organizations, 
allowing managers to make decisions based on 
information that accurately reflects the current 
state of their business (Davenport, Harris, & 
Cantrell, 2002). 
These systems are implemented to bring about 
definite business benefits that justify the invest-
ment. Truly significant return on investment (ROI) 
comes from the process improvements that ES 
supports and not just from improved information 
access. In most implementations, ES software 
alone makes marginal improvement in business 
performance. If organizations continue to follow 
the same pre-ES business processes after imple-
mentation, they can expect the same or possibly 
worse performance. ES software can, however, 
enable and support many new and improved 
processes, but not without the organization decid-
ing what those processes are and committing to 
them. Positive ROI can come from changing the 
way business was performed in the past to more 
streamlined, faster and lower cost processes that 
better serve the needs of the customer and, if that 
is done well, the organization  will be a winner 
(Donovan, 2003).
The focus of this paper is to better understand 
the effectiveness of enterprise systems technology 
in an organizational setting. A qualitative research 
methodology is used to explore how firms can 
leverage ES technologies to realize improved 
business value. Field studies were conducted in 
two large manufacturing organizations in India 
that have implemented ESs, in order to understand 
their experience in achieving growth by leveraging 
data from their ES investment. Semi-structured in-
terviews were conducted with senior managers of 
the two organizations between January 2005 and 
February 2006. The empirical data were integrated 
and analysed to formulate inferences presented 
in this paper. Both organizations had aggressive 
growth plans with an objective to achieve better 
penetration capability into the competitive market 
by improving their operations.  Both organizations 
had implemented ES for at least three years and 
so were in their mature phase of implementation. 
One organization had achieved considerable suc-
cess from their ES implementation whereas the 
other had achieved little success. The two cases 
are compared to identify reasons for their levels 
of success.B
Business BenefitsSISSBITS
The justification for adopting ES centres on an-
ticipated business benefits from the ES. To receive 
benefit from an ES, there must be no misunder-
standing of what it is about, its usability, and, 
even more importantly, organizational decision 
makers must have the background and tempera-
ment for this type of decision making coupled 
with the right quality of information (Donovan, 
1998). Many researchers have evaluated benefits 
from ES investments (Cooke & Peterson, 1998; 
Davenport et al., 2002; Deloitte, 1998; Donovan, 
1998, 2001; Hedman & Borell, 2002; Ittner & 
Larcker, 2003; Shang & Seddon, 2000; Yang & 
Seddon, 2004). These studies have found that 
ES’s are designed to help manage organizational 
resources in an integrated manner. Furthermore, 
the level of integration that is promoted across 
functions in an enterprise closely relates to the 
primary benefits that are expected as a result of 
their implementation. After adoption, improved 
business performance should produce both opera-
tional and strategic benefits (Irving, 1999; Jenson 
& Johnson, 2002; Nicolaou, 2004).

  121
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business Value
A study of 85 global companies (Deloitte, 
1998) found tangible benefits (e.g. cost savings, 
faster processing) and intangible benefits (e.g., 
improved information visibility, new/improved 
processes, and improved customer responsive-
ness) from ES implementation. In a survey of 
163 large firms (Davenport et al., 2002) key 
benefits realized by organizations adopting ES 
included better management decision making, 
improved customer service and retention, ease 
of expansion/growth, increased flexibility, faster 
and more accurate transactions, cost reduction, 
and increased revenue. There have also been 
some studies on organizational benefits resulting 
from overlapping implementation of knowledge 
management (KM) and ES in organizational 
settings (e.g., Newell, Huang, Galliers, & Pan, 
2003; Baskerville, Pawlowski, & McLean, 2000; 
Bendoly, 2002). However, this paper focuses on 
the impact of ES on realizing business value 
through the process of ES data transformation 
into knowledge by applying analytic and deci-
sion-making processes. This study attempts to 
establish the link between data, decisions, and 
actions, its impact on functional and business 
processes, and their outcomes.T
Turning ES Data into ESRISTITS 
K
A model conceptualized and used by Davenport 
(2000) and his team of researchers for turning 
ES data into ES knowledge is shown in figure 
1. The model comprises three major steps. The 
first is the context. This includes the factors that 
must be present for transformation of ES data into 
knowledge and results. The second is transforma-
tion of ES data into knowledge which takes place 
when the data are actually analyzed and then used 
to support a business decision. The third are the 
outcomes which are the events that change as a 
result of the analysis and implementation of the 
decisions made. As Davenport’s model shows, the 
process of ES data transformation into knowledge 
leads into organizational changes. The most basic 
potential outcome of this process is the changes 
in behaviors of individual managers, employees, 
customers, suppliers, and all stakeholders in the 
value chain. Another outcome from the decisions 
or the behavioral changes may be new initia-
tives to bring about improvements in business 
or make changes in existing projects. The results 
of decisions can also include process changes 
– determining that an existing process is not 
working effectively can lead to changes in the 
existing process or design and implementation 
of an entirely new process. The ultimate results 
of all these activities are the business benefits 
which lead to positive financial impacts for the 
organization. “Decisions lead to new behaviors, 
new initiatives, and processes, which do not 
matter unless they improve the bottom line and 
the return to share holders” (Davenport, 2000) 
p. 225). It may be difficult to draw a direct chain 
of influence from prerequisites to transformation 
to non-financial outcomes to financial results, but 
establishing that linkage should be the objective of 
an organization that invests effort and resources 
in ES data transformation (Davenport, 2000) and 
is the focus of this study. 
The two case studies are presented next and the 
discussion follows Davenport’s model- context, 
transformation, and outcomes for both cases as 
shown in Figure 1.C

of the most technologically advanced commercial 
forge shops in the world. Growel has been a pub-
licly traded company whose stock has appreciated 
more than 200 percent since March 2004. With 
manufacturing facilities in India and Germany, the 
company manufactures a wide range of forgings 
and machined components for the automotive, die-
sel engine, railway, earthmoving, cement, sugar, 
steel, coal, ship building, and oilfield industries. 
An ISO 9001:2000, ISO/TS 16949:2002 accredited 
company, Growel is internationally reputed for 
its cutting edge technology, established quality 
processes, and capabilities to meet the exacting 
standards of the most demanding customers in 
the world. Growel Limited is a global corporation 
with world class engineering capabilities, state-
of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and a global 
customer base that includes General Motors,

Volvo, Caterpillar – Perkins, and several others. 
It is the largest manufacturer of axle components 
for heavy trucks and has a 35% global market 
share, with a 10% global market share in engine 
components. The following sections discuss how 
Growel leveraged knowledge-driven technologies 
to improve business dynamics with considerable 
success. The discussion follows Davenport’s 
model – context, transformation, outcomes – as 
shown in Figure 1.C
Context: StSrategic 
Growel’s journey towards becoming an interna-
tional e-business began in the late 1990’s. The 
company wanted to grow exports, widen its global 
footprint, secure new customers, become the 
world’s largest manufacturer of axle components, 
and be a key global provider of engine components. 
To achieve these goals, Growel planned to double 
its manufacturing capacity by implementing a 
major capacity expansion program. However, 
this involved large investments and risks. The 
company had to resort to major cost controls, 
improve operational efficiencies and optimize its 
business processes to counter the adverse financial 
effects of the major investments. Senior managers 
in the company decided to pursue a strategy of 
operational excellence. The company historically 
lacked integration between its order-to-cash, ship-
ping, and accounts receivable processes. There

were disputes on invoices and purchase orders 
relating to price and terms of business. There 
was a lack of visibility into finished goods inven-
tory and overall accuracy of inventory was poor. 
Visibility of material requirements and inventory 
throughout the value chain was inadequate and 
did not provide decision support at all stages of 
operations.
The company had not integrated the design and 
development practices with the operational sys-
tems; therefore the time lag between development 
and marketing of products was large and resulted 
in poor customer service and dissatisfaction. The 
pre-production approval process was another 
aspect which required attention. The company 
needed the ability to interactively participate 
with its customers at the early stages of product 
development and avoid rework at a later stage. 
The product forecasting process also required im-
provements. Managers only discovered that they 
had a shortage of manufacturing capacity when 
the line ran out. On the sales side, management 
had limited visibility of who its most and least 
profitable customers and products were. They 
also did not have information on whether they 
were buying in the most cost effective manner. 
The management team recognized what types of 
decisions had to be made to support their strate-
gic objectives but could not utilize the available 
operational data. C
Context: Organizational and C
Cultural 
A company is as good as its people and Growel 
has the advantage of having a highly qualified and 
motivated manpower base. Since its inception, 
Growel has attached great significance to “people 
power” and considers its employees as important 
assets. With interactive communications at all 
levels, Growel continues to provide a congenial 
and peaceful working atmosphere to its employ-
ees. In the process of ES implementation, the 
organizational and cultural elements were aligned 
to support the use of transaction data at Growel. 
The compensation system was also changed to 
reward sales people for sales volume and profit to 
include a fixed and variable component of pay. The 
company created a friendly atmosphere within the 
organization which fostered orientation to change. 
The organization also adopted a data-oriented 
culture and encouraged employees to use data 
to support any business decision.C
Context: Skills and KnSKowledge
 
Growel has always had a high quality, motivated 
work force. The company employs about two 
thousand workmen of which over four hundred 
are engineers with a high ability to learn and 
implement modern manufacturing methods us-
ing high tech equipment. The company provides 
extensive training both in house and externally, 
including overseas exposure. Within the group 
of knowledge workers and analysts, the skills 
include detailed knowledge of the organization’s 
underlying business processes. They possess 
extensive skills for interpreting the SAP data, 
including understanding how key elements relate 
and their limitations for analysis. They also have 
a thorough working knowledge of several analytic 
and data presentation software packages, along 
with strong interpersonal skills to train and sup-
port end users.C
Context: Data 
Issues of data quality were less at Growel, where 
transaction data captured in the SAP system were 
created internally based on all transactions from 
sales orders to shipping invoices. Monitoring and 
updating of data was a regular feature at Growel 
and the transaction data was made available in a 
timely fashion to support decision making.

124  
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business ValueC
Context: Technology T
Growel had historically been using a home-
grown legacy system which provided disparate 
information which lacked proper integration and 
utilization. However, this lack of operational data 
to support decision making changed with the 
implementation of SAP’s R/3 in 2000-01. The 
modules implemented were finance, sales and 
distribution, materials management, production 
management, and human resources. The company 
now had unprecedented visibility into its opera-
tions and customer base. SAP business intelligence 
tools were extensively used to extract, analyze, 
and develop adhoc reports.
Tansformation
The transformation process at Growel was a result 
of putting knowledge-leveraging activities into 
action. How this happened is explained next. The 
value creation process was initially described in 
detail to gain an in-depth understanding of where 
and how Growel adds value for its customers. A 
critical success factor framework for each func-
tional area was developed and a strong linkage 
between departmental performance indicators 
and top-level metrics for gauging the effective-
ness of company strategy was put in place. Task 
groups within each functional area translated the 
general framework into team-specific programs 
to leverage innovations for achieving strategic 
goals and plans. 
The model was shared with all the relevant team 
players. Descriptive indicators of the improvement 
and corrective-action plans were identified to 
facilitate decision making. The implementation 
plans for these decisions to achieve the desired 
results along with the steps to create the results 
were identified. Forms were designed to describe 
these plans and their measures. The indicators 
were documented choosing the reference for 
benchmarking and external validation along the 
time-line. The analytical process was the means 
by which ES data became knowledge. The SAP 
data, required for each of the indicators were 
identified, extracted, and interpreted, to create 
useful information for monitoring the progress for 
achieving the objectives. The signals and messages 
coming from each indicator were analyzed and 
evaluated to support decision-making. The deci-
sion-making process was based on high-quality, 
well-analyzed ES data on a multitude of factors. 
Some key areas where ES data were utilized for 
improvements were customer and product profit-
ability analysis, price/volume analysis, market and 
customer segment analysis, sales forecasting and 
operations planning analysis. All actions likely 
to improve the likelihood that the result will be 
coherent with the strategic intent were identified, 
evaluated, and implemented.  
Outcomes: C Changing Behaviors B
One of the major outcomes from the initiatives 
described above was changing behaviors. Im-
proved information sharing, transparency, and 
openness with customers, suppliers, employees, 
and all stakeholders resulted in improved inter-
personal and business relations. Having easy 
access to invoice and purchase order data enabled 
Growel to improve price synchronization with 
customers and suppliers. The earlier disputes on 
invoices and purchase orders relating to price 
and terms of business diminished. The online 
visibility of demand and supplies with customers 
and suppliers through the integrated supply chain 
management (SCM) system led to less volatility 
in sudden spurts of demand which existed earlier. 
This resulted in more streamlined supplies and 
a dramatic change in customer and supplier be-
havior since Growel could react better to change 
orders now and was able to be more flexible in 
the manufacturing environment.  

  125
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business Value
Outcomes: New Initiatives I
The ability to analyze customer and product 
profitability lead to a new initiative of value 
engineering to improve or change the design to 
make the product more profitable. Unprofitable 
products and customers were identified and the 
division’s existing unprofitable product lines were 
replaced by more profitable new product lines. 
New initiatives towards implementing just-in-
time inventory systems were undertaken, which 
decreased inventory costs substantially.
Outcomes: Process ChCanges 
Growel recognized that the SAP data created 
opportunities for redesigning some business 
processes which could create entirely new sets 
of decisions. Growel is moving at full speed to 
re-design some business processes and build e-
commerce applications with SAP as a backbone 
for their legacy systems and other collaborative 
software like SCM (Supply Chain Management) 
and PLM (Product Lifecycle Management). SAP 
provides capabilities such as CRP (Capacity 
Resource Planning), and BPR (Business Process 
Re-engineering) which offer powerful links 
within the entire value chain from customers to 
suppliers. The company has set up an integrated 
supply chain management system which enables 
real-time visibility of material requirements and 
inventory throughout the value chain and provides 
decision support at all stages of operations. With 
a majority of the company’s suppliers receiving 
supply chain data, the company has a real-time 
total demand management system in place. A 
virtual private marketplace has been created for 
Growel through which the company engages in 
e-procurement and reverse auctions. The company 
has already started selling scrap online. 
In a development that will substantially reduce 
product development time and bring the company 
closer to its customer, Growel is in the process of 
implementing a Collaborative Product Commerce 
(CPC) module. CPC will enable the company 
to work online with its customers to design and 
develop products and share information and 
knowledge with the customers. This will reduce 
product development time and costs and, more 
importantly, forge close ties with the customers 
from early stages of product development.C
CASE STUDY 2SSTC
Company Overview
Primemover2 is a multi-faceted engineering 
enterprise. Established in 1859, Primemover 
is one of India’s leading and well-diversified 
engineering companies with a US$500 million 
turnover. The company’s core competencies are 
in diesel/petrol engines, power generating sets 
(gensets), agricultural and construction equip-
ment. The business operations of the company are 
divided into various business groups strategically 
structured to ensure maximum focus on each 
business area and yet retain a unique synergy in 
the operations. The business groups are power 
generation, agricultural equipment, light engines, 
and infrastructure equipment. Primemover has six 
manufacturing plants located at several locations 
in India. The company has an extensive sales and 
service network manned by a highly skilled and 
dedicated workforce. 
The power generation group of Primemover 
designs and manufactures diesel engines and 
gensets for industry sectors such as power, oil and 
gas, construction, earthmoving, and transporta-
tion and supplies to various countries all over 
the world. The unit employs about 1,200 people. 
Originally Primemover only manufactured diesel 
engines. In 1993 the company collaborated with 
a German company to include gensets in order 
to extend its range of products, to develop a more 
complete supply capability to the engine manufac-
turing industry, and to position the company for 
long-term growth. Both product ranges served as 

126  
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business Value
solution providers for their customers, provided 
products with a large-range of kva and hp ratings. 
The synergies created by the integration of the 
two product ranges enabled better designs and 
product offerings. Specifically, customers had 
more effective, one-stop access to a comprehensive 
range of products as well as simplified commer-
cial relationships. By enabling improved service 
to customers, the integration of the two product 
lines enhanced the market position of the power 
generation group of Primemover. However, the 
company realized that it would face challenges to 
ensure its profitable growth in the long term.
 C
Context: StSrategic 
Primemover was one of the few companies that 
were full-line supplier of the entire product range 
in industry markets however; the company was 
facing growing challenges. Despite increased 
demand resulting from a healthy growing market, 
greater competition in its core markets and high 
operating costs could inhibit the achievement of 
financial returns expected from its operations. 
Primemover had to overcome the competition, and 
leverage the new opportunities to ensure profit-
able growth for the future. To compete effectively, 
Primemover needed to improve its supply chain 
performance and cost; the business processes of 
the two product lines were not performing at the 
levels necessary to grow profitably in the emerg-
ing competitive environment. The time frames 
required to commit to delivery of finished goods 
to customers were not competitive; customer order 
handling and service processes were complex; 
operations were not sufficiently flexible to enable 
rapid response to shifting demand; market share 
was not growing rapidly; and inventory-carry-
ing costs and other expenses inhibited achieve-
ment of adequate financial returns. These chal-
lenges were compounded by the fact that 60% of 
Primemover diesel engine and genset parts were 
externally sourced and there were long lead times 
for products such as pistons from Germany and 
turbochargers from UK. Forecast accuracy was 
low, inventory data and related information were 
inaccurate. Thus, key goals for Primemover in-
cluded enhancing its ability to respond to customer 
requirements, improving market share, and reduc-
ing costs throughout the operation. Primemover 
determined that it must improve its supply chain 
planning and execution capabilities to improve its 
operations in order to achieve better penetration 
capability into the competitive market, which was 
their prime objective.C
Context: Organizational and C
Cultural 
Primemover has an overall employee base of about 
three thousand employees and has a change-ori-
ented organizational culture. Primemover enjoys 
the enviable reputation of being one of the few 
corporates that has successfully maintained 
harmonious human relations year after year and 
the credit for this goes to all its employees who 
have always been open to and welcomed change. 
The organization structure is collaborative and 
the compensation system is aligned to achieving 
goals.C
Context: SkSills and KnKowledge 
Out of the three thousand workmen Primemover 
employs, over five hundred are qualified engineers 
having technical and commercial expertise. The 
company has hired mostly skilled workmen in the 
last fifteen years. The company has been providing 
on-going training and development to upgrade the 
skills and knowledge of its employees including 
knowledge of the organization’s underlying busi-
ness processes.
C ntext: Data 
Quality of data was not an area of focus for 
Primemover prior to ES implementation. The 
maintenance of data records was not consistent and 

  127
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business Value
discrepancies were often encountered in the data 
records. There was a lack of discipline in updating 
transactions in the warehouse which would lead 
to stock and other data discrepancies. This lack of 
accuracy and currency of information led to data 
integrity issues amongst employees. The tools for 
data extraction were also inadequate. Availability 
of transactional data and information was an issue. 
Data extracts could not be made easily available 
and in time to support decision making.C
Context: TeTchnology 
Primemover realized a need to couple its execu-
tion systems with a new class of supply chain 
planning software to address its requirements in 
the future. After considering various software 
solutions and determining the business strategy, 
the company selected SAP R/3 to be the foun-
dation of the planning system for its integrated 
operations. Primemover had historically been 
using an internally-developed system which 
provided disparate information that lacked proper 
integration and utilization. However, the situation 
changed with the implementation of SAP’s R/3 
in 2000-01. The company implemented financial, 
sales and distribution, production management, 
human resources along with Web-enabled supply 
chain management systems. Primemover now had 
better visibility into its operations and customer 
base. Standard reports from SAP and Microsoft’s 
Excel were used to analyze and report data.T
Transformation
The transformation process at Primemover was 
based on the information from the SAP system. 
The available SAP data were utilized, interpreted, 
and analyzed in various areas of operations to sup-
port decision-making for achieving the company’s 
strategic objectives. Standard reports from the 
SAP system were used and evaluated on a regular 
basis to support decision-making. Many of these 
reports were transformed into Excel spreadsheets 
to facilitate application of analytical processes. 
The decision-making process was based on well-
analyzed ES data on a multitude of factors.
However the organization’s business strategy 
needed more alignment into departmental and 
divisional strategies. The definition of informa-
tion critical to the success of the organization was 
missing. This was evident by a remark from one 
of the interviewees when he said “there was a lot 
of confusion on what is to be achieved, which 
data needs to be analysed, where it is to be ap-
plied and to achieve what results”. The analytical 
and decision-making process was based on ES 
data which were not very accurate. There was 
a lack of timely availability of data extracts to 
support analytical decision making and the link 
between data, decisions, and actions was missing. 
Some key areas where ES data were utilized for 
improvements were market and sales forecasting 
and operations planning analysis, theory of con-
straints in manufacturing analysis, raw material 
cost analysis, inventory analysis, activity-based 
costing, and process efficiency analysis.
Outcomes: ChCanging BehaviorsB
As a result of implementing an ES, the attitude 
of customers, suppliers, employees, and all stake-
holders improved but did not reach the levels 
expected since inaccuracies were still present in 
the historical data. The online visibility of demand 
and supplies with customers and suppliers through 
the integrated SCM system reduced the number 
of out-of-inventory events, but did not achieve 
the reduction and streamlining of inventories 
anticipated. The lead times could not be reduced 
substantially and delivery performance improved 
marginally. The supply issues from vendors and 
customers continued and dramatic overall im-
provement in behaviors was not achieved.

128  
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business Value
Outcomes: New Initiatives I
With some ability to analyze demand and with 
the information now visible, the company imple-
mented the following changes to its supply chain 
processes. Primemover analyzed its various mar-
ket and customer segments, determined the service 
requirements for these segments, and classified 
products according to volume and variability of 
demand. Primemover established monthly sales-
forecasting and operations-planning meetings 
where the supply-and-demand plans were formally 
reviewed; performance of locally produced and 
imported product was considered; exceptions 
and unique requirements were brought up for 
discussion; and market intelligence and longer-
term constraints in material and production were 
factored into plans.
Outcomes: Process ChCanges 
In order to shorten lead times, reduce inventory, 
and increase throughput, Primemover employed 
a “theory of constraints” model, establishing 
processes to identify critical material and capacity 
constraints – and to optimize these constraints 
in its manufacturing operations on an ongoing 
basis. As operations of the two product lines 
were unified, customer account numbers were 
merged; SKUs were combined; and the number 
of warehouses was reduced from five to three. 
These consolidations required considerable 
revamping of numbering schemes and physical 
storage strategies. Warehouse consolidation was 
coupled with improved policies associated with 
material movement, virtually eliminating the 
need to transfer material between locations once 
received. Due to better tracking of material and a 
substantial reduction of the need to move mate-
rial multiple times, costs for damaged and lost 
material declined from 1.60% to 0.78% of sales. 
Also, strategically significant and measurable 
improvements to inventory, cost, and customer 
service were achieved.
Forecast accuracy improved as the company 
gained experience with sales forecasting and op-
erations planning. The new processes also gave 
visibility into material requirements for sched-
uled orders and further facilitated procurement 
planning. Primemover had earlier been placing 
large, irregular orders monthly or bimonthly with 
its suppliers but is now placing regular weekly 
orders, improving its suppliers’ abilities to plan 
and thereby improving Primemover’s negotiat-
ing position. The store manager at Primemover 
remarked that the suppliers and customers were 
now giving “fewer headaches” with the new sys-
tem. Primemover’s customers are also able to plan 
better due to the company’s improved forecasts. 
Resolution of manufacturing constraints has 
improved production throughput by 20%. Daily 
cycle counting has enabled inventory accuracy to 
advance from 52% to more than 80%, which has 
facilitated a reduction in the levels of raw materi-
als and finished goods. Finally, many employees 
are undertaking what-if analyses with the range 
of available data, further improving planning and 
execution across the supply chain. Primemover 
has chosen to integrate related product lines, 
establish supply chain channels to match sup-
ply-and-demand streams, and resolve constraints 
in its manufacturing network. The company 
recognizes that its process designs are not static 
and that its business and enabling systems will 
continue to evolve in line with market demands. 
Ongoing achievements in cost reductions and 
customer service improvements have enabled 
Primemover to make continual improvements in 
market position, premium pricing opportunities, 
and financial return.R
RESULTS ASTSND FINANCIALICI 
ICTS
Growel has surpassed the last full year’s total 
revenue and exports in the first nine months. 
Today, Growel has achieved the distinguished 

  129
The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Business Value
position as the largest manufacturer of axle com-
ponents for heavy trucks world wide and one of 
the key global players for engine components. 
Primemover has improved over last year’s total 
revenue and exports (as shown in  table 2).  How-
ever, Primemover  has  not fully  achieved  the 
anticipated  objectives and results. Primemover 
had an expectation that the inventory levels would 
reduce by 60-70% and cost efficiency would 
also improve by 40-50% however, reduction in 
inventory levels achieved was only 40% and im-
provement in cost efficiency also was only 20%. 
Another expectation of Primemover was that the 
human resources would become highly motivated 
as an end result but the motivation expected was 
not seen. Although, improvement in the areas of 
on-time delivery and time taken for new product 
development, was achieved as anticipated. On 
the financial side, improvement expectation in 
the bottom line, profit after tax, was 20% by 
both Growel and Primemover. An improvement 
of only 9% was finally achieved by Primemover 
whereas Growel achieved 26%.
DISCSSI
These cases illustrated Davenport’s conceptual 
framework (Figure 1) of how business benefits 
are achieved from ES data transformation into 
ES knowledge highlighting the effectiveness of 
enterprise systems in the two organizations. The 
overall business benefits including the financial 
results obtained in Growel’s case surpassed those 
of Primemover. The reasons attributed to this are 
given in the following section. 
Growel and Primemover both had a business 
strategy and had identified their business objec-
tives however; the business strategy in Growel’s 
case was clearly articulated and aligned. Growel 
worked out their value creation process and identi-
fied the critical areas that required attention and 
improvement. They understood the key drivers 
and had the means to influence those drivers and 
measure them. Growel was able to translate their 
business strategy into departmental or divisional 
strategies. They knew what was to be achieved, 
which data needed analysis, its area of applica-
tion, and expected outcomes. Primemover had 
identified their key business objectives however,

the definition of information critical to the suc-
cess of the organization was lacking. Primemover 
could not create the link between departmental 
performance indicators and top-level metrics for 
gauging the effectiveness of the company strategy. 
Managers had data from their ES investment but 
could not leverage it to maximize realization of 
benefits and achieve their business strategies.
Growel understood the complexity of problems 
requiring analytic support. More complex issues, 
requiring sophisticated modeling and data analy-
sis, are better served when analysts and decision 
makers are closely linked which was the case in 
Growel. The quality of management reviews also 
improved at Growel because executives became 
much more reliant on numbers in explaining their 
performance. Issues of data quality did not exist 
at Growel. Monitoring and updating of data was a 
regular feature and the transaction data were made 
available in a timely fashion to support decision 
making. In the case of Primemover, the lack of 
discipline in updating transactions in the ware-
house led to data discrepancies and data integrity 
issues amongst employees. Data extracts could 
not be made in time to support decision making. 
The analytical and decision-making process was 
based on ES data which were unclean and inac-
curate and the link between data, decisions, and 
actions was lacking.
Growel had streamlined their supply chain 
and achieved a major change in customer and 
supplier behavior since Growel could react better 
to change orders and was able to be more flexible 
in the manufacturing environment. However, in 
the case of Primemover the online visibility of 
demand and supplies with customers and suppliers 
reduced the number of out-of-inventory events, but 
did not achieve the reduction and streamlining of 
inventories anticipated. The lead times could not 
be reduced substantially and delivery performance 
improved marginally. Their data management was 
inconsistent coupled with a lack of clarity on the 
information required to drive their strategy which 
were the reasons they could not achieve their full 
potential and anticipated objectives.C
CONCLUSIONCSI
This study has examined the effectiveness of 
enterprise systems on organizational functions 
and processes for realizing business value. It 
has highlighted that business results follow in 
a culture where the business strategy is clearly 
articulated and defined. The organization works 
out their value creation process identifying the 
critical areas that require attention and improve-
ment. They understand the key drivers and have 
the means to influence those drivers and measure

them. They translate their business strategy into 
departmental or divisional strategies, know what 
is to be achieved, which data needed analysis, its 
area of application, and expected outcomes. The 
organization has a culture that supports decision 
makers who have the definition of the information 
critical to the success of the enterprise and the 
means to achieve it by linking data, decisions, 
and actions. And, for achieving all of this, the 
organization must possess the necessary expertise 
and skills in the usability of ES and its informa-
tion. Quality of data plays a vital role. 
In order to succeed in today’s competitive 
world, businesses must shift their focus from 
improving efficiencies to increasing effective-
ness. Integrated access to pertinent information 
captured by ES must be available so that effec-
tive decisions can be made towards successfully 
implementing strategies, optimizing business 
performance, and adding value for customers. 
Knowledge is a key factor in this process. Success 
or failure is often attributed to enterprise systems 
or their implementation process. However, it is evi-
dent from this study that enterprise systems pro-
vide a platform of functionalities and information 
to an organization. The ability of an organization 
to extract value from data, distribute results from 
analysis, apply knowledge, and establish decisions 
for strategic organizational benefits will lead 
the path towards business success which would 
eventually emerge from the process of ongoing 
transformations over a period of time. R

Abstracta
Growing competitive pressures and escalating customer demands have led businesses to sophisticated 
information technology to manage costs and enhance revenues. Two popular initiatives are supply 
chain management (SCM) and customer relationship management (CRM). SCM focuses on optimiz-
ing the materials, information, services, and financial flows through a supply network. CRM focuses 
on marketing, sales, and customer service, and aims to maximize the value of customer relationships. 
Furthermore, the real potential lies in the integration of SCM and CRM. Disconnected implementations 
can result in IT “silos” with redundancies in hardware, software and staff, breaks in the information 
chain, and disappointing performance. There are different paths to integration. The right path depends 
on the organization’s relative maturity on 6 key factors: 1) interconnectivity, 2) interoperability of sys-
tems’ functionality, 3) information integrity, 4) interorganizational competence, 5) intellectual capital, 
and 6) innovative capability.
ITRCTI
Since the early 1990s, the number and varieties 
of software categories available to firms have 
skyrocketed. Due to advances in other informa-
tion, process, and communication technologies 
(IPCT), and especially those related to the Internet, 
managers have far greater choices and expanded 
functionality for running their businesses than 
ever before. Of these, software for coordinating 
enterprise-wide supply and demand is among the 
most prominent. On the supply side, Supply Chain 

  135
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
Management (SCM) systems may employ enter-
prise resource planning (ERP) software to boost 
enterprise efficiency, improve decision-making 
by providing greater visibility into operations, 
and promote collaboration via information shar-
ing.   On the demand side, Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) offers the opportunity to gain 
more information in real time about current and 
prospective customers, providing functionality 
for contact management, sales force automation, 
and customer service. A recent survey by the 
Yankee Group reveals that external applications 
– those aimed at enhancing customer and supplier 
relationships – are growing at a much faster rate 
than internally focused applications (Westervelt, 
2004).  Furthermore, companies are increasingly 
focused on integrating technologies.
For some firms, the SCM and CRM software 
solutions delivered at least partially on their 
promises, whereas for others the results were less 
than anticipated. Despite significant investments 
in resources, most companies were not prepared 
for the implementation hurdles. During the first 
wave of their infusion into businesses, in which 
individual SCM and/or CRM software modules 
were generally treated as separate installations, 
the integration with existing legacy systems 
proved most troublesome. The Standish Group 
(1995) reported that the average cost overrun was 
178 percent of budget; and the implementation 
schedules exceed 230 percent of plan. Estimates of 
implementation failures of CRM ranged from 55 
- 75 percent according to the Meta Group (Johnson, 
2004). From a survey of 162 senior managers con-
ducted by Bain and Co. (Cook and Hagey, 2003), 
researchers concluded that SCM– which was long 
touted as an avenue to control costs, reduce risks, 
and increase service performance– was misman-
aged by most companies. While executives in 
charge of supply-chain management recognized 
the importance of the supply chain, many had yet 
to realize its potential. Interestingly, 86 percent 
said supply-chain performance was a priority, but 
two-thirds said their companies failed to track 
the performance of their internal supply chains 
outside their corporations.   
Recent evidence is more encouraging.  In a 
survey of primarily large, established, business-
to-business U.S. firms, Ramaswami, Bhargava, 
and Srivastava (2004) found that both CRM and 
SCM processes have positive and significant as-
sociations with the financial performance of firms. 
Rosenzweig, Roth, and Dean (2003) reported that 
the intensity of supply chain integration led to 
improved capabilities. Roth, Cattani, and Froehle 
(2008) empirically showed that the fundamentals 
of supply chain management were prerequisites to 
global competence; and Stratman and Roth (2008) 
linked ERP competence to business performance. 
However, many companies found that the payoff 
from implementing only one side of the equation 
was not enough (Koudal and Lavieri, 2003).  In 
response, some are calling for a “consumer driven 
supply chain” (IBM, 2004) that represents a shift 
from traditional supply chains that focus on maxi-
mizing internal systems to end-to-end systems. 
These systems are highly collaborative, integrated 
throughout the enterprise, and emphasize more 
focus on the ultimate impact on the consumer. 
Similarly, Deloitte Consulting refers to firms 
who have effectively linked SCM with CRM as 
having a ‘digital loyalty network.’ 
Despite its potential, integrating SCM and 
CRM processes has proven to be a major challenge 
that few have tried or accomplished (Bartholomew, 
2004; Koudal and Lavieri, 2003), as steep orga-
nizational changes are often necessary – from 
literally revamping entire business processes, to 
reorganization, to aggressively developing the 
people competencies not only to use, but also to le-
verage the new systems for competitive advantage. 
Unfortunately, the prevailing notions of how best 
to achieve the ‘optimal’ level of integration – the 
right path, so to speak – is not well understood. 
In this chapter, we describe how firms can suc-
cessfully take advantage of ‘integrated’ SCM and 
CRM functionalities. We propose a classification 
of the SCM-CRM integration paths in terms of 

136

business processes, technology functionality, and 
people competence. We will discuss the conditions 
that make successful integration possible, as well 
as those that may put obstacles in the way.  
T
 VALUE OF CUSTOMERCSTR  R
RELATIONSHIP MTISIANAGEMENTT  S
SOLUTIONSTIS
The customer-centric orientation views custom-
ers as key assets of the firm that seeks to build a 
portfolio of the ‘right’ customers. Relationships 
with these customers must be developed and 
then effectively and efficiently managed. The 
fundamental principle of Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) is to leverage customer data 
to build profitable relationships by optimizing 
the value delivered to and realized from each 
customer. CRM is not a technology, but it is made 
possible by technology that allows a business to 
integrate, analyze, and act upon large volumes 
of customer data. Successful CRM applications 
must start with a business strategy, which in turn 
drives changes in business processes that are made 
possible by information technology. 
Many early CRM software products and 
implementations started out as ‘point’ solutions 
– ones designed for a specific function such as 
sales force automation or campaign management. 
This led to a proliferation of CRM tools, each 
with its own unlinked customer file. Businesses 
are increasingly realizing that a “360° view” or 
“single view of the customer” with all customer-
related data in a single data warehouse is a key 
factor for enterprise-wide CRM success. This 
“single version of the truth” consolidates all bits 
of information about the customer, including 
purchases, channel preferences, demographic and 
psychographic data, payment history, marketing 
contacts, service records, complaints or inquiries, 
and other communications with the company (see 
Figure 1). CRM solutions integrate and apply this 
customer information to all aspects of the business 
including but not limited to marketing, sales, and 
customer service that touch the customer.
Where Does CRMCR Provide Value?
CRM is prevalent across many industries, but has 
been most aggressively adopted in the financial 
and services sectors, including banks, credit cards, 
airlines, hotels, and retailers. A 2002 study by 
Figure 1. A single 360o view of the customer integrates all customer information

  137
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
Forrester Research reported that nearly half of 
financial and business services firms had CRM 
solutions completely or partially rolled out, with 
another 40 percent piloting or actively consider-
ing CRM solutions.  More recently, Bain’s 2007 
Management Tools and Trends survey showed 
that CRM is second only to Strategic Planning in 
usage, with 84 percent of surveyed firms report-
ing using CRM.  
CRM solutions are typically split into two 
areas: operational CRM and analytical CRM. 
Operational CRM includes the customer-facing 
applications that focus on managing customer 
interactions. Analytical CRM supports and 
aids decision-making with a range of tools from 
simple spreadsheet analyses to sophisticated data 
mining. Operational CRM and analytical CRM 
support each other in a feedback loop (Chan, 
2005). Operational CRM captures critical data 
for input into analytical analyses. Insights into 
customers’ behaviors obtained from analytical 
CRM are then tied into operational CRM solu-
tions. The most common CRM applications focus 
on sales, marketing, or customer service processes. 
•	
Sales force automation (SFA): Regarded as 
the foundation of CRM tools (Ross, 2005), 
sales force automation is designed to help 
salespeople acquire and retain customers, 
and manage their accounts. Key components 
of SFA solutions include lead distribution 
and tracking, contact management, sales 
process management, pipeline management, 
sales forecasting tools, and automated gen-
eration of quotes and orders.
•	
Customer interaction center applications: 
The most prevalent of the applications focus-
ing on customer service and support are call 
center applications, which aid call routing 
and assignment, queue management, call 
tracking, entitlement processing, problem 
resolution, and performance measure-
ment.
•	
Marketing automation: Marketing au-
tomation uses information technology to 
automate the marketing process and get 
the right message to the right person at the 
right time using the right media. Market-
ing automation encompasses analytics to 
segment customers and target campaigns, 
campaign management to execute mar-
keting campaigns including personal-
ization, and detailed response tracking. 
Benefits of CRM
New classes of customer-centric metrics are used 
to measure and monitor CRM initiatives. These 
include customer profitability and lifetime value, 
share of customer or share of wallet, retention or 
attrition rates, customer satisfaction, loyalty, up-
sell and cross-sell rates, and cost to serve. Com-
mon benefits of successful customer relationship 
management initiatives include the following:
•	
Increased revenues: A larger share of 
customer wallet and increased revenues can 
result from increased usage or purchases 
of the products and services customers al-
ready use or increased revenues from sales 
of additional or higher-margin products 
and services. Additionally, satisfied loyal 
customers may be less price sensitive, so 
fewer price promotions are needed to drive 
sales.
•	
Improved customer loyalty and retention: 
Satisfied customers often stay longer, are less 
likely to churn, are less likely to consider 
taking their business elsewhere, and more 
likely to generate referrals of desirable new 
prospects. These result in a reduced need 
to solicit new customers and lower new 
customer recruiting costs.
•	
Reduced costs of serving customers: Pre-
dictive modeling to better target marketing 
communications can produce significant 
reductions in unproductive advertising 

138  
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
and marketing campaign costs. Initiatives 
to move customers from higher cost (e.g., 
phone) to lower cost (e.g., Internet) channels 
can realize significant cost savings.  
•	
Improved resource allocation: Knowing 
which customers are highly profitable, which 
are marginally profitable, which are unprofit-
able, and which have upside profit potential 
allows firms to better to allocate marketing 
and customer service resources.
•	
Improved product portfolio: Through 
capture and analysis of interactive customer 
feedback, the portfolio of products can be 
better tailored to customers’ needs and 
desires.
Bottom line results achieved from CRM ini-
tiatives vary widely depending, in large part, on 
how well the people-process-technology triangle 
is implemented. Successful implementations dem-
onstrate that substantial returns are possible: by 
focusing attention on its most profitable business 
customers, a plastics company boosted revenues in 
excess of 400 percent while cutting its customer 
base nine-fold. A pharmaceutical company using 
CRM techniques to target customers realized a 
30 percent increase in sales and a 25 percent in-
crease in market share.  A major financial services 
firm realized substantial increases in average 
customer balances and a 50 percent reduction in 
customer attrition. In telecommunications, CRM 
tests have increased customer profitability by 37.5 
percent and reduced churn from 37 percent to 
18.8 percent.  More generally, in a 2003 survey 
of CEOs, PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Trendsetter 
Barometer found that companies with programs 
focused on customer expansion, retention, and 
profitability saw revenues increase 46 percent 
faster than peers. T
THE VALUE OF SUPPLSY CHAIN CI
MANAGEMENTT  SOLUTIONSSTIS
Over the past decade, coinciding with progress 
in CRM, many companies discovered that new 
information, process, and communication tech-
nologies (IPCTs) allowed them to simultaneously 
reduce costs and compete more effectively in 
different markets through better management of 
their supply chain networks (see Figure 2). SCM 
is an approach to managing a complex range of 
Figure 2. Supply chain network flows

  139
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
business activities that are associated with the 
coordination of supply network entities, channels, 
and resources for the effective delivery of value-
added products and services to customers. At 
the heart of SCM is the optimization of material, 
information, financial and service flows through a 
supply network to effectively coordinate business 
activities that are geographically dispersed.
Because SCM focuses on the operational 
and strategic processes of the entire network of 
business entities that transform inputs (e.g., raw 
materials and information) into value-added, fin-
ished products and services for end customers, it 
enables firms to integrate, leverage, and monitor 
the continual flows throughout the chain. They also 
enable knowledge flows among business entities 
(Rosenzweig and Roth, 2007); and opportuni-
ties for global marketplaces, including emerging 
markets (Zhao, Flynn and Roth, 2006).  Supply 
chains exist in both service and manufacturing 
organizations, but many are a combination of both 
types. Usually the activities in early stages of a 
supply chain are manufacturing-oriented (e.g., 
weaving fabric or assembling cars) and the latter 
stages are service-oriented (e.g., retailing apparel, 
logistics, or managing a car dealership). Service 
processes often occur at the interfaces between 
firms in the supply chain to coordinate information 
flows and logistics from customers. Frequently 
service businesses have their own supply chain 
characteristics and supply chain configurations 
(see for example Oliveira and Roth, 2008). 
Unlike CRM, which tends to be more service-
oriented, most of the published SCM articles deal 
with product-oriented supply chains, although the 
complexity of the supply chain network may vary 
considerably from firm to firm and industry to in-
dustry. Many companies are employing enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) models, such as SAP 
and Peoplesoft, to coordinate their supply chain 
network. Such coordination is a major driver in 
the widespread implementation of ERP systems 
in both manufacturing and services. 
Where Does SCMSC Provide Value?
 
Vanguard companies are creatively exploiting 
supply chain thinking and systems to enhance 
their competitive position. Their organizational 
mindsets have moved beyond managing their sup-
ply chains for solely streamlining operations and 
trimming costs towards dynamic competitive ca-
pability creation. Immediately upon implementing 
a new real-time data collection system simultane-
ously with its new enterprise resources planning 
(ERP) system, Oki Data Americas, a Mt. Laurel, 
New Jersey-based manufacturer of computer 
printers and fax machines, increased sales by $6 
million in the first month. A central objective of 
Oki Data’s deployment of its ERP solution was to 
be able to handle increased business, but a surprise 
benefit was the more efficient flow of bar-coded 
data passing into the system that stemmed from 
the deployment of a manufacturing and warehouse 
execution software package.  Information system 
retooling with ERP at Palm cut by one-third (or 
48 hours) the time it took to receive information 
and pass that information to manufacturing and 
receive confirmation (Baljko, 2003). 
Fully integrated CRM-SCM solutions enable 
advanced planning and scheduling, which gives 
users the ability to monitor actual supply chain 
process plans, simulate scenarios, assess impacts, 
and quickly respond to customer queries or 
changes. Agility has an inherent footprint with 
sourcing. Agile companies characteristically have 
distributed supply chains and a high velocity of 
engineering change or product changes.  Dupont’s 
savings were estimated to be $7 million through 
network purchasing, where its ERP system pro-
vided the common foundation for all sites to share 
information (Young 1999).  Thus, by seamlessly 
linking their key customers and partners into their 
supply chains, supply chain exemplars are: 
•	
Becoming more adaptive and agile. 
•	
Improving responsiveness to customers 
needs.

140  
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
•	
Providing more cost-efficient delivery op-
tions for their product, service, capital, and 
information flows. 
In today’s dynamic, clockspeed competitive 
environments, anecdotal, and ad-hoc decision 
making won’t make the grade for long term sur-
vival. Just as supply chain innovators, such as 
Wal-Mart and Dell Computer, carved out their 
place at the table in the business-to-business (B2B) 
arena during the past decade, new players are 
constantly emerging with new supply chain op-
timizing technologies. While still few in number, 
several can operate effectively in virtual space. 
These players are not only “technology-savvy” 
companies, such as Amazon.com and Cisco, but 
also some prominent, well-established players in 
the automotive, chemicals, packaged goods, and 
services sectors. 
The future appears extremely bright for 
those intelligent enterprises that can evolve and 
dynamically provide extraordinary value to 
customers from leveraging their supply chains 
for new product development, to marketing and 
sales, to manufacturing and distribution, to end-
of life activities, such as remanufacturing and 
reverse logistics. Over the next few years, those 
firms that can remove excess costs and assets 
from their supply chains while simultaneously 
improving their own internal resources, build-
ing inimitable customer services, and improving 
customer responsiveness will delight customers 
and outperform competitors.
The most promising SCM approaches focus 
on:
•	
The development of robust supply chain 
strategies for integrating sales, manufactur-
ing, distribution, customer services, and 
account transactions.
•	
Understanding economic and other trade-
offs in optimizing internal processes, 
systems, and resources for the enterprise 
and across the supply chain globally, and 
monitoring the relevant performance crite-
ria.
•	
Cost-modeling and decision-aiding tools for 
“what if” scenario planning used in design-
ing and evaluating supply chain entities.
•	
Building enterprise information systems to 
improve visibility from the suppliers’ sup-
pliers to the customers’ customers.
•	
The transfer and use of advanced information 
and process technologies in manufacturing 
and services among supply chain entities.
Potential Benefits of SCMSC
SCM is evolving as a core competency for com-
peting in the 21st century. It offers new business 
models for firms seeking to go beyond provid-
ing excellent service at competitive rates. Other 
benefits include:
•	
Reducing total delivered costs and time-to-
volume for new products, 
•	
Enhancing visibility, quality, and flexibil-
ity, 
•	
Meeting the increasing and changing de-
mands of their customers,
•	
Improving end-of-life and sustainable en-
vironmental practices, and
•	
Becoming an agile and learning organiza-
tion.
 
But the magnitude and nature of these benefits 
vary greatly for companies that are in different 
evolutionary phases. Firms that are more inward-
oriented tend to emphasize improving logistics 
and focus on cutting both order-cycle times and 
transit times. Taking days and dollars out of the 
supply chain is viewed as one of the first key 
competitive advantages of supply chains. It is 
not uncommon to see 25-40 percent reductions 
in inventory and 25-30 percent improvements in 
customer service levels as a result of a successful 
ERP implementation. Companies, that understand 
the value of supply-chain management, such as 

  141
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
Home Depot, are working twice as efficiently as 
those with less mastery. Yet firms must manage 
their extended supply chains in order to achieve 
the total delivered costs, increased responsiveness, 
and accelerated time-to-market that arise from 
better forecasting, stock utilization, information, 
and standardized processes.
Mastery of the next level of supply chain man-
agement through B2B yields greater and different 
economies of scope. Not only can companies 
realize benefits of efficient movement of goods 
and services; they can also benefit from changes 
in the solution space that make collaboration 
possible. For example, they can scale up design 
workgroups across a company’s entire supply 
chain, quickly and affordably. Managing supply 
chains in the B2B arena enables companies to take 
full advantage of competitive capabilities from 
design through the manufacturing process. 
Finally, SCM makes it possible to achieve 
strategic agility at the most sophisticated and 
revolutionary business-entity-to-entity levels: 
those of the virtual enterprise. The benefits are 
the ability to deliver the right product to the right 
customer at the right time at the right cost, and in 
the process to adapt and learn fast. At this level, 
all supply chain virtual partners have the poten-
tial to win, with real-time information access, 
streamlined order-to-cash processes, reduced 
processing and integration costs, and economies 
of knowledge.

GRATINGRTI CRMCR AND SCMSC S
SOLUTIONSTIS
Why Integrate CRM and SCMICRSC?
The answer to this question is deceptively simple: 
Integration of CRM and SCM enables compa-
nies to close the enormous gaps between supply 
and demand processes. While both CRM and 
SCM can provide significant strategic benefits 
and cost savings, the full benefits can only be 
realized by integrating the two. By automating 
back-office processing and design functions and 
cutting costs through more efficient order-entry 
systems, inventory management, logistics and 
production management, most SCM solutions 
are largely either functional or intra-enterprise-
oriented. In contrast, CRM solutions focus on the 
customer-facing and revenue-generating aspects 
of the business. 
A best-of-class CRM implementation, which 
can identify individual customers and commu-
nicate to them with tailored messages and offers, 
perhaps cross-selling additional products, is of 
limited value if the supply chain is not able to 
deliver the goods in a timely manner and at a 
reasonable cost. Similarly, a best-of-class SCM 
implementation that is not paired with accurate 
and timely knowledge of customers’ needs is just 
a more efficient way of delivering a suboptimal 
end product. 
Ultimately, the customer is at the end of the 
supply chain. The supply chain needs informa-
tion collected from customer-facing touch points 
to make for efficient production scheduling. In 
return, CRM initiatives need an effective sup-
ply chain to deliver in accord with customer 
expectations.  In summary, as stated by Min and 
Mentzer (2000), CRM and SCM are “inextricably 
intertwined.” (p. 782)
Levels of IntegrationI
The four main levels of integration between SCM 
and CRM are nonintegrated point solutions, 
limited or functional integration, intra-enterprise 
integration, and inter-enterprise integration (see 
Figure 3). With nonintegrated solutions, a business 
has different application programs, each operating 
largely as a silo. For example, within the CRM 
arena, a retailer’s website may not be integrated 
with their call center for phone orders. In the 
next level of integration, all CRM modules are 
integrated and all SCM modules are integrated. 
The third level of integration links the demand-

side CRM applications with the supply-side SCM 
applications within the same line of business or 
company; this reflects cross-functional integra-
tion within the business. The final level integrates 
CRM and SCM solutions that cross line-of-busi-
ness or firm boundaries
Benefits of IIntegration
Benefits of SCM-CRM integration can be quanti-
tative or qualitative. Quantitative benefits can be 
measured in hard numbers, whereas qualitative 
benefits can only be measured using ‘soft’ crite-
ria.  Increased demand and revenues and reduced 
costs for staff, transaction, or materials result in 
quantifiable, tangible benefits. Intangible benefits 
may include improved agility, stronger competi-
tive position, and technical consistency.
Specific tangible benefits from traditional 
SCM-CRM integration include the following:
•	
Reduced redundancy in systems and staff 
as a result of fewer manual ‘hand-offs’ 
needed.
•	
Consistent data across functions so that, 
for example, a customer-facing call center 
application operates from the same product 
availability information as the manufactur-
ing plants and distribution centers.
•	
Improved response time resulting from 
an unbroken chain of information and au-
tomated transaction processing across both 
demand-and supply-side applications.
When the CRM ‘generate demand’ activi-
ties and the SCM ‘fulfill demand’ activities are 
properly implemented and integrated, each one 
enhances the other. Far-reaching, but less tangible 
synergies are possible with CRM and SCM inte-
gration. These include:
•	
Operational synergies due to shared re-
sources and overlapping processes.
•	
Financial synergies due to reduced capital 
risks.
•	
Organizational synergies result in higher 
quality management, and reduced asym-
metric information and visibility.
•	
Marketplace synergies arise from better 
coordination and responsiveness.
Together these four types of synergies are self 
reinforcing, and they yield long-term financial 
gains from delivering increased customer value 
(which CRM applications can provide) while si-
multaneously improving the supply base from new 
product development through end-of-cycle prac-
tices (which SCM applications can provide).
Growing empirical evidence supports the ben-
efits of CRM–SCM integration. In 2001, Deloitte 
interviewed executives at nearly 250 major con-
sumer companies in 28 countries and concluded 
that consumer companies with integrated systems 
are two to five times more likely to achieve supe-
rior performance in sales, market share, customer 
service, and other key measures – and much more 
likely to generate higher shareholder returns 
Figure 3. Levels of SCM-CRM integration

  143
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
(CRMDaily.com, May 21, 2001).  A key finding 
in a 2002 updated study by Deloitte Research is 
that companies that have effectively tied together 
their customer relationship management and sup-
ply chain applications – a process that lets them 
link service levels to profitability of individual 
customers–are 81 percent more profitable than 
those that don't (Smith, 2002).
Bartholomew (2004) reports that although few 
firms have made CRM and SCM systems con-
nect, those who have–including furniture maker 
Herman Miller, Inc. and industrial controls and 
instrument manufacturer F. W. Murphy Co.–are 
significantly more profitable. Evidence from 
analysis of case studies led Heikklila (2002) to 
propose that supply chains should start from the 
customer end to yield the maximum benefit.  Em-
pirical results from a cross-section of large U.S. 
firms found that benefits from CRM applications 
are greater when CRM-generated information is 
integrated with supply chain partners (Mithas, 
Krishnan, and Fornell, 2005).  Based on an inter-
national sample spanning Asia, Europe, North and 
South America, Frohlich and Westbrook (2001) 
found that firms with the widest ‘arc’ of integra-
tion including both suppliers and customers had 
the strongest performance along a diverse set of 
measures including customer service, quality, 
cost, market share, and firm profitability. Con-
versely, they also found that weak links between 
suppliers and customers appeared to hurt perfor-
mance, a finding corroborated by Rosenzweig et 
al. (2003).  
CI
Advancing to higher levels of CRM-SCM integra-
tion presents significant technical and organiza-
tional challenges.
Technical Challenges
Level 2 B2B solutions generally require firms to 
substitute automation for labor in order to integrate 
back-office transactions and logistics processes, 
including order processing, inventory manage-
ment, payables and receivables, and production 
scheduling. Advancing to higher levels of CRM–
SCM integration often necessitates a broader role 
particularly for automation and decision support 
tools, which help to improve workers’ productiv-
ity and enhance their abilities. Online transaction 
processing (OLTP) and logistics process are core 
competencies of traditional SCM suppliers, while 
the tools for integrated customer support and col-
laborative product and process design are a less 
mature, emerging competence. 
In the CRM realm, solutions are more exter-
nally focused and draw on ever-changing customer 
information (sometimes in real-time) to guide 
sales, marketing, and customer service decisions. 
Decision-support systems (DSS) tools, including 
online analytical processing (OLAP), queries, 
data analysis, and data mining, extract informa-
tion from the customer data. The information 
used and analysis needed for CRM applications 
vary over time depending on the user, the market 
environment, and the business strategy. Yet the 
traditional IT and data warehousing solutions, 
which are best suited for an OLTP environment 
(core to SCM solutions) are different from those 
best suited for a DSS environment (core to CRM 
solutions). These differences highlight the chal-
lenges of technical integration.
Not only do the role, nature, and complexity 
of technology change with levels of integration, 
but also the complexity of decision-making. 
Take the evolution of manufacturing systems, 
for example. Simply put, materials requirements 
planning (MRP) is a level 2 integration system in 
which requirements are taken from customers or 
internally developed forecasts, and are compared 
to on-hand inventories in order to calculate what 
must be produced and ordered from suppliers, 
offset by the estimated lead times. MRP logic of 
“what do I need, what do I have on hand, and what 
do I need to get and when?” is the backbone of 
today’s ERP systems. Yet, as depicted, the com-

144  
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
plexity of managing the diversity of technology 
choices has grown exponentially. 
Similar levels of complexity appear with evolv-
ing CRM solutions, so the combined integration 
with SCM may appear to be technologically 
daunting. Managers typically encounter addi-
tional technical problems:
•	
Mission-critical data and applications are 
on legacy systems.
•	
Proprietary and varied turnkey applications 
are not easy to access across platforms.
•	
A proliferation of hardware and software 
systems and platforms that are incompat-
ible.
•	
A hodgepodge of networking equipment, 
policies, documentation, and communica-
tion protocols.
•	
Geographically dispersed and locally oper-
ated sites.
Organizational Challenges
One of the first organizational challenges faced 
in CRM-SCM integration is bridging the differ-
ence in the languages and cultures of the various 
entities to be integrated, as is readily gleaned 
from observations of marketing and operations 
functions in companies. Such diversity is greatly 
accentuated by the fourth level of integration 
across enterprises. 
Even more severe are the structural mismatches 
between organizational and people competencies 
required for integration.  Technology continues 
to grow exponentially and businesses struggle to 
keep pace with organizational skills and manage-
rial know-how aptitudes.  
PATSTITRTI
The scope, time to implementation, and cost of 
a fully integrated platform can be considerable. 
Customers with immediate needs for solutions are 
often not willing to wait for the major players to 
deliver the goods. Swift moving, smaller vendors 
that lack the full suites of integration, but deliver 
in smaller packages that ‘bolt-on’ to current sys-
tems, are rampant. One downside of the bolt-ons 
is that they do not necessarily interface with other 
technologies in place; and remediation and system 
updates can cause costly disruptions enterprise-
wide, as the domino effects from tweaking can be 
pervasive and have unknown consequences. Other 
companies are opting for ‘home grown’ solutions. 
One immediate consequence of this, of course, is 
that companies may not have the expertise they 
need at the start--they don’t know what they don’t 
know. So what is the right path?
KCR
-SCMSC IntegrationI
There are multiple paths to integration. Clearly, 
there are no simple solutions for choosing the 
right path, but there are six key success factors, 
each strategic, as companies move to higher and 
higher levels of CRM-SCM integration maturity. 
At the heart of integration are what we call the 6 
I’s to CRM-SCM integration: 1) Interconnectiv-
ity, 2) Interoperability of systems, 3) Information 
integrity, 4) Interorganizational competence, 5) 
Intellectual capital, and 6) Innovative capability. 
The paths given in Figure 4 represent different 
levels of entity maturity. 
1.	
Interconnectivity: At the most basic level, 
there must be technical connectivity among 
the integrating entities. In other words, the 
operating systems of all entities must have 
the means to “talk to each other” consistently 
and routinely. In the simplest integration, 
interconnectivity may take the form of 
telephone and fax. Further integration re-
quires more complex automation through 
traditional electronic data interchange 
(EDI) up to more advanced IPCT applica-
tions where available information is visible. 
However, a first order condition is that there 

  145
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
be accessibility and systems reliability for 
all integrating entities. Increasingly, robust 
and well-designed mobile applications are 
enabling modules to communicate on wire-
less and disconnected modes.
2. 	
Information integrity: Information ac-
curacy and completeness is necessary for 
integration. The levels of detail and aggrega-
tion may vary, however, as will the real-time 
availability of the information. These will 
be a function of business decision-making 
relevance related to the degree of integration 
intensity.
3.	
Interoperability of systems: Next in im-
portance is interoperability. The ease of use 
by all integrating parties is essential, as is 
having equivalent system functionality. Here 
portals, web servers, and data warehouses 
may perform the functions that users expect 
– integration via hyperlinks, presentation 
Figure 4. Maturity paths for CRM-SCM integration

146  
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
of content, and hyperlinks to resources. 
Take for example Invensys Manufacturing 
Solutions (IMS) Unit, based in Herndon, Vir-
ginia. IMS has developed interoperability 
technology software that helps define and 
manage the execution layer that integrates 
with other plant and enterprise management 
applications from Invensys, as well as third-
party applications. There are several facets 
to its interoperability, namely, a common 
user environment; event management and 
reporting; configurable, standard response 
to detected events; and the ability to lever-
age data from manufacturing data sources 
and providers. Paul LeMert, director of 
strategic marketing for IMS, likens better 
connectivity of plant-floor data with other 
levels to “synchronizing the two workflows 
by having current islands of automation and 
islands of information working in concert” 
(Schultz, 2003).   
4.	
Interorganizational competence: Inter-
organizational competencies are the skills, 
operational practices, and integrating 
mechanisms needed for linking entities  (for 
an organizational competency assessment 
tool, see Stratman and Roth, 2002a, 2002b, 
and 2008 and Masini and Van Wasshenove, 
2008). CRM-SCM integration is a strategic 
business decision. As integration intensity 
increases, the degree of overlapping pro-
cesses, the level of people competencies and 
technological prowess will rise (McAfee, 
2002; Robey, Ross, and Boudreau, 2002). 
The threshold level of integration will be es-
tablished by the weakest link in the network 
and therefore appropriate investments must 
be made to acquire the requisite competen-
cies for each entity at the desired stage of 
maturity.	
5.	
Intellectual capital: Intellectual capital is 
defined in terms of the firm’s knowledge 
assets: structural capital, human capital, 
and abortive capacity. At lower levels of 
integration, the form of intellectual capital 
will be more structural (e.g., codified and 
embedded in routines, processes, and sys-
tems). Advancement in integration requires 
more business savvy people with not only 
technical acumen, but also who are able 
to deal with increasingly complex and un-
structured environments. Thus, the efficacy 
of management and technical talent will 
vary greatly from each stage of maturity. 
In order to gain what Roth (1996) coined as 
‘economies of knowledge’ from integration, 
the firm must be willing and able to make 
the requisite investments in human capital 
and in the organization’s ability to learn and 
adapt.
6.	
Innovative capability: Innovation is the 
ability to create something new that will 
be demanded by customers. Clearly, the 
organization’s collective creativity and 
agility are important drivers of innovation. 
Proactiveness and anticipation are other 
facets of innovation. Increasing richness 
of the interactive tools, collaborative, and 
e-business applications that are afforded by 
integration must be leveraged. Investment in 
higher levels of innovation requires increas-
ing levels of innovative capability.
Importantly, the ability of the entity network to 
function in a seamless manner will be limited by 
the weakest link. For example, if one partner in the 
network has incomplete or inadequate data, this 
lack of data integrity has a multiplicative impact 
through the network that effectively brings all 
other entities to the same level. Arguably, relative 
maturity on interconnectivity, interoperability, 
and information integrity are more tangible and 
technical elements. As a result, an entity’s relative 
maturity stage on these elements is easier to detect 
than its maturity on softer, intangible elements of 
organizational competence, intellectual capital, 
and innovative capability.

  147
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
In our experience, most companies empha-
size alignment on the tangibles, and only give 
lip service, or even totally neglect the intangible 
maturity elements that are more difficult and 
timely to gauge. Take Toyota, for example. Toyota’s 
organizational competence is set up to manage 
the entire value stream for each product family, 
rather than leaving each supply network entity to 
optimize its own activities. Consequently, Toyota 
spends considerable effort on understanding and 
improving the organizational competencies of its 
suppliers and distribution entities, and working on 
joint process analyses. Similarly, getting a better 
grasp of a partner’s innovative capability matu-
rity, for example, will allow for a more realistic 
assessment of potential benefits of integration 
for accelerating time to volume ramp up for new 
product and services. Thus, getting the tangible 
elements in sync is not enough. All entities must 
be aligned at the same maturity stage across all 
six key factors in order to reap the full benefits 
of further progression.

Challenges of Implementing and I
Integrating CRMCR and SCM SoSCSlutions
Choosing the right path for any organization 
requires making short-term and long-term trade-
offs. As companies move toward higher levels 
of integration, most will be hard pressed to keep 
their home grown or bolt-on solutions current. 
The pace of technological change is dizzying. On 
the other hand, the full integrating vendors will 
need to become more flexible and agile as their 
customers’ needs for flexibility, best-of-breed, and 
customized solutions are rising. The marketplace 
dynamics will not be kind to those vendors that 
cannot swiftly adapt.
Though the potential benefits of fully inte-
grated CRM and SCM solutions are great, the 
challenges can be formidable and success is not 
automatic. Despite the promise, statistics show 
that many CRM-SCM implementations failed to 
achieve their business goals. Beyond the matching 
of maturity elements, we found some common 
pitfalls among the failures - nonintegrated busi-
ness and technology strategy, inconsistent top 
management support, lack of trust, and inadequate 
understanding of technology. Turn these pitfalls 
into promise by: 
•	
Building a strong business case. The sys-
tem is only as good as the business strategy 
that it supports. Successful SCM and CRM 
solutions require a sound underlying busi-
ness case coupled with metrics to measure 
and monitor the results. This business 
strategy must be clearly articulated and 
communicated to all stakeholders. 
•	
Securing management support and com-
mitment. SCM and CRM solutions reflect a 
business approach that extends far beyond 
mere technology tools. Successful imple-
mentation requires the involvement of and 
commitment from personnel spanning sales 
and marketing, operations, and informa-
tion technology. Support and commitment 
from the top help ensure that all are aligned 
and working towards the same objectives. 
The CEO and the team should ‘own’ the 
implementation. Once implemented, the 
integration is a key strategic tool around 
which critical business decisions are to be 
made - and this should not be relegated to 
technical experts. 
•	
Building communication and trust. In 
corporate politics, information is power 
and this can result in an environment in 
which information is not shared. Success-
ful integration of SCM and CRM solutions 
requires the sharing of information across 
the organization, and potentially with part-

148  
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
ner organizations as well. Build teams and 
constantly share expectations and lessons 
learned.
•	
Developing an understanding of the tech-
nologies. Although technology is just one 
component of the solution, it is vital to its 
overall success. Factors such as scalability, 
integration, and functionality need to be 
considered up-front.  Inherent capabilities 
of the technologies should be understood in 
advance.
Millennium C emicals
AMR Research reported that many companies 
are accelerating their integration efforts to make 
way for e-business interactions. Large chemical 
companies spent at least $10 million on systems 
integration and say that their ROI can even be 
higher (Fattah and D’Amico, 2003). The benefits of 
an integrated customer relationship management 
and supply chain management solution are evident 
at Millennium Chemicals, a major international 
chemical company, with leading market posi-
tions in a broad range of commodity, industrial, 
performance, and specialty chemicals. With $1.6 
billion in annual sales and an employee network 
spanning five continents, Millennium Chemicals 
is the world’s second-largest producer of titanium 
dioxide (TiO2); a leading producer of fragrance 
chemicals; the second-largest producer of acetic 
acid and vinyl acetate monomer in North America; 
and a 29.5 percent owner of Equistar Chemicals, 
LP, the second-largest producer of ethylene and 
third-largest producer of polyethylene in North 
America.
The goal of Millennium Chemicals is to use 
the internet to increase business and reduce 
costs.  To date, they have seen more on the cost 
side through their implementation of ERP.  To 
garner added revenues, Millennium opened its 
online store front, called Millennium Direct, in 
2000 and is using CRM to implement it. The ad-
vantage of a good integrated information system 
with the online storefront is to get a competitive 
edge on service.  Since titanium dioxide is a 
commodity, Millennium’s online storefront is a 
service differentiator to its customers. Providing 
a competitive edge, its supply chain module has 
been implemented in 95 percent of the business 
in 1999 and is stable. Millennium sees SCM-
CRM as the backbone of their e-business.  Their 
highly integrated SCM-CRM gives customers not 
only the ability to display product catalogs and 
select products online, but also provides real-time 
feedback with available-to-promise information 
and adjusted delivery dates based on production 
schedules and on-hand inventory.  The customers 
can review their order with the delivery informa-
tion and either modify the order or submit it.  The 
system then confirms the order and provides the 
order number for tracking purposes.  Customers 
have real time access to all aspects of their order, 
including reviewing order status, checking ac-
count balances, and dynamic invoicing.  All other 
processes around creating delivery and collecting 
receivables remained stable; however, the order-
to-cash process improved significantly.
Millennium Chemical’s SCM-CRM integra-
tion illustrates their relative maturity on the key 
factors.  The internet provided a high level of 
interconnectivity with customers. Interoperability 
was handled through features and functionality 
built into the portal; information integrity was 
quite high since the CRM module was integrated 
with a stable supply chain module implementa-
tion, so customers received correct information 
in a timely fashion. Millennium is attacking 
interorganizational competencies by segmenting 
its customer base. It is unrealistic to expect all 
customers to use Millennium Direct at once. Con-
sequently, they prioritized the vendor managed 
inventory (VMI) segment, which represents 25 
percent of the business. As a result, Millennium 
could eliminate a redundant order entry system. 
In addition, they built organizational competence 
with the assistance of highly skilled technology 
vendors, who had a keen understanding of business 

  149
The Right Path to SCM-CRM Integration
processes. Millennium found that the intellectual 
capital base had to be revamped in order to reap 
the benefits of the newly integrated systems.  For 
example, the customer service representatives’ 
(CSRs) roles changed from being reactive ‘order 
takers’ to proactive ‘order makers.’  This transition 
required added investments in training, changes 
in the reward systems, and continuous communi-
cations and team building.  Finally, Millennium 
has demonstrated innovative capabilities, as it is 
now using the integrated system for fine tuning 
its package type planning and interregional ship-
ment planning.  
Millennium found that customers valued the 
additional information. Orders were processed 
more quickly. The system helps their customer 
service representatives work more efficiently. 
Cost savings resulted from providing the same 
level of service with fewer CSRs and real time 
information was available to customers.  They 
estimated a 5-10 percent inventory costs savings 
from visibility. The internal business processes 
around production planning and interregional 
shipments benefited from having a better grip on 
customer demand, resulting in significantly less 
global transfer of products.
In summary, Millennium benefited from its 
SCM-CRM integration. It lowered costs – reduced 
inventory and headcount - and improved its cus-
tomer service by providing its customers with 
real time data and making conducting business 
with itself easier. The CRM applications managed 
the customer interaction, and the SCM solutions 
manage the transactions on the backend. Some 
lessons learned in their SCM-CRM implementa-
tion journey were:  
1.	
Design the system with features and func-
tionality before you go shopping for soft-
ware.
2.	
Top management support is critical.
3.	
Find good technology implementation 
partners, if in-house capabilities are not suf-
ficient, and be sure they understand business 
processes.
4.	
Build the use of new systems into employee 
objectives.
5.	
Have a phased rollout.
6.	
Develop a strategy with lots of reinforce-
ment and communications internally with 
employees and externally with supply chain 
partners.
7.	
Tie CRM in with a stable SCM system
8.

This chapter is dealing with the alignment of enterprise systems with business strategy and its impact 
on the business value that enterprise systems generate. Initially the research on the strategic potential 
of ICT, which constitutes the basic theoretical foundation of the need for strategic alignment of enter-
prise systems, is analyzed. Then the previous research that has been conducted concerning enterprise 
systems strategic alignment is critically reviewed. It is grouped into three basic streams. The .rst of 
them is dealing with the conceptualization and basic understanding of enterprise systems strategic 
alignment. The second research stream aims at the development of models and frameworks for directing 
and assessing enterprise systems strategic alignment. The third research stream examines the impact of 
enterprise systems strategic alignment on business performance. Finally, an empirical investigation that 
has been conducted by the authors concerning the impact of enterprise systems strategic alignment on 
business performance as a guidance for future research on this topic is described. We expect that this 
chapter will sufficiently inform on strategic alignment, both researchers and practitioners in the area 
of enterprise systems, so that they can incorporate this highly important concept in their research and 
practice respectively.

Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value  
introduction
The strategic alignment of information systems 
(IS) has been ranked as the most important issue 
that IS managers face in the two most recent formal 
surveys conducted by the Society for Information 
Management (SIM) of USA (www.simnet.org) 
concerning the key IS management issues (Luft-
man & McLean, 2004; Luftman, 2005). Also, the 
strategic alignment of IS has been ranked in very 
high positions in most of the surveys of the key IS 
management issues that have been conducted in 
various countries (e.g. Palvia et al, 2002). Several 
de. nitions of IS strategic alignment have been 
proposed by the relevant literature. According to 
Broadbent & Weil (1993) as IS strategic alignment 
is defined the extent to which business strategies 
are enabled, supported and stimulated by informa-
tion strategies. Luftman (2000) provides a more 
detailed definition stating that ‘Business-IT align-
ment refers to applying Information Technology in 
an appropriate and timely way, in harmony with 
business strategies, goals and needs. This defini-
tion of alignment addresses: 1. how IT is aligned 
with the business and 2. how the business should 
or could be aligned with IT’ (p.3). Duffy (2002) 
in an IDC Report states that IT technical people 
have criticized corporate general management for 
a lack of interest in the IS function; at the same 
time general management people have criticized 
the IT technical people for not understanding 
the business and for not being profit-oriented, 
being interested mainly in solving technical 
problems and not business problems. However, 
at the same time he remarks that ‘However valid 
both of these criticisms may have been, there is 
evidence that the gap between the two groups is 
now narrowing” (p.2), and defines ‘IT/Business 
Alignment’ as ‘the process and goal of achieving 
competitive advantage through developing and 
sustaining a symbiotic relationship between IT 
and Business’ (p.4).
The strategic alignment of enterprise systems 
consists in the establishment of a bilateral rela-
tionship between the enterprise systems plan-
ning process and the business/strategy planning 
processes, which allows:
•	
The mission, goals, competitive strategy, 
future directions and action plan of the en-
terprise, and also the analysis of its external 
environment (e.g. competition, opportuni-
ties, threats) and the analysis of its internal 
environment (e.g. resources, capabilities, 
strengths, weaknesses), which are basic 
elements of its business/strategy plan, to be 
taken into account for the formulation of its 
enterprise systems plan, 
•	
And also the capabilities, strengths and 
weaknesses of existing enterprise systems, 
the planned enterprise systems, the forms 
and the extent of information and com-
munication technologies (ICT) usage in 
the industry and the capabilities offered by 
existing and emerging ICTs that may interest 
and influence the enterprise, which are basic 
elements of the enterprise systems plan, to 
be taken into account for the formulation of 
the business/strategy plan. 
The basic objective of this bilateral relationship 
is to exploit ICT in the enterprise in the best pos-
sible manner for both supporting and enriching 
its business strategy, and to take advantage to the 
highest possible extent of the significant strategic 
potential of ICT.
This chapter is dealing with the alignment of 
enterprise systems with business strategy and 
its impact on the business value that enterprise 
systems generate. It aims to inform on this highly 
important issue both researchers and practitio-
ners in the area of enterprise systems, so that 
they take it into account and incorporate it in 
their research and practice respectively. In this 
direction in the following second section of this 
chapter is reviewed briefly the research that has 
been conducted on the strategic potential of ICT, 
which constitutes the basic theoretical foundation 

154  
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value 
of the need for strategic alignment of enterprise 
systems. Then in the third section the previous 
research that has been conducted concerning en-
terprise systems strategic alignment is critically 
reviewed. In the fourth section is described an 
empirical investigation that has been conducted 
by the authors concerning the impact of enterprise 
systems strategic alignment on business perfor-
mance, based on the construction of complete 
econometric models, which are founded on the 
well-established and validated Cobb-Douglas 
production function, and using objective measures 
of business performance and enterprise systems 
investment, and on. Finally the conclusions and 
the future trends concerning enterprise systems 
strategic alignment are discussed. 
T he STR ATE GIC  POTENTI
AL 
O F ICT
There has been for more than two decades a high 
level of interest of both researchers and practitio-
ners in the alignment between enterprise systems 
and business strategy, which is founded on the 
recognition that ICT have a significant strategic 
potential, i.e. if properly exploited they can have 
a significant strategic impact on the enterprise 
and provide valuable competitive advantages. 
The initial research on this strategic potential 
of ICT has been based on the work of M. Porter 
(1980) on competitive strategy, which identifies 
three generic business strategies: differentiation, 
cost leadership and focus; also it concludes that 
organizations use these generic strategies in order 
to control five basic industry forces, which deter-
mine their competitive position and profitability: 
rivalry among existing competitors, bargaining 
power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, 
threat of substitute products/services and threat 
of new entrants. Parsons (1983) applied the above 
work of M. Porter to the ICT and reached the 
conclusion that IS can have a significant strategic 
impact if the are used to change the products, 
services, markets or production economics of 
an industry, to affect the buyers and suppliers of 
the enterprise, to prevent customers from buy-
ing products and services from competitors, to 
preclude new competitors, to alter the degree of 
rivalry, or to support one of the abovementioned 
M. Porter’s generic strategies. McFarlan (1984) 
applied the above work of M. Porter to the ICT and 
concluded that they can have a strategic impact, if 
they are used in order to build barriers against new 
entrants, build switching costs, change the basis 
of the competition, generate new products and 
services and change the balance of power in sup-
plier relationships. Building on these conclusions 
Benjamin et al (1984) enriched the perspective of 
the strategic potential of ICT by concluding that 
it is not only IS affecting customers or support-
ing new products and services that can have a 
strategic impact, but also IS affecting internal 
operations and supporting traditional products 
and services can be of high strategic importance 
as well and provide competitive advantages. Ives 
and Learnmonth (1984) applied the concept of 
value chain to the interaction of a customer with 
an enterprise and concluded that an IS that fits 
into customer lifecycle and differentiates products 
or services from those of the competitors can be 
of high strategic importance. Wiseman (1985) 
concludes that IS supporting the internal opera-
tions or the traditional products and services of 
an enterprise can have strategic impact if they 
support its ‘strategic thrusts’, such as M. Porter’s 
generic strategies, innovation, growth or alliances, 
in a manner that influences relationships with 
customers, suppliers or competitors. Important is 
the contribution of Porter & Millar (1985) on this 
topic, who identify three basic ways that ICT can 
affect competition: by altering industry structures, 
supporting differentiation and cost leadership 
strategies, and also by spawning entirely new 
businesses; they also argue that ICT have stra-
tegic potential if they can add value to a product 
or service in at least one of the primary activities 
(inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, 

  155
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value  
marketing and sales, after-sales support and 
services) or one of the support activities (human 
resources management, technology development, 
infrastructure management, procurement) of the 
value chain. At the same time been many case 
studies have been published on this topic describ-
ing and analyzing ‘real-life’ IS that have provided 
valuable competitive advantage (e.g. Earl, 1989; 
Hopper, 1990; Robson, 1997; Pemberton et al, 
2001; Picolli & Applegate, 2003), which validate 
and prove the practical applicability of the above 
research conclusions.
Subsequent research on this topic emphasizes 
the need for combining ICT with other resources 
of the enterprise in order to have a strategic im-
pact. In this direction Carr (2003) argues that a 
narrow and exclusively technological focus can-
not result in competitive advantages (‘IT Doesn’t 
Matter’). Powell and Dent-Micallef (1997) from 
an empirical study in the retail industry found 
that ICT alone cannot produce sustainable per-
formance advantages, but such advantages can 
be gained only by using ICT in order to leverage 
intangible, complementary human and business 
resources. Miller (2003) found that sometimes 
these complimentary resources can be of low 
value, or even considered as liabilities, until they 
are they are incorporated in a new ICT-based 
‘engine of value creation’; therefore ICT can be 
instrumental in leveraging existing enterprise 
resources of low value, or even liabilities, into 
valuable resources that offer (in combination with 
other resources and ICT) competitive advantage. 
Another important dimension of the strategic 
potential of ICT as enablers of ‘strategic agility’ 
is proposed by Sambamurthy et al (2003), who 
argue that the capabilities of ICT can create new 
strategic ‘digital options’ for the enterprise and 
enable it to launch new competitive initiatives 
and respond quickly and effectively to changes 
in its environment.
Also, research has been conducted concerning 
the sustainability of the competitive advantages 
provided by ICT. Mata et al (1995), based on a 
resource-based view of the firm, conclude that 
‘managerial ICT skills’ (defined as the ability of 
ICT management to understand the business needs 
of other functional units, customers and suppli-
ers, and in cooperation with them to develop IS 
that cover these needs) is the only ICT attribute 
of an enterprise that can provide a sustainable 
competitive advantage. Bharadwaj (2000) adopt-
ing also a resource-based perspective and using a 
matched-sample comparison group methodology 
found that superior firm-specific ICT resources 
(ICT infrastructure, human ICT resources and 
ICT-enabled intangibles) result in superior fi-
nancial performance. Picolli & Ives (2005) from 
an extensive literature review identified four 
basic barriers to the erosion of the competitive 
advantages provided by ‘IT-dependent strategic 
initiatives’: IT resources barrier, complementary 
resources barrier, IT project barrier and preemp-
tion barrier; they conclude that the existence of one 
or more of these barriers can make the competitive 
advantages offered by ‘IT-dependent strategic 
initiatives’ sustainable for long time.
In conclusion, from the above research consid-
erable theoretical support and empirical evidence 
has been produced that ICT can provide (usually in 
combination with other resources of the enterprise) 
significant competitive advantages, which under 
specific conditions can be sustainable; it has also 
been concluded that the realization of this strategic 
potential is not an easy task and necessitates the 
establishment of a connection between ICT and 
the overall strategy of the enterprise.

The above conclusions gave rise to considerable 
research in the last twenty years concerning vari-
ous dimensions of enterprise systems strategic 
alignment. This research can be grouped into three 
basic streams: i) conceptualization and basic un-

156  
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value 
derstanding of enterprise systems strategic align-
ment, ii) development of models and frameworks 
for assessing and directing enterprise systems 
strategic alignment, and iii) investigation of the 
impact of enterprise systems strategic alignment 
on the business performance. These three research 
streams are briefly reviewed next.
C onceptualization and Basic 
Understanding of Enterprise 
Systems Strategic Alignment
The main objective of this research stream is to 
conceptualize and understand the strategic align-
ment of enterprise systems, focusing on the iden-
tification of its basic processes, barriers, critical 
success factors and benefits (King, 1978; Lederer 
& Mendelow, 1988; Earl, 1989; Jarvenpaa & Ives, 
1990; Zviran, 1990; Chan, 1992; Earl, 1993; Luft-
man, 1996; Reich & Benbasat, 1996; Armstrong 
& Sambamurthy, 1999; Luftman, Papp & Brier 
1999; Luftman & Brier, 1999; Kearns & Lederer, 
2000; Reich & Benbasat, 2000; Allen & Wilson, 
2003; Campbell et al, 2005; Rantham et al, 2005). 
Due to space limitations we are going to outline 
briefly only the most representative publications 
of this research stream. Lederer and Mendelow 
(1988) argue that one of the most important barriers 
of enterprise systems strategic alignment is the 
difficulty of convincing top management of the 
strategic potential of ICT, because the top manage-
ment usually lacks sufficient awareness on ICT 
strategic potential, regards the use of computers 
as a strictly operational support tool, perceives 
a credibility gap, does not view information as a 
resource, demands financial justification and also 
is action-oriented; for overcoming these difficul-
ties the authors propose a number of techniques: 
educate top management, market IS department 
accomplishments to the top management, have us-
ers to do this ‘selling’, promote the business image 
of the IS department, respond to ‘outside forces’ 
influencing top managers, capitalize on changes 
in management and perform highly sophisticated 
IS planning that necessitate top management 
involvement. Jarvenpaa & Ives (1991) conclude 
that the ‘involvement’ of executives in IS activi-
ties (i.e. the ‘psychological state’) is more strongly 
associated with the progressive use of ICT in the 
enterprise than the ‘participation’ of executives 
in IS activities (i.e. their ‘actual behaviors’); also 
executive involvement is influenced by a CEO‘s 
participation, prevailing organizational condi-
tions, and the executive‘s functional background. 
Earl (1993) identified five basic approaches that 
are adopted by businesses for achieving enterprise 
systems strategic alignment: the business-led ap-
proach, the method-led approach, the administra-
tive approach, the technological approach and the 
organizational approach; each of these approaches 
has different characteristics and therefore dif-
ferent likelihood of success, the organizational 
approach appearing to be more effective. Luft-
man, Papp and Brier (1999) identified a number 
of enablers of alignment between business and 
ICT strategies: senior-executive support for IT, 
IT involvement in strategy development, IT un-
derstanding the business, partnership between IT 
and non-IT units, well-prioritized IT projects and 
IT demonstrating leadership). Reich & Benbasat 
(2000) investigated the influence of four factors 
on the ‘social dimension’ of enterprise systems 
strategic alignment (defined as the extent to which 
business and IT executives mutually understand 
and are committed to both the business and the 
IT mission, objectives, and plans): shared domain 
knowledge between business and IT executives, IT 
implementation success, communication between 
business and IT executives, and connections be-
tween business and IT planning processes; they 
found that all these four factors influence ‘short-
term alignment’, while only the shared domain 
knowledge influences ‘long-term alignment’. 
Campbell et al (2005), based on a review of the 
previous research on enterprise systems strategic 
alignment, identify two basic approaches in it: 
the ‘social’ (focusing primarily on the people 
involved in achieving alignment) and the ‘intel-

  157
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value  
lectual’ (investigating mainly the relevant plans 
and planning methodologies); also, they remark 
that most of the research on enterprise systems 
strategic alignment adopts the intellectual ap-
proach, and recommend a combination of these 
two approaches as the optimal approach. Also 
adopting such a combined approach and based on 
the analysis of the content from a number of inter-
views with senior ICT managers they concluded 
that all of them believed that strategic alignment 
generally depends upon communication, collabo-
ration, development of trust and shared domain 
knowledge, as suggested in the relevant literature; 
however, it was practically problematic to achieve 
these prerequisites, due to the prevalent culture 
in their organizations that promoted competition 
between departments.
This research stream has provided a basic 
conceptualization and understanding of the stra-
tegic alignment of enterprise systems, concern-
ing mainly its basic processes, barriers, critical 
success factors and benefits. However, more 
in-depth research is required on these topics, in 
various types and sizes of enterprises, in various 
industries and national and cultural contexts, and 
for various types of ICT, in order to get a deeper 
and more complete understanding of them.
Development of Models/Frameworks 
for Directing/assessing Enterprise 
Systems Strategic Alignment
This research stream aims to support the practi-
cal application in ‘real-life’ of the ICT strategic 
alignment concept by developing models/frame-
works for assisting the technical and the business 
management in directing and assessing enterprise 
systems strategic alignment. The most widely 
used of the models/frameworks that have been 
developed for directing strategic alignment is 
the ‘Strategic Alignment Model’ (SAM) devel-
oped by Henderson and Venkatraman (1999). As 
we can see in Figure 1 it is based on two basic 
dimensions of required linkage: i) the ‘strategic 
fit’ (=linkage between ‘external components’ 
(concerning the external environment of the en-
terprise) and ‘internal components’ (concerning 
the internal environment of the enterprise)) and 
ii) the ‘functional integration’ (=linkage between 
the ‘business domain’ and the ‘IS domain’). In the 
strategic fit dimension the model views strategy as 
consisting of two components, the ‘external’ and 
the ‘internal’ one, which should be well integrated. 
In particular, it views ICT strategy as consisting of 
one component concerning the ‘external domain’ 
(=decisions on how the enterprise is positioned 
in the ICT marketplace, e.g. which of the exist-
ing ICT in the marketplace it is going to use, 
which are their required performance and cost 
attributes, what kind of relations it has with their 
vendors, such as outsourcing, strategic alliances, 
etc.) and one component concerning the ‘internal 
domain’ (=decisions on how the internal ICT in-
frastructure of the enterprise will be configured 
and managed: ICT architecture, processes and 
skills), which should be well integrated. Similarly 
it views business strategy as consisting of two 
components which should be also well integrated: 
one component concerning the ‘external domain’ 
(= decisions about business scope, distinctive 
competencies and business relations with other 
organizations) and one component concerning 
the ‘internal domain’ (= decisions about its ad-
ministrative infrastructure/architecture, business 
processes and human resources skills). In the 
functional integration dimension the model views 
two domains, the business domain and the IS/ICT 
domain, and proposes integration between them 
at two levels: ‘strategic integration’ (=integration 
between their external domain components) and 
‘operational integration’ (=integration between 
their internal domain components).
Based on the above dimensions the SAM 
proposes that the complete enterprise systems 
strategic alignment consists in the integration 
between these four domains of strategic choice: 
business external strategy, ICT external strat-
egy, business internal strategy and ICT internal 

158  
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value 
strategy. Also using this model the authors pro-
pose and describe four alignment perspectives: 
business strategy execution (external business 
strategy  internal business strategy  internal 
ICT strategy), technology-based transformation 
(external business strategy  external ICT strat-
egy  internal ICT strategy), exploitation of ICT 
competitive potential (external ICT strategy  
external business strategy  internal business 
strategy) and service level improvement (external 
ICT strategy  internal ICT strategy  internal 
business strategy).
Smaczny (2001) argues that a major disadvan-
tage of the SAM is that its basic alignment ap-
proach is the sequential development of strategies; 
he states that this approach was the appropriate 
one for the period in which SAM was developed 
(characterized by a more stable business environ-
ment), but latter, due to major market changes and 
also due to the increased reliance of organizations 
on ICT, it has become slow and insufficient (at least 
for some industries and business contexts). For this 
reason he proposes a ‘fusion’ approach instead, 
which allows business and ICT strategies to be 
developed and implemented simultaneously. On 
the contrary Avison et al (2004) used successfully 
and validated this SAM in a financial services 
firm, and finally concluded that it has a good con-
ceptual and practical value; also they developed 
a framework for its practical application, which 
enables the technology and business management 
to determine the current level of alignment and to 
monitor and change it in the future as required. 
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning another 
approach that developed by Van Der Zee & De 
Jong (1999) for planning and setting goals for ICT 
and  evaluating its results based on the business 
context, which is founded on the concepts of the 
Balanced Business Scorecard. 
Also, a number of models/frameworks have 
been developed for assisting technical and 
business management in assessing the level of 
enterprise systems strategic alignment in their 
organization. The most widely used of them is the 
‘Strategic Alignment Maturity Model’ (SAMM) 
developed by Luftman (2000); it is based on 
six criteria of ICT strategic alignment maturity 
(Communications Maturity, Competency/Value 
Measurement Maturity, Governance Maturity, 
Partnership Maturity, Scope & Architecture Ma-
turity, Skills Maturity), each of them consisting 
of a number of attributes (sub-criteria), which are 
evaluated in a five-levels scale (Initial/Ad-hoc 
Process, Committed Process, Established Focused 
Process, Improved/Managed Process, Optimised 
Process). The SAMM enables the evaluation of 
ICT alignment practices in an organization and 
also the design of improvements of them. Another

Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value  
IT alignment maturity model has been developed 
by the IT Governance Institute (ITGI) (www.itgi.
org) as part of the CobiT (Control objectives for 
IT and related Technologies) framework (ITGI, 
2005). In particular, CobiT includes a process 
named ‘Define a Strategic Information Technol-
ogy Plan’, which aims to satisfy ‘the business 
requirement to strike an optimum balance of 
Information Technology opportunities and IT 
business requirements’; this process includes a 
strategic alignment maturity model consisting 
of six levels (0:Non-existent, 1:Initial/AdHoc, 
2:Repeatable and Intuitive, 3:Defined Process, 
4:Managed and Measurable, 5:Optimized) and 
also guidance for using it in order to assess the 
maturity level of an organization. Bleistein et al 
(2006a, 2006b) argue that ICT strategic alignment 
is necessary not only at the executive level, but 
also at the level of the individual IT projects as 
well; in this direction they propose a requirements 
engineering framework that addresses the busi-
ness strategy and the alignment of IT projects’ 
requirements with business strategy.
In conclusion, the research of this stream has 
produced some first ‘high-level’ models/frame-
works for directing and assessing enterprise 
systems strategic alignment, which offer some 
basic guidance, but in general they require further 
elaboration, evolution and adaptation to the new 
ICT that are continuously emerging and the new 
models of their exploitation by modern organiza-
tions. Therefore further research is required for the 
development of ‘lower-level’ and more practically 
applicable models/frameworks, which offer a more 
specific and complete guidance for directing and 
assessing enterprise systems strategic alignment, 
and also are adapted to the technological advances 
and the new globalized and highly competitive 
business environment; moreover, further research 
is required for validating such models/frameworks 
in ‘real-life’ conditions and situations.
Impact of Enterprise Systems 
Strategic Alignment on the Business 
Performance
This third research stream aims to investigate the 
impact of enterprise systems strategic alignment 
on business performance or on the contribution 
of enterprise systems to business performance. 
In this stream, despite its significance, has been 
conducted less research work that in the other 
two. In the following we review the main em-
pirical studies that have been conducted in this 
direction. King & Teo examined empirically the 
impact of four types of integration between the 
business plan (BP) and the information systems 
plan (ISP) (administrative, sequential, reciprocal 
and full integration) on the perceived contribu-
tion of enterprise systems to various measures of 
organizational performance and on the perceived 
extent of various types of ISP problems (organiza-
tion problems, implementation problems, database 
problems, hardware problems and cost problems) 
(Teo and King, 1996; King and Teo, 2000); using 
data from 157 large USA firms from the Corporate 
1000 Book and performing independent sample 
t-tests and calculating correlations they found 
that the extent of BP-ISP integration and also its 
proactive orientation has a statistically significant 
positive relation with the perceived enterprise sys-
tems contribution to organizational performance, 
and also a statistically significant negative relation 
with the perceived extent of ISP problems. Chan 
et al (1997) investigated empirically the impact 
of enterprise systems strategic alignment on 
perceived enterprise systems effectiveness and 
perceived business performance; using data from 
164 North-American financial services and manu-
facturing firms (from USA and Canada) with more 
than 100 employees from the Dun and Bradstreet 
directories they constructed a structural equa-
tions model (SEM), from which it was concluded 
that enterprise systems strategic alignment has 
statistically significant positive contributions to 

160  
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value 
both perceived enterprise systems effectiveness 
and perceived business performance. Using the 
same data Sabherwal and Chan (2001) addressed 
the same research question, but in regard to the 
business strategy the enterprise follows; they 
considered three different business strategies: ‘de-
fenders’, ‘prospectors’ and ‘analyzers’ and found 
that the strategic alignment of enterprise systems 
affects perceived business performance, only in 
enterprises following a ‘prospector’ or ‘analyzer’ 
business strategy, but not in the ones following a 
‘defender’ business strategy. Cragg et al (2002) 
examined the link between enterprise systems 
strategic alignment and four measures of per-
ceived firm performance (long term profitability, 
sales growth, financial resources availability and 
public  image & customer loyalty) in the context 
of small firms; using data from 250 small UK 
manufacturing firms and performing analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) they found that the subgroup 
of firms having higher levels of alignment had 
also higher levels of all these four measures of 
perceived firm performance than the ones with 
lower levels of alignment. Bergeron et al (2003), 
based on data collected through a mail survey 
from 110 Canadian small and medium firms, and 
using cluster analysis found that low-performance 
firms exhibited a conflictual coalignment pat-
tern of business strategy, business structure, IT 
strategy and IT structure.
It should be mentioned that all the above em-
pirical studies have used subjective (perceived) 
measures of business performance and/or enter-
prise systems contribution to business perfor-
mance. The only empirical investigation of the 
impact of enterprise systems alignment on busi-
ness performance that uses objective measures of 
business performance has been the one conducted 
by Byrd et al (2005); based on data from 275 fab-
ricated metal products manufacturing companies 
from South-eastern USA they constructed econo-
metric models with sales revenue per employee 
and profit per employee as dependent variables, 
while as independent variables they used the IT 
expenditure per employee, a measure of enterprise 
systems strategic alignment and an interaction 
term equal to the product of the above two vari-
ables. In these econometric models the coefficient 
of this interaction term was found to be positive 
and statistically significant, so it is concluded 
that there is a synergistic coupling (positive in-
teraction) between IT strategic alignment and IT 
investment with respect to both these measures 
of firm performance. However, the econometric 
models constructed in this study did not include 
some fundamental independent variables, such 
as non-IT capital and labour, which constitute 
basic determinants of firm output according to 
production economics (Nicholson, 2004).
In conclusion, from the research of this stream 
has been produced some first evidence of a posi-
tive contribution of enterprise systems strategic 
alignment to business performance. However, 
further research is required in order to under-
stand better the contribution of different types 
of strategic alignment of enterprise systems to 
various dimensions of business performance, 
in various types and sizes of enterprises and in 
various sectoral, national and cultural contexts, 
based on objective business performance mea-
sures and also on sound theoretical foundations 
from the area of production economics. Also it 
is necessary to investigate the dependence of 
the contribution of enterprise systems strategic 
alignment to business performance on various 
external and internal environment factors (e.g. 
business strategy, competition, etc.) and to identify 
its main moderators.
   
AN EMPIRIC AL INVESTI GATION
In this section are presented briefly the main 
results of an empirical study conducted by the 
authors, which contributes to the third of the 
above research streams, investigating the effect 
of enterprise systems strategic alignment on the 
contribution of enterprise systems investment to 

  161
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value  
business performance. It aims to overcome the two 
main deficiencies of the previous research on this 
issue, which have been mentioned in the previous 
section: use of subjective (perceived) measures 
of business performance and/or enterprise sys-
tems contribution to business performance, and 
construction of models that do not include all 
fundamental independent variables.
In this direction our study is based on two 
objective measures of business performance 
as basic dependent variables, the value added 
(=yearly sales revenue minus yearly expenses 
for buying materials and services) and the labour 
productivity (=value added per employee), and 
also on an objective measure of enterprise systems 
investment. We constructed theoretically sound 
econometric models for both these business per-
formance measures, which are based on the theory 
developed in the area of production economics, 
and in particular on the Cobb-Douglas production 
function (Nicholson, 2004), and include all funda-
mental variables. The Cobb-Douglas production 
function has been successfully used in the past 
for estimating the contribution to firm output of 
various firm inputs, including ICT investment 
(e.g. Brynjolfsson & Hitt, 1996; Stolarick, 1999; 
OECD, 2003; OECD, 2004). As recommended 
by this literature we used an extended form of 
the Cobb-Douglas production function, in which 
the capital is divided into ICT capital and non-
ICT capital:
0

VA= e
L
K
ICK
       	
	
(1)
where VA is the yearly firm value added, and L, 
K and ICK are the yearly labour expenses, the 
non-ICT capital and the ICT capital respectively, 
while the β1 – β3 are the corresponding output 
elasticities with respect to these inputs. By log-
transforming equation (1) we obtain the following 
linear model:
		
	
	
	
	
(2)
lnVA= 0

In order to investigate the effect of enterprise 
systems strategic alignment on the contribution 
of the ICT capital to firm value added we added to 
this model one ‘interaction term’ (Greene, 2003; 
Gujarati, 2003), which is equal to the product of a 
‘strategic alignment factor’ F (=degree of bilateral 
relationship between the ICT Plan and the Overall 
Business/Strategy Plan) and the ln(ICK):
lnVA= 0

         (3)   
Similar models have been also been constructed 
for the second business performance measure (de-
pendent variable), the value added per employee, 
but with all the above independent variables (L, 
K, ICK) normalised (divided by the number of 
firm employees N).
For constructing the above econometric models 
we used data that have been collected through 
a survey among Greek companies, which has 
been conducted in cooperation with ICAP, one of 
the largest business information and consulting 
companies of Greece. This survey was based on 
a structured questionnaire, which included ques-
tions about the basic financial data of the company 
(yearly sales revenue, expenses for materials and 
services, labour expenses, value of capital, value 
of ICT capital, etc.) and also about enterprise sys-
tems strategic alignment. We received completed 
questionnaires from 281 companies (99 small, 98 
medium and 84 large ones) from the 27 most im-
portant sectors of Greek economy. Their average 
yearly sales revenue was 183.7 million Euro and 
their average number of employees was 493.
Initially for the value added (VA) we esti-
mated the two models of the above equations 
(2) (basic model) and (3) (model with interaction 
term) and the results are shown in Tables 1 and 
2 respectively.
In the estimated basic model of Table 1 we 
remark that the coefficients of labour, non-ICT 
capital and ICT capital are all positive and statis-
tically significant, so we conclude that all these 

162  
Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value 
three inputs make a positive contribution to firm 
value added. These results confirm the conclusion 
of our previous study (Loukis & Sapounas, 2005), 
which had been based on a different data set, that 
ICT investments of Greek companies make a 
positive and statistically significant contribution 
to their output, so there is no evidence for ‘ICT 
Productivity Paradox’ in the Greek context. Also, 
we can see that the standardised coefficient of the 
ICT capital is higher than the one of the non-ICT 
capital, so we can conclude that the investment 
on enterprise systems contributes to value added 
more than the investment on ‘traditional capital’. 
In the model of Table 2 we can see that the coef-
ficients of labour, non-ICT capital and ICT capital 
remain all positive and statistically significant, 
and that the coefficient of the interaction term is 
positive and statistically significant as well and 
also of considerable magnitude; therefore it is 
concluded the strategic alignment of enterprise 
systems increases considerably their contribution 
to value added.
Next we estimated similar models for the 
labour productivity (=VA/N), but with all the 
independent variables divided by the number of 
firm employees N, and the results are shown in 
Tables 3 (basic model) and 4 (model with interac-
tion term) respectively.
In the model of Table 3 we can see that the 
coefficients of normalised labour, non-ICT capital 
and ICT capital are all positive and statistically 
significant, so we conclude that all these three 
inputs make a positive contribution to labour 
productivity as well. The comparison of their stan-
dardised coefficient leads to a conclusion similar 
to the one drawn from the model of Table 1: the

investment per employee on enterprise systems 
contributes to labour productivity more than the 
investment per employee on ‘traditional capital’. 
Finally from the model of Table 4 we can see that 
the coefficients of normalised labour, non-ICT 
capital and ICT capital remain all positive and 
statistically significant and also that the coefficient 
of the interaction term is positive, statistically 
significant and also of considerable magnitude; 
therefore it is concluded that the strategic align-
ment of enterprise systems increases considerably 
their contribution to labour productivity.
In conclusion, this empirical investigation 
contributes to the third of the research streams 
mentioned in the third section of this chapter and 
provides sound evidence that the strategic align-
ment of enterprise systems increases considerably 
their contribution to both these objective measures 
of business performance (value added and labour 
productivity). This evidence is theoretically sound 
and reliable, since it has been produced based on 
the construction of econometric models including 
all fundamental variables founded on the produc-
tion economics theory (Cobb-Douglas production 
function), and also using objective measures of 
business performance  and enterprise systems 
investment. Further research is in progress by 
the authors for investigating the impact of various 
types of enterprise systems strategic alignment at 
different hierarchical levels on the contribution 
of enterprise systems to business performance, 
and also on its dependence from various external 
and internal environment factors.

Enterprise Systems Strategic Alignment and Business Value 
CONC LUSION  and FUTURE
 
TRENDS
 
This chapter dealt with the alignment of enterprise 
systems with business strategy and its impact on 
the business value that enterprise systems gener-
ate. The research that has been conducted on the 
strategic potential of ICT (reviewed in the second 
section of this chapter), has generated consider-
able theoretical support and empirical evidence 
that ICT can provide (usually in combination 
with other enterprise resources) competitive 
advantages, which under specific conditions 
can be sustainable. This strategic potential of 
ICT has given rise to considerable research in 
the last twenty years concerning the strategic 
alignment of enterprise systems. This research 
(reviewed in the third section of this chapter) has 
produced a basic body of knowledge concerning 
various dimensions of the strategic alignment of 
enterprise systems, which can be quite useful for 
both researchers and practitioners in the area of 
enterprise systems. In particular, it has produced 
a basic conceptualization and understanding of 
enterprise systems strategic alignment, and some 
first ‘high-level’ models/frameworks for directing 
and assessing enterprise systems strategic align-
ment; also it has been produced some first evidence 
of a positive contribution of enterprise systems 
strategic alignment to business performance.  
However, further research is required in this 
area and also further practical exploitation by 
practitioners of the knowledge produced in this 
research. In particular, further research should be 
conducted first concerning the strategic potential 
of ICT and ways of exploiting them strategically 
in enterprises and combining them with other 
enterprise resources for achieving sustainable 
ICT-based competitive advantages. Also, further 
research is required for understanding better and 
in more depth the basic processes, barriers, critical 
success factors and benefits of enterprise systems 
strategic alignment, and for developing practically 
applicable models/frameworks, which can offer 
clear and complete guidance for directing and 
assessing the strategic alignment of enterprise 
systems. Finally, extensive research should be 
conducted concerning the ‘value’ generated by 
the strategic alignment of enterprise systems, 
in order to understand better the contribution 
of different types of strategic alignment of en-
terprise systems at different hierarchical levels 
to various dimensions of business performance; 
this research, in order to give reliable and practi-
cally useful results, and also to allow meaningful 
comparisons between different types of strategic 
alignment applied in different in various sectoral, 
national and cultural contexts, etc., should be based 
on objective business performance measures and 
also on sound theoretical foundations from the 
domain of production economics, such as the 
Cobb-Douglas production function. In the fourth 
section of this chapter is described an empirical 
investigation conducted by the authors that fol-
lows these principles, as a guidance for future 
research on this topic. Also it is necessary to 
investigate the dependence of the value generated 
by strategic alignment of the enterprise systems 
from various external and internal environment 
factors (e.g. business strategy, competition, etc.) 
and to identify its main moderators.
At the same time it is highly important that 
this knowledge on the basic concepts, methods 
and value of enterprise systems strategic align-
ment be practically exploited to a larger extent 
and be incorporated much more in the practice 
and processes of enterprises.

The market for enterprise systems (ES), continues to grow in the post millennium era as businesses 
become increasingly global, highly competitive, and severely challenged. Although the large enterprise 
space for ES implementation is quite stagnated, now all of the ES vendors are focusing on the small to 
medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector for implementations. This study looks at the current ES imple-
mentation scenario in the SME sector. The purpose of the study is to gain insights into what is a typical 
case of ES implementation and to understand how current implementations in the SME sector differ 
from the earlier implementations in the large enterprise sector through a perspective of ES vendors, ES 
consultants, and IT research firms in a NZ context. Implications for practice in implementation processes, 
implementation models, and organizational contexts are discussed. I
IntroductionTRCTI
Enterprise systems (ES), also known as enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) systems, are large, 
complex, highly integrated information systems 
designed to meet the information needs of orga-
nizations and are, in most cases, implemented 
to improve organizational effectiveness (Dav-
enport, 2000; Hedman & Borell, 2002; Markus 
& Tanis, 2000). These are comprehensive, fully 
integrated software packages supporting auto-
mation of most standard business processes in 

  171
Enterprise Systems in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
organizations  including  extended modules such 
as supply chain management (SCM) or customer 
relationship management (CRM) systems. ES 
applications connect and manage information 
flows across complex organizations, allowing 
managers to make decisions based on information 
that accurately reflects the current state of their 
business (Davenport & Harris, 2005; Davenport, 
Harris, & Cantrell, 2002). In a more integrated 
and global market, extended ES offers new func-
tions and new ways of configuring systems, as 
well as web-based technology to establish the 
integrated, extended business enterprise (Shanks, 
Seddon, & Wilcocks, 2003). The market for ES 
continues to grow despite much speculation on 
its future in the post millennium era. Although 
most large enterprises have completed their ES 
implementations by now, the ES market continues 
to grow in the small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SME) sector. A number of research studies have 
been conducted to establish and understand the 
critical success factors for ES implementations 
(e.g., Allen, Kern, & Havenhand, 2002; Bancroft, 
Sep, & Sprengel, 1998; Holland & Light, 1999; 
Parr & Shanks, 2000; Plant & Willcocks, 2006; 
Sarker & Lee, 2000; Scott & Vessey, 2002; Skok 
& Legge, 2001; Sumner, 1999; Yang & Seddon, 
2004). However, there has been little research that 
examines ES implementation at the strategic deci-
sion-making process level (Viehland & Shakir, 
2005) and compares current implementations in 
the SME sector with earlier implementations in 
the large organizations. The purpose of this study 
is to examine the current ES implementations 
scenario in New Zealand. The main objectives 
of this study are to explore what is a typical case 
of ES implementation and to understand how 
current implementations in the SME sector dif-
fer from the earlier implementations in the large 
enterprise sector. The study does so through a 
practitioners’ perspective, with interview data 
collected from ES vendors, ES consultants, and 
IT research firms who are actively engaged in 
ES implementation. This approach differs from 
the organizational approach usually found in the 
literature. This is a replication study following 
a similar approach used by Shakir (2002), who 
also investigated aspects of ES implementation 
in the NZ vendor-and-consultant community. 
The focus of that study was to identify key driv-
ers influencing ES adoption and implementation 
(e.g., Shakir and Viehland, 2004) whereas the 
focus of the current study is to understand how 
current implementations in the SME sector dif-
fer from the earlier implementations in the large 
enterprise sector. The current study extends and 
builds upon existing ES research.
Semi-structured interviews were conducted 
with key players of ES implementations in New 
Zealand including ES vendors, ES consultants, 
and IT research firms to explore the current ES 
implementation scenario. Several measures such 
as the number of users, modules implemented, 
cost of implementation, number of sites/locations 
where implemented, industry type, organization 
size, implementation phases, time to implement, 
implementation partners, and levels of customiza-
tion were discussed to understand a typical case 
of ES implementation and current implementation 
practices. The empirical findings are analyzed and 
reported in this paper. This study has been con-
ducted in a New Zealand (NZ) context which can 
be extended to show current trends worldwide. 
Reeahe
hodology
Using a qualitative research methodology, 
data were collected by way of semi-structured 
interviews with ten key respondents in the ES 
implementation industry. The interviews were 
carried out between February and August 2006. 
The key respondents were senior ES consultants 
or senior managers in the organizations which 
are key players in the field of ES in New Zealand, 
principally major ES vendors, ES consultants, 
and IT research organizations (see Table 1). The 
positions of the respondents included: director 

172  
Enterprise Systems in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
professional services, consulting manager, manag-
ing director, consulting practice director, partner 
group manager, vice president, consulting partner, 
general manager, and business consultant.
The purpose of the interviews was to seek 
insights from experienced ES stakeholders and 
professionals in answering what is a typical ES 
implementation in New Zealand and what are 
the current ES implementation practices? Ques-
tions were asked to extract information such as 
the number of users, the modules implemented, 
cost of implementation, number of sites where 
ES were implemented, type of industry and the 
size of the organizations in terms of number of 
employees and revenue.
Contact was first established with the respon-
dents through email and by phone. An introductory 
letter explaining the study briefly and seeking 
appointment for an interview was then sent to 
the respondents. On receipt of confirmation, the 
research information sheet along with the ques-
tions was sent prior to the interview. The answers 
were then discussed during the interview.
The respondents discussed ES implementa-
tions based upon their perspective and experience 
in terms of their ES applications, their clients, and 
their implementation methodologies. Ten face-
to-face meetings took place at the respondent’s 
organizations with one interview from each firm. 
The interviews lasted between 60 and 90 minutes 
each. The interviews were tape recorded and 
transcribed immediately after each interview. 
The empirical findings were analyzed using the 
Nvivo 7.0 qualitative software tool and the infer-
ences reported.
TypalS
 IMPLEMENTATIONS INImplemenaon n

Findings in this study reveal that the ES market 
is based on three different size segments -- the 
large enterprise segment, the medium-sized 
enterprise and the small firm. Most respondents 
used the number of employees as a measure for 
organizational size, however some respondents 
used revenue. Until recently, the focus of imple-
mentations was on the large enterprise – busi-
nesses and government agencies with more than 
500 employees and revenue greater than $250M. 
But now the focus for new implementations has 
shifted to the SME sector. The higher end of me-
dium-sized organizations in NZ employ between 
100 to 299 staff and have revenue between $50M 
to $200M. At the lower end of this segment, 
employees are between 20 to 100 and revenue is 
between $10M to $50M. In the small organization 
segment in NZ, employees are less than 20 and 
revenue less than $10M. 
Findings revealed that the large enterprises 
in NZ could have 200 or more users in a typical 
implementation. SME-based implementations 
could be between 20 and 200 users. A classifica-
tion by consultancy firm IDC, provided as part of 
the current study, shows the sizes of companies 
in terms of number of users where ES is imple-
mented as a percentage of companies in NZ. A 
small organization with less than 20 users are 26% 
in a NZ context, a medium-sized organization 
with 20 – 200 users at 49%, and any organiza-
tion above 200 users are large at 25% in the NZ 
market, as shown in Table 2. In another study by

Parr and Shanks (2000), in an Australian context, 
the number of users reported for small organiza-
tions is less than 100, medium less than 200, and 
large more than 200. 
Most respondents agreed that typical imple-
mentations in NZ currently are predominantly 
in the medium-sized enterprise category with 20 
- 200 users whereas the range used to be 200 – 500 
users a few years ago. These findings also confirm 
the Shakir (2002) study where the numbers of 
users for majority implementations in NZ were 
found to be 100 in medium-sized organizations 
with revenue between $50M- $250M.
Many small businesses below 100 users in NZ 
are companies that are basically part of multina-
tional corporations that implement solutions “but 
are more governed out of the regional or global 
office and the NZ office really has no control”. 
There are also many small businesses in NZ, the 
usual 20 – 25 user organizations that find it hard 
to justify an ES investment from a cost perspec-
tive, and typically do not implement expensive 
enterprise solutions from large vendors. These 
businesses prefer smaller inexpensive fragmented 
solutions. The big players like SAP and Oracle 
have also moved their business model and are 
now targeting smaller sites. 
Microsoft revealed that there are about 3,500 
medium-sized companies in NZ with employees 
from 100 to 200, which have not used one of the 
traditional ES as their core technology and a large 
proportion of these businesses did not have any 
technological solution to help them with their 
business problems. Microsoft believes they have 
400 of these as their current customer base. The 
growth market in NZ is in the medium-sized 
market segment. The declining markets include 
large companies which have already made their 
$10M investment and are not looking to make 
another investment. “These companies might 
make a million or half a million dollar investment 
but they are not the growth area for software 
companies.”  
It was evident from vendors’ perspective 
that the large enterprise space is quite stagnated 
now and all of the ES vendors are focusing on 
SME’s. Once an implementation is completed 
in an organization it goes out for a recycle every 
7-8 years, so these software vendors need to look 
for new customers. A general consensus among 
the software vendors was that more opportuni-
ties exist in the SME space or even at the lower 
end of the SME space. There are many small 
companies using home grown PC-based systems 
where their usage has outgrown their original 
requirements, but they have not been replaced. 
Or a hodgepodge of several different types of 
disparate systems exist which are expensive to 
integrate and maintain. The software vendors 
are trying to push into this space, although there 
are many challenges within that space such as 
limited resources, lack of infrastructure or lack 
of necessary in-house skills to cope with chang-
ing requirements associated with implementing 
an ES. The challenge facing software vendors is 
to figure out how they take the learning acquired 
in the large enterprise implementations down to 
a smaller enterprise. And it is a fallacy to believe 
that large organizations require different informa-
tion as compared to smaller organizations. They 
actually require quite the same information. It is a 
different degree of how much they require. Since

the SME space offered most opportunity, therefore 
larger players like SAP and Oracle are focusing 
on the SME sector which was overlooked earlier. 
“Whenever any new technology evolves there are 
leaders, followers, and the laggards. Typically the 
large enterprise organizations are the leaders but 
now they are beyond the leader category and it’s 
the SME now which are going up in that curve.” 
Traditionally SAP customers were the large 
enterprises, companies like Fonterra, Telecom, 
and Carter Holt Harvey in NZ. However, in the 
last 5 years due to  shift in focus on the SME’s, 
SAP is now moving to smaller companies with 
annual revenues $5M or more and are offering 
two different types of solutions. One is similar 
to a Microsoft based type solution called “Busi-
ness One”. The other is “All-in-One” and is the 
traditional SAP solution. The large enterprises 
are probably old SAP or one of the Oracle family 
member customers having implemented either 
PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, or Oracle systems. Now 
the focus of the software vendors is to compete 
for winning upgrade or add-on contracts from 
such large enterprises. SAP recently bagged such 
a contract from Fonterra which is an old loyal 
customer of SAP. But the main battlefield for new 
implementations is in the SME sector. 
The Microsoft respondent, who had earlier 
worked with other vendors (i.e. JD Edwards, 
PeopleSoft, and Oracle), remarked “there’s no 
such thing as a typical enterprise solution imple-
mentation in NZ”. According to him, the size of 
enterprises ranges from large with 500 or more 
users through to SME with 5 to 10 users at the 
lower end and hence there is no typical orga-
nization. He suggested however, the size of an 
organization that may drive business intelligence 
(BI) and knowledge capital as information tools 
are the medium to large organizations. Organiza-
tions that employ 100 plus staff and have an ES 
with a user base of more than 40 are more mature 
in the context of using information for business 
benefit. Microsoft’s largest customer in NZ has 
a user base of 130 while their smallest customer 
has just two with majority of customers in the 
range of 15 to 50 users in NZ. 
From an Oracle perspective, Oracle has three 
ES product lines - Oracle E-Business Suite, 
PeopleSoft and JD Edwards (JDE) from their 
acquisitions. The E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft 
are generally implemented in the larger enterprises 
and JDE in the SME’s. “Unfortunately, some of 
these lines are blurred because while a company 
may be a SME in NZ it may have some large 
offshore subsidiaries and therefore the group may 
not necessarily be tiny. For example, Fisher and 
Paykel might not be considered one of the largest 
companies in NZ but if you consider its holdings 
and offshore organizations, it is quite substantial 
from the NZ perspective of a large company cat-
egory that runs JDE. But typically, we apply the 
rule, an SME will be putting in JDE and if it is 
a large enterprise it will be putting E-Business 
Suite or PeopleSoft.” 
Most informants suggested that the ES 
implementations are typically divided into two 
“waves” or phases. The first wave or phase 1 is 
the implementation of core ES modules such as 
finance; materials management including purchas-
ing, warehousing and inventory; and operational 
modules including production management, pro-
duction planning, logistics, sales, and distribution. 
Some companies also include HR and payroll in 
the first phase.  In the second wave or phase 2, 
the companies implement supplementary modules 
(also called ERP II by Gartner (Zrimsek, 2002)), 
which include collaborative scenarios such as 
customer relationship management (CRM), supply 
chain management (SCM), supplier relationship 
management (SRM), and management services 
applications such as business intelligence (BI). 
Companies consider extending applications to 
satellite businesses or international operations 
in the second phase. These findings differed to 
the Shakir (2002) study which noted that phase 
1 implementations would always include the 
core modules of financials plus one or two other 
modules that may include SCM and CRM. This 
change can be attributed to the larger number of 

  175
Enterprise Systems in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
modules that ES vendors have put into the market 
in the last five years and SME owners being more 
ambitious in phase 2 implementations. Findings 
from the current study revealed that about 75% 
organizations are still in phase 1 and comprise 
mostly of new implementations in the SME sector. 
Balance 25% organizations are large that have 
moved into phase 2.
Traditionally, the time for implementation 
used to be more. However, since the focus is 
now towards SME’s, the implementation time 
has decreased. Earlier, processes such as model-
ling the organization and configuring the design 
used to take time. Now, using accelerators such 
as preconfigured business processes, the time to 
implement has been slashed, and so has the cost 
of implementation, which has made these systems 
much more affordable for the small businesses. 
In the Shakir (2002) study the length of time to 
the first phase implementations varied from 2.5 
months to 2 years. However, in the current study 
although the time for implementation varied be-
tween different informants, the general consensus 
was that currently large projects take around 
12 to 24 months and SME’s 3 to 12 months to 
complete. 
The cost of implementation is related to the 
number of modules, their types, the software pack-
age size and brand, the number of user licenses is-
sued, consulting costs, customization levels, along 
with the vendor or third party implementation cost. 
The hardware cost, and the cost of training and 
change management may be additional. According 
to informants in this study, in the SME sector, 
cost is the most important factor in selecting an 
ES for implementation. This was attributed by 
them, due to the smaller size of organizations 
and their limited funds for investment.
One vendor explained the reason for the high 
costs in large organizations compared to smaller 
ones is because large organizations have more 
complex operations and require more customiza-
tions. Their decision making processes may not 
be as efficient, and require a lot of change man-
agement procedures. On the other hand, smaller 
companies are more agile, more decisive, and 
especially more inclined to adopt a best practices 
implementation, greatly reducing customization 
and change management costs.

Locations are the one or more sites where the 
ES is implemented. Findings in this study show 
that currently more implementations are multi-site 
while in the earlier years implementations were 
more single site. This represents a continuing trend 
to more multi-site implementations in NZ, first 
observed by Shakir (2002). Traditionally, in large 
organization implementations, each location had 
its own implementation. However, companies in 
the SME sector are now optimizing by using one 
implementation at multi-locations because they 
are finding it too hard to manage and maintain 
separate implementations at all these locations. 
“Organizations are realizing its no use having IT 
administrators in all the locations doing a simi-
lar task.” The growth in export markets of NZ 
companies coupled with availability of Internet-
capable technology is also driving multi-site ES 
implementations in NZ. These implementations 
now are single instance which as explained by SAP 
meant that only one installation of the software 
is made to run on one server but the software is 
used at multiple locations. This environment is 
different to the earlier multi-instance where mul-
tiple installations of the software were made to 
run across the company in one or more locations. 
Typical implementations today are single instance 
multi-site implementations. Organizations are 
now implementing ES into one site which is their 
main manufacturing or business centre and this 
single instance is used by all other subsidiary sites, 
distribution warehouses, and sales offices. 
An implementation partner is mostly used for 
managing the ES project. Findings revealed that 
while a third party or a consultant implementer 
was popular in the past for large organization 
implementations, SME customers now prefer 
the software vendor’s direct involvement. This 
finding again confirms the Shakir (2002) study 
which also noted that vendor driven implemen-
tations were on the increase. A majority of the 
participants in the current study suggested that 
there has been a shift over the last five years. 
Customers traditionally preferring to work with 
the big 5 consulting companies for implementation 
are now more inclined to work with the software 
vendor directly so that they have a one-stop shop. 
Customers are starting to realize that the techni-
cal skills a software vendor provides may not be 
possible from consultants. One vendor explained 
what customers feel is that unless they actually 
talk to the software owners, they may not get the 
best value from a price perspective and from the 
perspective of having the best experts involved 
in the project. 
The post implementation and after sales sup-
port from the software vendor or the implementer 
to the customer organization normally includes 
three levels of support (see Figure 1). The first 
level is at the customers’ end where the customers’ 
super user (i.e. ES champion), determines whether 
it is a “how to” question -- where the user does 
not know how to use the system -- or something 
else. If the problem is related to the user or an 
organizational issue it is resolved at the first level. 
If not an end-user problem, then is it a general 
business requirement issue? If so, it is referred to 
the second level support which is the local vendor 
implementer or the implementation partner. The 
second level support determines whether it is a 
functionality or software performance setting 
issue that requires additional configuration to 
make it work and meet the business requirement. 
Finally, if the local implementation partner de-
termines that the problem is a software bug or 
a product-related issue it is raised to level three 
which is the support channel inside the software 
vendor. So it is a typically a three tier support 
model as shown in Figure 1.
Customization is the process in which changes 
are made to the ES software during the implemen-
tation phase to suit the needs of the organization 
where it is being implemented. This happens when 
the best business practices embedded in the ES 
software do not satisfy the needs of the business, 
and the software is changed to meet the require-

  177
Enterprise Systems in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
ments of the organization (Davenport & Prusak, 
1998; Kumar & Van Hillegersberg, 2000).
There are two implementation strategies or 
models. The first is the “comprehensive custom-
ization” type when many and sometimes major 
changes to the software are performed during 
the implementation to satisfy business require-
ment. The second is “vanilla” or “out-of-the-box” 
when the ES software application is implemented 
without any changes to the software and the 
business processes within the organization are 
changed to suit the functionality of the software. 
SAP explained that there is a potential source 
of confusion about the extent of customization 
as every project needs some form of customer 
specific reports, customer specific interfaces, and 
customer specific data conversion programs. ES 
software is designed to meet most customization 
requirements by adjusting parameter settings. All 
modern software vendors now have a software 
architecture that does not require modification to 
the core software statements to achieve results. 
The user access can be built through parameter 
settings to accommodate specific requirements. 
However, this should not be confused with what 
is called true customization in which the core 
software is actually modified.
Findings in this study revealed that organiza-
tions now view the ES software not as a bunch of 
statements but as pre-defined business processes. 
These organizations prefer to adhere to the pre-
defined business processes in the software and 
change their own processes to the software’s 
requirements. The companies doing this are more 
likely to be successful in capturing the benefits 
and controlling the cost of the implementation 
as this also helps in future upgrades, and the 
overall cost of ownership gets reduced. These 
findings also confirm the Brehm, Heinzl, and 
Markus (2001) study in which they have esti-
mated that greater the customization, the more 
will the implementation encounter difficulties, 
suffer on cost, schedule and performance metrics. 
The company will also experience difficulties 
when attempting to upgrade to a later package 
release. But on the other hand the organizational 
adaptation to the ES will be easy and the system 
will meet the needs of the business. The current 
study revealed that vanilla implementations are 
more common in the SME category whereas 
the large organizations are more likely to have 
comprehensive implementations. Shakir and 
Viehland (2004) noted cost as a driver towards 
vanilla implementations as the two approaches 
has major implications on the change manage-
ment strategy. When the best practice is chosen, 
people issues become top priorities whereas when 
the implementation strategy is geared towards

customization, it is more of a technical challenge. 
Parr and Shanks (2000) have reported in their 
study on different ES implementation approaches 
that vanilla implementations are usually single site 
and comprehensive multi-site. However, the cur-
rent study suggests that vanilla implementations 
could be single or even multi-site and currently 
more implementations are multi-site. 
An implementation is considered new when 
it is implemented in an organization for the first 
time. An upgrade is when a revised version of 
the software with some additional functionality 
is implemented to upgrade the existing software 
in the current implementation (Dalal, Kamath, 
Kolarik, & Sivaraman, 2004). Add-ons, also called 
bolt-ons, include adding new modules to the exist-
ing implementation. Replace means change the 
existing implementation with a different vendor’s 
software. The Shakir (2002) study observed that 
while new implementations were happening in 
SME’s, large organizations were focusing only 
on upgrades and add-ons comprising of 10-15% 
of the total implementations. However, findings 
in this study suggest an equal split between new 
implementations vs. upgrades, add-ons, and re-
placements in NZ organizations. 
In the current study, SAP suggested a 50-50 
split. “We’re definitely focusing on new imple-
mentations because that’s where our goal is. 
However, we have to look after our existing cus-
tomer base and as their requirements change, the 
presentation of our software in their business may 
also need change.” In the case of replacements, 
Oracle noted that an organization will replace an 
ES only if there is a need to satisfy some major 
benefit which remains unsatisfied in their existing 
system, because it is expensive to replace. It is 
not just the cost of the software, but it is the huge 
organizational change that the organization has 
to go through to replace an enterprise system. 
Oracle also revealed that in the past this cost was 
underestimated, but “replacement cost is three 
times the cost of upgrade”. Oracle also revealed 
the maintenance aspect which included the cost 
of up-grading the ES. “Typically in every five-
year period, companies spend up to four times 
the initial purchasing implementation cost, just 
to maintain the ES. That is why IT budgets in 
organizations allocate substantially for upgrade 
support as opposed to new requirements.”
Another model used during ES implementa-
tion is the best-of-breed, as opposed to a single 
vendor implementation. The best-of-breed model 
includes implementation of a mix of different ven-
dor modules which the vendor specializes in, to 
have the best of everything (James & Wolf, 2000; 
Pender, 2000). A single vendor implementation 
includes all the modules from a single vendor 
as an integrated package. Findings in this study 
revealed that typically best-of-breed model was 
adopted by many organizations in the past. For 
example, an organization might install HRM 
module from PeopleSoft, financials from Oracle 
and manufacturing from SAP in the first phase. 
Then subsequently install bolt-on modules such as 
CRM from Microsoft, SCM from SAP or Oracle, 
or BI from Cognos in the second phase. 
However, both customers and vendors are now 
moving towards single vendor implementation. 
This is because the additional benefit received 
from a best-of-breed implementation is vastly 
outweighed by the cost of implementing, main-
taining, and managing those disparate systems. 
Organizations have realized that although there are 
really good benefits in PeopleSoft, SAP, and Oracle 
for the different modules, the cost to implement 
and maintain is enormous. While they may only 
get 85% to 90% of the best-of-breed benefit in a 
single vendor implementation that is preferable 
especially since it can save three times the cost of 
implementation and maintenance. Vendors also do 
not release new versions of the software exactly 
at the same time, therefore managing the upgrade 
path becomes difficult, the investment depreciates 
faster than expected, and organizations are un-
able to take advantage of the new features of the 
software. This aspect differed from the findings 
of the Shakir (2002) study which noted that while 

  179
Enterprise Systems in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
traditional ERP implementations still dominate 
new implementations, upgrades, add-ons, and 
replacements appear to favor the best-of-breed 
model. The best-of-breed model is also a consid-
eration for new implementations, especially for 
organizations that operate in niche industries.
The application service provider (ASP) imple-
mentation model is one in which a service provider 
provides an ES application software as a service 
or hosting to organizations at a fixed cost for a 
specific period (Malcolm, 2002; Pamatatau, 2002). 
There was a mixed response from respondents on 
this model. One vendor noted, “ASP pops up every 
5 years and was a bit like an economy that came 
and went and nothing really happened. I’m not 
too sure it is addressing a real market requirement 
need”. Another vendor responded “I don’t think 
this model has picked up at all”. However, yet 
another vendor confirmed that the ASP model is 
used in NZ. “We use it. Customers are happy with 
it. We have time and resources for providing the 
service. There’s a huge market there. These are 
small companies that do want an ES and they don’t 
mind paying sixty to seventy thousand dollars a 
year but are not able to spend half a million to one 
million dollars for buying the software. It is not 
too difficult for these companies to put up a few 
servers each with the latest operating system of 
windows. We’ve got the people and it’s not much 
of their time, so we can provide this service. There 
is no trend, but there is a huge market out there if 
marketed properly.” Except for this one vendor, 
the overall response was not very positive for the 
use of the ASP implementation model, either in 
the current ES environment or in the recent past 
(Shakir, 2002).
Another model referred to as the business pro-
cess outsourcing (BPO) or the managed service 
model was cited by respondents as a growing 
implementation model in a NZ context. In this 
model outsourcers run a customized managed 
service of ES implementation for customers where 
effectively a single solution is sold to a customer. 
One consultant explained that this is a low cost 
commodity solution where the customer prefers 
not to manage the ES. This model positions it-
self very much in the SME market for example, 
in outsourcing transaction services or specific 
functions like finance, or payroll, or a similar 
function to a third party supplier. “An organiza-
tion may have implemented Oracle financials or 
SAP finance for example, but may be paying, 
say to IBM, to run the technology and specific 
functions for them”.
Despite its risks, ES implementation is perva-
sive in many different types of industries (Kumar 
& Van Hillegersberg, 2000; Mabert, Soni, & Ven-
kataraman, 2000). A majority of the respondents 
noted that ES implementations are covered in most 
industry sectors in NZ; however, some respondents 
provided specific examples in highlighting trends. 
SAP explained that traditionally, over the last 10 
years, there have been many implementations in 
the consumer packaging goods, manufacturing, 
forestry, and pulp and paper industries. However, 
in the last two years there has been a slight shift in 
the ES market in NZ with several implementations 
in the retail and utilities industry, and this trend 
is likely to continue for the next two years. 
ES maturity in an organization depends upon 
the number of year’s experience the organization 
has had with ES and the stage of ES implemen-
tation (Hawking, Stein, & Foster, 2004). This 
concept of ES maturity and the different stage of 
ES implementation is reinforced by the Nolan and 
Norton Institute (2000) classification that groups 
implementations into levels of maturity such as 
beginning where ES is implemented in the past 12 
months, consolidating where ES is implemented 
between 1 and 3 years, and mature where ES is 
implemented for more than 3 years.
Findings revealed that most NZ organiza-
tions are reasonably mature with ES technology 
and IT in general. Most large organizations and 
many SMEs in NZ have been using some form 
of ES technology for more than a decade and are 
at a fairly advanced level of maturity. This also 
confirms the Shakir (2002) study which noted 

180  
Enterprise Systems in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
that although NZ is a small country, technology 
is mature and on par with what’s happening in 
the U.S.
However, as per the respondents, there are a 
couple of issues in managing ES projects which 
do highlight the slower pace of ES maturity within 
the NZ industry. First, many NZ organizations do 
not conduct a proper business justification of their 
implementation. Although some improvement has 
been seen in the last couple of years, most NZ 
organizations produce little or no value assess-
ments that often lead to weak business cases and 
insufficient benefit models which cannot be used 
for benefit tracking. Plant and Willcocks (2006) 
in their study on critical success factors for ES 
implementations have also found an increased 
emphasis upon the determination of clear goals 
and objectives at the project outset as one of the 
important factors for ES implementation suc-
cess. Second, many organizations in NZ believe 
implementation of ES is a technology challenge. 
However, according to most respondents, it is more 
about change management, people, and processes 
and less about technology. With better business 
case development, these are two areas in which 
many NZ companies are struggling.
Respondents also revealed that typically when 
a new system is implemented, productivity drops 
for a period and then goes up again. Oracle sug-
gested the depth of the drop depends upon how well 
the system is implemented, how well the change is 
managed, how well the business case is defined, 
and how well the managers are measuring and 
managing benefits before the organization starts 
seeing the benefits starting to flow through. 
Until a few years ago the majority of orga-
nizations did not use the ES in its true capacity. 
ES was used as a financial system, as a central 
repository for HRM records, or as a method for 
raising purchase orders. This was because the 
organizations had not thought about what they 
were trying to optimize, what benefits they were 
trying to bring into the organization, what they 
were trying to change, how they were trying to 
manage the business, and whether they could 
actually get the information to manage the busi-
ness. However, recently the software vendors have 
started to see several companies trying to find 
ways to get more value out of their investment. 
Companies have recently started asking how to 
establish analytical processes to optimize and 
realize business value from their ES investment. 
Many NZ organizations have already completed 
their first phase of ES needs and are now extend-
ing into the second phase with CRM, SCM, or BI. 
Most respondents agreed that the slower pace of 
ES maturity within the NZ organizations is due to 
the limited spending power, which is attributable 
to the comparatively small NZ economy. However, 
this trend is now changing. NZ organizations have 
now started realizing the value of technology and 
its use to stay ahead of competition.
Findings revealed that the mix between na-
tional and international ES implementations is 
a 50-50 split in NZ. Respondents noted that on 
several occasions the implementations started as a 
national implementation but quite quickly reached 
out to countries like Fiji, Australia, Europe, Singa-
pore or wherever the sales and distribution offices 
are located. Although many NZ companies are 
based in NZ and the reach is national, there is a 
growing trend in NZ organizations to expand to 
global markets therefore now the reach is becom-
ing global. This is also supported by the growing 
export-oriented market of NZ organizations.
Global implementations are also part of multi-
national organizations that implement ES within 
their NZ companies. These implementations are 
normally “roll-outs” based on a global template 
that includes standard business processes. The 
“roll-out”, as explained by one consultant, is 
an implementation generated from a template 
customized for an overseas location. The roll-out 
starts with a massive data set prepared by the 
first implementation followed by the addition of 
country specific and localized data. For example, 
GST or VAT percentages are different, the states 
as part of the addresses are different, and therefore 

  181
Enterprise Systems in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
a couple of master files which are country specific 
are implemented on top of the local customer and 
vendor base that is created. The data-set roll-out 
is established using country specific data where 
new country settings override the template set-
tings. A separate dedicated warehouse for these 
locations is also included for tracking transactions. 
However, many NZ companies are governed by 
their parent organizations; hence all the deci-
sion making for the ES implementation is done 
offshore by the parent company, without much 
control from the NZ businesses. This is nothing 
new. Implementations based on global templates 
and critical decision-making being made offshore 
were observed in Shakir’s 2002 study. In sum-
mary, ES implementations in NZ organizations 
are moving from national towards a global reach 
either by expansion into overseas markets or off-
shore ownership.

The main objective of this study was to under-
stand typical ES implementations and practices 
in NZ and how current implementations in the 
SME sector differ from the earlier implementa-
tions in the large enterprise sector. The findings 
are analyzed and summarized in table 4, based 
on different organizational size segments of the 
ES market. Table 4 suggests the different ES 
implementation determinants for both large and 
SME organizations and explains the relationships 
between the organization size and the implemen-
tation process variables.
It is evident from the table that typical cases 
of ES implementation in NZ exist in both large 
and SME organization segments. Typical imple-
mentations in the large organization segment 
with revenues more than $250M are currently in 
phase 2 and the organizations are fairly mature

with their ES. These organizations are likely to be 
in the phase of acquiring collaborative scenarios 
like SCM or CRM, or management services 
applications such as BI. These can be single or 
multi-site implementations. The number of users 
is estimated to be 200 or above and the cost of 
the project is likely to be more than $2M. In the 
SME segment, typical implementations are in 
organizations with revenue between $50 - 200M. 
These implementations are likely to be new with 
two or more core ES modules. These can be single 
or multi-site implementations with number of 
users in the range of 20 – 200 and the cost of the 
implementation between $100,000 – 1M.
Many ES implementations in New Zealand 
are several years old now however, these com-
panies have only recently started asking how to 
actually optimize processes and realize business 
value from their ES investments. Organizations 
are establishing analytical processes for track-
ing benefits continuously improving in taking 
advantage of the technology.
The findings of this study are limited to the 
views of professionals from different ES vendors, 
ES consultants, and IT research organizations and 
are limited by a small sample size. There may also 
have been some influence on the responses by the 
commercial interests of the firm the participant 
worked for. However, the study has achieved its 
objectives. This is achieved due to the seniority 
and experience of the respondents within the or-
ganizations interviewed, and the position of these 
organizations as key players in the ES industry 
in New Zealand. Further research is in progress 
to analyze the current practices and the critical 
effectiveness constructs of ES in New Zealand 
from the practitioners’ perspectives identified 
by this study. R

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a vital and growing part of any national economy. Like 
most large businesses, SMEs have recognized the importance of knowledge management. This Chapter 
investigates the use of knowledge processes and knowledge methods for SMEs. The learning objectives 
of this Chapter are to assess the role of knowledge management and knowledge processes in SMEs. 
Furthermore, the reader should be able to describe major knowledge management programs in SMEs 
and assess how they provide value for organizations. Empirical studies conducted by the authors show 
that for SMEs, only four knowledge processes are important: (1) knowledge identification, (2) knowledge 
acquisition, (3) knowledge distribution and (4) knowledge preservation. Based on the research result 
of several empirical studies, an integration concept for knowledge processes, knowledge methods, and 
knowledge software tools for SMEs is introduced and discussed.
Inoduon
The academic literature on knowledge manage-
ment has become a major research field in differ-
ent disciplines in the last decade (Davenport & 
Prusak, 1998). Through knowledge management, 
organizations are enabled to create, identify 
and renew the company’s knowledge base and 
to deliver innovative products and services to 
the customer. Knowledge management is a pro-

186  
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
cess of systematically managed and leveraged 
knowledge in an organization. For Mockler and 
Dologite (2002, p. 18) knowledge management 
“refers to the process of identifying and gener-
ating, systematically gathering and providing 
access to, and putting in use anything and ev-
erything which might be useful to know when 
performing some specified business activity. The 
knowledge management process is designed to 
increase profitability and competitive advantage 
in the marketplace”. Before implementing a 
knowledge integration concept, there must be a 
common understanding of the term knowledge, 
its characteristics, and its impact on knowledge 
management. The multi-faceted nature of the term 
knowledge is reflected in a variety of definitions 
(Kakabadse, Kouzmin, & Kakabadse, 2001, p. 
138). Davenport and Prusak (1998) use the term 
“knowledge in action” to express the character-
istics of  the term knowledge management in a 
way it is valuable for the company and to capture 
it in words because it resists in the minds of the 
humans and their action. Davenport and Prusak 
(1998, pp. 6) identify five key components that 
describe the term knowledge management:
1.	
The first component is experience. Knowl-
edge develops over time, and it builds on 
the lifelong learning and training practice 
of an employee. Experience has a historical 
perspective, and it is based on the skills the 
knowledge-worker applies to familiar pat-
terns to make connections between these 
links. 
2.	
The second component of the term knowl-
edge is “ground truth” (Davenport & Pru-
sak, 1998) which is a term used by the U.S. 
Army’s Center for Army Lessons Learned 
(CALL). CALL used the term “ground truth” 
to express experiences that come from the 
ground rather than from theories and gen-
eralizations. “Ground truth” refers to the 
way that the people involved know what 
works and what does not. CALL experts’ 
take part in real military situations, and 
they pass their observations to the troops 
through videotapes or photos. The success 
of this knowledge management approach 
lies in “After Action Review” programs 
which try to cover the gap between what 
happened during an action and what was 
supposed to happen. This reflection process 
helps uncover disparities and differences 
3.	
The third component is complexity. The skill 
to solve complex problems and the ability to 
know how to deal with uncertainties distin-
guish an expert from a normal employee. 
4.	
A forth characteristic of knowledge is judg-
ment. An expert can judge new situations 
based on experience gained over time. 
Furthermore, they have the ability to refine 
them through reflection. Knowledge, in this 
sense, is a living system that interacts with 
the environment. 
5.	
Finally, knowledge is about heuristics and 
intuition. An expert acts based on their 
intuitive knowledge. 
Knowledge is tacit, action-oriented, sup-
ported by rules, and it is constantly changing. 
In a global and interconnected society, it is more 
difficult for companies to know where the best 
and most valuable knowledge is, thus it becomes 
more difficult to know what the knowledge is. A 
successful implementation of knowledge man-
agement only can be achieved in a culture that 
supports knowledge sharing and transfer. An 
appropriate organizational culture can empower 
effective knowledge management. The organiza-
tional culture of a company consists of its shared 
values or norms which are transmitted through 
common beliefs and feelings, regularities of 
behavior, and historical processes. Trompenaars 
and Hampden-Turner (2006, p. 6) define culture 
as a group of people concerned with problem 
solving processes and reconciliation dilemmas. 
Culture itself has three different levels. The first, 
and highest level, is national culture or regional 

  187
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
society; the second level describes organiza-
tional culture, and, finally, professional culture 
focuses on the knowledge of specific groups. A 
knowledge culture is the most important value for 
the implementation of knowledge management, 
because organizational knowledge resides in the 
culture, structure and individuals who make up 
the organization. 
Besides culture and networking, the objec-
tive for knowledge management technology is 
the creation of a connected environment for the 
exchange of knowledge (Mentzas, Apostolou, 
Young, & Abecker, 2001). These new software 
products facilitate communication and interac-
tion among people as well as among people and 
systems. Mentzas et al. (2001, p. 95) discuss two 
key components that are required to support the 
sharing of information and knowledge: 
•	
Collaboration facilities for knowledge 
workers are mainly the domain of group-
ware products. Other technology examples 
in this group are email systems, workflow 
automation, discussion groups, document 
management, shared databases, scheduling 
and calendar functions. 
•	
Discovery facilities are required for search-
ing and retrieval purposes. Knowledge 
workers are in constant need of finding and 
accessing information and knowledge from 
other experts. A wide variety of information 
sources support the finding of expertise, 
and they include the Internet, corporate 
Intranets, legacy systems and corporate 
local area networks (LANs). 
Knowledge management is more than the 
technological solutions provided to give people 
access to better and more relevant information 
(Wang & Plaskoff, 2002, p. 113). It is important 
that the design of the knowledge management 
systems reflects the mindset of the knowledge 
workers and their way of offering highly quali-
tative knowledge solutions with quick solution 
processes. An effective knowledge management 
system must integrate people, processes, technol-
ogy and the organizational structure.
Historically, knowledge management focused 
on the domain of larger organizations. Conse-
quently issues of culture, networking, organiza-
tional structure and technological infrastructure 
have been examined upon the implementation 
of knowledge management initiatives in large 
multi-national organizations and seem to give 
little relevance (Delahaye, 2003) to small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs). However, the suc-
cess and growth of SMEs depends on how well 
they manage the knowledge of their knowledge 
workers. Managers in SMEs have to recognize 
that the uniqueness and creativity of each knowl-
edge worker will lead to customer satisfaction 
and the success of the SMEs. Dezouza & Awazu 
(2006) point out that SMEs have to compete 
with know-how in order to gain competitive 
advantages. As SMEs do not have much money 
to spend on knowledge management initiatives, 
knowledge must be leveraged so that goals can 
be achieved in an effective and efficient manner. 
There are several research articles dealing with 
knowledge management in SMEs (2001), but only 
a few empirical studies have been conducted to 
see the impact of knowledge processes in them. 
McAdam & Reid (2005) concluded that the time 
is right for knowledge management within the 
SME-sector. The results of their comparative 
study of large organizations and SMEs showed 
that both have much to gain from the development 
of knowledge management systems. Salojärvi, 
Furu & Sveiby (Dunkelberg & Wade, 2007) 
concluded that SMEs should be able to enhance 
their performance and competitive advantages 
by a more conscious and systematic approach to 
knowledge management. 
There are several quantitative (2007, p. 240) 
and qualitative definitions of the term SME 
depending on regional and national differences. 
Street & Cameron (Fink & Ploder, 2007a, 2007b) 
conducted a literature review from 1990 until 

188  
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
2002 to analyze the current status of SMEs and 
found a variety of definitions of SMEs with the 
following clustering: individual characteristics 
of the entrepreneur, organizational character-
istics of the SME, relationship characteristics, 
performance characteristics, strategic planning 
characteristics  or relationship characteristics. In 
2000, the European Council set the clear strategic 
goal for the European Union (EU) of becoming 
“the most competitive and dynamic economy in 
the world, capable of sustaining economic growth 
with more and better jobs and greater social cohe-
sion” by the year 2010 (ec.europa.eu/growthand-
jobs). SMEs are playing a key role in European 
economic performance because they account for 
a high proportion of the Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) and employ some two thirds of the European 
workforce. According to the OECD Small and 
Medium Enterprise Outlook 2005 (www.oecd.
org) SMEs are very important for strengthening 
economic performances. They represent over 95 
percent of enterprises in most OECD countries, 
and generate over half of private sector devel-
opment. Looking at the European countries of 
Austria and Switzerland including Liechtenstein 
a similar SME landscape can be found. Accord-
ing to the Austrian Statistical Year Book (www.
statistik.at) and the Austrian Institute for SMEs 
Research (www.kmuforschung.ac.at) in the year 
2006, 99.7 percent of companies in Austria, or 
297,800, were SMEs. According to the data from 
CHSME (www.kmu.admin.ch), 99.7 percent of 
the companies in Switzerland are SMEs. 
In the United States (US), the definition of small 
business is set by a government department called 
the Small Business Administration (SBA) Size 
Standards Office. The SBA uses the term “size 
standards” to indicate the largest a concern can be 
in order to still be considered a small business. It 
must also be independently owned and operated. 
Unlike the European Union, which has simple 
definitions applied to all industries, the United 
States has chosen to set size standards for each 
individual industry. This distinction is intended 
to better reflect industry differences. SMEs are 
also of high importance for in the US Economy. 
Similar to Europe, more than 97 percent of the 
firms in the US can be defined as SME.
A comparable influence of SMEs on economic 
value can be found in the report of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (www.apec.com), where 
about 90 percent of enterprises are SMEs. During 
their 2006 meeting in Beijing the members agreed 
to strengthen SME´s competitiveness for trade and 
investment. For example, SMEs account for more 
than 95 percent of companies in Australia. Of the 
624,010 SMEs in Australia, more than two thirds 
employ between one and four people. A further 
180,880 SMEs employ between five and 19 people 
meaning that 93.5 percent of people employed by 
SMEs in Australia are employed by what can be 
described as ‘micro-SMEs’, namely companies 
with fewer than 20 employees.
In section two the authors introduce an integra-
tion concept for the implementation of knowledge 
management systems in SMEs by taking the 
knowledge processes, knowledge methods and 
supporting knowledge software tools into consid-
eration. Section three discusses future research 
and describes objectives.

Research Framework and SMSE 
Definition
This section focuses on discussing the integra-
tion concept for SMEs. Our research findings 
(2006) indicate that SMEs need only four key 
knowledge processes (1) Knowledge Identifica-
tion, (2) Knowledge Acquisition, (3) Knowledge 
Distribution and (4) Knowledge Preservation and 
therefore the authors propose a knowledge layer 
concept designed specifically for implementing 
knowledge management in SMEs. The empiri-

  189
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
cal studies conducted by the authors combine 
the concepts of knowledge processes as well as 
knowledge methods for SMEs in a single study. 
The key objective of this section is the matching 
of knowledge methods to knowledge processes 
in these companies. Figure 1 illustrates the re-
search process for modeling knowledge processes 
in SMEs and assigning knowledge methods to 
each of the four key processes with supporting 
software tools. The basic research model is the 
“building block” approach by Probst, Raub & 
Romhardt (Laudon & Laudon, 2006) with their 
description of the knowledge processes (Figure 
1, layer 1). Involved are eight components that 
form two cycles, one inner cycle and one outer 
cycle. Among other knowledge process models 
(2006), the building block approach of Probst, 
Raub & Romhardt (Edwards & Kidd, 2003) has 
the advantage that it is well known in European 
companies, including SMEs, and furthermore it 
has a unique and complete design.
The authors use the definition of SMEs of the 
European Commission 2006 for their research de-
sign. The European Commission analyzes SMEs 
by using the following three characteristics: (1) 
number of employees, (2) annual turnover and (3) 
total assets. Characterized through these three 
factors, the European Commission differenti-

ates between (1) middle enterprises [fewer than 
250 employees and less than EURO 50 million 
annual turnover or less than EURO 43 million 
total assets], (2) small enterprises [fewer than 50 
employees and less than EURO 10 million an-
nual turnover or less than EURO 10 million total 
assets] and (3) micro enterprises [fewer than 10 
employees and less than EURO 2 million annual 
turnover or less than EURO 2 million total assets]. 
Figure 2 illustrates the European Commission’s 
definition of SMEs. Focusing on this definition, 
the authors follow the research view of a quanti-
tative perspective of SMEs. This means, that all 
enterprises with fewer than 250 employees and 
less than EURO 50 million annual turnover or 
less than EURO 43 million total assets in Austria 
and Switzerland including Liechtenstein are the 
target population. In figure 1 layer 2 symbolizes 
the quantitative view of the SME definition. 
K owledge Processes Approaches 
(Layer 1)
Business process modeling (Davenport & Prusak, 
1998) has become a major research field in the 
information systems discipline in the last ten years. 
Davenport sees the term business process as “a 
structured, measured set of activities designed 
to produce a specified output from a particular 
customer or market” (Probst et al., 2006; Rao, 
2004). However, in recent years, not only busi-
ness process management, but also knowledge 
management has been developing into a new 
research field (2003, p. 124). The term knowledge 
process modeling comes from the linking of these 
two research fields. Key features of knowledge 
intensive processes can be described as follows: 
diversity of sources and media, variance and 
dynamic development of the process organiza-
tion, plentiful process participants with different 
expertise, use of creativity, high level of innova-
tion and influence on the area of the decision. 
Edwards and Kidd (2000) used the following 
five characteristics to emphasize that knowledge 
management and business process management 
should be integrated: 
•	
Knowledge management is important for 
business if the initiative implies an advantage 
for the customers. The idea of implementing 
Figure 2. SME definition according to the European Commission definition

  191
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
the customer’s requests – may be internal 
or external – is the basis for including the 
customer.
•	
Knowledge doesn’t follow business borders. 
Business processes also model activities 
carried out by global trading companies and 
lay the foundations for modeling knowledge 
intensive processes.
•	
Knowledge management can only be effi-
cient if it follows a structured model. Busi-
ness processes are modeled by structured 
actions and they are necessary to deduce 
knowledge intensive processes.
•	
The success of knowledge management 
depends on the measurement of knowledge. 
There is a similarity to the measurement of 
business processes. The measurement of 
the knowledge potential provides a central 
position and biases the success.
•	
Knowledge management is affected by a 
holistic approach. Every part of the business 
process modeling is important for success 
but every aspect should be considered.
In addition, knowledge management and busi-
ness process modeling initially focused on large 
companies. The knowledge economy has to shift 
from focusing on large companies to small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SME) because of their 
importance for industrial economies. The main 
reason behind today’s change of focus is that 
all businesses depend on methods and tools of 
knowledge management in order to gain competi-
tive advantages and to deal with the knowledge 
potential of their employees.
The basic research model is the “building 
block” approach by Probst, Raub & Romhardt 
(2006) with their description of the knowledge 
processes (Figure 1, layer 1). Involved are eight 
components that form two cycles, one inner cycle 
and the other outer cycle. The inner cycle is com-
posed of six key knowledge processes:
•	
Knowledge Identification is the process of 
identifying external knowledge for analyz-
ing and describing the company’s knowledge 
environment. 
•	
Knowledge Acquisition refers to what forms 
of expertise the company should acquire 
from outside through relationships with cus-
tomers, suppliers, competitors and partners 
in co-operative ventures.
•	
Knowledge Development is a building block 
which complements Knowledge Acquisi-
tion. It focuses on generating new skills, 
new products, better ideas and more effi-
cient processes. Knowledge Development 
includes all management actions consciously 
aimed at producing capabilities.
•	
Knowledge Distribution is the process of 
sharing and spreading knowledge which is 
already present within the organization.
•	
Knowledge Utilization consists of carrying 
out activities to ensure that the knowledge 
present in the organization is applied pro-
ductively for its benefit.
•	
Knowledge Preservation is the process 
where the selective retention of informa-
tion, documents and experience required 
by management takes place.
In addition, there are two other processes 
in the outer cycle, Knowledge Assessment and 
Knowledge Goals, which provide the direction to 
the whole knowledge management cycle:
•	
Knowledge Assessment completes the cycle, 
providing the essential data for strategic 
control of knowledge management.
•	
Knowledge Goals determine which capabili-
ties should be built on which level.K
Knowledge Processes in SMSEs 
(Layer 2 and 3)
The research method for the identification of 
knowledge processes in SMEs were expert 

192  
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
interviews or what Gillham (Gillham, 2000, p. 
64) referred to as “elite interviewing”. This kind 
of interviewing is chosen to address someone 
in a special position or an expert. Gillham lists 
several characteristics of open-ended interviews 
(Davenport & Prusak, 1998; Ruggels, 1997):
•	
The respondents will know more about the 
topic and the setting than the interviewer. 
Sometimes they can even tell the interviewer 
what questions to ask.
•	
By virtue of their authority and experience, 
they will have their own structuring of their 
knowledge. They will not allow an interview 
for which they have to answer a series of 
questions addressed at them.
•	
The best thing the interviewer can hope for 
is a response to a topic raised. 
•	
The experts can be particularly informative 
about the location of documents, records, or 
other experts.
•	
The experts will expect some control over 
the interviewer, and they also will demand 
a level of accountability and feedback. 
These five characteristics of elite interviews 
also apply to the interview situation for the 
knowledge processes in SMEs. The managers 
or company owners were highly motivated to 
articulate their view of knowledge processes and 
wanted to share their personal position about the 
key knowledge processes. The first interview 
session was conducted in 2004 and was limited 
to Austrian SME managers. This study was the 
proving ground for the future procedure of the 
empirical studies in 2005/2006/2007. The research 
hypothesis was:
Hypothesis: SMEs need a simple knowledge 
process model in order to implement knowledge 
management successfully.
The second interview session was conducted 
from December 2005 to February 2006 (Figure 1,  
layer 2). The research method was the elite inter-
view. The data sample ranged from all industry 
sectors in which SMEs could be found in Austria 
at this time with a special focus on enterprises 
in the of consulting and information technology 
sector. The survey subjects were CIOs (Chief 
information officer) and CEOs (Chief executive 
officer) in Austrian and Swiss SMEs as these  are 
recognized as proficient in answering questions 
concerning knowledge management (1980, p. 
21). The data sample of 36 interviewees was the 
proving ground for asking open ended questions. 
The data was analyzed by content analysis defined 
by Krippendorf (Davenport & Prusak, 1998) as 
“a research technique for making replicable and 
valid inferences to the content”. The interview 
sessions lasted approximately one hour and the 
authors were the interviewers. The result of the 
Austrian and Swiss research showed clearly that 
in both countries only four knowledge processes 
identified in the Probst, Raub & Romhardt (2006) 
model are ranked as important for the implemen-
tation of knowledge management in SMEs (see 
Figure 1, layer 3):
•	
Knowledge identification: In SMEs it is 
highly important to identify the key sources 
of knowledge, experiences and know-how 
in order to stay competitive on the market.
•	
Knowledge Acquisition: The know-how 
of SMEs resides in many cases in the head 
of the experts or knowledge worker. 
•	
Knowledge distribution: This process fo-
cuses on the sharing of explicit and implicit 
knowledge between knowledge workers 
in SMEs. As SMEs are characterized by 
smaller groups, a knowledge sharing culture 
which facilitates the exchange of knowledge 
with other groups and utilizes knowledge 
tools and mechanisms is especially impor-
tant. 
•	
Knowledge preservation: It is well rec-
ognized that the most critical asset of any 
company are the sum of its collective knowl-

  193
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
edge and intellectual property (Laudon & 
Laudon, 2006; Schwartz, 2006). Knowledge 
preservation and growth of this asset requires 
effective knowledge management through-
out SMEs, so as to make sure that the right 
information is available to the right people 
when they need it. In addition, the managers 
of the SMEs in our study pointed out that 
the process of knowledge disposal is also 
relevant for SMEs with the objective of not 
overloading the information flow between 
the individuals. From the content analysis 
of the expert interviews with Austrian and 
Swiss managers, knowledge disposal can be 
identified as an integrated part of knowledge 
preservation.
There were no significant differences in the 
answers given by the managers of SMEs in Aus-
tria and Switzerland. In general, it can be stated 
that SMEs are satisfied with only four knowledge 
processes instead of the original framework with 
eight building blocks. This implies that hypothesis 
1 is verified. These four key knowledge processes 
and the basic framework they provide for assign-
ing knowledge methods in SMEs will be part of 
our future research. 
K owledge Methods (Layer 4)
Based on a literature review (Fink & Ploder, 
2007b) a list of existing knowledge methods which 
support one of the four key knowledge processes 
was developed (Figure 1, layer 4). The objective 
of this empirical study was to find out which of 
the methods are most relevant for SMEs. The 
data sample of 587 enterprises was stochasti-
cally appointed from the target population. It 
was average allocated across the federal states 
of Austria, Switzerland to get a representative 
result. In Austria there are 535,031 SMEs and in 
Switzerland/Liechtenstein there are 308,819. The 
online questionnaire was carried out in summer 
2006 after a pre-test with 30 respondents. The 
respondents were divided into seven industry sec-
tors. 60 percent were from the three key industries: 
industry, information & consulting and trade & 
handcraft, with the remaining 40 percent dispersed 
over various other industries. Figure 3 lists the 
key methods for the four knowledge management 
processes, which are stored in the knowledge 
method repository (Figure 1, layer 5) and can be 
extended to new knowledge methods.K
Knowledge SoSftware-SuSpport 
(Layer 5)
In a next step, the objective was to match a cost-
efficient software product to each knowledge 
method which is usable in practice. In the research 
design the focus was on Freeware and Shareware 
software tools in order to fulfill the presetting 
of cost-efficient software support. An online re-
search method was used which resulted in a list 
of evaluated cost-efficient software products. The 
evaluation of each software product was conducted 
by applying the ISO/IEC 9126 norm. The Quality 
Model of the norm is divided into two parts which 
are important for the evaluation of the software 
products to support knowledge methods:
•	
the internal and the external quality of the 
software as well as
•	
the quality for use.
The ISO norm (see Figure 4) lists five charac-
teristics to evaluate software products: (1) func-
tionality, (2) reliability, (3) usability, (4) efficiency 
and (5) assignability. For each characteristic a 
different number of items were assessed by a 
likert scale from -2 up to +2. The process used 
by the authors to make the assessment is shown 
in the appendix. The data sample of the Quality 
Model included more than 200 different software 
products. A key research finding was that some of 
the software products cannot be used in practice 
because their quality is inadequate. Finally there 
were 45 software products which are suitable for 
use in SMEs.

Table 1 gives an overview of all methods sup-
porting the four knowledge processes for SMEs 
and the corresponding cost-efficient software 
tools. Table 1 also lists the absolute number of 
each method in the likert scale. The ranking of 
each method is the calculated value based on the 
likert scale. The “ISO Ranking” illustrates the 
assessment of the software based on the Quality 
Model. The absolute frequency with which the 
software was named by the respondents can be 
seen in the last column. 
Knowledge Balance (92) was ranked highest 
among the methods for the first process of the 
identification of knowledge. 56% of SMEs think 
that this is the best method. Further methods are the 
Balanced Scorecard (89) and the Skandia Naviga-
tor (74). The methods Market-Asset Value-Method 
(-5) and Tobin`s q (-15) were rated by less than 
30% to be of good use in SMEs.
Brainstorming (225) and Knowledge Network 
(203) are popular methods for the acquisition of 
knowledge. Mind Mapping (195), eMail Systems 
(134), Scenario Technique (126) and System 
Simulation (98) are also suitable methods for this 
knowledge process, while Business Games (91) 
are also a possibility. The method of “Synektik” 
was rated very low because of its complexity. The 
absolute star for the acquisition of knowledge 
was the Search Engine (232) with over 70% for 
efficient use in SMEs. In this case the Google 
Desktop Search Engine was the prior selection 
software. 60% of the respondents chose eMail-
Systems which can be supported by the software 
Thunderbird1.5. For Brainstorming a good tool is 
Concept X7, while for Mind Mapping the tools 
Free Mind (42%) and Think Graph (41%) were 
rated highly. As support software to a Business 
Game 64% rated Gamma was well 
As illustrated in Table 1 the methods eMail-
System (185), Handbook FAQs (159), Communi-
ties of Practice (152), Groupware (139), Ques-
tionnaire (110) and Best Practice (108) are the 
favorites for the distribution of knowledge. It has 
to be pointed out that the methods Micro Article 
(2) and Chatroom (29) are rated not as well in the 
survey. The software products for the methods 
of transferring knowledge are InfoRapid sup-
porting Knowledge Maps, EasySurvey support-
ing Questionnaire, Skype and MSN supporting 
Chatroom, eGroupware1.2 and AlphaAgent1.6.0 
supporting Groupware, CUCards 2000 support-
ing Checklists and Pegasus Mail, Thunderbird1.5 
and Amicron Mailoffice 2.0 for the support of 
eMail-Systems.
Databases (242) are a recognized method 
of the knowledge preservation process. 80% 
of the SMEs think that they will organize their 
knowledge with databases. Mind Mapping (200), 
Document Management System (195) and Check-
lists (164) are further efficient methods. Content 
Management Systems (126), Project Review (122), 
Expert Systems (74) and Conceptualization (40) 
are methods which can be chosen but are not the 
favorite choice. Neural Network (-10) is not an 
adequate method for preserving knowledge in 
an SME. There were many different software 
products to support this process. MySQL is 
the favorite database software followed by the 
MSDE from Microsoft. Document management 
can be done by the Office Manager, the UDEX 
dotNETContact or the QVTutto. There are also 
software tools for the other methods which are 
described in Table 1.

OBJECTIVESeve
In the future the research area will be expanded 
from Austria, Germany and Switzerland to other 
key members of the European Union as well as 
to the U.S. and Asia-Pacific area. Furthermore, 
in future research work the authors will focus 
on knowledge diffusion to the dissemination of 
explicit knowledge captioned in SMEs from many 
sources. The diffusion of knowledge through an 
effective SME website creates benefits not only 
to the enterprise itself but also to customers and

Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
suppliers as well as to new alliances. Empirical 
studies conducted by Ordanini  show that the 
website is the only solution which has been used 
by the majority of SMEs, while the adoption of a 
highly-sophisticated website is a relevant matter 
for only 10 percent or 20 percent of SMEs. The 
use of information technology, especially web-
sites, is recognized as a critical success factor for 
knowledge management initiatives in the SME 
sector (Wong & Aspinwall, 2005). Wong (2005) 
sees information technologies as a key enabler 
for the implementation of knowledge manage-
ment and considers factors such as the simplicity 
of technology, ease of use, suitability for users’ 
needs, relevancy of knowledge content, and stan-
dardization of a knowledge structure as key factors 
for knowledge diffusion in the development of 
a knowledge management systems. Knowledge 
diffusion through websites is a dominant factor 
for successful knowledge initiatives. The central 
research question of this section can be described 
as follows: How can SMEs spread their knowledge 
competencies through their websites? For success-
ful knowledge diffusion (Fink & Ploder, 2007a) 
in SMEs the authors propose a three-dimensional 
theoretical framework as shown in figure 5: (1) 
Data/Information/Knowledge Dimension, (2) 
Technical-oriented Dimension and (3) Social-
cognitive Dimension.
The major learning objectives of this chapter 
are:
•	
Identification and description of contempo-
rary approaches to knowledge management 
in SMEs.
•	
Assessing contemporary knowledge pro-
cesses that are required for successful 
implementation of knowledge management 
in SMEs.
•	
Identification of major knowledge methods 
supporting the key knowledge processes in 
SMEs: identification, acquisition, dissemi-
nation, preservation referring to the layer 
concept
•	
Discussion of the impact of cost-efficient 
software support for knowledge initia-
tives.
•	
Analyzing the relationship of knowledge 
transfer through SME websites. 
In summary, it can be stated that the use of 
an integration concept can help SMEs leverage 
their core competencies by promoting the sharing 
of information and knowledge inside and outside 
their organization. The impact of cost-efficient 
software products for knowledge management 
facilitates business models based on simple 
knowledge processes. The knowledge process 
model highlights specific processes in the business 
where competitive advantages can be achieved 
and knowledge management systems will have 
a greater impact. The integration concepts view 
knowledge management in SMEs as a holistic 
approach where primary knowledge processes 
are directly related to knowledge methods and 
software tools.

Key TERMSTem
Enterprise: Considered to be any entity 
engaged in an economic activity, irrespective 
of its legal form. This includes, in particular, 
self-employed persons and family businesses 
engaged in craft or other activities, along with 
partnerships or associations regularly engaged 
in economic activities. The category of micro, 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) is 
made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 
250 persons and which have an annual turnover 

200  
Integration Concept for Knowledge Processes, Methods, and Software for SMEs
not exceeding EURO 50 million, and/or an an-
nual balance sheet total not exceeding EURO 43 
million. Within the SME category, a small enter-
prise is defined as an enterprise which employs 
fewer than 50 persons and whose annual turnover 
and/or annual balance sheet total does not exceed 
EURO 10 million. Within the SME category, a 
micro enterprise is defined as an enterprise which 
employs fewer than 10 persons and whose annual 
turnover and/or annual balance sheet total does 
not exceed EURO 2 million.
Knowledge Distribution: Can be defined 
as the transfer of knowledge within and across 
settings, with the expectation that the knowledge 
will be “used” conceptually (as learning, enlight-
enment, or the acquisition of new perspectives 
or attitudes) or instrumentally (in the form of 
modified or new practices.).  There are those 
who see distribution as having other legitimate 
outcomes.  Some of these outcomes include:  (1) 
increased awareness; (2) ability to make informed 
choices among alternatives and (3) the exchange 
of information, materials or perspectives.
Knowledge Integration Concepts: Aim to 
customize knowledge processes and knowledge 
methods for SMEs in a single enterprise solu-
tion platform. Enterprise application such as 
knowledge management systems are designed 
to support the SME orientation of business and 
knowledge processes to that the SMEs can oper-
ate efficiently. 
Knowledge Management: Can be seen as the 
overall dealing with knowledge. Knowledge is a 
fluid mix of framed experience, values, contex-
tual information, and expert insight that provides 
a framework for evaluating and incorporating 
new experiences and information. It originates 
and is applied in the minds of those who know. 
In organizations, it often becomes embedded 
not only in documents or repositories but also in 
organizational routines, processes, practices and 
norms (Davenport & Prusak, 1998).
Knowledge Management Systems: A fast 
growing area of corporate software investment. 
Contemporary technologies such as Portals, 
Content Management Systems, Search engines, 
ontologies help managers and employees in their 
daily decisions and processes. At each level of the 
organization, knowledge management systems 
support the major knowledge processes of the 
business.
Knowledge Methods: Support knowledge 
processes and are designed to add value to these 
within organizations. Depending on the identifi-
cation of industry specific knowledge processes, 
SMEs have to choose from a knowledge method re-
pository the corresponding knowledge method. 
Knowledge Processes: Accelerate the 
company’s business processes while ensuring 
compliance with the knowledge of the employ-
ees. Knowledge processes concentrate on the 
identification, acquisition, dissemination and 
preservation of knowledge in order to gain com-
petitive advantages and enhance the value of the 
company. Organizations have to use the ability to 
incorporate their knowledge into their business 
processes.

Although the research on integrated enterprise systems (ES) is proliferating, the knowledge base about 
ES implementations, usage and experiences outside the United States is still small. This is also true for 
Germany, despite the crucial importance of ES in the country, and the potential uniqueness of its ES 
environment. Most ES research to date has also been focusing on larger corporations, neglecting the 
challenges and issues that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) have been experiencing. Col-
lectively often referred to as the Mittelstand, German SMEs form the backbone of the German economy. 
This chapter brings attention to these areas by describing observations obtained from eight SMEs in 
the German manufacturing sector. These findings about ES implementation, usage, and experiences are 
reported and summarized along nine points of interest. 

202  
Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing MittelstandI
IntroductionTRCTI
Enterprise systems (ES) promise seamless integra-
tion of processes and information flows throughout 
an organization, streamlining operations and 
increasing their efficiency. These systems, often 
also referred to as Enterprise Resource Planning 
(ERP) systems, enable companies to compete in 
the global marketplace and expand their reach. 
Having evolved via materials requirements plan-
ning (MRP) and manufacturing resource planning 
(MRP II) systems, they are nowadays often an 
integral part of and a competitive necessity for 
companies worldwide.
Most ES research to date has focused on large 
organizations operating in North America, ne-
glecting company experiences with ES in other 
parts of the world. Some exceptions exist, for 
example studies conducted in Ireland (Adam 
and O’Doherty, 2000), Singapore (Soh, Kien 
and Tay-Yap, 2000), China (Davison, 2002), 
and some European countries (van Everdingen, 
van Hillegersberg and Waarts, 2000). It is our 
objective with this chapter to expand the body of 
knowledge about ES implementation, usage and 
experiences in Europe, specifically in Germany. 
Crucial components preceding the implementa-
tion and usage phases are the decision and plan-
ning phases, for which we also provide insight. 
We focus on small and medium sized enterprises 
(SMEs) who have been following their larger coun-
terparts in ES implementation and usage. Their 
often constrained environment (cf. Quiescenti et 
al., 2006) makes them a particularly interesting 
subject of investigation. SMEs are usually slower 
in adopting new concepts, and while an ES may 
be present, they often still operate in functional 
silos (Billet, 2008). However, the ES market for 
SMEs is booming (Bell and Orzen, 2007), which 
is also illustrated by more targeted and tailored 
offerings from ES providers, such as SAP’s Busi-
ness One solution.
This chapter reports additional findings from a 
larger study carried out by the international author 
team. Related results were already reported in 
Schoenherr, Venkataramanan, Soni, Mabert and 
Hilpert (2005), whose focus was a comparison 
of experiences by German and U.S. companies. 
The present chapter provides some very interest-
ing insights of issues not already reported. More 
specifically, we explore the impetus for the system, 
the power of the final decision, the system and 
system provider selection, the time spent in system 
selection, planning and implementation, the order 
of implementation, the issue of standard packages, 
modifications and in-house developed applica-
tions, the involvement of employees and training, 
the implementation success and satisfaction, and 
the topic of upgrades after implementation. The 
remainder of this chapter is structured into four 
sections. The next section provides an overview 
of related literature, followed by a section describ-
ing our methodology and sample characteristics. 
The subsequent section reports the results, with 
the final section providing a brief summary and 
conclusion.
LITRTRRI
Experiences with integrated ES (ERP systems) 
were first published in practitioner journals (Me-
cham, 1998) and the popular press (Kirkpatrick, 
1998; Diederich, 1998). Shortly afterwards first 
academic research reports appeared (Davenport, 
1998), fuelling interest and excitement among 
academics. Up to date a multitude of articles have 
appeared dealing with both the positive (Bradford, 
Mayfield, and Toney, 2001) and negative (Sumner, 
2000) effects of ES implementations, as well as 
their associated considerable cost (Mabert, Soni, 
and Venkataramanan, 2000). Mabert (2007) and 
Jacobs and Weston (2007) provide a comprehen-
sive chronology of the historical development and 
evolution of these systems. 
	Most of the early research in ES dealt with the 
experiences made by large corporations, which 
also represented the early adopters of this new inte-

  203

grated technology. Small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) however followed quickly. Soon it was 
also realized that SMEs differ significantly from 
their larger counterparts, for example in terms of 
motivation factors, types of systems implemented, 
implementation strategies, implementation costs, 
and the degree of customization (Mabert, Soni 
and Venkataramanan, 2003). Differences between 
SMEs and large firms in regards to their ES 
adoption were also described by Buonanno et al. 
(2005). Other studies chronicled how SMEs are 
coping with their ES (Olson and Sætre, 2007) and 
how they managed uncertainty in ERP-controlled 
manufacturing environments (Koh and Saad, 
2006). Additional manuscripts investigated the 
impact of an ES on their productivity (Shin, 2006) 
and cautioned that disadvantages associated with 
an implementation can be exaggerated for SMEs 
(Brehm and Gómez, 2005). It was also reported 
that SMEs take a more cautious approach toward 
extended ES (de Búrca, Fynes and Marshall, 
2005), but that they can become a competitive 
weapon (Koh and Simpson, 2005, 2007). These 
studies illustrate that there are key differences 
between large and small companies, and that ES 
issues are approached differently. Since research 
on large corporations and their experiences with 
ES is proliferating, we decided to focus on small 
and medium sized enterprises.
While most ES research has concentrated on the 
North American environment, some studies exist 
that examine these issues in an international or 
country-specific context. For example, Soh, Kien 
and Tay-Yap (2000) report the ES implementation 
experiences made by seven Singaporean hospitals. 
The researchers stress to recognize the unique 
Asian context when implementing an ES, which 
is generally based on Western practices. Davison 
(2002) lists further examples how Western ES can 
lead to complications in Asian cultures. Akker-
mans et al. (2003) present results from a Delphi 
study involving Dutch supply chain executives, 
investigating the future impact of ES on supply 
chain management. Wang et al. (2005) provided 
an overview of ERP research in China.
A few of these international studies also 
focused on SMEs. For instance, Adam and 
O’Doherty (2000) report results from 14 ERP 
implementation projects in Irish organizations, 
concentrating on the relationships between the 
firms and their implementation partners. Van 
Everdingen, Van Hillegersberg and Waarts (2000) 
observe the increasing interest of European SMEs 
in ES, as well as the associated implications for 
vendors targeting this market segment. Morabito, 
Pace and Previtali (2005) focus on the marketing 
of ERP systems to Italian SMEs. More recently, 
Chien et al. (2007) report implementation ex-
periences made by SMEs in China and Taiwan, 
highlighting factors for project success. 
The present book chapter focuses on the experi-
ences of German SMEs with the implementation 
and use of integrated ES. Collectively often re-
ferred to as the Mittelstand, German SMEs form 
the backbone of the German economy. Over one 
million firms employ more than 20 million indi-
viduals, are responsible for almost 40 percent of 
total German gross investments, and account for 
30 percent of the exports (Hauser, 2000). These 
businesses are often characterized by their innova-
tive and entrepreneurial nature, their competitive 
position in the international marketplace, and 
their focus on highly customized and engineered 
products. Against this background ES become 
an inevitable competitive weapon (Taylor, 1999; 
Voigt, 2001). Germany’s exceptional vocational 
training system provides these firms with an edu-
cated and skilled workforce, which is usually very 
loyal and stable. Overall, this setting of German 
SMEs provides a unique opportunity to study 
their experiences with integrated ES.
METHTODOLOGY AND SAMPLES
A series of eight case studies was conducted to 
obtain insight into ES implementation and usage 
among German Mittelstand companies. Case 
study methodology was deemed to be the most 
promising approach since insight into this par-

204  
Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing Mittelstand
ticular topic and setting is limited. The case study 
approach is an excellent tool to acquire detailed 
information (Yin, 1994), is becoming increas-
ingly popular (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007), 
and has a long tradition of being employed in the 
information systems literature (Orlikowski, 1992; 
Robey and Sahay, 1996). The primary objective 
for conducting the case studies was to obtain 
reliable and detailed information on ES practice 
among German SMEs. 
Companies were chosen so that a broad insight 
in the German manufacturing industry could be 
obtained. Special care was taken to select true 
German Mittelstand companies that are, despite 
their size, global market leaders. All companies 
started out as small family businesses, and most 
of them are still family owned in their fifth or 
sixth generation. The firms may have subsidiaries 
overseas; however, they may not be a subsidiary 
of a foreign company. Four companies were 
located in the Main-Tauber region, whereas four 
were in the Reutlingen area, both in the south of 
Germany. These companies were chosen to give 
us a nice overview of the state of ES implementa-
tions in the German manufacturing industry. It 
was also hoped to detect some regional peculiari-
ties, given the southern countrified mentality in 
these regions.
Interviews were exploratory in nature and were 
conducted with key business managers and IT 
professionals in 2002, with a follow-up in 2004. 
The interviews lasted between two and four hours 
and involved as many as four employees. Four 
interviewers of the research team were present at 
all times, leading the interview in a semi-struc-
tured fashion asking open-ended questions. The 
interview team consisted of two U.S.-American 
professors, a German professor and a German 
graduate student working towards his doctor-
ate in the U.S. The interviews were conducted 
either in English or German, depending on the 
preference of the interviewees. All conversations 
were tape-recorded and meticulously transcribed 
in English. 
Our chosen companies were judged to be 
an appropriate sample for our study. While the 
firms were all in the manufacturing industry, 
their products ranged from textiles to elevators, 
including medical technology, furniture, complete 
workstations and home appliances (Table 1). Their 
size was between 593 and 1,200 employees and 
annual turnover varied between 64 and 378 mil-
lion Euros. While these firms do not fall into the 
defined categories by for example the European 
Union, which classifies SMEs as firms having 250 
or fewer employees (European Commission, 2008) 
or the German Institute for SME Research, which 
classifies SMEs as firms having fewer than 500 
employees (Institute für Mittelstandsforschung, 
2008), they fall in the SME category as it was 
defined by prior academic research (e.g., Mabert 
et al., 2003; Muscatello et al., 2003). However, an 
even more important selection criterion was that 
the firms represented true characteristics of the 
Mittelstand in Germany, as described above, with 
size only being a secondary consideration.
Firms in our sample were at all stages in regard 
to their ES implementations, thus giving us a 
representative account of experiences at different 
points in time. We distinguish between the deci-
sion phase, the planning phase, the implementation 
phase and the usage phase. The location of each 
firm on this timeline, along with timeline designs 
of other researchers, is graphed in Figure 1. Table 
2 provides an overview of the firms’ past, current 
and future ES, as well as the current stage on the 
ES implementation and usage timeline. R

This section reports the experiences of our sample 
with ES implementation and usage, and can 
provide useful insight for firms in similar situ-
ations and contexts, contemplating the adoption 
of an ES.

Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing Mittelstand
Impetus for a New SystemS
One point of interest for us was to investigate 
what impetus led the company to consider a new 
system, or which functions in a firm were driving 
forces. Literature suggests that the desire to go 
to a new system is often initiated by finance, ac-
counting and controlling (Adam and O’Doherty, 
2000; Mabert, Soni and Venkataramanan, 2002a). 
We were able to confirm this in our case studies, 
both for companies that had already made the 
implementation decision, and for firms that were 
still in the contemplation phase. For example, 
the financial department in Company C required 
more detailed and sophisticated reporting tools, 
which the legacy system could not provide. In 
other companies, such as Company D, the present 
system in finance could not be linked with other

systems, thus making true integration impossible. 
Finance was again the driving force.
Additional catalysts for a new system included 
an increasing data volume due to for example 
an abundance of product variations in Company 
G, and the wish for greater integration with its 
foreign subsidiaries. Sometimes, as in the case 
of Company C, customers were also demanding 
more integrated capabilities, requiring a new 
system; often data for reports and invoices were 
still collected manually. A common thread in our 
case study companies was that more statistical 
reporting capabilities from an integrated system 
were desired (this was particularly the case in 
Company G). Other frequently mentioned goals 
included the desire to make processes and opera-
tions more efficient, reduce costs and improve 
planning.
In all cases the decision was made to implement 
a new system rather than to upgrade the old one, 
which would have been much more expensive and 
time-consuming. This option was chosen even in 
instances where the old system, which was partly 
developed in-house and tailored very carefully to 
the firm’s internal processes, would have been 
working fine for the next couple of years. In that 
particular case the firm, Company D, had the ad-
vantage to not be under time pressure, since their 
legacy system was still functioning. This way the 
firm could carefully plan the implementation and 
proceed without rushing. 
Power of Final Decision 
In most instances the decision to explore the 
possibility for a new ES, as well as the ultimate 
final decision on the software structure was made 
by top management. Since several of our firms 
were family businesses, top management often 
involved the owner(s) of the firm (e.g., in Com-
panies H and F), in conjunction with the head of 
the IT department. As much as owners can be a 
catalyst for ideas, they can also have the role of 
an inhibitor, being conservative and reluctant to 
change something “old, valuable and still well 
functioning.” Interesting scenarios evolve when 
the owner is against a new system implementa-
tion, whereas the son is in favor of it, which was 
the case in one of our companies.
Although the decision is made in an autocratic 
way in many family businesses, quite frequently 
the department heads were consulted and involved

into the decision process (e.g., in Company C). In 
a few cases input was also solicited from lower 
levels of authority. This recognizes the need 
that everyone in the company must support the 
decision, especially since in a lean environment 
the execution of such a project would mean more 
work for everyone. In one instance, the entire 
implementation team was heavily involved in the 
selection. On another occasion, where the firm 
was part of a large holding company, the decision 
to move from one ES package to another was 
indoctrinated by headquarters (Company E). The 
firm had to follow the order, although they knew 
that they would not see any improvements with 
the new system. In yet a different case, Company 
A, the decision was made entirely by the head of 
IT, whose vision determined the entire company 
IT infrastructure.S
System and Provider Selection S
Once the decision has been made that a new system 
is needed, the question arises what system is best 
for the company. For some firms this choice was 
not given since they were so early with their imple-
mentation decision; they had to take whatever 
the market was offering at that time. Most often, 
these solutions were rather generic and could not 
satisfy the specific industry context and require-
ments of many firms. However, as the ES market 
was developing, more sophisticated, tailored and 
customized providers and offerings emerged, and 
firms were given a considerable choice. It now 
becomes a challenge to choose the best provider, 
and compromises between functions may have to 
be made to avoid internal conflicts. In the following 
we report insight into who influenced the decision 
in our case companies, followed by criteria used 
to choose a provider and system.
Although accounting and finance are often 
the impetus behind the wish for an integrated 
ES, their processes follow standards across most 
organizations. Thus, these areas will be satisfied 
with most integrated software packages, whereas 
production and material management might not. 
Our case companies provided good illustration 
that material-flow processes can differ quite 
significantly, and are frequently associated with 
unique process capabilities leading to competitive 
advantage. For example, Company B’s production, 
which is essentially a job shop, is very complex; 
customers may fully customize and modify their 
product from the base model, increasing the 
possible product variations exponentially. The 
desire to keep the proven production structure 
and processes is therefore often the winning 
argument for or against a particular ES. This 
was also true for Company C, which had some 
very unique and patented manufacturing process 
steps. Nevertheless, depending on the significance 
individual departments have in the company, 
finance can be the deciding force as well, as was 
the case in Companies D and E. Since they are a 
strong advocate for a new system they may also 
possess enough clout to determine what new 
system should be implemented. 
When considering ES providers, their history 
and traditional strengths were assessed. As such, 
SAP has traditionally been very strong on the 
financial side, whereas Baan, coming from the 
manufacturing industry, has more strengths in 
production planning, logistics and material man-
agement. Besides, at the time of our research, Baan 
was known to be able to cater more to medium 
sized companies whereas SAP primarily satisfied 
the requirements of big enterprises. Depending 
now on which department has more influence 
in the decision process or which capabilities are 
regarded as being more important, the respective 
system is chosen.
Important aspects considered were also the 
price of the ES, data warehousing capabilities, 
and the functionality of the system. For example, 
SAP was chosen by Company F because of its 
ability to deal with their many product variations 
effectively, whereas Baan was chosen by Company 
H because it supported more reporting abilities 
on all levels. Further criteria considered in the 

208  
Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing Mittelstand
decision were the reputation of the provider and 
its likelihood to survive the next years (Company 
F), industry fit (Company C), outside studies 
assessing the proficiency of certain ES along 
several dimensions (Company H), as well as the 
sales pitch of ES representatives at our case study 
companies (Company H). It turned out that there 
were significant differences in knowledge and 
proficiency of representatives. T
Time SpSent in System Selection, SS
Planning and ImplementationI
Our sample companies recognized the importance 
of carefully selecting a system, which could decide 
on the success or failure of an implementation. 
Therefore most companies allowed themselves 
ample time for the selection of an ES provider. 
For example, Company D considered exhaustive 
documentation processes examining system fit, 
and consulted research reports and rankings of 
system providers. Extensive workshops with po-
tential providers were conducted by Company F, 
which then had to demonstrate how their system 
could represent the companies’ processes. 
The planning process can also be quite lengthy 
and deliberate. For our companies the plan-
ning process began up to three years before the 
scheduled implementation, and the core planning 
group involved as many as five percent of the total 
workforce, which was the case for Company H. 
Business models and elaborate requirement cata-
logues were developed in these planning teams. 
Company G hired a consulting group to examine 
the entire present IT infrastructure and identify 
improvement potential, which then lead the way 
to selecting the optimal system. Time spent plan-
ning and outlining the future IT infrastructure 
pays off. In one of our sample firms, Company 
A, an IT master-plan was developed in 1999 with 
very meticulous planning and did not have to be 
changed since. 
Similar to selection and planning, the imple-
mentation period can also be quite long, lasting 
up to two-and-a-half years among our sample 
firms, as was the case for Company D. Reasons 
for such lengthy implementation periods may 
include the complexity of the business and the 
need to undertake certain modifications. Also, 
firms wanted to make sure that an implemented 
module functioned perfectly before they started 
the introduction of the next module. In the case 
of a big bang or an implementation involving 
several modules introduced at once, firms were 
more comfortable going live with these systems 
in a time when the whole company was down, 
which was usually only the case over the Christ-
mas holidays (Company D), and in some instances 
during vacation close-downs in the summer. This 
constraint sometimes forced a further extension 
of the implementation period. 
A significant amount of time is spent in 
selecting, planning and implementing the ES. 
Companies were in no rush since most of the 
time since the old system was still working fine, 
as was the case for Companies C and D. Firms 
also recognized the deliberate process as a 
chance to build a sound and solid basis for their 
IT infrastructure, upon which other applications 
could be built and future systems could rely on. 
This very careful and meticulous procedure is in 
line with Hofstede’s (1991) findings. He classi-
fied Germany as being very high on his scale of 
uncertainty avoidance, as compared for example 
to the U.S. High uncertainty avoidance is likely 
to result in high risk avoidance, for which all of 
our observations stand for. Risk is mitigated by 
careful and deliberate system selection, planning 
and implementation. 
Order of Implementation I
ES are often multi-module systems, which can be 
implemented either module-by-module (phased in 
approach) or all at once (big bang approach). Three 
companies in our sample (B, F and H) considered 
or had already conducted a big bang to go live, 
which is generally regarded to be more risky. All 

  209
Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing Mittelstand
other firms opted for the phased-in approach due to 
complex and unique internal processes that had to 
be accommodated. It was thus easier and safer to 
go step-by-step, leaving time for potential delays 
or complications. Further substantiations for this 
strategy included high degree of customization 
in terms of products produced (Company G), and 
the presence of sophisticated in-house developed 
programs, which could not easily be replaced by 
standard package software (Company A). There-
fore, areas that were easier to be mapped by the 
package application were introduced first, while 
other more demanding functions were added as 
need arose, or as new releases became available 
that were able to accommodate the firm’s spe-
cific processes. However, Company H wanted 
to modify their processes to accommodate the 
standard ES, instead of waiting until better and 
more suitable solutions were available. This firm 
relied on future benefits accrued by the ES.
As reported above, finance frequently initi-
ated the move to a new system, which led to the 
financial modules also often being among the first 
to be implemented. This approach ensured that 
all organizational components were mapped out 
correctly in the system, upon which other modules 
could then rely on. Having a common integrated 
financial system is frequently also mandated by 
a mother firm, as was the case for our Company 
E. Functional areas that followed with the imple-
mentation of their respective modules included 
production, materials management and logistics. 
A third wave of implemented modules consisted 
of quality management and human resources, if 
they were implemented at all. Nevertheless, not 
all companies follow this scheme. One firm in our 
sample, Company H, implemented the logistic 
modules first due to this function’s superior po-
sition in the company. This particular firm also 
selected Baan over SAP, since the former has 
traditionally been strong in the logistics area.
Standard Packages, Modifications, 
and In-house Developed I
Applications
When looking at the final system architecture in 
some of our firms it was interesting to see that 
many still kept some of their legacy systems 
in addition to the new ES package. This can 
be problematic, and it has been suggested that 
firms keep not more than 20 percent of their 
previous applications (Rowe, 1999). Considering 
the spectrum of enterprise systems illustrated in 
Figure 2, most of our firms fall in between the 
two extremes, i.e. the majority of the companies 
had either a standard ES with some modifications, 
or they had in-house developed programs linked 
with a standard ES.
Some firms in our sample, for example 
Company A, opted to integrate various legacy 
applications rather than implementing a new ES 
package. This option enabled the firms to accom-
modate unique processes and requirements, which 
would not have been possible with a standard ES. 
In-house developed applications are sometimes 
highly sophisticated and technically advanced, 
representing a superior value to the business. Hav-

ing such a system can be an important competitive 
advantage. For one of our firms, Company G, the 
ES packages available at that time were also too 
broad in scope and would be much more than 
what was actually needed by the firm.
In-house developed systems are frequently 
complemented by standard software components. 
This was especially done when the technical 
status of the applications was low, when there 
were standard processes in place that were easily 
representable in a standard ES, or when the advan-
tages of in-house developed applications do not 
outweigh the advantages of the standard software 
package. The standard software components then 
linked via interfaces to in-house developed appli-
cations. Company G developed a comprehensive 
matrix along some of these dimensions for their 
systems to facilitate the decision. Company A had 
a particularly elaborate IT infrastructure, whose 
backbone was a central data-warehouse on which 
both the standard ERP package and internally-
developed legacy systems replied.
	Oftentimes, in order to accommodate unique 
company processes or due to a reluctance to 
change, standard systems are modified to fit the 
operations (instead of changing the processes to 
fit the system). This can be an expensive under-
taking; one of our firms, Company D, expended 
as much as 25 man-days from outside consultants 
to implement these changes. However, the ability 
of a firm to represent their internal processes in 
the system can be a crucial necessity to remain 
competitive, which was stressed by Company 
B. Modifications make also future upgrades and 
maintenance more challenging. One of our case 
studies, Company A, accommodated this concern 
by a unique approach. The firm did not modify 
anything in the standard ES package modules, 
except some minor customization work. Whenever 
a modification of the standard seemed necessary, 
the firm opted to represent this process with an 
in-house application, synchronized with the stan-
dard ES via clean interfaces. Upgrades and new 
releases of the standard components were now 
executable very easily with a minimum amount 
of work. 
As expected, financial processes in our case 
studies were usually accommodated very easily 
via standard software components, due to the 
similarity of these processes mandated by regu-
latory and governmental reporting requirements 
(e.g., Companies C and G). For logistic and supply 
chain activities, such as sales and order entry, an 
in-house developed application was often better 
able to represent the sometimes very unique and 
specific processes, as was the case for Company 
A. If a standard package was employed, modifica-
tions needed to be undertaken or add-ons to be 
purchased, which was reported by Company H.
It is clear that one size does not fit all. A firm 
must assess its unique situation and decide whether 
the advantages of a standard package outweigh 
the advantages of in-house developed software, 
or vice versa. Considerations can include, but are 
not limited to, the following issues:
•	
unique requirements on system capabili-
ties, caused by multifarious product char-
acteristics, elaborate processes, or other 
company-specific complexities, which are 
not representable by a standard software 
package;
•	
in-house developed system as a source of a 
competitive advantage;
•	
tradeoff between luxury of having modifi-
cations to fit processes now and resulting 
difficulties later on in upgrades;
•	
tradeoff between changing the system and 
changing the firm’s processes and opera-
tions; 
•	
risk aversion and uncertainty avoidance of 
a company.
Involvement of Employees and T
Training
 
The involvement of everyone in an organization 
has been stressed as a key for ES implementations 

  211
Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing Mittelstand
(e.g., Mabert, Soni and Venkataramanan, 2001a). 
We saw this involvement in all companies we 
visited. The implementation team members were 
usually released from their normal duties, so they 
could focus solely on the implementation project. 
Often the actual implementation was conducted by 
a combination of in-house personnel and outside 
consultants, which was the case for Company 
H. In very few instances top management was 
directly involved, but always gave direction and 
monitored the progress of the project. Input was 
also sought from every department, most often 
from the department heads, as was illustrated by 
Company C.
In terms of training companies took different 
approaches. Some firms, for example Company 
B, went with a service partner, who sometimes 
also had project management responsibilities. 
Associated costs varied widely. Company D in-
vested 1,000 man-days of education upfront; for 
their 340 users they needed 20 to 30 teachers at 
times, so it became very expensive. For Company 
H it was relatively inexpensive since they relied 
on internal training and education. In addition to 
a little training in-house by consultants from the 
system provider, the implementation team merely 
took a two-day preparation course. Everything 
else was accomplished in self-training, which 
team members regarded as more beneficial than 
a course. 
Implementation SuSccess and 
S tisfaction
The success of an ES implementation can ob-
jectively be measured by parameters such as 
under/on/over budget and whether the project was 
completed on time, before or after the scheduled 
date (Mabert, Soni and Venkataramanan, 2001b). 
Although some companies could confirm that they 
exceeded their budget and time deadlines, most 
companies were not able to give us any objective 
measures by which they gauged their success. 
The difficulty of this assessment was associated 
with the lack of benchmarks to which they could 
compare the performance of the company before 
and after implementation. Furthermore, one of our 
firms, Company H, grew so fast in other areas, so 
that an identification of monetary or operational 
benefits attributable to ES implementation alone 
was not possible.
Nevertheless, judging from the subjective 
comments almost all ES implementations were a 
big success, reaping improvements in controlling, 
logistics and distribution due to the presence of an 
integrated and consolidated system. For example, 
Company H realized 99 percent on-time delivery 
with the new ES. An interviewee at the same 
company mentioned that it was clear to manage-
ment that the company could not have gone any 
other way; the old system would have come to an 
end, sooner or later. At another firm, Company 
B, transparency achieved throughout the whole 
workflow and less tedious central planning and 
controlling was appreciated; among other things 
it resulted in reduced safety stock and more ef-
ficient purchasing capabilities.
The voices of management are sometimes not 
as unanimous as the examples just described. 
Often there were internal conflicts among man-
agement. In most instances we dealt with family 
businesses, where the father and son or the son-in-
law were part of top management. It then usually 
was the case that the younger management was 
more open to change and to the introduction of 
an integrated system, however hitting on resis-
tance from senior management. Generally this 
opposition was overcome, however with leaving 
negative sentiments behind. Companies A and B 
made such experiences. 
Problems that caused an over budget or be-
yond deadline implementation were seen in a 
constructive manner, and as an opportunity to 
learn. Company B attributed a delay in time to 
internal personal problems and disagreements, 
whereas Company H experienced an over-budget 
implementation because particular add-ons were 
not considered in the original calculation and the 

212  
Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing Mittelstand
consulting company they used for the project went 
out of business. Nevertheless, although we did not 
have objective figures in most instances gauging 
the implementation success, the experiences were 
positive across the board. None of our case study 
companies regretted the implementation, even 
when problems occurred; all saw the benefits 
associated with a new integrated system.
The often meticulous and detailed preparation 
for implementation phase frequently had nice 
side-benefits for our companies. For example, 
firms usually mapped and analyzed all internal 
processes before an ES implementation very care-
fully, thus gaining a thorough understanding of 
the intricate nature of their business procedures, 
enabling them to make considerable improve-
ments. Often process maps and work plans were 
nonexistent and had to be created as a basis for 
a solid system. Moreover, data were frequently 
missing or were available in an incompatible 
format. Several man-years of past data thus had 
to be collected and entered to provide a sound 
foundation for the decision making tools of the 
enterprise system, as was the case in Company A. 
All these efforts not only created a solid ground-
work for the system and its applications to rely 
on, it also eliminated existing process and product 
inefficiencies, many of which resulted from the 
multitude of non-integrated stand-alone island 
solutions. In one instance a firm was able to reduce 
its present 285,000 part and material masters to a 
mere 12,000 (Company A). This illustrates that ES 
implementations entail both product and process 
benefits (Bendoly and Schoenherr, 2005).
Upgrades After ImplementationI
 
The issue of upgrades is an interesting topic, since 
often considerable work and effort is involved, not 
to mention potential complications when certain 
parts of the system were modified earlier to fit 
company-specific processes. Depending on the 
extent of changes and modifications undertaken 
and the complexities and processes of the system, 
time needed for upgrades ranged from one to sev-
eral months among our case studies. This makes 
it impossible to implement every new release. 
Company H spent even more time for a major 
upgrade than it spent on the implementation of the 
original system, partly also because of the absence 
of time pressure. This was the case even though 
the employees from the original implementation 
team were now responsible for the upgrade. 
In general, our case study companies do not 
upgrade their system regularly. Most firms were 
happy with their systems and did not want to 
undergo another potentially hazardous imple-
mentation experience with an upgrade or new 
release. Companies have become more careful, 
also because of market developments, where the 
lesson was learned that following the latest hype 
is not always the best. Even one of the most proac-
tive firms in our sample, Company D, which uses 
upgrades frequently to enhance the system, does 
not go with every upgrade or new addition. The 
particular company was one of the first to intro-
duce CRM capabilities to their integrated system. 
Since the firm made unfavorable experiences with 
it, they were waiting with the implementation of 
APO until it was further developed.S
SUMMARY ARND COCNCLUSIONCSI
Although the research on integrated enterprise 
systems is proliferating, the knowledge base for 
ES implementations and usage outside the U.S. is 
still small. This is also true for Germany, despite 
the crucial importance of ES in the country, and 
the potential uniqueness of its ES environment. 
Most ES research to date has also been focusing 
on larger corporations, neglecting the challenges 
and issues that small and medium sized enterprises 
have been experiencing. This chapter brought light 
into both of these areas by describing observa-
tions obtained from eight Mittelstand companies 
in the German manufacturing sector. Findings 
were reported along the following dimensions:

impetus for the system; power of the final deci-
sion; system and system provider selection; time 
spent in system selection, planning and imple-
mentation; order of implementation; standard 
packages, modifications and in-house developed 
applications; involvement of employees and train-
ing; implementation success and satisfaction; and 
upgrades after implementation. Overall results 
are summarized in Exhibit 1.

It depends on the company and the structure of its internal, and to a lesser extent, external processes, 
whether a firm prefers a systems environment made up of completely in-house developed components, 
a standard software with a few modifications undertaken, a complete acceptance of a standard package 
with only minor customization, or a mixture of these; we suggested some considerations influencing 
this decision
•	
A one-size-fits-all ES does not fit the enterprise in most instances; almost all firms keep other in-house 
developed systems for specialized functionalities or unique processes

Often the actual implementation was conducted by a combination of in-house personnel, spanning 
various departments, and consultants

administration and implementation, as well as 
how the company was organized organization-
ally. A suggested approach was to structure the 
organization in a way how tax authorities would 
arrange it, i.e. from an accounting point of view. 
It is also crucial that during an implementation 
the right resources are available at the right time 
and at the right place. Every step in the process 
must be analyzed carefully, taking into account 
complexities and potential hang-ups, and must be 
given appropriate and sufficient amount of time 
and resource to complete. Employees further 
commented that it is critical for success to have a 
group of people who are enthusiastic and motivated 
about the cause, since overtime is often necessary. 
Moreover, persuasion work is needed in many 
areas because some employees are often strongly 
opposed to the moves and do not understand the 
change. Besides, it is important that the group is 
at one with each other. 
This study provided valuable insights towards 
understanding ES implementations and their pe-
culiarities in the German manufacturing sector. 
Every company we visited made some unique 
experiences and learned in their own way. For 
some companies an advanced IT infrastructure 
posed a competitive advantage, whereas it was 
a necessity for others. The area of enterprise 
systems continues to remain an exciting area for 
research. It is hoped that this chapter will serve 
as a motivation to further explore these topics, 
preferably also reporting experiences of compa-
nies in regions and countries other than North 
America and Germany.R

KeyTem
German Mittelstand (German SMEs): The 
German Mittelstand refers to small and medium 
sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany, which form 
the backbone of the country’s economy. Number-
ing over one million companies, the Mittelstand 
employs over 20 million people, is responsible for 
almost 40 percent of total German gross invest-
ments and accounts for 30 percent of the exports 
(Hauser 2000). These enterprises are often highly 
innovative and entrepreneurial, and are frequently 
very competitive international market leaders. 
The primary focus of these German SMEs is 
usually on highly customized and specialized 
products and services, resulting in information 
systems becoming a key competitive weapon 
(Taylor, 1999; Voigt, 2001). The companies can 
rely on a highly skilled and flexible work force, 
which is supplied by Germany’s exceptional 
vocational training system. This leads to a very 
loyal and stable workforce, with a turnover rate 
of only about 3 percent. Overall, German SMEs 

  217
Enterprise System in the German Manufacturing Mittelstand
provide a unique setting to study the design and 
complexity of enterprise systems. The Mittelstand 
companies in our sample ranged in size between 
593 and 1,200 employees, with annual revenues 
between 64 and 378 million Euros.
ES Implementation and Usage: In our 
chapter we describe the experiences companies 
made when implementing and using enterprise 
systems. Four of our case study firms were in 
either of these two phases. Crucial preceding 
stages include the decision and planning phase. 
Without those two additional phases implementa-
tion and usage would not be possible, or only in a 
very haphazard way. In our chapter we therefore 
describe experiences of our companies in all of 
these stages, as illustrated in Figure 1 of the paper. 
A similar implementation and usage timeline was 
suggested by Markus and Tanis (2000). 
Impetus for a New System: One of our nine 
areas of investigation reported in the chapter. Here 
we explore who or what was the driving force be-
hind the ES implementation, i.e. what ultimately 
led the company to their current or future system. 
This can include functional departments, but also 
changes in the marketplace, increased competi-
tion, changing demands by customers, etc.
Implementation Success and Satisfaction: In 
this eighth issue we investigate in our chapter we 
describe the success and satisfaction companies 
reported with their ES planning, implementation 
and usage. While it can be difficult to quantify 
hard performance measures, also intangible ben-
efits are realized. 
Involvement of Employees and Training: 
With this seventh area of investigation we examine 
the level of employee involvement and training, 
and how these tasks were approached. Costs as-
sociated were also discussed. 
Order of Implementation: The fifth of our 
nine areas we focus on in the chapter. Here we 
deal with the order in which the different mod-
ules or components of the ES were implemented 
in the company, and the rationale behind the 
sequence. 
Power of Final Decision: This is the second 
of our nine issues that we focus on, which deals 
with who was responsible for the final decision to 
modify or replace the current ES infrastructure. 
Change agents can include top management, the 
owner of the firm, or IT personnel. 
Standard Packages, modifications, and In-
house Developed Applications: This sixth focus 
area in our chapter reports on whether standard 
packages supplied by providers were chosen, and 
if yes, whether and to what extent modifications 
were carried out. If in-house developed applica-
tions were preferred, benefits and challenges, as 
well as integration possibilities, were discussed. 
Rationales behind each choice were explored.
 System and Provider Selection: The third 
of our nine focus areas deals with the process 
or approach taken to select the system and its 
provider(s). Possible influencing factors include 
the availability of solutions with good fit, the 
sustainability of the provider, the capabilities of 
the system, the preferences of the company, and 
its internal processes. 
Time Spent in System Selection, Planning 
and Implementation: In this fourth area of inves-
tigation we report on the time spent for selecting 
the system, planning the implementation, and then 
finally implementing the ES. The time taken and 
required can be quite long at times, which however 
often ensures a sound and thorough process. 
Upgrades After Implementation: This final 
area of investigation in our chapter deals with 
how upgrades and new releases after the imple-
mentation were handled. These upgrades can be 
quite time-consuming, and usually not every new 
release is implemented.

and Large Organizations

Organizations invest substantial resources in acquiring Enterprise Systems, presumably expecting posi-
tive impacts to the organization and its functions. Despite the optimistic motives, some Enterprise System 
projects have reported nil or detrimental impacts. This chapter explores the proposition that the size of 
the organization (e.g. medium, large) may contribute to the differences in benefits received. The alleged 
differences in organizational performance are empirically measured using a prior validated model, using 
four dimensions employing data gathered from 310 respondents representing 27 organizations. 
Inoduon
Enterprise System (ES) is an ideology of plan-
ning and managing the resources of an entire 
organization in an efficient, productive, and 
profitable manner, and is manifested in the form 
of configurable information system packages 
(Laukkanen, Sarpola et al. 2007). The Enterprise 
System vendors promote a fully integrated core 
business processes through the organization where 
seamless integration of the information flowing 
from one functional area to the other. Amongst 
the myriad of benefits, Enterprise Systems said 
to deliver key benefits like: cost reduction, pro-
ductivity improvement, quality improvement, 
customer service improvement, better resource 
management, improved decision-making and 
planning, and organizational empowerment 
(Shang and Seddon 2002).
Organizations devote substantial resources 
and time on acquiring an Enterprise System, 
presumably expecting positive impacts to the 

  219
Size Matters!
organization and its functions. These extensive 
ES implementations are typically measured in 
millions of dollars Pan et al (2001), and for many 
organizations they represent the largest single IT 
investment. The substantial resource requirements 
for Enterprise Systems have restricted Enterprise 
System market to the Medium-Large organiza-
tions with many suggesting that ES are best suited 
for Large Corporations (Hillegersberg and Kumar 
2000). Recent changes in market place, wherein 
the demand for Enterprise Systems from large 
organizations has plateau, vendors are attempting 
to shift their emphasis into the Small-Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) with scaled-down ES prod-
ucts (Piturro 1999; Everdingen, Hillegersberg et 
al. 2000).
Measuring the impacts of Enterprise Systems 
takes on special importance since the costs and 
risks of these large technology investments rival 
their potential payoffs. Often carefully rational-
ized in advance, ES investments are too seldom 
systematically evaluated post-implementation 
(Thatcher and Oliver 2001). Welsh and White 
(1981) differentiated the small and large organi-
zations using such aspects like time, skills, and 
resources – where the medium organizations 
lacking all three compared to their counterparts. 
D’Amboise and Muldowney (1988) argue that the 
lack of resources has made smaller organizations 
more vulnerable to the environmental effects 
and misjudgments forcing them to allocate more 
time to adjusting to, rather than devoting time on 
predicting and controlling. The resource lack of 
constraints has been found to hinder IT adoption 
(Baker 1987; Cragg and Zinatelli 1995; Iacovou, 
Benbasat et al. 1995; Proudlock, Phelps et al. 
1999), and to negatively affect IS implementation 
success (Thong 2001) and IT growth (Cragg and 
King 1993) in SMEs. 
With the aforementioned background – where 
organizations devote huge resources acquiring 
ES and many not receiving anticipated benefits, 
where the traditional market leveling with ES 
vendors moving into the SME market segment 
– this chapter discusses whether the organization 
size has an influence over the benefits brought-to-
bear by the Enterprise System. This study aims 
to contribute to the encyclopedia by investigating 
the relationship of organizational size with the 
performance of the system (commonly referred 
to as System Success). Although prior research 
(Raymond 1985; DeLone 1988; Raymond 1992; 
Lai 1994) has contributed to our understanding 
of IS and organization size, few have empiri-
cally assessed influence of organizational size 
for contemporary IS success. More importantly, 
instead of resorting to the customary approach 
of considering large and medium-sized organiza-
tions as one homogenous group receiving equal 
benefits, this study aims to bring forth the differ-
ences between these two groups using four system 
related dimensions. This study presented herein 
investigates the influence of organization size 
on ES performance. ES impacts are empirically 
measured using information received from 310 
responses representing 27 organizations that had 
implemented a market leading Enterprise System 
solutions in the second half of 1990.
The chapter begins with a historical overview 
of literature on size as an important determinant. 
The broad contextual overview begins by differ-
entiating characteristics of the medium vs. large 
organizations and demonstrating the impact of 
such contextual factors on System success. The 
research context is introduced next followed by 
discussions on the research methodology and data 
collection instrument. The final section demon-
strates the observed differences between the two 
organizational sizes and research implications. 
Bagound
Prior research suggests that organizational context 
is a determinant of Information System (IS) suc-
cess. Researchers have concluded that medium 
organizations have distinctive and unique needs 
compared to large organizations (Raymond 1985; 

220  
Size Matters! 
DeLone 1988; Lai 1994) and therefore, the research 
findings of large organizations cannot be general-
ized to small to mid-sized firms. 
Schultz and Slevin (1975) and Ein-Dor and 
Segev (1978) were among the very first point out 
the importance of organizational factors in man-
aging Information Systems. In their early work, 
Ein-Dor and Segev (1978) proposed a framework 
after studying Management Information System 
(MIS) in which they identified organization size 
as a critical variable. Ein-Dor and Segev (1978) 
identified ten (10) organizational variables with 
direct or indirect influence on the impact of an 
IS. The identified variables are: (1) organization 
size, (2) maturity, (3) structure, (4) time frame, 
(5) psychological climate towards [CB] IS, (6) 
organizational situation, (7) rank of responsible 
executives, (8) location of responsible executives, 
(9) steering committee location and rank and (10) 
resources. They found that the organization size 
had special importance because of its influence 
on resource availability, requirements necessary 
for integration of professional units within an 
organization, degree of formalization of organi-
zational systems, and lead time for planning and 
implementation. Furthermore, Ein-Dor and Segev 
(1978) recognized organization size as an uncon-
trollable variable and stated that [CB] IS projects 
are less likely to succeed in smaller organizations 
compared to larger organizations. 
Bilili and Raymond (1993) described SME 
decision making process as reactive, informal, 
and intuitive. (Doukidis, Lybereas et al. 1996; 
Proudlock, Phelps et al. 1999) asserted the op-
portunistic, day-to-day focus of the small to 
mid-sized organizations in relation to Informa-
tion Systems. Whisler (1970) studied nineteen 
insurance companies and reputed that firm size 
was directly related to performance of IS. Cheney 
(1983) identified various factors that would affect 
a small business firm’s success or failure in using 
information systems and found three areas of 
difficulty associated in small businesses informa-
tion systems: (1) software problems, (2) hardware 
problems and (3) implementation problems. 
DeLone (1981) studied the relationship be-
tween the size of a manufacturing firm and IS 
usage and concluded that firm size is: (1) directly 
related to the age of the firm’s computer operations, 
(2) inversely related to the amount of external 
programming that is used, (3) directly related to 
the portion of revenues allocated to Electronic 
Data Processing (EDP), and (4) inversely related 
to the percentage of EDP costs that are used for 
computer equipment. He also explained that 
smaller firms experience more computer related 
problems than their larger counterparts. Melone 
(1985) found that managers in small to mid-sized 
organizations rate accounting and inventory con-
trol as the most frequently used and important 
applications, and reported that inventory control 
was the most problematic aspect of computer 
usage in such organizations. Nickel and Seado 
(1986) reputed similar findings using 121 small 
businesses stating that budgeting and inventory 
control were the primary uses of IS in small 
organizations. Farhoomand and Hrycyk (1985) 
reported lack of technical staff as a substantial 
issue for the small to mid-sized companies. 
A study by Cooley et al. (1987) identified the 
importance of user-friendly interfaces and lower 
implementation costs as key factors affecting end 
users in small to mid-sized organizations. Mon-
tazemi (1988) investigating the aforementioned 
preposition, confirmed the impact of organization 
size on end user satisfaction. 
An organization has two basic options when it 
decides to implement a computerized application; 
(1) to have its own staff develop the software, or 
(2) to acquire packaged software from a vendor 
(Raymond, 1985). Turner (1992) stated that as 
a firm increases in size, it would demand more 
sophisticated software. Even though that this argu-
ment is intuitive, it suggests a correlation between 
organization size and the adoption of package 
software. Turner (1992) specifically emphasized 
the importance of small to mid-tier organiza-
tions obtaining assistance from external sources 
rather than developing applications in house. To 

  221
Size Matters!
the contrary, Raymond (1985) found that small 
firms are capable of developing, implementing and 
administering their own applications in-house, 
compared to their larger counterparts, specify-
ing that small organizations could maintain an IS 
with minimal financial, technical and personnel 
requirements. The resource constraints has lead 
SMEs to follow an incremental approach to IT 
investments, which, in turn, may result in isolated 
and incompatible systems, as well as decreased 
flexibility (Levy and Powell 1998). Raymond 
(1992) emphasized on the advantages of small 
to mid-sized firms in developing in-house appli-
cations rather than adopting packaged software 
from commercial vendors. They further added 
that end user computing, (where the user have 
direct control over their computing needs) is more 
appropriate to such organizations than adopting 
a packaged software application. 
Many researchers have alluded to the skill 
scarcity for information systems in Small to 
mid-sized organizations (Bilili and Raymond 
1993; Levy and Powell 1998; Mitev and Marsh 
1998). Laukkanen et al. (2007) suggest that the 
resource constraints faced by SMEs may hinder 
their ability to maintain technology up to date, 
while at the same time forcing them to consider 
their investments in IT as something that should 
last for a long time (Levy and Powell 1998). 
Soh et al. (1992) investigated the importance of 
external consultants on computerization success 
in small businesses, concluding that the level of 
computer system usage in small businesses with 
consultants is higher than that of small busi-
nesses without consultants. Further, they added 
that small businesses that engage consultants are 
less likely to complete there IS project on time 
and within budget. Harrison (1997) using the 
Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to explained 
technology adoption. They found that as business 
size increased, the importance of expectations 
from the [social] environment increased. How-
ever, they observed a negative correlation with 
the importance of intra-firm consequences and 
control over the potential barriers for IS adoption. 
Hong and Kim (2001) explored the ‘fit perspec-
tive’ in 34 Enterprise System installations where 
organizational size was implicitly considered as 
a critical contingency variable. 
In classifying organizations in the small  
medium  large spectrum, many authors use the 
number of employees as the sole classifier. For 
example in a recent study (Laukkanen, Sarpola 
et al. 2007), SMEs are defined here as enterprises 
with fewer than 250 employees, wherein the small 
organizations defined as companies with less than 
50 employees and large organizations are simply 
classified as those companies that do not meet 
the definition of SMEs and have more than 250 
employees (Chau 1994; Chau 1995). However, 
it is unrealistic to associate a 50 staff (or less) 
organizations with a large scaled traditional En-
terprise System implementations as such systems 
are targeted at larger counterparts. Though the 
number of employees in a company provides some 
indication to the size of the Enterprise System, 
at times it can be quite misleading due to not all 
employees having access to an Enterprise System. 
For example, in a Health and Pharmaceutical 
organization – where the majority of the staff is 
on medical duties (e.g. doctors and nurses) – the 
actual Enterprise System users will be a small 
proportion of the total number of employees. 
In recent years, Sedera et al (2003) suggest the 
use of number of user licenses to determine the 
size of the organization for Enterprise System 
discussions. They suggest keeping 1000 (or over) 
concurrent user licenses as a benchmark for large 
organizations and anything below classifying as 
medium enterprises.
TheSudy
 CONTEXTConex 
The empirical data collection was conducted 
across 27 public sector agencies running live 
the market leading Enterprise System. These 27 
agencies were the first Australian state agencies 

222  
Size Matters! 
to have implemented common financial manage-
ment software state-wide namely. In 1995 the state 
Government commenced implementation of the 
Financials module across all state Government 
agencies (later followed by Controlling, Materi-
als Management and in some agencies Human 
Resources) and soon became one of the largest 
Enterprise System installations in Australia. 
The state Government approach was very much 
focused on using the Enterprise System as a com-
mon reporting and financial management tool. 
The objectives of the new financial system were 
to provide a financial management system to state 
Government agencies that would: (1) support the 
‘Managing for Outcomes’ (MFO) framework and 
financial management improvement activities, (2) 
encourage best practice resource management 
across state Government, (3) facilitate the consoli-
dation of state Government financial information, 
(4) meet the business needs of agencies and (5) 
achieve economies of scale in main operations.
Despite the claimed benefits by most of the 
agencies, a relatively smaller agency that provides 
corporate services to a group of other agencies 
demonstrated their dissatisfaction with their 
Enterprise System. Even though the Enterprise 
System provided rich functionality to this orga-
nization, the senior management believed that the 
system in place was too complex and too expensive 
to operate in a smaller organization. After three 
years of using the implemented Enterprise System, 
the agency decided to replace that with a local, 
small scaled Enterprise System. The contextual 
background further questions the preposition 
in discussion – whether the organizational size 
influences the benefits you receive.
TheSu
vey
A survey instrument was designed to opera-
tionalize 27 measures of ES-success depicted 
in Table 1 (See details in (Gable, Sedera et al. 
2003; Sedera and Gable 2004). All items were 
scored on a seven-point Likert scale with the end 
values (1) ‘Strongly disagree’ and (7) ‘Strongly 
Agree’, and the middle value (4) ‘Neutral’. The 
draft survey instrument was pilot tested with a 
selected sample of staff of the state Government 
Treasury Department. Feedback from the pilot 
round respondents resulted in minor modifications 
to survey items. The survey gathered additional 
demographic details on respondents’ employment 
title (e.g. Director, Business Analyst, Applica-
tion programmer). Furthermore, the respondents 
were asked to provide a brief description of 
their involvement with the Enterprise System. 
Supplementary information on the organizational 
structure, characteristics of the Enterprise System 
(i.e. modules in use and hardware in place) and 
the number of users in each agency was gathered 
from objective sources.
In addition to the 27 items of Table 3, the 
questionnaire included two criterion items aimed 
at gauging the respondent’s perception of overall 
ES-success: (1) ‘overall…the impact of [the name

A total of three hundred and nineteen (319) 
responses from twenty-seven (27) public sector 
agencies were received. Nine responses were re-
moved from the analysis due to missing values and 
perceived frivolity. Using the number of SAP user 
licenses, the sample was divided into two mutu-
ally exclusive representing the respondents from 
medium organizations and large organizations. 
Organizations with more than 1000 SAP user 
licenses considered as large agencies and the rest 
were medium agencies. Additional criteria were 
established (i.e. Number of employees, dispersion 
of the organization) to be used in the grouping 
exercise to supplement the principal criterion, 
where the initial classification was unclear. Table 
2(a) shows the break down of organizations, clas-
sified into medium and large organizations and 
Table 2(b) shows the classification of respondents 
segregated into the two agency cohorts. All indica-
tions suggest that this distribution is representa-
tive of users of the Enterprise System in the state 
Government. All participated agencies having: (1) 
the same Enterprise System software application, 
(2) the similar versions of the Enterprise System, 
(3) in the same phase of the ES life cycle, and (4) 
installed Financial Accounting and Controlling, 
Materials Management modules created a unique 
homogeneous environment increasing the com-
parability of the data.    
The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
F-test was chosen as the method for conducting 
the analysis of the Likert scale data. For each 
variable measured with Likert scale the statistics 
reported include the arithmetic mean (mean) and 
standard deviation (std dev.) of the responses in 
each company group, the significance of group 
mean differences (sig.) indicated by F-test, and 
the group sizes (n). If a significant difference was 
found in ANOVA at the 0.05 level, paired t-tests 
comparisons were conducted to see which of 
the company groups differ from each other. The 
criterion item (Overall, the impact of [the name 
of the Enterprise System] on the agency has been 
positive) was used to establish the peripheral

differences between the two cohorts. Analysis 
of our survey data indicates that significant dif-
ferences exist between the medium-sized, and 
large organization with a high F value of 5.22. 
It is also observed that the large organizations 
demonstrate a higher mean score for the criterion 
item over the medium organizations. 
Encouraged by the findings above, using the 
averages of each of the four success dimensions, 
we conducted an independent sample t-test to 
further explore the differences between the two 
organizational sizes with regards to the dimen-
sions.
Results depicted in Table 4 indicate significant 
differences between the two organizational sizes 
in three of the four success dimensions. The differ-
ences are observed in System Quality, Individual 
Impacts and Organization Impacts.
Having determined that two organizational 
sizes demonstrate significant differences in rela-
tion to the Enterprise System success dimensions, 
the chapter now attempts to identify where those 
differences exists and whether an Enterprise Sys-
tem investment favors a particular organizational 
size. In order to establish this, we now look at the 
mean scores of each success dimension and their 
corresponding measures.
Syem
UALITYualy
The quality of a system under investigation is a 
multifaceted phenomenon. The system quality 
construct is designed to capture how the system 
performs from a technical and design perspective. 
Nine validated measures have been employed 
in this study. Results depicted in Figure 1, it is 
evident that for all 09 measures on Enterprise 
System Quality, large organizations demonstrate 
relatively larger mean scores compared to their 
smaller counterparts. Moreover, the following 
observations are made in relation to the measures 
of system quality. All, but two measures (flexibility 
and customization), have received below scale-
median (4) values for the large organizations. To 
the contrary, for medium organizations, 6 of the 
9 measures report below scale-median scores. 
The two cohorts demonstrate substantial dif-
ferences in mean scores across IT-sophistication 
and the employment of system features. Similarly, 
the mean scores on Enterprise System meeting 
the requirements of the organization demonstrate 
differences between the medium and large co-
horts, with large reporting high mean scores. It 
is noticed with some interest that system centric 
attributes such as: integration and customization 
do not demonstrate strong differences between 
the two cohorts. 
Infomaon
UALITYualy
Measures of information quality focus on the 
output – both on-screen and reports – produced 
by the system, and the value, usefulness or relative 
importance attributed to the output by the users.

In an early leading study of IS success, Bailey 
and Pearson (1983) identified nine characteris-
tics of information quality: accuracy, precision, 
currency, timeliness, reliability, completeness, 
conciseness, format and relevance. Sirinivasan 
(1985) added ‘understandability’ of information 
as another important sub-construct; while Saa-
ksjarvi and Talvinen (1993) employed content, 
availability, accuracy as sub-construct measures 
of information quality in their study of market-
ing information systems. Rainer (1995) found 
accuracy, timeliness, conciseness, convenience 
and relevance as being key aspects of Executive 
Information Systems information quality. Results 
of the exploratory survey and expert workshops 
revealed context-specific measures of information 
quality and thus significant changes have been 
made to the sub-constructs of information qual-
ity. The study employs the six validated measures 
from the ES-Success of Gable Sedera et at 2003; 
Sedera Gable 2004. The Figure 2 depicts the mean 
scores for the six measures of Information Quality. 
Similar to System Quality dimension discussed 
above, large organizations demonstrate a higher 
mean score for all six measures.

Though all mean-scores reported for Informa-

substantial differences were observed only in 
relation to Information Relevance and the format 
of the reports. 
Indvdual
 IMPImpa
Individual impact is concerned with how the 
Enterprise System influences the performance 
of the individual user. Individual impact tends to 
encompass a broad range of subjective measures 
such as: confidence in decisions made, improve-
ments in decision-making, and the time to reach 
a decision (Ein-Dor, Segev et al. 1981; Sirinivasan 
1985; Kim and Lee 1986). Dickson et al. (1977) 
provided early insights into Individual Impact 
citing decision quality, decision time, decision 
confidence, and estimated outcomes. Though 
individual productivity and decision making ef-
fectiveness have been mentioned in prior studies 
as impacts from the system, the potential benefits 
from the Enterprise System exceeds those and in-
cludes aspects such as – facilitating organizational 
learning and information recall and awareness 
through organizational transparency. 
Observing mean scores reported in Figure 3, 
similar patters are observed to the previous two 
success dimensions with large organizations 
receiving more benefits from the Enterprise Sys-
tem. More importantly, the mean score analysis 
demonstrates a bleak picture of the amount of 
individual benefits received to the medium scaled 
organizations with substantial differences in all 
four perspectives.   
ORGANIZATIOganzaonal IMPImpa
The impact of an Enterprise System on organiza-
tional performance is some-what difficult to isolate 
from the general organizational performance 
indicators. The eight measures of the ES-suc-
cess measurement model purportedly isolate the 
impact of the system with the one of the organiza-
tion. The analyses of the mean scores for the 08 
measures support all observations above favoring 
the large organizations. 
It is also observed that the medium organiza-
tions report substantially lower mean scores for 
five out of the eight measures. The biggest dif-
ferences were seen in facilitation of e-business 
through Enterprise Systems and the introduction

of optimal business process changes. The three 
cost related aspects: (1) reduction of organization 
costs, (2) reduction of staff and (3) operational 
costs reductions have received below median 
scores for both organizational cohorts (See figure 
4 for details). 
Con
lu
on
This chapter explored whether there are significant 
differences exist between medium-sized and large 
enterprises regarding the success of the Enter-
prise System. In doing so, it gathered data from 
310 respondents from 27 organizations that had 
implemented a market leading Enterprise System 
in the second half of 1990. The impact of the En-
terprise System was empirically measured using 
validated constructs measures of the Enterprise 
System Success Measurement Model (Gable, 
Sedera et al. 2003; Sedera and Gable 2004). 
The findings indicate that organization size 
undoubtedly has a strong influence over the 
benefits received from the system. Though there 
have been other studies investigating various 
aspects of Enterprise System (e.g. differences 
between small, medium and large organizations 
on Enterprise System initial objectives and con-
straints of adoption (Laukkanen, Sarpola et al. 
2007), implementation issues (Mabert, Soni et 
al. 2003), this is one of the first to demonstrate 
the differences in relation to the outcomes of the 
system.
The homogeneity in the study context – where 
all the sampled organization having implemented 
the same Enterprise System, similar modules and 
are at the same phase of the lifecycle – provided 
a distinct strength to the study, where the results 
are less vulnerable to extraneous factors. The 
study employed the number of Enterprise System 
User Licenses to classify the organizations in to 
the two organizational sizes. The authors argued 
the bias and the influence that other factors (e.g. 
number of employees and budget) may bring forth 
in a study of this nature.
The results empirically provide evidence to a 
well-known anecdote that traditional Enterprise 
Systems are better suited for the Large Orga-
nizations. The results demonstrated significant 
differences between the medium and large 
organizations in relation to Enterprise System 
Quality, Impacts to the Individuals, and Impacts 
to the Organization. No differences were observed 
in relation to the Quality of Information derived 
from the system.  
Figure 4. Mean scores for organization impacts

228  
Size Matters! 
Substantial differences between the two types 
of organizations were observed in relation to 
Individual and Organizational impacts – raising 
concerns over the suitability of Enterprise Systems 
for medium sized organizations. 
The result also demonstrated that some of the 
common system related issues, such as customiza-
tion, are equally deterrent to both organizational 
types. Similarly, the innate Enterprise System 
advantages like the integration are equally ben-
eficial to both organizational types.
We recognize two attributes that may have 
contributed to the under-performance of Enter-
prise System in medium tiered organizations. 
The economies of scale could be one the lead-
ing factors that hamper the results of medium 
tiered organizations. From the study findings it 
is evident that medium sized organizations have 
received reasonable benefits through System 
and Information Quality dimensions. However, 
the stark differences observed in Individual and 
Organization Impacts suggests that though the 
system and information quality were adequate, 
mid-sized companies have failed to attain cost, 
productivity and resource benefits. Specifically, 
in resource-demanding ERP investments, the 
larger enterprises have been found to be able to 
take advantage of economies of scale and, hence, 
compared to their larger counterparts, smaller 
companies are faced with a relatively bigger 
commitment when adopting Enterprise Systems 
(Mabert, Soni et al. 2000).
Secondly, the resource limitations character-
ized in medium organizations is identified as 
another probable contributor to the poorer success 
reported by the medium-sized companies. Akin 
to a popular view where practitioners argue that 
‘implementing an Enterprise System is just the 
beginning’, organizations are required to make 
continuous investments into optimizing an Enter-
prise System. The resource scarcity of mid-sized 
organizations may not allow further investments 
into the Enterprise System on training, upgrades, 
business process improvements and organiza-
tional change management practices. 
The findings are particularly important to the IT 
practitioners (and academics alike) to understand 
the diversity of impacts received from Enterprise 
System and the importance of contextual factors. 
At a time where the Enterprise System vendors 
are moving aggressively towards scaled-down 
systems specifically targeting at small organiza-
tions, the study results provide some caution over 
the claimed benefits of Enterprise Systems.

ERP implementation projects normally involve a single vendor providing the packaged software for the 
entire system. Although most companies follow this practice, a significant number of firms employ an 
alternate strategy of “best of breed” ERP. This strategy involves selecting software that best matches the 
current or desired business practices of the company from a variety of vendors.  This strategy reduces the 
need for the firm to customize the software or to significantly reengineer its business practices. Best of 
Breed offers firms the opportunity to maintain or create competitive advantage based on unique business 
processes. “Vanilla” ERP implementations may result in competitors all adopting the same business 
processes leaving no firm with an advantage. 
ITRCTI
In an increasingly competitive global environ-
ment, firms are using information technology to 
increase their competitiveness and gain better 
information for decision making. Many firms 
have implemented enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) systems to further these goals.  Enterprise 
resource planning systems are off-the-shelf 
software systems, which claim to meet the in-
formation needs of organizations. These systems 
are usually adopted to replace hard to maintain 
legacy systems developed by IS departments or 
older off-the-shelf packages that often provided 
only piecemeal solutions to the organization’s 
information needs. ERP systems evolved in the 
1990s from material requirements planning sys-
tems (MRP), which was developed in the 1970s, 

234  
Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
and manufacturing resources planning systems 
(MRPII), which was developed in the 1980s. 
ERP systems serve the entire organization, not 
just material or manufacturing planning.  A 
major advantage of ERP is that it integrates all 
the information for the entire organization into 
a single database, thus reducing repetitive data 
entry and the number of errors.
ERP systems have proven expensive and time 
consuming to implement.  Failed and abandoned 
projects have been well publicized in the business 
press.  Muscatello and Parente (2006) cite ERP 
failure rates to be as high as 50%.  ERP systems 
are “expensive and difficult to implement, often 
imposing their own logic on a company’s strategy 
and existing culture (Pozzebon, 2000, p. 1015).” 
Hershey Foods, for example, was unable to fill 
Halloween candy orders after spending $112 
million on an ERP project resulting in a drop in 
its stock price and lost market share (Severance 
& Passino, 2002).  Davenport (1998) identifies 
other unsuccessful projects such as Fox-Meyer 
Drug that claimed an ERP systems led to its 
bankruptcy, Mobil Europe that spent hundreds of 
millions on ERP but abandoned the project when 
a merger partner objected and Applied Material 
that gave up on its ERP project when it became 
overwhelmed with organizational change issues. 
Nike’s ERP implementation is included in a listing 
of “infamous failures in IT project management” 
(Nelson, 2007).  Major ERP related inventory 
problems at Nike resulted in a profit drop of $100 
million in the 3rd quarter of 2000.  
Most firms utilize a single software vendor 
for the complete ERP system throughout their 
organizations.  The integrated nature of ERP 
software favors this single vendor approach.  An 
alternative strategy adopted by some firms is 
the best of breed approach, where the adopting 
organization picks and chooses ERP functional 
modules from the vendor whose software best 
supports their business processes.  Organizations 
adopting a best of breed believe that this approach 
will create a better “fit” with existing or required 
business processes; reduce or eliminate the need 
to customize a single vendor solution; and reduce 
user resistance.  Jones and Young (2006) found that 
18% of companies surveyed used a best of breed 
approach to select ERP software packages.
This article examines what ERP implemen-
tation projects involve, what the best of breed 
strategy is, when it is used, what advantage adopt-
ing companies seek, examples of best of breed 
implementations, differences in critical success 
factors in “vanilla” and best of breed projects, and 
future trends in the best of breed strategy.B
BackgroundCKR
ERP implementation projects can be distinguished 
from other IT projects by three characteristics 
(Somers, Ragowsky, Nelson, & Stern, 2001).  First, 
ERP systems are “profoundly complex pieces of 
software, and installing them requires large invest-
ments in money, time and expertise (Davenport, 
1998, p. 122).”  Second, software packages may 
require the user to change business processes 
and procedures, may require customization, and 
leave the firm dependent on a vendor for support 
and updates (Lucas, Walton, & Ginsberg, 1988). 
Finally, adopting firms are usually required to 
reengineer their business processes.  Implementa-
tion projects must be managed as broad programs 
of organizational change rather than a software 
implementation (Markus & Tanis, 2000; Somers 
et al, 2001)
ERP systems include functionality for basic 
business processes based on the vendor’s inter-
pretation of best practices.  However, the selected 
functionalities do not generally match the existing 
business processes of all organizations.  
Typical ERP functions from SAP R/3, a major 
ERP vendor, are shown in Table 1.  SAP R/3 mod-
ules provide a wide range of functional solutions, 
however, with the wide range of potential ERP 
customers, some organizations may not be a good 
fit.  With the best of breed strategy, organizations 

  235
Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
can pick and choose the ERP modules from which 
ever vendor provides the best fit with its business 
processes and possibly reduce the amount of reen-
gineering of business processes required, hence 
reducing the level of employee resistance.  The 
better fit will also reduce or eliminate customizing 
the software to meet firm requirements.

The term “best of breed” was originally used in 
information systems literature to describe a situa-
tion where individual departments are allowed to 
install systems which best met their needs rather 
than a corporate standard.  
Software acquisition costs are lower when 
all departments use the same software systems 
because of joint purchase benefits such as volume 
discounts and other economies of scale.  But other 
costs may offset these savings.  Unit document 
costs may be higher on a single vendor approach 
compared with best of breed.  Cost to translate 
and reformat data may be excessive.  Switching 
costs may differ depending on the system chosen 
(Dewan, Seidmann, & Sunderesan, 1995).

ERP vendors design systems, which are “pur-
ported to represent best practice and a more 
competitive business model (Light & Holland, 
2001, p. 217).”  However, organizations interested 
in adopting ERP argue that “ERP software func-
tionality is often lacking, the implicit business

Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
reengineering business processes in line with 
this presents major difficulties (Light & Holland, 
2001, p. 217).”  
Single vendor packages seem to have strengths 
in a particular functional area.  PeopleSoft is 
known for exceptional human resource modules 
and Oracle has a reputation for exceptional finan-
cial modules (Light & Holland, 2001).  
Best of breed solutions provide an alternative 
strategy to enable organizations to implement 
ERP when a single vendor may not provide the 
functionality that the adopter requires or when 
modules from different vendors may provide a 
better match with existing or required business 
processes than a single vendor solution. Lack 
of feature-function fit may be due to the design 
of most ERP for discrete manufacturing. Many 
organizations have specialized business processes 
common to their industry that may not be solved 
by the best practices embedded into single vendor 
ERP systems.  Various modules may not support 
process manufacturing industries, such as food 
processing and paper manufacturing, project 
industries, such as aerospace, or industries that 
manufacture products with dimensionality, such 
a clothing or footwear (Markus & Tanis, 2000).
While providing the additional needed func-
tionalities, the best of breed approach complicates 
integration.  With a single vendor ERP system, 
“the whole package is designed for data compat-
ibility (Grant & Tu, 2005).”  With best of breed 
implementations middleware is usually needed 
to link the various modules and databases.  “The 
chance of being able to arrive at the same levels 
of integration as with an ERP system is very 
low, but this may be worth accepting as a means 
of saving the cost and pain associated with ERP 
implementation (Payne, 2002).”
Although most firms select a single vendor, a 
survey of Fortune 1000 firms found that 18% of 
the respondents chose ERP packages based on 
best of breed criteria. 32% of respondents used a 
combination of packages, such as SAP, People-
Soft, Oracle, Baan, JD Edwards, Lawson, Adage, 
SSA/CT (Jones & Young, 2006).
Although little empirical research has been 
done on best of breed ERP implementations, the 
information shown in Table 2 is the result of a 
single case study of a business referred to as Global 
Entertainment (Light & Holland, 2001).  The best 
of breed approach clearly gives the adopting or-
ganization the ability to determine functionality, 
rather than accepting a single vendor’s determina-
tion of best practices.  The adopting organization 
can select packages that best support their existing 
or desired business processes.
The adoption of a single vendor ERP may 
cause the loss of competitive advantage. The single 
vendor software may require the adopting organi-
zation to abandon its existing business processes, 
which may have created competitive advantage for 
the organization in favor of ERP vendor defined 
“best practices.” The organization’s competitors 
may have also adopted these vendor defined best 
practices, leaving the organization without a 
competitive advantage.
The best of breed approach may also spread 
the risk of the failure of an ERP vendor.  If a ven-
dor drops out of the ERP market for any reason, 
only a part of the system will be affected, not the 
entire system.
On the negative side, the best of breed approach 
requires more knowledge and skills in the adopting 
firm’s IT department to support multiple pack-
ages.  IT staff must be trained to support software 
from multiple vendors and maintain integration 
software as packages are upgraded.
Integration of modules from more than one 
vendor may be time consuming and costly.  Up-
grades to any of the vendor packages can cause 
complexities not encountered with a single vendor 
approach.
EXAMPLES OSF BEST OF BREEDBSTBR
Examples of best of breed selection and imple-
mentation projects may provide insight into the 
reasons best of breed remains a viable option for 
firms selecting ERP systems.  Example 1 is a 

  237
Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
simple best of breed project with only two ven-
dors.  Example 2 represents a more complex best 
of breed project involving five different vendor 
packages.
Example 1
This example presents a relatively simple use of a 
best of breed solution.  In 1995, a Houston-based 
energy services company embarked on a major 
systems effort.  Legacy systems were accounting 
oriented and provided little operating information. 
Y2K problems were the catalyst for proceeding 
with the project.  
With extensive help from the consultants on 
the project, Oracle was selected for the financial 
part of the new system.  Oracle was considerably 
less expensive than other systems the company 
considered and the majority owner of the company 
implemented Oracle several years earlier. The 
decision was complicated by the lack of an Oracle 
module to support process manufacturing.
To resolve Oracle’s inability at the time to 
support process manufacturing, the company 
adopted a process manufacturing package from 
Datalogix called Global Enterprise Manufacturing 
Management Systems (GEMMS).  The interface 
software between Oracle and GEMMS presented 
many technical implementation problems, which 
were resolved by the vendors and implementation 
consultants. While these technical integration 
problems caused some minor delays, the problems 
were not a major implementation issue from the 
point of view of the company.
During the course of the implementation proj-
ect a risk of the best of breed strategy occurred. 
Oracle acquired Datalogix in the midst of the 
project.  Instead of helping resolve any problems 
by consolidating the software in one vendor, the 
acquisition exacerbated the problem because of a 
post-acquisition exodus of Datalogix personnel.
The best of breed approach did not signifi-
cantly contribute to cost over-runs or delays in 
implementation. Overall, the project is regarded 
as a success.  The problems caused in the integra-
tion of the two vendor solutions impacted mainly 
the software vendors and consultants, although 
company personnel had to coordinate the par-
ties in reaching solutions. Project success can be 
attributed to the existence of project champions, 
extensive training, and use of a project manager 
with both ERP and project management experi-
ence and co-managers with extensive business 
experience with the company (Bradley, 2005).

Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
Example 2
This example involves three divisions of a major 
defense contractor based in Southern California. 
A series of acquisitions had left it with several 
non-integrated mainframe systems supplemented 
by PC based point solutions.  Prior to the ERP 
project each division was pursuing different ap-
proaches to their information systems needs.  One 
division was in the process of implementing an out 
of the box Baan ERP system, the second division 
was using a heavily customized WDS system and 
the third division had no IT infrastructure.  The 
corporate parent of these divisions wanted a single 
solution to control costs and leverage its purchas-
ing power on the purchase of the software.  This 
goal was complicated because the divisions had 
been highly independent of parent control and no 
single vendor offered a solution, which met the 
needs of all three divisions.  Standard packages 
failed to meet the needs of the bulk of its business. 
The parent was faced with balancing the benefits 
and cost savings of standardization with the flex-
ibility and independence of the divisions.
In 1996, when the project started, no single 
vendor provided a solution to the company’s needs. 
A joint oversight team from the three divisions 
selected WDS (now Manugistics) as the core, but 
incorporated best of breed solutions including 
PeopleSoft for human resource management, 
Oracle for financials, TIP QA for quality control, 
and Matrix One for product data management.
The best of breed approach did not cause 
significant problems according to the project 
manager, however, this project was his first 
ERP implementation, so he had little basis for 
comparison.  The project exceeded the original 
cost estimate and original time estimate, but was 
completed within contingency factor allowed in 
these estimates.  The original budget was $14 
million with $2 million as a contingency factor. 
The cost totaled $15.7.  The time budget was 24 
months with a 6 month contingency.  The project 
was completed in 30 months.  The management 
was satisfied that systems quality and information 
quality were improved by the project.  Users were 
satisfied that they had better tools to do their jobs 
(Bradley, 2005).
Example 3
Dell Computer selected a best of breed ERP 
strategy after struggling for two years imple-
menting SAP R/3 2.2. Dell’s strategy change 
from a worldwide focus to a segmented regional 
focus demanded more flexibility than the current 
version of SAP R/3 provided.  Dell selected i2 
Technologies to manage raw materials throughout 
the company, Oracle for order management, and 
Glovia for manufacturing tasks (Stein, 1998).
 
C tical Success FactorsalSueao
Identifying and utilizing critical success factors 
in major IT projects can enhance the probability 
of success of an implementation project.  Bradley 
(2005) identified and tested ten proposed critical 
success factors in eight case studies.  Sumner and 
Bradley (2007) examined these same ten proposed 
critical success factors in ERP implementation in 
“vanilla” ERP projects and Best of Breed ERP 
projects.  The proposed factors examined in both 
studies included:
1.	
IT and business planning integration
2.	
Full time project manager
3.	
Reporting level of project manager
4.	
Experience of the project manager
5.	
Quality and quantity of training
6.	
Use of consultants
7.	
CEO Involvement
8.	
Champion
9.	
Management’s effectiveness in reducing 
change resistance
10.	 Steering committee

  239
Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
Sumner and Bradley (2007) found little differ-
ence in these factors between the two strategies. 
Best of breed projects shared CSFs with vanilla 
implementations in all areas.  The strongest rela-
tionship to project success was found in choosing 
the right full-time project manager, the quality and 
quantity of employee training and the existence 
of effective champions.  
Sumner and Bradley (2007) identified criti-
cal success factors unique to best of breed ERP 
implementations in a case study of two best of 
breed implementation projects.  These success 
factors involved building interfaces between the 
different vendor packages, managing upgrades 
from different vendors, and managing the cost 
implications to justify the project in terms of 
business results.  While vendor management 
is important in all implementation projects, the 
existence of multiple vendors further complicates 
this issue and increases its importance in best of 
breed projects (Bradley, 2005).    
ER
ADD-ONS
Practitioners have extended the term best of breed 
to include add-on applications not included in typi-
cal transaction processing ERP systems.  These 
applications include (Leahy, 2004): 
•	
Business performance management tools, 
•	
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance tools, 
•	
Human resource connection tools which 
provide linkage between performance and 
compensation, 
•	
Expense management tools to control travel 
and entertainment expenses
•	
Portfolio management tools to view IT 
project risks and returns, and 
•	
Receivables collection/cash flow manage-
ment tools, many of which are industry 
specific.
Leahy (2004) predicts that “best-of-breed prod-
ucts will continue to evolve at a rapid clip over the 
next few years.”  Although vendor consolidations 
will continue at a rapid pace, new partnerships and 
alliances will continue to be formed to develop 
new applications.  
FUTRTRS
The Gartner Group coined the term “ERP II” 
to describe the shift in ERP from an enterprise 
information base focusing on back office transac-
tion processing within one organization to moving 
information across the supply chain (“Taking the 
Pulse of ERP,” 2001).  Others refer to this process 
as “extended” enterprise systems.  ERP II or 
extended enterprise systems include: 
•	
customer relationship management (CRM) 
applications, which accumulate information 
to better serve customers, 
•	
supply chain management (SCM) applica-
tions which manage materials and services 
from acquisition to delivery to the customer, 
and 
•	
e-business applications to enable the orga-
nization to reach customers and suppliers 
over the Internet. 
Davenport and Brooks (2004) refer to basic 
ERP as infrastructural and SCM modules as stra-
tegic capabilities, raising the question of “whether 
to implement the infrastructural capabilities first, 
strategic capabilities first, or both simultaneously.” 
They believe that while the infrastructural capa-
bilities of ERP “provide very little in the way of 
real business value…they are critical to long-term 
internal and external integration.”  What they 
lack are short term cost savings and competitive 
advantage.  SCM and other extended enterprise 
systems modules is where the pay off is in terms 
of competitive advantage.

240  
Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
Best of breed terminology, while originally 
used for ERP software, is also applied to ERP 
II software.  Major ERP vendors have concen-
trated on the transaction processing or back 
office procedures in ERP.  Independent vendors 
have concentrated on the add-ons that constitute 
ERP II.  Davenport and Brooks (2004) point out 
that this situation is changing.  Mainstream ERP 
vendors are adding SCM and other functionalities 
to their packages, avoiding some of the integra-
tion issues.  But smaller vendors “have the edge 
in state-of-the-art functionality (Davenport et 
al, 2004).”  These smaller vendors are willing 
to explore clients’ needs and find markets.  Van 
Decker of the Meta Group believes that stand-alone 
software providers “can develop new products and 
bring those products to market faster than ERPs” 
(Leahy, 2004, p. 1).  Greenbaum, a consultant with 
Enterprise Applications Consulting, observes 
that “vendors have been forced by customers to 
open up their technology to allow easier integra-
tion…as a result they’ve actually expanded the 
best-of-breed market. (Westervelt, 2003, p. 1).” 
These observations seem to predict that the best 
of breed strategy will continue to be a viable 
strategy choice for both ERP and ERP II.
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) may add 
some of the features of best of breed with the con-
cept of modularity and can be web-based.  SOA 
builds a set of business processes from smaller 
modules called services.  A service may be as 
simple as viewing an online account statement or 
more complex like “check credit” (Koch, 2005). 
Services are strung together to create business 
process functionality.  Services may include 
legacy systems or other vendor’s ERP processes 
in almost any programming language.  
The SOAs add complexity to enterprise soft-
ware.  SOAs become additional layers of code 
superimposed on the existing layers of software. 
The concept of reusable code may work for small 
tasks, but as the services performed become more 
complex, the concept of reusability becomes more 
difficult.  When processes fail, the recovery task 
may become more difficult with multiple software 
layers (Rettig, 2007).  
C NCLUSIONCSI
Both single vendor and best of breed enterprise 
systems are complex and present a wide range 
of implementation problems.  The single vendor 
approach provides high levels of integration, 
but may require high levels of business process 
reengineering. Adopting the best practices for 
business processes defined by a single vendor 
may lead to competitors adopting the same busi-
ness practices.  With all firms employing the 
same business processes, no firm would enjoy 
a competitive advantage by providing superior 
business processes.  Competitive advantage can 
stem from the application of business processes 
that are superior to competitors.
The best of breed strategy will continue to 
be a viable option in both ERP and ERP II for 
organizations which attempt to create competitive 
advantage by assembling a “custom” ERP system 
to support their business processes rather than 
adopting the same off-the-shelf, “vanilla” ERP 
systems adopted by their competitors.   While 
most adopting organizations will stick with the 
full integration of a single vendor package, firms 
willing to take risks to obtain competitive advan-
tage will assemble a best of breed solution which 
enhances their ability to serve their customers.
Example 1 demonstrates how a best of breed 
strategy can compensate for the lack of a desired 
functionality in one vendor’s package by supple-
menting it with a second package.  Example 2 
shows how the strategy can blend together the 
diverse needs of three operating divisions to ar-
rive at a solution acceptable to all parties using 
software from five different vendors.  Example 
3 demonstrates that changes in business strategy 
may require more flexibility than can be provided 
in standard ERP packages.  The technical chal-
lenges presented by the best of breed option did 

  241
Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
not seriously hamper any of these implementation 
projects. 
Both implementation strategies will continue 
to be complex and costly.  Best of breed may 
provide an avenue to reduce the reengineering 
required at the cost of increased integration 
problems.  The single vendor approach may result 
in more reengineering of business processes but 
avoids the integration issues.
The best of breed implementation strategy is 
an area of ERP systems that has not been fully 
explored.  More research of this promising alter-
native implementation strategy is needed.  Future 
research is needed in the best of breed area:
•	
What will be the effect of vendor consoli-
dation? Oracle has purchased PeopleSoft 
and J. D. Edwards.  Will this consolidation 
continue, limiting the choices for companies 
seeking the best of breed option?  Will new 
stand alone vendors continue to develop 
leading edge products?  How fast will ma-
jor ERP suppliers move into niche markets 
enjoyed by the stand-alone vendors?
•	
Can best of breed be more effective in pro-
viding competitive advantage than vanilla 
ERP?  If every competitor adopts business 
processes from vanilla ERP packages, can 
any firm have a competitive advantage?
•	
How will ERP II change the best of breed 
market?
•	
Does best of breed reduce user resistance?
•	
What is the return on investment of best of 
breed ERP versus vanilla ERP?
•	
Does standardization of processes globally 
make sense in light of cultural differences, 
economic differences, and business practice 
differences?  
•	
Will service-oriented architecture become 
the method of choice to serve unique busi-
ness processes in ERP environments?R

Best of Breed:  Combination of ERP software 
provided by more than one vendor and legacy 
systems designed to meet the needs of an organi-
zation in a manner superior to the single vendor 
ERP approach.
Business Processes: “A business process 
is a set of business events that together enable 
the creation and delivery of an organization’s 
products or services to its customers (Gelinas et 
al, 2004).”  
Customer Relationship Management 
(CRM): These are software packages that en-
able a business to develop knowledge of their 
customer’s needs and buying patterns. These 
systems “focus on the integration of externally 
based customer data for the organization to pursue 
more customer-oriented activities like targeted 
advertising, one-on-one marketing (Peppers et al., 
1993), customer retention and building a real-time 
integrated view of the customer (Goodhue et al., 
2002; Kos et al., 2001; Winer, 2001) ” (Pan, 2005, 
p. 66).  Another definition is “a comprehensive 
strategy and process of acquiring, retaining and 
partnering with selective customers to create 
superior value for the company and customers” 
(Parvatiyar and Sheth, 2001, p. 5).
Enterprise Resource Planning Systems 
(ERP): An off-the-shelf accounting-oriented 
information system that is designed to meet 
the information needs of most organizations. 
ERP systems enable organization to procure, 
process and deliver customer goods or services 
in a timely, predictable manner.  These systems 
are complex and expensive information tools, 
which have proven difficult and time consuming 
to implement.
ERP II or Extended Enterprise Systems: 
ERP II opens ERP systems beyond the enterprise 
level to exchange information with supply chain 
partners and customers.  ERP II extends beyond 
the four-walls of the business to trading partners. 
Typically, ERP II includes customer relationship 
management (CRM) packages, supply chain 
management (SCM) packages and e-business 
packages.
Integration:  Integration is generally defined 
as “the bringing together of related components 
to form a unified whole…The primary concern of 
integration is ‘oneness’ and ‘harmony’ between 
user, technology, and the environment (Grant & 
Tu, 2005, p.8).”   Grant & Tu propose a taxonomy 
of ERP integration ranging from the lowest level, 
system-specification integration, to global integra-
tion which deals with “issues of language, time 
difference, culture, politics, customs, manage-
ment style.”  Their proposed level-II deals with 
system-user integration at both the ergonomic and 
cognitive level.  Level-III deals with integration 
of islands of technology throughout the firm.
Legacy Systems: Transaction processing sys-
tems designed to perform specific tasks.  Systems 
that have become outdated as business needs 
change and the hardware and software available 
in the market place have improved. 
Material Requirements Planning Systems 
(MRP).  Processes that use bills of materials, in-
ventory data and a master productions schedule to 
time phase material requirement, releasing inven-
tory purchases in a manner that reduces inventory 
investment yet meets customer requirements. 
Manufacturing Resources Planning (MR-
PII): MRPII extends MRP by addressing all 
resources in addition to inventory.  MRPII links 
material requirements planning with capacity re-
quirements planning avoiding the over and under 
shop loading typical with MRP.  MRPII includes 
more business functionality than MRP, dealing 
with sales, production, inventory, schedules, and 
cash flows (Palaniswamy & Frank, 2000)

Implementing Best of Breed ERP Systems
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): 
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) represents 
a collection of best practices principles and pat-
terns related to service-aware, enterprise-level, 
distributed computing (OASIS, 2008).  
Supply Chain Management (SCM): These 
software packages exchange information with 
supply chain partners to order and track the 
procurement of goods and services.  SCM can 
be viewed in four basic categories (Davenport 
& Brooks, 2004): supply planning tools; de-
mand planning tools; plant scheduling tools; 
and logistics systems.  A newer functionality in 
SCM is collaborative planning, forecasting, and 
replenishment (CPFR).  In CPFR, “supply chain 
partners exchange not only orders and shipment 
notices, but sales plans and production forecasts 
with each other, so that they can synchronize their 
respective processes more fully (p. 12).”

Enterprise resource planning systems are complex yet single, integrated software programs that runs 
off a single database so that the various departments can easily share information and communicate 
with each other. The integrated approach can have a tremendous payback if companies implement the 
software correctly. This chapter illustrates the implementation steps as followed by major corporations 
in the United States, and provide an insight into the practical implementation issues. A business case for 
such systems is introduced in this chapter as well. The chapter provides seven ERP issues and elaborates 
these issues in the context of implementation. The implementation details during conceptualization, 
design, implementation, go-live, and operation stages are provided with a note to practitioners on ERP 
implementation.
Inoduon
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software at-
tempts to integrate all departments and functions 
across a company onto a single computer system 
that can serve all those different departments’ 
particular needs (Koch 2002). Each of those de-
partments typically has its own computer system 
optimized for the particular way that the depart-
ment does its work. But ERP combines them all 
together into a single, integrated software program 
that runs off a single database so that the various 
departments can more easily share information 
and communicate with each other. That integrated 
approach can have a tremendous payback if com-
panies install the software correctly. 
Typically, when a customer places an order, that 
order begins a mostly paper-based journey from 
in-basket to in-basket around the company, often 
being keyed and re-keyed into different depart-

246  
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation
ments’ computer systems along the way. These 
activities cause delays and errors. Meanwhile, no 
one in the company truly knows what the status 
of the order is at any given point because there is 
no way for the finance department, for example, 
to get into the warehouse’s computer system to 
see whether the item has been shipped. ERP can 
replace the old standalone computer systems in 
accounting, human resources, manufacturing, 
and warehouse with single unified software. 
This results in integrated software that is linked 
together so that someone in finance can look into 
the warehouse module to see if an order has been 
shipped. Most vendors’ ERP software is flexible 
enough to install certain modules without buying 
the whole package. 
Enterprise systems that encompass all depart-
mental processes can often be complex and in-
terdependent. Highly interdependent technology 
solutions such as ERP are used by firms to enhance 
the efficiency and ease of in-house capabilities. 
The use of ERP is characterized by high levels of 
task interdependence (Sharma and Yetton 2003). 
To implement such highly complex and inter-
dependent systems is often a daunting process. 
Implementing an enterprise-wide application like 
an ERP system to help run a business is a costly 
and complex process and is like implementing a 
civil engineering endeavor or sizable construction 
project (Hawksworth 2007). A certain amount of 
planning, discipline and wisdom are required to 
complete implementation on schedule to meet the 
requirements of a firm. 
Many of the current ERP literature share imple-
mentation experiences from various companies. 
While some of them attempt to explain why the 
ERP implementation is difficult and what needs 
to be done to achieve desirable results, others 
present various models of implementation stages 
and different implementation methodologies 
(Moon, 2007). The contributions of this chapter 
to researchers and practitioners include:
a.	
Illustration of the implementation steps as 
followed by major corporations in the United 
States, and
b.	
Provision of an insight into the practical 
implementation issues, and
c.	
Introduction to a business case for ERP 
systems.
This chapter details the implementation issues 
of ERP systems and provides an insight into the 
practical aspects of such implementation. The next 
section provides seven ERP issues and elaborates 
these issues in the context of implementation. The 
following section describes ERP software and the 
ERP implementation scheme during conceptu-
alization, design, implementation, go-live, and 
operation stages of implementation. The chapter 
concludes with a note to practitioners on ERP 
implementation.

ERP is an enterprise software package.  With ERP, 
it is possible to keep track any transaction in an 
enterprise in real-time.  ERP allows managers to 
process business information more effectively to 
support sound decision making. ERP solutions 
cover all of the core operations necessary to run 
successful small and midsize businesses, includ-
ing accounting and banking, customer and vendor 
management, purchasing and sales, logistics and 
production, as well as reporting and analysis. 
The benefits of ERP systems have been 
researched extensively in literature. Gefen and 
Ragowsky (2007) examined associations between 
the business characteristics of manufacturing 
firms and their perceived benefits from ERP sys-
tem investments at both enterprise and a specific 
IT module level and found that the perceived 
value for ERP investments was consistently 
better explained at the specific IT module level. 
Ranganathan and Brown (2006) found that ERP 

  247
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation
projects with greater functional scope (two or 
more value-chain modules) or greater physical 
scope (multiple sites) result in positive, higher 
shareholder returns. ERP systems replace com-
plex and sometimes manual interfaces between 
different systems with standardized, cross-func-
tional transaction automation (Hendricks et al., 
2005). Information integration using ERP can 
replace functionally oriented and often poorly 
connected legacy software, resulting in savings 
in infrastructure support costs (Hendricks et al., 
2005). Other business benefits include:
•	
Improved productivity: ERP engages 
and connects users within and beyond the 
enterprise, including customers, suppliers, 
and partners. An intuitive, role-based portal 
environment gives the system wide access 
to a single, consistent view of the business. 
Higher levels of efficiency and collaboration 
may be achieved and as a result firms can 
respond to new competitive threats, and 
proactively meet customer needs. 
•	
Increased insight: ERP improves deci-
sion-making by giving managers a clear 
understanding of activities across functions. 
They can retrieve the right information at the 
right time to address problems and pursue 
new opportunities. 
•	
Enhanced governance: ERP provides 
comprehensive functionality for corporate 
governance, enabling the firm to comply 
with Sarbanes-Oxley and International 
Accounting Standards. ERP also integrates 
corporate reporting, analysis, and compli-
ance with underlying business processes 
and transaction systems. 
•	
Improved flexibility: ERP provides a scal-
able and adaptable solution that seamlessly 
integrates end-to-end processes with the 
ability to add other external solutions that 
may include customer relationship man-
agement, supply chain management, and 
product life-cycle management. 
•	
Reduced costs: ERP enables firms to man-
age IT costs by leveraging the investments 
they have already made. 
•	
Increased visibility: ERP solutions provide 
real-time visibility across the entire enter-
prise, so firms can streamline their supply 
chain, bring products to market faster, get 
more out of procurement, and eliminate 
duplication of effort. 
ER
MPLEMENTATIOmplemenaonue
Companies that install ERP do not have an easy 
time of it. To implement ERP right, the ways that 
they do business need to change and the ways 
people do their jobs need to change too. And that 
kind of change does not come without pain. The 
important thing is not to focus on how long it 
will take but rather to understand why the firms 
need ERP and how they will use it to improve 
their business. C
Cost
Meta Group recently did a study looking at the total 
cost of ownership (TCO) of ERP, including hard-
ware, software, professional services and internal 
staff costs. The TCO numbers include getting the 
software installed and the two years afterward, 
which is when the real costs of maintaining, up-
grading and optimizing the system for business 
are felt. Among the 63 companies surveyed (Ketbi 
et al. 2002)—including small, medium and large 
companies in a range of industries—the aver-
age TCO was $15 million (the highest was $300 
million and lowest was $400,000). The nature 
of ERP implementations are such that there are 
usually unforeseen and unexpected occurrences 
that increase the overall costs (Al-Mudimigh et 
al., 2001). In summary, the cost of implementing 
ERP remains quite high (Wu et al., 2007).

248  
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation
S
The criticality of schedule and budget overruns as 
risk factors in ERP implementation projects has 
been rated to be high by all companies regardless 
of their size (Laukkanen, 2007). The time and ef-
fort to implement is likely to be underestimated 
in the case of implementing ERP systems. ERP 
systems come in modules and do not have to be 
implemented entirely at one time; many companies 
follow a phase-in approach in which one module 
is implemented at a time. Some of the most com-
monly installed modules are sales and distribution 
(SD), materials management (MM), production 
and planning, (PP), and finance and controlling 
(FI) modules. The average length of time for a 
“typical” implementation is more than a year and 
can use more than 150 consultants. Corning, Inc. 
rolled out ERP in ten of its diversified manufac-
turing divisions in five to eight years (Stedman 
1998). The length of implementation is affected 
to a great extent by the number of modules being 
implemented, the scope of the implementation 
(different functional units or across multiple 
units spread out globally), the extent of custom-
ization, and the number of interfaces with other 
applications. 
C tomization
ERP packages are very general in nature and need 
to be configured to a specific type of business. 
The customization is very tedious and takes a long 
time, depending on the specific requirements of the 
business. Customized development can provide a 
better fit with the operational procedures of a firm, 
yet often results in a system that is more risky 
to implement and more complicated to maintain 
and upgrade (Gebauer and Lee, 2008). An ERP 
system like SAP is so complex and general that 
there are more than 8000 switches that need to 
be set properly to make it handle the business 
processes in a way a company needs. The more 
customization needed, the longer it will take to roll 
out the software and the more it will cost to keep 
it up-to-date. The length of implementation time 
could be cut down by keeping the system “plain 
vanilla” and reducing the number of “bolt-on” ap-
plication packages that require custom interfaces 
with the ERP system. However, the downside 
to this “plain vanilla” approach may or may not 
completely match business requirements.
Some companies undertake costly custom-
izations to automate its processes on its ERP 
system—only to learn that the “plain-vanilla” 
version of the software performed certain func-
tions much better.  Companies even pull the plug 
partway into an ERP project because of functional 
or even philosophical problems. A technological 
mistake often made in SAP implementations, 
says Graham McFarlane, director of Western 
Management Consultants, is that organizations 
modify the software more than they should, 
rather than modifying their business processes 
(Hilson, 2001). The Military Sealift Command 
(MSC) successfully implemented Oracle’s ERP 
solution.  One rule they cite for achieving ERP 
success is that agencies must find an ERP package 
that mirrors their business practices as closely as 
possible, then resolve to implement the package 
without significant modifications.  MSC managers 
made a key decision to minimize the risk of ERP 
implementation by taking a “vanilla” approach. 
They committed to installing the software as it 
was packaged, without any modifications.  The 
MSC put together 1,000 requirements the optimal 
software would fulfill.  There were only 11 areas 
where their processes didn’t match the software 
and the commander made the decision to modify 
MSC processes to fit the Oracle software (Dean, 
2001). 
Management CommitmentC
Management commitment for information sys-
tems (IS) projects has been researched extensively 
(Aloini et al., 2007, Aladwani 2002, Ravichandran 
and Rai 2000). They found empirically that man-

  249
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation
agement commitment this work can make human, 
monetary, and other important resources avail-
able for the IS project leading to a conducive and 
superior problem solving environment as well as 
increase the likelihood of IS product quality and 
efficiency. Top management must consider the 
strategic implications of implementing an ERP 
solution (Davenport 1998). Management must 
also ask several questions before embarking on 
the project. Does the ERP system strengthen the 
company’s competitive position? How might it 
erode the company’s competitive position? How 
does ERP affect the organizational structure 
and the culture? What is the scope of the ERP 
implementation -- only a few functional units or 
the entire organization? Are there any alternatives 
that meet the company’s needs better than an ERP 
system? If it is a multinational corporation, the 
management should be concerned about whether 
it would be better to roll the system out globally 
or restrict it to certain regional units? Manage-
ment must be involved in every step of the ERP 
implementation. Handing over the ERP project to 
the IS department may result as a risk to the entire 
company’s survival because of the ERP system’s 
profound business implications. The top manage-
ment must not only fund the project but also take 
an active role in leading the change. The success 
of a major project like an ERP implementation 
completely hinges on the strong, sustained com-
mitment of top management. This commitment 
when percolated down through the organizational 
levels results in an overall organizational com-
mitment. An overall organizational commitment 
that is very visible, well defined, and felt is a sure 
way to ensure a successful implementation (Bingi 
et al., 1999). 
I
The system integration between existing infor-
mation systems and ERP system is a technical 
problem which might complicate the entire 
ERP project (Liang and Lien, 2007). Firms have 
amassed multiple software that are either legacy 
systems or current add-ons. Different functions of 
the company have bought or developed different 
applications and are used to the software. Figure 
1 illustrates before and after ERP implementation 
software integration in a business. Various func-
tions of the firm and possible software associated 
with each one of the functions and how ERP can 
be integrated with some of the software are shown 
in the figure. Some of this software can be replaced 
by the newly proposed system and some of them 
can be integrated into the software. The databases 
(DB) of individual software, for instance product 
data management (PDM) database, can be inte-
grated with ERP database as well. In this case, 
ERP serves as a backbone, and all the different 
software are bolted on to the ERP software. There 
is third-party software, middleware, which can 
be used to integrate software applications from 
several vendors to the ERP backbone. Middleware 
vendors concentrate only on the most popular 
packaged applications and tend to focus on the 
technical aspects of application interoperability 
rather than linking business processes. Many 
times, organizations have to develop their own 
interfaces for commercial software applications 
and the homegrown applications. Integration 
software also poses other kinds of problems when 
it comes to maintenance. It is a nightmare for 
information systems group to manage this soft-
ware whenever there are changes and upgrades 
to either ERP software or other software that is 
integrated with the ERP system. 
Until the end of 1996, for example, Dell 
Computer Corp. planned to roll out SAP’s full 
R/3 suite, but it stopped after implementing only 
the HR modules. Jerry Gregoire, who joined 
the company as CIO that year, saw that a single 
software monolith would not be able to keep pace 
with Dell’s extraordinary corporate growth—the 
company grows by a billion dollars every six to 
eight weeks. Instead Gregoire designed a flexible 
middleware architecture to allow the company to 
add or subtract applications quickly and selected 

250  
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation
software from a variety of vendors, including 
Glovia International LLC, to handle finance and 
manufacturing functions (Slater, 1999).R
Reengineering
Reengineering existing business processes to 
the best business process standard is one of the 
activities in ERP implementation. ERP systems 
are process oriented; therefore only in a process-
based organization they can completely express 
their integration potentiality (Guido and Pierluigi, 
2008). ERP systems are built on best practices that 
are followed in the industry. One major benefit 
of ERP comes from reengineering the company’s 
existing way of doing business. In this case, all 
the processes in a company conform to the ERP 
software and as a result the cost and benefits of 
aligning these processes with an ERP model could 
be very high. Since ERP systems such as SAP were 
built on a foundation of process best practices, it 
is probably easier and less expensive to change 
processes to adapt to SAP than the other way 
around. Many companies have reported good suc-
cess from combining a SAP implementation with 
a reengineering project (Bingi et al., 1999).  
The concept of reengineering traces its origins 
back to management theories developed as early 
as the nineteenth century. The purpose of reen-
gineering is to make all of a firm’s processes the 
best-in-class. In reengineering, there is one best 
way to conduct tasks. 
Initiatives like Business Process Reengineer-
ing (BPR) and ERP promise radical improvements 
in relatively short periods of time. Processes, 
organization, structure and information technolo-
gies are the key components of reengineering. 
In implementing ERP, both business processes 
and information technology are combined into 
integrated software. This automates business 
processes across the enterprise and provides 
an organization with a well designed and man-
aged information system. Companies like IBM, 
Texas Instruments, American Express, Johnson 
& Johnson, Chrysler, Ford, Shell oil and many 
others have achieved major reengineering suc-
cesses. Many organizations have successfully 
implemented ERP systems and reported huge 
benefits. Yet many research studies estimate that 
at least 90 % of ERP implementations end up late 
or over budget and several failure stories are cited 
(Jarrar et al., 2000).C

et al., 2007). The client, the management, must 
be involved in the consulting recruitment process. 
Simply trusting the consulting firm or not un-
derstanding what the consultants know is a risk. 
The more layers between the project manager and 
consulting company, the more the consultant’s 
rates are reduced means that the consultants are 
willing to work for the lower rate and are usually 
the least knowledgeable. S
SAP: ERP SORof
wae
SAP the company was founded in Germany in 
1972 by five ex-IBM engineers. SAP stands for 
Systeme, Andwendungen, Produkte in der Daten-
verarbeitung which - translated to English - means 
Systems, Applications, Products in Data Process-
ing. SAP AG is now the third largest software 
maker in the world, with over 17,500 customers 
(including more than half of the world’s 500 top 
companies). There are more than 50,000 instal-
lations of SAP, in over 120 countries, with more 
then 10 million users! SAP today is available in 
46 country-specific versions, incorporating 28 
languages including Kanji and other double-byte 
character languages. SAP R/3 is delivered to a 
customer with selected standard process turned 
on, and many other optional processes and features 
turned off. At the heart of SAP are about 10,000 
tables which control the way the processes are 
executed. Configuration is the process of adjusting 
the settings of these tables to get SAP to run the 
way companies want it to. Functionality included 
is truly enterprise wide including: Financial Ac-
counting (e.g. general ledger, accounts receivable 
etc), Management Accounting (e.g. cost centers, 
profitability analysis etc), Sales, Distribution, 
Manufacturing, Production Planning, Purchasing, 
Human Resources, Payroll, etc.  
SAP is an integrated client/server software ap-
plication.  The features of SAP are as follows:
•	
Centralized database (ORACLE)
•	
Planning functions like Material Resource 
Planning
•	
Reporting functions
•	
Business workflow to simulate the busi-
ness
•	
Development workbench that uses a lan-
guage called ABAP (Advanced Business 
Application Programming)
•

S P Database
The SAP repository or the data dictionary serves 
primarily as a tool to enter, manage, delete and 
evaluate company information.  The rules for 
structuring this information are consistent with 
the concepts of the relational data model using 
tables and fields.  The data repository is active at 
all times and therefore the information is always 
up-to-date and available to all authorized users at 
all times.  The SAP repository is built on a table 
structure.  A database most often contains one 
or more tables. Each table is identified by a name 
(e.g. “Customers” or “Orders”). Tables contain 
records (rows) with data. As shown the Figure 
2, there are four different tables for configura-
tion, control, master data and transaction data. 
System configuration tables are tables that define 
the structure of a system.  An example of this 
type of table is one that defines the peripherals 
such as printers.  To customize the system, the 
other three tables are used. Control tables define 
functions that guide the users their activities.  For 
example, a control table might be designed such 
that a material master data is entered before a 
purchase order is accepted.  Control tables con-
tain the structure or the process of the company. 
These tables contain data such as which plants are 
related which products, which sales organizations 
are related which products, etc. Master data tables 
define customers, vendors, materials, equipment, 
etc.  Customer master data might include customer 
name, address, contact information, etc. This 
table might also be related to other tables that 
represent the location of warehouse or repair shops 
that support the customer. Transaction data table 
represents the daily operations data such as sales 
orders, invoices and shipments. SAP modules are 
shown in Figure 3.

more.  As a result of the cost and time involved 
with the ERP implementation, a business case is 
needed.  The thought process of IT department 
in many of the organizations can be generalized 
as below in Figure 4 (Norris et al. 1998). Figure 4 
shows the four main components in this thought 
process.  Information is gathered to be consumed 
and this information is managed by applications. 
The applications have to be created and managed 
by technology. Technology has to be managed by 
IT organization with its roles and responsibilities, 
and governance. As Norris et al. (1998) points out 
IT organizations need to answer the following 
questions on information:
1.	
What is the information?
2.	
Where does this information come from?
3.	
How do we create information from data?
4.	
How does information get distributed?
5.	
How does information get consumed?
The answers the above questions lead to the 
software applications.  This is the level that us-
ers of IT and developers of IT deal with most of 
the time.  Here the following questions need to 
be answered:
1.	
What applications does the company cur-
rently use to collect, collate, compute, and 
transform to useful information, store, 
distribute, and retrieve data?
2.	
Is there a better application software avail-
able to carry out these tasks in a more ef-
ficient, less time-consuming, less resource-
consuming and less expensive way?
3.	
Is there software available as Complete-Off-
The-Shelf (COTS)?
4.	
By using this software, could the company 
redirect resources into other areas of the busi-
ness in which it can establish and maintain 
competitive advantage?
Then the decision on hardware begins es-
pecially on technology platforms, techniques, 
servers, tools, etc.  Each company has a different 
perspective on each one of these objects.  For 
example, SAP is platform independent and has 
as a company provided an open-architecture 
presence which is an advantage for corporations. 
Finally, the questions to be answered for the IT 
organization are as follows:
1.	
What management principles will govern 
IT organization?
2.	
What processes for system development, 
operations, support and maintenance are 
used?
3.	
What are the roles and responsibilities of 
all the individuals in the organization?

4.	
What is the relationship as in power structure 
between the IT organization and the business 
units?
This thought process need to be followed before 
the implementation of SAP which will ensure 
smooth implementation.  Once an IT strategy 
has been developed, and once an ERP solution 
is determined to be right, a company is ready to 
build a business case.  Business case involves 
analysis of cost and benefits and determining the 
payback period for the expenses incurred for the 
implementation and getting the approvals from 
leadership.  
Norris et al. (1998) shows how the complexity 
of the implementation, as well as the project risk 
and cost, increases as a company moves out on 
the continuum of the degree of business process 
change and up along the continuum of organiza-
tional change.  As the level of business process 
change is increased, the level of organizational 
change necessary to carry it out must also increase. 
The key to successful implementation is assertive 
control over the project’s scope and over the degree 
of business process changes to be undertaken. 
Clear objectives and justification (Weston, 2001), 
evaluation and selection (Van Everdingen et al., 
2000), alignment between the ERP package and 
business strategies and requirements (Somers 
and Nelson, 2003) as part of the business case are 
critical to the success of implementation. To build 
a cost-based business case for ERP, firms need to 
extract savings that depend on ERP alone from 
the total savings to be had from ERP together 
with other sources. Wagle (1998) proposed five 
steps that include:
1.	
Create a base case of year-by-year savings 
from cost cuts that could be made without 
the ERP system in place.
2.	
Create an ERP case of year-by-year savings 
that could be made with ERP. This should 
include savings that do not depend on ERP 
as well as those that do. 
3.	
Subtract the base-case savings (step 1) from 
the ERP-case savings (step 2) on a year-by-
year basis, and calculate the net present value 
(NPV) of the residual cash flow. A positive 
NPV will indicate that the firm should prob-
ably proceed with the deployment of ERP.
4.	
If step 3 produces a positive NPV, conduct 
a sensitivity analysis to ensure that the 
business case is strong enough to withstand 
slippage and cost overruns. 
5.	
Back-allocate all ERP system deployment 
costs to individual business units so that they 
can factor them into their planning. Ensure 
each unit is held responsible for producing 
the promised savings.
To summarize, the following factors need to 
be considered for the business case:
1.	
The decision must be driven by the business 
considerations, not merely the desire for new 
technology
2.	
Firms need to extract savings that depend 
on ERP alone from the total savings to be 
had from ERP together with other sources
3.	
ERP system will not solve business process 
and organizational dynamic problems.  
4.	
ERP implementation cannot be delayed 
until the company is able to use to its fullest 
ability.S
SAP IMPLEMENTATIONmplemenaonep
Botta-Genoulaz et al. (2005) in their survey of 
research literature note that recent research is on 
ERP post-implementation issues, customization of 
ERP projects, and the sociological issues of ERP 
systems, and return on investment of ERP systems. 
Implementation should depend on the size of the 
company (Mabert et al., 2003) and industrial sec-
tor (Wu and Wang, 2003). The roadmap to ERP 
or SAP is shown in the figure 5.  The roadmap 
consists of five key functions that include:

  255
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation
•	
Project Preparation
•	
Business Blueprint
•	
Realization
•	
Final Preparation
•	
Go Live and Support
Each one of these functionalities has various 
steps.  The following figure shows the implementa-
tion steps for enterprise software.  The design and 
implementation phase consists of the following 
functionalities:
•	
Establishing hardware and SAP settings
•	
Establishing the key master data
•	
Establishing the processes and functions 
inside the organization
•	
Implementing Reports, Interfaces, Conver-
sions and Enhancements (RICE)
•	
Testing the system
•	
Training the users
•	
Go-Live
•	
Post production maintenance and support
The reason that ERP system implementations 
are time-consuming and costly is because of 
the complex nature of the implementation and 
the dynamics of the implementation involving 
with the organization. The basic functionalities 
described above may be expanded and is shown 
in Table 1. 
Project Preparation
The purpose of this activity is to start detailed 
planning for the project. There are many basic 
issues to resolve at this early stage to ensure the 
project’s success.  The principal elements that 
determine how the ERP project is accomplished 
will be established in this phase. These activi-
ties set the groundwork for project kickoff, and 
provide a baseline of information to be referenced 
throughout the implementation. For all project 
team members to operate in an effective man-
ner, it is necessary that project standards and 
procedures are established at the beginning of 
the project, and then communicated to all team 
members. Project planning is an ongoing cycle 
and should be constantly refined. Even when the 
project plan is created, it must be made clear that

project planning is a continual, rolling process. As 
the project progresses, fewer revisions are neces-
sary. In the SAP Business-to-Business Procure-
ment system, requirement coverage requests for 
non-production materials or services are directly 
processed further, and purchase orders are placed. 
If data is missing for purchase orders, the Materi-
als Management functions are used to complete 
them. The follow-on documents for the purchase 
orders are also created in the SAP Business-to-
Business Procurement system (confirmation, 
goods receipt / service entry and invoice). This 
phase also includes defining end user training and 
documentation strategy. This includes analyzing 
and developing the training and documentation 
strategy with the overall implementation strategy 
and project plan.
The results of this activity are:
•	
Project Plan (Work Plan, Budget Plan, Re-
source Plan).
•	
Project management standards and proce-
dures.
•

Blueprint documents the business process require-
ments of the company. This phase also establishes 
a proper cycle of project management activities to 
ensure that the implementation project is on target. 
It determines all project planning, controlling and 
updating activities. It also identifies where changes 
in the relationship between business processes and 

258  
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation
the organizational structure need to be managed, 
in consultation with departmental management. 
The same work package is also in the subsequent 
phases. It is also defined now what content the 
customer needs, what user populations and needs 
that content will serve, and how the content will 
be structured. Also, definitions of enhancement 
contexts that customers need to create and main-
tain their own materials are completed. In general, 
the idea is to start with a single context and then 
create additional contexts based on the first one. 
The relationships between enhancement contexts 
are called enhancement chains.  Description of 
processes and sub-processes that are particular to 
the following business processes such as training 
management, performance assessment, and web 
content management are also completed in this 
phase. At this time, all user master records with 
roles and responsibilities along with authorizations 
for the project team members are also created.
The business process definitions create the 
Business Blueprint. In case of a rollout most of 
the company requirements should already be 
determined and mapped to the corresponding 
ERP software settings. The Business Blueprint 
serves as the conceptual master plan, and eventu-
ally becomes a detailed written document. This 
document shows the business requirements in 
detail, and serves as the basis for organization, 
configuration and, if necessary, development 
activities. End User Requirements Document, 
Current Data Warehouse and Information Access 
Environment Document, Master Data/Transac-
tion Data Requirements Document, Data Map-
ping Document, Data Access Recommendations 
Document, and Data Management Requirements 
Document are also completed.
The outputs of this activity are:
•	
Regularly scheduled project status meet-
ings 
•	
Updated Project Plan 
•	
Definition of end user roles and responsibili-
ties 
•	
Quality Reviews 
•	
Content Requirements document, which 
identifies user populations, existing informa-
tion, and new information requirements.

Realization
The purpose of this phase is to implement business 
and process requirements based on the Business 
Blueprint. The objectives are final implementation 
in the system, an overall test, and the release of 
the system for production (live) operation. The 
project team also receives relevant knowledge. 
All testing is completed in order to implement 
the completely functional system
Reul
The outputs of this activity are:
•	
Implementation of all necessary enhance-
ment contexts, enhancement releases, and 
enhancement context chains
•	
The data extraction is configured. 
•	
Configured and tested ERP system.
•	
Tested programs to migrate into the QA 
environment
•	
ERP system meets the business application 
requirements as defined in the Business 
Blueprint.
Project Final Preparation
The purpose of this phase is to perform the estab-
lished cycle of project management activities to 

  259
Enterprise Resource Systems Software Implementation
keep the implementation project on target. This 
determines all project planning, controlling and 
updating activities, and identifies changes between 
business processes and the organizational struc-
ture. Project management and consulting manage-
ment must work closely together to guarantee that 
the project stays on schedule. Also, technical and 
performance tests will be conducted to verify that 
the production environment is ready and can be 
supported for productive operation.  These tests 
should be performed in the actual production 
environment or in an environment that closely 
represents the actual environment. At this time, 
the move from a pre-production environment to 
live production operation will be done. In addition, 
it is important to monitor system transactions and 
overall performance. During the process of going 
live, there are two critical periods. In the first 
few days, the team must execute the production 
support plan and check the results. Any issues or 
problems that occur in this period must be resolved 
as quickly as possible. Following the first few 
days of live operation, monitoring issues for the 
long term, particularly with reference to system 
performance, capacity and functions should be 
addressed.
The results of this activity are:
•	
All roles and responsibilities defined with 
proper backups in place 
•	
All procedures and responsibilities docu-
mented and signed off
•	
The entire technical infrastructure is tested 
and validated, including failure scenarios 
and disaster recovery.
•	
The configuration of the system and the 
procedures defined for the technical envi-
ronment are tested and validated. 
•	
A stress test is carried out successfully. Its 
result determines the validity of the planned 
go-live date.
•	
All ERP system aspects and support orga-
nization is approved, and the production 
system is released.
•	
The output of this activity is the formal 
sign-off of Phase 4.
Conluon
A brief ERP implementation procedure using the 
SAP implementation documentation as well as is-
sues regarding ERP implementations are detailed 
in this chapter. ERP implementations in the recent 
years have raised a number of questions regarding 
its success.  Many companies regard ERP as their 
one and only savior and many others despise that 
ERP as a single system has brought them to their 
knees.  Regardless, many more companies, small 
to medium size companies in particular, are begin-
ning to invest in ERP.  An industrial practitioner 
from such small to medium companies needs to 
understand how to implement ERP. This study 
provides the necessary tools and background for 
the industrial practitioner to implement not only 
ERP systems but implement the next generation 
of enterprise applications as well.

Abstracta
This chapter considers the importance of business modelling for implementing e-CRM systems. The in-
troduction of e-business models requires the adaptation of the Marketing Information System the specific 
characteristics of the online environment. The representation of various components of the Marketing 
Information System, and of the flows of information among various organizational departments, rep-
resents an essential step for the successful implementation of e-CRM systems. Considering the specific 
requirements of this restructuring process, chapter presents the advantages of the Eriksson-Penker Busi-
ness Extensions of the Unifying Modeling Language (UML), and exemplifies their use for modeling the 
Marketing Information System during the implementation of an interactive e-CRM approach.
Inoduon
The development and introduction of new infor-
mation technology applications and marketing 
paradigms are forcing business organisations to 
continuously evaluate and restructure their Mar-
keting Information System (MIS). However, the 
complexity of the MIS and its connections with 
various organisational departments, functions 
and processes, creates important challenges for 
the restructuring process. From this perspective, 
the application of a business modeling approach 
represents an essential pre-requisite for identify-
ing the MIS components that need to be adapted to 
the new competitive conditions and for represent-
ing their future integration in the organisational 
architecture. This chapter presents the advantages 
of the Eriksson-Penker Business Extensions 
of the Uni. ed Modeling Language (UML), and 
exemplifies their use for modeling the Marketing

Restructuring the Marketing Information System for eCRM
Information System during the implementation 
of an interactive eCRM approach.
Bagound
The opportunities provided by the rapidly evolv-
ing online markets have determined many firms 
to initiate e-business operations. However, the 
success of these initiatives is determined by 
capacity of enterprises to properly understand 
the specificity of the Internet, and to restructure 
their Marketing Information Systems in order to 
develop a competitive advantage. In this context, 
the eCRM systems represent interesting solutions 
for adopting a customer-centric approach and for 
increasing the online value propositions (Jay-
achandran, Sharma, Kaufman, & Raman 2005; 
Payne, & Frow 2005; Srinivasan, & Moorman 
2005). Value maximisation happens when firms 
and customers engage in long-term relationships 
(Vargo, & Lusch 2004), co-creating personalised 
value (Prahalad, & Ramaswamy 2004), based on 
information exchange and close collaboration in 
all the stages of product R&D, manufacturing 
and commercialisation. 
The eCRM system comprises a number of 
business processes, inter-linked in a logical suc-
cession:
•	
Market segmentation: the collection of his-
torical data, complemented with information 
provided by third parties (such as marketing 
research agencies), is segmented on the basis 
of customer life-time value (CLV) criteria, 
using data mining applications.
•	
Capturing the customer: the potential cus-
tomer is attracted to the web site of the firm 
through targeted promotional messages, 
diffused through various communication 
channels.
• 	
Customer information retrieval: The infor-
mation retrieval process can be either implicit 
or explicit. When implicit, the information 
retrieval process registers the web behaviour 
of customers, using specialized software 
applications, such as ‘cookies’. On the other 
hand, explicit information can be gathered 
through direct input of demographic data 
by the customer (using online registration 
forms or questionnaires). Often, these two 
categories of information are connected at 
database level.
• 	
Customer Profile definition: the customer 
information collected is analyzed in relation 
with the target market segments identified 
through data mining, and a particular cus-
tomer profile is defined. The profile can be 
enriched with additional data, e.g. external 
information from marketing information 
providers. This combination creates a 
holistic view of the customer, its needs, 
wants, interests and behaviors (Pan, & Lee, 
2003).
• 	
Personalization of firm-customer interac-
tion: the customer profile is used to identify 
the best customer management campaign 
(CMC), which is applied to personalize the 
company-customer online interaction. 
• 	
Resource management: the company-cus-
tomer transaction require complex resource 
management operations, which are partially 
managed automatically, through special-
ized IT-applications such as Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) or Supply Chain 
Management (SCM), and partly through 
the direct involvement and co-ordination 
of operational managers.

The effective functioning of the eCRM system 
requires a gradual process of planning, design and 
implementation, which can be greatly enhanced 
through business modeling.  The selection of an 
appropriate business modeling language is es-
sential for the successful implementation of the 
eCRM system, and consequently, for evaluating 
and improving its performance (Kotorov, 2002). 
The starting point for this selection is an analysis 

264  
Restructuring the Marketing Information System for eCRM
of the specific characteristics and requirements of 
the eCRM system (Opdahl, & Henderson-Sellers, 
2004; Chen, & Chen, 2004):
• 	
eCRM is an Internet-based system, therefore 
the modeling language should be able to 
represent web processes and applications;
• 	
the interactive nature of eCRM systems 
requires a clear representation of the inter-
action between customers and web applica-
tions, as well as between various business 
processes within the organisation;
• 	
eCRM systems are using databases which 
interact with software applications; the mod-
eling language should support data modeling 
profiles and database representation;
• 	
the necessity for resource planning and con-
trol requires a clear representation of each 
business process with its inputs, outputs, 
resources and control mechanisms;
• 	
the implementation and management of 
an eCRM system requires the long-term 
collaboration of various specialists, such 
as business and operational managers, 
programmers and web designers, which are 
sometimes working from distant locations; 
the modeling language should provide a 
standard, intuitive representation of the 
eCRM system and business processes, in 
order to facilitate cross-discipline interac-
tion and collaboration;
• 	
the complexity of the eCRM system requires 
a modeling language capable to present 
both the organisational and the functional 
architecture, at the level of system, process, 
software applications and resources; this will 
facilitate a multi-user, multi-purpose use of 
the same business model, although the detail 
of representation might differ depending on 
the required perspective. 
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is 
well suited to the demands of the online environ-
ment. It has an object-oriented approach, and was 
designed to support distributed, concurrent, and 
connected models (Bennett, McRobb, & Farmer, 
2005; Rumbaugh, Jacobson, & Booch, 2004). The 
UML extension for representing business pro-
cesses, proposed by Eriksson and Penker (2000), 
is the notation presented in this paper to support 
the business process modeling activity. 
The
IFIEDnfed Modelng
Language (UML)
The UML was developed in 1995 by Grady Booch, 
Ivar Jacobson, and Jim Rumbaugh at Rational 
Corporation (Rittgen, 2006; Rumbaugh et al., 
2004), with contributions from other leading 
methodologists, software vendors, and users. 
Rational Corporation chose to develop UML 
as a standard through the Object Management 
Group (OMG). The resulting co-operative effort 
with numerous companies led to a specification 
adopted by OMG in 1997. 
UML has a number of specific advantages:
•	
Simplicity of notation: The notation set is 
simple and intuitive.
•	
Standard: The UML standard achieved 
through the OMG gives confidence to mod-
ellers.
•	
Support: A significant level of support is 
available to modellers in using the UML:
°	
text books that describe the UML nota-
tion and consider specific application 
areas.
°	
papers in journals and publications/
resources on the Internet spread 
knowledge of the UML (e.g. Rational 
Resource Center and UML Zone).
°	
software tools, often referred to as 
Computer Aided Software Engineer-
ing (CASE) tools are available. 
•	
Uptake: The UML notation answers a real 
need, favorising its adoption by specialists. 
The more the UML is used, the wider the 
knowledge pool becomes, which leads to a 
wider dissemination of information concern-
ing the benefits of its use.

  265
Restructuring the Marketing Information System for eCRM
•	
Methodologies: The development of meth-
ods or methodologies that provide support 
and guidelines of how to use the UML in a 
particular situation is widespread. A prime 
example is the Rational Unified Process 
(Jonkers, Lankhorst, Van Buuren, Hop-
penbrouwers, Bonsangue, & Van der Torre, 
2004).
•	
Extensibility: The UML has a number of 
standard extension mechanisms to make the 
notation flexible: stereotypes, tagged values 
and constraints (Kulak, & Guiney, 2003). 
•	
Living Language: The UML notations and 
standards is constantly developing, though 
in a controlled manner. The OMG works 
with representatives from various compa-
nies to clarify and address problems in the 
UML specification as well as considering 
recommendations for extensions to the 
language.
The UML is used to model a broad range of 
systems (software systems, hardware systems, 
databases, real-time systems and real-world or-
ganisations). By sharing a common notation across 
system and business boundaries, business and sys-
tem analysts can better communicate their needs, 
being able to build a system that effectively solves 
customers’ problems. For modelling purposes, 
UML proposes nine types of diagrams: class 
diagrams, object diagrams, state chart diagrams, 
activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, collabo-
ration diagrams, use case diagrams, component 
diagrams and deployment diagrams
In addition, UML is developing in three main 
directions that are of interest for this paper:
•	
Data Modeling: Databases represent an es-
sential component of almost all e-business 
applications, including CRM. Programming 
databases is often a difficult part of complex 
system development, because each data-
base may use a different method to declare 
data structure. UML has addressed this 
problem by introducing a Data Modeling 
profile, which includes an additional set of 
notations to capture the data modeling and 
database connectivity aspects (Naiburg, & 
Maksimchuk, 2003; Bennett et al., 2005).
•	
WWW System Modeling: The develop-
ment of Internet business systems has lead 
to an extension of UML for modeling web 
based systems. This capability is provided 
as an UML profile that enables modellers to 
represent various elements that compose a 
Web application – client pages, server pages, 
forms, frames, etc. (Zanoni, & Audy, 2004). 
•	
Business Process Modeling: Important 
extensions to UML notations describe the 
processes, goals, and rules of business (Er-
iksson and Penker, 2000; Rittgen, 2006).

Extension mechanisms—stereotypes, tagged 
values and constraints—are provided by the 
UML, allowing users to customise and extend 
the language in order to suit their particular 
needs. The UML specification also contains an 
UML extension for business modeling, which 
briefly describes possible extensions for business 
modelling, although no clear rules are provided 
regarding their application. Because of this lack 
of support for business modeling, a number of 
propositions have been made in order to provide 
additional UML extensions (Kim, 2004). The 
Eriksson-Penker Business Extensions are one 
of these propositions, which merge the UML with 
processes modeling, adapting the basic UML 
activity diagram and introducing a so-called 
process diagram (Noran, 2001). Table 1 describes 
the notation used in this section. 
An example of an Eriksson-Penker method 
for representing a process is shown in Figure 1. 
The diagram represents a process and the objects 
involved in that process. The process is triggered 
by an event and outputs a further resource. The 
use of the UML stereotype notation clarifies the 
role of each object (e.g. <<goal>>, <<infor-

266  
Restructuring the Marketing Information System for eCRM
mation>>) and association (e.g. <<achieve>>, 
<<supply>>), as necessary. The direction of 
associations clearly show the input and output 
relationship that objects have with the given 
process symbol.
Using the Eriksson-Penker method, the imple-
mentation of an eCRM system will be further 
presented and analysed. The process is common 
for every type of e-business, and the diagrams 
presented can be used as business modeling 
frameworks by any Internet-based organisation. 
On the other hand, in order to keep the model 
simple and easy to understand, the diagrams only 
show the major business processes involved in the 
system. The development of these diagrams to 
include more specific and detailed processes can 
be done by every business organisation, depending 
on its specific goals, structure and strategy.
The business process diagram also allows a 
detailed representation of the way in which a given 
business process is implemented in a system. Us-
ing an implementation diagram, use cases, pack-
ages, and other model artefacts may be linked back 
to the business process with <<implementa-
tion>> links to signify a dependent relationship 
(Kulak, & Guiney, 2003). The example provided

Table 1. Summary of UML Notation used in this paper

Restructuring the Marketing Information System for eCRM
in Figure 2 illustrates how a Business Process is 
implemented by a Use Case and a package. As 
the model develops and the functional software 
components are built and linked to Use Cases, 
the business justification for each element can be 
derived from this representation.
To increase the accuracy of the representation, 
the model presented in Figure 2 also implies what 
is not being delivered. As the Business Process 
will typically include a wide range of manual 
and automated procedures, this model illustrates 
exactly what functionality (Use Cases) needs to 
be provided to service a particular business pro-
cess; on the other hand, any missing functionality 
must be outsourced from other systems and/or 
procedures.
Using UML notations, the main business 
processes involved in eCRM systems can be 
represented as follows:
eCRMCR Process 1: SSegmenting 
the Market 
In order to segment the market, the firm needs 
to collect data about its customers. This can be 
done either through online automated systems that 
register the history of customer-firm interaction 
(historical data) and/or buying the necessary data 
from a third party (usually a specialised market 
research agency). These data will be usually lo-
cated in databases. Applying the CLV method, 
and using the segmentation criteria established 
by marketing managers, the collected data can be 
automatically processed using data mining appli-
cations such as pattern recognition and clustering. 
The output will represent a database of various 
customer segments, which have different lifetime 
values (value segmentation) and therefore present 
different levels of priority for the firm (Rosset, 
Neumann, Eick, & Vatnik, 2003).
eCRMCR Process 2: Capturing the C
C stomer (Figure 3)
This process is not represented in this paper 
since it implies a multiple channel strategy and 
interaction. The customers can be attracted to the 
company’s web site either through promotional 
messages, or through word-of-mouth referrals. 
The access to the company web site will be made 
using various intermediaries (such as search 
engines or company directories) and web applica-
tions (such as hiperlinks).

Information Retrieval (Figure 4)R
The customer information retrieval process will 
be usually initiated by the customer’s request for a 
product or service (<<event>>). The information 
retrieval can be implicit (using web tracking ap-
plications), or explicit (using ‘information request’ 
web pages). The retrieved information is collected 
into a specific customer database account.
eCRM Process 4: Customer Profile

The information contained in the customer data 
account is analysed and compared with the 
customer segments identified in the market seg-
mentation stage, and a specific customer profile is 
defined. In order to refine this profile, additional 
information can be outsourced from specialised 
marketing agencies.

eCRMCR Process: Personalised C
Customer-Firm TrTansaction 
(Figure 6)
To increase the loyalty of the most profitable 
customers, the company needs to design and 
implement customised e-marketing strategies 
(Tan, Yen, & Fang, 2002). 
The customer profile defined in the previous 
stage will be matched with the most effective 
customer campaign applications, determining 
the personalization of company-customer interac-
tions. The completed transaction results in profits 
for the firm, increased satisfaction for customer, 
as well as information, which is integrated in the 
transaction history of that particular customer.
eCR
Process 6: Resource R
Management 
This particular process involves complex interac-
tions between operational managers, the company, 
and the firm’s network of suppliers. The model-
ing of this business process requires advanced 
network modeling procedures. UML can be used 
efficiently to represent the networked interactions 
between the firm and external suppliers, being 
a distributed and highly standardized modeling 
language.T
The Integration of BuIBsiness 
Processes in the eCRMCR System S
(Figure 7)
Figure 7 presents four main business processes 
integrated into the eCRM system. The model 
shows how the outputs of one stage represent the 
inputs for the next stage. The resulting histori-
cal data at the end of the process closes the loop, 
and restarts the process for a better tuning of 
company’s activities to customers’ needs. 
Although only two of the represented business 
processes are visible to the online customer, the 
whole eCRM system uses software programmes 
and applications, which are either Internet-based 
or are interacting closely with web processes. 
Additional representation details can be included 
in the model, depending on the end-user orienta-
tion.

Restructuring the Marketing Information System for eCRM
eCRM applications requires a preliminary effort 
of business analysis, planning and modeling. 
The choice of an appropriate modeling language 
is a necessary and essential step within this 
process.
This paper attempted to present the manifold 
utility of the Eriksson-Penker Extensions for 
UML Business Modeling, which is advocated by 
many authors (Castela, N., Tribolet, J., Silva, A., 
& Guerra, A., 2001; Kim, 2004; Noran, 2001). 
Although these extensions are not presently a 
part of the official UML (OMG) Metamodel, the 
Erikson-Penker method can be used to represent 
the workflow processes within the organisation, 
especially the flow of information, which is es-
sential for online businesses (Lin, Yang, & Pai, 
2002). 
On the other hand, UML offers a complete 
semantics for database design, and can provide 
a powerful neutral platform for designing data-

base architecture and data profiling, especially 
in the case of multi-user databases (Naiburg, & 
Maksimchuk, 2003). UML can be used to repre-
sent the interaction between the digital company 
and different types of customers, helping the op-
erational managers to identify the areas/activities 
of value creation and those of value destruction 
(Kim, 2004). 
UML provides the basis for designing and 
implementing suitable information systems that 
support the business operations. The use of UML 
both for software description and for business 
modeling offers the possibility to map large sec-
tions of the business model directly into software 
objects (Field, Heim, & Sinha, 2004). UML can 
provide a protocol neutral modeling language to 
design the interface between co-operating virtual 
organisations (Kotorov, 2002; Tan et al., 2002). 
The capacity of the UML to provide a com-
mon platform for representing both web processes 
and organisational architecture, offers a unifying 
tool for the multi-disciplinary team that designs, 
implements and controls the eCRM system (Ben-
nett et al., 2005).
The business modeling exercise should be 
based on an analytical and modular approach. 
The implementation and functioning of the eCRM 
system must be represented stage by stage, taking 
however into account the final integration into a 
complete, functional system, as it was presented 
in this paper.

Electronic Customer Relationship Manage-
ment (eCRM): CRM comprises the methods, 
systems and procedures that facilitate the inter-
action between the firm and its customers. The 
development of new technologies, especially the 
proliferation of self-service channels like the web 
and wap phones, has changed consumer buying 
behaviour and forced the companies to manage 
electronically the relationships with customers. 
The new CRM systems are using electronic de-

Abstracta
At the present moment, many hospitals are going through a process of change directed at the integrated 
delivery of health care. Enterprise Systems (ES) are increasingly used to support this process and to 
manage hospitals on a coherent basis. We also know, however, that ES implementation itself, can be 
viewed as an organizational change process that affects many stakeholders. For that reason it is relevant 
to study how ES implementation takes place within hospitals and how it tends to impact the existing 
organizational arrangements. The purpose of this chapter is therefore to describe and analyze how ES 
implementation within a hospital affects the interests of stakeholders and which specific problems may 
arise as a result. This chapter uses the evidence of a case study to reveal some important dimensions of 
the organizational change issues related to ES implementation within hospitals. 
ITRCTI
Many hospitals are going through a process in 
which they are changing from loosely coupled 
units into more integrated entities. Hospital man-
agers are increasingly accountable for the cost-ef-
fectiveness and the quality of their organizations, 
which explains their need for more integration and 
control. To achieve this, the managers are look-
ing for information systems that can help them 
to manage their hospitals on an integrated basis 
(Merode, van et al, 2004). This is why in recent 
years many hospitals have started to implement 
enterprise systems (Jossie et al., 2005). Enterprise 
systems are software packages that facilitate the 
integration of transactions-oriented data and 
business processes throughout an organization 
(Klaus et al., 2000). Traditionally, enterprise 

  275
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
systems are used in manufacturing, which dif-
fers in many respects from a hospital context. 
It is therefore relevant to describe and analyze 
how ES implementation within hospitals takes 
place and which specific problems are faced by 
the implementers and managers. 
In this chapter we will describe and analyze 
the implementation of an enterprise system in a 
medium-sized hospital in The Netherlands. We 
will analyze this implementation by focusing on 
the roles of the various stakeholders involved, 
the meaning that they attach to the system, and 
the actions they take throughout the project. We 
have chosen this perspective because stakehold-
ers involved in hospitals differ significantly from 
those involved in other industries. This chapter 
aims to provide insight into the role that the dif-
ferent stakeholders involved in hospitals may play 
during ES-implementations. Understanding the 
possible impact of ES on particular stakeholder 
interests may help project managers and others 
to manage ES implementation within hospitals 
in a more effective way. 
There are only few descriptive accounts of 
how groups and individuals related to hospitals 
interpret IS proposals in general and ES systems 
in particular, and how they respond subsequently 
(Levine et al., 1995). Especially empirical case 
studies that focus on the role of politics and stake-
holders in relation to ES implementation within 
hospitals are scarce. As a result, our insight into 
the role of stakeholders in the implementation of 
IS applications within hospitals in general and that 
of ES applications in particular is limited. This 
means that we have a lack of understanding of 
why groups and individuals act in the way they 
do. Knowledge of barriers to implementation and 
approaches to analyze them is of importance to 
practitioners, such as project managers, who are 
involved in implementing ES within hospitals, and 
hospital managers, who have to decide whether 
to implement ES.
The chapter is organized as follows. In the next 
section we will explain the distinctive features 
of enterprise systems and describe theory and 
models that the research has been based on, which 
may help us understand the relevance of studying 
enterprise systems in health care environments. 
After that, we will describe the methodological 
background of the research. The following section 
presents the case study and then an interpretation 
will be given of this case study on the basis of 
the model. In the final section we will put the 
study in a broader perspective and put forward 
some views about the practical implications for 
managers responsible for ES implementations 
within hospitals.
BCKR
Enterprise systems are software applications 
aimed at integrating a range of business func-
tions in order to acquire an overview of the 
business based on a single information archi-
tecture (Merode, van., 2004). Starting from 
manufacturing and financial systems, enterprise 
systems may eventually allow the integration of 
inter-organizational supply chains (Markus et al., 
2000; Fowler et al., 2003). Enterprise systems are 
multi-functional and cover a range of activities, 
such as logistics, human resources and finance. 
These functions are integrated in such a way 
that whenever data are entered into one of these 
functions, they become available to all related 
functions. Enterprise systems are modular and 
can be used in many combinations of modules. 
They link the different organizational units by 
coordinating the business processes.   
Because these systems affect so many aspects 
of an organization’s internal and external opera-
tions, their successful deployment and use are 
critical to organizational performance and sur-
vival. In the case of ES successful implementation 
is important, since the costs and risks of these 
technology investments rival their potential pay-
offs. Failure of enterprise system implementation 
projects may lead to bankruptcy (Markus et al., 

276  
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
2000; Davenport, 1998; McAfee, 2003). The ES 
implementation as described in this chapter also 
brought the hospital into severe problems, which 
almost led to bankruptcy.
This illustrates that implementing enterprise 
systems is a complicated enterprise, not only 
from a technical point of view but also from 
many other perspectives, including strategic, 
organizational, political, and cultural viewpoints. 
One very important issue is that a large number of 
stakeholders from different organizational units 
are involved. Since as a result the decisions are 
no longer taken on a local or departmental level, 
the question of who participates in the analysis, 
development and implementation of ES becomes 
more difficult. 
We already mentioned that many hospitals 
are in a process of transformation, directed at the 
integrated delivery of health care through a more 
homogeneous range of health care products. Mo-
tives behind this change are a higher level of cost 
control, the need for organizational procedures 
for patients, and an increasing accountability of 
the hospital managers for the way in which the 
hospital operates. This process toward integration 
can be stimulated by information systems that 
help managers organize the central planning and 
control (Haux, 2006). Since enterprise systems 
have helped organizations in various industries 
to integrate and organize the real time informa-
tion delivery, they are now also applied in many 
hospitals. Suppliers of enterprise systems have 
developed modules that are specifically custom-
ized for hospitals, such as patient management 
modules and electronic patient files. Modules used 
in other industries have been slightly adapted to 
fulfill hospital requirements (Paré et al., 2001).
The empirical research conducted for this 
chapter is based on interpretive (Walsham, 1993), 
processual (Boonstra, 2003) and integrationist 
(Orlikowksi, 1992) models of change. These 
models emphasize how various groups of people 
in organizations may have different interpreta-
tions of information systems, which may shape 
their actions and influence the implementation 
and evolution of such systems.  The change 
view is rooted in social constructivism, which is 
focused on the meaning that people attach to a 
particular technology (Pinch et al., 1992). Social 
constructivism found its way to IS research by 
the so-called interpretive approaches (Walsham, 
1993, Orlikowski, 1992) and emphasizes the 
subjective meaning that an actor ascribes to an 
information system, which is based on particular 
interests, preferences, history and so on.  From 
this perspective, system implementation can be 
explained by studying the interplay of attitudes 
and actions of various stakeholders, which may be 
subject to change over time (Dawson, 1994).
Pettigrew (1988) argues that organizational 
change can be understood by considering the 
interactions among the substance, context and 
process of change within the organization and 
their continuous interplay. The implementation 
of change is an ‘iterative, cumulative and refor-
mulation-in-use process’. Successful change is 
a result of the interaction among the content or 
‘what’ of change, the process or ‘how’ of change 
(implementation) and the organizational context 
or ‘where’ of change (the internal and external 
environment). He also suggests that the change 
agent must be willing to intervene in the political 
systems of the organization, and to legitimate the 
change in the face of competing proposals and 
ideas. Bennis (1984) suggests that management of 
change is ‘management of meaning’, involving the 
attempt to convince others of the credibility and 
legitimacy of particular definitions of problems 
and solutions, and to gain consent and compliance 
(Boddy, 2002). 
It is well documented that the development of 
information systems requires the participation of 
the parties interested and that the willingness and 
the effectiveness of this participation influences 
the success of the resulting system. Normally these 
participants include developers, intended users 
and managers. However, in the case of enterprise 
systems within hospitals, this range of people and 

  277
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
parties is much broader and crosses organizational 
functions, which means that the stakeholders are 
more loosely coupled. Identifying these stakehold-
ers and exploring their perspectives in terms of 
their interests in the system and their power to 
‘make or break’ the system is essential.
When the stakeholders are identified, their 
interests can be related to the enterprise system. 
This means that part of the analysis consists of 
the assessment of the stakeholders’ perception of 
the ES. How do they interpret the ES and to what 
extent do they believe that it will be instrumental 
in attaining their objectives and that it will fit in 
with their values?  In other words: what are their 
perceived interests in the system? 
However, an enterprise systems does not de-
pend solely on the interests of stakeholders but 
also on the power relations among the parties 
involved. A powerful party with a clear interest 
in a particular ES can apply its power to force 
less powerful parties to use it, regardless of their 
perceived interest in the system (Standifera, 2003). 
At the same time, it might be rather difficult for 
parties with a great deal of interest in a particu-
lar enterprise system, but with a lack of power 
to implement it successfully, if the other parties 
are not really interested. In this chapter, we will 
define power as the capacity to exert one’s will 
over others in order to realize certain intended 
goals (Boddy, 2002). Since power is a capacity 
to exert one’s will, it is possible to indicate the 
source of this capacity, or in relation to ES: par-
ties may possess different sources of power to 
force others to cooperate and use (or not use) an 
ES. The power and interests of stakeholders may 
change during the course of a project and may 
affect the role they play. 
To characterize this role during a certain 
phase we have used the stakeholder typology 
of Mitchell et al. (1997). They identify seven 
types of stakeholders: dormant, discretionary, 
demanding, dominant, dependent, dangerous, 
and definitive stakeholders. Dormant stakehold-
ers have the power to influence, but this power 
remains unused for a certain period of time. 
Discretionary stakeholders possess legitimacy, 
but have no power to influence the project. De-
manding stakeholders have urgent claims, but 
neither possess the legitimacy nor the power to 
materialize these claims. Dominant stakehold-
ers are both powerful and legitimate. Their 
influence in the relationship is assured, since as 
a result of this power and legitimacy they form 
the dominant coalition. Dependent stakeholders 
are characterized by a lack of power, but have 
urgent and legitimate claims. These kinds of 
stakeholders depend on others to carry out their 
will. Dangerous stakeholders possess urgency and 
power but no legitimacy and may be coercive or 
even dangerous. Definitive stakeholders possess 
power, legitimacy and urgency. 
METHOTD
To conduct this case study, we used a diverse set 
of qualitative methods, including in-depth inter-
views, participant observation and documentary 
research (Ammenwerth, 2003). The initial access 
to stakeholders was negotiated with a staff member 
of the IS department. We focused the research 
on what we regarded as the most immediate 
stakeholders in the ES project. During a period 
of six months the authors visited the hospital five 
times. They conducted interviews, which lasted 
approximately 1- 2 hours, with members of the 
general management, IT, the administrative staff, 
the medical staff, and with external consultants. A 
snowball sampling strategy was used to identify 
the subsequent respondents. This means that later 
on, discussions were held with other members of 
staff, who were either working with or affected 
by the enterprise system. The interviews began 
with a generic question that allowed the inter-
viewees to express how they experienced the ES 
implementation process. After that, more specific 
questions were asked about critical incidents, the 
specific stakeholders’ interests, and the meaning 

278  
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
they attached to the system. Handwritten notes 
were taken and individual reports of the interviews 
were made. The accounts based on these notes 
were presented to the interviewees and revised 
slightly on points of detail, if necessary. The data 
were analyzed by reviewing the respondents’ com-
ments, placing them on a time line and dividing 
them into categories based on their attitudes to 
the enterprise system. The data are presented in 
the following sections.C
CASE HISTORYSISTR
The hospital studied is a medium-sized general 
hospital located in the western part of The Neth-
erlands. It has 375 beds and 1250 employees. 
The hospital is divided into six main units: 1) 
clinical care, 2) ambulant care, 3) physicians, 4) 
facilities, 5) personnel, and 6) IT and Finance. 
The physicians are largely remunerated through 
a service-based fee, and they normally use infor-
mation systems that function separately from the 
hospital systems to manage their practices and 
support their medical treatments.
 
Episode 1. Preparation
The initial motive to implement an enterprise 
system was the conclusion of a contract with the 
former vendor of the Hospital Information System 
(HIS). HIS was actually a set of separate systems 
that were loosely linked. The system was not being 
maintained appropriately and the contacts with 
the vendor were not very good. This is why the 
board of management as well as the IT department 
were interested in a modern product that could 
help them to establish an integrated, modular and 
adaptive hospital system. Management also had 
the ambition to be the first in combining the billing 
process of the hospital with that of the physicians. 
At that time, medical treatments involved two 
separate types of invoices: one from the hospital 
and one from each relevant physician. A member 
of the board of management argued:
We were struggling with a set of outdated systems 
that only supported some business functions 
separately. We lacked the proper management 
information and were in need of a system that had 
the potential to support all hospital processes in 
an integrated manner.
The hospital aimed at a system that could be 
adapted to the operational processes of the hospital, 
and not vice versa. Based on these requirements, 
a long list of potential vendors was reduced to a 
shortlist, and a multidisciplinary team selected a 
number of SAP modules to be implemented by an 
external consultancy. This consultancy claimed to 
be experienced in implementing SAP in hospitals. 
An internal IT manager said:
The consultancy convinced us that it was an expert 
in adapting and implementing SAP within hospital 
environments. The company claimed that SAP was 
very flexible and could be easily adapted to the 
specific requirements of any hospital.
Another consultancy delivered an external 
project leader, responsible for the implementation 
project. One member of the multidisciplinary team 
(a representative from the nurses) said about the 
start of the process:
We were invited by the project management 
to celebrate the start of the project. We all got 
champagne and everyone seemed to be in agree-
ment. Management and the external consultants 
promised that the new system would solve all the 
problems caused by the old and isolated hospital 
systems. The organization would become a unity 
with one single information base for all main 
processes.
However, the actual participation of the 
hospital’s administrators and physicians was 
quite passive. They were in fact merely bystand-
ers or passive recipients of information about 
the project. Moreover, the promoters were very 

  279
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
confident about the benefits of the system and 
others did not have the expertise or experience 
to challenge that.
Episode 2. StSart
After the selection of this particular software 
package, four working groups were formed to 
prepare the implementation in more detail and to 
adjust the system to the organization. Technical, 
administrative, policlinic and billing issues were 
the focus points of these four groups. They were 
chaired by the department heads. The board of 
management and the project leader put a great 
deal of pressure on them to work fast, whereas all 
members, including the chairmen, had to combine 
the preparation of the implementation with their 
regular tasks. The time pressure was so high, 
because the hospital was no longer allowed to use 
its former system. Because of this time pressure, 
the company’s communication with the prospec-
tive users was very limited. One chairman of a 
working group said:
The real objectives of the system did no longer 
seem relevant, and the only objective that remained 
was to get it implemented. We were all working 
very hard, but we could not explain why we were 
doing so much work only to replace one system 
with another. Through all of this work we lost track 
of the initial motives to implement the system.
 
In actual fact, the mutual adjustment of the 
various modules and the adaptation to the or-
ganization was limited. All energy was put into 
the technical and organizational complexities. It 
became clear that the external consultancy was not 
as experienced in implementing SAP as they had 
claimed to be. In other hospitals they had adjusted 
processes to SAP rather than the other way around. 
Due to the time pressure, the project manager 
decided to follow the same strategy here. 
One member of a working group who had been 
involved right from the start said: 
During the preparation phase, the inherent flex-
ibility and the potential functionalities of the sys-
tem were emphasized. However, when it came to 
implementation, we were forced to rush and make 
sure that the system was installed in time. 
A member of the medical staff could recall 
about this phase: 
We attended some of the meetings, but we got the 
impression that the system was merely a toy for 
the managers, and not suitable for actual use. 
However, we did emphasize how complex some 
of the processes, including the billing processes, 
are. But the implementers did not seem to be 
impressed by these remarks.
After implementation of the system, a number 
of problems arose. Both at the policlinic and at 
various other clinics, the administrative staff did 
not know how to use the system, since no formal 
opportunities had been offered for training. In 
addition, there was a lack of motivation to use 
the system, because the staff was not properly 
informed about the motives behind the SAP 
implementation. Many people also felt that the 
degree of user friendliness of the system was lower 
than that of the old system. And a few of the more 
conscientious employees even discovered that 
some output of the system was erroneous.
Episode 3. CrCisis
As already mentioned, the hospital followed two 
billing procedures, one of the hospital and one 
of the medical staff. Both procedures had to be 
integrated into one system. Since the income of the 
medical staff depends directly on a well-function-
ing billing process, a successful change-over was 
crucial to them.  Up to then, the medical staff had 
not really been involved and was hardly interested 
in the ES implementation. However, after a few 
days of system use, some people discovered that 
some treatments were not invoiced at all, whereas 

280  
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
other treatments were invoiced incorrectly or 
double. A representative of the medical staff said 
about this phase:
The implementers totally underestimated the 
complexity of this crucial process. They assumed 
that by means of their so-called efficient flow 
charts each treatment could be invoiced in the 
same way. However, the reality of our practices is 
very different from their world of schemes, charts 
and systems.
A few ingenious administrators tried to keep 
the system working by so-called  ‘work arounds’, 
which means that, only after having checked each 
invoice manually, they were sent away. These 
work arounds led to new problems; the medical 
staff as well as the patients and insurers started to 
complain. They believed that the hospital was no 
longer in control of its main financial processes. 
A real crisis developed when the regional press 
became aware of the problems. The medical staff 
became convinced that they were missing out on 
revenues. They informed the board of manage-
ment that they did not have any confidence in the 
system and that they refused to use it any longer. 
The representative of the medical staff said: 
Both the implementers and management were 
clearly not in control. They panicked. 
The board of management was forced to inter-
vene and agreed that a separate billing system was 
acquired beside the SAP system. This separate 
invoicing system was already used by some groups 
of the medical staff. From that moment on, all 
invoices were checked manually and compared 
with the new shadow system. At the same time, 
the SAP system was gradually adapted. All these 
problems led to the immediate retirement of the 
CFO. In addition, the hospital decided to sue the 
external consultancy for having failed to meet the 
main terms of the agreement. After six months, 
all the adaptations and extra attention seemed 
to have some effect. However, due to this crisis, 
some people think that the hospital missed out on 
at least 10% of its annual revenues and was very 
near to bankruptcy because of the implementa-
tion of this system. Various people commented 
that the lower administrative staff had ‘saved’ 
the implementation by using redundant systems 
and checking all financial flows manually. An 
observer said: 
This project was initiated by the top and by ex-
ternals, but it was realized by the loyalty of the 
lower administrative staff. 
The crisis was overcome by using additional 
and redundant systems and by gradually adapting 
the enterprise system to the old working practices. 
This took approximately six months, during which 
the administrative staff, nurses and physicians 
actually adapted and succeeded in managing 
the operation of the system. At that time, the in-
house IT department, which had been left out the 
preparation and implementation phase, recaptured 
its tasks. Externals stepped back and the normal 
operations were once again continued.
Episode 4. Use
After some time, the system was assimilated and 
the organization became used to it. However, 
management did not feel that it stimulated the 
improvement of the management information or 
led to a more integrated organizational structure. 
Because its implementation had been rushed, little 
attention was paid to the further possibilities of 
the system. For this reason a new project was 
started, which aimed at generating management 
information and reports. Only a few clinics have 
used the SAP system in an optimal way, and many 
other clinics still use only a limited number of 
functions. Management is not convinced that the 
system has helped to achieve the objectives on 
which the project was based.

ANALYSISSIS
In this section the roles and interests of the different 
stakeholders during this process and the meaning 
they attached to the system will be discussed. After 
that, we will interpret some successive actions 
that affected the process. Then we will list what 
went wrong during this implementation and what 
lessons can be learned from that. This analysis 
will be conducted on the basis of the theoretical 
backgrounds as presented in the third section.
Positions of StSakeholders
The most important stakeholders involved in this 
implementation project were the board of man-
agement, the external consultancy, the external 
project leader, the physicians, the administrators 
and the IT staff. Many of these stakeholders are 
groups with many internal varieties, but also with 
a relatively high level of consistency with regard to 
their perceptions of interests, problems, solutions 
and meaning in relation to this project.
The board of management had a clear inter-
est in a successful and efficient implementation 
of the enterprise system. They strongly felt that 
one integrated system would provide them with 
the management information the needed. The 
system was intended to replace many local and 
outdated operational systems, which did not 
deliver any useful information to the board. The 
board of management clearly acted as a definitive 
stakeholder, possessing power, legitimacy and 
acting from a sense of urgency. After the first 
stages, however, they delegated a number of their 
responsibilities to external parties, which means 
that they became a dormant stakeholder.
The external consultancy had accepted the 
project on a fixed price basis and obviously had 
a clear interest in a fast and smooth implementa-
tion process. The company was hoping that it 
could use its previous experiences to realize an 
effective implementation in this case. But it un-
derestimated the power and roles of the medical 
practices, which required a system that would 
comply with the established processes and medical 
practices. The external project leader, who was 
from another consultancy, had similar views on 
the interests, problems and their meaning. Both 
can be characterized as dependent stakeholders. 
They both felt a clear urgency, and they both 
had been given authorization by the board, but 
they did not really have the power to force other 
stakeholders to comply.
The administrators can be regarded as users 
of both the old and the new system. They did not 
have a clear interest in the new system, since they 
were used to the current working practices. The 
external implementers did not really involve the 
administrators in the implementation process. 
This was due to time pressures but also because 
the implementers tried to adapt the hospital pro-
cesses to the system rather than the other way 
around. Physicians and administrators argued that 
the external parties underestimated the hospital’s 
internal complexities and that they lacked a clear 
interest in its current processes. 
The IT staff and the board of management 
agreed upon the desirability of a single compact 
and modern IT package for the whole organization. 
The IT department, however, lacked sufficient 
knowledge about such systems, and for the time 
being it had to be busy with maintaining the old set 
of systems. This is why during the implementation 
process IT played  a background role. 
In general, the medical staff want to do their 
work with some degree of autonomy and with-
out too much managerial interference. In addi-
tion, they tend to seek systems that reduce their 
non-medical workload as much as possible. One 
member argued that it would be in the interest 
of the doctors to have loosely-coupled systems, 
which are tightly adapted to their own specific 
medical practices. This was not in line with the 
interests of the board of management, who wished 
to have an overview of all main processes. The 
physicians were mainly bystanders during the 
early stages of the project. They felt that it was 

282  
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
an issue to be dealt with by the managers but not 
by them. This is why they can be characterized as 
dormant stakeholders; they possessed the power 
but neither felt the urgency nor had the legitimacy 
to interfere. This changed dramatically once they 
became aware that there were serious problems 
with the billing processes. They then instantly 
became definitive stakeholders, who clashed with 
the only other definitive stakeholder: the board 
of management. 
What Went Wrong?
A number of things went wrong during the 
implementation of this ERP-system. The most 
important ones are the following:
Management and consultants showed a lack of 
attention for organizational change issues. In 
this case history, hospital management attempted 
to implement an integrated system in a loosely 
coupled organization without paying much atten-
tion to organizational change issues. Management 
mainly focused on their own goals, namely the 
replacement of the old hospital system and the 
implementation of a modern integrated product. 
They did not consider the consequences of this 
product for other powerful stakeholders. The 
external consultancy argued that it was possible 
to use this ERP solution not only as a replace-
ment, but also as a solution of a number of other 
management problems. By doing so, they adopted 
an exclusive ‘management rationalism’ approach 
(Heeks, 2006), while ignoring process complex-
ity and diversity and power of the workforce (see 
section 3).
The project was characterized by the rush 
to implement and the ambition to innovate, 
which led to ignorance of problems and com-
plications. Management and implementers were 
in a rush since the hospital was not longer allowed 
to use the old hospital system. Besides, manage-
ment expressed the ambition of ‘being the first 
in combining the billing process’. This limited 
timeframe led to ‘hard design’(Heeks, 2006) and 
also to sloppy thinking with regard to process 
details. The billing process was also much more 
complex than the consultancy expected and was 
actually too complicated to capture into the new 
system. The underestimation of this complexity 
led to errors and a decreasing confidence in the 
system by staff and physicians.
There was a low degree of real participation 
and a lack of attention to the interests of impor-
tant stakeholders. Physicians and administrators 
reported that participation during the initiation 
and start phase was limited. This low degree of 
participation caused a lack of co-ownership and 
explained that physicians did feel the responsibil-
ity to co-operate in replacing their own billing 
systems by the new ERP-system. Physicians ar-
gued that this was a project of management and 
consultants so they did not feel a reason to spend 
time to the realization of this new system. When 
the actual billing procedure proved to be unreli-
able, physicians, as being powerful bystanders, 
could enter the arena and blame others for the 
installation of an unreliable new system.
Communications about project objectives 
were ambivalent and sometimes incorrect. On 
the one hand, management and the consultancy 
argued that the hospital needed a software product 
that would help the hospital to become integrated 
and to deliver consistent and up to date manage-
ment information. On the other hand, they told 
the administrators and physicians that the system 
would be adapted, in order to adjust the system 
to the organization.  This ambivalence caused 
misunderstanding among members of working 
groups and physicians. In case of adjustment, 
experts had to study hospital processes and to 
modify the system. In case of change, physicians 
and administrators would be more affected.
Competencies of external consultancy were 
not adequate. The consultancy claimed to have 
expertise in implementing in ERP in hospitals, 
but this expertise was mainly in adjusting hospital 
processes to systems, rather than the other way 

  283
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
around. They also lacked expertise in dealing 
with organizational change processes, since they 
had a technical focus.
Lessons
Based on this case history, the following lessons 
can be learned that are relevant for vendors/con-
sultants of hospital ERP and senior management 
of hospitals.
1.	
ERP implementation in hospitals is a 
combination of technology change and 
organizational change and should be man-
aged accordingly. This means that project 
management should use expertise from both 
fields to implement such change successfully. 
Markus (2004) provides a number of useful 
principles for adequate project management 
in case of the implementation of technology 
combined with organizational change.
2.	
In case of a high time pressure or a short 
time frame, the objectives and ambitions of 
ERP implementation in hospitals should be 
brought back to realistic levels. After the 
initial implementation other projects can be 
started to make further steps. Since process 
complexity in hospitals is often high, close 
attention and time is needed to translate 
them into the system in adequate ways.
3.	
Active participation of key stakeholders leads 
to co-ownership and a responsible attitude 
during the various stages of implementation. 
Especially in case of highly affected and 
powerful stakeholders, such as physicians 
in hospitals, it is essential to secure active 
roles and responsibility of physicians or their 
representatives. Principles of ‘soft design’ 
(Heeks, 2006) should be applied in such 
cases.
4.	
Management has to be very clear and con-
sistent to anyone affected about the objec-
tives of ERP implementation. Especially 
about the choice to adjust the system to the 
organization or to change hospital processes 
to the system is very crucial. This decision 
determines how the project has to be man-
aged and how participation of stakeholders 
has to be organized.
5.	
In case of process change, adequate change 
managers have to be in charge. In case of the 
use of external consultancies, management 
has to make sure that these consultancies 
have relevant expertise in realizing such 
change in hospitals.
C NCLUSIONCSI
Enterprise systems are not only technical artifacts, 
but also a reflection of management philosophies, 
which may or may not fit in with existing orga-
nizational arrangements. This implies that ES 
implementations may challenge vested interests, 
and may lead to opposing views of various players. 
Especially in hospitals, where physicians possess 
discretionary power to organize their processes 
and to manage their practices, ES may clash 
with their interests and viewpoints. Enterprise 
systems are designed to integrate functions and 
to standardize business processes, which were 
previously dispersed and diverse. The physicians 
affected do have the power to choose whether they 
wish to adopt or to reject such systems.  
For these reasons it is essential for managers of 
ES implementations within hospitals to be aware 
of the ways in which ES affects the established 
institutional settings (Yi et al., 2006). During the 
initial stages of the implementation process, deci-
sions have to be made about necessary changes in 
either the system or the organization, or in both. 
These changes can be required to meet certain 
needs of stakeholders in order to make sure that 
they cooperate and participate in effective ways. 
It is not acceptable if potential influential players 
remain passive until the actual use phase starts. 
This case illustrates that aggressive resistance 
after implementation can lead to a counter-pro-

284  
Analyzing an ES Implementation in a Health Care Environment
ductive crisis, which could have been prevented 
by a thorough analysis of the interests of the key 
players right from the start. Such an analysis 
could be followed by a discussion that leads to an 
agreement among the most important stakeholders 
upon how to implement the system and how to 
adapt the relevant processes. Such an agreement 
could be a compromise of various contrasting 
interests. 
The chapter also shows that ES implementation 
within hospitals is a dynamic process. This means 
that certain views, which are held by stakeholders 
at one point in time, may change during the project. 
There may be various reasons why views change, 
including cognitive, political and opportunistic 
ones. In this case the physicians and administrators 
remained relatively passive, until problems arose 
during the use phase. It indicates that implement-
ing ES within hospitals is a complex venture, in 
which the opportunities and limitations of the 
system have to be aligned with the existing and 
always changing organizational arrangements, 
including various perceptions, quests for power, 
leadership and subtle processes to gain support 
for further continuation of the project. 
In this case a power vacuum (caused by the 
board of management) stimulated behavior that 
was more politically-oriented, and resulted in 
a lack of agreement on the direction and use of 
the system. Through this lack of agreement, the 
various stakeholders mainly followed mainly their 
own goals and undermined to some extent the 
hospital-wide explicit objectives of the project. 
The chapter shows that the promoters of the hos-
pital-wide enterprise system took a too optimistic 
view of the power of such a system to improve 
the operation of the hospital’s processes. In the 
rush to implement, no careful attention was paid 
to the complexities of the internal processes, the 
stakeholders’ interests and their mutual relations. 
The rational image of system implementation 
could not conceal its poor understanding of the 
deeper organizational realities, such as history, 
culture and power. R

Effectively

Abstracta
ERP systems have become key enablers of businesses today. While many organizations wish to adopt ERP 
for competitive advantage, they find choosing, using, and realizing expected benefits from, appropriate 
ERP extremely daunting, given the multitude of factors and options along technologies, vendors, people, 
and customisation cost and time.  It is in this context that the experience presented in this chapter from 
two Indian projects on designing to deploying ERP systems—for two different organizations engaged 
in education and construction—becomes very relevant. Reporting on the various processes, practices, 
techniques, and methods employed through the projects, and the lessons learnt therefrom, the paper argues 
that time has come for designing and deploying industry-neutral generic ERP systems cost effectively. 
It proposes that through a combination of appropriate technologies, innovative tools, techniques and 
strategies, highly adoptive and customisable ERP systems can be designed and deployed at affordable 
costs and within reasonable timeframes.
ITRCTI
Enterprise systems [ES] in general and Enterprise 
Resource Planning systems [ERP] 1 in particular 
have become the most important enablers of busi-
ness today.  The emerging trend is that a number 
of business enterprises as well as not-for-profit 
organisations like universities and hospitals--re-
gardless of their size, market, products, services, 
industry, location--have now started looking at 
ERP as an effective facilitator of, and a powerful 
tool for, managing the organisation better.   Most 

288  
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
of them believe that they can create and sustain 
cost and competitive advantages by adopting 
ERP.  We must note here that even for universi-
ties, hospitals, NGO’s,  and charitable institutions 
running a variety of  socially relevant programs, 
cost is a major concern and, with globalisation 
and opening of up of economies,  competition 
real and important.  Even small and medium size 
enterprises opt for [or would like to adopt] ERP 
more as a strategic initiative to combat competi-
tion than merely as part of information system. 
Consider, for example, the case of a small textile 
firm in Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, India which had 
to go for on-line hook-up with the supply chain 
management system of Wall Mart, USA, in order 
to win and execute supply contract. (Surajeet 
Gupta, 2004)1
However, when it comes to choosing and adopt-
ing an ERP most appropriate for the enterprise, 
the exercise is neither easy nor straight forward. 
A number of key questions and challenges arise 
when an enterprise considers adopting ES/ERP. 
Ranging from relevance, cost-benefit justification, 
appropriateness, to choice of source [licensing, 
renting, owning], architecture, designing, de-
veloping, and finally deploying the very system 
‘successfully’, these questions and challenges are 
big and complex, and encompass a number of con-
siderations and options in terms of ‘economics’, 
‘technology’, ‘human resource’, ‘organisational 
culture’, and ‘environmental issues’.      Going by 
example is not feasible either, as published real 
life cases are limited in number and inconclusive 
on key issues, presenting more of successes and 
understandably less of failures.  Even fewer are 
reported in detail about the experiences through--
and more importantly the lessons learnt from--the 
Software/System Development Life Cycle [SDLC] 
phases and processes.   
Given this scenario, it is no wonder that while 
the number of enterprises wishing to adopt ERP 
is growing, the rate of such adoption is not phe-
nomenal.   Major restraints appear to be in terms 
of high cost, long time, and uncertain benefits. 
More specifically, enterprises hesitate to adopt 
ES/ERP because: 
•	
of high total cost of ownership [TCO] and 
total cost of operations [TCOP]; let us call 
these and underlying factors collectively, 
the COST;
•	
of unduly long time to reach ‘full adoption’ 
stage; let us call these and related factors 
collectively, the TIME; and 
•	
the anticipated benefits are not cognizable 
and realizable; let us call these and related 
factors collectively, the QUALITY.   
In other words, concerns around three dimen-
sions, viz., COST, TIME, and QUALITY [CTQ] 
seem to act as ‘barriers’ for enterprises adopting 
ERP.  Of course, there are a number of other 
indirect factors as well, like ‘people being not 
ready’, ‘business process re-engineering [BPR] 
not properly done’ and so on.  While ‘people’ 
and ‘processes’ are certainly important, we note 
that their impact gets reflected in CTQ [people 
not being ready delays adoption; delay costs time 
and money; bad processes cause delay and dam-
age which in turn affect cost, time and quality]. 
Obviously, COST and TIME are more easily 
quantifiable than QUALITY.   
While the foregoing illustrates issues from the 
enterprise perspective, there is an equally chal-
lenging and complex set of issues for the ‘designer, 
developer, vendor’ to consider and resolve.   Some 
of the key questions and challenges here are:  
•	
Why should ES/ERP [the software part] 
continue to be costly, even after several 
years of designing and developing [including 
re-designing] by a number of players in the 
field?   
•	
What is happening on the ‘re-usability of 
code [components]’, ‘avoidance of re-invent-
ing of the wheel’ front, leading to reduction 
in cost/time for re-design and re-develop-
ment?

  289
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
•	
Why should ES/ERP be industry-specific, 
and thereby the cost of customisation add-
ing to TCO and TCOP?    Can the degree 
of ‘abstraction’ in design be increased, so 
that the resultant application architecture 
becomes industry-neutral, and is more easily 
customizable and maintainable?
•	
How much of Open Source Standards [OSS] 
and Object Oriented Analysis and Design 
[OOAD] approach and tools can be used in 
simplifying the design, architecture, and 
thus improving reliability, maintainability, 
and upgradeability?     
In other words, the ‘designer, developer, ven-
dor’ perspective and concern should ideally be to 
meet and match the CTQ concerns of the enter-
prise, via technological options, methodologies, 
techniques which include/exploit: ‘reusability of 
code’; ‘OSS’; ‘industry-neutrality’, ‘OOAD ap-
proach’; all leading to ‘designing to deployment 
of ERP effectively’.  But they aren’t, as things 
stand today.
Juxtaposing the eagerness and concerns of 
enterprises in terms of CTQ on adopting ERP on 
the one side, with the issues and challenges before 
designers, developers and vendors, on the other, 
this Chapter proposes to show that it is possible to 
address many of the issues mentioned and break 
the ‘barriers to ERP adoption by enterprise’, 
through a presentation and detailed discussion of 
experience from two software development proj-
ects in India.   Beginning with working definitions 
for some contextually relevant terms, key details 
of the projects as Background [the next section], 
the Chapter proceeds to discuss [in the subsequent 
sections] the projects in detail, in terms of objec-
tives, critical issues faced  and responses given 
by the sponsoring-organisations, and presents the 
experiences drawn from the projects along with 
learning gained.   It concludes [in the last section], 
in the light of the limited empirical evidence drawn 
and recorded from the projects, that
•	
it is possible to design highly customisable 
[and therefore very flexible and user-centric] 
and generic [i.e., industry-neutral] ERP by 
using a combination of innovative ideas 
of design, technology options and sources 
available today; and
•	
also to deploy it effectively through a judi-
cious combination of people and process 
factors, with CTQ advantages for the en-
terprise.   B
BackgroundCKR
Some Definitions
Before getting into the details of the projects, let 
us place some contextually relevant acronyms 
and terms, and discuss their broad working 
definitions and meanings as we use them here. 
These terms are: ERP, TCO, TCOP, CTQ, BPR, 
OSS, and OOAD.
We look at ERP both as a system and as 
software package.  ERP, as a system, is an en-
terprise-wide, orderly, and cohesive arrangement 
of computers, people, information flows and pro-
cesses, procedures and control mechanisms, and 
communication facilities, in such a manner that 
the business of the enterprise can be carried out 
effectively and efficiently.   It encompasses and 
integrates synergistically through information 
processes and flows, at on-line and real time, all 
typical and key functional areas of business: viz., 
marketing/ sales/ distribution, materials/purchase/
stores, production/qc/maintenance, accounting/ 
finance, and human resource development, at 
operations, tactical, and strategic levels of man-
agement.   Ideally, it should focus on and facilitate 
customer servicing, competitiveness, and growth 
with surplus from the operations of business.
ERP as a custom-built or vendor-supplied off-
the-shelf-shrink-wrapped customisable package, 
is a set of software [computer] programs, capable of 
running on and linking computers and computing 

290

devices [PCs, PDAs, mobile phones, bar code read-
ers, POS machines, CNC machines], regardless of 
their make, model, and numbers; across offices, 
production floors, plants, warehouses, regardless 
of their location; in real time and on-line mode; 
integrating  all 'business processes' [BPs] across 
functional areas like marketing, sales, logistics, 
production, quality assurance, materials, stores, 
maintenance, accounting and finance, human 
resource, automating as many 'BPs' as feasible; 
through a common data base; for the unified 
purposes of  optimised enterprise wide resource 
usage. We are of course excluding patented, 
protected, and secretly guarded ‘production and 
conversion’ processes from the purview.   What, 
however, is included is the ‘information part’.
Extensions to ERP covering inter-enterprise 
operations and processes include software catego-
rized as CRM [customer relation management] 
and SCM [supply chain management] systems, 
and often may be treated as part of ERP itself.
Note the definition is industry-neutral, and 
implies that not only planning of ‘resources’--
but also their effective and integrative manage-
ment--through information and communication 
technology [ICT] is central to ERP.  Resources 
for this purpose mean and include: men [people], 
machines, materials, money, and mouse [meaning 
information!], along time and quality dimen-
sions. Note the omission of ‘land’ [the first fac-
tor of production in Economics] from the list of 
resources, and addition of ‘information’ to it.  In 
the words of Turban et. al. (2004), “Managing 
information resources, new technologies, and 
communications networks is becoming a – or 
even the – critical success factor in the operations 
of many organisations, private and public, and 
will be essential to the survival of organisations 
in the digital economy.” 2   Information is a key 
factor leading to knowledge, both at individual 
and corporate levels, and enterprises thus regard 
both information and knowledge as valuable 
resource. Indeed, as Ruggles (1998) 3[3] notes, 
quoting Peter Drucker, “knowledge has become 
the key economic resource and the dominant - and 
perhaps even the only - source of comparative 
advantage”. (p.80)  
We also note that because of the close links 
among ‘information’, ‘knowledge’ and CTQ 
advantages that can arise from adopting ERP, 
its applicability and usefulness extend beyond 
business enterprise, to even not-for-profit and 
governmental organisations and institutions.
We define TCO as the sum of investments 
made up to the current time on ERP-assets [e.g., 
hardware, software licence/media, security and 
so on, all attributable to ERP and all of a long-
lasting nature] acquired/developed/ replaced/up-
graded over time by the enterprise, adjusted for 
accumulated depreciation and tax concessions 
on such assets up to that time. All expenses 
including costs of procurement, installation and 
commissioning of all ERP-assets of amortizable 
nature would be included in TCO, duly amor-
tized.    Invariably, TCO is treated as ‘cumulative 
investment net of depreciation’ and so shown in 
the books of accounts as ‘assets’ as on the time 
of ascertainment.  
TCOP is defined as the sum of expenditure 
incurred periodically [usually per annum] and 
measured during any point in time in such period, 
on maintenance of ERP-assets and supportive 
resources/services. These include: hardware, 
software licence/media maintenance/upgrade 
fees, salaries to IT staff, ongoing training to staff, 
consultants fee, security drills and upkeep, and so 
forth, all of ‘recurring’ nature, non-amortizable, 
and  attributable to ERP. Invariably, TCOP is 
treated as ‘recurring expenditure’ and written off 
in the books of accounts pertaining to the period 
to which it belongs by a charge on the surplus 
[or income] earned. If there is no surplus, then it 
would appear as ‘cash loss’ or ‘accumulated loss’ 
and effectively reduce the capital.   In other words, 
TCOP would be 0 at the beginning and at its high-
est at the end of the period of ascertainment.
CTQ stands for Cost-Time-Quality, the key 
dimensions along which enterprises aspire to have 

  291
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
control, to gain and sustain competitive advantage 
and growth with surplus. Every organisation tries 
to establish and sustain its comparative and com-
petitive advantages by having better control on its 
cost of production/services, reducing  time to mar-
ket/service, and  in the process improve [and not 
compromise] the quality of its products/services. 
In these days of Internet and ICT, it has realized 
that by effectively and innovatively using ICT, it 
can turn CTQ in its favour. It has been reported 
in a survey that intelligent enterprises establish 
their effectiveness in their markets and environ-
ments via CTQ control, by using and exploiting 
ICT (Anil Patrick R, 2005).4    
A question often raised at this juncture, but 
rarely fully answered in the literature, is: at 
what TCO, TCOP should an enterprise regard 
ERP-adoption as justified?   While applying cost 
benefit analysis is sticky, given the difficulties in 
quantifying many of the intangible benefits, it has 
also been argued that there are genuine strategic 
compulsions for adopting--and other methods 
of justifying investment in--ERP (Padmanaban, 
2006).5   In any case, justifying investment in ERP, 
or leveraging it to gain the anticipated benefits by 
the enterprise is beyond our purview.  Our focus is 
on establishing that there are empirical evidences 
to bring down both TCO and TCOP considerably, 
which leads to CTQ advantage via adopting ERP 
by the enterprise. Suffice is to say that relating 
TCO to capital [corpus in case of not-for-profit 
organisations], and TCOP to turnover [or outlay 
in case of not-for-profit organisations] on an on-
going basis across industry verticals would be 
one of the good measures.   
BPR for our discussion means and includes 
an organisation’s willingness and propensity to 
critically and continually evaluate the manner in 
which it handles [processes] its business func-
tions, and its ability to drop, modify, and even 
introduce new, ways of handling such functions, 
all leading to greater customer satisfaction, bet-
ter quality, higher productivity, and shorter cycle 
time to market/serve customer.  Here again the 
implications are in terms of CTQ.    
We recognize OSS as an important emerg-
ing trend not to be ignored. It signifies a major 
paradigm shift giving newer meaning for owner-
ship and usage of intellectual property rights.  If 
properly explored, it could lead to considerable 
savings in cost, thus yielding CTQ advantage to 
the enterprise. For the ‘designer, developer, ven-
dor’ it offers tremendous intellectual challenge, 
scope, as well as satisfaction, in terms of  creating, 
improving, and sharing of: operating systems, 
communication protocols, databases, develop-
ment frameworks, utilities, and toolkits.   
OOAD includes incorporating innovative 
design ideas, exploiting its principles of abstrac-
tion, and guidelines on creating and improving 
‘re-usable code’, all leading to designing of in-
dustry-neutral ERP.
Having defined and discussed the relevant 
terms, let us now discuss the projects in detail, 
beginning with some key data about the projects 
themselves.S
Some Key Data About the ProjectsK
The two projects involved three organisations in 
India, falling into three totally different lines of 
business/industry, viz., education, construction, 
and IT products/services.   Both the projects were 
conceived to design, develop, and deploy home-
grown [meaning in-house and custom-built] ERP 
capable of running across a number of institutions/ 
enterprises. The entire discussion that follows is 
based on the experience and some learning by 
the author, a key and the only common member 
between the two project teams, playing mainly 
the role of advisor/consultant.    
The first project, nicknamed EERPMS [Edu-
cational Enterprises Resources Planning and 
Management System], commenced in September 
2004 as an in-house ERP software development 
initiative at/by a charitable trust named Sreekshe-
thra Dharmasthala Manjunatheswara Educational 
Society [SDMES], Ujire, Karnataka, India.   EE-
RPMS aims at integrating all functional aspects 

292  
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
of about 45+ educational institutions located in 
different cities and towns in the state of Karna-
taka, offering education and training services 
at different levels, in various fields, including 
medical, dental, engineering, and management. 
The project went through testing in March 2007, 
and is expected to go live in July 2007, in re-
spect of FIVE modules [Accounts & Inventory, 
Academics & Admissions, Human Resource, and 
Library] at three locations as initial phase.   Us-
ing a combination of Open Source resources and 
web technologies including Java and JSP, and at 
one fifth the normal market costs, EERPMS has 
given a number of insights useful to both ERP 
adaptors and designers.
The second project, nicknamed URCIS [URC 
Information System], commenced in September 
2006, also as an in-house effort, with the help 
of an external software developing company [to 
be called SDC], meant to integrate the business 
processes of a leading construction company [to be 
called CC] in Tamil Nadu, a state in South India, 
connecting five branches and about 40 project 
sites on-line real-time.2   The project is expected 
to go live in phases beginning July 2007.   Using 
a combination of .NET resources and also home-
grown tools and utilities, URCIS has established 
that ERP can be made not only at cost almost one 
sixth of what vendors of off-the-shelf packages 
quoted, but also with flexibility to make it almost 
industry-neutral.   
The following sections narrate how both 
EERPMS and URCIS provided challenges and 
opportunities to try and experiment with some 
bold and innovative initiatives in: design and 
development of an ERP system capable of meet-
ing the varying needs of enterprises in different 
industries/sectors; its deployment among insti-
tutions with differing levels of autonomy; and 
above all in accomplishing goals of integration 
and consolidation of information about resources 
at the management level at optimum cost.    
The discussion would be common across 
both the projects, noting significant differences 
as and when applicable. Table 1 lists a number of 
important aspects of both the projects.   
Let us now discuss the entire project expe-
rience, in terms of key objectives, issues and 
concerns, responses, and learning.  T
THE PROJECT ERJCTXPERIENCE ARICand
LEARNINGRI
K y Objectives, Issues, CoICncerns 
and ResponsesR
Although the projects commenced at different 
times, they both had some common objectives, 
issues, and concerns before them. One could see 
that many of these are almost generic and ap-
plicable to any ERP initiative, regardless of the 
industry or line of business. We discuss what 
we consider were critical, and also present the 
response/choice made by the organisations along 
with reasons:  
•	
How/why is an educational institution [SD-
MES] similar to, or different from, a business 
enterprise [CC]?  What are the compulsions 
to consider using an ERP?  Can a generic 
ERP be designed to address several differ-
ences between not only SDMES and CC, but 
also among the constituents of SDMES?
These implied not only clearly identifying 
anticipated benefits [objectives] in advance as a 
means to justify ERP investment, but also explor-
ing possibilities of designing generic ERP, with 
the desired levels of ‘customisability’ and also 
‘security’.    For instance, SDMES has pharmacy 
colleges and hospitals with medicine production 
facilities, and therefore the ERP should ideally 
include production, packing, sales and distribution 
modules as well.   Even among its several con-
stituent institutions, special differences existed 
in terms of admission procedures [government 
controlled], functional autonomy [some were 

  293
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
affiliated to University, some were autonomous], 
curriculum design, placement and so on.  CC, on 
the other hand, has some educational institutions 
run under its indirect supervision via some trusts 
created for the purpose.   
Both, in this sense, looked for synergistic 
benefits from a common initiative. The main 
objective of the ERP initiative was ‘to integrate 
the various departments, divisions, constituents 
through an information system which would 
automate a number of clerical functions at the 
operations level, help in making and improving 
decisions by middle management, and also yield 
strategic control and consolidated information for 
the top management’.  With these objectives and 
concerns forming the backdrop of their require-
ments, the organisations then began looking at 
the next two important issues, i.e., the design for 
‘generic’ ERP, and the source of such ERP.   On 
the fist issue, some bold and innovative tools and 
techniques were introduced both by SDMES and 
CC.  More about these in the next section.  On 
the second issue of ‘source’, the options ranged 
from ‘buying/licensing to renting to in-house 
development’.    The choice was ‘in-house’.   The 
rationale follows.
  
•	
What is the option for sourcing ERP?  Why 
in-house development?  How does one justify 
the cost and time involved?   How about 
project management and mobilization of 
resources?

Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
It became apparent from the beginning itself 
that the option of ‘buying/licensing off-the-shelf 
package offered by vendors’ was going to cost way 
beyond the ‘affordable’ points.  For instance, the 
quotes ranged from INR [Indian rupees] 10 to 20 
million, inclusive of customisation and training.3 
The timeframe indicated also ranged from 12 to 
24 months from the date of signing of contract. 
Note that these figures did not include hardware 
and software components like the operating 
system, data base management system, and com-
munication ware.  
One can of course argue that the so called ‘af-
fordable’ points and the perception of timeframes 
as too long are subjective and may vary depending 
upon the risk-preference profile of the investing 
organisation. Nevertheless the point is that any 
organisation considering the ERP initiative for 
the first time would have its own yardsticks on 
these, and they are normally inclined to accept 
the lowest TCO and the shortest timeframe, if and 
when they consider procuring ‘shrink-wrapped’ 
package.  The ‘renting’ option, offered by some 
vendors also implied that their products were 
not meeting even 20% of the requirements. The 
choice therefore was ‘in-house development’ with 
whatever support one could get from outside, after 
detailed estimates and discussion convinced the 
management that this would be the least risky 
option with better control on cost and time. 
While SDMES went ahead with in-house team 
building, roping in consultants from within to 
form the project team, CC went in for in-house 
team supplemented by services from SDC and 
an external consultant [the author] to direct and 
manage the project.   The next question was about 
development platform and environment.
•	
What software platform, including data base 
management system? Which source: open 
or proprietary? What type of architecture: 
simple client server on LAN/WAN or web-
based Internet technologies?
While open source was the favoured choice be-
cause it meant ‘readily available tools, Operating 
Systems [OS, e.g. Linux], database management 
systems [MySql], language and frameworks [Java 
and J2EE], web browsers [Mozilla] and servers 
[Tomcat/Apache] at minimum/no cost from the 
Internet’, it also posed some challenges.  These 
included: unfamiliarity; lack of accountable sup-
port; need for protecting [or continuing to use] 
the existing OS, database systems and so on.   A 
combination therefore of proprietary and open 
source was inevitable.  While SDMES’s choice 
drew more from OSS, CC chose more from pro-
prietary, mainly because of strong familiarity 
considerations.    On the question of architecture, 
simple LAN/WAN based client/server vs. web-
based n-tiered, both favoured the latter mainly 
because of low cost communication and network-
ing options via Internet. See Table 1 for details.
Next key issue was about the project manage-
ment itself, through the SDLC cycle, through 
phases like analysis, design, development, testing, 
and deploying.
•	
How about the project management, per 
se, taking into account analysis, design, 
development, testing, user acceptance, and 
deployment?  
While detailed software requirement speci-
fications [SRS] were drawn up in consultation 
with user groups, it was becoming obvious that 
there were conflicting interests and aspirations 
from a few departments/divisions/constituents, 
sometimes negating the very objectives the man-
agement had.   For instance, two of the institu-
tions of SDMES felt threatened about losing their 
independence, while some others felt they did not 
need an ERP at all, or a ‘differently designed ERP’. 
One of the departmental heads of CC opined that 
his requirements were so complex that they could 
not be met by ERP.   A tactical response from the 
team was that adequate ‘configurability’ would 
take care of difference in the requirements, while 

  295
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
autonomy/independence would be affected to the 
minimum.       
For the designers, these signals of resistance 
and hesitation meant that the design should yield 
a high degree of ‘customisability’ without much 
loss of time, while ensuring that the original 
objectives could still be met.   They realized that 
while users in general would be limited in specify-
ing their expectations or requirements, intensive 
involvement of a few selective more knowledge-
able users would lead to better design and larger 
scope.   For instance, one of the librarians took a 
lot more interest than others [there were at least 
20 representing different colleges/institutions] 
in demanding the best and current features like 
OPAC [open public access catalogue].   
It became obvious through the SDLC phases 
that both people and process related issues like 
the ones mentioned above would have to be 
handled carefully and tactfully.   Periodic formal 
meetings and communication by the top manage-
ment representative [the Secretary of SDMES, 
and the Executive Director of CC] with the user 
groups, heads of institutions/departments helped 
in tackling these issues.  In the case of CC, an 
additional ‘ambassador’ group comprising of 1-2 
staff members from each department was created, 
and charged with authority and accountability 
to ensure smooth transition to the deployment 
phase. We shall discuss more on these in the 
next section.  
While SDMES project team suffered from at-
trition and multi-location coordination problems 
resulting considerable loss of productive time, 
accompanied by part-time team leaders, the CC 
team had its own difficulties in terms of work-
ing from two different locations, delay in hiring 
people, and re-training of staff in the technologies 
chosen. EERPMS took almost more than two 
years to reach deployment, while URCIS took 
just about nine months.   
The only inference we could draw for this 
major difference is that while SDMES environ-
ment allowed a ‘laid-back’ attitude and ‘persuasive 
and democratic’ approach with only part-time 
involvement from team-leaders,  typical of 
educational/charitable institutions, the URCIS 
environment could manage to create and maintain 
a ‘business-like’ attitude and ‘more compelling 
and demanding’ approach, typical of  business 
enterprises.      
Both projects reached the stage of deploy-
ment roughly 9 [CC] to 30 [SDMES] months 
after commencement.    As at the time of writing, 
SDMES has launched 5 modules at one location, 
while CC has completed beta testing using ‘real 
life’ data, and is in the process of going live on 
all the modules with basic functionalities in five 
locations.  
TI
mportant ChCallenges and 
Learning
We now discuss what we consider to be the three 
most important points of challenges and learn-
ing revealed through the various aspects of the 
projects:   
•	
Designing for Industry-neutrality & Gener-
icity;
•	
Automating and improving degree of ‘cus-
tomisability’; and  
•	
Strategic People and Process factors to 
ensure quick and smooth deployment.  
At the core, ERP is meant for effective planning 
and management of resources through integration 
of various business functions.   A design which 
aims at building industry-neutrality and genericity 
should therefore begin with an understanding of 
similarities [if any] across functional processes 
among different industries for this purpose, and 
also provide for dissimilarities [if any].  It is 
obvious that similarities occur naturally if the 
functional process remains same.  For instance, 
an educational system may have some production 
systems as well [as in the case of SDMES], having 
procurement, production, storing, dispatch, and 

296  
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
receivables typical of a manufacturing system.  In 
such cases, one could easily provide for ‘modules’ 
dealing with these processes as ‘add-ons’.   
However, if there is no natural commonality 
across functions, then what should the designer 
do?  Here, the principle of ‘abstraction’ comes 
to help, and we try and visualize commonalities 
in an abstract manner.  For instance, can the 
‘admission’ process of an educational system be 
likened to the ‘procurement [buying]’ process 
of a manufacturing system, treating the ‘object 
of procurement’ to be ‘natural individual person 
[say, student]’ in the first case, and ‘material [say, 
iron ore]’ for the second case, assuming that both 
the systems treat the resources as ‘inputs’ to be 
processed to yield some ‘outputs’.    One can argue 
that this is height of ‘abstraction’ and it is absurd 
to treat ‘student’ the same as ‘iron ore’, and much 
weirder to treat ‘admission’ process as equivalent 
to ‘buying’ process.   The idea is not to treat them 
as same but similar, and take advantage of such 
similarities into coding of the core part of ERP. 
Indeed, this is the essence of OOAD approach, 
exploiting the concepts of encapsulation, inheri-
tance, and polymorphism.   Going further, we can 
recognize and account for ‘procurement costs’ 
[all costs incurred to bring in the best student; 
all costs incurred to bring in the best iron ore], 
‘conversion costs’ [costs incurred in training the 
student; costs incurred in converting iron ore 
into steel], measuring costs against standards 
and reporting variances and so on.  Note these 
cover other functional processes as well, such as 
‘production’, ‘costing’, and ‘accounting’.   
If we are able to capture, in this particular 
example, the steps and sequences of the processes 
as  input to output conversion specifications, and 
have code to execute such specifications, then we 
have ‘neutrality’ built into the code.   Of course, 
externally, as part of user interface we have to 
provide for ‘aliases’, and also internally, as part 
of database management system, we have to build 
appropriate querying and manipulating code.  In 
other words, we are designing and building code, 
to accept and act according to specifications of 
the modules in a generic manner around what 
are internally known as resources, and not pro-
cesses as defined or understood by analysts,.  The 
responsibility to specify rests with the user, while 
the responsibility for proper design and code to 
implement rests with the designer/ developer.  A 
strategic implication here is that knowledgeable 
key users become part of designer/developer 
group. The SDC team was able to evolve a utility 
featuring these capabilities, and use it in ‘creating 
the architecture’.    
Essentially, the above methodology implies that 
the user, or a small group of users, well informed 
on the processes, will be helped to define/specify 
both visually and textually, the functionalities 
in terms of inputs, processes, and outputs, and a 
utility created for this purpose enables building/as-
sembly of the ERP as the specification proceeds. 
Known as ‘meta specification’ or ‘architecture 
specification’, this concept is not new, but its appli-
cation is, and not widely reported. Indeed, service 
oriented architecture [SOA] (Wikipedia, 2007)6 
emphasizes this approach, and a few companies 
have come up with their own approaches, tools 
and techniques, e.g.,  EnterpriseTenFold2007® 
from TenFold Corporation, USA, featuring Ajax 
[another emerging technology component to 
expedite creation and deployment of rich user 
interface] capabilities (TenFold, 2007)7. Another 
example is IBM’s Rational Rose® (TechRepublic, 
2007).8 Some CASE [computer aided software 
engineering] tools and OOAD approaches using 
Unified Modeling Language  (Tsang et al, 2005)9 
have also been mentioned in literature, claiming 
not only quicker development of robust software, 
but also superiority in approach and results over 
others.  
The main difference in our experience is that 
we tried to apply these ideas in creating a utility 
in-house to facilitate ‘industry-neutral’ ERP, and 
any interested designer/developer can try, develop 
and adopt similar approach and utilities.     Once 
tested and tried well over time, such utilities and 

  297
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
tools can help expedite the process of building [or 
assembling as it were] an enterprise-appropriate 
ERP much faster and with fewer doubts about its 
capabilities.  The only hitch as of now is such tools 
may be specific to the integrated development 
environment [IDE], and even then the one we 
built applied very well for CC. SDMES adopted 
another variation and came up with an add-in 
named ‘Info Store’ which enables the user to 
create even data types, and therefore data stores 
[tables in the database] of their choice.
One word of caution is called for here.   It is 
possible, and inevitable, that some specific core 
processes [especially the technical processes as 
applicable to manufacturing systems] may call 
for special interfaces to be in place and therefore 
require specific extra coding.   Subject to this 
rider, the advantages of building such a utility in 
the applicable environment first yields certainly 
CTQ advantages for the designer/developer, and 
by extension to the enterprise.
The reader may have observed that the fore-
going also implies a degree of ‘customisability’. 
However, we differentiate ‘customisability’ from 
‘genericity’ in that the latter stands for ‘architec-
ture’ that incorporates some fundamental abstract 
core code capable of accepting and acting as 
per specifications about functional modules/pro-
cesses that make up that architecture’ while the 
former stands for ‘module behavior at all sub 
levels of user interface, including formatting of 
inputs and outputs, procedure specification’ as 
desired by the user.                 
Using a tool combined into the utility referred 
to earlier, CC could improve the ‘customisability’ 
of URCIS, and expedite the process of building 
and releasing it. This tool essentially captures 
user interfaces for every input-output-process of 
every module incorporated into the ERP, and au-
tomates the generation of functional code. A quick 
comparison of time and effort pre- and post-tool 
scenario convinced us that developer productiv-
ity increased at least by 5-7 times. For instance, 
as against 1-2 days taken by a coder for coding 
one complex user interface comprising one input 
form and one output document, referring to two 
tables, the tool enabled the same coder to finish 
three such sets in a day. More over, a number of 
cosmetic features and preferences could be set 
by the user himself.   K
Key Learning
The first and most important lesson learnt that 
the people and process related factors are very 
important, not only pre-ERP but also during 
ERP phases. Both top management involvement 
and critical user group involvement from the 
beginning matter a great deal.   As noted earlier, 
top management involvement accompanied by a 
‘business like’ attitude and ‘demanding’ approach 
quickened the deliverables from one project.
The second is that the ‘customisability’ at 
the hands of the user shifts the responsibility for 
‘successful adoption’ to the user from the designer/
developer.  This has some strategic implications 
as well in expediting adoption.
The third point learnt is that bold and innova-
tive ideas must be encouraged and the environment 
should support trials and failures.   Although 
such trials and failures may cause initially delay 
and doubts about outcome, persistence guided 
by proper professional advice will yield positive 
results. The utility and tool created from the 
projects, yielding ‘industry-neutrality’ at the core 
module level, and ‘customisability’ at the user-
interface levels, stand testimony to this. These 
are also helping the organisations concerned to 
gain and secure CTQ advantage.
Finally, BPR as a process pre or during ERP 
to bring about CTQ advantage did not have much 
applicability in compliance and statutory func-
tional processes.   Again, educational institutions 
bound by external agencies [like university or 
government] had much less scope than business 
organisations to apply BPR.

Our empirical study has put much less emphasis on 
certain other aspects of information system per se. 
These include: security both in Intra- and Internet 
environments, processing power of servers and the 
application overhead on them, disaster recovery 
& business continuity planning [DRBCP], and 
BPR. This is not to say that these are any less 
important, but the point is that limited attention 
has been so far paid to these because of the priority 
and pressures attached to the building the basic 
bloc of ERP.  Plans are afoot to take security and 
DRBCP issues into the software.   
The second aspect is that further empirical 
evidence and follow up research as well as survey 
on similar experiments are needed to validate our 
conclusions. Some key questions are:
•	
Are there factors/barriers beyond CTQ? 
For instance, does size matter?
•	
How can organisations ensure continuous 
CTQ advantage?
•	
How can organisations deal with knowledge, 
the emerging differentiator, and its manage-
ment?
While current literature has covered some 
aspects of these questions, the newer technolo-
gies and innovations [virtual organisations, nano 
technologies, and knowledge society] pose enor-
mous scope for work and better understanding 
of their implications on running businesses and 
organisations effectively.
C NCLCUSIONSI
While ERP, as an enterprise-wide integrative 
information system, has been well recognized as 
the most important business enabler by business 
enterprises and even by not-for-profit organisa-
tions, its adoption by the latter has been restricted 
mainly by cost, time, and quality concerns. 
Although these concerns dominate both pre and 
during ERP phases, we have mainly focused on 
the cost and time aspects in pre-ERP phase, on 
the premise that cost and time for acquiring [or 
custom-building] an appropriate ERP have been 
high.   
Based on the experiences gained and lessons 
learnt from two ERP software development proj-
ects in India, we conclude that:
•	
It is possible to build and re-build ERP in 
timeframes much shorter and at costs sig-
nificantly lower than what ‘packages’ market 
offers today;  
•	
 It is also possible to incorporate ‘industry-
neutrality’ and high degree of ‘customis-
ability’ into ERP; 
We also believe that:
•	
The experiments conducted and experiences 
recorded would be useful for both organisa-
tions contemplating adoption of ERP, and 
also for designer/developer/ vendor groups 
working in this area.
•	
It should now be possible for a large number 
of enterprises and organisations to build 
and adopt appropriate-ERP at much shorter 
timeframes and lower costs, by using a com-
bination of current tools and technologies 
available from Open Source, innovatively 
applied OOAD approach and automation 
utilities, and fully exploiting Internet and 
Web technologies; 
•	
Top management support and commitment, 
manifesting in formal and informal com-
munications to users about the need for and 
importance of adopting ERP, is a critical fac-
tor in improving the quality dimension.
•	
Preparing the people is also an equally 
important factor in ensuring smooth and 
quick adoption of ERP.   

  299
Designing to Deploying Customisable ERP Cost Effectively
•	
BPR has a limited role and application when 
it comes to compliance adherence and re-
porting functions.
Further follow up research and surveys to 
assess the validity of some of the conclusions 
presented here, would be of immense value to 
business enterprises and organisations aspiring 
to acquire/adopt ERP,  as well as designer/devel-
oper groups.R

K Y TERMSTRS
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): A 
set of software [computer] programs, capable of 
running on and linking computers and comput-
ing devices [PCs, PDAs, mobile phones, bar code 
readers, POS machines, CNC machines], regard-
less of their make, model, and numbers; across 
offices, production floors, plants, warehouses, 
regardless of their location; in real time and on-
line mode; integrating  all ‘business processes’ 
[BPs] across functional areas like marketing, 
sales, logistics, production, quality assurance, 
materials, stores, maintenance, accounting and 
finance, human resource… automating as many 
‘BPs’ as feasible; through a common data base; 
for the unified purposes of… optimised enterprise 
wide resource usage.
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): The sum of 
investments made up to the current time on ERP-
assets [e.g., hardware, software licence/media, 
security and so on, all attributable to ERP and 
all of a long-lasting nature] acquired/developed/ 
replaced/upgraded over time by the enterprise, 
adjusted for accumulated depreciation and tax 
concessions on such assets up to that time.   All 
expenses including costs of procurement, instal-
lation and commissioning of all ERP-assets of 
amortizable nature would be included in TCO, 
duly amortized.    Invariably, TCO is treated as 
‘cumulative investment net of depreciation’ and 
so shown in the books of accounts as ‘assets’ as 
on the time of ascertainment.

Symbolically, 
            t
TCOt   =  ∑  (TCOi    -  Depreciationi ) 
    	  i = 0
where 
TCOt   =  Total Cost of Ownership [ERP-assets] 
at current time ‘t’;
TCOi   =   Total Cost of Ownership [ERP-assets] at 
time ‘i’ preceding current time; [ i  <= t ]. i.e., 
ERP assets = Cost of (hardware + software li-
cence/media + security +...acquired/ replaced/ 
upgraded) at time ‘i’; Depreciationi   = Deprecia-
tion applicable to time ‘i’.
All expenses including costs of procurement, 
installation and commissioning of all ERP-assets 
of amortizable nature would be included in TCO, 
duly amortized.  By rearranging the ‘time’ part, 
one can derive TCO values both as  ‘projected’ 
to be part of initial evaluation of ERP- invest-
ment, and as ‘actual’ to be used for monitoring 
the ERP-usage. 
Total Cost of Operations (TCOP): Defined 
as the sum of expenditure incurred periodically 
[usually per annum] and measured during any 
point in time in such period, on maintenance of 
ERP-assets and supportive resources/services. 
These include: hardware, software licence/media 
maintenance/upgrade fees, salaries to IT staff, 
ongoing training to staff, consultants fee, security 
drills and upkeep, and so forth, all of ‘recurring’ 
nature, non-amortizable, and  attributable to ERP. 
Invariably, TCOP is treated as ‘recurring expen-
diture’ and written off in the books of accounts 
pertaining to the period to which it belongs by 
a charge on the surplus [or income] earned.  If 
there is no surplus, then it would appear as ‘cash 
loss’ or ‘accumulated loss’ and effectively reduce 
the capital.   In other words, TCOP would be 0 at 
the beginning and at its highest at the end of the 
period of ascertainment.
Defined as follows:
Symbolically,
TCOPt   = Total Cost of Operations [ERP-related] 
at current time ‘t’;
Cost of (maintenance of hardware + software 
licence/media, salaries to IT staff + ongoing 
training to staff + consultants fee + security drills 
and upkeep...and so forth, all of ‘revenue’ nature, 
attributable to ERP)
System/Software Development Life Cycle 
(SDLC): Refers to the apparently cyclical phases 
of analysis, design, development, testing, and 
deployment of an information system and/or 
software thereof.   There are some variations in 
literature in the nomenclature and also the very 
cyclic nature of these phases, referred to as models 
[waterfall, spiral] and approaches [rapid develop-
ment, joint development] and so on.
Cost, Time, and Quality (CTQ): Stands for 
three key dimensions along which enterprises 
measure their competence and effectiveness in 
their environments by the impact they can create 
on customer, product, service, and other stake 
holders.  
Open Source Standards (OSS): Inclusively 
refer to the large number of software ideas, pro-
grams, utilities, tools, systems, applications, pack-
ages, and so on,  including standards, available 
mainly via Internet, almost for no or low cost on 
the terms and conditions of GPL [general public 
license] intended to guarantee freedom to share 
and change free software in its ‘source’ [human 
readable and understandable] format.
Object Oriented Analysis and Design 
(OOAD): refers to the approach and orientation 
employed in SDLC for analysis, design, and de-

  301

velopment of software, treating the software more 
as a collection of classes and objects [anything 
and everything] and  the running of software as 
the manifestation of exchange of messages among 
objects and responses by objects in behavioral 
changes [methods]
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA): A 
reference to the emerging paradigm shift in the 
way software is available on/from the Internet, 
incorporating features of inter-operability among 
operating systems, data base management sys-
tems and browsers, treating and serving incom-
ing demands as ‘request for service’ on some 
formats commercially viable to all the parties 
concerned.

The terms ES and ERP are used interchange-
ably in the literature.  Indeed, Wikipedia, the 
World Wide Web encyclopedia, [accessed 
15 June 2007], redirects definition requests 
for ‘ES’ to ‘ERP’, using ‘integration’ as one 
of the key common threads.  For a similar 
consideration of cost being a key common 
concern, we regard ‘enterprise’ and ‘organi-
sation’ as interchangeable.

This chapter introduces the ERP systems, their complexity, and especially their integration in higher 
education as a significant challenge for many institutions. Information society paradigm, globalization, 
and the rapidly changing environment affect the contents and organization of higher education. In the 
always-conservative academic world, the organizational structure is very hierarchical and the knowl-
edge transfer is fragmented. The real-world requirements are just the opposite; there is a vast demand 
for students and professionals having the ability of integration, cooperation, and knowledge absorption. 
During the last years, European Countries went through an intensive development and changing phase 
in which the experiences of transition and coping with the information society requirements mixed up. A 
way to develop training programs in the higher education on an integrated ERP platform from regional 
perspective is also illustrated in the chapter.
Inoduon
Integrating ERP systems in higher education has 
been a major challenge for nearly ten years now. 
The tremendous complexity of ERP systems 
posed a significant challenge for many institu-
tions. As Roseman (2004) said, from 1997 a wider 
integration of ERP systems in the curricula of 
Business, Information Technology/Information 
Systems and Engineering schools could be glob-
ally observed. 

  303
ERP Systems in Higher Education from Regional Perspective
ERP systems education is an area demanding 
special attention for a number of reasons. Students 
have a strong interest in this subject hoping to 
gain market driven skills. While this often en-
sures high attendance, student perceptions and 
expectations must be managed carefully, in that 
it is not the objective of such initiatives strictly 
to enhance student skills via training activities. 
Managing ERP systems is typically comprehen-
sive and complex. The frequency of upgrades 
and innovations from one software release to the 
next characterizes the rapidly evolving nature 
of these IS solutions. It is often difficult for the 
lecturer to stay abreast of these changes and to 
understand the implications of these changes to 
business practice, and to research and educa-
tion, in general. By the time current textbooks 
of satisfying quality are available, there are new 
systems’ upgrades and innovation cycles to deal 
with (Roseman, 2004).
Most of the market-leading Enterprise Systems 
vendors established University Alliances with 
regional relationship managers. These alliance 
programs have enabled curriculum innovations 
at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels of-
ten under a certain subject, such as Information 
Systems (IS). A number of academics contributed 
to the area of ERP systems education with case 
studies (Roseman, 2004).  
While implementing these new technologies 
a lot of changes in business processes have to be 
made; ERP implementation is impossible with-
out process reengineering and BPM (Business 
Process Management). ERP will support or even 
automate the whole supply chain. Geographical 
differences will be reduced and enterprises will 
procure/sell goods from suppliers/buyers located 
anywhere in the world. From this point of view 
regional perspective is very important.
he  Evoluon
of ERPR 
SYSTEMSyem
An enterprise’s success is related to the speed 
with which it can respond to changes in its busi-
ness environment and create value for its chosen 
market space. Today it is almost impossible to 
run a competitive business without a computer-
ized information system. The rapidly increasing 
use of the web has changed the manner in which 
business is done in almost all organizations. 
Computer-based information systems in con-
junction with web applications are enhancing 
competitiveness and creating strategic advantage 
to organizations. 
Providing a computerized solution to a busi-
ness problem may require integrating a lot of 
information systems. ERP (Enterprise Resources 
Planning) systems are one of the most popular 
enterprise applications, and present a new model 
of enterprisewide computing. (Figure 1) They 
allow enterprises to replace their legacy systems 
with a single, integrated system, in which it is 
possible to plan and manage the use of the re-
sources of an entire enterprise. We can say that 
ERP is a structured approach to optimizing an 
enterprise’s internal value chain (Norris et al., 
2000). What ERP really does is organize, codify, 
and standardize an enterprise’s business processes 
and data. The software transforms transactional 
data into useful information and collates the data 
so that it can be analyzed. In this way, all of the 
collected transactional data becomes informa-
tion that enterprises can use to support business 
decision-making (Norris et al., 2000). The main 
benefits are the increased efficiency, the improved 
quality, productivity, and profitability and they 
require major changes to organizational, cultural, 
and business processes.
ERP systems cover the core activities of the 
firm (e.g., accounting, finance, manufacturing, 
human resources). In these traditional functional 

304  
ERP Systems in Higher Education from Regional Perspective
areas repetitive tasks exist that are essential to the 
operation of the organization. ERP solutions are 
centered on business transactions. The informa-
tion system that automates manual computations 
is called the transaction processing system (TPS) 
(Claybrook, 1992; Subrahmanyam, 1999; Wallace 
& Kremzar, 2001).
The more powerful ERP developments im-
prove decision making. These systems support 
access, organize, summarize and display informa-
tion for repetitive decision making and managers 
in the functional areas. Such applications are called 
functional management information systems 
(MIS) (Koory, 1987; McLeod ,1990).
Some ERP systems also support office work-
ers (office automation system - OAS), people 
working in groups in different locations (group 
support system – GSS), robotics and computer-
aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) 
(Palaniswamy, 2000).
Most ERP vendors add business intelligence 
functionalities to their applications. Computerized 
support to complex, no routine decision (deci-
sion support system – DSS) and all managers 
in the enterprise (executive information system 
– EIS) are built into these systems (Dutta, 1997; 
Turban, 1990).
The new generation of ERP systems are the 
ERP II systems - the integration of ERP, customer 
relationship management (CRM) , knowledge 
management (KM) and data warehousing (DW) 
and data mining (DM) with e-business. This is 
of a great importance. In this new model e-com-
merce not only refers to buying and selling, but 
is also about enhanced productivity, reaching 
new customers, and sharing knowledge across 
institutions for competitive advantage (Davenport 
& Prusak, 1998; Gray, 2001).
To handle such a large and complex application 
ERP vendors started to break up their systems 
into individual components. Componentization 
helps the vendors to enhance their solutions and 
the customers to customize and upgrade the 
software (Johnson, 2000).

ERP Systems in Higher Education from Regional Perspective
as in the past. To meet rapidly changing business 
needs, enterprises have to find ways to implement 
most or parts of ERP systems in a matter of months, 
not years. Knowledge sharing is a critical activity 
for a rapid implementation (Shields, 2001). 
ERP complexity knowledge transmission 
combines two fields of knowledge. The first part 
deals with ERP Systems adoption and the second 
one captures business process knowledge. This 
leads us to the conclusion that we can not educate 
our students without their direct connection with 
practical work in enterprises (Figure 2) (Rose-
man, 2004). The students regard gaining practical 
experience as a key success factor for learning 
ERP systems.
The benefit of incorporating ERP systems into 
curricula through process analysis is to expose 
students to important concepts of ERP systems 
and their business process focus. ERP systems 
enable today’s enterprises to transform themselves 
from a functional orientation towards a business 
process orientation. Therefore, one of the main 
reasons to introduce ERP systems into curricula 
is to expose students to how business processes 
extend across the enterprise and the enterprise’s 
information value chain. Students need to gain 
a broader understanding of the strategic goals of 
an enterprise and the business processes that sup-
port these goals. Students should be aware of the 
problems enterprises experience as they undertake 
a major ERP system implementation and how, 
as a business or systems professional, they can 
help minimize threats to successful projects. As 
students interact with the vendor-provided data-
base (IDES in Sap is such system) that serves as 
a hypothetical enterprise, they can see first-hand 
how complex and truly integrated these systems 
are (Bradford et al., 2003 pp.437-456).
In this kind of teaching we are talking about the 
LivingLab concept (Bjørn-Andersen et al 2007; 
Boutellier et al. 2007, p. 10; Frößler et al. 2007)). 
The objective of the Living Lab is to develop a 
multi-disciplinary research and testing platform 
concentrating on the immediate environment 
from the user point of view. The Living Lab 
aims at addressing two questions: What do the 
users want? How it can be produced? Research 
activities include developing design-on-demand, 
mass-customization and co-configuration solu-
tions for generating individual domestic environ-
ments. Furthermore, the challenge is to create 
an operational model of cooperation between 
enterprises, government agencies, and universi-
ties. With the Living Lab concept we can arrange 
a strong connection between practice, research and 
education. Living Labs are open to enterprises

corresponding laboratories in order to support 
the European diversity better.  In these days the 
European Union launched Living Lab Open In-

development of Living Lab services towards a new 
European Innovation Infrastructure and the first 
step towards a new innovation system. We can talk 
about creating a network of Living Labs around 
Europe (www.cdt.ltu.se/~zcorelabs). Based on this 
Living Lab concept also the following ERP and 
e-commerce teaching case is presented.
ERP ARND E-COMMERCECRC 
T ACHING CASECICS
At the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, Uni-
versity of Maribor, we transfer the knowledge 
of ERP systems through the following subjects: 
Information Systems, Organizational Process 
Design, eCommerce and Information System 
Project. We are trying to connect strongly all our 
teaching process to the real life problems inside 
and between enterprises (Podlogar & Basl, 2006). 
It is also important to have most of the new in-
formation technology (MySAP ERP, Oracle EBS, 
MS Navision, RFID technology and others) in our 
labs for students experimenting.
  At our faculty, ERP teaching is executed 
by use of different ERP systems for hands-on 
experiences and through students’ prototype 
development projects for use in interested en-
terprises. Students present results from seminar 
papers and prototypes to these enterprises. This 
new information creates opportunities for enter-
prises to achieve competitive advantage by using 
ERP systems and their integration through the 
supply chain.
In all cases students first form project teams 
that consist of three students. Then they go to an 
enterprise and investigate a problem inside the 
process, which is proposed by their subscriber 
from an enterprise.
In our ERP teaching case students analyze the 
real life process. Usually a procurement and/or 
selling process as one of the key business processes 
in each enterprise. This is a reason that have been 
usually used these two processes for our teaching 
cases (Podlogar 2007). Problems inside the process 
and then try to find suggestions/solutions, how 
to implement ERP system successfully into the 
chosen process in practical environment. Students 
work out different prototypes as a result of the 
seminar. Parallel with work at the enterprise and 
prototype developing, students also have lectures, 
where they get theoretical knowledge about the 
understanding of IS development methods, IS ele-
ments and the use of information technology for 
better organizational effectiveness (Figure 3).

The departmental organization of teaching in the 
higher education is fairly atomized. Controlling 
professor teaches controlling, accounting profes-
sor teaches accounting, etc. The students learn 
different terminology, different concepts, they get 
different practical assignments. There is always 
a challenge to see the interconnections among 
logistics, accounting, controlling and many other 
aspects of the management.
The advantage of using an advanced integrated 
information system behind the formal academic 
teaching is inevitable. The main goal is to provide 
a coherent and consistent background to the sev-
eral departments to integrate the education and 
the knowledge.
It is widely known how the SAP core system 
is composed. For educational purposes not only 
the implementation but also the complex busi-
ness reference model has to be observed. This 
knowledge can be transferred to the academic 

  307
ERP Systems in Higher Education from Regional Perspective
environment, so it could confront with theories. 
The complexity and the integrity of the system 
make the SAP capable of helping the education in 
every field of the corporate management. Students 
get familiar with the state-of-the art information 
technology, architecture and business solution. 
SAP establishes the opportunity for students to 
enrich and enlarge their knowledge - acquainted 
during lectures - in practical seminars. It also 
allows them to conduct practical experiments in 
different economy related fields. 
The application of modern techniques, tech-
nologies and theories, the continuous development 
of the system raises SAP to one of the leaders 
of the corporate information system market. In 
accordance with it, another advantage of apply-
ing SAP in education is, that as a consequence 
of software upgrading, the contents of subjects 
- taught at the university - also have to be updated, 
therefore they are more likely to keep up with the 
newest achievements. As the result of the synthesis 
of theoretical and practical education, SAP raises 
the education indisputably to a higher level. 
If the curricula are different the practical as-
signments will help the students to integrate the 
knowledge with the help of the common platform. 
(Figure 4) Students like the idea to learn different 
subjects in the same environment (not mentioning 
the fact, that they learn only once how to navi-
gate in the system and they can use that “many” 
times.) The advantages of the co-operation are 
indisputable.
It is also an issue what type of practical as-
signment would serve the educational purposes 
best on this complex platform. We offer the three-
layer application:
•	
Demonstration
•	
Problem solving application
•	
Major case study
Demonstration aims mainly illustration. The 
students’ participation is passive, the teacher 
shows/demonstrates functions – in a fully opera-
tional environment. Sometimes the explanation of 
the environment is longer and more complicated 
than the illustrated function itself. Therefore 
it assumes well-trained teachers, and effective 
support.

Problem solving application: Smaller as-
signments to the students, but the students work 
independently and actively. Part of the course is 
in-group; part of it needs individual efforts. Stu-
dents usually apply their knowledge and it is not 
a goal to modify or develop the system.
Major case studies usually lead to the thesis 
work and they can be equivalent with an elective 
subject as well. There are a big variety of topics, 
as quality management, workflow management, 
and project management. A deeper understanding 
of the system is assumed and the creative applica-
tion is a core requirement. Implementing a case 
study also goes with a major help of the system 
administrator. It is the responsibility of the depart-
ments to assign any kind of assignment; the only 
“plus” is a slight horizontal co-ordination.
The real added value comes from the op-
portunity of development of new courses. The 
already running courses can be upgraded from 
the process-oriented view to the more complex 
problem-solving view. New areas can also be 
investigated such as IT audit, which is a nice 
and interesting combination of management ac-
counting, controlling, information technology 
and information management. The other new 
features of the development lead to real execu-
tive programs.
The focus in BCE  (Corvinus University of 
Budapest ) is on providing knowledge on finance, 
accounting, controlling and information manage-
ment in order to facilitate executives (students) 
to give a solid foundation of their decisions. The 
Information Manager postgraduate course should 
be a good example. 
Besides ERP knowledge transmission from 
practice to teaching, the knowledge integration 
on an integrated platform also has to be achieved. 
The following knowledge integration on an inte-
grated platform is described on the basis of the 
case that is taken from the ten years practice at 
the Corvinus University of Budapest, Hungary. 
Courses are being held on controlling, corporate 
finance, information management, workflow man-
agement, and recently we are dealing with business 
objects and services created from SAP functions 
(these business functions could be anything from 
transaction processing to decision support analysis

to resource planning) in order to facilitate SOA 
integration. At the faculty also new courses on 
BPM are executed. ARIS methods and solutions 
are preferred because of ARIS integration into 
the Netweaver Platform.

EDUCATION COCTICLLABORATIONBRTI
The next step further is that this common plat-
form supplies integrated education not only in 
co-operation with the different departments, but 
with other universities as well. The inter-organi-
zational co-operation cannot be restricted to the 
Hungarian or Slovenian higher education, but this 
is the frame for an international co-operation as 
well. In the US the SAP Alliance program is an 
option. In Europe there are plenty of opportuni-
ties under the frame of SAP support activities and 
other European programs (e.g. LLP/ERASMUS). 
Two further types of international collaboration: 
Excellence Center and International Network 
- “eBusiness ALADIN” are described. 
Excellence Center C
Officially the SAP Excellence Center was an-
nounced on 27th of August 1999, during the most 
important IT conference in higher education, 
in Debrecen. Professionals, responsible for IT 
education got acquainted with the Excellence 
Center idea and services, and from that moment 
they could join an open platform for co-opera-
tion. Technical universities, colleges, (the actual 
number of the participants is more than ten) agreed 
in joint development of curricula, joint develop-
ment and exchange of teaching material, also in 
joint teaching activities. The latter mentioned is 
a great challenge itself, since the combination of 
a web based technology with a web based on line 
teaching is not a trivial task.
Of course, on the one hand every university 
would like to have its own system. On the other 
hand the maintenance and administration of a 
complete system is very costly. Therefore the 
partners like the idea of the virtual university SAP 
center. (Figure 5). Costs could be saved, while 
through the academic network the participants 
reach the server and many of the services (help

desk, promotion campaign, upgrades, not talking 
about the advantages of knowledge sharing).
Main task groups of the Excellence Center:
1.	
Implementation and maintenance of the 
modules of the SAP system.
2.	
Educational support:
•	
Design and operate the “Teach-the-
Teacher” program. The courses pre-
pare the applicant teachers to be able 
to insert the SAP modules into the 
curriculum of their academic course. 
In the first period the program consists 
of a few one-day intro-courses, later 
three-day standard-courses per mod-
ules 
•	
Invitation and co-ordination of SAP 
thesis topics. Providing and organizing 
continuous consultation
•	
Composing curriculum and/or estab-
lishing connection to existing curricu-
lum, that are needed for self-training 
and help deepening SAP knowledge
3.	
Establishing the Higher Education Club 
(HEC)
•	
Organization of workshops with in-
vited guests
•	
Organization of conferences in order 
to demonstrate results, discuss experi-
ences
4.	
Help Desk
•	
Design and implementation of Help 
Desk functions 
•	
Access of WEB services for entitled 
users
5.	
User and system administration
Fast and effective communication is an es-
sential requirement in terms of the collabora-
tion and the operation of the Excellence Center. 
Communication is of vital importance regarding 
to the integration as well. After evaluating the 
possibilities, we decided to use the Internet as the 
main communication channel of the Excellence 
Center. Advantages: fast, cheap, widely used in 
the academic world, flexible. The communication 
system, as the part of the whole Excellence Center, 
has to be developed in conjunction with the whole 
system. As the system gets more complex and more 
integrated, the communication subsystem has to 
become more complex and integrated as well. 
According to this, now the Corvinus University 
of Budapest, Hungary, and the Faculty of Organi-
zational Sciences, University of Maribor, Slovenia, 
have set up the newest Netweaver Platform. For 
both universities also, the actual SAP IDES ver-
sion is in use. The IDES is an already installed 
and parameterized training system.
International Network - “eBuBsiness 
ALADIN” I
To achieve successful education on the field of 
ERP systems implementation we need to assure 
teaching and practice collaboration and knowl-
edge integration.
To succeed this goal we need to cooperate 
with other universities all around the world. The 
idea is to make an innovative international col-
laboration on the field of e-Integration Research 
& Teaching in the Region. Based on this idea in 
Slovenia we established an international network 
“eBusiness ALADIN” – ALpe ADria Initiative 
(www.Aladin.units.it) at regional level, that means 
sharing common ideas and knowledge in teaching 
and research activities in the field of e-commerce. 
The Aladin was established in Bled on June 5th 
2005.  Nine countries: Karl-Franzens University 
Graz (Austria), University of Rijeka (Croatia), 
Prague University of Economics (Czech Republic), 
University BW München (Germany), Corvinus 
University of Budapest (Hungary), University of 
Trieste (Italy), Novi Sad Business School (Serbia & 
Montenegro, today Serbia), Technical University 
of Košice (Slovakia) and University of Maribor 
(Slovenia) desiring to strengthen the friendship 
and cooperation between them, recognizing the 
importance of developments in e-Integration, 

  311
ERP Systems in Higher Education from Regional Perspective
particularly in e-Business, e-Geomatics, e-Gov-
ernment, e-Health, e-Learning and e-Logistics, 
and in all the applications of the Information & 
Communication Technology (ICT) for the benefits 
of the European Citizens. As already successfully 
experimented in the ALADIN network, common 
ideas and knowledge in teaching and research 
activities have been shared, cooperating to cre-
ate mobility of students and professors, offering 
common lectures and educational programs, 
creating virtual teams of students from different 
Universities and professors lecturing at different 
Universities, promoting research cooperation with 
SMEs and Governments, in order to harmonize 
with global and international activities of ICT in 
the Enlarged Europe.
Through joint teaching at different universi-
ties and strong connections with practice, the 
teaching of ERP and e-commerce systems will 
become more effective and more understandable 
to students, lecturers and business.
FUTURE TRENDSTRTRS
As IT systems have grown exponentially, tradi-
tional architectures have reached the limit of their 
capabilities; enterprises have been left to handle 
increasingly complex software architectures. 
But corporate management still needs to respond 
quickly to new business requirements, continu-
ally reduce the cost of IT to the business, and 
absorb and integrate new business partners and 
customers. The software industry has improved 
multiple computing architectures designed to al-
low fully distributed processing. Programming 
languages are designed to run on any platform 
and greatly reduce implementation schedules. And 
it has developed a huge amount of connectivity 
architectures designed to allow better and faster 
integration of applications. 
Now, service oriented architecture (SOA) is 
the next evolutionary step. Just as the object-ori-
ented development paradigms forced the power 
of code reuse, SOA allows business analysts and 
IT architects to access the power of reusing au-
tomated business services (Carter, 2007). Once 
process designers have direct access to reusable 
automated business services, their focus can shift 
to making more sophisticated use of process 
architectures and continuous improvement of 
those processes.
Software development as a whole has been 
evolving to improve the flexibility of business 
applications. The new standards and application 
platforms dramatically simplified the development 
of applications. Instead of designing an entire 
monolithic application these platforms provided 
the basic application structures in a pre-built 
fashion, giving opportunity to focus on the value-
added portions of the applications.
A competitive enterprise has to adapt core 
value-added processes with unprecedented speed, 
to act appropriately regardless of the situation 
(Sprott, 2004). For this perfectly designed and 
continuously improved process models must be 
implemented in the real world with real employees 
interacting with real software applications which 
must be integrated with real integration platforms. 
Modern BPM suites are evolving to automate the 
modeling, monitoring and redesign of complex, 
collaborative processes to achieve these goals 
(Carter, 2007).
BPM and SOA together mean the next phase of 
business process evolution from merely automat-
ing repeatable processes to flexible automation of 
dynamic processes (Noel, 2005).
SAP is active participant in SOA and BPM 
world following the leading philosophy and 
technology. The Netveawer platform links SAP 
to the e-business platform components as the 
business models of ARIS for SAP connect SAP 
functionalities into e-business processes. With 
these capabilities we can develop not only our 
courses but our collaborational level. We can 
connect our business processes from SAP on a 
higher technical level.

Conluon
Being learning institutions, the mission of our 
universities is to identify, to create and to transfer 
the business need, the collaborative environment, 
knowledge sharing schemas, to our customers 
– students and enterprises, as effectively and as 
much as we can. We need to transfer knowledge 
from practice to teaching as applicable as we can, 
taking into consideration the knowledge integra-
tion on an integrated platform.
From our point of view ERP systems afford 
a unique opportunity to learn concepts through 
process analysis. In an ideal situation, when ERP 
is implemented and integrated across courses, 
students are able to visualize the business process 
view of enterprise, identify and eliminate non-
value added activities, and enrich value added 
processes better. 
Universities have to achieve an innovative in-
ternational collaboration. Running an Excellence 
Center and being a part of the international group 
“eBusiness Aladin” are great challenges for both 
universities: Corvinus University of Budapest, 
Hungary, and Faculty of Organizational Sciences, 
University of Maribor, Slovenia.
The newest technology, which is in line with 
enterprises demand, is needed.  Our universities 
logically follow the leading technology of soft-
ware enterprises, however the business processes 
are significantly differing from a manufacturing 
or commercial enterprise, and even from a ser-
vice enterprise, not mentioning the differences 
between the corporate/organizational cultures. 
Therefore many cases, development issues should 
be handled in a unique way. Gaining and utilizing 
these experiments keep us on track and add value 
to our higher education.R

Abstracta
This chapter provides an overview of past and present development in technical platforms of ERP sys-
tems and its use in enterprises. Taking into consideration the two layers of application and technology, 
we present the classical scenario of an ERP system as a monolithic application block. As the demands 
of modern enterprise software cannot be met by this concept, the shift to a more flexible architecture 
like the service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the current status quo of modern companies. Keeping in 
mind the administrative complexity of such structures, we will discuss the new idea of business Webs. 
The purpose of our chapter is, on the one hand, to show the historical development of ERP system 
landscapes and, on the other hand, to show the comparison of the presented concepts with respect to 
application and technology view.
ITRCTI
With the emergence of the SOA concept, the 
classical architecture of ERP system has started 
to change and is in a constant flux towards new 
structures. We want to show these changes, start-
ing with the architecture of ERP systems and 
describing the different parts of this concept. To 
exemplify it, we will present the most important 
aspects of concrete implementations of these 

  317
From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
principles. As one of the most important ERP 
systems, we will focus on the structure of the 
SAP ERP system and will describe the changes 
of this platform.
Our analysis will comprise of an application-
centered and a technical view, considering changes 
in business paradigms and new technologies that 
enabled new kinds of business and process man-
agement. Starting at classical ERP systems and 
their implementation in SAP R/3, we will move 
on to the current concept of SOA and Enterprise 
SOA. This goes along with a change in technical 
architectures as well. The SAP NetWeaver plat-
form will be presented as an example of complete 
Enterprise SOA platforms. Its most important 
functions will be pointed out and utilizing this 
example, components that are necessary to realize 
Enterprise SOA are identified. The light in which 
SAP NetWeaver is seen has changed in the last 
years as not the technical components are in the 
spotlight anymore but the applications that are 
made possible by such a platform. Finally, we will 
show the future concept of business webs which 
will base on Enterprise SOA and conclude our 
chapter with an outlook to the further develop-
ment in this area of topic. The structure of our 
chapter is illustrated in Figure 1.C
Classical ERP SystemsSSICRSSTS
Classical ERP system can be described as com-
mercial software products that are adaptable to 
company-specific demands. Their typical func-
tional modules include: purchasing, manufactur-
ing, sales, finances, human resources, service 
and in general reporting. Classical ERP systems 
focus on data integration and also support process 
integration within one company.
The technical basis of an ERP system today 
is usually a Client/Server architecture, where 
often more than one application server is con-
nected to the central database server. The user 
of a classical ERP system most time works with 
basic business transactions like “create order”, 
“update customer contact data”, “print invoice”, 
“execute report xy” etc. Changes within such a 
system due to business transactions are usually 
propagated in “business” realtime meaning a few 
seconds or minutes.
The following figure from Davenport visual-
izes the architecture of a classical ERP system. 
In addition to the facts mentioned before, there 
is usually a wide range of reporting functionality 
for management and stakeholders, based on the 
central ERP data.
There are a lot of advantages that unfold with 
the use of ERP Systems (Vogel and Kimbell 
2005; N.N. 2007) In the following a few of them 
are spotlighted:

Despite the possible problems that served as 
expamples, ERP systems can be seen as something 
that Carr calls ubiquity information systems power 
(Carr 2003). Nowadays it is not the question of 
using an ERP System in your company, but how. 
There is also research available describing the 
value of ERP Systems more concretely. See for 
example (Martin, Mauterer et al., 2002).S
SAP R/3 BasisRBSIS
For the discussion of the technology of classical 
ERP systems, we will take a closer look at SAP 
R/3 and the underlying technological platform 
SAP Basis. Since SAP’s application was the first 
enterprise software fulfilling the characteristics

From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
of an ERP system and still represents the leading 
edge in ERP technology, analyzing this product 
provides a complete outline of the past and present 
development in ERP system technology. 
SAP R/2 was the first enterprise application 
integrating functions of different enterprise divi-
sions in one piece of software and thus represent-
ing the first ERP system. It provided functions 
for finance, accounting, human resources, sales, 
procurement, and manufacturing. The system 
ran on mainframe architectures, while its suc-
cessor, R/3, relies on a client server architecture 
and also includes a whole set of new functions. 
(Vogel and Kimbell 2005). Because SAP R/3 for 
a long time was the ERP system, it shall serve as 
our starting point for the detailed analysis of the 
technology layer
Moving from a mainframe structure to the 
client server architecture the technical part of 
the SAP application was divided in a 3-tier land-
scape consisting of the front end tier typically 
running on the user’s desktop, the application 
tier and the database tier. The front end tier is a 
fat client that displays all kinds of screens based 
on small information packages exchanged with 
the application tier. The application tier resides 
on high performance servers and represents the 
application logic and enterprise functionality as 
well as the connection to the database layer. The 
databases used for R/3 have been provided by 
different manufacturers and, with their database 
product SAPDB, also by SAP itself. By dividing 
the technical architecture into these three tiers, it 
became scalable and could be enhanced by adding 
more desktop computers or servers to the tier that 
lacks computational power.
The technical layer of the application tier and 
thus of SAP R/3 systems is called SAP Basis. 
This layer’s characteristics of capital importance 
indclude platform and database independence 
with respect to the interpretation of application 
source code. The code is written in SAP’s pro-
gramming language called Advanced Business 
Application Programming (ABAP). All of SAP’s 
out of the box functions can be viewed in plain 
text, edited (with some limitations) and hence 
also be enhanced. The integrated development 
environment called ABAP workbench can be used 
for these tasks. Providing these possibilities, the 
platform can be adopted in a very flexible way 
to individual needs. In practice however, only 
few modifications are made to the source code 
delivered by SAP because the algorithms represent 
the know-how of many business experts. Framed 
in other words, the implemented algorithms are 
procedures cast into best practices such as how 
to support a specific process at best.
When using SAP R/3 for crucial functions, 
enterprises have a data centralization spanning the 
whole company. Nonetheless SAP R/3 turned out 
to be insufficient for the integration of suppliers 
and customers as well as for performing in-depth 
analysis of business data. Thus new applications 
like SAP Customer Relationship Management 
(CRM), Supplier Relationship Management 
(SCM) or the Business Warehouse (BW) were 
created to meet the growing demands. All these 
new products were based on SAP Basis. This is 
why a highly integrated system landscape could 
be implemented despite the different systems. 
By using the same technical layer, all systems 
can communicate and exchange data very easily 
utilizing the same functions. These functions 
are arranged in a hierarchical structure defined 
by business areas and this way facilitate changes 
and enhancements of business processes. Further-
more, most functions are encapsulated in so called 
function modules which can be called remotely by 
another application like another SAP system or 
a third party product. Therefore communication 
with applications of third party vendors can be 
established within limitations. This packaging 
of functions is also an important step towards a 
service oriented architecture as will be shown 
later (Buck-Emden 1998).
Although the SAP Basis of SAP R/3, as shortly 
presented above, was already quite flexible and 
enabled the communication to other applications 

320  
From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
to and from SAP or third party vendors, the degree 
of integration was limited. There was no complete 
integration of functions and data of different 
applications to create completely new business 
processes across system boundaries. Addition-
ally, changing or enhancing crucial functions or 
processes was very difficult as the dependencies 
between systems and function modules were not 
clearly documented. A fundamental problem of 
this technical layer was also its integration into 
the application layer: SAP Basis could not be used 
without SAP R/3 or other products based on this 
very platform. These issues forced a fundamental 
change to provide a much more flexible technical 
layer for future business applications.
S A and Enterprise SOAS
We will rely on the following definition of a SOA: 
“SOA is an architectural style whose goal is to 
achieve loose coupling among interacting soft-
ware agents. A service is a unit of work done by a 
service provider to achieve desired end results for 
a service consumer. Both provider and consumer 
are roles played by software agents on behalf of 
their owners.“ (He 2003) In addition to this defi-
nition, SOA is characterized by intensive use of 
standards (like SOAP, UDDI, etc.) to implement 
services. But the concept of SOA itself is not 
connected to a technical or business domain. It is 
a concept of how functions can be implemented 
on distributed entities, just like the client-server 
concept or the idea of object orientation (OO). 
Both of the mentioned actually can be related to 
SOA. Services within a SOA could for example 
be implemented using an OO programming 
language. The result could be run technically 
in an environment that follows the client server 
concept. The central components of a SOA are 
shown in Figure 3.
The central element within a SOA is the 
service. Whenever an application wants to use a 
service, it communicates with the service reposi-
tory (for example via UDDI) using the (enterprise) 
service bus as technical backbone. Examples for 
service busses include IBM WebSphere ESB, 
Microsoft biztalk, Oracle ESB and SAP XI.. 
The application front end is used to access the 
network of services.
A service itself consists of an implementation 
describing the business logic and data. Also it is 
formalized by a service contract (i.e. IDL, WSDL) 
and a service interface (i.e. SOAP) (Booth, Haas 
et al., 2004).

From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
Key features of SOA as described by Erl (Erl 
2005) are:
•	
Self-describing: The service can be fully 
described on a formal level; that is, what 
operations are available and which data types 
can be exchanged. Formal self-description 
is the basis for automatically generating 
proxies. Note that in this context the word 
“description” does not refer to the semantic 
description.
•	
Locatable: Potential consumers can locate 
and contact the service. There is a registry 
for this purpose that operates as a “Yellow 
Pages” of services and allows users to search 
for services.
•	
Roughly structured: Services are roughly 
structured when they return comprehensive 
data (for example, a sales order) in response 
to a service call instead of delivering individ-
ual attributes (such as an order quantity).
•	
Loosely linked: Services are said to be 
loosely linked if potential functional changes 
within the services have no effect on the 
availability of operations. Services are 
considered to be independent if they have 
no dependencies on other services i.e. if 
the availability of a service is not affected 
by a potential unavailability or improper 
functioning of any other service.
•	
Reusable: Reusability is one of the most im-
portant and longest-standing requirements 
in software technology. It aims at ensuring 
that components are reused as often as pos-
sible without modification to the functional 
core or interfaces.
Enterprise SOA extends the features of the 
SOA concept with a business view on services. 
Therefore services additionally have the follow-
ing key features:
•	
Services represent business services instead 
of technical services
•	
Support of inter-organizational collaboration 
on a business level
The technical basis of an Enterprise SOA 
today is usually a client-server architecture, 
where many application server and many da-
tabase servers are part of the - often regionally 
distributed - IT-landscape. In contrast to a list of 
basic ERP Transactions, Enterprise SOA offers 
access to high level business processes like “hire 
employee”, “produce good”, “distribute good” 
etc. Seen in this light one might define Enterprise 
SOA as the business glue connecting isolated 
business tasks, such as the previously mentioned 
examples, to comprehensive business processes. 
Working that way, Enterprise SOA opens the 
door to realtime business processes instead of 
realtime transactions.
DIFFEREIRNT VITIS
N SAPS 
NETWTEAVERR
The presented idea of service oriented architec-
tures and its use in an enterprise domain forces 
the need for a technical platform that can enable 
the interaction of the different services. SAP 
developed the currently most complete technical 
layer for Enterprise SOA called SAP NetWeaver. 
NetWeaver is comparable to the SAP R/3 Basis, 
however doess not itself provide any business 
functions but is the technical basis for enterprise 
applications like SAP Enterprise Resource Plan-
ning (ERP) (Woods and Word 2004). Since the 
components of this layer are already a few years 
old, the view on this platform has changed. First 
we will present the classical component based 
view covering the specific technical systems that 
are part of this platform. Afterwards we will show 
the shift from the component based to an applica-
tion based view that does not care anymore about 
technical systems but focuses on the application 
of a set of systems for business purposes.

322  
From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
C mponent Based VBiew on 
NetWeaver
The component based view on SAP NetWeaver is 
also called the “NetWeaver Fridge” because you 
can use specific components of the NetWeaver 
platform just as you can take ingredients from 
your fridge for lunch. This technical fridge con-
sists of four layers representing different aspects 
of an enterprise system landscape as well as 
two cross-functional areas that are used for all 
other products. We can distinguish the layers 
for application platform, process integration, 
information integration and people integration. 
The general areas are life cycle management and 
SAP’s Composite Application Framework (CAF). 
The specific layers combine different software 
products of the SAP portfolio. Thus this view on 
NetWeaver is a rather technical one (Karch, Heilig 
et al., 2005). In Figure 4 you find an overview of 
all layers and their elements at which we want to 
have a closer look.
The application platform consists of three 
elements whereas the DB and OS abstraction is 
an integral part of the two other elements. These 
two elements are the ABAP and the Java core 
of all SAP applications. They are called Web 
Application Server (Web AS) ABAP and Web 
AS Java. Depending on the application that is to 
be executed on the Web AS, either one or both 
cores are used as a runtime environment. The 
SAP NetWeaver Portal for example needs only 
the Java core while SAP Process Integration 
uses both Java and ABAP. The Web AS can also 
be used for technical purposes like monitoring 
without enterprise applications building upon it 
(Heinemann and Rau 2003).
The process integration layer represents the 
elements of an integration broker and of business 
process management which are combined in SAP’s 
product called Process Integration (PI, formerly 
Exchange Infrastructure). The integration broker’s 
task within NetWeaver is the exchange of data 
using different formats and protocols. It can for 
example convert messages sent via FTP in an 
XML format to a message for an SAP function 
module based on one of SAP’s internal protocols. 
Besides this technical conversion, also changes to 
Figure 4. Component based view SAP NetWeaver

  323
From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
the content can be processed such as converting 
the values of the gender (female, male) to values 
for a suitable salutation (Ms, Mr.). Business Pro-
cess Management (BPM), also known as cross-
component BPM (ccBPM), provides functions 
for workflow management across boundaries of 
single enterprise systems. It can help to imple-
ment automated processes by triggering and 
coordinating data exchange between all kinds 
of enterprise systems which can be accessed by 
the integration broker. A business process can 
therefore automatically manage the selection of 
the supplier with the best price after receiving all 
quotations and may subsequently place an order. 
NetWeaver ‘s process integration layer and the 
product of the same name can be regarded as the 
communication backbone of a modern enterprise 
system landscape. It provides centralized func-
tions for data exchange within the landscape and 
with systems in supplier or customer domains.
The information integration layer combines 
three tasks which are arranged in three different 
applications. Master Data Management (MDM) 
and Business Intelligence (BI) can be found in the 
products of the same name while Knowledge Man-
agement (KM) is part of the SAP NetWeaver Portal 
which is part of the subsequent layer. MDM helps 
to consolidate data within an enterprise across 
system boundaries. The same data is often saved 
in different places because of technical reasons. 
In many cases this redundancy can be changed so 
that the data is saved only in one place or at least 
synchronization between different databases can 
be set up. Thus the same data is available in all 
connected systems. Using this correct data proper 
propped business decisions can be made. As the 
amount of data on which decisions are based on 
can be vast, SAP’s Business Intelligence helps to 
arrange and visualize data from different points 
of view. By using SAP’s Strategic Enterprise 
Management (SEM), balanced scorecards can 
be used as an enterprise dash board or manage-
ment cockpit. While MDM and BI are used for 
structured data, KM components help to manage 
unstructured data like files containing differ-
ent kinds of information. As KM is part of the 
NetWeaver Portal it can easily be integrated in 
the front end and therefore in daily work.
In the layer of people integration, three dif-
ferent tasks are combined in 2 applications. On 
the one hand one can identify the multi channel 
access provided by SAP’s Mobile Infrastructure 
(MI). On the other hand there is SAP NetWeaver 
Portal including the tasks of portal, collaboration 
and knowledge management which form the 
information integration layer. This layer hence 
contains applications for end user communication. 
The Mobile Infrastructure provides a client server 
architecture that enables the synchronization of 
data on mobile devices like PDAs or Notebooks 
with the enterprise system landscape. This way 
traveling salesmen have all the data they need to 
help customers place an order. The portal itself 
provides a web based framework for arranging and 
displaying screens and information. Furthermore 
it integrates business process screens providing a 
single point of entry to front ends in the enterprise 
system landscape. It can be used to implement 
flexible wizards working across system bound-
aries. These basic functions can be enhanced by 
synchronous or asynchronous collaboration and 
knowledge management.
The cross function area of life cycle manage-
ment covers all activities for running an appli-
cation in an enterprise system landscape. This 
includes the installation preparation of specific 
applications, customizing activities, monitoring 
and maintenance, upgrade and migration tasks. 
The SAP product supporting these tasks is the 
SAP Solution Manager which provides part of 
these functions as a first step towards the imple-
mentation of ITIL.
As a SOA consists of many different small 
services, an integration layer for coordinating the 
steps within a business process is needed. This 
layer is the Composite Application Framework 
(CAF) which allows the development of appli-
cations based on the underlying services - web 

324  
From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
services or SAP function modules provided by 
SAP applications. The implementation of a persis-
tence layer as well as the design of user interfaces 
are as well part of this development. In order to 
access backend systems, persistence and user in-
terfaces, the appropriate Java source code can be 
generated. This code is running  within the SAP 
NetWeaver Portal providing the connectivity of a 
Web AS Java and the user interface of the portal 
framework. CAF can be used to have professional 
developers generate Java-based applications or 
to quickly implement an adhoc-workflow called 
guided procedure. By relying on other NetWeaver 
products, a new CAF application or a guided pro-
cedure can take advantage of existing functions 
like the connection to third party systems or user 
interface functions.
Application Based VBiew on 
NetWeaver
As we already pointed out, the component based 
view on the NetWeaver fridge is dominated by a 
technical aspect. For most scenarios more than 
one of these products is necessary  to attain the 
goal. Thus the NetWeaver fridge has been cut 
into slices to show that the NetWeaver platform 
does not exist for its own sake, but to enable and 
support different IT practices (see Figure 5).
The result of cutting the NetWeaver fridge 
into slices are 10 IT practices which shall be dis-
cussed now. Each of the practices itself is divided 
into IT scenarios describing concrete activities 
to achieve the target of a scenario, for example 
implementing single sign-on for an application 
or in a whole system landscape (Nicolescu, Funk 
et al., 2006).
1.	
The first IT practice called user productiv-
ity enablement aims at improving the daily 
work of users by providing tools to exchange 
information between them, any by means of 
personalization for an easier access to data 
and business processes. This IT practice 
mainly builds upon the SAP NetWeaver 
Portal.
2.	
The Practice of data unification tries to 
consolidate and harmonize data that is 
stored in different databases all over the 
enterprise. As this task is mainly connected 
in identifying redundancy and keeping data 
in different places synchronous, the vital 
application of this task is the Master Data 
Management (MDM).
3.	
Business information management is an 
important support task for decision makers 
in a company. This practice tries to provide 
structured and unstructured information to 
Figure 5. Shift from component based view to application based view on NetWeaver

  325
From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
make the right decision based on the given 
data. As this combines elements of Business 
Intelligence and Knowledge Management, 
BI and portal are the main components of 
this practice.
4.	
Unlike the business information manage-
ment that provides functions for proactive 
work with business data, the business event 
management works by a Push technology. 
Whenever important events happen in the 
company the relevant people will be in-
formed and can react. Reacting on events is 
abstracted to the necessary data and entry to 
appropriate business transactions for a given 
situation. Main components of this practice 
are again SAP Business Intelligence and 
SAP NetWeaver Portal.
5.	
End-to-end process integration allows the 
implementation and monitoring of business 
processes across system boundaries within a 
company’s own system landscape and with 
systems of business partners. This way, cru-
cial processes can be monitored and adjusted 
centrally. The component providing these 
features is SAP Process Integration.
6.	
Development and adaptation of enter-
prise applications represents the sixth 
IT practice which includes the creation of 
completely new software as well as changing 
and enhancing existing functions. Because 
development in an enterprise environment 
poses many challenges, it is supported by 
components like the Composite Application 
Framework.
7.	
The  IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) plays 
an important role in today’s IT management, 
which is why the IT practice of unified 
life cycle management covers most of its 
concepts. An important building block for 
attaining this goal is the use of the SAP 
Solution Manager.
8.	
The topic of application governance and 
security management is covered by the 
eighth IT practice. It deals with the holistic 
management of applications within a system 
landscape, addressing issues like commu-
nication and security of the systems. The 
Concept of implementing single sign-on 
is just one example. As this task affects all 
systems in an enterprise, there is no specific 
component to point out.
9.	
While the presented IT practice of data 
unification aims at the consolidation of data, 
the IT practice of consolidation deals with 
all approaches to simplify the whole system 
landscape. Examples of these approaches 
are service oriented architecture or server 
virtualization.
10.	 The last IT practice enterprise service-ori-
ented architecture design and deployment 
covers the areas of planning, developing, 
reusing und maintaining SOA applications. 
By separating the formerly monolithic ap-
plications into smaller services the adminis-
trative effort to keep track of these modules 
and to wisely reuse them is a major issue for 
development.B

“Low-Cost Information and communication tech-
nologies, global markets, and global competition 
have forced enterprises to rethink their traditional, 
vertically integrated structure. As the cost of 
collaboration plummets, it increasingly makes 
sense for companies to focus on core competen-
cies and partners for all other functions. As a 
result, corporations are  transforming into flatter 
and more specialized enterprises, linking with 
suppliers and other businesses to form a larger, 
more open, value-creation entity” (Tapscott 2007) 
– the business web.
The innovation potential and practical rel-
evance of the business web is a recent topic for 
ERP Software providers. SAP (Karch, Heilig 
et al., 2005; Tapscott 2007) and salesforce.com 
(Gilbert 2006) described it as an important shift 

326  
From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
in the future similar to the migration from the 
classical world wide web to Web 2.0.
The business web can only be realized if an 
adequate ecosystem has been set up. The following 
figure illustrates such an ecosystem. 
In addition to the well know eCommerce or 
supply chain models this ecosystem not only fo-
cuses on special partners but instead on a whole 
community. The idea of integrating virtually 
everything is not a new one, but it often failed due 
to high complexity. Enterprise SOA now offers a 
concept and appendant tools that allow to man-
age complexity by partitioning and linking the 
emerging parts (partner processes) together.C
CONCLUSIONCSI
Companies try to save investments in old appli-
cations by wrapping old code into web services. 
This can be described as a three step approach: 
Legacy to SOA is the first step to go. The idea is 
to make your business transactions accessible, 
independent of the platform they run on and to 
abstract from the programming language they 
were implemented in. The second step is to map 
these services onto different business processes 
by focusing on your internal processes and your 
immediate business partners, i.e. customers and 
suppliers. The consequential third step is to extend 
the reach of your services – and along with it the 
reach of your business – by integrating them into 
a business web.
This demonstrated the power of implement-
ing (Enterprise) SOA. As a first benefit value is 
generated by reducing the effort for integrating 
your internal IT-Systems. Then additional value is 
generated by offering your direct partners access 
to your (Enterprise) SOA implementation. Finally 
value is generated by your community if they use

form a larger, more open, value-creation entity 
– the business web.
IT Practice: The application based view on 
SAP NetWeaver identifies different main use cases 
within an enterprise system landscape which are 
called IT Practices. In different abstraction levels, 
they describe the activities necessary to achieve 
the implementation of a specific technical task 
in a company.
SAP R/3: SAP R/3 has been released 1992 
as the first ERP system for very large businesses 
based on a client-server architecture. It was divided 
in different functional modules and was the central 
point of enterprise system landscapes.
SAP NetWeaver: Moving from SAP R/3 
to SAP ERP, the technical foundation of SAP 
R/3 SAP Basis was separated from the business 
functions and enhanced by many other technical 
features. This new technical basis that enables 
SOA is called NetWeaver.

From ERP to Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture
SOA: SOA is an architectural style whose 
goal is to achieve loose coupling among interact-
ing software agents. A service is a unit of work 
done by a service provider to achieve desired end 
results for a service consumer. Both, provider and 
consumer are roles played by software agents on 
behalf of their owners.

Enterprise-wide automation has already transformed the relations among suppliers, purchasers, produc-
ers, and customers. Conventional ERP helps only to automate individual departments. It could neither 
integrate its back-office benefits into the front-office, nor could it establish consistent control of all 
business processes. Competitive pressures and globalization stresses the need for more effective, total 
enterprise solutions. The world class competition, modern business environment, and the availability of 
the Internet are the premises which stress the need for ERP. The salient features of ERP II are presented 
in addition to describing some of the disruptive technologies which will help reengineer ERP systems 
rapidly. The results of an international survey pertaining to the embedding of intelligence in the modern 
day ERP shows an evolutionary trend. The order placement over the Internet by a sales clerk from a 
remote location forms a part of this chapter to benefit the readers in understanding the functioning of 
an ERP system.

ERP and Beyond
ITRCTI
Enterprise is a group of people and associated 
resources to achieve a common goal. Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) System is an enter-
prise wide system which encompasses corporate 
mission, objectives, attitudes, beliefs, values, 
operating style and people who make the orga-
nization. It is a software solution that addresses 
the Enterprise needs, taking a process view of 
the overall organization to meet the goals, by 
tightly integrating all functions under a common 
software platform. In other words, ERP systems 
are computer based systems designed to process 
an organization’s transactions. It facilitates 
integrated and real-time planning, production 
and customer response. ERP has multilingual 
capability, multi-currency handling ability, and 
can recognize legal and tax reporting needs of 
various nations across the world. 
The real need for such an integrated system has 
emerged with the onset of Supply Chain Manage-
ment, e-business and global operations which calls 
for exchange of information with other companies 
and customers directly (Krajewski et al., 2000). 
A world-class competitor means being successful 
against any competitor on quality, lead time, flex-
ibility, cost/price, customer service and innovation 
(Table 1). It needs transforming relations among 
suppliers, purchasers, producers and customers. 
This can be achieved only through enterprise 
automation which assists innovators to achieve 
their market share and at the same time operate 
at peak efficiency to satisfy customer needs. The 
world in which we do business is shrinking, and 
virtually every enterprise is either marketing or 
selling to customers in other countries, or simply 
using parts or materials that are produced else-
where. Internet has overcome time and distance 
to a great extent. It has become the need of the 
hour to think globally and to include the same in 
plans, processes and strategies. 
Globalization and Web commerce riding on 
the development of the Internet have changed 
traditional business behaviors and practices. Le-
veraging the Internet by the business has become 
a need to quickly establish a virtual presence. 
They must use collaborative technology in order 
to respond to customer’s requirements better and 
faster. When the operations are scattered through 
multiple locations around the world,   the need is 
to gain visibility across all sites. This enhanced 
visibility can lead to more negotiating power for 
purchasing parts and more efficient centralized ac-
counts payable and receivable thereby improving 
overall performance. Solutions like ERP, supply 
chain management or CRM solutions provide 
tools to manage the information that is essential 
to growing business value. 
The need to achieve world class status, rapid 
development in Internet and related technologies, 
and the evolving business trends are the premises 
which accelerates the evolution of ERP systems. 
Virtually every enterprise is either marketing or 
selling to customers in other countries, or simply 
buying parts or materials that are produced else-

where. It has become a necessity for businesses 
to embrace Internet to quickly establish virtual 
presence through web commerce. 
Enterprise wide automation alone can address 
transforming relations among suppliers, purchas-
ers, producers and customers. ERP has fallen short 
in the following   areas that are critical to today’s 
business needs (www.exactamerica.com):  Scope 
of conventional ERP is limited; conventional 
ERP helps automate individual departments and 
did not integrate its back-office benefits into the 
front-office to help businesses manage people, 
workloads and supply-chain issues; it could not 
establish consistent control of all the processes 
of the business. Competitive pressures and glo-
balization have made it clear that the business 
world is still in need of more effective, total 
enterprise solutions. Figure 1 shows the typical 
ERP architecture.
EVOLUTION OTIF ERPR
In the 1960s, computers were used only to auto-
mate routine business tasks like payroll which is 
simple multiplication of number of hours worked 
with hourly rate and subtracting from the result 
taxes and deductions. Subsequently, financial 
applications like the general ledger, accounts 
payable, accounts receivable and fixed assets 
were automated. This is the reason why IS/IT 
department reported to Vice President of Finance 
in the past (Shields, 2001). The computer pro-
grammers of olden times were disadvantaged by 
lack of high level languages, relational databases 
management systems, abundant memory in the 
computer, graphical user interfaces and real time 
dialog handlers.
Material Requirements Planning (MRP) was 
used in 1970s for raw material ordering based 
on order at hand.  It is a computerized inventory 
control and production planning system respon-
sible for scheduling the production of all items 
in the main assembly (Khalid, 2001).  Joseph 
Orlicky, George Plossl and Oliver Wight of the 
American Production and Inventory Control 
Society (APICS) get the credit for implementing 
MRP. The basic functions of MRP could be car-
ried out by Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 
using sequential file processing. Supply Chain 
Management Systems evolved much later with 
the sharing of long range production schedules

among manufacturers and their suppliers. This 
was called simply MRP or MRP I. Manufactur-
ing Resources Planning widely known as MRP 
II evolved later. The ultimate aim of MRP I is 
to maintain lowest level of inventory. It simply 
expedites or delays inventory ordering depend-
ing on the situation. Whenever there is lack of 
inventory which will delay the overall production, 
MRP I expedites inventory. MRP I delay the 
inventory whenever material need is postponed 
due to unexpected schedule changes. Both these 
rules jointly optimize the level of inventory avail-
able in the organization at any point of time. The 
idea of working with different sets of numbers 
for financial people and  manufacturing people 
became more acceptable which made MRP II 
more popular than MRP I (Brady et al., 2003). 
MRP II incorporated financial accounting, human 
resource management and distribution. It provides 
information regarding staffing levels and overtime 
needs through detailed capacity requirements 
planning. Till this point of evolution, informa-
tion systems provided insight only regarding 
internal operations of the organization and could 
not exchange information directly with custom-
ers or with other companies (Krajewski, 2000). 
This evolving need for exchanging information 
between companies and own customers resulted 
in the emergence of a new breed of information 
system called ERP System. The Figure 2 shows 
the evolution of Information System over the years 
from simple payroll computation in the 1960s to 
complicated Internet enabled ERP systems or 
ERP II in the 2000s.
On the other side of the coin, development of 
business applications individually by various com-
panies was viewed as reinventing the same wheel 
in the 1970s and 1980s by computer consultants 
and programmers (Shields, 2001).  This resulted in 
the creation of standard software which could save 
lots of money for individual companies without 
sacrificing quality of the software used as these 
were generated, tested and evaluated by best in 
the field. In 1972, five IBM employees left their 
job to start a company which created standard 
financial software for corporations.  Revenue from 
this venture grew to $5 Billion in 1999. The idea 
of standard software for payroll, HR applications 
and similar management functions to cater to the 
needs of several organizations in one shot, with

minor changes here or there, became a huge busi-
ness arena for the IS/IT business. Most of these 
standard packages ran on mainframes without 
common databases and real time interfaces be-
tween the packages. Any interface development 
which shared information between application 
packages had to be internally developed by the 
company or firm and the same became obsolete 
as soon as new versions of standard packages 
were released by the vendors of these application 
packages.
The idea of application suites emerged in 
1990s. Rapidly changing markets, top-heavy/over-
staffed organizations incapable of reacting quickly 
to change and the idea of business processes 
mooted by Michael Hammer (Hammer et al., 1993) 
culminated in the idea developing an enterprise 
wide system. Business managers started viewing 
business as a set of cross functional processes 
(Brady et al., 2003). The problems faced by stan-
dard package users of the 1980s were overcome 
by the development of package which could share 
information in real time and could use central-
ized database. These became a reality because of 
the rapid development in hardware, database and 
operating system technologies. Some such suites 
developed even had multi-platform compatibility. 
The evolution of such ERP systems are viewed 
either as embodiment of reengineering or forced 
reengineering (Gendron, 1996; O’Leary, 2000). 
There exist differences between ERP systems 
and application packages as shown in the Table 
2. ERP is process based whereas an application 
package is function based. A process has to cut 
across boundaries of many functional depart-
ments to achieve the result whereas an application 
package remains within the needs of a particular 
functional department.  ERP systems are scalable 
and have distributed database support with a 
centralized database repository. The client-server 
architecture is the commonly used technology for 
implementing ERP systems, which aids scalability 
at ease.  ERP supports going global by handling 
multi-location facilities, multiple languages and 
multiple currency thereby bringing geographically 
distributed operations closer and manageable.
Earlier ERP products were just extensions 
of Material Requirements Planning of the past 
and did not have  functionalities like, advanced 
planning, call centers, business analytics and 
data warehousing to name a few. Financial, 
Manufacturing, Human Resources and Distri-
bution were the only four primary areas which 
were addressed by ERP vendors in the 1990s and 
the rest were addressed by vertical market and 
industry solutions.

ARACTERISTIC FRCTRISTICEATURESTRS 
OF AN ERPR SYSTEMSSST
ERP systems integrate business processes. It is a 
single database repository for various functional 
departments of the organization without replica-
tion in storing and facilitates real time data access. 
It helps integrate geographically distributed plant 
locations by supporting multi language and multi 
currency handling ability. Multitude of industries 
is supported by ERP by having separate version to 
aid each industry work flow. The ease of external 
access to information systems of other companies 
has resulted in widespread acceptance of such a 
system in the business arena. The web readiness 
of the integrated data repository with its ability to 
run on client-server architecture makes it an in-
dispensable tool in the Internet era. Table 3 shows 
characteristic features of an ERP system.
ERP is not for manufacturing organizations 
alone and can also be very well used for the service 
organizations. It facilitates fast communication 
of information within the company (Davenport, 
1998).  It provides consistent information through 
out the organization by the use of a centralized 
data repository and improves efficiency through 
single data entry for all the organizational needs 
(David, 2004). ERP systems strive for optimiza-
tion of company’s overall operational effectiveness 
and profitability rather than eyeing at local optimal 
efficiency aimed by individual departments due 
to compartmentalized thinking.  This enterprise 
wide thinking towards the common objective of 
profit maximization at the organizational level by 
sacrificing local optima at departmental level has 
become  a reality only with the advent of such 
a system which will cut across the boundaries 
of various functional departments within the 
organization.  
Though ERP systems provide better system/
data integration and offer best practices at lesser 
computational cost, it is not without disadvantages. 
Some of the cons are less flexibility, difficult to 
make corrections, lesser freedom to enhance 
creativity and heavy training expense and other 
hidden costs (David, 2004).
NEED FOR ERPRR
If various functional departments work in isola-
tion, one department may not know what the other 
does. Each department generates conflicting inter-
ests which will lead to too much deviation from 
organizational goals. If all the departments consult 
a centralized data repository prior to making their 
own departmental decisions, only those activities 
which will make the firm’s operation profitable 
only are encouraged. The idea of ERP is to gener-
ate such a centralized information system which 
 
 
 
 Ability to integrate business processes; 
 Provides scalability to expand; 
 Data repository/Enterprise wide database without replication in storing; 
 Facilitates real time data access; 
 Helps integrate multi location activity which are geographically separated; 
 Supports multi languages and multi currencies; 
 Possible to customize without programming; 
 It fosters speedy intra and extra organizational communication; 
 Written based on a specific industry work flow; 
 Designed for client-server architecture and is either web based or traditional 
software based. 
 
Table 3. Characteristic features of an ERP system

  335
ERP and Beyond
will allow seamless flow of information cutting 
across various functional departmental barriers 
and automate business processes concentrating 
on the profitability of the enterprise.
Information system comprises of people, 
hardware, software, network communication 
and data which collects, processes and dissemi-
nates data.  Management Information System 
(MIS) produces only specific reports which are 
predefined and cannot produce anything more 
than that. Accurate, timely and right data at the 
right point of time are signs of good information 
system. Production information is required for 
stores, raw material procurement and finance 
department, for earmarking funds for the purchase 
of the same. Table 4 shows the need for ERP in 
the e-business era. 
The integrated management of information 
leads to Integrated Data Model which supports a 
centralized data repository. This data repository 
gives up to date status of the organization at any 
point of time without data redundancy and assur-
ing total integrity.
Better integration cutting across various func-
tional departments in an organization is ensured 
which helps make real time decisions in the quick-
est possible. Compartmentalized thinking is no 
more encouraged and process based thinking has 
already set in. This ensures optimal decisions for 
the firm at all times. Even the work flow redesign 
is performed to generate the most optimal path 
to achieve the end result of the process with the 
minimum usage of resources. Most processes 
end up in the generation of too many reports and 
long process map comprising of many non value 
added activities when designed for the first time. 
ERP system with the optimal workflow for the 
industry is the trend of the day and saves resources 
from being wasted. As the ERP system has the 
flexibility to accommodate different currencies 
and languages including different accounting 
standards and multi location activity, it is a true 
integrator cutting across organizational and geo-
graphical boundaries. ERP system helps locate 
plants in various parts of the world giving due 
consideration to various factors without loosing 
the power of centralized control and decentralized 
decision making. This is in line with   Federalism 
advocated by the famous management guru Peter 
Drucker.  Irrespective of the location of the vari-
ous plants, business communication on real-time 
basis is established between the Corporate Office 
and plants to achieve uninterrupted exchange of 
data or information made possible through the 
Internet infrastructure in a secure way. Business 
to business connection is a typical example of 
establishing a secure connection using Internet 
infrastructure, as in Virtually Private Network, 
without having dedicated lines installed by each 
business separately. Better analysis and planning 
using decision support systems and simulation re-
sulting in better decision making. Data warehous-
ing helps store past data which are useful only for 
trend analysis and retrieve them using data mining 
 
 Better integration to provide real time decision capability; 
 Flexibility to accommodate multi-currency, language and accounting standards; 
 Better a nalysis and planning u sing d ecision support s ystems a nd s imulation 
resulting in better decision making; 
 Technology  demonstrator;  
 Dramatically reduced data entry, paper trails, and administrative tasks; 
 Improved data visibility and decision support, resulting in better performance.

as and when required. This helps optimization of 
database searches in the ERP. Only current data 
which really useful immediately are kept online 
and the rest are judiciously warehoused. ERP can 
be thought of as a product which uses hardware and 
software in a balanced way and responds quickly 
to emerging trends in both to tap the potential 
further. It is really an avenue for demonstrating 
and using developments in information technol-
ogy. World class competition, modern business 
scenario and the Internet have transformed the 
way business is done in the modern era. A World-
Class competitor means being successful against 
any competitor on quality, lead time, flexibility, 
cost/price, customer service and innovation for 
which ERP is definitely inevitable. The world in 
which we do business is shrinking, and virtually 
every enterprise is either marketing or selling to 
customers in other countries, or simply using parts 
or materials that are produced elsewhere. Internet 
has overcome time and distance to a great extent. 
It has become the need of the hour to think glob-
ally and to include the same in plans, processes 
and strategies. Globalization and Web commerce 
because of Internet have changed traditional 
business behaviors and practices. Leveraging 
the Internet by the business has become a need 
to quickly establish a virtual presence. 
ERP IIRII
The need for e-business, Internet readiness in the 
Internet era and a situation which prevailed to 
tide over Y2K problems in the late 90s and early 
2000s pushed ERP into the market. Average price 
of setting up a commercial website for a large or 
midsize organization was kept at $ 1 million by 
Research agencies like Gartner Research Group 
(Shields, 2001). Most of the websites developed 
during this period were not having backend sup-
port and could only accept shopping cart details 
from customers, print them out and do the rest 
of the processing manually. This means that only 
front-end website existed which made it appear as 
if everything was integrated electronically.  Mod-
ules in the suite supplied by Oracle and SAP had 
sufficient functionality to attract a good majority 
of any business wanting to implement the e-way. 
Companies had to spent lots of money on main-
taining the interfaces among the components after 
implementing the system during this early stage 
of e-business proliferation. With the development 
of the middleware called Enterprise Application 
integration (EAI), most of the integration issues 
remained within limits. The differences between 
ERP, new-generation application packages and 
e-business started vanishing beyond recognition 
at the boundaries. ERP of the past can be thought 
of as fully integrated modules which provided 
automated support for various functions. 
In 1999, ERP by major vendors started incor-
porating Internet technologies to perform transac-
tions through a browser and these vendors renamed 
themselves as e-business vendors. By 2000, the 
market saw the proliferation of e-business suites 
which could even engulf other functions like 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and 
Supply Chain Management (SCM) which were 
not present in traditional ERP. This made the ERP 
in Internet era really support the e-business wave 
and the palm top for ERP connectivity   from 
remote locations really changed the way how the 
business was carried out. Real time connectivity 
and centralized data repository became features 
of the ERP system. Moreover, ERP vendors 
maintained the various versions of the system 
and its interfaces developed by them thereby 
relieving the users who go for best-of-the-breed. 
E-business and ERP integration really boosted 
the concept of digital firm which was catching 
the wave during that time. Digital firm in terms 
has to have a digitally enabled environment for 
the interaction and processing among customers, 
employees, employer and the stakeholders alike 
as shown in Figure 3 (Laudon et al., 2002).
ERP II superseded ERP and its two lesser 
known iterations called extended ERP and En-

  337
ERP and Beyond
terprise Application Suite (EAS) (www.vendor-
showcase.com). The most apparent change from 
ERP to ERP II is a change in focus from one that 
is totally enterprise-centric and preoccupied with 
internal resource optimization and transactional 
processing to a new focus on process integration 
and external collaboration. ERP II application 
deployment strategies relates to information that 
is exchanged between two or more businesses 
over the Internet.  This exchange information 
electronically via the Internet is known as collab-
orative commerce or     c-commerce. So it can be 
concluded that ERP II has c-commerce features. 
ERP II has also expanded to include areas such 
as Supply Chain Management (SCM), Customer 
Relationship Management (CRM), Knowledge 
Management (KM), business intelligence (BI), 
and inventory optimization (IO). The features 
in ERP II is very much in line with the Gartner 
research paper which predicted that ERP II would 
take ERP foundation and extend it  outward to 
position the enterprise in the supply chain (www.
gcis.ca). Figure 4 shows ERP II model which 
engulfs c-commerce.
The following are the notable differences be-
tween ERP and ERP II (www.erpwire.com):
i.	
ERP II is web enabled where as ERP was 
not;
ii.	
ERP was giving selected intensive coverage 
or wide extensive coverage in its modules. 
But ERP II gives the right mix of the macro 
and the micro and provides users with re-
medial measures after detecting the error;
iii.	
ERP was targeted more towards manufactur-
ing and the problem is overcome in ERP II 
by  offering solution for all industries and 
sectors as well;
iv.	
ERP could not integrate different functions 
from different departments but ERP II could 
integrate different functions across depart-
ments as well as from different industries;
v.	
ERP II has embraced CRM & SCM func-
tionality in addition to being web and WAP 
enabled;
vi.	
ERP II revolutionalized the function to an 
external one and facilitated better networks 
than remaining as internal application.

ERP and Beyond
An international survey was floated by the 
authors to study the status of the use of latest 
technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
and tools in building intelligence in the modern 
day ERP (Suresh, et al. 2006). The results are as 
shown in the Table 5. Some of the newer disrup-
tive technologies like managed code, extensible 
mark-up language and component architecture, 
born out of Object Oriented programming, are 
worth studying to establish the level of  exploita-
tion in developing and using such technologies 
in building ERP systems. The survey response 
analysis based on responses from 92 subjects 
helps to conclude that 84.8% agreed that ERP 
requires intelligence for making use of ERP sys-
tems in strategic decision making which confirms 
the existence of a reengineering path through 
incorporation of AI techniques in ERP.  It can 
be inferred that ERP is already in the path of 
evolution since 75% disagreed that ERP is good 
for transaction processing alone.  In the era of 
web-enabled systems only web-enabled software 
can survive and the same is depicted in the result 
since 80.1% agreed that web-enabled ERP helps 
the evolution of ERP. Though it is found that 
ERP is in its evolutionary path, it is evident that 
sufficient scope exists for the application of AI 
techniques as 71.7% disagreed that widespread 
use of AI techniques are available in present 
day ERP. Evolution is inevitable for ERP since 
87.5% disagreed that ERP will remain only as a 
transaction processing system. Majority (79.3%) 
disagreed that difficulty in building intelligence 
in ERP is due to lack of availability of web tools 
which gives a clear indication that technology is 
ready for building intelligent ERP. Also it may be 
noted that  75% disagreed that intelligence is not 
integrated in ERP due to security reasons which 
implies that no security related issues impedes 
incorporating intelligence in ERP. About half

the respondents (48.9%) disagreed that major 
ERP vendors does not want to risk by developing 
intelligent   ERP in the market. The real reason 
for lack interest of ERP vendors in developing 
intelligent ERP can be attributed to some other 
reason other than financial risk since 36.96% were 
unsure of this cause. Majority (85.9%) disagreed 
that ERP being  a mission critical real time system, 
intelligence should not be integrated which means 
mission criticality of the real time ERP system 
does not stand in the way of making   intelligent 
ERP. Relatively good percentage of respondents 
(59.8%) disagreed that AI techniques and web 
tools are not ripe enough for integration in ERP 
indicating that AI techniques and web tools are 
ripe enough for integration in ERP.
R ASOSNSS FOR THE GROWTHRTRT 
IR
ERP integrates firm’s activities and improves 
business performance by reducing cycle time 
and helps deliver order in time.  The time taken 
between start of the conversion of raw materials 
and completion of manufacturing of the product 
can be compressed to optimally low levels with-
out sacrificing quality by the use of completely 
integrated departmental databases provided in the 
ERP system It also achieves drastic reduction in 
inventory by keeping the inventory level at the 
optimal level. Reduction in lead time is achieved 
through efficient inventory management system 
integrated with sales, marketing, purchasing, 
production planning and control departments. 
Keeping track of lead times of several thousands 
of items manually is practically impossible. As 
soon as the order is received through the sales 
module in the front-end, triggering of various 
related action starts taking place simultaneously. 
Computation for the generation of bill of materials 
to support the new order is one among them and 
availability of various components for the fulfill-
ment of the new order is checked. As a result of 
this process, a list of items for which order is to 
be placed is generated after cross checking the 
availability of the same in the inventory. ERP 
systems also take care of invoice management, 
vendor selection and other required activities up 
to the release of purchase order. This computer-

ized system compresses the time taken for such a 
process from many days to few seconds and with 
better accuracy than manual system. 
Various strategies like make-to-stock or make-
to-order or a combination of the above can be ben-
eficial to each product manufactured throughout 
its product life cycle. ERP gives the flexibility 
which most suits the product under consideration. 
Engineering changes can be effectively handled in 
limited time with appropriate approvals received 
at specified levels or authority for the smooth 
implementation of engineering changes.
Multiple keying of the same information for 
the use of different departments in the same 
company is avoided by adopting integrated data 
model approach and centralized data repository. 
This reduces time taken and chances of human 
error which might creep in at the time of subse-
quent keying in of the same information at the 
departmental levels. As ERP is written based on 
the workflow followed in the top few companies 
in the industry, it captures the best practices in the 
industry. Any company in the industry following 
the ERP workflow will induct the best, optimal and 
proven work flow for the industry thereby result-
ing in enhanced profits and optimal functioning. 
This also results in organizational standardization 
among various plants of the same organization 
located in different places. Substandard processes 
are eliminated with standardized processes unify-
ing the common view to the outside world. New 
product and new customers are best supported by 
ERP which fosters business growth. 
Improved resource utilization is achieved 
through proper capacity planning. Modern ERP 
systems support both rough-cut and detailed ca-
pacity planning. Inputs for resource requirements 
for production comes from Master Production 
Schedule like which product, how many and 
when. Capacity definitions are sourced from work 
centers based on machine records. This helps 
identify resources which become constraints from 
time to time and is automatically pinpointed by 
the ERP system. To a certain extent such systems 
also support simulation to evaluate scenarios to 
arrive at the best option. 
The changing customer needs are immediately 
reflected in the product line without taking much 
time due to tighter integration between front-end 
and back-end operation. The input received from 
sales, which is front-end, is immediately processed 
by the engineering design and production at the 
back-end through the incorporation engineer-
ing changes needed from time to time. As this 
is almost like a closed loop activity carried out 
on a real-time mode, wastage is minimized to 
the lowest level possible. Better service levels 
achieved through ERP systems is another fac-
tor which satisfies the customer better. Better 
flexibility in supporting new product designs in 
addition to engineering change management of 
existing designs with minimum disruption is a 
key feature of such systems.
Its multi-language and multi-currency han-
dling ability embraces different locations of the 
same organization cutting across geographical 
boundaries with ease. Unlike in legacy system, 
here the data or information once is available on 
line and need not be re-keyed to make it available 
in another part of the organization and is available 
24X7 on real-time basis. Integrated and flexible 
real-time support achieved in ERP helps manage 
an organization by gathering information once and 
at source eliminating multiple hierarchies of per-
sonnel exclusively posted for upward/downward 
communication. It really flattens an organiza-
tion to a certain extent. As the data is stored in a 
centralized data repository, which will not allow 
multiple values for the same variable making it 
inconsistent, polices data inconsistencies and 
information asymmetries.   Right information at 
right place at the right time is the key feature which 
makes the ERP system unique. This improved 
data/information accuracy substantially improves 
decision making ability. ERP became the most 
accepted solution for the new millennium which 
only could convince the business world that it 
is much superior to modified legacy systems in 
solving the Y2K problem. 

  341
ERP and Beyond
The present day growth in ERP business is 
mainly due to spread of ERP solution to mid-
sized organizations as shown in Table 5. One 
organization can be efficient and fast only as 
much as its weakest supplier or partner in busi-
ness is a universal truth. So the need of the hour 
for any organization is to bring in their suppliers 
within the ERP net. This helps establish B2B 
connection among the geographically distributed 
company and its suppliers in the Internet era by 
integrating the two. Thus ERP solutions not only 
improve intra organizational communication but 
also inter organizational communication. Integra-
tion achieved helps simultaneous sharing of the 
same database among business partners as well 
as production planning and control within the 
same organization. This really helps manage sup-
plier/partner performance better as they deliver 
quality products for lower prices. Modules in 
the ERP systems in a web enabled environment, 
helps negotiate, monitor and control procurement 
costs/schedule in addition to routine processes 
like vendor selection. Just-In-Time which is ex-
plained later in this book becomes a reality only 
with such systems leading to integration beyond 
organizational boundaries.R
REASONS FOR THE FSSRTAILUREIR 
OF ERPR
It is risky to implement a system in a company 
without proper advice from experienced consul-
tants. As there are many vendors in the market 
offering ERP solutions, only a consultant based 
on  his/her experience in the field only will know 
which is the right product to be used for the 
situation under consideration. Only experienced 
consultants in the particular industry may prove 
to be the right choice. This insists that product 
and competency of the consultants are important 
in ERP system implementation.
Implementation has to take place at a rapid 
pace but not in a haphazard fashion without giving 
sufficient importance to factors which are very 
critical in the selection and implementation of 
ERP systems. Sudden transformation, in the jobs 
of many in the organization, from clerical jobs 
 
 
 Integrates firm’s activities: 
• Reduces lead time; 
• On time shipment; 
• Reduces cycle time. 
 Employs “Best practices” in the industry: 
• Improves resource utilization;  
• Increased flexibility; 
• Ensures better customer satisfaction. 
 Enables organizational standardization; 
 Eliminates information asymmetries; 
 Provides real-time information on-line; 
 Avoids data inconsistency between production and planning: 
• Better & faster decision making. 
 Fosters inter and intra-organizational communication: 
• Improved supplier performance.

to computer assisted real-time decision making 
makes it difficult for the employees to adjust to the 
new environment for a while. An simple key press 
on the enter button of a computer by a sales clerk 
triggers many actions like releasing of purchase 
orders for raw materials, changes schedules in 
the shop floor, alerts HR manager for the release 
of advertisement for recruiting people to fill the 
voids in skill levels and the like to support the 
order committed by the sales clerk. The lack of 
knowledge of the sales clerk in other areas of 
operation like production, which is a back-end 
operation, develops stress in the clerk as he is 
not completely aware of all the operations which 
will follow order commitment over his computer. 
Training is definitely   useful in driving the fear 
away the fear in employees regarding clicks and 
their effects on the system. No individual likes 
change except a baby with wet diaper and the same 
is true to this situation. Training helps alleviate 
resistance to change.
Computer and its use in automation are often 
thought of as method for down-sizing by the 
employees. Fear of unemployment in employees 
due to ERP implementation can be eliminated by 
building awareness in them regarding the chang-
ing needs of the industry and the transformation 
from manual jobs to computerized jobs which 
only is taking place to meet the extremely high 
levels of demand in market at short notices. Table 
6 enumerates some of the common causes for the 
failure of ERP implementation.
WORKING RKIOF AN ERPR SYSTEMSST
 In order to demonstrate the working of an ERP 
system, SAP R/3 system is used here. The ex-
ample discussed is adapted from  Edmundson et 
al., 1997 and O’Leary, 2001. Assume that for a 
company located  in Bangalore, sales representa-
tive is taking order from a retailer in London. The 
sales representative is taking order in her lap top, 
with connectivity to her back-end at Bangalore 
where the production is taking place, using the 
sales module of SAP R/3. The system checks 
retailer’s credit history to decide whether the 
sale can take place. If allowed to proceed with 
the sale, the system  module checks for probable 
price and corresponding discounts that the retailer 
is eligible for.
Next check by the R/3 system is the availability 
of inventory in the nearest warehouse. Assume 
that the company is having a warehouse at Frank-
furt. The system checks for the availability of the 
product ex-stock as per order in the Frankfurt 
warehouse which is the nearest one. If it is found 
that only a portion of the order is available, the rest 
has to come from factory at Bangalore. Inventory 
module of the R/3 system immediately alerts the 
warehouse to ship the quantity available ex-stock 
at the warehouse and simultaneously, back-end is 
informed of the shortage to complete the order. 
R/3’s Production module at the back-end sched-
ules the production of the quantity of product not 
available ex-stock at the warehouse. An invoice

is printed in English and Euro as currency by 
the sales clerk and the same is handed over to 
the retailer.
If the Human Resources module of the R/3 
system finds shortage of workers to meet the 
order on schedule, the personnel manager is im-
mediately alerted to procure additional temporary 
manpower in corresponding areas.
R3’s material planning module alerts the 
purchasing manager to release orders for raw 
materials. The quantity computation is automati-
cally done by the ERP system.
The retailer at London can log on to R3’s Front 
end through the Internet and find that a portion of 
the order is completed. It also gives the retailer to 
place order for more quantity, if needed. Figure 5 
shows how the interaction with R/3 software by 
a sales clerk sitting remotely from its factory at 
London triggers a chain of action to the extent of 
changing schedules at the factory floor by merely 
confirming an order over Internet.C
CONCLUSIONCSI
An attempt has been made in this chapter to define 
ERP and to explain the meaning of the same in 
the e-business era. The world class competition, 
modern business environment and the availability 
of the Internet are the premises which stress the 
need for ERP. The evolution of ERP is presented 
briefly starting with Pay roll and Bill of Materials

presenting some of the disruptive technologies 
which help reengineer ERP systems fast. The 
results of an international survey pertaining to

the failure of ERP implementation are included 
to shed light on aspects which are of utmost im-
portance to ERP implementation. The example 
of placing order remotely over Internet by a sales 
clerk sitting away from the factory forms a part of 
this chapter to benefit the readers in understanding 
the functioning of an ERP system better.R

Abstracta
The chapter introduces the essence of ERP in government as a tool for integration of government func-
tions which provides the basis for citizen services. It discusses the challenges faced in modernization of 
government “businesses” and discusses strategies for implementation. The basis of Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) solutions is integration of functions which capture basic data through transactions to 
support critical administrative functions such as budgeting and financial management, revenue man-
agement, supply chain management and human resources management. Today, Enterprise solutions 
(ES) go beyond ERP to automate citizen-facing processes. The integration of data sources with each 
contact point is essential to ensure a consistent level of service. The author expects that researchers, 
governments and solution providers will be able to appreciate the underlying constraints and issues in 
implementation of ERP and hopes that the learning from industry would be useful to plan implementa-
tion of ES in government using emerging technologies. 
ITRCTI
ERP provides an enterprise-wide view of an orga-
nization and integrates various silos of activity. 
Such an integrated approach has a tremendous 
payback if implemented properly. Most ERP sys-
tems were designed to be used by manufacturing 
companies to track men, machines and material 
so as to improve productivity and reduce inven-
tory. Viewing it from a business perspective, ERP 
systems are now known as Enterprise Solutions 
(ES) which takes a customer order and provides 
a software road map for automating the different 
steps along the path to fulfilling the order. The 
major reasons why companies look at ES can be 
summarized as:

Standardize HR information
Governments worldwide have been making 
efforts to use information and communications 
technologies (ICT) as an instrument of change 
to provide better services to citizens, facilitate 
work flow, and provide better governance and 
transparency. Popularly known as E-Govern-
ment, the focus has initially been on information 
dissemination which has now moved on to trans-
actions. What is required is a transformation of 
the public administration which takes a citizen 
service request and provides a software road map 
for automating the different steps along the path 
to fulfilling the request. This cuts across various 
departments and it is therefore critical to lay down 
suitable policies, guidelines and specifications 
and also redefine processes to facilitate faster 
proliferation of ICT applications. 
E-government does not happen with more com-
puters or a website. While online service delivery 
can be more efficient and less costly than other 
channels, cost savings and service improvements 
are not automatic. E-government has therefore 
to focus on planning, sustained allocation of 
budgets, dedication of manpower resources and 
above all, the political will. The e-government 
field, like most young fields, lacks a strong body 
of well-developed theory. One strategy for cop-
ing with theoretical immaturity is to import and 
adapt theories from other, more mature fields. 
(Flak, Rose, 2005)
Literature survey on implementations of e-
governance has brought out the following obser-
vations which would help us in redefining the use 
of Information & Communication Technology 
(ICT) in the right perspective.
•	
Most governments have not changed their 
processes in any way, and instead have 
automated flawed processes.
•	
Government budgets and administration 
tends to be in departmental silos, but e-
governance cuts across departments.
•	
Too much attention to “citizen portals” has 
taken attention away from internal gov-
ernment functioning. There is a big gap 
between a web site and integrated service 
delivery.
•	
Governments often underestimate the 
security, infrastructure, and scalability 
requirements of their applications which 
impact the quality of service. (Khalil, Lan-
vin, Chaudhry, 2002) 
Learning from the experiences of the cor-
porates, governments today understand the 
need for a consistent and flexible information 
infrastructure that can support organizational 
change, cost-effective service delivery and regu-
latory compliance. ERP is therefore needed to 
meet organizational objectives and outcomes by 
better allocating resources - its people, finances, 
capital, materials, and facilities. Moderniza-
tion programs however involve a broad range of 
activities and require a wide array of skills and 
experiences, as these programs affect everything 
from computers to culture. The objective is to 
reduce administrative overhead and improve 
core product/service delivery.

Before moving on to the ERP discussion it is 
necessary to dwell a little on various aspects of 
E-government which is about transforming the 
way government interacts with the governed.  
The E-Government handbook for developing 
countries identifies three major phases –Publish, 

348  
E-Government and ERP
Interact and Transact. These however are not se-
quential phases and hence can be considered as 
major aspects of e-government. In short, e-govern-
ment utilizes technology to accomplish reform 
by fostering transparency, eliminating distance 
and other divides, and empowering people to par-
ticipate in the political processes that affect their 
lives. (Khalil, Lanvin, Chaudhry, 2002). Each of 
the phases is briefly summarized below.
 
•	
Publish: Governments generate and also 
publish in print large amount of information 
which can be disseminated to the public 
using ICT. Some of these cases are 
◦ 
E-Government Portal of Canada is 
considered as one of the best govern-
ment portals in the world. http://www.
canada.gc.ca. 
◦ 
The JUDIS (Judgment Information 
System) in India posts court records, 
case information and judicial deci-
sions. http://indiancourts.nic.in/itin-
jud.htm
•	
Interact: Interactive e-government in-
volves two-way communications, starting 
with basic functions like email contact 
information for government officials or 
feedback forms that allow users to submit 
comments on legislative or policy proposals. 
Some of the cases are 
◦    	 Citizen Space. A section of the British 
Government’s web portal allowing 
citizens to comment on government 
policy. http://www.ukonline.gov.uk
◦   	
The Central Vigilance Commission 
in India allows citizens to file online 
complaints about corruption. http://
www.cvc.nic.in/vscvc/htm
•	
Transact: Just as the private sector in devel-
oping countries is beginning to make use of 
the Internet to offer e-commerce services, 
governments will be expected to do the same 
with their services. A transact website will 
offer a direct link to government services, 
available at any time. Some of the cases 
are

asp
To achieve this it is essential to look at the 
internal processes of the government, the rela-
tionships between various departments, sharing 
of information between departments and the IT 
infrastructure required to support these aspects. 
The following section indicates the characteris-
tics of content, process, people and technology 
required by government to implement the various 
initiatives, thereby identifying the essence of ERP 
in government (refer to Table 1).
The E-Government handbook for develop-
ing countries has many more case studies listed 
which highlight these phases. (Khalil, Lanvin, 
Chaudhry, 2002).
Enterprise modernization is therefore a com-
plex, ongoing evolutionary process that involves 
the integrated transformation of strategies, 
policies, organization and governance structures, 
business processes and systems, and underlying 
technologies. Only by aligning these elements 
with its business goals can an agency achieve a 
successful modernization program. (Kirwan, 
Sawyer, and Sparrow, 2003).
The very essence of enterprise modernization 
is integration of processes and connectivity of 
stakeholders. It therefore involves connecting:
 
• 
Government to government (G2G):Depart-
mental integration of processes ERP
• 
Government to businesses (G2B):  Informa-
tion to suppliers and procurement SCM
• 
Government to citizens (G2C): information 
and service to citizens CRM

Government to employees (G2E): informa-
tion and service to employees  ERP 
As citizens grow in awareness, governments 
today are under increasing pressure to deliver a 
range of services – from ration cards, motor li-
censes and land records to health, education and 
municipal services – in a manner that is timely, 
efficient, economical, equitable, transparent 
and corruption-free. For any government that is 
keen to respond to this demand and to hasten the 
pace of development –information technology 
comes as an excellent tool. However technocratic 
responses in themselves are not a solution. They 
are a tool. A solution is one that is holistic and 
describes how the tool can be feasibly deployed. 
(Carter, 2005).
ERP solutions in government should therefore 
provide horizontal components, which are relevant 
to every part of a government and should support 
vertical integration needed for the delivery of 
specific services. Such solutions would facilitate 
governments to offer cross-functional services to 
citizens which no longer need to be restricted to 
the structure of the government.
Tremendous potential exists for rethinking 
of the business of government to reduce cost 
and improve the quality of government/constitu-
ent interactions. Most so-called “e-governance” 
initiatives have been simply focused on inter-
net-enabling old processes and systems which 
have resulted in a series of costly, overlapping, 
and uncoordinated projects. Transformation is 
possible only when one examines the inter-rela-
tionships between government agencies – both 
processes and systems which would result in true 
efficiencies of E-Business.
“The benefits come from changing your busi-
ness processes, not from installing ERP,” says 
Bill Swanton, a vice president at AMR Research 
in Boston. Adds Buzz Adams, president of Peak 
Value Consulting that specializes in process im-

provement, “The technology will work the way 
you implement it, so what’s important is how you 
improve the processes — the way you do things.” 
(Bartholomew, 2004). 
FUNCTIONAL MCTIODEL OF PUBLICBIC  
ADMINISTRATIONIISTRTI
 
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems 
are becoming pervasive throughout the public 
sector for their support of critical administra-
tive functions such as budgeting and financial 
management, procurement, human resources 
(HR), business process, and customer relationship 
management (CRM).
ERP solutions for financial management cover 
accounts payable, accounts receivable, fixed as-
set accounting, cash management, activity-based 
and project accounting, cost-centre planning and 
analysis, financial consolidation, financial report-
ing, and legal compliance and reporting. Budget 
management solutions support economic policy, 
collection and analysis of budget and economic 
data, economic forecasting, revenue allocation 
to government agencies, budget approval, and 
budget monitoring.
The Public Administration Functional 
Model can be diagrammatically depicted as 
shown in Figure 1.
Tax and revenue management also fall under 
the financial and budget management umbrella. 
This includes both tax filing and tax case man-
agement. Tax filing covers taxpayer identification 
and registration, tax assessment, management of 
online or offline revenue collection and reimburse-
ments, secure processing, and payment. Tax case 
management involves investigation and enforce-
ment, revenue auditing, and analysis.
Supply chain management (SCM) functions 
cover cataloguing, bidding and negotiation, and 
tendering with workflow support for prepara-
tion of tender requests, invoicing and payment, 
purchasing and reporting. Logistics support in 
the areas of material and equipment planning, 
inventory, warehouse management, transportation 
and distribution, and the maintenance, repair, and 
disposal of assets is another major area of public 
administration.

Finally citizen-facing processes within an or-
ganization through Web-portals and call centers 
as well as traditional over-the-counter services re-
quire integration of data sources with each contact 
point to ensure a consistent level of service.
Traditionally processes were people driven and 
the emphasis of ERP was on automation. Having 
achieved the basic requirements, organizations 
expected to achieve efficiency and control.  Today 
the expectation from an ERP system is strategic 
support adding value to business. Collectively, all 
the functionalities of publishing, interacting and 
transacting now need to be aligned to manage the 
entire government business. ERP combines them 
all together into a single, integrated software 
solution that operates on a single database so that 
the various departments can more easily share 
information, communicate with each other and 
provide end-to-end service to its stakeholders.
C ALLENGESS IN IMPLEMENTATION IITTI
OF ICT SOLUTIONSICTSTIS
E-governance initiatives are common in most 
countries as they promise a more citizen-centric 
government and reduce operational cost. Unfortu-
nately most of these initiatives have not been able 
to achieve the benefits claimed. Often the reason 
for this failure is a techno-centric focus rather 
than a governance-centric focus (Saxena, 2005).
The following challenges faced by organizations 
are equally applicable to governments. 
Acquisition Process
All government ICT and modernization programs 
face major challenges, one of which is the acquisi-
tion process. This process requires a holistic view 
of the public administration for identifying and 
evaluating the right solution, taking decisions 
regarding outsourcing and managing the whole 
implementation as a project. It’s not very dif-
ficult to buy software and hardware that fulfill 
the needs of a single division without considering 
the needs of the entire organization. However, 
if each division of an organization develops its 
own business processes and IT infrastructure, the 
result will be lack of interoperability, duplicated 
components, functional gaps, and inability to 
share information. 
Though external consultants do provide sup-
port, the challenging task is creating an IT orga-
nization structure to support this process within 
the government structure. 
High Expectation from CitizensC
Citizens themselves are becoming increasingly 
demanding as they compare government services 
with other services like banking. Citizens do 
not want to be transferred from department to 
department for an answer to a simple telephone 
query and be forced to queue at public offices to 
make a straightforward transaction. They demand 
facilities to be offered round the clock. They ex-
pect high standards of service, instant access to 
information, efficient transactions, and support, 
whenever and wherever they need it. 
I
arious Functions 
Today it is the era of packaged software which in 
most cases is exhaustively comprehensive. The or-
ganization therefore needs to change its processes 
to align it to ‘best practices’ incorporated in the 
software package. However in the excitement to 
implement such solutions one often loses sight of 
the fact that each department has its own policies 
and rules that make it unique. “For integration 
to work, your internal systems must be working 
properly,” says Mary Kay DeVillier, director/c-
business and information resources at Albemarle 
(Mullin, 2000).
 

352  
E-Government and ERPR
Requirement of ClCean Data
Organizations embarking on an ERP initiative 
must take care not to underestimate the amount 
of work needed to develop a clean set of master 
data. The chart of accounts, citizen data, policies 
& norms and other mission-critical information 
has to be accurate from the start or mistakes will 
multiply exponentially throughout the system. 
Many an ERP project has been scuttled or gone 
south altogether because companies failed to do 
this kind of basic blocking and tackling early on 
(Bartholomew, 2004).S
Standards for I
In order to support these demands the internal 
functions of supply chain management assume 
greater importance. There is tremendous im-
portance for rules and procedures in the gov-
ernment. Unless the records are kept properly, 
accessing information and tracing the precedents 
becomes time consuming and this is one of the 
reasons for the delays in government adminis-
tration. The rules and procedures can be made 
transparent to the citizens, and traceability can 
be incorporated which would improve the pace of 
effectiveness of governance by using Information 
Technology (Budhiraja, 2003).
With multiple players and departments increas-
ingly becoming involved in the e-Government 
initiatives, standards for e-Government have 
become an urgent imperative for interoper-
ability. Enterprise solutions would therefore 
help in streamlining operations, be flexible and 
agile enough to respond to the demands of public 
sector reforms.I
Information SeScurity
Managing a secure environment in an era of in-
tegrated and seamless service delivery presents 
an increasing challenge for governments as it can 
be overwhelming and costly without the right 
infrastructure. While processing sensitive data 
such as citizen and financial information stored 
on ERP systems, government organizations want 
to ensure they take every possible measure to 
maximize security. 
Project Management
To get the most from the software, the people inside 
the government have to adopt the work methods 
outlined in the software. Getting people inside the 
government to use the software to improve the 
ways they do their jobs is by far the most critical 
challenge. Most ERP implementations fail due to 
resistance to change and poor project manage-
ment (Koch). The whole implementation has to 
be taken up as a project clearly identifying the 
scope, cost, time and resource requirements with 
clear definition of milestones. 
Hidden C sts
Certain costs which are more commonly over-
looked or underestimated than others are training, 
integration, customization, testing, data conver-
sion and data analysis which are not adequately 
factored into the budgets. This leads to delay in 
implementation which results in apathy and dis-
satisfaction. 
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIESTTISTRTIS
An ERP system helps the different parts of the 
organization share data and knowledge, reduce 
costs, and improve management of business 
processes. In spite of their benefits, many ERP 
systems fail (Stratman and Roth, 1999). Many ERP 
systems face implementation difficulties because 
of workers’ resistance (Aladwani,  2001). Effec-
tive implementation of ERP requires establishing 
five core competencies, among which is the use 
of change management strategies to promote the 
infusion of ERP in the workplace (Al-Mashari 
and Zairi, 2000).

During the last few years there have been major 
initiatives among different Governments towards 
ushering in ICT and its tools in the functioning of 
Government. The emphasis has been on providing 
better services to citizens and in improving the 
internal productivity. Cases listed in the Report for 
the President’s Management Council in December 
2005 is testimony to this fact (Evans, 2005).
The strategies get more focused when we view 
the organization as an open system composed of 
interdependent components that include Strategy, 
Processes, Structure, Technology and Culture 
as mapped by Scott-Morton in the Management 
of the 1990s equilibrium model (Scott-Morton, 
1991). This model is depicted in Figure 2. The 
salient aspect of this open systems model is that 
an impact of change on one component is im-
mediately felt on the other components either 
directly or indirectly. 
The ERP implementation strategies can 
therefore be classified into organizational, techni-
cal, and people strategies. Organizational strate-
gies would cover strategic planning, business 
alignment, project management and change 
management. The technology strategies would 
cover enterprise architecture, business process 
mapping, data capture and information security. 
People strategies would cover communication, 
managing resistance to change and ongoing 
support.

The state of Missouri in USA was the first to 
implement one of the largest government ERP 
systems which was implemented in phases and 
operational by 2001. The finance, budgeting and 
purchasing functions serve 6,000 end users, and 
its human resources and payroll modules serve 
9,000. One of the most important keys to success 
for the implementation was that all state agencies 
had a say in the project from its earliest stages. 
(Douglas, 2002). 
Developing a strategic plan and bringing all 
stakeholders on board are crucial early steps in 
implementing ERP”, said Ken Munson, senior 
principal in the State and Local Solutions Division 
of AMS Inc., Missouri’s ERP vendor. “The plan 
has to be well communicated and well bought in, 
not just by the different branches of government, 
but by all levels of each of the branches,” he said. 
(Douglas, 2002).
The Department of Information Technology, 
Government of India, has felt it necessary to create 
a rational framework for assessing e-Governance 
projects on various dimensions. It is desirable that 
a set of instruments is available to the adminis-
trators of those projects to appreciate the various 
attributes of a good e-governance project, apply 
midcourse corrections, where needed, and steer 
these projects in the right direction.(Rao, etal, 
2004).
Many problems related to ERP implementa-
tion are related to a misfit of the system with the 
characteristics of the organization. (Markus et al., 
2000).  ERP ‘tends to impose its own logic on a 
company’s strategy, culture, and organization’ 
which may or may not fit with the existing orga-
nizational arrangements. (Davenport, 1998),
Effective Project Management 
Success depends on a well designed implemen-
tation plan. An ERP system is the information 
backbone and reaches into all areas of the business 
and value-chain. It is necessary to consider imple-
mentation as a project and plan the activities 
involving people, processes and technology. 
SAP’s Accelerated SAP Implementation Meth-
odology provides a guideline for implementation. 
(Dejpongsarn, 2005).  It focuses on five broad 
phases covering
•	
Project Preparation: This covers the require-
ment of resources- people, technology and 
budget

E-Government and ERP
•	
Business Blueprint: This covers the docu-
mentation of current processes (As is) and 
comparison to the solution which has best 
practices. A gap analysis provides a start-
ing point to identify the changes required 
by the departments and new development.
•	
Realization: Set-up (configuration), testing, 
data migration and development
•	
Final Preparation: Training, final functional 
testing
•	
Go-live & Support: Different approaches 
are followed for going live (all modules / 
related modules), support through internal 
or external teams. 
Management of C ange
Governments are using organizational change 
management techniques that have worked in the 
commercial world within their own moderniza-
tion programs. (Kauzlarich, 2003).
Modernization strategies, such as ERP 
implementation, commonly involve change. 
Hence, responsiveness to internal customers is 
critical for an organization to avoid the difficul-
ties associated with this change (Al-Mashari and 
Zairi, 2000; Aladwani, 1999; Aladwani, 1998). 
ERP implementation should be viewed as an 
organizational change process, rather than as the 
replacement of a piece of technology. (Boonstra, 
2005). Though change management strategies 
facilitate the success of ERP implementation, 
many ERP systems still face resistance, and 
ultimately, failure. (Aladwani,  2001).
For the reform to succeed, governments 
need to be culturally and technically prepared 
to understand and implement change. Procedural 
and legal changes in the decision making and 
delivery processes as well as internal func-
tioning are required to make a success of ERP 
implementation. B
Business Process Mapping
Administrative reforms will have to precede at-
tempts at implementation of an ERP. The emphasis 
will have to be on simplifying procedures, ratio-
nalizing processes and restructuring Govern-
ment functions. However, this is an ideal situation 
but in practice changes and ERP implementation 
go on parallel as one cannot expect reforms to 
take place in a short period.   
The whole government reform agenda has a 
profound effect on government financial man-
agement. A shift of emphasis from inputs to

outcomes is a key driver behind many reform 
initiatives.(Microsoft). These include public / 
private partnerships, contracting, and decentral-
ization of service delivery to semi-autonomous 
agencies, competition between service providers, 
cost-recovery, revenue generation, and the many 
other alternatives for service provision. 
Data C pture
The basis of an ERP system is the data cap-
tured through transactions which integrates 
the business processes to achieve a task. It is 
therefore necessary to have data standards for 
use across government to enable easier, more ef-
ficient exchanging and processing of data. It will 
also remove ambiguities and inconsistencies in 
the use of data.  The United States Government 
is one of the largest users and acquirers of data, 
information and supporting technology systems in 
the world.  The E-Government program continu-
ously identifies IT opportunities for collaboration 
and consolidation using the Federal Enterprise 
Architecture (FEA) framework. The framework 
is a comprehensive business-driven blueprint to 
enable the federal government to identify op-
portunities to leverage technology to: 
•	
Reduce redundancy; 
•	
Facilitate horizontal (cross-federal) and 
vertical (federal, state and local) informa-
tion sharing; 
•	
Establish a direct relationship between IT 
and mission/program performance to sup-
port citizen-centered, customer-focused 
government; and 
•	
Maximize IT investments to better achieve 
mission outcomes. 
The FEA framework and its five supporting ref-
erence models (Performance, Business, Service, 
Technical and Data) are now used by departments 
and agencies in developing their budgets and 
setting strategic goals. Data forms the base of a 
transactional system and hence data integrity is 
essential for inter-operability.  The FEA Data 
Reference Model (DRM) defined by the Office of 
Management and Budget, US, provides a “com-
mon language” for diverse agencies to use while 
communicating with each other and with state 
and local governments seeking to collaborate on 
common solutions and sharing information for 
improved services (Evans, 2005). 
The potential uses of the model have been 
summarized as: 
•	
Provides a FEA mechanism for identifying 
what data the Federal government has and 
how it can be shared in response to a busi-
ness/mission requirement 
•	
Defines a frame of reference to facilitate 
Communities of Interest (which will be 
aligned with the Lines of Business) toward 
common ground and common language to 
facilitate improved information sharing 
•	
Provides guidance for implementing repeat-
able processes for sharing data Government-
wide 
Enterprise Architecture
If each division of an organization develops its 
own business processes and IT infrastructure, 
the end result may be lack of interoperability, 
duplicated Enterprise architecture components, 
functional gaps, and inability to share information. 
is required. (Tucker and Debrosse, 2003).
To avoid these problems, the federal govern-
ment now mandates the use of enterprise archi-
tectures (EAs) by federal agencies seeking to 
obtain funding for any significant IT investment. 
Enterprise architectures act as a kind of roadmap 
for the design, development, and acquisition of 
complex, mission-oriented information systems. 
Creating enterprise architecture requires par-
ticipation from many areas of the organization 
and a great deal of communication to plan and 
implement each stage of the process. The result is 

356  
E-Government and ERP
a roadmap that guides an organization through the 
modernization process and enables it to achieve 
its goals (Tucker and Debrosse, 2003).
Managing People and 
C mmunication
Managing the implementation requires a dedi-
cated team with adequate skills and a clear plan 
and agenda. It needs to be managed as any large 
project with clear milestones and deliverables. The 
migration to an enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) system is often fraught with peril. Research 
and experience show that communication is a key 
mechanism for breaking down barriers to change. 
Employees are better able to tolerate change if 
they understand why the change is important 
and if they feel the changes are being handled 
with fairness and transparency. Good commu-
nication throughout the enterprise builds trust 
and understanding. People must see how the 
changes will affect the organization, the citizens 
and themselves (Kauzlarich, 2003). The success 
of implementation of ICT projects depends on 
attitudinal readiness of the beneficiaries for 
accepting change (Bowonder, Mastakar, Sharma, 
2005).K
Knowledge Management
Knowledge Management is a combination of 
culture and technology. Culture drives knowl-
edge management while technology enables it. 
The following characteristics of government based 
on its structure and functions drive its knowledge 
management needs. 
•	
Knowledge which is actionable informa-
tion (also known as knowledge assets) is 
a central resource of the government. Ef-
fective functioning of government rests on 
effective acquisition and dissemination of 
knowledge.
•	
Similar knowledge requirements spread 
across the states, districts, and other local 
governments.
•	
Transfer of people across government depart-
ments calls for a repository of knowledge 
which can be used wherever they move.
•	
Proactive action is required if governments 
want to transform themselves into “antici-
patory governments” to meet the challenges 
of the emerging E-governance era (Misra, 
Hariharan, Khaneja, 2003).
EMERGING TRENDSRITRS
While ERP is concerned with the use of IT for 
efficient functioning of government departments, 
attempts are on to morph the customer relation-
ship management concepts for creating effective 
service for the citizens which has given birth to a 
new field of knowledge called Citizen Relation-
ship Management. (Kannabiran, Xavier, Anan-
tharaaj, 2005).  It is about making better use of 
the considerable amounts of information that 
government already collects (Smith, 2003). CzRM 
is about becoming “citizen-centric” (Nowlan, 
2001; Hunter & Shine, 2001).
A citizen can be defined as a consumer of 
public goods and services (Nowlan, 2001).  In the 
emerging e-Governance scenario, citizens should 
be treated as customers of business organizations, 
where serving citizens is the sole purpose of 
governments. Citizen Relationship Management 
(CzRM) is a division of customer relationship 
management that focuses specifically on how 
governmental bodies relate to their constituents 
(Xavier, 2002; Jha & Bokad, 2003). 
Post-ERP trends are geared towards increasing 
customer relationships and analysis of the market 
place for maximum profit. Data mining and Busi-
ness Intelligence now are not only supporters of 
growth but also act as initiators of growth. Today’s 
organizations are looking for applications to in-
spire and lead the way. IT is no more an internal 

  357
E-Government and ERP
system of automation but is now an external means 
of customer communication and market analysis 
(Tucker and Debrosse, 2003).
The services strategy entails building an in-
tegration layer that is separate and distinct from 
any of the software applications, including ERP. 
Services extract pieces of data and business 
logic from systems and databases and bundle them 
together into units that are expressed in ‘business’ 
terms. Implementing a service-oriented archi-
tecture can involve developing applications that 
use services, making applications available as 
services so that other applications can use those 
services, or both. (Ort, 2005).
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the 
emerging trend in enterprise computing because 
it holds promise of IT becoming more agile in 
responding to changing business needs. Gartner 
reports that “By 2008, SOA will be a prevailing 
software engineering practice, ending the 40-year 
domination of monolithic software architecture” 
A service-oriented architecture is an information 
technology approach or strategy in which applica-
tions make use of services available in a network 
such as the World Wide Web. 
The Internet aids good governance by in-
creasing transparency and customer-oriented 
service delivery. (Torres, Pina, Acerete, 2006) 
.By taking advantage of Internet protocols and 
technologies, one can minimize the need for ad 
hoc links between your company and your service 
supplier. Moreover, because the new service-
based applications run inside Web browsers, 
your staff can connect to the service provider from 
various locations. Another bonus of Web-based 
ERP applications is that the server location is 
transparent. (Apicella,  2000). 
C NCLUSIONCSI
  
In the ultimate analysis, we find that the electronic 
governance wave has started worldwide. With the 
technologies to implement electronic governance 
already available/understood by the government, 
managerial issues are of key importance. Change 
in the mindset of the people particularly at the 
top levels in the bureaucracy and policy making 
is important because it is they who provide the 
leadership.  
It is important to think beyond automation, 
and towards redesign of the basic workflow 
within the government. The next generation of 
e- Governance will not be mere automation, but 
will require a reengineering of the government 
structurally and functionally.
Enterprise modernization involves changes 
to all dimensions of an organization. It affects.

Government agencies have the advantage of 
applying lessons learned from the commercial 
business world, based on the analysis of both 
failures and successes of ERP implementations. 
Governments today understand the need for a 
consistent and flexible information infrastruc-
ture that can support organizational change and 
meet regulatory compliance. However, one cannot 
expect to revolutionize the government operations 
with ERP as it affects mostly the existing “back 
office” processes. This helps in optimizing the 
way things are done internally which is essential 
for building relationships with citizens, suppliers 
or partners.
If ERP is the focus of an effort to bring dramatic 
improvements to the way government functions, 
it will bring with it some post-ERP depression 
too. The most common reason for the performance 
problems is that people see a change in the way 
processes were executed earlier. When people 
can’t do their jobs in the familiar way and haven’t 

358

yet mastered the new way, they panic, and the 
operations go into spasms. 
A government that plans to implement ERP 
should expect “to be very committed, because 
it’s a long process,” advised Jan Heckemeyer, ad-
ministrator of Statewide Advantage for Missouri 
(SAM) II. It is especially important to involve 
every agency and resolve policy questions before 
configuring the system. “It drags out the process a 
bit, trying to build consensus and work out those 
issues,” she said. “But it’s time very well spent.”

Clean Data: For an organization to function 
effectively, data needs to be easily accessible both 
to customer sand internal users. Data is dispersed 
as governments like business organizations work 
in silos. To make this data accessible to others data 
conversion is a necessity as multiple sources and 
input formats, inconsistent styles and complex-
ity of data structures. For any new system to get 
started it is necessary to convert the existing data 
from legacy systems or manual records to fit into 
the new data structures. This is a critical factor 
in ERP implementation projects. By clean data it 
is meant that there are no duplicates definitions 
of data which cause inconsistency.
Customization: In an attempt to deal with 
the potential problems presented by existing 
information systems, there is a shift towards the 
implementation of ERP packages. Generally it 
is felt that ERP packages are most successfully 
implemented when the standard model is adopted. 
Yet, despite this, customisation activity still occurs 
reportedly due to misalignment of the functional-
ity of the package and the requirements of those in 
the implementing organisation. In such a situation 
the first thought that comes to a layman’s mind is 
to modify the software to provide the necessary 
report or layout.
Most ERP products are generic. Hence, some 
customisation is needed to suit the company’s 
needs. But optimal customisation in most cases 
is subjective with no definite rules as end-users 
are not always technically equipped to understand 
the far-reaching implications of the changes that 
they are demanding. There is always a risk of 
destabilising the core application. Customisa-
tion can make or break the implementation of an 
ERP. It is therefore necessary to strike the right 
balance.
E-Government: Government’s foremost job 
is to focus on safeguarding the nation / state and 
providing services to society as custodian of the 
nation’s / state’s assets. E-Government can there-
fore be defined as a technology-mediated process 
of reform in the way Governments work, share 
information, engage citizens and deliver services 
to external and internal clients for the benefit of 
both government and the clients that they serve.
Enterprise Architecture: An organisation 
has assigned roles and responsibilities, and estab-
lished plans for developing products and services. 
The scope of Enterprise Architecture can be de-
fined as encompassing the whole enterprise with 
confirmed institutional commitment to deliver 
products and services, both current and planned 
with clear transition plans. This in fact would 
define the organisation structure, functions and 
the relationships that would facilitate the organisa-
tion to meet its desired goals. This is extremely 
essential for enterprise modernisation.
Development of the enterprise architecture 
will typically involve: 
•	
Analysing the current architecture which 
will be a process of description, document-
ing the architecture "as-is" or "baseline" 
architecture; 
•	
Moving on to a definition of the architecture 
as it is planned to develop in the future - the 
architecture as it should be or "target" archi-
tecture which would align with the vision 
of the organisation.

E-Government and ERP
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): It is 
an integrated information system that integrates 
all departments within an enterprise. Evolving out 
of the manufacturing industry, ERP implies the 
use of packaged software rather than proprietary 
software. ERP modules may be able to interface 
with an organization’s own software with varying 
degrees of effort, and, depending on the software, 
ERP modules may be alterable via the vendor’s 
proprietary tools as well as proprietary or standard 
programming languages.
An ERP system can include software for manu-
facturing, order entry, accounts receivable and 
payable, general ledger, purchasing, warehousing, 
transportation and human resources. The major 
ERP vendors are SAP and Oracle specialising 
in transaction processing that integrates various 
departments.
Information infrastructure: It is the technology 
infrastructure required to manage information 
in an organisation. It consists of the computers, 
software, data structures and communication lines 
underlying critical services that society has come 
to depend on. It consists of information systems 
which cover critical aspects such as financial 
networks, the power grid, transportation, emer-
gency services and government services. This is 
required to implement an ERP system.
Inter-Operability: Various departments 
organize work in silos and tend to work inde-
pendently. Data forms the basis of a transaction 
processing system like ERP which integrates these 
departments so that basic data entered once can 
be used by many. More efficient exchanging and 
processing of data is required to provide a seamless 
execution of a service. Inter-operability therefore 
means the capability of different departments 
working together to provide a service.
Public Administration: Every facet of our 
daily lives is impacted in some way by the ac-
tions of the federal, state, or local bureaucracies 
that manage and organize the public life of the 
country and its citizens. Public administration is 
the study of public entities and their relationships 
with each other and with the larger world. It ad-
dresses issues such as:

Service-Oriented Architecture: Service-ori-
ented architecture (SOA) is the emerging trend in 
enterprise computing because it holds promise of 
IT becoming more agile in responding to changing 
business needs. Implementing a service-oriented 
architecture can involve developing applications 
that use services, making applications available 
as services. A service-oriented architecture is an 
information technology approach or strategy in 
which applications make use of services available 
in a network such as the World Wide Web.

A paradigm shift is occurring in identity management philosophy. User-focused identity management is 
one the emerging and most promising paradigms. One of the fundamental principles of the user-focused 
identity management frameworks is that the users control their identity formations, revelations, and in-
teractions. This means that users must be given the choice of which identities to use at which services; 
they have choice to decide what identity information will be disclosed to services and how those services 
will use their identity information. User-focused identity management frameworks are posed to make 
users’ online interactions easier and safer. In this chapter, we survey 11 of the most common user-focused 
identity management frameworks that are emerging, and their associated technologies. First, the chap-
ter discusses issues and challenges with domain-centric identity management paradigm and presents 
unique value propositions of user-focused frameworks. Secondly, this chapter provides a comprehensive 
and cohesive coverage of common user-focused identity management frameworks. Users, technologists, 
businesses; and systems and security managers will gain a comprehensive understanding of the concepts, 
frameworks and associated technologies relating to user-focused identity management.

Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management 
1. Inoduon
Digital identities come in all shapes and sizes. 
Usually people use different digital identities 
in different contexts depending on association 
of different information with each identity. For 
example, an identity that we use with a online 
retailer will allow access to personal informa-
tion such as credit card information, shipping 
information, purchasing history and personalized 
recommendations, the one used with social net-
working sites such as orkut.com does not. There 
are different methods and protocols to create new 
identities depending on context and user prefer-
ences. Insecure identity management has led to 
severe consequences. Recent research (Javelin, 
2007) shows that the number of US is 8.4 million 
in 2007 and total one-year fraud amount is $49.3 
billion in 2007.
Identity is a collection of unique characteristics 
of an entity which are either inherent or are as-
signed by another entity (Pfitzmann and Waidner, 
2004). A digital identity comprises electronic re-
cords that represent network principals, including 
people, machines, and services (Windley, 2005; 
March, 2003). To be able to create, maintain and 
use digital identities the deployment of a digital 
identity management system is required. The 
term “identity management” (Casassa, 2003) 
is currently associated with technologies and 
solutions, mainly deployed within enterprises, 
to deal with the storage, processing, disclosure 
and disposal of users’ identities, their profiles and 
related sensitive information. This infrastructure 
uses identities in the process of authentication 
and maps identifiers to the information needed 
for identification and authorization (Buell and 
Sandhu, 2003; Pfitzmann and Waidner, 2004). 
Identity Management covers the spectrum of 
tools and processes that are used to represent and 
administer digital identities and manage access 
for those identities (Allan et al., 2008). The three 
main business drivers for identity management 
solutions are security efficiency (lower costs 
and improved service), security effectiveness 
(including regulatory compliance) and business 
agility and performance (including workforce 
effectiveness and customer convenience) (Allan 
et al., 2008). 
Identity Management is a means to reduce such 
risks, representing a vital part of a company’s 
security and auditing infrastructure ((Buell and 
Sandhu, 2003). The secure and efficient adminis-
tration of numerous personal attributes that make 
up digital identities is one of the key require-
ments in open and closed networks. Especially 
in respect to confidentiality and integrity, the 
users themselves, rather than popular external 
threads like viruses, phishing, or pharming attacks 
represent the main risk (Stanton et al, 2005). As 
a result of incorrect account management and 
inadequately enforced security policies users 
accumulate a number of excessive rights within 
the organizations’ IT systems over time, violating 
the principle of the least privilege (Ferraiolo et 
al., 2003). Moreover, people have a hectic life and 
cannot spend their time administering their digital 
identities (El Maliki and Seigneur, 2007). Identity 
Management in open networks like the Internet 
has received tremendous attention throughout 
the last years with researchers. Although consid-
ered important, Identity Management in closed 
networks, however, has not gained comparable 
significance within the research community. 
In this paper, we survey eleven of the most 
common user-focused identity management 
frameworks that have evolved and their associ-
ated technologies. Contributions of the paper are 
two-fold. First, the paper discusses issues and chal-
lenges with domain-centric identity management 
paradigm and presents unique value propositions 
of user-focused frameworks. Secondly, the paper 
provides a very comprehensive and cohesive 
coverage of most common user-focused identity 
management frameworks. Users, technologists, 
companies and systems and security managers 
will gain a comprehensive understanding of the 
concepts, frameworks and associated technologies

Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management
relating to user-focused identity management. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
we discuss motivation and background for the 
user-focused identity management philosophy and 
frameworks. Section 3 briefly touches upon basic 
concepts and preliminaries that will be helpful in 
understanding discussions on the frameworks in 
Section 4. In Section 4, we discuss architecture 
and functioning of eleven user-focused identity 
management frameworks. Section 5 will present 
discussions and conclusions.
2. Bagound
While availability of plethora of information sys-
tems coupled with Internet’s dynamic evolution 
has provided users tremendous advantages such as 
shopping, banking, trading, socializing online, it 
has also put significant burden on them to maintain 
and provide credentials to all the online service 
providers. Users have different login-password 
combinations for each online service, or even 
different credentials for different roles within a 
service. As a result they tend to make password 
choices that are easy to remember, or even repeat 
the same login-password information on different 
services, which poses interesting and challenging 
security and privacy risks for both the users and the 
service providers. Identity Management solutions 
have been around and in use for a longtime now. 
The solution is to shift to identity management 
systems that are user-focused. Such a system will 
issue a digital identity for every user and will be 
able to control the complete lifecycle of the iden-
tity, including managing different contexts. An 
important requirement for such a system will be 
the single sign-on mechanism, whereby a single 
action of user authentication and authorization 
can permit the user to access multiple services. 
The benefits are improved convenience, security, 
accountability and privacy protection. 
Identity management is often considered a 
service providers’ area of work i.e. it is consid-
ered an activity to be managed by the service 
provider. Service providers often design identity 
management systems to be cost effective, eas-
ily manageable and scalable. Focus on user’s 
convenience and privacy concerns has not been 
primary requirements for such systems. This has 
resulted in poor usability. Users often have to 
remember multiple passwords for accessing dif-
ferent services, which is a minor inconvenience if 
users only access a few online services. However, 
with the growth in availability and usefulness of 
various online services, the traditional approach 
to identity management is already showing seri-
ous negative effects on the user experience. The 
industry has responded by proposing new identity 
management models to improve the user experi-
ence, but in our view these proposals give little 
relief to users at the cost of relatively high increase 
in server system complexity. A federated identity 
management system consists of software com-
ponents and protocols that handle the identity of 
individuals in a decentralized manner throughout 
their identity life cycle (Jøsang, 2007). There are 
several innovative user-focused identity manage-
ment frameworks that are emerging from different 
collaborative efforts, with mixed results though. 
In next section we discuss some of the common 
terms and philosophy behind these frameworks. 
In Section 4, we discuss eleven of these frame-
works in detail.

Lately, the term “user-focused” and “user-centric” 
identity management are being talked about a lot. 
Strong emergence of some of the frameworks is 
testament to the growing importance of user-fo-
cused identity management frameworks in person-
al and business applications alike. It is generally 
understood to be an innovative and different way 
of expressing the identity management philosophy 
as opposed to what we know as “domain-specific” 

  365
Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management 
or “enterprise-centric” approach that are widely 
used within provisioning, federation and even 
simplified sign-on situations.
There are other terms used to refer to the same 
user-focused philosophy, including Identity 2.0 
and “Personal Identity Framework”. However, 
underlying theme and approach of all these are 
towards resolving the same set of issues that are 
characterized by “domain-specific” approach. 
User-focused frameworks are gaining tremendous 
support and momentum. This is clearly reflected 
in the support by large companies like Yahoo, 
Google, Microsoft, OASIS and IBM, amongst 
others. A model of identity can be seen as follows 
(Spantzel et al., 2006):
•	
User who wants to have access to a ser-
vice
•	
Identity Provider (IdP): is the issuer of user 
identity
•	
Service Provider (SP): is the relay party 
imposing identity check
•	
Identity (Id): is a set of user’s attributes 
Id management systems are elaborated to 
deal
When making services and resources avail-
able through computer networks, issues of access 
management such as users, roles, access privileges 
and policies. In this context, identity management 
has two main parts, where the first consists of 
issuing users with credentials and unique identi-
fiers during the initial registration phase (Role of 
Identity Provider – IdP) and the second consists 
of authenticating users and controlling their 
access to services and resources based on their 
identifiers and credentials during the access stage 
(Role of Service Provider – SP). A problem with 
many identity management systems is that they 
are designed to be effective from the perspective 
of the identity providers(IdP) and service provid-
ers (SP), which creates inconvenience, security 
risks and poor usability. One basic shortcoming 
in traditional identity management systems is that 
they have largely ignored that it is often equally 
critical for users to identify service providers, as 
it is for service providers to authenticate users. 
Currently each SP  provides its own user interface 
and methods which means the user has to learn 
new techniques for each SP. Sometimes it can be 
only for one time use (e.g. site registration). By 
separating the identity component from the rest 
of the application, the user will be able to identity 
the SP, which also helps thwart phishing.
The basic premise of user-centric or user-
focused frameworks is that the users should be 
able to have more control over their identity and 
shared data during interactions with resources 
(web sites, vendors, government entities etc). In 
words of Dick Hardt, the user-focused identity 
would mean that (Hardt, 2006):
•	
The user is in the middle of a data transaction. 
This does not mean the user has to approve 
every transaction, but that the data always 
flows through the user’s identity agent. 
This does have user control and consent 
advantages that others point out, but I think 
more importantly, it provides huge scale 
advantages, as the Identity Provider does 
not have to have any prior knowledge of the 
Service Provider. The network of sites can 
build up ad-hoc, just like SMTP servers do 
today.
•	
The user has a consistent user experience. 
That does not mean that all users have the 
same user experience, but that a specific user 
is using the same identity agent over and 
over for each identity transaction, similar 
to the interfaces we all see for saving and 
printing files regardless of the application. 
Currently each SP provides its own user 
interface which means the user is learning a 
new interface, sometime for onetime use (eg. 
site registration) By separating the identity 
component from the rest of the application, 
the user also has more certainty on who the 
SP is which helps resolve phishing.

366  
Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management
Today, we have several types of systems that 
either demonstrate or are evolving to similar types 
of functionalities but with a twist. Among them 
we have services such as OpenID, Microsoft’s 
CardSpace, Sxip, YADIS, and so on. In next sec-
tion, we discuss functioning and architecture of 
eleven of most common ones in detail. However, 
to some extent, all are based on the idea that the 
identity verifier must be a third-party organization, 
(the identity provider) and that the users should in 
full control of their online selves. In other words, 
they provide users the mechanisms to authenticate 
only once, while having the ability to identify 
who they are depending on the context and their 
preferences. These frameworks are architectural 
constructs and technical product components that 
augment rather than replace existing IAM archi-
tectures and are intended to provide users with 
control of their identity attributes when register-
ing and accessing online services (Kreizman and 
Wagner, 2007). Client identity selectors, Web site 
integration components, and service definition 
and discovery components are common among 
different developers’ framework implementations 
(Kreizman and Wagner, 2007). We next discuss 
these frameworks in detail.

User-focused Identity Management frameworks 
are architectural constructs and technical product 
components that augment the existing identity 
management architectures and are intended to 
provide users with control of their identity at-
tributes when registering and accessing online 
services (Kreizman and Wagner, 2007). All of 
them have common philosophy that the identity 
verifier must be a third-party organization (the 
identity provider) and that the users should in full 
control of their online selves. In other words, these 
frameworks should provide users the mechanisms 
to authenticate only once, while having the ability 
to identify who they are depending on the context 
and their preferences. Table 1 lists the frameworks 
that are discussed next in this section. There are 
varying levels of success, thus far, that these 
frameworks have achieved. For example, OpenID 
developers can claim the most implementations; 
however, OpenID currently has rudimentary 
functionality and some security weaknesses. 
Microsoft recently released CardSpace, a full-
featured user-focused framework, along with 
Vista; however, it will be several years before

Vista adoption is commonplace. IBM, Novell 
and others have created Higgins, but component 
developments are predominantly prototypes 
(Kreizman and Wagner, 2007). It is obvious that 
these frameworks will have to be elaborated, 
also with respect to interoperability amongst 
themselves. This area is not only attracting the 
technology companies and experts, but it is also 
starting to catch the interest of millions of users. 
The website providers are getting engaged early 
on to catch the user-focused identity management 
wave to best meet the changing expectations of 
their users.
	
4.1 BaBndit
Bandit is a set of components that provide 
consistent identity services for Authentication, 
Authorization, and Auditing (Bandit Project, 
2008). The Bandit project manages communities 
that organizes and standardizes identity-related 
technologies in an open way, promoting both 
interoperability and collaboration. Bandit imple-
ments open standard protocols and specifications 
such that identity services can be constructed, 
accessed, and integrated from multiple identity 
sources (Bandit Project, 2008). Bandit components 
support different authentication methods and pro-
vide user-focused credential management. Using 
a common identity model, it is building additional 
services needed for Role Based Access Control 
(RBAC) and other controls to verify compliance 
with organizational policies. All components of 
Bandit are Open Source and work with industry 
standards and other open source projects to pro-
vide open, interoperable, decentralized, identity 
services.  The Bandit project is based on open 
source philosophy and fosters a secure enterprise-
computing environment on its own strengths. 
Bandit’s current emphasis is in the following 
areas (Bandit Project, 2008): 
•	
Provide simple application access to multiple 
identity stores 
•	
Support multiple and pluggable authentica-
tion methods to provide consistent applica-
tion access 
•	
Provide a simple application interface to 
unify system access based on roles 
•	
Allow applications to easily participate in 
a common compliance system 
4.2 Project CoCncordia
Project Concordia is a global initiative designed 
to drive interoperability across identity protocols 
by soliciting and defining real-world use cases and 
requirements for the usage of multiple identity pro-
tocols together in various deployment scenarios, 
and encouraging and facilitating the creation of 
protocol solutions in the appropriate homes for 
those technologies (Concordia, 2008). The way 
this project works is that they solicit issues and 
challenges in integrating multiple identity proto-
cols and derive and design a solution for it, which 
then is documented as use cases, requirements, 
and inter-op scenarios by project members who 
then work with a wide swath of the Internet com-
munity for documentation. All Concordia output 
is recorded on the wiki. Concordia welcomes 
participation by representatives of all identity-
related initiatives as well as the wider Internet 
community with an interest in the areas of work 
the project is undertaking. While members of 
the Liberty Alliance conceived of Concordia, it 
is organizationally independent and run as an 
open and self-regulating community. 
As expressed by the name (Roman goddess 
of agreement, understanding, and harmony), the 
goal of this group is to help drive the development 
of use-case scenarios where multiple identity 
specifications, standards and/or other initiatives 
might co-exist, recognizing heterogeneous de-
ployment environments of the marketplace. Based 
on this open knowledge gathering process, the 
group recognizes that additional specifications, 
profiles and/or services may need to be defined 
(Concordia, 2008).  The group’s goals are as fol-
lows (Concordia, 2008): 

368

•	
Drive development of a ubiquitous, interop-
erable, privacy-respecting layer for identity 
in order to: 
•	
Help drive deployment costs down 
•	
Assure implementers and deployers of better 
success and greater productivity 
•	
Lead to more commercial products and open 
source offerings, in turn leading to a healthy 
market 
•	
Facilitate new service offerings 
•	
Assure interoperability across this layer 
•	
Deliver confidence to implementers and 
deployers in implementing today with suc-
cessful interoperability tomorrow 
•	
Encourage strong, cross-sector, cross-
geography participation through an open 
development process 
4.3 Higgins
Higgins is also, like Bandit, an open source frame-
work that to enable users and systems to integrate 
identity, profile, and relationship information from 
across multiple heterogeneous systems (Higgins, 
2007). It enables enterprises to adopt, share across 
multiple systems and integrate to new or existing 
applications, digital identities and profiles. Hig-
gins unifies all identity interactions (regardless of 
protocol/format) under a common user interface 
metaphor called i-cards (Higgins, 2007). Higgins 
enables developers to write to a common API 
for Identity management, rather than needing to 
support multiple identity management systems 
individually. Software applications written to 
Higgins will allow people to store their digital 
identities and profile information in places of their 
choice and to share the stored information with 
companies and other parties in a controlled fash-
ion. Higgins relieves the developers from know-
ing all the details of multiple identity systems, 
thanks to one API that supports many protocols 
and technologies: MS CardSpace, OpenID, XRI, 
Bandit, etc. The Higgins Project is supported by 
IBM and Novell and competes with Microsoft’s 
Cardspace project. IBM and Novell’s participa-
tion in the project was announced in early 2006. 
The first code for the Higgins Project was written 
by Paul Trevithick in the summer of 2003 (IBM 
Press Release, 2006).
Higgins is being managed by the Eclipse 
open source foundation enables individuals to 
actively manage and control their online personal 
information, such as bank account, telephone and 
credit card numbers, or medical and employment 
records -- rather than institutions managing that 
information as they do today.  People will decide 
what information they want shared with trusted 
online websites that use the software (IBM Press 
Release, 2006). 
4.4 Microsoft CardspaceC
Microsoft CardSpace is the name for a new tech-
nology in Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 that 
simplifies and improves the safety of accessing 
resources and sharing personal information on 
the Internet. It helps developers build Web sites 
and software that are less susceptible to the most 
commonly deployed identity-related attacks such 
as phishing. By helping users better manage 
their personal information and control how it is 
released and to whom, Windows CardSpace can 
facilitate more secure online experiences such 
as online shopping, banking, and bill payment 
(Microsoft, 2008).
Microsoft CardSpace allows users to manage 
their digital identities from various identity provid-
ers and employ them in different contexts where 
they are accepted to access online services, where 
identities are represented to users as “Information 
Cards” (or “InfoCards”). One important class 
of applications where Information Card-based 
authentication can be used is applications hosted 
on web sites and accessed through web browsers 
(Chappell, 2006). CardSpace provides a consistent 
UI that enables people to easily use these identi-
ties in applications and web sites where they are 
accepted. By providing users with a way to select 

  369
Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management 
identities and more, CardSpace plays an important 
role in using open standard protocols to negotiate, 
request and broker identity information between 
trusted IdPs and SPs. 
When an Info-card-enabled application or 
website wishes to obtain information about the 
user, the application or website requests specific 
user details. The CardSpace UI, using the Card-
Space service, displays the user’s stored identities 
as visual Information Cards. The user picks the 
InfoCard to use and the CardSpace software con-
tacts the issuer of the identity to obtain a digitally 
signed XML token that contains the requested 
information (Wiki-Cardspace, 2008). CardSpace 
allows users to create personal (also known as 
self-issued) Information Cards, which can contain 
one or more of 14 fields of telephone book-qual-
ity identity information. Other transactions may 
require a managed InfoCard; these are issued by a 
third party identity provider that makes the claims 
on the person’s behalf, such as a bank, employer, 
or a government agency. Microsoft CardSpace is 
built on top of the Web Services Protocol Stack, 
an open set of XML-based protocols, including 
WS-Security, WS-Trust, WS-MetadataExchange 
and WS-SecurityPolicy. This means that any tech-
nology or platform that supports WS-* protocols 
can integrate with CardSpace (Wiki-Cardspace, 
2008). 
4.5 OpenIDI
OpenID is a shared identity service, which allows 
Internet users to log on to different web sites using 
a single digital identity, eliminating the need for 
a multiple user names and passwords. OpenID is 
a decentralized and open standard allowing lets 
users to control types and the amount of personal 
information they provide to web sites. Using 
OpenID-enabled sites, web users do not need to 
remember traditional authentication tokens such 
as username and password. Instead, they only 
need to be registered with any OpenID “identity 
provider” (IdP). Since OpenID is decentralized, 
any website can use OpenID as a way to allow 
users to sign in without requiring a centralized 
authority to confirm a user’s digital identity. Ope-
nID is increasingly gaining adoption among large 
sites, with organizations like AOL, BBC, Google, 
IBM, Microsoft, Orange, VeriSign, Yandex and 
Yahoo acting as providers (OpenID Foundation, 
2008; Riley, 2008; Krebs, 2008; IBM Press (2), 
2007 & Bergman, 2007). In addition, integrated 
OpenID support has been made a high priority in 
Firefox 3 and also Microsoft CardSpace.
The OpenID framework version 1.0 dealt only 
with http-based URL authentication protocols. 
OpenID 2.0, however, supports both URL and 
XRI user identifiers. A URL uses an IP or DNS 
resolution and is unique and is widely supported. 
OpenID can identify a user based on an URL or 
an XRI address. Light-Weight Identity (LID), the 
original URL-based identity protocol, is a set of 
protocols to represent digital identities on the 
Internet without relying on any central author-
ity. LID is now a part of OpenID. LID supports 
digital identities for humans, human organizations 
and non-humans (e.g. software agents, things, 
websites, etc.). It implements Yadis, a meta-data 
discovery service, for identity service discovery 
for URLs and XRI resolution protocol. Since, 
OpenID does not need a centralized authority 
for enrollment and it is can be considered as a 
form of federated identity management. Besides, 
IdP can randomly generate a digital address used 
specially for any SP to provide anonymity. 
The original OpenID authentication protocol 
was developed in May 2005 (Fitzpatrick, 2005 & 
Fitzpatrick[2], 2005) by Brad Fitzpatrick, creator 
of popular community website LiveJournal. Since 
then many leading software companies have an-
nounced their support to OpenID initiatives and 
to interoperability with their identity management 
products. The roster includes Symantec (Symantec 
press, 2007), Microsoft, JanRain, Sxip, VeriSign 
(Graves, 2007), AOL (Panzer, 2007) and Sun 
Microsystems. In June 2007, the OpenID Foun-
dation was officially formed in Oregon (OpenID 

370  
Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management
doc, 2007) and OpenID Europe Foundation was 
officially incorporated in Belgium. In early De-
cember 2007, Non-Assertion Agreements were 
collected by the major contributors to the pro-
tocol, and the final OpenID Authentication 2.0 
and OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0 specfications 
were ratified. 
4.6 NTT LTTabs’ SASSOSSS
NTT Labs - NTT Labs has developed SASSO, a 
personal Identity Provider that enables users to 
single-sign-on to a PC and leverage the strong 
authentication capabilities of the mobile phone 
to conduct a wide range of secure identity-based 
transactions. SASSO uses the increasingly ubiq-
uitous mobile phone as an Identity Provider (IdP) 
to allow users to access a Service Provider (SP) 
(Liberty Press, 2007). Once authenticated by their 
own mobile phone, the IdP on the mobile phone 
issues a SAML assertion signed by a private key 
and sends that assertion to SPs. The application 
drives strong authentication into online transac-
tions and leverages the convenience and privacy 
capabilities of the mobile phone to allow users 
to better control their own identity information 
(Liberty Press, 2007).
The application is currently targeted to the 
mobile industry by leveraging the FirstPass Digital 
Authentication Service of NTT DoCoMo, but the 
solution can be applied to any segment and region 
where strong authentication is required. SASSO 
is easy to use, leverages the mobile phone many 
people already have and does away with “token 
necklace” problems currently associated with 
many strong authentication solutions. SASSO 
helps mitigate security risks and increases oppor-
tunities for deploying security sensitive services 
by easily implementing strong authentication 
(Liberty Press, 2007). The solution reduces the 
time and costs of deploying new services and helps 
reduce customer churn. Interoperable Federation 
Technologies – To realize a “plug and play” us-
age model, universal interoperability among the 
implementation of SPs is important. By leverag-
ing the mobile phone as an identity-aware client, 
SASSO demonstrates a convergence of the Ope-
nID, Cardspace and SAML styles of user-centric 
identity management (Liberty Press, 2007).
4.7 SShibboleth
The Shibboleth System is a standards based, open 
source software package for web single sign-on. 
It allows sites to make informed authorization 
decisions for individual access of protected online 
resources in a privacy-preserving manner (Shibbo-
leth, 2008). Shibboleth is an Internet2 Middleware 
Initiative project and provides architecture and 
open-source framework for SAML based feder-
ated authentication and authorization infrastruc-
ture. This allows for cross-domain single sign-on 
and removes the need for content providers to 
maintain user names and passwords. Shibboleth 
is a web-based technology that implements the 
HTTP/POST, artifact, and attribute push profiles 
of SAML, including both Identity Provider (IdP) 
and Service Provider (SP) components. Identity 
providers (IdPs) supply user information, while 
service providers (SPs) consume this information 
and provide access to secure content. Shibboleth 
also provides extended privacy functionality al-
lowing the browser user and their home site to 
control the attributes released to each applica-
tion.
The Shibboleth project was started in 2000 
under the MACE working group to address prob-
lems in sharing resources between organizations 
with often wildly different authentication and 
authorization infrastructures. Shibboleth 2.0 was 
released on March 19, 2008, which is built upon 
SAML 2.0 specifications. Shibboleth is developed 
in an open and participatory environment, is 
freely available, and is released under the Apache 
Software License.

Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management 
4.8 SI
SXIP is a platform based on a fully decentralized 
architecture providing an open and simple set of 
processes to exchange identity information. Like 
OpenID, it is an URL-based protocol that allows 
a seamless user’s experience and follows the user-
focused paradigm. Users using SXIP for identity 
management have full control over their identities 
and have an active role in the exchange of their 
identity data to different sites. Therefore, user can 
benefit from the portable authentication to con-
nect with many websites. SXIP 2.0 has resolved 
many problems that arise from securely exchange 
identity data across sites. This provides the user 
with more choices and control over exchange of 
his/her identity data.
The Simple eXtensible Identity Protocol 
(SXIP) was designed to provide an Internet-scal-
able and  user centric identity architecture that 
imitates real-world interactions (El Maliki and 
Seigneur, 2007). If a SP has integrated SXIP in 
his Website, which is easily done by using SDKs, 
it is a Membersite. When a subscriber of SXIP 
would like to have access to this Membersite (El 
Maliki and Seigneur, 2007):
a.	
he types his URL address and clicks on [sxip 
in],
b.	
he types his URL identity issued by IdP 
(called Homesite),
c.	
the browser is redirected to the Homesite,
d.	
he enters his username and password, being 
informed that the Membersite has requested 
data, selects the related data and verify 
it and can select to automatically release 
data for other visit to this Membersite and 
confirms,
e.	
the browser is redirected to the Member-
site,
f.	
the user has access to the content of the 
site. 
4.9 WSFS/Liberty
In 2001, Liberty Alliance was formed as open 
standards governance organization for federated 
identity management standards and specifications. 
Deployed by organizations around the world, 
Liberty Federation allows consumers and users 
of Internet-based services and e-commerce ap-
plications to authenticate and sign-on to a network 
or domain once from any device and then visit or 
take part in services from multiple Web sites. This 
federated approach does not require the user to 
reauthenticate and can support privacy controls 
established by the user (Wiki-Liberty, 2008). 
With the deployment of Liberty Federation and 
Liberty Web Services continuously increasing, 
the Liberty Alliance has tracked well over one 
billion Liberty-enabled identities and devices at 
the end of 2006 (Wiki-Liberty, 2008). Its goals are 
to guarantee interoperability, support privacy, and 
promote adoption of its specifications, guidelines 
and best practices. 
Liberty Alliance also offers capabilities for 
SSO and linking accounts in the set of SPs’ in 
the boundary of the trust circle, which is referred 
to as Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF). On 
top of that it offers specifications for enhanced 
identity federation and interoperable identity-
based web services, known as Identity Web Ser-
vices Framework (ID-WSF). ID-WSF provides 
support for the new open standards such as 
WSSecurity developed in OASIS. The Security 
Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is another 
OASIS specification that provides guidelines 
to structure the identity assertions, protocols 
to exchange assertions, bindings for protocols 
to typical message transport mechanisms, and 
profiles. SAML consists of a set of specifications 
and XML schemas, which together define how to 
construct, exchange, consume, interpret, and ex-
tend security assertions for a variety of purposes. 
Basically, SAML is a set of XML and Simple 
Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based services 
and formats for the exchange of authentication 

372  
Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management
and authorization information between security 
systems. The Liberty Alliance specifications rely 
heavily on other standards such as SAML and WS-
Security. The WS-* (the Web Services protocol 
specifications) are a set of specifications from 
Microsoft and IBM. It is a part of larger efforts 
to define a security framework for web services, 
known as WS-*. It includes specifications such as 
WSPolicy, WS-Security Conversation, WS-Trust, 
and WS-Federation. WS-Federation has function-
ality for using pseudonyms and attribute-based 
interactions. WS-Trust has the ability to ensure 
security tokens as a means of brokering identity 
and trust across domain boundaries.
4.10 XRI/RIXDII
XRI(EXtensible Resource Identifier) is a scheme 
and resolution protocol for abstract identifiers 
compatible with Uniform Resource Identifiers and 
Internationalized Resource Identifiers, developed 
by the XRI Technical Committee at OASIS. The 
goal of XRI is to provide a universal format for 
abstract, structured identifiers that are domain-, 
location-, application-, and transport-indepen-
dent, so they can be shared across any number 
of domains, directories, and interaction protocols 
(Wiki-XRI, 2008). XRI is a scheme and resolution 
protocol for abstract identifiers compatible with 
Uniform Resource Identifiers and International-
ized Resource Identifiers, developed by the XRI 
Technical Committee at OASIS. The goal of 
XRI is to provide a universal format for abstract, 
structured identifiers that are domain-, location-, 
application-, and transport-independent, so they 
can be shared across any number of domains, di-
rectories, and interaction protocols. Note that the 
XRI specification and the reasoning supporting it 
are contended by the W3C Technical Architecture 
Group which has a draft finding which asserts 
that the same aims can be achieved with better 
interoperability using http: scheme URIs (XRI 
Technical Committee, 2008)
XRIs offer identifiers that can be persistent 
or transient, which suits security and scalability 
requirements for SSO systems. For any entity 
identification, they can support multiple contexts 
and multiple versions of the same logical resource. 
XRI data is exchanged using XDI (XRI Data 
Exchange) - Data Sharing protocol. Both XRI 
and XDI are being developed under the support 
of OASIS. I-name and I-number registry services 
for privacy-protected digital addressing use XRI. 
It can be used as an identifier for persons, ma-
chines and agents. URIs are very widely used as 
identifiers over the Internet. However there are 
limitations of the standard URI syntax that is not 
able to accommodate the growth of the Internet 
technologies, protocols and users that has led to 
new requirements for resource identifiers. With 
the growth of XML, Web services, and other 
ways of leveraging the Internet to automated, 
machine-to-machine communications, new set of 
requirements emerged. One of such requirements 
was internationalization which was taken care 
of by developing a new form of URI called an 
Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) jointly 
by the W3C and IETF. The IRI specifications are 
built on the URI standards. The XRI TC has also 
developed a resolution protocol based on HTTP(S) 
and simple XML documents called Extensible 
Resource Descriptor Sequence (XRDS).
4.11 YADISIS
Yadis is a Communications protocol for discovery 
of digital identity authentication services, such as 
OpenID, and related data sharing services. This 
allows digital identities to be composed from 
several different services, and lets Internet us-
ers define what information they expose to third 
parties (Wiki-Yadis, 2008). Yadis sites identify 
people and services from traditional URLs (web 
site addresses) or “addresses” for the Yadis docu-
ments. The basic assumption is that identities can 
be addressed with URLs, or with other identifiers 
(such as i-names) that can be resolved to URLs. 

  373
Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management 
For example, a user called Joe Smith might have 
his Yadis home page at <www.joesmith.net>, 
or perhaps <www.webitesforall.com/joesmith>. 
Yadis follows the REST-ful, “small pieces loosely 
joined” paradigm that has proven to be success-
ful in the development of the web (Yadis Site, 
2008). The owner of any Yadis URL can choose 
which protocols to support. Similarly, a Relying 
Party such as a website accepting Yadis URLs as 
identifiers can select an appropriate protocol to 
use for authentication (Wiki-Yadis, 2008). This 
can allow existing web sites, like blogs, to easily 
implement basic Yadis functionality (for instance, 
redirecting users who arrive at the blog to relevant 
information about the person the blog belongs to) 
while also making it possible to build many more 
advanced applications (for example, allowing 
complex queries of a site-owner’s information 
to be submitted directly to the Yadis site as an 
extension of the URL itself) (Miller, 2008).
Yadis was initiated by developers of the Light-
Weight Identity (LID) and OpenID protocols; and 
then furthered with collaboration from mem-
bers of the OASIS XRI Technical Committee, 
particularly those working on i-names (Miller, 
2008). However, as Yadis is an open initiative, 
it is hoped that other developers will start using 
Yadis lightweight capabilities description, making 
possible a “mix and match” approach to building 
Yadis-enabled applications, enabling application 
developers to choose their own balance between 
ease of implementation on one hand, and range 
of features on the other (Miller, 2008).
The Yadis specification provides (Miller, 
2008):
•	
A general-purpose identifier for persons and 
any other entities, which can be used in a 
variety of services.
•	
A syntax for a resource description docu-
ment identifying services available using 
that identifier and an interpretation of the 
elements of that document. 
•	
A protocol for obtaining that resource de-
scription document, given that identifier. 
5. DISCUSSIONuonandConluon
Identity management has turned into a double-
edged sword over the past few years. Users have 
to manage their identities by registering different 
subsets of their personal information at service 
providers and subsequently selecting and using 
these different profiles appropriately (Pfitzmann 
and Kohntopp, 2009; Bonatti and Samarati, 2000). 
There are many research projects that focus some 
of shortcomings of identity management (Cameni-
sch et al., 2005; Bhargav-Spantzel et al., 2005). 
One of the fundamental principles of the 
user-focused identity management frameworks is 
that the users must be in control of their identity 
formations, revelations and interactions. This 
implies that users must be given the choice of 
which identities to use at which services, they 
must know what identity information will be 
disclosed to those services if they use them, and 
they must be informed how those services will use 
the information disclosed. User-focused identity 
management frameworks are posed to makes 
it easier and safer for users the when accessing 
resources on the Internet. It lets users select 
from among a portfolio of their digital identities 
and use them at Internet services of their choice 
where they are accepted. User-focused identity 
management frameworks require that a site prove 
its identity to a user before the user ever supplies 
any information to the site. Not only users, but 
businesses will also benefit from User-focused 
identity management frameworks. User-focused 
identity management frameworks will have the 
following business impact (Kreizman and Wag-
ner, 2007):
•	
Reduced data entry burden when register-
ing and revisiting service providers, and a 
hopefully increased willingness to provide 

374  
Emerging Frameworks in User-focused Identity Management
personal information because it is more 
convenient to do so
•	
Reduced sign-on for business contexts (sets 
of related services) where credentials can be 
shared
•	
Common user experience for selecting 
the appropriate digital identities (sets of 
attributes) and providing them to service 
providers — an electronic analogy for wal-
lets, purses and remotely managed vaults 
that hold a combination of context-specific 
identity
•	
Credentials and attributes or claims similar 
to driver’s licenses, library cards, credit cards 
and store-brand loyalty cards
•	
A standard development framework for 
developers that can be abstracted from and 
can make use of disparate identity protocols 
and identity repositories
User-focused identity management frame-
works such as OpenID, Microsoft’s CardSpace, 
Sxip, YADIS, and others are here to improve the 
way we identify ourselves online and eliminate 
the necessity to register for every single service 
(Petkov, 2007). These frameworks deal with the 
problems of digital identity by managing and 
disclosing identity information in an open and 
standard way (El Maliki and Seigneur, 2007). All 
identity systems will coexist and they will all offer 
sufficient unique capabilities that will allow them 
to grow independently to some extent. In spite 
of the unique capabilities, there is a significant 
degree of duplication of functionality between 
the various systems. A convergence between the 
systems would eliminate such duplications and 
result in a simpler identity landscape (El Maliki 
and Seigneur, 2007). 
User centricity is a significant concept in user-
focused identity management frameworks that 
provides for stronger user control and privacy. We 
discussed development of requirements, architec-
tures, and technologies for user-focused identity 
managements in the chapter. We believe that many 
of the threats, usability issues, uncertainties and 
compliance concerns can be managed well by 
wide adoption of user-focused identity manage-
ment frameworks.  Widespread deployment of the 
user-focused identity management frameworks 
have the potential to solve several problems en-
gendering from domain-centric models of identity 
management and to foster the long-term growth 
of the Internet by making the online world more 
trustworthy, and easier to use. In conclusion, 
we believe a user-focused approach to identity 
management is a very promising way to improve 
the user experience and the security of online 
interactions. This has the potential to stimulate 
increased adoption of online services.

Abstracta
From the Knowledge Management perspective, Knowledge distribution is a critical process in organiza-
tions. As many of the other Knowledge-related processes, it has received basic support from Informa-
tion Technologies in the form of databases and repositories, client-server systems and other standard 
IT. Nevertheless, most basic IT tools fail to provide the flexible environment Knowledge distribution 
needs to be effective in many organizations. In this chapter we review some very advanced IT that are 
being proposed for supporting Knowledge distribution processes. Even though they are not mainstream 
technologies nowadays, they show actual trends that are expected to materialize in future generations 
of IT for Knowledge distribution.
Inodu
on
The key factors that determine success in compa-
nies and national economies rely on effectiveness 
in gathering and managing knowledge nowadays 
(United Nations, 2000).  In economies based on 
knowledge, creation, distribution, and use of 
information to generate knowledge increases 
opportunities for development. In this context of 
increasing economic importance of knowledge, 
Knowledge Management (KM, Beckman, 1999) 
has emerged with the goal of taking advantage 

  379
Next-Generation IT for Knowledge Distribution in Enterprises
of information and knowledge every company 
owns. Most authors in KM agree with the need 
for executing the processes of generating, storing 
and distributing knowledge.
The process of generating knowledge encour-
ages continuous improvement and growth through 
innovation, generation of new ideas, pattern 
recognition and development of new processes 
(Ruggles, 1997). Storing process implies keeping 
information in the organization repository; this 
is the organizational memory of the company. 
Finally, distribution has the goal of making avail-
able useful information to the members of the 
company in the shortest time. This fact allows 
users to access the information no matter where 
they are.
One of the strongest catalysts of KM has 
been the necessity for managing large amounts 
of information efficiently (Carrillo, 1999). Aside 
from the importance of generating and storing 
the necessary information in order to generate 
knowledge, the efficient distribution of such 
information has become a relevant subject last 
years. In companies, sharing knowledge resources 
via distribution is essential for two reasons: first, 
because it avoids duplicating efforts to obtain 
and maintain knowledge. Second, because it 
encourages consistent decision-making since all 
employees have access to the same knowledge 
(Probst, Raub & Romhardt, 1999).
In spite of its importance, most of the informa-
tion stored in a company repository is never used 
since it is not distributed efficiently. Nowadays, 
one of the most challenging issues is the time 
spent by employees searching for information 
already stored in their repositories (Dalkir, 2005). 
Introduction of IT in every aspects of society has 
allowed storing and generating gigabytes of infor-
mation, however, it hardly reaches relevant people 
at the right time.  According to Sarnikar (2007), in 
order to accomplish an efficient information flow, 
proactive KM technologies are required; these 
technologies should automate and control distribu-
tion of information. Although many techniques 
of distribution and filtering have been developed 
last years, providing the right knowledge to users 
in the right context, continues being a complex 
issue (Sarnikar, 2007). 
We can safely conclude that IT has not sup-
ported in a satisfactory way Knowledge Distribu-
tion (KD) processes. In this situation, solutions 
could come from several fronts:
•	
Develop and refine KM strategies that could 
improve KM processes efficiency with the 
current IT sophistication level;
•	
Introduce more flexible and sophisticated 
IT tools that could provide a more flexible 
and better support to KM processes.
In this chapter we investigate the second pos-
sibility, though having in mind that KM strategies 
refinement is also an essential issue, which is 
being explored by researchers and practitioners 
(Liebowitz, 2005).
Bagound
 
Many IT tools and strategies have been used for 
supporting KD. For the sake of classifying them, 
we could identify two “pure” strategies for sharing 
knowledge that they support (Albino, 2004)
1.	
Codification: Tries to “encode” that is, 
make explicit knowledge. This could take 
the form of manuals, guides, filled forms 
eventually stored in a database, or any sym-
bolic information that encodes knowledge 
available to all or some individuals in the 
organization.
2.	
Socialization: Leaves knowledge in people 
instead of expressing it with symbols. This 
kind of knowledge is sometimes called 
“tacit” knowledge. The associated way of 
transferring it is by meetings or any other 
form of people interaction.

380  
Next-Generation IT for Knowledge Distribution in Enterprises
Current support for socialization strategies is 
very limited. It is restricted to manage the condi-
tions required for people’s interaction, such as 
calendar or schedule management. Nevertheless, 
even schedule management could be very complex 
when it is necessary to take into account multiple 
criteria, such as, for instance, that some meetings 
could be moved or cancelled but not others, or that 
not every participant is equally important, and 
some have special rights about the meeting, etc. 
We will go back to these issues when discussing 
advanced IT.
Most IT support is for codification-based pro-
cesses, such as message distribution or repository 
storage and access. This is of course no surprise: 
computers handle symbolic information, and 
codification strategies are aligned with symbolic 
representation of information and knowledge.
There are many stages or aspects of codifi-
cation-based knowledge distribution that could 
be IT-supported, but we will consider capture, 
storing, and actual distribution.
K owledge Capture SuCSpport
Usually symbolic information is typed, not any-
more in a typewriter, but in a computer text editor. 
Text editors could be a general purpose editor, 
like Microsoft Word, of they could be specialized 
editors for a specific task or context, so that they 
guide users at filling in information. Further, text 
editors could be stand-alone -running on the user’s 
computer- or web-based -controlled by a server, 
typically in an intranet. Normally web-based 
capture interfaces are better suited for guiding 
the user through a form-filling task.K
Knowledge StSorage SuSpport
Symbolic knowledge and data, just as any informa-
tion, could be stored for sharing purposes either in 
paper or on a computer-based system. Of course, 
having explicit knowledge on a computer system 
could, at least potentially, make it amenable to 
more efficient search processes, as well as less 
expensive distribution: indeed generating infor-
mation copies is almost a free process (“free” as 
in “free beer”), given the ever declining prices 
of computer storage.K
Knowledge Actual Distribution S
Support
Knowledge text-based distribution could consist 
of a direct user-to-user communication, or it could 
consist of a more elaborate process involving first 
storing knowledge in a computer-based system. 
Direct user-to-user communication has been sup-
ported for a longtime by basic IT in the form of 
text messages: users generate messages composed 
by text that are distributed to other users. This can 
be classified in synchronous and asynchronous 
message distribution, meaning that, in the first 
case, messages are delivered “in the moment” 
they are sent, like in the instant messages software 
(for instance, Microsoft IM, AIM or other “chat” 
system). Asynchronous messages are delivered to 
be read at any later time by the recipient, like in 
the email messages; the user does not have to be 
“connected” at the moment the message is sent. 
A particularly important form of asynchronous 
knowledge distribution is computer-based access 
of digital repositories: knowledge is put in by a 
user, with no explicit recipient in mind, and even-
tually another user reads that knowledge. These 
repositories could be databases, or websites, or 
any combination of them, and are accessed in 
modern systems though a web browser.
Knowledge and information in repositories 
could be distributed to the user either by user’s ini-
tiative (“pull” mode) or system’s initiative (“push” 
mode). Push modality means that a system delivers 
information to a user without the user initiative 
(like the email delivery) whereas pull modality 
means that a user actively gets information from 
an electronic resource, typically the Web. We can 
identify push modality with Negroponte idea of 
changing human-computer interaction from a 

  381
Next-Generation IT for Knowledge Distribution in Enterprises
“point-and-click” style (that is, user clicks and 
selects an object as well as a function to be per-
formed to the object) to a “delegation” style, where 
the computer takes care of a complex task over a 
period of time, finding the appropriate moments 
to accomplish it (Negroponte, 1996).
Typical “push technologies” (also called 
“Webcasting”, “Netcasting” and other names) 
were proposed in the 90s as an alternative way 
to distribute Information and Knowledge to 
users (Chin, 2003). In this type of systems, the 
user selects information “channels,” and/or fills a 
“user profile” and gets updated information from 
these selected channels. Push systems sounded 
promising, because the user could be relieved 
from getting information updated, which is for 
sure a boring and repetitive task. Advocators of 
push systems claimed that users would be poured 
with a wealth of useful information by just staying 
“plugged” to their information sources. Though 
push systems have made their way since the 90’s, 
their application as a general information distri-
bution paradigm is nowadays fairly restricted, 
mainly due to problems related to the bandwidth 
efficiency, and the flooding of information to users. 
Nevertheless, the idea of distributing information 
by the system’s initiative –that is, Negroponte’s 
delegation- remains valid, and could be put into 
practice using other technologies, as we will se 
later in this chapter.

Many modern IT-based systems give support 
to processes combining knowledge capture, 
knowledge storage and knowledge distribution 
or access, in many forms. On this subject, there 
are tools as common as e-mails clients, as there 
are solutions that incorporate, in a single package, 
a set of different solutions that were developed 
separately, such as documents managers, collab-
orative work platforms and knowledge portals, 
among others.
E-mail clients allow users to share their 
knowledge through text editors; how well the 
captured text represents useful knowledge is of 
course another question. At the same time, they 
allow users to store and organize the information 
captured through folders organized by the user 
owner of the information. Finally, these tools allow 
distributing information to other e-mail users. On 
the other hand, documents management’s tools, 
in addition of the typical text editors functions, 
incorporate functionalities that allow them to 
store and organize all the information generated 
in a document repository that only the managers 
administrate and give the right to the other users 
to subscribe to folders so that the information 
could be distributed with a minimal intervention 
from those users.  Collaborative work platforms 
provide virtual spaces where users can use 
asynchronous tools such as e-mail, forums and 
boards; and synchronous tools such as chats, web 
conferences and videoconferences. All of these are 
used to capture, store and distribute knowledge 
on a daily basis. Finally, in many big enterprises, 
portals are the single door to multiple services 
where e-mail clients, documents management’s 
tools, collaborative work spaces and many other 
services are accessed.
Nevertheless, most current IT systems support-
ing KD fall short at linking the right knowledge 
to the right user. As it has been mentioned at the 
introduction section, many users spent hours 
looking for the knowledge they need, while most 
stored knowledge never gets actually consulted. 
This is of course a profoundly unsatisfactory 
situation.
We do not pretend that IT support is the only 
critical issue for advancing the state of KD, but 
we do claim that more sophisticated IT systems 
could make KD systems much more useful. In 
this section we review some of the most relevant 
very advanced technologies that could support 
future KD systems. 

382  
Next-Generation IT for Knowledge Distribution in EnterprisesS
Support for SoScialization StSrategies
Here we discuss ways of supporting direct people 
interaction. Of course, one of the main issues here 
is how to know with who to interact. As trivial as 
it could sound, in large organizations it is actually 
very difficult to pinpoint the expert we need to 
consult. In real organizations, informal reputation 
networks are formed, through a “mouth to mouth” 
word spread. This process can be supported by 
the presence of “Social Networks” IT tools.
There are some proposals for automatically 
calculating the “reputation” of human experts, 
meaning by reputation the reliability, or the de-
gree of expertise. Social networks exist in any 
company and can be used to interpret the way 
in which people are interacting. With the help 
of social network analysis (SNA) and the net-
work visualization tools, the information of the 
organization’s knowledge map can be analyzed. 
This map allows you to see how the knowledge 
flows inside such organizations (Liebowitz, 2005). 
SNA consists of mapping and measuring the rela-
tionship between people, organizations and other 
information processing entities (Hanneman, 2002, 
cited by Liebowitz, 2005).  When you combine 
SNA tools and the network visualization software 
you can make analysis in distinct areas such as 
sociology, organizational behavior and many other 
disciplines (Liebowitz, 2005).
S mantic SuSpport for Accessing 
R positories
Many digital repositories are so large that users 
get lost when navigating them, undermining then 
the possibility of linking the right knowledge to 
the right user. Of course, one low-technology 
issue is how to well-structure the repository, but 
there are other options as well.
There have been some recent proposals for 
automatically taking into account the meaning 
of documents within an IT environment, so the 
system could better guide the user to the knowl-
edge he/she is looking for in a digital repository, 
which could be internal to the organization or even 
the entire internet. With the title of “Semantic 
Web” (Berners-Lee, 2001) a set of technologies 
and standards have been proposed, such as XML 
and RDF. In the Semantic Web (SW) initiative, 
documents are self-described, and there is the 
possibility of automatically reason about the 
knowledge it contains. The SW markup languages 
allow to declare knowledge in “ontologies”, which 
are a form of declarative definition of classes and 
objects. Berners-Lee sees the collection of inter-
related web pages written in the SW standards as 
a huge knowledge base, which can be consulted 
from anywhere. Of course, restricted collections 
within a given organization can be formed using 
the SW technologies, taking the role of knowledge 
repositories.
The SW initiative has been considered as a very 
solid trend; The Gartner group recently reported 
that Semantic Web (with related technologies 
such as ontologies, metadata management, and 
taxonomies) is one of the top strategic technologies 
for 2005 (Gartner, 2005). Nevertheless, the cur-
rent Semantic Web is marginal (an estimated ten 
millions semantic documents, compared to some 
11.5 billion documents indexed in the main search 
services (the actual internet size is much larger). 
Though the Semantic Web is growing faster that 
the regular web, it cannot get a comparable size 
in the near future. But of course this argument 
does not undermine the possibility of writing 
internal enterprise-level digital repositories using 
SW technologies, and actually we believe this 
could be beneficial.
Other initiatives for considering meaning of 
items in a repository rely on quantitative meth-
ods. For instance (Martinez, 1998) proposed a 
way of automatically finding the topic of a given 
text, from a predefined set of topics. Of course, 
having the topic of each item as a metadata in a 
repository would be extremely helpful for users, as 
they would be able to restrict searches to specific 
topic, without the need of thoroughly classifying 

  383
Next-Generation IT for Knowledge Distribution in Enterprises
the repository in topics. This could be particularly 
useful for existing repositories with tons of poorly 
classified information. 
In this line, (Ramirez, 2006) proposed a fully 
automatic mechanism for building a semantic 
“map” of a given repository, where main topics 
are identified, and their relative semantic distances 
are calculated. Such a mechanism, called “Se-
mantic Contexts” by its authors, could be applied 
to search knowledge in a repository, but not only 
using keywords, like in current “Google style” 
search technology, but using topics or “knowledge 
areas” to guide the search, without any need of a 
prior thematic classification of information and 
knowledge. For instance, assume a user is trying 
to find information items about how to display 
pictures on a Palm PDA device. Let us assume 
that the intranet has a “Google style” search facil-
ity. This could bring results about, for instance, 
items about pictures of palm trees, about pictures 
of Palm devices, about pictures of Palm beach in 
California, and so on. A state-of-the-art search 
service is just unaware of what the information 
items are about. But with Semantic Context-en-
hanced search, the user could be presented a choice 
of related topics, like the ones we just mentioned. 
Once the user selects one topic, all the retrieved 
items would belong to that topic. This, of course, 
would help very much to focus the search and give 
to the user more relevant results.R
Recommendation SystemsS
To “recommend” a repository item to a user 
implies that some other user, or the system, con-
siders that item contains relevant knowledge for 
that user. IT support for recommendations could 
consist of helping humans to recommend to other 
humans, or automated systems, which provide 
recommendations to humans with no direct hu-
man intervention.
Recommender systems have been classified 
into content-based and social systems (Basu, 
1998). In a content-based system, also called 
“intrinsic” or “item-based”, recommendations 
are based on the characteristic of the item to 
recommend. Typically, users are classified ac-
cording to their preferences, as well as the items, 
so when an item’s characteristics matches a user 
interests, then that item is recommended to the 
user. For instance, in a movie recommendation 
application, users would be asked to give their 
preferences, according to genres, preferred ac-
tors and so on, and the system would recommend 
movies matching those characteristics. Of course, 
intrinsic recommender systems suffer from the 
difficulties in classifying both users and items, 
though automatic learning techniques have been 
applied to this (Al Mamunur Rashid, 2002).
Social recommender systems, in contrast to 
“intrinsic” ones, do not analyze item’s character-
istics, but instead try to identify groups of users 
with similar sets of preferred items. For instance, 
if you share more than 90% of preferred movies 
with some other users, there are many chances 
that you will like any new film recommended by 
those users; this conclusion does not rely on the 
movie intrinsic characteristics. A very successful 
form of social recommendation is collaborative 
filtering; it is applied on a daily basis in online 
stores like Amazon (Linden, 2003).
Now let us consider the application of recom-
mender systems to information distribution from 
digital repositories. In this area we do find some 
works, both “intrinsic” and “social”, but we cannot 
say they have become mainstream.
JITIK (Brena, 2001) is a Knowledge and In-
formation distribution system which could also be 
viewed as an “intrinsic” recommendation system. 
In JITIK, users are classified according to their 
interests and position in the organization (that is, 
their roles and responsibilities, their department 
or division, etc.), and information to be distributed 
is also classified. Then the matching between in-
formation and users is done by means of “rules” 
of the form “if-then-do…”. Conditions in the “if” 
part of rules can include users and items classifi-
cations, but also conditions currently prevailing 

384  
Next-Generation IT for Knowledge Distribution in Enterprises
in the system, such as the date or hour, or some 
event that just has occurred. Some internal pro-
cesses in the organization could generate events. 
For example, in a university library, when a book 
is added to the catalog, professors interested in 
an area related to the one of that book should be 
notified. Of course, we are assuming that internal 
processes are “computerized” or leave some sort of 
“trace” in the information systems environment of 
the organization, so that the corresponding event 
in JITIK could be generated. Further, processes 
external to the organization can be periodically 
and automatically monitored in search for some 
specific condition, such as the modification of a 
web page, a value of some variable in a database, 
and so on.
Consideration of events in JITIK makes it 
an “opportune” information recommendation 
system, because JITIK tries to distribute infor-
mation “when it is needed”. Of course, the logic 
of when to distribute which information to who, 
is encoded in its conditional rules.
“Opportune” or “just-in-time” information 
distribution systems face the challenge of deter-
mining what the user is doing at a point in time, and 
even what are their goals and information needs; 
this has been called “user modeling” (Horvitz, 
1998). In some cases this could be easily inferred 
detecting a very particular event. Imagine, for 
instance that a new student in a university gets 
a registration at the library; then, we can as-
sume this is a good moment to send him/her the 
information about library policies. But there are 
much more complicated situations, that combine 
several conditions, some of them could not be 
registered in the information system, such like 
exact user location.
User modeling from detection of events in the 
physical world is a recent and very challenging 
area (Heckmann, 2006). It is a kind of investiga-
tor work, where detected events in the physical 
world as taken as clues for determining the user 
activity. Of course, some prior knowledge about 
the user is necessary for taking advantage of 
clues. For instance, if it is detected (for instance, 
using a radio-frequency RFID chip) that the user 
is in a meeting room, it is likely that he/she is in 
a meeting, belief that would be reinforced if we 
know other people are at the same room. Prior 
knowledge about a user could include his/her usual 
schedule, people he/she meets or talks to, his/her 
duties and roles in the organization and so on.
Other advanced technology proposed for rec-
ommender systems is argumentation, which is a 
form of automated reasoning (Amgoud, 2000). 
In an argumentation system, a kind of dialog 
is constructed between several participants. In 
contrast with centralized automated reasoning 
systems, in argumentation each participant could 
have private information and interests. A specific 
proposal for using argumentation applied to in-
formation distribution (which is indeed a form of 
recommendation) is given by Chesnevar (2005). 
In this proposal, the question of whether or not to 
distribute a specific information item to a given 
user is calculated using a special form of argu-
mentation called “defeasible logic programming” 
(DeLP). In DeLP, a distinction is made between 
strict rules, that are always valid, like “if X is an 
elephant, then X is a mammal”, and defeasible 
rules, that are tentative, like “if X is an elephant, 
X does not fly”. When this last rule is applied 
to an individual “dumbo” gives the conclusion 
that dumbo does not fly; but if we know dumbo 
does fly, we “defeat” the defeasible rule. A valid 
argument is a chain of defeasible and strict rules 
which has no defeaters. 
So, the task of a DeLP argumentation-based 
information distribution system is to find a valid 
argument, using strict and defeasible rules, of 
why a certain information item should or should 
not be distributed. In such a context, defeasible 
rules express general preferences of users or the 
organization as a whole. Argumentation proved 
to be an extremely flexible method for taking in-
formation distribution decisions, as it is presented 
in Chesnevar (2005).

  385
Next-Generation IT for Knowledge Distribution in EnterprisesI
Intelligent Agents
Another relevant advanced IT for Knowledge and 
Information distribution is the Intelligent Agents 
technology (Wooldridge, 2001). In fact it is not a 
single technology, but a family of related technolo-
gies; they encompass many aspects, which relate to 
the delegation paradigm (such as communication, 
coordination techniques, cooperation, autonomy, 
competition, distribution, mobility, among other 
issues). Agents are long-life autonomous computa-
tional processes which thrive to achieve their goals 
(eventually goals delegated by a user or another 
agent), and which interact with the external world 
and with other agents. Intelligent Agents offer 
the promise of much more modularity, flexibility 
and adaptability when building complex systems, 
particularly the so-called “multiagent” systems, 
consisting of several interacting agents.
Intelligent agents can be delegated Knowledge 
and Information distribution tasks, as shown in 
Brena (2001). The JITIK system –mentioned be-
fore in this chapter- is a multiagent-based system 
for disseminating pieces of IK among the mem-
bers of a large or distributed organization, thus 
supporting a Knowledge-management function. 
It is aimed to deliver the right IK to the adequate 
people just-in-time.
The JITIK agent model is shown in Figure 1. 
Personal Agents work on behalf of the members 
of the organization. They filter and deliver useful 
content according to user preferences. The Site 
Agent provides of Information and Knowledge to 
the Personal Agents, acting as a broker between 
them and Service agents. Service agents collect 
and detect IK pieces that are supposed to be rel-
evant for someone in the organization. Examples 
of service agents are the Web Service agents, 
which receive and process external requests, as 
well as monitor agents, which are continuously 
monitoring sources of Information and Knowl-
edge (web pages, databases, etc.). Other Service 
agents monitor at time intervals the state of an 
information resource, like a web page, data in an 
enterprise’s database, etc. The Ontology agent 
contains knowledge about the interest areas for 
the members of the organization and about its 
structure. That knowledge is hierarchically de-
scribed in the form of taxonomies, usually one 
for interest areas and one describing the structure 
Figure 1. JITIK agent architecture

386  
Next-Generation IT for Knowledge Distribution in Enterprises
of the organization. For example, in an academic 
institution, the interest areas could be the science 
domains in which the institution is specialized, and 
the organizational chart of the institution gives the 
structure of the organization. Site agents are the 
heart of a “cluster” composed by one site agent 
and several personal agents served by the former. 
In an organization, clusters would be associated 
to departments, divisions, etc., depending on the 
size of them. Networks can be made up connect-
ing several site agents. Distributed organizations 
like multinational companies would have a web 
of many connected site agents.
Among the services provided by JITIK we 
have the following:
•	
Recommendation services: A user’s profile is 
represented by a set of points in the taxono-
mies, as each user could have many interests 
and could be located at different parts of the 
organizational structure. As JITIK keeps 
track of user interests and preferences it 
is able to recommend content to users on 
demand. Recommended content may be 
used in Portals or Web applications. 
•	
Subscription services: JITIK allows users 
to subscribe to changes in specific areas. 
Also, users may customize the media and 
frequency of JITIK notifications using 
simple web-based interfaces. Rules may be 
defined so as messages relative to certain 
topics are handled with higher priorities. A 
rule may state that several alerts should be 
sent to their cell-phone via SMS, and also 
define that interest-area messages be sent in 
a weekly summary via email. Organization 
managers may set high-level distribution 
rules. 
•	
Content distribution services: Enterprise ap-
plications can deliver content to the system 
using its semantic-based content distribution 
services. When new content is received it 
is classified and distributed to those users 
who could be interested. Users receive the 
notifications of new content as specified by 
their own rules.
Conlu
on
As we can see from the set of technological trends 
we just presented for supporting information and 
knowledge distribution in organizations, there 
is at the same time the possibility of combining 
several technologies, as if they were independent 
(for instance, agent-based recommender systems 
for social networks), and also almost every single 
technology is related to the other ones; for instance, 
the delegation paradigm relates “push” modality 
to agent systems; semantic web can help agents to 
relate to each other in open markets, and so on.
It is difficult to foresee which of the advanced 
technologies we just presented will become main-
stream in the near future, but we are certain that 
many of the technological elements we reviewed 
are going to actively participate in the informa-
tion and knowledge distribution systems of the 
years to come.

they can collaborate to perform tasks in an 
organization.
Digital Repository: Set of interrelated elec-
tronic documents, stored in files or a database, 
usually classified in categories and other criteria, 
that stores knowledge useful to an enterprise or 
other organization.
Enterprise Portals: Specialized websites, 
common in big enterprises, where a logged-in user 
can access a wealth of information services.
Forums and Boards: Electronic discussion 
lists, where participants can “post” a new com-
ment, respond to a previous post, etc.
Information Filtering: Process that elimi-
nates (filters out) part of a given information, 
leaving just what is believed to be useful.
IT (Information Technologies): Set of 
technologies related to electronic information 
processing.
Knowledge Management: Discipline that 
studies the efficient use of knowledge in enter-
prises and other organizations.
Negroponte’s Delegation: A human user can 
delegate a task to a synthetic agent, meaning that 
the latter is going to carry it out on behalf of the 
former.
Ontologies: Definition of classes of objects, 
attributes, properties and relations to other objects, 
expressed in Semantic Web markup languages 
such as OWL.
Semantic Web: A set of technologies aiming 
to allow machines to reason about the content of 
internet documents.
Social Networks: The set of human relations 
in an organization, which exist independently of 
whether or not they are analyzed; as a discipline, 
social networks is the study of those interrela-
tions.
Symbolic Information: Information written 
as sequences of symbols, which is normally text, 
as opposed to images, sound, etc.
Taxonomies: Tree-like classifications.
Virtual Spaces: A simulated place in an infor-
mation system, like a working group. Some virtual 
spaces incorporate virtual reality concepts, but in 
enterprises it is not common practice
