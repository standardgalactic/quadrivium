 About the Author 
  Phil   Wicklund   is the manager of digital technology services at 
RBA, Inc.—a digital and technology consultancy. 
 His passion is leadership. It sounds simplistic, or worse, cliché, but 
his passion runs deep and no other word hits closer to the mark. He loves 
leadership because he loves casting a vision for a better future; a future of 
personal growth, betterment of the human condition, ways to create future 
value for companies, and a future of shared accomplishment with his 
teammates. Such a future is one worth fighting for, and he has never been 
afraid to take the path of maximum resistance to make a goal a reality. 
 He has lead and managed countless large-scale, enterprise projects as 
a project manager and/or technical lead. He also has experience managing 
a staff of 36+ consultants. Additionally, he’s been blessed with countless 
opportunities to interface with and advise CXO-level customers on creating 
value for their companies. 
 He has also written three technology books; teaching is second passion. He loves the feeling at the end 
of a day when he has been able to apply his expertise to help someone in need. He sincerely hopes this book 
helps a lot of people learn a tool that isn’t always the easiest to learn. 
 He is currently in his third year of doctoral studies at the University of St. Thomas. Learning, you could 
say, is his third passion. He is working to extend his studies in technology and business by deepening his 
understanding of organizational leadership, working toward a dissertation that combines the three disciplines.

 Acknowledgments 
 The first thing I want to do is thank Apress for the opportunity to write this book and taking a chance on me. 
It's truly been a pleasure working with the Apress team, most notably Susan McDermott, Rita Fernando, and 
Douglas Pundick. Their guidance and editing skills have undoubtedly made this book a very professional 
and helpful work. Thank you! 
 Next, I want to thank my technical reviewers, Mike Reynolds and Nick Wesselman. These gentlemen put 
in many hours of reading and commenting on my chapters. My thankfulness for their real-world experience 
cannot be overstated; they tirelessly annotated this book with comments, suggestions, and constructive 
criticism, without which I would have had little confidence in the integrity of the content. Thank you for 
helping to make this a trustworthy, accurate, and helpful resource for the Sitecore community. 
 Speaking of which, I need to acknowledge the Sitecore community itself. There is nothing you can’t find 
on the Internet these days. To suggest that all the content came to my mind without any outside influence 
is a ridiculous notion. I relied partly on my experience, no doubt, but also the experiences of countless folks 
across the globe through their blog posts, white papers, videos, etc., and this work is just as much theirs as 
my own. There is no room for pridefulness on my part given my reliance on so many wonderful contributors 
to such as vastness of Sitecore knowledge as can be found on the Internet. Thank you, all! 
 Another important group of contributors to this book were Laura Best, Zack Wenthe, and Sasha 
Vaynberg. These individuals contributed the “Strategy Bits” found in most of the chapters, offering 
invaluable real-world digital marketing expertise. I wanted the book to encompass not just the technical 
“how-to,” but also some of the “why,” and their points of view from a marketing perspective were invaluable. 
Thank you! 
 Lastly, I want to thank my wife Sarah for the never-ceasing support, and to my Lord Jesus, who supplied 
a richness of grace, skills, and endurance needed to complete this work. To HIM be the glory, not me 
(Romans 11:36).

 Introd uction 
 I believe this book represents the most foundational aspects of Sitecore that everyone needs to understand, 
no matter your role—whether you’re a marketer, content administrator, power user, developer, or 
administrator. This book is where you start when you need to learn Sitecore. What will you learn? For 
starters, you'll learn Sitecore “out-of-the-box,” meaning, you'll learn how to use Sitecore's core features 
and capabilities, such as content management and personalization configuration, and you’ll learn how to 
configure Sitecore's marketing analytics capabilities. 
 The book starts with the very basic, answering “what is Sitecore?” in the very first chapter, all the way to 
an appendix that breaks all stereotypes. This appendix is chock full of fairly advanced concepts for those who 
are especially ambitious. In between, you'll notice a progression of core concepts, to the more theoretical 
concepts around security best practices and governance concepts. 
 Most chapters include “Strategy Bits” as well. The goal is to balance the technical how-to with the 
more theoretical, strategy of why. This is done through the use of several contributing authors who bring a 
core marketing background into the discussion. I believe this, paired with the theoretical chapters stated 
previously and thorough how-to, makes this a robust, broad, and thoroughly helpful and practical book for a 
broad Sitecore audience. 
 The core audience this book targets includes the marketers who administer Sitecore on a daily basis, 
such as those managing content and viewing analytics reports. Developers also will benefit from some 
foundational understanding, but the book does steer away from the depths of Sitecore’s internals; those 
topics are best covered separately so to not throw a less technical audience off track. However, I don't totally 
shy away from more advanced topics. Marketing technologists, aka “Sitecore Power Users” as I call them, will 
wet their whistles throughout the book (and in the appendix especially). As such, this book has a little bit for 
everyone, while not losing the less technical marketer in the process. 
 How This Book Is Structured 
 The book is divided into nine chapters and an appendix with some advanced topics.
• 
 Chapter   1 , “Introduction to Sitecore 8,” seeks to level the playing field by providing a 
high-level overview of Sitecore’s core features and capabilities.  
• 
 Chapter   2 , “Managing Content,” one of the most foundational chapters of the book, 
helps readers understand the Content Editor and the Experience Editor; two core 
tools used throughout the book. 
• 
 Chapter   3 , “Experience Personalization,” walks the reader through personalization 
strategy and configuration techniques. 
• 
 Chapter   4 , “Experience Optimization,”" demonstrates how to configure A/B testing 
and other optimization techniques to ensure your content is best suited to your 
customer’s needs. 
xix

 ■ INTRODUCTION
xx
• 
 Chapter   5 , “Marketing Campaigns,” describes how to set up marketing automation 
and campaigns within Sitecore, no doubt a critical read for marketers seeking to get 
the most out of their installation. 
• 
 Chapter   6 , “Web Forms for Marketers,” is a fun little tool to help marketers spin up 
quick and easy forms for lead capture, etc., and this chapter walks them through 
this process. 
• 
 Chapter   7 , “Experience Analytics,” provides an overview of the out-of-the-box 
reporting built into Sitecore, as well as how to set up some self-service reporting for 
more advanced decision support. 
• 
 Chapter   8 , “Security,” is the token security chapter; you’ll learn how to set up users, 
roles, and access rights to secure your installation. 
• 
 Chapter   9 , “Governance,” seeks to enable you to maintain a happy, healthy Sitecore 
installation for years to come. 
• 
 Chapter   10 , “Appendix,” brings a host of more advanced topics, such as data 
templates, custom workflows, architecture, and the Federated Experience Manager 
for those looking to go a bit deeper.

 CHAPTER 1  
 Introduction to Sitecore 8 
 My goal for this book is to pave a yellow brick road for Sitecore end users, such as marketers and content 
administrators. There is a ton of information on the Internet about Sitecore, but its vastness often leaves you 
wondering where to begin. This book begins with an overview of Sitecore. Later chapters will dive into the 
details. For now, however, it is important to understand Sitecore’s potential more broadly so you know where 
your destination is. 
 Finding the wizard of oz begins with knowing some WCM history and, specifically, how Sitecore is helping 
to redefine what a WCM should be doing for you. We begin this discussion by considering Sitecore’s solution 
architecture. Next we will discuss all the great high-level features and capabilities of Sitecore. This exploration 
will help set the stage for what’s possible with Sitecore, or in Dorothy’s case, what’s “over the rainbow.” 
 Sitecore’s content management system is one of those key capabilities, thereby allowing non-technical 
marketers the ability to change content across all channels without the need for a developer. Sitecore’s analytics 
engine is another key capability. Analytics and data are the powerhouse behind the rich personalization and 
engagement optimization capabilities within Sitecore that marketers so often salivate over. 
 In the end, Sitecore is just one tool among a myriad of tools and systems that make up what an 
enterprise uses to run its business. Systems such as ERP systems, CRM systems, authentication systems, and 
so forth are all critical adjuncts within the enterprise that Sitecore often needs to integrate with. Some of the 
most prevalent integration points will be described at a high level later in this chapter so you can understand 
at the broadest scope what the potential for Sitecore can be. 
 Finally, this chapter will conclude by offering a brief tutorial of the graphical user interfaces (GUI) that 
end users, marketers, and administrators work in. For those who may be on a previous version of Sitecore 
and looking to upgrade (version 7.5 and earlier), the chapter will conclude with a discussion on new features 
and capabilities specifically with the eighth version of Sitecore so you can know what to look forward to 
when you upgrade. 
 Web Content Management—A Brief History 
 Sitecore, a Danish company, was founded in 2001 at the peak of  Web Content Management (WCM)  
hype. Sitecore, however, is one of the very few in the market who transformed itself as digital marketing 
waxed and waned, and here, in the “age of the customer,” Sitecore is certain to remain a horse worth 
betting on. Sitecore provides the data, in real time across all channels, needed to maximize experience 
value. Additionally, Sitecore utilizes deep analytics to drive better decisions and uncover valuable 
insights. Sitecore also integrates deeply into external business systems to help create a single picture 
of your customers. These capabilities take WCM well beyond its original definition, paving the way for 
the modern  Customer Experience Platform (CXP) , of which Sitecore is a clear leader. Sitecore exceeds 
expectations for each key priorities for a modern enterprise-class CXP solution. But what is a CXP? For 
that matter, what is WCM? 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
2
 It makes sense to dig a bit into the background of Web Content Management (WCM) solutions 
themselves and their history, and then discuss how CXP has evolved to be the new standard. This backdrop 
will set the right context before covering each capability of Sitecore, feature by feature. Let’s begin in 1995! 
 Web 2.0 
 The WCM concept was born out of the late 1990s, not long after Al Gore invented the Internet. Al, like 
other web site owners, was frustrated that he needed a developer every single time the web site needed to 
be updated. WCM, born out of this frustration, paved a way for richer, more frequent updating of web site 
content, which helped facilitate more and more Internet use. 
 This notion of end-user updatable content became the catalyst for the term “Web 2.0,” which became a 
meme for the concept of user-driven content, rich usability, and stronger web standards. In those early days, 
Web 2.0 became the high bar that WCM systems aspired to. The core capabilities of a WCM system could be 
described as the following:
 Content Management —The ability to administer content apart from the 
involvement of a developer is the most basic requirement of a WCM solution. 
This might involve updating copy on the web site, adding imagery, or rich media 
such as video content. 
 Collaboration —Administering content takes the blending of many minds. Some 
create content, some approve that content, while others may take the action to 
actually publish that content so it’s live for users to consume. This process of 
collaborating with peers involves locking content so others can’t override your 
changes, versioning content in case you need to revert to a previous version 
or test an alternate version, and even the initiation of complex publishing 
workflows to handle the various levels of approval needed before it goes live. 
 Content Visualization —Some demand that content always be separate from 
its presentation details. However, as a marketer, it sure is nice to see what the 
change will look like  before you press the publish button. A core feature of many 
WCM solutions is the ability to change content inline, within its presentation to 
get real-time feedback on what that change will look like when you press Save. 
This is often referred to as a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG, 
whi-zee-whig) editor. 
 A basic WCM is expected to have these basic capabilities, if not many, many more. However, even 
though these features were innovative at the time, today they are table stakes. Twenty years after the 
first WCM solutions started becoming popular, the demands marketers have on their digital experience 
platforms have all but transformed what a WCM needs to enable. 
 R.I.P. WCM—Long Live  CXP 
 Unfortunately for the WCM legacy, we are no longer in the digital age. Rather, we have entered the “age 
of the customer” (a phrase first coined by Forrester:   https://solutions.forrester.com/age-of-the-
customer/cio-cmo-strategy-3115Q-3763IK.html  ), where the customer is in control. Most buying decisions 
are made before the customer ever interacts with your brand. In ages past, the marketer had far more control 
to dictate the customer’s impression of the product, brand, and even the market. Nowadays customers do 
their own research and engage a web site 70% into their buying journey. As Forrester said in its seminal 
article, “ technology  has tipped the balance [of power] in the favor of the customer.”

  https://solutions.forrester.com/age-of-the-customer/cio-cmo-strategy-3115Q-3763IK.html 
 The Internet is really what has turned the tide for marketers. Customers today have infinite knowledge 
at their fingertips via the Internet. They are doing their homework, and in the age of the customer your job 
as a marketer is far more challenging. In the age of digital marketing, you were allowed to put your Facebook 
hat on and create campaigns that pushed bait into individual channels. Now however, customers cross 
channels constantly, hence the coining of the term ‘Omnichannel’. How do you understand user behavior 
when you only look into individual channels? Take note of this mind-shift, as seen in Figure  1-1 . 
 Figure 1-1.    Digital marketing is rapidly losing steam to a more  wholistic marketing concept , called experience 
marketing, which focuses on understanding the customer’s experience across all channels, versus optomizing 
each channel individually 
 Marketers however are not a dying breed. No doubt most are finding themselves on the defensive. 
However, through updated marketing strategy and the use of a properly configured customer experience 
management system (CXP), they can get back on the offensive again. The foundation of this offense is to 
anticipate the needs of the customer. This is done by delivering highly personalized content to each user 
across every channel. The user is coming to your brand with a very specific purpose in mind, and it’s your 
job to leverage the analytics at your fingertips to present to them, in real time, what it is they are looking for.

 Figure 1-2.  Sitecore’s  intuitive treelist of all content items 
 Real-time personalization can also be leveraged quite effectively in the context of campaigns. A good 
CXP uses analytics to compile a single view of the customer’s interactions across all channels. A web 
experience must drive conversions, engagement, and brand loyalty. You must deliver a quality, consistent 
experience across all touch points. This, no doubt, is functionality well beyond the scope of mere WCM 
solutions.       
 Key Priorities for a Customer Experience Platform 
 Every interaction with your brand is an experience, but do you know your customer across all these 
interactions? Is every experience one your customer wants/expects? Is every experience creating value 
for your brand? A CXP should provide the answers to these questions. In this section, you’ll find a more 
exhaustive overview of key capabilities a CXP should be bringing to the table. Later, we’ll explore Sitecore 
more specifically and how it brings these capabilities to your fingertips. 
 Easy to Use 
 This one probably goes without saying, but a CXP that is difficult to use simply won’t provide the kind 
of ROI you’re looking for. You shouldn’t be in a place where you’re constantly relying on deep technical 
skills to perform everyday administration functions, such as checking up on the results of a campaign or 
adding a new video to the home page.  Sitecore provides an intuitive treelist of all content items, such as 
what is seen in Figure  1-2 . This makes it easy to drill into the site and find the content you’re looking to 
update, for example.  
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8

 Real-Time Personalization 
 A top-tier CXP should respond to user behavior on the fly and in real time in order to change the 
presentation of the site to best align to the users’ needs and goals, with the intention of getting the most 
engagement out of the users. Personalization also is critical to driving conversions out of users, such 
as purchasing a relevant product, getting them to sign up for a webinar, or generating an action a sales 
representative could follow up on. Sitecore provides this, and much more, such as experience optimization 
and content testing, so you can know the content on your site will produce the best benefit for the users 
being targeted. Additionally, you can log user behavior to track users as different personas, which can then 
feed into who you target within your e-mail campaigns, for example. 
 
■ Key Statistic    A full 97% of B2C marketers conclude that personalization is key to achieving their long-term 
goals:   https://www.internetretailer.com/2014/08/29/theres-more-work-be-done-personalization  
 Single View of the Customer 
 Your CXP should also enable a single view of each customer’s data and insights. Instead of having customer 
data spread across three or four enterprise systems, spreadsheets, or databases, a CXP can be the point of 
truth for who your customers are, how their behaviors are changing over time, and myriad of other insights 
your marketing team can tap into. An example of this might be bi-directional synchronization between your 
CXP and CRM systems, such as what Sitecore accommodates. In any case, the recommendation in the “age 
of the customer” is to become obsessed with knowing your customer, and you can’t accomplish this if you 
need to go to four places and piece together how your customers are changing. 
 
■ Must Read   Forbes Insights article called  Customers for Life: Technology Strategies for Attracting and 
Keeping Customers :   http://sitecore.net/forbes 
 Search Engine  Optimization 
 Your CXP should not keep you from being found. Far too many developers have made excuses for far too 
many WCM solutions that come up short in this regard. Your CXP solution should have been designed 
from the ground up with SEO in mind. This includes key strategies such as URL structure, cleanliness of the 
HTML, redirection issues, ability to add keywords, and many other tips that a WCM commonly gets wrong. 
 E-Mail and  Automation 
 While in the store, 61% of consumers would prefer to receive mobile ads with discounts or sales information, 
but only 49% are actually receiving these ads, (source:   http://www.ninthdecimal.com/wp-content/
uploads/2014/09/ND_Insights_Q2_2014.pdf  ), and 81% of shoppers say they want promotional e-mails 
to highlight items that are on sale. What this means for the marketer is that traditional channels remain 
alive and well when powered by a reputable CXP such as Sitecore. Your CXP should provide you an easy 
interface to e-mail your customers by segment, and allow for out-of-the-box customer subscriptions to 
e-mail preferences. Sitecore takes this a step further by providing multivariate testing capabilities so you can 
understand which  e-mail formats are generating the most engagement. Analytics such as click-throughs and 
subsequent engagement scores can easily be tracked and optimized.

 Figure 1-3.  In today’s global economy, most marketers will require a CXP solution that accomodates 
multilingual translation of their content       
 Multilingual Support 
 A  multilingual experience   is table stakes for a CXP solution, as customers expect an experience in their 
native language. Having a CXP solution that enables language variation is a must-have. Sitecore, as seen in 
Figure  1-3 , enables users to translate each piece of content into multiple languages and thereafter you can 
use geo-location or other mechanisms to ensure the right content is in the right language for a particular 
customer. See Chapter   2 for more details on content translation features.    
 Omnichannel  Support 
 Your CXP should enable you to manage content and view analytics across all your channels (e-mail, print, 
mobile, web, etc.) in the same spot. You should never have to worry about maintaining multiple copies of 
the same content, or needing to remember two different systems to view different insights on a particular 
customer’s recent engagement activity. Figure  1-4 shows a typical customer journey, from seeing something 
of interest on social media, to finding reviews of that item with an app, to checking inventory of a local 
store, to checking out the item in person at the store, to then buying the item for less online at the cheapest 
rate and, finally, checking shipping status via a mobile phone. The point is that your customers cross these 
channel boundaries constantly, and you can’t think like a WCM user any longer. 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8

 Figure 1-4.    A customer experiences your brand from across many channels. Often a single purchase crosses 
most of them several times through a single buying journey. It is critical to understand the customer’s 
experience with your brand at every interaction 
 
■ Key Statistic   A full 78% of consumers today shop across multiple channels from online, mobile, and in the store: 
  http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/atg/cross-channel-commerce-survey-333315.pdf  
 Social Media Support 
 With customers crossing channels so frequently, it’s critical that each channel be deeply integrated with other 
channels, such as social  channels . For example, Sitecore allows you to configure Facebook, Twitter, and other 
platform users to have the ability to log into your experience and interact with your content. This might be 
posting a comment on a discussion board, or as they engage in your site they might earn wall postings noting 
their engagement, such as when they complete a goal. Or more basically, you probably want to add “Like” and 
Tweet links in your experiences to elicit greater social engagement to draw in new customers.  
 Mobile Support 
 Mobile is another given in the world of CXP solutions. This begins with creating rich, compelling front-end user 
experiences driven off a responsive design to accommodate any browser size. It extends also from a content 
perspective, where content should be easily managed for apps or other third-party systems, accessible anywhere 
in the world but managed in one place. Additionally, marketers need real-time access to key insights about their 
customer’s engagement, and the ability to make fast decisions around experience optimization—regardless of 
access to a large screen. Sitecore was built with a mobile-first mentality to provide such ease of access. 
 
■ Key Statistic   81% of consumers research the product on their mobile device before going out shopping:

 Figure 1-5.  The developer can achieve tight alignment with Sitecore, their peers, and team development 
software and source control with the help of third-party tools such as Visual Studio and Hedgehog TDS. Sitecore 
keeps everybody happy       
 Integration Flexibility 
 Deep  integration with business systems is critical for a marketer to truly understand the complete picture 
of the customer. In fact, a study concluded that 78% of respondents attributed their failed digital experience 
strategies to lack of integration and the challenges that brought. Technologies that don’t work well together 
can incur significant manual costs and project delays. It’s important to pick a CXP that has native integration 
connectors with your key systems to minimize this risk. Fortunately Sitecore, through connectors or through 
third parties, integrates seamlessly with CRM solutions, social networks, ERP systems, and e-commerce 
solutions. See the appendix for deeper architectural and integration considerations. 
 Developer Friendly 
 For rich, highly customized experiences in the Web 2.0 world,  developers   need to get involved and you don’t 
want a CXP solution that is difficult to customize or expensive to maintain. Many WCM solutions fall down 
at this juncture; they often focused exclusively on a good content management experience at the expense of 
ease of customization, or vice versa. Indeed, some WCM solutions focus solely on the developer. Some of the 
most popular WCM solutions are open source, appealing to the developer and the budget constrained, but 
never meeting the expectations that modern experience marketers place on them. Marketers  and developers 
need to engage in a healthy dialogue on what the CXP solution needs to accommodate. Sitecore carefully 
straddles this tension, offering the separation of church and state that developers desire (separate of content 
from its presentation details), and yet not sacrificing the marketers desire for control and responsiveness to 
changing customer circumstances. Figure  1-5 shows how deep developer integration can go, such as within 
standard development tools like Visual Studio.

■ Tip    Figure  1-5 demonstrates two very helpful add-ins: Sitecore Rocks and TDS from a company called 
Hedgehog. Rocks seamlessly integrates all Sitecore content and assets into Visual Studio—something devs 
love. TDS syncs all Sitecore and code changes between all developers on a team; a must-have for team 
development scenarios. 
 Enterprise Grade 
 A busy web solution may be serving content consumed at one million requests a minute. Additionally, the 
content is mission critical; perhaps it’s product information as part of an e-commerce web site. In this case 
you don’t want garage code running your mission-critical site. You need a CXP solution that is dependable 
and tested under stress and is fault tolerant. Sitecore allows for tons of architecture flexibility, from 
supporting cloud deployments, web front-end load balancing, and SQL Server availability groups to account 
for a highly available, scaled out solution. See the appendix for more details.   
 Key Features and Capabilities of Sitecore 
 Now that we have some history under our belt, as well as an understanding of what an modern CXP should 
deliver, we can better understand Sitecore’s features and capabilities. Let’s begin with a quick discussion of 
the architecture of Sitecore that enables all these helpful CXP features. 
 Sitecore Solution Architecture 
 Sitecore’s  architecture (Figure  1-6 ) is broken into five main service tiers: Channels, Management, Sitecore 
AIDA, Database, and Integration. The specific features and capabilities of Sitecore are spread throughout 
this architecture in various forms. 
 Figure 1-6.  Sitecore’s defacto solution five-tiered architecture

 Channel Layer 
 Channels are the points of engagement a customer will enter when they interact with your brand. Sitecore 
provides a host of features and capabilities that maximize engagement across the following channels. 
 Key features and capabilities of the Channel layer include:
• 
 E-mail Experience Manager 
• 
 Print Experience Manager 
• 
 Federated Experience Manager 
• 
 Social connected 
• 
 Sitecore Commerce 8 
 Those channels are described in the following sections. 
 Web 
 The  web channel is the core channel users will engage in from a browser experience. The browser/web 
channel also becomes the primary mechanism to administer Sitecore. 
 Email 
 Sitecore engages the Email  channel primarily through the Email Experience Manager module. This module 
allows marketers to create e-mail campaigns leveraging customer profile data, preferences, or segments. The 
Email Experience Manager also allows for easy tracking of customer engagement within the campaign. 
 
■ Must Watch   Best practices for e-mail marketing:   https://www.sitecore.net/learn/resources-
library/recorded-webinars/5-best-practices-email-marketing.aspx 
 Mobile  
 Sitecore accommodates a separation of content and presentation details. This makes it very easy for 
developers to create compelling mobile web experiences within Sitecore. Sitecore also accommodates 
device detection for situations when an adaptive experience is preferred.  
 Social 
 Sitecore allows for easy integration with  Social channels such as Facebook and Twitter. When you post 
content in Sitecore you can configure it to automatically post to one or many pages in Facebook. You can 
also allow users to log in to your site with their federated Facebook credentials. There is a ton of possibility 
for a marketer in this channel, from finding brand advocates, to capturing customer intelligence, and 
proactively seeking feedback and advice. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
11
 Commerce 
 Sitecore has rich  commerce capabilities to tap into your customer shopping behaviors across all your 
channels. Sitecore Commerce 8 is a new capability released in early 2015 that enables B2C and B2B 
e-commerce managed within Sitecore and a Microsoft Dynamics backend. See the appendix for more 
information on Sitecore Commerce 8 and other e-commernce solutions for Sitecore. 
 Print 
 Print is another channel that customers interface with regularly, such as brochures and print ads. Print 
Experience Manager, a feature of Sitecore, allows marketers to easily capture personalization data to create 
compelling, targeted print experiences for customers.  
 Apps 
 Mobile  apps have become a critical way customers interact with your brand, especially when considering 
e-commerce. One of the benefits of Sitecore is the ease of access to centralized content. Content for the web 
can be reused for content in an app. Additionally, you can use Sitecore’s Federated Experience Manager to 
tie in App engagement data into Sitecore to, again, create a single view of how your customer is experiencing 
your brand. 
 Federated 
 Federated channels might be channels you don’t own but still represent a view into your customer. Perhaps 
a partner web site captures valuable information about your target customers. Through the use of Federation 
Experience Manager, you can easily capture those very important, non-Sitecore managed experience’s 
data and combine it with native representations of your customer to create a truer representation of your 
customer’s engagement across all your channels (and even partners).    
 Management Layer 
 The  Management layer of Sitecore is the core of the experience platform. This is where content administers 
manage content. It is where they configure personalization rules, view engagement scores, and view reports. 
It is also what collects, evaluates, manages and analyzes customer intelligence from patters, behaviors, and 
decisions gathered across your channels. Additionally, from Sitecore you can manage all of your company’s 
digital assets, in one place used across all channels. 
 Key features and capabilities of the Management layer include:
• 
 Unified content management 
• 
 The Sitecore Launchpad 
• 
 Viewing analytics and reports 
• 
 Digital asset management 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
12
 Sitecore AIDA Layer 
 Sitecore  AIDA (Analytics, Insights, Decisions, and Automation) encompasses all the sexy features and 
capabilities that marketers salivate over. Therein is the power to do advanced content testing, such as 
A/B testing. You can also configure customer engagement goals, triggers, and reports to show progress and 
campaign outcome attainment. At its core, AIDA provides a rich suite of reporting and analytic capabilities 
so your marketing team can discover new insights and customer behavior patterns. See Chapters   3 ,   4 ,   5 , and 
especially   7  for more information about AIDA. 
 Key features and capabilities of the Sitecore AIDA layer include:
• 
 Experience profiles 
• 
 Analytics 
• 
 Personalization 
• 
 Experience optimization 
• 
 Experience Automation 
 Sitecore Database Layer 
 The  Database  layer is the heart of Sitecore. Data is the lifeblood of your experience marketing solutions. 
Without it, it’s impossible to deliver a highly relevant, personalized, channel optimized customer experience. 
Sitecore’s xDB architecture leverages MongoDB for massive data capture and retention capabilities. This 
allows high-volume, high-velocity data to be captured and become actionable in real time. See Chapter   7 
and the appendix for more details on xDB. 
 Key features and capabilities of the Database layer include:
• 
 xDB (MongoDB) 
• 
 Scalability 
• 
 High availability 
 Integration Layer 
 The  Integration layer provides connectivity into backend systems such as your CRM or ERP systems. Tying 
these systems together forms the basis for a single view of your customer, as well as provides the data you 
need for more complex personalization rules (such as past purchases). 
 Key features and capabilities of the Integration layer include:
• 
 CRM connectors 
• 
 ERP connectors 
• 
 Sitecore Commerce 8 and Sitecore Commerce Connect for 3rd party commerce 
solution integration scenarios 
• 
 SharePoint connectors 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8

 Unified Content Management 
 Managing content is a core capability of Sitecore. Content might be paragraphs of copy, web page titles, news 
articles, product information, digital assets such as imagery, or rich content such as video, and infinitely 
more. By “unified” we mean that the content is centrally managed. It doesn’t matter if the content is served 
on a web page, mobile app, e-mail campaign, or shared across five web sites—you manage it all in Sitecore, 
in one spot. In this way, Sitecore can become your single source of truth for all customer experience content. 
 There are three main ways to  manage content in Sitecore:
• 
 Through the content tree 
• 
 Through the Experience Editor 
• 
 Programmatically 
 Web content  is probably the channel most commonly used for content delivery. Therefore, managing 
web content is the primary focus of this book. The third option best serves your needs if you are trying to 
automate content changes, or perhaps you’re trying to integrate legacy systems with your new Sitecore 
system. Regardless, that is an advanced topic and won’t be discussed much in this book. Rather, end users 
and marketers will most commonly use the Experience Editor for content editing, and to a lesser extent, the 
content tree. 
 The  Experience Editor within Sitecore allows users to administer content within a WYSIWIG editor 
(what-you-see-is-what-you-get). This can be very helpful, because in the content tree you are often left 
guessing what it will look like when you click Publish (or better yet, Preview), leaving you to click the 
Publish button dozens of times before getting it right. With the Experience Editor you can see those changes 
immediately. See Figure  1-7 for an example. In this case the user is updating the hero image header text to 
“I know exactly where this will go” by simply selecting the text and typing the new message.   

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
14
 Figure 1-7.    In this figure you can see how users might go about updating the content on a page. They simply 
select the content placeholder that they want to update and start typing! Very easy 
 The  content tree  works a bit differently. In the content tree you manage content totally independently 
from its presentation. A content item is just a piece of content in this case; it could be used anywhere. 
Perhaps the content is a body of text that represents a product description. Perhaps it is content for a drop-down 
menu. It’s up to your information architecture to help you understand what it is you’re editing. 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
15
 Figure 1-8.  You can use the content tree to update content. Simply expand nodes until you find the content 
you’re looking for and thereafter edit the fields and click Save! 
 
■ Tip    Thoughtful, custom icons on your content items in the content tree will help take the guess work out of 
the equation when marketers are trying to figure out where they need to go to edit their content. 
 As you can see in Figure  1-8 , the  content tree looks very different. In this case we’re making the exact 
same update as we did in the Experience Editor. This time we dug around in the content tree to find the 
specific piece of content we wanted to update. In this case we found our hero image header text within the 
Carousel items item bucket. Therein we see the property we can update to change the content.  
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
16
 Figure 1-9.  Your first glimpse into the  content tree where content gets managed within Sitecore 
 
PRACTICAL TIPS: USE A GLOBAL DATA FOLDER UNDER CONTENT TO 
CENTRALIZE SHARED CONTENT
 
 This is great for inline content administration. However, as you read, you can centrally manage content 
in one place for many channels or many web sites. Notice in Figure  1-9 how we have a Global folder in 
the content tree under the Content root folder. Within Global (not created out-of-the-box, but it’s a best 
practice to create it), you can store all your content that you know is reusable. Then, in other content 
folders, you can add your content specific to that channel. 
 While this serves as a basic overview of content management within Sitecore, know that you can go 
miles deep with other possibilities here. For example, you may want to configure multilingual content 
variations to support multiple languages. You likely will want to configure publishing, workflows, and 
security to help instill some governance on content updates. And you will also want to work with page 
layouts and templates. All of these examples and more are covered in depth in Chapter   2  . 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
17
 Figure 1-10.    With  A/B testing , you can try out different versions of the content to see which generates the 
highest customer engagement value 
 Analytics and Experience Optimization 
 At the heart of Sitecore’s  analytics engine is xDB. xDB is a data processing engine built on top of a technology 
called MongoDB, an open source NoSQL solution that allows for massive data collection at scale. This is 
what makes possible the data collection of every single interaction of every single customer engaging in your 
cross channel experiences. 
 The best part of all this data is the power the information puts in your hands to optimize the site. 
 Experience optimization is a term used to describe the process whereby you can view experience usage 
analytics data and tweak your channels to optimize them to work for effectively for your customers, achieve 
your campaign goals, and so forth. 
 One of the ways to do this is to leverage Sitecore’s A/B testing capabilities. A/B testing allows the 
marketer to test one or more variations of some content and compare the customer engagement scores 
between each to ensure that the most effective variation becomes the long-term solution. You can test 
individual page components, entire sites, or even the entire experience across all channels. Notice in 
Figure  1-10 how a marketer can test the performance of an individual component between two variations. 
 These tests can allow you to easily see what is working well on your site and what is not working so well. 
This enables you to refine, and hopefully improve, engagement scores across all your channels. 
 The value in question is known as  engagement value . Engagement value is a numeric score that you 
set on actions a customer could take. For example, if someone signs up for your newsletter, perhaps that 
receives a score of 5. If someone downloads a whitepaper maybe that would be a 3. Each page on your site 
has likely several possible actions a user can take, from which you can assign these values. Out-of-the-box 
reporting in Sitecore allows for a quick understanding of how your  engagement value is trending, as you can 
see in Figure  1-11 . 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
18
 Engagement values can roll up into goals, such as goals you may have for a marketing campaign. There 
are many great campaign reports to show how well these goals are being realized. Outcomes are another 
possibility a marketer can manage within Sitecore. Outcomes are channel agnostic goals, such as a lead 
converting into a customer. Goals and outcomes are great examples of topics you’ll find in Chapter   5 . 
 Experience Automation 
 Experience automation  takes experience optimization a step further. In addition to collecting engagement 
value, you can also set triggers on actions to automate marketing activity. For example, if a customer 
downloads a whitepaper and also has an engagement value above a certain threshold, you may want 
to trigger a qualified lead creation within your CRM. Or, if a customer browses a few products but never 
purchases them, you may want to send a personalized e-mail with a discount code they could apply to assist 
the conversion. This is a great way to keep you sales pipeline full of quality leads without needing to troll 
through contact lists or send blind e-mail blasts out that rarely drive click-throughs. See Chapter   5 for more 
details on how to leverage automation in your marketing campaigns.  
 Figure 1-11.  Sitecore offers up many out-of-the-box analytics reports featuring, among other things, 
engagement value

STRATEGY BITS: MORE MARKETERS ARE TURNING TO 
MARKETING AUTOMATION
 
 As a marketing strategist I’m always looking at reports and surveys to help me understand what 
marketing departments are up to, but recently one survey’s results surprised me a little. Software Advice 
released their  Marketing Automation BuyerView (  http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/buyerview/
marketing-automation-2014/ ) and one stat that really jumped out is that out of the prospective 
of Marketing Automation buyers, 21% currently had no dedicated solution to manage marketing 
campaigns, instead relying on spreadsheets, paper/pens, and one-off e-mails. 
 I understand that a lot of people have shied away from marketing automation out of fear that the 
solution is hard to use or implement, but relying on just a CRM solution or standalone e-mail solution is 
leaving a lot of opportunity on the table. 
 But I was encouraged as I kept reading, because it turns out that marketers are starting to prioritize lead 
nurturing and conversion-based marketing. 81% of respondents reported that lead nurturing was a key 
priority in buying a marketing automation solution, with reporting and analytics coming right behind at 70%. 
 Marketing departments have been looking for years at ways to better measure and report on their 
efforts and deliver better lead-management processes targeted to the prospects. Now they are turning 
to marketing automation solutions to help fill some of those gaps. 91% of the respondents were looking 
at a marketing automation solution for the first time, giving an indication that marketers are getting 
confident in their ability to put a marketing automation solution in place and take advantage of it. 
 When Software Advice was asked what they thought the struggles for first time buyers would be they 
said, “Probably the biggest struggle is understanding how to use the system to its fullest. Various 
reports have come out showing that while many companies know they need lead nurturing and 
lead scoring capabilities, they have difficulty making full use of the functionality because it is more 
complicated than it seems on the surface. For instance, e-mail branching logic, as a concept, is not that 
difficult to grasp. But deciding what to do after a buyer opens a lead nurturing e-mail (or doesn’t) and 
understanding what content to deliver to keep that buyer moving through the sales cycle is much more 
complicated. As a result, first-time marketing automation buyers can sometimes become overwhelmed 
once they get into their new system. To counteract this, I’d recommend thoroughly researching exactly 
what you need from a marketing automation system before you buy. Once you understand your needs, 
start preparing for how you’ll use the system well in advance of making a purchase.” 
 I have to say that I completely agree with this conclusion, but I would also add that bringing in a strong 
partner who has experience in marketing automation and also understands the bigger marketing 
department picture and operation will determine how successful you can be. Sure, from a technical 
standpoint many partners can install and implement a marketing automation solution for you, but that 
doesn’t mean they understand how a marketing department operates, or how to build campaigns that 
work. They won’t be able to help you identify your processes, creating campaigns that match your 
business objectives and take advantage of the marketing automation system at the same time. 
 So if you’re looking at marketing automation solutions, or just trying to figure out what the best route 
might be, start small and work fast. Get your plan and objectives on paper, hold a strategy session to 
brainstorm all the things you would like to happen, and engage a partner early so they can help provide 
support throughout the process.

 Experience Profiles 
 Experience profiles (Figure  1-12 ) are one of the most exciting features of Sitecore. A marketer can see a complete 
picture of that customer’s experience with their brand, across all channels, from within that customer’s 
experience platform. The massive data collection via xDB is what makes this possible. 
 Figure 1-12.  An experience profile becomes the single view of how the customer has been engaging with your 
digital experiences 
 This information allows for many compelling possibilities, from simply a greater understanding of your 
customers, to enabling personalized experiences (as described in the next section), and to help drive higher 
conversions. Additionally, with Sitecore’s ability to integrate with your Customer Relationship Management 
(CRM) system, experience data within a customer’s profile can easily be synchronized to CRM, making it 
easy for sales associates to take action on leads being generated out of Sitecore.

 Figure 1-13.    You can configure rules on content to personalize the content. This might be to show/hide 
content, or to dynamical choose the content source based on customer demographics 
 One of the most compelling aspects of Sitecore’s experience profile capabilities is the automated 
customer segmentation that can take place. The profiling tab on a customer’s profile highlights what type of 
customer Sitecore thinks the customer is based on trending experience behaviors or rules. This profile data 
can feed into CRM, as well as drive personalized experiences within Sitecore. 
 Experience Personalization 
 As mentioned earlier, a customer’s experience profile enables a marketer to know what type of customer 
they are. This again is driven from experience behaviors, such as page navigation history, click-through 
details from marketing campaigns, or other rules you can configure. Personalization is the most powerful 
tool a marketer can employ within their Sitecore experiences to create value for their business. 
 There are two main ways to enable  personalization   within Sitecore: 1) through a rules-based 
configuration, and 2) based on user behavior. The rules system is very straight forward. Presentation rules can 
be applied to any piece of content. For example, you may want to show/hide a piece of content based on what 
persona the user is. Or you may want to show different news articles based on what country the user is coming 
from (geographic targeting). There are innumerable examples that could be provided here. Suffice it to say, 
there is a robust Rules Editor (Figure  1-13 ) that accommodates any amount of personalization customization 
you could ever dream up. Additionally, developers can build custom rules, making the possibilities limitless.  
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
22
 Behavioral targeting is another great way to personalize content. Instead of fixed rules, Sitecore is 
smart enough to assign a persona to a customer dynamically based on that customer’s interaction with 
your experiences. This is especially helpful for anonymous users who haven’t logged in yet, since you really 
don’t know anything about them at that point. As the customer engages with the experience, Sitecore learns 
with each click how the experience may need to be personalized based on their behavior. This makes the 
most obvious sense in an e-commerce setting, where you may feature products or sales based on browsing 
history. See more in Chapter   3 on how to leverage these powerful capabilities.   
 Federated Experience Manager 
 Sitecore’s  federated experience manager (FEM) has been heralded as a game changer in the CXP world. 
FEM enables a marketer to see customer behavioral data and share Sitecore content across all their 
experience properties regardless if they are on the Sitecore platform. This enables you to maintain a single 
view of the customer and a single source of content no matter if you’ve upgraded/migrated all your digital 
properties to Sitecore, or if you plan to take a more gradual approach to your migration. Examples might be 
Sitecore sites, non-Sitecore sites, or native mobile apps. 
 Additionally, FEM enables better collaboration with partners. You and your partners may want to 
collaborate on customer data. You can ask your partners to deploy the necessary page scripts on their 
properties to send a feed of customer data back to your xDB instance to create a consolidated view. Here are 
a few more examples where FEM can create value for your marketers:
• 
 A company hosts sites that cannot be managed by Sitecore (e.g. non-.NET sites or 
apps, such as WordPress or PHP sites) 
• 
 A company wants to better collaborate with their partners 
• 
 A company is in the process of migrating their properties; however, they don’t want 
to wait until they are all migrated before taking advantage of xDB’s capabilities  
• 
 You may be in acquisition mode and need to take control of new properties and 
quickly integrate them into your overall marketing objectives    
 See the appendix for more details on FEM. 
 Email Experience Manager 
 Sitecore’s  Email Experience Manager (EXM) enables greater marketing automation across web, mobile, and 
e-mail channels. Additionally, EXM can be a great lead trigger in your CRM as customers engage with your 
mail campaigns. EXM allows the marketer to send three types of mail messages:
• 
 One-time message —This is for one-time blasts to your customers. Blasts can have 
rules associated with them, in case you want to target a specific segment, for example.  
• 
 Subscription message —EXM allows for customers to subscribe to blasts, such as a 
newsletter. Anyone subscribed will receive the mail. 
• 
 Triggered message —A triggered message is a great automation technique to capture 
customer behavior on your properties and drive greater conversion. 
 xDB captures click-through rates and subsequent engagement value and realization of campaign 
goals. For example, you may create a campaign with various goals associated with it, likely across multiple 
channels. When you send a message from EXM you can associate it to a campaign. As xDB captures 
experiences, that data can pull engagement values to show the effectiveness of the message itself as well as 
the campaign. Figure  1-14 shows a sample report that EXM provides.  

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
23
 Figure 1-14.    Email Experience Manager (EXM) provides rich reporting to allow the marketer to gauge the 
results of the message and engagement value derived, which also feed into the campaign’s result       
 
■ Note   EXM also supports multivariate testing, which allows you to try different versions of your messages 
to best understand which versions drive the most engagement values. 
 Print Experience Manager 
 Print experiences remain a critical component of a marketer’s arsenal. During sales presentations, 
expos, conferences, and in displays, sometimes print remains the best channel to create a customer and 
communicate your brand’s value. However, all the aforementioned expectations customers have in the “age 
of the customer” haven’t changed. Customers still expect you to anticipate their needs. They expect highly 
relevant, personalized experiences, even with print.  Print Experience Manager (PXM) takes the capabilities 
we’ve already discussed and delivers them onto a print experience. 
 PXM utilizes the same personalization rules, customer experience profiles, and content managed in 
Sitecore to dynamically create print content your customers need. Use PXM to generate print media in real 
time, such as when they click to download a brochure. Instead of a canned, “catch-all” brochure, download 
requests can generate a brochure that’s best suited for that customer. This enables marketers to focus their time 
on interpreting experience insights, versus hours and hours spent generating 20 copies of the same collateral.   
 Quick Tour of the Sitecore Admin GUI 
 The goal of this section is to give you a high-level sense of how to maneuver within the Admin screens. The 
rest of the book will spell out the details. For starters, every Sitecore site is administered from beneath the 
 /sitecore path in the site’s root, such as  http://mysite/sitecore . When you first navigate to this path 
you’ll land on the Sitecore Launchpad (Figure  1-15 ). You can navigate to all of the Sitecore  administrative 
user interfaces from this  Launchpad view . 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
24
 Figure 1-15.    The Sitecore 8 Launchpad offers an alternative to the windowed experience of the desktop view, 
featuring a couple of high-level analytic reports 
 Alternatively, some prefer the more  traditional desktop view   (Figure  1-16 ). If you click the Sitecore icon 
on the lower left, you’ll see a launch panel appear similar to what you’d expect from a Windows 7 or earlier 
operating system. Each of the screens loads in a “window” within the browser similar to a Windows desktop 
experience. Alternatively, some prefer the Sitecore Launchpad (Figure  1-15 ) for their default view. 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
25
 Figure 1-16.    This is the view of the Sitecore Desktop, a launching point into Sitecore’s settings and 
administration 
 Figure 1-17.  From time to time, you may need to switch between the  master and web databases         
 The benefit of the Launchpad is that you can configure default reports to load on the page for a quick 
view into how your site is performing, and it is also a bit more tablet friendly. What’s more helpful is the 
avoidance of the windows; each component is loaded full-screen, leaving you to click the grid icon in the 
upper right to get back to the Launchpad. In the end it is just a matter of preference. 
 A key point on the desktop view to take note of is the database selector on the lower right of the screen 
(Figure  1-17 ). When you administer content or other settings you want to be doing that in the  master 
database. When you’re ready to publish your changes, you publish to the  web database. Sitecore settings are 
stored in the  core database. 
 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
26
 By default, the Launchpad and content editors are pointing to the  master  database, which where 
all content administration should take place. However, there are times where your  master database and 
your  web databases may be out of sync, such as before a large site update. In these cases, you may want 
to toggle the database to the web to confirm how things are set up in production. Note, however, that 
you should avoid editing content in the  web database or that content will likely be overwritten during 
the next publish.  
 
■ Note    You never want to make changes in the  web database. The  web database should be for published 
content only. Changes in the  web database run the risk of being overwritten when  master  database changes 
are published.  
 Another administrative interface that is extremely helpful is the  Sitecore Instance Manager (SIM)     , 
as seen in Figure  1-18 . SIM is available for download in the Sitecore Marketplace (found at 
  http://bit.ly/1LIf5iZ ), a place where community members can share freely downloadable modules 
for Sitecore. SIM is a small little GUI that helps you quickly track and administer your instances, and 
it is especially helpful for developers who may have many instances of Sitecore on their development 
workstations. Some of the key features of Instance Manager are:
• 
 Export and import  entire Sitecore instances (a great way to promote an install when 
you don’t have access to SQL Management Studio to restore SQL backups)  
• 
  Quick links into IIS (resetting application pools, hot link into the  inetpub  folder, etc.)  
• 
 Quick links into the instance’s Launchpad items 
• 
 Quick links to key configuration files 
• 
 Key administrative function (backup, export/import, publish, etc.) 
• 
 Download and easily install modules/add-ins 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO SITECORE 8
27
 Figure 1-18.  The Sitecore Instance Manager is a great administrator tool for keeping track of Sitecore 
instances, providing quick links into configurations, and many other great efficiences       
 
■ Tip    There are many fabulous modules in the marketplace. Check them out at

 What’s New in Sitecore 8? 
 There were many new enhancements made in the eighth version of Sitecore that make it stand out from 
previous versions. The most innovative feature that is widely acknowledged is the new Federated Experience 
Manager capabilities discussed earlier. These capabilities are really a game changer for marketers; namely, 
the ability to bring the power of Sitecore to all their properties, whether they are on Sitecore or not. 
 Other  notable enhancements in version 8 include native integration with the Experience Explorer, a 
very popular feature for marketers who want to “explore” the experience of various personas to see if they are 
getting the expected experience. Marketers also get a nice bag of tricks with version 8, including more robust 
segmentation capabilities and the ability to target content with a persona. A key feature from an analytics 
perspective is the Path Analyzer report, showing entry points and the most comment destinations users take 
after landing on a page. See Table  1-1 .

 Summary 
 At this point it wouldn’t be surprising if you found yourself a bit lost in this wide world of Oz. The 
munchkins told Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road, and I know that as you proceed through the rest 
of this book you’ll find your way through this massive, beautiful, and yet sometimes scary world we know 
better as Sitecore. 
 You’ve already seen how Sitecore is helping redefine a marketer’s expectations on a Web Content 
Management Solution (WCM). In fact, Sitecore is helping to create an entirely new category of Customer 
Experience Management Solutions (CXP). This is predicated on the emergence of the “age of the 
customer,” where customers expect more from digital experiences, such as highly personalized, relevant, 
targeted content. 
 Fortunately, Sitecore meets the needs of the marketer, and then some. With popular features such 
as personalization, goals and campaign management, and rich analytics and reporting, marketers have 
all the power they need to take their digital experiences to the next level. The beginnings of this journey 
include managing content, which is where the yellow brick road takes us in Chapter   2 .

 CHAPTER 2  
 Managing Content 
 This is probably the most important chapter you will read in this book, because it contains the most 
foundational concepts that all other chapters build upon. All future topics branch out from their roots in this 
chapter. The goal of this chapter is to lead you through the features, capabilities, and configuration options 
found within Sitecore’s content and experience  editors . 
 Before diving right in, however, the chapter begins by reviewing the Sitecore hierarchy. Understanding 
the difference between data templates, content items, and layouts represents the most foundational 
knowledge a Sitecore user is can have. Surprisingly, it’s not as straight forward as one might think to pick up 
on, so an entire section is dedicated to ensuring you understand this more theoretical concepts. 
 Beyond this is a section geared toward helping you learn the  fundamentals   of content management 
in Sitecore. This includes managing rich media, working in the Experience Editor, and managing multiple 
language translation, among other important topics. 
 It should be noted early on that this book leverages Launch Sitecore (Figure  2-1 ) as a foundation for all 
examples and images. Launch Sitecore is a freely downloadable Sitecore package. The package contains a 
full functionality demo site that leverages all of Sitecore’s key features and capabilities. Additionally, Launch 
Sitecore comes with the source code, making it easy for developers to learn the internals of the solution and 
key customization techniques. You actually don’t even need to download and install Launch Sitecore. Even 
without downloading, you can navigate to   http://www.launchsitecore.net/ and play around within the 
site, testing personalization and viewing your assumed persona. However, I recommend you ask an admin 
to install Launch Sitecore on a sandbox environment somewhere where you can be granted administrator 
access. It’s a fabulous learning tool, and that would make it easier to follow along in this book. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT

 The Sitecore  Hierarchy 
 The first step a Sitecore user needs to understand is the tree view you see in the Content Editor. Figure  2-2 
shows the default view of the content editor when you first open it, featuring the tree view off to the left. The 
three most important nodes in the tree to familiarize yourself with are Templates, Content, and Layouts. 
There are others, and they will be covered later. For now, it is important to not move on beyond this section 
until you fully understand the concepts of these three nodes, as all else depends on them. 
 Figure 2-1.  The  Launch Sitecore site is free to download and a great tool for learning Sitecore. You can 
download it by registering at   http://www.launchsitecore.net/  
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
33
 
■ Note  Most marketers will only see “Content” and “Media Library” in the tree when they log in. The other 
areas, such as “Templates” and “Layouts,” are managed typically exclusively by developers and administrators. 
However, to provide a more holistic overview of Sitecore, these concepts are introduced in this section. 
 Many marketers and content editors may prefer skipping to the next section, “Content Editing Fundamentals,” 
to get straight to the point. Power users are advised to continue reading this section. 
 Figure 2-2.  This is the  default view of the content editor, featuring a tree of items on the left and an item’s 
details on the right, with the ribbon across the top 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
34
 Templates 
 Templates are defined within the Templates node in the tree view. Templates, also commonly referred to as 
“data templates,” are the foundation of your Sitecore deployment. Every piece of content in Sitecore needs a 
data template to define what it is. For example, you might want a carousel featured on your home page 
that rotates featured news stories. The first step to set this up is to create a new data template for this 
component/functionality. You may choose to name your data template “Carousel Item” and give it a few 
fields you would expect to see in a carousel, such as a title, a caption, and an image. 
 
■ Note  Many people are confused by the term “template” because they expect a visual thing, which, 
in Sitecore, is more akin to a “layout”. Templates are just definitions of metadata around some type of object. 
 Figure  2-3  shows where within the Templates node that data template is defined (more on location 
best practices later). Note also in Figure  2-3 the data template’s fields defining the template. Again, the data 
template does  not  store any data. It is simply a template you use when you create content. 
 Figure 2-3.  Data templates define what  metadata and settings get applied to content items 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
35
 
■ Note  See the appendix for more details on creating and managing data templates. Since most marketers 
and power users will not be responsible for these settings, they are not covered in this chapter. However, proper 
data template setup is one of the most foundational elements of a good Sitecore deployment, so they are 
covered in more detail in the appendix for those who want to take their understanding to the next level. 
 Content 
 Content is administered below the Content node in the tree view. Sitecore end users and marketers will 
commonly spend the majority of their administration time below this node in the tree view. Administrators 
commonly restrict them via security settings to just this node, in addition to the Media Library node, where 
they can upload imagery, video, and other digital assets. 
 Content in the  Content node is just an instance of a data template. When you create a new content 
item you must select which data template you will use as the basis for what that content will be. Figure  2-4 
shows a user inserting a new carousel item to be used on the home page’s image rotator. In this case the 
administrator created a item called “Carousel Items” and limited that item’s children to only allow items 
using the Carousel Item data template to be created below that node (more on the Saved Search and Insert 
from Template options later). 
 Figure 2-4.  You can insert child items below nodes in the tree view. In this case we’re inserting a carousel item 
below the Carousel folder

STRATEGY BITS: HOW TO HARNESS THE POWER OF CONTENT
 
 Our world is driven by design. We now design features, structures, and repositories; we spend hours 
pouring over user research and technical requirements. But one area still so often lies forgotten—the 
area of content. 
 Content has equally been described as “whatever you fill your CMS boxes with” and “everything”. 
Essentially, content is what you use to convey your thoughts and persuade others to feel and take 
action. “Content” can be words, pictures, icons, video, tables, and calculators—it truly is the meat of 
your experience and it’s becoming the most “in demand” area to get right. 
 Unbelievably, 5 exabytes of data were created between the birth of the written word and 2003. In 
2013, 5 exabytes of data were created  every day (reference   http://aci.info/2014/07/12/the-
data-explosion-in-2014-minute-by-minute-infographic/ ). So, how do you keep ahead with this 
insatiable demand for content when you’re the one having to plan or execute a digital project for your 
team or business? 
 For many years,  platform-first approaches meant that content is often an afterthought (“here’s your box, 
now please fill it with something, oh, and you only have a few days to figure it out”; sound familiar?). 
Just as importantly, once the haze of the launch party is over, you need a way to ensure that the 
experience you’ve spent months creating continues to generate results in the long term. 
 This is where the discipline of content  strategy comes in. In simple terms, content strategy helps you 
plan the best way to engage and connect with people, so that you achieve your goals and theirs. Good 
content strategy also helps defines decisions, processes, and tools around how organizations plan, 
create, and manage content. 
 Four focus points can help establish even the most straightforward of strategies. 
 The “Why” 
 This is often the most neglected step but is also the most important. If you don’t have goals clearly 
defined for your  experience (whether a web site, app, intranet, and so on), this is your chance to shine. 
Think of your goals as your anchor in a storm. They will help you center your team in the months that 
follow with a clear vision as to what you want to accomplish. Ask these questions:
• 
 What do we need to accomplish with this experience? (This can be a combination of 
soft goals, such as changed perceptions, and hard goals, such as $$ in sales.) 
• 
 What does success look like for this  experience ? 
• 
 What does failure look like for this experience? 
• 
 How will we measure it? (Which tools and process will we use to measure and 
communicate results, and who will be accountable for it?)  
 The “Who” 
 Unless you’re really going for a cookie cutter experience, you need to be clear on “who” you’re trying 
to reach. In other words, who is your audience? Instead of thinking about all of the content you want to 
write, think more about what your users will respond to. What will resonate with them? How can you help 
them succeed? What do you want to avoid? This activity can be executed in many ways—on a basic 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
37
level, you can document your internal team’s assumptions, then test them after launch. Or you can invest 
in user research to gain a first-person view of who your audience is and what they expect from you. 
 The “What” 
 This is where the substance of your content comes into play and is often the most challenging aspect to 
content strategy. But you don’t have to start with a blank sheet of paper (or template) if you follow the 
right steps. 
 Step 1: Be a Visionary 
 First, create a vision for what you want your content to achieve. Some people do this with a content vision 
(ref: “Content Strategy for the Web” by Kristina Halvorson, Melissa Rach   http://contentstrategy.com/ ); 
others write a brief document or “manifesto” that outlines the mandatories for what they hope content 
will drive for their experience. 
 Whatever you do, make sure you have buy-in on this vision from senior level decision makers in your 
organization (preferably you’ll have worked with them to write it). You’ll need this agreement when 
decisions need to be made down the line. 
 Your vision should be flexible enough to evolve with your knowledge and changing business needs, 
aspirational and motivational to help lift your content efforts, and practical enough to deliver what your 
organization and business needs. 
 Step 2: Know Where You Are Today 
 Digital experiences are rarely created on a whim. Many larger projects need to unravel years of content, 
technology, and features to get to a new state. Sometimes things are deemed so “broken” that they 
simply need to be blown up and recreated. 
 But sometimes, knowing what you have in front of you can be a good first step to creating something 
new. A content inventory can help with this—an inventory is a catalog of the content that exists within 
your experience today. Typically executed within a spreadsheet format, it includes information such as 
the reference for the content (e.g. home page banner), the actual content itself, the content source 
(a person, a vendor, or data), the content owner, and other pertinent information. 
 Step 3: Be Honest About Your Gaps 
 The beauty of the creative process is that you’re creating something new. However, you may have 
existing content you already know you want to use in that experience—perhaps content you know has 
worked well before or organizational “must-haves”. 
 One way to get a sense for how much content you will need is to conduct an audit. An audit can take 
many forms, but two favorites are often:
• 
 An  opportunity analysis —This audit helps you understand how close your current 
content is to your vision and your user needs and generally reveals broad areas of 
opportunity within your intended experience. For example, your content vision could 
say that you want your customers to connect together to share ideas, but your existing 
web site may simply be online brochure-ware that promotes products. An opportunity 
analysis will highlight gaps in content and features that you’ll need to address. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
38
• 
 A “nuts and bolts”  audit —If you’re considering keeping and transferring content from 
an old experience into a new one, this more qualitative approach can be very helpful 
in determining what you might need to update to create consistency or accuracy. In 
this audit, you’re reviewing aspects such as content accuracy (e.g. correct spelling and 
grammar), use of best practices in experience design, whether you have broken links, etc.  
 Within your audit, be sure to note what content you may want to keep, what content you want to forget, 
and what content you need to create. 
 Step 4: Become a Content Wrangler 
 When a new digital experience is being created, it suddenly seems that everyone is an expert on what 
topics to write about! This can become challenging to manage if you’re in an organization bigger than, 
say, the number of fingers on your left hand, 
 A helpful way to think about content is to create content themes, which are based on your content 
vision, and also any brand pillars your organization may have. 
 This means creating a prioritized list of what matters to your organization. Then doing the same with 
what matters to your audience. You bring those together and create a common set of “content themes”. 
Let’s just say you work for an architectural firm that is passionate about sustainability. Start with 
sustainability as a content theme. Define it. And use that definition to help guide editorial conversations 
you have with your team—a top-down approach rather than bottom up. 
 Once you have your content themes in place, you’ll find it’s easier to create posts yourself or organize 
larger teams of content creators. 
 The “How” 
 The “how,” often also called  governance , is the key to sustaining an effective content strategy. Find 
my strategy bit in Chapter   9 for the all-important conclusion to harnessing the power of your content 
strategy.

 Layouts and Components 
 Layouts are the third leg in our journey. We have content created from a template, but what does it actually 
look like? Layouts tell Sitecore  where to render the component, and components tell Sitecore  how the data 
template and the content instance should be rendered. A layout contains one or more content placeholders 
marketers can add/remove components into. A component has a controller (a web control if you’re using 
Web Forms; see the sidebar entitled “What Is a Component?”) that renders the component on the page. 
 Should the title of the Carousel item be Heading 1 and Red or Heading 3 and Black? Should the image 
be to the left of the title, or as a background? This is the responsibility of the component’s controller and 
view, and for better or worse, this is where you will rely on a developer. For better, because you and your 
developer team will appreciate the near infinite control to meet the needs of your requirements, but for 
worse because as a marketer your control is limited to how much control the developers build into the 
system to empower you to make these formatting changes (more on this later). 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
39
 However, marketers can control where on the page components are dropped by adding components 
into placeholders. Placeholders then can be configured to only allow certain components to help enforce a 
standard information architecture. Additionally, developers should be adding configuration properties onto 
components to make component settings editable by marketers. As a best practice, developers should consider 
making settings editable by marketers to make the solution as maintainable by as many people as possible. 
 As an example, notice the Presentation Layout Details dialog box on the home page (Figure  2-5 ). In this 
case, a Carousel component was added to the components collection for the default device (mobile devices 
use the default in this case since there are no settings for mobile specifically). The default device is set to use 
a layout called “Main” that controls the positioning of the components on the page via placeholders. 
A developer builds, deploys, and maintains each layout, such as Main in this case, according to the marketer’s 
specifications. But the marketer can choose where within Main the carousel should be rendered. 
 Figure 2-5.  An item’s Presentation Layout Details, PLD, is where you can configure the settings Sitecore uses to 
know how to render an item 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
40
 
WHAT IS A COMPONENT?
 
 A developer can build a  component via Web Forms (legacy) or via MVC (Model-View-Controller) design 
patterns. Alternatively you can download/buy components from the marketplace (  http://marketplace.
sitecore.net ) or from third parties. 
 MVC is the best practice when developing your own, in which case the component’s view is deployed 
into the Renderings folder within the Layout node. The view/rendering has a property that specifies the 
controller used to execute and render the component. In Figure  2-6 , you see the Controller property that 
specifies the namespace and class name that renders the component. The Controller Action property 
specifies which MVC controller action (method) that is called specifically for this component (view). 
 Figure 2-6.  Developers can use MVC to build renderings 
 The scope of this book doesn’t go deep into Sitecore development and how to build MVC-based Sitecore 
components. Suffice it to say, components live in the Layout ➤ Renderings node and generate the 
HTML needed to render the content instance based on a data template. Components can be added to 
pages by marketers within the page’s Layout’s placeholders. 
 Content  Editing Fundamentals  
 With your data templates established, you can finally begin entering some content! As you would expect, 
content is managed from the Content node within the content editor tree view. More commonly, marketers 
tend to favor editing content in the Experience Editor, because they see visually how the content will look 
real-time while editing the content. The Experience Editor is covered later in this chapter, but with the 
Content Editor being most foundational, we’ll begin there. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
41
 
■ Note  Many examples in this section extend data templates discussed in the appendix’s section called 
“Data Templates”. You are not expected to have read the appendix to understand this chapter; however, it’s a 
good place to go if you’re looking to take your understanding to a deeper level. 
 Typically below the Content node, you’ll have child nodes for each web site you are managing (in the 
case of Figure  2-7 , “Home” might instead be called “Site 1”). In addition to you site root nodes, you’ll have a 
Global folder for content that is shared across sites. 
 Figure 2-7.  Direct decendents below Content typically include  site-level nodes and nodes for globally 
shared content 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
42
 Every item below the site’s root home node is URL accessible. In the case of Developers below 
Audience, you would access that content by navigating to  http://launchcore/audience/developers . 
Therefore, all content items below the site’s home root node will need to be given a layout to control how the 
item is rendered when a user browses to that URL. This is a rather complex topic and will be handled later in 
the section called “Presentation Details and Applying Layouts”. For now, we’ll skip all those details and focus 
on creating content for our Featured Product and Product Promotion data templates created earlier. 
 Getting Started 
 To get started we’re going to create content for a couple data templates, named Featured Product and 
Product Promotion (steps on how to create these can be found in the appendix). We start by going into the 
Content node within the tree view and considering where to put this new content. Here are some objectives 
for these two  components to help us understand where to put the content:
• 
 Featured Product —When someone visits the home page we want a model dialog 
overlay of the site showing a featured product based on that user’s persona and/or 
browsing  behavior . 
• 
 Product Promotion —On the home page there is already a Promo Spot, but it is 
generic and doesn’t have the fields we want when/if we want to promote a product, 
such as the discount, its price, etc. In our data template we’ve extended Promo Spot 
to incorporate these extra fields. 
 Since both of these are components within a page, not a page in and of themselves, we don’t want the 
content to be URL accessible. There are a few ways to accomplish this. We can 1) create the content below 
the site’s start item, but in not giving it a layout it won’t be accessible, or 2) create the content outside the 
start item, such as in the Global folder. In the case of Featured Products and Promotions, there are very 
reusable and would benefit from being in the Global folder. Use the following steps as a guide to create the 
featured  products and promotions :
 
 1. 
 Create a Global folder below the Content node if one doesn’t already exist. Below 
that folder create a Content folder if one does not already exist. You create folders 
by right-clicking the parent, choosing insert, and then choosing Folder in the 
drop-down menu.  
 
■ Note  Oftentimes a developer or administrator would have first set up the Content node’s structure that a 
marketer will be working in. You might not have the security access rights needed to create folders. In general, 
this chapter assumes you will have a rather high level of access. If you find yourself not seeing an option in the 
user interface that aligns to these steps, ask your administrator to make your requested changes or to increase 
your access rights. 
 
 2. 
 Below the Content folder, create two new folders—Featured Products and 
Product Promotions. 
 
 3. 
 Give the two folders icons to make it easy for end users to know what they’re 
working with. Click the folder. Under the Configure tab, click the Icon drop-down 
within the Appearance section. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
43
 Before we start adding content to these folders, we need to talk about insert options. The standard 
behavior of a folder is that only administrators can add content or folders, unless you specify insert options 
that allow non-admins the ability to create content specifically permitted within that folder. The Insert from 
Template option allows an admin to select from all data templates that exist, but that option is only available 
to admins. So it is important to specify insert options, since marketers can’t create content if you don’t, and 
you want to control what content goes where. If we have a folder called Featured Products, we only want 
featured products to be in that folder. The following steps walk you through setting up insert options:
 
 1. 
 Click the Featured Product/Promotions folder. 
 
 2. 
 Under the Configure tab, within the Insert Options section, click Assign. 
 
 3. 
 Select the data template(s) you want to permit, which in this case would be 
Featured Product and Product Promotion, respectively. 
 
 4. 
 Remove the Folder insert option because we don’t want users creating folders 
below these nodes. 
 When it’s complete, the Insert drop-down menu should look something like Figure  2-8 (note again that 
only admins will see the Insert from Template option). 
 Figure 2-8.  Insert options can be used to control what new content can be added below certain nodes       
 Remember the Source column on our data template fields (steps found in the appendix)? For Featured 
Product and Product Promotion we had Image fields and Related Product fields. Each of these fields allows 
the user to navigate to or search for other items within Sitecore, such as an image or other related product. 
Since our Source columns are not established, the user will have to navigate across the entire content tree 
to find our Featured Products. Rather, let’s go back and set the source now that our Featured Products folder 
exists. Use the following steps to get this done:
 
 1. 
 Select the Featured Products folder below the global content node. Then, click 
the red menu next to Home and then click Item Properties (Figure  2-9 ). 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
44
 Figure 2-9.  Every item has  standard properties , such as its path within Sitecore 
 
 2. 
 Select and copy the Item Path value. This is the path to the folder within the tree 
view and will become the source for our Related Products fields. 
 
 3. 
 Paste this value into the Source column within the Related Products fields within 
our Featured Product and Product Promotion data templates. 
 Finally it’s time to add some content into Sitecore! It only took about 20 pages to 
get to this point. In some sense that sounds a bit ridiculous, it’s a good example 
of what it takes to really get to a point where you’re adding content. There’s a 
saying: “Sitecore is like a Ferrari engine. You know it’s fast, but just because you 
bought it doesn’t mean you can use it.” The foundation must be paved before our 
marketer friends can get productive! 
 
 4. 
 Create three Featured Products and Product Promotions. Don’t worry about the 
Image fields or Persona field just yet. We’ll cover media next and personalization 
in Chapter   4 . Click Save after each one. We’ll discuss publishing later as well. 
 Managing Rich Media 
 You will want to store all your rich  media in the Media Library node within the tree view. The Media Library 
is your one-stop show for all your digital assets, including images, documents, videos, and audio recordings. 
You will want to organize your items within folders named appropriately. After you create a folder, when you 
click on that folder you will see three options: 1) Upload Files, 2) Upload Files (Advanced), and New (Sub) 
Folder. You can upload one or many files by simply clicking the Upload Files button and selecting the files 
you want to upload. 
 Advanced (Figure  2-10 ) upload provides a few extra  features   worth noting.
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
45
• 
 Unpack ZIP archives —This option will unpack a zip file containing an image, rather 
than upload the ZIP file itself. 
• 
 Make uploaded media items versionable —By default media files are not versionable 
(see the “Content Versioning” section later in this chapter). You can specify 
language-specific versions of a file by making the files versionable. Additionally, you 
can rotate in/out a version of a file, say when you have a seasonal promotion. 
• 
 Overwrite existing media items —Check to overwrite existing files of the same name if 
they exist. 
• 
 Upload as files —Files will not render a preview. 
 A neat feature of the Media Library is the Image Editor (Figure  2-11 ). The Image Editor allows you to make 
minor cropping, resizing, and rotation edits to photos. To open the editor, simply click the image you want to 
edit, and then under the home page, click Edit under the Edit section and then click Edit in Image Editor.  
 Figure 2-10.    Advanced  media upload   can be handy, such as upacking a ZIP file       
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
46
 Figure 2-11.    Sitecore comes with its own image editor for basic editing, such as cropping or resizing  images 
 Execute the following steps to continue our configuration of our Featured Product and Product 
Promotion  components. This will limit a Featured Product’s product image to be chosen from a specific 
location within the Media Library :
 
 1. 
 Start by creating a Products folder in the Media Library below a folder named 
similarly to the site’s name below Content and Templates for consistency.  
 
 2. 
 Click on the new Products folder, and then click the red menu and click Item 
Properties (Figure  2-10 ). Copy the Item Path value.  
 
 3. 
 Now that we have a folder for our product images, navigate to the Featured 
Product data template and update the Source field on the Product Image field. 
Paste the Item path into the Source column in the Product Image field, clicking 
Save when complete. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT

SHOULD YOU STORE MEDIA IN THE DATABASE, FILESYSTEM, 
OR A CDN?
 
 By default, all media is stored in the SQL  database . An alternative to storing your media as BLOBs in 
the SQL database is to store them on a network path with SQL simply serving as a pointer, similar in 
concept to remote BLOB storage. 
 Storing media in the database offers unique advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage 
to this is the peace of mind of a simplified architecture and fewer steps to worry about during a 
disaster recovery. The biggest disadvantage is the potential for very large databases that might make 
recoverability times longer during an outage if you needed to restore from a full backup. 
 Performance, in some cases, might benefit from getting the files out of the database. Specifically, large, 
infrequently used files such as videos, would benefit from being served from the file share. The ASP.
NET BLOB cache can be used on your web front-end servers to cache large, frequently accessed files, 
thus mitigating performance concerns in those cases. However, if you have thousands of videos being 
accessed often, but each individually infrequently, that initial deserialization out of SQL can be a doozie. 
In these limited scenarios you have a strong case to move your media files out of SQL. A CDN is the best 
choice if performance is a concern. Offloading all assets to a separate provider can have a significant 
positive impact on your infrastructure. However, using a CDN is commonly the most expense of options 
for very busy sites. 
 For 99% of the cases, leaving the media files in the database is the best practice. Fortunately, files can, 
on a case-by-case basis, be put in the database or the file share. This can be helpful for the edge cases; 
however, users will need a lot of training to understand when to select the Upload as Files checkbox. 
Or, you can force it one way or another. 
 Consider the following  web.config settings to tweak this behavior:
• 
 Media.DisableFileMedia —By default Sitecore permits the user to specify at upload time 
where the file should go, in the database or in the file share. This setting by default is 
false, thus permitting file share uploads. You can disable file share uploads by setting 
this to true, forcing all files into the database. 
• 
 Media.UploadAsFiles —By default media files are uploaded into the database. 
This setting changes the default behavior to upload to the file system (Upload as 
Files setting checked in the Advanced Upload dialog). This setting is ignored if 
DisableFileMedia is set to true. 
• 
 Media.FileFolder —Here you can specify the UNC of the path to which files will 
be uploaded. 
 Working in the Experience Editor 
 Now that we have out data templates in place, and we have content created that our components can render, 
it’s time to add those components to our site with the  Experience Editor  . But first, a brief tour is needed, 
as there is a lot you can do with this tool! 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
48
 A Brief Tour 
 The experience editor within Sitecore allows users to administer content within a WYSIWIG editor 
(what-you-see-is-what-you-get). This can be very helpful, because in the content tree you are often left 
guessing what it will look like when you click Publish (or better yet, Preview), leaving you to click Publish 
dozens of times before getting it right. With the Experience Editor you can see those changes immediately. 
See Figure  2-12 for an example. In this case the user is updating the hero image header text to “I know 
exactly where this will go” by simply selecting the text and typing the new message. 
 Figure 2-12.    In this figure you can see how users might go about updating the content on a page. They simply 
select the content  placeholder that they want to update and start typing! Very easy 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
49
 Home Tab  
 The Experience Editor is administered with the following tabs in the ribbon: Home, Advanced, Experience, 
Optimization, and View. The Home tab is the logical place to start (Figure  2-13 ). When you set out to edit 
a page, the first thing you may want to do is lock the page so others can’t override your changes (proper 
configuration should make this unnecessary). In the Home tab, within the Edit section, notice the Lock/Unlock 
button. When you click this that page will show up in your My Items (count) bucket. The My Items button 
shows you all the content that you have locked for editing. It’s important to keep an eye on that to ensure you’re 
not causing your colleagues frustration. Additionally in this section, you can rename the page’s name and 
display name, where the name is the key and the display name is a language-specific translation of the name.  
 From the Home page you can also insert new components onto the page. Under the New section you’ll 
notice the Component button. When clicked, you’ll be able to see all the locations where you can add new 
components, as seen in Figure  2-14 ’s Add Here links. The Add Here links correspond to content placeholders 
within the layout the page is assigned to. When you click one of the Add Here links, a pop-up will appear 
showing you which components are permitted within that content placeholder. If your component doesn’t 
appear in the dialog pop-up, you can add it to the allowed components list, steps continued from previous 
sections. 
 Figure 2-13.    The Home tab has basic settings, such as adding components and pages, locking items for 
editing, and publishing settings 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
50
 Figure 2-14.    You can set an icon on components to make it easy for editors to know what to choose when 
adding new components onto a  page 
 Notice also the Insert Page button within Edit. Recall earlier how in the Content tree the Home node 
below Content is URL accessible. Any page, therefore, below Home can support child pages. Each child page 
can have a set of data templates marked as allowable to be created below any given page. When you click 
Insert Page, those allowed templates will appear, and if those templates have a Layout assigned they will act 
as child pages (more on layouts later in this chapter). Refer to earlier steps in this chapter on setting Insert 
Options to control what types of pages should show up in the Insert Page dialog (specifically, Steps 16-19 
apply here as well). 
 The Publish section will be covered in more detail later in this section. However, the obvious is 
obvious—you need to Save and then publish your changes before they will go live on the site. Workflow 
makes this a bit more complex, and therefore will be covered in greater detail later. 
 The Social section makes it easy to post links to this page on social networks, such as Facebook or 
Twitter. You can store credentials to your account in Sitecore, and from the Social button (Figure  2-15 ) you 
can enter your message and even associate links back to campaigns you’re running (more on campaigns in 
Chapter   5 ). 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
51
 View Tab  
 There’s not a whole lot to say about the View tab (Figure  2-16 ), but what there is to say can save you a lot of 
annoyance. The important point is the Enable section. There are basically two things you can do when in the 
Experience Editor: 1) you can edit content, and 2) you can design the page (add/remove components, change 
component properties, etc.). The trouble is it can be tricky to do both at the same time, which is the default. 
Sometimes you might be trying to configure a components properties, but since the component renders a lot 
of text it can be impossible to actually select the component apart from selecting and editing the text.  
 Figure 2-15.    Built-in  social integrations   make campaign integration easy       
 Figure 2-16.  The View tab controls what options are shown within the Experience Editor, such as what mode 
you are editing in, showing/hiding the nav bar, and so on 
 To disable inline text editing, simply uncheck the Editing checkbox. This will enable only the design 
features of the Experience Editor. Vice versa is true if you only want to edit text, but that usually is less of a 
problem. Rather, it is  very helpful to disable both of them, because until they are unchecked you cannot click 
on links. If you want to edit something other than your home page, this is worth noting. Alternatively, 
you can launch into Preview mode from the Content Editor by clicking Preview on an item deeper in the 
tree—jumping straight to that item. 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
52
 Figure 2-17.  The Experience tab allows you to toggle between languages and devices to get a sense of the user’s 
experience from various perspectives 
 
■ Tip  Uncheck both the Editing and Designing checkboxes on the View tab if you want to move the 
Experience Editor onto another page. Otherwise, you’ll be stuck on the home page. 
 Experience Tab 
 The  Experience tab (Figure  2-17 ) has a few neat tricks worth considering. The first is the Date section. 
Publishing will be covered more later, but in regard to the Experience tab and the Date section it’s worth 
noting that publishing can happen in the future and for only set durations. For example, you might want two 
versions of a page, a main version and a version for a holiday promotion coming up. The holiday version is 
not the current published version, but it’s coming up this weekend. If you change the dates you can see what 
the page will look like for future publishing event. 
 The Language section lets you toggle to other languages you have installed. You can translate, save, and 
publish those versions. Similarly, you can toggle the Device to see what the page will look like on different 
devices. Layouts will be covered in more detail later, but for this point it’s worth noting that you can have a 
layout dedicated to each device you are supporting, such as phone, tablet, and desktop. This is often referred 
to as adaptive design. In most cases, however, you’ll have a responsive design so you’ll only see the Default 
device as selectable, since one single layout responds automatically to all browser widths. 
 When you toggle the device to, say your mobile layout, note that it only toggles the layout. If your browser 
wide is 2,000px wide, obviously that’s not a good test of what it’ll look like on an iPhone. In this case you can 
install Simulators ( Simulator section , Figure  2-18 ) to see for real what it will look like on those devices.    
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
53
 Advanced and Optimization Tabs 
 The  Advanced tab is used to configure presentation details and is covered in the “Presentation and Applying 
Layouts” section later in this chapter. The  Optimization tab   is all about content testing, such as A/B testing. 
This is an advanced topic warranting its own chapter; see Chapter   5 . 
 Previewing, Exploring, and Debugging 
 The  explore and debug features of the Experience Editor are some of the most compelling features in 
Sitecore. You’ll notice a Mode section within the ribbon while in the Experience Editor. By default you’ll be 
placed in the edit mode, which has already been explained previously. If you click Other, you’ll notice three 
hidden options, Preview, Explore, and Debug (Figure  2-19 ). 
 Figure 2-18.  You can add device simulators to get a sense for how the site will look across a multitide of 
devices without actually needing to buy that device 
  Figure 2-19.  The Experience Editor has four main views: edit mode, preview mode, explore  mode (called the 
Experience Explorer), and debug mode 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
54
 Figure 2-20.    The Experience Explorer allows you to simulate user personas and test user personalization 
configuration 
 Preview removes the editing/design capabilities similar to unchecking the boxes within the View tab. 
This allows you to easily click around the site and navigate to the page you want to edit. 
 Explore is very compelling. Explore is more formally called the  Experience Explorer . The Experience 
Explorer allows you to monitor your activity on the site and see how optimization and personalization rules 
are reacting to your behavior. Notice the drop-down menus on the left and the right in Figure  2-20 . Among 
other options, the left is showing which goals you’re hoping your behavior will trigger for testing purposes. 
On the right you’ll notice how the behavior has categorized the user as a “Developer” persona. Future 
personalization is using this classification to drive rendering behavior, such as which components to show 
developers versus other personas. At the top of the right drop-down, notice that the page views are counted 
along with the Engagement Value that has accrued as a result. More on these concepts can be found in 
Chapter   4 . 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
55
 The other helpful mode is  Debug mode (typically for Developers only). Debug mode spits out a bunch 
of reporting at the bottom of the page, which shows performance and exception feedback (Figure  2-21 ). This 
is a great tool to use if your page is responding very slowly and you want to understand which component is 
to blame. 
 Figure 2-21.  The Debug mode within the Experience Editor allows you to see helpful performance data so you 
can better troubleshoot problems

 Working with Components 
 In this section we’ll continue our previous steps of configuring our Featured Products and Product 
Promotions. We’re at the place where we have just about everything ready to add our components to the 
page. Our data templates are configured, and we have content in the content tree built using those data 
templates. Our last step is to drop components on the page that renders our content, which in this case are 
our featured products. 
 A component  renders data stored in the content tree based off a template. You will need a developer 
to build components to your specifications. The following steps show general guidelines for working with 
components, but some of the settings may differ depending on how your components were constructed. 
 If you recall, it is easy enough to add a component to a page. Simply open the Experience Editor, and 
from the Home tab within the New section, all you will click is the Component button. This will load the 
component picker dialog showing all the approved components you can select from. Every layout will have 
one or more placeholders. These placeholders are set up in the Content Editor, below Layouts ➤ Placeholder 
Settings ➤ your site name. Follow these steps to allow marketers to add components to a placeholder:
 
 1. 
 Open the Content Editor.  Expand Layouts ➤ Placeholder Settings. Continue to 
browse until you find the placeholder you want to edit. Note: If you don’t know 
the name of the placeholder you want to edit, you can delete the components out 
of that placeholder and then select them. You’ll see the name of the placeholder 
(and a shortcut to editing its properties), such as in Figure  2-22 . 
 
 2. 
 Select the placeholder, and under the Data section, note the Allowed Controls 
list. Click Edit. 
 
 3. 
 Browse to the component(s) you want to allow. Double-click them or click the 
right arrow to move them to the right side of the selector. Click OK and then click 
Save on the placeholder. 
 
 4. 
 To add our  Featured Product placeholder , go back to the Experience Editor and 
delete the Promo with Thumbnail component. Select it while in Design mode 
and click the red X (Figure  2-23 ). 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
57
 
 5. 
 Click New ➤ Component in the Home tab, and then click Add Here in the 
placeholder you recently edited. Select the component and click OK. 
 Yay! We have a component on the page. Oftentimes  you will have components that need to render a 
content item. In our example, our component needs to render a featured product. There are three main 
ways to do this: 1) user configured by setting the component’s datasource, 2) user configured by setting a 
component property, and 3) programmatically controlled by a developer. We’ll focus in on the first two since 
the third option will be different for each implementation.
 
 1. 
 Setting a datasource: click the component, and then click the  Datasource icon   
in the gold component menu (third from the left in Figure  2-23 ). A pop-up 
will appear; select the item from the content tree you want to associate to the 
component, such as a Featured Product. 
 
■ Tip   A best practice is the component would prompt the user to select the datasource once it’s dropped 
on the page. This can also be the right time to prompt the users to create a new content item if one doesn’t 
exist that they want to use. In this way, marketers can be empowered to administer content wholly from the 
Experience Editor, never needing to go to the Content Editor and learn two systems. 
 
 2. 
 Setting a property: Click the component, and then click the More button in the 
component’s menu, and then click Edit Component Properties. If you scroll 
to the bottom of the component properties you’ll notice a Parameters section 
(Figure  2-24 ). You can add any arbitrary set of parameters that you want to pass 
to the code/developer, but know that the code needs to specifically be looking for 
them or nothing will happen. Click OK. 
 Figure 2-23.    A component has a myriad of settings you can configure, such as its datasource, personalization 
settings, or even custom settings 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
58
 You’ll notice a few interesting options on the More drop-down (Figure  2-23 ). The Edit Experience Editor 
Options dialog lets you configure a lot of valued component settings, such as the following list. Edit Related 
Item takes you to the content item assigned to the datasource, making it easier to navigate to the Featured 
Product, for example, and make some updates without digging for it in the tree view. Here are the settings 
you can apply to a component from within the Experience Editor options: 
 
■ Note  Only Developers or above will see the More button on a component. 
• 
 Thumbnail —When you’re browsing for components it is very helpful to see a 
thumbnail image to help you select the right one quickly.  
• 
 Editable —Uncheck if you do not want users editing the datasource item’s content 
values. If unchecked the content drawn within the component will be static. 
• 
 Datasource Location —This helps you narrow down for your content admins where 
the content should be coming from. In the case of our Featured Product component 
we would want to set this to the Featured Products folder within the content tree. 
• 
 Datasource Template —Alternatively you can narrow the results to just a specific 
data template. 
 Figure 2-24.     Custom component properties   allow marketers to easily tweak how a component behaves       
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
59
• 
 Compatible Renderings —In Figure 2-23 the second icon in the menu is the replace 
icon. At times you may want content admins to be able to swap out one component 
for another, but retain the properties. To enable this, you must specify which 
components are compatible with this component. Note that it is a two-way street; 
you must do the same on both components so they are compatible with each other. 
• 
 Experience Editor Buttons —Developers can create custom buttons to show on the 
component menu. After they are installed they will show up in this list if you want to 
add them to the menu. 
 
■ Note  Personalization and testing are also driven at the component level from the component button bar. 
These topics are covered in more detail in Chapter   4  . 
 Managing Thousands of Items with Buckets 
 It’s great that we now have our Featured Product being rendered on the home page, but before we go 
beyond content editing fundamentals, we need to cover a few miscellaneous topics. One of those topics is 
that of  buckets . 
 Buckets enable you to make sense of thousands of items in your content tree. Take for example our 
Featured Products. It is very likely that over time you may have hundreds of products you may want to 
feature. If you put all that in the tree view, that tree view will become virtually unusable. The tree view will 
become very long, and it will be very hard to find the product you are looking for. By converting that folder to 
a bucket, all of the child items are hidden from the tree view and all that is left is a search box. 
 
■ Tip   If you have a lot of items in a bucket (even 100, but certainly 1,000,000), you will be relying exclusively 
on search to retrieve them. If you need to retrieve “an item” your search will require carefully planned metadata. 
The more fields that you items are tagged with, and the more unique values that are placed in those fields, the 
better chance you have at not losing those items, or during an audit, of finding them. 
 Converting an Item to a Bucket 
 To  convert  an item to a bucket, simply click the item, and then under the Configure tab, click Bucket. This 
may take a few minutes. All the child items should now be hidden after the process completes. If some items 
remain unhidden, that means those items are not marked as “bucketable” in their data template’s standard 
values definition (more on standard values in the appendix). For now, just know that on the standard values 
you need to ensure the Bucketable Settings, Current Item checkbox is checked (Figure  2-25 ). 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
60
 
■ Note  Usually only administrators or other advanced users see the buckets settings and convert items into 
buckets. Specifically, you need the Sitecore Client Bucket Management role to perform this configuration. 
 If this value wasn’t checked, you don’t need to re-bucket your bucket after checking it. What you can do 
is simply check the box, save the standard values, and then go back to your bucket and click the Sync button 
under the Buckets section within the Configure tab. This will attempt again to add all child items to the 
bucket that have their standard values set to bucketable. 
 Searching a Bucket 
 Searching a bucket is pretty much like searching anything else. Since, however, search in this case is critical 
(because you can lose items if you can’t find them later) it’s worth calling out in particular. The key to 
searching buckets is to do constrained field searches. If you have 1,000,000 items in a bucket and you want a 
result set of one single item, you will likely need to filter the results based on several specific field values (if 
you developer hasn’t setup readily available facets). To do this, simple enter your field name in the search 
box followed by a colon. You’ll then see the search change, prompting you to ender the value for that field. 
Additionally, you can configure “can include,” “must include,” and “cannot include” rules on the fields. 
Figure  2-26 shows how the search is trimmed to items that match on the Title, Department, and Customer 
fields (for example, the fields will be whatever is available in your data templates).  
  Figure 2-25.  You can convert an item to a bucket to more easily manage thousands or millions of items 
in Sitecore 
 Figure 2-26.  Once an item is a bucket it is easy to search that bucket for items and even to create property 
restrictions to narrow the result set 
 You can toggle the can|must|cannot settings by clicking on the search magnifying glass on each field. 
Notice how the Title field could start with Important; the Department field must not start with Human 
Resources, and the Customer field must start with Contoso Corp.

 Archiving Content and the Recycle Bin 
 Deleting and archiving content will happen all the time in the lifecycle of a content administrator. The 
Recycle Bin and the Archive are two separate things, and it’s important to understand their differences. 
 Recycle  Bin Settings 
 By default, when you delete an item in Sitecore it is not deleted permanently. Instead it is moved to the 
Recycle Bin. Your Sitecore Recycle Bin behaves just like a Windows PC recycle bin. Stuff sits in the Recycle 
Bin until someone permanently deletes everything in it. This is good and bad. It’s good because it takes 
an intentional action to delete stuff. It’s bad because your Recycle Bin might get huge and waste valuable 
storage space. Additionally, if you have many people working in Sitecore, you may delete things that 
someone else later might have wanted to restore, so it’s important to use discretion. 
 The Recycle Bin can be accessed from the desktop or the Launchpad. From the desktop, click Start and 
then you’ll notice the Recycle Bin link under the All Applications drop-down. Simply click an item and then 
click the Restore button to restore that item. You can also use search to find your items if there are too many 
to sort through.  
 
■ Note  By default, only administrators can see items they themselves didn’t delete. 
 The Delete button will permanently delete the selected items in the Recycle Bin. The Empty button will 
permanently delete all items in the Recycle Bin. The Show Versions checkbox will expand versions of the 
items in the Recycle Bin in case you want to restore just one particular version of a deleted item, rather than 
all versions. 
 It is common for Recycle Bins to grow forever and become a nuisance for your administrators 
and infrastructure team who is concerned about restorability and recovery times. You may prefer to 
simply disable the Recycle Bin rather than run the risk of it growing too large (not a best practice). In 
this case, a simple web.config change can do this. Disable the Recycle Bin in web.config by setting the 
 RecycleBinActive setting to false, or for a given database, remove the /archives/archive/recyclebin 
element. 
 Archiving Content 
 There may be content that you want removed from your site, but not deleted permanently. Perhaps this 
content has legal implications, such as customer correspondence data. In these cases it makes more sense 
to archive this content. Sitecore has an out-of-the-box archiving provider that looks and behaves nearly 
identically as the Recycle Bin behaves. It’s a bucket of stuff waiting to be deleted, but with a name that is less 
inviting to deletion (Archive vs. Recycle Bin). 
 Anything in the content tree can be archived. Simply click the item, and then in the Review tab click the 
Archive drop-down (Figure  2-27 ) to show three options. You can archive that item immediately, archive just 
a particular version of that item, or set a future date to archive it. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
62
 These basic settings may or may not meet your legal compliance obligations. It’s a bit beyond the scope 
of this book, but it’s worth noting that this archiving framework is extensible. A common pattern is to disable 
the Recycle Bin and force all deletions to be sent to the Archive instead. Then, code can inspect the incoming 
item for legal complications. If it matches legal requirements for archiving, you may want to send it to an 
external archiving system or database. If not, you might instead send it to the Recycle Bin or just delete it on 
the spot. 
 In the web.config, under archives/providers, you can specify your class that handles an incoming 
archive request. That class can have whatever logic you need to meet your compliance obligations. 
 
■ Must Read   See one of John West’s blog posts, which shows sample code for how to tap into the archiving 
pipeline:   http://bitly.com/1DxntPw 
 Content Versions and Multilingual Language Support 
 Any piece of content can have more than one version of that content. Each version can be translated into one 
or more languages. This section shows you how to configure multiple versions and how to translate those 
versions into multiple languages. 
 Managing  Multiple Versions 
 A seasonal promotion is a good example of why you may want to have more than one version of the same 
piece of content. Perhaps you’re having a sale over the Black Friday weekend and you want your home page 
to look different from Thursday through Sunday. Instead of making all the changes and clicking the Publish 
button Thursday morning, and then reverting all those changes and clicking the Publish button again 
Sunday night, you can handle this with a second version of that page. Use the following steps to create a 
second version of your home page (repeatable for any content item) that is published only for a specific 
date range: 
 
■ Note  Versions can also be used for experience optimization, such as A/B testing. This is a topic beyond the 
scope of this chapter and is covered it great detail in Chapter   4  . 
 Figure 2-27.    The Archive is similar to the Recycle Bin, except that archived items typically are not meant to be 
deleted perminently 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT

1. 
 Click the item you want to add another version to. Then, under the Version tab, 
click the  Versions drop-down . This will show you all the versions available for 
this item (Figure  2-28 shows there is only one version so far). 
 Figure 2-28.    You can add a new version to an item. Perhaps you would do this to manage an upcoming 
weekend promotion. Or, you may want that item translated into another  language         
 
2. 
 At the bottom of the drop-down, click the Add Version link. 
 
3. 
 In the Publish tab, click Experience Editor to launch the Experience Editor.  
 
4. 
 While in the Experience Editor, on the Home tab click the Settings button within 
the Publish section. 
 
5. 
 Configure the date ranges you want your alternate version published, such as 
seen in Figure  2-29 . 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
64
 
6. 
 Publish the alternate version by clicking the Publish button in the Home tab (you 
may need to approve a few workflow items to get it totally published). 
 
7. 
 Back on the Experience tab within the Experience Editor, toggle the dates 
forward and backward to confirm that your alternate version and original version 
are swapping on the expected dates.  
 The  publishing viewer offers a graphical representation of when things will be the published version, 
as can be seen in Figure  2-30 . Within the Content Editor, click the item and from the Publish tab click 
Publishing viewer. As you can see in this figure, the only version published over the Holiday weekend would 
have been version two. Thereafter, version 1 is the published version again.  
  Figure 2-29.  You can set a  data window to control when a specific version will be the published version 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
65
 
■ Note  If you don’t fully approve/publish an alternate version it won’t be the published version even if it falls 
on the date specified in publishing settings. If the expected version isn’t approved, Sitecore will choose the first 
version that is published. 
 Content  Language Translation 
 Sitecore does a phenomenal job managing multiple language translations of content. Truly supporting 
global sites is where many  web content management solutions (WCMS) break down. Not Sitecore. Not only 
is it easy to set up, it behaves and is managed nearly identically to any other content management we’ve 
already discussed. 
 As described in the last section, any piece of content can have any number of versions. Any version 
can have any number of languages that it is translated into. It is a simple process to create a new language 
(below System ➤ Languages), and then on a piece of content toggle to that language and translate the values 
(Figure  2-31 ). 
 Figure 2-30.  There is a nice report to see which version will be published on which dates. In this case, version 2 
represents a custom home page created just for the thanksgiving holiday weekend 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
66
 
■ Tip  It’s also worth checking out a service called Clay Tablet if you want to route content for external 
translation. Their Sitecore connector makes for the easiest content translation imaginable. See more at: 
  http://www.clay-tablet.com/products/cms-connectors/sitecore . 
 Follow these steps to create a new language and a new language version for a piece of content:
 
1. 
 Right-click Languages and choose Insert Language. 
 
2. 
 Choose the language from the supported languages drop-down. Click Next to 
accept the default language and country region codes (recommended).  
 
3. 
 Click Next to accept the default encodings (recommended), and click Next again 
to accept the default spellcheck files. 
 
4. 
 Find the content you want to translate. With that content selected, click the 
Language button from the Versions tab. Select the language you want to translate 
the content into.  
 
5. 
 You will see a prompt  informing you that a language version does not yet exist for 
this new language (Figure  2-32 ). Click Add a New Version to create one. 
 Figure 2-31.  It is easy to toggle between languages when on a piece of content. Just click the drop-down! 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
67
 At first you’ll see an empty item with no data. You’ll want to add your translated content into the fields. 
A helpful way to know what to add is to click the Translate button in the Versions tab. This will open up 
a side-by-side view of two languages helping you know what to translate. Notice in Figure  2-33 we have 
Swedish on the left being translated from the English version. The source language can be changed to 
another language version by toggling the Language drop-down next to the Translate button in the Ribbon.  
  Figure 2-32.    You may notice that a content item doesn’t have a translated version for all configured 
languages. Simply click Add a New Version to remedy this 
 Figure 2-33.    Translation is made easy with a side-by-side comparison of source to destination  languages 
 When you are done translating the content you will want to publish it. Click the Publish Item button 
found within the Publish drop-down on the  Publish tab   in the ribbon. Notice how in Figure  2-34 we have 
multiple languages to select from. By default they will likely all be selected. It is important to deselect 
versions not yet ready for publishing. After you have approved it you will likely need to publish the workflow 
before it will show up. From the Home tab, click the Edit drop-down and click Submit. Then, click Approve 
Without Test (Figure  2-38 ) to finally get the item published to the production web site (workflow is covered 
in greater detail later in this chapter). 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
68
 Yah! In the following example, we’ve just published the Swedish version of the site. But oh no! It looks 
horrible. It may seem obvious, but you have to translate  all the content before you’ll want to publish the 
item, especially an item as high level as the home page. 
 
■ Tip  A good thing for your developers to consider is what the language fallback strategy should be. 
A developer can configure Sitecore to fall back to the default language if not all fields are translated (called a 
“partial language fallback”). Without a plan in place you’ll notice behavior similar to what’s seen in Figure  2-34 . 
Language Fallback is now built into Sitecore 8.1. It requires administrator configuration to enable. See the 
following kb article for more details:  https://doc.sitecore.net/sitecore_experience_platform/
language_fallback/enable_and_set_up_language_fallback 
 Note in Figure  2-35 how the Home page  data template fields   have been translated as you saw earlier 
in Figure  2-33 , but the rest of the page is blank. There is one piece of content that shows up—the Developer 
audience component. Each component on the page is pointing to a piece of content. Those components will 
start rendering their data as each of those pieces of content are translated, published, and approved. 
 Figure 2-34.    Now when you publish you need to be specific as to which language to use       
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
69
 Figure 2-35.    Notice the URL. This is a simple way to force a language change on the user  
 There’s also another problem with the Swedish site. Namely, there is still a lot of English on it! Notice the 
search box says Search, as well as the Learn More links. This text is hard-coded into the components, rather 
than localized. Instead, these values should be values in the content tree like everything else. A good place to 
put them would be Content ➤ Global ➤ Settings, since they are likely settings easily shared across all sites. 
If they were in the content tree, you would be able to translate and publish them just like other content. 
A development best practice is to retrieve these localized values, versus putting them directly in the code.  
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
70
 
PRACTICAL TIPS: CONTROLLING THE DEFAULT LANAGUAGE 
WITH GEO-LOCATION AND BROWSER PREFERENCE
 
 Notice the  ?sc_lang=sv-se in the URL (Figure  2-35 )? This is how you control which language the user 
sees, which in this case sv-se is the code for Swedish. Using a convention of   http://www.site.com/
sv-se is actually the  more  normal practice. 
 In either case, this code is whatever you put in the language country/region codes form when you 
originally set up the language. A developer can write code to do geo-location to detect the IP of the 
users and where they are coming from. Based on this location information you can append this little bit 
onto the URL to change the language. 
 A second option is that the developer can look at the browser settings of the user. A browser stores 
language preferences and you can use these to know which language to show. You probably want to 
use some combination of both geo-location  and language preferences to know where the users should 
go (or better yet, offer a suggestion of what you think they want, and ask them to confirm). For a global 
site, you may need to redirect them to the Chinese site based on geo-location, but you may need to rely 
on browser preference to determine if you should show Mandarin or Cantonese. 
 After the user is first sent to the page with the  ?sc_lang=ab-cd value, the language will be set for that 
entire session. Thereafter, you no longer need to worry about keeping that value in the URL, unless of 
course you want to change it to something else. Note, however, that for SEO purposes this isn’t a best 
practice. A   http://www.site.com/sv-se/xyz convention is preferred. 
 Content  Cloning 
 Content inheritance is a powerful tool in your information architecture arsenal. Imagine a single piece of 
content replicated across 100 instances ( clones , as they’re called) across your site. This ability to manage 
content in one, centralized location can have many uses. Global sites are a great example. Perhaps your 
U.S. site is the main site, but you also have regional sites. Some of the regional content is unique, but much 
of it needs to be reused. Content inheritance here allows you to manage the content centrally and have it 
propagated to all your regional sites. 
 To clone an item, simply click the item in the content tree and then click the Clone button under the 
Configure tab. A pop-up will appear asking you to specify where you want to place the clone. This can be 
anywhere in the content tree, even another site. 
 After the clone is created you’ll notice it reuses all the values from the  original item . Note in Figure  2-36 
how next to the Title field there is a [original value] message. This is informing you that the field is getting 
its value from its original item. Note as well there is a value now in the Created From Quick Info details. The 
original item’s value for this is blank, but the clone has a reference back to the original item. “Original Item, 
en, 1-{guid}” represents the name of the host item, the language of that item, the version number of the item, 
and that item’s global ID. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
71
 While this is all fine and good, there are important scenarios and gotchas worth considering. Consider 
the following  scenarios :
• 
 You edit a clone’s field and thereafter the original item’s field is updated —In this 
case the clone will not receive the update from the original item. Instead, when 
you browse to the clone, you’ll see a prompt (Figure  2-37 ) asking you to resolve the 
conflict. You can 1) review the original item and see what the new value would be, 
2) accept the incoming value, or 3) reject the incoming value. 
 Figure 2-36.    “Original item” text next to a field informs you that the item is a clone and it’s getting its value 
from another item       
 Figure 2-37.    Cloning can  result   in conflicts. Fortunately, Sitecore recognizes conflicts and will help you 
through them 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
72
• 
 You delete an item that has clones —Upon deletion you will receive a prompt 
informing you of the existence of clones. If you proceed all clones will essentially be 
“uncloned” and they will act like normal items going forward.  
• 
 You create a child item below an item that has clones —Upon creating the item you 
will be prompted to see if you want to also clone the child items as an optional step.  
• 
 You clone an item that has running workflow —When you clone an item with a 
running workflow the workflow data is also copied but not cloned in the same sense 
that field data is. There is no link between the parent workflow and its state and 
cloned workflows. They will behave independently. 
• 
 Cloning an item that has multiple versions —A clone is only the clone of one single 
version, whatever version you had selected on the original item when you clicked the 
Clone button. If that original item has many versions you’ll need to click Clone on 
each individual one. 
• 
 You add a new version to a clone’s original item —This won’t be a problem since, 
again, a clone is based on one single version, so adding more versions won’t affect 
existing clones. However, you get a helpful prompt on the clone notifying you of the 
new version and asking you if you want another clone for that version. 
• 
 You add a new version to a clone —If you add a new version to a clone, that new 
version becomes a new clone pointing back to the original item the original clone 
was based on. This is basically like copying a clone, and there are not many good 
reasons why you’d need to do this. 
• 
 A version of the original item is updated— Only the clone(s) created from this version 
will receive the update. 
• 
 You remove a version from the original item— If you delete a version on the original 
item that has clones, those clones are essentially “uncloned” and will act like normal 
items going forward. 
 
■ Note  You can always unclone an item later. Simply click the Unclone button in the Configuration tab. 
Afterward, the item will act like any other. 
 Workflows and Publishing Overview 
 The term “published” in Sitecore means a few things. First, the item has been approved via a workflow 
and rests in the final state of the workflow. Second, the item has been copied into the web database and is 
available on the content delivery server. A piece of content is never published until the workflow is over, 
assuming a workflow has been assigned to the data template, and the content is copied to the web database. 
There are a few out-of-the-box workflows that this section seeks to explain. 
 
■ Note  This topic of workflows quickly moves into building custom workflows, since no business operates 
in the exact same way. Custom workflows, however, are an advanced topic typically performed by developers 
(even though it doesn’t necessarily require coding). As such you can read more in the appendix if you want to 
take your knowledge of workflows to a deeper level. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
73
 A  workflow in Sitecore is composed of three main building blocks: states, commands, and actions. 
A workflow “state” is basically the status the workflow instance is assigned to. For example, a state might 
be “pending approval,” “approved pending publishing,” or “published”. The state helps explain what the 
workflow is waiting for, such as some human interaction. 
 Within a workflow state you can have  multiple commands . A command is something a human will 
execute as they interact with the workflow. For example, Approve and Reject are two common commands 
a workflow approver would perform. A command’s primary job is to move the workflow from one state to 
another. The Approve command might move the workflow to the next state, and the Reject command might 
move the workflow back to the start, for example. Commands show up in the Edit window (Figure  2-38 ) on 
an item for those who have access to click them (see Chapter   8 for more details on workflow security). 
 Figure 2-38.  Workflow commands appear in the user interface for those who have access to advance the 
workflow from one state to another 
 A secondary duty of a command is to have a collection of actions. When users click the Approve 
command, you may want to send an e-mail or send a message to an external system. Unfortunately there 
are only a few valuable out-of-the-box actions, such one for sending e-mails another for validating the data 
before it gets approved. This means you will likely rely on a developer for more advanced business processes 
beyond simple Approve/Reject and basic notifications. 
 
■ Note  Sitecore is not a  Business Process Management (BPM) system .  Complex business processes should 
be managed outside of Sitecore. Rather, the workflow capabilities Sitecore are meant for near-finalized content. 
Anything beyond this requires heavy customization that you typically get out-of-the-box in an enterprise BPM 
solution. Keep focused on basic approval of content, where you’re more focused on how the content looks 
on the site (such as mobile renderings) than the content itself. If you’re a third-party ISV, there is a ton of 
opportunity here for a lightweight BPM add-in into Sitecore, as a full BPM solution is likely also more than what 
most marketers need. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
74
 The  out-of-the-box “sample workflow” is a good case study when learning on these building blocks 
work together. You can find and create new workflows from the System node ➤ Workflows within the 
Content Editor. Notice in Figure 2-39 we have a workflow with three states: Draft, Awaiting Approval, and 
Approved. Below each state we have commands, such as Submit, Approved with Test, and Auto Publish. 
These commands correspond to the earlier figure, Figure  2-38 . 
 Again, these commands move the workflow from one state to another. Notice in Figure  2-39 the 
workflow settings. There is a setting to designate the initial state. Anytime an item is modified it will land 
within this initial state. The commands have a Next State field where you can select from a drop-down that 
the workflow should move to when that command is executed. In the case of sample workflow, the Submit 
command below Draft moves the state to Awaiting Approval. Likewise, Approve with Test and Approve 
without Test both move the state to Approved. Reject as you can imagine moves the state back to Draft. It’s 
important to note that workflows and A/B testing are tied at the hip; Approve with Test is literally how you 
will start your A/B tests (see Chapter   4 for more details). 
 Figure 2-39.    Regular workflow is an out-of-the-box workflow within  Launch Sitecore   (similar to sample 
workflow) 
 
■ Caution   Administrators bypass workflows! This is why you don’t want administrators administrating 
content, as you will no longer have tractability into who changed what, why, and when. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
75
 At each leg of the journey the users are prompted to enter comments as to why they approved or 
rejected the item. These comments are stored in the item’s workflow history for tractability later, such as 
during an audit. The workflow history can be viewed from the Review tab ➤ History button within the 
Workflow section, as can be seen in Figure  2-40 . 
 Figure 2-40.    Workflow  history provides a helpful way to determine why content was changed and by whom 
 It can be very hard to manage your workflow tasks, such as approval requests, when you’re working 
across hundreds of items with content being published continually. E-mail actions can help mitigate this 
pain, by notifying you of when someone is requesting your approval. However, this has its limitations as 
well. Within Sitecore there is a concept called the “workbox” where all your workflow tasks are aggregated. 
This creates a one-stop-shop if you’re unsure of the state of things. You can get to the workbox from the 
Launchpad or from the desktop. 
 Notice the workbox in Figure  2-41 . When you first get there you will probably see a blank screen. You 
must first check which workflow you want to see status on (upper-left corner of the workbox). Thereafter you 
will notice all running workflow states you have security access to see (such as Draft or Awaiting Approval, as 
can be seen in Figure  2-39 ), along with quick access to the commands you have access to execute (buttons). 
In this example for the “regular workflow,” you’ll notice in Figure  2-41 there are seven items in a draft state 
with two items waiting my approval. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
76
 Figure 2-41.  You can use the  workbox to easily see the status across multiple workflows in Sitecore 
 
■ Tip  The RSS feature of the workbox is really powerful and unfortunately too often underused. It’s a great 
way to be notified that you have something awaiting your attention. If you don’t want to use an RSS client, a 
developer can set up e-mails based on the RSS feed that are better than the built-in workflow e-mails. See this 
blog post for more details:   http://bit.ly/1JdO3A0 . 
 We should now go ahead and add a workflow to our data template’s standard values, now that we have 
a basic understanding of workflows. A workflow will not run on a new item’s creation or when content is 
edited unless a workflow is assigned to that piece of content. The best practice way to do that is assign it to 
the content’s data template’s standard values. 
 
■ Note  In almost all circumstances, a developer would be the one to configure standard values. See the 
appendix for a description of what standard values are, how they’re configured, and why they are helpful. It’s 
an advanced topic beyond this chapter and the core audience of this book. However, because of the universal 
tendency to apply workflows to standard values, the subsequent content is left in context. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT
77
 Like any other time when you need to configure standard values, expand the data template and select 
the __Standard Values item below the template. Workflow settings are hidden by default. You need to check 
the Standard Fields checkbox within the View tab to get them to show up. Thereafter you’ll see like 20 new 
sections of configuration options appear, with workflow being one of them. Set the Default Workflow field 
to the workflow you want assigned to that item. Leave the other fields alone, as they are used after the item’s 
instantiation. Note these three steps in Figure  2-42 . 
 Figure 2-42.    You can make a workflow start automatically when someone edits a piece of content by adding 
the workflow to that content’s  data template’s standard values item 
 
■ Note  The __standard values of your template should only have the default workflow field set. Do not set 
the workflow field on the __standard values. That would set the __standard values item itself as a workflow. 
Similarly, do not set the State field on the __standard values item as that is saying that the __standard values 
item is in that state. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ MANAGING CONTENT

INTRODUCTION TO WORKFLOW SECURITY
 There’s an entire chapter dedicated to security (Chapter   8  ). However,  workflow is pretty tightly 
coupled with security, since you typically have different people creating version-approving content and 
subsequently have the authority to publish that content.  
 You can find more details in Chapter   8 , but suffice it to say  workflow  security is treated like security for 
any other item. Security is applied to items within the content tree. You can grant rights to items to roles 
or users individually. Typically you will create a role and assign that role access rights to items. 
 From a workflow perspective you are securing the workflow items, which in this case are the states and 
commands different roles or users are allowed to participate in. For example, if you don’t have access to 
the Awaiting Approval state but you do the draft state, you will only see Draft items in your workbox. 
 It is a common pattern to create three main roles: Editor, Reviewer, and Publisher. An Editor can create 
content, but can also have access to the Submit Workflow command to move the item to the Awaiting 
Approval state. Reviewers might not have access to publish content, but they would have access to 
review and approve content. A Publisher then may tee up batch publishing during select windows, and 
therefore are the only ones who would have the access to move the items to a Published state. See the 
appendix for how to create a custom workflow with four states such as this, and see Chapter   8  for how 
to take that workflow and apply security. 
 Summary 
 Wow, we’re making progress now! By this point we have definitely picked up our friend Mr. Scarecrow and 
well on our way to the woods where we hope to find more friends, like, perhaps a tin man. We’ll see. For 
now, it is suffice to say that we’ve effectively paved a solid foundation of Sitecore that we can use as we 
continue our journey home in subsequent chapters. 
 The key points in this chapter were the fundamentals of the content editor, and specifically how 
information is organized in Sitecore. We discussed the importance of having a solid grasp of key concepts, 
such as data templates, content items, and their presentation details. The Sitecore hierarchy is truly Sitecore 
bread-and-butter, and prerequisite knowledge before continuing on into future topics. 
 Beyond this overview we went deep into each of those three foundational items. We covered what goes 
into a data template, how content inherits those templates, and options for configuring data fields. 
 Next we covered content editing fundamentals, including a deeper tour of the Experience Editor as 
well as administering content within the content tree. We learned how you can manage millions of items 
with buckets, as well as how to manage multiple languages and translations. Content needs presentation 
details, so Sitecore knows how to render that content. Those details include configuring layouts and content 
placeholders. All of these settings can be configured on a data template’s standard values to ensure that new 
items leverage common, global settings. Even things like workflows can be configured as default settings, to 
ensure items flow through your standard business processes. 
 With content editing under our belt it’s time to take things deeper and start building more robust 
experiences and web applications. The next step in our journey is to learn how to add forms into our site 
to capture customer information and interactions. We’ll take a deep dive into a popular and foundational 
module: Web Forms for marketers.

 CHAPTER 3  
 Experience Personalization 
 This is the chapter we’ve all been waiting for, and it’s likely the chapter you bought this book for in the first 
place. We all think personalization is going to save the digital marketing world. Personalization makes all 
sorts of promises that we all get really excited about. 
 Personalization is kind of like the Good Witch of the South in the  Wizard of Oz in this regard. She 
promises a path to digital marketing bliss, meeting the unique needs of each user in this “age of the 
customer,” or world of Oz we live in. 
 However, just as the Good Witch shows you the path to ROI and your eventual promotion, you realize 
that the path has many perils. Few have survived to see personalization in all its glory as she describes it. In 
fact, it’s rumored that nearly 85% of so-called “ digital marketers ” still are not fully utilizing these capabilities 
at their fingertips. Too bad the “good witch” didn’t go with you on your journey, much like Gandalf did in  The 
Lord of the Rings.  Dude—he fought a Balrog for Frodo! Nope, no such help with our friend from the south of 
Oz; you must fend for yourself. With a wave of the hand and a friendly, but sort of sinister, “good luck,” she’s 
off to finish her cup of tea. 
 Fortunately for you, you have  a  good book in your hands that will guide you to the ROI and promotion 
she so shallowly promised you. This chapter seeks to explain the ins-and-outs of personalization in Sitecore. 
 The discussion on personalization will start with a comparison of rules-based and predictive 
personalization. These two types represent degrees of complexity, but also degrees of reward. Rules-based is 
great for basic personalization, but lacks the all-encompassing knowledge of your customer that predictive 
promises. 
 Predictive personalization is heavily dependent on  personas . The next part in this journey is 
understanding personas, tips for defining them, and how your personas get implemented in Sitecore. From 
here we can finally start configuring personalization and hopefully experience the wonderful bliss we’ve so 
desperately been searching for all these years. 
 Let’s begin! 
 What Is Personalization? 
 Web site  personalization usually results in three different changes you would choose from:
• 
 Change the content that’s rendered (i.e. update a component’s datasource to 
something other than the default).  
• 
 Change which component is rendered (i.e. swap the default component out for a 
totally different component). 
• 
 Hide the component. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
80
 There are two main ways to configure those changes. You can assign display rules onto the components, 
or you can use pattern cards and drive the personalization based on which persona Sitecore thinks the 
current user is (formally called predictive personalization). These two options are compared in this section. 
In the next section, we’ll show the steps to configure each. 
 There are other options for personalization beyond the web site. You can also personalize e-mail and 
print experiences. Those topics are more advanced and not covered in this book. 
 Rules-Based vs.  Predictive Personalization 
 You can personalize your site to match unique customer needs in two main ways: rules-based 
 personalization (also often called ad-hoc personalization) and predictive personalization (also often called 
 behavioral personalization ). Rules-based personalization is super easy to understand and configure. When 
you personalize a component, for example, a pop-up appears showing you dozens of rules you can select 
from to change the behavior of that component. 
 Rules are essentially if/then conditions. You can assign multiple rules to a single component and the 
rule that matches first wins. The winning rule dictates how the component is personalized. 
 Notice in Figure  3-1 the  Rule Set Editor . Again, there are many dozens of rules to choose from. For 
example, you may want to change the datasource on a component if the user entered the experience from 
an e-mail campaign (first item in the figure). Perhaps the e-mail promoted a specific product and you want a 
10% off coupon to display on the home page in an attempt to get that user to convert. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
81
 The second option is interesting as well. Engagement value points are accrued as the user completes 
goals or events. Maybe you have a user who is highly engaged, but has not yet converted or accomplished 
the goal you are really wanting her to accomplish. Perhaps in these special situations you would want to 
sweeten the pot and offer a 20% off coupon to push her over the edge. This rule would help you do that. 
 In both of those examples the rule is again a simple if/then clause. The rule does not know or care about 
 who the user is, i.e. their assigned persona. 
 Personas  are a way to characterize a set of behaviors that different types of customers may share. You 
may have 4-8 personas trying to represent your different customer’s behaviors. Personas help you prioritize 
features and the design of your site based on which personas get the highest priority. However, they can also 
drive personalization. 
 Persona-based predictive personalization is easily the most robust personalization option in Sitecore. 
Instead of a series of if/then clauses, Sitecore can watch the movements, behaviors, and actions taken on the 
site and attempt to match those behaviors to the persona that most closely personifies those behaviors. 
 Figure 3-1.  The personalization Rule Set Editor lets you quickly apply rules to your content to change how it 
behaves based on your user’s needs 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
82
 The  benefit here is that personalization requirements are not usually so simplistic and if/then clauses 
fall short of a marketer’s expectations. You may need to personalize based on 5-10 considerations, many of 
which are less objective than a rule. A persona can characterize those more subjective qualifications. 
 Predictive personalization works by tagging content with profile cards. Basically a profile card has different 
keys and each key is scored. Notice the keys in Figure  3-2 (i.e., Contributor, Learner, People-Finder, etc.).  
 Figure 3-2.    A profile card is composed of keys with each key having a value. Together these keys/values 
represent the wants, needs, and desires of a persona 
 These keys are assigned to profile cards and weighted differently based on what that profile card 
represents. Personas are represented in Figure  3-2 , with Paula Policy, Ralph Requester, and Lenny Learner 
assigned to a content item at different weightings (note the percentages). 
 A  profile card  may or may not be a persona, but usually is. A profile card could instead be more generic, 
such as “High-Level” or “Detailed” if you want to tag content based on its information type. In that case, 
rather than persona (or in addition to) you may want to keep tabs on the level of detail the current user 
prefers to see. Perhaps you have people named Paula who prefer high-level content, and people named 
Paula who prefer the details; but in both cases these Paulas want to see policy information. This example 
lends itself to using two separate profile cards: one for their persona and another one (or more) for their 
other preferences not represented within the persona itself. 
 
■ Tip   Don’t go crazy with profile cards! It’s best to create solid personas that characterize your users. 
Information Type actually isn’t a great example to use a second card. “Buying stage” might be a better example, 
with keys such as Prospect, Qualified, and Customer (post-conversion). In this example, the persona is not 
changing when the user flows through your funnel—it’s still the same customer. High-Level/Detailed would most 
likely be manifested in the persona itself, thus making them redundant and adding needless complexity to your 
personalization strategy. You want a really good reason to create profile cards that extends beyond your personas. 
 In Figure  3-2 , notice how the requester and policy keys are both assigned four points, and the learner key is 
assigned two points. Any user who browses to this content item will accrue these points across these categories. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
83
 
■ Note   You can test this and watch points accrue through simulations in the Experience Explorer. See the 
“Personalization Testing in the Experience Explorer” section later in this chapter. 
 Over time, as the customer engages across many pages/items, these points can start being matched 
against profile cards and a card will be assigned to the users when their points matches a card. Then, you can 
show personalized information to that card, such as content tailored specifically to the needs of Paula Policy 
or content that is “high-level” if you were tracking something more generic such as information type. 
 Notice in Figure  3-1 there is a rule you can assign to a component to target a profile/pattern card. The 
rule matches when the current user has been assigned to the Paula Policy persona. Of all the rules in the 
rules picker, this rule is the most powerful. In the next section we’ll dive more into personas, since good 
personas are the foundation of your personalization strategy. 
 
STRATEGY BITS: SEGMENTING YOUR USERS
 
 Personalization begins with knowing who your users are. What do they expect from you? What are their 
needs, wants, and desires? What are their preferences? These questions are very difficult to answer 
without a  segmentation strategy . 
 Your segmentation strategy should encompass two main points: 1) implicit segmentation, driven from 
user behavior and 2) explicit segmentation, based on data you have on file about that user. 
 Fortunately your persona strategy gets you through most of the first point—your implicit segmentation 
strategy. By tagging pages with your personas, users accrue points for each aspect of the persona and 
eventually fall within a persona based on a matching algorithm that works to get them into a persona 
that is closest to their behavior. 
 However, in addition to personas there are other things you should consider when creating your implicit 
segmentation and personalization strategies. For example, what goals and events did the user perform 
during their visits? Did they enter the experience as a result of a campaign? If so, how then should the 
experience be tailored? Perhaps the user experienced a failure event. Can you respond and rebuild trust? 
 These are all more complex examples, but it could be as simple as location or basic demographics. 
Would someone in an urban setting want to see something different than someone in a rural setting? 
 All these questions may or may not be represented in a persona. You need to think beyond personas to 
really grasp a complete implicit segmentation and personalization strategies, especially regarding things 
such as goals and campaigns, which are so often glossed over in a Sitecore context. 
 Explicit segmentation and personalization is another area that is commonly overlooked when creating 
segmentation and personalization strategies. It’s great to personalize based on behavior, but what if 
their behavior falls short of answering some important questions you have about the user? What do you 
do then? Funny enough, the answer is quite simple—ASK THEM!  
 Explicit segmentation is very pragmatic. Present a call-to-action where you collect important 
information about that user. News sites often use explicit segmentation to drive their personalization. 
Have you ever gone to your local news site and they prompted you for your news preferences, such as 
neighborhoods you do/don’t want to see news about, or your preference to see sports over crime news? 
This is explicit segmentation at work. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
84
 Another example of explicit segmentation might be a request to fill out a survey, or even as basic as site 
registration. When your customers register for your site, what can you ask them to better understand 
what their expectations are? 
 The fundamental problem with explicit segmentation is user resistance to provide the data you need. 
This resistance is usually due to laziness, but sometimes due to security concerns. Laziness needs to be 
overcome with simplicity and a strong call to action. It’s your job to make them really want to enter that 
information. If you don’t, they won’t. Security needs to be overcome with statements of trust. Provide 
them details into your security hardening strategies and other customers who have entrusted their data 
to you. Additionally, show them a transparent and easy-to-understand privacy policy. 
 The bottom line here is that your personalization strategy needs to be paired with a segmentation 
strategy, which asks the question, “how will we know who are users are?” Don’t rely solely on 
behavioral patterns, and don’t rely solely on just the data you have in your CRM. Don’t forget about 
goals, events, and relation to campaigns. You need to bring it all together in one holistic segmentation 
strategy that accounts for all the facets of implicit and explicit segmentation. Leave no stone unturned 
in your search for what motivates your customer!  
 It All Starts with  Personas 
 Since personas are the foundation of creating an effective predictive personalization strategy, it makes a 
ton of sense that you want to create good personas that match the needs, motivators, and attitudes of your 
customers. There is a ton of literature on personas you can read elsewhere. Since, however, personas are so 
foundational to a Sitecore deployment, a quick intro makes sense.  Personas   tend to be categorized in three 
main categories: their goals, their behaviors, and their attitudes.
• 
 Goals —Some personas are driven by a specific purpose, such as the need to find the 
best price on a specific watch. They come into your experience with a specific goal in 
mind and they want you to help achieve that goal right away. 
• 
 Behaviors —Behaviors are patterns you observe a persona taking, such as reading 
every review possible or coming back to the site five times per day. 
• 
 Attitudes —An attitude is a point of view the persona brings with them when they 
enter your experience. For example, a persona might be a staunch believer that 
used cars are preferable to new cars or that Cannon makes the best cameras. You 
need to understand the attitudes of your customers to ensure your tailor to those 
expectations right away, or are very intentional to change those opinions. 
 Personas are behavioral categories that combine these three dimensions into unique statements of 
purpose or intent on behalf of any given customer who may enter the experience you are building. Personas 
are not roles, such as Director of Operations or CEO. Personas are clusters of behaviors. It is especially 
important to know the difference for sites such as vendor portals or customer portals. 
 The Persona  Workshop 
 So how do you actually go about creating your personas? Holding a 2-4 hour persona workshop with key 
stakeholders is a great way to go about it. Fill the room with 6-10 individuals who either are your customers 
or know them very well. Use the following process as a guide. The result of this should be a common 
agreement to who your experience’s personas are and how they should be prioritized.

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
85
 Identify all the  roles —When dealing with portals, such as customer portals or 
partner portals, it helps to identify roles. Personas and roles are not the same 
things! However, people tend to understand roles better than personas and 
getting them on the table helps facilitate a discussion. Roles likely won’t exist for 
public-facing brochureware sites or e-commerce sites. Create a large post-it note 
for each role and stick these around the room. 
 Identify all the  events —Events are things users can do on your site. Go through 
each role (or generally if no roles exist) and create a post-it note for each event 
that user/role would want to perform on the site. Stick it under the appropriate 
role, if applicable. 
 Identify  behavioral patterns —Throw all the role post-its away and instruct the 
room on the difference between roles and behaviors. Stack up all the event 
post-its into one pile. One by one, compare each post-it to another and ask this 
question: When the user comes into the experience motivated to do event A, will 
they likely also be doing event B at that time as well? If the answer is yes, group 
the two together. If no, create two groups. Move on to event C and do the same, 
either putting it into category one or two, or creating a third category. Do this 
until all the events are sorted into behavioral categories. 
 
■ Tip    Don’t let the room fall back into role-based thinking! Two different roles may come into the experience 
both motivated to do the same thing. It will be impossible to prioritize personas, features, and campaigns if 
there is a ton of redundancy in your personas! 
 Remove obvious  behavioral categories —Take a look at the categories. It is likely 
that you may have 15-20 categories on the board if you had 75 event post-its 
you sorted through. 15-20 is way too many. You should shoot for 5-10 personas 
at most. Compare each category to your company’s business objective or more 
specifically the objectives of the site, and give each one a rating from 1-10 on 
how well it aligns in support of those objectives. Discard anything rated <7. If 
your team finds this hard to do, remind them that a site needs focus. A watered 
down experience that leaves users unsure of what they can use the site for is 
not effective. A separate site/experience may be needed to better support those 
categories rated <7. 
 Create personas —The categories that are left become the building blocks for 
your persona. Go through each category and describe that persona’s motivators, 
pain points, and alignment to business objectives. Also, describe the goals you 
have for the persona, things you want that persona to do that they might not 
themselves know to do or plan to do (such as make a purchase when they are 
just coming to read reviews). When complete you may have a  high-level persona 
description such as the one for Lenny shown in Figure  3-3 . 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
86
 You can much more easily create a personalization strategy when you have personas such as Lenny 
identified for your site. Additionally, when personas are prioritized against the site or company’s business 
objectives, it is much easier to understand which features or capabilities of the site need to take priority and 
which features can wait for a later release. 
 Creating a Persona Journey 
 The next stage in creating a persona personalization strategy is to determine each persona’s  unique journey 
you want them to embark on. Sure, priority #1 is the create an experience that  they want to engage with; 
however, it’s just as important to know what you want to get each persona to do. In the case of Lenny, 
he is a basic information seeker engaging in a partner portal solution. He has a question and he wants it 
answered. But, can we get him more engaged? Can we work to change his behaviors and attitudes, such that 
he becomes an active contributor and an active promoter of the portal? Can we change Lenny’s persona to 
another persona that creates more value for our business? What we want to do is create an engagement 
plan for Lenny that leads him toward becoming a more engaged, more valuable customer. 
 One could argue that each persona may get its own yellow brick road of sorts. In Sitecore, a persona’s 
yellow brick road is called an engagement plan. An engagement plan leads a persona toward a desirable 
outcome. Engagement plans dovetail closely with campaigns and are covered in greater detail in the next 
chapter. However, now, when discussing personas, it’s helpful to keep engagement plans in mind. In 
 Figure 3-3.    Creating your personas on paper before you create them in Sitecore is critical. Be behavior-centric, 
not technology-centric or role-centric in your persona strategy 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
87
Figure  3-4  you’ll notice a persona engagement funnel that we want Lenny to flow through. He starts as a 
basic information seeker, but in the end becomes an active contributor and promoter of the partner portal 
solution. Create something similar for each persona. In the next chapter we’ll work to make these journeys a 
reality by incorporating the user into an engagement plan. This is the foundation of Marketing Automation 
in Sitecore. 
 Figure 3-4.    People have aspirations and goals for their life, and so should your personas! Create a persona 
digital funnel and map out how your want your personas to evolve over time (and become better customers) 
 For now, describe each stage in the funnel. How do you nurture this persona in particular? How do you 
get them to advance their stage? Content should be aligned and personalized to each persona and ideally 
each stage to ensure the persona is advancing deeper into the funnel. This exercise will help you add greater 
depth into your personalization strategy beyond the obvious. You will likely find content gaps, and gaps in 
your strategy for various personas and their respective stages. This is a good thing! Work to close these gaps 
over time, and in doing so your digital experience will be increasingly personalized, customer-centric, and 
value-laden for your business. 
 Predictive Personalization  Terminology 
 We need to get some nomenclature under our belt before we dive in and configure our personas and 
thereafter personalization. The following are all key concepts for Sitecore personalization. Most of them are 
covered in detail in this chapter, but others, such as goals and outcomes, are covered in the next chapter 
with more context provided. For now, however, when planning your personas it is good to have all the 
 nomenclature  in mind so you know holistically what you should be planning for.
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
88
 Profile cards —Remember that a piece of content can be tagged to a  profile 
card . As the user navigates around, numeric values are accumulated and those 
values are used to match the user with the closest profile card that represents 
the user’s behavior (pattern card to be precise—more on that later). A profile 
card commonly is akin to a persona. However, you may have profile cards for 
individual goals, behaviors, or attitudes, such as the example provided earlier 
about information type—High-Level and Detailed. 
 Profiles —Profiles are just categories of profile cards. Profile cards are what 
you attach to content so Sitecore can start tracking behavioral patterns and 
match a user to the nearest cards. However, you can have multiple categories 
of cards assigned to a piece of content. Figure  3-5 shows some content that has 
assignments for the Persona and Information Type profiles. 
 Figure 3-5.    You can assign your personas to  content items  to help drive a matching algorithm for site visitors 
 Profile  keys —Keys represent the goals, behaviors, and attitudes of a profile card. 
Take the Lenny persona profile card shown in Figure  3-6 . The Persona profile 
has the following keys: App-seeker, Contributor, Learner, Newsy, People Finder, 
Policy, and Requester. Lenny, then, has values set against those keys to tell 
Sitecore who Lenny is and what his preferences are. You can see that Lenny is 
primarily a learner, but also cares a fair amount about getting the official policy 
stance on important subjects. To a lesser extent he is a contributor and people 
finder. Keys, as you can see, weigh the persona accordingly.   
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
89
 Pattern cards — Pattern cards are used to match the current user’s key values and 
accrued points against some set of standard values. To be perfectly explicit, a 
user is matched to a pattern card, not a profile card. Profile cards set how much 
value is given to the different keys, whereas pattern cards look at how much value 
the user has accrued across the keys, with the closest matching pattern card 
being assign to the user. It’s all rather confusing, but suffice it to say your pattern 
cards most of the time will be configured to look identical to your profile cards. 
 Figure 3-6.    Technically speaking, personas match profiles, profile keys, profile cards, and pattern cards (and 
events, failure events, and goals—but more on that in Chapter   5 !) 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
90
 
EVENTS, FAILURE EVENTS, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES
 Events, failure events, goals, and objectives are all covered in more detail in the next chapter. However, 
they bare significant consequence to personas, so this is a teaser as to what is coming next. 
 Events —Look back at Lenny’s persona in Figure  3-3 . Note specifically the Motivators section.  Events 
are these motivators. You can tag content and actions to events that correspond to a persona’s 
motivators. The benefit to doing this is reporting. Wouldn’t it be nice to validate post-launch that your 
assumptions about your personas are accurate? Reporting can also help you see event trends, where 
trending up means that personas are getting better and better at accomplishing what they are setting 
out to accomplish. 
 Failure events —Notice the pain points in Figure  3-3 as well. These pains points are also events, but 
tagged as failures. Again, reporting can help you understand when you are letting your customers down. 
If you see high failure actions you should update the design/strategy of the site to reduce the amount of 
discomfort you are causing your customers. 
 Goals —Goals are things you want the customer to accomplish. Goals are also noted on the persona 
in Figure  3-3 . Again, goal attainment is easily measured. Goal examples might be downloading a 
whitepaper, registering for a webinar, or just about any action imaginable. 
 Outcomes —These are high-level, macro goals you have for a persona. This might be a conversion from 
lead to customer. In Lenny’s case it means growing beyond just an information seeker and becoming an 
active contributor. 
 Your measurement strategy will benefit by considering objective events, failure events, goals, and 
outcomes during the persona development process. It helps to pair up a persona definition with a 
measurement strategy across these dimensions. The persona itself can remain rather abstract, but 
a technical resource, such as a Sitecore architect with xDB experience, should be weighing in and 
providing ideas to make these points measurable and a bit more objective. 
 Personalization Testing in the Experience Explorer 
 The  Experience Explorer is amazing. There is no doubt that your personalization strategy will be rather 
complex by the time it’s implemented on your site. How do you know if the implementations is built 
according to specification? How do you simulate a persona and see how your site responds to their 
preferences? The answer is you do your personalization testing in the Experience Explorer (Figure  3-7 ). 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
91
 There are a few  use cases you should be aware of:
• 
 Monitoring profile key value accrual 
• 
 Monitoring assigned pattern card/persona 
• 
 Watching the site respond to that persona  
• 
 Manually setting key values to force different behaviors to occur 
• 
 Manually setting the persona you want to set 
 Figure 3-7.  The Experience  Explorer is a great way to see how your session is aquiring persona points 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
92
• 
 Monitoring goals and events you’re engaging with  
• 
 Validating user information, such as location or demographics  
• 
 Manually attributing the visit to a marketing campaign to again monitor how 
personalization responds 
 The left panel lets you manually set the details of what you’re testing. The right panel shows what the 
values are set to. In the case where you’re in Journey mode both will be whatever Sitecore matches you with. 
In the case of Fixed mode, the values in the right will be whatever you set on the left panel. These values can 
be key values, but you can also tag which goals and events you’re anticipating the testing will encounter. 
Additionally, you can set a marketing campaign as a source in the Referral Information section to view how 
your personalization is responding to  campaign referrals (Figure  3-8 ). 
 Figure 3-8.    You can assign your Experience Explorer session to a campaign 
 The  Visitor Information tab on the left lets you assign a device channel as well as location information. 
If you recall, you have create layouts that support different device formats. If your site is fully responsive, 
you likely only have one layout and just one default device. Otherwise, you may have multiple devices and 
you can swap between then here (the Device tab in Figure  3-9 ). As you can see in Figure  3-9 , it is also very 
easy to simulate location information. Just click the Apply button after your settings are made to see how the 
experience responds. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
93
 You can configure presets if you get tired setting all these Experience Explorer configurations over 
and over again. Your presets can be found in the Experience section. By default there are two: Default and 
Anonymous. It is very easy to create your own, however. Use these high-level steps to guide your creation of 
a preset:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Marketing Control Panel from the Launchpad.  
 
 2. 
 Expand the Experience Explorer node. 
 
 3. 
 Right-click Presets and click New Item ➤ Preset Persona. 
 
 4. 
 Enter as many presets as you want. See the following list for some of the most helpful.
• 
 Name —Name of the preset mostly likely consistent with the persona  
• 
 Image —Always good to give your presets an image especially if it’s correlated to 
a persona 
• 
 Viewed pages —Pages you want the preset to have already viewed 
• 
 Device —Perhaps the preset should be configured to come in on a mobile device 
versus the default 
• 
 Location section —Here you can set the location information when location 
drives personalization 
• 
 History —You can preset up to four different histories, such as page views or 
downloads 
• 
 Profiles —Most important; preconfigure a persona  
• 
 Goals —Configure the goals you want the user to accomplish 
•

 Configuring Personalization 
 This section covers the two main ways to configure Predictive personalization: ad-hoc personalization and 
predictive personalization. 
 Configuring Ad-Hoc  Personalization 
 Personalization is configured at the  component level  for web experiences. The easiest way to configure 
personalization is from the Experience Editor. While in the Experience Editor, select a component you want 
to personalize. Click the Personalization button in the menu (note the arrow in Figure  3-11 ). 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
95
 After you click the Personalization button you should receive a pop-up similar to that in Figure  3-12 . 
Begin by clicking the New Condition button at the top right. The Rules Editor pop-up will appear showing 
you several dozen rules you can choose from. Select the rule you want and fill out the required settings to 
satisfy the requirements of the rule. 
 Figure 3-11.    Configuring personalization on a component is easy; you simply click the icon and set the rule 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
96
 Note that the conditions are served on a first-come, first-serve basis. The first condition whose rule is 
satisfied wins, and that condition controls how the component is personalization. This is done from top to 
bottom, so ensure that your default rendering is the last condition in the list. To change the sort order, click 
the Actions drop-down on the condition and select Move Up or Move Down. 
 After your condition and rule is configure you need to decide how the component should be 
personalized. Note the Personalize Content setting in Figure  3-12 . When you choose this you will be able 
to change the datasource on the component and set it to alternative source in your content tree. This is 
the most basic form of personalization imaginable. Alternatively, you could opt to hide the component 
altogether by selecting the Hide Component checkbox. 
 Another option is to swap out the component entirely. Note the Enable Personalization of Component 
Design checkbox in Figure  3-13 . When this is selected you will be able to swap the default component for an 
alternate. Note now in the figure there are two options: one to select which component is rendered, and the 
same option as was available previously to select the datasource. 
 Figure 3-12.  Conditions are used to tell Sitecore which  content/component version should be used 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
97
 Simply click OK when you’re done personalizing the component. After publishing, your personalization 
settings should be ready to go! It can be quite difficult to know what is personalized on pages, especially 
very busy pages with a lot of personalized components. In the Optimization tab within the Experience 
Editor, there is a Personalization button that shows a helpful pop-up. Figure  3-14 shows this pop-up. You 
can see a quick view of what is personalized on this page. Each component is highlighted with a red box for 
a quick view. Also helpful is some easy-to-understand reporting that shows how often the versions of the 
component are being rendered. Each personalized component is listed on the left with each version. Each 
version will tally how many times it is rendered, giving you insight into how often your personalization rules 
are taking effect. 
 Figure 3-13.  Component personalization is enabled by checking the checkbox 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
98
 Configuring Persona- Based Personalization 
 You configure predictive component  personalization in pretty much the same way you configure rules-based 
personalization, as described in the previous section. Figure  3-1  still applies; there’s a “pattern” rule to 
personalization against the assigned profile/persona. The only difference with predictive personalization 
configuration is setting up your profiles and personas and tagging them to content items. Your customers will 
accrue value points assigned to those personas as they browse your site and interact with those persona-tagged 
content items. Let’s start first by configuring a persona, and then we’ll move into tagging content with that 
persona. Personalizing a component, as described in the previous section, will not be repeated. 
 
■ Note   A new concept introduced in Sitecore 8.1 is ‘persistent profiles’ and the concept of ‘ profile decay ’. 
This means that historical behavioral personalization will be carried over from previous visits. However, you may 
want more recent visits to weigh heavier on how the site is personalized, hence the concept of ‘decay’. 
If you have 100 points for one persona for the current visit, and your decay score is .75, only 25 points will carry 
forward into the next session. See the following post for how to configure decay: 
 http://sitecoreskills.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/behavioural-profiling-improvements-in.html . 
 Figure 3-14.    You can quickly see what is personalized on a page by clicking the Personalization button on the 
 Optimization tab in the Experience Editor 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION

 Predictive personalization configuration starts in the Marketing Control Panel (Figure  3-15 ). You can 
find the Marketing Control Panel on the Launchpad or in the desktop. The Marketing Control Panel contains 
all the marketing automation features that will be describe a bit in this section, but more specifically in the 
next chapter. In particular, there is a node called Profiles where you can add all your personas and other 
predictive personalization profiles. 
 Figure 3-15.  The  Marketing Control Panel is where all the marketing action is. More on this in Chapters   4 
and   5 , but for now, suffice it to say this is also where your personas are configured 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
100
 The structure of the  Profiles node can be seen in Figure  3-16 , as described previously. It is most common 
to store personas below a profile node called Persona. An out-of-the-box Sitecore installation has a bunch 
of profiles (e.g., Focus, Function, etc.) that you probably want to delete. Likewise you will want to delete the 
out-of-the-box personas since they are just there for example purposes (e.g., Cecile, Chris, etc.). It is also a 
best practice to have the Profile Keys align with the persona behaviors,  not  with the personas themselves, as is 
out-of-the-box and can be seen in Figure  3-15 . Instead, create keys that align to the behaviors, and below the 
Profile Cards folder create profile cards for your personas. This is demonstrated in Figure  3-16 .  
 Figure 3-16.    A profile has a Type field that’s used to track how the behavior value points are accrued       
 
■ Note   The profile node also as a helpful type setting, as can be seen in Figure  3-16 . This setting controls 
how the value points are accrued as users interact with your persona tagged content. You may prefer a different 
type based on your reporting requirements and the nature of the persona/profile card. 
 In addition to the profile type, you should also consider the Authoring Selection setting (Figure  3-17 ). 
You can configure the profile to allow adding a single persona to a content item, multiple, or multiple with 
percentages. In some cases a content item has relevance across more than one persona so applying multiple 
tends to be necessary. It is a general best practice to apply with a percentage; however, since most commonly 
that content item does not apply equally across all personas. Setting a percentage tells Sitecore what 
percentage of the total points should be applied to the current customer’s browsing experience.   
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
101
 You will create profile keys below your profile nodes. Right-click the profile and choose Insert New 
Profile Key. There are a few settings, most important of which is the key name, such as Learner, and the max 
value. The max value is what is configured when setting up the profile card/persona. A typical max value is 
10. A max value of 1 may be helpful for Yes/No circumstances. Min Value and Default Value may or may not 
be helpful depending on what you’re trying to accomplish with your persona. 
 The real excitement begins when you create your persona cards. These persona cards are tagged onto 
content items, and each of the profile  keys can be weighted on the card. A sample profile key configuration 
on a persona can be seen in Figure  3-18 . Along with the profile card values, it is helpful to set a persona name 
and an image to represent the persona. The images show up as icons when you tag content, so it’s helpful to 
pick a headshot that is distinguishable when trying to quickly see how a piece of content is tagged. 
 Figure 3-17.  A  content item can have one or more profile cards assigned to it 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
102
 
■ Note   Profile cards are created below the Profile Card folder, as you may have guessed. However, there are 
two types of cards that you can create: a default card and a persona profile cards. The only difference is the 
persona cards has a bunch of extra fields you can use to give the profile cards a more “human” touch, such as 
Age, Interests, and Education. These fields are optional. At a minimum, configure the Card Name, Image, and 
Profile Card values. 
 Pattern cards are what a current user’s value accrual are matched with. So again, profile cards are what 
applies value points onto a user’s experience, and a pattern card is what that experience gets matched to if 
the points align to the pattern. The pattern field on the pattern card in most cases is configured identically 
to the profile card. So the settings in Figures  3-18 and  3-19  would look the same. Sometimes administrators 
name the pattern cards “Looks like Lenny,” since they just want to match the user with a value score that 
is similar to Lenny to Lenny himself. About all you need to configure on the pattern card is the name of 
the card and the pattern itself. Thereafter, this pattern card can be used on a component’s personalization 
settings to change behavior for users who behave like Lenny, for example.   
 Figure 3-18.    Create a profile card and assign the key values to connect the card to the persona 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
103
 The last step is to add the profile cards/personas to content items so that when users interact with that 
content item they accrue those value points. Notice the content item in Figure  3-20 . There is a little blue 
profile card box to the right of the content name. When you click this box, you are prompted to add the cards 
you want to associate with the item. 
  Figure 3-19.  Pattern cards are typically created identically to profile cards 
 Figure 3-20.  When you’re ready, assign the pattern cards to content so  Sitecore starts tracking behaviors 
 You can assign as many cards as you want from as many profiles as you want. Note, however, that when 
more than one card is allowed (Figure  3-17 ), you may need to specify a percentage allocation, as can be seen 
in Figure  3-21 . This tells Sitecore how many points to allocate when a content item has relevance across 
more than one persona. In any case, add the applicable profile card(s) to the content item and click OK. You 
will need to publish the item, as well as ensure all the profile cards are published, before the personalization 
will be working in production. 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ EXPERIENCE PERSONALIZATION
104
 Alternatively, you can assign profile cards through the Experience Explorer (Figure  3-23 ). If you have a 
 super wide monitor you will notice a Profile Settings area within the ribbon in the Optimization tab. Once 
you click the double-down arrows, and then click Edit profiles, you will see the same pop-up that you see in 
Figure  3-23 . 
 Figure 3-22.  Afterward the personas appear next to the  profile card blue box 
 Figure 3-21.  You can assign  multiple profile cards to a piece of content. When you do you can optionally set a 
percentage weight

 Summary 
 Well, there you have it! Sitecore personalization at its finest. You can imagine the power and intrigue that 
personalization offers to a marketer; you can create experiences directly correlated to the wants, needs, and 
desires of your customer! That is pretty amazing, and in the “age of the customer,” it is pretty much table 
steaks for web experiences. 
 This chapter compared rules-based, ad-hoc personalization to predictive, or what is often referred to as 
behavioral personalization. If you remember, ad-hoc personalization is the easiest to configure; simply add a 
rule to a component. However, predictive personalization is where the fun really begins. 
 As you know by now, your persona strategy is the bedrock of your personalization strategy. Beginning 
with rock solid personas is key. They must be well aligned to your business objectives, and just as 
importantly, the objectives of your customers. With that in place, it is easy enough to configure those 
personas in Sitecore, tag content to them, and configure your components to be influenced by them. 
 The question we now face is, “is my personalization strategy actually working?” With that we transition 
to Chapter   4 , where we dive into multivariate content testing. You know what they say about ass-u-me(ing) 
your strategy is working; best not leave it to fate and risk our reputations!

 CHAPTER 4  
 Experience Optimization 
 We just discussed personalization in Sitecore, which is no doubt one of the most exciting capabilities 
Sitecore provides. However, having good, highly effective content is the first step to any personalized 
experience. What good is showing your customers content that should be interesting to your customer, 
if that content is arranged in a really crappy way or written poorly? Experience optimization, aka testing, 
tests different content variations and component layouts in order to determine which combination creates 
the most engagement value possible. Experience optimization, then, goes hand in hand with experience 
personalization. The two work together to create the most engaging, valuable experience possible for your 
customers and your business. 
 Sitecore offers  out-of-the-box page comparison testing and multivariate A/B/N testing to ensure your 
content, components, and pages are structured and written as effectively as possible. 
 Do you have a hypothesis, a potentially better way to structure your page? Test it! Know, don’t just 
guess. Are you fresh out of hypothesis? Do you just want to click the Publish button and move on with your 
life? Well, test it anyhow! Test everything! Sitecore’s motto is, “Test everything, everywhere, and all the time!” 
You will benefit from testing whether or not you have a hypothesis. Sitecore, a few days or weeks later, is kind 
enough to e-mail you, letting you know of the results, and asking if you want to take its recommendations 
and update your pages based on them. Pretty easy  and cool! 
 This chapter discusses key considerations for testing that will help you create a testing approach, or at 
the very least, understand some of the terms and get your expectations aligned. Thereafter, we’ll dive in and 
configure the two types of tests available, page tests and multivariate A/B/N tests. 
 Experience Optimization Considerations 
 It makes sense to begin with some  considerations before we dive straight into configuring experience 
optimization and testing in Sitecore. What is A/B testing and how does that compare to multivariate testing? 
There are also some mobile and personalization considerations to keep in mind as you plan your testing 
strategy. Lastly, you need to put your statistics hat on; you don’t want the data to lie to you! 
 What Is A/B and Multivariate Testing? 
 A/B testing  is simply the process of comparing two options and picking the one that performed better. 
A/B testing splits the load across both experiences, where half the traffic goes to variation A and the other 
half goes to variation B. You then want to compare the results of those two experiences. Goals, events, and 
thereby engagement value is the measurement of success in the Sitecore world. You will most likely choose 
the variation that drives most engagement value to become the permanent selection, but because of the test, 
you pick that variation in confidence. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
108
 That is the big attractor with A/B testing. Instead of theories, you have concrete conclusions. Instead 
of telling your boss, “I think we’ll get more conversions by putting the call to action on the right side of 
the article,” you can say, “I compared four variations, and the modal dialog pop-up produced the most 
conversions so it’s now live on the web site across all segments”. 
 
■ Note   A/B testing isn’t a replacement for a good content plan/strategy. There’s a good (and entertaining) 
Atwood article on how A/B testing is really just about smoothing out the details:   http://bit.ly/1ipf2bw 
 Experience optimization in Sitecore enables you to try things and play around with different options. 
These options might be different content variations, different components, hiding components, adding 
new components, as well as trying different personalization settings. In the end you can drive a lot more 
engagement through tested pages than just assuming the current arrangement is best. 
 What then is  multivariate testing , and how is that different than A/B testing? In reality, there is no 
practical difference in Sitecore. We’re at the mercy of industry standard terms. In Sitecore, all testing, or 
more specifically, experience optimization, is multivariate in nature. Multivariate means you can have 
multiple variations all being compared, where the best combinations of variations wins the day. In this 
sense, you are not limited to two variations, A and B. You could have as many as you want. In fact, for busy 
pages such as your home pages, you may find yourself testing 100+ different variations, when you count up 
all possible testing and personalization combinations. 
 There are three kinds of test candidates:
• 
 Page Version —The previous version of the page can be compared to the new version, 
or to another page altogether. 
• 
 Component —Components can have variations of content (by setting an alternate 
datasource) or variations of the component (such as swapping out the component 
for a different one). 
• 
 Personalization —All personalization settings on components are treated similar to 
component test. They are a great way to validate that your personalization settings 
are optimized. 
 
■ Tip   The data doesn’t lie, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be way better. Personalization testing should be a 
key priority for testing in general, not just component variation testing. The test results might show an increase 
in conversion for a given test across all users, but certain users may fare significantly better with a variation 
that is personalized. The selected variation, despite performing best across the aggregate, may actually hinder 
certain customer personas. Knowing the overall conversion rate is 4% is far less valuable than knowing the 
conversion rate for each persona.

STRATEGY BITS: GETTING STARTED WITH TESTING
 
 The digital marketing world moves quickly, as do the expectations of your users. So, when you’re 
managing content for one of your digital properties, it can sometimes feel like a constantly moving 
beast. How do you keep up? The answer is to integrate testing into your overall content  plan .
 Is your brand or product department considering a change to design or messaging? 
Conducting tests can provide leading indicators of what will resonate best. 
 Are your audiences diverse in their demographics or needs? Testing can help you find 
common themes that resonate across your audiences. 
 Is your leadership insisting on “consistency” regardless of the impact on your goals? 
Running quick low-risk tests can help prove your case for performance-focused 
marketing and will help you gain their confidence in your approach. 
 Are you reconsidering a web site redesign or big media campaign? Testing can be a 
cost-effective way to test concepts before larger investments are made. 
 So, where to start? Think about your content as a recipe you are adjusting to bake the perfect cake. You 
have multiple ingredients that you need to mix together in the right way to get the result you need. 
 To execute organized, successful tests, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Create a “test plan” by:
 Creating clear goals for your digital properties, then setting goals for the content 
you plan to test within it. Ask yourself what should this piece of content do to help 
me achieve my broader digital goals?  
 Considering what you want to learn from your test. Maybe you simply want to drive 
more sales. Perhaps you are interested in what content different audiences respond 
to. Maybe you’re simply trying to learn more about who your audiences are. Think 
about what knowledge will help you be most successful, and then create a test to 
help you achieve that knowledge. 
 Creating your hypothesis. This could come from your research department, or you 
may just have a hunch that people will share video A more than video B. Be sure to 
start out with a hypothesis, so you can prove yourself right or wrong. 
 2. 
 Choose a testing approach. There are typically two  core approaches :
 OPTION 1. A/B. These are simply two versions of the same page or page elements 
that are tested at the same time. Traffic is sent to both versions and the response is 
evaluated. A/B testing can help organizations become familiar to the idea of testing; 
they’re low-risk yet can reap significant results in short time periods, especially if 
you have higher site volumes. 
 OPTION 2. Multivariate is popular in organizations that have experience with 
testing. This tests multiple elements at the same time on the same page. This 
method can be a fast way of getting to your ideal “recipe,” especially if you’re 
testing landing pages or e-mails. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION

 3. 
 Select the testing platform, such as Sitecore. 
 4. 
 Decide on the location and time of your test. Start small and build your testing 
volume and complexity over time. 
 5. 
 Test, evaluate, and share your results with peers and senior management. 
 6. 
 Repeat. 
 Looking for a good place to start? Focus on where people will take action so you give yourself the 
best chance of seeing response—your “ingredients” here might be Click Here buttons, form style, 
placement, and words/color/style. 
 Above all, enjoy it—consider testing your secret weapon to achieving your goals!

 Good Expectations (1% Rule) 
 The question, “how do you eat an elephant?” is similar to that of “how do you create a highly optimized 
digital experience?” The answer? You guessed it.  One bite at a time! 
 The biggest problem with experience optimization in Sitecore isn’t the effectiveness of the tool, nor its 
ease of use. The biggest problem is its lack of use. Too often, customers dabble around with testing. They 
run a few tests, recognize they need two weeks to run the test instead of two hours, and only see a 1% gain in 
engagement value as a result. Dismayed, they give up, never to return. 
 How sad! 1% can be add up and become serious revenue if you stick with it. Experience optimization is 
all about continuous improvement. It might be best compared to that of Toyota’s principal of Kaizen, than 
say the U.S. moon landings. Yet often people expect the moon out of testing, which is unfortunate because 
they pass up the 100 small gains that lead them to competitiveness and larger market share. 
 
■ Tip   Understand the impact of your tests beyond their localized results. If you increase conversation rates, 
driving more event registrations, does that take away from them purchasing a product?  
 Landing Pages vs. Corporate Web Site 
 We discussed what you can test (pages, components, and personalization), but where should you test? 
Historically it is far more common to test campaign landing pages, as compared to, say a company web site’s 
home page. The attraction to landing pages is their association to a campaign. That campaign has a budget 
and you need to drive conversions to demonstrate ROI. Testing, then, becomes a way to optimize that 
landing page to ensure you’re driving as many conversions as possible. Additionally, landing pages often 
are far more targeted and personalized than corporate pages. Simplicity requires less testing time, fewer 
impressions, and clearer impact of the test. 
 However, by sheer volume, we often fail to test our corporate pages to our own peril. A corporate page 
may drive 10x more conversions than a campaign, and yet since the home page isn’t associated to a budget 
or initiative we often fail to do the testing where it can have the biggest impact on the company. Oftentimes 
it requires intentionality at the CMO level to drive changes in governance policies to instill this behavioral 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
111
change. Marketers often get too focused on one campaign, taking their eyes of the company’s cash cow, their 
corporate web site. 
 Fortunately for us, Sitecore offers a recommendation on what pages it thinks you ought to be testing. 
This report is shown in Figure  4-1 . The recommendations stem from several criteria: 
• 
 Number of variations—or previous versions—available to be tested (you need 
something to test) 
• 
 Amount of traffic that page receives (it takes  a lot of data/traffic to validate a theory) 
• 
 Engagement value that page drives (you don’t want to test dead ends)    
 Figure 4-1.  Sitecore is kind enough to recommend which pages it thinks would benefit from testing 
 So by all means, optimize campaign landing pages, where you have the most tangible opportunities for 
a conversion to occur. But do not neglect your corporate pages, where you have the by far the most volume 
and thereby the most potential to create new customers.

 Calculating  Statistical Significance 
 Have you ever heard an election poll discuss its “margin of error”? In statistics, understanding the margin of 
error is key to understanding how trustworthy the results and recommendation are. Another way to look at 
the margin of error is to consider a data set’s “statistical significance”. In Sitecore, a test with high statistical 
significance, such as 95%, has a small margin of error and the test’s results are trustworthy. It takes a lot of 
samplings (traffic) to generate a high level of statistical significance. 
 
■ Note   The statistical method Sitecore uses is the Pearson’s Chi Squared test. 
 If you fail to meet statistical significance you may be working on false or incorrect assumptions. 
Above 95% should be your goal. There are a few things that impact your ability to achieve high 
statistical significance:
 Number of things being tested , such as number of pages being tested, number of 
components versions being tested, and number of personalization rules being tested. 
The more things being tested, the harder it will be to achieve statistical significance.  
 The amount of samplings available , such as page hits. If your test for a page gets 
10,000 hits you stand a much better chance of hitting 95% than if the test only 
encounters 100 hits. The more hits, the more confidence the results are because 
they have been validated many times. 
 
■ Must Read   Most winning A/B test results are illusionary! See:   http://bit.ly/1LtaLkV 
 If you’re doing a page test and are comparing two very different pages, it will take far fewer samplings to 
generate statistical significance and thereby confidence in which page creates the most engagement value. If 
you are doing a page test comparing only one page, but 100+ component or personalization variations, you 
are going to need a large sampling size and perhaps a lot of time to get the same level of confidence. As such, 
multivariate page tests with dozens or hundreds of variations should usually be reserved for your busiest 
pages, or you’ll find you need weeks or months (or infinity!) to get enough samplings to validate your theories. 
 
MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS
 
 It’s important to consider mobile in your testing strategy. Traffic sources between desktop and mobile 
continue to shift, commonly becoming a 50/50 split between the two. When the mobile vs. desktop 
experience is vastly different, you may need a different testing strategy. Too often users set up tests 
across desktop and mobile and apply the results equally to both. 
 Perhaps the test resulted in an increased level of conversion for desktop, but a decreased level of 
conversion for mobile. But you never knew and took a recommendation that negatively affected 40% of 
your user base. 
 Responsive design makes this more of a problem. With adaptive design, it is easy to segment mobile 
and  desktop users and view results individually, and then make individual modifications to the 
experience. With responsive design, you do not have as much flexibility. If the experience is dramatically 
different, it may be worth considering adaptive to allow for greater testability. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
113
 Resist the temptation to implement changes based on early feedback. If your test has not achieved 
statistical significance of 95%, be weary of its recommendations. 
 
■ Caution!   Watch out, too, for false positives. Seasonal variables, such as running a test over the Christmas 
season, may create false confidence for other months of the year. 
 Fortunately, Sitecore provides a report when your test is complete (and in progress) of the current level 
of statistical significance. You can see this report in Figure  4-2 , specifically the Confidence measure. When 
the confidence exceeds 95% it is safe to stop the test by picking a winner (Pick as Winner button when one of 
the tested experiences is selected). 
 Figure 4-2.    After a test is complete you can compare results and select a winner that will take over as the 
published version 
 Additionally, before you even start the test you are shown Sitecore’s guess at how long it will take the 
test to achieve statistical significance. You can see this warning in Figure  4-11 later in this chapter when we 
create our first test. Note how Sitecore tells you how long the test will take. In the case of Figure  4-11 , I know 
I won’t be able to wait the 18,986 days to achieve statistical significance (due to one request per day on my 
laptop’s Sitecore instance)!

 Getdatadriven  has a fun little tool (Figure  4-3 ) you can use if you want to do some basic calculations 
on your own. This is helpful when you are planning your tests, so you can get an idea of whether statistical 
significance is possible or not without needing to do the work of setting up the test. Unfortunately it only 
works for two tests and not multiple. Check it out at:   http://getdatadriven.com/ab-significance-test . 
 Figure 4-3.    This helpful tool helps you think through your ability to achieve statistical significance before you 
go through the legwork of setting up a test in Sitecore 
 PRACTICAL TIPS: ONLY USE MULTIVARIET CONTENT TESTING FOR 
YOUR HOMEPAGE OR OTHER BUSY PAGES
 You just saw an example test with two versions of the item, version A and version B. Multivariate 
testing is when you have a myriad of versions and combinations and the goal is to figure out which 
combination is the best. Personalization adds another dimension to the mix. You may want to test 
variations of content, variations of components and display patters, and for various persona/segments. 
You could have hundreds of possibilities when you combine all three of these dimensions. 
 As you can imagine,  multivariate testing is incredibly powerful. You can find the best combination for 
each persona out of a hundred options. The problem with multivariate testing is, yet again, statistical 
significance. You will need  a lot of data (hit counts and conversions) to achieve statistical significance, or 
you will likely be making decisions based on false positives. 
 Therefore, multivariate testing (testing in general beyond more than a couple options) typically should be 
done only on your busiest pages, such as your home page. You don’t want to make dramatic changes to 
your home page without solid justification!

 Optimization  Gamification 
 If you have a large marketing team, you will benefit from Sitecore’s Experience Optimization gamification 
capabilities.  Gamification is a term that describes the intentional creation of friendly competition amongst 
your peers. Sitecore tracks who started a test. It tracks their expectations for the test, whether they are 
guessing, or whether their theories are well founded. When a test is complete, Sitecore produces results of 
the tester’s impact to the experience over time, as well as if they are good guessers. 
 The Experience Optimization dashboard landing page is where all this fun takes place. The dashboard 
can be found on the Launchpad ➤ Experience Optimization button, and is seen in Figure  4-4 . The figure 
example (local PC) has limited data, making it somewhat underwhelming; however, you can see a month 
over month comparison of June against July. Within each you can see a leaderboard of testers who did the 
best those months, who were the best guessers, who had the biggest positive impact on the experience, and 
who were the most active in their testing. This dashboard can certainly be a fun way to drive adoption of 
testing, and is a great way to baseline the giving of recognition or awards on a monthly basis.

 Running Your First  A/B Test  
 To begin  testing  , you first want to decide if you are going to compare two different pages to compare which 
page drives the most engagement, or make tweaks to a single page with the goal being to optimize that 
page. The path to start the test is different based on which approach you take. The former is oftentimes used 
to compare two very different landing pages for a campaign, and the latter is, in general, by far the more 
common approach, where you want to optimize existing pages to make them better. 
 Creating a New Page Test 
 A  page test is used to compare two very different pages to see which page generates the most engagement 
value. This is commonly used when testing different campaign landing pages. Use the following steps to set 
up a page test:
 
 1. 
 On the Optimization tab within the Experience Editor, click Page Test within the 
Create section. 
 
 2. 
 This will launch a new window similar to Figure  4-5 . Select Use Existing to 
compare the current page to another page. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
117
 Figure 4-5.  When you create a new page test, you must use a totally different page, use the current page’s 
previous version, or create a new page version to compare 
 
 3. 
 Select the page you want to test against. A pop-up with the content tree will 
appear, allowing you to make your selection. Make sure your pages are fully 
published before starting these steps. 
 
 4. 
 After you added the page you want to compare, click the Review and Start tab, as 
seen in Figure  4-5 . 
 
 5. 
 The  Review and Start tab has many sections that you need to configure.
• 
 Test preview —Nothing to configure here; it just shows the pages you’ve selected.  
• 
 My expected effect of the changes —This helps populate the “guessing” reports, 
showing how accurate your assumptions are over time. Move the slider to one of 
three positions: I expect a negative, neutral, or positive impact. 
• 
 Percentage of visitors exposed to the test —For a busy page, such as your home 
page, you may not want all traffic to participate. Optionally, slide the percentage 
to a lower level. Note: This may make achieving statistical significance take 
longer or impossible. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
118
 Figure 4-6.  The  Active Tests button in the ribbon is where you can go to see the status of your currently 
running tests 
• 
 Statistics —You can set which level of statistical significance you require before 
the test is deemed complete, optionally 90%, 95%, or 99%. 95% should be used in 
most situations. 
• 
 Test objective —What are you hoping the test will accomplish? You can select a 
specific goal. Whichever variation drives the most goal completion for that goal 
can be automatically deemed the winner, or you can manually select a winner. 
For landing pages this may be appropriate, but for home pages, you typically 
want to select a winner based on engagement value, not a goal (in which case 
leave Trailing Value, the default, selected). Note: Engagement Value is covered in 
more detail in Chapter   5 . 
 
■ Note When testing commerce pages such as a shopping cart, you will typically want to use a Checkout 
Complete objective, especially for brand sites where commerce is potentially one of many goals. Engagement is 
still important but changes to the cart/checkout are typically aimed at increasing cart conversions. 
• 
 Duration —You can select how long you’re willing to let the test run. 
 
 6. 
 Click Start Test when you’re ready. 
 Hereafter your test is running and live on the site. You can always view the status of the test by clicking 
Active Tests on the Optimization tab. You can see the active tests report in Figure  4-6 . It shows how 
many experiences are being tested, how much time is left before the test completes, and the effect of the 
engagement value that has been demonstrated thus far. For more detail you can click on the test to show 
the tests details, as seen in Figure  4-7 . From there you can also change the settings for the test, such as 
shortening the duration or the traffic allocation. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
119
 Figure 4-7.  A  test results page shows the effect the different experience had on engagement value. You can 
select the one that created the most value, and then click Pick as Winner so that version is used for future 
requests 
 From the test details page, you can also see specifics around how each experience is performing 
against others involved in the test. The Engagement Value section, as seen in Figure  4-7 , will tally up the 
engagement value accrued for each experience. If you select one of the experiences you will see details for 
that experience, such as top goals converted, exist points, and site usage. Also from here you can choose a 
winner and stop the test. Stop the test by clicking the Pick as Winner button when you have an experience 
selected. That experience will then become the published version for all future traffic. 
 After you have picked a winner and the test is complete, you will be prompted with a test results 
summary. The summary includes the results of the tests, how accurate your assumptions were going into the 
test, as well as suggestions for future tests that Sitecore thinks may create value for you. Notice the summary 
in Figure  4-8 . 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
120
 Creating a Multivariate Page-Level Test 
 A multivariate  page-level test      is more about optimizing a page than comparing two pages, as was 
demonstrated in the previous section. What we want to do this time is configure component variations on 
a page, such as differing content or different components altogether. We also want to test the helpfulness of 
our personalization. We will begin by creating a new page version, much like you would when you want to 
update the page in general. This is why testing is Sitecore is so elegant—every time you update your content 
you can test it! This is why Sitecore’s motto for testing is, “Test everything, everywhere, all the time”. Basically, 
when you update a page as part of the workflow, click Approve with Test to validate that the updates perform 
better or at least as good as the previous version, or to see certain component variations work better than 
others before you commit the publish for good. 
 
■ Note   Your Sitecore site has to be built with a proper component-based architecture to allow testing of 
components, as seen next. Some Sitecore implementations, especially older/legacy implementations, follow 
more of a “page template” approach. Unfortunately these implementations would need to be refactored to take 
advantage of component testing. In Sitecore 8 though, they could still do page testing. 
 The following steps demonstrate the process of creating a new page version, editing multivariate testing 
on a few components, and approving that page with a test.
 Figure 4-8.    When you pick a winner you’re presented with a  summary screen that shows you what transpired 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
121
 
 1. 
 The easiest way to create a new page version is to simply make a change from 
within the Experience Editor. Note: If you’re an admin your changes won’t go 
through as new versions and you’ll need to create a new version through the 
Content Editor ➤ Versions tab ➤ Add Version link. Another reason to never edit 
content when logged in as the admin! 
 
 2. 
 Select a component you want to test. Click the Test this Component icon, as seen 
in Figure  4-9 . 
 Figure 4-9.  Click the Test this  Component icon to start adding component tests to the page 
 
 3. 
 Click the New  Variation button one or multiple times, depending on how many 
variations of the component you want to test. Select a datasource for each that is 
different, based on your test (you may need to create new content items to set up 
your tests). 
 
■ Tip   Using the  Clone Current Content option can be an easy way to test small changes to existing content 
(Figure  4-10 ). 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
122
 
 4. 
 Optionally, click Enable Variation of Component Design to configure the 
component’s display rendering to another rendering. Between this step and the 
previous step, you can configure any number of content and display variations 
imaginable. 
 
■ Caution    Sitecore doesn’t appear to restrict the available renderings to those that are compatible with 
the current rendering. You may have unexpected results or errors if the datasource (test content item) and the 
component design (rendering) aren’t compatible. If there isn’t already an existing “compatible” rendering to test 
with, you’ll need a developer to create it and deploy to your Sitecore installation. 
 
 5. 
 Optionally, check Hide Component if you simply want to remove the component. 
 
 6. 
 Click OK to save the component. 
 Figure 4-10.  Using the Clone Current Content feature is a great way to make and test tweaks to your content 
without starting from scratch 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
123
 
■ Tip    You may want to test the impact of a new component on a page. If so, simply add it and add a second 
variation that is hidden. This way, the previous layout without the component can be compared to the new 
layout with the component to see its impact on the experience. 
 When you are done editing your components with their tests, simply click Submit below the Edit 
drop-down. You will now see an option to Approve with  Test   (Figure  4-11 ). 
 Figure 4-11.    To start a multivariate test, simply click Approve with Test 
 
■ Note   Depending on your workflow settings specified by your developer, you may or may not be asked to 
“Approve with Test” (or even “Submit” for that matter, since workflow isn’t enabled by default). If you do not see 
this dialog box, ask your developer to add testing into your workflow process, as described in the appendix and 
in particular here:   http://bit.ly/1GoBB8J . 
 When you click Approve with Test you will see a preview pop-up with a button to start the test. The 
Preview page is similar to the Page test seen in Figure  4-5 . What’s interesting, however, with multivariate 
tests is the Variables tab where you can see a list of all the variations configured. Notice in Figure  4-12 how 
we have two types of tests discovered on our new version: component tests and personalization test. In total, 
there are 14 variations that produce altogether 144 unique combinations that can be tested. Again, this is 
where statistical significance is important to consider. A page with 144 combinations will need a lot more 
samplings than a page with two combinations, such as what was described in the previous section, to arrive 
at statistical significance. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
124
 Fortunately, you can enable/disable variations that you may not want to be included in the test. This 
can reduce the level of samplings needed, and thereby time needed to complete the test. After you’ve made 
your selections, simply click Start Test and publish the page and any other related content items you have 
changed in the process. Thereafter, your test is live. 
 You can view the tests status and end the test similarly to what was described in the previous section. 
Specifically, note Figure  4-7 again to refresh your memory. 
 
■ Caution!   If you are an admin and you want to end tests without selecting a winner you can choose 
Marketing Control Panel ➤ Test Lab and search for the test. Below Edit you will see the  End Test link , as seen in 
Figure  4-13 . I have noticed inconsistent results with ending a test this way and I do not recommend it. 
 Figure 4-12.    You may want to  enable/disable different tests   to hone in on the specific question you’re asking       
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION
125
 Summary 
 Test everything, everywhere, all the time. That is Sitecore’s motto. This chapter walked you through some 
important considerations for testing, such as the three different types of tests, statistical significance, and 
considerations for mobile and personalization. In the end, testing is incredible easy to do; you simply 
Approve with Test! It can also be a ton of fun. If you’re the director of digital marketing, create some 
friendly rivalry by hyping up the experience optimization dashboard, highlighting your team’s efforts 
to make your site better and better, bite by bite. Give a gift card away each month to the team member 
who increased engagement value via testing the most that month. These sorts of capabilities, as well as 
culture of continuous improvement, is sure to drive a more customer centered experience, as well as 
competitive advantage.

 CHAPTER 5  
 Marketing Campaigns 
 Welcome to the chapter on  marketing campaigns ! You could describe the goals of this chapter in two 
main ways:
• 
 Understand how well your digital experiences are performing  
• 
 Automate your marketing processes to create more valuable customers    
 Most of the core “marketing”  features in Sitecore are there to drive more powerful analytics and 
insights. Page hits and geo-demographics are only so helpful. What is more compelling would be to 
understand how well your “Lenny” persona is actually aligning to your visitors. Or, are we hitting Lenny’s 
pain points more often than meeting his motivators? These sorts of detailed questions are answerable 
through the use of Sitecore’s “marketing” features, delivered out of the Marketing Control Panel. 
 I put “marketing” in quotes because things like events, failure events, goals, campaigns, and outcome 
actually have more to do with analytics when you think about it. “Big M” marketing comes into play with 
engagement plans. Engagement plans are at the heart of Sitecore’s marketing automation capabilities. 
 Engagement plans help you “nurture” a lead; they help you create more valuable customers without the 
need of human intervention. They help you take a customer with passive interest in your brand and present 
personalized experiences that move them toward being a marketing qualified lead, and even all the way to 
being a customer. 
 The possibilities are endless with engagement plans; it is truly a feature of Sitecore worth getting 
excited about. As such, the chapter begins with a theoretical discussion on the possibilities with marketing 
automation to set the tone for what is possible through the use of the concepts found in this chapter. 
 Sitecore Marketing  Automation 
 So  what  are we trying to do here? I think the best place to start a marketing automation conversation is with 
Figure  5-1 , introduced to you in Chapter   1 . As you may recall, a customer journey can be a bit schizophrenic. 
A customer may engage your brand from any multitude of channels and will likely do a lot of research before 
making a buying decision. Sitecore’s marketing automation capabilities can help you reach across all these 
channels, engage your customer with personalized, relevant, and timely content to help drive them deeper 
in your digital marketing sales funnel. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
128
 A Looking Glass and a  Rudder 
 Sitecore’s marketing automation capabilities behave a lot like a looking glass and a rudder. A ship captain 
needs to know where she’s going (looking glass) and needs a way to get there (rudder). 
 It can be near impossible to see what’s going on with your customers when you’re working across 
6-7 channels and you have tens of thousands of customer interactions a day. In this regard Sitecore’s 
marketing automation capabilities are like a looking glass, in that you can see what’s going on (powered by 
xDB analytics). You can see what actions your users are taking, all the way from downloading a whitepaper 
to something incredibly granular, such as clicking a link. You can also see what paths your customers are 
taking, as they go from one channel to the next, or from one page to another. The Federation Experience 
Manager helps us tie all customer actions across all channels into one single view of the customer. From a 
marketing perspective, this is invaluable. 
 These analytics, along with the Federation Experience Manager, will be covered in more detail in 
Chapter   7 . For now what is imperative is understand that reporting isn’t the end goal. Engagement  value 
is the end goal; we need to drive more valuable customer experiences that lead to higher revenues for our 
business. This is where automation and the rudder analogy comes in. Yes, there is a steady flow of data, but 
Sitecore gives you a rudder to steer the experience and the customer in the right direction so you get to most 
value out of every interaction as possible. 
 Tactical (t) versus Transformational (T) 
 Similarly, there are two main ways you can get started with Sitecore’s marketing automation capabilities. 
You may elect to start off tactical (t), working to employ as many events, goals, outcomes and other analytics 
across as many channels as possible to get as best a view of your customer as possible. Many in fact do start 
this way. One main benefit is most do not want to bog down their web site redesign project, for example, 
with what seems like the big unknown of marketing automation. Fortunately, many of these tactical 
strategies, when done correctly and thoroughly, form the building blocks of marketing automation, which is 
more  transformational (T). 
 Figure 5-1.    A customer’s journey is all over the place; mareketing automation can help you keep the customer 
 engaged 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
129
 Big T marketing, however, is where the true power of the Sitecore platform resides. Personalization is 
neat and helpful, but most personalization is more complicated that a simple A/B example. Big T marketing 
helps the customer through a multistage buying journey, again like we see in Figure 5-1. How do you 
get the customer from their passive interest to make a purchase? Is that as simple as just showing some 
simple personalization, such as location, demographic, or content preference personalization? For simple 
sales your digital strategy may stop at personalization, but for complex sales, personalization is only the 
beginning. If you want to move beyond tactical reporting and develop a transformational marketing strategy 
you need to start incorporating more complex automation concepts such as the ones that Sitecore provides 
in campaigns and, especially, engagement plans. 
 Tactical (t) helps you know what your customer just did, but transformational (T) helps you affect what 
your customer will do next. 
 STRATEGY BITS: MARKETING AUTOMATION IS MORE THAN JUST E-MAIL  
 Marketing automation is hot right now, finding a place on all the trend charts, and it’s a buzzword 
used at all the conferences. Yet with all the coverage, many still look at marketing automation as just 
a fancy name for e-mail marketing. While  e-mail is a major component of marketing automation, it is 
more than just a tool to manage newsletters. Marketing automation is all about managing the ever-
increasing complexity of a marketing funnel or sales cycle. It’s about creating a path of least resistance 
for the prospect to find out about your company, do the appropriate research needed to make a buying 
decision, and then ultimately convert to a customer. 
 The goal of marketing automation is to map and manage the paths that customers could take as part 
of this journey and automate steps that normally would add resistance to the buying process, or that 
wouldn’t be feasible if they had to be done manually. Marketing automation is built to help a marketing 
department get as close to one:one marketing as possible. Sure, everyone would like to customize every 
step and message for every customer and their unique situation, but scaling that to the masses is often 
impossible. 
 Understanding marketing automation starts with thinking about the goals of marketing. In very general 
terms, marketing is about generating awareness for your brand, eliciting consideration and interest 
from prospects, delivering materials to help them make the appropriate decision, and then ultimately 
propelling a prospect to convert into a customer. Once a prospect becomes a customer, marketing 
should start over and work on retaining the customer and generating future purchases through the 
marketing loop. 
 How marketing automation fits in at each of these stages depends on your company and how you plan 
your marketing, but let’s look at some of the key areas where marketing automation can be leveraged. 
 Generating Awareness 
 From branding ads, events, social media, and search marketing, the main goal of this stage is to 
get your brand in front of prospects and get them to pay attention long enough so that you can get 
permission to continue marketing to them on a personal level. Marketing automation tools at this stage 
are all about capturing information from the potentially fleeting prospect and getting them into your 
marketing funnel. 
 For example, events are a great way to get in front of a large amount of people, but too often the list 
of prospects generated gets put into excel and left to sit. Marketing automation tools, on the other 
hand, force a more structured follow-up. Imagine a prospect comes to your booth or brand experience 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
130
at an event, signs up for a contest, and opts in for messages from your company. Set up properly, 
the marketing automation system will capture that lead, tag the event as the source, and send an 
immediate thank you e-mail for signing up. If it’s a multi-day event, the system may send a follow-up 
e-mail reminding people to stop by your booth for the big drawing, or showcasing other things going 
on at the event. Following the event, the system sends out an e-mail with more information about your 
company and a couple paths that the customer can take. Using this concept, you can use lead scoring 
to help you determine their level of interest and their potential buying stage. 
 What about all those people who aren’t at the actual event, but might be following along on social 
media? As part of your campaign, you also post to appropriate social channels and offer a way for 
prospects to enter the same drawing or contest. These prospects are captured and tagged as part of the 
larger campaign, but also as non-attendees, so your can track their source. They get a slightly different 
set of follow-up e-mails because they weren’t at the event. 
 Now that all these prospects are in your funnel you can leverage marketing automation to move them 
through each stage. 
 Eliciting Consideration and Interest 
 Now that you’ve captured these prospects in the system and they have received the welcome e-mails 
and first follow-up from the event, it is time to drive interest in your product and to sort your prospects 
into groups so that you can begin tailoring messages to their level of interest and propensity to 
purchase. 
 In the follow-up e-mail, you offered the prospect an option to visit the company blog or to download a 
whitepaper. You may have also included a link to pricing or features of your product depending on what 
your sales cycle looks like. 
 Based on the action the customers took with your follow-up e-mail, you can branch your campaign out, 
using a lead scoring model to determine who is a good prospect to follow up with. Anyone who clicked 
on multiple links and visited multiple pages might be the most likely to convert at this point because their 
buying signals are the strongest. Using information that is tracked by your system, these leads are sent 
an offer to sign up for a demo or webinar, or even a deal to make a purchase. This could be sent a day or 
a week after the follow-up e-mail, all configurable and automated by your system. Prospects who visit an 
online store or sign up for a demo are obviously interested and are moved to a targeted list to convert. 
 Customers who don’t click any links or don’t fill out the form/make a purchase might still be interested 
but just aren’t ready. This branch of prospects should receive more information about your company, 
another unique use for your products, or even a customer testimonial in a follow-up message. All these 
options are focused on driving continued interest in your brand and getting a prospect ready to buy. 
 But as I said, e-mail isn’t everything. Maybe at this point you also want to send a direct mail piece 
to these prospects. Anyone who has opened the e-mails but isn’t moving to the next stage could be 
targeted to get a glossy catalog, or a coupon deal to drive traffic to your retail store. Your marketing 
automation tools could manage this list and fulfillment. 
 Decision Making 
 Customers whose actions are expressing interest by clicking e-mail links, visiting your site directly, or 
downloading materials, but aren’t converting currently have moved into the decision-making stage. 
They are interested, but there is some point of friction keeping them from taking action. It’s time to get 
serious with these prospects. At this point, it’s time to get a salesperson involved if you have them in 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
131
your organization. Marketing AUTOMATION allows this to be done automatically once your criteria is 
met. The follow-up task is generated and assigned to the sales executive and who can follow up with 
the prospect, and ultimately get the customer to convert. 
 Other prospects who have stopped clicking links, or may just read the e-mails but not take any action 
aren’t ready to make a decision and would just feel bothered by a salesperson calling them. It’s time 
to split them off into a list of prospects that have shown awareness but don’t have distinct interest. 
Maybe you’ll send them your quarterly newsletter and a few other major announcements. Until they 
start raising their hands and expressing interest again, let the system automate these customer and 
keep them in the loop. This frees up the sales executives time to focus on the best customers, while not 
letting potential future customers fall away completely. 
 Converting to a Customer 
 Whether a prospect becomes a customer on his or her own, or through the help of a sales professional, 
it’s important to attribute this conversion to the original campaign and source that drove them to your 
business so that you can track the return on investment of your marketing. It’s also time to take these 
customers out of the sales cycle so that they don’t continue to receive sales messages. Instead, they 
should be moved to your customer-focused campaigns which make sure they are receiving the level 
of quality and service you expect, as well as showing them additional items they could purchase to 
complement what they already have. 
 This is just one way to set up your marketing funnel using marketing automation. The power in 
marketing automation is about the process that takes a customer through the journey, and when you 
think about all the actions that you would have to take manually to achieve the same level of marketing, 
it becomes clear why this buzzword is picking up steam.

 Sitecore Marketing Building Blocks 
 Events, failure events, goals, outcomes, campaigns, engagement plans, and taxonomies are the building 
blocks of Sitecore’s marketing automation platform. The following sections discusses each, including when 
they are used and how you can get started using them. 
 Events, Failure Events, and Goals 
 Events, failure events, and goals are all customer behaviors recorded by Sitecore during a customer’s journey 
across your channels. Events, failure events, and goals are amazingly more valuable from an analytics 
perspective then, say, page clicks or other pretty, yet rather useless, data you might get in Google Analytics 
without customization. The reason events, failure events, and goals are so important to a marketer is 
twofold: 1) they can be tied directly to your user personas, and 2) they track occurrences  and value. 
 Recall Lenny, the persona from Chapter   3 . Personas are great because they help us capture a set of 
behaviors, preferences, goals, and all sorts of other characteristics into a single, fictitious character (like Lenny) 
to help us understand and prioritize what our digital experience ought to be doing for our customers. In 
the case of Lenny, you can see in Figure  5-2 that we’ve captured his motivators, goals, pain points, and 
alignment to business objectives (among a lot of other, less applicable characteristics). Notice however 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
132
how motivators are things Lenny comes to the site to do. I like to think of motivators as events; they are 
things Lenny does when he engages with our brand. Events help us track and measure how well our digital 
experiences are meeting Lenny’s needs. 
 Goals are a bit different than events, in that goals are what  we want Lenny to do. Sometimes what 
your customer wants to do is not what you want them to do. Lenny is a good example. He is coming to the 
experience to find information and to research policies. However, we want him not just to consume content, 
but to become a customer. As such our goals for him are to get him to convert. Goals, therefore, tend to have 
a higher value than events because we always want every customer going deeper down the funnel (and not 
just kicking the tires, as is the case of events). 
 Failure events  , or in the case of Lenny, pain points, are things Lenny hates. Yes, you should track in your 
digital experiences where you are letting your customers down. Are you creating experiences that work well 
for one persona, but poorly for another? If you don’t track failure events against your persona’s pain points 
you’ll never know the answer to this question. When you are tracking failure events, you may conclude that 
separate experiences are needed to create highly specific experiences tailored to a given persona to match 
their buying behavior as closely as possible. 
 Secondly, events, failure events, and goals are far superior to simple page hit counts because they can 
help you track  value . Not every interaction means as much to your business as another. Is it twice as valuable 
for a customer to register for a webinar as to download a whitepaper? If so, don’t treat them equally. 
 Figure 5-2.    Your user personas should have a platform persepctive, incorporating events, goals, and failure 
events in the form of  motivators, goals, and pain points 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
133
 This is one of the best features of Sitecore; namely, that you can attribute Engagement Value scores onto 
each of these—events, failure events, and goals. I don’t mean to take away Chapter   7 ’s thunder here, but 
the timing is too important. Look at Figure  5-3 , how we see a measure of number of hits to the site and their 
corresponding Engagement Values. This way, in combination with events, failure events, and goals, you can 
set out to create strategies that drive Engagement Value (make your experiences better) and separately set 
out to drive more hits (such as pay-per-click campaigns).   
 Value is an important point to think carefully about. You shouldn’t be too quick to throw out value 
assignments to your goals, failure events, and events. The number is less relevant than that assignment’s 
relation to other assignments. 
 For example, is an event registration twice as valuable to your business as a whitepaper download? If 
so, perhaps the Event Registration goal receives a value score of 10, while the Whitepaper Download event 
receives a value score of 5. Would you prefer one customer request a product demo over 10 customers 
register for an event? If so, perhaps you should assign the Request a Demo goal to a value of 100. Does a 
subscription cancelation represent a loss of a customer? If so, perhaps this failure event should receive a 
value score of -100. 
 In this way it is important to create a hierarchy across all persona events, failure events, and goals ahead 
of time so you can agree on  scoring options . A simple matrix with the following columns serves best to align 
on this deliverable:
• 
 Name 
• 
 Type (event, failure event, and goal) 
• 
 Value 
• 
 Persona (multiselect) 
• 
 Description

■ Note  More on analytics in Chapter   7 , but for now it’s important to know that all of these events, failure 
events, and goals can be viewed from a customer’s experience profile for future reporting. 
 Use the following steps to create an event or a failure event:
 
 1. 
 Navigate to the Content Editor and find the Page Events node under System ➤ 
Settings ➤ Analytics ➤ Page Events. 
 
■ Note Alternatively, others prefer to create page events in the Marketing Control Panel below the Goals 
node. They intermix goals and events. In many ways this is preferable, but an administrator will need to edit the 
insert options of the Goals node to allow page events to be created there; otherwise, only admins can create 
them there. As such, the standard place for page events is demonstrated in these steps. Check out the steps to 
create a goal to see where to create your page events if you want to follow this best practice. 
 
 2. 
 Create a new Page Event Category (right-click Page Events, Insert) for your site 
below Page Events, such as Launchcore. 
 
 3. 
 Right-click your category and insert new a page event.  
 
 4. 
 Provide a name and a point value (Engagement Value score). 
 
 5. 
 Scroll down on the settings and note the following settings that you may or may 
not want to configure:
• 
 Is Failure —Selecting this marks the event as a failure event  
• 
 Show in Events —Selecting this ensure this event appears on a user profile report 
(it is associated to the profile regardless, but you may want it to display on the 
profile by default) 
• 
 Track as Latest Events —Similar to Show in Events 
 
 6. 
 When your event is complete, below the Home tab click Edit ➤ Deploy to publish 
your event. 
 Notice in Figure  5-4 there’s a customer event called View Best Practice. This event can be used to report 
on our customer’s consuming information that you consider to be a best practice.   

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
135
 Use the following steps to create a new  goal :
 
 1. 
 Goals are administered from the Marketing Control Panel, so navigate there from 
your Launchpad. 
 
 2. 
 Expand the Goals node; this is where you will create your goals.  
 
 3. 
 Create a Goal category by right-clicking the Goals node ➤ Insert Goal Category. 
Provide a category name that aligns with your site or digital property name.  
 
 4. 
 Create a new goal below your category by right-clicking your category and 
choosing Insert. Provide an appropriate goal name.  
 
 5. 
 Skip the classification section for now (goal properties). See the section on 
Taxonomies later in this chapter to understand how you can categorize your 
goals in reports. 
 
 6. 
 Confirm the goal name and then provide an Engagement Value to the Points 
property. 
 
 7. 
 When complete, click Edit below the Home tab, and then click Deploy to publish 
your goal. 
 With your events, failure events, and goals created it is a very simple process to get those assigned to 
pages within Sitecore so they are getting logged. Note also that goals can be logged as a result of a form 
submission (such as requested to download a whitepaper). Form submitted goals are discussed in Chapter   6  . 
For page events and goals, see Figures  5-5 and  5-6 . Under the Optimization tab within the Experience Editor 
 Figure 5-4.  You can create  custom events and failure events to measure how your personas are actually 
interacting with your digital experiences. Don’t guess; know! 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
136
you will notice a Goals button (Figure  5-5 ) and an Attributes button (Figure  5-6 ). The Goals button is where 
you can select which goals are triggered as a result of the user visiting that page. The Attributes tab has a 
bit more going on, with tabs for Campaigns, Events, Failure Actions, and Settings. The Events and Failure 
Actions tabs are applicable in the case of our events and failure events. Simply check the events, failure 
events, and goals you deem appropriate for that page and click OK (along with Publish, etc.).   
 Figure 5-5.     Goals   can be registered to a page with just a few simple clicks 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
137
 
■ Note  Events, failure events, and goals can also be triggered programmatically. In most cases, page level 
events and goals are entirely sufficient. However, sometimes it is more appropriate for them to be triggered 
in code, such as in response to a button click or some other interaction with a customization. Check out this 
helpful blog post for more details on how to do this programmatically:   http://bit.ly/1CFvPiC 
 Outcomes 
 Outcomes are used to track the lifelong value a particular customer is to your business overtime. An 
outcome in its most basic form is just a tag on the customer’s profile. That tag name can be whatever you 
want it to be and it can represent whatever you want it to represent. Typically, outcomes represent some 
combination of events, goals, and/or campaign interactions. 
 For example, you may have goals around social media sharing. Perhaps a customer is sharing a lot of 
your content on social media and has reached 10 “shares”. In this case, you may use this milestone to tag that 
customer with the “Promoter” outcome so you can segment your promoters for an e-mail campaign down 
the road, such as a new product launch. 
 Figure 5-6.  Likewise, events can easily be registered to a page 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
138
 
■ Tip  Outcomes can also be used for content personalization. Search for “outcome” in the Rules dialog to 
find the “where the user has registered the outcome during any interaction” rule that you can apply to your 
personalization condition. 
 You can create custom outcomes from the Marketing Control Panel, below the Outcomes node 
(Figure  5-7 ). You first will create the outcome type, followed by the outcomes themselves below the type. 
This hierarchy helps with organization and reporting purposes. 
 There are three out-of-the-box outcomes in Launch Sitecore you can use, including:
• 
 Identification
• 
 Contact Acquisition 
• 
 Purchase
• 
 Purchase Product 
• 
 Lead Management Funnel (Figure  5-7 )
• 
 Marketing Lead 
• 
 Sales Lead 
• 
 Opportunity 
• 
 Close Cancelled 
• 
 Close Lost 
• 
 Close Won 
 Figure 5-7.    Create custom outcomes to track the financial value of a customer to your business over time 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
139
 Again, with outcomes tagged on customer profiles, it would be easy to retrieve all marketing qualified 
leads if you are tagging customers to marketing lead when, say they register to download a whitepaper on 
the heels of an e-mail blast. 
 When you create a new outcome, you’ll notice the Monetary Value Applicable checkbox. This 
signifies that this particular outcome is also used to track a financial value of the customer. For example, 
if the customer purchases a digital camera off your web site, you could tag that purchase with a “Camera 
Enthusiast” outcome along with the monetary value of the purchase. Simply reporting then could sell 
you the total value across the life of the customer, assuming all purchases are being reported (see more in 
Chapter   7  on outcome analytics). 
 So you have all your outcomes created, but then what? What actually gets the outcome associated to the 
customer’s user profile? Unfortunately outcomes can only be registered programmatically, since they are 
usually never the result of one event or page request. To read about how to register an outcome, check out 
this helpful article:   http://bit.ly/1LSHujt . 
 Campaigns 
 A lot of people, when they think of Sitecore campaigns, are thinking of marketing automation through 
the use of Engagement Plans (see the next section). Rather, campaigns are tools to help you drive better 
analytics; analytics tied to a marketing campaign that might be a one off, or perhaps organized in another 
solution such as dynamics marketing. 
 Campaigns in Sitecore tie a set of behaviors in a digital experience to a campaign. For example, you may 
have a Google AdWords purchase driving clicks to your web site. Wouldn’t it be good to calculate the ROI of 
that AdWords investment? Sitecore campaigns can help you calculate that ROI because you can associate 
each visitor coming from that AdWords campaign to that campaign. From an analytics perspective this will 
help you determine, on average, how much Engagement Value is created for that AdWords campaign. If you 
are savvy with your Engagement Value planning, you’ll understand how many points of value correspond to 
a dollar’s revenue, and thereby you can calculate ROI on a marketing campaign. It’s pretty cool stuff, despite 
it being embarrassingly simple to configure. It’s so simple you begin to feel a bit let down, like there should 
be more to it than that, but again, check out the next section on Engagement Plans to satisfy that thirst for 
marketing automation. 
 
■ Note  With the release of Sitecore 8.1 a new tool is available called the ‘ Campaign Creator ’ you can use to 
create and manage campaigns. The steps below however are still applicable, but this new UI might be worth 
familiarizing yourself with. Unfortunately the timing of this book going to print did not afford an exhaustive 
update to this section. 
 You can configure a campaign much the same way you do a goal or event. Use the following steps to 
create a campaign:
 
 1. 
 Go to the Marketing Control Panel from the Launchpad.  
 
 2. 
 You may have hundreds of campaigns over time, so it’s a good idea to create 
some campaign categories to help you organize them. Do this by right-clicking 
Campaigns, and choosing Insert ➤ Campaign Category. Give the category a name.  
 
 3. 
 Below your Category insert a new Campaign (right-click, choose Insert ➤ 
Category) and give it an appropriate name. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
140
 
 4. 
 There are several categories of properties you should pay special attention to:
 a. 
 Classification —See the section on taxonomies later in this chapter to help 
you categorize your reporting data. This may be necessary if you have 
hundreds of campaigns. 
 b. 
 Data 
 Title —The name of the campaign 
 Campaign Link —This is the most important of all properties (see Figure  5-9 ) 
since it is what associates the visit to this campaign 
 Type —Mostly used for additional reporting segmentation 
 Enroll in Engagement Plan —see the Engagement Plan section coming up 
next. For now it is important to understand that a visit coming in from a 
campaign can be set to automatically enroll that user in an Engagement Plan.  
 c. 
 Traffic Type —Used to again provide richer reporting/analytics, in case you 
want to filter data on its source (e.g., search engine vs. direct vs. e-mail).  
 d. 
 Duration —You may want to apply a start/end date, again for analytics purposes 
 e. 
  Cost —You may want to add cost reporting into your analytics. For example, 
if you are using Google AdWords pay-per-click at a fixed cost of $.25/click, 
you could enter that cost into the Cost per Click property. In doing so you 
can see analytics showing campaign visits, the value from those visits, and 
the cost of those visits. All very handy to see. 
 A good example campaign might be a request to drive more of your product demos. You might set up a 
Google or Facebook pay-per-click program to drive more visits to your site and an appropriate landing page. 
You’re hoping that when they visit the landing page they will fill out the form to request a demo, but you’ll 
also present other calls to action to try to get as much engagement value out of the campaign as possible. 
 When you enter the URL into Google or Facebook ad programs, you want to add the  sc_camp attribute 
onto the end of the URL, as seen in Figure  5-8 . This associates that visitor to your campaign, and thereby all 
the analytics you need to calculate the ROI of the campaign. 
 Figure 5-8.  Associate a  landing page to a campaign by adding the campaign ID in the query string. Now all 
future engagement will be associated with that campaign, helping you track ROI 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
141
 
■ Note  Campaigns will only be associated with the visit if the visit’s first page has this value in the URL and 
no other campaigns are already associated. If the visitor already browsed a few of your pages and then found a 
link with this in the URL, the association would not be made because it wasn’t in the URL on the landing page 
they entered the experience through. The campaign must start on the landing page (you can get around this 
programmatically if you are so inclined). 
 Engagement Plans 
 Engagement Plans are the core building block of Sitecore’s marketing automation engine. Engagement Plans 
might be better named “engagement workflows” because they behave just like you’d expect a workflow to. 
An Engagement Plan can have one ore many “states”. A customer can be assigned into an Engagement Plan 
and into one of those states. Most Engagements Plans have a start and end state, such as the case when you 
are trying to sequentially move the customer through a sales funnel, for example. However, the states need 
not be sequential and a customer can be assigned to any state as their first state. It depends on your business 
requirements. 
 The point is, Engagement Plans help you  move your customer from one state to another; where the goal 
is to advance them toward a more desirable state. This often results in an outcome that you’re trying to help 
the customer achieve. The following is an example of a sequence of  events you could automate through the 
help of an Engagement Plan.
 
 1. 
 An unknown user downloads a whitepaper, prompting them to register. 
 
 2. 
 He is then entered into an Engagement Plan, in a state called “Passive interest in 
XYZ Product”. 
 
 3. 
 Personalization drives content for users in that state. That content drives him 
toward an Event Registration. 
 Figure 5-9.  Simply insert the Campaign link into the URL 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
142
 
 4. 
 He registers for the event, progressing his state to “Definitely Interested 
in XYZ Product”. 
 
 5. 
 An e-mail campaign targets customers in the Definitely state. The campaign 
presents a call to action to register for a demo.  
 
 6. 
 The customer responds to the call to action, progressing his state to Considering 
a Purchase. 
 
 7. 
 After the demo, the customer never makes a purchase. 
 
 8. 
 The next time he visits the site, personalization offers a 20% discount for 
customers considering a purchase, since 10 days as elapsed since the demo.  
 
 9. 
 The customer uses the coupon to purchase the product and is unenrolled from 
the Engagement Plan. 
 This workflow is a snap to automate in Sitecore with an Engagement Plan. You could create the e-mail 
campaigns from a third-party solution, but you would have a bugger of a time driving the personalization 
on the web site. This is a competitive advantage for Sitecore; your e-mail marketing and digital experience 
content can both be working together to create marketing generated leads across all channels, versus 
needing to develop a one-off strategy for each channel. 
 Engagement Plans can be viewed from the Engagement Plans node within the Marketing Control 
Panel (Figure  5-10 ). They are very easy to configure a well; Sitecore provides an intuitive drag-and-drop like 
experience to configure the flow. Square shapes represent states, and diamond shapes represent conditions. 
You can see an example Engagement Plan design surface in Figure  5-11 . The design surface is loaded when 
you click the Design button in the middle of the screen, near Options. 
 Figure 5-10.    Engagement Plans are where you automate your marketing strategies through the configuration 
of simple  marketing workflows         
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
143
 
■ Note  The Engagement Plans use Silverlight for their rendering. For best results, use Firefox or 
Internet Explorer.  
 The Supervise  button opens a view (Figure  5-12 ) that allows you to see how many contacts are enrolled 
in the Engagement Plan, as well as which states they fall into. Perhaps there is a bottleneck in your plan and 
you need more personalization rules to help customers advance to the next stage faster. Additionally, if a 
customer is stuck, you can manually move that customer by clicking the Move button. Or, you can add a 
new contact manually into the Engagement Plan as well with the help of the Add button.   
 Figure 5-11.    The Engagement Plan workflow designer is a simple-to-use, drag-and-drop  experience         
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
144
 The Monitor button looks very similar to the Supervise button, except it is in a read-only view. 
Engagement Plans are a rather elaborate configuration process, and are covered later in this chapter in the 
section called “Creating Your First Engagement Plan”. 
 Taxonomies 
 You may have noticed we skipped over the Classification settings in our Goals and Campaigns. Classification 
properties help you segment your goals and campaigns for reporting purposes. The reality is you may have 
hundreds of campaigns, and perhaps many hundreds of goals over time. Tracking all this can be impossible 
without some basic organization. Enter  taxonomies . 
 In the Marketing Operations Panel, you’ll notice the very first node is the Taxonomies node. You can 
configure metadata below the Taxonomies node that you can associate to groups and campaigns to help 
filter them in reporting. The following are all examples of things you can configure below taxonomies:
• 
 Campaign Groups —Campaign Groups are the most basic form of categorization 
for campaigns. An example of a group might be “Product Launch - Thingy,” where 
you want to associate the engagement value from across 12 different campaigns to 
show the effectiveness/ROI across the entire group of campaigns for the upcoming 
product launch. Campaign Groups can be created below the Taxonomies ➤ 
Campaign Groups node and assigned to Campaigns by selecting them in the 
Campaign Groups Classification property. 
  Figure 5-12.    Reporting is available in an Engagement Plan to see the percentage of customers that are in each 
state, as well as the total number of customers enrolled in the plan 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
145
• 
 Group Categories —Group categories are not as sophisticated as campaign groups 
but still serve the same purpose. Groups have a property called Category that is a 
free-form text box you can use to again filter group reporting.  
• 
 Channel — Channel effectiveness is another important facet when reporting on the 
ROI of your campaigns. Campaigns can be tagged with a channel by setting the 
Channel property. Fortunately there are already just about every channel you could 
image pre-configured in taxonomies (Figure  5-13 ). 
 Figure 5-13.    Tag your campaigns to channels to help understand which channels are performing best 
• 
 Asset Types —There may be times where you want to associate campaigns and 
goals to assets types, such as Video or Best Practice or Instruction Manual. Perhaps 
driving customers to best practices drives more ROI than driving them to instruction 
manuals. Tagging in this regard can help answer these questions. To tag a goal 
or campaign to an asset, simply set the Marketing Asset property of the goal or 
campaign. Sample tags can be seen in Figure  5-14 . 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
146
• 
 Facets —Facets exist because Sitecore doesn’t know what else you may be interested 
in filtering on in your reports. Perhaps what you need is a Product Category field or 
a Region. The possibilities are endless, so Sitecore threw its hands up and created 
generalizable “facets” you can rename. In the example in Figure  5-15 , Facet 1 is 
known (tribal knowledge) to refer to Region and Facet 2 is known to refer to Product 
Category. Note how in Figure  5-15 how we’ve created some Custom Taxons below 
each  facet  to start building out the possible values. When you right-click the facet 
and choose Insert, you’ll notice you can create Taxons and Taxon Groups below 
the facet (groups can be used for organization if you have dozens or hundreds of 
possible taxons). 
  Figure 5-14.  Assets , too, can be a helpful metric to report against 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
147
 That concludes the discussion on taxonomies, but remember the real value of them is in the data. 
Check out Chapter   7 for a continuation of this discussion when we dig into xDB and Sitecore analytics. 
 Creating Your First Engagement Plan 
 Engagement Plans deserve special elaboration for a couple of reasons. First, they are at the core of Sitecore’s 
marketing automation capabilities. Secondly, many of the other building blocks, including goals and 
campaigns, work in tandem with engagement plans because by creating an Engagement Plan you are 
working with all the building blocks discussed earlier. As such they are great at bringing it all together. 
 Since Engagement Plans are so important we’ll create one, step by step. We’ll also use a real-world 
example to help demonstrate the concept. The setting is the healthcare insurance industry. An insurer 
wants to better target and nurture leads through the process of applying for Medicare insurance. As you can 
guess, Medicare is a “complex sale” and requires a lot of hand-holding to get a lead to become a customer. 
However, they just didn’t have the manpower to nurture every lead. Instead, they turned to Sitecore’s 
Engagement Plans to help them automate most of the interactions. 
 Figure 5-15.  When in doubt, use custom facets to extend your campaign reporting into almost limitless 
directions 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
148
 Here are the  states  of customers as they progressed through the digital funnel:
• 
 Passive interest in Medicare —This may be a customer browsing the site and getting 
tagged to a persona known to be interested in Medicare, or less ambitious goals, 
such as downloading whitepaper or subscribing to a newsletter. These all signify 
some interest in acquiring insurance. 
• 
 Qualified interest in Medicare —When a visitor registers for a Medicare event or 
webinar, this is catalyst to market them as qualified interest. 
• 
 Researching plans —Researching plans is the next state. These customers are “hot 
leads” because they are actively comparing plan options, ripe for a sales associate to 
help them make a decision. 
• 
 Application initiated —These are visitors who have applied, pending application 
acceptance. They can still drop out and therefore need continued nurturing.    
 Our goal as marketers is to get these potential customers through the digital funnel as quickly as 
possible with as little human involvement as possible. Because of the volume of leads and limited human 
capital, it is the only way. 
 Let’s begin by creating a new Engagement Plan with these four states. Later we’ll add the rules/
conditions/actions that facilitate the visitor moving from one state to another. Use the following steps to 
create these four empty states:
 
 1. 
 Right-click Engagement Plans node from within the Marketing Operations Panel 
and choose Insert ➤ Engagement Plan. Provide a name, such as “Medicare 
Nurture Program”. 
 
 2. 
 Click Design below Options to launch the Engagement Plan designer surface. 
 
 3. 
 In the Ribbon within the Designer, note the New Items category. Click the square 
State new item to add a new state to the surface. 
 
 4. 
 Double-click the state to launch the state’s properties. Provide an appropriate 
state name and description, such as can be seen in Figure  5-16 . 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
149
 
 5. 
 Next we need to repeat Steps 1-4 for the other states. However, states are 
separated by conditions. To add a condition, hover over the state and click the 
diamond icon that appears below the state after you hover, as seen in Figure  5-17 . 
 Figure 5-17.  When you hover over a state you’re prompted to add conditions, as noted by the  diamond 
simbles . Alternatively, you can drag the circle symbol onto an existing condition to make the connection 
 Figure 5-16.  You can add a new state to your Engagement Plan by clicking the State square  icon 
 
 6. 
 After you click the diamond icon a  condition element will appear below the state. 
Do this same process until all four of your states are created separated by three 
conditions, as can be seen in Figure  5-18 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
150
 
■ Note You were expecting three conditions, but a fourth was needed because a contact can go from passive 
interest straight into “ Researching Plans ” without needing to register for an event first. As such, a duplicate 
condition is needed since it is a 1:1 relationship between states and conditions. Additionally, we’ll configure a 
fifth in a bit used to send friendly reminders to customers “stuck” in the qualified state (been in the state >7 days), 
nudging them to keep progressing. 
 To finish our Engagement Plan we need to configure the following  components :
• 
 Triggers —Triggers are what the state is waiting for before it evaluates whether the 
customer can move to the next state or not. Triggers are either events or goals, like 
what we configured earlier. Simply check which events and goals the state will 
“listen” for. Triggers are configured on the state.  
• 
 Rules —After one of those events or goals has fired, rules can be set up to check if the 
customer is ready to move to the next state. Rules are configured on conditions.  
  Figure 5-18.  A sample Engagement Plan that nurtures a lead 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
151
• 
 Actions —Actions fire if a rule evaluates true. Actions might be sending e-mails, creating 
leads in your CRM, or any number of custom actions you might dream up. There are 
several out-of-the-box actions you can use right away (Figure  5-19 ). The 0 indicator on 
a condition indicates how many actions have been assigned to that condition.  
 Let’s begin by configuring triggers first, and then rules, and lastly actions. Use the following steps as a 
guide to configuring triggers. 
 
 7. 
 The first trigger we need to configure is on the Passive Interest state. This state 
is waiting for either the Event Registration goal to fire, or the Comparing Plans 
goal to fire. Click Trigger on the state and select those two goals (or others as 
applicable). Click OK. 
 
 8. 
  The Qualified Interest state is waiting for the customer to start comparing plans. 
As such we’ll configure a trigger similarly as described in Step 7 to wait for the 
Comparing Plans goal to fire. 
 
 9. 
  Lastly, the Researching Plans state is waiting for the Application Initiated goal to 
fire. Configure that trigger similar to the other states in the previous two steps. 
 Now all the states are waiting for the right things to happen before confirming all conditions are met. 
Assuming all conditions are met, the customer will move into the next state of the Engagement Plan. Since 
goals/events fire all the time, you probably want to set up some rules to validate it’s appropriate for the 
customer to progress. 
 Figure 5-19.  These are the  out-of-the-box actions you can add to your Engagement Plans. However, it is also 
easy to add your own actions to this list for more advanced scenarios 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
152
 
■ Note There is a “where true” rule you can use to send the customer through to the next state. Since a rule 
is a required field, use this rule when you don’t want one. 
 
 10. 
 Click the condition after the first state (“did they register for an event…”) and then 
click Edit to launch the Condition Properties window. 
 
 11. 
 First you need to specify when you want this rule to evaluate using the following 
as a guide. Select Always Evaluate. Since we are not configuring a timeout the 
other two are not applicable.
 a. 
 Always Evaluate —Evaluate the rule regardless if it was the result of a goal 
firing or a timeout expiration 
 b. 
 Only Evaluate on Timeout —Helpful when you want to wait a set number of 
days before evaluating if the rule is true 
 c. 
 Only Evaluate for Subscribed Events —Only as a result of goals or events 
firing 
 
 12. 
 Second, configure the rule itself. Click the Edit  Rule   link within the Condition 
Properties window. Then, search for “goal” and set it to evaluate against the goal 
you are waiting for, as seen in Figure  5-20 . 
 Figure 5-20.    Rules are evaluated to determine if the customer should advance to the next state in the 
Engagement Plan, or remain in the current state       
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
153
 
 13. 
 The “are they comparing plans” conditions/rules are configured similarly to the 
“did they register for an event” condition/rule, except they are evaluating against 
a different goal. 
 
 14. 
 The “Time spent in state >7 days” condition is a bit different, however. Notice it’s 
configuration in Figure  5-21 . We want the rule to Always Evaluate, because if the 
timeout hasn’t expired we want the second condition to check for the Comparing 
Plans goal. Otherwise, we could use the Only Evaluate on Timeout setting. The 
rule itself is simple; just check if the timeout has expired or not.    
 Figure 5-21.    Another helpful rule—wait until a period of time has expired before evaluating. This is helpful 
when you want to  target customers “stuck” in a less desirable state 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
154
 
 15. 
 Next we need to actually configure the  timeout  . If seven days have gone by, we 
want to fire the trigger to evaluate the condition. Simply click the arrow at the 
bottom-right side of the state and enter 7 days, as shown in Figure  5-22 . 
 Figure 5-22.  Set the timeout before the rule is evaluated 
 
■ Note If the rule does not pass, the customer will stay in the current state until the goal is fired again and 
the rule will be tested again. This will happen perpetually until the rule evaluates true. 
 That does it for the conditions and rule. Next we need to configure actions. Again, actions are optional 
things that can happen as the customer is moved from one state to another. For example, you could send the 
customer an e-mail if he has been sitting in the “qualified” state for more than seven days. Use the following 
steps to configure a simple action: 
 
 16. 
 Click on the 0 number next to the Yes to show the Actions dialog (Figure  5-23 ). 
 Figure 5-23.  When you click the 0 next to the condition the Actions  dialog will appear, allowing you to add 
actions that fire after the condition has been met

 17. 
 Click Add in the Actions dialog and then find and select the Send E-Mail Message 
action. Double-click the action to add it to the list. 
 
■ Note Current Visitor’s Email Address is the default address that will be used, that of the currently logged 
on user who’s enrolled in the Engagement Plan. You can change this value to Fixed Email Address if you need to 
specify a static address. 
 
 18. 
 Double-click the e-mail action again to load the e-mail properties dialog. Fill out 
all the properties and click OK. 
 
■ Note Unfortunately, you cannot use dynamic tokens in e-mails out-of-the-box, such as the customer’s 
name, which is dependent on context. Fortunately however, a fantastic member of the Sitecore community 
found a way to extend this e-mail action to accommodate tokens, thus allowing for more personalized, context 
sensitive e-mails. Check it out here:   http://bit.ly/1GXqFm6 . 
 The last step in creating the Engagement Plan is to deploy it so it can be used.  
 
 19. 
 On the Home Tab, below Edit, click Deploy 
 Now your Engagement Plan is ready for prime time! However, we still have a couple important steps to 
consider. Namely, how do we get visitors into the Engagement Plan in the first place? As a reminder, there 
are three main ways:
• 
 When they are associated with a  campaign — Campaigns have an Enroll in 
Engagement Plan property. Enrolling visits into an Engagement Plan is as simple as 
setting which plan and which state you want them enrolled into from this property. 
Note, however, that only known, logged-in contacts can be added to a plan so your 
campaign is limited to authenticated scenarios (such as driving the customer into 
their shopping cart, where you know they’ll need to log in first). 
• 
 When they fill out a Web Forms for  marketers form — You’ll see how easy it is to create 
forms in Chapter   6 . Forms can have actions too, and there’s an out-of-the-box action 
to enroll the contact into an Engagement Plan. The nice thing with this is that could 
be a new contact, such as someone who just registered to download a whitepaper 
and gave us their contact information. 
• 
 When a  goal fires —Wouldn’t it be nice if when a goal fires you could add the contact 
into an engagement plan just like you can with campaigns? Sadly out-of-the-box you 
can’t, however the  Launchcore.net codebase has a goal rule in the solution you can 
steal! Just have your developer download that source from   http://launchcore.net 
and copy that code into your solution so you can do the same. See Figure 5-20 for 
what that would look like. 
• 
 Programmatically —You tap into the API to enable all other scenarios. For the 
Medicare example this was the chosen path because we wanted contacts assigned to 
a persona to be registered into the Engagement Plan. This was achieved by tying into 
the pipeline and adding this extra step. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
156
 The last and final step in configuring your Engagement Plan is to remove the customer, at some point, 
from the plan itself. In the Medicare example, this is either when the application is approved, when sales 
receives confirmation of a loss, or when an opt-out is received from an e-mail, signifying the loss. 
 Upon approval of the application, it’s best to programmatically remove the user from the plan. In 
the case of the sales representative getting confirmation of the loss, that rep can log in to Sitecore and 
“supervise” the plan, find that contact, and remove them. Or, more preferably, you tie into an action in their 
CRM and remove the contact programmatically to make it  much  easier. This would likewise be similar for an 
opt-out response. 
 Basically, the  programmatic removes is the only practical approach. For this example, that’s true, but for 
yours, not necessarily. See the example extended in Figure  5-24 . An Engagement Plan can remove users itself 
if you tell it to with the Remove Contact action. You can use this action as an out-of-the-box way to remove 
contacts from an Engagement Plan. 
  Figure 5-24.    Don’t forget to remove customers from your engagement plans or the reporting will be less 
meaningful over time       
 Email Experience Manager 
 The  Email Experience Manager (EXM)  is a great solution for small or medium sized businesses for e-mail 
delivery. You can send hundreds or thousands of e-mails through EXM at a time. EXM can be configured to 
use Sitecore’s hosted delivery service, or you can configure your own delivery servers to facilitate the e-mail 
delivery. You need to be licensed to use Sitecore’s hosted delivery service, and it can be accessed from the 
Launchpad ➤ App Center ➤ Email Delivery. 
 
■ Note  EXM is one of the biggest areas of investment by Sitecore in 2015/16. Today it is an “up and comer” 
best suited for small businesses (thousands of recipients, not millions). Its coverage is limited in this book, 
knowing the content will quickly be out of date by early 2016. Stay tuned on  sitecore.net for product updates 
and  sitecoreconfig.com for my personal EXM blog updates. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
157
 You access EXM from the Launchpad. It requires a separate download/install (download can be found 
here:   http://bit.ly/1INGdal ). When you first open EXM you’ll be on the dashboard showing e-mail 
performance for past e-mails, as well as a left pane for more options. The large Create button, as seen in 
Figure  5-25 , can be used to create new messages. 
 E-mails are created from lists of contacts. Lists are managed in the List Manager, separately accessed 
again from the Launchpad. Typically, you might buy a list of contacts in a CSV file that you would upload 
to the list manager to drive your e-mails. Often you also will manage your own lists. For example, when a 
customer fills out a form on your site, you may want to at that time add them into a list to enroll them in an 
e-mail campaign, such as a weekly newsletter. You will be asked to select which list of e-mail addresses you 
want to use on the Recipients tab on the new e-mail creation wizard, as seen in Figure  5-26 . 
 Figure 5-25.    You can create one-time messages, subscription  messages such as newletters, or triggered 
messages as a result of a goal completion 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
158
 The Message tab (Figure  5-26 ) is where you draft your e-mail message. The tab features a rich text 
editor. Also, you can toggle which campaign you want the e-mail associated with, which language your 
message is in, and as you can see in Figure  5-26 , there are Message Actions allowing you to add an 
attachment, save as a template, edit the Engagement Plan, or duplicate the message. 
 When EXM sends a message all respondents are entered into a rather elaborate Engagement Plan to 
track their response. You can see this Engagement Plan in Figure  5-27 , and you can edit it to your liking from 
the Message Actions menu discussed previously. Enrolling recipients into a fully customizable Engagement 
Plan gives you full flexibility as to how your want to engage those on the list; taking their interactions with 
your brand hopefully well beyond just an e-mail message.    
 Figure 5-26.  The new  message wizard is very easy to use. Simply specify your list, enter the message content, 
deliver the message, and await the analytics 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ MARKETING CAMPAIGNS

 Summary 
 This chapter was all about analytics when you think about it. The chapter was about knowing what is 
happening in your digital experiences. Are your customers finding them helpful? Are they performing 
according to your expectations, or are there areas that need to be improved? Tracking events, failure events, 
goals, campaigns, and outcomes provide these insights. With all these being tracked, we’ll see in Chapter   7 
these data points come to life—a chapter exclusively on analytics. 
 Beyond analytics however, is a concept called “marketing automation”. It’s all the buzz these days. 
Events, goals, and so on, form the foundation of automation, but Engagement Plans are the basis of that 
automation. Engagement Plans send your customers through a workflow, where you’re trying to get them to 
be an ever more valuable customer. You can use targeted content personalization to “nudge” the customer 
to take that next step, and progress through your plan for them. 
 Finally, this chapter concluded with a short tutorial of the Email Experience Manager (EXM). EXM is 
a great tool you can use to deliver newsletters or one-off e-mail blasts. A lot more functionality is coming 
to EXM over the coming year and it is a great area of Sitecore to keep your eyes on for new features and 
capabilities.

the message is delivered

 CHAPTER 6  
 Web Forms for Marketers 
 Well here we go, yet another highly touted Sitecore module, Web Forms for Marketers ( WFFM for short). 
WFFM helps a marketer do what marketers often do the most when it comes to digital experiences. 
WFFM makes it easy to set up lead capture pages. Are you creating an e-mail campaign through the Email 
Experience Manager (as discussed in Chapter   5 ), but you want to link that customer to a digital experience 
where you hope to capture some data and a lead? This is a  great  use case for WFFM. Do you want a small 
Download Now button on your home page connected to a text box asking the users to enter their e-mail 
address? Yet another creative WFFM use case. Do you want to ask a developer for help every single time you 
want to collect an e-mail address? Oh heck no! 
 Now, WFFM has certainly many uses beyond simple lead capture. You can use WFFM for user 
registration forms, event registration forms, blog commenting forms, and so on and so forth. These are more 
common developer use cases, since what marketer wants to configure the registration process? None, I bet. 
There are countless practical uses for WFFM. However, lead capture has a special place in a marketer’s heart 
and so it’s an important use case to highlight. 
 WFFM forms are simple to create. Simply create a page (or add one to an existing page), add the WFFM 
component to that page, configure the fields you want to gather, and tell WFFM what to do with that data 
once it’s submitted.  Very simple indeed! 
 As you have guessed by now, this chapter teaches you how to apply oil to your elbow—or should I say 
create simple, effective, and ROI-laden marketing forms. It’s so easy! 
 Overview of Web Forms for Marketers 
 WFFM is fundamentally just another  component you add to a page and configure. Like other components, 
you must first add the component to a placeholder’s allow controls setting before you can add a WFFM form 
onto a page. Thereafter, you will notice an Edit Form in Form Designer icon within the component toolbar. 
This icon launches the Form Designer, as you have probably guessed by now. 
 Figure  6-1  shows this  Edit icon , as well as a form used to capture lead information before routing users 
to download the whitepaper they are requesting. Simple data capture forms, such as this one, are the core 
use case for WFFM. It is recommended to use a developer to build  custom forms for more complex use 
cases. A developer can make WFFM do a lot of things beyond simple data capture, but you must balance 
the maintainability promises that make WFFM so compelling. The bottom line: A form such as the one seen 
in Figure  6-1 can literally take 10 minutes for a non-technical person to create, but don’t expect it to launch 
the space shuttle! If you want to launch the space shuttle, check out Michael Reynold’s series on WFFM for 
developers, an excellent resource:   http://bit.ly/1J5lymq . 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
162
 
■ Note  I’m not trying to sell WFFM short! WFFM is a powerfully helpful tool when used appropriately (note 
all the  excellent submit actions  in Figure  6-8 ). However, it is common to see people push it well beyond what 
it’s intended for, such as having 100+ fields with complex display rules, process-like tabbed steps, field-level 
“security”, and so forth. In these cases what you really need is a custom developed component, not WFFM. 
Notice in Figure  6-2 a graph that shows the tradeoff of the diminishing value of WFFM and when you should 
consider enlisting the help of a developer. 
 Figure 6-1.  WFFM comes with its own component that you simply add to your page 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
163
 
■ Note  Like any other component, WFFM can be personalized! Different personas may have different data 
you want to collect. Using concepts from Chapter   3  , you can easily apply personalization rules to your forms to 
show/hide different variations of the form based on the needs of your customer. 
 Another way to create a WFFM form is to create it from the Content Editor treeview (Figure  6-3 ). When 
you add the WFFM component to a page, as seen in the previous figure, what happens behind the scenes 
is a new item is created below System ➤ Modules ➤ Web Forms for Marketers ➤ Website. Every WFFM 
configuration you make is really just editing the item in this location.   
 Figure 6-2.    WFFM is easy to use and fast to implement, but you may want ot consider a custom component 
for forms with a lot of complex rules 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
164
 Notice in Figure  6-3 how a WFFM form item is selected. When selected you’ll see a Forms tab bar in the 
Ribbon with the following options:
• 
 Form Designer —This button launches the Form Designer, where you can add/
remove/configure fields, validation, and submit options.  
• 
 Form Reports —There are several reports that allow you to see how many times the 
form was submitted, what fields are commonly filled out versus left blank, as well as 
dropout counts (Figure  6-4 ). More on analytics in Chapter   7 . 
 Figure 6-3.  You can launce the WFFM Form Designer either from the Experience Explorer or through the 
 Content Editor 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
165
• 
 Form Verification— There is an out-of-the-box verification action that checks the 
form for malicious data when it’s submitted. There are several more that can be 
optionally added, such as checking if a user is in a role, or verifying a password. 
These verifications must be satisfied before the submit action can proceed.  
• 
 Save Actions —Save actions take the data in the form and do something with it. There 
are many to choose from, such as creating an item in Sitecore, sending an e-mail, 
and even CRM integration to create leads in your CRM, for example.  
• 
 Properties —The Properties dialog allows you to associate the form submission with 
a campaign (Figure  6-5 ). Additionally, you can optionally track dropout data to 
capture form data that is not submitted. This gives you a feel for how your users are 
interacting with your form. 
 Figure 6-4.  WFFM also comes with its own set of analytics for  reporting purposes 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
166
• 
 Profiles —This dialog lets you associate a profile card to the form item, similarly as 
you would a page as described in Chapter   3 . 
 
■ Note   Notice the Action drop-down in the upper-right corner of Figure  6-3 . From there, you can easily 
export the form submission data to Excel or XML files for reporting or processing purposes. 
 The Form Designer itself can be seen in Figure  6-6 . A form has the following hierarchy: 
• 
 Title —You can optionally add a form title when Title is enabled in the ribbon.  
• 
 Intro —You can optionally add a form introduction paragraph or other rich text 
(by inserting HTML) when Introduction is enabled in the ribbon. 
• 
 Sections —A form is divided into one or more sections. By default, there is only one 
section, but you can add more by clicking the Add Section link. 
• 
 Fields — You can add one or more fields within a section by clicking the Add Field 
link. Also, when a field is selected the left settings panel will update showing that 
field’s settings. 
• 
 Submit — You can have one and only one Submit button assigned with one or more 
submit actions. You can assign submit actions by clicking the Edit button within 
the Save Actions setting in the left settings panel after you have selected the Submit 
button itself (Figure  6-7 ). 
 Figure 6-5.    Oftentimes you will want to associate a WFFM form  submission to a goal setup in the Marketing 
Control Panel

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
168
 There are a few less than obvious  ribbon buttons that may be worth explaining.
• 
 Layout —You can enable/disable the title, introduction, and footer text placeholders. 
You can add any kind of text you want into these placeholders, even HTML/
JavaScript if you want to some advanced displays.  
• 
 Language —A form item is like any other item, in that you can have multiple versions 
of that item, either for testing purposes or for multilingual purposes. The language 
drop-down can be changed to different languages so you can translate the form 
elements, such as button name and title into other supported languages. 
• 
 Export —Did you build a WFFM form but your requirements changes adding 
complexity you didn’t originally anticipate, thus forcing you to go down a custom 
route after all? Don’t start from scratch; export the form to an ASCX file so your 
developers don’t have to recreate the wheel. 
• 
 Sorting —Move fields or sections up or down the list. 
• 
 Analytics —Same settings as described in the Content Editor. 
• 
 Switch To —Same settings as described in the Content Editor. 
 Figure 6-7.  When you select the  Submit button you can start configuring save actions from the left panel 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
169
 
■ Note  At this point you have probably noticed the left pane in addition to the top ribbon. The left pane shows 
settings for the selected field or the Submit button. In Figure  6-5 , you see the settings for the  data_Persona 
selected field. 
 When you select a Submit button you will notice several additional settings appear in the left setting 
pane (Figure  6-7 ). Form verification and submit actions have already been introduced; this is simply 
another way to find these settings. However, an additional setting that is helpful is the Success setting. What 
should happen when a user fills out the form? You can optionally send the user to a different page, such as 
a confirmation page. Or, directly inline the form can be replaced with a success message, such as a thank 
you message. In the case of this example, the user would be redirected to a page that starts the download of 
the whitepaper. Unfortunately you can’t redirect to a document; it must be a page. In these cases you would 
have JavaScript on the page that yet again redirects the user to the download upon arrival of the user to the 
download page.  
 As you can see in Figure  6-8 , there are many, many form save actions to choose from. Most are quite self 
explanatory. However, below are some important actions you will likely be using a lot: 
• 
 Add the contact to a contact list —Lists can be set up in the List Manager, used 
primarily in conjunction with Email Experience Manager (as described in Chapter   5    ). 
WFFM can help you administer these lists when customers submit their contact 
information. 
• 
 Account management (create user, change password, user login, logout, update 
contact details, edit role membership)—Need to build registration/login 
capabilities? This is a create use case for WFFM due to a broad swath of save actions 
that help you create users, assign them to roles, and provide password management 
capabilities. 
• 
 Create item —Do you have a news article page template and you want to track 
comments? Commenting is a great use case for WFFM as well as this action. You 
can use the Create Item action to create  items  , such as a comment, below the news 
article, for example. 
• 
 Enroll in  Engagement Plan —As described in Chapter   5 , Engagement Plans can be set 
up to help drive your customers to a desirable outcome. A form submission is often 
the catalyst to enroll a customer in an engagement plan. 
• 
 Register a  Conversion/Campaign —You will most likely want to associate the form 
submission to a campaign and/or conversation to feed into your analytics reporting.  
• 
 Create  CRM Account/Contact/Entity —CRM and digital web experiences are almost 
always integrated. There are two very important modules (one for Microsoft 
Dynamics and one for Salesforce) separately installable to help you integrate with 
your CRM system. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
170
 
■ Note  CRM add-ins for Sitecore can be found here:   http://bit.ly/1T8ULto (Microsoft Dynamics), and 
here:   http://bit.ly/1KT4SNk (Salesforce). 
 Do you not see an action you wish was there? It is very easy for a developer to create custom actions for 
your forms. The basic process is to create a new Action item to register your action, create a .NET class that 
is executed when the action is executed, and to create a custom settings/properties page so marketers can 
configure the action. Read more here:   http://bit.ly/1Gsaheu 
 
WFFM INSTALLATION
 WFFM is a module that you install over the top of your existing Sitecore instance. Like just about 
anything with Sitecore, the process involves  installing a package and then manually changing a slew of 
config settings. 
 The process is elaborate and thoroughly documented for each release. As such, it makes the most 
sense simply to direct you to the installation instructions for the most recent update, which can be 
found here:   http://bit.ly/1HHKsmz . 
 Figure 6-8.  There are many, many  out-of-the-box save actions ! 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
171
 Building Your First WFFM Form 
 Now that we have an overview of WFFM, it’s time to build a form from scratch. The example we’ll work 
through involves an Event Registration form. We want to enable customers to browse upcoming events and 
to register for events that interest them. The setup assumes an event data template exists with a component 
that queries/renders events. Each event will store registrations as child items below the event itself. When an 
event is submitted we will send a confirmation e-mail to the registrant. Additionally, we want to create a new 
lead in CRM for a sales associate to follow up on. Let’s begin! 
 Adding a Form to a Page 
 The first thing we need to do to start building a WFFM for is to add the Form component to our  page . You 
will want to launch the Experience Editor to do this. Create a new page if you don’t already have one. 
 As we discussed in Chapter   2 , you will need to ensure that the MVC Form component is an allowed 
control of the placeholder you want to add your form into (use Form if your solution is an ASP.NET Web 
Forms solution—less common and not a best practice). If it’s not you won’t see it in the list. If you select your 
placeholder, you can edit the allowed controls by selecting Edit the Placeholder Settings button from the 
context menubar. From there you can select the Edit button and browse to Renderings ➤ Modules ➤ Web 
Forms for Marketers and you’ll see the MVC Form item you can add as an allowed component. 
 
■ Note  You won’t see the Edit the Placeholder Settings button unless all components are first deleted from 
the placeholder. 
 With that setup complete, add the MVC Form component into the placeholder. Upon doing so you will 
be prompted to provide a name for your form (Figure  6-9 ). Additionally, you can select to create a blank 
form or you can copy an existing form. In most cases you will select to create a blank form.  
 Figure 6-9.  Give your form a good name and optionally copy an  existing form 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
172
 
■ Note  There’s no easy way to add an existing form to a page. You can only create a copy of an existing 
form when you’re in the Experience Editor. In many ways this is unfortunate (such as if you accidentally delete a 
form off the page and want to put it back on that page). The alternative is to set the presentation detail of the page 
and add the form from there, and thereafter manually set its datasource to the existing form item. This way of adding 
a form is more advanced and generally not a recommended practice, but it can bail you out when in a pinch.  
 Once you click Next, you will be prompted to create a new goal or associate the form submission 
to an existing goal. Goals, as discussed in Chapter   5 , are great analytic tools to keep tabs on how your site is 
performing. An event registration is an obvious goal for this example, as can be seen in Figure  6-10 . Additionally, 
you are also prompted to enable/disable form dropout tracking. Form dropout tracking does more than the 
obvious, such as tracking how many people visited the form and didn’t click the Submit button. It also tracks 
how they interacted with the form. Perhaps they started filling out the form but became overwhelmed with 
the 75 fields you want them to fill out. If they filled out the first 20 and then gave up, Sitecore will actually 
save those 20 so you can see that data and where they got hung up. It’s kind of sneaky when you think about it! 
 Figure 6-10.    When you create a new form you are expected to associate that form to a goal for  analytics purposes         
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
173
 After you click Next, you’ll see a confirmation page from which you can click Create. Hereafter, you 
should see your form on your page within the placeholder you selected! 
 
■ Oh Snap!  Unfortunately you probably don’t see your form!  Call it a bug; call it a feature; I’m not quite 
sure. Sometimes if you save the page at this point and come back you’ll see your new form component where 
it should be. Often you still won’t. If this is what you are experiencing I recommend you start over, but this time 
first delete all other components out of the placeholder before adding the MVC Form component. This is the 
surest way to getting it to consistently work. 
 Now that your form component is on the page, you can launch the Form Designer by clicking the Edit 
Form in the Form Designer icon on the context menu (Figure  6-11 ). 
 Figure 6-11.  Launch the Form Designer by clicking the  pencil icon 
 If you created a blank form you will notice that the Form Designer is blank as well. You can start adding 
fields by clicking the Add Field link. You’ll notice also that after your first field you can add multiple sections. 
In the case of this example, I will be adding two sections: registration details and e-mail preferences. 
 The first two fields I need to add in the Registration Details section are First Name and Last Name. 
I can provide those strings in the Title field, and then I need to select and appropriate field type. You can 
see in Figure  6-12 there are many field types to select from. This is a good thing. Different field types display 
differently (e.g., text box vs. drop-down vs. radio buttons), but they also have different out-of-the-box 
validators to control format (e.g., telephone and number types).

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
175
 All of these fields are pretty self explanatory, with the exception of the data fields and the list types. In 
our example we want to create a CRM lead when the user submits the form. However, we want to load that 
lead with helpful information about the user. Obviously we want to send basic data, such and the name and 
e-mail address, but Sitecore has other helpful context that might benefit the sales associate when they make 
the call. Perhaps there is personalization information you want to pass along or a lead topic. We’re going to 
use hidden  data- fields simply as storage containers for our create lead save action. We can enter a default 
value into these  data- fields by selecting the field and then entering a default value in the left pane that 
appears. Additionally, we can hide the field from the user by clicking the Rules/Edit button and adding the 
Hide Element rule to that field. 
 
■ Note  At the time of writing this, the Hide Element rule unfortunately wasn’t working. It apparently 
doesn’t do anything! I wrote a blog post on how to get around this bug. Since it is a bit of a hack, and since I’d 
have to assume a fix is forthcoming, I didn’t include the workaround in this chapter. Check it out here: 
  http://sitecoreconfig.com/2015/08/21/sitecore-web-forms-for-marketers-hidden-fields/ . 
 The other interesting fields in the example are the List Type fields. List Type fields populate values for 
drop-downs, radio buttons, and checkboxes. The cool thing about these lists is they can be static or dynamic. 
If you know the values you want for your drop-down you can simply enter them. Or, you can enter a query to 
query items in Sitecore to retrieve them dynamically. 
 Notice your options in Figure  6-13 . When you set a field type to Drop List (drop-down), for example, 
you can click the ellipses button in the left pane to enter or select what the values should be. There are five 
options by default: 
• 
 Manually entering names —Use the +/- signs to add/remove item text manually 
(Figure  6-14 ). 
• 
 Selecting Sitecore items —Browse to a path in Sitecore whose children represent the 
items you want to appear in the drop-down. 
• 
 Choosing from three query options (XPath/Sitecore/Fast) —Advanced options for 
complex queries. This is the most dynamic option, as the results may be different 
each time a user views the form.

CONTROLLING FORM AND FIELD APPEARANCE WITH CSS
 
 In the left pane, when a field or section is selected, you will also notice a section called  Appearance . In 
this section, you can set a CSS class to control the form or field styling (Figure  6-15 ). Out-of-the-box 
these styles are empty and you’ll need a developer to create styles against your requirements and/or 
create designs. Unfortunately, out-of-the-box, WFFM forms look pretty ugly. It is too bad there are not 
any actual out-of-the-box CSS styles and a “previewing” capability to  toggle between them and see the 
style in action before applying it. 
 In the meantime, a developer can create CSS classes for each of the  CSS options in the drop-down. 
Thereafter, when you toggle between those (clicking Save and Close to preview) you will see the form 
reflect those changes. Until then, do not be surprised when you toggle the CSS and nothing happens! 
 Configuring Form and Field Validation 
 You will want to configure field  validation in most of your forms. Validation might be as simple as marking a 
field as required or not. However, you can also add rules to validate the content of the field itself to ensure it 
matches a pattern you anticipate for that field. For example, you likely want to use a validator on a ZIP code 
field to ensure that only numbers are provided and those numbers match a particular pattern. 
 There are many out-of-the-box field validators. Most are not worth mentioning because they are tied 
behind the scenes to the field type. For example, there is an e-mail address validator for the E-mail field 
we are using in our example. Number fields only allow numbers. Telephone fields validate that the format 
follows a telephone number pattern. 
 Notice in Figure  6-16 that when you select a field you may or may not see a Validation section in the 
left panel. The Last Name field is a single line of text field that supports adding a validation. A Telephone 
field, for example, does not support adding a validation since a  built-in validation   is preconfigured. As you 
can see in the example, there are several to choose from: No validation, Numbers only, Letters only, Special 
characters must be included, Number and special character, E-mail address, and Custom. You will use 
Letters Only and Custom most often, since the other options tend to be built into field types, such as the 
Number, E-mail, and Password field types. 
 Figure 6-15.  A field/section can have a CSS class to control the styling. Get a developer to create the associated 
CSS to make your forms on-brand and looking pretty!      
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
178
 For the sake of demonstration, I have toggled our E-mail Address field type to a single line of text instead 
of an e-mail. I’ve also added the E-mail validator to the field. Basically now my single line of text field type is 
behaving exactly like the E-mail field type. 
 But that is not the point. The point I want to make note of is the regular expression you see in Figure  6-17 . 
All field validations are regular expressions that match text against an expected pattern. When you toggle the 
field validator to Custom, you can add your own custom regular expression into the Regular Expression text 
box for that field. Regular expressions can be very simple and get very complex. A great resource for you to 
use is   http://www.regexr.com . This site has a lot of great example regular expressions and provides a 
free-form editor for you to test your expressions and ensure they work before you stick it in your form and 
test it the hard, long way. 
 Figure 6-16.  Field validators keep junk data out of your lists 
 Figure 6-17.  If an out-of-the-box  validator is not available you can create your own by entering an 
appropriate regular expression 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
179
 Note in Table  6-2 the  field validation settings for this example.  
  One field type worth calling out specifically is the CAPTCHA field type since it is very much related to 
validation; validation in the sense that you want to validate the current user isn’t a malicious robot or hacker. 
The CAPTCHA field will prompt the user to enter the text they see in an image or hear on the audio in order 
to submit the form. This validation is impossible for a machine to do since it requires visual identification. 
The only problem with CAPTCHA is that it is a pain for your users; most people are annoyed by it and it may 
be a detractor from what could be more leads coming into your site. Fortunately, there are some settings to 
show CAPTCHA when malicious activity is detected, but hide it for normal use. 
 When you add a field and assign the type to  CAPTCHA   you will notice a new Security section on the 
left pane (Figure  6-18 ). There are two basic settings worth considering: 1) always show CAPTCHA, or 2) only 
show CAPTCHA if. Blog/news comments are a good place to select option 1 as they are prone to attach. 
Event registrations or lead capture pages are better candidates for number 2, where you only want to show 
the CAPTCHA validation prompt when malicious activity is detected.

 Notice in Figure  6-18 the settings for how a malicious user is detected. This screen is viewable when you 
click the Edit button next to the Show CAPTCHA if radio selection. 
 You can watch for how many submit attempts the current user has attempted (first checkbox) or you 
can watch for submit attempts in general (second checkbox). These values will be higher or lower depending 
on the type of form. A comment on a blog post probably should have a high number in case the customer 
is engaged in a discussion, but an event registration should probably have a very low number. The second 
option is for all users, not just the current user. It is more comment to have this setting disabled. If you 
recently opened registration for an expo you may expect a lot of traffic from different sources initially and 
CAPTCHA may not be appropriate. 
 Figure 6-18.    Use a CAPTCHA field to keep the flying monkeys away. Optionally only show the CAPTCHA if a 
monkey is detected 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
181
 The Form Display Page section is helpful if you want the capture form displayed on a separate page after 
the Form Submit button is clicked. This is helpful as it lessens the possibility of form dropouts due to users 
feeling overwhelmed with all the data you want them to submit, as they won’t notice your request to submit 
the CAPTCHA until the next screen. 
 
■ Note  You can configure a warning e-mail to your admin if an attack is detected. Notice the Warning E-mail 
tab in Figure  6-18 . From there you can configure the e-mail address, subject, and body of the e-mail to be sent 
to your admins during an attack. 
 You can see a sampling of the validators in action in Figure  6-19 . 
 Figure 6-19.  Notice how the validation  error messages appear above the form if bad data is entered 
 Configuring  Save Actions 
 The next step in the process is to configure what happens when the form is submitted. In the case of an event 
registration, we want to save the registration details and create a lead in our CRM for a sales associate to 
follow up on. We also want to configure what happens if the save was not a success. Additionally, we want 
to submit the registrant information into an e-mail campaign list for future correspondence, but also send 
them an immediate e-mail confirming their registration. Finally, we need to configure what happens after 
the form is submitted: either sending them to a success page or simply presenting a confirmation message. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
182
 Saving the Event Registration 
 We want to save the registration  data when someone registers for an event. The most common way to do this 
is to create an item below the event item, such that all children represent registrations for that event. 
A similar pattern would be used for comments on a blog. 
 
■ Note  While common,  storing registrations below an item isn’t a best practice. The ideal way would be to 
store them in a custom database and have a developer build a custom SPEAK interface to allow moderating/
reviewing to occur seamlessly within the existing Sitecore experience that marketers are familiar with. 
A database just does some things better than an item in Sitecore can. 
 Now, for strictly data capture purposes this isn’t necessary. WFFM saves the data in its own database. As 
we discussed earlier, it is easy to export the submission data to Excel from the analytics, Actions drop-down. 
The trouble with this is it is a steeper learning curve for a developer to query that data (via the WFFM data 
provider), whereas querying item data is very easy. In our example we may want to capture the number of 
registrants against the max number of registrants, where we’d close the registration process automatically 
if the event gets filled up. With child items it is easy to simply do a search, get the count of the results, and 
render that count on the page. Likewise for news/blog commenting, for example, it is easy to simply query 
for comments and display the comment at the bottom of the post. Searchability is also an important factor, 
where in the case of comments you would want those comments searchable and therefore an item versus 
just sitting in the WFFM reporting database. 
 
■ Note  The  Sitecore.ContentSearch development framework can also be leveraged to include WFFM data 
within native search results if that is a requirement. 
 Use the following  steps to configure our item creation save action:
 
 1. 
 Select the Submit button in the Form Designer and then click Edit next to Save 
Actions in the left panel. 
 
 2. 
 Select Create Item from the drop-down then click Add and then click Edit. 
 
 3. 
 On the first edit screen you need to specify which template to use for the new 
item and where that item should be placed after it is created (Figure  6-20 ). Select 
your data template and the location and then click Next. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
183
 
 4. 
 After you click next, you need to map the fields in the data template to the fields 
in the form. Provide the  mapping , similar to what you see in Figure  6-21 , and 
then click Next. 
 Figure 6-20.    The Create Item save  action   needs a template to know what to create and a lcoation to know 
where to create it 
 Figure 6-21.    The left side contains the values coming from the template, and the right side shows the values 
coming out of the WFFM form 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
184
 
 5. 
 The final screen notes any data you may have missed in the mapping (Figure  6-22 ). 
In our case, this is okay because these data elements will be handled in 
subsequent actions (with the exception of CAPTCHA data, which is never 
of any value) . 
 With this action in place, whenever a user submits the form all the form data will be saved into Sitecore 
as child items below the appropriate location. In our case, the registrations fall below their  respective event 
items , as you can see in Figure  6-23 . 
 Figure 6-22.  Not all values need to be mapped, but you’ll be warned! 
 Figure 6-23.  After the form is submitted the new items will be created in the location you specified 
 Creating a Lead in CRM 
 Next thing we want to do is create a lead in our  CRM system   for a sales associate to follow up on our event 
registration with a product offering and/or discount. There are two add-ins for Sitecore, one for Salesforce.
com and one for Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Both behave similarly as far as the integration is concerned. 
 The  Dynamics add-in includes an action called Create CRM Entity. From this action you can create 
50+ different entities in CRM, including contacts, leads, activities, and accounts. They all behave similarly: 
the Create CRM Entity action identifies required fields in CRM and forces you to map your form fields to 
those required fields. Beyond that you can add optional fields. Fortunately all the queries are real time and 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
185
the drop-downs are populated from the CRM schema so you know your configuration will flow into CRM 
appropriately. There is very little you need to do on the Sitecore side besides what is called out in the module 
installation instructions. 
 
■ Note  CRM add-ins for Sitecore can be found here:   http://bit.ly/1T8ULto (Microsoft Dynamics), and 
here:   http://bit.ly/1KT4SNk (Salesforce). 
 Use the following  steps to configure the Create CRM Entity, Create Lead action:
 
 1. 
 Select the Submit button again from the Form Designer. Choose Edit Next to Save 
Actions in the left pane. 
 
 2. 
 From the drop-down, select the Create CRM Entity action and click Add and then 
click Edit to edit the action properties (Figure  6-24 ). 
 Figure 6-24.    The Create CRM  Entity   has several required fields, but you can also pull in other/custom fields 
from CRM itself, making the possibilities endless       
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
186
 
 3. 
 From the CRM Entity drop-down, select Lead to create a new CRM lead.  
 
 4. 
 There will be several required fields. Associate those fields to equivalent form 
fields. Note how our data_Topic in this case is used to populate the required 
Topic CRM field. Since Topic isn’t something a customer will provide, it is hard-
coded into the form by setting a default value in the data_Topic field settings. 
This, again, is a helpful way to pass data behind the scenes to your CRM system. 
 
 5. 
 Click OK when complete. 
  After you have done some  testing   you should see your leads being populated in your CRM system. In 
this case, we created a registration lead in dynamics (Figure  6-25 ). 
 Figure 6-25.  A new lead in CRM! 
 Subscribe the User to an  EXM E-Mail Campaign 
 Our example WFFM form has several options at the bottom where the users can select which e-mail 
campaigns they want to be entered into and the frequency of which they want to receive e-mails. 
Unfortunately out-of-the-box we can’t get that sophisticated. However, we can add the contact into a 
campaign list using the out-of-the-box “Add the contact to a contact list” action. This action takes the logged 
in user’s contact details and adds them into the contact list of your choosing (Figure  6-26 ). Email Experience 
Manager uses these contact lists to drive which e-mail recipients should receive the e-mail. A developer 
could fairly easily extend this out-of-the-box action with if/then logic to determine if the user should be 
added or not. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
187
 Sending a  Confirmation e-mail 
 The “Send Email Message” action is probably the most widely used action of all the actions. Fortunately it 
is incredibly easy to configure. Figure  6-27 shows the action settings screen with all the fields you’d expect. 
Click the down arrow next to To, CC, etc. to add form fields. Also, you can click the Insert Field drop-down 
to add a form field into the body of the e-mail itself to add context. This is a great way to send a confirmation 
e-mail of the event and the user’s form submission details.  
 Figure 6-26.    When a user submits a WFFM it’s a good time to subscribe them to a camaign by adding them 
to a list 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
188
 
■ Note  There is a secondary e-mail action titled Send Email Campaign Message. The nice thing about this 
action is you can use e-mail messages already drafted in Email Experience Manager so you don’t have to 
recreate the wheel. The downside is the user receiving the e-mail must be a contact/user, which isn’t always 
the case. 
 If you don’t see the drop-down to add form fields, you are not alone! At the time of this writing there is a bug 
with Chrome. Configuring this action works in Firefox and IE, but not Chrome. In general, Firefox seems to be the 
most stable browser for Sitecore administration. 
 Redirecting to a Confirmation or Download  Page 
 One of the last things to configure in our form is what the users should see after they submit the form. 
Should they see a thank you message or will you redirect them to a confirmation page that has additional 
information, such as links to download materials only registered customers can see? This can easily be 
configured by selecting the Submit button and clicking Edit next to the Success section. From here you’ll 
notice two basic configuration options: a page or a message (Figure  6-28 ). Select the page you want the 
user to be sent to, or select the message you want them to see (the form itself is simply replaced by this 
message).  
 Figure 6-27.    E-mails are easy to configure; you supply a to, CC, subject, body, etc       
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
189
 
■ Note  Oftentimes you are having a customer send their contact information before allowing them to 
download a whitepaper. One way to do this with WFFM is to send them to a download confirmation page that 
has JavaScript on it that in turn redirects them to download the whitepaper itself (not ideal, however, because 
it’s easier to pass around the URL to bypass the form). This is needed because in WFFM you cannot select to 
redirect them to an item in the Media Library, which is unfortunate. If you’re a non-dev and want to give this 
a shot, use the code sample in Figure  6-29 . Simply paste this code into an HTML field that gets rendered by a 
component on that page. 
 Figure 6-28.    When users submit the form you can simply show them a thank you message or redirect them to 
another page (such as a page where they can get the download they are looking for) 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
190
 Configure an  Error Message for a Save Action 
 Things don’t always go the way you intend them to go. Such is the case with WFFM form submissions. 
Sometimes a Save action fails to do what it intended to do, such as actually create the lead in CRM. 
Regardless, the data for the submission will be saved in WFFM and can be exported, but with some actions, 
such as sending the confirmation e-mail, the user may need to be notified. You can configure a failure 
message for each save action in the Error Messages tab (Figure  6-30 ). For some, such as the create CRM 
action, you may not have an error message at all since it isn’t a blocking event. For others, such as a failure 
to send a confirmation e-mail, you may simply state that we have them confirmed but they should contact 
Sales for a confirmation. Keep this in mind as you gather requirements for your WFFM forms. 
 Figure 6-29.  Here’s a way to kick off a download automatically 
 Figure 6-30.  If an action fails (such as creating a lead), you may or may not want to tell the customer through 
an error message 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS
191
 Localizing/Translating the Form 
 Like pretty much everything in Sitecore, WFFM can be  localized   so it can be translated into multiple 
languages and dialects. Those languages must be first configured, as is described in Chapter   2 . But thereafter 
it is a simple enough process to toggle the Language drop-down in the Form Designer to that change and 
start translating. Some things you may want to translate:
• 
 Field names 
• 
 Introduction, section names, and footer 
• 
 Field validation error messages 
• 
 Submit button text 
• 
 Success message when the form is submitted  
• 
 Error messages when a particular action fails 
 Notice the Language drop-down in Figure  6-31 , as well as the field validation error text for the Last 
Name field, which is also translated. Sitecore will serve the appropriate form language based on language 
preferences of the current user. 
 Figure 6-31.    Forms can be easily translated into other languages much in the same way as any other piece of 
content, which is described more thoroughly in Chapter   2 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ WEB FORMS FOR MARKETERS

 Summary 
 As you can see, Web Forms for Marketers is a very visual, easy-to-use form creation tool. It is appropriately 
dubbed “for Marketers” as it shouldn’t need any developer involvement to do basic things such as quick and 
dirty lead capture form, event registration form, and new user registration forms. 
 This chapter toured through the WFFM UI. We reviewed the Form Designer, how to set up field 
validations, and how to configure some of the more popular save actions. All in all it’s been quite the trip, 
and we’re all the closer to getting back to Kansas now that we know how to create a good ol’ form!

 CHAPTER 7  
 Experience Analytics 
 Marketers want to demonstrate  return on investment (ROI) . This has been an age-old dilemma for the 
marketer, tracing advertising costs to sales, for example. It’s rarely a solid line from one to the other. 
Experience analytics within Sitecore, however, offers some serious promises to the marketer seeking to 
demonstrate ROI, performance, etc. How is this possible? Sitecore logs every interaction from everywhere 
and tapping into this vastness of data is your key to understanding how your digital experiences are doing. 
 For example, a customer profile shows every interaction that customer has had with your brand. You 
can see campaigns that customer entered into the experience through, goals that enabled conversion, and as 
a result, outcomes such as purchases. All of these interactions are plotted on a timeline enabling traceability 
to the campaign, the investment, and therefore your ROI. This is truly more than just “ web analytics  ,” my 
friends. 
 This chapter begins with a discussion on how to plan your measurement strategy when considering the 
uniqueness of the Sitecore platform. Industry standards/approaches around measurement still apply, but 
knowing what the platform can enable you to measure is helpful; it enables you to ask much more specific 
questions of the data and rely less on high-level abstracts. 
 We then will cover the out-of-the-box reports available from the Launchpad. There are at least 18 at this 
writing. These 18 reports offer tons of out-of-the-box value to the marketer in measuring the performance of 
their experiences, campaigns, and the like. 
 Lastly we discuss self-service BI. What if you’re looking for that 19th report that doesn’t exist? You 
could ask a developer to build it for you, or you could just get it yourself with the right tools. An empowered 
marketer with tools such as Excel PowerView and PowerBI enable all sorts of data discovery and 
dashboarding possibilities not available out-of-the-box. 
 
■ Note   Federated Experience Manager enables you to capture all insights and customer interactions from 
digital experiences that aren’t even on the Sitecore platform. You can capture every digital interaction with 
your brand if you incorporate FEM into those experience’s architectures. The analytics are the same, but the 
configuration is quite different. Since the configuration is an advanced topic, you can find more about FEM in 
the appendix. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
194
 
STRATEGY BITS: FIVE BENEFITS OF EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
 
 Not getting the customer insights you need by tracking aggregate visitor data with your web analytics 
platform? Seeing the data in CRM, but not able to tailor content on the fly? Experience analytics tracks 
behavior at the visit level, providing the insight needed to understand specific customers’ behavior, 
the capability to personalize the digital experience with rule-based triggers and in turn build stronger 
relationships with your customers. Here are just five benefits of utilizing experience  analytics on your 
web site:
 1. 
 Track visit specific  customer behavior — With visit-level tracking, you can begin 
to see the paths visitors are taking throughout your site across multiple visits, 
whether they are identified or not. Get a view into the pages visited, content 
downloaded, how long they stayed on-site and how often they came back. Once 
an unidentified visitor submits their contact information through a sign up or form, 
all their prior visits will be connected to that unique profile. This level of detail will 
allow for a more intimate view of your customers’ experience and engagement 
with your brand, allowing your team to target specific customer with offers that 
meet their needs.  
 2. 
 Automate content personalization  for a highly relevant experience —If experience 
analytics is incorporated with your CMS, set rule-based triggers to serve content 
as a visitor completes specific triggers, providing a more relevant experience that 
caters to the specific needs of your visitor. For example, if a visitor clicks on a piece 
of content regarding a specific brand line and is located in Asia, personalize their 
experience to ensure that the next page serves a detailed locator page for that 
product line in that geographic area (not just the generic product page). 
 3. 
 Arm your sales team with details to facilitate a more  relevant conversation —As 
soon as a visitor identifies themselves through voluntary submission of their 
contact information, your sales team can have instant insight into the prior 
interactions a visitor had with your site, giving them the power to tailor their 
conversation to the leads’ specific experience with your site and their interest with 
your product or service. With experience analytics, you can see the content that the 
potential customer had interacted with, the steps they took (or haven’t yet taken) to 
learn more about your business, the source that brought them to your site, and the 
number of times they visited. 
 4. 
 Focus your  marketing efforts  on your best bets —Through profile scoring against 
your site’s goals you can begin to build an engagement score for each independent 
visitor. As visitors accomplish previously identified goals within the site (such as 
viewing a specific page, signing up for a newsletter, or searching for a dealer), their 
score increases. This way, you can see which of your visitors is the most engaged 
and target them with personalized messages to bring them further down your 
marketing funnel. 
 5. 
 Increase visitor  satisfaction and boost conversion —By focusing on your most 
engaged visitors and providing personalized content that is tailored to their needs 
and interests, you can improve your customers’ experience with your site, engaging 
them further and increasing the propensity to turn the visitor into a converting

lead. With the insight that experience analytics can provide, you can take action to 
develop the right content, serve it to the customer at that right time, and increase 
their affinity with your brand. 
 Experience analytics, in addition to a traditional web analytics platform and marketing automation 
software, will provide your team the relevant insight to take action targeted to each individual visitor. In 
today’s digital landscape, you can’t afford to have a poor digital experience. Delight your customers with 
the personalized and targeted experience that they have come to expect.

 Creating Your  Measurement Strategy 
 In the next sections you’ll learn about all the wonderful out-of-the-box reports that come with Sitecore 8. 
There is a ton of data that will help you understand how your experiences are performing. However, it’s a bit 
challenging to know where to focus, to know if you’re making progress, and to hold yourself accountable to 
the progress you are setting out to make. Because of all this, having a measurement strategy is critical. 
 A measurement  strategy should discuss:
• 
 What is being measured 
• 
 Why those things are being measured 
• 
 How we will measure them 
• 
 Who will measure them (for manual samplings)  
• 
 How often will we measure them 
• 
 What, specifically, are the measurements (the KPIs) 
• 
  Who needs to be aware of the measurements (communication plan, governance, etc.)    
 Chapter   9 discusses governance in general, but it’s worth knowing that measurement strategy is a key 
component of governance. Since governance is all about ensuring a performing, healthy, well-maintained 
Sitecore deployment over time, measurement strategy is a key piece of knowing if you’ve been successful in 
doing so. 
 Start by creating a document or wiki  page for this measurement strategy and follow along with those 
topics/questions. Next, begin through the following  stages to flush out the details of the strategy:
 
 1. 
 Business Objectives Workshop — Start with the  business objectives . What are they? 
How are they measured? Are there KPIs already available to measure them? The 
answers to these questions should be measured. 
 
 2. 
 Digital Strategy Workshop — How does your  digital strategy ladder up to your 
business objectives? Do you have measurable digital objectives? Are there digital 
KPIs that should be included in this measurement strategy? The answers to these 
questions should be measured. 
 
 3. 
 Sitecore Experience  Measurement Workshop — What are the objectives of the 
experiences you’re creating? What purpose do these experiences serve 
the digital strategy or business objectives? How do you know you’re successful? 
The answers to these questions should be measured.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS

 4. 
 Behavior  Measurement Workshop —What are the personas for your experiences? 
What are their goals, and what goals do you have for them? What outcomes 
are you driving them toward? What things do they hate? The answers to these 
questions should be measured. 
 
 5. 
 Identify  KPIs — You have your list of things you want to measure. Next identify 
expectations and goals for those samplings. What is the normal/expected range 
for each KPI? Think stoplight KPIs; what value represents Red, Yellow, and Green?  
 
 6. 
 Measurement  Governance — Answer the questions stated earlier around who/how 
will measure, who needs to be made aware, how will we communicate/escalate 
issues and status, etc. (more on this in Chapter   9 ). 
 Now that you have a bunch of KPIs identified for your Sitecore/digital experiences, the next step is to 
create a dashboard and start measuring. There are a few ways you can do this. You can use the out-of-the-
box dashboards as described in the next section. The benefit here is that there is no additional technical 
work you’ll need to do. The con is that you might not be able to answer  all your questions and provide 
values into your KPIs. Additionally, if you have a monthly executive status meeting where you’re expected to 
present the KPIs, you’ll likely be manually sampling all the data from these reports and manually plugging in 
values into a document of some sort and perhaps cutting PDF or something in preparation for your meeting. 
You might spend 8 or more hours assembling all this information. 
 Another approach is to build the dashboard along with all the  KPIs , so that in your executive meeting 
you simply bring up the dashboard and walk through the results for the past month. This obviously can save 
a lot of time and is discussed later in this chapter as we discuss self-service business intelligence. 
 With that dashboard in place and your measurement strategy loaded into your governance plan, you’re set 
to go. Everybody’s KPIs will be different, because every company’s objectives are different. However, Table  7-1  
has a list of some common KPIs you may find yourself including in your Sitecore Measurement Strategy.  
 Table 7-1.  Example KPIs 
 KPI 
 Category 
 Description 
 Revenue 
 Executive 
 For e-commerce sites, this one is obvious. However, through goal 
association and potentially a mashup with external system data 
(such as CRM), you could calculate how much revenue your digital 
experiences influenced. Influenced revenue is worth putting in as a 
KPI on your executive dashboard. 
 90-day revenue 
forecast 
 Executive 
 Similar to the revenue KPI. If you know that 100 engagement value 
points correspond to $10 of revenue 90 days from now, you could 
create a KPI that measures projected revenue. What CEO wouldn't 
want to see that? 
  Marketing 
qualified leads 
 Executive 
 Or otherwise called conversions, otherwise called goals, but that 
are routed into your CRM as a Marketing Qualified Lead. A VP of 
marketing loves telling the VP of sales how many leads she handed 
over the previous month, and this is a common KPI worth putting 
on your executive dashboard. 
 Campaign ROI 
 Executive 
 This one is a bit tricky but certainly a helpful KPI. If you do a 
lot of pay-per-click advertisement, and you track those back 
as campaigns and subsequently track through toward goal 
completion, you can calculate ROI assuming those goals have 
a revenue component (or that one can be calculated through 
association with data in a back-office system). 
(continued)

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS

 KPI 
 Category 
 Description 
 Persona scorecard 
 Behavioral 
 Every persona could have a scorecard. How do you know if the 
persona is accurate? Are you certain that "Pam" likes the things you 
think she likes? Personas should have measurable goals, outcomes, 
events, and failure events (as described in Chapter   3 ) and these 
should be in your measurement strategy and perhaps represented 
as KPIs, especially persona goals (things you are trying to get that 
persona to do, like convert). 
 KPI for each goal 
 Behavioral 
 Goals in general might warrant a KPI, especially high-value goals. 
 Visit count 
(perhaps by 
visit, campaign, 
persona, etc.) 
 Operational 
 Visits are somewhat helpful to measure. Value is more important, 
but since visits are so easy to measure, why not? Their usefulness as 
a KPI, however, is rather low. 
 Value (perhaps by 
visit, campaign, 
persona, etc.) 
 Operational 
 This is almost certainly a KPI. The question is more around value 
granularity. Value all up, or value broken down by persona? 
Channel? Campaign category? Etc. 
 Average page 
counts (perhaps 
by visit, campaign, 
persona, etc.) 
 Operational 
 Perhaps, as part of your digital strategy, you want to increase 
engagement on your site. Page counts is one way to measure 
engagement. Someone who browses to eight pages is more 
engaged than someone who browses two pages. As such, this may 
be a worthwhile KPI on your dashboard. 
 Average time spent 
on site (perhaps 
by visit, campaign, 
persona, etc.) 
 Operational 
 Similar to page counts but another way to measure engagement. 
 Repeat visit % 
 Operational 
 Similar to the previous two but yet another way to measure 
engagement (if they come back for more later, they are more 
engaged then if they never come back). 
 % of indirect visits 
 Operational 
 A referral is always better than a cold call, they say. You may want 
to measure the percentage of your traffic that is not direct traffic, 
especially if a key digital strategy is driving more social, e-mail, or 
other sources of traffic to your site. This KPI will help you measure 
if you're successful at that. 
 Bounce rates % 
(perhaps by 
visit, campaign, 
persona, etc.) 
 Operational 
 If part of your digital strategy is to reduce bounce rates by delivering 
more relevant/personalized content, you may want bounce rates as 
a KPI. 
 Geographic or 
language visit % 
(perhaps by 
visit, campaign, 
persona, etc.) 
 Operational 
 Perhaps you have a business objective to expand in China. If so, 
you may want a KPI around value growth from visits originating in 
China. Likewise, language could be measured. 
 Average page 
response times 
 Operational 
 You may have strict goals around page responsiveness that could be 
captured as a KPI for monitoring purposes. 
Table 7-1. (continued)

■ Note   Some of these KPIs are easier to create than others. Some you can create from data directly in 
the Sitecore analytics database, as described later in this chapter. Others need the analytics data augmented 
with other data from external systems or processed data, such as from financial systems for revenue or CRM 
systems for holistic campaign results. All of this can be accomplished, but with varying degrees of technical 
proficiency and/or integrate or use of external tools/systems. Self service BI is a great way to create these 
mashups of various data; see that section later in this chapter for more information. 
 Out-of-the-Box Analytics 
 Sitecore has more than 18  out-of-the-box analytics that you can use to get quick insights into how your 
digital experiences are performing. Most of the reports are very intuitive; the goal of this section is simply 
to help you understand what is out there and where these reports reside within the Sitecore admin 
interface. 
 
■ Note   Experience Analytics depends on MongoDB and an xDB processing server to be appropriately 
configured to ensure data is getting aggregated in Sitecore’s analytics database. If the following reports are 
broken it’s likely that these dependencies have not been configured. See the appendix’s architecture section for 
more details. Additionally, the list of out-of-the-box reports below was built off Sitecore 8.0 Update 5. Sitecore 
adds more all the time and this list is sure to grow with future releases. 
 Analytics Dashboard 
 The Analytics  Dashboard has several of the most important reports. You can get to the Analytics Dashboard 
from the Launchpad by clicking Experience  Analytics . If you don’t see this button on the Launchpad you 
likely do not have access. See Chapter   8 for more information on setting up security. 
 Online Interactions by Visits by Value Per Visit 
 The first report you’ll see shows  online interactions  by visits by value per visit. Basically, this shows hit 
counts and the value those hits are generating for your business, as shown in Figure  7-1 . 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
199
 Channel Groups by Visits 
 Channel groups by visits is next on the dashboard. This report (Figure  7-2 ) shows you from where those visits 
are coming from. In my demo environment I only have one channel (web) set up. You likely will have many 
(social, e-mail, etc.), so this report will be more helpful for you. 
 Figure 7-1.  Online interactions by visits and value per visit 
 Figure 7-2.  Channel groups by visits 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
200
 Top Campaigns by Value 
 This report shows you the value points your  campaigns are generating for you. You can quickly see which 
campaigns have been most effective. Notice the example in Figure  7-3 . 
 Figure 7-3.  Top campaigns by value 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
201
 Figure 7-4.  Top pattern matches by value per visit 
 Top Pattern Matches by Value Per Visit 
 The top  pattern matches by value per visit report (Figure  7-4 ) shows you which personas (or more 
generically, your profile cards) are generating the most value. This can be very helpful when you’re trying 
to get more value out of lower performing personas. You may notice their low performance and as a result 
update your personalization strategy to target more relevant calls-to-action, or perhaps you would spin up 
an e-mail campaign to target a particular persona. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
202
 Top Goals by Conversions 
 The top goals by  conversions report is the last report shown on the dashboard. This report shows you how 
people are converting on your site. You can see in Figure  7-5 how “add a favorite” is the most common 
conversion, but it is likely a lower value than a “request a demo”, in which case you may want to update your 
personalization strategy to better align to higher value conversions, for example. 
 Figure 7-5.  Top goals by conversions 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
203
 Language and Location Analytics 
 The  language analytics reports (below the Audience section, as seen in Figure  7-6 ) show you which 
languages are most common on your sites. In my case I had two languages set, Arabic and English, and you 
can see how many visits are allocated to each of those languages. There also is a language value report that 
shows you which languages are generating the most value for your site. This might be better as an average 
(see self-service BI section later in this chapter); otherwise, volume distorts the picture and makes the report 
less useful. 
 Figure 7-6.  Language analytics 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
204
 Location Analytics 
 The  Location Analytics  (next link in the Audience section) shows very similar reports as the Language 
section, except that instead of language it shows geographic data so you can get a sense of where your users 
are coming from. You can see an example of location analytics in Figure  7-7 , but since this is from my demo 
PC the data is all coming from the same place, so you’ll need to use your imagination a bit. 
 Figure 7-7.  Location analytics 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
205
 Pattern Matches 
 The top  pattern matches dashboard (Figure  7-8 ) shows you how often users are getting matched up with 
your various personas (or more generically, your profile cards). This can help you understand which 
personas are more prevalent on your site. Additionally, you can see which personas are generating the most 
value. This can be very helpful when you’re trying to get more value out of lower performing personas. You 
may notice their low value performance and/or low visit count and as a result update your personalization 
strategy to target more relevant calls-to-action, or perhaps you would spin up an e-mail campaign to target a 
particular persona. Or, if you notice your site hardly ever matches users to a particular high-value persona.     
 Figure 7-8.  Pattern matching analytics 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
206
 Acquisition Analytics 
 Acquisition analytics shows from which channel sources your users are entering, the value those channels 
are driving, as well as which goals are getting those users to convert from. This data can help you identify 
underperforming channels and how different behaviors lend themselves more or less to driving conversions. 
Notice the example in Figure  7-9 . 
 Figure 7-9.  Acquisition analytics 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
207
 Campaign Analytics 
 Campaign analytics show the performance of all your campaigns, as shown in Figure  7-10 . It is common to 
group/categorize campaigns since you may have many running in parallel. The first report shows how those 
different categories are performing in aggregate, followed by specific, individual campaign performance. 
 Figure 7-10.  Campaign analytics 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
208
 Keyword Analytics 
 Keyword analytics  show from which keywords users are entering your site. This is driven from your 
configuration of search engine pay-per-click configurations, such as Google’s AdWords. As people enter your 
site from an AdWords campaign, you can track those interactions here including keywords, assuming you 
have many campaigns each with different keywords. This is a helpful way to identify which keywords are 
driving the most traffic to your site. 
 Keyword Analytics can be vied from the Keywords link, below Acquisition. 
 Behavior Analytics 
 Behavior Analytics (Figure  7-11 ) show which pages are getting the most traffic. Additionally, you can see 
which pages users typically enter into as their first page, as well as which pages they tend to leave from (dead 
ends). In the top chart, you’ll notice the total page visits, as well as the average number of page visits per 
visit. This can help you understand how much time your customers are spending on your site. Other reports 
such as site search behaviors and download activity can also be found under the Behavior section. 
 Figure 7-11.  Behavioral analytics 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
209
 Conversion Analytics 
 The  conversion analytics are some of the more interesting reports. They show which behaviors are 
generating the most value (and as a result, leads) for your business. The overview page (Figure  7-12 ) shows 
a summary of the number of conversions, and which goals are converting. Then, there is a Conversions 
(Figure  7-13 ) page that highlights more details on conversions, such as the number of times a user converts 
on average. Lastly, the goals overview (Figure  7-14 ) highlights more details around your goal interactions. 
 Figure 7-12.  Conversion analytics overview

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
211
 Experience Profile 
 Experience profiles are where you go when you want to see a “single view of the customer”. You can get to 
your customer’s experience profiles from the Launch Pad ➤ Experience Profiles. 
 Every interaction, everywhere, should be saved to the profile to enable this single view of the customer. 
Certainly every interaction within Sitecore is tracked here, but you can also use the Federated Experience 
Manager (discussed at the end of this chapter) to bring in data from non-Sitecore experiences. Additionally, 
you could build customizations that integrate CRM data, for example. In any case, when you want to 
understand how a customer is engaging with your brand, you go to their experience profile. 
 The interesting thing about experience profiles is they are not limited to known users. Anonymous 
users are also tracked. Notice the anonymous profile found in Figure  7-15 . This user engaged the brand 
from a campaign named “Drive more requests for demos”. After entering into the experience, we’ve learned 
that this user matches a persona named “Pam,” a pattern card “Digital Marketer,” and that they prefer 
“high-level” information. Depending on what these personas/cards signify for your business, this can be 
very valuable information to know further down in your digital pipeline, as you’re trying to get this user to 
convert into a customer. 
 Notice also how this anonymous user has had three different interactions, the first on May 28th, 
the second on June 2th, and the last on June 4th. Anonymous behavior is even tracked across multiple 
sessions (ID stored via cookie). This is powerful, because when/if they do convert, all of those anonymous 
interactions come into that, now known, customer profile. So you see every interaction for that 
customer even before they became a customer! Additionally, past interaction data can help drive future 
personalization, making conversion easier to achieve. 
 Figure 7-14.  Goals dashboard 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
212
 I mentioned three different interactions as seen in the timeline. You can click one of those interactions 
and everything below will update to show specifically what happened during that interaction. By default all 
pattern matches, campaigns, goals, etc. are aggregated across all interactions so you see the full lifecycle of 
that customer. However, it can be handy to see what that customer did last week, say if you’re a sales rep and 
you want to follow up on a request for a demo or something like that. By finding your target’s profile you can 
get the intel you need to have a very specific conversation with that customer (or drive personalization, etc.). 
 Path Analyzer 
 The Path  Analyzer is a really helpful tool in Sitecore. Most of the other reports will show you the average 
user viewed eight pages, for example, but which eight? If they started on the home page, what are the most 
common paths to other pages? Where are the dead ends in the site and how are users getting to them? 
Which of those eight pages is generating the most value? Which page are they converting on the most? All 
these questions can be answered through the use of the Path Analyzer. You can access the Path Analyzer 
from the Launchpad. 
 Notice the following example of the Path Analyzer in Figure  7-16 . It shows all the most common paths 
on the site. In this example, I clicked the home page, and thereafter I see some common second pages that 
people interact with after leaving the home page. And likewise I can keep clicking down the path to see what 
happens down the line. 
 Figure 7-15.  Experience profiles help create a “single view of the customer” 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
213
 Notice that by the fourth node in the path, whitepaper download, we can see the digital funnel on the 
upper left. It shows that 0.7% of users get to this node from the Downloads page, and that 1.7% of users get 
to downloads from the EXM Installation Guide page. Additionally, you can analyze value and visits at each 
node to see where the value is generated on your site, and potentially where users are finding no value at all. 
 Self-Service Sitecore Business Intelligence 
 As you just saw, there are at least 18 different out-of-the-box reports, so why would we need to extend 
this discussion any further? Are there other reports we don’t get out-of-the-box? Well, yes! Really, the 
possibilities are infinite. Every business is going to care more or less about different things. Every Sitecore 
installation will have a different measurement strategy that measures digital success against benchmarks 
and business objectives. Since building custom reports is such a pain in the rear (see note in the chapter’s 
introduction), we turn instead to  self-service Business Intelligence (BI)      to accommodate our custom analytic 
needs. 
 Figure 7-16.    The Path Analyzer helps you understand how your customers are navigating the digital 
experience 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
214
 
■ Note   Custom reports within Sitecore is an alternative, but you’ll need a savvy Sitecore developer. The 
benefit is that you get an integrated reporting experience alongside all the out-of-the-box analytics. The 
downside is that it’s akin to launching the space shuttle, when compared to the self-service techniques 
described in this section. Empower the marketer, or enforce consistency? That’s a business decision you’ll have 
to make. Since custom analytics are beyond the scope of the audience of this book, it is not covered here. For a 
good example of custom, integrated analytics, check out   http://bit.ly/1O44i0L . 
 A few  benefits of self-service BI for Sitecore are:
• 
 Mobile BI —Sitecore admin interface is not mobile optimized. Get your analytics on 
the go with self-service BI. 
• 
 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) —The out-of-the-box dashboard has great 
information, but it takes a while to interpret. Wouldn’t it be great to have a  KPI  , so in 
three seconds you can understand how you’re performing?  
• 
 Cross-dimension relationships —Would it be nice to see what goals a campaign 
generated and the value of those goals? Or, perhaps you want to understand 
which Personas trigger which goals the most across various campaigns? These 
relationships can be expressed either as three separate custom reports, or as one 
single report with filtering capabilities—something most self-service BI tools do 
natively. 
• 
 Mashups with other  datasources   —Perhaps you want to extend your web analytics 
data and mash it up with your CRM data. This would help you understand a 
customer’s journey across campaigns managed across multiple systems. 
• 
 The marketer can ask questions of the data that otherwise is not answerable in a  static 
report . PowerBI, for example, has a Q&A feature where you can free-form type your 
questions in a search box and PowerBI displays charts/graphs it thinks align to your 
question. 
 There are many tools you can use for self-service BI against Sitecore data. Microsoft Excel, a tool 
everybody is familiar with, is a great start. If you want to share your dashboards and KPIs with others on 
your team, you may want to consider PowerBI. PowerBI is configured very similarly to Excel, so it is a very 
easy-to-use product. You can publish your dashboards into and Office 365 PowerBI site to share with others 
in your organization. While there are many other tools (Tableau, for example), these two will be covered in 
this section. 
 
■ Note   This isn’t a BI book. You can buy entire books on Excel and PowerBI, and I recommend you get one if 
you’re serious about leveraging these tools for your Sitecore BI needs. The goal of this section is simply to whet 
your appetite and provide a high-level understanding of what is possible, with minimal step-by-step procedures. 
Once you know the data model and once you know the tool, you have no need for step-by-step procedures. 
That’s the promise of self-service BI, after all. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS

 Excel PowerView Reporting 
 Excel spreadsheets , and specifically PowerView dashboards, provide an easy fast way to get your fingers in 
the data and start playing around. In 15 minutes you can create a dashboard similar to the one you see in 
Figure  7-17 . Notice how we have many of the types of data you see in some of the out-of-the-box reports 
described in the previous section. You see visit counts, value for those visits, campaign data, etc. Since you’re 
connecting Excel to the same datasource that Sitecore connects to, you have all the same data available 
at your fingertips. Simply check a value in the table that interested you (below PowerView Fields) such as 
Traffic Type ➤ Visits and you’ll see a graph pop up on the left showing that data. It’s that easy! 
 Figure 7-17.  PowerView is an excellent and easy way to create your own custom reports without needing a 
developer 
 You could add other fields or create relationships between different types of data. Notice in Figure  7-18 
how I clicked a campaign named Drive More Demos. When I clicked that campaign, PowerView is smart 
enough to update  all the charts/graphs on that dashboard and check to see if they can filter their data by 
that item. Notice how the visits/value chart has updated to just show the visits/value for just that campaign. 
Likewise, the top pages value updated, as well as the traffic source on the lower right. Unfortunately with my 
limited dataset (demo environment), the charts in my figures don’t look as cool as yours will look when you 
have production data you’re reporting against. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
216
 Check out these high-level steps to create a PowerView dashboard similar to what you see in the 
previous two  figures :
 
 1. 
 Open Excel 2013 ProPlus or later version. 
 
■ Note   You can install a module into Excel 2010 to support PowerView if you’re not on Excel 2013, where it’s 
installed by default. 
 
 2. 
 On the Ribbon, click PowerPivot (last tab) and then click Manage.     
 
■ Note   If PowerPivot is not shown, click the Insert tab ➤ Power View button. Thereafter you’ll be prompted 
to enable PowerPivot, and after which the PowerPivot tab should appear. Click PowerPivot ➤ Manage. 
 Figure 7-18.  When you click an item in PowerView, all the other reports update to show the relationships 
between the  data elements , which is not available in the  out-of-the-box reports 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
217
 
 4. 
 Enter the name of the SQL server that’s hosting your Sitecore Analytics database. 
Thereafter, you should see the Analytics database show up in the drop-down of 
databases. Click Next. 
 
■ Note   You may not have access to the analytics database. If not, ask your Sitecore administrator to grant 
your user ID read access to the Analytics database. A best practice here might be to have an Active Directory 
group that maps to your “Contoso Sitecore Marketing Analysts” Sitecore role (see Chapter   8 ) and this AD group 
also has read access to this database to enable self-service BI. 
 
 5. 
 Select “Select from a List OF Tables…” and click Next. 
 
 6. 
 Select all of the tables to import all the analytics data (Figure  7-20 ) and then click 
Finish. Excel will import all of the data, which might take a good long time. Click 
Close when it’s complete. 
 
■ Note   This may only be appropriate for smaller sites. The analytics database can get huge if you’re getting 
millions of requests a day. If so, you should consider PowerBI (see the note in the next section), which can 
handle larger datasets and can refresh the data behind the scenes, or simply import the specific tables you 
need (but you’ll limit the reporting you can do as a result). 
 Figure 7-19.    In Excel, simply import the Sitecore Analytics database to start creating your custom reports 
 
 3. 
 Within the  PowerPivot Manager , click Get External Data ➤ From Database ➤ 
From SQL Server, as can be seen in Figure  7-19 . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
218
 
 7. 
 Back on the spreadsheet, click the Insert tab ➤ PowerView to add a PowerView 
report to the book. 
 
 8. 
 You’ll notice all PowerView Fields on the right. Most of the names are 
self-explanatory. For demonstration purposes, scroll down and expand 
Fact_Traffic and then check the Visits and Value checkboxes. 
 
 9. 
 You’ll notice the data added to the design surface but not in a chart format 
(Figure  7-21 ). To convert it, click the border around the data, and then click the 
Design tab ➤ Other Chart ➤ Line to convert it to a view that will look similar to 
Figure  7-17 . 
 Figure 7-20.    Import all the tables and  Excel with auto-generate all the needed relationships

 10. 
 Perform similar steps to add other types of data, such as Campaign performance, 
channels, or top pages that provide the decision support you need.       
 PowerBI for Teams 
 PowerBI is a feature of Microsoft’s Office 365 cloud (   www.Office365.com   ,    www.PowerBI.com  ). Essentially, 
PowerBI is a cloud-based business intelligence platform. It is very easy to connect PowerBI to internal 
datasource (such as an on premise Sitecore Analytics database) or external datasources (such as a Sitecore 
Analytics database hosted in Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS). PowerBI has very similar charting and 
graphing capabilities that you find in Excel. 
 However, PowerBI has certain  advantages over PowerView in Excel. Those are:
• 
 You can easily share your dashboards with others in your company (it’s a pain to 
e-mail large files around, keep them in sync, etc.) because PowerBI uses a web 
browser for data visualization (Figure  7-22 shows a retail sample).  
• 
 PowerBI does a much better job with mobile insights. For example, there is a native 
iPhone/iPad app for PowerBI, whereas loading a spreadsheet on your iPhone is a bit 
more clunky, and depending on the size of the spreadsheet, likely impossible. 
• 
 PowerBI can refresh the data on a schedule of your choosing such as hourly, behind 
the scenes, so every time you go to PowerBI you know the data is fresh. This is very 
important for large datasets since you probably don’t want to watch a spinny spin for 
30 minutes before you get the decision support you need.  
• 
 PowerBI has free-form Q&A abilities to “ask questions of the data”. This is very 
powerful for data discovery purposes, or when you’re lazy and don’t want to build 
pre-canned charts, etc. . 
 Figure 7-21.    Use the  Switch Visualization options to choose what type of chart or graph you want 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
220
 
■ Note   PowerBI has maximum dataset sizes (currently set at 250MB of compressed data; you’ll see about 
50% compression of your Sitecore Analytics database). For true “enterprise grade” self-service BI you need to 
build an OLAP Cube or Tabular model on top of the Sitecore Analytics database that pre-aggregates information, 
from which you connect PowerBI to the cube or model through the Analysis Services Connector. In this case, 
live queries are issued, as opposed to caching all the data within PowerBI. OLAP cubes and Tabular models are

CHAPTER 7 ■ EXPERIENCE ANALYTICS
222
 Summary 
 Experience Analytics enables you to measure success and drive performance and return on your investment. 
In the Sitecore world, Experience Analytics is driven from Sitecore’s xDB platform, where every interaction, 
everywhere, is captured, enabling rich reporting and even self-service business intelligence with tools such 
as PowerBI. 
 It all starts, however, with your measurement strategy. Knowing what to measure is just as critical as 
knowing how to measure it. Measurement in Sitecore stems from all the previously discussed topics in this 
book, especially campaigns, outcomes, goals, and personas. 
 Measurement helps us understand if we configured those things correctly and if they are driving their 
anticipated value or not. This chapter covered all of these concepts, including self-service BI for extra credit. 
 All things considered, the potential is limitless; we’ve just seen the tip of the iceberg on what can be 
accomplished with Experience Analytics.

 CHAPTER 8  
 Security 
 Oh, the dreaded “Access Denied” page. Security is table stakes for any configuration guide such as this one. 
However, security is a huge topic, so it’s important to straight away align on what is covered in this chapter, 
and what is intentionally not covered. 
 Security tries to answer questions like “who are my users?,” “how will they authenticate?,” “what are 
they allowed to do once they’re logged in?,” and “is my configuration hardened against attack?” 
 In a book focused on end users, marketers, and power users, security has a narrower focus than 
say, administrators. Administrators are concerned with all of these aspects of security. Power users 
(technologists but not necessarily developers or admins) are concerned more with the application 
configuration and hence the questions “who are my users?” and “what are they allowed to do once they’re 
logged in?”. This, then, is the primary focus of this chapter. The appendix does a bit to elaborate on “how will 
they authenticate,” but even that is a topic generally beyond the scope of the majority of those who will be 
purchasing this book. 
 To get started, we want to dig into user management and access management in Sitecore. This will 
allow power users to create users who can log in to the site, as well as configure what they are allowed to 
do once they get into the site. These  features stem from the Launchpad (Figure  8-1 ), specifically the User 
Manager, Security Editor, Access Viewer, and Role Manager icons (the Domain Manager is discussed more in 
the appendix). 
• 
 User Manager —Where you can go to create new users, reset passwords, etc. 
• 
 Security Editor —Where you can go to grant access rights to users. 
• 
 Access Viewer —Where you go to see what access rights a user already has. 
• 
 Domain Manager —Where you can set up new user sources, such as “Extranet” vs. 
“Partners” or a link to CRM or an internal Active Director. 
• 
 Role Manager —Where you go to create roles (groups of users granted similar 
access rights). 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
224
 User Management 
 User management is a great place to start a security conversation. Security is applied to users; when 
someone logs in to Sitecore we need to configure what they are allowed to do and what they are prevented 
from doing. In order for users to log in, they must have an account. That account is managed from the User 
Manager utility, which can be launched from Launchpad (as seen in Figure  8-1 ). 
 The User  Manager  should look similar to Figure  8-2 . There are four main sections of configurations to 
choose from: 
• 
 Users —This section features buttons that allow you to create new users or update 
existing users, such as editing the e-mail address or resetting the password. The list 
of existing users is below the ribbon. 
• 
 Security —This section has a link to the Role Manager, as well as a link to launch the 
Domain Manager. 
• 
 Tools —This section has a link to the Access Viewer, as well as a link to launch the 
Security Editor. 
• 
 Serialization —Serialization is a way for an administrator to essentially back up all 
your users/roles onto the server file system, often used for portability purposes. 
 Figure 8-1.  Security  configuration options are available on the Launchpad 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
225
 Users are tabbed, showing the first 16 by default. If you have hundreds of users (or more), you’ll likely 
rely on the search box to find a user. Thereafter, you can select that row in the table and then click one of the 
ribbon buttons to take action on that user. 
 
USER DOMAINS AND AUTHENTICATION SCENARIOS
 
 You’ll notice in Figure  8-2  the Domain column.  Domains   typically refer to categories of users. The  Sitecore  
domain is an out-of-the-box domain that signifies that the user is wholly managed in Sitecore. Figure  8-2  
shows a couple more domains:  crm ,  default , and  extranet . In and of themselves, these domains are 
nothing more than a categorization. However, they also help you understand the source of the user. 
 “Extranet” or custom domains can be a great place to categorize your external site users (users who 
log into your site—aka customers—but don’t need access to Sitecore). For multisite scenarios you may 
have several custom domains, one for each. 
 Active Directory, CRM, and other sources can provide users to Sitecore, but where you may or may not 
want the user actually managed in Sitecore. CRM, for example, you might want managed in Sitecore, 
and by managed we mean things like password resets, or other profile data, such as a name and e-mail 
address. These data can be synced back to CRM via a two-way connection. 
 On the other hand you likely won’t want Active Directory accounts managed in Sitecore, because of 
stricter rules for maintaining a single source of truth. For simple scenarios, such as extranet scenarios, 
you can create custom domains from within the Domain Manager (Figure  8-1 ) to start categorizing your 
users. Additionally, see the appendix for more details on user authentication scenarios, such as Active 
Directory, or social scenarios, such as using your Facebook account to log in to Sitecore. 
 Figure 8-2.  You can create new users from the User Manager 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
226
 Creating a New User 
 Creating a new  user  is as simple as clicking the New from the User Manager. You’ll be prompted to fill out 
some user information, as can be seen in Figure  8-3 . Beyond the obvious, there are a few settings that may 
warrant some additional elaboration: 
• 
 Domain —User categorization and source, see the sidebar entitled “User Domains 
and Authentication Scenarios” earlier in this chapter.  
• 
 Roles —Roles are used to assign security to a group of users of an item so the security 
can be managed in bulk. Select which roles you want the new users to be a member of.  
• 
 User Profile —A user can have one or more pieces of metadata about them that 
describes that user, such as name, e-mail address, company, and so forth. Different 
profiles offer different metadata possibilities, and you can even create custom 
profiles to select from. 
 Figure 8-3.    When creating a new user, you'll want to assign appropriate roles and an appropriate profile to 
 manage metadata about that user 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
227
 After you click Next, you’ll receive a  confirmation prompt  , notifying you the user was created 
successfully. Additionally, a checkbox will confirm whether you want to edit the new user in the user editor. 
Figure  8-4  shows what the General tab looks like in the user editor.      
 Figure 8-4.  Every user has a profile. Some fields are consistant across all users, but users can have a different 
 profile template for different types of users 
• 
 General —The General tab has basic information such as name and e-mail (as shown 
in Figure  8-4 ). Note the “Roles” section later in this chapter for more information on 
the “Administrator” checkbox. It is  not a best practice to check this for anybody. 
• 
 Member Of —The Member Of tab shows which roles the user is a member of.  
• 
 Profile —The Profile tab has all the custom metadata assignable, leveraging the 
profile data template selected during user creation (Figure  8-5 ). Additionally, you 
can set the start page for a user. Content administrators rarely, if ever, work outside 
the Experience Editor, so setting their start page to Page Editor may help minimize 
some confusion. 
• 
 Language Settings —The Language Settings tab stores language preferences for that user, 
such as a “Default Content Language” setting that is a time saver for content editors.  
• 
 Information —The information has general non-editable information in it, such as if 
it is a locked account, and when they last logged in.  
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
228
 
■ Note   New users will not be able to log in until you set and provide them with a temporary password. 
Select the user, click the Change Password button, and then choose Generate to generate a random password 
they can use when logging in to Sitecore. 
 Creating New and  Custom User Profiles 
 There are times when the out-of-the-box user profile templates may not best align to your users and what 
you want to track against them. The best example for when this is helpful is when managing customer users 
(users who log into the site but don’t access Sitecore). A customer’s profile might have different metadata 
than a partner or an employee. The best practice is to create a custom user profile with that custom 
metadata, extending the existing user profile template. 
 Figure 8-5.  Sometimes it's handy to provide a start URL so that users go to the right place after they log in 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
229
 
■ Note   This is definitely an administrator’s task. Marketers beware; you probably don’t have the needed 
access to create custom profile templates. 
 The profiles that show up in the new user form can be found in Core ➤ System ➤ Settings ➤ Security 
➤ Profiles. Any item below this node will appear in the new user form. First, create a user template by 
extending the user template. Create this template in the Templates folder, as can be seen at the bottom 
of Figure  8-6 (“LS User”). Next, create an item from that template below the Security ➤ Profiles node. 
Thereafter, you can start creating new users from that template with your expanded profile metadata. 
 Figure 8-6.  There are several out-of-the-box profiles, but you can create your own as well 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
230
 Administering  Users 
 There comes a time when you need to administer an existing user. When you select a user in the users list, 
you can then select from the buttons in Figure  8-7 to change that user’s settings. These include editing, 
deleting, unlocking, enabling, disabling, and resetting a user’s password.   
 Editing/Deleting a User 
 To edit a user, simply select the user in the table and then click Edit. This will bring up the user profile, as was 
discussed in Figure  8-4 . 
 Deleting a user is a similar process. Select the user you want to delete, and then click the Delete  button   
to permanently delete that user from Sitecore. 
 Unlocking a User 
 A user will become locked if they fail to enter their credentials incorrectly 256 times by default. If a user 
becomes locked, it requires an administrator to go in, select the user, and click the  Unlock button  . The 
obvious recommendation for the security sensitive is to lower the number of allowed attempts, down from 
256 to perhaps 5. To accomplish this, ask an administrator to update the  maxInvalidPasswordAttempts 
value of the membership provider in your site’s  web.config file. 
 Enabling/Disabling a User 
 There may come a time when you want to  disable a user, thus preventing them from logging in to Sitecore 
temporarily. Examples might be when you are working with outside consulting companies going off-project, 
or perhaps employees taking a sabbatical. Simply select the user and click Enable or Disable as appropriate 
to either deny or grant them access. 
 Changing a User’s Password 
 Users can retrieve a forgotten  password by click the Forgot Password link. Through these means most of 
your password management will just be the exception. Forgot Password relies on an e-mail address. If one 
is not available an administrator will need to manually reset the password. To accomplish this, simply select 
the user, and then click Change Password. Since you don’t know the old password, just click Generate to 
generate a random password, as shown in Figure  8-8 . Send that auto-generated password to the user, who 
can then change it to a password that is easier to remember.     
 Figure 8-7.    Managing users involves reseting passwords and unlocking accounts if they type in the wrong 
password too many times 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
231
 
■ Note   The Forgot Password link is enabled by default. You can disable it via a  web.config setting, performed 
by an administrator. Simply set the  Login.DisableChangePassword and  Login.DisablePasswordRecovery 
values to false. This may be helpful if all your users are Active Directory users and you prefer them using other 
means to accomplish this. 
 Serializing Users 
 Serializing users or  roles (Figure  8-9 ) is an admin function great for backing up your user database or for 
porting users from one environment to another. When you serialize users or roles, those users and/or 
roles are saved onto the server’s file system below the Data ➤ Serialization folder. You could revert those 
users and/or roles in a different environment by pointing to that location as your source. Again, this is not 
something commonly performed apart from having server access and even then in rare circumstances, such 
as backward environment compatibility (Dev, Test, and Prod).      
 Figure 8-8.  It is a very simply process to reset someone’s password 
 Figure 8-9.    Serialization can be a handy way to back up users/roles or export/import them from one 
environment to another 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
232
 Access Rights 
 Access rights form the foundation of security and authorization in Sitecore. Access rights are concrete tasks 
a user is permitted to do. You can be granted read access, to view an item, but you may not have write access, 
to edit that item. Read and Write are two examples of the out-of-the-box access rights you can assign to users 
or roles. Access rights are applied to items, as you’ll hear more about in the next section. 
 Out-of-the-Box Access Rights 
 Table  8-1 shows all of the  out-of-the-box access rights. The Description column specifies how they can be 
used. 
 
■ Note   It is possible for a developer to add custom access rights for your unique circumstances, if this list 
below limits you in some way. See this blog post for how:   http://bit.ly/1hkl5SG .    
 Table 8-1.  Out-of-the-Box Access Rights 
 Access Right 
 Description 
 Read 
 Read is the most basic access right. If you or a role you're in has this access right 
assigned with an item, you can view that entire item (all the data fields). Read is a 
prerequisite to all other access rights, with the exception of Delete (you can delete 
child nodes you can't read if you delete the parent node). 
 Field Read 
 Sometimes you may not want a user to be able to read an entire item (all the data 
fields). In this case, you can use Field Read to grant access to only the fields you want 
them to see. Field Read would be applied to the Data Template's fields themselves 
(Template name ➤ Field section name ➤ Field name). 
 Write 
 Write enables you to edit an item. 
 Field Write 
 Similar to Field Read, you may only want a user to be able to edit certain fields instead 
of all the item's fields. In this case use Field Write instead of Write. Field Write would 
be applied to the Data Template's fields themselves (Template name ➤ Field section 
name ➤ Field name). 
 Rename 
 Rename permits changing the item name. 
 Create 
 Create allows creating child item below the node you have Create access on. 
 Delete 
 Delete access permits deleting the item. Note: If you delete a parent node you will 
also be deleting all descendant items, even if you don't have the Delete access right to 
those descendant items. 
 Administer 
 Controls whether or not you can apply access rights to items. 
 Language Read 
 Controls whether or not a user can read certain language versions of an item. Similar 
to Field Read, but is applied to the language itself (/sitecore/system/languages/
language). 
 Language Write 
 Similar to Language Read, except it controls which language versions that user can edit. 
(continued)

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
233
 
■ Note   Most of these access rights relate specifically to content management. However, Read is very 
important for content delivery. Anonymous users need to be granted Read access to items in your site that do 
not require authentication. If the Read access right is not allowed on an item, the anonymous user will get an 
“Access Denied” error if they try to browse to it. 
 Access Viewer 
 The  Access Viewer  is a very handy way to explore what access rights have been assigned to a user or role. The 
Access Viewer is found on the Launchpad; it’s the green lock icon (Figure  8-1 ). Simply click an item and the 
roles and the users list will update to show those currently assigned to that item (Figure  8-10 ). If you select 
one of those users or roles, such as the “sitecore\Author” role, as seen in the figure, you will then see green 
checkmarks next to all the items that user or role has access to. 
 The right panel on the Access Viewer can help explain how a user or role has access to that item/access 
right. If you click a column and an item, such as the Rename column on the Team node, as seen in Figure  8-10 , 
you’ll then see how it came to be that sitecore\Author was granted that access right. This example shows 
us how sitecore\Author was granted the Rename access right on the Home items along with all descendant 
items. Knowing this can save you a lot of time if you ever want to update access rights. You should get very 
familiar with the Access Viewer before too long.  
Table 8-1. (continued)
 Access Right 
 Description 
 Site Enter 
 Controls if a user can log in to a site (applied to home item of a managed site). 
 Show in Insert 
 Controls if users can see certain insert options when creating new items, applied to 
templates only (/Sitecore/templates). 
 Workflow State 
Delete 
 Controls if a user can delete items that are currently associated with a specific 
workflow state (see later section on workflow security). 
 Workflow State 
Write 
 Controls if a user can edit items that are currently associated with a specific workflow 
state (see later section on workflow security). 
 Workflow 
Command Execute 
 Controls if a user can execute a workflow command (see later section on workflow 
security). 
 Customer Profile 
Key Values 
 Grants access to apply values to profile key values. 
 Create Bucket 
 Permits converting an item to a bucket. 
 Revert Bucket 
 Permits reverting a bucket back to a normal item. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
234
 
■ Note   The “Access Denied” page is not on brand. Most companies will not want users to inadvertently see 
the Sitecore branded error pages. For the case of access denied, it is a simple  web.config change to specify a 
custom page to use instead (via the  NoAccessUrl element ). 
 Roles 
 Users are added to  roles and roles are assigned access rights to items in Sitecore. Sure, you are able to assign 
access rights on items to an individual user, but there is no good reason to do so. If you do, you’ll end up 
dying by a thousand cuts, and your security configuration will becoming increasingly more complex over 
time. Roles, then, are very important to understand. 
  Figure 8-10.  The Access Viewer is a great way to see how security is currently configured and who has access to 
do what 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
235
 Out-of-the-Box Roles and Role  Inheritance 
 There are many out-of-the-box  roles that you should familiarize yourself with. There are upward of 40 roles 
in fact. Of the 40, there is also a complex inheritance structure. Roles can be in other roles, so by adding a 
user into one parent role you may actually be adding them into 13 roles, such as the case with the Developer 
role. Table  8-2 attempts to describe each of the 40 roles, what their purpose, what they allow by default, and 
any applicable inheritance. The indentation (as denoted by X) signifies the inheritance. So, Developer is a 
member of Author, and Author is a member of Sitecore Client Authoring, and so on and so forth. You will 
find yourself commonly using the tier 1 and tier 2 roles in most cases. For very large teams, you may find 
yourself needing the extra granularity you get with tier 3 and tier 4 roles. 
 Table 8-2.  Out-of-the-Box Roles 
 Anonymous 
 Anonymous isn't really a role, and yet it acts like one. Anyone who 
has not yet authenticated is a “member” of the anonymous “role” 
until they log in. 
 Everyone 
 Everyone is kind of the opposite of Anonymous, in that the 
Everyone role will represent every logged in user. There's an 
Everyone role for each domain, as well as a global Everyone to 
represent all logged in users across all domains. 
 Sitecore Client User 
 Sitecore Client User is a root role that every “Client” role below is 
either directly a member, or indirectly via some other role. This 
role provides access to the Sitecore  (/sitecore ) user interface. 
Note: They won't be able to do anything when they get to  /
sitecore if they are not a member of other roles. 
 Developer 
 A Developer has a broad set of permissions; they can author content, 
design pages, create layouts/components, and data templates. 
 X Author 
 An author can create, edit, and delete items in the content tree ( /
sitecore/content ) 
 X X Sitecore Client Authoring 
 This role enables settings in the Content Editor to make editing 
content possible. 
 X X Sitecore Client Social 
Authoring 
 Gives the user access to post messages to social networks from 
Sitecore. 
 X X Analytics Testing 
 Enables creating component and page tests. Also enables access to 
the Test Lab. 
 X X Analytics Personalization

 X Designer 
 This role enables settings to make designing pages possible, such 
as component configuration and switching layouts. It also permits 
changing design details on data template standard values. 
 X X Sitecore Client Designing 
 Provides access to the Experience Editor design features. 
 X Sitecore Client Developing 
 Provides access to the Development Center and shortcuts required 
by developers. 
 X Sitecore Client Maintaining

 You may also want to create your own custom roles. For example, your administrators may want 
Sitecore Local Administration privileges AND Sitecore Client Publishing, allowing for security management 
and the ability to publish content as a separation of duties from content editors. A custom role might be 
“Contoso Sitecore Admin,” which includes both as members, where Contoso would be your company name. 
In general, these 40 roles can be confusing, and it is a best practice to consolidate these to align to your 
unique governance/role policies, prefixed by your company name to distinguish custom roles from their 
out-of-the-box counterparts. The following is an example of a potentially helpful role  consolidation  , aligning 
to your admins, content editors, developers, and marketers. 
 Contoso Global Sitecore Administrator 
• 
 All roles  
 
■ Note   This Global Sitecore Admin role is a bit redundant. You can simply check the Administrator box on a 
user to give them full control to everything. However, this is troublesome because they bypass workflows when 
making changes, and there’s no out-of-the-box view to see who all your administrators are. Using a custom role 
addresses these issues.

 Assigning Roles to  Items 
 Just by being added to a role doesn’t mean you can do a whole lot yet. That role still needs to be assigned 
access rights to items before they’ll become of much benefit. There are two main ways to grant a role access 
rights on an item: 1) through the Content Editor, as seen in Figure  8-16 , or 2) through the access editor, as 
seen in Figure  8-11 . The Content Editor is best if you know exactly which item you want to grant access to. 
The Security Editor is best when you need to apply access to multiple items and you want to do it all at once 
(versus opening each item individually). 
 The Security Editor will likely be where you spend most of your time; if you configure security once with 
proper inheritance, you shouldn’t need to be configuring security on an item-by-item basis often. Notice 
in Figure  8-11  how the Security Editor aligns with the content tree; as you expend the tree you’ll notice 
assignable access rights as columns across the top. If you click the checkbox next to an access right, it will 
turn green, signifying that the access right has been applied. If you click the X that access right is explicitly 
forbidden. Leaving neither checked/clicked allows room or potential inheritance. 
 
■ Caution    The Security Editor is a “hot editor,” meaning that changes you make immediately take effect; 
no publishing is necessary. This is where a separate test/stage environment can be helpful if you’re not exactly 
sure what settings you need to make. 
 In most cases, you will want the configurations you make to propagate down into descendant items. 
You don’t need to expand every node and make the same setting. Rather, simply click the Assign button on 
the item, as seen in Figure  8-11 , and then check the Descendants checkbox to ensure that the access rights 
are inherited down. This  Assign button is the same button you’d find in the Content Editor when applying 
security there, as can be seen in Figure  8-16 .

■ Note   Only administrators can see unassigned items. 
 You may have noticed that not all of the out-of-the-box columns are available in the Access Viewer. You 
can add more granular access rights as column into the Access Viewer by clicking the Columns button and 
then selecting which  columns  you want. Notice this in Figure  8-12 .  
 Figure 8-11.    The Security Editor allow you to browse the hierarchy and directly apply security on an 
item-by-item basis 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
240
 
■ Tip   When managing security in the Content Editor, there still may be times when you want to quickly apply 
access right settings across multiple items consistently. One way to do this is to copy the __Security raw values 
(ass seen in Figure  8-13 ) and paste them into the raw values across all the items you want to match. Security 
presets help you do the same thing, as is discussed in the next section.    
 Figure 8-12.  Not all the access rights are displayed in the Security Editor, so you may need to add some more 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
241
 
■ Caution   If you ever delete a role, the access rights assignments on items for that role are not removed. 
Over time this can lead to a bunch of garbage. It is a best practice to remove these assignments when roles are 
deleted to keep your security configurations as clean as possible. 
 
WORKFLOW SECURITY
 
 Workflows deserve a bit of special attention. Technically speaking, security is applied to workflow in the 
exact same way as any other item. But, knowing what do apply is a bit of a trick. 
 In the Appendix we created a custom workflow called the “Standard Publishing Workflow,” but didn’t 
take that next step to apply security to it. Now with all the context found in this chapter, let’s finish that 
workflow off with this important last step. 
 As discussed, we want editors to be able to start the workflow, but only reviewers can approve. A review 
can approve, but they shouldn’t be allowed to publish to production. Administrators should handle 
publishing. To keep things consistent, let’s use our “Contoso” best practice roles here as well, with the 
editor being the Contoso Sitecore Content Editor, the reviewer being the Contoso Sitecore Marketing 
Administrator, and the publisher being the Contoso Sitecore Environment Administrator. 
 The first step is to grant all three roles Read, Write, Workflow State Delete, Workflow State Write, and 
Workflow Command Execute on the workflow itself and all descendant items. This will allow all roles to 
start the workflow, advance states, and execute commands. Notice this configuration in Figure  8-14 . 
 Figure 8-13.  Copying the  raw values is another way to easily replicate the same access rights on one 
item to others 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
242
 Obviously the three roles are not all alike. Only one should be able to start the workflow, only one should 
be able to approve, and only one should be able to publish. All three can currently do all three. The fix for 
this is to go on each state and add a deny rule where appropriate. 
 
■ Warning There’s an important best practice with Sitecore security worth mentioning, which is to deny 
access via breaking inheritance rather than explicitly denying access. This is because in the case of conflicting 
security definitions across different roles, “deny” will always win out. This may be overly heavy handed, where 
simply breaking inheritance and applying unique security is more appropriate. 
 Figure 8-14.     Workflow security   is configured in the same way as when you secure any other item, but there are 
a few considerations to take note of       
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
243
 For example, the Contoso Sitecore Editor needs a deny on the “Awaiting Approval” and “Awaiting 
Publishing” states, to keep the fox from guarding the hen house. Likewise, the Sitecore Marketing 
Administrator needs a deny rule on “Awaiting Publishing,” because publishing should be the job of the 
Contoso Sitecore Environment Administrator. Note an example of a deny rule in Figure  8-15 . 
 With these security configurations in place, your custom workflow should be good to go! 
 Figure 8-15.  Add a  deny rule onto roles that shouldn't have the ability to advance the workflow state from one 
state to another 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
244
 Security Presets 
 Security presets  are a helpful way to apply the same set of access rights to items over and over. There are two 
out-of-the-box presets found in the Content Editor within the Security tab, as seen in Figure  8-16 . 
 The two out-of-the-box presets are 1) remove inherit, which breaks all inheritance and defines rights 
explicitly on the selected item, and 2) require login, which adds a deny read for anonymous users (as seen in 
Figure  8-17 ). 
 Figure 8-17.    The out-of-the-box Require Login basically removes annonymous users' ability to view an item 
by adding a Read deny rule 
 Figure 8-16.  Presets are another way to easily set the same set of access rights over and over 
 To create your own presets, simply create a new Security Preset item below the Sitecore/Settings/
Security/Presents item. 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
245
 Adding Users to Roles 
 It’s time to add users to your roles when all your roles are created and access rights are applied. Fortunately, 
this is super easy. Simply open the Role Manager from the Launchpad, select the role you want to add a user 
to, and then click Members where you can add your users. Click the Add button, and then search for either 
the users or roles you want to add. You can see this in action in Figure  8-18 . 
 
■ Note    When you add a user to a role, that user then is indirectly added as members into that role’s other role 
memberships, thus inheriting those other role’s access rights in addition to the role the user is directly a member of.  
 Figure 8-18.  The last step—adding users to your roles 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ SECURITY
246
 Summary 
 Security in Sitecore is all about users, roles, access rights, and items. Users are added to roles, and roles 
are assigned access rights onto items. That’s how it’s done, and setting up those four pieces is what was 
discussed in this chapter, besides a few more advanced topics, such as workflow security. 
 Beyond this basic principle, however, was a comparison of all the out-of-the-box access rights and 
roles. There are many! So many it can get confusing in a hurry. A key recommendation in this chapter is to 
consolidate into fewer roles that better align to your company’s governance, terms, and nomenclature (as 
well as work closing closely with your administrators and developers in designing and implementing your 
Sitecore security). That is a sure way to making managing security in Sitecore easier for everyone.

 CHAPTER 9  
 Governance 
 One of the most troubling observations I’ve noticed over my many years is how web site redesigns are often 
treated as projects, rather than as products. A project has a defined beginning and end, a scope, a budget—
but then it’s over. A product might have a beginning, but most never think in terms of an end. Nobody is 
planning on the end of the iPhone. They just keep making more and more, making it better and better and 
continually aligning the iPhone roadmap to Apple’s strategic business objectives. Should your Sitecore 
deployment be treated any differently? 
 Governance exists to ensure that as you plan for day 1, you also have a plan for day 2 and into infinity. 
Your goal is to ensure all your hard work building the site has a plan for continued success and value 
creation for your business. All too often sites are launched and neglected. All too often the great design in the 
beginning turns into a pile of cow dung two years later because you allowed it to become the Wild, 
Wild West. 
 Or, you end up shooting yourself in the foot. Consider the ill-timed Tweets. Off-message news articles 
can ruin your reputation, and untested data template updates can blow up your site. Or, you may be 
Canadian and have regulatory concerns around ensuring all content is perfectly translated into both French 
and English. Governance is how you avoid these scenarios. 
 What Is Governance? 
 First, governance is not a document. You need a governance plan to be sure, but really, governance is 
people, people creating rules and ensuring those rules are being followed. You’re the legislature and the 
police. You need both. The first key to governance success, however, is pragmatism. If your governance plan 
is not pragmatic, it’ll succumb to oblivion. If it’s too abstract, it won’t be understood. It needs to be clear, 
concise, objective, and measurable. 
 Figure  9-1 depicts the  Wicklund  Framework for Sitecore Governance  you can consider using with 
your Sitecore installation. I’ll be honest, if you ask 10 people what governance is, you’ll get 10 answers. Based 
on my personal experience leading governance workshops and installing governance committees, this 
framework of mine has proven itself over and over, but I won’t be so naïve as to not acknowledge many other 
ways to structure your Sitecore governance program. That’s why I’m branding this framework with my name; 
not to be narcissistic, but rather to acknowledge there are many ways to shape/frame your governance 
strategy. 
 Most people start a governance conversation with roles and responsibilities. I think this is the place you 
should finish, not start. Rather, start with the work. Define what the policies are and how you’ll enforce them. 
Discuss what your procedures are and who will perform them. Thereafter, you’ll get a much better sense for 
what roles you actually need, and those individuals serving in those roles will understand what is expected 
of them. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
248
 The  key concepts of the Wicklund Framework are:
• 
 Policies define what the rules are, but they also need to be audited to ensure 
compliance. 
• 
 Procedures set expectations with all stakeholders on how you’ll respond to events, 
but procedures also correspond to ongoing tasks that need to be performed by 
people or by automation. 
• 
 Those tasks can be estimated and resource leveling can help you understand what 
key roles you need and what resourcing gaps you may have.  
• 
 The Product Owner is the most important role (the role who owns the long-term 
vision for the product’s strategic direction, the one who is primarily accountable to 
the entire products success or failure); the Product Owner is in the business, not the 
IT dept. 
• 
 Committees need to be installed to hold the various roles accountable, including the 
product owner. 
 Figure 9-1.  The Wicklund Framework for Sitecore Governance can be applied to your Sitecore installations to 
help ensure continued success over time 
 Policies 
 Policies form the heart and soul of any governance plan. In the simplest of terms, they describe what is and 
is not permitted. Governance is all about maintaining a healthy environment, but how will you define what 
constitutes healthy? Policies offer that definition. 
 When you set up Sitecore you likely spent a lot of time and money defining data templates, an 
information architecture, a content strategy, style guidelines, security rules, etc. All those details shouldn’t 
be forgotten on day 2. Day 1 is about launch. Day 2 is about governance. 
 The first area of policy consideration are content policies. Who owns the content? What types of content 
are there? Are there different editing, approval, and publishing rules depending on the type? These, and 
many other questions, can be found in Table  9-1 .  
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
249
 
STRATEGY BITS: HOW TO HARNESS THE POWER OF CONTENT
 The “How”: Content Governance Continued from Chapter   2  
 This is the area that is often most difficult to get people excited about but ironically, can be the most 
impactful thing you can do with content strategy in your organization. You may have followed all the 
steps and created world-class content for launch, but if you don’t have a plan for how you’re going to 
manage that content— either as an individual or a highly-matrixed global organization, then ultimately 
you won’t see the success you hope for. 
 Before your experience goes live, make sure you have agreement and documentation on the following 
areas: 
 Table 9-1.  Content Policies 
 Topic 
 Description 
 New/update content 
policy 
 What are your policies around content strategy? Should content be “on 
message”? Do you need multiple content policies for different areas of your site 
because there are different content messaging expectations? 
 Will you allow new/update content requests from the business, partners, or 
vendors? When will you reject a request for new/updated content? 
 Content approval policy 
 When will you reject a request for content approval? Will you have different 
workflows for different content areas within the installation? Will some areas of 
the site have a more streamlined approval process (less risk) and others have a 
more thorough approval process (more risk)? Should all content be “approved 
with test” to ensure it’s optimized? When should you test and when shouldn’t 
you? Will you require content to be tested for cross-browser ascetics before you 
approve, or will you assume it’ll look fine (consider HTML editors)? 
 Content publishing 
policy 
 When will content be published? At any time of the day, bulk nightly publishes, 
weekend publishes? What types of content can be published on varying 
frequencies? Do certain types of content require no approval and the ability to 
bypass publishing (e.g. blog post comments)? 
 Media 
 How and where will you manage media? Consider all the previous content 
policy questions, but this time for media. The answers will likely be different. 
 Global/multilingual/
regional content 
 Consider all the previous policy questions and ask them again, but with a global 
perspective. What is your translation policy? Does any new content need to be 
translated into X languages before being released? Are there certain acceptable 
agencies for external translation? Do you allow machine translation? 
 Content expiration, 
archiving, and deletion 
 Should certain types of content expire? If they expire, should they be archived 
or deleted? If deleted, when should the Recycle Bin be emptied? Never, or on 
some rolling basis? 
 Versions 
 How many versions of an item should be maintained? By default all versions 
are maintained indefinitely but that can be a waste of storage and can slow 
down editing performance over time. 
 SEO policies 
 Which URL conventions, keyword best practices, or other SEO rules do you 
expect your content editors to be taking into consideration? 

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
250
 How  Decisions  Are Made 
 Does Jimmy in Sales or Natalie in Product get to put their content in the upper-right corner? Who 
has the final say on the homepage image? Can a manager decide to change a form on the web site? 
Content governance can help with these very common scenarios. 
 Governance can often be a tricky undertaking if you’re in a complex organization (because often it can 
refer to people’s roles and ownership), but at the least, make sure you outline:
• 
 The roles and responsibilities of the people involved in making decisions about content 
(it helps to separate out the day-to-day tasks from the higher level strategic decisions 
here, as you’ll find different people may need to approve different things.) If you’re in 
a highly regulated industry (such as financial services or healthcare), you’ll find that 
many steps are needed before you can push something live. Document those steps, the 
roles, and the expectations around format and timing and get commitment from people 
on those items before you launch. If you do, you’ll be a step ahead. 
• 
 The guidelines people should follow if they’re being empowered to manage content 
(these can include assets such as editorial or creative style guides, which can help 
create consistency). 
 How People Will Work Together 
 The most successful content strategy efforts are collaborative and involve of partnership with the 
user experience, search engine optimization, or technology teams during and after launch. Talk as an 
organization about how your efforts should combine early and vet solutions as one team as often as you 
can. Post-launch, formalize that process as much as you can with inclusive planning conversations with 
the core team that will help carry forward the strategic intent of your experience. 
 How Content Will Be Managed 
 There are a plethora of tools available to help you manage content beyond launch, from tools that 
auto-publish your social posts while you’re on vacation to analytics and editorial platforms that help you 
create performance and efficiencies. 
 Think ahead to what you or your team will need to be successful after launch. Sometimes teams find 
that the simplest Google Document can help a team collaborate on editorial ideation. Other times, 
organizations find they actually do need to invest budget into a technology platform that for example, 
helps them monitor social conversations, so that they can anticipate customer content needs or issues. 
If you’re working with a specific content management solution, you may already have these tools at 
your fingertips, but just need to look closely at how they can help you. 
 Last but not least, don’t forget to outline how you will archive your content.
• 
 Start with your organizational needs. Highly regulated industries will need to store 
documentation for 7+ years. Others may not. Consult your legal department to check what type 
of content should be stored, what level of detail is needed and how it should be kept. Some 
organizations have sophisticated document management systems (DAMs), but most still rely on 
e-mail or shared drives. Choose the one that will provide the best protection for your content.  
• 
 Think about what you want your “source of truth” for your content to be. If you created 
an inventory as part of your planning process, consider treating it as an evolving tool to 
help you keep a clear view not only of your content but the information associated with 
it (such as metadata or analytics code). 

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
251
 Content strategy is a wonderful mix of planning, imagination, and governance. Executed with passion, 
it can make or break digital experiences and has the ability to truly empower and lift up the teams who 
create them.

 Information Architecture (IA) is another area worth governing. A good IA helps improve usability, 
helps users find information faster, and improves consistency. IA can be enforced with things like Insert 
Options and Allowed Components, but admins can go around these barriers so it’s important to keep 
tabs on how your configuration is evolving over time. Check out Table  9-2  for some IA policy questions 
worth discussing.  
 Table 9-2.  Information Architecture Policies 
 Topic 
 Description 
 Insert Options and 
Allowed Components 
 You will want policies that determine which types of content items can 
be created where, as well as which components can be added into which 
placeholders. Sure, this is a configuration in Sitecore, but your governance 
plan should be the source of truth, not how it’s actually configured (hopefully 
they’re in sync, however). 
 Clone, copies, and 
versions, oh my! 
 As you learned in Chapter   2 , there are several unique ways to manage copies 
of content, but each with certain plusses and minuses. You may want to have 
policies on when to use which. 
 Buckets 
 Policies on bucket use—when to use them, when not to. 
 Navigation 
 How will you manage navigation? Who can update navigation links, search 
filters, etc.? For global/multilingual/regional site variations, this concept of 
navigation maintenance can be contentious, especially when navigation or 
content is centrally managed and distributed. 
 Site IA User Experience 
polices 
 What are your standards around information finding approaches for your 
customers (browsing vs search vs faceted search) and use of UI elements (tabs 
vs accordions vs whatever else)? These policies are especially important when 
your Sitecore implementation is very open-ended (components on an open 
grid vs preset page layouts). 
 Data quality is an important consideration for every company. You can put a lot of data in Sitecore—or 
around it—managed or viewable in Sitecore. Therefore, you may want policies specific to data usage to 
control how it’s used, where it comes from, and so forth. See some example considerations in Table  9-3 .  

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
252
 Having a consistent look and feel across your digital property is paramount (unless the brand is 
intentionally different). Your governance plan is a great place to denote policies on look and feel. See some 
example policy considerations around style in Table  9-4 .  
 Table 9-3.  Data Policies 
 Topic 
 Description 
 Field type policies 
(field validation) 
 Describe the field types and how they are being used. Data types such as phone 
numbers should have specific policies as to what the content editor should 
enter, or better yet, what the validator is validating. 
 Third-party data 
integration/validation 
 You may be integrating with external systems and you may need policies that 
stipulate the rules for those integration points, such as dependencies on data 
being in a particular format, etc. 
 Table 9-4.  Style Policies 
 Topic 
 Description 
 HTML editors 
 Will you permit HTML editors to enable content editor flexibility, but at 
the risk of stylistic variance? Note: The HTML editor in Sitecore can be 
customized on a field-by-field basis to explicitly grant/deny certain HTML 
elements. This is a great way to enforce your policy. 
 HTML compliance 
 Are you requiring all HTML to meet strict W3C compliance standards? 
What level of compliance are you requiring? What validators are in place to 
automate validation of compliance? 
 Accessibility compliance 
 Do you need to meet Section 508 or WCAG accessibility standards? These 
policies are especially important for government sites in the United States 
and most public sites in the EU. 
 Brand guidelines 
 Your company likely has brand guidelines (colors, fonts, and imagery) that 
are required to be used on your digital properties. Noting these requirements 
in your governance plan is essential. You likely may have hundreds of policies 
regarding your brand usage. Oftentimes these are represented in a “digital 
style guide,” but your governance plan should denote expectations around 
the importance of aligning to the guide. See the following site for some great 
real-world examples of digital style guides:   http://saijogeorge.com/brand-
style-guide-examples/  . 
 Style guidelines 
 You likely spent a lot of money with a creative agency to design your digital 
experiences and create a style guide, denoting font usage, sizes, rotator 
specifications, etc. The Content Editor will likely need to abide by these 
specifications and they should be noted in your policies. 
 Layout guidelines 
 Different types of pages or various places in your sites may have different 
layout policies. Designers can put content anywhere, unless it’s locked down 
with allowed controls or through stylistic policies in your governance plan. 
What are your guidelines for what should be above/below the fold? What calls 
to action should be prominent, versus other less prominent ones? 

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
253
 Security  is an interesting one. This is a place where you actually tend to not want to rely on policy. 
Rather, you want to rely on configuration to guarantee that policy isn’t breached, and you want to rely on 
procedures to ensure the configuration is maintained (such as adding users into the right roles). Still, you 
need a source of truth, for how Sitecore should be configured. Shortcuts, laziness, forgetfulness, and other 
human error happen; your security configuration itself shouldn’t be the source of truth. As such, you should 
document all your roles, their purpose, and other security policies in your governance plan (more thoughts 
in Table  9-5 ).  
 Table 9-5.  Security Policies 
 Topic 
 Description 
 Roles 
 Describe your roles (see Chapter   8 ) and how they are to be used, those who should and 
should not be in them, etc. Security is one thing you don’t want to govern, per se. Security 
should be systematically enforced through proper configuration. If you have very broad, 
generic security roles you will rely more on policy to enforce compliance, but with Sitecore’s 
robust security configuration options it’s easy enough to rule out this risk. Other things to 
consider: 
 • Authentication sources (where are users coming from, what can different types of users do 
or not do, etc.) 
 • Security hardening policies (IIS configuration, firewall rules, least privileged service 
account configuration, etc.) 
 • Partners/vendors/customers (data sensitivity and/or compliance concerns) 
 Many industries care a great deal about regulatory  concerns     . Some content, after it’s deleted, still needs 
to hang around for seven years or more. Patient data or cardholder data might find its way in your xDB 
analytics (goals, events, etc.), which may have a HIPPA or PCI implication. See Table  9-6  for some regulatory 
policy considerations.  
 Table 9-6.  Regulatory Policies 
 Topic 
 Description 
 Sensitive data in xDB 
 Be careful what you’re tracking. xDB is fantastic at tracking every bit and byte 
about customers and their interactions (personally identifiable information). 
Those interactions, however, can be personal. Do you have healthcare 
content and calls to action that could signal personal information? You will 
want policies on types of goals, events, failure events, campaign interactions, 
and outcomes that you don’t want to be tracking because of regulatory or 
compliance concerns. 
 Auditability 
 Describe any regulatory concerns around the auditability of who published 
what and when. In some cases, you may need to prove content was or 
wasn’t available at some point in time. Backups can be a way to do this, but 
at considerable storage costs. Perhaps a custom audit table might be worth 
considering. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
254
 Much can be governed from a technical perspective. What are your policy on cache size? Do you have 
policies on placeholder arrangements and layout usage? Will you use Team Development for Sitecore 
(TDS -   http://bit.ly/1iIvusp ) for developer collaboration? The list could go on and on, but considering 
most are beyond the audience of this book, Table  9-7 focuses more on general policies that concern most 
stakeholders.  
 Table 9-7.  Infrastructure and Environment Policies 
 Topic 
 Description 
 Product change  control 
 What types of production changes are permissible and by whom? Can all 
content changes be published whenever the business wants, or are there types 
of content that should be published at specific intervals? What about layouts, 
components, and data template updates—when can they be published? 
What expectations will you set with the business around code and bug fix 
change windows? Once per month for server-side code changes is common, 
but will that be too limiting for a fast-paced marketing department? What 
are your requirements around backout steps and backups in case of a failed 
deployment? Will you permit the environment to be taken offline during a 
change window, or must you maintain constant availability? 
 Uptime and performance 
service level agreements 
 Are you making commitments to the availability of Sitecore? 99.9% allows 
8 hours, 45 minutes of downtime per year. 99.999% (“three nines”) only allows 
about five minutes per year. You likely need granular SLAs for each service 
supporting Sitecore because various outages may or may not be acceptable 
(e.g. content delivery vs. content management, MongoDB vs. xDB processing, 
and core infrastructure components such as SQL Server, server hosts, and 
networking). 
 From a performance perspective, how responsive should the site be? All pages 
should return in <1 second? 
 Each has dramatic infrastructural implications. Three nines will have a much 
larger server footprint than one nine. A guarantee of responsiveness typically 
requires cloud-based auto-scaling and stringent load testing before changes 
can get through the change control. 
 Recovery time objective 
(RTO) 
 If the site goes down, will you provide a guarantee of when it will be 
brought back up again? 4 hours? 1 hour? 24 hours? This can have dramatic 
infrastructural implications. 
 Recovery point objective 
(RPO) 
 If the side goes down, how much data loss is acceptable? 4 hours of data loss? 
1 hour? None? This can have dramatic infrastructural implications. 
 Procedures 
 Defined  procedures help you align on how you and your team will respond to certain events or requests. 
You can also set good expectations with your stakeholders along the lines of who to contact, how to submit a 
request, what their expected response time should be, and so forth. Documented procedures are an integral 
part of a governance plan. They spell out “how” that work will be done. 
 Tables  9-8 ,  9-9 , and  9-10 have several example procedures you may want to consider for your 
governance plan. These lists are not meant to be exhaustive, but it should give you a good example of the 
types of requests and procedures you should be planning for. There are three main categories of procedures: 
support procedures, content procedures, and environment procedures.  

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
255
 Table 9-8.  Support/Requests Procedures 
 Topic 
 Description 
 New user setup 
 How will you set up new users? Will you have a registration for self-
registration or will you require a manual setup? How will you know what 
security settings are appropriate for different types of new user requests? 
How will you send password information for manual setup? 
 These policies may be different for Sitecore users vs. customer users, etc. 
 Password reset request 
 If a user locked his password, who will he contact to get it unlocked? 
 New module from marketplace 
or third-party add-in request 
 Will you allow the business or others to request modules/add-ins? What 
is your process for vetting these requests? What if they send you some 
code they want you to add into the solution? Will you support that code 
once it’s in the solution? 
 Request for new feature/
component 
 How will the business or other stakeholders request development time 
to implement new feature requests? Will you manage a backlog of 
requests? How are requests approved and prioritized? Where does the 
budget come from for minor, non-project related enhancements? 
 General content editor support 
request 
 Sitecore isn’t the easiest technology to learn. Who will users reach out to 
when they have questions? 
 New campaign landing page 
request 
 Marketing loves spinning up landing pages for their campaigns. Who 
will create them? How are they requested? What features/functionality 
are you offering or limiting them to? How will custom/advanced landing 
page requests be handled? 
 Table 9-9.  Approvals and Publishing Procedures 
 Topic 
 Description 
 Content update request 
 How will you respond to content update requests from your business or 
partners? Who will they contact? Will you have a ticketing system? What is 
your service level agreement (response time) for low-priority, high-priority, 
and emergency content requests? 
 Content approval request 
 How will you respond to content approval requests from your content editor 
team? Who will they contact? Will you use a workflow or manual process? 
What is your service level agreement (response time) for low-priority, high-
priority, and emergency approval requests? 
 Content publishing 
request 
 Who handles publishing requests? Are they automated into a nightly batch 
publish, or do you want a human actually looking at and vetting requests? 
What is your service level agreement (response time) for low-priority, high-
priority, and emergency publishing requests? What’s your procedure for 
“emergency” requests?

 Ongoing Tasks  and  Audits  
 Each policy discussed in the previous section should have a corresponding  audit task   to ensure compliance 
over time. If you don’t plan on enforcing the policy, the policy shouldn’t exist. Again, you want your 
governance plan to be pragmatic. Individuals should be assigned granular, specific, and measurable tasks 
that ladder up to policies and procedures that form the core of what you want to govern. High-level abstract 
tasks are unenforceable and shouldn’t exist in your governance plan. 
 Procedures, too, should have corresponding tasks. A “new user request” procedure may result in an 
actual person doing some work. That work should be defined, assigned, and estimated for resource leveling 
purposes. 
 Use the format found in Table 9-11 to capture all the tasks coming out of your defined policies and 
procedures. You want to capture the topic/category, the task detail (specific and measurable), the owner/
role (who is assigned to the task), the frequency in which the task will be performed (five times per week, 
weekly, monthly, etc.) and the estimated hours per week that will be spent performing the task. If the task is 
a monthly task, divide by four to come up with an average hourly estimate, for example. 
 
■ Note   It would be redundant to restate all of the policies and procedures in described in the previous 
sections, so the focus in Table  9-11 is more to demonstrate the concept, not to be exhaustive. That, and every 
company is going to identify different policies and procedures, so every company's audit/tasks will be different, 
making an exhaustive list impossible. Rather, consider this a framework you can follow and extend.

 Disaster recovery procedures 
 You may want to identify all your disaster scenarios and have 
recovery procedures for each to offer guidance and sanity 
during an emergency. This is crisis planning and prevention, 
when you consider how the planning will identify gaps you 
may end up filling (such as adding redundancy, etc.).

maintenance plans, checking logs, checking free disk space, 
disposing the Recycle Bin, etc.)?

 Roles and  Responsibilities 
 It is all too common to  start with roles, and then figure out what they are responsible for. The good thing for 
you, is in previous sections, you saw how we started with the  work , from which you can extrapolate the roles. 
Never identity/create a role if you don’t know what the work is and what they are accountable for. Never 
identity high-level, abstract responsibilities. Rather, identify granular, measurable responsibilities to ensure 
the resource really understands their duties. You saw these examples in the previous section. With those 
understood, you can start planning your roles and do some resource leveling. 
 By way of generalization, there are some common Sitecore roles you may end up identifying. They may 
fall along the lines of the following roles:
• 
 Product owner/manager 
• 
 Technical lead/architect 
• 
 Content editors 
• 
 Content approvers 
• 
 Content publishers 
• 
 Marketing analysts 
• 
 Marketing administrators 
• 
 Developers 
• 
 Infrastructure administrators 
• 
 Business analysts 

CHAPTER 9 ■ GOVERNANCE
259
 
■ Note   The product owner is the only role worth defining at this point, because it’s the most important 
role and a role that far too often doesn’t exist. The product owner’s main objective is to ensure Sitecore’s 
(really the digital experiences—it doesn’t have to be technology specific) ongoing alignment to the business’ 
objectives. This person owns the product roadmap. She sets the overall direction for other roles and holds other 
roles accountable to her tasks. She is the one held accountable to ensure governance is actually happening. 
This person should be in the business, usually the marketing department, who often has acumen of a digital 
marketing technologist when owning a product on the Sitecore platform. 
 The names of the roles really aren’t the point. The point is, who is doing what tasks? If you’re assigned 
the marketing analyst, do you understand what that means? Do you know what you’re responsible and 
accountable for? Do you have enough capacity to perform the duties assigned? These are the more 
important conversations than simply getting a list of roles defined. Every list of roles at every company 
will vary, since nobody will have the same list of tasks and priorities needed to governance their Sitecore 
instances. Therefore, focus on the work, not the role, and you’ll be better off because of it. People understand 
tasks; roles can become ambiguous over time. 
 Table  9-12 shows an example resource allocation by role by the accumulated hourly allocation of 
tasks. This is a great way to understand how the work is distributed. This is also where “roles” can break 
down. Maybe the marketing analyst has 28 hours per week of assigned tasks, but only 20 hours per week of 
capacity. There may be tasks the product owner could take off the analyst’s plate to balance the scales. After 
all your tasks are defined in a matrix like Table  9-11 , summarize them in a format similar to Table  9-12 and 
see how the dust settles. Update Table  9-11 if there are over allocations and where it makes sense to move 
tasks onto other, perhaps less obvious choices. Or, this can be a great way to justify adding additional head 
count onto the team to handle the workload.

 Governance  Committees 
 So, you have tasks, you have roles, you have assigned resources, but how do you hold those individuals 
accountable to getting the work done? Unfortunately, it is all too common to establish a governance plan, 
but it peters out over time as people get busy, distracted, reassigned to new priorities, etc. Don’t establish a 
governance plan unless you’re willing to put structure in place to make it long-lasting. 
 A great way to enforce governance accountability is through the use of a committee. Everybody assigned 
a task needs to report back at each committee. This provides awareness, transparency, and accountability to 
getting the work done. It also achieves peer accountability, which is a more reliable way to ensure the right 
things get done (versus a top-down approach). 
 There are three main  committees you should consider. You may tailor this to be more or less depending on 
the size of your organization, inherit risk, and/or frequency of change. Again, the product owner and technical 
lead are the two core team members driving governance adoption, in this case, by facilitating these committees.

 Summary 
 Governance is how you ensure lasting success and value creation of your digital and Sitecore experiences. 
 The Wicklund Framework for Sitecore Governance attempts to be as pragmatic as possible to make 
governance as achievable long term as possible. The framework starts with the rules and defines the work to 
ensure those rules are enforced. That work is then laddered up into roles, whereas most start with abstract, 
poorly understood roles that create an accountability challenge. Roles, then, are held accountable through 
the use of committees. Each role has a duty to summarize their finding since the previous committee 
meeting. The product owner keeps the gears turning, ensuring that the committees meet regularly, and has 
primary accountability of the overall success/failure of the Sitecore installation over time. 
 This is the last chapter in this book, and governance is a fitting place to end. It’s a great place to end 
because, in a very real sense, governance is really the just the beginning of a much larger journey. 
 As a signoff, I want to encourage you to look me up on LinkedIn, check out the book’s web site for 
updates/errata, or drop me a line for help or consulting opportunities. Good luck, and I look forward to 
continuing the discussion with you!

 CHAPTER 10  
 Appendix 
 This appendix covers topics that go a bit beyond the core audience of this book, but which still are applicable 
for those who want to go a bit deeper. These more advanced topics are:
• 
 Data templates —Learn how to create the foundational data structures from which 
all content in Sitecore is create (this section provides some foundational concepts 
introduced in chapter 2) 
• 
 Standard values —Learn how to set default values for fields, default presentation 
and layout settings, and apply workflows to content items through their standard 
value settings 
• 
 Custom workflows —Learn how to build custom workflows 
• 
 Architecture —Learn about server roles, deployment models, authentication options, 
e-commerce solution providers, and CRM integration 
• 
 Federated Experience Manager —Learn how to extend your content and analytics into 
experiences not built on the Sitecore platform 
 Data Templates  
 Data templates are the foundation of your Sitecore deployment. They specify the data fields and many other 
settings that can be applied to content upon creation. For example, you might want to feature a promotion 
of a given product. Both of these items represent content that a marketer will create, test, and perhaps 
personalize based on who the users are and their preferences. Before developers can get started, however, 
they need to configure the data templates that represent these content items, and thereafter they must create 
the components to render the promotions. Let’s get started with creating the data templates. 
 Creating Data Templates 
 We will need two data templates for our promotions example (as discussed in chapter 2). The first data 
template will be the definition for a featured product. The second data template will define the fields and 
settings for the promotion itself. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
264
 
■ Note  You may or may not want to store product information in Sitecore. Product details are often stored in 
your ERP or PIM system, SAP. Other times, it can be helpful to store a subset of product information, such as in 
this case when all we want to do is featured a product. We only need a few basic fields and data duplication is 
kept to a minimum. No doubt, however, this can be a slippery slope, which is why it is so critical to thoroughly 
think through your information architecture before construction begins. 
 For the purposes of demonstration, our  Featured Product data template will have the following fields:
• 
 Product Name 
• 
 Product Description 
• 
 Product Images 
• 
 Related Products 
• 
 MRSP 
 Our  Promotion data template will have the following fields, several of which are inherited from an 
out-of-the-box data template in Launch Sitecore called Promo Spot:
• 
 Title [from Promo Spot] 
• 
 Text [from Promo Spot] 
• 
 Link To [from Promo Spot] 
• 
 Link Text [from Promo Spot] 
• 
 Image [from Promo Spot] 
• 
 Related Products 
• 
 Discount Percentage 
• 
 Target Persona 
 Since a featured product is rather generic and be used for many purposes, that data template is separate 
from the promotion itself to maximize reusability. This is an important point. 
 When considering your site’s information architecture, you must pay careful consideration to 
opportunities for data reusability. Data duplication is never a good idea, Sitecore included. Notice in this 
example how a promotion has a selection of one or more related products. A marketer can, therefore, create 
a new promotion and select which products it relates to. 
 
■ Tip  Plan your site’s information architecture accordingly to allow for maximum reusability of data 
templates. If you have a very large data template with many fields, you likely are ripe for refactoring. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
265
 PRACTICAL TIPS: SET UP YOUR TREEVIEW FOR MULTISITE SUPPORT
 Before we create these data templates we must start by validating the structure of our  treeview . Below 
Templates, it is a best practice to have at least two custom folders: Global and another, one for each 
site. Notice in Figure  10-1 the Global folder. This folder can store all generic templates that do not 
pertain to any particular Sitecore site. Oftentimes in multisite situations you will want to reuse templates 
and this is a perfect way to do this. 
 Figure 10-1.  When you use global folders, it is easier to  share resources should you decide to use Sitecore to 
manage multiple sites 
 By putting them into a Global folder, you can configure permissions on that folder such that marketers 
in the different sites can only see their site and the Global folder for their templates. The alternative is a 
giant mess. Start using the Global folder pattern from the start, regardless if you think you will never need 
multiple instances. If you change your mind down the road, this pattern will save you a ton of rework! 
 Notice also the Launch Sitecore folder. This folder is for the site instance and its name will be a name 
your marketers will easily recognize when differentiating the sites. 
 
■ Note In general, you will not be putting anything in any of the other folders below Templates besides the 
ones you create. If you didn’t create it, don’t touch it!  
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
266
 To follow best practice, I will be creating both data templates in the Global folder, and the appropriately 
named, Content Templates folder, as both are highly reusable in the future should we expand into a multisite 
scenario. Use the following steps to configure the two data templates:
 
 1. 
 From the Sitecore Launchpad, click Content Editor. 
 Select the Templates node in the treeview. If a Global folder or site instance folders do not exist, 
create two new folders by clicking the Template Folder item in the Insert Options picker within the ribbon 
(Figure  10-2 ). Type an appropriate name and click OK. 
  Figure 10-2.  You want to create custom folders below the main nodes, rather than add your items to the root 
of nodes  directly 
 
 2. 
 Similarly, create a Content Templates folder below Global.  
 
 3. 
 Right-click the Content Templates folder you just created and select Insert ➤ New 
Template from the drop-down. 
 
 4. 
 Provide Featured Product as the template name and leave the base template set 
to Standard Template (more on inheritance later).  
 
 5. 
 Click Next and confirm the location is Content Templates. Click Close. 
 
 6. 
 Lastly, we need to set an icon for the node. Within the Ribbon, click the 
Configure tab. In the Appearance ribbon section, you’ll notice an Icon 
drop-down. Select an icon of your choosing. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
267
 
■ Tip   Icons are important! It is very easy to get lost in the Sitecore treeview. Using custom icons with 
commonly used nodes helps increase usability and speed of administration. 
 Repeat these steps for the  Promotion data template. The only difference with Promotion is that it 
will  not inherit from standard template but rather from Promo Spot. This template has some standard 
properties and will allow us to tie it into the out-of-the-box promo component that comes with Launchcore. 
Inheritance will be discussed in greater detail in a later section. Afterward you’ll have two empty data 
templates ready for configuration! 
 
■ Note  These steps are continued in the “Completing Our Templates” section later in this appendix. 
 Data Template Fields 
 We know what  fields we need for our Featured Products and Promotions data templates, but before we 
go off the deep end and start creating them, there is some more requirements gathering we need to do. 
Much will be said of the myriad of settings that can be applied to data templates throughout this section, 
but fundamentally you must consider Sections, the field’s Type, its Source, and Versioning requirements 
(ideally) before building (Figure  10-3 ). 
 Figure 10-3.  Fields have five common properties, including their Name, Type, Source, and versioning 
requirements, either Unversioned and/or Shared 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
268
 Field Sections 
 Field  sections are a great way to organize your fields by categories. From a Content Editor’s perspective, the 
field sections will appear as an expandable/collapsible accordion. Figure  10-4  demonstrates this, where 
Home, Menu Item, and Site Root (among others) are that item’s field sections. 
 Figure 10-4.    Field sections allow you to categorize your fields. This makes content administration easier when 
you have a lot of fields       
 Field Types 
 There are  many field  types to choose from! A field type establishes the format the data will be stored in. For 
example, a Number column requires a number value, whereas a Single-line text column can take any set of 
characters, letters, numbers, or otherwise. Table  10-1 shows the various field types explains what they are 
and how they work.

 Table 10-1.  Field Type Descriptions 
 Category 
 Field Type 
 Description 
 Analytics 
 Profile Card Value 
 This field type allows the marketer to select a profile/persona that 
can be associated to the piece of content. You will almost never 
need to use this field as it’s already in the standard template. 
 Analytics 
 Profile cards 
 Similar to Profile Value, but more robust, accommodating other 
settings such as user segment, information type, and score. 
 Analytics 
 Tracking 
 This is an important field, allowing marketers to associate 
campaigns, goals, events, and other settings to a piece of content. 
 Simple Types 
 Checkbox 
 Stores a simple Boolean, Yes/No value. 
 Simple Types 
 Date 
 Stores a date. You can use the  $date  token in the standard values 
for the replacement of the current date upon a new item creation. 
 Simple Types 
 Datetime 
 Stores a date and a time. You can use the  $date and  $time  tokens in 
the standard values for the replacement of the current date upon a 
new item creation. 
 Simple Types 
 File 
 The File field allows users to “attach” files to the content. The user 
can select files from the Media Library to attach, or upload new ones. 
 Simple Types 
 Image 
 Similar to File but specific for images. Images rendered with 
FieldRenderer can have a MaxWidth applied. When applied, 
Sitecore will cache a resized image according to that width, thus 
speeding up download times. This offers a significant advantage 
over the File field when working with images. 
 Simple Types 
 Integer 
 Only takes a number with zero decimal places. 
 Simple Types 
 Multi-Line Text 
 Allows for multiple lines of text. 
 Simple Types 
 Number 
 Takes any number, with or without decimal places. 
 Simple Types 
 Password 
 Offers the user a text box but blurs the text so onlookers cannot see 
the value. 
 Simple Types 
 Rich Text 
 Similar to multiline text, except that it offers a rich text editor to aid 
content editing. The text is stored as XHTML rather than straight text. 
 Simple Types 
 Single-Line Text 
 Straight text line with no rich text and no carriage returns. 
 Simple Types 
 Word Document 
 Allows for a Word document to be attached to the item, with links 
for Edit and Download. Inline editing of the document is only 
supported on IE.

 Allows the user to check multiple checkboxes. The datasource can 
be set to an item in the tree, and items below that parent item will 
appear as selectable options.

 Description 
 List Types 
 Droplist 
 Similar to Checklist except it renders a drop-down instead of 
selectable checkboxes. The disadvantage is you can only select 
one option in this case. Note: Only the item name is stored, not an 
actual link to the item in the database. Therefore, use this sparingly 
if at all to avoid broken links. As an alternative use Droplink 
whenever possible. 
 List Types 
 Grouped Droplink 
 Similar to Droplist except that the grandparent is set to the 
datasource. In this case, the child items are the “groups” in the 
drop-down and their children then become the options. Note: 
Droplink stores the ID of the item selected and is a better option 
than Droplist. 
 List Types 
 Grouped Droplist 
 Similar to Grouped Droplist except only the value is stored. Use 
sparingly if at all. 
 List Types 
 Multilist 
 Shows the left/right selector to select multiple items with left/right 
arrows. Also allows sorting on the selected items, perhaps making it 
preferable to Checklist. 
 List Types 
 Multilist with 
Search 
 Similar to Multilist but with the addition of a search box to allow 
users the ability to search for items instead of trying to find them in 
a list. This is helpful for large lists. 
 List Types 
 Name Lookup 
Value List 
 Similar to Name Value List in that this field lets you store key/value 
pairs, but it also lets you set a datasource from where to allow the 
user to pick the key/values from. 
 List Types 
 Name Value List 
 This field type helps you store a collection of key/value pairs. 
 List Types 
 Treelist 
 Similar to the Multilist but rendered via a treeview versus a flat list. 
There are also many configurations you can set to include/exclude 
what shows up in the treeview. 
 List Types 
 TreelistEx 
 Similar to the Treelist but the tree is collapsed on load, making 
load time faster as items are fetched only upon the user expanding 
that item. 
 Link Types 
 Droplink 
 One of the best, most commonly used types for storing drop-down 
values, as it links directly to the item in the database and thus the 
solution is safer from broken links. 
 Link Types 
 Droptree 
 Similar to Droplink but renders a treeview instead of a normal 
drop-down. 
 Link Types 
 General Link 
 Standard linking ability, commonly used for linking to external 
sites or if the user needs to add link settings, such as targeting a 
new window or calling JavaScript upon click. 
 Link Types 
 General Link with 
Search 
 Similar to General Link except it also provides the user a search box 
to search for items. 
 Link Types 
 Version Link 
 Clones use this field to track an item’s ID, language, and version 
number when cloning.

■ Note  There are  many very helpful (and free) custom field types you can download and install. Some 
examples are a Google Maps location picker, a color picker, and a multiple image selector. See the following 
blog post, which summarizes all the cool stuff out there:   http://bit.ly/1DxntPv . 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX

 Field Sources 
 Field  sources help you determine where content should be coming from. For example, when you want to 
associate an image to a news article you’d expect to be able to browse for images. However, what if you have 
hundreds or thousands of images? The source on a field helps you set a destination from where to select 
images (really any content; image are just an example). Perhaps there is a specific folder within the Media 
Library that you want all news articles to draw from. By putting that folder’s path into the source field, you 
are limiting marketers to select just that folder’s items and its descendants. Notice in Figure  10-5  the carousel 
item’s images are limited to the Carousel Backgrounds path. 
 Figure 10-5.    Selecting from thousands of items can be impossible. Use the Source column to limit the selector 
to specific locations to make it easier to find the right assets 
 
■ Note  The field source format can vary. Sometimes a GUID is needed, sometimes an URL. Most of the 
time, a developer sets up the fields and you’ll want to confirm the technical requirements/limitations of their 
configuration. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
273
 Field Versioning 
 An item in Sitecore can have multiple  versions . These versions might be for languages, or perhaps you’re 
doing some A/B testing and want to test a few options before making a final decision. Some fields you 
may want all versions to share the data. Other fields you might want each version to specify its own value. 
Language translation would be a good example that, where each field shown to users must be translated, but 
other fields used to control logic, such as numeric values or images, you might want shared. 
 There are two checkboxes on each field: Unversioned and Shared. Shared specifies that this field is 
likely numeric or an image, or possible an internal field used for rules and each version across all languages 
should share the value when checked. You check unversioned when you want all versions within a specific 
language to share a value. In this case, all English versions would share the value, but all Spanish versions 
would have a different value. The default is that neither Unversioned nor Shared are checked. In this case, 
all values across all versions across all languages will have unique values. Say that five times! For all practical 
purposes, however, unversioned is rarely used. 
 
■ Note  You can check both Shared and Unversioned; the two are actually mutually exclusive, and the default 
would be Shared in this scenario. Using Unversioned or Shared also means that the field is not subject to 
workflow, which is an important consideration. 
 Field  Validation 
 You can add field validators to enforce data integrity in your solution. For example, you may want to require 
all images to have an ALT tag set to get the most out of your search engine optimization. It is simple to add 
the Image Has Alt Text field validator to each of your image fields has an ALT tag. There are a few dozen 
validators such as this one that comes out of the box. You can also have your developers build custom 
validators for unique scenarios. 
 To add validators to a field, expand the data template’s field section in the treeview that contains the 
field you want to modify. Select the field in the treeview. With the field selected you will notice a Validation 
Rules section below the Quick Info and Data sections. The Validation Rules section has four fields you can 
configure.
• 
 Quick Action Bar —Used to add the red/yellow notifications in the gutter in the 
treeview (Figure  10-6 ). These can help you spot validation errors even when you are 
not actively editing an item. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
274
• 
 Validate button —Used to add the validation feedback in the validation results 
pop-up when the Validation button is manually clicked in the ribbon (Review tab, 
Proofing section, Validation button). 
• 
 Validation bar —When you’re on an item, you will notice little red icons to the right 
of the item showing how many fields are failing validation (Figure  10-12  shows four 
fields failing validation). 
• 
 Workflow —This section can be used to enforce validation rules before a workflow is 
allowed to progress from one state to another. 
 It is simple enough to add the validations to these sections. Simply find the validator you want to 
enforce and double-click it to move it to the right. Save the field item and the validator is now in effect for all 
item instances created from this template. 
 Completing the Templates 
 With a more robust understanding of how data templates works, you can now complete the build-out of the 
Featured Product and Promotion data templates. Run the following steps to complete the  configuration  :
 
 1. 
 Click inside the Add a New Section text box and add a section called Product 
Details or Promotion Details. 
 
 2. 
 Add the fields for the Featured product data template (Product name: single-
line text, Product description: multi-line text, Product image: image, Related 
Products: multilist with search, MRSP: number) and the Promotion data 
template (Related Products: multilist with search, Discount Percentage: integer, 
Target Persona: profile cards). 
 Figure 10-6.  Validators can help you enforce data integrity. There are several places where you are notified 
when an item fails its validation: in the gutter (left), in the validation bar (right), and in the validation pop-up 
when you try to save it 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
275
 
 3. 
 The Source field properties were set in Chapter   2 . 
 
 4. 
 Set the Image field as Shared, since we want all versions across all languages to 
share the same image. 
 
 5. 
 Set Related Products and MRSP to Unversioned, as we want to share the value 
across all versions within a given language. For example, China/Mandarin will 
have a different MRSP than France/French, but Mandarin variations should 
maintain the same MRSP. 
 
■ Note  These steps are continued later in this appendix. 
 Data Template Inheritance 
 Data template  inheritance is a great way to create a hierarchy of information and maximize reusability of 
templates. It is a best practice to break your experience’s information architectures down into reusable 
pieces and extend from there. Our customer Promotion data template inherits from Promo Spot. This allows 
us you use a wider variety of components. A developer can build components for Promo Spot and the 
marketer can use those for product promotions, whitepaper promotions, e-mail promotions, and so forth. 
Inheritance is what enables this reusability, and in turn, significant cost savings for development time and 
maintainability. 
 
■ Tip   Make your inheritance broad, not deep. Breadth tends to beget reusability, whereas depth tends to 
beget hierarchy and rigidity. Two to three layers of hierarchy is about all you should allow yourself or you risk 
losing the benefits of reusable templates and components. 
 There are some gotchas to be aware of. For example, you might have a base template that has a Title 
field, and then unknowingly you create a Title field in one of the child templates. In this case when the 
marketers go to edit that content, they see two separate title fields and are left unsure which one to use. 
Developers, likewise, are confused as how to programmatically retrieve what seems like duplicate data, 
when in reality the marketer could enter two separate values. 
 This behavior is also true with section names. The sections of a data template always collapse into their 
parentage and appear at the same level as parent sections. It will confuse your end users if your section’s 
names are the same as the parent’s names. The best practice for both is to prefix names with the template 
name if you are worried about duplicates. 
 
■ Tip   Never duplicate field or section names. If you have a child template, use the same field name as 
defined in a parent. You can’t be sure which field will be rendered. It is safest to prefix the field name with the 
template name to differentiate fields. 
 A Data template can inherit more than one item. In this case, the combined fields from all the templates 
that the template inherits from will be consolidated in the Content Editor. Template inheritance can also be 
circular. For example, a product promotion can inherit from a Promo Spot and a callout. A callout can inherit 
from a Promo Spot, too. In this case, again, all the fields are consolidated rather than showing duplicates. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
276
 It is also important to note that data templates can only inherit one set of presentation details. If 
a template inherits from two templates and both have  presentation details , only the first template’s 
presentation details in the inheritance list will be used. This can oftentimes be confusing for marketers who 
are unsure as to why their content isn’t displaying as they had assumed it would. A personal best practice 
I have come to appreciate here is to have three types of data templates: those containing fields, those 
containing presentation details, and those containing a combination. This way you can have the third type 
become a compilation of fields and one set of presentation details. A good naming convention can help 
distinguish between the two and make it easier to understand what is driving the presentation. Additionally, 
this is another way to create a broader, more reusable set of templates, as you may find yourself wanting to 
inherit some fields from a parent but not its presentation details. 
 
■ Tip  Use three types of data templates to keep your information architecture broad and reusable: 
1) templates containing fields, 2) templates containing presentation details, and 3) templates combining 
the two. The first two should never inherit from each other, and the third should never inherit from other 
combination templates, if possible. 
 One way to  structure your Templates folder according to this best practice can be seen in Figure  10-7 
(using a Hero Image Rotator as an example, such as you’d commonly find on a home page): 
 Figure 10-7.    Structure your data templates in three categories: 1)  field templates , 2)  presentation templates , 
and 3)  combination templates 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
277
 Field Templates 
• 
 Title and Text Template (contains a Title and Text fields, plus perhaps other fields to 
control formatting) 
• 
 Image Template (contains an Image field, plus perhaps other fields to control 
formatting) 
 Presentation Templates 
• 
 Image Background Template (contains components to render a generic image)  
• 
 Title and Text Template (contains components to render a generic text and title)  
• 
 Rotator Template (contains components to swap out a DIV with new data) 
 Combination Templates 
• 
 Hero Image Rotator Template (inherits from Title and Text field template, Image 
field template, Image Background presentation template, Title and Text presentation 
template, and Rotator presentation template) 
 
PRACTICAL TIPS: COPYING, MOVING, AND SORTING, OH MY!
 
 It’s easy enough to copy, move, and duplicate data templates and  content (really anything within the 
Content Editor). However, there are a few gotchas. You don’t want to be in a position of explaining to 
your boss why your actions resulted in data loss! 
 First, when you change  a  piece of content’s template to a different template, Sitecore will attempt to 
transfer the data stored in the old template to the new template. It does this first by attempting to match 
field ID, where the data is moved when there’s a match. Secondly, it attempts this based on field Name, 
and likewise moves the data when there is a match. Beware that when a match is not found the data 
is permanently lost as a result of the change template action! You should carefully plan the source to 
destination mapping before taking these sorts of actions or you risk data loss. In cases where data loss in 
anticipated but not acceptable, you will need to perform this administrative action via a PowerShell script. 
 It should also be noted that the Rich Text Editor does not handle copying content well. If you have a node 
in the treeview that needs to be copied, any copied content with links to other copied content below 
that node will maintain their link back to the original content, not the copy. One would expect links in the 
descendants of the copied content to be updated to point to the newly copied content. Again, PowerShell 
might be a way to search for and fix the broken links, or you could tap into the pipeline and watch for 
copy or duplication events to handle them accordingly. 
 Developers often refer to content items or templates by their internal IDs. Be advised that copy 
operations result in a new ID, which may result in existing code not working with the newly copied 
content or templates. Again, a more reusable option is to extend and flatten your information 
architecture. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
278
 Working with  Standard Values  
 Standard values is an important concept in Sitecore. Some might argue that a better name for it is “default 
values” because it’s a way to assign default values to items upon their creation. However, standard values do 
a lot more than that, so perhaps that’s why they have a more generic definition. 
 
■ Tip  As a best practice, each data template should have standard values assigned. Standard values are 
typically configured by developers. 
 Standard values can have the following  types of defaults:
• 
 Default field values 
• 
 Insert options 
• 
 Presentation details 
• 
 Workflow 
 The rest of this section will cover each of these four types of values that can be applied to data templates. 
 
PRACTICAL TIPS: RESETTING TO STANDARD VALUES
 
 There may be times when you want to revert an item’s settings  back to standard values of the template 
it was created from. You can revert field values, presentation settings, and insert options back to the 
template’s standard values. The following shows where in the ribbon you can find each of these buttons:
 Field values —Versions tab ➤ Reset button in the Fields section 
 Presentation —Presentation tab ➤ Reset button in the Layout section  
 Insert options —Configure tab ➤ Reset button in the Insert Options section  
 After you click these Reset buttons, the content items values/settings will again reflect the standard 
values of their templates. 
 Configuring Default Values 
 A new data template does not have the ability to assign standard values. You first need to add a standard 
values item to the data template. One of the most confusing things about standard values is that the data 
template item and the standard values item for that data template look identical. It is common to apply 
settings to the data template thinking you are applying standard values and you are not. 
 You can tell if you have a standard values item or not by looking below the data template. Notice in 
Figure  10-8  how the Product Promotion data template has a __Standard Values item below it. This child item 
is where you will assign your standard values. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
279
 To create this standard values item, select the data template and then click the Builder Options tab. 
Click Standard Values below the Builder Options tab and you will notice the new standard values item appear. 
 You can start assigning default field values when you click the standard values item. Notice how 
Figure  10-9  shows the standard values item selected with the fields showing. You can set default values by 
entering data into those fields and thereafter saving the item. Then, when users create new items from that 
data template, those values will be present in the new item by default.  
 Notice also the $ tokens in Figure  10-9 . Tokens are  replaced   during item creation with dynamic values. 
For example,  $name is replaced with the item name during creation. In Figure  10-10 , you’ll notice an item 
created with the name “Phil test” and the $ name token was replaced as expected. The following are the 
supported tokens: 
• 
 $name : The name of the item 
• 
 $id : The ID of the item 
• 
 $parentid : The ID of the item’s parent 
• 
 $parentname : The name of the item’s parent  
• 
 $date : The system date ( yyyyMMdd ) 
• 
 $time : The system time ( HHmmss ) 
• 
 $now : The date and time ( yyyyMMddTHHmmss ) 
 
■ Note  Developers can create custom tokens. Check out the following blog post:   http://bit.ly/1zflAW8 
 Figure 10-8.  You set up  default values within a data template's __Standard Values item 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
280
 Figure 10-9.    Tokens allow your default field values to be somewhat  dynamic , such as replacing $name with 
the name of the item 
 Figure 10-10.  Notice how each of the tokens was replaced with its dynamic value at creation time 
 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
281
 
■ Note  Layout deltas are an important concept in template inheritance. When an item receives its values 
from its template’s standard values and those values are changed, the link back to the standard values is not 
broken. Rather, a “layout delta” is created to track just the delta from the standard values. If the standard values 
are updated later, all item field instances will be updated where there is no delta. 
 Configuring  Insert Options 
 Only administrators can add content or folders in the content tree, unless you specify insert options that 
allow non-admins to create content specifically permitted within that folder. The Insert From Template 
option allows an admin to select from all data templates that exist, but that option is only available to 
admins. It is important, then, to specify insert options, since marketers can’t create content if you don’t. 
Additionally, you want to control what content goes where. Insert options become your way to enforce an 
information architecture and prevent the “wild, wild, west” where users are adding content in places they 
shouldn’t or simply wouldn’t make sense. 
 It is very simple to set up Insert options on a data template’s standard values. Simply click the __Standard 
Values item below the data template and click the Assign button in the Configure tab below the Insert Options 
section. You can then use the selector to select which data templates should appear as insert options when 
users are creating new items. 
 When complete, the Insert drop-down menu should look something like Figure  10-11 (note again that 
only admins will see the Insert from Template option). 
 Figure 10-11.  Insert options allow you to control your information architecture by limiting which types of 
items can be created where 
 Presentation and Applying Layouts 
 It was previously mentioned that everything below the Home node within the Content tree is URL 
accessible. It is important to note, therefore, that everything below the Home node needs a layout assigned 
that will tell Sitecore how that piece of content (such as a page) should be rendered when a user navigates 
to it. A layout has placeholders where users can add/remove/configure  components . Components render 
content. Figure  10-12 shows this hierarchy. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
282
 Figure 10-12.     Layouts   contain placeholders with components that render content items       
 
■ Note  This section is where the target audience for this book is stretched a bit. Creating layouts and 
applying placeholders in the code is a development topic covered elsewhere, most notably Sitecore official 
developer training. The goal of this section is to give marketers and admins a basic understanding of layouts 
and placeholders so they can be empowered to do basic administration of them, as well as provide better 
instruction to developers regarding their requirements for their layout and placeholder needs. 
 For those who want a primer into Sitecore development, to build layouts, components, etc. as described next, 
check out this helpful video tutorial on YouTube:   http://bit.ly/1IjI1LI 
 Notice how this layout example has some hard-coded content at the top and bottom. A layout is 
basically an HTML file with HTML code in it and placeholders for marketers to administer components. 
You may opt to hard-code basic things, such as the company logo or the footer. However, it is a best practice 
to build as much as possible as components within placeholders to give marketers as much freedom as 
possible to control the presentation of the site. 
 Below the static content there are several placeholders. A developer can put as many placeholders on 
the page as they want or you ask them to. They can orient those placeholders in any configuration you may 
want, such as one column, two column, or whatever. An empty placeholder will collapse, so there’s not 
worry about having more than necessary. However, some prefer the simplicity of many layouts with different 
configurations to, say one single layout with endless possibilities. A marketer may understand what “Layout 
with 2 Columns” versus, say a layout named “Main” with 15 columns/row combinations. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
283
 Notice also in Figure  10-12 how each placeholder has a unique key. End users and marketers will not 
need to know this key if they are administering the page through the Experience Editor. However, they will 
need to know the key if they administer the page through the Content Editor. So, it helps to have placeholder 
key names that make sense. Notice in Figure  10-13 a real-world example (Launchcore example) of a slew of 
placeholder orientations, each with common sense names. 
 Figure 10-13.    Your  placeholder design   is very important. You want to empower marketers with flexibility to 
meet changing presentation demands 
 You can create new placeholders by simply right-clicking the folder below Layout ➤ Placeholder 
Settings, and choosing the new Placeholder insert option. However, it will require a developer to add that 
placeholder either onto a layout or within a component (see sidebar “Use Nested Placeholders”) before a 
user or marketer can add components into it on a page. Additionally, you can configure allowed controls 
on a placeholder from the Content Editor, as can be seen in Figure  10-14 . It was previously shown how you 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
284
can configure allowed controls (components) from the Experience Editor. Here is an alternative location to 
perform the same configuration. As a reminder, the allowed controls setting controls which components 
can be added to a placeholder. You can use this to enforce an information architecture on your site, such as 
keeping wide controls out of the right rail, or keeping tall controls out of the footer. 
 Figure 10-14.  Placeholder allowed controls lets you configure which components are permitted to be added to 
which placeholders. Yet another way to enforce your  information architecture 
 
PRACTICAL TIPS: USE NESTED PLACEHOLDERS TO ENABLE 
ULTIMATE LAYOUT FLEXIBILITY
 Imagine a  moment  that Component A as seen in Figure  10-12 has placeholders in it. Can a component 
render placeholders? Yes! Let your imagination run wild for a minute—this enables infinite flexibility for 
marketers! 
 Instead of creating 12 layouts, each with different patterns for placeholder orientation, you should create 
one single layout with one single placeholder: A “Main” layout with a “Main” placeholder. 
 Sounds limiting? Not if you have components that render placeholders. Perhaps you had three 
components called “Two Column,” “Single Column,” and “Three Column”. You could simply add these 
three components to the “Main” placeholder within the layout. Then, within those components you have 
child placeholders you could then add your child components to. 
 This pattern gives unlimited freedom to marketers to design a page however they might wish. They can 
add as many “placeholder components” as they like, without needing to go back to a developer to ask 
for yet another one-off layout design to meet the needs of a specific use case. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
285
 While this seems like dream land, it does come with a cost. The cost is that the marketer will only be 
able to design these pages in the Experience Editor. The reason is the placeholder keys need to be 
dynamic (GUIDs). Imagine you have two of the same components on the page each rendering the same 
placeholders. Since a layout cannot have more than one of the same placeholder key, the code needs to 
create a dynamic key name using a GUID. A market won’t know what this value is and therefore cannot 
administer the layout in the Content Editor. This is likely not a problem since most users will opt for the 
Experience Editor anyway. 
 It’s a bit of a trick to setup dynamic placeholders. Check out this popular blog post for more details: 
 http://bit.ly/1jUMo2P . Alternatively, the SCORE framework from Brainjocks also enables this. 
See   http://brainjocks.com/company/score . 
 Layouts, like placeholders, can also be created in the Content Editor. Again, however, you will need a 
developers help before they can be used. You can create layouts below the Layout ➤ Layouts folder by 
right-clicking and adding the new layout (preferably below a custom folder). Notice the Path property, 
as seen in Figure  10-15 . This needs to be set to the relative path of a HTML file on the server, in the 
 inetpub\wwwroot\[site] folder specifically. A developer can create and publish this HTML file, with 
placeholders, etc. coded therein. 
 Figure 10-15.  A Layout within Sitecore is a pointer to a file on the  file system that controls where placeholders 
are rendered 
 The  Experience Editor can be used to add/remove/configure components on a page. However, that 
page first needs a layout or you won’t even be able to browse to it to launch the Experience Editor in the 
first place. Notice in Figure  10-16 how the Glossary page was assigned to use the Main layout to control its 
rendering behavior. You can check which layout a page is assigned by clicking the content item (page), and 
then selecting Details from the Presentation tab’s Layout section. The Layout Details settings box is often 
called the PLD (pronounced plyd). Within the PLD you can also notice which controls are added onto the 
page, as well as what placeholders on the layout. You can click on a control to change its placeholder. You 
can also click the placeholder to update its settings, such as the placeholder ID. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
286
 You can similarly add/remove/configure components in this setting pop-up (Figure  10-17 ) much like 
you can in the Experience Editor. By clicking Edit below the device, such as the default device, you can select 
which components you want on that page, as well as assign a layout to that device. Notice the 
Layout, Controls, and Placeholder Settings tabs in the Edit pop-up (Figure  10-17 ). The Layout tab shows 
a drop-down from which you can select the layout for the device. The options are selected from the items 
below the Layout ➤ Layouts path in the content tree. 
 Figure 10-16.    You can still manage a page's settings from the content tree if you don't want to use the 
Experience Explorer       
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
287
 Figure  10-17  shows the Controls tab, allowing you to select which controls you want on the layout and 
which placeholders they will slide into. Here is where you need to know the placeholder key, whereas in the 
Experience Editor knowing the key is unnecessary. When you click a component you can edit its settings, 
much the same as from the Experience Editor. 
 The Placeholder Settings tab shows all the placeholders assigned to the layout. You can add/remove/
configure placeholders. By clicking Edit on the placeholder you are essentially loading the same settings 
menu that would appear if you can selected it from the content tree. This essentially is just a shortcut as well, 
but it is also how you can override global placeholder settings in a particular item or its Standard values.   
 One thing you may have noticed in Figure  10-16 are the two tabs at the top of the PLD settings pop-up: 
Shared Layout and Final Layout. This is when we start to segue back into the standard values conversation. 
The Shared Layout tab shows the settings for that page, which are shared across all versions, likely deriving 
their settings from the page’s data template’s standard values if they hadn’t yet been changed. The Final 
Layout reflects the selected version’s modifications. For example, the China/Mandarin version might have 
additional components than the US/English version. Likewise, if you have a weekend promotion, the page 
 Figure 10-17.    You can edit which components are in which placeholder on which layout from the  content tree         
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
288
version that will be published just Friday through Saturday may have a delta from its standard values. The 
Final Layout tab shows what that version’s unique configuration is apart from the default configuration. If 
you need a refresher on versioning, refer back to an earlier part of this appendix: Data Templates ➤ Field 
Versioning. The concept of field versioning likewise applies to the PLD. 
 Now that we have a bit of an  overview of layouts and placeholders under our belt, let’s configure some 
settings on our data template’s standard values so that all new instances not only receive default field values, 
but also default presentation settings. You configure the PLD on a data template’s standard values much in 
the same way as it’s configured on a content item. Simply click the Data Template, and expand it to show 
the __Standard Values item. With the standard values selected, click Details from the Presentation tab’s 
Layout section (hence again the plyd). From there you can configure all the aforementioned settings, and 
upon new item creation the new items will take these settings as their defaults. Once again, as with standard 
values, if the standard values are updated later all instances will receive those updates. It’s a great way to get 
reusability out of your PLD settings. 
 Creating a Custom Workflow 
 The out-of-the-box regular workflow has three states, but the custom workflow created in this section will 
have four. Our goal is to add a fourth state allowing for a gated publish, so that a publisher is notified when 
new items are awaiting publishing. They at that time may opt to publish immediately, or perhaps bulk up a 
series of items that are all published at once. The publisher will benefit from having a workbox full of items 
waiting for publishing, versus a “Publish Site” bucket where they are not quite sure what will be going to 
production (content delivery servers). The following steps configure this workflow. The  steps are continued 
in Chapter   8 where we apply security for the editor, approver, and publisher roles.
 
 1. 
 Start by creating a new workflow. Within the Content Editor, expand the System 
node and right-click Workflow ➤ Insert Workflow. 
 
 2. 
 Name the workflow Standard Publishing Workflow. 
 
 3. 
 Next let’s add our four states. Right-click Standard Publishing Workflow and 
choose Insert ➤ State. Do this four times, naming the states Draft, Awaiting 
Approval, Awaiting Publishing, and Published. Set a helpful icon for each state. 
 
 4. 
 If you select the Standard Publishing Workflow node you’ll notice it requires an 
Initial State value. Set the initial state to Draft and click Save. Additionally, the 
workflow needs to be aware of which state is the final state. Select the Published 
state and ensure the Final checkbox is selected. 
 
 5. 
 Next add some commands to the states. Below Draft create a new command 
called “Submit for Approval” with the Next state value set to the Awaiting 
Approval state. Below Awaiting Approval, create two states: “Approve and Submit 
for Publishing” and “Reject and Return to Editor,” with the Next State values 
being set to Awaiting Publishing and Draft respectively. Below the Awaiting 
Publishing state, add a command called Publish with the Next State set to the 
Published state. Set helpful icons for each command. 
 
 6. 
 On the Publish command, select the Suppress Comment checkbox. This way, 
the approvers don’t have to enter a comment when they click the command. 
Since the Publish command is publishing approved content there shouldn’t be a 
reason to enter more comments. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX

 7. 
 Next add some actions into the workflow commands. Before a piece of content 
is submitted for approval we want to ensure it passes all of our validation tests. 
Below Submit for Approval, select Insert from Template. Browse to System ➤ 
Workflow ➤ Validation Action and provide Validation as the name. Fill out the 
field values as seen in Figure  10-18 . 
 
■ Note The Validation action will simply execute any field validators you have configured on the data 
template. See the “Field Validation” section in this appendix for a refresher. The point here is simply that an item 
shouldn’t progress in the workflow if it doesn’t satisfy our validation rules. 
 Figure 10-18.    Workflow  validators   are helpful when you don’t want a workflow to advance to the next state 
when the content doesn’t meet your standards or policies 
 
■ Note Max Result Allowed lets you set when the workflow will permit the item being sent for approval to 
move forward. Other value options are Unknown, Valid, Suggestion, Warning, Error, CriticalError, and FatalError. 
Perhaps you only want errors to prevent the workflow from progressing, or perhaps suggestions are not 
suggestions at all, but requirements. By changing this value, you can control how strict the validation is. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
290
 
 8. 
 You now need to go to your data template’s fields and specify which validators 
you want to enforce within the workflow. With Standard Fields selected under 
the view tab, expand the Validation Rules section and edit the rules for each 
field you want validators for. Select which rules you want to apply. There are 
many helpful out-of-the-box rules, and you can create your own. The example in 
Figure  10-19 shows us adding a required field validator on the product image, as 
well as requiring ALT text for SEO purposes. 
 Figure 10-19.    Workflow validation rules need to be configured on the  data template’s fields   to tell the 
Validator which validations you want the workflow to concern itself with       
 
 9. 
 Next we want to send an e-mail to notify the approvers that a new piece of content 
was submitted for their approval. Insert a new action from template below Submit 
for Approval again, but this time select the E-mail action and name it “Notify 
Approvers”. Fill out the values and click Save. By default this E-mail action is placed 
above the Validation action; this means the e-mail will be sent before validation 
occurs, which is bad! Click the Notify Approvers action and drag it above the 
Validation action so it won’t send the e-mail if the validation doesn’t pass. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
291
 
■ Note A best practice here would be to use a custom action that points to users in an  Approvers role in 
Sitecore and/or Active Directory. The out-of-the-box action requires you to enter an e-mail address for the 
To/From lines (such as a distribution list for an approvers group) and it would be preferred to have these as 
centralized configuration values in case they change over time. 
 You can add tokens into the e-mail text to help those notified find the item in question. Supported  tokens 
are  $itemPath ,  $itemLanguage , and  $item Version. These tokens are limited in their helpfulness as they 
don’t provide the author’s name, their comments, or a link to preview the item (the path isn’t that helpful). An 
enhanced e-mail action module exists that is easy to install and configure (  http://bit.ly/1GC2UwV ). Using 
this module will greatly increase the helpfulness of e-mails sent by Sitecore’s workflow engine. 
 CONFIGURE INTERNAL PUBLISHING TARGET FOR BROADER REVIEWS  
 The previous note mentioned the fact that you can use tokens in a workflow e-mail to help approvers 
quickly get access to the item to review it. However, what if the approvers are not Sitecore users? There 
are times when you do not want people in Sitecore. Just because someone needs to  approve  something 
doesn’t mean you want them in there poking around and possibly breaking things (take your CMO for 
example, who may need to approve the new home page, but won’t want to learn Sitecore). 
 One option is to create a multitude of roles to accommodate every possible security scenario. But 
that is not always palatable. A second option is to create an internal publishing target so non-Sitecore 
users can see items in a draft state before they are published, but yet without needing to know how to 
navigate around within Sitecore. 
 Dan Cruickshank has a very helpful blog post on how to configure a read-only internal publishing 
target to accommodate scenarios just like this. For larger organization with more complex approval/
governance policies, this pattern may be exactly what you need. 
 Read more at:   http://bit.ly/1zjULjn 
 
 10. 
 Let’s add an auto publish action below the Published state, so that when the 
publisher clicks the Publish command and the state is changed to Published, the 
item is automatically sent to the Web database and published. Below the Publish 
command, insert from template and choose generic Action. Enter  Sitecore.
Workflows.Simple.PublishAction, Sitecore.Kernel for the Type, and  deep=1 
for the Parameters. 
 
■ Note A  generic action is how you can create custom actions for your workflows. Simply add a generic 
action to the workflow and specify the assembly and class name for your action. See the following for more 
details on creating custom actions:   http://bit.ly/1EVwVgu . 
 deep=1 tells the publish action to publish all child items as well. If you don’t want children to be published, 
change this to  deep=0 . Additional  parameters include  related ,  targets ,  alllanguages , and  itemlanguage . 
Go here for more information on these parameters:   http://bit.ly/1KzU0E0 . 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
292
 
 11. 
 Lastly we need to accommodate when a user edits an item while the workflow 
is running. Typically when the item is edited we want the workflow to restart, or 
unapproved changes may inadvertently get published. Notice in Figure  10-20  
the  __OnSave command . This auto-magical command runs whenever an item 
is edited (versus requiring the user to click the command manually) and is 
hidden. Add a new command under each Draft, Awaiting Approval, and Awaiting 
Publishing states to reset the workflow when edited. For each “__OnSave” 
commands, you need to create an action using the Auto Submit Action template, 
setting that action’s Next state value to Draft. The Type for this action is  Sitecore.
Workflows.Simple.AutoSubmitAction,Sitecore.Kernel . The role field can be 
used to limit who can perform this action. Leave it blank since the action should 
reset the workflow regardless of who edits the item.  
 
■ Note  if you would prefer people  not be able to update an item while in an Awaiting Approval or Awaiting 
Publishing states, you can remove the “Workflow State Write” and “Workflow State Delete” roles on those 
states. This tends to slow progress down however, if, for example, an approver is not accessible to reject the 
item, so it’s really up to your process and governance policies. 
 That’s it for now. Actually there’s nothing stopping you from using this workflow immediately, but it 
won’t be that helpful without the proper security applied. Since security in and of itself is a massive topic 
with a lot of context needed, these steps will be continued after that context can be established in Chapter   8 . 
All said and done, your workflow may look something like Figure  10-20 . 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
293
 Sitecore Architecture 
 In this section, we discuss a topic that’s more geared toward the administrator or developer, but that still has 
some relevance to the marketer or the power user. 
 Infrastructure and Services Architecture Options 
 The goal of this section is to give the marketer a high-level understanding of Sitecore’s  infrastructure 
services and deployment options. There are innumerable options when considering a deployment and each 
company should go through an exercise to determine what architecture best meets their needs; however, 
there are a few core concepts that apply to everyone or are common points to extend into your unique 
needs. First we’ll discuss the five types of services/roles that Sitecore requires, and then we’ll discuss three 
common  deployment options  worth considering.
 Figure 10-20.  A  custom workflow  
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
294
• 
 Content Management Server —This server is where authors and marketers go to edit 
content and view the Launchpad. It is common to put this server out of rotation 
(even behind a firewall) to ensure that external users can never get to Sitecore 
administrative interface. 
• 
 Content Delivery Server —This server serves up approved and published content to 
your customers. 
• 
 SQL Server Database Server —You need one or more SQL Servers for the web, master, 
core, and analytics databases. 
• 
 MongoDB Database Server —Every interaction is dumped into a MongoDB database 
to be reported on later. Given the high velocity of data, MongoDB is used for 
performance and scalability needs. 
• 
 xDB Processing Server —This server pulls data out of the MongoDB database and 
stores the data in a relational database optimized for reporting.    
 
■ Note  There are many other infrastructure considerations, such as cloud vs. on premise, physical vs. virtual, 
IaaS vs. PaaS, capacity needs, networking and security, etc. that should be considered but they are far beyond 
the scope of this book. 
 Basic Deployment 
 Figure  10-21 shows a common  deployment for small to medium sized Sitecore installation. It features 
two content delivery servers and a SQL cluster to ensure high availability of the web site, one content 
management server for authors that doubles as the xDB processor, and a MongoDB server for the database. 
 
■ Note  new with Sitecore 8.1 is the ability to deploy Sitecore without MongoDB. It simplifies this 
architecture, but at the cost of analytics and most of the cool marketing features. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
295
 Pros:
• 
 Minimal licensing needs but still achieving high availability for web traffic 
(assumes low traffic volumes) 
• 
 Isolated content authoring experience, security best practice 
 Cons:
• 
 No high availability for MongoDB (could take the site down if the log piles up)  
• 
 No high availability for xDB processing (analytics would be delayed during an 
outage, possibly impacting the customer experience, such as personalization, 
testing, etc., if it’s using old data) 
• 
 No high availability for content management (you won’t be able to make web site 
updates, view reports, etc. while the CM server is down) 
• 
 The CM server will need to be a pretty big box to ensure that marketers can do their job  
 
■ Note  SQL won’t need a cluster if you’re using a PaaS cloud model, otherwise a cluster and/or mirror or SQL 
availability group is strongly recommended. 
 Figure 10-21.    A basic deployment minimizes licensing costs but doesn’t sacrifice high availability for the more 
critical services 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
296
 Pros:
• 
 Isolated content authoring experience, security best practice 
• 
 High availability for MongoDB 
• 
 High availability for xDB processing 
• 
 No concern that xDB processing will negatively impact a marketer’s need to update 
content, etc. 
 Cons:
• 
 Spending more on Sitecore licensing for the separate xDB processing servers and 
server costs to support a MongoDB replica set  
• 
 No high availability for content management 
 Figure 10-22.    Option 2 features high availability through the solution except for the management server 
 Highly Available  Deployment 
 This option (Figure  10-22 ) extends the previous option by adding some high-availability for the backend 
systems. Front-end services such as content delivery and SQL Server are table stakes; hardly anyone 
would be willing to risk the site going down, but there may be more room to discuss tolerance for some of 
the backend MongoDB and xDB processing to go down. If you don’t want to risk it at all spinning up an 
MongoDB replica set and a pair of xDB processing servers will create the confidence you’re looking for 
(again, not taking capacity into account—you may need more). 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
297
 Cloud-Based xDB Deployment 
 This third option (Figure  10-23 ) is similar to the previous two but with the exception that you’re using Sitecore’s 
 xDB cloud server . The main benefit is you’ve outsourced all xDB/MongoDB processing to Sitecore’s cloud. This 
can be significant for companies that don’t want to learn/support MongoDB, a rather new technology. The 
content delivery and content management servers are configured just as the previous deployment options, but 
they point to Sitecore’s cloud rather than to your instances of Mongo or xDB processing.  
 Pros:
• 
 Same as previous 
• 
 You literally never have to worry or think about MongoDB or xDB; it just works! 
 Cons:
• 
 xDB cloud annual licensing costs are significant especially for B2C deployments 
(if you have >2.5 million contacts this option doesn’t make any sense financially) 
 Figure 10-23.    This option removes the worry about xDB and MongoDB altogether by outsourcing to 
Sitecore’s cloud 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
298
 Authentication Options 
 It is common for web sites to require users to log in. You might have an e-commerce site, a customer 
portal, or premium content that requires secure access. There are five main ways you can authenticate your 
customers securely to Sitecore:
• 
 Sitecore User Management/User Profiles —One of the easiest ways is to simply use 
Sitecore to manage your users. Each user setup in the user manager can be given 
a password. You’ll want to set up different “domains” for your customers and your 
employees to help ensure you don’t get your wires crossed.  
• 
 CRM users —Sitecore’s  crm integration modules support two-way contact 
synchronization. These CRM contacts can also be given a password that Sitecore 
manages, thus allowing their authentication. 
• 
 Identity Federation ,  such as Sitecore Social Connected— Federating with Facebook 
or Twitter, for example, is supported through Sitecore’s Social Connected module. 
Additionally, since Sitecore is just another ASP.NET site at its core, you can easily 
set up Sitecore to authenticate with SAML providers (like ADFS or Siteminder) for 
single-sign or for identity federation with partners.  
• 
 Active Directory (AD) ,   Active Directory 1.2 for AD integration  —If you use Active 
Directory to authenticate your employees, you’ll likely want to configure Sitecore to 
accept AD credentials so you don’t have to maintain two users for your employees.  
• 
 Custom providers — You can always write a custom ASP.NET membership provider 
should the previous options not meet your requirements. 
 
■ Tip  You can specify a custom, on-brand login page by updating the  loginPage setting in  web.config 
( configuration/Sitecore/sites/site ). 
 Sitecore  Commerce Solutions 
 Sitecore supports commerce integration through its Commerce Connect interface. You can write your 
own connector, or more likely, you’ll purchase a third-party commerce solution that uses the connector to 
integrate the two platforms. There are many reputable e-commerce solutions, but for Sitecore there are 
three standouts:
• 
 Sitecore Commerce 8 provided by Sitecore and Microsoft leverages Microsoft 
Dynamics AX or Commerce Server as a backend. Sitecore + AX is most common for 
large, enterprise-scale B2C retailers. 
• 
 Active Commerce is an e-commerce solution built right on top of Sitecore itself. 
Active Commerce is common for B2C scenarios but also has a strong B2B customer 
base as well. 
• 
 Insite provided by Insite Software is a common B2B solution, but also supports B2C 
scenarios. 
 
■ Note  Sitecore has a commerce connector called Sitecore Commerce Connect. This connector enables 
integration with any compliant 3rd party that implements the interface, allowing for a fully integrated 
commerce/Sitecore user experience. Insite, for example, integrates through the connector. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
299
 CRM  Integration 
 Sitecore and CRM are better together. There are three core business reasons to consider integrating your 
CRM with Sitecore:
• 
 Better Sales/Marketing Alignment —Let’s face it, sales and marketing are rarely in lock 
step. Marketing has their campaigns, and sales has their relationships. Marketing uses 
Sitecore, and sales uses their CRM. Unfortunately, there is often a chasm between 
these two products. With Sitecore’s ability to track every interaction, it is very easy to 
keep a score and send hot leads over to CRM when certain criteria is met.  
• 
 Better Personalization— CRM is typically the source of truth about a customer. 
However, what good is all that data if it can’t be used to influence your digital 
experiences? You can segment your lists for an e-mail blast, but should your home 
page also look different based on data in your CRM? Don’t let your CRM data sit on 
an island; let it enhance every customer’s experience with your digital properties. 
• 
 360 view of your customer —With Sitecore’s experience profile there is a strong case 
to be made to make Sitecore the center for everything about a customer (whereas 
CRM typically has this role). In an integrated scenario, both CRM and Sitecore share 
insights so there doesn’t need to be a tit for tat; let marketers use Sitecore and let 
sales use CRM but both will have the same data. 
 Fortunately for us, Sitecore has written free modules to help integrate Sitecore and your CRM. There 
is an integrator for Microsoft Dynamics CRM as well as one for Salesforce. These modules are help get you 
started, but you still may find yourself writing a bit of custom code to create the end-to-end integration 
you’re looking for. There are three main ways to integrate CRM into site, as is seen in Figure  10-24 : 
 
 1. 
 The modules support two-way contact synchronization. Contacts in CRM are 
pulled into Sitecore along with any CRM fields you deem appropriate. You 
can even pull in custom fields. For example, maybe you want a contact field 
for “Persona” so your sales team can understand what behaviors this contact 
exhibits on your digital experiences. These insights might help them create a 
more personalize message. The opposite is also true; data in CRM can drive 
personalization in Sitecore. 
 
 2. 
 Code in CRM can call back into Sitecore through Sitecore’s API. Perhaps 
you create a campaign in CRM and you want a corresponding campaign 
automatically set up in Sitecore to ensure both tools are working in tandem. 
 
 3. 
 Chapter   6 described custom actions you can add to your Web Forms for 
Marketers  forms . These actions can create CRM records, such as leads, contacts, 
or activities. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
300
 Federated Experience Manager 
 Sitecore’s  Federated Experience Manager (FXM) has been heralded as a game-changer in the Sitecore 
world. FXM enables a marketer to see customer behavioral data and share Sitecore content across all their 
experience properties regardless of whether they are on the Sitecore platform or not. This enables you to 
maintain a single view of the customer and a single source of content no matter if you’ve upgraded/migrated 
all your digital properties to Sitecore, or if you plan to take a more gradual approach to your migration. 
Examples include Sitecore sites, non-Sitecore sites, and native mobile apps. 
 Additionally, FXM enables better collaboration with partners. You and your partners may want to 
collaborate on customer data. You can ask your partners to deploy the necessary page scripts on their 
properties to send a feed of customer data back to your xDB instance to create a consolidated view. Here are 
a few more examples where FXM can create value for your  marketers  :
• 
 A company hosts sites that cannot be managed by Sitecore (e.g. non-.NET sites or 
apps, such as WordPress or PHP sites) 
• 
 A company wants to better collaborate with their partners 
• 
 A company is in the process of migrating their properties; however, they don’t want 
to wait until they are all migrated before taking advantage of xDB’s capabilities  
• 
 You may be in acquisition mode and need to take control of new properties and 
quickly integrate them into your overall marketing objectives    
 To get started using FXM, open FXM from the Launchpad ➤ Federated Experience Manager tile. The 
page by default looks pretty empty. Click on Add External Website to get started. 
 Figure  10-25  shows the new site form. There are basically two pieces of information you need to add: 
1) the site name and 2) the URL to the site. They name is just a token and can be anything that make sense 
and is descriptive. The  URL needs to be the root path to your site. Fill in this data and click Save.  
  Figure 10-24.    There are three main ways to integrate a CRM: 1) user sync, 2) return service call, and 3) CRM 
API calls or through  WFFM 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
301
 After you click Save you’ll notice the Save button is updated and now shows Publish. Before you publish, 
however, there are a couple more steps to take. First, you need to paste the  script  tag into the head of your 
remote site (found in the Generated Script text box). Second, you need to enable cross-site scripting for your 
remote site.  
 Figure  10-26  shows an example of pasting in the  script  tag into a WordPress site. Simply paste it in 
directly before the  </head> tag, wherever that might be in your remote site’s solution. 
 Figure 10-25.  You can add a site to FXM from the FXM button on the Launchpad 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
302
 Secondly, you need to enable cross-site scripting for the remote site; otherwise, all the JavaScript 
callbacks will be prevented and FXM won’t work. Navigate to the site’s node in the Marketing Control Panel 
➤ Federated Experience Manager. Add a rule similar to what you see in Figure  10-27 by clicking Edit Rule 
below Matching Rule. When this is complete you can go back to the site in FXM and click the Publish button. 
 Figure 10-26.  After you add a new FXM site you'll need to publish the  script tag into the head of the remote site 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
303
 All  remote sites hosted in FXM are managed very similar to other Sitecore sites. Namely, they are 
managed through the Experience Editor. This is nice because it provides a familiar look and feel for 
marketers, thus minimizing a lot of training. However, you need to launch the Experience Editor from FXM. 
Notice the Open in Experience Editor button found in Figure  10-28 . Simply select the site you want to launch 
and then click the button. 
 Figure 10-27.  Because of  cross-site scripting rules , you'll need to explicitly grant access to allow scripts from 
the remote site 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
304
 There are several  unique ribbon actions in the FXM Experience Editor you should be aware of. Here is 
the list of new buttons:
• 
 Assign Marketing Attribute —By clicking this button you’ll see a view of the page with 
all the FXM-aware elements highlighted, such as click actions and placeholders. 
It just helps you see what you’ve already configured.  
• 
 Manage FXM Functions —This pop-up provides a way to manage configurations for all 
the elements you’ve added to the page, such as placeholders or actions (Figure   10-32  ).  
• 
 Add Page Filter —A page filter is a way to add personas, goals, or events at a 
page-level and/or all of a page’s descendants.  
• 
 Capture Click Action —You can register a click action on any element on the page you 
want Sitecore analytics to be notified of when clicked.  
• 
 Add Placeholder —You can add placeholders to the page and then add Sitecore 
content to those placeholders. 
  I’m going to walk you through creating a click action and a placeholder to demonstrate some of the 
coolest FXM capabilities. This example shows integration with a Sitecore site and a WordPress blog. The 
marketing director wants to see an integrated view of analytics across both platforms, as well as enable 
shared “calls to action” promotions between the two. By default, any page with the  script  tag in the head 
will send basic visit data to Sitecore, so our basic analytics are covered. However, what about more granular 
actions? For example, the director wants to record a blog search as 5 value points. To do this, you simply click 
the Capture Click Action button and select the search box, search button, as can be seen in Figure  10-29 . 
Thereafter you’ll be prompted to enter an ID for the action and its parent (Figure  10-30 ). 
 Figure 10-28.    With all the plumbing complete, you can launch the Experience Editor on the remote site 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
305
 Figure 10-29.  You can register different  page elements as "actions" 
 After the search button is made into a click action, you can wire up that click action to a Sitecore goal 
(Figure  10-31 ). Each time there’s a search, that goal will be triggered and the associated engagement value 
will be tallied. At this point you’ll also see the search click action appear in the Manage FXM Functions 
dialog (Figure   10-32  ). 
 Figure 10-30.    Register the page click action       
 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
306
 Figure 10-31.  Page actions can be tracked back to goals set up in Sitecore 
 Figure 10-32.    The  Manage FXM Function menu   shows all the actions set up on the remote site, such as the 
goal we registered earlier 
 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
307
 Adding placeholders is a similar process to adding click actions. Simply click the Add Placeholder 
ribbon button and then click somewhere on the page. Thereafter you’ll notice different places you can add 
a placeholder. Notice how in Figure  10-33 I clicked on the right navigation pane. FXM recognized a DIV 
element that I clicked on. FXM can either replace that DIV with a placeholder or add a placeholder above 
or below it. In my example I want to add a call to action stored in Sitecore above the archives content that is 
part of WordPress, so I clicked Add Before. Like before, I need to add a placeholder ID (Figure  10-34 ). 
 Figure 10-33.    You can also add placeholders to a  remote site  . Simply click Add Placeholder and then click on 
the page where you want the placeholder to go 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
308
 After the placeholder is registered with FXM, you can add  components   into the placeholder much 
like you would on any other ordinary Sitecore page. Simply click Add Here (Figure  10-35 ) and then click 
the component you want to add. After you’ve added a component, you’ll need to select the content that 
component is associated with, much, again, like you would on any Sitecore page. Figure  10-36 shows a 
placeholder with Launchcore’s Promo Spot component added to a WordPress blog page.   
 Figure 10-34.  Similar to a click action,  placeholders also need an ID and must be registered with Sitecore 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ APPENDIX
309
 Figure 10-36.  FXM enables you to browse to your Sitecore content and add it to your  remote experiences         
 Figure 10-35.  After the placeholder is registered, it should look very familiar, just like your other Sitecore 
sites—but in this case it isn't Sitecore! 
 When you’ve completed your changes in FXM and the Experience Editor, simply publish those changes 
like you would any other Sitecore page. Thereafter, your changes will be live on the site and all analytics data, 
such as visits and goals, will be sent to Sitecore just as if it were a Sitecore native site! 
 Summary 
 If you’re reading this, I applaud you. You’re definitely an overachiever!
