Foreword
A book like this has been a long time coming. Being a DBA is not an easy 
calling – especially in today’s world. There was a time when DBAs were 
prized keepers of data within organizations. What we did was a mystery 
to most, but the role was somewhat predictable. With the introduction of 
IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, machine learning, big data, and artificial intelligence, 
the role of the DBA has markedly changed. No two days are even remotely 
alike, and it seems the rate of change has accelerated beyond what most of 
us can comfortably cope with.
Everything evolves and the role of the DBA is no different. What 
separates those who thrive and feel energized from those who feel 
defeated, is whether one sees opportunity or dreads the tsunami of change 
that is upon us.
Michelle is not only a brilliant technologist, data security expert, and 
recognized author – she has also lived the life of a DBA for many years, 
and witnessed the dramatic change in the data ecosystem. Michelle’s 
book describes what the DBA of the future might look like and how 
to achieve success. For the first time ever, data has become a strategic 
resource in many organizations, offering a competitive edge if it is mined 
appropriately. While this poses many questions and raises concerns, it 
also provides immense opportunities for the DBA. No longer is the DBA 
responsible for mundane, predictable work; a whole new world of data 
(not database!) management has opened up that is fluid. The DBA role 
is now no longer rigidly defined but it must be co-created to incorporate 
many facets of data management. It is no longer about the technology, but 
about the enablement of business and strategy through technology.

xii
I have had the pleasure of calling Michelle my friend for years. Michelle 
and I were introduced to each other through IOUG when we were both 
DBAs so we ‘get’ it. This book may surprise, startle, and energize you to 
grasp the future, whatever that looks like. One thing is for certain – you will 
become a better DBA as a result of reading this book. I will leave you with 
an important question to reflect on as you read Michelle’s book: what type 
of DBA do you want to be?

CHAPTER 1
Types of DBAs
My story might be like that of many Database Administrators. I started off 
in database development. I have not met too many DBAs that have started 
right out of school as a DBA, and it seemed normal for the DBA to come 
from development or infrastructure teams.
Database administration is not necessarily a first technology 
job because of the vast knowledge that is needed about databases, 
infrastructure, development, and even the business. Agreed that there 
are also beginning level DBAs that are part of the team or mentored by 
someone, and now with some of the technology advancements and 
features of the database, it is possible to see people starting on this path. 
The other question is if the DBA position was chosen by you, or did the 
position pick you? The accidental DBA or volunteered DBA probably 
received the job because the position was not able to be filled and with 
some additional training, you found yourself in that role.
It seemed like a good opportunity, especially to work with the various 
infrastructure and business teams. This is a major reason for my decision 
to move over into that role. Not only were you a significant part of many 
applications, but the database continued to advance and develop new 
features to support those demands. It was an environment that provided 
challenges, change, and constant learning. Relationships needed to be 
developed with the developers and the business to be able to support their 
needs. The infrastructure teams became our allies as we built systems to 
install the databases. Being in this role allowed me to learn about many 
areas in technology and refine what was needed for business requirements.

2
The skill set of the people to manage the databases and help teams 
get business data in and out quickly has been important in business. 
However, there are discussions with databases and infrastructure going 
to the cloud about whether DBAs are needed. Are we accidentally going 
to become Cloud DBAs? Or is there a different path where these skills are 
needed in an area that will provide different opportunities? This is not the 
first time that DBAs have had this discussion about transitioning, and if 
the role was even needed. It is also not the last time, but the goal here is 
to give direction on what the world of databases will bring as well as the 
surrounding environments of security, data integrations, and cloud. A view 
of the current state of the DBA will help us understand this transition.
The DBA job is not always clearly defined. Do the databases support 
the application development? Are they really part of the infrastructure? 
What about all the moving components from database options to just 
backups, and where are the lines between operating system to application 
code? There are some definite gray areas when it comes to defining what 
DBAs do. It might not always be even understood between teams. I believe 
that it might even be blurrier in the future. There has also been a shift in 
different database platforms too because of how they appear to be easier to 
install and build up and tear down in a development environment. Notice 
I did say appeared to be easier. This is critical in understanding what can 
be provided by the database and making sure that the right database is 
available for the job. DBAs can assist in these areas, but I will discuss that 
more in a later chapter.
I remember first supporting table changes and migrations for the 
development teams. I was also responsible for backups because how could 
I make those changes without the proper backups first. Other times there 
were just the system tasks of backups, restores, replication, server builds, 
and installations. There were also other components that played a part to 
that with high availability and disaster recovery. On the other side there are 
components for performance and tuning with partitioning and material or 
snapshot views.
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

Where Do DBAs Fit?
Organizational placement of the DBA probably gives the first clues as to 
what the tasks are for the DBA. Placement in the organization can show 
whether a DBA is going to be more system and infrastructure support, or 
work closely with the application teams to build and develop applications. 
DBAs can also be found on data services teams that can provide more 
insight around data management than around the database itself.
The organizational chart in Figure 1-1 shows that there are two 
branches that DBAs can be found under. The CIO branch contains 
database teams with the infrastructure teams. This doesn’t necessarily 
mean that all they will do was the infrastructure work, but where they are 
organized as part of the enterprise.
The CTO area should have more of the application direction and will 
find that the DBA teams work more with the developers and manage their 
teams with the database teams. DBAs can find themselves in groups or 
as an individual in these teams. But they seem to have been organized by 
tasks that they normally perform.

Along with the thought that it depends on their tasks, a data services 
team that functions as the DBA team can act as if they are under the Chief 
Data Officer (CDO). This is even a fairly new branch of enterprise and 
not all companies will even have this group. They tend to be your data

management, data analytics, data integrations, and basically anything data 
focused. They sound like a perfect group to partner with as the guardians 
of the data. Another branch that is getting even more popular is the Chief 
Security Officer (CSO). The DBAs might be in the administration role or in 
the security engineering role under the CSO to make sure the databases 
are secure.
The newest group to join in as to where DBAs can fit in an organization 
is the Chief Cloud Officer (CCO). The databases are going be part of the 
cloud solution, and this would make sense as they are either supporting 
the cloud infrastructure or the data that is in the cloud. The organization 
might be like that shown in Figure 1-2.

Figure 1-2.  New Organizational chart to find DBA teams
The following chapters will talk about the different opportunities 
for a DBA to transition into several of these roles. But to transition into a 
different branch of the organization as a DBA or a database engineer takes 
justification. Transitioning varies by organization and what structures 
they already have in place. Even without some of the services or groups, 
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

5
transitioning doesn’t make it impossible to start a group, just a little more 
creativity is required. The point is to be in a group that makes it easy to 
communicate to the teams you need to work with and makes it clear 
what role you are playing. It would not make too much sense to be in the 
Data Management group if all you do are database installs. The different 
alignment will be based on how the group can get the best requirements, 
communication, and delivery of the databases.
As you can see from the different alignment of the DBAs, it might have 
made sense to have a centralized group under the CIO. But now with the 
diversification of the DBAs with skills and focus areas, it seems reasonable 
that there will be smaller groups of DBAs throughout the enterprise. The 
question will be whether they are still called DBAs or have transformed 
into another title. Movement in this direction demonstrates understanding 
of the business needs and how they are using data. It allows you to be a 
valuable part of the team to drive solutions and utilize the data assets.
After seeing where to find the DBA teams, let’s look at the different 
types of DBAs with their tasks so that we can move forward with the future 
transformation. And we can dive into what changes there are for the DBA 
from the current focus because of the databases and infrastructure we deal 
with, and a future state with database as service, as well as other services – 
cloud and even more data coming our way.
System DBAs
The team that is called in to increase the amount of storage to the 
database, or to restore the database or probably most importantly to patch 
and upgrade the database is most likely made up of system DBAs. System 
DBAs have the main task of taking care of the database infrastructure and 
the actual database instance. The configurations include database options, 
parameters, and features of the database.
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

6
With Oracle 12c the system DBAs are going to be taking care of the 
container database (CDB). They will be creating the pluggable databases 
(PDB) and performing cloning and migrations of the pluggables as 
necessary. Depending on if there is a security team handing access, 
system DBAs will be adding users for the PDBs or at least monitoring the 
privileges. The storage will be part of creating the PDB and making sure 
that there is proper capacity for the PDBs in the CDB. The development 
of Oracle 12c naturally separates out the tasks of the system DBA from the 
application DBAs. Microsoft SQL Server also provides this separation from 
the database instance and the user databases.
Note  High Availability options can split up System DBAs even more 
in managing cluster services, Automatic Storage Management (ASM) 
instances and data guard management. It depends on the size of the 
environment, but these roles allow for separation of duties or still part 
of the system DBA team.
As we look through areas that the system DBAs support, keep in mind 
the skills and knowledge it takes to support tasks in these areas. Skills are 
going to be discussed more in the next chapter.
•	
Infrastructure. As part of their job function system, 
DBAs are performing the database creation and 
software maintenance. They have access to the 
database servers and managing the processes, file 
systems, and software binaries for the databases. They 
will be looking at server and network performance and 
verifying that the database processes are all working as 
expected by reviewing the alert and system logs.
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

7
•	
Storage. Planning of capacity includes server resources 
and certainly storage. With ASM, management of 
disks groups and allocations to the databases and 
tablespaces can be part of an ASM administrator  
role, but more likely this falls into the skills of the 
system DBA.
•	
High Availability. Making sure that the databases are 
supporting a 24x7 environment means that cluster 
services and Real Application Clusters (RAC) are part 
of the installation, configuration, and patching jobs. 
As the environment scales out provisioning servers 
and maintaining the cluster and performance, there 
are tasks that need to be addressed. Data Guard and 
standby servers are part of the maximum availability 
architecture and become the responsibility of the 
system DBA.
•	
Manageability. Monitoring of the database servers 
and verifying that all the components of the databases 
are available are under management of the systems. 
Even after installs, the work for patching, upgrades, 
monitoring activity, and performance are needed to 
ensure a stable environment.
•	
Recovery. It is not enough to just back up databases, 
but to plan and ensure that databases can be restored. 
There are other features of the database that allow for 
this besides backup and restore, such as flashback and 
failover. Recovery testing and planning for failover are 
included in these responsibilities.
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

8
There are, of course, tools that can assist in these areas and we will 
discuss the future state of the databases and the possibility of managing many 
of the databases as one and simplify these processes. Tools and standards are 
essential for the system DBAs, and they need to understand more than just 
the database, as they also work on the OS, networking, and storage.
The system DBAs support many database servers and provide a highly 
available and stable database system. They have the skills and tasks to 
install, deploy, and maintain these environments and provide normal 
maintenance tasks, storage allocations, and backups.
Application DBAs
Application DBAs are going to understand more of the application 
processes and data to support the business and developers. Instead 
of looking at the system processes and the availability of the database, 
the focus of application DBA is on database objects, data flows, and 
application performance.
PDBs are going to be the environment that the application DBAs find 
themselves in because the user and application objects and activity will be 
in PDBs. The application DBA does not work in isolation, and instead needs 
to work closely with system DBAs and application development teams.
Data modeling is another role that these DBAs will have as they assist 
with the application development. Some of these roles can be separated 
out into different teams and functions depending on the size of the 
organization and sensitivity of the environment. For example:
•	
Database Objects. Modeling of the tables and database 
design for the application and assisting in writing 
scripts for the application code. The objects, including 
tables and procedures, can be developed to be part of 
the unit testing of the application. Planning of indexes 
and views can add value to the development teams.
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

9
•	
Performance Tuning. Tuning the database code 
and implementing solutions for performance issues 
are responsibilities of the application DBAs. Here 
again, working with the system DBAs to coordinate 
activity of the database with application and database 
code is very useful for troubleshooting. There are 
skills here of working through issues, benchmarking, 
and understanding the workings of the database. 
Recommendations for indexes, database options, and 
parameters come out of tuning practices.
•	
New Features. Besides the new features on the server 
side, normally there are database code and object 
enhancements. In understanding the application 
and what they are executing, the new features can be 
matched up to reduce development time or provide 
other benefits with performance. Constant learning 
with the new features and working with developers to 
understand gaps, problem areas, and requirements is 
one of the many challenges for the application DBA.
•	
Migrations. Moving data from production to test 
for development might be a system task or for the 
application DBA to make sure that data is masked 
properly and refreshes happen regularly. Another 
migration is object code to production. This might 
be an operations task, but getting the code ready, 
reviewed, and tested is for the application DBA to 
handle.
•	
Data Management. Data movement in production 
environments with data APIs to other systems is part of 
data management. Data workflows and how to get the 
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

10
needed data from one database to another is where the 
application DBAs have the knowledge of the different 
environments to provide the right way to move data 
or verify that there are data APIs available. With data 
management, there is more work with the CDO group 
or even other business teams.
Note  DBAs are not normally the owners of data unless it is data 
about the databases. They are considered the guardians of the 
data. They can assist the other teams in tagging, classifying, and 
performing data quality steps but would not be the first group for data 
definitions and tying it back to the business.
With skills in data modeling and movement, the application DBAs 
work closely with the development and application teams to ensure the 
data is available and protected. All types of DBAs must continue to work 
with each other, communicate well with other teams, and continually learn 
about new features to implement in the databases.
Automation DBAs
Isn’t everyone supposed to be looking at automating processes and 
reducing manual efforts? Well, yes, they are. However, there might be tasks 
being performed as a one off to see if it works as needed, and then it can be 
handed off to the automation DBAs to include it in the processes. I would 
expect that these DBAs are working heavily in Oracle Enterprise Manager 
or Oracle Cloud Manager. They would have a scheduler tool to coordinate 
jobs and writing the wrappers around code that will automate what used to 
be one-off tasks or manual ones.
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

11
Automation DBAs might be part of one of the other teams, but this 
is a type of DBA that will look to make sure that the jobs are running as 
scheduled and implement processes around the maintenance and data 
tasks. They work to keep everything a smoothly as possible and that there 
is little manual intervention in production. Taking tasks from development 
and automating it would be the responsibility of this type of DBA. This 
can be the team that gets handed code from system and application DBAs 
to manage and automate. Verifying that code is running as expected and 
the jobs are executing would be in reports reviewed and audited from the 
automation DBAs. In separating this out, the separation of duties allows for 
handoffs from development to production and reduces the manual issues 
that can occur.
•	
Scheduling. A schedule might be a simple thing, but 
realize that there are maintenance, data, ETL, and 
application jobs that might need to be coordinated. 
The scheduling of these tasks can be tricky so that they 
do not collide or slow down any of the production 
environments.
•	
Code Automation. An automation DBA can have code 
that will wrap around tasks for automation so they can 
just plug in jobs. They can review other code to make 
sure the jobs are doing what they are supposed to do. 
They are looking to automate processes and workflows 
whereever possible. Automation of reporting should be 
under their responsibilities too.
•	
Monitoring. Monitoring the execution and errors on 
the databases, the automation DBAs can report on 
timing and that the code is being maintained properly. 
Also in monitoring, they can find other opportunities 
for processes and work with the other teams to make 
sure that these tasks get rolled up into the automation.
Chapter 1  Types of DBAs

12
The automation DBA can help enforce standards with processes, code, 
and database structures because automation is simpler if the standards 
are dependable. The skills here are to understand what processes can 
be automated and to take requirements from others to plug into the 
automation tasks. The understanding of the database activity and being 
able to write and maintain database code allow them to complete their 
responsibilities around automation.
Next
There might be other types of DBAs that have been developed for other 
organizations based on demand of tasks and types of applications they 
might be running. These are typical types of DBAs that are part of the 
current state of the environment. A couple of times I hinted to what is 
coming next or to pay attention to the skills that are being developed 
while working as one of these types of DBAs. The question is what is 
coming next, because there needs to be some sort of transformation since 
databases are obviously changing in where they are installed, how they are 
being managed, and an overall technology shift to service like and cloud 
systems.
The DBA must take the skills from these typical areas of focus and 
know that the expertise developed here is vital to continuing to support the 
databases even though the landscape of how and where it is going will be 
changing, if it has not already.
Conclusion
Before we start the transformation process, let’s look at the skills we can 
pull out of the current state DBAs as well as some other important skills 
and knowledge that will allow us to move forward in a world of cloud 
computing and automation.

CHAPTER 2
The Set of Skills
Calling all technology people who like to have control over the 
environment. That could be most us, especially if we are DBAs. It is difficult 
to confess that you became a DBA because you like to have control over 
the data and who, how, when, where, and what happens to the data. I will 
speak for myself here, but you are welcome to join me in that statement if 
you so desire. Anyhow, some of the best skill sets can also be a weakness in 
dealing with a transitioning role, which we will work through in Chapters 8 
and 9. It is difficult to give up or perceive that we are giving up something 
that we enjoy and feel is a very valuable set of skills. The great news is that 
most of the skills and knowledge we have as DBAs can help us become 
even better DBAs and be used as leverage to move in a different direction.
As we went through the types of DBAs in the previous chapter, I 
hope you were thinking about some of the skills that are needed in these 
different roles as they are going to be our baseline skill set that we have as 
DBAs. Depending on the opportunities, skills can always be developed and 
improved. And with some of actions and activities that we do, the syntax 
is not the skill that is being sought after. It is the skill to google the right 
version of Oracle or the database to get the correct syntax that is important.
Relationship building is a must for allowing DBAs to be able to 
work with all of the various teams. This is not always something easy to 
accomplish as there are challenges with communication, resources, and 
different priorities between the teams. It is a skill that can be mastered with 
practice and learning effective communication.

14
We can break down these skills into the technical skills that are still 
required for any changes and transformations, as well as the soft skills that 
absolutely must come with the changes.
Technical Skills
The technical skills are going to vary to go along with the types of DBAs. 
Having spent time in the different groups will continue to round out 
the skill set. Having worked with the application teams gives more of 
an application understanding and provides coding opportunities. The 
technical skills that are needed to administer databases are different 
than coding full applications, but there is quite a bit of code that can 
be database specific. The DBA is not necessarily the one writing the 
application, again pointing back to the separation of duties, but to 
understand how to read through and interpret code helps with working on 
database development.
Platform Specific
There are database platform-specific skills such as Data Guard and 
RAC and even some performance tuning. Even different versions of the 
database can require additional knowledge, such as CDBs and PDBs. 
Of course, there are database core skills, just changes in syntax, which 
are needed for any database: backup and recovery, object creation and 
modification, and monitoring. Patching and upgrading databases follows 
similar processes, plans, tests, backups, and executes the plan. Table 2-1 
shows a list of the core DBA skills versus Oracle-specific skills.

Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

Testing and Implementation
A technical skill that might be overlooked is testing and implementing 
unit testing. Developing test plans is part of the development code for 
the procedures, tables, and validation of the processes. There is skill in 
integrating the database testing with the application code. Plugging in 
code and details about the objects will get you validation before going to 
production.
Installs and Upgrades
Technical skills have been what you have been practicing as a DBA. The 
technical side of performance tuning and implementing high availability 
systems might be the coding areas that you really enjoy doing. It is good to 
know a skill that will always be needed. The DBAs that really enjoy installs 
and upgrades is in a good position because with changes to the cloud, 
these skills will need to be transferred over also. Even the Oracle has been 
simplifying the install and patching processes. They have announced a 
couple of times over the years with releases that the database is easier 
to set up, configure, and manage, but the technical skills of the workings 
of the database, and how to use the features for other processes are the 
technical skills to possess.
Soft Skills
DBAs, whether we wanted to or not, have developed soft skills along the 
way. We have had to communicate with other teams, plan very large 
environments, and make the connections between the business all the 
way down to the OS and servers. There are not going to be opportunities to 
work in isolation. As a DBA, there are opportunities to lead in changes and 
development processes. Even with security, the DBAs should be educating 
and leading with practices for protecting the data in the database systems.
Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

18
The soft skills are something that can be worked on, and it is a constant 
personal growth opportunity. As our soft skills improve, it is not just our 
work lives that benefit but also our personal lives outside the working hours. 
An SQL query may not matter to our family but better communication does. 
Volunteering for the user community and other organizations provides 
a safe environment to practice these skills. Sharing our technical skills in 
written or presentation format keeps the growth going.
Communication
Communication means more than just talking with others. This requires 
understanding the audience and detailing with issues, requirements, and 
expectations. Agreeing with and planning and then turning around and 
ignoring the priorities is very poor communication. There is a reason why 
I list communication first: because the better we can communicate what 
we do and the work we can do, the easier it will be for us to be in a position 
where we enjoy working, feel challenged, and know that we are adding 
value because of the communication we give and receive.
In the world of emails and Instant Messaging or text, we have 
developed another way to communicate that is not as formal, and we 
can pull in others that may or may not be needed in the conversation. 
There are already several books written on communication, business 
communication, even how disruptive miscommunication can be. Any time 
spent improving how we communicate with each other, including writing 
effective emails is well worth the time.
There are a couple of areas in which I feel are extremely important to 
have great communication skills.
	 1.	 Develop communication plans that can be used as 
part of any change or project. The communication 
plan would include how to get the audience 
and how to communicate so that the details are 
Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

19
specifically stated. The plan should include what the 
reason or issues are for the communication, why it 
is being stated now, what the call to action is, and 
any other expectations or details that belong with 
the message being delivered. A standard template 
is usually the best way to do this because it makes 
sure that all the pieces of the communication are 
included and it is recognizable by others.
	 2.	 Understand the audience to provide the right 
details. A more technical email for other engineers 
and more high level and key points for management 
(they can always ask questions if they want some 
technical details) would be appropriate. This can 
also apply to sending emails back and forth in 
which the audience may not have been part of other 
discussions or meetings and questions should be 
asked to understand what they need or what they 
are asking so that details do not get missed.
	 3.	 Communicate an agenda for a meeting. It is very 
easy to get off track or not know what the meeting 
is for, so the agenda helps and allows others to be 
prepared. Sending out notes afterwards captures 
the highlights, which makes it easier to track; fill in 
others not attending; and believe it or not captures 
what the time was spent doing, which is useful for 
timekeeping, year-end review, and management 
briefs.
Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

20
	 4.	 Notify of changes and project milestones. There 
is probably a change process, but there might be 
additional information to educate and deliver 
other meaningful information to the developers 
and applications. This should be part of the 
communication plan, but it might be going to 
smaller audience first or even management as this is 
being decided upon.
To show the importance of the communication, three out of the next 
five skills depend on it. This is a skill that you probably don’t know that you 
have been using, but examine how you are communicating, look for ways 
that it is currently being used, as it is a skill to bring with in any transition.
Documentation
As DBAs, we have read a ton of documentation or at least, more than we 
can count, the release notes. It is a skill that some of us find easier than 
others to write but we all do it in some fashion. The details of what is being 
executed, how and why, in documentation format for others to understand 
the details of the system for others to support. We create runbooks, 
detailed information about our set of scripts, and the databases with 
configurations.
DBAs tend to document the owners of the databases and application 
owners as we use these in communications about the environment. 
Chances are that most of these details are in a database but we can pull 
reports and use the information for other processes.
Documentation is normally created to outline steps for installations, 
upgrades, and health checklists. Test plans are also documented with 
plenty of test cases to have the successful upgrades and installs. Needing to 
know how to restore a database, the DBA of course has documentation of 
scripts and steps, including the logs from the last practice restore.
Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

21
Data flows and database objects line our walls as we work to 
understand the data model and internalize all the intricacies of the 
application and how they are using the data. This information equips us to 
provide the optimal support for the database system.
As data flows become more complex with the cloud and other 
integrations, this type of documentation along with processes will be 
needed in future environments.
Relationship Building (Interpersonal Skills)
The good news is that we are dependent on working with others because 
the databases need servers, network, and other infrastructure. The data 
also comes from the business and application teams. It does also make it 
challenging to have to coordinate and work peacefully with these teams, 
but the DBA teams seem to make it happen.
Communication is key to building these relationships. I find it easier 
when expectations are set properly and any changes are communicated as 
quickly as possible. Other teams respect that and start to work closely with 
the DBAs because they get honest answers and details as things happen.
DBA teams can assist in making connections with other teams and 
serve as a liaison either to application teams or infrastructure teams. This 
also comes from understanding what it takes to keep the system running 
along with the business requirements and SLAs. This knowledge can 
translate into reviewing SLAs and requirements for cloud infrastructure 
too. And it provides the needed education for the business to validate they 
are meeting their demands in the cloud architecture.
Adaptability
The DBA might not appear as one to adapt to new environments because 
we have carried a toolset along with us for many years. However, the 
toolset can and in many cases has been updated along the way to account 
Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

22
for new features and changes in how the database performs. As we went 
through the technical skills, the core items for databases has not changed 
much over the years, but how to effectively run those tasks and adapt to 
the new features for completion of these tasks.
Many of the manageability options of the database have become 
part of the internals of the systems, which have been automated, but in 
understanding the workings of the environment we are looking for the next 
issue. There have been many times that a script or monitoring has found 
something new to look for, and we add that to our arsenal.
We are already not the same DBAs from 10 years ago. We have adapted 
to new OS, new database platforms, and virtualization. These shifts to our 
environments have developed our abilities to shift and adapt to how we 
configure and administer the databases, even include other platforms in 
the data flows and integrations.
The continuous learning that is part of the excitement of being a DBA 
has encouraged us to move along with new options and add this variety 
in the tool belt. Even with some of the old scripts we remember how the 
processes have functioned and now can adjust and keep moving forward 
with the small and major shifts.
Organizational
Welcome to control freaks anonymous, where we have organizational 
skills. This is a skill that most DBAs possess and are very proud of. Nothing 
wrong with that, especially since it is absolutely needed to manage all the 
databases, processes, activities, and users.
We stay organized to make sure that gaps are being covered and that 
steps are being followed to ensure repeatable processes. The organized 
steps can be tested, repeated, and reused for other areas too. It is rare that 
a DBA really has a one-off process, because chances are that it will need 
to be used again. It could be administration tasks or performance-tuning 
steps, but repeatable processes are typical for the databases. Organization 
Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

23
is used for this because it follows a specific flow; you cannot backup a 
database after starting the upgrade. It’s too late at that time to restore. 
Having a couple of backup or rollback plans is normal for the DBA.
Being process oriented and organized allows you to think through 
the details and then execute them. In reviewing architecture designs and 
discussing different infrastructure, DBAs can ask several great questions to 
help get to gaps or figure out what is missing in a process to make it work. 
These questions come from the understanding of the processes and being 
organized to know what the order in steps should be. Organizing questions 
to evaluate new environments, plan cloud migrations, and prepare data 
integrations are future skills for the DBA, which is a soft skill that we are 
already possess.
Leadership
Leadership is not about a position, because we are not all DBA managers 
or team leads. We have databases that we manage and teams that we 
work with. We lead with our skills and knowledge in that we contribute to 
provide database systems that support the enterprise.
We are proactive or decide to work toward that goal. We lead in 
this way instead of being reactive, even if it can be difficult at times. 
Modifying what we do to work in a way for standards and being able to 
provide answers before being asked is a goal and can lead in the right 
direction. There are opportunities with future direction to lead other 
DBAs and prepare for moving databases to the cloud or other services. 
Understanding the benefits of these moves and providing explanations to 
other teams will lead the changes. The transition to another type of DBA is 
using these skills and will challenge us to grow them.
We have presented information about new features, storage capacity, 
and hardware choices. Not only are these communication skills, but 
they demonstrate how we lead in our area. Without the discussion about 
hardware and database improvements, we would be falling behind the curve. 
Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

24
We lead in the areas of making our environments better and current to 
provide what is needed in the enterprise. These are details that allow us to 
talk with management to be proactive with our environments.
As DBAs, we are passionate about databases. We are driven by goals to 
have a secure, stable, highly available database, and we are protective of 
the system to keep it tuned as we have planned. As leaders, we should be 
sharing this with others, mentoring other administrators and developers to 
understand and appreciate the databases. This passion can carry over into 
other areas that we are serving and allows us to lead with example as we 
approach the new database world.
In building teams we have DBAs exhibit leadership. The team-building 
effort flows over into what happens in the database. It inspires us to learn 
and become even better in our talents and craft, and pass it along to 
others. Let’s look at a few leadership qualities in building these teams that 
will be needed in transition:
•	
Mentor what inspires us. We are passionate and 
inspired by people around us in the database 
profession. Share that passion. Share the reasons for 
enjoying this profession. Explain why and use that to 
inspire others.
•	
Team building. Putting together a team is not easy, 
and they need to work together to achieve the goals. 
Building a team means to be using the different talents 
of the individuals to work for the benefit of the team. It 
will make a stronger team. In building a team, it is also 
worth looking into what happens with the team when 
things change. If goals change or the direction of the 
project and system, the team needs to work to adapt 
and continue along the new path.
Chapter 2  The Set of Skills

25
•	
Team goals. Defining the goals might be related to the 
current projects and activities or what the team needs 
to become for the environment. Individuals might have 
goals to continue to learn, advance in their careers, 
and be able to add value in the team. Team goals need 
to include all of the individual members, and it might 
take working with each one to understand the goals 
and where they fit into the picture. The goals of the 
team should be apparent and discussed how to obtain. 
Goals to shift the database environment to the cloud 
or migrate to different a platform should at least be 
planned as a team; even if not everyone agrees with the 
goal at first, they can agree with the plan to achieve it.
•	
Developing skills. We have been discussing technical 
skills and soft skills, and leading will not only be 
developing these skills in yourself but also helping 
others to see what skills need attention. There is always 
something more to learn and work on in these areas. In 
teaching and mentoring others, we actually learn more.
Conclusion
Technical and soft skills have been developed over the years as a DBA. The 
technical skills have allowed us to support and maintain the mission-­
critical database environment effectively. They gave us the understanding 
of the internals and how the database applications function. We have 
learned from application owners and developers the requirements and 
how to implement them. The communication, leadership, and other soft 
skills are going to be critical for moving forward, assessing the direction to 
plan for, and making the change.

CHAPTER 3
The Future State 
of Databases
Relational, Graph, NoSQL, Columnar, InMemory, Warehouse, and 
Analytical databases are all part of the database administrator’s job. 
The database platforms continue to grow and develop. Even with many 
relatively new databases now part of the development and production 
environments, the relational databases still hold a large market share and 
purpose.
With the collection of even more data on a daily basis and new uses 
in companies for data-driven results, the various databases serve in the 
processes and system. Data growth is one constant for the future. With all 
of the social media channels, smartphones, and Internet of Things (IOT), 
data is predicted by several different sources to grow to over 100 zetabytes 
in the next 5 years. This is just an increase from just under 10 zetabytes in 
2015. Not to mention that there are advances in technology that can even 
drive this higher. Artificial Intelligence and plenty of IOT sources might 
even make this more than predicted.

“The Data Warehouse is far from dead, it is the core of any business 
reporting system, but it must adapt faster. We generate significant data through 
our business applications which feed the traditional data warehouse. Businesses 
will adapt their data warehouse architecture and finally see a widespread use of 
Hadoop for landing data.” Ian Abramson, Predictions, IOUG Select.
The Data Warehouse is far from dead, as it is the core of any business 
reporting system, but it must adapt faster. We generate significant 
data through our business applications that feed the traditional data 
warehouse; 2017 will see businesses adapt their data warehouse 
architecture and finally see a widespread use of Hadoop for landing data.
Can you even how much data is going to be in your data center or 
cloud databases in a few years? The database professional does have their 
work cut out for them to maintain these very large environments. The 
data and information business is going to be booming and bringing in 
significant dollars to the industry. The business of data is not going away 
anytime soon, and there will be a role for the guardians of the data.
In Figure 3-1, the chart shows the growth of data coming from mobile 
as forecast by Cisco Virtual Networking Index. The data is planned to grow 
to 49 Exabytes per month from currently around 11 Exabytes per month. 
This could be the result of more video and pictures, but it is data that will 
be coming from devices that can find itself in databases.
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

29
Additional interesting information coming out of this forecast from 
Cisco VNI is the number of smart and non-smart devices and connections. 
The number of non-smart device connections is decreasing even though 
they continue to grow in the forecast. However, they will still be growing 
year over year by significant amounts. Figure 3-2 shows the chart with this 
information about the number of smart devices and non-smart devices. 
With the increase in devices and connections, the data will continue to 
growth. Through online shopping, photos, and other social media, the data 
growth is supporting the importance of the database.

Technology 
As seen with the development of the smart devices influencing the 
forecasts in the mobile devices, other technology is affecting how we 
manage databases. Virtualization changes how we look at resources and 
servers. Provisioning of new resources is more transparent and available 
with growth or peaks of services. Server technology continues to advance 
and using it with virtualization allows for using these new technologies.
Storage
Oracle Exadata engineered systems provide servers that are specialized for 
Oracle database workloads and configurations. These engineered systems 
are a good example how the technology is keeping up with the database,

Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast 
Update, 2016-2021
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

31
high availability options, and features. The performance with the storage 
and configurations allows for the databases to run as they are designed. 
Memory options and parameters are working for the In-Memory database 
of 12cR2 and other configurations bring in the new features as they also 
enhance with each release of the servers, either with upgrades or new 
components. This actually limits some of the intervention from the DBA 
and the server hardware. Supporting these engineered systems is a task 
that a Database Machine Administrator (DMA) would carry out. We will 
discuss the DMA in Chapter 4.
With the amount of storage, the hardware is critical to make sure to 
be staying up from the latest trends and technology to improve speeds of 
disk operations. Solid State Disks (SSD) are going to be what is being used 
along with flash. The spinning disks are going to be a thing of the past, 
and new innovations will allow for more data in memory and faster data 
access. 
Data
The type of data is changed too. With Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual 
Reality (VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) videos and pictures, larger 
datasets are being accessed and stored. With AR and VR traffic, data access 
per month will be reaching 160 Pedabytes up from 16 PB, according to the 
Cisco VNI Forecasts. AI might be the unknown as many are just touching 
the surface with the ability to make decisions on very, very large datasets. 
It can surpass the forecasts if there are new opportunities in this area.
Data collected from wearables, sensors, and other IOT devices are 
going to collect data and expand the amount of data crossing through 
the data center. Even if you think about how much data you currently use 
on your mobile devices each month and how that has changed over the 
past couple of years, just imagine how quickly that will change in the next 
few years. It will definitely be well over the 4GB mark, unless you have 
teenagers, which make it soar above 10GB very quickly.
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

32
The devices are advancing with the wearables and what is being 
collected, costs for points of entry decreasing, and the technology for 
other devices are going to play a big factor on how quickly the amount 
of data grows and changes the forecasts. Technology in the data center 
will need to be enhanced at speeds to keep up with the demand. The life 
cycle of devices is changing from what it was several years back to be five 
years, down to three, and probably now between two and three years. The 
technology and devices are keeping up with the business and end users.
Technology is driving both sides of the equation with devices that 
collect the data, and the servers, storage, network and other components 
to support the business with the data that flow through. Databases are 
going to store the necessary data for business processes and day-to-day 
information as they also need a way to process data and the workflows 
from Big Data streams to integrate with the systems.
I might be getting ahead of myself in talking about the data streams 
and integration as this is a place where DBAs can transfer into, but the 
technology of the devices and support compounds the data growth and 
the opportunities for the DBAs. This is going to be considered as several 
technology game changes for all kinds of information that is available.
Disruptors
Disruptors are innovations that potentially create new markets and new 
value. Therefore, they are disrupting the current markets and values in 
the market. It is not just something shiny that grabs our attention for a 
moment but it is something that disrupts, interrupts, and moves us in a 
different direction because of that advancement or innovation that can’t 
be ignored.
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

33
Technology
Technology is a big disruptor and will continue to be going forward. We 
just finished talking about how technical devices and how they are going to 
continue to provide more data and information. These are a disruption to 
the database environments as there are capacity plans that are extremely 
different now than they were a couple of years ago and will be very 
different in the future. Accounting for the new data market, the IOT data 
collection is going to add to business value as long as we incorporate how 
we are handling the data disturbance and manage these changes.
Social Networking
Social Networking is a disruptor as businesses are using these forms of 
communication as a marketing outlet, or information gathering opportunity. 
This is now becoming part of the plans in the business, but they might not 
have been included before. With the younger generation using this as their 
way of communication, this will also disrupt the business and how they not 
only market to them, but how they also prepare for them to join the workforce.
Security
Security is a disruptor in that it causes current progress on projects to stop 
and deal with the situation at hand. It might be a new zero-day exploit or a 
new security patch that has been released and should be dealt with as soon 
as possible. Breaches cause disruption in projects as they might require 
an assessment if the right controls are in place and how the environment 
is handling the possibility of a breach and reducing the risk. Innovations 
on the hacker side of the equation is not a positive outcome for the market 
but it will definitely cause a disruption in how it is being addressed and 
the risk involved. Much more will be covered in Chapter 6 on security, but 
understand that it is going to be a disruptor now and in the future as the 
security landscape is going to be one that is always changing.
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

34
Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Artificial 
Intelligence
Mentioned in the Technology Section, VR, AR, and AI are all disruptors as 
there is constant innovation happening here. Robots that can now perform 
tasks to provide products more efficiently to the market add value. AI is 
starting to open new doors on how devices and behave and react, possibly 
even creating new environments that we might have dreamed about or 
only have seen in Sci-Fi movies and TV shows. We actually look at some of 
the movies and think, could that actually happen? Is that real? Self-driving 
cars are already out there being tested, but what is the next technology 
disruptor coming our way? It is definitely fun to think about how we might 
be working in a few years. Already there are plenty of companies that opt 
for working at home possibilities because of cost savings and technology 
to support this type of environment. It would be amazing to see VR play 
a part in going into the office in a way to speak with our coworkers and 
avoiding the commute.
Why are disruptors even more important now to database 
environments and the transformation of DBAs? Databases are normally 
considered a sustaining technology. Yes, it has changes and upgrades, but 
these are incremental improvements and efficiencies that normally take 
place. They are not always the innovations that are changing the direction, 
markets, or value. However, as described above, these innovations in 
technology and other areas are creating the interruptions to normal 
business and need to be addressed sooner rather than later. As DBAs we 
need to evaluate these disruptions in our database environment. Is it 
going to add more value? Do I need to change the way I am doing things 
to address it? These honest questions are going to be more than just a 
simple change. It will be changing and causing disruptions of our current 
projects and processes if we look at all of the innovations in technology 
and embrace those in the database systems.
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

35
We will see even more disruptors and many of these will influence 
the database arena. It will change how and what data is collected and the 
growth. These systems need to adapt and incorporate as needed by the 
business. This is just the beginning of some DBA transformations as more 
will happen with new disruptors.
Many Platforms
DBAs support multiple platforms of databases. There are many enterprise-­
level databases that include types, like relational, key-value and column 
stores, and graph databases, each with a purpose. The market share of 
these databases has changed slightly over the past 10 years, but relational 
databases still make up about 89% of the enterprise market share. Figure ­3-­3 
shows the market share of each of the database platforms based on Gartner 
and other market research from 2016.
Figure 3-3.  Enterprise Database Market Share
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

36
It is not just Oracle, but MSSQL, MySQL, DB2, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, 
Hadoop, neo4j, and other platforms that will be found in the enterprise 
supported by DBAs. New databases are developing as part of cloud 
services, and the data that is being collected by devices. For example, 
Amazon Cloud database, SimpleDB, recently emerged as part of the 
cloud services. DBAs are needed to administer the various databases, 
and help plan which workloads are appropriate for the type of database. 
Administration changes for the different platforms and integration 
between the platforms will pose different issues and challenges.
Future needs of databases are not just based on data needs but can be 
on application development needs. According to a StackOverflow survey 
in 2017, developers have ranked databases in order of preference to work 
with and MySQL is the most popular database. SQL Server, PostgreSQL, 
and MongoDB are next on the list. This is not to say that the developers 
have the ultimate choice for the databases, but the reasons they are 
popular are for ease of use and to work without too many blockers. A self-­
service model would influence a preference among other factors.
Database platform no longer matters to the DBAs, as they are 
responsible for managing and administering several different platforms. 
Understanding the various databases types and when best to utilize them 
will provide the input needed for design decisions.
Database as a Service
Database as a Service (DBaaS) standardizes the database installation, 
configuration, and monitoring. DBaaS puts in the needed configuration 
with security, compliance, and management tools in place with self-­
service provisioning. It makes the environment scalable with managing 
many databases as one because of the standardization. DBaaS has 
database containers that are deployed for the application users. It keeps 
production and development environments in sync with the same 
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

37
containers and provides services to manage and do tasks and development 
as needed. DBAs are needed to provide input into the containers for the 
company to meet policies and expected compliance, but as the containers 
are constructed and implemented, the DBAs become more focused in the 
application space to provide management of user objects, performance 
tuning, and application development.
The containers are developed in virtualized, Docker, Ansible, and 
other containers. This is a growing trend to use these tools and as this 
provides a consistent deployment of the database software, database, and 
configurations. It is a measured service that allows for resource pooling 
for providing for growth and scalability. Figure 3-4 shows the design of 
this model, using Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for providing 
actions that can be performed against the containers. APIs support the 
on-demand service of the databases to run without additional interaction. 
Since the databases are deployed and created the same way, it is simple to 
measure and understand usage. This supports other important parts for 
database environments such as capacity planning and monitoring.
Figure 3-4.  Design and Advantages of DBaaS
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

38
APIs are going to be an important part of any database in the 
future. This is the way to interact with databases in DBaaS and cloud 
environments. It is a standardized way to get data in and out of the 
database and perform actions and management items. As we will discuss 
about the Cloud DBA, there are ways to work on developing the APIs or 
using the APIs to integrate to other environments. The APIs make it so that 
the databases can be managed as one with the consistent access to all of 
the environment.
DBaaS can be considered a private cloud environment as it fits the 
same components of delivery and offers the service to deploy database 
containers. The future of the database will have databases in containers 
to deploy either in the enterprise data center or in the cloud. According 
to a 2016 IOUG Survey on Database Cloud, the growth rate of DBaaS 
adoption is to triple in the next couple of years. The survey focused on how 
DBaaS is becoming mainstream and the Oracle Multitenent is providing 
the required structures to use the containers. DBaaS and Cloud database 
will probably become interchangeable going forward, understanding that 
there are several services available that will be part of the offerings that are 
in public and private cloud environments.
Databases in the Cloud
The major enterprise database companies are investing in the area of 
the cloud. Companies find value in using the cloud. It might be using the 
software and applications that are provided, or even the infrastructure to 
support public-facing applications. It is also possible that cloud supports 
development environments to cut costs in the test and lab areas. As seen 
in Figure 3-5, the RightScale 2016 State of the Cloud Report confirms that 
most companies are already invested in the cloud, both public and private.
Chapter 3  The Future State of Databases

39
Understanding that database containers (DBaaS) will support the 
significant growth of cloud environments is vital to the transitioning 
DBA. Amazon with the SimpleDB has invested in the space of storing 
data in the cloud, Microsoft and IBM are doing the same with offerings 
in the cloud and in NoSQL databases. Oracle is building on its cloud 
service. Flexibility and cost seems to be what they are talking about 
as Larry Ellison, CTO at Oracle, announced recently that Oracle offers 
an on-demand service from applications to infrastructure including 
database in between. The same feature of the Oracle database 12cR2 
includes InMemory, Security, and using the Oracle engineered machines 
on the back end. He talks about simplicity and how it is easy to manage 
the consumption of the service. The autonomous database that will 
be completely self-driving is coming to the Oracle Cloud and so will 
automation of the database with less interaction from the administrator or 
others. Talk about a disruptor for the DBA and how we manage databases. 
This is where the transition of the DBA to different areas or even cloud 
DBA will be the direction. We will cover the Cloud DBA in Chapter 6. Here 
it is important to understand that with the database providers’ investment 
in the cloud and companies shifting workloads there, the cloud is here to 
stay. Figure 3-6 shows the transition starting in 2011 and predicting future 
growth in the IOUG Cloud Survey.

40
Figure 3-6.  Shift into the Cloud. Source: Databaseas a Service Enters 
the Enterprise Maistream, 2016 IOUG Survey on Database Cloud, 
April 2016
The cloud offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service 
(PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and I am sure there will be more 
services to come. It does appear that there will be less for the DBA to do in 
the database with the containers and automation and with initialization 
of the containers and which service needs to be implemented. There are 
several areas to consider and design questions to ask for migrations and 
management in the cloud.
The competition of the cloud providers will continue as they innovate 
and create services that will support customers and their business needs. 
Figure 3-7 clearly has AWS growth rates far ahead of the others, but each 
one does have various offerings that should be considered. The database 
transition to the cloud will continue and DBAs need to be ready to 
administer these databases with APIs and other tools provided. It is not 
going to be the same tasks, and looking at the data integrations or other 
aspects will be a direction to consider for future opportunities.

Conclusion
The future state of the database brings more data than even imagined 20 
years ago when large databases were 50 GB in size. Cloud is the future 
direction and we already need to be planning for our roles. We will 
continue to have complex environments in dealing with several database 
platforms, but we can navigate the knowledge and skills that we have DBAs 
to embrace the future of the database as it is also transitioning.

CHAPTER 4
The Database 
Machine 
Administrator (DMA)
The Oracle Engineered Systems and other appliances are creating a new 
subclass of DBAs – the Database Machine Administrator (DMA). The 
DMA will be working with the hardware, storage, and OS of the machines. 
This might be viewed similarly to a system administrator, but because it 
is specific for machines that will house databases and machines that are 
designed for databases, the knowledge of the databases is valuable. These 
engineered systems are also not typical standard hardware and other 
administrators will be looking to the DMA to handle everything from the 
database, OS, network, storage, and server needs.
There are new systems and appliances that will continue to be added 
to the offerings so this will not be a complete list but instead provide 
guidance on what a DMA has as responsibilities.
Note  Even though the Engineered Systems come preconfigured, 
they need DMAs for specific configurations and server administration.

44
Exadata Database Machine
The Exadata is Oracle’s first database engineered system to market. Since 
then it has had a few different changes and releases. These enhancements 
keep improving the hardware and features of the database. The OS and 
database do come preconfigured. Storage is available and the InfiniBand 
internal network fabric for connections between the servers inside of 
the Exadata. There are currently two different machines with storage 
expansion, and they have several different ways to purchase the machine 
for the current need and expand for growth.
The three areas that are going to be more specific to a DMA are OS, 
storage, and the network. OS is going to be Linux and with maintenance 
and monitoring, being able to work in Linux is a must. Storage 
configuration is going to be configured by the DMA for use with ASM and 
the file system. Network is for the connections to the internal servers and 
configurations for Real Application Clusters (RAC).
The DMA is going to perform many tasks that point back to the 
Systems DBA that we discussed in Chapter 1. The database parameters 
and configuration, backups, and high availability options are going to be 
supported by the DMA. Some system changes and patching is going to 
be handled in coordination with Oracle as these releases are specific for 
Exadata. Full control is given to the DMA, and they have access to all of 
the resources in the Exadata. Even though the DMA needs to make sure 
that the changes, configurations, and coordination happens with Oracle, 
they do not have to work as closely with the other OS, server, storage, and 
networking teams. These systems are all contained with the DMA having 
to manage the full server.
High availability options need to be maintained by the 
DMA. Knowledge of RAC and provisioning new nodes in the cluster 
are part of the job, as are using the internal network and being able to 
configure and manage the nodes in the cluster.
Chapter 4  The Database Machine Administrator (DMA)

45
As a DBA, the storage management is normally with the ASM instance. 
As a DMA it expands further into the device configuration and mappings 
to file systems and the devices to be used for ASM disk groups.
There is a client utility that can be used to assist in managing the Exadata, 
exaCLI. This will help in managing database configurations and storage. 
DBMCLI and CellCLI add to the utility commands for the storage cells.
Transformation into a DMA is a natural step for a Systems DBA. There 
are a few more areas to learn about with the utilities and managing storage 
and networking, but the hardware might be the place where it is most 
comfortable for you, especially if you enjoy RAC, ASM, and having control 
on the server.
The Exadatas are machines that are engineered for database workloads, 
but they still provide configurable options. These options are used for 
performance and security. The DMA must understand how to provide a 
highly available, maximum performance, and secure environment for the 
enterprise that owns these machines. The machines are going to be bring 
into the environment and start using, but without the know-how of what 
can be configured as the additional benefits for the enterprise might not be 
available. The same type of understanding for RAC and security with other 
database servers are needed for Exadata. The advantage is that the DMA is 
able to make those changes (after a proper testing and change control) but 
they are the ones in control of the machines.
Along with the Exadatas there are other engineered systems for 
analytics. The applications can be on these servers, and the Oracle 
Exalytics is the newest to join the group featuring In-Memory software. 
These machines are all part of the DMA portfolio. Large companies 
can have several Exadata machines while others have only one or two. 
Exadatas can also be used to manage private cloud environments, which 
may mean there will be more servers coming soon as the migrations to 
cloud happen. Of course in the large enterprise, there is plenty to do with 
all of the Exadatas, but the DMA can also support the various appliances as 
part of the job.
Chapter 4  The Database Machine Administrator (DMA)

46
Appliances
Database, Big Data, and Private Cloud Appliances are pre-configured 
servers. These appliances all require more administration on the database 
side as well as maintaining the server. Each of these appliances has their 
own purpose and not having to worry about the initial configuration and 
software installations takes the guessing out of the setup. It also provides 
ease of deployment in using these appliances.
The DMA can support these configurations and appliances. Here 
the knowledge of databases and the OS is needed to provide the proper 
support for these databases. Again, the DMA can very easily come from 
the system DBA tasks to support any and all of these machines. Big 
Data appliances will have other software such as Hadoop and possibly 
integration tools to work with.
Since these systems, DBA skills are still needed should the DBA need 
to transform into another position. This is a smaller transition because the 
database skills of backup, recovery, and high availability are required and 
then add the storage, OS, and server maintenance work to become the 
DMA to support the engineered systems.
This is not a book to discuss all of the interworkings of the engineer 
systems and why to choose one over the other but to look where DBA 
skills can be used and what systems will need the support in the future. 
Database servers, appliances, and engineer systems are going to increase 
their offerings and will need DMAs to step up and be administrators for 
these systems even if they are in the cloud or Big Data offerings.
Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance is a recently added appliance. It is 
for real-time redo transport to protect Oracle databases on-premise or in 
the cloud. It automates backups to tape from the appliance and off-loads 
the workload of the backups on the production servers. Monitoring of the 
recovery appliance is going to ensure that the processes are working and as 
a DMA, testing restores will be needed.
Chapter 4  The Database Machine Administrator (DMA)

47
On the storage side there is the ZFS Storage Appliance. This can 
provide shared file systems to Exadata, engineered systems, or other 
servers. This is where more storage and OS management comes to play for 
the DMA.
Cloud Engineered Systems
The Cloud Appliance is a machine that can be used to create a private 
cloud offering. The appliance is managed by the DMA and can have 
mixed workloads. Since this is an appliance, it comes preconfigured with 
virtualization to stand up a private cloud system in the company’s data 
center. Being a private cloud, it requires someone or a team to manage it in 
the enterprise. This is more than just the database in the cloud but can also 
house other applications, and requires understanding of the application 
services.
The Cloud Engineered System is hardware that is managed by Oracle 
on-premise. It provides the same Oracle cloud service but on-premise. 
This means that the data doesn’t need to leave the data center, but all 
of the management of the cloud, Oracle does for you. DMA wouldn’t be 
the ones to ask to manage the Cloud Machine. The Cloud DBA would be 
handling the databases whether the databases are on a public cloud or on-­
premise in a public cloud like the Cloud Machine.
SuperCluster and Other Servers
The SuperCluster is another engineered system that varies from the 
Exadata, but has specific hardware properties that provide additional 
security and performance benefits. Since this is an engineered system, it is 
managed by a DMA; however, the OS is Solaris is another opportunity to 
learn and have another OS in the tool belt.
Chapter 4  The Database Machine Administrator (DMA)

48
For private cloud offering, the SuperCluster can be utilized. It is 
optimized for Oracle database and applications, but is definitely a 
powerful machine to have access to virtualize for self-service cloud 
offerings. As we look into private cloud offerings, we will also be looking 
into more automation and how this will affect the DMAs and DBAs.
Other competitive servers are going to have the same purpose of 
specific database configurations to provide database infrastructure 
in the data center. These servers are going to be managed by those 
understanding all of the backbone of the database: server, OS, network, 
and storage.
Again, understanding that there are disruptors and new innovation, 
more servers and cluster developments will continue. There will be new 
hardware and clusters to manage in the future. Especially with systems 
that are specific for cloud and database, infrastructures are going to be the 
challenges for the DMA.
Architecture Decisions
Another challenge for the DMA is significant knowledge about all these 
offerings and continuing to research any new enhancements. Each of 
these options has technology, capacity, or placement that will fit different 
business requirements. The DMA can recommend the right machine 
for the job. The communication must exist with the business owners to 
understand what they believe are their needs, and then be able to educate 
them on options, alternatives to what can drive the future growth, and be 
the game changer that they are looking for.
Chapter 4  The Database Machine Administrator (DMA)

49
Figure 4-1 shows the choices we have from Oracle machine offerings. 
Some of these machines work together such as Exadata, Zero Data Loss 
Recovery Appliance, ZFS Storage Appliance, and Exalytics Machine. Other 
machines are options instead of Exadata and they are based on point of 
entry, workloads, and size of the enterprise.
Design and architecture decisions come from knowledge about the 
choices and road maps of the systems. The DMA can dive into these areas 
with the understanding of what needs to be supported and how it will 
bring value to the business.
Automation
Simplifying the process with preconfigured machines and machines that 
are engineered for the databases allows the focus to be on other aspects 
of the environment. There is maintenance and monitoring along with 
some administrative tasks that will need to be examined for automated 
processes. Something that is probably executed twice will need to be 
automated. The jobs for backup, configuration checks, and storage 
maintenance should be monitored but not day-to-day tasks because of 
automation.
Figure 4-1.  Oracle machine offerings
Chapter 4  The Database Machine Administrator (DMA)

50
Another aspect of the automation is understanding that all of these 
systems should be supporting self-service. The DMA is enabling these 
services. In providing private cloud and databases access to the DBAs and 
Cloud, DBAs should be able to focus on their part instead of infrastructure 
and server configurations. The ability to be the starting point of these 
services and allow additional automation provisioning and self-service on 
top of that is a goal and the value that the DMA brings to the environment. 
Another goal is to assist others in how to provide the services based on 
features of the underlying infrastructure so that it is not underutilized.
DMA
The DMA is in control of the database machines, from engineered systems 
to appliances. Providing the administration for these servers means more 
than just being a systems DBA. There needs to be understanding in critical 
areas of the systems. They need to support the OS, network, storage, and 
database.
The main tasks for the DMA:
•	
Server OS: Oracle Linux, Solaris
•	
RAC and Data Guard
•	
Enterprise Cloud Control
•	
Backup Software (also Recovery Appliance)
•	
Exadata Architecture and configurations
•	
Implement Exadata features or other engineered 
systems
•	
Storage Cells and ASM
•	
Network and InfiniBand
Chapter 4  The Database Machine Administrator (DMA)

51
•	
Provide automation on server side
•	
Support Self-service databases and applications
•	
Knowledge of server offerings
Conclusion
These are opportunities for DBAs to take system roles into an 
administrator for the database machines that support cloud, databases, 
and other applications. The challenges are available to grow into 
technologies and be involved as these engineered systems provide the 
backbone for the database environments. DBA transformation into a DMA 
is an exciting opportunity for the DBAs that find interest in the main tasks 
and see the value in supporting Cloud DBAs and automation for these 
systems.

CHAPTER 5
Cloud Database 
Administration
The question is out there, “if my databases are in the cloud do we need a 
DBA?” Not a question that DBAs want to hear, but they do want to hear 
that the answer is, “Yes, of course we still need DBAs.” Even with databases 
in the cloud approaching the point of extreme automation and possible 
self-healing, the Cloud DBA has challenges in supporting the environment 
but with valuable database knowledge and insight to the applications, 
utilizing the data as a needed force for successful cloud database 
deployment and maintenance.
The last chapter discussed the DMA, which can be identified more 
with a systems DBA. The Cloud DBA is going to be more associated with 
the application DBA. With database design, data services, and working 
with development teams, the Cloud DBA can step in and be involved in 
these areas and assist by how they can use the databases in the cloud. They 
can also work on additional data projects because they are not worrying 
about the day-to-day keeping-the-lights-on tasks.
Type of Clouds
This is not a type of storm clouds or if you see dragons or bunnies 
floating in the sky, but cloud is a virtualized environment that is specific 
for deploying services such as Database as a Service. Cloud computing 

54
has tools that can deliver these services through web interfaces and 
applications instead of directly accessing servers.
Briefly mentioned in the last chapter was the idea of public and 
private clouds. Typical public cloud offerings are through Oracle, Amazon, 
Microsoft, and Google. These are servers and environments that can 
handle several different workloads from applications and might just 
be application servers and also include databases. Private clouds are 
developed by the enterprise to be kept in the company’s data center and 
the resources will only be shared with internal enterprise users. It is typical 
that both public and private clouds will be used, along with other servers 
that might be classified as non-cloud or traditional technology services. 
Hybrid clouds might have the test environment in a public cloud and 
production in a private cloud.
Tip  A Public cloud is not in the company’s data center, and 
its shared resources and infrastructure are not managed by the 
company, but by the cloud provider. A Private cloud is in the company 
data center, and its infrastructure is managed by the company.  
A Hybrid cloud has some of both – private and public cloud offerings.
There is a wide range of services that can be provided in the cloud, 
and they might have been services that were already being provided in a 
virtualized environment in the data center, which would mean that the 
shift is not as extreme. An environment that has manual intervention 
that is not as automated or standardized. As seen in Table 5-1, there 
are different models and levels of the services in the cloud that can 
be accessed and used by the enterprise. Cloud DBAs have levels of 
involvement in each of these models.
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

55
For private clouds the DMA would be working at the IaaS level and 
creating a platform to provide for a database to be deployed by the Cloud 
DBA. If a public cloud, then the Cloud DBA would be deploying at the 
PaaS level and the DMA would be working with other machines in the data 
center and not involved in this public offering.
At the SaaS level, applications need data access. It might be data in the 
cloud or on-premise. The Cloud DBA will help make connects to the data 
and allow for the connections. The trick here is to monitor and make sure 
that the right connections are being made and only the access from the 
application is coming through.

Figure 5-1 gives the examples of the servers and the Cloud Clients 
including the Cloud DBA that performs their tasks using a web browser 
and other mobile apps. Before we get into the Tools and how to perform 
certain actions, let’s review the tasks of the Cloud DBA.
Tasks
Cloud DBAs perform very similar tasks as on-premise DBAs. The 
database servers, storage, and network are being maintained by the cloud 
infrastructure team, but the database needs to be administered properly.
The typical tasks of backup and recovery, database object 
maintenance, performance tuning, capacity planning, and what a DBA 
is known for needs to be part of the Cloud DBA’s list of activities. The 
connections to the database are slightly different, and access to the server 
directly is not necessarily allowed (unless it is an IaaS cloud environment).
Figure 5-1.  Service Model Examples
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

57
High availability options need to be implemented in the cloud 
to provide the 24x7 uptime. This might not be as clear as to why high 
availability is needed if this is a virtualized environment and should 
have failover built in, but there are also other reasons to implement RAC 
for rolling patching or using the option of implementing Data Guard. 
Recovery through Data Guard and using the high availability options for 
patching and failover will provide additional safety nets for the databases. 
Private clouds might have these options supported by the DMA or even the 
system DBA might support them in the cloud.
With databases in the cloud, they can be implemented using 
containers. The DBA supports these containers either in understanding 
the business requirements that are needed to construct the standardized 
container for each database, or they can create the databases and then 
administer the databases as if it were on-premise. Figure 5-2 has databases 
in the cloud that are automated for baselines, features, and options of the 
database. It is a standard configuration to support monitoring and security. 
This allows many databases to be monitored as one and provisioning of 
database based on a catalog and self-service options.
Figure 5-2.  Cloud Database Tasks
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

58
The creation of the database in the cloud is a small number of clicks 
from the catalog, and a consistent baseline database is created based on 
the options. The baseline will have a set of configurations and security. 
The cloud DBA can be the one that helps design these standards and 
baseline, or it can rely on the already developed containers to deploy. It is 
the understanding that the database being created automatically places 
the features and baselines in place. This does simplify the implementation 
of the database, along with the monitoring because it should not deviate 
from the baseline or standard. Easy checks against the baseline show what 
is different, and abnormalities are easier to detect for security purposes.
Cloud DBAs are going to be instrumental in making sure that data sets 
can talk to each other, which means that this is helping applications get 
the right APIs and restful data sources or helping with connections to the 
various data sources. Additional data areas will be discussed in Chapter 7.
The tasks that we have listed so far for the Cloud DBA:
•	
Ensuring Backup and Recovery
•	
Implementing High Availability
•	
Creating Databases from Catalog
•	
Database and Application Projects
•	
Performance Tuning
•	
Monitoring and Consistency Checks
Additional tasks that we will take a look at for the rest of the chapter are 
these:
•	
Cloud Control
•	
Capacity Planning
•	
Migrations
•	
Patching
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

59
It almost seems like a regular DBA job and task list. However, there 
are more automations and simplified tasks that are part of the cloud 
environment. Along with these tasks come some old and new tools for the 
Cloud DBA to use to accomplish them. The Cloud DBA-Oracle: Managing 
Oracle Database in the Cloud (Apress, 2017) is a great reference.
Tools
Oracle Enterprise Cloud Control is going to assist with on-premise and 
with Oracle cloud databases. On-premise is like the enterprise manager 
and is called cloud control because of the release. Cloud control can be 
used for setting up the configurations and provisioning of the databases. It 
is a tool that is available to connect into database on-premise, in the Oracle 
cloud, and other cloud environments public or private.
Managing Cloud Control is another way a Cloud DBA can be fully 
involved. With other tasks simplified, managing of the tools can be taken 
over to have a well-supported tool. Options that are available in Cloud 
Control will help with managing the database security, objects, and other 
parameters and configurations.
The Cloud Control helps with performance with the tuning tools, 
baselines, and current activity. It allows for management of the various 
databases that have been provisioned, and it is a tool to provision 
additional databases. Depending on the access to Cloud Control, the view 
can show the environment to have the perspective on performance and 
see where bottlenecks might be. Viewing resources in Control Cloud shows 
information not only about performance but capacity.
Another tool for the cloud environment is DBaaSCLI. The DBaaSCLI 
has restful services and APIs for management of a couple of areas for the 
databases. Some of the tasks are not available the same way. The access to

the server is not allowed because it is a cloud environment. This is the tool 
and service console that is now what is used to accomplish the following 
tasks:
•	
Change SYS password
•	
Patch the databases
•	
Rotate master keys for encryption
•	
Data Guard and DR
1.	 Check and configure standby database
2.	 Switchover and failover standby databases
Other database tools will help in supporting objects, privileges, and 
data for development and migrations to production environments. Of 
course, the tools for creating a database are going to be different as it will 
use the DBaaS user interface or another cloud interface that allows for the 
database creation.
Capacity Planning
Some of the planning to move to the cloud environment requires capacity 
planning. It defines the cost of the environment and forecasts growth as 
planning resources for the private cloud or what makes sense to migrate to 
the public cloud. Capacity planning means examining CPU, memory, and 
storage usage and potential growth.
With on-premise database servers, storage planning is to know when 
new disks need to be allocated, but in the cloud, it is validating that the 
charges for the public cloud match the resources being used, and that 
growth matches budget and other planned costs for the databases.
One of many reasons for moving to the Cloud is to be able to have 
flexible resources. But this does not mean that the understanding of the 
resources that the database uses is not needed. If an application consumes 
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

61
more at the end of the month, that is not only an opportunity to tune, but 
an important tracking period to verify that resources are being given since 
they are needed and that the database is not caged. This is the flexibility of 
an on-demand resource.
Discovery
As part of the migration to the cloud, a large discovery process might be 
in order. Discovering the databases that would benefit from the cloud 
by flexible and on-demand resources, the costs of the data center and 
maintaining hardware would be valuable information for the baseline of 
the databases.
Since the cloud is an on-demand environment, others might be 
creating databases and bring applications into the cloud. The advantage of 
the cloud is the capture of creation for chargeback purposes. This is where 
the discovery and capture of the baseline is needed to be able to review the 
initial costs and demand on the system with the increase in capacity and 
whatever resources it requires.
If the public cloud is being used, it might require certain consolidation 
of information of which public cloud is being utilized, details as to 
offerings that are being considered, and baseline costs with resource 
statistics from CPU, memory, and storage. The catalog of databases is still 
a needed tool for the Cloud DBA. The connections and data flows should 
be simple for the applications and data users, but it is the Cloud DBA that 
helps make this possible. It is easier if the cloud is in the data center and 
standardized in a private cloud, but one thing we know as DBAs is that 
there are reasons for different database platforms and there will be reasons 
for private and public clouds and probably more than one public cloud. 
The Cloud DBA is in the position to support this and provide statistics and 
details around these databases.
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

62
A catalog of the databases now includes application, database name, 
database platform, some basic baseline information, levels of high 
availability, cloud database, and location. The discovery along the way will 
continue to support these details and provide capacity information about 
the resources.
Workload and Data Analysis
The discovery is the baseline and the workload analysis provides the 
actuals to verify the forecasts. The workload is the size of the user data, and 
the number of transactions and processes. Sizes of backups of databases 
and movement from cloud to on-premise for any of these operations are 
included in the data analysis.
Examination of the workload should have details about the elasticity or 
constant activity of the processes. This is a critical question about handling 
workload and peaks for the cloud environment and how they plan to size it 
and provide additional resources.
The initial questions to evaluate the cloud platform should include 
these options, on-demand elasticity, data migrations from cloud to 
on-premise, and on-premise to cloud. These should be part of the cost 
evaluation to understand, depending on the workload and if the right 
platform is selected. This type of activity falls with the Cloud DBA because 
of the knowledge they possess about database environments, and they are 
probably already collecting these statistics and if not complete, they have 
the know-how to acquire it. Also important is the sensitivity for the data 
analysis for security.
The planning and estimates should provide the details to measure 
and compare the actuals. The discovery and workload analysis feeds the 
collection of the statistics to make it more predictable and prepare for 
future environments and growth.
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

63
Security
Security features of the cloud environment can then be configured to 
protect the data. The Cloud DBA is going to understand data protection 
and how to utilize the database features to prevent unauthorized access 
to the data. Security options are available but they need to be used and 
implemented.
In Oracle Cloud the databases come with the Oracle database security 
features. For example, encryption is enabled and tablespaces will need to 
be created using encrypt tablespace. The Cloud DBA needs to secure the 
database, the data at rest through encryption, and access controls using 
roles for authorizations. Auditing policies need to be enabled for auditing 
of the databases and monitoring of the activity.
The security options are part of the DBaaS Catalog and there are 
mandatory security features along with the options. Depending on 
the data compliance, regulations will apply. Installing the security 
components may not be necessary. However, implementing security will 
protect the data and the auditing will verify that the controls are in place.
Separation of Duties almost comes along with the fact that the 
database is in the cloud. The administration teams do not have access to 
the data, and the Cloud DBA does not have access to the server. It is now 
just dependent on making sure that data is isolated and protected through 
access controls and even using features such as an Oracle Database Vault 
to protect the data from highly privileged users. Security available  
on-­demand with resources and databases seems to make it simpler for 
the Cloud DBA. 
Migrations
This might actually be the first step in becoming a Cloud DBA, migrating 
to the cloud. Migrating to the cloud is a transforming process. It can be 
several systems at once or selectively choosing the databases for the 
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

64
types of cloud environments that they will best function in. As part of the 
transformation, the Cloud DBA can help along this journey.
The research should bring to the front details about cost savings, 
options for data access, and efficient mobile support. Cloud environments 
can provide an on-demand system that will allow the developers to work 
in and possibly bring the production environment back to a private cloud. 
This will highlight the business justification to move to the cloud and 
where it makes sense to be in a private cloud or stay on-premise.
The discovery pieces in capacity planning include looking at the 
baselines and reviewing the database sizing and analysis to determine 
which type of cloud infrastructure is going to support the migration. The 
questions also need to be asked to understand the roles the Cloud DBA is 
going to play.
Questions around maintenance schedules, workload capacity, and 
costs of data movement are a few to make note of to have answered 
before starting migrations. Understanding the responsibilities for the 
environment will prevent being able to restore or failover to DR. Main 
areas for understanding if it is the cloud provider or the Cloud DBA:
•	
Backups
•	
Patching
•	
High Availability
•	
Managing Failovers
•	
Managing Files and Backups
•	
Outage Reporting
The migrations do not stop once the database has moved over to the 
cloud. There are ongoing processes for a few reasons. There might be 
new data that will need to be migrated to the cloud. There might need 
to be a restore of a database on-premise to either perform tasks, test, or 
troubleshoot a problem. There are reasons to move data either for a new 
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

65
migration or in support of development environments. These types of data 
migrations need to be supported by the Cloud DBA. There should be a few 
different options to moving data such as cloning, attaching PDBs, and even 
Data Pump.
Migrations along with capacity planning can keep a Cloud DBA for 
quite awhile. Even though more databases are planned to be in the cloud, 
the future growth and movement of data between public, private, and on-­
premise is going to continue. It will help this migration to the Cloud help 
the on-demand environment grow.
Application vs. Cloud DBA
After examining all of the tasks of the Cloud DBA, there is similarity to a 
typical DBA. There are system tasks with backups and high availability, 
and there are object changes and data migrations. It is just different 
where the tasks are being accomplished. The installations are handled, 
configurations are in place with DBaaS options and deployments, but 
there is a need for understanding the databases and managing the 
activity in them. There are utilities that are used, but knowing to perform 
operations and looking to use automations when possible is the value of 
the Cloud DBA.
Transformation of the DBA to cloud is important for the databases 
in cloud to be successful for the applications. There is knowledge that 
the DBA possesses that provides the insight on tuning and capacity 
planning that is critical for the environment growth and performance. 
There are additional tasks that the Cloud DBA will perform that are not a 
complete match to the Application DBA, but since the database is using 
infrastructure in a private or public cloud the Cloud DBA does not have 
some of the tasks of the System DBA. Table 5-2 is a demonstration of some 
of the differences in tasks of the Application and Cloud DBA.
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

66
Understanding that some of the tasks that are not checked as an 
Application DBA might actually be performed by some Application DBAs, 
and on the other side maybe the backups and recovery might not be 
performed. This is just an average number of DBA tasks to start to compare 
the importance of DBAs embracing the cloud environment and seeing 
what new opportunities are available.
Database creation does become self-service and on-demand, which 
means that application teams can also perform these tasks but then rely on 
the DBAs to help with maintenance, tuning, and future growth. Since the 
DBaaS service supplies the container and catalog for the databases, a DBA 
can be involved in creating the options and configurations that are in the 
DBaaS catalog.

DBaaS DBA vs. Cloud DBA
A DBA can work more on the development side and work with the 
containers. The DBA will need to understand what options and parameters 
can be configured and implemented as a standard across all of the 
databases. This will be the baseline of the DBaaS catalog. New features 
need to be researched by the DBA for compatibility with the DBaaS 
container. Having a DBA as part of the development team for DBaaS 
delivers a service that has the knowledge integrated into it for the best 
possible configuration. The basic database deployment will provide 
features that are needed and can be used by all. There can be different 
levels of support, security, or features that are in the catalog available to 
the applications.
The different levels are not selecting the specific parameters, it is 
selecting a service such as a high security option, warehouse database, 
or a level of performance. The grouping of options and parameters is the 
job of the DBA working on DBaaS. They develop the levels and know what 
belongs to those options. This also requires knowledge of the platform that 
the DBaaS databases are going to be deployed.
The Cloud DBA will use the DBaaS catalog and level choices in the 
catalog to create the databases in the cloud, and the DBaaS DBA will build 
the blocks and containers needed for the service. A DBaaS DBA will need 
to understand different programming languages, database development, 
and configurations. The DBaaS DBA will need to understand more of 
the infrastructure and the underlying cloud details with servers and 
OS to ensure that the containers will deploy properly in the cloud. The 
DBaaS DBA will test the containers and need to make sure that they can 
test the levels of services of the database. The validation of the database 
configurations and parameters can make sure that the databases are 
going to perform as expected and be turned over to the Cloud DBA for 
management.
Chapter 5  Cloud Database Administration

68
Conclusion
A transformation to a Cloud DBA might be an easy path, and there are a 
few challenges as new tools need to be learned and become part of the 
day-to-day activities. Monitoring the databases for performance, security, 
and capacity is emphasized in the cloud. The options might be part of 
the options of the DBaaS and Cloud databases, but understanding the 
workings of the database will allow for the proper setup of the database in 
the cloud.
Migrations to the cloud create a whole new set of challenges, and the 
right questions need to be asked to make sure that responsibilities and 
services are clear so that the Cloud DBA can fill in the other activities and 
validate the other services and management of the cloud provider.
There are many databases that will be moving to public, private 
clouds, or both, and DBAs can be ready to support the migration and 
administration of the databases in cloud with the understanding of the 
roles and tasks that are utilizing the DBA’s knowledge and skills.

CHAPTER 6
Database Security
Now we are at my favorite part of the book where I recruit you all to switch 
over to the security side. It is an area that you have to be passionate about 
because some days there is just one grant too many, but if you are a control 
freak and like solving puzzles, it is definitely something to consider. Wait, 
did I just call myself a control freak? Well, most DBAs are, but it is part of 
our superpowers, and we are just using them on the security side.
Security is everyone’s responsibility, probably something you have 
heard before, but it is true. Protection of the company assets (data being 
the focus asset) is for everyone to participate in. The DBAs as the guardians 
of the data have a unique position and higher responsibility with the 
privileged access that has been entrusted to us. We have opportunities to 
drive security initiatives that reduce the risks in the database environments.
A DBA transformation to a security engineer or to the security is a 
logical step because of the skill sets both technical and soft skills. The 
database provides ways to secure the data and the DBAs know the  
day-­to-­day tasks that still need to be accomplished while also securing the 
privileged users.
Security Teams
Migrating over to a security team does not mean you have abandoned 
your DBA friends. It also does not mean that you can play a spy for the 
DBAs and continue to have possible risks in the environment. Moving to 

70
the security team provides the working knowledge and technical skills 
to leverage the database to secure the systems and reduce risk across the 
enterprise.
Even though most of the security teams have been focused on network 
and protecting the perimeter, thoughts of not being able to get to the 
data have been considered. The database security to look specifically at 
protecting data assets is now something that security teams are looking to 
add and take the activity and audit logs from the databases to incorporate 
that into the overall security posture of the enterprise. The problem is a 
shortage of security engineers and qualified individuals to join the security 
teams, and plenty of people are needed because of the work and growth in 
this area.
Note  DBAs transforming to the security team bring a greater 
understanding of what jobs need to be accomplished while being 
able to secure the data.
Just watching the news and seeing the next data breach has convinced 
companies that they need to invest in security and make it a priority. 
That doesn’t mean there are always resources, like people or time from 
other teams, but working on security allows the DBA to help prioritize the 
project and security work for the databases.
There is education that happens with security teams too. Depending 
on their backgrounds they might have different expectations of the 
database security, and clarification is going to allow the right security 
rules and policies to be put into place. There are even defaults that 
come with databases that should be discussed with the security team 
to take advantage of already existing security and look to what can be 
standardized across the enterprise.
Chapter 6  Database Security

71
Building a Team
There will be opportunities to build out database security teams. The team 
will work closely with the security teams to understand the auditing issues, 
policies, and priorities in the company for the security projects. The team 
will also work closely with the database teams as they will be part of the 
solution and project, whether they will be implementing it or observers 
of it. Remember the discussion of the soft skills that DBAs have naturally 
developed over the years, this is the perfect opportunity to utilize them. 
The collaboration between teams and communication will allow the DBA 
to transition to security and work on building a team of security engineers 
for implementation of database security.
The characteristics of a team are enterprise thinking, database skills, 
and willingness to continue to learn and research. Enterprise thinking 
is important because in large environments, manual processes are not 
going to be sustainable. The big picture is to include all of the possible 
database platforms and minimize solutions. Definitely not one solution 
fits all mentally, but how can a solution support and automate as much as 
possible to cover ground on many databases.
Teaching database experience is one way to develop this characteristic 
on the team, or teaching security is the other way to go. Most DBAs have 
been exposed to security just from the grants and roles that are created 
in the database. Also teaching an area that is not the main focus of the 
tasks might distract from the understanding of the database. Either way, a 
database security team member should have experience in one area and 
be able to learn in the other.
There are always new and not-so-new ways to use exploits and 
vulnerabilities. There are new tools that might make security easier. Just 
as with the database environments and how DBAs have constantly been 
learning the features and new releases, the security team is constantly 
researching and learning – good skills to have as a database professional, 
technology person, even just basically in life.
Chapter 6  Database Security

72
Security on DBA Team
Another option for database security is to take a couple of DBAs and just 
designate them with the security role. They would not shift over to the 
security team. This helps with some of the implementation of the security 
products and the DBAs with the security role can handle this effort. 
However, in being on the same team there might be a conflict of interest 
and the separation of duties might become blurred.
Staying as a DBA with just the focus of security can also make it 
difficult to just focus on security. Other priorities come up and other 
tasks might get in the way of the security. There are ways with roles to 
separate out Security DBAs from System and Application DBAs, so use 
of these roles will make it possible to only have the access needed. With 
these separations of duties for the DBAs, the reporting structure up to the 
database or security teams might not be as important.
Coordination with both the security and database is important. 
Knowledge and understanding of the database is important to have in 
order to effectively implement various security products and options. After 
team decisions are made and set up, the next step is to look at the security 
to be implemented and see how transforming from DBA will make sense.
Security Planning
Securing the database environment is a process. There are several 
configurations and products working together to provide the security. The 
planning needs to match up the enterprise security policies, compliance, 
and regulations with what is being implemented. Examples of standards 
can be found in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
Cyber Security Framework, if one set does not exist in your company. Even 
if one does, it might be worth evaluating it against the NIST cybersecurity 
framework.
Chapter 6  Database Security

73
Figure 6-1 stacks the different focus areas for these policies and what 
the security projects are going to fall under for implementation. They 
highlight the issues with the database environment that needs to have 
security wrapped around it for protecting the data.
Figure 6-1.  Main Areas where security is needed
Authentication and authorization will handle password management 
and level of privileges. Ideally this would be a centralized repository 
for managing the users in the database. For Microsoft SQL Server, this 
would typically be Active Directory, and for Oracle either Oracle Unified 
Directory with Active Directory or other LDAP for users. The database 
user can be stored in one place and have security privileges managed with 
group access.
Data protection covers data at rest, in transit, and when accessed in 
the databases. Encryption of data at rest and in transit will protect the data 
files. Highly privileged users need to be handled differently to prevent 
Chapter 6  Database Security

74
unauthorized access to sensitive data. Activity monitoring sits on top of 
these configurations to confirm the proper controls and audit access and 
activity.
Regulations and compliance rules might be different for the location of 
the data or new rules might apply. It is a piece that security professionals 
need to understand the business, data, and requirements for the 
environment to comply to these regulations. For example, the General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will require any company with data 
from a citizen of the EU to comply with the regulation. The regulation 
needs to be reviewed and processes will need to be implemented to handle 
reporting a data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware. Notification is 
not the only process but the removal of the data from the system can also 
be requested. Security teams need to work with the database teams to get 
these processes and rules in place. Knowing the database like a DBA is 
definitely going to accelerate the ability to accomplish this.
Vulnerabilities and risk can be reduced with patching and maintaining 
the secure baselines. Patching has become easier for several database 
environments but still requires testing and managing of users’ expectations 
of what maintenance windows and outages may occur. It is important to 
consider that the security fixes patch-known vulnerabilities so that reduces 
the risk in the environment.
Reducing Risk
Analyzing the risk in an environment helps to decide priorities and 
recognize the risks that are there. It allows for evaluation of the effort to 
reduce the risks and possible outcomes if it is not addressed. With all of 
the moving parts and how access is needed to the data, it is not likely that 
a database will be 100% secure, unless there was no access allowed to the 
server or database, and even then what if there was a backup that could be 
compromised.
Chapter 6  Database Security

75
The experienced DBA brings important understanding of the 
risks in the databases. There is knowledge about gap and if certain 
configurations are implemented how that protects or leaves other gaps in 
the environment. As DBAs are transforming to security, additional work 
is done focused on security to manage risk, where previous experience is 
focused on performance, resources, or other component of the database. 
This is a combination of the soft skills that are developed by the DBA to 
research the environment, create a plan, and communicate with various 
groups the discovered details and proposals of what to do about it.
For reducing risk, this is a high level of activities that are performed, 
including a loop back to review and test again.
•	
Understand the Risk
•	
Develop Mitigation Plan
•	
Report the Issue along with Mitigation Plan
•	
Evaluate Cost (Time/Money/Resources) to Mitigate
•	
Prioritize Efforts
•	
Review Risks Again
Security planning is based on this research of the risks in the 
environment and what has already been implemented to protect the 
data. Again, it is a continuous process to reduce risk in the database 
environment. Implementing security options, configurations, and 
products will work in preventing access to the data or performing 
malicious attacks on the environment.
Monitoring is a way to start to reduce risk and be able to know what 
is running and verify the configurations. The next step would be to 
be able to proactively handle the risk, and block malicious activity or 
unauthorized access from happening. This is a process to first understand 
which view into the environment helps to protect, then actually blocking 
and preventing for additional risk reductions. The process continues to 
Chapter 6  Database Security

76
monitor if there is any other activity that needs to be blocked. It almost 
sounds like a tuning process or troubleshooting, and it is very similar just 
focused on security.
The Security DBA will be able to identify risks, plan to mitigate the 
risks, prioritize, and communicate the risk and details of the remediation 
steps.
Cloud Security
We already discussed cloud database security in the previous chapter. 
However, as part of the security team, the scope is to incorporate the 
security plan of the cloud databases with policies to the overall security 
posture. The security offerings of the cloud need to be implemented and it 
is part of the security team to validate that the features are being used. The 
Cloud DBAs will be implementing the features and the Security DBA will 
be able to monitor and audit the security as seen in Figure 6-2. The cloud 
environment does simplify and reduce risk because of the automation and 
baselines that are implemented.
Figure 6-2.  Standardization Security in the Cloud
Chapter 6  Database Security

77
Cloud database provide the baselines, and in a similar role the security 
professional can influence the options and levels of security that are 
needed in the cloud. These would be deployed consistently across the 
databases, which does simplify the auditing and validation of the security 
configuration.
Oracle database cloud will be providing databases that are 
autonomous and learning to handle malicious activity on the database. 
The computers are being trained to recognize this abnormal activity and 
can react faster than receiving an alert and especially read a very large 
report. The database can patch itself and apply the security fixes and not 
wait for a DBA to schedule a maintenance window, and they can still have 
the data available. This doesn’t remove the need for database knowledge, 
as security and others are discussed in this book as opportunities to use 
these skills and gain new ones. Instead of having to worry about applying 
the patches, the focus can be other risks in the environment.
With databases in the cloud, security options should be researched, 
implemented, and validated. Options for the database in the different 
cloud providers can provide various levels of security. The Cloud DBA 
would be implementing the security options and the Security DBA will be 
reporting and verifying it.
Auditing and Reporting
Auditing can be accomplished in many ways, and the audit or reporting is 
only useful if it is being used. The security reports need to be reviewed for 
the abnormal activity and drift in configurations. Notifications and alerting 
would grab the attention of the security team to start drilling into any 
issue. These are all components of the monitoring and auditing from the 
security side. Policies are put into place for gathering details around highly 
privileged users and execution of certain activities. For many databases it 
is not something that can be accomplished manually, but it needs to be 
looked at analytically.
Chapter 6  Database Security

78
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools can be 
used to gather these logs and analyze the data from the security logs for 
trends, which are behaviors to detect anomalies. DBA transformation to 
learn SIEM tools is a great possibility and leverages SIEM to report on the 
needed information and weed through the noise of a busy databases.
Configuration drift is part of the audit and checking because even 
if there are controls in place, there might be unauthorized access, a gap 
before the next level is implemented, or a new exploit being discovered. 
Auditing the configurations and baselines will be needed for the audits 
and provide opportunities to address the issues and understand what else 
might be happening. The security team can also be updating baselines 
as new features are implemented or change in versions or platform of the 
database require new standards.
Audit policies also need to be implemented and researched by the 
security team. They can make sure that as databases and applications 
change, the right information is being captured. There might be 
other information that flows through the SIEM tool that is gathered to 
provide even better policies and other details. Audit policies are based 
on the enterprise policies and what is being met in the security tool 
implementations. Checks and validations can be set up to automatically 
check and report on.
Automation Security
Individual policies and databases are not going to each be examined by 
the security team. They need tools and automation to make this happen. 
Just as with the new offerings from cloud databases, the trend is for the 
database and technology to handle the work. Self-driving databases are 
what Oracle is talking about. This gives us the answers and information, 
but policies and some of the actions need to be determined by the Security 
Chapter 6  Database Security

79
DBA. It can let the database patch for remediation of known issues but 
processes need to be developed for automation and included to match up 
processes and checks.
With the amount of security and audit logging, automation of 
reviewing to provide alerts or proactive changes needs to be part of the 
database environment for security.
Addressing Vulnerabilities
Addressing vulnerabilities is not just about patching, ok mostly about 
patching but it does require some additional information. As risk is being 
reduced in an environment through other security measures, it might not 
be as easy to exploit. The pieces and controls in the environment need 
to be included in the assessment. Even with database applying its own 
patches and reducing risk, vulnerabilities that are outside of the software 
or built into other application code need to be examined.
DBAs are use to testing and working through upgrades and after 
patching and patch sets are applied. Security fixes might be part of the 
first set of fixes, but additional areas might be covered as part of a bigger 
patch set.
Security teams need to take into consideration the various tools, 
monitoring, auditing, and blocking that is configured to provide weighted 
details about the risk. Weighted scores for vulnerabilities are part of the 
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and is from National 
Vulnerability Database. The list of vulnerabilities and scores are reported 
here with details about the vulnerability. This information along with any 
vendor information can be used to assess the risk in the current environment.
The vulnerabilities are another reason that database knowledge on 
the security team is important, as details of how it can be exploited might 
not mention much information, but a DBA might understand it more and 
realize that it is a higher or lower risk then scored.
Chapter 6  Database Security

80
Security Learning
DBAs enjoy that they are always learning. There are new databases 
platforms, cloud environments, and new security risks and vulnerabilities. 
The security teams also have to continue to learn and research the details 
of possible exploits and research issues that might have happened. There 
are tools that are being used and with AI, the databases and machines are 
also learning.
Learning is not just one sided with the security teams. Education has to 
be passed along to others. The database options are not going to fill in all 
of the gaps, so education is around what layers of security are handling the 
different risks.
Instruction around access and process helps to explain how they 
should be participating in the security in the environment. DBAs are 
focused on the development or systems of high availability to get their 
tasks done. They are not focused on the security and even though they may 
be concerned about the access, they might not know or understand the 
tools that they have to implement the security.
As the security team, design, process, and documentation need to be 
created to provide to the DBAs and others using the database to include 
them in the processes. These will keep the environments consistent and 
using the same secure configurations. Information around auditing will 
also help to keep them honest with the procedures and processes as well 
as protect them from activity that might occur.
Providing new information and project planning for overall enterprise 
security needs education for the various teams. DBAs will be interested to 
know the perimeter security around their databases and the other teams 
will receive information on how the data is being protected. Allow the 
teams to understand the security requirements and become part of the 
projects and solutions to support the security initiatives for the databases 
in the future too.
Chapter 6  Database Security

81
The Security DBA needs to be able to explain to management about 
the potential risks and help them to comprehend the priorities of the risk 
remediation. It is not the same as putting permissions on a file for read, 
write access. The granularity of the database security is much deeper. 
The solutions and risk mitigation for the solutions are going to be more 
complex and detailed. The databases also affect other applications and how 
they behave so the layers of applications to database must be taken into 
consideration with the security of the system. Explanations and education up 
and down the company ladder are requirements for any security professional 
to help inform and help in making decisions for what comes next.
The Security Professional is going to be securing the database 
environment. There are serious concerns about the vulnerabilities, issues, 
and other risks associated with database access and unauthorized access 
from internal and external sources. Figure 6-3 shows the security solution 
stack to start with in applying encryption, privilege management especially 
for privileged users, least privilege roles and groups, monitoring and 
auditing, and patching that will help protect against vulnerabilities.

Conclusion
In the cloud or on-premise the database security is a responsibility of a 
team. The security team can support the enterprise policies and baselines 
in the database. It is the knowledge of the database that makes it easier 
to know where the risks are and prioritize the initiatives. The DBA that 
is transitioning to the security role has the opportunity to learn skills for 
managing the security and audit logs in SIEM tools. DBAs can utilize 
their skill set in order to design how to mitigate vulnerabilities and risk 
in the environment. With automation processes, the monitoring analysis 
becomes preventative actions to protect the data.

CHAPTER 7
Data Professionals
It is all about the data. There is value in the data and as more information 
becomes available through mobile and IOT devices, our imaginations start 
to bring us ideas of the potential of what can be realized with the right data.
Just like inventions, there are reasons and purpose for needing 
something that triggers ideas of what can be developed. Several areas 
of data already follow these innovations. Sports, retail, health care, 
manufacturing, marketing, and plenty of other industries see data as a 
company asset. The enterprise realizes the importance of data and has 
many data sources, but it needs the direction of what to do with this 
information. Analyzing the data and providing questions to ask is the 
competitive edge in using the data.
Over the past few years the office of the Chief Data Officer (CDO) has 
developed to become an integral part of more enterprises. The role is to 
manage and provide governance for the highly valuable data assets of the 
company. The data that flows through the company and realizing that 
there is more information to gather requires a team of individuals strictly 
focused on the business needs for data and architecting where data is 
available and ensuring the quality of the data.
DBAs that have been working on data services and other data 
workflows can find ways to transform into the data professional. They can 
provide guidance on how the data is captured, used, and distributed to 
other applications and provide the know-how of the database processes to 
efficiently work with the data.

84
Data Quality
Data coming in through different sources will have to go through data 
quality processes. There are controls and tagging of the data to ensure that 
it is accurate, classified, and complete. Companies will have various types 
of data all needing governance on how it can be used and what needs to be 
secured. Also available are external data sources that can fill in gaps and 
additional attributes to provide a complete data set to be used.
Master Data Management (MDM) is generally what is considered 
as the overall work for data quality. MDM can be part of any system that 
pulls data through work processes and offers data services as the system of 
record or the golden data set. There needs to be a catalog that will provide 
details about the data classification and how it should be used and the 
source of the data. DBAs are supporting these processes and management 
of data in the databases. They have the insight to improve data processing 
and where data is available to include additional attributes.
Data models and flow will be known to help them transform into more 
of a data profession to plan, develop, and integrate processes to support 
MDM and especially data quality. Data quality is an interesting process 
and is continuous because new data is always coming and new sources are 
made available. The quality follows a development process. The following 
is how to look at that process:
•	
Gather requirements for the needed data
•	
Gather information about the sources
•	
Write procedures to bring in data
•	
Write procedures to fill in the required attributes  
and gaps
•	
Write procedures to validate the data (remove 
duplicates, incomplete data)
Chapter 7  Data Professionals

85
•	
Capture data issues
•	
Write processes to address data issues
•	
Perform cleansing processes
•	
Validate against data requirements
This list includes the writing of procedures and running through 
the process that is the testing and development of the data quality 
workflow. After being tested, validated, and deployed, the procedures 
would run automatically. Some of the data issues might require manual 
intervention to figure out what the issue is, but then they can be included 
in the cleansing process. The business requirements can change, which 
will mean that the procedures and cleansing processes will need to be 
modified.
MDM is not a simple decision and requires efforts from everyone 
involved in the data sources and use of the data. These projects are 
developed based on sources of data needed and business questions and 
processes to get the needed information in the right hands to execute 
upon them.
Tip  MDM is not just the job of the DBA, and it is difficult to do 
data cleansing if other processes are not on board with the quality 
of the data. Business requirement, development effort, and data 
professionals along with the business need to work together to 
support MDM.
Working on these processes, developing code to be executed as part 
of data quality is part of a database developer type role and is a transition 
for a DBA to focus specially on these areas. The database system is going 
to require less hands-on maintenance and administration, which opens 
up this opportunity to look at data processes. Providing data source and 
Chapter 7  Data Professionals

86
services is going to be critical for the enterprises’ business processes and 
understanding the available data is going to lead to better questions. Better 
questions about the data will lead to new opportunities and hopefully 
provide a competitive edge with customers and other business partners.
Data quality and governance also supplies analytics and analysis 
of the data. Analytics are performed on many data sets to get answers 
to questions. There are plenty of uses for this in companies, but as an 
example, think of your spending habits and location details being collected 
for credit card suppliers to detect potential misuse of credit cards and 
identity theft issues.
Having sources that are not the golden source of data or uncleansed 
data is not going to produce accurate analytics or analysis of the data. If 
there are gaps in the location of the use of the credit card that might not 
be able to supply that, the card is being used in two different places and it 
could be fraud or other issues with the credit card account. Early detection 
of this and details will depend on how fast the data can move through the 
analysis process that the data is going through; this is a logical place for a 
DBA to step in to help with performance and even look how the analytics 
are performing on the processes. The knowledge of the DBA can cleanse 
and transform the data that is part of the analytics.
Data quality frameworks are available to work from that to match up 
the data quality steps with business requirements. Figure 7-1 shows the 
process of going through a framework for data quality.
Chapter 7  Data Professionals

87
Classification of the data will also contain data that needs specific keys 
about personal and sensitive data. Classifying data will allow other security 
and business processes to utilize that knowledge about the data to make 
sure that it is properly secured and only made available to authorized uses.
The CDO office and teams work to handle MDM and the data quality 
processes. They work with the business to understand what data sources 
are needed and the business requirements for data analytics. They take 
the sources of the data and provide the governance and workflows. 
The classification of the data is not just important for the business but 
extremely beneficial for technology processes. This can provide additional 
information about the data source and if it is the source of record and 
information about security. Security tools can use classification of the data 
for monitoring and access controls.
Figure 7-1.  Data Quality Steps
Chapter 7  Data Professionals

88
Data Integrations
The data sources do not just sit alone. They become even more powerful 
when they work together. There are enough challenges with data quality 
and understanding the details about the source of the data, but combine 
that with data coming from different platforms and with different 
descriptions of the data. Hopefully the CDO will be working toward 
standardizing the details around the data details and classifications, so 
the only challenge is to be able to combine the data into a single source 
without losing data changes from the system of record.
DBAs have opportunity here to maintain data sources, how to 
integrate the data and design processes to allow for simple integrations 
to other sources. Data integration tools are available to catalog the 
business rules and keep the definitions of the integration process. It has 
ways to implement data quality procedures and keep a system of record 
information. The DBA transformation can be with learning new tools such 
as Oracle Data Integrator (ODI). ODI is a tool specifically to create the 
process and procedures for the data integrations. It is an ongoing process 
and there are consistently new data that is required by the business or used 
to enhance current sources. These tools are additional to the database 
tools, but with the understanding of database objects, they are something 
that DBAs can master.
Not all of the data sources are going to be in databases. There are going 
to be different forms of data, such as APIs or files. There might be extract, 
load, transform (ETL) processes needed to use the source. Then there is 
being able to use the data in sources closest to the golden copy to prevent 
duplication and synchronization issues.
Chapter 7  Data Professionals

89
Figure 7-2 is a way to look at processes and data sources that can make 
up the data integrations. There is quite a bit of effort for designing a robust 
integration for the data, because it takes in all of these details just discussed 
in data quality, conversations with the business to understand the data 
strategies, and exploring the sources of different data sources available.
Data professionals are going to work with data integration tools, test 
data quality, maintain business rules, and continue to review the rules and 
data sources. The processes of ETL and producing APIs are going to be 
constantly monitored and challenges come with real-time data and speed 
of which the data is needed for the business.
BIG DATA
Big Data is not about large amounts of data. It is about data coming in 
structured or non-structured form with high velocity. Big Data is going to 
use other technology platforms such as Hadoop, NoSQL, and Massively 
Parallel Processing (MPP) databases. The data collection can be coming 
in from sources such as IOT devices, social media, and even several public 
sources of data sets.
Figure 7-2.  Data Integration Data and Processes
Chapter 7  Data Professionals

90
DBAs can currently be pulling in big data sources into the relational 
databases to provide full data sources in other systems. The opportunities 
here for the DBA are to learn the Big Data technologies. Hadoop is a 
platform that can process the data coming in from devices and other 
data sets. It is not necessarily the administration of the technologies or 
platforms, but how to use them and use the data sets to integrate with 
other database systems.
As we look into a data professional, you can notice that these processes 
start with data quality, and then proceeds to data integrations and repeat 
data quality. Each step along the way might be looking at data quality. 
The velocity and amount of data that comes in with the Big Data sources 
challenges these processes to see if data quality matters or if certain pieces 
of the data is what is important. The data might be used for analytics in a 
way that just the processes need to run and not all require the complete 
data set. There are several details to consider when looking at these data 
sets and are they available to augment the existing data that is collected 
through another Big Data process or the relational data. Also think about 
the security that is needed for data. If it is public information, it might not 
need the security processes in place until it is integrated with other data. 
This integration might become the company’s intellectually property.
Business intelligence is based on all of the data points that are coming 
in from Big Data sources, other data integrations, and then the algorithms 
can help provide the data science around the details. The questions are 
part of the business intelligence to answer the right questions and provide 
answers or start to provide direction to make decisions.
Data professionals are managing the Big Data processes, using the 
new tools that come with it. Understanding how to use Hadoop, analytical 
processes, and other NoSQL databases are going to be key for this area. 
The public data sources with data that is collected is going to be available 
to use as part of the business strategies for data and integrations.
Chapter 7  Data Professionals

91
Conclusion
DBAs have the knowledge of where data is available or have at least an idea 
when data moves. It is normally a process that they have been involved 
in from the beginning. Even if it was not to know what the data is being 
used for, it could be to improve the speed of the process or help make the 
appropriate connections or load data into the database.
These interactions with the data are a foundation for moving more 
into the data field. However, most of the movement, migrations, and 
loading of the data should become automated processes. The databases 
still house the information and being able to catalog the data and provide 
the details about the metadata builds the components of what the data is 
about and how it can be used.
The teams under the CDO are looking for that knowledge and 
understanding about how to use, move, and integrate data to meet 
business needs. The data is a valuable company asset that can be 
underutilized if the knowledge is not there on how to use it or what 
questions it can answer.
Information is captured at a single point in time; these are our data 
records. This will get fed into a system to be able to gather details around 
all of this information and provide knowledge and analysis about the 
data of what it means, how it applies to the business, and what can be 
learned by it. This is the knowledge that is trying to be understood and 
comprehended by the applications to translate what that means to 
business processes. As data points change over time, they are captured 
and provides combined sets of data for decision making and business 
intelligence.
The collection of the data and applying the business rules give us the 
insight into the data. They knowledge of the data is based over time and 
collection of the information. As the sources are explored and how they 
should be utilized are part of the knowledge of the data, and the processes 
Chapter 7  Data Professionals

92
and workflows provide the other pieces for understanding the sources.  
It is the applications and business processes that make it possible to have 
the knowledge about what the data is telling us and how it applies to the 
business and even technology processes.
DBAs have the opportunity to work even closer with the data. 
Data quality and integrations are part of the data processes that are 
run to provide accurate and complete data to answer questions and 
provide business knowledge back to the business. These data sources 
and understanding how to manage and utilize them are what data 
professionals do. The DBA transformation comes with wanting to support 
the business strategies with the business intelligence provided by efficient, 
standardized, and accurate data processes. The data professional will 
perform these tasks to cleanse and attach to the data source to the correct 
workflows. Automation of the processes will not be removing the need for 
DBAs or Data Professionals because the knowledge and understanding 
of the data flows still needs to be mapped and processes is part of that 
education to become a data professional.

CHAPTER 8
The Art of Automation
DBAs learn that if they have to perform a task twice, it is worth the time 
and effort to automate it. There are scripts, and multiple scripts are part 
of the DBA arsenal. It feels that there is not always the time to automate 
because there is a way to quickly execute a script and pass along a script 
for further management. However, in the environments that we will be 
dealing with, automation is essential. There are too many databases, and 
the more tasks and times they are executed, it allows for the possibility of 
an error of a manual action to occur.
Automation prevents tasks from being skipped and be logged along 
with the script changes going through change control. Automation is an art 
of recognizing patterns that should not require hands-on keyboard and a 
state that is desired. Just as with security, data quality, and other processes, 
this is an iterative cycle. The tasks can be automated, and then new tasks 
and other processes that were not first considered can be added to the 
list. It can start with the initial database tasks, look to other components 
such as security, data migrations, and reach out to application with an 
additional circle of automation, including the environment tasks.
The art of automation requires reviewing older processes that might 
have been automated already and verify that they are still a valid way of 
doing things. The DBA scripts several processes with previous versions of 
the database, and the new features need to be updated in the scripts. The 
possibility of automating updates would be interesting but might not be 
possible. The circle of automation might start with some administration 
tasks and then continue to incorporate more and more. The attempt to 

94
automate everything might make sense, but there might be difficulties 
with some jobs, and review with new releases of the tools and databases to 
leverage to implement the automations.
DBA transformation understands the patterns of the tasks and 
workflows to be able to instruct which jobs and tasks should be automated. 
Even once jobs are automated, there are other opportunities to include 
new tasks or review any gaps or processes that should be considered. The 
application processes can then be included as well as other processes of 
the environment.
Tasks 
There are many areas of the databases that can be automated. On the 
operations side, jobs like backups, patching, storage, and high availability 
tasks can have automated processes in place. Other options might be to 
look for tuning and security automations. Automating tasks is ongoing 
and it is not to take away from the positions of the DBAs but free up 
opportunities to perform other jobs in working on projects and reviewing 
various details of the databases such as new features.
Table 8-1 has a list of tasks that seem to be manual or might be 
something that is still being run manually because of resource constraints.

The tasks listed in Table 8-1 are just a sample of the various jobs that 
can be automated either through scripts that can be scheduled or part of a 
process that gets executed and passes criteria to the next job for execution.
Chapter 8  The Art of Automation

96
Dependencies
Automations can come with dependencies in the system: either a task 
that must run first or a piece of data that is needed. An action can trigger 
another action and a piece of data that is needed can trigger another 
action. This is sometimes why automations might not be put in place 
because of complexities of the systems or steps that have to be followed.  
I will argue that it is for this reason that jobs like this need to be automated. 
Anytime that there is a dependency and a task requires a pre- or post-step 
these should be sequenced automated jobs.
The database provides DBMS_SCHEDULER and can handle multiple 
steps and passing in of values to the different processes in the job. Other 
scheduler software will also take this into consideration when executing 
the automated processes. There are many tasks that need to be run on the 
application and database side that need to support to validate execution 
and dependencies in the jobs.
The DBA transitioning to do automations has opportunities to script 
out processes, do database development, examine processes for migration 
to automation, and conduct testing with regular testing plans and QA.
Automating Test Plans
Database and software development require structured testing and 
QA. The database environments need to be refreshed to handle this too. 
As part of the database automation, the unit testing tools can be used and 
automated tests can be developed for the database testing. Application 
code is normally set up for the automation, but the database scripts of 
tables, data changes, etc., will work in the unit testing using something 
like SQLDeveloper. These tests can verify database objects and upgrade of 
objects.
Chapter 8  The Art of Automation

97
Figure 8-1.  Unit testing in SQLDeveloper
Having the test plans automated makes it easier to test database 
changes, upgrades, and other processes on the database. There are other 
tools to use besides SQLDeveloper and there is also Real Application 
Testing (RAT), and this captures workload with a way to regression test it. 
The unit testing is providing testing opportunities with Agile developers to 
test the code and database objects as part of an automation plan.
Figure 8-1 shows the place to get started with the SQLDeveloper tool 
for Unit testing.
Automation processes and unit testing make it possible for DBAs to 
transition to discovering, maintaining, and creating automated processes 
around these database jobs and testing procedures.
Chapter 8  The Art of Automation

98
Conclusion
With the Autonomous Database recently announced, the role of the DBA 
is definitely changing. Then it seems like more processes are automatically 
being configured. The database is able to deliver more automation on its 
own and provide configurations already implemented and even backups 
in place. The self-driving database is available in Oracle Cloud and it 
automates the management and performance tuning of the database.
The database automation of the Autonomous Database is based on 
machine learning and provides stability and performance because of the 
few human interactions of these needed tasks. From a security perspective, 
it also provides automated patching. This example is probably making you 
question why automation is another possibility for the DBA in transition, 
but it is the direction that processes have to go. The manual running of 
processes is definitely a thing of the past. Whatever can be automated 
should be, and if you can’t automation something can it be triggered by 
one that can.
The art is to understand the patterns and recognizing that procedures 
and tasks should be automated for the databases. A DBA transformation 
into this area is more coding and becoming a manager for the 
development processes and how to automate refreshes and unit testing 
for database components. The processes start specifically around the 
database and may then expand in scope as there are ways to look at how 
we work, and there are more possibilities to run code more efficiently and 
with less intervention.

CHAPTER 9
Change and Cloud 
Therapy
Database Administrators enjoy working with databases. They are 
challenging environments that, if supported properly, provide extreme 
value to the company. To be able to support many applications, different 
industries, and several departments within the enterprise exposes a DBA 
to many facets of the company. This is what gives a DBA satisfaction with 
their job. They understand the value they bring to many areas and are 
able to continue to contribute by providing a highly available and well-­
performing database.
Note  USA Today’s list of the “Ten Happiest Jobs in America” from 
spring 2015 stated that the Oracle DBA is sixth on the list for being 
the most happy.
Technology jobs are in demand but the skills tend to shift. This shift 
or disruption that we have been talking about is cloud. Of course there 
are others with big data with IOT devices and security. As discussed 
in previous chapters, with cloud services, there is significant growth in 
migrations to the cloud. There is also a need to understand data problems 
and protect the data.

100
We are not just DBAs! There is an incredible amount of knowledge 
gathered over the years from development, and from the business and 
other teams that you have worked with over the years. Being able to plan 
different projects for upgrades, data security, and migrations – just to 
name a few – demonstrate part of the soft skills developed over the years 
as well.
DBAs are used to change and the journey to the cloud or other DBAs’ 
transformation should be part of the job. Not having consistent days and 
plenty of work to do are the challenges that are enjoyed. So why is there 
resistance to change how we work? We are comfortable with changes in 
our normal environment, but it is time to look at the journey.
Job Satisfaction
Knowing that data is such a valuable part of the enterprise, being able to 
provide a service is the sense of job satisfaction. A successful day might be 
being able to answer questions, solve some troubleshooting problems, and 
knowing that you have been adding value to the company.
Think about what it is you enjoy about being a DBA.

I am sure you can think of plenty of other reasons or combination of 
reasons to find enjoyment in the job. It is important to find something that 
is interesting, fun, and enjoyable about the job. It might be the technology, 
people, or even the tasks.
Challenges are needed because it keeps us learning and growing. The 
experiences that we collect get us ready for the next challenge. We have 
already discussed the next challenges in previous chapters so now we just 
have to figure out where you fit in with that.
Just because things are changing is not a reason to be concerned. In 
the world of databases, things are always changing, and this time we have 
some pretty big technology disrupters that we are dealing with in the 
cloud, security, and what about autonomous databases.
The cloud is a satisfying place too. There are strategies for data to 
develop and be secure in cloud environments. These challenges and new 
environments should energize and excite a DBA for opportunities in a shift 
in job tasks.
Cloud Therapy
The cloud is everywhere. There are database, software, security, OS, and so 
many other services in the cloud. We need to look at these services as ways 
to enhance the environment; or if we are doing private cloud, what other 
cloud services we should be providing in our private clouds.
Chapter 9  Change and Cloud Therapy

102
The cloud environments tend to give us hesitation because of some 
unknowns. Remember back in Chapter 2 when we discussed the control 
factor: the DBAs need to be able to control pieces of the environment in 
order to make sure it is configured as needed. But the cloud has some 
unknowns and may not always appear to have the same support as if it 
was offered by you. However, the DBA can most definitely verify settings 
and configurations to make sure that they are meeting service-level 
agreements.
It is this understanding of what the environments should be provided 
that helps to verify and feel comfortable with the cloud system that we can 
work with. The databases are not changing but how we are supporting 
them is.
Concerns with migrating to the cloud have been covered in several 
of the previous chapters. According to the IOUG Database Cloud Survey, 
2016, the top five concerns are the following:
•	
Security and Privacy
•	
Data Ownership and Retention
•	
Software Licensing Issues
•	
Lack of Expertise or Knowledge
•	
Regulatory Compliance
These are areas for development with the DBA and as we have these 
topics clarified for our enterprise, they will support the changes in the 
environment. Data ownership seems to be issues that we even face now. 
This will continue to be important with data as a service and will need to 
be tagged for the business and application as the data owner.
As competition between the cloud providers continues, it is possible 
that licensing will be not be a concern. But there still needs to be expertise 
of the cloud environment along with questions and validations for 
compliance. The DBAs can address these concerns in the environment 
with what they know.
Chapter 9  Change and Cloud Therapy

103
If you think about the hardest part of on-premise deployments, the 
server and storage procurement takes time and may not be as elastic. IT 
resources need to be available for deploying and configuring servers.
Questions that need to be asked of cloud providers to ensure proper 
services are the following:
•	
What are the options and parameters that are used?
•	
How do they store sensitive data?
•	
Cloud types offered and how to migrate?
•	
What are the maintenance options?
•	
How do large data sets migrate or load into the cloud?
•	
What are the costs? Look at transactions or load. Is 
there on-demand usage?
This is a quick list and not all inclusive of questions to ask.
Even if we are thinking the cloud environment is not something the 
industry or company you work for might be using, there are reasons to 
migrate. There are development environments or other applications that 
would benefit from the use of the cloud. It is important to understand 
and advise which databases will perform well in the cloud. This is also 
the opportunity to embrace cloud environments and help direct the 
migrations of what type of clouds can be used.
From database as a service to cloud, it does change how we work 
or where we work, but it helps to direct and recommend the best 
environment. To be able to be part of the solution is going to make for 
an easier transition. Resisting that the cloud environment is coming or 
something to migrate to will just make it more difficult to stay involved 
with the new cloud.
Chapter 9  Change and Cloud Therapy

104
Change Management
Change by leading is what is going to allow for greater involvement 
in the future direction. It will embrace the differences in how work is 
accomplished or where it is performed. The enterprise is working to be 
more efficient and saving operational costs as these changes are put into 
place. Again we have options to embrace change or stay the same.
Change is not easy. We do get comfortable in our positions and tasks, 
and knowing what is expected. Even learning new features and making 
changes to new versions of the database is not as much of a change but 
is easier than how we have to work or changing what we do. This is also 
something that we enjoy about the job in the first place: that things change 
in the environment. Of course it does not always change our perspective 
or how we have to work, which is different now with this migration to the 
cloud. The different types of DBAs can examine their favorite pieces of 
the job and look to invest in additional learning to make that change and 
continue to add value to the company.
Leading Change, a book by John P. Kotter (Harvard Business Review 
Press, 2012), discusses the process of making these major changes.
•	
Changing a career or leading change in your company 
can follow these steps to be successful in dealing with 
the change and helping others, such as your team 
members, to make the change with you.
•	
Establishing a sense of urgency, and with the statistics 
about the movement to the cloud and technology 
direction, the time is now.
•	
Creating a group to work together with enough 
influence to lead the change.
•	
A vision and strategy needs to be developed so that the 
goal is recognized and understood.
Chapter 9  Change and Cloud Therapy

105
•	
Part of understanding is communicating the change 
vision, including modeling the behavior that is needed 
to embrace this change.
•	
Empowering broad-based action, and getting rid of the 
obstacles.
•	
Generate short-term wins, and this will make the 
change visible quicker than the long-term projects.
•	
Consolidate gains that produce more change. Effect 
changes increases the credibility to change all systems, 
structures, and policies.
•	
Anchor new approaches in the culture, which provides 
the connection to the new behaviors and successful 
changes.
The vision and strategy will have everyone on the same page and 
a common goal. It takes more than one DBA to move to the cloud and 
perform migrations. There should also be discussions around what each of 
the team members can do that will empower them and provide a sense of 
responsibility with a new environment and possibly a new role.
Change is needed to keep the company competitive. Change is needed 
as we look to keep current in our skills and be involved in technology. 
Embrace the disruption and enjoy the change and opportunities it brings. 
Encourage team members and look for those quick acceptance changes 
that will keep everything moving forward.
Work–Life Balance
Working as a technologist has definitely provided ways to work from 
anywhere and also have flexible hours. Because of all of the individual 
tasks that have to be completed and lack of automation, there have been 
Chapter 9  Change and Cloud Therapy

106
many days and nights that the DBA has spent on the phone and working 
with support issues. This is something that most of the DBAs should be 
celebrating as we look to migrate to service-oriented architecture and 
cloud. With changes in how to support the data and automation, there 
is a possibility for more time to enjoy life outside of the office instead of 
on support calls. The time and availability might even allow you to think 
about sharing your migration experiences with user communities and 
volunteer for a group like Independent Oracle User Group (IOUG).
Along with time to volunteer, the regular workday leaves us with 
time to work on the projects and research the areas we have for our 
environments. The automation of processes gives us the chance to do this 
and focus on business needs and not just individual task execution.
Of course work–life balance means different things to different people, 
but we still all need opportunities to recharge. It is easy to get exhausted 
if we are dealing with the same issues and need a change. This might be a 
good opportunity to look into ways to unplug, recharge, and enjoy reading 
your favorite technology book.
We tend to be passionate about what we do, and our jobs become our 
hobby. It does not help when we are looking at work–life balance. However, 
we do need to prioritize the work that we do and make sure that we have 
other opportunities to develop skills and continue to learn.
Skill Development
Recognizing that change and the cloud environment are going to be 
the current future direction, along with planning migrations, includes 
skill development. It probably is something already in the works. 
Understanding these new environments and what skills are of interest to 
you can be developed as part of the migration plan.
Chapter 9  Change and Cloud Therapy

107
Skill development comes from doing and through training. On of the 
best parts about the cloud environment is that it is available for testing 
and learning. Oracle Cloud even provides discounts to get into the 
environment, test, and start to verify configurations. The cloud is a perfect 
training ground as it is easy to set up and get running.
Test Environments
The cloud can be a test environment for looking at migrations or 
upgrades. These are the systems to build up skills and look at ways to help 
any projects move forward with testing. The operational expenses are 
reduced along with the cost of additional hardware when we are able to 
utilize the cloud.
Applications can also test upgrades and it can be a sandbox for new 
releases. How many times are new test environments requested and 
needing to be maintained? This can be one of the automated processes 
even for a development on-demand database. Oracle can even clone 
pluggable databases from on-premise databases.
Many frameworks are available in the cloud, so they can all be part 
of the testing to simulate workloads and test new features. These types of 
automated, on-demand test environments support the Agile development 
processes and provide environments for DBAs to test features that 
normally are difficult to test in other databases.
Life Learner
Wanting to develop new skills and being in the database, it is almost a 
given that you are a lifetime learner. This keeps skills up to date. The skills 
we learn are for the new technologies encountered as we see opportunities 
to enhance our environments.
Chapter 9  Change and Cloud Therapy

108
To be a life learner, it requires self-motivation, excitement, and passion 
about the technologies and areas of focus. However, sometimes we have 
to learn about areas maybe like cloud or a server service that might not be 
as interesting as our ultimate goals. As you are doing this, without learning 
about areas that you are not sure about, you end up learning even more 
and verify that your passion is in the right place.
Conclusion
The cloud and change require DBAs to consider the concerns and 
opportunities of these environments. It definitely is not an easy task to lead 
change and move from our comfort zone to new roles and tasks. Reviewing 
tasks that are enjoyed help to know what needs to be learned and provide 
us comfort that not everything is changing.

CHAPTER 10
Creating 
a Transformation Plan
We realize we have to make a change. The cloud environment and 
databases as a service is the next stage that is to be faced and planned on 
until the next disruption. With the skill sets that are gathered by DBAs, 
there are plenty of opportunities. With the databases in the cloud and 
Oracle Autonomous databases, there are processes that no long require 
a DBA, but the database understanding is important for the enterprise. 
DBAs need to transform into a couple of different roles to provide this 
expertise. We have a choice, and that is a great thing it means that you can 
choose a direction that fits with the areas you like to do. I did this a few 
years back in choosing security.
Security has always been an area that I have been interested in, and in 
working with different security products, I preferred setting up the security 
options and managing those. So it made sense when given the opportunity 
to go to the security team and handle the database security projects; it 
was a perfect fit. The fun part is I get to continue to learn new security 
skills, keep database knowledge, and work with several different teams for 
planning and implementing.

110
Tip  Decide on the skills that give you the most satisfaction in your 
job. There are going to be new opportunities in that area and new 
skills to learn too.
This is an opportunity to review the database environment, assess your 
skills, and put together a transformation plan.
Transformation
Throughout the chapters, we discussed the options for transformation. 
The work as a DBA develops many technical and soft skills. Now it is time 
to review this DBA Toolbelt and consider what the next steps are in this 
process. Figure 10-1 demonstrates that all of these endpoints start with the 
DBA skills and the evaluation that is now needed to get to the next stage.
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

111
The DMA, Cloud DBA, Security, Data Professional, and Automation 
Engineer are only five paths that you can take or a combination of these. 
There are other paths that are available; some might be less technical and 
more people oriented, for example, management roles to help prepare 
teams to manage the cloud. There might also be even more technical roles 
with development or systems. These three steps will gather the details that 
are needed for the transformation.
Figure 10-1.  Transformation from DBA skills
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

112
•	
Decide on the Future Direction
•	
Evaluate Tasks
•	
Acquire New Skills
The future direction is the endpoint of the arrows in Figure 10-1. It is 
also possible to work through this process with a different future direction 
that is not listed. Next evaluate the tasks for the roles and the skills that are 
your strengths, and plan for the new skills that are needed to fill in the gaps 
for the role.
Evaluation
Evaluation is looking at two areas. Evaluate what tasks are the most 
enjoyable and what would your day look like if you had a good workday. This 
is to understand from the previous list that has been discussed which areas 
are going to give you the most satisfaction from work and career choices.
This is a very brief description for each of the possible DBA roles, and 
the chapters on each can be used for more details as evaluating.
•	
Database Machine Admin (DMA) – System DBA like 
but needs to administer storage cells and OS
•	
Cloud DBA – Application DBA like, limited access 
to the server, additional monitoring responsibilities 
because of the cloud environment
•	
Database Security – Security tools, auditing, access 
controls, and work with security and data teams
•	
Data Professional – Big Data, Business Intelligence, 
data quality, and integrations
•	
Automation – Writing and developing automation 
processes, monitoring jobs
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

113
These new roles can enhance your career, which will still provide 
support for the company’s data assets. The disruptors are rapidly changing 
the environment that we have been working in and the evaluation will help 
sort out which role fits them best without having to fear the direction of the 
new environment. After evaluating which new roles are ideal for you, it is 
time to look at current and needed skills.
New Skills
Compare the DBA’s base skill set with the other roles’ additional learning 
and development for different roles. The database skills are the commodity 
that the company wants to keep when migrations happen to the cloud 
environments. The DBAs should view this as an opportunity for that very 
reason.
What happens when we don’t develop new skills? That is when we 
need to have fear about the changes that are coming to the databases. The 
work and effort that we do can be redirected to other areas very quickly, 
and a company is looking to reduce costs by consolidation of servers 
or utilize an elastic service for the databases with the cloud. They are 
looking to keep the experience and support the knowledge of the data, 
integrations, and the business intelligence.
Planning
Not all DBAs will have the same experiences. Others might have had 
more time working with high availability and others working with teams 
building communication and relationships. These are both the technical 
and soft skills that are needed, but one DBA might have gaps just because 
of the difference in the environment and company.
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

114
Figure 10-2 demonstrates a quick sheet for helping to gather that detail 
around the skills and understanding the gaps that would be the ones that 
still need to be learned. The circles represent a continuous process. Just 
as we are facing a shift in technology and the databases automation, there 
will be more coming in the future, and this is not the last time.
The gaps might even be for strengthening skills. DBAs have 
communication, leadership, and organizational skills, but there might 
need to be courses in leadership or reviewing process skills to enhance 
what is already there.
Database security is another good example for skills and a learning 
plan. Security is something that DBAs do every day with access controls. 
There are also audit tools in place to pull activities on the databases, but 
there could be a need for other activity monitoring tools or writing skills 
development for policies and security baselines. New skills would be a 
mark with just a “Learn” in Figure 10-2, but increasing knowledge in a skill 
will be both know and learn.
Figure 10-2.  Skill Learning Plan
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

115
Acquiring
We learned that the cloud environment provides a great sandbox for 
testing and exploring the cloud environment. Hands-On training is critical 
for the technical skill set that is needed.
Where else to acquire the desired skills? There are plenty of options, 
but let me suggest a few:
•	
User Communities – IOUG for Cloud, Data Services, 
Analytics and Integrations, DMA. There are also 
security communities for the security.
•	
Formal Training – This could be a week-long course 
that is focused on the skill.
•	
Conferences – Vendor conferences such as Oracle and 
Microsoft will have conferences on their cloud and 
other database skills.
•	
On the Job – Again this can use the cloud 
environments, understanding of the existing 
environment, and from coworkers.
Mentoring
Through the user group communities or work there is potential to learn 
from each other. Sharing ideas of how to architect or design a migration 
to the cloud could be extremely helpful: for example, having others either 
work through this transformation together or having the experience to 
partner up with those just getting started with the transition.
A person to discuss if they have seen something in the environment 
before like that or would plan A or plan B be better, and of course they are 
going to come back with plan C.
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

116
If anyone has mentored a Junior or New DBA, they realize the value 
in this. Much more is received from the relationship than what is put into 
it. It does take more than one person to make these environments work as 
designed.
This is important for leadership potential and develops 
communication and relationship building skills. Understand that it is 
important to be selective when it comes to mentoring. It can be through a 
full-out mentorship program or just a few people exchanging information 
to network and keep in touch as needed.
What Stays the Same
This might have been better in the last chapter, but there are a few things 
that comfort us when they stay the same. Not everything can change at once.
Data is data, and it will continue to grow. Because of this, data 
professionals should always be able to find careers. There are also careers 
in technology that will be available for those that continue to learn.
Figure 10-3 shows just a quick look at what is staying the same. There 
are going to be support and operational teams with production and test 
environments that we will be dealing with. It might also become an area 
for change further down in the future but for now this is staying the same.
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

117
Not Just a DBA
Hopefully after this discussion, this is a statement that is removed from 
your vocabulary. There are no longer just DBAs and at the minimum DBAs 
are also administering cloud databases. There are quite a few options and 
career path choices to make.
Figure 10-4 has the possible organizational structure of the “C” offices. 
This is to give you an idea of a career path and potential as well. The DBAs 
under CDO and CSO are more in the role of application DBA as the DBA 
might now be the role of supporting the application or even the cloud.
Figure 10-3.  Things that stay the same
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

118
There are a couple of different options to put in the Cloud DBA 
and Data Security, but this is a more typical model and just serves 
as a reminder of not only the technical roles and how it fits in the 
organizational model. There are possibilities for CIO, CDO, and CSO 
development, and why not, especially since the data is a very valuable 
commodity to the business. A person who can understand that, where 
it belongs in the organization, and use it for driving decisions is a strong 
force and valuable asset themselves in the company.
DBAs are adaptive and are constantly learning. The environments that 
they support can be on-premise, in the cloud, or both, but this will not 
matter as the DBA is now taking a look at what needs to be done for skills 
to manage their transformation just like they are planning migrations to 
the cloud or consolidations.
Figure 10-4.  Career paths
Chapter 10  Creating a Transformation Plan

119
Conclusion
The landscape of the databases has changed. The technology 
developments and having cloud computing and on-demand services 
is increasing the challenges of for the DBA. There needs to be a 
transformation of the DBA to reach new levels. They already possess 
valuable skills with database knowledge and business processes.
The key is leveraging the existing skills and meet this challenge 
head-on, increasing their knowledge in cloud and data processes. There 
is such growth potential with the on-demand service for the DBAs. In 
developing DBaaS, the DBA can provide the tools to run levels of security 
or other configurations to build it into the service. On-Demand and Cloud 
Computing allow the DBAs to work more with developers and applications 
teams.
The career growth as a DBA requires a shift, transition to adjust course, 
and leverage current skills with new ones. You can decide which path you 
would prefer to take and build out a plan to enhance and acquire new 
skills.
The job of the DBA is one that very rarely has the same day twice. The 
DBAs are evolving out of technology disruptors. It is an interesting time to 
be part of the data profession as the amount of data is enormous, and all of 
the sources coming will continue to make this a fast and growing system.
DBAs hold the opportunity to transform into an area they want to and 
are excited about. Remember, security is also an option too and especially 
plays into some of the natural skills. DBA transformation is going to 
happen with the movement of the database to cloud, automation, and on-­
demand services.
