EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM

EDITORIAL 
TEAM
M
erry Christmas!
We’re finally in December. You’ve made it through 2017, 
congratulations!
As we draw the year to a close, let’s recap on some of 
the important changes and interesting snippets throughout the year. 
It’s been a long year; we saw many product releases and shift in 
trends within the industry. This month’s cover story, we did a roundup 
on the latest tech and hottest releases that featured across the market. 
Flip to page 28 if you want a flash back of what happened in 2017.   
It’s Christmastime and that can mean two things: food and 
presents. It’s the time of gift-giving. To save you the hassle, we 
gave you a full 12 days of Christmas worth of goodies to show your 
appreciation, or just to reward yourself! Shop opens at page 33.
Our test labs are taking a little break this month – instead, our 
lab rats sat down to pick their top picks for 17 categories. Pitting the 
top choices head to head, we present to you the winners (ie. best 
products) of the year; featuring smartphones, motherboards, printers, 
cameras and more! The battle of the year begins at page 52. 
Gamer? Check out our game roundup of the year. We listed out 
top 10 games that our in-house gamers really enjoyed. If you want to 
know which ones were worth the money, page 106 breaks it down. 
It’s the end of the year, take it easy, play some games! Shoot 
out your frustration with Call of Duty: World War II at page 98, and 
build up more frustration with Cuphead on page 102. 
Finally, thank you very much for your continued support in 
2017. We’ll see you next year! 
From the team at Reach, Happy Holidays!

LETTER 
OF THE 
MONTH
You should try investing on a HP Sprocket 2-in-1, that is both a camera and a printer. And, it’s the size of a mobile 
phone so you can easily bring it on your adventures and holiday trips.
That really depends on what you plan to use it for. If you’re more into binge watching movies and TV shows, 
you can try test out a 3D TV and see if that works out. Alternatively, a curved-screen monitor should allow for 
immersive watching as well. However, they work best when it comes to gaming.

Should I invest in cryptocurrency?
Subject 
Cryptocurrency
Short answer: Yes, if you are brave enough to take risks. Long answer: Since cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value 
apart from what a buyer is willing to pay for it at a point in time, this gives way to huge price swings and increases 
risk of loss for the investor. So it you feel like you can’t handle that kind of volatility, it might be better to invest in 
something else that is better suited for you.

Ultimate Combo
Sony a7RIII Mirrorless is faster and has more resolution
S
ony 
is 
dominating 
the 
mirror-less camera with its 
Alpha series and is seeking 
to further grip the segment with 
its new 35mm full frame α7RIII 
model that's offering photographers 
who need a high resolution DSLR 
minus the weight and noise.
The a7RIII comes on board with 
42.4-megapixel with back-illuminated 
Exmor R CMOS image sensor that’s 
capable of shooting speeds at up to 
10 fps with full AF/AE tracking, that 
also takes 4K video. More and more, 
mirrorless cameras are matching high 
performance levels of conventional 
digital cameras with new zero noise 
level on a compact, lightweight body.
This new full-frame model was 
built without an optical low pass filter 
to maximise resolution, while also 
having the ability to output 14-bit RAW 
format even when shooting in silent 
or continuous mode.  The camera is 
equipped with an innovative 5-axis optical 
image stabilisation system that has been 
fine-tuned to support its high-resolution 
shooting capacity, resulting in a 5.5 step 
shutter speed advantage. There is also a 
new low-vibration shutter that reduces 
vibration and image blur in all modes, 
including the high speed 10 fps shooting, as 
well as several advancements in accurate 
colour reproductions of skin tones.
Also making its debut is a new 
Pixel 
Shift 
Multi 
Shooting 
mode, 
whereby the camera precisely shifts the 
sensor in 1-pixel increments to capture 
four 
separate 
pixel-shifted 
images 
containing a total of approximately 
169.6-megapixels of image data. 
These four images can be composited 
together and processed utilising the 
new “Imaging Edge” software suite. 
This ultimately results in a still image 
with overwhelming resolution and an 
unprecedented level of colour accuracy, and 
is ideal for photographing architecture, art 
or any other still life photography subject 
with many intricate details and colours.
The 
Sony 
α7R

Interchangeable Lens Camera will be 
available in Malaysia from 13 December

Hello Again, Moto
Moto G5S Plus enters Malaysian market
Seventh Heaven
The latest addition to vivo's ever-growing line-up of selfie smartphones
T
he latest in the G-series, the Moto 
G5S Plus is the first in the line-up 
to feature a 13-megapixels dual 
camera. It comes with a selective focus 
mode that allows the blurred background 
- aka bokeh - effect. The camera also 
comes with a black and white, as well as a 
background replace mode for more fun with 
the phone. The front sports an 8-megapixel 
wide angle front camera that comes with 
an LED flash and a panoramic mode as well.
The Moto G5S Plus features an 
all-metal unibody design, with a 5.5-inch 
full-HD display. Powered by a Qualcomm 
Snapdragon 2.0GHz octa-core processor 
the Moto G5S Plus comes with support for 
4G LTE as well. The Moto G5S is packed 
with a 3,000mAh battery and is included 
with a TurboPower charger, giving six hours 
battery life in 15 minutes.
The phone also sports a multi-function 
fingerprint reader which allows users to 
lock and unlock all of your contents. Moto 
Actions are included, and there are two 
new Moto Experiences, namely Night 
Display and Quick Reply.
The Moto G5S Plus is available in two 
colours: Lunar Gray and Blush Gold. Priced 
at RM999, customers can now purchase 
the new Moto G5S Plus from Motorola 
brand stores and authorised dealer outlets 
nationwide, or on Motorola’s official e-store 
on Lazada Malaysia. 
fter recently launching the vivo 
V7+, vivo is back once again with 
the V7. Much like the V7+, the V7 
comes with a 24-megapixel front-facing 
shooter alongside smart photography 
algorithms to give your selfies a difference. 
There are also many features for the selfie 
camera like Beauty 7.0 while Portrait Mode 
gives you the oh-so desired bokeh effect. 
At the rear sits a 16-megapixel camera.
The V7 also borrows a few elements 
from the V7+, featuring a FullView display. 
However, the V7 is slightly larger than its 
sibling with its 5.7-inch and 18:9 aspect 
ratio. This gives it an 83.6% screen-to-body 
ratio, which follows the trend of 
smartphones in 2017.
At its core, the V7 features a 64-bit 
Qualcomm Snapdragon octa-core CPU, 4GB 
RAM and 32GB of storage. It also comes 
with vivo's own FunTouch OS 3.2, based 
on the Android 7.1.2 Nougat. The V7 is 
officially available, priced at RM1,299.

Maybank App Gets an Update
It now comes with facial and voice recognition

Maxis works together with Etiqa 
M
M
aybank has updated its mobile 
app with two new biometric 
options to unlock your account. 
These two new updates are facial and 
voice recognition, which will join the ranks 
of the fingerprint sensor.
Known as Face ID and Voice ID, these 
two new security features can be used 
with virtually any smartphone. Of course, 
there are a few minimum requirements like 
having at least a 2-megapixel front-facing 
camera and a microphone. This allows users 
who are owners of a smartphone without a 
built-in fingerprint reader to have the same 
level of security features as everyone else.
Much like QuickTouch - the fingerprint 
authentication reader - users can now 
check their bank balance and other details 
with Face and Voice ID. Unfortunately, the 
update still doesn't allow you to approve 
transactions through these new features as 
you will still need to input your password. 
axis and Etiqa are working 
together to offer a superior 
usage-based insurance (UBI) 
programme for their customers. By 
leveraging on the strength of Maxis 
mDrive as a proven vehicle tracking 
solution and Etiqa’s wide-range of 
general insurance premium offerings, 
UBI will allow businesses to enjoy greater 
cost savings and business efficiency.
mDrive is an affordable tracking 
solution that optimises efficiency and 
productivity by monitoring a vehicle’s 
vital information, such as their location, 
mileage and engine health. It can also 
provide insight into the driver’s behaviour 
patterns when benchmarked against 
international standards for safe driving.
Along with the UBI programme, 
mDrive enable businesses to always 
be sure of where its vehicles are at 
any given time, keep track of timely 
deliveries 
and 
ensure 
customer 
satisfaction. Apart from that, it helps 
to encourage drivers to be more careful 
on the road by monitoring and analysing 
driver behaviour, which will also 
contribute with cost savings.

A1-size prints per minute for mono with 
a maximum print length of 10 and 15 
meters, respectively. It can also achieve 
scan speeds of 240 mm per second, 
complemented by its ability to parallel 
process tasks to accelerate workflow.
On this front, businesses can be rest 
assured that this wide format multifunction 
printer offers fast LED print speeds and 
parallel processing, delivering uninterrupted 
output that helps keep users productive.
Easy to Use
The Teriostar LP-1040MF offers the perfect 
balance when it comes to ease of use and 
performance. Boasting new features, OKI 
Data has made this wide format printer 
simple and intuitive to use. All controls 
can be managed through its 8.5-inch colour 
LCD touchscreen panel, which gives users 
accessibility to frequently used menus. 
The printer also comes with a complete 
PC-based software suite, which supports 
drag and drop file management, full 
file view capabilities, a sophisticated 
print queue along with multiple printer 
support. The integrated software solution, 
Teriostation2, enables networked users to 
send jobs, including multiple files, using 
the most common file formats such as 
TIFF, PDF and more. 
Additionally, exceptional print quality is 
assured with its new Print Data Converter. 
The new feature allows users to fix typical 
problems such as speckles, slants or the 
kind of errors sometimes seen with scan 
data or file converter data.

The Best of 2017
We take a look at some of the biggest evolutionary and 
innovative changes from the world of technology in 2017
by Teh Wi-Liam

COVER STORY
n a blink of an eye, it is now 
December. Christmas is approaching 
and soon after that, it’ll be New Years 
and we’ll be welcoming 2018 with 
open arms (to a certain extent.) As 2017 
is about to close, we're be looking back at 
the year and what it has done to the world 
of technology. Last year, we saw the rise 
of dual-camera smartphones. This year, it 
was all about the bezels.
Bring on the Bezel
For years now, science fiction novels 
and 
movies 
focusing 
on 
futuristic 
technologies have painted smartphones 
as rectangular-shaped devices without 
any borders or bezels. Some even adopt an 
all-glass approach, much like Black Mirror’s 
approach in its second season opener, “Be 
Right Back”, which debuted in 2013.
The idea of bezel-less displays  have 
been around the block for quite some time 
now. However, it’s one thing to put pen to 
paper and talk about it, and it’s another to 
develop and manufacture it.
However, 2017 saw a huge rise in 
technological advancement in terms of 
making what we see in movies come to 
life. It was in the month of February 2017, 
LG launched its then-current flagship, 
the LG G6 with a near bezel-less display 
aided with a thin forehead and chin. 
The 5.7-inch smartphone came with an 
unconventional at the time 18:9 aspect 
ratio, something many of us weren’t used 
to seeing, until now…
Come April 2017 and another Korean 
smartphone brand by the name of Samsung 
launches the latest addition to its Galaxy 
S series, the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Building 
on its already sturdy reputation at being 
an all-round great smartphone, Samsung 
took things to the next level with its 
latest additions. Its Galaxy S8 came with 
a 5.8-inch display while the Galaxy S8+ 
featured a 6.2-inch screen; both of which, 
came with an 18:5:9 aspect ratio.
What followed the rest of the year 
was every other brand and their cousins 
following suite, fitting bigger screens into 
smaller bodies at the cost of the bezel. 
This gave consumers what they wanted: 
a futuristic-looking smartphone in the 
present. Of course, we can’t talk about 
bezel-less displays without mentioning 
Apple, who’s iPhone X still turn heads 
with its all-glass body paired with an 
all-glass display screen.

Rise of the Robots
This has been a long time coming, but 2017 
has been the most significant year when 
it comes to advancements in robotics, 
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine 
learning capabilities. As always, the 
name on everyone’s lips when the topic of 
robotics comes about is Elon Musk. CEO of 
SpaceX, Tesla, Inc. and Neuralink as well 
as being a Co-chairman in OpenAI, Musk 
has always been at the forefront when it 
came to robotics. As most of us already 
know about SpaceX and its expeditions, 
one such news that has become a hot topic 
of late was Tesla, Inc. and one of its latest 
vehicles that isn’t consumer-friendly: the 
self-driving Tesla Semi truck. This is much 
like what Volvo Group is currently doing 
with its self-driving refuse trucks.
Musk’s involvement with OpenAI 
is also a noteworthy takeaway as it was 
unveiled during The International 7, the 
premier Dota 2 tournament that featured 
a prize pool of around US$24,000,000. 
How OpenAI came into play here was 
its involvement in one of the many 
crowd-pleasing segments of the five-day 
event. It featured several professional Dota 
2 players going up against the OpenAI bot 
in a one-versus-one game, to which the 
players lost spectacularly.
How this happened was the 
advancements OpenAI made with its 
robotics and AI, letting it adapt, study and 
learn from itself. In an interview done by 
Mashable, OpenAI Machine Learning 
Researcher, Rafal Jozefowicz talks about 
the self-learning capabilities that the 
OpenAI bot had to do, to become better 
than actual human beings.
That’s not all. Smartphones weren’t 
safe from AI and machine learning as 
Google’s keynote pointed out. During 
the release of its suite of products 
which includes the Google Pixel 2 and 
Pixel 2 XL smartphones, Google Home 
products and even earphones, Google 
was firing on all cylinders.
Both smartphones from Google came 
with very similar features, one of which 
was through the smartphones’ cameras, 
called Google Lens. Through this, you 
can snap a picture of anything and it will 
redirect you to all that you will need to 
know about your subject matter. It can be 
a landmark, a painting or even any random 
item like a bicycle or a vase. The Google 
smartphones can bring information to you 
with the help of machine learning.
Google’s 
other 
products 
like 
its Pixelbook came with advanced AI 
capabilities, putting the Google AI assistant 
right on its home screen to assist you in 
anything and everything. The Pixelbuds 
were 
another 
advancement, 
being 
able to translate languages on-the-fly, 
making 
conversations 
in 
different 
dialects easier than ever.
Of course, it wasn’t only Google who 
jumped on the AI and machine learning 
train for smartphones. Huawei and Apple 
were other big names to bring their 
flagships into the fold with the Huawei 
Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro as well as Apple 
with its iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X.

COVER STORY
Digital Personal 
Assistants
While we have seen the rise of digital 
personal assistants over the past few 
years, 2017 showed off its prowess with 
the likes of Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s 
Bixby, Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and 
of course, Google Assistant (who doesn’t 
have a female name because Google is 
gender neutral that way I’m guessing?)
These 
few 
digital 
personal 
assistants 
cover 
three 
ranges 
of 
technological advancements to help us 
in our daily lives. Advanced artificial 
intelligence (AI) to capture and interpret 
data, adopting the Internet of Things 
(IoT) to operate the space around us and 
using advanced augmented reality (AR) 
to project themselves into our world.
With these three aspects combined, 
it creates a single intelligent being that 
is created solely to provide information 
on anything and everything that we could 
ever want or need in a blink of an eye. 
From finding out traffic situations on your 
way home, to what song is playing in the 
background of a movie and even where 
to get that armchair for your house, 
digital personal assistants are the way 
forward for humanity.
Of course, with all the knowledge 
and information the robotics have 
gathered, it could lead to an apocalypse 
of sorts, much like the Terminator series. 
Surely, this sort of information should be 
taken with a pinch of salt, but if Musk 
could tweet about AI, saying “In a few 
years, that bot will move so fast you’ll 
need a strobe light to see it. Sweet 
dreams…” it looks like we’re all in for a 
rough ride once AI technology becomes 
too smart for its own good.

isual design is a key element in presenting your photographs. It is about 
how you implement your vision and arrange elements to work harmoniously 
within the frame. Here are some basic templates that may help you out.

USM/ FL: 22mm/ 
f/16.0, 1.0sec/ 
ISO 100/ WB: Auto
Before you start: explore first and assess the location
Check vantage points. Can you access the waterfalls? What are the elements present 
at the base of the waterfalls? Are there iconic landmarks around the waterfalls that you 
can include in the frame, such as a rainbow, mountains, hills, or grand scenes?
1. The Classic
If a waterfall can be approached near its base, find interesting elements such 
as rocks, leaves, tree branches, etc. Choose your foreground and make sure the 
shapes lead the viewer to the waterfalls. Never choose a foreground element that 
is horizontal in shape.
2. The Diagonals
The inclusion of dynamic lines, such as diagonals or curves, will be a sure hit in any 
visual design. Such lines lead the eye of the viewer to the waterfall. Diagonals can 
be found in almost anything from rocks to the shape of the shoreline of the river.
“The 
inclusion 
of dynamic 
lines, such 
as diagonals 
or curves, 
will be a 
sure hit in 
any visual 
design.”

3. Reflections
In any waterfall environment, you will usually find shallow pools of water 
forming around the area. Look for reflections in them and use this as your 
foreground element. Don’t forget to use a circular polarising filter (CPL filter) 
to enhance the reflection.
4. The Top View 
Certain types of waterfalls such as the punchbowl type can only be viewed 
from the top. Try to use the cliff as your leading lines. Remember that curves 
are also dynamic lines.
5. The intimate
You don’t always have to use wide-angle lens to photograph waterfalls. Certain 
types of waterfalls, such as those with multi-levels and steps, would be better shot 
with a telephoto lens to highlight details.
6. The inclusion of iconic elements 
If the waterfall is beside a mountain, 
include it in your composition too. Use 
the waterfall as the foreground element 
that leads towards the landmark.
I hope these tips will provide a 
jumpstart to photographing waterfalls. 
Research the nearest waterfalls in your 
area. In the Philippines, some waterfalls 
worth visiting are in Laguna, around two 
hours’ drive from Metro Manila. They 
include the Pagsanjan Falls, Kalayaan 
Twin Falls, Liliw Waterfalls and others. 
Happy shooting!

NOT THE EIGHTH 
WONDER
Apple celebrated its 10th year 
anniversary of its smartphone 
business with the launch of three 
new iPhones: the iPhone 8, 8 
Plus and of course the future 
of smartphone, the iPhone X. 
Having used Apple smartphones 
since its inception in 2007 with 
its revolutionary touch screen 
display and home button, there has 
been no turning back for me and 
the journey of the iPhone to its 
eighth-generation model has been 
laden with mostly hits until now.
CHERRY ON THE APPLE  
The saving grace is the new A11 Bionic 
processor, which matches up smoothly 
with the latest operating software: iOS 
11. Every function on the phone is running 
faster and smoother, with the coming 
together of these two main items. 
Benefiting from this is the 12-megapixel dual 
camera where Apple placed the two lenses 
horizontally and kept the bump encasing 
them. Although many would argue a flushed 
design would be better. Pictures were 
good, a big part of the team in Apple strive 
to improve image quality and the results 
produced by the wide angles f/1.8 and 
telephoto f/2.8 lens were spectacular. 
BIG AND BULKY 
Being big does not bode 
well for an iPhone, it wasn’t 
spectacular on the iPhone 7s 
Plus and neither it is on the 8 
Plus. On the aesthetics I will rate 
the phone passable making the 
iPhone 8 Plus a distant unwanted 
cousin of the iPhone X and a 
modified Proton of the iPhone 
8. Apple had 2 years to design 
the next generation iPhone and 
celebrate its 10 years as a trend 
setter and all Cupertino can 
conjure up was another layer 
for the rear. Come on Tim! 
Apple’s Middle 
Child Syndrome
Placing the iPhone 8 Plus 
right next to the 7 Plus, 
you can barely notice the 
difference, and it irked me 
to no end.
Once you turn the device 
around, you will find a new 
glass back with wireless 
charging capabilities alongside 
a dual camera, which you won’t 
see on the iPhone 8.

DESIGNED TO IMPRESS 
After a disastrous 2016 with the Galaxy Note 7, 
Samsung is looking to put the past behind them 
and have done so in spectacular fashion with the 
Galaxy Note8. Featuring an edge-to-edge display 
with state-of-the-art features, Samsung has 
encapsulated what a smartphone needs in 2017 and 
then some. With a price tag significantly higher 
than the Galaxy S8+, the Note8 has big shoes to 
fill and it does so very convincingly.
 
With the Infinity Display, you have a near 
bezel-less display screen with a very short 
forehead and chin. You can even customise your 
screen resolution settings between HD+, FHD+ 
or WQHD+. Its insanely large screen also makes 
app pairing a breeze, being able to squeeze two 
apps together perfectly while still giving enough 
attention to each of them. 
TWO TIMES THE 
FUN 
The first of the Note series 
to feature dual cameras at 
the rear, the Galaxy Note8 is 
one of the top contenders 
in its photo-taking skills. A 
feature that utilises both the 
telephoto and wide-angle 
lens to great effect is its 
Live Focus feature, which 
captures a close-up image 
of your subject as well as 
a wider shot for greater 
diversity. You can even 
adjust the background blur 
before and after the image is 
captured to suit your liking.
 ALMOST LIKE A 
REAL PEN
The S Pen is extremely 
accurate when it comes to 
writing and highly sensitive as 
well. Sadly, it’s a bit harder 
for left-handers to use as 
it requires different finger 
positioning to write effectively. 
You can also take notes 
without turning on the screen. 
Simply remove the S Pen and 
start jotting away. The S Pen 
can also magnify onto a specific 
part of an article or onto a 
point of interest on a map. It 
also makes translation easier 
instead of having to use your 
fingers to navigate.
Return to 
Glory
While great to look at from 
afar or in your hands, the 
glass back of the Galaxy 
Note8 is very easily prone to 
smudging so if that vexes you.
Even the speed of which 
the Galaxy Note8 recharges 
itself is quick and snappy. 
Sadly, you will have to 
purchase the wireless 
charger separately.
With its top-of-the-line features 
and components, the Samsung 
Galaxy Note8 is by far our 
favourite smartphone of 2017.

A BIT OF 
EVERYTHING   
The Huawei nova 2 Plus is just your 
everyday mid-range smartphone. 
Not necessarily a good or bad 
thing, the nova 2 Plus stands out 
by not standing out (if that makes 
any sense). With no outstanding 
features, that also implies that 
it wouldn’t cost an arm and a leg, 
which is what many consumers are 
looking at. 
A FORMIDABLE 
SHOOTER 
At RM1,999, you can’t expect 
greatness. For that price, the rear 
cameras are more than capable 
at keeping the Likes flowing in 
on your Instagram. Colours 
reproduction is adequate with 
sufficient lighting although the 
pictures captured were in the 
middle of the night. 
GREAT FOR 
EVERYONE 
Using the nova 2 Plus daily brought 
out a great experience overall. The 
Kirin 659 processor had a quick step 
to it without any sort of delay and 
lag, partially thanks to the 4GB of 
RAM. The EMUI 5.1 OS was modelled 
after Android Nougat 7.0 and 
contained very minimal bloatware, 
which was a nice touch. Multitasking 
between day-to-day social media

SPEEDY AND 
SNAPPY 
With the help of the mid-range 
Snapdragon 625 processor, 
the Z2 Play has a quick step 
to its game as it doesn’t get 
bogged down at all. Unlocking 
and locking the device takes 
less than a blink of an eye 
while swapping between apps is 
quick, to say the least.
FLUCTUATING CAMERA 
PERFORMANCE  
While a protruding camera is a turn-off to 
certain people, the design of the Z2 Play 
feels good in the palm of your hands. It 
comes with a 16-megapixel shooter on the 
back and 5-megapixels in the front. When trying 
to focus on close-up shots, the Z2 Play does 
brilliantly well; but in terms of a much wider 
audience, the autofocus is atrocious with being 
able to capture the correct target. 
MOTO MODS ARE A 
MUST
The Moto Mods are key when it 
comes to the Z2 Play. As a device on 
its own, the Z2 Play is pretty much 
your standard smartphone; but with 
Moto Mods, it can become so much 
more. Sadly, we didn’t receive any 
Moto Mods with the device so it’s 
hard to say for sure how great the 
Z2 Play is, but it has the potential.
Mod Your 
Moto
Aside from using the 
fingerprint to unlock the Z2 
Play, you can now lock the 
device as well by holding 
your designated finger down 
onto the reader.
While still a great device, the 
Z2 Play’s camera and battery 
life lack depth to take it on 
a home run. - Wi-Liam

BEAUTIFUL DESIGN 
Our first reaction to the 
Nokia 5 was how sleek the 
design was. Holding a 5-inch 
screen, it didn’t feel like a big 
phone. The body was smooth 
and while it didn’t feel heavy, 
it wasn’t flimsy either. The 
display is crisp with a clean, 
minimalistic user interface. This 
is one phone that will display 
every tiny detail in full clarity. 
DISAPPOINTING 
CAMERA  
One let-down of the phone is 
its camera. The operation was 
rather slow and shooting in low 
light was disappointingly subpar. 
Although it works well enough 
in bright conditions, it is a decent 
camera that gives clear pictures. 
However, use it in a darker setting 
or with quick action shots and it 
fails to impress. 
SMOOTH PERFORMANCE 
Although the processor in the Nokia 5 is an 
entry-level Snapdragon, you barely feel any 
lag in performance. The operations were 
smooth, which made swapping between apps or 
running a few parallel operations no big deal. 
Gaming and navigation were equally responsive 
without any hint of a blip in performance 
power. Precisely because the device uses an 
entry-level Snapdragon, the battery can last 
for a long while. Using up less processing 
power, the 3,000mAh can run comfortably for 
a couple days with heavy use.
Almost 
Premium
Instead of hybrid 
SIM trays, the Nokia 5 
comes with separate 
trays for dual SIM as 
well as microSD card.
The phone comes 
with Google Assistant 
pre-installed, making 
life much more 
convenient and fun.
There’s only one 
bottom-firing speaker.

GET MORE DONE 
While most phones last about a 
day, the Wiko Ufeel Fab comes with 
a 4,000mAh battery, which lasts 
comfortably for a day or more. 
For daily usage of navigation, 
browsing internet, emails, texts and 
calls, it will carry on for a day or 
more without needing to top up. 
REACTIVE PERFORMANCE 
While the benchmark scores don’t show 
it, the phone is pretty reactive to general 
operations on the phone. Swapping 
between apps, checking emails, browsing 
social media – it works perfectly with 
negligible lag. However, for any graphics 
heavy applications, it does tend to load 
rather slowly. Plus point: as far as I was 
emulating a heavy usage, it doesn’t freeze 
up; it just slows down significantly.

CLEAR PICTURES  
Although there are many 
phones with much higher specs 
for camera, the 13-megapixels 
that this phone carries does 
a pretty good job for giving 
clear photos. The front

EASY SETUP MADE 
FOR THE OFFICE 
Setting this up is fairly simple: plug 
it in to your local network, follow 
the steps on the printer and your 
device, and you're ready to go. The 
command panel's UI is simple and 
straightforward, with no fancy 
buttons. The scans pick up very clear 
details. That said, if your paper is 
a bit thin, contents from the back 
page will bleed through in the scan. 
Photocopying is very clear as well; 
the resolution is very high, especially 
for documents and words. The original 
and copies are nearly indistinguishable. 
Overall, for general office usage it 
serves the purpose very well. 
NOT MADE FOR 
PICTURES 
This printer allows you to print 
up to A3, with pretty fast and 
smooth print speeds. In terms 
of printing documents, the 
resolution is very high. Something 
to note, printing documents from 
the phone could sometimes lead 
to low resolution printing, if the 
file didn't download properly on 
the phone. Photos and pictures 
on the other hand, isn't this 
printer's strong suit. Colour 
banding seems to be an issue for 
pictures as well, with magenta 
or yellow bands appearing on 
pictures printed.
MADE FOR THE MOBILE 
WORKER
The printer has a dedicated email when 
connected to the network/internet. 
Users can just send an email with the 
attachment you want to print and voila! 
Out comes the report in hard copy 
without you even touching the PC. You 
can even send it remotely and print it 
only when you enter the code when 
you're nearby. The printer also allows 
you to scan pages to email. There's no 
additional setup needed - just use your 
email account!  For those who wants 
more convenience and functionality, HP 
has an app called HP Smart (Print Remote) 
that makes it even easier to print, scan 
and configure the printer settings.

FOR THE MODERN 
BUSINESS 
No longer are businesses confined 
to using big, bulky multifunction 
printers in an office setting. As 
print technologies advance, these 
printing workhorses are getting 
smaller in footprint. Designed for 
the modern business, the Canon 
imageCLASS MF633Cdw is ideal for a 
small- to medium-sized businesses. 
VERSATILE FOR ANY 
OCCASION 
Being a coloured laser printer, the 
MF633Cdw produces vivid coloured 
printouts that does not bleed or 
smudge. Having used this printer for 
both black and white, as well as 
coloured documents, the MF633Cdw 
certainly shines for the latter. 
It would be perfect to print out 
presentations or A4 posters. 
BOXY AND COMPACT
The MF633Cdw is comparatively small 
and boxy in design however, it is just as 
capable as those conventional office 
printing behemoths. While there is a 
150-sheet maximum in its cassette, there 
is an optional cassette tray available if 
you need the capacity. Smaller outfits, 
one that doesn’t need a high print 
monthly print volume, will appreciate 
the formfactor, which doesn’t take 
much space. 
All the 
Colours!
Users can easily access 
the control panel 
through its generous 
5-inch coloured LCD 
touchscreen panel. It’s 
user-friendly and easy to 
navigate. 
If you’re not printing a 
full-colour or graphic-heavy 
document, the MF633Cdw is 
nimble in churning out text 
document printouts that are 
crisp and bold. 
An all-in-one printer that 
shines in colour. - Atifi

CURVY IN ALL THE RIGHT 
PLACES   
The Acer Predator X34 is an insanely 
gorgeous curved gaming monitor. As I’ve 
always said, I have a thing for curves 
(explains my current girlfriend). 34-inches 
wide, the Predator X34 comes with a 
borderless design, allowing you to get 
the most out of it. If only we had a 
few more and we could’ve daisy-chained 
a couple of X34’s together to get a 
level of immersion like never before. 
It’s ultra-wide QHD display screen comes 
with a cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio, making it 
the perfect gaming monitor for RPG and 
action-adventure games which are heavily 
reliant on its graphics.
VIEW EVERYTHING IN 
COLOURFUL DETAIL  
You are given three separate 
GameView profiles for which you 
can customise the screen colour 
quality any way you like. This 
allows you to keep the profiles 
for specific games that require 
precise colour adjustments. 
This is also because of the 
advanced IPS panel located in the 
Predator X34, giving the colours 
a vivid outlook. This is one gaming 
monitor you must get your hands 
on if you have the money for it; 
it looks like a dream and works 
even better.
LAG WILL NEVER BE 
AN ISSUE  
Provided you’re using the latest 
GeForce GTX GPU’s, you would never 
have a problem with screen tearing 
or stuttering ever again as the 
Predator X34 comes with NVIDIA 
G-Sync Technology. By syncing 
frames rendered by your GPU to the 
refresh rate on the monitor (which 
can be overclocked to a maximum 
of 100Hz), the Predator X34 makes 
every game look like a real beauty 
to behold. It made GTA V look like a 
dream while Horizon Zero Dawn was 
exceptionally amazing to watch.

AN EAGLE’S EYE 
VIEW  
LG has always been known for 
its displays, from monitors to 
TVs. Thanks to its IPS panel 
technology, The LG 34-inch 144Hz 
IPS 21:9 UltraWide Gaming Monitor 
(34UC79G-B) delivers true-to-life 
colours with amazing contrast 
and detail. Despite being an 
ultrawide monitor, the picture 
quality remained consistently 
sharp at any angle. 
NOT FOR ALL 
Do bear in mind that not all games 
and machines natively support the 
21:9 resolution, such as the Sony 
PlayStation 4 Pro.  So you may 
have to deal with the pillar boxes 
on both sides. The 34UC79G-B also 
supports 144HZ refresh rate – 
games run smoothly without taking 
much GPU power. That said, if you’re 
running an AMD GPU, you’ll stand to 
benefit more from the monitor’s 
AMD FreeSync feature. 
EASY ACCESS 
This particular gaming display does 
not swivel like many in the market, 
but it does give users the ability to 
adjust the vertical height and tilt 
angle. The one thing I appreciate 
about the 34UC79G-B is the fact that 
all the ports are easily accessible 
on the back panel. A number of gaming 
monitors I’ve tested had them facing 
downwards at an awkward angle. The 
34UC79G-B eliminated the need for you 
to tilt your head awkwardly to find 
where the ports are located. 
Curvaceous 
Display
The monitor is quite sturdy 
and stable, despite its size 
and curved display. Chances 
of it falling over is low, 
thanks to its heavy base. 
It does not come with 
a built-in speaker, which 
is a shame. That said, the 
port layout would be 
different if it did.

SPEED IS OF THE 
ESSENCE  
In most cases, gaming keyboards 
from Cooler Master would always 
carry either the Blue, Red or Brown 
Cherry MX switches. As far as we 
know, Ducky is the only other gaming 
keyboard manufacturer that supplies 
its keyboards with Cherry MX Speed 
Silver switches. The MasterKeys L 
sure lives up to its name as the travel 
time for each key is extremely quick 
with an actuation point of only 1.2mm, 
making gaming and typing a joy. 
LONG-LASTING 
KEYCAPS 
While there are plenty of gaming 
keyboards that are using the 
standard ABT keycaps, the MasterKeys 
L is using the highly sturdy PBT 
keycaps. This gived it a tougher and 
sturdier feel when typing as PBT caps 
are thicker and highly sustainable by 
nature. This also gives your typing an 
audible click while keeping the crisp 
tactile experience intact.
NO LEDS?!  
Unlike every other gaming keyboard, 
the MasterKeys L doesn’t come with 
any RGB LED lighting on its keycaps. 
This of course, shouldn’t be mixed 
up with the MasterKeys Pro series; 
back to the matter at hand. It’s 
a breath of fresh air to have a 
gaming keyboard without any glaring 
LEDs although it does make me 
somewhat miss the customisation 
process. Goodbye raindrop and 
ripple, you will be sorely missed.

MINIMALISTIC 
MEETS SUBTLETY  
Unlike the BlackWidow series, 
the Ornata Chroma is a lot 
more down to earth with 
its outlook. One of Razer’s 
lighter gaming keyboards, the 
Ornata Chroma still maintains 
its sturdiness, being able to 
last much longer than the 
average gaming keyboard. There 
is also a series of ridges going 
through the left and ride side 
of the keyboard, making sure 
the cables are secured safely 
and not caught under.
MADE FOR GAMERS 
No truer words have been spoken, 
especially in Razer’s case. Backed 
up with Razer’s cloud-based driver 
software, Razer Synapse, you now 
have complete control of your 
entire Razer ecosystem. One mode 
in particular for Razer’s gaming 
keyboards through the Razer 
Synapse is its Gaming Mode. When 
turned on, it can disable the Windows 
key as well as the ALT+F4 combination 
and even the ALT+TAB combination. 
Razer Synapse also comes with a 
Stats section that shows your 
keystrokes and heatmap usage among 
your Razer ecosystem and games.
THE BEST OF BOTH 
WORLDS 
Some keyboard users prefer the audible 
click of mechanical switches while 
others would have the soft and quiet 
touch of membrane keys. The Ornata 
Chroma combines both of its qualities, 
giving you that oh-so satisfying clickity-
clack with its soft and light touches. 
This makes typing even more enjoyable, 
and you won’t be a pest to the people 
around you. Gamers would also benefit 
as the keys are evenly spread out to 
avoid miss clicks. If that does happen, the 
Ornata Chroma comes with anti-ghosting 
up to 10 keys so you need not worry.
Lighting Up 
Your Life
The faux leather 
on the wrist rest 
is surprisingly 
comfortable, making 
gaming easier.
the Ornata Chroma is bathed 
in Razer’s proprietary 
Chroma customisable colour

MID-RANGE MONSTER  
Previously known only as the 
Lenovo Y Series, Lenovo has since 
rebranded its gaming division by 
renaming it to be known as the 
Lenovo Legion Y Series. Up steps 
the Y720, featuring a Kaby Lake 
processor with NVIDIA GTX 1060 
graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hard 
drive. Although it doesn’t seem like 
much, Lenovo Legion Y Series keeps 
its Y720 strictly mid-range with 
above average specs and a modest 
price tag.
ANOTHER VR-READY 
GAMING MACHINE  
For fans of virtual reality (VR) games, 
the Lenovo Legion Y720 comes with 
the bare minimum requirements to run 
all your favourite VR games. With the 
help of having more at least two USB 
3.0 ports, a HDMI port and the GTX 
1060 GPU to boot, the Lenovo Legion 
can keep you entertained for hours. 
However, you would need to invest 
more into owning a VR set, which 
could set you back quite a bit.
LENOVO NERVE SENSE  
Coupled with the Lenovo Legion 
Y720 is the Lenovo Nerve Sense, your 
one-stop destination to keeping tabs 
on the laptop. From there, you get 
to choose between four keyboard 
colour profiles in Light Shift; keeping 
the laptop performance up and 
its temperatures down via Extreme 
Cooling (which gets insanely loud

which detects when a game is being run

STUCK IN A 
CONVENTIONAL SPACE 
Very rarely do you see a gaming laptop 
stand out from the crowd with its 
design alone. Sadly, the Acer Predator 
Helios 300 falls within the conventional 
crowd but in no way, is that a bad thing 
per se. Aside from its aluminium and plastic 
blend, the Predator Helios 300 is pretty 
much a sub-standard gaming laptop with 
no discernible way of standing out. Its 
keyboard is rather springy, soft and not 
overly clicky, which is great for people 
who can’t stand it. However, the layout of 
the keyboard strays away from regular 
external keyboards. If you’re used to 
laptop keyboard layouts, then you should 
feel right at home. The power button is 
located on the top right corner of the 
keyboard instead of being on the chassis, 
which is a nice change of pace.
PEAKED 
PERFORMANCE 
RATINGS 
Strictly a mid-range gaming laptop, 
the Predator Helios 300 runs on 
a 7th generation Intel Core i7 
processor paired with a GeForce GTX 
1060 GPU with dedicated 6GB VRAM. While 
it runs Dota 2 (90-100 fps, depending 
on in-game situations) and Overwatch 
(100+ fps) just fine, it did stutter 
in PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds 
(PUBG). With that said, it could be 
due to PUBG’s erratic performance, 
no matter what sort of system is 
running it. For a few games, everything 
would be running smoothly without 
any lag or delay. In the next few 
games, it would suddenly take longer 
than usual in the loading screen, which 
will then result in either me dying or 
running around aimlessly as none of 
the buildings would render.
AERODYNAMICALLY 
DESIGNED
Located at the rear of the 
laptop is Acer Predator’s 
proprietary AeroBlade 3D 
cooling fans. It promises to 
keep the airflow within the 
hardware cool and clean and 
can be controlled through the 
pre-installed PredatorSense 
app. When the CoolBoost 
feature is turned on through 
the app, it will increase the 
maximum fan speed during heavier 
usage. As the dual-fan cooling 
system is located beneath the 
CPU and GPU, you can control the 
fans through PredatorSense. 
Leaving it at auto will set the 
rhythm between 2,400 to 2,600 
RPM on Auto while Max fires on 
all cylinders, topping out at 
5,660 RPM. 
it tends to get 
pretty loud.
Subtle and 
Discreet
the 15.6-inch FHD display screen 
isn’t as bright as I would have 
liked it to be, it still holds 
its own when gaming or when 
streaming videos.
One thing I hate that plenty 
of gaming laptop brands do is 
place the headphone jack on its 
right side. Depending on which 
headphone you’re using, some 
wires are longer than others, 
which will inevitably cross paths 
with your mouse.
A consistent and reliable 
gaming laptop with 
above average specs and

EASY ON THE 
EYES  
Although not as sleek nor as 
sexy as the HP Spectre 13, the 
Spectre x360 is still in its own 
class of style, class and sex 
appeal. The gold accents around 
the edges of the laptop give it 
a very subtle yet appealing look, 
turning heads wherever you go. 
The black aluminium finish is clean 
and crisp as the Spectre x260 
means business and wants to be 
taken seriously.
FLEXIBILITY IS KEY  
Much like the Lenovo Yoga tablet, the 
Spectre x360 comes with 360-degree 
hinges – hence, the name – which 
allows you to flip the monitor on its 
back to use it in Tablet mode. You can 
also flip it backwards into Tent mode 
or just keep it at its generic Laptop 
mode for work, but our favourite 
would be Media mode. Flip the display 
180-degrees to the back and you can 
still continue doing work but without 
overworking the cooling fan at the 
bottom.
RUNNING THE LATEST 
HARDWARE  
What makes the Spectre x360 great 
is the hardware put into it. Running on 
the 7th Gen. Intel-Core i7 processor, 
the Spectre x360 was great for daily 
usage, whether it was for work or 
play. Although we don’t recommend 
playing games on it, it’s exceptionally 
great for movies and music. The 8GB of 
RAM also makes it run a lot smoother 
while the 256GB of PCIe M.2 SSD makes 
starting up the laptop as well as its 
programs a lot faster.
Flipping Its Way 
to the Top
The trackpad is extra 
wide and is made of glass, 
making it that easier and 
swifter to use.
Weighing at only 1.2kg, 
the Spectre x360 will 
feel great in your 
hands or even in your 
backpack as you will 
barely notice it’s there. 
To make movies and music 
sound even better, the 
speakers on the Spectre 
x360 are tuned by none 
other than the people over 
at Bang & Olufsen to give a 
rich and detailed sound.

HOW EVER YOU 
WANT IT
If you need a machine that can 
do just about anything in a fairly 
compact machine – do check out 
the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1. Not only it 
is a svelte piece of engineering 
marvel, it also has enough power 
to do what you want. Plus, it can 
switch around to different modes 
– a laptop mode, tablet mode, tent 
mode and a stand mode.
USB TYPE-C IS THE 
FUTURE 
Even though it is slim, it has enough 
space for a few connecting ports. 
You get two USB Type-C – one on 
each side – that also works for 
charging and external display through 
Thunderbolt. A microSD slot is there 
for any external data, and a combo 
headphone/microphone jack completes 
the package. Oh, Dell also included 
the required dongles to turn the USB 
Type-C to both normal USB and HDMI.
A 13-INCH IN A 12-INCH 
BODY
Not only is the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 small, 
it is compact. Dell has managed to 
make magic happen and fit a 13-inch 
display in a 12-inch laptop body. It has 
an expansive edge-to-edge display 
that is also a 2K display, making it able 
to show more for less real-estate 
space. Plus, the laptop has a fan less 
design so that it is quiet in operation. 
Flip it However 
You Want
The screen is a full 
touch-screen, and 
Microsoft Ink is fully 
supported.
It heats up quite a bit 
(understatement). Unless 
you’re experiencing winter, 
we wouldn’t recommend 
putting it on your lap.

DOUBLE THE LENS, 
DOUBLE THE FUN! 
Heavily promoted for its selfie taking 
capabilities, the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro 
comes with a 24-megapixel DuoPixel 
Front Camera at F1.8 with SuperPixel 
Tech. All that tech babble means you 
get some really good quality shots, 
especially when using the front 
camera. It even shoots video in 4K! The 
120-degree wide-angle camera allows 
you to fit more people or scenery 
when taking photos with the front 
camera. Not forgetting ASUS’ famed 
beauty mode, giving you blemish-free 
photos ready for the ‘gram. 
NOT JUST THE 
FRONT  
Sure, the selfie camera gets a lot 
of attention – it is in its name after 
all! The rear camera isn’t shabby 
either. Similarly fitted with a Sony 
image sensor with ASUS SuperPixel 
Engine, the rear camera is a powerful 
16-megapixels and performs just as 
well under low-light conditions. 
While the front camera’s quality 
might suffer slightly when using the 
wide-angle lens, the performance 
of the rear camera is consistently 
solid, giving clear photos even in 
low light settings.  
LOW LIGHT, NO 
PROBLEMO  
The camera features a flagship Sony 
IMX362 image sensor with a large 
1/2.55” size format and 1.4µm pixel 
size. Sony has been well known 
for its superb quality of camera 
sensors, providing excellent 
pictures even in low-light. On the 
ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro, it lives up to 
that legacy, taking detailed photos, 
even at night with limited lighting.  
While adjusting the brightness can 
be a bit fiddly, for a smartphone 
camera the UI is intuitive, and the 
quality is pretty good too.
Wait, Lemme 
Take a Selfie
Unlike many other of its 
competitors, the dual 
camera isn’t reserved 
for the rear camera, but 
rather the front!
The phone is designed 
to be slim and classy. 
Although sporting a 5.5-inch 
screen, it’s lightweight and 
comfortable to hold.

SELFIE EVERYTHING! 
The vivo V7+’s standout feature 
comes in its front camera. Sporting 
a 24-megapixels front camera, it 
takes sharp, clear photos. Besides 
that, an interesting feature is the 
ability to do group selfies by using 
a feature similar to panorama shots 
found on most smartphones on 
the rear cameras. You pan (not quite 
180-degrees, but gives a wide angle) 
and have everyone in shot! Just stay 
still or you will end up with ghost 
images we see on memes of panoramic 
shot fails. The rear 16-megapixels isn't 
shabby either - the resulting photos 
are clear, bright with vibrant colours.
RELEARNING NAVIGATION 
This phone doesn't come with buttons. 
While you can turn the virtual navigation 
buttons on and off, without the 
virtual navigation, I'm not very used 
to operating the phone. A bit like 
the iPhone where you can swipe the 
centre from the bottom to return 
home, you can swipe left and right 
for toolbars or the back button 
(position customisable). Swiping up for 
the toolbar gives you an Apple like 
easy access bar with WiFi, Bluetooth, 
torch lights etc. This phone took a bit 
of getting used to, considering I'm an 
Android user who is used to the more 
conventional layouts and buttons.
EVERYTHING IN 
FULLVIEW
With very thin bezels at 2.15mm, 
the phone's display area is 
very close to the edge, not 
too much dissimilar to Apple 
X's edge display. This allowed 
vivo to fit in an 18:9 ratio giving 
a 5.99-inch screen. This makes 
viewing videos and playing games 
much more immersive. Although 
compared to other phones, it 
slides on the wider side, so it 
feels just a teeny bit big on my 
hands, the design of the phone 
is pretty slim, making it quite 
comfortable to hold.

FUTURISTICALLY 
DESIGNED 
While most smartbands in the 
market do have a futuristic 
look, Samsung takes it one step 
further with the Gear Fit2 Pro. 
The Fit2 Pro comes in a sleek 
black-and-red colourway, a 
popular choice especially for 
sneakerheads (fun fact!). The 
plastic rubber is comfortable and 
doesn’t eat into your skin even 
after sweating. A great trade-off 
would be using a watch strap now 
instead of the usual latch strap. 
This makes it easier to adjust 
your fit while giving it a cleaner 
and subtler look.
A DEPENDABLE ALL-
ROUNDER 
When connected to your smartphone, 
you will be able to do a lot with the 
Fit2 Pro. You can send and receive 
messages, pick up or deny calls and 
you can even control your Spotify 
playlist through it. As the Fit2 Pro 
does come with Bluetooth and 
Wi-Fi, you can also stream Spotify 
wirelessly through any Bluetooth 
device. One hiccup that occurred was 
during the setting up phase as the 
screen isn’t as sensitive as you would 
think. I had to press the same button 
more than three times before it 
registers. After all that, using the 
Fit2 Pro as a daily device is great.
AM I FIT ENOUGH? 
I hate exercise, I’m just putting it 
out there. The only reason I play 
sports and go to the gym is, so I 
can look good when I take my shirt 
off. As a fitness tracker, the Fit2Pro 
does a great job in being able to 
recognise what sort of workouts 
I’m doing without having me to key it 
in. It can even go for a swim with you 
thanks to the Water Lock feature. 
The Fit2 Pro can withstand up to 50 
metres while still recording your 
heart rate and other health stats. 
Whether it’s lifting weights or 
jogging, the Fit2 Pro can detect. It 
will also provide encouraging words 
for you to keep pushing.
Fit for Work 
and Play
There are two buttons 
on its side that acts as 
the “menu” and “back” 
button while the screen 
is a curved AMOLED 
touchscreen display. 
On its back, there’s a 
heart rate sensor as 
well as pins that allows 
it to magnetically dock 
onto the charger.

SUSTAINABLE 
ARM CANDY  
One of the main concerns with 
smartwatches is the battery 
life, but the Huawei Watch 2 
takes it to a totally different 
level. With LTE turned off, the 
Watch 2 can last to at least 
two days without needing a 
charge. By turning off all 
smartwatch features, the 
Watch 2 will become a regular 
watch and will last at least 14 
to 18 days, on average.
FITNESS AND FASHION 
COLLIDE  
Not only does the Watch 2 look decently 
fashionable with any outfit, it even comes 
with decent fitness features to keep 
track of your vitals. The heart rate 
sensor is noticeably faster than its 
predecessor and its readings were on 
par with the health tracker on other 
smartwatches. The lower button on the 
Watch 2 activates the built-in Activity app, 
which tracks a variety of exercises from 
biking to running. Sadly though, the Watch 
2 is only splash-proof at best.
GIVING EVERYTHING 
YOU NEED 
With the help of the Android Wear 
2.0 OS, the Watch 2 is capable of 
highlighting some of the best 
features of the OS like its direct 
download of apps and even being 
optimised for low-power consumption. 
A nifty feature of the Watch 2 is 
the ability to customise its face to 
match the outlook. There is also a 
built-in LTE, which allows the Watch 
2 to function as a standalone device 
without being tethered.

DESIGNED FOR 
GREATNESS 
Netgear have outdone themselves 
with the Nighthawk X10 router. 
Although it encompasses a larger 
triangular footprint than most, 
The X10 ensures that space 
wouldn’t be an issue as its dark 
and ever-present outlook is 
more than enough to keep you 
happy. It also comes with four 
angulated antennas and the first 
router I’ve seen with its own 
cooling fan. This is when you 
know that Netgear means business.
EASY AND 
SPEEDY WIRELESS 
TRANSFERS 
With the help of 11ad and easy 
cloud access, the X10 helps you in 
transferring data and files over Wi-Fi 
easy and speedy. After transferring 
over 500GB worth of movies from 
my external hard drive to another 
device, it completed in under a 
couple of minutes. This is ideal for 
technophiles who are consistently 
upgrading their gadgets at home and 
are looking for a router with insane 
wireless transfer speeds. 
WHAT LAG? 
Located at the back of the X10 is 
seven Gigabit ports, which consist 
of six LAN ports and one WAN 
port. What makes the X10 great is 
its ‘Aggregate Mode’ located on 
the first and second port. This 
allows you to combine throughput 
for double speed, making your 
4K streaming, gaming and even 
downloads faster than ever. Even 
the technology found in the X10 
is audacious; it comes with Wi-Fi 
802.11ac and 11ad, which gave me over 
4Gb/ps download speed!
Keeping You 
Up All Night
Thanks to the Netgear Up 
app that can downloaded 
through Google Play Store 
and Apple App Store, you 
can now setup the X10 easily 
through your smartphone.
The X10 can be connected 
to multiple devices and 
with the help of Netgear’s 
very own Plex, you can now 
keep all your media content 
organised.
With a 1.7GHz quad-core 
processor and 
quad-stream architecture, 
you can easily get up

NEVER GONNA LET 
YOU DOWN  
Though it bears resemblance to the 
RT-AC5300, that is where it ends. ASUS 
ROG has hardware pushed to the very 
limits of present day technology. 
It contains the latest chipset from 
Broadcom with support for MU-MIMO 
from three separate bands that will 
deliver up to 5,334Mbps combined. The 
CPU and RAM are an insane combination 
of a quad-core 1.8GHz processor with 
1GB of RAM. This ensures it will never 
be bogged down with all the data 
coming through from the computers 
and from the internet.
LOREM IPSUM 
DOLOR SIT AMET 
The software used to 
control the Rapture is 
one of the most complete 
systems to be placed in a 
router. From the way the Lan 
port is configured to the 
type of utilisation for the 
USB ports, you have a hand 
in everything. Rog has even 
added GPN to the Rapture by 
way of WTFast, which minimises 
lag while obtaining a quick 
and stable connection for a 
specific game. 
PORTS GALORE 
FROM ROG 
One weakness of the RT-AC5300 
was its inclusion of only four LAN 
ports. The Rapture has remedied 
this by giving a total of eight LAN 
ports and one gigabit WAN. In true 
ROG style, it also included port 
aggregation on a pair of LAN ports. 
This allows for data over two LAN 
ports to be combined, a feature 
normally found on NAS storage. 
Dual USB 3.0 ports are on the 
back and can support a host of 
connections with hard disk drives 
as well as a 4G modem for backup.
Gaming Router 
Overlord
Striking design with the 
ROG logo planted right 
in the middle. Plenty of 
ventilation to ensure 
that heat leaves the 
router quickly.
The ROG is a big heavy 
router with eight 
massive antennas 
surrounding its base. 
Optional antennas could 
be an upgrade later.
A router overkill that does 
everything beyond great. It 
will cost you, but you won’t 
be disappointed. - Leonard

TRUE TO LIFE AUDIO 
TECHNOLOGY 
Ever since professing my love for the 
Philips Fidelio X2 a couple of issues 
back, I had the opportunity to test 
out the Philips Fidelio B8 Soundbar, 
and it was glorious. Paired with the 
Dolby Atmos system, it gave the B8 a 
truly breath-taking audio experience 
like no other. It made going to the 
cinema to catch a movie a thing of the 
past as now you can have the same 
experience in your own home. 
BASS IN YOUR FACE  
To truly take the home cinematic 
experience to the next level, 
the B8 comes with a dedicated 
subwoofer that has an 8” cone 
and a 220-watt amplifier capable 
of delivering a cinematic bass 
response. You will not only be 
watching the movie but also feel 
as if you are a part of it, adding in 
a sense of realism and authenticity 
that cannot be found at your 
local cinema.
SPEAKERS 
EVERYWHERE  
The B8 comes with 18 built-in speakers, 
all of which are upwards-firing to 
provide a truly authentic experience with 
a dash of realism as if you were actually 
part of the car chase or shootout. At 
the centre of the soundbar lies drivers 
that are solely dedicated on dialogue, 
so you will be able to hear the villains’ 
evil plot perfectly clear while still 
having the movie's soundtrack playing in 
the background.

THE PERFECT 
HOME ACCESSORY  
The Samsung HW-K950 Soundbar 
provides the ultimate in 4K audio 
experience like no other. You 
can now have 4K enhancement 
in sound, another reason 
to never leaving your house 
again. Just be sure to have a 
compatible Ultra 4K TV on hand.
DOLBY ATMOS-ENABLED 
If you're wondering why it sounds like the 
HW-K950 Soundbar seems too good to 
be true, it's all due to the Dolby Atmos 
technology that has been applied into the 
soundbar. From the rush of waterfalls 
to even a plane taking off right above you, 
you can hear and experience everything 
thanks to the overhead effects produced 
by the speakers.
ELEVATE YOUR LIVING 
SPACE 
Samsung added its Surround 
Sound Expansion Plus technology 
into the HW-K950, which will add a 
vertical dimension to just about 
any soundtrack or movie you're 
listening to. The soundbar also 
comes with upward-firing drivers in 
its main and rear speakers.
Samsung 
Slams it Home
The HW-K950 can be 
connected wirelessly so you 
will not need to connect 
the main soundbar to the 
subwoofer or even the rear 
speakers through cables.
A 4K experience that pairs well 
with other Samsung home 
theatre products. - Wi-Liam

4K RECORDING AT 
ANY FOCAL LENGTH  
Thanks to the combination of 
the APS-C sensor, BIONX image 
processor as well as the range 
of Sony’s G and Zeiss lenses, 
the camera can capture great 
photos as well as 4K recording 
at any focal length the users 
desire. This flexibility gives the 
a6500 unparalleled power in both 
photography and videography. 
SEMI-ENTHUSIAST 
PHOTOGRAPHY TOOL 
If you like to snap around, the Sony 
a6500 is also a great photography 
device. Thanks to the compact 
rangefinder form factor, the a6500 
does not look like your typical camera 
and is easily carried around without 
making the photographer stand 
out from the crowd. Thanks to the 
interchangeable lens, it can even be 
suited to fit any photography need – 
from portrait, landscape and even macro. 
MORE THAN MEETS 
THE EYE 
The a6500 is not an upgrade to the 
a6300 – rather it is the next tier-up 
model for the family. That is why it 
is fitted with the best technology 
from the larger brother. This 
includes the 5-axis stabiliser system, 
S-Log and flat profile recording 
for video recording (both in 1080p 
and 4K) and the long battery life 
from the a6300 in the body no 
bigger than the smaller cousin. 
Capture in 
Hi-Def
Unfortunately, there 
is no fully articulated 
LCD touch display – 
boo.
The α6500 can be 
charged using a 
powerbank – making 
it very convenient in 
the field.
You get a full 
hotshoe, so you can 
fit in a full flash for 
flash photography.

PACKS A PUNCH 
The Canon M6 mirrorless is a 
blend between DSLR and compact 
shooters. For its size, it could 
pass as a slightly chunkier point 
and shoot; in fact, the quality of 
the shots closely resembles 
what a DSLR is capable of. At 
24.2-megapixels, the camera 
produces very clear, sharp shots 
that picks out details in low light. 
I admit I was sceptical at first but 
after looking at the quality of 
shots, I’m convinced it can be a more 
portable alternative to my DSLR.
LIMIT ON LENSES
While Canon’s flagship line enjoys a 
myriad variation of EF mount lenses, 
the M series uses EF-M mounts, which 
has less variety. While the lenses itself 
are smaller and lighter, the limited 
choice means sometimes you don’t 
quite get the exact type of shot you 
are after. For an amateur or advanced 
enthusiast photographer, it may be 
sufficient but for anyone looking for 
more technical level quality, it might 
fall a tiny bit short. The kit lens I’ve 
got with the unit is a 15-45mm lens, 
which does well at scenic shots, but 
falters a bit with moving portraits.
FAST FOCUS
With Dual Pixel CMOS AF, the camera's 
focus is very fast, making it ideal 
for taking photos during fast 
paced events. it also works very 
well in situations with plenty of 
light; as with DSLRs, you might need 
to adjust some settings during low 
light, as the autofocus might not 
always be spot on. With 5-axis Digital 
IS, it helps with preventing camera 
shakes while shooting on-the-go. 
In fact, even shooting on a moving 
vehicle, I was able to get some 
pretty clear shots.
Compact 
Wonder Kit
You can swap out the 
lenses based on what you 
are shooting. The lenses 
are compact-sized too!
The EVF can be 
flipped out in 
different angles.
This is a strong compact 
mirrorless that gives you 
quality rivalling DSLRs. - Satoko

NOT THE DEVIL 
The PowerColor Red Devil Golden 
Sample Radeon RX 580 is one of 
the first RX580 based graphics 
card in the market. It is quite boxy 
and angular design. Black with red 
accent is the order of the day, 
which is apt for its “Red Devil name”; 
though you shouldn’t confuse it 
with the Red Devil football team. 
MAYBE IT IS THE 
DEVIL… 
The Red Devil RX580 supports 
DirectX 12, as well as Vulkan. 
Combined with the 8GB GDDR5, 
as well as the faster clocked 
graphics, AAA games are not a 
problem with this card, and best 
of all this powerful card only 
draws 550W max. 
PERFORMS LIKE THE DEVIL
Under the hood, this graphic card rocks 
a 14nm AMD RX580 chipset (Ellsemere), 8GB 
of GDDR5 memory that has been clocked 
to 2000Mhz and has an interface width of 
256bit. The card itself will try to push 
itself to 1380Hz, which is a mind-blowing 
optimisation compared to the RX480. For 
efficient power draw, the card utilises 
an 8+6 power connection.
The Devil 
is In
The card is slim 
enough to slip PCI-e 
devices below it on 
the motherboard.
 Robust and 
strong performer 
for any game you 
want it to play.

NOT A VEGA
This graphics card is still a 
contender for mid-to-high 
gaming, but it is certainly not 
an RX Vega card. However, it 
doesn’t mean it is gimped. The 
Polaris architecture in the GPU 
is nothing to scoff at, and 
it can go head-to-head with 
team green. The 2,304 shader 
processors gives it enough 
juice to render any games at 
high, if not ultra-high. 
GAMING PROWESS 
As it is a Graphics Processing Unit 
(GPU), you would think rendering 
graphics on screen should be a piece 
of cake; and of course, it is. Running 
Rise of the Tomb Raider, the card 
peaked at a respectable 82fps at 
1080p resolution. Unfortunately, it 
did falter on 4K resolution, hitting 
29fps. Then again, most mainstream 
cards apart from the top-tier cards 
rendered similar framerate numbers, 
so it is still a win.
POWER WHEN 
YOU NEED IT
When games ask for more rendering 
power, the ASUS Strix RX 580 will do 
the job with no problem. The 8GB of 
GDDR5 RAM means all your textures will be 
loaded, and everything can go into high 
definition. Thanks to the ASUS three-fan 
setup, it will be kept cool; although, it 
can be annoyingly buzzing on full load. 
If you are in a quiet room, you will 
notice it. If you have headphones around 
you – nothing is lost. 
Never 
Second Rate
You get DVI, two HDMI 
2.0 and two DisplayPort 
on-board. For the 
interested, this card is VR 
Ready and waiting.
Something unique is that 
the fans on the GPU can be 
connected via headers to the 
motherboard for fine-tune 
controls of the speed.
ASUS’ RGB control system 
is up and ready with this 
card – hook it to a header 
and turn it into your 
personal disco ball with 
your room acting as the 
dance floor.

cool while keeping cool 
and pumping out polygons

SOLDIER ON 
The MSI Krait Gaming is a full sized 
ATX motherboard. It comes in a 
normal sized box featuring some 
cool looking snake scales on 
the front, which make sense since 
a Krait is a type of snake. 
We love the MSI Krait Gaming 
motherboard colour scheme; it 
has a nice balance of black and 
white. This means that it should 
nicely fit either black or white 
casing. It accepts any socket 1151 
processor, which means the Kaby 
Lake as well as the previous gen 
Skylake can be used.
SIMPLE TO USE 
The BIOS was easy to navigate and 
as expected from the Z270 chipset 
features a plethora of overclocking 
options. You can overclock just 
about everything, from BCLK to single 
core speed of your processor. 
But if you are not that overclocking 
savvy, MSI has include two large 
buttons in the bios. One is Game 
Boost, which will optimally 
overclock your processor 
depending on which processor you 
use, and XMP, which overclock your 
RAM depending on the built-in memory 
profile.
 BLACK OR WHITE 
The motherboard features dual channel 
DDR4 support. What’s cool is that all 
of the four DDR4 slots are aluminium 
encased, dubbed steel armour by MSI. 
With Intel Xtreme Memory Profile 
(XMP) you can overclock your RAM up to 
3800Mhz.
The motherboard if fitted with some 
awesome white LEDs on the rear of 
the board, which gives it a rather cool 
looking glow, especially once you have 
fitted it into a casing. Also fitted on this 
board is the Realtek ALC 1220 based Audio 
Boost 4 solution which gives gamers the 
outmost best in audio quality.
Bombs 
Away!
Thanks to the full 
featured BIOS, 
you can push this

ENOUGH PORTS FOR ALL
As this is a Mini-ITX motherboard, the ASRock 
Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming-ITX/AC needs to have 
everything within the allocated footprint. You 
get dual-channel DIMM slots, six SATA ports 
and even a high-end audio codec chipset for 
on-board audio.
At the back, you get six USB ports and a Type-C 
USB port for future proofing. Also available 
are on-board USB headers in both USB 2.0 and 
USB 3.1 Gen. 1. Plus, there are also both HDMI 2.0 
and DisplayPort connectors for graphics, in 
the chance you do not want to use the PCIe 
x16 slot for any graphic cards.
OTHER SUPPORTIVE 
FUNCTIONS 
While the motherboard is tiny, ASRock 
manages to slip in a full speed M.2 slot 
for SSD, so everything can literally 
fit on the motherboard. ASRock 
also manages to fit both 802.11ac Wi-Fi 
and Bluetooth on board, so your 
connectivity options are set. Located 
at the rear of the motherboard 
is a USB Type-C port, which is also a 
Thunderbolt 3 connection. This makes 
it easier to accept high-speed storage 
transfers when you need it.
IMPRESSIVE 
PERFORMANCE
Thanks to the support 
for unlocked CPUs, 
the motherboard can 
overclock with ease for 
both the processor and 
the RAM. In the size of a 
shoebox (and with ample 
cooling), you can easily 
overclock your CPU to 
the limit without breaking 
the board (and more 
importantly, the bank).
Packed to

Use this as 
your compact

your stress level lies. It denotes 
stress to four levels: Low, Medium, 
High and Very High. Once you’ve hit 
High, the band will take notice and 
provide you with stress relieving 
exercises to ensure your head 
doesn’t go through the roof.

FOR A PRICE 
Fitbit has always been at the 
forefront when it came to 
smart band technology as 
its constantly coming up with 
innovative technologies on how 
to better your lives through 
its smart bands. However, the 
thing about Fitbit’s smart bands 
is its price and the Alta HR is no 
different as it retails at RM730, 
a rather steep price to pay to 
want to stay fit. This is exactly 
why people like me will never 
achieve beast mode status as 
we must pay through the nose 
for it. 
SMART TECH
One of its standout features is the 
PurePulse technology – Fitbit’s very 
own heartrate tracking technology. 
I’d like to say that the PurePulse 
technology is highly accurate as my 
heartrate was off the charts as I was 
trying to keep my lungs from bursting 
out of my chest. Another notable 
feature is Fitbit’s all-new Sleep Stages 
feature, which will show your sleep 
time in light, deep and REM sleep. This 
helped us better understand our own 
quality of sleep. It also comes with a 
nifty silent alarm to wake you up based 
on the number of hours you’ve slept 
and when is the correct time. 
STYLISH ACCESSORY
In typical Fitbit fashion, the wristband 
on the Alta HR in interchangeable, much 
like its many other smart bands. This 
makes wearing the Alta HR worthwhile 
for every occasion as you can choose 
between its premium leather band – 
that comes in three colours – and its 
metallic cuff-like bands. The latter 
encompasses either its stainless-steel 
choice or you can also opt for the 
more ostentatious 22k gold-plated 
band. There are also Alta HR special 
edition bands, which uses the most 
popular colours of the season right 
now paired with 22k gold, making you 
look stylish and classy at the same time.
Get Fit
Despite all its quirky 
accessories that can 
be paired with the Alta 
HR to go along with its 
ridiculous price.
Through the Fitbit 
smartphone app, you can 
also curate your very own 
exercise plan, which the Alta 
HR will ensure you follow 
every step of the way. 
The Fitbit AltaHR is the 
partner for you as its 
features are second to none 
but so is its price. - Wi-Liam

TEMPERED GLASS! 
Thermaltake is quite a proven name 
for PC enthusiast in terms of 
producing quality and affordable 
casings. Their identity of 
simple-looking but sleek products 
have been a favourite for years now, 
and it’s not a surprise when we see 
their latest product, the Thermaltake 
Core G21 TG Casing. The “TG” here, if 
you haven’t guessed it yet, stands for 
tempered glass. And, it’s not every day 
you can find a tempered glass casing 
that is selling for sub RM300.
 FRAGILITY NO 
MORE 
The design of the casing extends 
to two clips at the bottom that 
keeps the tempered glass in place 
so you won’t have to worry about 
its fragile side panels. Although 
slightly tinted, it’s clear enough 
to check on your components. 
Sadly, this also means that you 
can see the cables running at the 
back, which is a double-edged 
sword if you’re one of those 
that hates cable management (like 
me).
SMALL MATTER 
The case is compact and garnished in 
matte black all over. Its simple design 
exudes elegance, but it would’ve been 
nicer if the white Thermaltake logo is 
blended into the casing rather than being 
stuck on. The perforated front-end 
gives lots of room for air to enter and 
cool the innards, either using air cooling 
via three 120mm fans (or two 140mm’s) or 
a maximum 360mm-sized radiator if you’re 
into water cooling. Fans can be installed 
either on the top, at the rear or even at 
the bottom of the casing.
Core 
Strength 
You are only limited to two 
3.5-inch storage devices. Two 
2.5-inch SSD mounts are also 
included and can be found on 
top of the PSU shroud.
We are surprised that the 
PSU is mostly shrouded 
from the front and top. 
This does mean that you 
won’t be able to show off 
some “bling” PSUs.

DESIGN AND SHAPE 
The Masterbox 5t is a 
departure from the safe and 
under-the-radar design of its 
predecessor. The mid-tower 
chassis features a red front 
mesh, a roof dust filter and 
a motherboard tray that 
certainly adds more character 
while still having a practical 
purpose. The I/O panel now 
sports a fan controller 
alongside the dual USB 3.0 
ports and audio jacks.
REAL-WORLD AIRFLOW & 
NOISE
While this case was built for gaming, I 
also intended for it to be my secondary 
video editing workstation, which meant 
thermal performance and noise dampening 
were equally important. Despite not 
being in the high-end spectrum with a 
dual-fan configuration, I was able to run 
my i7 6700K with a minor overclock at 
reasonable temperatures, rarely peaking 
over 60°C. Airflow was good with fresh 
air being pulled from the front panel 
mesh and exited via the rear and top vents.
YOU DECIDE THE INSIDE
Coller Master has been focusing on 
the idea of modular design, giving 
builders more flexibility in layout and 
configuration for a more simplified 
case-building experience. The interior 
of the chassis is spacious enough for 
pain-free installation of your core 
components. For clumsy people like 
me, the front panel comes off easily 
for better access to the internals. 
The interior has enough clearance for 
the beefier and bigger air coolers as 
well as the chunkier graphic cards.
Mid-sized 
Modularity
The front bracket supports 
radiators up to 360mm for 
those seeking liquid-cooled 
performance without the 
need to fuss with brackets 
or adapters.

35 Years of 
Excellence 
pson caps off the year in 
stellar fashion, reporting better 
performance in its key business 
areas, namely printing and 
visual; while new ventures of robotics 
and wearables show promising growth. 
Celebrating three and half decade in 
Southeast Asia, Epson is all geared 
for the future – establishing itself as a 
visionary technology company. 
During 
its 
35th 
anniversary 
celebration 
in 
Singapore, 
President 
Minoru Usui attributed the strong growth 
to the company’s strategic shift in business 
focus towards the B2B segment.
Armed with wealth of knowledge 
in 
various 
technology 
eco-system, 
Epson is making use of its know-how in 
printing, visual and assembly of micro 
components, to expand into enterprise 
inkjet printers, commercial projectors, 
wearables and robotics. 
Epson’s product innovation on its 
inkjet printers with the InkTank technology 
shows off the company’s research and 
development prowess. Case in point: over 
20 million InkTank printers have been 
shipped so far; its InkTank business 
in Southeast Asia grew 13% over the 
last two years. The company now looks 
to expand its business model from 
consumer to the less volatile enterprise 
segment, a sector untapped.
Offering exceptional low operating 
cost and high-volume printing, its 
WorkForce Enterprise A3 printer targets 
medium and large businesses - a new 
area of expansion for Epson. While many 
choose to enter a new business segment 
through merger and acquisition, Epson 
prides itself for building its own products 
from scratch. The WorkForce Enterprise 
A3 printer is built on its proven Precision 
Core linehead technology, where it can 
now achieve breakthrough printing speeds 
of up to 100 pages per minute (ppm), one 
of the fastest speeds in inkjet printing.
In wearables, Epson introduces 
the latest generation of Moverio smart 
glasses - the BT-350 and BT-2200 - which 
found a purpose in the commercial and 
industrial environments. For instance, 
the BT-350 can be used in museums and 
tourism where a user can walk up to an 
exhibition and have an augmented guide 
explain on the screen. The industrial 
grade BT-2200 can be fitted over helmets,

suitable for enterprise AR applications 
such as remote technical assistance.
As for robotics, it is undeniable 
that the new buzzword in manufacturing 
is Industrial 4.0. The use of advance 
technology is taking place, where 
factories around the world look to 
enhance work floors with robotics and 
autonomous manufacturing with the 
advent of Internet of Things. 
A pioneer in Scara robots, Epson 
also unveils its comprehensive line-up 
in robotics - suited for precision level 
assembly requirements for electronics and 
smart devices. The compact and versatile 
entry-level model is ideal for simple pick-
and-place applications such as assembly, 
inspection and feeding tasks. In the future, 
we could even see robots that can see, 
sense, think and work like humans.

ON ITS OWN, BOOST HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN JANUARY 2017. 
ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW INTO THE MARKET, BOOST CEO CHRISTOPHER 
TIFFIN BELIEVES THAT IT WILL SUCCEED, AND HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO DO SO.
THE RIGHT WAY TO 
BOOST (PART 1)
By Teh Wi-Liam
PART 2 WILL BE COMING 
OUT IN THE NEXT ISSUE.

DEC 2017
C.com: Could you share a bit 
more about the Boost app, 
how it came about and of 
course, what made Axiata 
move into this space?
Christopher Tiffin: Actually, Axiata has 
been in mobile money for a long time. 
Celcom has had a mobile money license 
for the past few years now, which we 
got from Bank Negara. If you look across 
the footprint, we have got mobile money 
services in every market. But, the reality is, 
the game’s changing.
In every market, it’s a different brand, 
different product and different technology. 
There’s no synergy and it’s all developed 
in markets under the telco operations. 
However, in the past five years, the telcos 
are changing. There’s a lot of competition 
and a lot of digital services coming in.
The digital evolution curve is really 
accelerating so as a group, we decided to 
have the core of Axiata separate from Boost. 
We did a little assessment on how best to 
do that and the decision was that we should 
have the setting outside of the traditional 
operation as a separate structure. With that, 
we take it from just being mobile money 
to digital financial services. In a separate 
vertical, this allows us the opportunity a) 
to be a different brand; b) it allows us to be 
agnostic, where we’re given the freedom of 
choice of working with many industries.
Interestingly enough, Boost was 
actually incubated in Celcom, but to digitise 
the telecommunications services. Of course, 
the end goal is to become more than that. 
We wanted to become more than just 
telecommunications and move more into 
digital financial services. So, it supports the 
core, but it also provides other services.
Since January 2017, we moved 
from doing just telecommunications with 
Celcom and launched the app. However, 
operationally, we have been carved out 
and operating independently. But, the key 
thing I want to say is that we do want to be 
seen more than just a wallet. It is more of a 
lifestyle with the interaction and experience 
that we offer you is more than just function, 
with a little bit of an emotional attachment.
PC.com: With that said, it leaves me 
to my next question. You’re coming 
into the market at a time where 
there are already a couple of other 
players out there and even telcos are 
getting into the action while mostly 
dedicated to their own subscribers. 
What makes potential users to feel 
compelled to use Boost?
Christopher: I think that is the million-dollar 
question. But, there are many factors to 
consider. Firstly, how can we be better than 
cash? The reason we’re doing this is not 
because we just want to make a business 
out of it; we want to address a need. And 
the need is starting from digital economy, 
which is a huge factor in Malaysia. Then, a 
portion of that is also financial inclusion and 
through that is where the digital economy 
is a growth factor.
But, financial inclusion is where it starts 
getting better than cash. That’s the premise of 
where we’re working from. We don’t want to 
compete with banks or credit cards, we want 
to work with them to develop the ecosystem 
so that we can become the fintech arm to 
deliver what banks are not able to deliver 
today to replace cash.
In the digital world, the ‘ego-system’ 
needs to grow and change to become an 
ecosystem. The days of owning everything and 
doing everything yourself is gone; partnership 
and collaboration is key along with education.
On the topic of how we’re going to 
get people to use Boost, the first step is 
understanding. Education and understanding 
needs to be done, and not just for consumers, 
but also for partners and merchants for them 
to see this as a form of replacing cash.
Through the combination of those 
areas, there’s no one element that will make 
it, there’s no silver bullet. It is an ecosystem 
development that needs to happen, it must be 
done jointly and yes, there are plenty of others 
coming in. The reason being is because it’s 
a huge opportunity. There is no such thing 
as competition; our biggest competitors 
are ourselves. We are our own biggest 
hurdle. Competitors should be ecosystem 
development partners and that is where we 
should be heading.
In saying that, in Malaysia, there are 
26 licenses for e-wallets. Hopefully, there 
will be a lot more coming in next year. Is that 
sustainable? Most probably not. Is it going 
to be a consolidation? I think there would 
have to be. Otherwise, the education part 
becomes confusing, not just for consumers 
but also for the market. It’s a process. At the 
moment, how do we see ourselves being 
different? One of the key elements is that 
we do have – not just in Malaysia but in 
the region of Southeast Asia – access to 
350 million customers across the footprint. 
Another key aspect is that we also got 
access to a lot of data.
PC.com: And how would you convince a 
new user into using Boost and adopting 
a cashless society?
Christopher: To be fair, that is the hardest 
nut to crack. The change of behaviour is the 
key fundamental to making all this work. 
But, what we’ve seen through technology, 
it has rapidly progressed over the past 10 
years. Back then, we didn’t have iPhones 
and now, we can’t live without them. If 
you look at the evolution over the last five 
years, it’s double of what we’ve had in 
the first five years.
It has taken 10 years from being told 
what we think you want to be in control 
of oneself. That journey takes time but 
it’s the change of behaviour that is the 
fundamental thing that will drive it.
But the reality is, it’s also a ripple 
effect of what happened. If we look at 
the young digital adults and the older 
generation, you will find that the adoption 
rate in certain age groups are a lot quicker. 
This is because of the usability of it, the 
convenience as well as the ability for them 
to bring others into the ecosystem.
There is absolutely no way you can 
get everyone adopted from day one. It 
is going to take time, but this where the 
relevance of what we’re doing needs 
to be more important instead of just 
the functional aspect of it. It needs to 
be convenient, secure and it fulfils a 
need. For me, that creates relevancy 
rather than just functionality.

or 
companies 
in 
Malaysia, 
“digital transformation” or “DX” 
is a buzzword. A mobile and 
agile workforce, new consumer 
experiences, 
streamlined 
operational 
processes – these are some of the competitive 
benefits made possible by digital technology.
Such is the momentum to transform, 
the DX professional services market is 
expected to grow at a compound annual 
rate of 21.9% in Asia Pacific excluding 
Japan, according to iDC. 
However, even as they know 
that 
transformation 
is 
necessary, 
CiOs and other C-suite leaders face a 
daunting task. They need to make what 
seem like monumental decisions on 
huge investments, in everything from 
networking solutions and cloud services to 
database and collaboration applications. 
Many believe that, to ensure no iT 
legacy, the entire infrastructure needs 
to be redesigned or upgraded from the 
inside out. This is a myth; the truth is 
that being overly ambitious can actually 
slow the DX process. Many of the most 
successful transformations start with 
the basics and leave more sophisticated 
functionality as the next step. 
And the most important basic are 
people and their experiences. The key to 
changing the employee’s way of working is 
end-user devices. These account for 10% 
of the typical transformation budget, but 
are often the key reason for the success or 
failure of a change initiative.

Digital 
Transformation
Taking the first step

However, most organisations have 
not given enough focus on its people. 
Based on PwC’s Global Digital iQ survey 
2017, 68% of the respondents say that 
their CeO is a champion for digital and their 
CiO has attained strategic stature, many 
other senior executives and the functional 
areas they lead are not yet fully engaged in 
the project of digital transformation.
The deployment of tehse powerful 
end-user computing devices is a first step 
in a transformation journey. it enables 
businesses to build a solid foundation 
for the entire iT ecosystem and prepares 
for changes to come – whether these are 
powerful new collaboration capabilities, 
re-envisioned consumer experiences or 
artificial intelligence-powered tools. 
it is also important to remember 
that one size doesn’t fit all and future 
functional needs matter. Long gone are 
the days when everyone in a company 
was issued with a standard laptop. 
we see this first-hand at Lenovo, 
where there is an increasing number 
of customers who value diversity in the 
end user environment.
Account managers and mobile 
sales staff, for example, need lightweight 
premium devices with long battery life 
and 
high 
performance. 
Operational 
personnel and field researchers need 
durable tablets. On-site support staff 
are looking for sleek design, reliability 
and multiple ports.
To illustrate the above point, we 
have a customer case where its end-user 
devices were connected to a range of 
different servers at its data centre. The 
fast-growing company is adding 30 to 
50 new employees per month. Because 
it’s able to provide devices appropriate 
to each user, these workers are happier 
and more productive – whether they are 
giving presentations in the field, logging 
in from remote locations or producing 
videos in the company’s in-house studio. 
The transformation has made its team 
more flexible and agile.
Another 
key 
to 
success 
is 
choosing the right iT partner. Digital 
transformation can be intimidating, 
and the right partner will not only 
help a business take a good first step, 
but also think ahead and be with a 
company through every step in its 
transformation journey. 
Having the right devices is a 
crucial first step in a successful digital 
transformation, but they are often 
overlooked. indeed, they may be the 
strongest success factor in a digital 
transformation and achieving long-term 
business success.

oday, the business environment 
is rapidly changing. Companies 
face 
the 
challenge 
of 
increasing 
competition, 
expanding markets, and rising customer 
expectations.  This brings pressures 
to Malaysian industries to lower total 
costs in the entire supply chain, shorten 
throughput times, drastically reduce 
inventories, expand product choice, 
provide more reliable delivery dates 
and better customer service, improve 
quality, and efficiently coordinate global 
demand and supply.  
As many as seven out of ten 
enterprise 
resource 
planning 
(eRP) 
vendors and resellers are developing 
solutions that are industry 4.0 ready. They 
are doing this in expectation of a boom in 
industry 4.0 technologies, and a growth 
in manufacturing processes that embrace 
the principles of this much anticipated 
fourth industrial Revolution.  
According to the report done by 
myForesight, in the recent MiTi dialogue 
with the Federation of Manufacturers of 
Malaysia (FMM), it was reported that 
most manufacturers are aware of the 
industry 4.0 concept, but only 30% 
have started to invest and leverage on 
modern technology. if Malaysia is to 
compare itself with countries in terms 
of high-tech exports, the country was 
ranked 11th in the world in 2014 with 
US$63.38 billion (bn). 
So what makes industry 4.0 different 
to what has come before and why are eRP 
systems central to the debate? industry 
4.0 demands the digitisation of product 
and the processes that create them. in 
manufacturing, the concept is intricately 
entwined with that of the industrial 
internet of Things (iiOT), where machines 
are connected to machines, where humans 
can extract information from machines, 
and where both can learn from trends and 
take action based on informed decisions. 
All of which helps to build a 
production environment that’s far superior, 
far more connected, and far more efficient 
than we’ve witnessed before – one where 
an eRP system is a central information hub 
for monitoring and tracking progress. 
Ultimately, industry 4.0 and iiOT are 
not an end in themselves, they are about 
fuelling business growth. As the industry 
of Things world 2017 Report shows, 62% 
of international industrial companies 
expect iiOT to enable new business 
models and revenue streams. And it is 
already happening–those businesses 
that have digitised their product 
portfolio have grown at above average 
rates in the last three years. 
Yet despite the clear business 
case for embracing it, only one in three 
businesses currently place industry 4.0 at 
the top of the agenda. if you are one of the 
remaining two in three, the time is ripe to 
start playing catch up. 
Crucial to getting ready for industry 
4.0, is the need to analyse existing iT 
systems, so that you can see if your current 
eRP will be able to cope with the changing 
demands you place on it. The following six 
considerations are a good place to start.
1. What does your current ERP 
software architecture look like? 
Give your software architecture an 
audit and assess how future-ready 
it is. For example, do you find that 
updates and release changes are 
postponed because of the complexity 
of the entire system? 
eRP software in a fast-moving 
industry 4.0 world acts as a central 
management 
platform 
between 
production, company management, 
customers, and suppliers. it is therefore 
subject to continuous requirements in 
terms of scalability, data management, 
and connectivity with third party 
systems. if constant changes are costly 
and burdensome, your eRP system 
might not be suited to industry 4.0. 
Consider replacing it with 
a system that’s based on a 
uniform technology stack, such 
as Microsoft .neT, which allows 
extensions 
without 
interfering 
with programme code, thanks to a 
service-oriented architecture.
2. How do your systems currently 
talk to each other?
Question how different departments 
in 
your 
business 
relate 
and 
communicate with each other, and 
what sort of data they share. For 
example, if business management, 
sales, finance, logistics or material 
management need production data, 
how do they access it? Do they pick 
up the phone, share spreadsheets, 
or do they have to navigate the 
interface between the eRP and the 
production management system to 
get their answers? 
To realise the benefits of 
industry 4.0, all departments should 
be able to access the same real-time 
production data, in no more than a few

clicks of an eRP system. That eRP system, 
furthermore, may need to be integrated 
with the business’s manufacturing 
execution system (MeS) for data to be 
truly accurate. if your current system isn’t 
up to this level of integration, you might 
need to consider something new.
3. Are your decisions based on gut 
instinct alone?
Making quick and accurate decisions is 
a key principle of operating a business 
in an industry 4.0 environment. But 
these decisions should be informed 
by data–not just instinct. For many 
businesses, 
accessing 
detailed 
production data without delay is 
difficult, so business leaders tend to 
fill the gaps in their decision making 
with past experience or gut instinct. 
it’s 
something 
we’ve 
all 
been guilty of at some point, but 
doing this leaves little scope for 
measuring success, or tracking return 
on investment (ROi). There is also 
less certainty that you’ve made the 
right decision at all, because there 
are fewer numbers to back up your 
strategy. if, however, your eRP system 
is giving you the real-time data you 
need, you can calculate value, and 
build business plans with conviction.
4. Are you using multiple data 
sources?
if your existing eRP solution allows 
the different departments in your 
business 
to 
‘speak 
the 
same 
language’ then you’re already on the 
way to being industry 4.0 ready. 
Thanks to their integrated 
analytics functions, today’s next-gen 
eRP solutions make it possible to 
capture and store data, not just from the 
production process, but also customer 
behaviour data, B2B e-commerce 
intelligence, and information about 
market developments. Providing this 
‘networked view’ of the business to 
every department allows everyone–
from finance to sales, and from 
marketing to business development–
to make decisions based on the 
same data. So, if customer behaviour 
data reveals an increased trend 
for a particular product, the sales 
team will have access to real-time 
information to drive increased 
sales of the product. Manufacturing 
plants, in turn, will be able to 
respond with increased production, 
in time to meet demand.
5. Do you have the same 
functionality in the cloud?
Businesses change quickly–as does 
what a business needs from its 
eRP solution. Some traditional eRP 
systems lack a sophisticated cloud 
or hybrid option, only offering full 
functionality when they are used on-
premises. But this sort of software 
can be very limiting for businesses 
that are growing and changing 
rapidly. For example, if your business 
decides to open a new facility in a 
geographically remote location, you 
may want this new facility to use 
cloud-based software initially, so 
it can hit the ground running, and 
continuously share data and process 
flows with central systems.  
An eRP solution that has cloud, 
on-premises or hybrid options that 
are built on the same architecture, 
with the same functionalities, data 
models and business logics, offers the 
ultimate level of flexibility for scaling 
and changing with business strategy.  
6. Is your ERP ready for IIOT?
next-gen eRP solutions will not just 
tell machines what to do, they will 
also take orders from the machines 
themselves. For example, when a 
machine part in an iiOT production 
plant needs maintenance, it will send 
a message to the eRP system, which 
will facilitate that maintenance before 
it becomes a problem, or re-prioritise 
tasks so that production levels are 
uninterrupted in the meantime. 
Can your systems do this 
already? if so, you’re on your way 
to being prepared for industry 4.0. 
However, iiOT in the industry 4.0 
world is not just about machines 
reacting to current events, it is also 
tactical. intelligence from machines 
should be used to inform the 
wider business, from service level 
agreements, to short and long-term 
sales and marketing strategies. when 
your business is connecting all of 
these dots, you are well and truly part 
of the fourth industrial Revolution.  
The opportunities presented by 
the iiOT extend far beyond advanced 
aftersales customer care and an intelligent 
production cycle. They seem to be 
unlimited – but only if you have the right 
technology in place. So, if your business is 
on a journey towards industry 4.0, perhaps 
it’s time to use these questions to ask if 
your eRP solution talks fluent iiOT.

GaMeTiMe reviews

fter spending 10 years setting up the Call of Duty (CoD) franchise in a modern warfare setting with a futuristic version of 
war, the CoD series is throwing things back to 1955 with Call of Duty: World War II (CoD: WWII).
Published by Activision and developed by Sledgehammer Games, CoD: WWII is something of a Hail Mary play as it’s 
no secret that the general gaming community has gotten bored with the direction the series has taken over the past few 
iterations. Gone are the past games’ verticality and speed but this is a good thing in my opinion. Players now have to think about their 
actions as opposed to just firing out of reflex.
A

DEC 2017

Single Player
Campaign mode in CoD: WWII puts you 
into the heart of the European theatre of 
combat, centred around the 1st Infantry 
Division. You play US Army Private, 
Ronald “Red” Daniels as he takes part 
in the Normandy D-Day landings while 
slowly advancing through the Western 
Front. The series’ combat eases back 
into this historical setting with good 
storytelling and some real fun action 
movie-style sequences.
As you bond with your fellow 
brothers-in-arms over the course of the 
campaign, these bonds carry into the 
game mechanics as Red relies on each 
squad member for different utilities, 
like replenishing ammo, health kits, 
highlighting enemies or calling in mortar 
strikes. As health doesn’t regenerate like 
it used to, requesting for health packs 
becomes a necessity if you hope to survive 
the horror of combat.
Speaking about the horrors of war, the 
campaign does a good job of implementing 
moral 
implications 
throughout 
the 
playthrough. You can’t kill enemies if 
they’ve surrendered; attempting to kill them 
will restart you at the last checkpoint.
There are also optional Heroic 
Actions, which forces the players to think 
and act fast to help their fellow soldiers 
or suffer the guilt of failing to save them. 
These little touches set within a war-torn 
Europe makes for some emotionally heavy 
moments. The campaign toes the line 
between being an interactive history 
lesson and a fun action-packed shooter.
The entire campaign playthrough 
will take about six hours of riveting 
gameplay, which some might consider 
short. In all fairness, I felt that the 
campaign storyline is one of the better 
ones, rivalling even CoD: Black Ops, in 
terms of player engagement.
Multiplayer
Multiplayer has gone through some 
massive revamps with the introduction of 
a new social space called Headquarters; 
this is a nod towards the Tower in the 
Destiny series. At the Headquarters, 
players can open Supply Drops, go through 
multiplayer challenges for extra rewards, 
engage with other players and more.
Also gone are the Create-a-Class 
and perks system. Instead, players can 
now enlist into one of five Divisions with 
their own set of unique skills. Players are 
not limited to certain weapon choices 
after enlisting in a specific division. The 
key is to utilise each division’s unique 
benefits, like choosing a sniper rifle 
when enlisting in the Mountain Division, 
catered towards snipers.
Another new game mode for 
multiplayer that deserves a mention is 
War Mode. This new, team-based and 
objective-oriented game mode makes 
you choose between Axis or Allies and 
compete over a series of attack-and-defend 
objectives. One map allows you to relive 
the intense opening moments of D-Day as 
you and your friends attempt to storm or 
defend the beach, based on which side 
you chose earlier.
Zombies
I’m not ashamed to say that my main 
reason to play Call of Duty games in 
recent years is due to Zombies mode and 
it’s no different this time. The first map, 
The Final Reich is led by a star-studded 
cast with Katheryn Winnick from Vikings, 
David Tennant from Doctor Who, Elodie 
Yung from Daredevil and Ving Rhames 
from Mission Impossible playing a part.

The foursome is attempting to 
recover priceless works of art stolen by the 
Axis powers but end up in a tiny German 
village filled with hordes of the undead. A 
new addition to Zombies mode is the ability 
to choose one of four roles to play: Offense, 
Medic, Support and Control.
Each role provides you with 
temporary abilities and cooldowns; all 
these abilities come in handy as Zombies 
mode is now a far cry from the goofy antics 
of CoD: Infinite Warfare. The horror level 
increases to 11 with the generally creepy 
ambience of the village and zombies 
appearing out of thin air.
As someone who hates jump scares, 
the fear factor in Zombies mode is intense. 
Funny enough, I cannot get enough of it.
Conclusion
In the end, CoD: WWII is a welcome 
return to form for a franchise that has 
been stale over the last few years. While 
not perfect, the campaign mode is still 
plenty of fun with a more engaging and 
personal story. Multiplayer mixes things 
up but still maintains its classic CoD 
experience; you kill players and will get 
killed. The best part of it all is when 
someone starts screaming incessant 
garbage through the mic. Oh, the wonders 
of multiplayer games.
Zombies mode is also a real treat 
time for both new and veteran players. All 
in all, CoD: WWII is one of the better CoD 
games in recent years but the best in the 
series. I’d give it an A for effort though.

on’t let its cute cartoon-esque 
aesthetics fool you. This is a game 
that will unapologetically kick ass 
from the get-go. Some of you might 
not know this, but video games have never 
been all that easy during the early days. 
Super Mario Brothers, Contra, Donkey 
Kong and Frogger are some titles that come 
to mind when it comes to challenging, 
tough-as-nails platformers. When Cuphead 
was first announced a couple of years back 
at E3, I thought that perhaps, a return to the 
old classics was imminent.
Once Upon a Time
As I alluded to earlier, Cuphead is a platform 
game like popular titles of old, combining old 
1930s cartoon aesthetics with platforming 
mechanics that would make the likes of 
Crash Bandicoot and Rayman blush. 
The 
story 
for 
Cuphead 
is 
a 
straightforward one. Cuphead and his 
brother Mugman chanced upon a casino 
where they were hitting the big bucks. The 
Devil, who happens to be the proprietor of 
said casino, dared the brothers to go big or 
go home with one last dice throw. The devil 
obviously won, and demanded for their souls 
in exchange. Fearing for their lives, Cuphead 
begged the Devil to let them go, and after a 
bit of deliberation, decided to have the two 
of them collect debt (souls, in this case) 
from other debtors who have ran away.
Shooting Above Your Weight
The mechanics for Cuphead follow the 
age-old adage of “Easy to understand, 
difficult to master”, with emphasis 
on “difficult to master” to a very 
extreme degree. The game is 
essentially a big boss-rush with a few 
optional platforming levels thrown in. 
Story has it that when Cuphead was 
first conceptualised, it was supposed to be 
all boss fights and no platforming levels at 
all, but they were added in to give variety.
And what a variety it is; you fight 
animated vegetables, blobs, bees, frogs 
and all manner of other animals and 
things throughout the game. You start off 
with a peashooter and a tutorial, which 
explains the basics of the game, such as 
how to jump, duck, shoot, use your special 
abilities and so on.
The game then throws you into the 
deep end and you’ll be forced to learn 
how to evade your would-be enemy’s 
movements and attacks without any help 
given. You will have to simply die and figure 
out the mechanics with each boss, who will 
transform into a different form once you’ve 
injured them enough.

Cuphead
I encountered one particularly funny 
boss early in the game, where I went up 
against a jumping blue blob. After a while, 
it transformed into a tombstone. Having 
seen the acronym RIP on this boss, I 
thought I had bested it, only to have it slam 
on me and take out the one remaining life I 
had with no remorse.
And here are several of the factors 
that can frustrate you about fighting the 
bosses in Cuphead. They technically do 
not have a HP bar, and you will only be 
able to see the progress you made against 
them, or the platforming levels when you 
die. This is designed in such a way to 
infuriate players, because they’ll only see

good
how close they are to beating a level or a 
boss when they lose.
And if you think the lack of an 
indication is bad, dying in this game brings 
you back to the starting point of the fight 
or level, with no checkpoints. To make 
things worse, every time you die, the 
mobs and bosses all come together 
to mock your lack of skills, angering 
you even further.
That said, you can still 
gain new weapons and abilities 
via currencies that are scattered 
throughout the game and from the 
chalice levels. This allows you to 
switch to weapons and skills to suit 
the level you are at. One skill that is very 
useful is the invincible dash skill, which 
grants you temporary invulnerability. 
This helped me out in plenty of sticky 
situations where I find myself pinned 
against the wall and a barrage of 
projectiles headed my way.
A Very Pretty Sight to See
StudioMDHR did an amazing 
job designing Cuphead, with 
its deliberate take on the 1930s 
cartoon aesthetics. That was a great 
addition as it helped with the otherwise 
repetitive nature of the game. As a 
child growing up in Malaysia, I grew up 
watching some of these cartoons, and it 
was a walk down memory lane. That is, 
until I get killed for the umpteenth time by 
a giant garden vegetable.
Each boss comes with its unique 
look and feel, complete with levels that 
are designed for you to make full use of 
the surrounding environments. One issue 
I had with a number of these levels is the 
difficulty in differentiating between the 
background scenery and the enemies, as 
well as the projectiles.
This is especially the case when 
it comes to the platforming levels as 
it makes you think it was just a scenic 
route. As it turns out, there’s an enemy 
or obstacle that you need to destroy 
before you advance.
With the boss levels, you can truly 
appreciate how each fight is designed 
to be uniquely different, even with 
the base mechanics remaining the 
same throughout the game. In some 
instances, Cuphead shakes things up a 
bit by introducing boss fights where you 
fly an aeroplane, side-scroller style.
Music to My Ears
Another excellent addition to the 
game is its background music. Picture 
gaming with 1930s jazz playing in the 
background; it adds a quaint feel to 
the entire game, which helps with the 
almost unending number of deaths. I 
guarantee, there isn’t a single boring 
tune in the album, even when it’s 
almost three hours long. For PC gamers 
purchasing through Steam, StudioMDHR 
has added the digital soundtrack as 
a side purchase, should you feel like 
splurging to elevate your taste in music. 
There isn’t much dialogue to begin 
with, but each boss does have a few 
lines, much like the cartoons of that 
era, which adds to the experience. My 
favourite is Pork Rind’s (kurang halal!), 
the item proprietor who sells you your 
power-ups. His voice is downright 
demonic, and it shook me a fair bit when 
I first visited his store.
Into the Deep End
Cuphead has some of the steepest learning 
curves compared to many games that have 
released in recent times. If you’re new 
to the whole tough-as-nails platformer 
genre, you may want to consider fighting 
the bosses in Simple Mode. Having said 
that, this isn’t recommended if you intend 
to complete the game, as the last of the 
content will be gated off until you defeat 
the bosses in regular mode.
What adds to the frustration is that 
Cuphead only reveals this information 
when you get to that point. Clearing the 
game on regular will also unlock Hard 
Mode, which will take your button-pushing 
reflexes to the edges of your saniy.
For only RM38 on Steam, Cuphead 
is game that will give you hours of 
agony, frustration and joy. It may take 
some getting used to, but it’s not as 
ridiculous as Super Meat boy and its 
ilk. The mechanics are straightforward, 
and the boss fights are unique enough to 
give a sense of achievement when you 
finally figure out the patterns. I highly 
recommend this game if you’re looking 
for a challenge that isn’t Dark Souls or 
Bloodborne for once.

Gran Turismo Sport
rowing up with a PlayStation, 
Playstation 2 and now a Playstation 
4, it dawned upon me that I never 
actually owned a racing game. The 
only game to break through the mould was 
Need for Speed: Most Wanted, and that was 
solely because of the constant nagging of 
my friends to give it a go. I have yet to touch 
a Gran Turismo game, especially during its 
early days on the old consoles.
After a four-year hiatus, Polyphony 
Digital is back with Gran Turismo Sport, the 
first title out of the door for the PlayStation 4. 
This will be only my second racing simulation 
game as Need for Speed: Payback is riddled 
with enough microtransactions for me to 
hang myself (thanks, EA.)
The Realism is… real
What sets Gran Turismo Sport apart from 
other racing games like the Need for 
Speed series, Driveclub and Project Cars 
is the amount of realism adopted into the 
game. Obviously, I wouldn’t be able to 
compare seeing as I’ve never touched any 
of those games. But, a quick search through 
YouTube already gave me the answers and 
true enough, Gran Turismo Sport is out to 
be the most realistic racing simulation 
game there is.
From what I can remember, racing 
games were just meant to be casual fun 
where holding down on the R2 button 
(if that’s your preferred choice) would 
keep your virtual foot on the accelerator 
while sporadically pressing the L2 button 
to break at corners and turns. Honestly 
speaking, Gran Turismo Sport made me 
question my own ability on driving a real 
car after playing it. Thinking it’ll be a 
walk in the park, I decided to do what 
was expected of a racing game, and boy 
did I get that wrong.
The secret behind Gran Turismo Sport 
is all about patience and moderation. If you 
jam down on the brakes, the car will skid 
across the tarmac and fly head-first into 
the barriers (much like how Paul Walker 
crashed his Porsche... too soon?) What 
you need to do is slowly apply pressure on 
the brakes rather than jamming a virtual 
foot on it, like what we see in the Fast and 
Furious franchise (thanks, Dom.)
What Makes It Tick
When I spoke about the realism in Gran 
Turismo Sport, I wasn’t kidding. Even in the 
Campaign Mode, you will have to go through 
a series of license trials, racing scenarios 
and such to give yourself a proper feel of 
the game. Much like how you would when 
wanting to get your real license, but in a 
more overly-exaggerated manner.
A lot of factors are included into the 
game to make it lifelike as well. From the 
glaring sunlight in your rear-view mirror 
or even right in front of you, Polyphony 
Digital has done immensely well in this 
aspect, making it really seem like you’re 
a professional driver. If you want to take it 
up a notch, you can purchase the steering 
wheel and pedal combo online, but it 
will set you back a pretty penny. I almost 
clicked checkout on a racing simulation 
set because I have no other obligations or 
girlfriends, so I can afford to splurge (I may 
sound like I’m bragging but I’m not.)
Challenge Friends and Foes
Much like how an actual race will 
work, this is where Polyphony Digital 
have done well in terms of its PvP 
element. Known as Sports Mode, 
you will be able to race against other 
players from around the world on the 
track. There will be daily races as well 
as championship races, which grant 
better rewards.
To qualify for the daily races, you 
will need to sign up and go through the 
qualifying phase before getting into the 
real race. One thing that can lead to some 
annoyance is the “Sportsmanship Rating”, 
which is right beside your PSN ID.
This is Polyphony Digital’s way 
of weening out the players with 
unsportsmanlike conduct. This includes 
blocking race leaders who are about to lap 
you and collisions. Of course, the game 
will reward you if you do clean overtakes 
and respecting your other drivers. But who 
are we kidding; it’s the internet. Everyone

is going to be a big baby about it and not 
care about ratings… to a certain extent.
Once you’re bored with going 
through laps and cars, you may want to 
give Scapes Mode a go. As it is the game’s 
in-depth photo mode, this is where you 
can edit a freeze-frame of your shots in 
explicit detail. Picture Adobe Lightroom, 
but on cocaine. It also offers DSLR-like 
adjustments like aperture, shutter speed 
and ISO settings. This allows you to edit 
to your heart’s content on all your shots, 
which can then be uploaded onto social 
media via the Share button.
The Downside
Of course, what’s a game without its flaws, 
which Gran Turismo Sport has aplenty. From 
it’s limited tracks to its limited selection of 
cars. Sure, it promised 160 cars but in fact, 
there are only 33 car manufacturers part of 
the game. This means that there will be plenty 
of the same models but tuned to different 
settings for different races. Smart move.
With that said, I’m assuming there 
will be more content to come in the 
following months, in the form of DLCs. 
That is pretty much how the gaming 
community works these days anyway.

NieR: Automata had been in the making 
for seven years prior to the launch of its 
predecessor, NieR. Essentially a spin-off 
of the Drakengard series, NieR: Automata 
is set amid a proxy war between what’s 
left of humanity and a machine army. The 
game puts you in the control of YoRHa 
No. 2 Model B or 2B for short. You will 
be accompanied by a recon droid named 
YoRHa No. 9 Model S (9S) as you journey 
across a post-apocalyptic world.
Having been around since 1996, Resident Evil is one 
of the game franchises that just won’t seem to go 
away. This specific branch of survival-horror games 
has its own cult-like following, being adapted into 
movies as well. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is the 
11th main entry into the franchise and the 24th 
overall while being the first to remain in a first-
person shooter setting. The story focuses on Ethan 
Winters as he desperately searches for his missing 
wife Mia. This search eventually leads him to a 
rundown plantation owned by the Baker family.

series, focusing on main characters Chloe 
Frazer and ex-mercenary Nadine Ross as you 
traverse the beautiful landscapes of India in 
search of the Tusk of Ganesh.
Another game that is part of a long-serving 
franchise, Wolfenstein II is the eighth entry 
into the series and is the direct sequel to 
the 2014 hit, Wolfenstein: The New Order. 
The story is set in an alternate history 
timeline where Nazi Germany won World 
War II. You take control of war veteran 
William “BJ” Blazkowicz and try to fight your 
way through the Nazi regime.
Nioh is an action role-playing game with similar game elements with the 
likes of Bloodborne and Dark Souls. Developed by Team Ninja, Nioh was 
exclusive to just the PS4 but its PC version was recently released a month 
ago. The game puts you in the control of William, a sailor-cum-samurai

Having been in development since 2011, 
Guerilla Games definitely hit this one out of

the best-selling original IP on the PlayStation 
4 when it first released, selling three million 
copies in June 2017. What makes this game 
great is its in-depth open world setting, 
a compelling storyline complete with a 
diverse range of characters and exemplary 
visuals to boot. The game starts you off as 
Aloy as you explore the deep open world 
filled with mechanical beasts. 
Arguably the most popular video game of 2017, 
PlayUnknown’s Battlegrounds is a multiplayer 
online battle arena which pits up to 100 players 
in a single game against one another. The 
objective: to be the last man standing. That 
means using anything and everything in your 
power to best the 99 other opponents in your 
way to achieving the ever-elusive, “Winner 
Winner, Chicken Dinner.” The game starts you 
off on a dystopian island where, somehow, 
there are numerous weapons, armour and 
ammo littered around the map. You will be 
airdropped into the field where you scavenge 
and find the best way to survive while taking 
out enemies at the same time.

Unity. As for CS:GO, it will feature Tyloo

If you are looking to attend the event,

if you pre-register yourself online now rather 
than on the day of the event, you will receive 
an ASUS ROG goodie bag. You can register 
yourself here and be sure to follow the rules 
before registering.
Group Stage games will be happening 
on 7 and 8 December with streams provided 
online. All six teams from both games will be 
split into groups of three, where the top two of 
each group in their respective game will make 
their way to the grand finals. Unfortunately, 
only the grand finals are open to the public 
while group stage games will not be.

Acer Predator is looking to end 
2017 with a bang, introducing 
its Predator Triton 700 gaming 
laptop. This is Acer’s take on a gaming laptop 
with Max-Q design, which brings the trend 
even further into the mainstream market.
Drawing 
inspiration 
from 
its 
gargantuan Predator 21X, the Predator Triton 
700 is a direct opposite to the former, with a 
18.9mm thin aluminium chassis. This makes 
it a lightweight and portable gaming laptop 
for you to bring anywhere and everywhere.
At its core, the Predator Triton 700 
comes with 7th Gen. Intel Core processors 
with an overclockable NVIDIA GeForce GTX 
1808 with Max-Q design. There are also 
two built-in NVMe PICe SSDs in RAID0 
configuration while also holding up to 32GB 
of DDR4 2,400MHz memory. This makes 
storage and multitasking a breeze. The 
Predator Triton 700 will also feature Acer’s 
Dual AeroBlade 3D Fans for optimal thermal 
and cooling capabilities.
There are two options available for 
the Predator Triton 700. The top-end variant 
features the GTX 1080 with Max-Q design 
while the other features a GTX 1060 GPU. 
Both models are now available through Acer 
authorised resellers as well as through Acer 
Online Stores. The top-end model will be 
retailing at RM13,999 while the mid-range 
variant will retail at RM9,999.
Building 
on 
its 
repertoire 
of 
curved gaming monitors, Acer Predator 
brings out two to end 2017. First up 
is the 34-inch Predator X34P followed 
by the 35-inch Predator Z35P.
Both monitors come with a 21:9 
aspect ratio with UltraWide QHD (3,440 x 
1,440) displays. While the Predator X34P 
has a 1,900R curvature, the Predator Z35P 
is only curved at 1,800R. The Predator X34P 
features an IPS panel with better colour 
reproduction while the Predator Z35P has a 
VA panel to capture truer blacks.
Another feature both monitors share 
is having NVIDIA G-Sync enabled into 
them with a native 100Hz refresh rate. 
However, both monitors can be overclocked 
to 120Hz for better performance. They 
will also come with a 178° viewing angle 
and 4ms response time.
The Predator Z35P is available now at 
selected Acer resellers at RM3,899 while the 
Predator X34P will only be made available in 
mid-January 2018 with a RM4,299 price tag.
After introducing its new Max-Q 
design gaming laptop, two new curved 
gaming monitors and gaming accessories, 
Acer Predator has saved the best for last. 
The Predator Orion 9000 takes its name 
after the Hunter in Greek mythology, 
while also sharing the same name 
as the prominent constellation.
The Predator Orion 9000 pushes the 
boundaries of gaming desktops, sporting 
an Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition 18-core 
processor with 32GB DDR4 memory, 512GB 
PCIe SSD and a 3TB 3.1-inch HDD. There 
is also a lower tier model of the Predator 
Orion 9000, which carries the Intel Core i7 
processor with 16GB DDR4 memory, 256GB 
PCIe SSD and a 1TB 3.5-inch HDD.
The i9 Extreme Edition will hold the 
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 11GB 
GDDR5X while the i7 whill carry the GeForce 
GTX 1080 with 8GB GDDR5X.
The i9 Extreme Edition of the 
Predator Orion 9000 retails at RM28,888 
while the i7 model will retail at RM12,999. 
Both models will be made available in 
December at Acer resellers.

After the launch of its first-
ever smartphone, one key 
takeaway from its release was 
the exclusion of a headphone jack. Worry 
not as Razer now has an update to the 
Hammerhead that features a USB Type-C 
connector. This will benefit all smartphones 
without a headphone jack. There is also 
the Hammerhead Mercury that will be 
made exclusively for iOS devices, which 
will drop the usual Razer colourway and 
adopt the familiar Apple aesthetics.
Aside from switching its connectors, 
the Razer Hammerhead’s design remains 
the same as it’s purposely built for 
smartphones. It houses a custom-tuned 
DAC converter alongside 10mm dynamic 
drivers to provide clean, clear and 
uncompressed audio quality.
The earbuds are enclosed in a 
highly durable aluminium chassis while 
remaining lightweight with a flat-style 
cable, promising tangle-free cords. When 
not in use, the earbuds can be magnetically 
clipped together to provide safe keeping.
The Razer Hammerhead USB-C 
is now available at the Razer Store for 
RM449, while the Hammerhead Mercury 
is retailing at RM549.

ESL One Genting qualifiers are coming!
Get Your Game On
ith ESL One Genting just 
mere months away, you now 
have the chance to qualify to 
play alongside the top teams in the world. 
Through ESL Play, you can register your team 
to go through the ESL Open Qualifiers and you 
could just play on the main stage.
ESL Play is open to all six regions, 
mainly Southeast Asia, CIS, Europe, South 
America and North America. There will be a 
limit of 512 teams per region who will fight 
in a best-of-one elimination bracket. As the 
bracket grows smaller, the final round will be a 
best-of-three to determine who will be the top 
four teams to go into the closed qualifiers (we 
are assuming the South and North American 
qualifiers will be in the same bracket).
Once you pass the open qualifiers, 
the top four teams will be grouped with 
eight invited teams, who will be revealed 
before the end of November. These 12 teams 
will clash in a single elimination bracket 
and the top four teams will receive a free 
win in the first round.
