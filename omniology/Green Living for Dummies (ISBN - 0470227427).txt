About the Authors
Yvonne Jeffery is an author, editor, and award-winning feature writer with 
15 years experience writing home and lifestyle stories, many of them focused
on sustainable living. She credits the six months that she spent in Cambodia
prior to that country’s democratic elections in 1993 with giving her a sense of
how the world and its people are interconnected — and how small steps
eventually can make a difference.
Yvonne’s work has appeared in newspapers, magazines, and books around
the world. Her credits include National Geographic Traveler, American Profile,
The Sunday Telegraph (UK), and CanWest newspapers. She’s also a weekly
columnist for the Calgary Herald newspaper.
Liz Barclay has worked as an adviser, trainer, and manager with the Citizens
Advice Bureau, a nonprofit organization in the United Kingdom that provides
free, impartial advice to help individuals resolve legal, financial, consumer,
and other problems. She still advises small businesses and sole proprietors
on relationship management with staff and customers.
Liz is well connected within the media; she hosts You and Yours, a BBC radio
program, and has worked on a wide range of business and finance programs
for the BBC, both on TV and radio. Liz has written for the News Of The World,
The Express, Moneywise, Family Circle, Save Money, and the Mail On Sunday
personal finance magazine and has also written UK Law and Your Rights For
Dummies and Small Business Employment Law For Dummies.
Michael Grosvenor is a leading urban planning professional and freelance
writer on sustainability. Through his work and writing, Michael promotes 
the benefits of making sustainable lifestyle choices. Michael has particular
expertise in transportation and advises the private sector and government
on policies that promote increased public transportation, walking, and
cycling facilities. Michael is a strong advocate for the important role that
public transportation plays in cities and towns.
Michael is the director of his own consulting firm and holds Masters degrees
in Urban Affairs and Applied Social Research and a Degree in Town Planning.
He’s also a member of the Planning Institute of Australia and provides advice
to the Institute on integrated land use and transportation planning issues.
Michael has lived and studied in New York City but currently enjoys an 
inner-city lifestyle in Sydney, Australia.

Dedication
To my aunt and uncle, Wendy and Malcolm Jeffery — thank you so much for
all your love and support.
— Yvonne
To my best friend and partner, Justine — thank you for your encouragement
and support.
— Michael
Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Yvonne: As always, I come to the close of a book project with an
immense amount of gratitude to my family and friends. My deepest thanks 
go to Mum and Dad, for always being there and for setting such a resourceful,
practical, and sustainable example; to my wonderful sister, Lorraine, for 
everything; and to the Jefferys in England, for being a constant source of love
and support.
I’d also like to thank Susan and Stephen Yuzwak, for dinners, conversation, 
and always understanding; my buddies Katharine Fletcher and Laura Byrne
Paquet — I simply couldn’t do it without you — and Dale Dixon, Kerrie Etson,
Judith Mulholland, and Linda Poitevin, for all that you do to add laughter and
compassion to life.
Special appreciation goes to agent extraordinaire, Barb Doyen, for your
incredible support and friendship — may your garden always grow well! —
and to Lisa Monforton, Features and Travel Editor at the Calgary Herald, for
providing such a creative and supportive atmosphere in which to work.
A For Dummies book is very much a team effort on the part of the editorial,
art, and production staff, and I’m grateful to have been part of the excellent
team on this book — thank you all for caring so much about making the book
the best it could possibly be. A special thanks to editors Mike Baker and
Kristin DeMint, for your vision and enthusiasm.
Finally, I’d like to thank all the people who are working so hard around 
the world in so many ways — large and small — to improve the future of the
planet and its inhabitants. May each of us be counted among you in our 
own way.

From Michael: My desire to talk to the general public about sustainable 
living motivated me to write this book. I’m often preaching to the converted
in my consulting work. The environmentalists, planners, architects, social 
scientists, engineers, and geographers I work with find ourselves saying the
same things to each other, and we’re often scribbling messages and ideas on
whiteboards that no one else gets to see.
Writing a book for an audience interested in living sustainably has been very
rewarding. Hence, I am extremely grateful to Lesley Beaumont at Wiley
Publishing Australia for supporting my idea for this book in the first instance
and then giving the go-ahead for its publication.
This book covers a lot of ground — way too much ground for one person to
have the required expertise on every topic. I have been able to carry out 
the necessary research for this book thanks to the thousands of committed
professionals out there who have tested, researched, and published their
findings about the problems facing the planet. This book could not be written
without their passion.
I thoroughly enjoyed working with editor extraordinaire Maryanne Phillips
and thank her for her brilliant guidance and direction. I’d also like to thank
Giovanni Ebono for his excellent editorial contributions and ideas.

Introduction
I
f you’re interested in the environment, want to know a little more about why
so many people are concerned about the future of the planet, or want to
know what you can do to help, Green Living For Dummies is the book for you.
We don’t pretend to know how to save the planet. Even if you put the world’s
leading environmental scientists, researchers, and politicians together in one
room, you’d have a great deal of trouble getting them to agree on exactly
what to do first and how to do it. However, almost everyone agrees on one
thing: that we need to start taking action now in order to stop using the
Earth’s resources faster than the planet can replenish them.
Many people argue for the need to take seriously drastic action, and they’re
partly right. Industries need to stop polluting, governments need to support
clean alternative energy, and communities at every level need to get onboard
with waste reduction. But that doesn’t mean that people should ignore the
very real gains that every single individual can make toward the goal of a
cleaner, greener world.
Just as you can’t expect industries, governments, and communities to change
overnight, you shouldn’t expect to make instant changes yourself. But small
steps, consistently taken, will make a difference. This book shows you how.
About This Book
In general, green living is about leading the kind of lifestyle that does as little
damage as possible to the planet and the living things that call it home. You
can find all kinds of practical suggestions in this book for living green — from
implementing practical ways to use your car less and take fewer flights to
finding locally produced food to using natural cleaning products rather than
those that contain a chemical cocktail.
Green living also means doing as little harm as possible to other people, to
animals, and to the environment. It’s a holistic way of thinking that involves
making choices about what to buy so that you’re as sure as you can be that
animals don’t suffer in order for you to have food, clothes, cosmetics, and
medical treatment, and that people in far-flung parts of the world who pro-
duce the goods you buy are fairly paid and have decent working conditions
and standards of living. This approach is often called sustainable living and
ethical shopping, but for the purposes of this book, we put it all under the
heading of green living.

Scientific understanding about how to be greener is constantly evolving. It’s
not unusual to see media reports one week that contradict similar reports
from the week before. Because it’s often impossible to give definitive answers
about the greenest option in any particular situation, this book aims to make
you think, spark your interest, and get you started down the road to a
greener lifestyle so that you can make informed decisions. The idea is to do
something rather than nothing. Start by making simple changes, and make
bigger changes as and when you can afford to.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book, we use a few style conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms when
they’re defined for the first time — such as green terminology like
carbon neutral.
 Web site addresses appear in a typeface called monofont that makes
them easy to spot. Be aware that if an address wraps to a second line, you
need to type it in as if there were no break — no hyphens are inserted.
 For emphasis and ease of reading, the key words and phrases in bulleted
and numbered lists appear in bold.
What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars are shaded gray boxes containing information that, although inter-
esting, may not be of interest or helpful to every reader. Feel free to skip them
if you want to, but keep in mind that they contain some interesting informa-
tion and problem-solving approaches. Same goes for text marked with a
Technical Stuff icon: If you want just the information you need to live a
greener life, you can safely skip all these passages. But keep in mind that
even if they don’t apply to you now, you may find them relevant in the future.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we made a few assumptions about you, our reader. To
make sure that we’re all on the same page, we assume that any of the follow-
ing statements may be true for you:
 You’re not a scientist, but you’d like to know more about the environ-
ment and the impact that human beings are having on it. You also may
want to know how that impact directly and indirectly affects you.

Green Living For Dummies 

 You’re interested in becoming part of the worldwide effort to relieve the
strain on Earth’s resources.
 You want some practical suggestions about making your own lifestyle
greener, but you’re not expecting to change the world overnight.
 You plan to use the book as a guide rather than a source of definitive
answers.
 You plan to use the contacts and organizations provided in this book to
find out more, to gather information that we didn’t have room to
include, and to keep yourself up-to-date with all the latest green thinking
and initiatives in the future.
How This Book Is Organized
Green Living For Dummies is organized into six parts. The chapters in each
part cover different aspects of green living, from the challenges that the world
is facing to what you can do to help — at home, at school, in the workplace,
and on your travels.
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s
Challenges and Finding Solutions
The first two chapters in this part cover the problems faced by inhabi-
tants of the planet and why scientists think that human beings may be
responsible for damaging not just the visible environment but also the
invisible environment — the climate. It’s now generally accepted in most
of the world that the climate is changing, but even if you’re not convinced,
other issues are too important to ignore. These include the rate at which
people are using the Earth’s resources and the fact that many processes are
contributing harmful chemicals and waste to the air, ground, and water.
Chapter 3 explains that there’s a lot of hope for the future, however, in
processes that don’t produce these harmful substances.
Part II: Living Greenly at Home
Green living starts at home, and this part is all about what you can do at
home to be greener. We focus on changes regarding the way your home is
constructed as well as the ways you use it (Chapters 4 and 5), waste reduc-
tion (Chapter 6), your garden (Chapters 7 and 8), and even raising your kids
(Chapter 9). The big bonus is that being green is often cheaper than not being
green because you focus on using and buying less of most things (including
3
Introduction

electricity and water) and reusing, repairing, and recycling as much as possi-
ble. All these actions have the pleasing side effect of saving you money. You’ll
find that there are lots of ways to green your home that do cost money, but
even these are likely to pay for themselves in the long run. You don’t have to
make the big changes, however. Even the small ones will help.
Part III: Spending and Investing
Your Green(Money)
Although green living is fundamentally about using and buying less of every-
thing, this part of the book recognizes that you can’t stop shopping for items
such as food and clothing completely. You can, however, choose items that
are greener than others. Chapter 10 tackles the issue of food: where it comes
from, why local food is often better, and exactly what organic food is and why
you should care. Chapter 11 does the same thing for clothing. Chapter 12
takes shopping one step further to look at green savings, investments, and
charitable donations. These financial products are often described as ethical
or sustainable because they’re about investing your money in companies or
organizations that support areas that are good for the environment and for
people rather than those that aren’t.
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road
This part looks at greener ways to travel. In Chapter 13, we start with ways to
reduce your use of one of the world’s largest sources of carbon and other pol-
lutants — your vehicle. Options include everything from walking to cycling to
public transit, along with carpooling, car-sharing, and even online shopping.
Chapter 14 lays out your options when you still need a vehicle but want it to
be greener: You can choose from powering your vehicle with biodiesel fuel,
buying a hybrid-electric car, or holding out for a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle.
And for those who just need to get away, Chapter 15 looks at ways to make
your travel more sustainable, especially given that planes contribute a huge
amount of pollutants to the atmosphere. You discover eco-vacations and
adventures and even ways to contribute to making communities around the
world a little better for your visit.
Part V: Creating a Green Society
Green living starts at home, but it doesn’t have to end there. You can be
greener outside the home, too — at work, at school, and in the wider commu-
nity. This part tells you how to spread the word. Just by behaving in a greener
way, you may well inspire other people, but you also can ask for changes to be
made. Chapter 16 offers ideas to help you implement green changes at work,
4
Green Living For Dummies 

and Chapter 17 provides suggestions for getting the whole community involved
in green initiatives, from schools to riverbanks. We provide plenty of sugges-
tions for projects and ways to make them successful.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book contains this part of key information and tips pro-
vided in handy lists of ten. The three chapters in this part each give you ten
great ideas. Chapter 18 provides easy actions that make a difference right
away, Chapter 19 takes it another step further and covers slightly more time-
consuming options that give you a bigger green impact, and Chapter 20 offers
hands-on projects to reuse and recycle items around your home. Finally,
check out the Appendix for a listing of green products, services, and informa-
tion resources that will have you scanning the Internet for hours.
Icons Used in This Book
A quick flip through this book will reveal some small pictures in the margins.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
This book is about practical suggestions that you can adopt to make your
lifestyle greener. The first two chapters give some background about what
many scientists think the problems are, how they’re caused, what impacts
they’re having on the planet, and what’s likely to happen in the long term if
human beings don’t change their behavior. The rest of the book is about what
you can do to change your lifestyle and, in turn, the world around you.
Consider it a book to dip into for ideas when you have the time. You don’t
need to read it from cover to cover. Even if you just read and follow the Cheat
Sheet at the beginning of the book, you’ll be a greener person in no time. If
you want to start recycling, though, Chapter 6 is helpful; if you’re a keen gar-
dener, you may want to start with Chapters 7 and 8; if food is your passion,
consider going straight to Chapter 10; and if you’re booking your summer
vacation, make Chapter 15 your first stop.
We’ve tried to make this book as easy to read as possible and to give you lots
of sources for more information and ideas. We hope you enjoy the book, get
a little bit greener, spread the word, and perhaps follow up on a few of the
leads. They’ll be especially helpful going forward because newer, greener
products, techniques, and technologies are constantly being developed, and
more research is underway to find solutions to the challenges that the world
is facing. Stay tuned, and stay informed.

f you want to keep the planet in good condition so that
future generations can enjoy all the beneﬁts of clean air,
plenty of green space, and good health, there’s no better
time than right now to open your eyes to what’s happening
to the environment, why it’s happening, and what you can
do to change it.
The chapters in this part provide insight into all these
issues, and they also show you what researchers are work-
ing on for the future, namely the cleaner energy that comes
from renewable, sustainable sources. For an overview of
the whole green living kit and caboodle, start here.

Chapter 1
Being Greener for the Good
of People and the Planet
In This Chapter
 Exploring choices and the benefits of change
 Making small changes every day for big, green gains
W
hat, exactly, does green or sustainable living mean? Different people
use different definitions, but it all comes down to one fundamental
concept: The Earth’s resources shouldn’t be depleted faster than they can be
replenished. From that concept comes everything else, including caring for
the environment, animals and other living things, your health, your local
community, and communities around the world.
When you start to look at all the different kinds of resources — from fossil
fuels to forests, agricultural land to wildlife, and the ocean’s depths to the air
that you breathe — it’s easy to see how everything is interconnected and
how the actions that you take today can affect the future. This chapter looks
at the impact your lifestyle has on the Earth’s resources and then summa-
rizes positive steps that you can take to protect and preserve those
resources — starting today.
Understanding the Impact
of Your Choices
Think about the concept of sustainable living as being a lot like your family
budget. If you spend more than you make each month and neglect your bills
as a result, the bill collectors start calling, and if you keep going down the
same path, you end up owing so much that you can’t possibly pay it back. On
the other hand, if you’re careful with your monthly expenses (maybe even
saving a little), you’re able to live within your means and keep everyone
happy, especially you.

The planet’s no different. Right now, its resources are being depleted far
faster than they can be replenished. The call of the bill collectors is getting
louder all the time, with the clear implication that bankruptcy’s down the
road if something doesn’t change. Fossil fuels such as oil are becoming more
difficult and more expensive to bring out of the ground, and their reserves
are dwindling. Burning fossil fuels to provide energy for homes, vehicles, and
industries emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases along with pollu-
tants that affect the health of the planet and its people.
Other resources are in trouble too, including water. In some parts of the
United States, drought conditions are becoming more common and more
widespread. Debates continue about where to find sources of water: to pipe it
in from other areas, to drill into underground aquifers, or even to build
desalination plants to take the salt out of seawater. One possible effect of
global warming is the further reduction of groundwater sources. Decreasing
the demand that people place on water sources is essential in order to con-
tinue having enough water to go around.
Thankfully, it’s not too late to turn the situation around — to make the
changes that the planet and its people need for a safe, healthy, prosperous,
and compassionate future. Changes need to happen quickly, however:
According to the United Nations, some parts of the world are nearing the tip-
ping point, after which the damage will be irreparable.
A useful way to understand your impact on the environment is to measure
your ecological footprint, which is the land needed to support your consump-
tion of goods and resources. Think of it as a way of describing the amount of
land required to farm your food, mine your energy sources, transport your
goods and services, and hold your waste. You make decisions every day that
have an impact on the planet: choosing between the car and local rapid tran-
sit, for example, or selecting local or organic fresh food instead of packaged,
processed food that has been transported long distances. Think about the
impact that each individual decision has, and weigh the pros and cons of
your everyday actions.
Carbon emissions are another measure of your ecological footprint. We have
more about how carbon and other gases contribute to climate change in
Chapter 2; for now, it’s enough to know that carbon is released when many
substances — particularly fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal — are burned
by vehicles and planes; by the manufacturing processes of many consumer
goods; and by the heating, cooling, and electricity for your home.
The Earth Day Network, a network of environmental organizations and pro-
jects, estimates that there are 4.5 biologically productive acres worldwide
per person. The average American’s ecological footprint, however, is 24
acres, which means that a lot of people are using more resources than the
planet can afford.
10
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

You can measure your own ecological footprint simply by visiting the Earth
Day Network Web site at www.earthday.net and entering some information
about your lifestyle. You’re asked questions about
 The size and type of your home
 How often you eat meat and processed foods
 How many miles you drive or take public transportation each week
 How energy efficient your home and vehicle are
 How much waste you generate
If you’re only just starting a greener lifestyle, reducing your ecological foot-
print may seem a little daunting. You can reduce it significantly, though, and
it won’t take long. Use the questions from the Earth Day Network to think
about where you’d like to start reducing your impact.
Recognizing the Rewards of a
Sustainable Lifestyle
As you begin to make your life greener, you’ll see benefits well beyond the
immediate green ones such as reducing carbon emissions, reducing waste,
and supporting the local economy. You’ll discover that being green can
improve your life in all kinds of areas.
Here are just a few of the major benefits of a sustainable lifestyle:
 Saving money: Consuming less of any commodity — from electricity to
water to clothes — means that you pay less, too. You’ll discover lower
utility bills and a budget with breathing room when you take actions
such as buying quality items that last a long time and even growing
some of your own food.
 Encouraging profits: When you support green and ethical businesses
such as stores and financial institutions, you help them to stay prof-
itable enough to continue acting in environmentally and socially respon-
sible ways. You also send a message to less responsible companies that
they need to clean up their acts.
 Boosting health: Following the tips in this book about walking and cycling
instead of driving and about reducing the amount of chemicals in your
food, your home, and your garden can leave you with an improved cardio-
vascular and immune system, stronger muscles, and cleaner lungs.
11
Chapter 1: Being Greener for the Good of People and the Planet

 Leaving a legacy: The opportunity to protect what’s vital about the
planet for future generations is perhaps the most important benefit of all.
If you consume only what you need, reduce your trash, live more natu-
rally, and invest carefully, you do a great deal to leave a planet that will
benefit people and wildlife for centuries to come.
Changing What You Can as You Can
Although you can’t change the world and save the planet single-handedly
overnight, you can make a difference — and you can start right away with
whatever budget and time you have available. Buying a hybrid-electric
vehicle in order to reduce fossil fuel consumption and emissions is an
excellent strategy, but few people can afford to go out and buy a new car
tomorrow (not to mention the implications of getting rid of your old one
before its time). You have tons of options that are both easy and affordable,
however.
The best strategy is to take change one step at a time and implement small
changes when and as you can. Also assess where you’re starting from (calcu-
lating your ecological footprint is one way to measure this; see the earlier
section “Understanding the Impact of Your Choices”) and figure out what you
can do to counter your effect through carbon offsetting if you can’t yet make
the changes you want to make.
Adopting the four primary green strategies
Here are four green living strategies (which you’ll encounter throughout this
book) that you can implement in a variety of ways to contribute to the solu-
tions that the planet needs:
 Reduce consumption. Anything that you do to decrease the amount of
the Earth’s resources that you use — from choosing goods with less
packaging to turning down your home’s thermostat a few degrees in the
winter — helps you to lead a more sustainable life.
 Choose carefully. Assessing where certain products and services come
from by thinking about their entire life cycles from manufacture to dis-
posal helps you to make the greenest choices possible. You not only
protect the environment but also protect the people involved in the
manufacturing process.
12
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

 Opt for renewable resources. Replacing your use of nonrenewable
resources (such as energy based on fossil fuels) with renewable resources
(such as solar or wind energy) is a very powerful green action — and it
may be easier than you think.
 Repair when needed. There are plenty of ways that you can help to fix
the damage that’s already been done to the environment, from support-
ing tree-planting projects to helping out with community programs at
home and around the world.
Taking those first small steps
Making small changes as and when you can puts you firmly on the road to
living a much greener lifestyle. Trying to jump into it all at once can be counter-
productive, in fact, because the subject area is immense and is growing all the
time. Instead, decide what your priorities are: Think about where it would be
easiest for you to begin. Start there, and work up to the bigger or more difficult
issues.
Your priorities may not be the same as other people’s, but that’s okay:
They’re yours, and you’re entitled to them. Be prepared to adjust them as
new information becomes available, however. Research is ongoing in most
areas of green living, so arguments will change. In the meantime, take one
small step every time you’re ready to, and keep aspiring to be greener.
You can find quick and easy green actions listed on the Cheat Sheet at the
front of this book and also in Chapter 18. We chose them specifically because
they make you significantly greener with minimal effort. Examples include
replacing your light bulbs as they burn out with compact fluorescent models
and replacing your cleaning supplies as they run out with environmentally
friendly ones.
Another tip that’s super-easy to implement is to buy items with less packag-
ing. Consider, for example, what would happen if you bought toilet paper in
double rolls, which contain twice as much toilet paper in a roll than regular-
size rolls. That cuts down the number of cardboard tubes inside the rolls by
half, and it also decreases the amount of plastic that’s used to wrap the pack-
ages! If you recycle the cardboard tubes that remain, even better. And if you
slit the plastic wrap open only at the top of the package, you can reuse the
wrap, perhaps as a trash bag. See how easy that was?
As you read through this book, jot down a list of actions that you could see
yourself taking fairly easily. When you have a list, it’s easier to prioritize the
tasks so that you don’t feel you need to tackle them all at once.
13
Chapter 1: Being Greener for the Good of People and the Planet

Turning Green Choices into 
Habits around Your Home
Reducing, reusing, repairing, and recycling are the four most important
actions when it comes to adopting a greener lifestyle because they all con-
tribute to conserving the Earth’s resources. Tips throughout this book help
you reduce your consumption of everything from packaged goods to energy.
Your home is one of the best places to start making green living changes
because you have the control to make the choices that are best for you.
Chapter 4 looks at the green issues that you can consider when you’re moving
into a new home or building or renovating one, and Chapter 5 addresses the
habits that you can adopt for a greener lifestyle within the home.
Along with energy efficiency, water conservation is a major issue, and it’s
where you can really make a difference. Between the source and your faucet,
water has to be pumped at various stages, and that takes energy, as does the
process of treating the water. If you conserve water, you do double-duty by
conserving both water and energy, and that helps to reduce the amount of
carbon emissions pumped into the atmosphere.
Most of the water used in homes — whether it’s for flushing, washing, clean-
ing, or drinking — is processed to the point of being high-quality drinking
water. Although systems do exist to divert greywater (water that’s been used
in sinks, for example, for hand or dishwashing) to toilets for flushing, they’re
not yet a common feature of home building and renovations. However, you
can make a difference by preventing as much good-quality water as possible
from running down the drain into the sewers from where it has to be
reprocessed back into drinking-quality water.
When it comes to waste, reduce what you buy as much as possible — includ-
ing choosing the least amount of packaging possible — as this will naturally
reduce the waste you generate. Then assess your waste to see what can be
reused or recycled — what’s waste to you may be useful to your friends and
neighbors or to a nonprofit group (see Chapter 6).
Of course, your home extends to your yard, as well. Chapters 7 and 8
describe what a green yard looks like (Hint: it doesn’t have to have grass to
be green!) and provide tips on taking your yard off chemicals and growing
your own organic food with the help of composting.
14
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

When you introduce green living at home, everyone can be involved. Children
learn from adults and then pass the word on to their friends, who pass it on
to their parents. Give everyone an age-appropriate role to play by putting
them in charge of some aspect of your greener household. You can find more
about raising green children in Chapter 9.
Making Your Greenbacks Even Greener
When it comes to spending and saving money, your dollars can go a long way
toward greening your lifestyle. Start with the necessities of life — choosing
what you eat and what you wear — and assess how you can do both in ways
that are both socially and environmentally responsible. Then expand these
issues to the banking arena, looking at where you can park your money and
how you can invest your savings to help you as well as your community
and the planet.
Shopping greenly and ethically
Shopping is a great opportunity to make your lifestyle more sustainable.
Choose the greenest options available to you, such as food produced using
as few chemicals as possible, grown locally in season, and transported over
as short a distance as possible to reduce the amount of fuel used. Other
green options include clothes made from organically produced materials,
goods made from recycled materials rather than resources that have to be
mined from the earth, secondhand or vintage goods, and those made from
biodegradable materials.
Ethical issues, including how the people and animals involved in the produc-
tion processes were treated, are also important to consider. Ask stores
whether the workers, producers, suppliers, and farmers involved in the pro-
duction chain are paid fairly, have good working conditions, and can sustain
their production (meaning that they have enough left after feeding them-
selves and their families to maintain their premises or buy new equipment
and seeds). Avoiding goods produced using child labor or in sweatshop
working conditions also may be a priority for you. Animal welfare is a grow-
ing concern as well; consider choosing meat and dairy products that come
from animals raised in humane conditions rather than intensively farmed,
overcrowded pens and cages.
15
Chapter 1: Being Greener for the Good of People and the Planet

Support your local community socially and economically by buying your
food, gifts, crafts, home items, and clothes from local producers and busi-
nesses. If that’s not possible, look for Fairtrade-certified products that assure
you that growers and producers were treated fairly.
You can find out more about both green and ethical issues when it comes to
shopping for food and clothing in Chapters 10 and 11.
Saving, investing, and donating wisely
When it comes to saving or investing your money, you can make it work for
both you and the environment by choosing where you bank. An increasing
number of financial institutions offer savings accounts or entire suites of
investment services that support green, sustainable, and socially responsible
programs, often in your own community. Even better, some financial institu-
tions offer these accounts but also conduct their day-to-day operations in a
socially and environmentally responsible way.
The kinds of financial programs that these institutions offer may include
using the money in savings and investment accounts to leverage low-interest
loans to help local businesses improve their energy efficiency or to build
alternative energy infrastructure such as solar or wind power. Programs also
may help nonprofit organizations set up work or self-employment training
programs or affordable housing initiatives.
When it comes to long-term investments such as mutual funds or the stock
market, you can go green there too by opting for an ethical or green fund that
invests in companies that meet various environmental or social criteria or by
investing directly in the companies themselves. Some green-minded invest-
ment accounts ask you to accept a lower interest rate on your savings in
exchange for these positive effects, but for others, you have the opportunity
for just as much of a return as you would get if your money were in conven-
tional accounts or investments.
Of course, you also can put your money where it provides an investment for
charitable organizations instead of yourself. There’s a vast array of causes
out there that you can support, so it pays to do your research before you
part with your money in order to make sure that it will be used wisely.
You can find more information about socially responsible investments and
charitable donations in Chapter 12.

Venturing Out into the World
The greenest thing you can possibly do when it comes to traveling and trans-
portation is simply not to go — vacation locally instead of halfway around
the world, for example, or work from home instead of commuting. That’s not
always possible, practical, or even desirable, however, so this section looks
at ways to get on the road while minimizing your impact on the environment,
particularly your greenhouse gas emissions. From using public transporta-
tion for your commute to opting for greener vehicles and ecologically friendly
holidays, it’s all here.
Getting around
Transportation, particularly passenger vehicles and planes, emit a tremen-
dous amount of carbon and other pollutants into the atmosphere, where they
contribute to climate change and a range of health problems (see Chapter 2).
Although researchers have found ways to improve fuel efficiency, power vehi-
cles with organically based fuels instead of petroleum-based fuels, and use
different technology to power the vehicle, much of this work is still at an
early stage of adoption.
As a consumer, you can make a difference by reducing the amount that you
fly or drive. Vacation locally, for example, or work from home one day a week
if possible. When you have to travel, choose more-sustainable methods of
transportation, including local bus, rapid transit, and train services. These
methods of transportation still emit pollutants, but because they carry more
people at one time, their emissions per person are much lower than if the
passengers were all in their own cars.
Chapter 13 provides practical information about how to start decreasing
your car use and boost other modes of transportation, including cycling and
walking. Chapter 14 offers a look at the exciting technology that’s available
(or on its way) to power vehicles differently, including the pros and cons of
some alternative fuels.
Traveling mindfully
Before you book your next vacation, consider where you want to go in the
world and why, and think about whether you can achieve the same effect
closer to home (to cut down on your greenhouse gas emissions) or in a more
ecologically friendly way (like by taking the train instead of flying).
17
Chapter 1: Being Greener for the Good of People and the Planet

There are still good, valid reasons to travel widely, though — including that it
can broaden your horizons and facilitate better understanding between cul-
tures. So consider taking fewer long-distance vacations and making them last
longer in order to get the best possible investment from the greenhouse gas
emissions that your travel is responsible for. Consider the location to which
you’re traveling, too; keep in mind that you’ll be a guest in that country, and try
to follow the people’s standards for dress and behavior to avoid giving offense.
To take your vacation deeper into environmental or social responsibility, con-
sider an ecotourism trip that provides insight into the local ecosystem
(including fauna and flora) or a volunteer vacation in which you spend part
or much of your time on a project that helps either the local people or the
environment.
You can help to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions that your
travel produces by considering ways to become carbon neutral — this means
that you reduce your carbon emissions as much as possible and balance the
remaining carbon emissions by offsetting them with processes that consume
carbon. Carbon offsetting refers to paying for or participating in programs that
reduce the carbon in the atmosphere. Many of those programs involve plant-
ing trees; others, however, fund research into alternative or cleaner conven-
tional technologies. Planting trees or other vegetation is the most common
carbon offsetting measure; when plants grow, they take in carbon dioxide,
removing it from the atmosphere.
It’s essential to reduce the amount of carbon emissions that you produce, but
it’s not always easy. You may not be able to control whether your local power
plant runs on coal or solar energy, for example (although you can certainly
advocate for solar energy and make your home as energy efficient as possi-
ble). That’s why carbon offsetting has become so popular recently.
Carbon offsetting isn’t the silver bullet answer to the problem of carbon emis-
sions because it often doesn’t address the underlying problem. Tree planting,
for example, only deals with the existing carbon; it doesn’t reduce the pro-
duction of it, which is where the real emphasis needs to be. However, pur-
chasing offsets helps if you’re careful about the programs you support, and
we tell you how to do so in Chapter 15.
Building a Green Society
You can have a powerful effect on the people and systems around you by
encouraging a greener society. Some of this influence simply comes from lead-
ing by example (perhaps by taking your lunch to work in reusable instead of
disposable containers), but you also can go further by advocating for positive,
constructive changes at work, in your local community, and even around the
world.

Being environmentally sound at work
All the measures you put in place at home — energy-efficient appliances and
equipment, water-saving and energy conservation devices and strategies,
recycling and reusing programs — can translate very effectively to the work-
place. Many employers already take action to improve their environmental
and social responsibilities. You can encourage this wherever it’s happening
and ask for change where it’s not. Chapter 16 offers strategies to help you.
Many businesses that don’t embrace green practices simply for their environ-
mental benefits will go green if it saves them money. If you explain how the
company can reduce energy, paper, and transportation expenses by employ-
ing green tips and techniques, you may achieve the goal you’re aiming for.
Setting up community projects that work
Look around your community and you’re likely to find plenty of ways to get
involved with improving both environmental and social concerns. From
cleaning up riverbanks to redesigning neighborhoods, the list of projects is
virtually endless. If there’s something missing, though, seize the opportunity
to gather support in the community and set up a project to fill the gap. Find
ideas for projects, along with advice about setting them up for success, in
Chapter 17.

Challenges
In This Chapter

 Fixing the problem — globally speaking
I
t’s difficult to open up a newspaper or listen to the evening news these
days without hearing about retreating glaciers, shrinking Arctic ice, and
increasingly devastating natural disasters. In recent years, mounting scientific
evidence has shown that the world’s climate is warming and that the world’s
growing population and industrialization is contributing to the change.
The underlying issues that frame all this public concern, though, aren’t always so
clear. And in a society where warnings and alerts are a regular occurrence, it’s
easy for many folks to dismiss the alarm as overdramatized political propaganda.
Unfortunately, the effects of climate change, along with equally important
environmental issues such as pollution and ecological damage, are real and
do affect the way humans live in the here and now — not to mention the toll
that they promise to take on future generations. The good news is that
people and governments throughout the world are beginning to focus not
just on the problems but on solutions that everyone can play a part in.
In this chapter, we reduce the mountain of environmental concerns to an easily
scalable hill, putting the biggest concerns into context so you can see what
they are, how they directly (and indirectly) affect your life, and how you can
help reverse the trend and change the future.

Investigating Human Impact: Two
Concerns, One Combined Effect
Climate change is a huge issue in the world today, but it accounts for only
part of all the damage being done to the environment — damage that will dra-
matically change the way that the earth is able to provide for the needs of its
residents in the future. We’re not saying that the world will end if its inhabi-
tants don’t act to solve the environment’s problems, but issues such as the
availability of clean air, food, and water sources do have a strong impact on
the health and well-being of everyone on the planet.
In fact, we’d argue that climate change (which we focus on later in this chapter)
isn’t actually the problem — in reality, it’s a symptom, or product, of two far
more important problems:
 The amount of the earth’s natural resources that humans consume in
order to live, especially in advancing economies
 The waste that spills over into the earth’s land and atmosphere as a
result of that consumption
The issue now facing the environment is that when you put those two prob-
lems together over an extended period of time, they have a domino effect:
They contribute to issues such as the earth’s climate change (also known as
global warming) and regional food and water shortages, which in turn have
their own environmental impacts. The equation is simple: The planet is strug-
gling to support its population because people are consuming resources
faster than the earth can provide them and are damaging the earth more
quickly than it can regenerate itself.
Fortunately, though, humanity — and each individual — is capable of moving
the earth to a healthier place for all by taking small steps every day. We pre-
view the can-do info later in this chapter, but we begin by showing you why
these two concerns have drawn so much attention across communities as
well as governments worldwide.
Overconsumption: Mother Nature and 
the law of supply and demand
It’s natural for human beings to aspire to more technologically advanced,
convenient lifestyles — the payoff for lots of hard work. Unfortunately, the
laws of Mother Nature say that all things come at a cost; in the case of material
goods, that cost is in the form of the earth’s resources. These include not
22
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

only the resources used to produce fossil fuels and, therefore, energy, but
also resources such as water and the land that produces food.
Looking at overconsumption around the globe
According to the Global Footprint Network (www.footprintnetwork.org),
the world’s population now requires 1.3 planets to support itself. Considering
that the earth’s inhabitants have only one planet to work with, this excessive
demand indicates a serious problem with the amount that people are
consuming annually. For example
 The Network reports that approximately 75 percent of oceanic fisheries —
including cod — have been heavily overfished to the point where 
governments have had to restrict catch quotas in an attempt to give 
the fish populations time to recover.
 The Network also reports that agricultural practices in the United States
are removing topsoil — the richest, most productive part of the soil —
more than 18 times faster than it can be replenished.
 Water is another key resource that’s stretched to its limit in many areas
of the world — in fact, some politicians and scientists believe that future
conflicts between countries may be based on competition for water
rather than competition for energy (see the section “Decreased food and
water supply” later in this chapter).
The U.S. in particular shoulders a significant amount of the world’s over-
consumption of its resources. In 2006, the Center for Environment and
Population (CEP) (www.cepnet.org) reported the following figures:
 The U.S. has approximately 5 percent of the world’s population and uses 25
percent of the world’s natural resources.
 The U.S. uses three times as much water per person than the world average.
 The U.S. uses almost 25 percent of the world’s energy.
 The U.S. is the world’s largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from
fossil fuels, with almost 25 percent of all global emissions. (Carbon dioxide
is one of the major greenhouse gases linked to climate change.)
Sure, these numbers are startling, and they show a real need for action in the
U.S. Be very careful, though, about assuming that the advancing economies are
solely to blame. Although the developing world may not consume as much per
capita as industrialized economies, the local environmental effects from garbage
and unlegislated greenhouse gas emissions are just as much of an issue — such
as when the rain releases the odor of human waste from the earth (not kidding).
Yes, the Western world has a huge responsibility in terms of leading the way to
finding and implementing solutions, but it isn’t the only source of the problem.

Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

A bird’s-eye view of nonrenewable fuel usage
The vast majority of the energy that people use to heat and power homes and
businesses, fuel vehicles, and manufacture home furnishings and all other
material goods comes from nonrenewable sources called fossil fuels, which
are energy-rich organic substances traced back to the remains of organisms
that lived 300 to 400 million years ago. Often found under the sea bed, fossil
fuels include oil, coal, and natural gas, and they consist primarily of carbon
and hydrogen. Today, these substances are extracted from the earth’s crust
and are mostly refined into suitable fuel products such as gas, propane, heat-
ing oil, and kerosene.
Uranium, the other nonrenewable energy source, is used in nuclear power
plants that can produce very few emissions — but those plants have their
own environmental issues in terms of radioactive waste.
All the nonrenewable fuels can be considered “dirty” because of their potential
for environmental damage and because they’ll eventually run out (at differing
rates).
Fossil fuels currently provide 85 percent of the energy needs of the United States.
They’re also responsible for the lion’s share of greenhouse gas emissions such
as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, and they contribute to
particles that can cause acid rain.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), every year the world is using
some 31 billion barrels of oil, 6.5 billion short tons of coal, and 106 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas — and those figures are increasing annually.
These statistics show that the developed world, including the U.S. and other
high-income countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom, is using more
than its fair share of the world’s resources, with the developing world catching
up quickly (you can find more info on the comparison in the preceding section).

Ecological Debt Day: Not your average holiday!
The Global Footprint Network has created a cal-
culation that helps to illustrate very clearly the
problem with overconsumption: They call it the
world’s Ecological Debt Day. This is the day
each year on which people start to live beyond
the planet’s means — and it’s getting earlier
every year. In 1987, for example, it occurred on
December 19. In 2007, it occurred on October 6.
That means that between January 1 and
October 6, 2007, the human population used up
all the resources that the earth could replenish
within one year. In effect, it also means that
from October 6 to December 31, 2007, we were
“borrowing” resources from the future. Just like
in a household budget, if people continue to
borrow from the future without replenishing the
savings, eventually the population will run out
of resources completely.

That’s why it’s so important to reconsider just what’s being consumed as well
as how much, from individuals right through to the top levels of government.
Looking closely at each nonrenewable energy source
Nonrenewable fuels have helped power the growth of modern society, espe-
cially by providing the ability to industrialize and to transport people and
materials from one place to another. However, fossil fuels — including oil,
coal, and natural gas — and uranium don’t exist in infinite quantities and
can’t be easily replenished. It took a long time to create them, and humans
are using them up far faster than the earth can produce them.
 Oil: Oil is overwhelmingly the fuel of choice in vehicles right now, and
many scientists agree that there may be only 40 to 50 years’ worth of oil
left if it continues to be used at current, increasing, rates. Scientists are
divided on the issue, but even some oil companies agree with them.
That’s not the only supply-related issue, however — there’s also the
problem of accessing the oil.
In the U.S., oil contributes more than 40 percent of all the energy that the
nation uses. More than a simple energy source, however, oil and other
petroleum-based products are also sources of political power and
controversy. A major task of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of
Fossil Energy is making sure that oil supplies aren’t disrupted because
they’re so crucial to the continued smooth running of the country. For
that reason, oil is stockpiled in key locations in the U.S. in case crucial
supplies are cut off. However, many oil supplies that are relatively easy
and inexpensive to get at are running out, leaving oil companies and the
government to try to figure out how to remove the rest without bumping
the price of oil up so high that it devastates the economy.
 Coal: More than half of America’s electricity-generating plants burn coal,
which has traditionally earned a very dirty reputation. When burned,
coal not only produces carbon dioxide but also sulfur and nitrogen
byproducts that can cause smog and acid rain. The process of mining
coal also costs the environment, whether it’s underground or on the
surface, and poses considerable risk to the health and safety of miners.
Although coal is a nonrenewable resource, reserves in the U.S. likely can
handle the nation’s energy needs for the next 200 to 300 years, which
provides enough time to figure out how to replace it. What’s more 
important in the short term is figuring out how to burn coal without
producing environmentally harmful gases.
According to the DOE, the U.S. has one quarter of the world’s coal reserves,
and that one quarter contains more energy than that of the entire world’s
recoverable oil reserves. Coal is a huge source of potential energy for the
nation, which is why it’s so important to find and implement ways to burn
it more cleanly.
25
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

 Uranium: Nearly 20 percent of the total electricity generated in the U.S.
comes from nuclear energy, making it second only to coal as an energy
source for producing power. Nuclear energy works by harnessing the
energy released when a uranium atom splits apart; fossil fuels aren’t
burned, so there’s no greenhouse gas emissions. The process of uranium
enrichment, however, which is required to turn the heavy metal into usable
fuel, does release carbon dioxide. In addition, the question lingers of what
to do with the spent uranium, which is radioactive and highly carcinogenic.
Nuclear waste currently is sealed and stored, and there are plans to con-
struct a large underground facility to which waste can be transported
and then stored indefinitely. Research is also underway to find ways to
use the energy that may be left in the used fuel, but there’s no doubt
that the question of nuclear waste and the small but real risk of some
kind of accident or even sabotage at a nuclear reactor means that
nuclear energy isn’t a green solution.
In an ultimate act of recycling, the Megatons to Megawatts program
processes weapons-grade uranium from Soviet warheads into uranium
that can be used by nuclear plants in the U.S.
 Natural gas: According to the DOE, approximately 22 percent of the
nation’s energy consumption comes from natural gas, and more than
half of the nation’s homes use natural gas as their main heating fuel.
When natural gas burns, it releases far fewer greenhouse gas emissions
than coal does. Natural gas is also considered a cleaner-burning fuel
than oil, which is one of the reasons why 900 of the next 1,000 power
plants built in the U.S. will run on natural gas.
Although natural gas is cleaner burning than coal and oil, it still releases
carbon dioxide when it burns. Gas still has its issues, among them the
release of its main ingredient (the greenhouse gas methane) during
production, storage, and transportation, and the potential for natural
gas to explode when high concentrations come into contact with a spark.
Pollution: Poisoning the world 
from the outside in
One of the great examples of how humanity directly impacts the planet (and
indirectly affects itself) is waste, whether it comes from a factory smokestack
or is consigned to a landfill or incinerator, because of its potential to pollute
the atmosphere, the land, and the water. It may be “out of sight, out of mind,”
but waste and its associated pollution still have an impact on the environment.
26
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

The burning of fossil fuels is perhaps the greatest contributor to pollution,
yet it’s currently the primary means for generating and transporting energy.
Electrical energy, for example, is one of the most popular forms of energy
supplied around the world. The cheapest and most reliable way of providing
electricity to cities and towns involves power generation plants that burn
fossil fuels such as coal. The energy required for transporting the coal to the
plant comes from refining oil — also a fossil fuel.
Ultimately, the burning of fossil fuels causes much of the greenhouse gas
problem that contributes to climate change. We discuss greenhouse gas at
length in the next section, but essentially, it’s tied to the burning of fossil fuels.
When fossil fuels are burned, sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon combine with oxygen
to form compounds known as oxides. These, in turn, form gases that contribute
to numerous environmental problems, including climate change (see the section
“Seeing How the Earth Reacts to Trauma: Climate Change”), particle pollution
(see the section “In the air”), and acid rain. (Acid rain occurs when fossil fuel-
burning produces sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which then create a mild
acidic solution that falls in rain or as dry particles; in these forms, it has been
linked to damaging effects on waterways and forests.)
Although many waste materials, products, and packaging can find space in
landfill sites or incinerators, their components have to be dealt with to avoid
emitting potentially toxic chemicals back into the land and the air. True, new
landfills are carefully sealed so that their contents don’t leak, and incinerators
use much cleaner technology than they once did. But all this requires energy,
which is exactly what the people of the world should consume less of.
In developing countries, the waste issue is focused more on a lack of infra-
structure and facilities, meaning that garbage may be dumped in any spare
piece of land or in landfill sites that fail to protect the environment, or it may
be burned without consideration for either nearby residents or the environment.
This pollution compounds health and sanitation issues because it risks cont-
aminating the ground, local water sources, and the air.
The U.S. produces the largest amount of waste per person in the world at 5
pounds of garbage daily. According to the Center for Environment and
Population’s U.S. National Report on Population and the Environment, that’s
up from less than 3 pounds daily in 1960, and it’s five times the average per
person in developing countries!
27
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

Seeing How the Earth Reacts 
to Trauma: Climate Change
Scientists know that changes in the concentrations of various gases in the
atmosphere have the power to change the planet’s climate — and that those
concentrations are currently increasing. According to the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the amounts of carbon
dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the earth’s atmosphere have increased
significantly since the preindustrial days of 1750. When scientists compared
present atmospheric gas concentrations to even older records by examining
ancient ice, they found that carbon dioxide levels in 2005 far exceeded the
natural range of the gas over the last 650,000 years. Even more important, the
rate at which carbon dioxide is increasing was larger over the past decade
than it was over the past 45 years.
The increased carbon dioxide comes from fossil fuel use and land-use change
(when native forests, for example, are turned into agricultural land), whereas
the increased methane and nitrous oxide come from agricultural practices.
The result of these increases is a contribution to global warming, which
28

Addressing concerns about coal
In the 1970s, acid rain moved front and center as
an environmental issue. The good news is that
since then both government and industry have
invested billions of dollars in cleaning up coal.
Several techniques are now used to remove
harmful substances from coal and its emissions,
including the following:
 Washing coal: When done before burning,
washing the coal removes some of the
sulfur content.
 Smokestack scrubbers: These technolo-
gies remove much of the sulfur and nitrogen
oxides from the gases produced by burning
coal.
 Low-NOx burners: This technology burns
the coal in stages in fuel-rich environments
in order to avoid producing nitrogen oxides in
the first place.
 Fluidized bed boilers: These boilers burn
coal in the presence of limestone to capture
sulfur and at a cooler temperature to avoid
forming nitrogen oxides.
A new technique know as gasifying coal, or turn-
ing it into a gas rather than burning it, is proving
successful in removing substances such as
sulfur and nitrogen. An electricity-generating
plant that uses this technology can use the
carbon monoxide and hydrogen that result
instead to create various spin-off products while
emitting almost no pollution into the atmosphere.
Coal-fired electricity-generating plants near
Tampa, Florida, and West Terre Haute, Indiana,
employ this gasification technology.

essentially means that gases trap warmth in the earth’s atmosphere instead
of letting the atmosphere release it. Global warming, in turn, throws the
earth’s balanced, highly sensitive ecosystem off-kilter.
Climate change has been a hot topic of debate scientifically and politically for
some time. The discussion isn’t so much centered on whether climate is
changing — science shows that it is — but on the extent to which human
activities are causing it, whether it will cause problems in the future, and
what, if anything, can be done to stop and even reverse those changes.
Understanding how global warming works
When the sun’s rays hit the earth, some of their energy (about 30 percent) is
reflected back into space by surfaces such as clouds, ice, and snow cover.
The rest stays around, warming the oceans and continents, which eventually
release the heat back out into the atmosphere and from there into space.
With global warming, however, there’s a roadblock in the atmosphere in the
form of gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, which
absorb some of the heat and reflect it back toward the earth instead of letting
it get through to space. The more gases in the atmosphere, the more heat is
retained on earth. Figure 2-1 shows the process involved in global warming.
What happens with global warming is very similar to what happens in a
greenhouse, in which the sun’s rays heat the interior while the glass walls and
roof prevent that heat from fully escaping. That’s why global warming is also
known as the greenhouse effect and the gases involved are called greenhouse
gases.
Global warming isn’t just about raising the temperature of the land and the sea
and making the days and nights warmer. It’s about what happens when those
temperatures rise. For example, rising sea temperatures release more water
vapor into the air above the ocean. When hurricanes form, they pick up this
increased vapor, which creates a more intense storm. In some northern areas,
rising temperatures actually may cause a cooling effect because melting snow
and ice cool the sea water that currently offers a moderating effect on those
areas. Global warming also means that arid areas can expect to be drier for
longer periods each year and that other areas may become drier.
29
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

Recognizing how global warming 
has already affected the world
In 2007, the UN’s IPCC adopted a report based on an expert review of scientific
evidence from around the world. The authors came up with four conclusions,
all related:
 That both air temperature and sea levels have increased over the past
century at a higher rate than historically seen
 That the warmth of the last half-century is unusual in the context of the
past 1,300 years (at least)
 That it’s very likely that increased greenhouse gases have caused this
change
 That it’s virtually certain that the warming will continue unless something
is done to stop it

You probably know from watching the news or reading the newspaper that
countries around the world are facing serious problems due in part to climate
change. Here are the primary effects of global warming that have led to the
environmental and economic instability:
 Drought conditions: The amount of land affected by drought worldwide
has doubled in the last 30 years. The two primary causes of drought are
as follows:
• Dried-up water sources: It’s no secret that starvation is a part of
everyday life in many countries across the continent of Africa.
Many inland lakes and rivers that provide much of the fish there
are almost dried up. In the U.S., both Arizona and California contin-
ually experience significant water shortages.
• Dramatically reduced rainfall (in some areas): Reduced rainfall
makes the land drier than normal, which opens the door to brush-
fires that may start small and quickly grow out of control. In Australia
and the South Pacific, nearly every year serious brushfire threats are
issued around several of the major cities and towns due to a drop in
rainfall. California and Oregon also continue to see an increase in
31

Two hundred years of increasing 
prosperity and pollution
The following timeline shows the progress of
world pollution:
 1800–1860 — Manufacture by machine:
New engineering techniques lead to the
advent of more-modern machinery and fac-
tories. Steam power and railways increase
the size of urban areas.
 1830–1900 — Growth of the industrial town:
Cities grow remarkably due to increases in
manufacturing and related employment
opportunities. Housing and social problems
evolve, as do the first serious environmen-
tal problems.
 1870–1914 — Second Industrial Revolution:
The advent of electricity and medicine cre-
ates a new wave of industry.
 1914–1930 — World War I: The war drains
global resources, but the era of mass pro-
duction helps the world recuperate.
 1930–1968 — Modernism: World War II and
its advancements in weaponry are followed
by nuclear power, space exploration, and a
better understanding of DNA and the struc-
ture of life. The postwar period is charac-
terized by rapid urban expansion, and
consumption increases.
 1960–2000 — The age of ambivalence: The
impact of unchecked consumption leads to
the birth of the environmental movement.
The advent of computers enhances the
amount and distribution of information.

brushfires. Drier conditions also are affecting the Amazon rainforest,
which is home to diverse species of frogs, mammals, and an enor-
mous range of plant life that we’re beginning to realize can con-
tribute to the number of medicines at our disposal; it’s in trouble
because of urban and agricultural encroachment as well as dry
weather caused by global warming.
 Increased flooding: Large proportions of low-lying land in Bangladesh
and India are becoming more susceptible to flooding due to rising sea
levels, the increasing intensity of rainfall, and the lowering of the water
table due to over-irrigation. In Bangladesh, major floods force millions of
people out of their homes each year. The following causes of increased
flooding affect other countries as well:
• Rising sea levels: Rising sea levels threaten to submerge many
Pacific islands. It’s possible that the islands Kiribati, Tuvalu, and
the atolls that form the Marshall Islands may join the queue of
those that are already disappearing, such as Tebua, Tarawa, and
Abanuea.
• Unusually heavy rainfall: Some floods in Europe have been caused
by unusually heavy rainfall; an example is the flood that swept
through Prague in 2002.
• Rapid melting of snow: Annual flooding is now the norm in many
parts of Europe due in part to the rapid melting of snow in Alpine
regions when the warmer temperatures arrive.

Stats about global warming
Statistics from the IPCC’s Summary for
Policymakers of its Working Group I Fourth
Assessment Report (2007) show the extent of
the problem that is global warming. Here are the
most striking statistics:
 The average global surface temperature
increased by approximately 1.33 degrees
Fahrenheit (0.76 degrees Celsius) between
1905 and 2005.
 The warming trend over the last 50 years is
nearly twice that for the last 100 years.
 Eleven of the last 12 years rank among the
12 warmest years since 1850.
 Mountain glaciers and snow cover have
declined on average in both the northern
and the southern hemispheres, contributing
to a rise in sea level.
 The average global sea level rose at an
average rate of 0.07 inches (1.8 millimeters)
per year between 1961 and 2003. The total
20th-century rise in sea level is estimated to
be 0.56 feet (0.17 meters).
In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency reports that the sea level along the mid-
Atlantic and Gulf coasts rose 5 to 6 inches more
than the global average in the last century
because the coastal lands there are subsiding.

Predicting the effect of continued 
climate change
Based on a scenario in which greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in
the atmosphere, the IPCC predicts that global temperatures will rise 0.36
degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 degrees Celsius) per decade from now through 2020.
That rise will result in more of the same effects the world has been experiencing
for the past century (see the preceding section for details). In the coming years,
you can expect that local, national, and international governments will have to
deal with consequences such as these:
 Flooding problems, due to a continued decrease in the earth’s snow and ice
cover (including the ever-thinning ice cover in the subarctic and the arctic
regions of northern Canada), unusually heavy rainstorms, and a resulting
increase in global sea levels. These changes also mean that coastal
erosion will increase, which means the further loss of coastal land, and
that economies that rely on agriculture, for example, could be devastated.
 Inclement weather and changing weather patterns, including extreme
events such as storms, floods, and fires.
 More droughts and drier conditions, which will likely lead to
• Large forest fires fueled by dry conditions threatening more urban
areas such as the ones in October 2007 in San Diego, California
• Water shortages requiring mandatory conservation measures in
drier areas (which are already in place in areas of California)
• Water becoming an increasingly valuable commodity, with govern-
ments looking at shipping or transporting it from wetter regions to
drier regions and at alternative technology such as desalination
plants to remove the salt from seawater (which can cost more and
consume more energy than processing other sources of water)
• Regional food shortages because of a lack of water, with resulting
famines when agricultural crops can no longer be grown
 Bleaching of corals — considered the oases of the tropical seas, where
much of the diversity of sea life can be found — as a result of increasing
pollution and rising sea temperatures.
 Movement of insects into new areas (which is already happening in the case
of the mountain pine beetle, currently making its way east from the west
coast into the interior of northern North America, devastating pine forests
as it goes, because it’s no longer cold enough during the winter to kill it off).
33
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

The plants and wildlife in those new areas may not have developed a
natural protection against the insects, allowing them to do vast swaths
of damage or to introduce insect-borne diseases into new areas.
 Infectious disease epidemics created in tropical areas as a result of
polluted waters and increased insects.
It may be argued that not all the changes produced by global warming will be
negative. For example, a warming effect may be welcomed in some northern
climates where winters can be long and cold. However, even just a bit of warmer
weather comes with major upheavals: For example, engineers are already dealing
with permafrost layers that are melting in Alaska, damaging infrastructure such
as airport runways, roads, and buildings. This infrastructure needs to be
repaired at significant cost. Similarly, warmer temperatures may change the
agricultural basis of large geographic areas; while this change could be positive
in that it would allow new crops to be grown, it may cause conflict when growers
want to turn areas that used to be forest into farmland, potentially upsetting the
ecological balance.
How Urbanization and Neglect 
of Nature Directly Affect You
In the past three decades, the world’s population living in urban areas has
gone from one-third to just over half. This trend is evident in the U.S., where
80 percent of the population lives in metropolitan areas. The major reason for
the trend is people seeking big cities where global investment is taking place.
Hypercities — those with populations of more than 20 million people — are
growing in number around the world. Currently there are at least five: New
York (U.S.), Tokyo (Japan), Seoul (South Korea), São Paulo (Brazil), and
Mexico City (Mexico). Other cities on their way to supersize status are Beijing
(China), Cairo (Egypt), Jakarta (Indonesia), Mumbai (India), and Delhi (India).
Clearly, the earth can take only so much. It can’t replenish its resources at
the same rate that people are currently consuming them, and its rate of
replenishment may well decrease further as climate change continues to
affect both the land and the oceans. Add to that a growing urbanization of the
world’s population as a result of economic growth, and you have a situation
in which land, water, and wildlife are all at risk.
34

Decreased distance = Increased 
disease and infection
Growing world populations heading toward large urban areas means that more
and more people are living in close quarters and close to sources of pollution
such as factories and large concentrations of vehicles and even infection from
each other. The UN Population Division reports that in the past 30 years, the
urban population has increased significantly: In 1975, one in three persons
lived in urban areas; by 2007, it was more than one in two.
The distances viruses are able to travel nowadays is problematic as well. In
the past, viruses spread more slowly and outbreaks were isolated because
people traveled very little outside their own small communities. Today, viruses
spread at the speed of air travel. One unsuspecting disease carrier flying from
Thailand to the U.S. can spread a virus freely among a huge urban population
and thus to millions of commuters and visitors who can spread it around the
U.S. and the rest of the world within days and weeks. For several years, world
health experts have worried about the possibility of a flu pandemic, an outbreak
that they predict could kill hundreds of millions of people around the world.
Viruses don’t just affect people. National and international movement of live-
stock and other agricultural products and even migration patterns of wild
animals can spread viruses through animals, birds, insects, and other wildlife,
causing damage to natural ecosystems and environments. Examples of this
include outbreaks of diseases such as those caused by E.coli bacteria that
contaminate vegetable crops that are stocked by grocery stores throughout
North America.
Decreased food and water supply
Large populations put pressure on water and energy supplies as well as on
agricultural resources. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
predicted that grain supplies for the coming year would be at a 53-day equiv-
alent (meaning that if no additional supplies arrived, there would be enough
in storage to last 53 days). In comparison, the supply in 1999–2000 was
enough to last 115 days. Researchers report that the decrease is due to the
fact that we’re consistently not producing as much grain as we’re consuming.
People need to find ways to reduce their water consumption while increasing
their food production, but in an environmentally sustainable way. Simply
throwing more fertilizer, genetic modifications, or chemicals at crops isn’t a
long-term, green solution. Instead, people need to understand where the prob-
lems are coming from — including land clearing, water consumption practices,
and breaking links in the food chain — so that they can find solutions.
35
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

Clearing the land
One major concern in modern-day society is that the amount of land available in
the world for growing crops and supporting animal herds for food (such as
cattle and sheep) is insufficient to support the food needs of the world’s popula-
tion. The causes are urbanization and land clearing for economic development
(added to the fact that large areas of the world aren’t suitable for agriculture). In
the U.S., for example, almost 3,000 acres of farmland are replaced daily with
development, and more than one-third of the nation’s wetlands have been
replaced by urban development or agriculture. People also are claiming more
land individually: According to CEP, each American occupies about 20 percent
more developed land (which includes houses, schools, shopping, and roads)
than they did 20 years ago.
Clearing the land has a number of negative effects on ecosystems, among
them the following:
 When you replace forests or wetlands, for example, with agriculture or
development, soil erosion takes place. Clouds of dirt can even be seen
blowing in the wind over farmland in drier areas as topsoil disappears,
leaving the resulting land with fewer nutrients.
 Stripping the land removes tracts of forest and other vegetation that
would otherwise use and store the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
thus reducing the earth’s ability to deal with greenhouse gases.
 Food and other essential products have to be transported into towns
and cities to support people who no longer produce their own food and
clothing. As a result, energy consumption for transportation increases.
 Mass production farming methods are required to produce the food
needed for growing populations. This scenario leads to the breakdown
of the family farm, which is being replaced by large corporate farming
entities that can afford the technology and research needed for mass
production.
 The amount of waste that has to be disposed of in urban areas grows 
as the population does, in part because as people become separated
from the land that supports them, their concern about reducing waste
through such techniques as composting decreases.
Draining the founts of H2O
Water supplies are dwindling because of rapid population growth in the devel-
oping world and because of the way people consume water in many developed
areas. It’s essential for people to reduce the amount of water that they use
every day in order to ensure that there’s enough of this resource to support
not only the people living on the planet but all its ecosystems, too. After all,
those ecosystems are at the heart of the world’s agricultural production.
36
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

The Worldwatch Institute reports that China has 22 percent of the world’s
population but just 8 percent of the world’s fresh water.
According to the UN Development Program, lack of water and sanitation in
developing countries is to blame for almost 2 million child deaths each year
and produces health problems for almost half of all people in those coun-
tries. It reports that 1.1 billion people around the world don’t have access to
water, and 2.6 billion don’t have access to sanitation. It also reports that the
majority of the world’s 830 million malnourished people are small farmers,
herders, and farm laborers who face increasing water insecurity due to cli-
mate change. With parts of sub-Saharan Africa already dealing with losing a
quarter of crops to drought, the lack of water in specific areas has the poten-
tial to destabilize developing countries.
Removing links in the food chain
Studies show that people depend on approximately 10 million other species
on earth to support the food production process. Many of those species,
which exist within the food chain to produce, protect, or enhance food pro-
duction, are in danger of disappearing because of the impact that human
behavior has on the ecosystems in which they live. For example, urban devel-
opment can reduce wildlife abilities to migrate to seasonal feeding grounds,
and pesticide spraying for agricultural crops can run off into waterways,
introducing chemicals into the water that kill or harm fish.
Even when not directly involved in food production, wildlife — from insects
to large mammals such as elephants — plays a role in the health and regener-
ation of its environment. Bees, for example, pollinate flowers, and elephants
redistribute plant seeds through their fecal matter and create watering holes for
other animals as well as themselves by digging for water. Removing even one
species can have a negative effect on the entire ecosystem. For example, when
predators such as wolves are removed from the ecosystem, the populations of
deer, their usual prey, increase well beyond the numbers that the local vegeta-
tion can support, which in turn leads to the deer starving or trying to move into
new areas in search of food.
Some 6,700 known plant and animal species are considered at risk of extinc-
tion within the U.S. Worldwide, the figure is more than 16,000 plants and ani-
mals that are under threat.
The World Wildlife Fund tracks trends in more than 3,600 populations of ver-
tebrate species (animals that have a spine, whether they’re on land or in lakes
and oceans) on an ongoing basis. The organization discovered that populations
declined by one-third between 1970 and 2003.
37
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

Ingesting dangerous chemicals
The burning of fossil fuels for a variety of energy, transport, and industrial
needs affects not only the global climate but also your health. Many toxic
chemicals are emitted into the environment, whether into the air, ground,
waterways, and even through the food you eat.
In the air
People living close to industrial sites in countries with little or no environ-
mental regulation for emissions and pollution of air, land, and water are at
risk for health problems including asthma and other respiratory diseases.
Even in countries like the U.S, where environmental regulation is taken more
seriously, the sheer volume of traffic in urban areas puts people at risk for
diseases caused or made worse by air pollution.
You may not see it, but some of the pollution floating around in the air is a
major health hazard. Some of the dangers include:
 Ozone: Good ozone is the layer that exists between 6.2 and 31 miles
above the earth’s surface and protects you from the sun’s ultraviolet
rays. Bad ozone is formed when pollutants emitted by vehicles, factories,
and refineries react chemically in the presence of sunlight. Ozone can
bring on respiratory infections and increase the incidence of asthma.
 Particle pollution: Most fine-particle pollutants are visible only through
a microscope, but together they form the smog you see on windless days.
Particle pollutants are emitted directly (from vehicle exhausts and manu-
facturing plants, for example) or are formed in the atmosphere when other
pollutants react with them. They can cause major respiratory difficulties
and have even been linked to lung and heart illnesses.
 Carbon monoxide: Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas
that’s difficult to detect. It forms when the carbon in fuels doesn’t com-
pletely burn. Vehicles contribute a high proportion of CO to the atmos-
phere; industry and brushfires also contribute to CO emissions. Carbon
monoxide in the body restricts blood flow, affects those with cardiovas-
cular problems, and can even be fatal when it builds up in enclosed
spaces (such as homes and garages due to faulty furnaces or venting).
 Sulfur dioxide: Sulfur dioxide is also colorless, but its rotten-egg smell
makes it easy to identify. It’s a reactive gas that’s produced when coal
and oil are burned in places like power plants and industrial boilers. The
smell is the main reason that people stay away from industrial areas
using these fuels. But besides being offensive to the nose, it’s offensive
to the lungs and heart.
38
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

The next time you watch the local news on TV, pay attention to the weather
report’s air-quality index. This index measures the extent of major gases and
particles delivered into the air on a given day, and it provides an indication of
the potential for health issues for those who are vulnerable to respiratory
conditions.
A recent study at Northwestern University sheds some light on how air pollution
can cause not just respiratory ailments but also cardiovascular events such as
heart attacks and strokes. The study found that the pollution particles triggered
the formation of blood clots in mice, and blood clots can cause both heart
attacks and strokes, depending on whether they form or move within the
body to the heart or the brain.
In foods
The need to feed the world’s growing population and the demand for inex-
pensive food has led to mass food production. Intensive farming methods
have developed to meet demand and to get food onto plates quickly. These
methods include:
 Chemical additives, antibiotics, and artificial hormones used to make
animals and birds grow more quickly and to prevent disease in herds
and flocks
 Chemical pesticides and fertilizers used to raise the quantities of crops
that can be produced per acre of land while sending environmentally
harmful runoff into waterways
The long-term health effects of these farming methods aren’t always clear
immediately, but they are cause for concern. For example, antibiotics in the
food chain can cause people to become resistant to them, which causes prob-
lems when the antibiotics are essential to the treatment of a medical condi-
tion. The BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) outbreak, which led to
the deaths of more than 150 people in the United Kingdom in the 1990s and
2000s, was a direct result of particular bone meal products added to the food
given to beef cattle to keep the costs of beef production down. (Chapter 10
looks at the food you eat and how to buy the greenest food available. If you’re
feeling ambitious, Chapter 8 tells you how to grow your own food.)
In products
The biggest users of chemicals that are potentially harmful to human health
are industries that manufacture medicines, plastics, textiles, detergents,
paints, and pesticides. Two problems are inherent with the chemicals found
in these products:
 The products bring people into daily contact with potentially harmful
substances.
 The processes used to create the products create waste that’s potentially
harmful.
39
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

When the manufacture of these chemical-containing products (see the list of
potentially harmful chemicals later in this section) began decades ago, the toxic
mess produced was invariably released into nearby waterways, emitted into the
air, or simply dumped on the ground. Environmental regulations in many indus-
trialized countries are now in place to prevent some of this, but more and more
people are at risk from contaminated air, land, and water in areas where envi-
ronmental regulations haven’t kept up with industry. And even in the U.S.,
regulations allow the emission of certain amounts of chemicals as long as
they’re kept within specific limits. Toxic chemical leaks from industrial sites
do still happen in the U.S. as well, despite enforcement of environmental reg-
ulations. For example, in October 2007, the leak of 500 gallons of hydrochloric
acid at a metal plating plant in Melvindale, Michigan, caused the evacuation
of approximately 3,000 local residents. In parts of the world where factories
routinely get rid of their waste into the nearest stretch of water and where
local people are dependent on that water for everyday use, the dangers are
huge. And in many parts of the world, untreated human effluent also finds it
way into the nearest stretch of water, where it routinely causes disease. This
contamination leaves people at risk of toxic poisoning.
Some of the major potentially harmful substances that may be introduced
into the environment include:
 Brominated flame retardants: These are used in plastics for computer
casings, white goods, car interiors, carpets, and polyurethane foams in
furniture and bedding. They can end up in the dust of homes and offices
and are linked with cancer and reproductive problems.
 Dioxins: A byproduct of PVC (polyvinyl chloride, made into anything
from window frames and plastic), industrial bleaching, and incineration,
dioxins can lead to diseases of the immune system, reproductive and
developmental disorders, and cancer.
 Lead and mercury: Toxic heavy metals that don’t break down in the
environment and aren’t destroyed at any temperature include lead and
mercury (which is also used in people’s dental fillings). Lead is the most
prevalent industrial toxin released into the environment and therefore
causes the most environmentally related health problems. It’s released
into the atmosphere through gas and paint. Low levels of lead and 
mercury can cause mental illness, learning disabilities, and stunted
growth in children.
 Organochlorine pesticides: These types of pesticide include DDT, dieldrin,
heptachlor, chlordane, and mirex, all of which are used in farming and
gardening and can end up in soils, the water table, rivers, and streams.
Most have been banned in many countries including the U.S. because they
can cause cancer and are toxic to the immune system; however, these
substances can linger in the ground. Near a former DDT manufacturing site
in Montrose, California, that shut down its DDT activities in 1982, EPA soil
testing has shown elevated DDT levels in soil five feet below the ground
surface (although not in the soils between ground surface and the five-
foot level).
40
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

 Perfluorochemicals: These are acids used in the manufacture of every-
day items such as clothing, stain-resistant materials, and cosmetics.
They’re linked to cancer and liver damage.
 Phthalates: One of the most omnipresent groups of chemicals and used
mainly as softeners in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as well as in cosmetics
and perfumes, these chemicals disrupt hormones.
Reducing your use of products that contain these substances reduces the
need for them and thus the production of them in the first place.
Looking Forward: Thinking Globally,
Acting Locally
Is it possible to stop and then reverse the damage that’s being done to the
planet? Considering where the world currently stands in terms of resource
depletion and greenhouse gas emissions, it’s tempting to think that the situa-
tion can’t possibly be improved. However, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has
taken a clear look at where things are and where they’re going, and they believe
that, in fact, the world has more than enough sustainable energy and technology
to supply a projected doubling in global demand for energy between now and
2050 while dropping carbon dioxide emissions by 60 to 80 percent. The WWF
believes that this supply will come from six key solutions: improving energy 
efficiency, stopping forest loss, accelerating the development of low-emissions
technologies, developing flexible fuels, replacing high-carbon coal with low-
carbon natural gas, and equipping fossil fuel plants with carbon capture and
storage technology.
Huge gains in environmental progress have been made before: for example,
the protection of threatened wildlife species such as the peregrine falcon and
the bald eagle. However, the citizens of the world need to act quickly according
to the WWF — in the next five years, in fact! And bringing about change and
repair will take a combined effort from individuals, businesses, and governments.
It may not be possible to reverse every effect, but it’s still possible for people
to make a difference.
41
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges

The macro perspective: Necessary changes
at the governmental level
This section lays out what the WWF’s Climate Solutions report, released in 2007,
says needs to be done in order to meet the world’s increasing demand for
energy without further damaging the world’s climate. The world can prevent
carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere by taking the following
actions:
 Improve energy efficiency. Reducing the amount of energy people use
is an essential part of reducing greenhouse gas emissions — solutions
can range from sealing energy leaks in homes to driving more fuel-efficient
vehicles.
 Stop forest loss. Nurturing carbon dioxide-storing plants such as trees is
a major way to reduce the effect of carbon emissions. The trees take
carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as part of the photosynthesis
process, and they hold that carbon dioxide until they’re burned.
 Accelerate the development of low-emissions technologies. Practical
(as in, available and reasonably priced) alternative energy sources such
as wind, hydro (water), biomass (fuel from natural material such as
crops and agricultural waste), and solar power are considered renewable
(there’s more on these in Chapter 3). Humans can’t use up the wind and
the sun, for example, in the same way they can use up fossil fuels.
Alternative energy sources also have the benefit of producing little to no
greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, technologies need to be
researched and implemented to reduce emissions from existing energy
sources.
 Develop flexible fuels. Flexible fuels such as hydrogen fuel cell technology
would allow the effective and efficient storage of energy from intermittent
sources such as the sun and wind so that the energy could be used as
and when needed.
 Replace high-carbon coal with low-carbon gas. Although natural gas gives
off carbon dioxide emissions when it’s burned, the emissions are much
lower than those given off by coal. Switching power plants, for example,
from coal-burning to gas-burning can significantly reduce emissions.
 Equip fossil fuel plants with carbon capture and storage technology.
Carbon capture technology takes the carbon that results from burning
fossil fuels and stores it where it can’t be released into the atmosphere
(underground, for example). Although it doesn’t exactly reduce emissions,
carbon capture technology does prevent emissions from reaching the
atmosphere.
42
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

Although not necessarily addressing the WWF report specifically, the U.S. is
addressing many of these issues by providing information and support to
homeowners wishing to increase energy efficiency; fueling many new power
plants with natural gas rather than coal; and funding research into alternative
energy sources, carbon capture, and flexible fuels. However, the WWF report
indicates that people need to move much more quickly on all these areas in
order to slow climate change.
The town of Gussing, Austria, is an excellent example of the impact of envi-
ronmental change. Gussing has cut its carbon emissions by more than 90 per-
cent in the last 15 or so years! How did they manage that? The town council
had trouble paying its electrical bill, so it decided that all public buildings in
Gussing would run on renewable energy instead of fossil fuels. Today, energy
sources there include the sun, cooking oil, and biofuels such as sawdust and
corn; the town generates enough power to sell some back to the national grid!
Most industrialized countries are now focusing on reducing or eliminating
waste by educating residents and businesses about how to decrease the
amount of waste they’re responsible for, how to reuse as much as possible,
how to recycle what can’t be reused, and how to turn household and garden
waste into compost. You can find tips on implementing these changes in your
own life in Chapter 6.
43
Chapter 2: Understanding the Environment's Challenges
The U.S. and the Kyoto Protocol
In 1990, the IPCC reported that a 60 percent
reduction in harmful emissions into the earth’s
atmosphere was needed to redress serious
damage that had been done to the planet.
In 1998 in Kyoto, Japan, 141 world leaders
agreed that from 2008 to 2012, industrialized
countries would work to reduce their own
greenhouse gas emissions to 5.2 percent below
their levels in 1990 (but they didn’t really say
how). At the time of this writing, the U.S. hasn’t
ratified the Kyoto Protocol agreement. One of
the reasons given is that India and China, con-
sidered developing nations, are exempted from
the agreement’s targets.
The statistics suggest that not having the U.S.
onboard reduces the global effectiveness of the
Kyoto Protocol, but it may not be the deal-
breaker that it was originally thought to be.
Politicians and politics change rapidly, and as
climate change becomes an increasingly impor-
tant issue, more international meetings are
taking place to reassess greenhouse gas
reduction targets and move forward. In the
future, the Kyoto Protocol may be seen as the
agreement that started the ball rolling.

The micro perspective: How one 
person can effect big change
Living a green life at a very local level really does help to change the world on a
global level because every positive change that you make has a ripple effect.
Reducing your energy consumption, for example, means that less fossil fuels
need to be burned, which means that fewer greenhouse gases end up in the
atmosphere, which in turn creates less global warming and protects more of the
environment. Sure, the effect seems minimal when you consider the grandiosity
of the environmental problems, but as history shows, individuals can create
great waves of change — you just have to be consistent and persistent. You can
make plenty of changes to your own lifestyle right away, thus taking care of your
own personal responsibility and making an immediate difference to your home
and community. We tell you about all the things you can do — small and large,
cheap and not-so-cheap — throughout this book.
You also can help people around you adopt a similar green approach by
participating in community and even international initiatives such as
 Volunteering for a community action group that has similar interests to
you, such as a cyclists’ lobby group or a group representing local
conservation efforts
 Writing letters about topics such as waste reduction (see Chapter 6),
greening the local municipality’s vehicle fleet (see Chapter 14), and
alternative energy sources (see Chapter 3) to the editors of newspapers,
magazines, and Web sites, and to your local, state, and federal politicians
 Getting involved with an international lobby, policy, or research organi-
zation that supports green living
 Joining a political party that represents your views and through which
you think you can have an influence
Getting more people involved in actively promoting greener living makes it
more likely that the politicians responsible for policy-making will take envi-
ronmental issues more seriously. It’s important to make your case tactfully
and based on science rather than rhetoric, however; otherwise, you’ll do
more to turn people off green living than on.
Many of the tips in this book are simple ones that you can start immediately
without making huge changes to your lifestyle. When you take action, you
help turn the tide and provide hope that the planet can sustain its future
generations — your grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

The World’s Source of Hope:
Renewable Energy Sources

R
enewable forms of energy either naturally replenish themselves — like
the sun’s rays, the wind, the temperature in the earth’s crust, and the
flow of rivers and tides — or are quickly replenished (relatively speaking) —
like crops and trees used as fuel.
As we discuss in Chapter 2, nonrenewable energy sources are problematic for
several reasons: Fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas contribute to
emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants and will eventually run
out because the earth can’t replenish them as quickly as people use them; in
addition, uranium (used to fuel nuclear power plants) creates waste that’s
extremely hazardous to the environment and human health. Renewable energy
sources alleviate those concerns because they won’t run out and don’t emit
the harmful substances that nonrenewable energy sources do.
Renewable energy has been around for a very long time — pretty much since
the discovery of fire (fire burns wood, or biomass, to create energy in the
form of heat). Other forms of renewable power also have been used histori-
cally in the form of windmills and waterwheels (which eventually turned into
hydroelectric forms of power). Much more recently, however, the technology
involved in using these forms of energy has allowed for practical applications
on a larger scale.
In this chapter, we focus on the concepts behind renewable energy sources for
utilities such as electricity-generating power plants and how they work as well
as how they’re being implemented and being considered for implementation
at the nationwide and even worldwide levels. (We explain how you can adapt
your home for greener energy use in Chapters 4 and 5.)

Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 
A Primer on Sizing Up Fuel Sources
Assessing energy sources isn’t as simple as saying “nonrenewable is bad and
renewable is good.” Most sources have their pros and cons, which means
that, once again, a green issue isn’t a black-and-white choice. If you’re consid-
ering purchasing energy from renewable sources or supporting the govern-
ments and politicians that want to introduce them, it’s important to
understand how each type works and its pros and cons. Here are some issues
you should mull over:
 Cost: It doesn’t matter how beneficial an energy source is for the environ-
ment if it costs so much extra that it’s no longer affordable. However, if the
additional cost for environmentally friendly energy is only a small amount
and you can afford it, it’s worth paying. Supporting government initiatives
that fund alternative energy research and technology development is one
way to help bring costs down.
 Practicality: Some alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen fuel
cells, aren’t yet at the point where they’re practical for everyday use. In
other cases, an energy source may not be available in your area because
of climate limitations (solar and wind power aren’t practical in all geo-
graphic areas, for example).
 Environmental impact: It’s important to go beyond the issue of greenhouse
gas emissions to assess all the environmental issues involved in energy
sources. Hydro power, for example, is green in terms of greenhouse gas
emissions but can create other problems in terms of the flooding needed
for reservoirs and the challenges that dams pose for fish.
 Life cycle issues: Energy sources need to be assessed on a cost, practi-
cality, and environmental viewpoint from their initial construction
through their energy-producing life to their eventual decommissioning
and dismantling. Nuclear power, for example, is considered relatively
clean in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, but mining for its fuel —
uranium — and dealing with its radioactive waste is expensive, energy
intensive, and potentially harmful to the environment.
Harnessing the Energy of Flowing Water
Hydroelectric power installations already produce approximately 10 percent
of America’s electricity by harnessing the energy contained in flowing water.
Hydroelectric power is considered a renewable energy source because the
water isn’t consumed during the process and because water is part of a con-
stantly regenerating natural cycle.

Hydroelectric power installations essentially work when flowing water runs
through a turbine. There are different types of turbines, including the common
propeller type, which has blades that spin around under the force of the water.
No matter how the turbine is shaped, the spinning motion that it creates in
turn spins the rotor of an electricity generator, creating a magnetic field that
induces an electric current. In some cases, the turbine is simply placed in a
free-flowing stream of water; in others, the water is dammed in a reservoir to
provide a consistent and available water source.
Hydro power can be adapted for everything from large-scale utilities that
provide power to cities to small-scale single-home systems.
The advantage to hydro power is that it doesn’t produce greenhouse gases. It
certainly has an effect on the environment, however. The reservoirs created
by dam-type hydroelectric plants destroy a significant amount of natural
space, displacing vegetation, wildlife, and even people. The power plants
themselves create major difficulties for migratory fish, which can get sucked
into the turbines or find their paths blocked. Fish ladders, elevators, and
even trucking systems have mitigated these problems but still add obstacles
and stress to the paths of fish.
Hydroelectric plants also can alter the gas composition of water that flows
through them and can trap organisms in the still water of the reservoir, again
affecting the health of the wildlife that uses the river.
Difficulties surrounding water availability (in some cases, competing needs for
water for agricultural, industrial, or household use are an issue) and environ-
mental impacts are part of the reason that hydro power is expected to decrease
from 10 to 6 percent of the nation’s electricity generation by the year 2020.
A test project currently underway in New York’s East River uses the daily
tidal flows to drive turbines. If the test works out well, the project could be
expanded from an initial demonstration of six turbines to as many as 300,
generating enough energy to power almost 8,000 New York homes. This test
project is the world’s first hydropower technology of its kind that’s con-
nected to the local electrical grid.
Capturing and Diverting Sunbeams
Solar energy is definitely one of the greenest forms of renewable energy. It
has no emissions, and the only real environmental concern is the amount of
space that solar collectors take up. However, newer, improved technologies
are decreasing the need for space and making the components much more
efficient.
47
Chapter 3: The World's Source of Hope: Renewable Energy Sources

Very little — less than 1 percent — of the nation’s energy is currently produced
by solar sources; however, the potential for solar applications is huge (and
growing). Although solar panels work on a small scale to provide either heat or
power for individual buildings, they also can be grouped together to provide
heat or power to much larger areas, such as neighborhoods and small cities
(the largest arrays currently provide electricity to tens of thousands of homes).
This is called concentrating solar power, or CSP. Facilities with multiple solar
collectors use several different methods to capture the sun’s energy:
 Photovoltaic (PV) panels: The PV panels produce electricity directly
from the sun’s rays: When the sun’s light hits the semiconductors within
the panel, the light’s energy frees up electrons, which flow out of the PV
panel as electrical current and can feed the area’s electrical grid.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is working on making the price of
photovoltaic power competitive with traditional electricity sources
within the next decade.
 Solar thermal panels: Solar panels capture the sun’s energy as heat and
transfer the heat via piped fluid into an inground holding system (a geo-
thermal application) until it’s needed by the community (see Figure 3-1).
In smaller communities, the heat is distributed through pipes to buildings
throughout the community to provide warmth. In other applications, the
heat drives a central steam generator to create electricity.
The solar thermal facility installed in Kramer Junction, California, was
the world’s largest when it was commissioned in 1986. Still in operation
today, it uses rows of mirrors to concentrate the sun’s heat onto pipes
that move the heat to a steam generator to produce electricity.
 Solar dishes: This technology collects and concentrates the sun’s rays
in a parabolic dish, turning them into heat and transferring it to a power
generator.
Going with the Wind
Traditionally, wind power has been used in very small installations, such as
powering wells on farms. However, this is changing. In 2006, enough wind-driven
electricity was generated in America to power almost 3 million households —
and the potential exists for much more wind power development. It currently
provides approximately 1 percent of the nation’s energy, but that figure is
expected to rise in coming years. In 2005, the U.S. installed more new wind
energy capacity than any other country in the world.
48
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

You may not think of wind as a form of solar energy, but in fact it is: Wind is
formed when the sun heats the earth’s surface, which then radiates heat into
the air. As the air warms, it rises, creating a different pressure at ground level
than higher up, and as air rushes between these pressure areas, it creates
wind. Because this is happening on a global scale, wind persists even after
the sun has gone down for the evening. Wind energy is also renewable and
produces no greenhouse gas emissions.
Large-scale wind power developments generally group tall, free-standing
turbines in a windy area, positioned so that their blades catch the wind and
turn, thus generating energy for the area’s power grid. These wind farms can
be awe-inspiring to see, but they generate controversy along with energy.
Critics cite noise, visual impact, and their effect on airborne wildlife such as
birds and bats as reasons not to build them; however, the industry is addressing
the noise and environmental concerns by way of technological developments
that have reduced turbine noise and by locating the turbines where their
impact on wildlife is reduced.

Chapter 3: The World's Source of Hope: Renewable Energy Sources

To put bird deaths due to wind turbines in perspective, the National Wind
Coordinating Committee reports that 1 out of every 5,000 to 10,000 bird deaths
in the U.S. each year is due to collisions with wind turbines. It also reports
that although that figure may seem small, all efforts to reduce fatalities are
important.
Pairing different renewable technologies can help balance out their supply
issues, and wind power is ideal for this scenario because it’s intermittent. For
example, the wind often blows at night or during stormy weather, generating
electricity when the sun’s not available to power solar energy options. When
it’s a beautiful, windless day, the sun may well be able to pick up the slack.
Digging Deep for Geothermal Energy
Geothermal energy takes advantage of the fact that the deeper you go into
the earth’s crust, the warmer things get. (It works out to about 50 to 87
degrees Fahrenheit of difference in temperature for every mile.) In small-scale
operations, especially those for individual houses or buildings, pipes are
installed as few as ten feet into the earth (or inserted into a water source such
as a pond) to capture the heat and transfer it to a heat pump system inside the
building. In large-scale community geothermal installations, the drilling is often
deeper, into geothermal reservoirs up to two miles below the ground surface,
where the heat of underground water may be up to 700 degrees. Hot water or
steam is then piped up to the surface to generate electricity (usually by turning
turbines), with the cooled water often pumped back down to the source to
replenish it.
Currently, geothermal energy produces less than 1 percent of America’s energy.
However, the EPA reports that for temperature control (for heating and cooling
buildings), it’s the most energy efficient, environmentally clean and cost-effective
method.
Using geothermal heat to warm greenhouse operations can be an energy-
efficient and green way to extend the growing season and make local produce
available for longer because the energy doesn’t have to be converted to
different forms: It comes as heat and is used as heat, as opposed to requiring
electricity to power an appliance to produce heat.
One drawback to a geothermal reservoir system is that a community needs
to be close to the reservoir in order to take advantage of the heat’s energy.
Systems that run on shallower systems using heat pump technology can be
more flexible. Geothermal energy is already in use in many parts of the coun-
try, including Boise, Idaho, where it was first used in 1893. These older sites
50
Part I: Understanding the Planet’s Challenges and Finding Solutions 

tended to rely very much on geography providing easy access to the heat;
today, the advancement of technology such as heat pumps allows much
wider application of geothermal energy.
Even though energy is required to power the pumps that move the water
from one place to another (depending on the source of this energy, it may
emit greenhouse gases), geothermal sources of energy still use much less
energy than other energy sources, and they don’t produce greenhouse gases.
One drawback, however, is that some water sources contain hydrogen sulfur
that can be harmful to workers at geothermal plants; however, systems have
been developed to filter that out.
Creating Energy with Biomass
Biomass refers to any organic material. It can be trees, wood chips, pulp
sludge from wood-processing facilities, agricultural crops, animal manure,
and even organic waste. Although biomass releases carbon when it burns or
is processed, it’s considered renewable because new organic material can be
planted to replace it, and that new organic material consumes carbon as it
grows. The process ends up being carbon neutral — meaning that it con-
sumes as much carbon as it produces — as long as you plant enough to offset
what you burn or process. Biomass currently produces approximately 3 per-
cent of America’s energy.
Biomass can be utilized in many different ways; here are some of the more
common examples:
 It’s generally burned to produce heat, steam, and electricity for 
communities.
 Other processes can turn biomass into gas, synthetic fuel oil, methane,
ethanol, biodiesel, or methanol, which then can be used to power vehi-
cles and other machinery, including generators.
 Biomass products may be used to create products that are usually made
from petroleum products, including clothing and plastics.
Biomass already provides approximately 3 percent of America’s energy, and it
has the potential to provide much more. If it consists of waste, it has the
added benefit of turning trash into energy; if it consists of agricultural crops,
it can benefit farmers economically. Experts caution, however, that growing
crops specifically for biomass applications could end up competing with
space needed for food crops, so sources of agricultural biomass need to be
carefully considered and balanced. Using waste products is the greenest form
of biomass production.

Chapter 3: The World's Source of Hope: Renewable Energy Sources

Looking at the Future: Hydrogen as 
a Harbor of Renewable Energy
The potential of hydrogen as an alternative energy source, not just for vehicles
but also to generate electricity, is still very much at the research stage, but a
lot of government and industry effort is going into moving from research into
development and implementation.
Essentially, hydrogen can be produced from almost any other form of energy,
including fossil fuels and renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro
power. The secret to hydrogen’s success is that it’s not an energy source in
itself but rather can store the energy from those other sources. In effect, it
becomes a fuel that can be stored in tanks, for example. A fuel cell somewhat
like a battery converts the energy stored in the hydrogen to electricity by
using an electrolyte, which separates the hydrogen’s protons and electrons to
create a stream of electrons (electricity). The fuel cell’s electrochemical
process creates water and heat rather than greenhouse gases as byproducts.
(Even when fossil fuels are used to produce the hydrogen, far fewer of them
are used than if they were being used to generate electricity themselves.)
Fuel cells are very small and produce very small amounts of electricity, so
cells are stacked together to create practical applications. The size of the
stacks is one design issue, as is the cost of the components.
The U.S. DOE Hydrogen Program says that a conventional combustion-powered
power plant generates electricity at efficiencies of 33 to 35 percent. Hydrogen
fuel cells can be two to three times more efficient.
It will likely be some years yet before hydrogen makes it off the testing grounds
and into everyday life due to the current cost of the technology — but it could
be part of your future, so keep your eyes open.

Living Greenly 
at Home

In this part . . .
T
he best place to start living a greener lifestyle is close
to home. The chapters in this part focus on greening
every aspect of life at home, from the house you buy or
build to the way in which you use it. This part also looks
at your yard (whether it’s a tiny patch of balcony or a
wide expanse of lawn) to help you garden and even grow
your own food in a more sustainable way.
The keys to being greener are to reduce what you buy,
reuse what you have (or give it to someone who can),
repair instead of buying new, and cut down on the amount
of waste you produce by recycling and composting. With
that in mind, this part also shares ways to reduce your
waste. And because every member of the family can play
their part, we cover encouraging your children to
embrace a green life.

hen dreaming of a home, you have some major decisions to make:
Apartment or single family home? Urban living or rural idyll? Bungalow
or two-story? With residential homes consuming 22 percent of the nation’s
energy and 74 percent of its water, your choices about where to live and what
to live in play a big part in the impact you have on the planet.
Building an energy-efficient home is definitely a green way to go, but you can
go further — as far as product availability and your budget allow, in fact. A
green home is one that takes a holistic approach to sustainable living: Energy
efficiency is important, but so are using green building materials, water 
conservation, and waste reduction.
The fact of the matter is that turning your home green doesn’t just reduce your
energy bills: It also can make your home healthier and more comfortable by
reducing drafts, temperature fluctuations, and toxic materials, and it can vastly
reduce your ecological footprint. This chapter explores why your home is so
important environmentally and what makes a home planet-friendly. It also tells
you how to make your existing home greener or build a green house by iden-
tifying potential environmental hazards, conserving precious resources like
water and energy, and even taking steps to generate energy of your own.
For full coverage of the topic of green homes, check out Green Building &
Remodeling For Dummies by Eric Corey Freed (Wiley).

Setting Up Residence 
in a Green Location
Where you live has a big influence on how green you’re likely to be in the years
to come. If you live within walking distance of work, schools, shopping, and other
amenities, for example, you automatically reduce the amount that you need to
drive — but closed-in, urban locations may not be practical for everyone. In this
section, we look at the effects of proximity to amenities and offer suggestions
to make every location greener. And because it’s not just location but also
community that matters, we provide suggestions for questions to ask about
how green the community is before you decide to move there.
Accounting for proximity
You’re more likely to lead a green lifestyle if you live near facilities and services
such as stores, schools, medical clinics, public transportation stops, and leisure
facilities, and one of the best opportunities to find that close proximity is in
urban, downtown areas. But that raises a bit of a problem. In 2007, for the first
time — ever — more than half of the planet’s population lived in urban (as in,
city) rather than rural (as in, country) areas. This arrangement has had a
dramatic supply versus demand effect: Many of the most desirable urban loca-
tions, which often include those in trendy, well-serviced areas, have become
quite expensive to live in and to buy or rent homes in. Not everyone can afford to
(or, in fact, wants to) live in these urban, often inner-city, areas. If you’re looking
for a greener lifestyle, the question then is whether the suburbs, small towns, or
rural areas offer you the potential for sustainability. As with so many green living
issues, it depends — a little on the location and a lot on what you do with it.
Urban living: The greenest option
The most sustainable housing locations are those close to — preferably
within walking distance of — the following:
 Transportation: Proximity to good transport networks, such as bus
stops, light rail systems, and railway stations, reduces your need to
travel by vehicle. New development located close to public transport is
called transit-oriented development. The inner-city areas of big cities and
regional towns, where there’s a concentration of stores and jobs, are
most accessible for public transport systems and are beginning to
actively promote walking and cycling.
A sustainable urban area has safe, well-lit, and good-quality walking and
cycling paths and low levels of vehicle traffic.
56
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Essential services: The ability to walk or cycle to schools, churches,
public open spaces, community services, daycare facilities, libraries,
and stores makes life easier and greener for everyone, especially children
who don’t have to rely on you to drive them everywhere.
When children are young, they want to be wherever you are, but as your
children’s social lives become more important to them, you may have to
make endless journeys to and from parties, after-school activities, sports
events, youth clubs, friends’ homes, and the nearest bus or train stations.
The farther you are from these, the more you have to use public transport
or, if that isn’t accessible and convenient, your vehicle. When choosing
the greenest possible location for your home, consider the needs of your
children as well as yourself.
 Cultural and recreational facilities: Easy access to open space, parks,
sports facilities, and recreation areas keeps you in tune with Mother
Nature’s greenery, and nearby concert halls and theatres feed your 
artistic soul.
 The center of the local community: You can tell that you’re in a vibrant
sustainable community when many people of all ages and cultures walk
the streets; all the stores and services are open; the streets and sidewalks
are clean; and there’s a good mix of housing styles and types, which implies
a good socio-economic mix as well.
Keep in mind that as you get closer to these amenities, especially public
transportation, the available homes get smaller. It takes a lot of people living
in a relatively small geographic area to justify the cost of providing expensive
options such as a light rail system. Smaller homes allow as many people as
possible access to the public transportation network or to walk or cycle to
nearby stores and services.
Many community planners recognize the importance of providing as many
people as possible with accessible yet affordable housing choices across urban
areas. Many cities and towns now encourage developers to provide housing
around established centers close to public transportation. This is a direct
result of an increasing number of people willing to trade space for a location
near good public transport links or within walking or cycling distance of work.
Greening suburban life
If you decide that the suburbs are right for your family, look for the greenest,
most sustainable suburb possible. Recent designs are moving toward new
urbanism, which incorporates mixed housing types (condominium complexes,
smaller starter homes, and larger homes, for example), higher housing densities,
walking paths, community parks, local shopping centers, and strong community
associations. Many newer suburbs also have improved their management of
natural vegetation and water runoff. The variety of housing types available in
suburbs means that the size of house you choose is up to you: If you don’t need
the extra rooms, don’t buy them.
57
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

Opting for a more rustic style: Small towns and countryside
If the suburbs and urban areas don’t work for you, you may be more suited to
life in a small town or in the country. The biggest issue to address in both cases
is likely to be distance: the distance to work if it’s not nearby, to schools if the area
isn’t well-served by schools for children of all ages, and to shopping. Distance
from places you need to go can become a major problem when one family
member takes the family car to work or elsewhere for the day, leaving those
at home stranded with no other realistic options for transportation.
You may be able to rely on school bus systems to get the kids to school and
carpools to help with the daily commute to work (see Chapter 13 for more 
on carpools). Working from home (called telecommuting; see Chapter 16) or
running your own home-based business also can facilitate the green lifestyle
you’re looking for. Plus, living away from cities and suburbs may mean that you
have enough yard in which to grow at least some of your own vegetables and
fruit (see Chapter 8), and if you live in the country, you may be able to green
58
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 
The problems with suburbia
As suburban areas have grown larger, often
consuming smaller communities as they go,
they’ve created environmental challenges.
Following are a sampling of the problems cre-
ated by larger populations in suburban living:
 Less vegetation and agricultural land: As
urban boundaries extend, green land such
as forests or farm fields is paved over to
provide more housing. (Farmers often gain
more of a return on investment by selling
their land to developers than continuing to
farm it.) During heavy rains and storms, the
water runs off into storm sewers or floods
low-lying areas (often creating erosion as it
does so) because it can no longer seep nat-
urally away into the earth as it once did.
 Increased demand for gas and oil: Many
suburbs designed several decades ago fea-
tured double-car garages as house fronts,
few sidewalks, and little in the way of local
stores: These characteristics practically
force you into your vehicle for getting 
to work, recreation, and shopping, thus
increasing energy-related vehicle costs and
greenhouse gas emissions.
 Urban design issues: Migration to suburbs
has caused the “donut” effect, in which
downtowns become ghost towns at night
when office workers head home to the sub-
urbs. Many cities have begun actively
renewing their downtown areas, encourag-
ing the building or renewal of high-rise
living accommodations. As people increas-
ingly choose to live downtown, stores and
services stay open later, increasing the
amenities available to residents, so it’s a
win-win situation. However, many cities are
still struggling with downtown areas that
have become rundown and crime-ridden
because of a lack of legitimate night-time
users.
 Increased pressure on utilities: The desire
for large houses in suburban areas with all
the amenities, such as large entertainment
systems, air conditioning, swimming pools,
and lots of fully furnished rooms, increases
water and power consumption.

your home using alternative energy sources such as wind and geothermal
energy (see the later section “Designing — or Redesigning — Your Home 
for Energy Efficiency”).
When considering living in a location that’s not close to amenities, think
about the impact you’ll make on the environment. Factor in access to water,
electricity, gas, telephone, and postal services; the wear and tear your activi-
ties cause to roads; and the environmental cost of keeping all that infrastruc-
ture in good repair. Many people dream of living in the middle of nowhere
away from the rat race, but that kind of lifestyle still has an environmental
impact. You may choose to offset some of the impact by investing in carbon
offsets (discussed in Chapter 15), opting to buy green power, or making other
parts of your lifestyle as green as possible.
Having items delivered to your home can be better in terms of carbon emissions
than driving out to get everything yourself. One van delivering to 30 houses
using the most efficient route between them can produce fewer emissions than
30 vehicles driving from their respective homes to the store.
Factoring in the community
Getting the location right is all well and good, but if your local community
doesn’t offer recycling or doesn’t encourage sustainable development, then
those missing factors can outweigh many of the advantages your chosen
location offers in terms of a greener lifestyle.
When you think that you’ve found a green housing location, investigate the
policies of your local town or county government. Check its Web site to see
what it says about the following:
 Environmental initiatives: It’s a good sign if the community shows
active interest in environmental issues such as water efficiency, pollution,
energy efficiency, transportation, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions,
waste management, recycling, and noise.
 Community services: What’s the range of community facilities available
in the area? The community or government Web site should list the location
and number of childcare centers, community activity venues, and services
for elderly and disabled residents and youth. Most sustainable residential
areas have many of these services located near homes or public 
transportation links.
59
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

 Development: One of the key functions of all community governments is
to work on strategies and plans that will guide future development. So
have a look at your community’s plans for the years ahead. If there’s an
emphasis on economic growth and more development with little refer-
ence to environmental protection, the place may not be as green as you
thought. Governments and city councils supporting sustainable princi-
ples are more likely to talk about the environment, accessibility, vitality,
and social fabric, with any growth and development promoted within
that context.
Familiarizing Yourself with LEED
Standards for Building Design
LEED stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, and it’s a
program run by the United States Green Building Council. The council has
created a national standard for green buildings — those that don’t focus just
on energy efficiency but also on sustainable site development, water savings,
materials selection, and indoor environmental quality. LEED for Homes
launched in 2007 to apply these benchmarks to residential homes.
You can expect a LEED home to include these features:
 Energy Star (energy efficient) appliances and windows
 Excellent insulation and air leak sealing
 Drought-resistant plants in the landscaping
 Environmentally friendly building products
 Alternative energy sources such as solar panels for power or heating
LEED for Homes is strictly voluntary. It’s up to an individual builder to decide
to join the program (which includes paying a small registration fee) and to
build homes in accordance with the program’s rating system, which assigns
points to a number of mandatory and optional green building measures. Homes
that qualify based on independent third-party certifications then meet bronze,
silver, gold, and platinum rating levels. A platinum rating is assigned to a home
that has the greenest characteristics possible. As someone looking to buy an
existing home, you don’t join the LEED program yourself but rather look for a
builder who has. If you’re building your own home (and perhaps serving as the
general contractor), you can consider joining the LEED program for the ongoing
advice and assistance it offers and the potentially higher resale value that you
earn because of the LEED rating.
60
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

In general, homes that earn a place on the LEED scale use less energy, water,
and natural resources than other homes; they create less waste and are health-
ier and more comfortable to live in, too. You can expect lower utility bills, lower
greenhouse gas emissions, and less risk of toxins such as mold growing in the
house. The LEED program notes that the net cost of owning a LEED-rated home
is comparable to that of a conventional one. You can expect construction costs
to be higher, but energy and other savings over the life of the home should even it
out in the long run. You also may qualify for tax breaks depending on the kinds of
green building measures used (see the later section “Financing Green Home
Construction or Improvements”).
Even if you don’t build a home that can be LEED rated, the program offers
great ideas for green homes. For more information or to find a LEED builder
near you, go to www.usgbc.org, and click LEED, then LEED Rating Systems,
and then Homes.
Identifying and Avoiding Home 
Health Hazards
Before you plan a renovation of your existing home or the purchase of a new
one, you need to know what could be hiding inside an average home and how
it could affect your family’s health. Identifying the potential risk means that
you can manage it effectively, protecting both your family and the investment
you’re about to make in your home. This is a critical part of green living: It’s
no good incorporating green building measures into your construction or
renovation process if you don’t address an existing environmental hazard
that could affect your health.
Getting the lead out
If you plan to remodel an existing home, there’s a reasonable chance that it
contains lead paint if it was built before 1978, when lead was finally banned
from paint in the United States. Ingesting lead has been linked to brain and
nervous system damage in children. Kids are most likely to be exposed if the
paint is flaking, if they chew painted surfaces such as windowsills (you know
what children are like!), or if they drink water that travels through lead pipes.
You can buy lead testing kits for both paint and water, and you can also ask
your doctor to run blood tests on family members to ensure that lead levels
aren’t elevated. If you find any reason for concern, talk to a contractor who
deals specifically with lead about your options: In some cases, it’s best to
seal lead paint and paint over it rather than try to remove it (which creates
lead-containing dust). But you definitely need expert advice on this one.
61
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

Reducing volatile organic compounds
You can’t see volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but you can smell them:
They’re part of that scent that comes with many new materials, including
synthetic carpets and furniture made of particleboard as well as many other
household products, including cleansers, air fresheners, paints, solvents, and
wood preservatives. VOCs are chemicals that these materials give off, or
offgas, particularly when they’re newly made, which is why they’re such a big
issue when you’re building or renovating. VOCs are quite a cocktail and can
include benzene, formaldehyde, and toluene among other chemicals.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), VOCs can cause
eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders,
and memory impairment. Some are known to cause cancer in animals; some
are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans.
VOCs are so widespread that it’s difficult to completely eliminate them; how-
ever, the best strategy to reduce them in your household is to choose, when-
ever possible, natural products that don’t contain VOCs, such as wool carpets or
solid wood furniture that hasn’t been treated with chemical-based preservatives.
If you can’t go natural, leave items outside in the sun or in the garage for as long
as possible — from a few hours to a couple of days — to let the worst of the off-
gassing take place before the item ever enters your home. VOC concentration
and offgassing tends to be at a maximum when the item is new.
Avoiding asbestos
Asbestos is a really good insulating material, which is why it was used in
many building materials, including ceiling tiles, roof shingles, resilient floor-
ing, and pipe insulation. It’s not used anymore, of course, because it’s now
known that asbestos fibers can cause serious lung irritation, with prolonged
exposure causing major damage and disease.
In most cases around the house, asbestos is only a problem if the material is
deteriorating; otherwise, the fibers usually have no way of getting into your
lungs. You can’t tell just by looking at a building material such as vinyl floor-
ing or insulation that it contains asbestos; however, if the building material
dates back before the 1970s, it’s likely to contain asbestos. Insulation made
between 1930 and 1950, for example, may contain asbestos. If you suspect
that your home contains asbestos materials because of its age, bring in an
expert to advise you before you start ripping up or removing any materials.
Asbestos needs to be handled extremely carefully by a certified, qualified
asbestos removal expert because the act of ripping or tearing it releases its
damaging fibers.

Many experts recommend not disturbing asbestos-containing material if it can
be safely left in place. For example, it may be safer (and much less expensive)
to lay a new floor over an asbestos-containing floor that’s still in good shape.
Tearing up the old floor will release asbestos fibers — laying a new one over it
won’t.
Banishing molds and mildew
Moisture’s a tricky thing in that it can work silently away in a poorly ventilated
corner or even wick its way up inside a wall, creating the ideal conditions for
mold and mildew to grow. Many molds aren’t dangerous (although, of course,
they should all be cleaned up); however, some molds can cause major health
problems, particularly breathing difficulties.
The best defense against mold and mildew is to ensure that your home is well
ventilated. Condensation buildup on windows and other surfaces indicates
that your home may not be exchanging its indoor air with the outdoor air
often enough. If you’re renovating to make your home more energy efficient,
assess ventilation, seal ventilation leaks, and install more airtight doors and
windows if sealing leaks doesn’t solve the problem.
To clean up mold and mildew, use a bleach solution of one part bleach to four
parts water. Protect yourself with gloves, old clothing, safety glasses, and a
mask for your mouth and nose. You don’t want to breathe in either the
bleach fumes or any mold spores that you may dislodge when you scrub with
the bleach solution. (Bleach is admittedly a harsh product to use, but it’s the
most effective solution to get rid of mold and mildew. More natural solutions
may only reduce the mold; you need to completely get rid of it — otherwise it
will return.) Materials that soak up water, such as drywall, carpet, and ceiling
tiles, are virtually impossible to rid of mold: You’re better off to remove them,
place them in plastic garbage bags, and throw them out.
Detecting radon
Radon gas is a very natural product, but it’s unfortunately not one that you
want in your home. Produced when uranium in the earth decays, radon can
seep up into homes through cracks in the foundation, dirt basements, and
even well water. Radon is colorless, odorless, and radioactive; that last one
can cause health problems such as lung cancer if you breathe radon for 
prolonged periods.
63
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

Radon gas is a very localized issue; it’s not unusual for houses in the same
area to be affected differently, so it’s impossible to predict where problems
will occur. To check your home for radon, purchase a home test kit from a
hardware store or other retail outlet. Follow the instructions in the kit as to
the amount of time you leave the test sample in your home and where to send it
to the lab for results. You also can talk to a contractor who deals with radon gas
identification (your state EPA office will have a list of them; check www.epa
.gov/iaq/whereyoulive.html for contact information). If radon is present,
the most effective solution is to seal the basement properly and vent the radon
so that the gas can no longer enter your home — this needs to be done by a
radon-qualified contractor (again, contact your EPA office to find one).
Designing — or Redesigning — Your
Home for Energy Efficiency
Vehicles usually get blamed for generating the most harmful emissions, but
the reality is that the average home can emit more than twice the carbon
dioxide in a year that the average vehicle parked outside it emits. If you’re
building a new home or renovating your existing home, it’s the ideal time to
boost your energy efficiency. You can do this in a number of ways, including
using the sun’s rays to warm the home, insulating the home properly, and
incorporating energy-efficient components such as doors, windows, and
appliances into your renovation or construction.
The Department of Energy (DOE) reports that Americans spend $110 billion
on home energy bills every year — that’s almost $1,300 for every house.
Assessing a home’s energy efficiency
The easiest way to determine whether a new home is energy efficient is to
find out if it’s an Energy Star Home. This is one that meets EPA standards for
energy efficiency on such features as insulation, windows, construction,
ventilation, heating and cooling systems, and Energy Star-rated lighting and
appliances. You can expect an Energy Star Home to be at least 15 percent
more energy efficient than other homes. When looking at new homes, you
also may see references to the newest form of energy-efficient housing,
described as Zero Energy. Over the course of a year (four seasons), these
homes generate as much energy as they consume, usually through the use of
solar, wind, and geothermal energy.
64
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

To determine the best way to improve your existing home’s energy efficiency,
you need to know where you’re starting from. You can use a rough estimate
or a detailed professional energy audit (the latter is sometimes required in
order to qualify for government grants or tax incentives, so it can be worth
the investment); both tell you how much energy your home uses and provide
ideas about measures to take to improve the rating.
 Rough estimate: The Home Energy Saver (hes.lbl.gov/hes) is an
online tool that’s part of the government’s Energy Star program. Enter
your zip code and some information about your home, and it comes
back to you with customized energy use calculations and totals as well
as energy-saving upgrade recommendations. (You also can use this
online calculator to estimate how a house that you’re planning to build
would measure up in terms of energy use.)
 Professional energy audit: Find out exactly how much energy your existing
home uses by hiring a qualified professional energy auditor. An energy audit
is a very detailed examination of your home, how you and your family
use it, and your utility bill history. You can expect the auditor to take a
look at every room in the house and carry out a blower door test to
identify where your home is leaking air (and therefore energy) and a
thermographic (or infrared video or still camera) test to identify where
your home is losing heat.
To find a professional energy auditor, talk to a representative at your
local utility company or your state or local energy office. You also can
check the Internet or phone book listings under “energy” or “energy audit.”
Make sure that you obtain references from the auditor that you’re consid-
ering hiring, and — as always when hiring any kind of home contractor —
check with your local Better Business Bureau to find out if any complaints
have been made against the company and whether those complaints
have been resolved satisfactorily.
Your auditor will let you know not only how your house measures up in
terms of energy efficiency but also what you can do to make it better.
Armed with the advice that you get either from a rough estimate or a 
professional energy audit, you can select the measures that will make the
most difference and fit within your budget.

Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

Warming up to the idea of alternative
energy sources
The ultimate in green construction and renovation is to generate your own
power and heat from renewable or alternative energy sources. (Chapters 1 and 2
explain why these energy sources are so important for the future of the planet.)
The method you choose — solar, wind, hydro, biomass, or geothermal —
depend on your site, climate, and local building codes or zoning regulations. It
also depends on whether you want your home to be totally off-grid (independent
from local utilities) or not: In many cases, off-grid homes use a combination
of alternative energy sources.
Alternative energy systems cost more to install upfront than conventional
energy systems, and they can take decades to pay back that cost by producing
free or almost free energy. The initial cost remains a huge roadblock for many
people, but the good news is that, as demand increases for these systems, more
research is being done into better and less expensive technology. Prices for
alternative energy systems are already coming down, and experts predict that
in coming years, assuming that prices of oil, gas, and electricity continue to rise,
alternative energy sources will become even more economical. You may even
be able to get some financial assistance for installing green energy alternatives
(see the later section, “Financing Green Construction or Improvements,” for
advice on that topic).
The most easily adapted alternative energy sources in urban areas are solar
power, especially for your water heating needs, and biomass. In rural areas,
your options are generally wider because you have more land on which to
place the infrastructure, and you likely have fewer building restrictions. You
can find more information about all these technologies at
www.eere.energy.gov and later in this chapter.
Always consult your local government’s planning commission for more
information before you go forward with plans for residential alternative energy
sources, often called small scale energy generation. You need to get planning
and building permission, which may involve giving your neighbors a chance to
object. Understanding the process involved is crucial to a successful project.
Even if you’re not able to generate all the power and heat your household
needs using alternative energy, the more you use, the less fossil fuels you
burn and the fewer greenhouse gas emissions you’re responsible for.
66
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Upgrading to a green heating 
and cooling system
Because heating and cooling your house (depending on your geographical
location and the season) can require a lot of energy and thus produce signifi-
cant amounts of greenhouse gases, it makes sense to do all that you can to
take advantage of the Earth’s natural heating and cooling effects, from the
sun to the ground. This section covers passive solar, solar thermal, biomass,
and geothermal energy options; you also can check out Chapter 5 for quick
and easy tips (ones that don’t require big renovations) to make your home
more energy efficient.
Passive solar energy
If you’re building a new home — and to a certain degree if you’re renovating
your existing home — you can give it a head start on energy efficiency by
taking advantage of passive solar energy. At its most basic application, that
simply means using the power of the sun to heat your home by letting the
sun’s rays shine through your windows.
When making plans to build, first design your home so that it sits on the lot
with its longest side facing south or southwest. This placement gives your
home the greatest possible exposure to the sun’s warmth. Depending on your
lot size and local building code regulations, you may need to come up with a
compromise, but choosing a lot that will suit this placement definitely helps.
When your house is ideally positioned, you can proceed with the following plans:
 Consider putting glass doors and even a glass sunroom on south-facing
walls to significantly increase the temperature of the whole house on
sunny days.
 Design your window placement so that the windows on the south-facing
exposure are generously sized, and limit the windows on the north-
facing exposure.
 Ensure that windows allow for cross-ventilation within the home by placing
some of them on walls that the prevailing breezes will hit and then by
providing an unobstructed airflow within the home to windows on the
opposite side of the house.
 Design your interior layout so that the living areas are on the south-
facing side and foyers, hallways, bathrooms, and dining rooms are on
the north-facing side.
67
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

Passive solar energy isn’t so much about generating power as trapping the
power of the sun, allowing you to rely less on other energy sources. You can
boost the way your home stores the passive solar energy by using dark-col-
ored floorings that absorb the sun’s heat more than they reflect it. Dark floor-
ings such as dark tile then emit the heat back into the space even after the
sun has set.
Use design factors such as the home’s roofline angle and profile or awnings
or shutters to shield windows and doors to keep the indoor temperatures
down during the summer. Take a look at Figure 4-1: This house takes advantage
of passive solar energy (keeping the house cooler) but allows the winter sun
(which is at a lower angle on the horizon) to shine in and warm living areas. In
winter, you may need to close heavy curtains at night to stop heat escaping
and making your home too cold. Planting deciduous trees also can help regulate
the temperature inside the home because their leaves shade windows during
the summer without blocking winter sunlight.
Solar thermal panels
Solar thermal panels, which can be installed on rooftops or near your house
depending on how much room you have, convert the sun’s rays into heat, which
is transferred into your home through pipes often using a water-glycol mixture.
The heat is transferred into a storage tank in your home, and the mixture returns
to the solar thermal panel to be heated again (see Figure 4-2). The heat in the
storage tank can be transferred to water, producing hot water whenever you
need it. It also can be transferred to radiant heating systems (such as under
flooring) or forced-air heating systems to heat the house. The energy
produced by solar thermal panels is also known as active solar energy.
Figure 4-1:
A passive
solar house
design.
68
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

The amount of hot water you get from a solar thermal system depends on the
size of the panels and how much sun is around. It also depends on the climate,
the model of heater, how much hot water you need, and the size of your hot
water tank. Not surprisingly, the more panels you install, the more water you
can heat in this way. Harnessing active solar energy is very practical for sunny
climates: If you visit the Mediterranean region, for example, you’ll see solar
thermal panels on many rooftops. You can use the system for all your heat
and hot water needs if it’s large enough, or you can back the system up with a
gas- or oil-fired water heater.
Burning biomass
Biomass is renewable organic material that can be burned to produce energy.
It’s all around you in fast-growing trees like willow and poplar and in organic
byproducts such as wood chips, the straw left after harvesting crops, manure,
and litter from poultry farms. If you think about it, your ancestors burned bio-
mass to heat water and do their cooking, and many people in the developing
world still do this. The most common forms for biomass use in your home are
logs, wood chips, or pellets that you use to fuel a wood-burning or biomass-
burning stove.

Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

This kind of biomass meets the renewable standard because as you burn one
lot, another lot is being grown. The beauty of biomass is that when burned,
the carbon dioxide released is equal to the amount of carbon dioxide the
plants took out of the atmosphere while growing. Then the new plants that
are growing absorb the carbon dioxide released by the burning process,
making biomass the ultimate in renewable power sources if the source of the
fuel is managed sustainably. Of course, if you’re burning byproducts such as
wood chips, it’s an even greener process because you’re using a product that
would otherwise be considered waste.
The stove in which you burn biomass needs to be EPA-approved. The approval
certifies that the stove produces 90 percent less particulates and emissions
than non-EPA stoves. Approved stoves also give you longer burn times and
are safer.
Geothermal systems
Geothermal systems — often referred to as ground-source heat pumps — work
by transferring the heat that naturally occurs within the ground to your
house (see Figure 4-3). It works because the ground maintains a relatively
constant temperature year-round. You can use one of several different
approaches to capture the heat; they are as follows:
 Pipes can be run horizontally in the ground over a fairly large distance.
This is a closed-loop system because the liquid in the pipes continues to
make the loop over and over again.
 Pipes can be run vertically into the ground, covering a similar distance
to a horizontal layout but with a smaller surface footprint. This is a
closed-loop system.
 Pipes can be run into a body of water such as a pond. This is an open-
loop system because it actually takes water from the pond and then
returns it to the pond.
In all types of geothermal systems, the heat from the ground is transferred
into storage tanks in your home, where it’s used for domestic hot water or for
radiant or even forced-air heating systems. In some cases, the heat is boosted
through reverse refrigeration technology (the compressor system in a fridge
works by cooling the air flowing through it; this uses the reverse in order to
heat it). Geothermal systems also can deliver effective air conditioning
during hot weather as well as heat during cold weather.
70
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Producing your own electrical energy
It’s not just heating and cooling systems that can go green with alternative
energy sources: You can actually generate your own power, too, using tech-
nology such as photovoltaic (solar) panels, wind turbines, or even water-driven
systems. In this section, we discuss the most common alternative energy sources
and how easy it is to install them. It’s usually most economical to design them
into a house that you’re building or to incorporate them into a major renovation
that you may be planning. Of course, you also need to be living in an area that
gets either enough sunlight, wind, or water to make them feasible.
Photovoltaic panels
Photovoltaic panels convert the sun’s rays (specifically, its flow of electrons)
into general purpose electrical energy that’s run through an inverter inside
the house so that it can be used by lighting and appliances in your home.
Photovoltaic solar power is also known as direct solar energy. Because the
sun and your panels may be generating more energy than your home needs
at any one time, solar power systems give you a couple of options for the excess
electricity. For example, you can install a battery “bank” to store the energy
until you need it, such as on a cloudy day when your system isn’t producing
enough power for your needs. (The number of batteries you install depends on
how much power you want to have as backup.) If your local power utility

from the

home.
71
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

provides this as an option, you also can install an electrical metering system
that feeds your extra power into the regional power grid — you’ll see this on
your utility bill as a credit.
The photovoltaic panels, which look like large sheets of dark glass, are gener-
ally placed on a south-facing exposure either on frames near the house or on
the house itself (attached to the wall or roof, for example). Especially in urban
areas, the system you’re able to install may be limited by the orientation of
your home and the size of your lot; in some cases, it may not be practical at all
because you may not be able to angle the panels to maximize the sunlight
they receive. It’s often easier to install these systems in rural areas where, if
you don’t want to or can’t put the panels on the roof or walls, you can install
them nearby instead. The size of your system (that is, the number of panels)
depends on how much of your home’s electricity you want to generate.
This is an exciting time for solar power: New methods incorporate the photo-
voltaic technology right into building components such as windows, roofing,
and even paint, so you can expect photovoltaic technology to become even
more widely available and practical for all house locations in the next five to
ten years. In addition, small photovoltaic panels are increasingly being used
in items such as outdoor lighting, burglar alarms, and cellphone chargers, so
even if it’s not practical to install a large house-wide system, you may be able
to use the technology in single applications instead.
Capturing the wind
Wind turbines produce energy when the wind catches the turbine’s blades
and rotates the axis on which the blades turn. The rotation runs through a
generator, which produces electricity that you can then use in your home.
The number of turbines that you install depends on the amount of electricity
that you want to generate, local building regulations that may limit the use of
wind turbines, your geographical location (especially local wind conditions),
and your house or lot design. Turbines come in two basic types:
 Horizontal axis: The blades’ axle runs at a right angle to the tower on which
it’s mounted, which means that the axle is horizontal. In a residential
setting, this kind of turbine is a much smaller version of the towers you
see in large wind farm developments, and the tower’s usually mounted a
short distance from your home.
 Vertical axis: The axle runs vertically instead of horizontally. For homes,
these small turbines look like whirligig roof vents or eggbeaters and usually
are mounted on the roof.
72
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Some people argue that wind turbines are noisy and a blight on the landscape.
You can forestall neighbors’ complaints by choosing one of the very small
and quiet, possibly roof-mounted (vertical axis) models that are now coming
onto the market. Other people want to see more turbines built as quickly as
possible to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and imported gas. While
the debate goes on, you can install your own: Expect it to generate a portion
of your energy needs rather than all, especially if you’re in an urban area
where you may be limited as to the type, size, and number of turbines that
you can install.
As with solar photovoltaic systems (see the preceding section), you can install
batteries to store excess wind power for use later (perhaps when the wind isn’t
blowing so strongly) and electrical metering systems that feed any excess
power back into the regional power grid to provide you with a credit on your
bill. Wind systems also can be combined with solar systems to serve as back-
ups for each other; this arrangement is especially useful in rural locations
where you have the space to install the technology and where it may not be
practical (or you may not want) to be connected to the regional power grid.
Extracting energy from flowing water
Micro-hydro systems are generally restricted to rural areas where water flow
through property allows you to pipe water via gravity to a turbine. The rota-
tion of the turbine generates electricity, which can be stored in batteries or
used immediately. Micro-hydro systems are one of the least popular forms of
alternative energy, not because they don’t work (they’re a smaller form of
large hydro dam projects, after all) but because they’re so site-specific.
73
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling
Buying and selling green electricity
If you can’t produce your own energy from wind
or solar power, it’s still possible to be a green
energy consumer. Buy electricity produced
from renewable wind, solar, and hydro power
sources. Most electrical utilities now have
green energy options that you can purchase.
If you install your own green power electricity
generator and produce more power than you
can use or store, you may be able to connect to
the regional electricity grid and sell your surplus
electricity to the grid. The equipment needed for
this arrangement increases your start-up costs,
but it can help create efficiencies and savings
over the long term. Talk to your local electricity
provider to find out how best to achieve this in
your area.

Conserving Water by Design
Rainwater and greywater systems can go a long way to reducing your con-
sumption of municipal or well water. Greywater is water that you’ve already
used for washing, laundry, or showering. Think about how you use water in your
home: Toilet flushing, for example, doesn’t require highly treated municipal
water. Using rainwater or greywater as appropriate for a variety of household
functions (from toilet flushing and laundry to watering landscaping) conserves
not only water but also the energy used to process it.
Rainwater harvesting systems range from simple rain barrels that collect
rainwater from gutter systems to more complex systems that collect rainwater,
store it in an underground cistern, and return it to the house for use in toilets
and laundry (see Figure 4-4). Rainwater cisterns can be constructed of plastic
or concrete and usually are buried to keep them from taking up too much room
in your yard and to take advantage of gravity to feed the water into them. If
you’re using a cistern system and returning collected rainwater to the house
for use in toilets and laundry, you may need a purification or filtration system.
If you’re simply using the rainwater for landscaping, there’s no reason to
purify it: Install a tap at the bottom of a rain barrel, and you have an accessi-
ble source of water for plants. You also can install a pump in the barrel to
feed a soaker or sprinkler hose. Rain barrels are widely available from hard-
ware stores, municipal environmental programs, other retail outlets, and on
the Internet.
Figure 4-4:

74
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

If you’re implementing a greywater system (see Figure 4-5), you definitely
need a purification or filtration system: These more complex options require
a professional to design the system so that it’s both safe and long-lasting.
Many areas regulate or even prohibit the use of rainwater or greywater systems,
so it’s essential to check with your state or county government before planning
anything more complex than a rain barrel at the end of your downspout.
You can find more information about rainwater and greywater systems on the
state of Florida’s Web site: www.dep.state.fl.us/water/reuse/
index.htm.
If you’re seriously green and your local building code allows it, you can install
a composting or incinerating toilet in your home. These either break down
waste into compost using organic processes or burn it into a small amount of
ash. Once huge and rather ugly, modern systems are considerably smaller
and less unattractive. When properly maintained, they don’t cause odors or
health risks. To find systems and contractors appropriate for your area, enter
“composting toilet” or “incinerating toilet” into an Internet search engine and
see where the companies operate.

Choosing Green Materials
Using green materials in building or renovating your home helps to protect
the environment while also avoiding products that may be harmful to the
occupants of your home. As long as they’ve been grown and manufactured in
an environmentally friendly way, natural materials offer green alternatives to
materials based on petrochemicals such as the foam used as filler in many
pieces of upholstered furniture. Soybeans, for example, are now being used
as filler for mattresses and cushions for one-third less global warming emis-
sions than its petrochemical cousin. Other green fillers include untreated
organic cotton and organic wool. Although green materials can be more
expensive than conventional ones, the prices are decreasing as demand
increases. And in many cases, the lifecycle costs of green materials — mean-
ing the savings in maintenance, energy efficiency, and durability over their
lifetime — is lower in the long run.
It’s not just the product and the raw material that should be green — it’s also
the manufacturing process. The greenest processes minimize energy or water
use, don’t use chemical pesticides or fertilizer, and produce low or no emis-
sions or pollutants. Suppliers should be carbon neutral, and waste should
leave the smallest possible footprint.
Building and renovating homes can generate a great deal of waste. To divert
as much construction waste as possible from landfills, consider how much
can be reused or recycled. Items such as lumber that you bought but didn’t
use — and can’t return to the store — can be donated to local nonprofit agen-
cies such as Habitat for Humanity. The same goes for items such as kitchen
cabinets that you tear out: If you can remove them carefully, they can be
reused by someone else. (The process of taking a house apart so that its
components can be reused is known as deconstruction.) To find out what can
be diverted from your waste, check with local building associations or gov-
ernment waste offices. You can find a list of local programs at www.epa.gov/
epaoswer/non-hw/debris-new/index.htm, along with excellent back-
ground information about construction waste issues.
Sourcing materials for your construction or renovation project from recyclers
and salvagers operating in your area is both green and economical: Items in
good shape can cost far less than new ones.
Considering frame construction materials
Wood is a renewable resource, but it’s one of the natural resources that’s
used at a much faster rate than it grows. Reducing the number of trees on the
earth affects air quality and influences global warming. For a home construc-
tion or renovation project, use as little wood as possible and either source it
76
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

from material that’s been recycled or reused or source it from suppliers
accredited by the Forest Stewardship Council (www.fsc.org).
Both Home Depot (www.homedepot.com) and IKEA (www.ikea.com) are
committed to using wood from only FSC-accredited suppliers. You can find a
good explanation of wood sourcing at www.greenpeace.org/usa/
campaigns/forests.
Along with lumber from sustainable forests, consider lumber alternatives. Some
innovative options include composite wood made from reclaimed hardwood
sawdust and plastic formed from reclaimed or recycled plastic. If you’re using
antique lumber, do your best to find out where it came from: It’s great to reuse
wood that would otherwise be thrown out, but it shouldn’t come from historic
buildings that could have been preserved instead. One novel option is to use
lumber salvaged from lakes and rivers. When lumber is floated downstream to a
mill, a few logs inevitably sink, and companies now dive to find and recover that
lumber.
You also can use alternative building systems such as straw bales and
rammed earth to build a well-insulated, energy-efficient, naturally sourced
green home. There’s a whole wealth of information on the latest green build-
ing technologies on the Internet. Type “building a green home” into your
favorite search engine and you’ll find more information than you can imagine.
Also check out www.sustlife.com, a not-for-profit Web site promoting sus-
tainable living.
Consider these options for using natural materials in different parts of your
home construction or renovation project:
 Flooring: Among the natural options are tile, hardwood, organic wool
carpeting, jute (especially for backing), sisal, cork (harvested from living
trees), bamboo, linoleum (made from linseed oil, which comes from flax),
and marmoleum (a type of linoleum).
A fast-growing grass, bamboo is definitely a renewable crop, but it’s
important to find out how it’s grown and processed in order to fully
qualify it as green. In some areas, bamboo is replacing local vegetation,
and when it’s turned into fabric for textiles and clothing, the processes
may use chemical solvents and therefore not be so environmentally
friendly.
 Tiles: Floor and wall tiles can now be made of recycled glass and porcelain.
Even regular ceramic and porcelain tiles offer the advantage of low toxicity.
 Walls: You can buy gypsum and fiberboard made of recycled material
such as gypsum and waste paper.
 Roofs: Recycled shingles, metal roofing, and rubber tiles are alternatives
to asphalt shingles.
77
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

Finding green insulation
If you’re building a new house or renovating an older one to the point where
your interior or exterior surfaces are exposed, you have an opportunity to
improve the insulation not just in accessible areas such as attics but through-
out the home, inside and out.
Adding insulation is, by itself, a very green measure for your home because it
increases energy efficiency. However, some insulations aren’t especially green
in terms of content. Fiberglass batt insulation, for example, often contains
recycled materials but also may contain formaldehyde and is well known for
its ability to irritate breathing passages with direct contact. Also, many types
of rigid board insulation are made from polystyrene, which is produced using
petrochemicals.
Greener insulation choices include the following:
 Cellulose: Manufactured from fire-retarded recycled newspaper, this
loose-fill insulation is blown into attics and walls. It requires much less
energy to manufacture than fiberglass and mineral wool insulation.
 Cotton: Available in both batts and loose fill, cotton insulation is based
on a renewable resource and can contain upwards of 70 percent recycled
content. Unless farmed organically, however, the cotton used in insulation
can consume significant water and pesticides while growing.
 Soy: Most spray-on foams use a petrochemical-based product; however,
a soybean alternative has been developed that decreases the petro-
chemicals involved.
Although insulating concrete forms (ICFs) and structural insulated panels (SIPs)
incorporate polystyrene, both products are worth considering in a new green
home. Both methods create the home’s walls, combining strength and insula-
tion at the same time. ICFs involve foam blocks that are placed one on top of
the other and then filled in the center with concrete. SIPs have a core of poly-
styrene between layers of oriented strand board. The advantage of both
methods is a very well-sealed and well-insulated home that can significantly
reduce energy consumption.
Insulation and ventilation are linked inextricably when it comes to indoor air
quality in your home. If you seal your house up with great insulation but
don’t allow for adequate ventilation, your home’s air will become stale and
moisture-laden, which can lead to odors and mold and mildew growth. Many
new, well-insulated homes incorporate an air exchanger such as a heat recov-
ery ventilator. This mechanism ensures that the indoor air is exchanged regu-
larly with outdoor air, and it incorporates technology that allows part of the
outgoing indoor air’s heat to transfer to the incoming outdoor air in order to
boost energy efficiency.

Putting on the finishing touches
To avoid VOCs, look for paints and stains whose labels say that they have
low or no VOCs. The most eco-sensitive paints are water-based (acrylic)
paints with fewer chemical additives and toxic materials, no animal testing,
and recycled packaging. You may opt for natural wood finishes (linseed oil,
for example) instead of chemical-based finishes.
You can further reduce the VOCs in your home by choosing solid wood
instead of particleboard (which is held together by glue) and by choosing
natural materials such as cotton, wool, hemp, and soy instead of chemical-
based options. Refer to the section “Reducing volatile organic compounds”
earlier in this chapter for more ideas on how to combat VOCs.
Using fasteners such as screws or nails instead of glue in items such as furni-
ture saves the VOCs that the glue would emit. Screws are the greenest option
because at the end of the furniture’s life, you can remove the screws easily to
enable the wood to be reused.
Financing Green Home Construction 
or Improvements
If you want to build a green home, buy and renovate a derelict building to
become a green home, or adapt your own home to be more green through a
major renovation, chances are good that you need a mortgage — a loan
secured against the property concerned. Until recently, green mortgages —
known as Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) — weren’t very common.
However, they’re gaining more widespread acceptance from mainstream
financial institutions. If you don’t need a mortgage but could still use some
financial help, we offer a couple of other options for you to investigate,
including tax credits, grants, and other financing avenues.
79
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling
Not much yard space? Put your garden on the roof!
If you have a flat roof, consider making it green
by sealing it, adding earth or planters, and
growing a garden. Green roofs reduce water
runoff into storm sewer systems, decrease
urban temperatures, and even can produce fruit
and vegetables. Find more information at
www.greenroofs.org.

In addition, some lenders are concerned enough about the environment that
they provide special bonuses for ecologically minded homeowners. Bonuses
include offering energy rating inspections, carbon offset programs, or tree
plantings to compensate for home energy use.
Tax credits or grants
You may be able to apply for tax credits or grants to help with the cost of
making your home more energy efficient. The following programs may be
able to help:
 Federal tax credits: The IRS offers tax credits for certain energy-efficiency,
solar energy, fuel cell, and microturbine system improvements; however,
the credits have varying eligibility dates and may be extended or changed
as energy efficiency continues to be a government priority. Check www.
irs.gov for the latest information.
 Home weatherization help: Low-income families can receive assistance
with making their homes more energy efficient through the Weatherization
Assistance Program at www.eere.energy.gov/weatherization.
 State, local, and utility incentives: Check with your state and local
government to find out about energy-efficiency and environmentally
friendly programs. California, for example, offers a tax credit for rainwater
harvesting systems. Your local energy supplier or water supplier also
may have special incentives for reducing consumption.
Of course, these grants and credits may not be enough to help fund your home
improvements. In that case, your best bet may be an Energy Efficient Mortgage
(EEM, sometimes known in this case as an Energy Improvement Mortgage),
which we discuss in the next section.
Energy Efficient Mortgages
Energy Efficient Mortgages, or EEMs, are insured by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, or HUD (www.hud.gov), and issued through
regular lending institutions. They’re part of the federal government’s initiative
to help Americans reduce their energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
 If you’re buying an existing home and renovating it for energy 
efficiency, an EEM allows you to include the cost of the energy-efficient
improvements — up to 15 percent of the total mortgage amount — in
the mortgage. The money for the improvements is held in escrow until
it’s needed to pay for them.
80
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 If you’re remodeling your home for energy efficiency, you may qualify
for an EEM if you refinance your home to pay for the energy-efficient
improvements. If you already have a conventional mortgage on your
home and you think an EEM mortgage may be available, check the
paperwork to find out what kind of penalty you’ll pay to switch your
mortgage, and consult your financial advisor to find out if the savings
offered by a green mortgage make the penalty worth paying.
 If you’re buying a new home, you can request an EEM mortgage if your
builder is part of an energy-efficiency certification program or if the
house passes a home energy rating inspection.
If your lender can’t help or doesn’t offer green mortgages, look for one that
does at www.socialinvest.org/directory.
The key difference between a regular mortgage and a green mortgage is that
the green variety requires a home energy rating. If the builder isn’t part of a
recognized energy certification program, you need to arrange for a qualified
inspector to conduct an on-site inspection. This is similar to an energy audit,
but it’s conducted according to nationally recognized standards for home 
ratings.
The inspection costs between $200 and $400 depending on the size of your
home. Expect it to take several hours, during which the inspector assesses
different parts of the building — including doors, windows, insulation, heat-
ing and cooling systems, and airtightness — for energy efficiency. You end up
with a rating on a scale of 1 to 100 that’s translated into a star rating (think of
it like a movie review): One star isn’t very efficient; five stars is very efficient.
The rating also provides you with your estimated energy costs.
When you get the rating, you also receive house-specific details that let you
see where improvements can be made cost effectively, helping you plan reno-
vations that will provide the most energy savings. In the case of a new home,
your rating may simply prove that your home qualifies for an EEM. For more
information about home energy ratings, visit www.resnet.us.
You may qualify for more house with an EEM than with a conventional mort-
gage because the EEM incorporates into the loan qualification calculations
the fact that your utility bills will be lower thanks to the energy-efficient
improvements. And the improvements that you make may increase your
home’s value, too, making it worth more than similar homes that aren’t
energy efficient.
81
Chapter 4: Green Building and Remodeling

Other loan options
Your other option for funding the green renovation of an existing home may be
a home-equity-based loan or line of credit. With these loans, the lender takes
into account your home’s equity — the difference between your mortgage
amount and the value of your home. Depending on your financial situation, you
may qualify for funding that’s secured by the home’s equity. In the case of a loan,
you agree to pay back the funding in specific amounts at specific times (monthly,
biweekly, and so on). A line of credit is more flexible, allowing you to choose how
much you pay back each month (it usually requires you to pay at least the inter-
est amount for the month); you have some flexibility when finances are tight
during the renovation and then can pay back the loaned amount as quickly as
you want when finances aren’t as tight (paying it back quickly can reduce the
amount of interest you’re charged).

D
eveloping green habits around your home can reduce your impact on
the environment in a major way — and they come with some great side
benefits. Choosing environmentally friendly fabrics and products can help
you maintain your health as well, and switching off a few lights or appliances
can lower your utility bills. Best of all, being green at home doesn’t have to
cost much at all, so even if your budget doesn’t allow building or renovating
your home to fit a green lifestyle (as described in Chapter 4), you can still
make a healthier home and contribute to a healthier planet.
This chapter provides tips and tricks for eco-friendly living in your home.
From your home’s biggest energy draws (heating and cooling) to more 
moderate ones (various home appliances), we tell you what to pay attention
to and how to reduce your impact on the environment. We also cover natural
alternatives to chemical-filled household products and items that you’re
likely to use daily. Add a little water conservation (or a lot!) and some simple
changes that you can make around the house, and this chapter is chock-full
of useful information for greening up your home.

The Most Effective Change You Can
Make: Green Heating and Cooling
To employ big-bang-for-your-buck green strategies at home, start with your
heating and cooling system as well as your water heating system. Families 
in the United States typically spend more than $1,600 on utility bills every
year, so there’s plenty of room to reduce both bills and energy use, even if
replacing your furnace, water heater, or windows with higher-efficiency
models isn’t in the budget for a few years.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), approximately
four metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per year are emitted from
people’s homes as a result of electricity use, heating, and waste — that’s
about 17 percent of the nation’s total emissions.
Managing your home’s temperature
Many living areas in homes are hotter than they need to be in winter and
cooler than they need to be in summer. Sure you want to be comfortable, 
but a few degrees difference here or there isn’t as noticeable temperature-
wise as you may think. This section shares some easy ways to manage the
temperature inside your home in a better, smarter way.
Check with the U.S. Department of Energy for more tips on using less energy
and keeping the bills down at www.energysavers.gov.
Adjustments you can make any time of year
Whether it’s spring, summer, fall, or winter, some energy-saving tips work 
all year long. In this section, we focus on making sure that your home isn’t
leaking warmed or cooled air and on techniques that you can use to reduce
your need for heating and cooling.
Try the following actions to save energy year-round:
 Add weather-stripping to doors and windows.
 Tuck insulating foam inserts behind switch plates and face plates of
electrical outlets on exterior walls. These products are readily available
at home improvement centers.
 Install awnings that shade windows in summer but retract in winter 
to let you take advantage of the sun’s warmth.
 Plant deciduous trees (that lose their leaves in winter) to shade the
house in summer and let sunlight through in winter.
84
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Control the amount of heating or cooling going into rooms in your
home that you’re not using by fully or partially closing the forced-air
registers, for example. Don’t completely block off the heating in 
particular, because you don’t want anything to freeze.
 Use kitchen and bathroom ventilating fans as little as possible to
avoid sending too much heated or cooled air out of the house.
During the hot season
Sweltering outside temperatures can make sleeping, working, and even 
doing chores in the house downright unpleasant. Air conditioning can make a
huge difference in how much you enjoy your days and nights in your home —
as long as you use it to gain the maximum possible comfort in the most
energy-efficient way.
Take these measures to keep your cool during the hot season:
 Set your thermostat to about 78 degrees when you’re in the house
during the day, and turn the air conditioning off completely when
you’re away from the house for an extended period, such as 
when you’re on vacation.
 Take advantage of cooler night air if possible (and safe) by turning off
the air conditioning and opening your windows overnight or at least 
in the evening and early morning. Open them at strategic points around
the house to allow a flow of air.
 To reduce solar heating during the hot months, keep window coverings
closed during the heat of the day.
 If you need air conditioning and don’t have a central air system, install
window air conditioners in north-facing or shaded windows so that
they don’t fight the sunlight.
During the cold season
Keeping your home warm during the winter is absolutely critical, not only 
for your own comfort but also for your home’s well-being: Without sufficient
heat, water pipes can freeze and burst, and building materials can become
stressed. Luckily, easy actions take advantage of the sun’s natural warmth
and your furnace in order to keep your heating bills and energy use down.
Try these tips to keep your heating bills down but your house warm:
 Set your thermostat to no more than about 70 to 72 degrees when
you’re in the house during the day, and set it to 65 degrees at 
night and when you’re away from the house (such as at work or on
vacation). Every degree that you lower the thermostat will save you
approximately 3 percent on your heating bill. A programmable thermo-
stat is the easiest way to manage these temperatures automatically, but
you can reset the thermostat manually if you need to — it just takes a
little more commitment.
85
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

Turn the temperature down if you have a house full of people, perhaps
for a party; body heat really warms things up.
 Open curtains and blinds on sun-facing windows during the day.
Conversely, close curtains and blinds at night to reduce the heat that’s
lost through the windows. You also can purchase heavy, insulating 
curtains at department stores; these curtains help to keep indoor heat
from escaping through the windows.
 Block any fireplaces and chimneys that you don’t use to prevent
heated air from escaping and drafts of cold air blowing down. You
also can buy a chimney balloon, which acts like an inflatable pillow, to
install in the chimney (above the damper); it stops drafts, reduces heat
loss, and saves you money. Check out www.chimneyballoon.us.
 When you turn the heating thermostat down at night, put an extra
blanket on the bed, or take a hot water bottle to bed rather than 
leaving an electric blanket turned on all night.
Maintaining the efficiency of 
furnaces and air conditioners
Regular maintenance of furnaces and air conditioners helps to keep them
working at top efficiency. Maintenance not only reduces your energy use and
thus saves you money on a monthly basis, but also it lengthens the life of 
the equipment, which lets you keep your money in your wallet longer. And, 
of course, the less energy you use, the more eco-friendly you are.
The following actions can help you get the most from your furnaces and air
conditioners for the least possible cost:
 Replace filters. This is the most effective maintenance task as well as
the easiest. Dirty filters restrict effective air movement through the
appliance, which makes the motors work harder, which in turn burns
more fuel. Replace your filters monthly, particularly if you have pets in
the house, if you live in a dusty area, or if you’re renovating.
 Have the units professionally cleaned and serviced annually. Regular
service protects against dust buildup that can damage sensitive parts
and shorten the appliance’s lifespan.
 Check ductwork for leaks. This recommendation applies to you if your
system runs on forced air and you can easily see or access at least some
of the ductwork. When the system fan is on, run your hand, a sheet of
thin paper, or even the smoke from an incense stick beside the ducts.
Look or feel for air leaks around joints and seams. Seal seams with 
heat-resistant tape (not your everyday duct tape).
86
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Have the ducts professionally cleaned once every three to five years.
Go with greater frequency if you live in a dusty area or you have pets,
and also have the ducts cleaned after you move into a new home or after
major renovations. The cleaning helps to reduce the dust that’s blown
through your home, which helps to keep the furnace filter clean, in turn
helping the furnace to operate more efficiently. Between duct cleanings,
vacuum forced-air registers occasionally to keep them clean.
 Don’t block forced-air registers, radiators, and other heating and cool-
ing system components. Make sure that they’re not tucked away behind
furniture, curtains, or other heat-blockers. Clearing the way helps to
ensure good air circulation, which improves system efficiency and room
comfort as well as helps to prevent mold and mildew growth. If your
system runs on radiators, you can buy heat reflectors to place between
the walls and the radiators in order to direct the heat into the room.
Making Appliances More Efficient 
and Eco-Friendly
From the kitchen to the laundry room to the basement or utility room, you
have appliances throughout your home — appliances that often get forgotten
until they suddenly break down (usually at the most inconvenient time 
possible!). Keeping them clean and well-maintained helps them to function
more efficiently for longer periods of time, so it’s well worth spending a little
quality time with items such as your oven, fridge, water heater, dishwasher,
and laundry appliances.
If you have to buy new appliances (perhaps because you’re upgrading to
greener options), give away older models to people who will use them —
friends, members of the Freecycle Network (see Chapter 19), or nonprofit
groups, for example. If something isn’t broken, it should be reused and 
recycled rather than dumped in a landfill.
Water heater
Tucked away in the garage, basement, or utility room, water heaters are 
the most common appliances to be forgotten until they go on the fritz.
There’s not a lot that you can do in terms of cleaning the interior of your
water heater, but you can take measures to limit how hard it has to work.
Energy-saving measures for water heaters include the following:
87
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

 Check that the setting on your water heater isn’t overheating your
water. A setting that’s unnecessarily high not only wastes energy but
also creates a scalding risk, particularly for young children and the
elderly. It’s generally accepted that 120 degrees suits most uses, but
double check the owner’s manual for your dishwasher, which may
require a higher setting (most newer dishwashers don’t).
Don’t set your water heater thermostat too low (below 115 degrees) for
regular use. In some cases, this can lead to the growth of mold within
the water heater.
 Wrap the first six feet of pipe leading out of your water heater with
insulating foam. Heat is lost from hot water when it sits in the pipes
waiting to be used. Wrapping part of the pipe partially reduces this heat
loss, potentially giving you hot water faster.
 Wrap the water heater in a foil blanket for insulation. If your water
heater is more than a decade old, its insulation may be letting some of
the heat inside the tank escape before it ever reaches your faucets. 
A foil blanket, which you can find at home centers, prevents heat loss,
but follow the instructions very carefully when you install it to avoid
blocking vents or controls. Check your heater’s instructions to ensure
that adding insulation is permitted for your model.
Cleaning appliances
Your cleaning appliances for clothes and dishes save you some serious 
hard work; take care of these labor savers, and they’ll take care of you for
longer. Because these are big-ticket items, taking care of them helps you out
in the pocketbook, but it’s also good for the environment. Maintaining these
appliances and using them efficiently reduces the amount of waste that’s 
generated and the number of new products that need to be manufactured.
Clothes washer and dryer
Clothes washers don’t require a great deal of maintenance, but there a few
steps that you can take to make sure that yours works properly. First, if it has
a lint filter or an area inside where lint builds up, make sure that you clean it
regularly to help the washer work more effectively. Also check the hoses and
their connections to the machine and the faucet: They should be replaced at
the first sign of wear (bulging, cracking, splitting, or leaking, for example)
because a worn hose can burst, pumping a great deal of water out onto the
floor in a very short period of time.
To keep your dryer working at top efficiency (and top safety), clean out the
lint filter after each load. Also check the dryer vent that exits your home to
make sure that it’s working properly; specifically, the vent shouldn’t be
blocked, and the flap should operate freely. Install wire screening over the
vent (if it’s not there already) to keep critters such as mice and squirrels out
of the vent and therefore out of the house.
88
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Follow these recommendations for making what’s perhaps one of your most
tedious chores more enjoyable because it’s earth-friendly:
 Wash your laundry in cold water. Up to 90 percent of the energy that
clothes washers use goes to heating up the water. Determine what can
be washed in either cold or warm water rather than hot. Even with a hot
or warm wash, choose a cold rinse.
For best results in cold water, use detergents that are designed for 
cold-water washes. See the later section “Laundering with eco-friendly
detergents” for more on detergent.
Stick to hot water for items such as sheets and towels, particularly if
someone in the family has been ill. Only hot water kills hangers-on such
as germs and dust mites.
 Do the laundry only when you have a full load. It’s easier to gather a
full load when you wash at lower water temperatures because you can
put colors together without the risk of color bleeding.
 Even with a full load, don’t overload the washing machine. If you do,
the clothes won’t move around freely enough to get clean, and you’ll end
up having to wash them again.
 Line-dry your clothes. The clothes dryer uses a significant amount of
energy and can actually shorten the life of your clothes because of
shrinkage and other wear and tear on the fabric. If you have the space,
hanging your clothes on a clothes line or drying rack or even hanging
them up on hangers to dry not only reduces dryer use but also helps
clothes last longer.
 If you need to use the dryer, make it as efficient as possible. Dry full
(not partial) loads only, and dry your clothes for the minimum time 
possible. Many newer-model clothes dryers use moisture sensors to
automatically cut the heat when the clothes are dry enough, and they
may also have cool down cycles in which they use the heat left in the
dryer to finish off the clothes. If yours has these features, take advan-
tage of them when you set the dryer to run. If not, stop the dryer just
before the clothes are completely dry and either hang them up or iron
them to finish drying.
 If you have to iron, do it when clothes are still slightly damp or use 
a spray bottle to dampen them rather than a steam iron. A steam iron
uses energy heating up the water in its tank.
Dishwasher
The big question when it comes to eco-friendly dishwashing is whether to
wash by hand or to use the dishwasher. In some cases (such as tough-to-clean
pots or fragile items), it’s an easy decision (grab that scrubber!), but what
about regular, everyday dishes?
89
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, an Energy Star-rated dishwasher
(www.energystar.gov) saves nearly 5,000 gallons of water a year compared
to washing dishes by hand and uses less than half as much energy, which can
cut utility bills by more than $40 a year. And it can save time: some 230 hours
a year, or nearly ten days that you could put to other uses.
Keep in mind that these figures are based on what average people do, so if
you’re very frugal with water when you wash dishes by hand, your water con-
sumption may be lower than the numbers considered “average” in the study.
It’s also likely that part of the hot water savings with automatic dishwashers 
is the fact that washing dishes by hand is often done two to three times per
day, whereas a dishwasher is run only once a day or even once every two or
three days.
Dishwashers have a clear advantage when it comes to temperature, however,
because the Energy Star models boost the water temperature quite efficiently
to levels that disinfect the dishes. This also means that you may be able to
reduce your water heater setting to 120 degrees rather than the 140 degrees
required by many older dishwashers. The greater efficiency of newer models
also means that you don’t have to pre-rinse your dishes.
On the flip side, it takes energy (and therefore carbon emissions) to manufac-
ture the dishwasher, and it’s likely that you’ll have to dispose of it some 
day. Even though many of its major elements can be recycled, that process
requires energy, and some parts will inevitably end up in the landfill.
If you go with the dishwasher over hand-washing, consider these recommen-
dations to reduce your environmental impact regardless of whether you have
an Energy Star dishwasher:
 Skip the pre-rinse if your dishwasher gets the dishes clean without it.
Scrape larger food particles into the trash or compost bucket if they’re
compostable (see Chapter 8 for more details about composting).
 Consult your owner’s manual for the way to place items in the dish-
washer for the most-efficient cleaning.
 Only run the dishwasher when it’s full.
 Use the dishwasher’s no-heat air-drying option if it has one. If it 
doesn’t, turn the dishwasher off as soon as it has finished washing,
before it starts the drying cycle.
 Clean out the drain filter monthly both to keep the dishwasher clean
and to maintain its efficiency. Many models have some kind of screen
at the bottom that lifts up so that you can clear out any large food 
particles or buildup.
If you’re not convinced that your dishwasher is more environmentally
friendly than your own two hands and some hot, soapy water, check out the
section “In the kitchen” later in this chapter for advice on ways to conserve
water while hand-washing your dishes.

Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Entertainment system
Big and loud isn’t always beautiful when it comes to the amount of energy used
in entertainment systems. Modern LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and high-
definition television sets, digital radios, and digital televisions use more energy
than smaller, older models with fewer functions. If you’re replacing an older
model, ask the retailer for details about energy consumption.
The less new equipment you buy, the more you reduce the total numbers that
will be manufactured, which decreases the damage the production process
causes. Think of the energy it takes to make a new item and how many poten-
tially damaging gases such as carbon dioxide were generated by the manufac-
turing process. (There’s more on carbon emissions in Chapters 1 and 2.)
To prevent using energy unnecessarily, don’t turn televisions, radios, and
music players on unless you’re listening to or watching them. Also consider
using solar- or crank-powered radios if you need a small music source at your
desk, for example (check out www.freeplayenergy.com for various models).
Food cooling and heating
Fridges, freezers, and ovens of various types have become essential parts 
of today’s homes. If you’re buying new appliances, always opt for Energy 
Star models if you can. Always make sure that you use and maintain your
appliances so that they operate at optimum efficiency.
Helping your fridge and freezer work best for you
The refrigerator is pretty essential in today’s world, but it doesn’t have to be
an energy guzzler or an environmental hazard. Try these strategies for making
the most of your fridge (and, by extension, your freezer):
 Get a smaller, more energy-efficient fridge. If possible, get an Energy
Star model.
 Buy nonperishable food that you can store in cupboards instead of in
the fridge or freezer.
If you’re within easy reach of a grocery store, you may find you don’t
need a freezer at all. But if you have to drive a considerable distance to
the store, or if you have a large family and time is at a premium, stocking
a freezer may be greener than using your car to shop more frequently.
 Keep the fridge and freezer doors closed as much as possible, and
when you open them, be quick.
 Consider relocating your fridge or freezer if it’s next to a heat source
such as the stove or dishwasher. Heat sources make the fridge or
freezer work harder to keep its interior cool.
91
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

 Use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner attachment to clean your fridge’s
condenser coils (which are either at the bottom or the back of the
fridge) every 6 to 12 months.
 Check fridge and freezer gaskets (the rubber seals around doors) to
make sure that they aren’t letting cold air leak out. A piece of paper
placed between the door and the appliance should be slightly difficult 
to pull out. If it’s not, look into replacing the gasket. (On some models,
you may be able to replace the gasket easily, but for many others, a pro
is the better way to go. Check your instruction manual and your fridge
to see if it’s within your skills or if you need to call a technician.)
 Set the thermostats in both the fridge and freezer to the optimum
energy-efficient temperatures (37 to 40 degrees for the fridge, 0 to 5
degrees for long-term freezer storage, and 10 to 15 degrees for short-
term freezer storage). If the temperatures are set any higher or lower,
the appliances use more energy unnecessarily.
 Defrost frozen food in the fridge instead of using the microwave or
running water over the food in the sink to thaw it out. Defrosting in
the fridge is also far safer from a food safety point of view.
Even though putting warm leftovers right into the fridge can make the fridge
work harder to cool the food, it’s better from a food safety approach not to
let leftovers cool on the counter.
Heating up your green food
It takes a lot of energy to heat up a large oven, so anything that you do to
either reduce or optimize your use of this appliance can help. These measures
are tried-and-true ways to do just that:
 Use small appliances in lieu of the oven. Both electric and gas ovens
draw a huge amount of power while they cook your food, although gas is
more efficient. Microwaves, toaster ovens, stove tops, slow cookers,
countertop roasters, and even broilers can be much more energy efficient
while still heating your food just fine.
 Preheat your electric oven for the minimum amount of time. Schedule
your prep work so that the oven’s not waiting at full temperature long
before you’re ready for it. Also resist the urge to open the door and peek
while your food’s cooking; the temperature drops between 25 and 75
degrees every time you open the oven door, which means that the oven
has to work harder to heat back up to temperature.
 When using the oven’s self-cleaning feature, do it right after you cook
something in the oven to take advantage of the heat that’s already built
up. The self-cleaning feature heats up the oven to a very high tempera-
ture to burn off food residue. Keep in mind that although the self-cleaning
feature consumes energy, it helps you to avoid the harsh chemicals in
many oven cleaners.
92
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 When you’re using the stove top, make sure that your pans fit the
burners. Using a small pan on a large burner wastes the heat generated
by the extra burner area.
 When boiling water on the stove top, save water and energy by using
only as much water as you need in the kettle rather than filling it up
each time.
Reducing your reliance on 
unnecessary appliances
It’s hard to live without some household appliances, but by reducing the
number that you use and changing the way you use them, you can become
greener — and save money on your bills.
Assess each of the appliances throughout your home — not just in the
kitchen — to determine how or even if you use it. If it could potentially 
save you money (a toaster oven, for example), improve your daily nutrition
(perhaps a juicer), or make your life a little happier (an old record player 
that lets you listen to those LPs you thought you’d forgotten!), get to the root
of why you’re not using it to its full potential. Is it difficult to clean, or is it
stored in a difficult-to-access place? Try to find a solution to the problem in
order to pull the full value from that appliance.
If you decide that an appliance really isn’t for you, however (some people
swear by slow cookers, whereas others stick them in a basement, never to
see the light of day), pass it on to someone else who wants it rather than
throwing it out to end up in a landfill. Try selling your extra appliances at a
garage sale or on an Internet auction site, giving them away by Freecycling
them (there’s more information on Freecycling in Chapter 19), or giving them
to a charitable or nonprofit organization. If an appliance is too old to be used
safely, investigate local recycling facilities. It’s possible that parts of the 
appliance could be recycled or put to good use (or in the case of items such
as small bar-sized fridges, there may be elements of the cooling system that
need to be very carefully dealt with to prevent environmental damage).
There’s often an alternative way of doing things that doesn’t require an 
electricity-using appliance. For example, use a dust pan and brush instead 
of the vacuum cleaner for small clean-up jobs, and try natural beeswax, soy,
or vegetable oil wax candles with cotton wicks instead of electric lights to
create a romantic atmosphere (the candles burn cleaner than paraffin-based
candles and don’t use lead-core wicks).

Conserving Water Manually
Water is one of the Earth’s most precious resources — it literally gives life to
plants, wildlife, and us! Using as little of it as possible not only reduces the
energy needed to transport the water from its source, process it, and send it
along the pipes to people, but it helps to ensure that there’s enough to go
around. In this section, we share some water conservation tips that you can
apply throughout your home, and then we focus on two places that water
tends to flow most freely: the kitchen and bathroom.
General whole-home tips
Try these general tips to conserve water by reducing the amount you use
every day:
 Fix leaking faucets right away. If you can’t get to the repair immediately,
or if you’re waiting for the plumber to arrive, collect the leaking water in
a bowl or bucket to use for something else, such as washing the windows
or your car or watering your garden or indoor plants.
 Install faucet aerators to both kitchen and bathroom taps. These small
screens screw into the faucet and work by adding oxygen to the water
flow, thus reducing water volume while maintaining good water pressure.
 Check the insulation around water pipes that are exposed to outdoor
temperatures to be sure that they won’t burst in cold weather. Don’t
forget to also check indoor pipes near poorly insulated exterior walls. If a
pipe bursts, not only does the resulting flood waste a lot of water, but it
also can cause a lot of damage inside and outside your home.
 Ask your water supply company to fit a meter if you don’t already have
one (this usually applies to older homes that may have been built
before water meters became the norm). You pay for the water you use,
which gives you an added incentive to cut down. Some water utilities
charge a slightly lower rate for homes that are metered, which increases
the incentive even more.
If you use less water, you also use less energy to heat it up or cool it down.
In the kitchen
In the “Dishwasher” section earlier in this chapter, we cover ways to make
using the dishwasher more eco-friendly. This section does the same for the
process of washing dishes by hand and adds a few more tips for water conser-
vation in the kitchen. The following tips can help you to avoid wasting water:
94
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 When you turn the tap on and wait for hot water, fill a basin or jug
with the cold tap water that would normally go down the drain while
you wait. Use this cold water for drinking, cooking, watering your
plants, filling your pets’ water bowls, pre-rinsing the dirtiest dishes, or
rinsing off the dishes after you wash them.
 Keep a bottle or jug of water in the fridge if you prefer your drinking
water cold rather than waste water by running the tap until the water
cools down.
 Avoid using or installing garbage disposals, as they require water in
order to operate. Dispose of food scraps in the trash or compost pile if
they’re compostable.
 Use as little water as possible when cooking (avoid overfilling
saucepans when boiling potatoes or pasta, for example).
 Wash the dishes in a bowl or basin placed in the sink rather than in
the sink itself. Filling the sink requires more water than a smaller bowl
or basin.
 Use a natural detergent so that you can use the dirty water to water
the garden.
 Wash the cleanest dishes first and work your way up to the dirtiest
ones so that you don’t have to change the water so often (or at all).
 Recycle the rinse water by using it to wash windows, floors, or the
car, to flush the toilet, or to water the garden.
In the bathroom
One of the most effective ways to save water is to turn the tap off while you
brush your teeth. Letting the tap run constantly for the two minutes that 
dentists suggest you clean your teeth sends around 1.75 gallons of perfectly
good water directly down the drain!
Installing water-saving showerheads in the bathroom is also an excellent 
way to conserve water and still enjoy a full-pressure shower. The low-flow
showerheads use aeration (adding air to the water stream) to make the water
pressure feel strong while reducing the amount of water you use.
Showerheads manufactured before 1992 likely provide up to 5 gallons of
water per minute. Since 1992, government regulations require showerheads
to hit a maximum of 2.5 gallons per minute, and some low-flow models on 
the market take the flow rate down even further.
When bathing
In general, a shower uses about a third of the water it takes to fill your 
bathtub. However, the amount of water you use for a bath versus a shower
95
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

really depends on the depth of the water in the tub, whether or not you have
a low-flow showerhead, and how long you stand under the running water. So,
whether you prefer showers or baths, keep water conservation in mind and
limit the amount of water that you use.
Tips for conserving water while you get sparkling clean include:
 Bathe with your partner (sounds like fun!), or schedule baths and 
showers directly after each other so that hot water doesn’t lose its heat
sitting in the pipes.
 Take a shower instead of a bath, but reduce your shower time (five 
minutes is ideal and ten minutes is the maximum). To keep your shower
time to a minimum and conserve water, shave and brush your teeth at the
sink (and turn off the water when you’re not using it).
 Place a bucket under the tub spout to catch the water flowing while it
heats up. Use the collected water for other tasks such as watering the
garden or flushing the toilet.
When flushing
Toilet flushing accounts for about one-third of all the household water you 
use, which is especially significant when you consider that you flush drinking-
quality tap water down the drain. Environmentally friendly low-flow toilets and
dual-flush toilets are now widely available, but whether you have one or not,
you can still conserve water in a number of ways.
 Install water-saving devices such as dams or displacement bags in your
toilet tank (see Figure 5-1). These items take up part of the space usually
occupied by water and so reduce the amount of water used with each
flush.
 Use recycled water to flush the toilet, such as rainwater collected in the
garden or cold water saved from sinks and tubs while you’re waiting
for the hot water to come through. Pour the recycled water into the toilet
tank (not the bowl) immediately after you flush, as the tank is refilling.

Opting for Natural Products Rather 
than the Chemical-Laden Sort
It’s easy to whip out a commercial cleanser to shine up the bathroom,
kitchen, or floor, or to dig into bathroom shelves and makeup bags to give
yourself a bit of a sparkle, but you may be getting more than you bargain for
along with that clean, polished feeling. Many of the chemicals that go into
cleaners and personal products are coming under increased scrutiny from
scientists looking into their possible effects on human health. The evidence
isn’t yet conclusive, but it’s fair to say that going natural is both sensible 
and green.
97
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient
Choosing green furnishings
Furniture can be a source of potentially harmful
compounds, including volatile organic chemicals
(VOCs) that are released (in a process commonly
called offgassing) from newly made items. One
such harmful compound is formaldehyde, which is
used as a glue in many particleboard-based items.
Another example is the flame-retardant material
used in sofas; it has been successful at reducing
fires but is also a concern because of its chemical
makeup. Choosing greener furnishings often
comes down to focusing on natural materials,
which is especially important for children’s furni-
ture and décor because it’s thought that their 
developing health and immune systems may make
them more vulnerable to toxins.
Of course, wood is the most natural material for
many pieces of furniture, but it’s essential to choose
wood that has been sustainably harvested. Look for
the Forest Stewardship Council logo to guide your
choices (www.fscus.org), but in general avoid
hardwoods and tree species such as mahogany
and merbau that are known to be harvested under
questionable circumstances. Some manufacturers
and local furniture makers may also use reclaimed
wood, which is a kind of recycling. For example,
they may create tables from old barn wood or 
from logs that sank underwater during transport 
or storage before processing. Every piece of
reclaimed wood that you use (or buy) means less
wood is taken from standing trees.
For fabrics, again go natural. Look for wool, organic
cotton, hemp, soy, bamboo, and linen. You can buy
sofas, chairs, and other upholstered furniture that
incorporate these fabrics, along with mattresses
that use organic cotton (think about how long you
spend near your mattress and your sheets, and
you’ll see what a difference this can make).
Sticking to natural fabrics significantly reduces the
offgassing problem.
Buying secondhand furniture is also eco-friendly.
It’s already done most of its offgassing, you save it
from a potential landfill destination, and you save
the energy required to manufacture a new product.
Using nontoxic paints and natural fabrics to spruce
up the furniture can give it a new lease on life (ideas
and tips for this are in Chapter 20).

Green cleaning
When it comes to cleaning, you can find a greener way to clean just about
everything in the home. Take stock of your cleaning supplies and resolve to
replace each one with a greener version the next time it needs replacing. If you
have a cleaning service, get them involved, too — you can explain that many
natural alternatives work well and are less toxic to the user. If your service 
isn’t willing to change its ways, shop around to find one that’s environmentally
conscious.
In this section, we start out with some general recommendations for green
cleaning before moving on to specifics — all-purpose solutions and detergents.
Tactics
Here are the basic rules of green cleaning:
 Use as little detergent as possible.
 Save old toothbrushes for scrubbing dirt and stains out of small, 
difficult-to-reach areas.
 Clean up as you go along so that dirt and grime doesn’t get too dried
out and encrusted to be removed by natural cleaners.
 Use a carpet sweeper or dustpan and brush instead of your vacuum
cleaner for small cleaning operations.
 Trade aerosol sprays for plastic spray pumps. Aerosol spray cans are
filled under pressure, so when you press the button, the product is car-
ried farther — which carries the chemicals into the air. The sprays can
trigger allergic reactions in some people and bring on asthmatic attacks
as well as contribute to polluting the atmosphere. (Aerosol sprays no
longer contain chlorofluorocarbons, which contribute to damaging the
protective ozone layer in the Earth’s atmosphere, but they still contain
hydrocarbon-based gases.) The cans are also dangerous if they’re
exposed to heat; even an empty one can explode if it gets too hot or 
if it’s punctured.
All-purpose cleaning solutions
You can use everyday items you probably already have in your cupboards to
clean almost everything in your home — from the stove to the floors, wooden
furniture to glass windows, and more. The following list offers examples of
some natural cleaners and how to use them.
 Borax is a natural mineral that’s a disinfectant. It’s great in the laundry
and as a kitchen cleaner. Add it to your laundry powder to whiten and
soften discolored towels and other whites. You can buy it in drugstores,
supermarkets, and online; for large quantities, head to a hardware store.
98
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Baking soda is a mild abrasive that’s pretty much a wonder cleaner. (You
can get large quantities of baking soda at hardware stores.) Use it as you
would an abrasive cleaning powder; following are some suggestions:
• Brighten up taps and other chrome fittings with water mixed with 
a little baking soda.
• Clean worktops, appliances, and other surfaces with a small
amount of baking soda on a damp cloth.
• Clean your fridge inside and out with a solution of 3 tablespoons 
of baking soda dissolved in 1⁄2 cup warm water. Wipe it all over the
fridge with a damp cloth.
• Clean the inside of your oven by moistening the walls with a 
damp cloth, sprinkling baking soda on the surfaces, and leaving it
for an hour before wiping it off with a cloth. (If oven stains are too
stubborn, try an oven cleaner that contains as few chemicals as
possible.)
• Soak dirty pots and pans in a basin of hot water with 2 or 3 
tablespoons of baking soda for about an hour. Then scrub them
clean with an abrasive scrubber.
• For wet red wine or coffee stains, pour soda water on the stain; if
that doesn’t work, pour baking soda on the stain, rub it in, and 
then brush it off.
• Use baking soda on mildew in the shower and on shower curtains.
Add just enough water to the baking soda to turn it into a thick
paste. Use an old toothbrush for cleaning the grout between tiles.
• Pour 1⁄2 cup baking soda down your kitchen or bathroom drain 
followed by 1⁄2 cup vinegar and then some boiling water. This combi-
nation breaks down fatty acids that block drains and helps to keep
drains smelling fresh.
 Vinegar clears away grease and deodorizes. Use regular distilled white
vinegar (not your expensive balsamic) to
• Clean lime scale off bath tubs, sinks, and shower heads. Soak the
shower head in vinegar and then brush the built-up lime scale off
with an old toothbrush.
• Wash your windows. Spray a mixture of equal parts vinegar 
and water on the windows and wipe them with old, crumpled-up
newspaper to shine them up. (If the print comes off the newspaper
onto your hands, it’s not yet old enough, so don’t use it for cleaning
just yet.)
• Brush around the toilet bowl. For stubborn marks, sprinkle the
toilet bowl with baking soda and follow up by pouring some vinegar
on top of it. Be prepared for the bubbling froth that results. Use a
toilet brush to scour the bowl clean.
99
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

 Lemon juice works on lime scale on bathroom fixtures. If the stains are
stubborn, leave some lemon juice on the mark for a few minutes, or soak
a tissue in lemon juice and set it on the problem area. Bottled lemon
juice is less trouble than squeezing fresh lemons and works just as well.
 Cornmeal works on grease stains. Just rub in on the stain and then
brush it off.
 Olive oil takes finger marks off stainless steel, and when mixed with a
little vinegar (about one part vinegar to three parts oil), it makes a good
floor polish (or salad dressing!).
Use a mixture of lemon, water, and olive oil instead of furniture polish.
The proportions you use depends on the wood and how dirty it is; try a
spoonful of each to start. Use it like you would any other polish: Wipe it
on and then wipe it off with a dry cloth.
 Castor oil is good for conditioning leather. A bit of elbow grease and this
natural cleaner brings tired leather to life again.
 Soda water helps remove carpet stains. Simply dribble some on and dab
the stains away.
Experiment with the proportions and combinations of these natural cleaners
until you find the ideal mix for cleaning every item in your house. When you
find a mixture that works for you, make up a batch, put it into an empty jar or
bottle, label it, and keep it for future use.
Using natural products may call for a bit more effort on your part because
they’re less abrasive and may be slower acting than chemical-laden alterna-
tives. On the plus side, the exercise is as good as going to the gym.

Sniffing out some air freshener alternatives
Air fresheners, most of which simply cover up
smells rather than remove them, contain chemi-
cals. Plug-in air fresheners use energy while
they’re pumping their chemicals into the air. What’s
more, some people find that air fresheners make
them short of breath and give them headaches. In
all, air fresheners aren’t particularly eco-friendly.
Fortunately, you can enjoy a nice-smelling home
while using an air freshener because natural 
alternatives abound. Both vinegar and baking soda
dissolved in water absorb bad smells. Lemon slices
in a pan of boiling water make another good air
freshener. If you have smokers in your house, hide
a small bowl of vinegar under a piece of furniture to
deodorize the room. Burning natural beeswax or
vegetable wax candles with pure essential oils also
takes the cigarette smoke out of the air and stops
fabrics getting smelly.
Another alternative to the conventional air fresh-
ener is to use essential oils to make rooms smell
nice. Get an oil burner, some small candles, and
your favorite pure essential oils to get a more pleas-
ant smell. For even less work, fill up a bowl with
petals from flowers and herbs from your garden!

Although you can try many natural recipes for creating your own cleaning
products, you may still want to purchase some greener cleaning and washing
products (especially if life is too short to make your own versions or you can’t
make a natural version of the product you need). Some of the top sellers are
green laundry detergents, toilet cleaners, recycled toilet paper and garbage
bags, dishwashing liquid, fabric softener, and recycled aluminum foil.
Many supermarkets and home stores are coming out with their own brands,
but some existing brands to look for include Ecover, Method’s Free & Clear
line, Restore, and Seventh Generation.
Laundering with eco-friendly detergents
Some laundry detergents on the market are less harsh on the environment
than others when they enter the water system after the wash. These 
eco-friendly detergents aren’t difficult to find these days; most stores stock 
a range of eco-friendly laundry products.
 Choose as green a detergent as possible, and experiment with the 
recommended amount to see if you can reduce it while still effectively
cleaning your laundry.
 Use detergent designed to work in cold water (refer to the earlier section
“Clothes washer and dryer” for more on washing clothes in cold water).
 Avoid heavy-duty detergents that promise to obliterate every stain under
the sun; they’re likely to contain more potentially damaging chemicals
than other detergents.
 Even if you stick to your normal detergent, reduce the amount you use in
each wash cycle. Using less detergent means that you’re greener than
you were last time you did the wash.
When it comes to powder versus liquid detergent, you may find that one or
the other works better in your machine, so a little experimentation may be in
order. Either way, choose the detergent that comes in a concentrated form 
in order to reduce both the amount you use and the packaging volume. For
liquid detergent, buy refills that come in cartons rather than buying new 
plastic jugs each time.
Not all clothes need to be washed every time they’re worn. If something’s a
bit smelly but not dirty, put it on a coat hanger and hang it outside or near an
open window to freshen it up.
Instead of using chemical-impregnated fabric softener sheets in the dryer, try
the long-lasting softening and anti-static products now on the market. These
“balls” may be made from foam or plastic and act to soften fibers and reduce
static without chemicals. They’re not perfect, but they’re worth a try. You
may need to use four: two “spiky” balls that soften fabrics and two foam balls
that reduce static.
101
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

Going green with your toiletries 
and cosmetics
The green cosmetics and toiletries industries are flourishing, with greener 
versions of everything from perfume and lipstick to cotton swabs and hair
dye, soap, shaving cream, and deodorant. This may seem a little unnecessary,
but in fact it’s an important issue: Just as all kinds of synthetic chemicals are
found in household cleaners, they also can be found in personal care products
and cosmetics. In addition, many products (such as facial wipes) are designed
to be disposable and convenient — but that comes with an environmental
price because it increases waste. In this section, we look at ways to reduce
your consumption of these products and choose greener versions of them;
remember that every little bit makes a difference, so these strategies 
really can help.
To be as green as possible, you can pursue several paths:
 Stop using anything that isn’t essential. Wastefulness is definitely not
environmentally friendly.
 Reduce the amount of cosmetics and toiletries you use so that you
don’t have to replace them as frequently. For example, most people 
use far more toothpaste than necessary — a blob the size of a small pea
is enough. You also can use scissors to cut through tubes such as tooth-
paste and hand cream when you can no longer squeeze out any contents:
There’s usually enough still in the tube for another two to three 
applications.
 Choose items that have little or no packaging and that come in 
recyclable or refillable containers.
 Buy products made with organic cotton if possible. The cotton industry
is one of the biggest consumers of agrochemicals in the world, and the
cotton is often treated with chlorine.
102
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 
What’s in some cosmetics and toiletries
Chemicals abound in cosmetic and toiletry prod-
ucts on store shelves today. These include sodium
laurel sulphate, which is used in shower gel and
shampoos and is also used to degrease engines;
and propylene glycol, which is used in skin cream
and as antifreeze. Parabens used as preservatives
and phthalates used to make products more 
flexible have come into question in recent years,
but scientific evidence isn’t yet conclusive enough
about the link between them and human health
risks for many governments to take action. It’s
therefore up to you as a consumer to educate your-
self on cosmetic ingredients: You can get started
with information provided by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration at www.cfsan.fda.gov.

 Use electric razors or replaceable razor blades so that you don’t throw
out disposable razors with plastic handles that aren’t recyclable.
 Look for products that have all-natural ingredients such as plant or
vegetable extracts and that don’t contain synthetic chemicals. This 
isn’t easy — there are nearly 10,500 ingredients used in cosmetics and
toiletries according to the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics (www.safe
cosmetics.org), many of which can be toxic under certain circum-
stances — but it can be done. See the sidebar “What’s in some cosmetics
and toiletries” for more on chemicals in personal care products.
 Choose cosmetics that haven’t been tested on animals. Look for manu-
facturers who have signed onto the Coalition of Consumer Information 
on Cosmetics, which ensures they will neither conduct their own animal
testing nor use ingredients that have been tested on animals. You’ll find
the manufacturers listed at www.leapingbunny.org — the “leaping
bunny” logo is the coalition’s official mark.
There are plenty of natural products you can use instead of potions made
with lots of chemicals. Tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic and disinfectant, for
example. A variety of plant and herbal ingredients such as lavender essential
oil and coconut can replace toxic ingredients in cosmetics. Just beware of
products labeled “natural,” which is often used as an advertising term
instead of an accurate description. Always check the ingredient list to find
out if the product really lives up to its label.
Sources for greener products are expanding almost daily. Health food 
stores are the old standby, but even department stores and supermarkets are
getting in on the act. You’ll find a variety of green cosmetics and toiletries in
the big chains of drugstores, and there are even specialist chains dedicated
to natural personal care products. If you can’t find a greener version in
stores, try the Internet. Type “chemical-free cosmetics” into your favorite
search engine to find a whole array of companies selling what they claim to
be 100-percent chemical-free products. Always read the label to be certain.
You also can search for your favorite products at the Cosmetics Database on
the Environmental Working Group’s Web site, www.cosmeticsdatabase.
com, to see how safe their ingredients are.
Some green items may be more expensive than their less environmentally
friendly equivalents, but as demand grows for them, they become more
widely available and less expensive. You can save some money by choosing
greener products to replace your usual choices as they run out rather than
replacing them all at once. The shock to your wallet isn’t as great, and you’re
not disposing of half-used products that end up in landfill sites.
103
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

Storing food greenly (and safely)
The use of plastic containers and cling wraps for storing and heating food has
recently come under the environmental spotlight because researchers have
discovered that certain chemicals used to make those plastics — especially to
keep them flexible — can leach out of the plastic and into the food, particularly
during the heating process. These chemicals include:
 Phthalates: Give plastic wraps their flexibility and have been linked with
reproductive, developmental, and endocrine health issues
 Bisphenol A: Found in microwavable dishes and plastic coatings for metal
cans; potentially a hormone disrupter
 Styrene: Found in polystyrene cups and take-out containers; may be a
human carcinogen (that is, cancer-causing substance)
Some nonstick coatings on pots and pans (such as Teflon) have come under
the same criticism. It’s important to note, however, that scientists are divided
on this issue: Some studies indicate reason for great concern, others sound a
note of caution, while still others question whether the other studies, primarily
conducted on animals, are applicable to humans. The safest option is to be
cautious about the use of plastics, and in particular to avoid heating food in
any kind of plastic (this includes leaving plastic water bottles in hot cars).
Manufacturers either are moving away from using the chemicals (including
phthalates) causing the main concern or are ensuring that their containers
don’t leach any potentially harmful substances into food. You can find a list 
of plastic containers and wraps considered safer at National Geographic’s
www.thegreenguide.com/doc/108/plastic and www.thegreenguide.
com/reports/product.mhtml?id=44.
Consider limiting your use of plastics altogether, choosing waxed paper instead
of plastic film when microwaving dishes and choosing ceramic, glass, or metal
dishes for cooking, reheating, or storing food. At a minimum, banish from your
kitchen any older plastic containers, which are more likely to contain leachable
chemicals and which tend to leach more as they age (perhaps retire them to
the garage or sewing room for use as non-food storage containers).
Never use items such as plastic margarine tubs to store leftovers and reheat
them, as these types of containers aren’t designed to take the heat safely.
Going Green in Storage Spaces
Storage spaces can pose a serious problem when you’re trying to go green
because they tend to be home to everything that’s not wanted (or not safe) in
the house: propane bottles for barbecues, old paint, auto products such as
104
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

antifreeze, and more. They’re also a magnet for clutter. Unfinished basements
and attics can be particularly problematic because they’re also the most 
vulnerable to conditions that adversely affect what’s stored in them (think
moisture in basements and heat in attics).
Green your garage, attic, or basement by going through everything in it and 
following this advice:
 Dispose of anything that you no longer use. Have a garage sale, Freecycle
it (see Chapter 19), or take it to your local recycling center or hazardous
waste drop-off point to make sure that it’s disposed of properly.
If you have an old fridge lurking in your basement or garage, send it off to
a nonprofit organization for resale or reuse or to a recycler. Older fridges
consume a lot more electricity than newer models and can be hazardous
around children (who like to climb inside them and can get trapped).
Instead of relying on an old fridge, consider using coolers to keep extra
drinks cold during parties and such.
 Dispose of old paint thinner, paints (especially oil-based ones), and
other flammable items at an authorized drop-off site. These items are
dangerous to have in the house.
 Organize what’s left. Store sentimental items such as photos and memen-
tos in moisture-proof containers, preferably in the main area of the house
that’s more climate-controlled.
Warning: Store potentially toxic compounds (such as antifreeze) well out
of the way of kids and animals; high shelves are best.
 Clean your garage floor by sweeping it rather than spraying it with
water. Rolling on floor products such as concrete paints and coatings
make cleaning easier and also can also help the floor surface last longer.
 Keep your garage floor clean with floor or tire mats and drip pans.
These supplies help keep the floor clear of winter road salt and anything
leaking from your vehicle, such as oil. In turn, you keep the chemicals
from running off into the environment. Use drip pans to collect leaks 
and drips and such, and then dispose of it safely at a hazardous waste
drop-off point.
Small Household Habits that 
Make a Big Difference
You don’t necessarily have to put forth major effort to conserve energy and
save money at the same time. Sometimes it’s as easy as changing a light bulb.
In this section, we look at lighting, standby power, and even the time of day
that you use your appliances in order to find hidden but powerful sources 
of energy savings.
105
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient

Lighting your way
Compact fluorescent light bulbs have come a long way in the past few years,
and that’s good news for your home. The current technology in the bulbs lets
them use 75 percent less energy than incandescent bulbs, plus they last up to
ten times longer and burn cooler, making them safer. Even though they cost a
little more than standard bulbs to purchase, compact fluorescents more than
pay for themselves over time. They’re also available to fit many lamps and
lights (though not all; check before you buy to see what the bulb is rated for
and to make sure that the compact fluorescent bulb’s distinctive spirals or
loops will fit with the lampshade, if there is one).
Compact fluorescent bulbs now come in many varieties, including those
designed for outdoor use, dimmer switches, and nightlights.
Of course, turning off lights of any kind when you don’t need them is one 
of the best ways to reduce electricity use. If your family has trouble with this
concept (and many do!), install motion sensor lights in areas such as halls or
stairways. These lights come on automatically when they sense movement
and then shut off after a preset amount of time. Targeting the light also
reduces the amount of electricity you use. Use task lighting over kitchen
counters or on desks to light up just the area that you’re working in. Dimmer
or three-way lights let you control the amount of light, so they can help you
save electricity as well.
You’ll often see motion-sensor lights used outdoors to provide security 
lighting. If you want your outdoor lights left on all night for safety, get a
photosensitive socket that just pops into your existing light fixture and holds
the bulb. It goes on when it gets dark and switches off when it’s light.

Living greenly with pets
Pets can be green too! According to the American Pet
Products Manufacturers Association, some 71.1 mil-
lion American homes include pets of all kinds. Luckily,
there’s plenty that you can do to reduce the impact that
your furred, feathered, and even fanged friends have
on the environment while making sure that you’re
doing your best to care for them in a socially respon-
sible way. Taking care of another living creature is, in
fact, a huge responsibility — part of green living is to
make sure that you take that seriously.
If you decide to buy a pet from a breeder, make sure
that the breeder has a good reputation and the
animal has been bred responsibly. Unfortunately,
puppy mills that are just a money-making exercise
exist across the country, with the animals kept in
very poor conditions. Ask friends and local vets for
recommendations, and visit the breeders person-
ally to check them out. If you opt for a pet shop, do
your research to make sure it’s a responsible outlet.
Many now work with local humane or animal
rescue groups to give animals a second chance at
a home. These groups can often tell you a great deal
about your potential pet, including training and 
feeding tips. Visit the U.S. Humane Society at
www.hsus.org to get started. In fact, humane
shelters can be great sources of pets — they have

107
Chapter 5: Making Your Home Healthy and Efficient
rules and policies in place to make sure that their
animals go to good homes. Where you choose your
pet from is up to you, however — just make sure
that it’s a responsible, caring source.
Follow these recommendations:
 If you’re looking for an exotic pet, make sure
that it’s both legal and sensitively sourced.
For example, fish should be certified by the
Marine Aquarium Council (www.aquarium
council.org) to ensure that you’re not
inadvertently contributing to the degradation of
fish habitat such as coral reefs. Don’t rely on
retailers to give you this information: Do your
homework before you go shopping.
 Be sure that you have the time and patience to
give an animal the love, care, and training it
needs and that your home has the space and
facilities necessary. For example, keeping an
active dog in a small apartment all day by itself
while you’re at work is a recipe for arriving
home to chewed furniture. And cats love to be
outdoors, but you can’t let them out if they’ll be
in danger from traffic or other animals or if
they’ll be a danger to wildlife such as birds. 
Also be sure to have your cat or dog spayed 
or neutered to prevent unwanted kittens or
puppies. All these measures help to ensure that
your pet — or its offspring — doesn’t end up at
a shelter.
 When it comes to feeding your pet, apply the
same green principles you apply to the rest of
the family: Look for natural, organic, or holis-
tic pet food options. Many manufacturers and
pet food stores now offer these lines. Some pet
owners also are choosing to cook food for their
pets or feed them raw food diets; consult with
your veterinarian before going this route to
ensure that your pet will receive a balanced
diet with all the vitamins, minerals, and other
elements needed for a long and healthy life.
 Commit to feeding your pet properly and 
giving it the exercise it needs to stay healthy.
Just like many Americans, pets are getting
heavier as a result of too many treats and not
enough exercise. Allowing animals to become
overweight is a form of cruelty. It can lead to all
kinds of health problems and leave them in pain
from joint conditions that are worsened by
extra weight. Take advice from your vet about
how best to feed and exercise your animal.
Keeping it healthy is an important part of being
socially responsible.
 Use only chemical-free grooming and bathing
products.
 Talk to your veterinarian about herbal alterna-
tives for flea control.
 Always poop and scoop using biodegradable
bags.Most plastic bags from stores take years
to break down in landfills.
 Make sure that your pet carries identification
such as a microchip and collar tag in case it
gets lost. Proper identification means that
you’re reunited with your pet and it doesn’t end
up sitting unclaimed at a shelter.
 Choose biodegradable or organic cat litters.
 Buy toys and accessories that are made from
natural fibers such as hemp and organic
cotton.
 Protect both your pet and the environment by
avoiding the use of chemical weed control
products on your lawn in summer and harsh
de-icers on pavement in winter. Go with 
environmentally friendly products instead.
As much as you love your pet, you need to ensure
that it’s not doing anything to harm the environment.
Consider the natural instincts of dogs and cats. Cats,
for example, have a terrible reputation for killing
birds, and most dogs love to chase anything that
moves, including wild animals. Consider keeping
your cat indoors or confined to your yard (by 
fencing and leashes, under supervision). Also put a
bell on your cat’s collar to warn birds that your feline
friend is in the neighborhood. Dogs should always
be leashed, except in designated off-leash parks
and areas. If your dog is outside in the yard, make
sure that it’s supervised or that the fence is one that
it can’t get under, over, or around.

Getting out of the standby habit
Electronics such as stereos and televisions use a considerable amount of
electricity while on standby. In fact, some appliances — especially older 
ones — can use up to 85 percent of the power on standby that they do while
in use!
Standby loads are also known as phantom loads, and they can add up to 43
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity use annually (yes, that’s billion). In your
own home, the figure’s probably about 450 kilowatt-hours a year, which is a
potential savings source.
To reduce the standby loads in your home, turn everything off at the wall
rather than leaving it on standby. In addition to the living room, check 
around the kitchen, study, utility room, and bedrooms for appliances that are
plugged in and drawing power even when they’re not switched on. Make it
someone’s job to check the house every night before bed, turning off every
switch that doesn’t have to be on. Don’t forget to unplug all those cellphone
and other small appliance chargers that use electricity even when they’re not
charging anything. Just about the only items you need to leave on overnight
are the fridge and freezer, the heating and hot water heater, and the alarm
clock (unless you have a wind-up or battery-operated alarm).
Plug appliances such as TVs and DVD players into a power strip to make it
easy to turn them off completely. Instead of pulling the plugs from the wall
sockets, you simply turn off the power strip. This works especially well if
your appliances have a battery backup that maintains your channel and
clock settings even if the power’s off.
Timing electricity usage
Peak hours for electricity use are generally late afternoon and early 
evening, as people arrive home from work to start dinner and do chores 
such as laundry and dishes. Electric utility companies often encourage users
to avoid adding to the load unnecessarily during this period (some even 
offer discounts). Excessive power demands can place a serious strain on the 
entire power grid and can force utilities to source power temporarily from
other, more expensive areas.
To reduce the load — and the bills — for everyone, schedule power-hungry
tasks for other times of the day. And if your area is experiencing a demand
emergency, delay your chores until after the emergency has been lifted.

Minimizing Your Trash and
Decluttering Your Life
In This Chapter
 Generating less waste
 Giving your possessions a new lease on life
 Unloading electronics in an eco-friendly manner
F
or many people, trash is “out of sight, out of mind” as soon as it leaves
their homes. But that’s not the end of trash’s journey; it’s just the 
beginning. The scope of the trash problem worldwide involves more than 
just the volume of trash that’s produced. For every item you throw out,
there’s hidden waste — the raw materials that went into its production and
the resources such as water and energy that fueled the process, from raw
materials to finished goods to landfill. And much of that energy comes from
nonrenewable sources.
The green living ideal is to reduce your trash so much that you produce no
waste at all; however, achieving that ideal is quite challenging. It’s far more
practical to focus on reducing your trash as much as you can. Zero waste will
become more achievable as recycling and packaging practices catch up with
today’s culture.
Quick and easy ways to reduce your trash all start with what — and how
much — you buy. When you reduce the amount that you consume, you
declutter and simplify your life, automatically reducing the amount of trash
that you generate (and maybe even reducing your stress level as well). For
those things you can’t reduce, reusing and recycling remain the key to deal-
ing with waste. This chapter discusses ways of incorporating all three Rs 
into your daily life and adds a couple more, including repairing and regifting,
plus a C for composting to help you reach your trash-reduction goals.

Cutting Back Consumption and 
Aiming for Zero Waste
The best way to reduce waste is to reduce what you buy. Only bring into your
home what you really need and know that you’ll use — whether it’s food,
clothes, or electrical appliances. Bringing in less not only reduces the items
you eventually have to dispose of, but it also reduces their associated packag-
ing, which is where much of your waste likely originates. If you’re thinking
about reducing waste, it’s also a great time to think about simplifying what you
already have — decluttering your home can help to declutter your spirit, too!
In the United States, cities are leading the way with zero-waste initiatives. 
San Francisco’s goal is to increase its current 67 percent recycling rate to 75
percent by 2010 and to achieve zero waste by 2020. Berkeley, California, has
changed the name of its Solid Waste Management Commission to the Zero
Waste Commission to reflect its changing goals. In Seattle, a “Wasteless in
Seattle” program is encouraging city employees, businesses, and residents to
eliminate waste completely.
Buy less
Living a simpler lifestyle isn’t about doing without or cutting out the things 
you truly enjoy. It’s about knowing the difference between what you “need” and
what you “want,” but it’s also about prioritizing — looking at your days and
deciding what’s really important to you — so you can make better decisions, for
both you and your environment, about how you spend your money. In this way,
being careful about what you bring into the house has more benefits than just
reducing the trash that you produce: It also can help to simplify your life and
reduce your stress level.
Some experts suggest keeping a journal of everything that you buy for a month
or even a week. When you review the journal, you may see patterns of spend-
ing emerge that you weren’t even aware of. Perhaps you bring home conve-
nience or take-out food more often than you realize, or maybe you make up for
a tough day at work by buying yourself a “treat” such as a new piece of clothing
for your closet. Simply recognizing these patterns is often enough to help you
break out of them; the next time you’re tempted by the fast food drive-through
or the mall, think twice and keep going instead of stopping and shopping.
Another way to scale back your purchases is to opt for good quality items over
mediocre quality ones. From the kitchen cupboards to the bedroom closet,
buying fewer items of good quality keeps your spending in check and doesn’t
overwhelm your storage space. It also ensures that you’re not throwing items
out because they’ve worn out prematurely. For example, if that adorable knit
sweater is on sale because it was made from inexpensive, less-than-durable
110
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

fabric, consider how many times you’ll be able to wear it before it starts show-
ing signs of age. If it’s likely that you’ll have to retire it within a year or two, 
buy a more durable, equally fabulous sweater instead to fill the hole in your
wardrobe. By not replacing the crummy sweater so soon after you purchase it,
you save your hard-earned cash and keep one less item out of the trash bin for
a while longer.
Be mindful of packaging
Keep in mind that the packaging of items you do buy is another important
part of reducing excess. In an age where you seem to have less time and
you’re lucky just to get to the grocery store so you can prepare your meals 
at home, you certainly don’t have time to think about what happens to the
packaging that’s left over or whether you can recycle it. The good news,
though, is that choosing products with minimal or recyclable packaging is
easy to do without much inconvenience; you can incorporate this awareness
seamlessly into your shopping habits with just a little assessment work on
the front end.
Evaluating your output
Take a look at a week’s worth of your trash in order to evaluate your output:
 Assess how much is coming from typical sources such as packaging,
food waste, and paper (such as junk mail). You may want to keep track
of your trash in separate garbage bags for the week: food scraps in one
bag, paper trash in one, packaging in another, and so on. This makes it
easy to see what’s generating the biggest volume of trash.
 If you’re not already recycling or composting, make a list of all the
items in your trash that could be recycled or composted. Imagine how
that would reduce your weekly trash.
 Take a look at what’s left — the unrecyclable items. This is a great
place to start considering measures to reduce this type of trash by not
purchasing or producing it in the first place.
Prioritize your strategies so that you tackle the biggest unrecyclable source
of your waste first — you don’t have to reduce everything all at once. Take
small, easy steps to begin with and get yourself started on a sustainable path.
Adjusting your purchases accordingly
The general guideline for minimizing your trash (other than buying less) is 
to buy a version that has either the least possible packaging or recyclable
packaging. You also can shop at stores that sell loose items or use refillable
containers. Shopping around for the least-wasteful packaging takes some
time, but you’ll immediately see a difference in the amount of trash you
throw away.
111
Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life

Here are some general tips to guide you around the grocery store, where
most packaging trash comes from:
 Buy fresh food that doesn’t come prepackaged. Place fruits and vegeta-
bles directly into your cart — skip the plastic bags hanging in the produce
department. Or bring bags from a previous shopping trip to reuse.
 Avoid individually packaged items. For example, buy a larger container
of juice and send the kids to school with juice in a thermos instead of
those small, individual juice containers. The same goes for prepackaged
kids’ lunches in plastic trays that have cheese and crackers and such in
them; dividing up cheese and crackers at home into reusable containers
that can go into lunchboxes reduces waste considerably.
 Opt for items in glass or other recyclable containers instead of plastic
containers that can’t be recycled. Basically, try to avoid any plastic that
can’t be recycled through your local system (see the “Recycling” section
later in this chapter for more information on recycling plastics).
 Avoid aerosol cans altogether if at all possible because you can’t reuse
or recycle them. For cleaning and toiletry products, purchase products in
pump-action bottles, for example.
 Take your own canvas bags, shopping basket, or reused plastic bags
with you when you shop so that you don’t load up on more plastic bags.
If you have a choice between paper and plastic bags, choose paper, which
is more easily recycled than plastic. Of course, first reuse it if you can, 
perhaps to wrap parcels for mailing. For more on plastic shopping bags,
check out the sidebar “The great plastic bag debate.”

Trash talk
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), more than 245 million tons of 
municipal solid waste is generated every year in
the U.S. — that’s 4.5 pounds of solid waste for every
person in the country, each and every day. That’s
the most trash generation per capita of any coun-
try in the industrialized world. (Canada is second at
3.75 pounds.)
The EPA reports that municipal waste includes 34
percent paper, 13 percent yard trimmings, 12 per-
cent food scraps, and 12 percent plastics. The rest
is a mix of metals, rubber, leather, textiles, glass,
wood, and other waste.
The good news is that, of the municipal waste that’s
generated, almost a third of it is recovered and
recycled or composted. Just over half of it ends up
in a landfill, while 14 percent is incinerated. The
amount that’s recycled is significant, and in fact the
U.S. is one of the leading industrialized nations
when it comes to recycling.
Even though current recycling efforts are a good
start, they could be better. Waste management
experts say that as much as two-thirds of total house-
hold waste can be recycled and even more can be
composted (see Chapter 7), — so there’s plenty of
room for you to help improve the nation’s record.

Take your attack on product packaging one step further by sending packaging
back to manufacturers with a letter telling them why you won’t be buying their
products again. Stores and manufacturers will get the message if sales drop for
heavily packaged items or products in nonrecyclable packaging. Help them to
understand by telling them why you’re buying the competition’s product
instead.
All packaging is not necessarily bad, even if it’s not recyclable (although,
obviously, it’s far better if it can be recycled). It may protect goods so that
they can be transported without damage, thus reducing waste. It also may
maximize the amount of a particular product that can be packed into a con-
tainer such as a large box, and if fewer containers need to be used for the
same amount of goods, fewer trucks are needed to transport an order, thus
decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Manufacturers may be thinking pri-
marily of how to cut their transport and damage costs, but they’re still being
greener as a result of minimizing packaging.
Lengthening the Life of Your Possessions
Cutting back on consumption is an important part of waste reduction, and if
you’re able to hold on to the possessions you already have for longer, you’ll
reduce even further your need to buy new items and get rid of the old ones.
Not only does this practice reduce your waste, but it also saves you money,
113
Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life
If you gotta buy, buy used or recycled
There’s little point in the government throwing its
weight behind recycling as a major green initiative
if the goods produced by the recycling process lan-
guish in warehouses and no one buys or uses them.
So buy goods with recycled content because
they’re greener than goods with nonrecycled con-
tent. The more demand you create for recycled
goods, the more of them will be produced and the
less need there will be for equivalents made from
new, precious raw materials.
When you start looking, you’ll find an amazing array
of products with recycled content, from carpet 
and carpet padding to paper and toner cartridges
to playground equipment and surfaces. You can 
find a helpful list of many of these items at www.
epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/
products.htm.
The principles of reducing and reusing still apply to
recycled goods. Demand that they don’t come with
wasteful packaging, and reuse them as many times
as possible. Just because something’s recycled
doesn’t mean you should buy what you don’t need.
The same goes for used goods: If you buy some-
thing secondhand, you not only keep it out of the
landfill but also reduce the amount of new items that
need to be manufactured. Online sites such as
eBay, local secondhand or thrift stores, garage or
yard sales, and friends and family who are getting
rid of items they no longer need are all great
sources of used goods.

which is always a good thing! In this section, we take a look at how reusing
and repurposing items can give them a new and longer life at very little envi-
ronmental cost. If you can’t reuse something directly, recycling is your next
best option because it turns the item into something that’s once again usable.
This conversion costs energy, but it’s still better than throwing the item out.
We identify the most common recyclable items and how to organize your
home to get it done easily and quickly.
Reusing and repurposing
You can’t reduce your purchases to nothing, but you can look at what you can
reuse. Sometimes you can’t reuse items in the same way you’ve been using
them because they’re too worn out for that purpose; in these situations, find 
a new purpose for that item, adapting it however you need to.
Reusing sits above recycling in the hierarchy of the three Rs because it 
doesn’t require any extra energy for reprocessing and because it cuts down on
the need to buy new. The aim is to use items for as long as possible, for as
many different uses as possible, or by as many people as possible, before they
have to be recycled or disposed of in the trash.
Most things have more than one use. Here are some ideas to get you thinking
creatively about how to reuse or repurpose things that you own:
 Reuse paper that has only been used on one side. Put the other side
through your printer again for rough drafts, use it for notepaper, or give 
it to your children to use as drawing paper. Remember, you probably use
more paper than you realize: grocery lists, hand-drawn maps to show
your significant other how to get somewhere, or even the rough draft of
that novel you’re still writing.
 Wash plastic food storage bags after use instead of discarding them.
Use hot soapy water to get them clean, but don’t reuse bags that have
been in contact with raw or cooked meat.
 Use empty glass jars as containers in your workshop or as organizers 
at your desk or elsewhere. If you drill holes in the lids and screw them 
to the underside of a shelf, you can attach the jars to the lids to reduce
clutter on your work surface.
 Use wrapping paper and gift bags again, and cut down cards to make
gift tags. Fold gift paper and bags carefully so that they store easily and
live to wrap again. Make a wonderful joke or legacy card among your
family members and friends by reusing the same birthday card over and
over and simply encouraging everyone to keep passing it on to the next
person who has a birthday — no apologies, just cross out the last giver’s
name and add on your own best wishes for many happy returns . . . and
returns and returns.
114
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Line recycling boxes, drawers, and cat litter trays with newspapers,
magazines, and junk mail instead of plastic liners that you need to
purchase. (Doesn’t your cat deserve the posh images from that upscale
museum catalog?)
 Alter clothes and cultivate your own vintage look by contributing to
and shopping at secondhand clothing boutiques (see Chapter 11 for
tips). If you’re interested in more ideas for what to do with clothing,
check out Reconstructing Clothes For Dummies, by Miranda Caroligne
Burns (Wiley), which is filled with repurposing fashions from cover 
to cover.
 Repair damaged items. Try repairing an item rather than throwing 
it away and buying a new one. If it’s not worth repairing the item —
especially with electrical items, where safety is an issue — decide
whether it really needs replacing. Life may be too short to darn a sock,
but a chair with a broken leg or ripped upholstery, a defunct kettle, or 
a temperamental toaster may have years of life left with a bit of tender
loving repair. You can find advice and step-by-step instruction for simple
fixes to appliances, electronics, and furnishings, among other things, in
How To Fix Everything For Dummies, by Gary Hedstrom, Peg Hedstrom,
and Judy Ondrla Tremore (Wiley).

Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life
The great plastic bag debate
The average shopper use some 300 plastic bags
from stores and supermarkets each year — many
of which end up in landfill sites where they take hun-
dreds of years to decompose. Even worse, the bags
can escape the trash and blow around the neigh-
borhood on windy days, adding to street litter and
creating hazards for wildlife.
Some areas are so fed up with the indestructibility
of these bags that they’ve either banned or taxed
them. Since Ireland placed a tax on each plastic bag
in 2002, for example, the number of bags used has
dropped by 90 percent. In 2007, San Francisco
became the first city in the U.S. to ban plastic 
shopping bags designed for single uses only.
Many supermarkets now offer thicker, recyclable
plastic “bags for life.” These bags help reduce the
number of plastic bags used because they’re sturdy
enough to be reused again and again and then be
recycled. But it’s important that you actually use
them more than once, stashing them in your vehi-
cle or someplace else where they’re handy for
shopping trips instead of using them once and then
consigning them to the trash.
Paper bags are greener than plastic bags in that
they can be reused, recycled, or composted. But
paper bags are thicker than fine plastic bags, so
they cost the environment more to transport —
more fuel and energy, and thus more emissions.
Your best strategy for green shopping is to take
along your own canvas or nylon bags or some other
sort of basket in which to carry your purchases. If
you do end up with the occasional plastic bag, make
sure that you reuse it for the next trip or for taking
out the trash, or make sure that it gets recycled
(many recycling programs accept plastic bags, as
do many grocery stores).

If you can’t repair things yourself, find someone who can: Furniture
restoration businesses, clothing alteration and repair services, shoe
repairers, upholsterers, electronic appliances repair firms, and even toy
hospitals can give your items a new lease on life. Find contacts in the
phone book, or get recommendations from friends and family. Ask for
references and even evidence of previous work if the item to be repaired
is valuable. Neighbors and friends also may have the skills you need; if
someone you know can help you out, maybe you can arrange a trade —
your skill for theirs.
Sometimes, a little artful furniture arranging may do the trick to disguise
damage. For example, if the cat has scratched up the front of the couch,
you may take fabric from the back of the couch to replace the worn or
torn fabric on the front. You can then replace the fabric from the back of
the couch with an inexpensive remnant from a fabric store; it won’t
match, but if you place the couch back against a wall, it also won’t show.
 Turn small plastic containers into garden pest traps. Set the plastic
container into the ground and fill it with beer to create a baited trap for
harmful pests such as slugs.
 Cut old, worn clothing into rags for cleaning, dusting, or washing
vehicles.
 Turn old pantyhose into plant supports for the garden. Simply cut off
the legs, loop them around plant stems or branches, and then tie them
off to stakes.
 Use wine corks to create a corkboard. Check out www.crafterslove
crafts.com/wine-cork-crafts.html for instructions as well as
many other ideas for using old corks.
 Cut down a king-size sheet that’s worn in the middle into a single-size
sheet or a few crib sheets.
Recycling
If all else fails (meaning that you can’t reuse or repurpose items), recycle.
Recycling involves collecting goods that have reached the end of their 
lives and processing them, their parts, or some of their parts, into the raw
materials from which new goods are made. Ever wonder just how green 
recycling is compared to producing new goods from scratch? Consider this
fact: Recycling steel, aluminum, copper, lead, paper, and plastics can save
between 65 percent and 95 percent of the energy it takes to produce new
goods from these materials.
Recycling doesn’t just help reduce the amount of trash that heads to landfills
and incinerators: It also reduces the amount of greenhouse gases that are
released into the atmosphere. Although the recycling process consumes
energy and therefore emits some greenhouse gases, those gases are still less
116
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

than what would be emitted by a combination of machinery at landfills and
incinerators and by the manufacturing processes used to create new goods
that would be needed if the recycled goods weren’t created. According to the
EPA, in 2005 recycling prevented the release of 79 million tons of carbon into
the air — about the same as would be produced annually by 39 million cars.
Because recycling isn’t as green as reusing or reducing (which don’t emit
greenhouse gases), you should try to reduce and reuse first and foremost.
Glass can be recycled into bottles, for example, but it has to go through a
manufacturing process to get there, and that process uses energy. In an ideal
world, the energy would be generated using renewable sources such as wind,
hydro, and solar power so that the recycling process is completely green, but
in the real world, that’s not usually how it works.
Despite the drawbacks, recycling an item is far better than throwing it in the
trash. And as states and cities increasingly develop and encourage waste-
reduction strategies, recycling will become an even more important part of
daily life.

Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life
Reusing car tires
Car tires pose a big problem for the environment.
They don’t break down, burning them releases toxic
gases, and they can release toxins and chemicals
into the dirt on which they’re stored. Almost every
state has introduced legislation that deals with
scrap tires, with many states banning them from
landfills completely. The good news is that rubber
tires can be reused in many different ways.
 Some can be recycled as retreaded tires and
used again on vehicles.
 They make great rubber bumpers for boats and
for children’s play equipment.
 They can be used for computer mouse mats,
pencil cases, and notebook covers.
 Broken down into rubber granules, tires can be
used in surfacing playgrounds and artificial
sports grounds.
 They can be made into mats and tiles in the
carpet industry. Several carpeting companies
use recycled tires as a major component of
their eco-carpets.
 Broken down into a fine powder, they’re used
to reduce the noise of road surfaces.
 They can be turned into roof tiles and structural
supports in eco-buildings.
To reduce your tire waste, take care of the tires you
have: Purchase good quality tires with long tread
life; check tire pressures so that you’re not driving
on over- or under-inflated tires; rotate the tires every
6,000 miles; and ensure that tires are balanced
when rotated.
When it’s time to replace your tires, either take your
vehicle to a vehicle service shop that recycles them
(they may charge a small fee for the recycling part
of the service) or, if you replace the tires yourself,
check with your local government or recycling ser-
vice providers to find out where you can drop them
off for recycling near you. In some areas, tire stores
accept them for a small fee; in others, you may need
to take them to tire recyclers or to specific recycling
drop-off locations.

More-intensive recycling targets are part of the way to achieve zero waste, 
but manufacturers have to cut down on potential waste such as nonrecyclable
packaging, and they need to design long-lasting goods that are unlikely to
need replacing. As a consumer, you can write to companies to let them know
about your concerns.
Identifying what you can recycle
Not everything can be recycled (yet), but you should be able to find recycling
facilities for these six main categories of household waste:
 Paper: Most paper is recyclable, including newspapers, cardboard, phone
books, packaging, magazines, catalogs, and wrapping paper. If you have a
garden, you also can turn most paper into compost; turn to Chapter 8 for
composting instructions.
Some recycling facilities take paper products such as milk and juice 
cartons; others don’t. These cartons are made of cardboard sandwiched
between very thin layers of plastic, so not all the material is recyclable.
Check with your local recycling service provider before you haul your
waste for drop-off.
 Plastics: Most plastics are recyclable, but recycling rates for plastic tend
to be low because of a lack of facilities. Each plastic product has a Plastic
Identification Code — a triangle with the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 inside
it. The code usually appears on the bottom of the plastic product. Most
recycling services accept plastics with codes 1 or 2, which includes bever-
age bottles and containers used for milk, juice, and body-care products.
Table 6-1 shares details on the Plastic Identification Codes and the prod-
ucts they’re associated with.
Check with your local service provider about which plastics it takes for
recycling, and buy only products in plastics with those numbers if you
can. If the local authority doesn’t accept plastics, try to reduce the plastic
that you buy and reuse what you already have.
 Glass: Most household glass can be recycled over and over again — you
usually just need to rinse or wash out food containers and remove paper
labels. In fact, glass is easier to recycle than plastic, so if your local ser-
vice provider doesn’t recycle plastic, buy the product you need in a glass
bottle or jar if there’s one available. Recycled glass has a whole variety of
uses, but mainly it’s used to create new glass containers.
Glass items such as car windshields, cooking dishes, and light bulbs 
aren’t usually accepted by local recycling systems. These items may not
be recyclable in your area, or you may need to take them to a special
drop-off point. Check with your service provider or local government’s
waste office to find out if there’s a special drop-off point near you. For
example, compact fluorescent light bulbs aren’t usually accepted in local
recycling programs, but Home Depot stores collect the used bulbs for
their own recycling program, so you can take them to your local Home
Depot store.

 Metals: Metal food and drink cans made from aluminum or steel are recy-
clable. With food cans, wash them out first and remove paper labels —
it’s worth the extra chore. Aluminum cans in particular are very valuable
in terms of recycling material. You can recycle used aluminum foil, too.
 Organics: Some recyclers include organic materials such as yard 
and kitchen waste in their regular services, whereas others offer seasonal
organics recycling, such as Christmas tree drop-off locations after the
holiday season.
 Textiles: Many charitable and nonprofit organizations operate drop-off
points for textiles like clothes and shoes; you usually find these sites 
in supermarket parking lots and in the organizations’ own business loca-
tions. What the groups can’t use they generally sell to private firms 
dealing in textiles. We cover recycling textiles and clothing in Chapter 11.

Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life

Paint isn’t recyclable, but it’s worth a mention in this section because some
communities offer a central drop-off point for leftover paints. People can
come and pick up the unwanted paint for free, latex paints may be mixed
together and reprocessed, and components of oil paints can be reprocessed
into fuel (or at least disposed of responsibly if this isn’t practical in your loca-
tion). It’s also possible that local organizations such as Habitat for Humanity
(www.habitat.org) can use your unwanted paint, so check with your city
or town to see if such a service is available.
When you buy anything, ask the retailer if a plan is in place to allow you to
recycle either the old product or the one that you’ve just purchased.
Creating your recycling system: Compost piles and recycling stations
Turning your organic kitchen and yard waste — paper, vegetable peelings,
eggshells, grass clippings, and leaves, for example — into new, nutrient-rich
dirt is the best possible example of recycling success in action. If you have 
a yard, you can build or install a composter in a sunny spot; if you don’t have
the space and your local recycling options don’t include organic waste, con-
sider setting up a worm farm indoors to handle the compostable materials.
For more information about how to compost, check out Chapter 8.
For those items you can’t compost, you can create a recycling station in your
home no matter how little room you have to devote to it. Essentially, you set
aside a space where you can collect and store your recyclables until it’s time
for pick-up or drop-off.
A garage is the perfect place for a recycling station. To save space, install
shelves on the wall, one above the other, that will each hold one recycling
bin. You can buy brackets and wood or ready-made shelves from local 
building centers or organizing stores; you also can purchase bins to hold
your recyclables (such as the folding recycling bags shown in Figure 6-1a; 
see www.gaiam.com). If your recyclables need to be separated, label the
bins and allow enough space between them to throw in the recyclable items.
For smaller spaces, especially apartments, check under your kitchen sink.
You may already have a trash can there, so it’s the ideal spot to add another
trash can (or even two or three) for your recyclables. You can buy commer-
cial products, such as pull-out trays, to make the bins easily accessible (see
Figure 6-1b), or you can rig up your own tray that slides out. If you don’t have
enough room for trash cans under your kitchen sink, use paper bags to col-
lect recyclables instead.
If you’re really tight on space, buy a can compactor to crush metal cans, 
significantly reducing the space they occupy. You mount the compactor on 
a wall or sturdy, vertical surface, such as a wood shelf frame. You can crush
milk and juice cartons without the aid of a compactor.

Finding places to drop off recyclables
Many local governments have well-established recycling programs that 
provide either curbside pickup at your home or operate neighborhood drop-
off points. You may be asked to put all your material for recycling — bottles,
food and beverage cans, paper, newspapers and magazines, cardboard, and
recyclable plastics — into one box separate from the rest of your household
trash. Or you may be asked to separate each type of recyclable material into
different boxes for collection.
If your community doesn’t offer government-sponsored services, look for
commercial businesses in your area that offer weekly recycling pick-up.
There’s likely to be a fee involved, but it’s worth it to divert waste that would
otherwise end up in the trash. Increasingly, stores also are offering recycling
services as a response to customer demand. The office supply store Staples,
for example, lets you drop off used batteries, empty printer ink cartridges,
and even unwanted electronics such as televisions and computers, and Ikea
stores accept batteries for recycling.
To find recycling resources in your community, check with your local 
government. Earth 911 (earth911.org) and the National Recycling Coalition
(www.nrc-recycle.org) also can help. Of course, if your state is one that
has instituted a refundable deposit on certain containers (such as plastic
beverage bottles), there’s likely to be plenty of local bottle depots where you
can drop off the items and claim your money.

Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life

If your municipality or county doesn’t already tackle waste reduction, write
to local politicians or representatives asking them to put the issue on their
agendas. You can find more information about zero waste initiatives at
www.zerowasteamerica.org and www.ecocycle.org.
To make it as easy as possible to recycle — and to prevent it from becoming
an overwhelming task — set up a home recycling center that works for your
family. If you need to drive somewhere to drop off the recycling, plan to stop
by the recycling center on your way to another destination. That way you’re
not making a special trip, which costs you extra time, fuel, and greenhouse
gas emissions.
Turning Your Garbage into 
Someone Else’s Gold
If you can’t reuse something, you don’t know anyone who wants it, and you
can’t recycle it, you may still have alternatives to throwing it out. You can
give things away or sell them if you have access to potential customers.
Remember: If you can’t reuse something, someone else may be able to.
Deciding what others may want
Walk around your home and pick out things that you don’t need but that
other people could use. If you have room, create a storage system that allows
you to add an item to the “find a new home for this” box when you’re done
with it. When a box is full, offer it to your local secondhand book or music
shop; if you don’t get a sale, offer it to a local charity or nonprofit.
Some of the most popular secondhand items include:
 Books, magazines, CDs, and DVDs: The market for these items is huge,
and they can go on and on being reused.
 Clothes: Used and vintage clothes are fashionable, and someone else
may be able to make good use of good-quality clothing even though you
never want to wear it — or see it — again. Sift through your wardrobe
and drawers and sort out things to give away, swap, sell, or turn into
rags. If your items are fashionable or desirable, check out the later sec-
tion “Cashing in on unwanted items.”
 Furniture: Whether it’s old or relatively new, valuable or not, in good
shape or has seen better days, someone out there will take furniture that
you want to get rid of. All sorts of home clearance firms buy furniture;
auctions sell antiques and less valuable furniture and household items;
and charities often want furniture of all sorts to help furnish homes for
those less fortunate.
122
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Electronics such as computers, appliances, and cellphones: Other
people may be able to get electronics in running order either for 
themselves or for charity.
 Household items such as dishes, knickknacks, and storage containers:
If these items are in reasonably good shape (not chipped or cracked, for
example), there’s no reason why they can’t be used by someone else
who may find their patterns more attractive than you do. Charity stores
often accept such household items.
Giving away your goods
Giving things away may appeal to your green nature more than selling your
unwanted items. In terms of being green, offering your used goods to another
person reduces waste and fits in with the idea of reusing as much as possible.
Try charitable and nonprofit organizations, private waste collectors, scrap
123
Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life
Knowing where your garbage ends up
Items that aren’t recycled — in fact, the majority
of domestic waste — lands in landfill sites or incin-
erators. Although both disposal methods have
vastly reduced their impact on the environment in
recent decades, neither one is ideal.
 Landfills: The U.S. is home to approximately
1,650 landfills. These massive holes in the
earth are often located on the outskirts of
cities and towns, where their contents slowly
decompose over the course of several cen-
turies. In the past, sites were simply covered
with earth and the trash left to its own devices.
Modern landfill sites, however, are better
managed; they’re lined and capped to stop
toxic chemicals from the trash leaking into the
surrounding earth and polluting nearby water
sources. Built-in systems capture escaping
gases and liquids, with some experiments
now taking place to recapture energy
released by the decomposition process.
Suitable sites for landfills are becoming
scarce, though, and concern still exists about
the potential for leakage, especially ground-
water contamination.
 Incinerators: A much smaller proportion of
your trash is burned in big incinerators, which
reduce the trash by both volume and weight.
Older incinerators were major sources of air
pollution, pumping environmentally damaging
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Newer plants use up-to-date technology that
makes them much cleaner and less damaging
to the environment; in fact, the energy
released by burning the trash can be used to
generate heat and electricity. However, the
burning process creates ash and gases,
which remain cause for concern. The process
of incinerating is even more environmentally
harmful when it’s done in people’s back yards
because there are absolutely no controls 
or processes to limit the amount of gases or
particles being sent into the atmosphere.
Because neither landfills nor incinerators are facil-
ities that most people want in their backyards, and
because both methods of trash disposal have
some negative impact on the environment, it’s far
better to focus on diverting waste away from them
in the first place.

metal dealers, friends, family, and work colleagues. You also can give items
away on Internet sites such as www.freecycle.org and www.sharingis
giving.org.
Contributing to sweet charity
If you’re interested in giving things away to people who have more need for
them than you do, you can donate just about anything.
Make sure that anything you give is in good condition, usable, clean, and
won’t create a problem for the person receiving it. Too many people dump
unwanted, dirty, or broken items on the doorsteps of charitable organizations,
thus also dumping the expense of disposing of the items.
Following are a few organizations that accept household or clothing items:
 Habitat for Humanity (www.habitat.org) accepts tools, building mate-
rials, furniture, and appliances in good working order, either for use in
homes being built or for resale to the public in order to help raise funds.
The organization also accepts vehicle donations!
 Lion’s Clubs International (www.lionsclubs.org/EN/index.shtml/
vision_eyeglass_recycling.shtml) conducts eyeglass recycling,
collecting used eyeglasses at a number of eyewear chain stores and 
redistributing them in developing countries.
 Nike Re-Use a Shoe (www.letmeplay.com/reuseashoe) collects 
worn-out athletic shoes of any brand and processes them into material
that’s used for sports surfaces such as playgrounds for youth around 
the world.
 The Salvation Army (www.salvationarmyusa.org) operates local
centers that accept household and clothing items for resale.
 Goodwill Industries International (www.goodwill.org) has local
stores that welcome donations of clothing and household items 
for resale.
 Hands Across the Water (www.surplusbooksforcharity.org) 
collects unwanted books and sends them to schools and libraries that
need them around the world.
Facilities such as hospitals, libraries, senior and rehabilitation centers, 
daycares, homeless shelters, and churches in your area may be able to use
various items that you’re ready to donate. Search online or check the phone
book under “recycling” or “charitable organizations” to find them. Contact
each organization to find out what they really want and to make sure that
they can handle the items that you have to offer. Some may even offer to 
pick up your items.
124
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Trading goods online
Freecycle (www.freecycle.org) was one of the first Web sites to offer
members a way of giving unwanted possessions away for free to other mem-
bers who would make good use of them. This program takes the principles of
reducing, reusing, and recycling into cyberspace. Community members who
want to find a new home for something, whether it be a chair, a fax machine,
or a piano, send an e-mail offering it to local members, who then respond by
e-mail. The rule is that everything offered must be free, legal, and appropriate
for all ages. Membership in Freecycle is free.
Sharing Is Giving (www.sharingisgiving.org) is a site with a similar pur-
pose, acting as a one-stop source for all free-transfer Web sites. You can find
more information on Freecycling and similar sites in Chapter 19.
Regifting
Regifting — giving a gift you’ve received to someone else as a gift — isn’t for
everyone; in fact, some consider it quite rude. It’s up to you to assess the
potential consequences; for example, it may not be the wisest idea to regift
the birthday present your parents gave you, for example. And it’s definitely
not a good idea to regift an item if there’s a chance that either the new 
recipient or the original giver could find out and be offended.
It’s not usually acceptable to regift an item that’s used rather than new. On
the other hand, regifting something that’s important to you and thus sharing
its value with the recipient is actually quite generous and thoughtful. Perhaps
you have a painting or a book that has always given you inspiration or
encouragement during a difficult time and you want to regift it to someone
you love who’s now facing their own difficult time.
In the right circumstances, regifting offers these significant advantages:
 You aren’t buying new goods. You’re subscribing to the principle of
reducing waste and thus reducing the amount of energy used to produce
new products.
 You’re reusing something. You’re giving something to someone who will
make use of it, therefore keeping the item out of a landfill site.
 You’re eliminating the need to recycle the item. You’re saving the
energy required to reprocess the item.
Cashing in on unwanted items
Buying and selling secondhand goods is a hobby for some people, a business
for others, and an occasional pastime for the rest. If you like to hunt for 
secondhand treasures, or if you have something to sell, you have plenty of
125
Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life

choices. The only limiting factors are how much someone is willing to pay
and whether it’s economically viable and green to have the item mailed or
delivered to that person’s home. If something has to be transported by road
or air for long distances, you should consider the carbon emissions that the
journey could produce (see Chapter 1).
Here are the more common places where you can trade in or sell items 
for cash:
 Pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers are much more sophisticated
than they used to be, and they abound in most areas.
 Secondhand book and music shops are very popular. Trade in your
unwanted books and CDs for others in the store, sell them for cash, or
leave them on a sale-or-return basis (that is, you leave them in the shop
for a certain amount of time, and if they don’t sell, you get them back).
 Antique shops are an option for some items. You may be quite surprised
at how much you can get for that old painting that’s been sitting in the
attic for years.
 Auction houses generally sell antiques, jewelry, used cars, unwanted
office and household furniture, and larger household items. You can set
a reserve amount on an item you want to sell and take it home again if it
doesn’t make that much.
 Classified ads in the local weekly newspaper or the free advertising
papers were the places for advertising your goods or picking up a used
bargain long before the Internet, and they’re still going strong.
 Garage sales are perfect for selling a lot of unwanted stuff, especially if
it’s too big or there’s too much to sell to a secondhand store. Set up a
sale in your front yard or garage. Find out whether your neighborhood
organizes an annual sale and participate in order to tap into neighbor-
hood sale advertising. If you live in an apartment or condominium, the
owner or condo board of directors may support a community sale —
check to find out.
Phone your local city or county government or check its Web site to see
if you need any permits to hold a garage sale. Rules may be in place
about the items you sell, especially food, and about permitted signage 
or hours of operation.
 Online: You’re more likely to get a better price for your goods on the
Internet than in your local secondhand store or through a garage sale,
and you may be able to find buyers online for unusual or hard-to-sell
items that other places won’t take. In fact, the success of Internet sales
sites has shown that selling things that you don’t need anymore can be
quite profitable. Of course, if you list an item that doesn’t sell, you’re out
the money that you spent to list it.
You’ll find two types of Internet sales stores:
126
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

• Auction sites, such as eBay (www.ebay.com) and uBid (www.
ubid.com) where sellers place items for sale and buyers bid on 
the items up to a closing date and time. The highest bid wins 
the item.
• Classified advertising sites, such as Craig’s List (www.
craigslist.com) and Kijiji (www.kijiji.com) where sellers
simply advertise items for sale. Buyers contact the sellers directly 
if they’re interested in the items.
The success of eBay has led to services that help you sell items on the 
popular Web site. I Sold It (www.i-soldit.com), for example, has outlets in
many U.S. cities where you can drop off an item you’d like to sell; service
people at the I Sold It location take care of listing the item on eBay and manag-
ing payment from the eventual auction winner. The service is expensive 
compared to listing the item online yourself, which costs just a few dollars; 
I Sold It outlets charge varying commissions on top of eBay’s fees — typically
in the range of 35 percent of the first $500 of the sale price and 20 percent on
the amount above $500.
Disposing of Electronic Goods
As electronic goods such as televisions, computers, cellphones, and com-
puter-driven toys, as well as automobiles, assume a more-prominent position
in your home and daily life, they also become more-prominent contributions
to your home’s waste. The pace of technology development means that 
many items that are even a few years old are difficult to reuse, so recycling
them has become an essential issue. In 2005, approximately 2 million tons of
electronic products were discarded in the U.S., and the vast majority of the
items went straight into the trash.
Not only does the fast pace of the technology industry represent huge losses
of reuse potential for many electronic items, it also creates a toxic waste
issue because of the components in many of these products. Electronics 
such as computer monitors, cellphones, and televisions can contain toxic
materials such as lead, chromium, cadmium, mercury, and brominated flame
retardants. The health of the environment depends on the safe disposal of
these components. Thankfully, opportunities for reusing and recycling 
electronic goods are growing significantly.
The related issues of waste reduction and hazardous waste management have
prompted several state governments — including those in California, Maine,
Maryland, and Washington — to introduce mandatory electronics recycling
programs. Most of these mandates place the responsibility on electronics
manufacturers to create recycling programs, with some instituting a recycling
fee that’s passed on to consumers at the time of a new electronics purchase.
127
Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life

Manufacturers and distributors are putting recycling plans into action, thus
joining local businesses that offer electronics recycling. Find an electronics
recycler near you through the National Center for Electronics Recycling at
www.electronicsrecycling.org.
Leveling the cellphone mountain
The EPA estimates that up to 130 million cellphones are retired each year,
which means that a lot of dead phones are sitting around unused in drawers
or are headed for the trash. Because cellphones contain toxic materials 
such as mercury, it’s important to keep them out of landfills and incinerators.
More importantly, however, your old cellphone may just turn out to be 
someone’s lifeline.
Several organizations reprogram retired cellphones so that they can be used
free of charge by people, particularly seniors or victims of domestic abuse, to
call 911. Other organizations reprogram and sell the phones to raise funds for
charity. The following organizations operate such programs:

Tips for selling online
Selling items online can seem a little intimidating if
you’ve never done it before, but if you take the time
to read the Web site’s instructions and carefully do
a little research, it’s not at all difficult. Here are a
few tips to help you maximize your sale price:
 Check out similar items on the Internet to com-
pare prices. Potential buyers are likely to find
those similar items in addition to yours, so do
some research and price your items competi-
tively. You can sell just about anything through
the Internet, so if you get little response from
would-be buyers, there’s either no demand for
your used goods or you’ve priced them too
high. Try dropping the price before you give up
completely.
 Be sure that you’re dealing with a well-
known, established, reputable site.The cred-
ibility and security of the site you choose is
absolutely critical to ensure that your transac-
tion goes smoothly and everyone comes out
satisfied. With auction sites such as eBay, the
more you buy and sell successfully on the site,
the better reputation you will get within that
site’s community. If you sell on eBay, for exam-
ple, everyone who buys on the site has access
to your past buying and selling history (and vice
versa) thanks to eBay’s community ranking
system. This feedback system has greatly
reduced the chances of being sold a dud prod-
uct or not receiving payment for an item you
sell. For more tips on selling on eBay, check out
eBay For Dummies, by Marsha Collier (Wiley).
 Be alert to the possibility that all may not be
as it appears.When dealing with Internet sales
sites, you generally have very little protection if
you send goods and the money doesn’t arrive
or if you send money and the goods don’t
arrive. Internet sales are based on trust. You
can find consumer protection information per-
taining to online sales on the Web site of the
Better Business Bureau at www.bbb.org.

 Collective Good (www.collectivegood.com) allows you to mail your
phone, PDA, or pager in to be recycled.
 Phones 4 Charity (www.phones4charity.org) donates or recycles
your cellphone or similar device.
 Wirefly (www.wirefly.org) offers a trade-in incentive to encourage
consumers to recycle wireless devices.
You also can check with your cellphone service provider about a recycling
program; many providers collect old phones to reuse parts and to donate to
charities.
You can do more than recycle cellphones; consider reducing the number of
cellphones in circulation by turning your service provider down the next
time you’re offered a new model of phone as a free upgrade. If you prefer not
to do that, give your old model to a friend or relative who can use it with
their own SIM card rather than buy a new phone. The same goes for phone
chargers and batteries — pass them on!
Getting rid of computers
If you’re thinking about upgrading your computer system, either at home or
at work, consider what to do about your old one. The EPA estimates that
some 250 million computers will become obsolete in the next five years,
which has the potential for a lot of waste. You do have options for reuse and
recycling, however: Computers can be donated for reuse by facilities such as
schools and charities, or if computers are too old to be useful, they can go to
a responsible electronics recycler to break down their components for reuse,
recycling, and safe disposal.
Computer refurbishers can upgrade or adapt your unwanted computer so
that it can be donated to schools, community centers, and even initiatives in
developing countries to enable more people to gain access to the benefits of
the information age. To find a computer refurbisher or recycling program in
your area, check www.earth911.org (in the Find a Recycling Center box at
the top of the home page, enter Computer and then your zip code or city and
state) or www.techsoup.org (click Learning Center, then Hardware, and
then Ten Tips for Donating a Computer). Some computer manufacturers have
established computer recycling programs, and you can also take computers
to Staples stores (www.staples.com/sbd/content/about/soul/
recycling.html), which participate in an electronics recycling program.
Whether you donate your computer for reuse or drop it off for recycling,
make sure that you protect the personal information that may be on it.
Computer-savvy criminals can access files that you’ve deleted, so use hard
drive disk-cleaning software to properly erase your files. Also make sure that
you deal with a reputable refurbisher or recycler with its own disk-cleaning
procedures in place as well.
129
Chapter 6: Minimizing Your Trash and Decluttering Your Life

Dealing with old televisions
The same places that recycle computer monitors in your area likely recycle
televisions, too, because their technology is quite similar. If you can’t find a
charity or friend who needs your old television, drop it off at your nearest
electronics recycling center.
You may have heard about the switch from analog to digital broadcast televi-
sion; essentially, after February 17, 2009, all full-power television stations 
will have switched from analog signals to digital. The switch will only affect
you if you have a television that’s not hooked up to cable or satellite television
services. If you have a television that receives free signals over the air with 
an antenna, you’ll still be able to use your set but you’ll need to add a digital-
to-analog converter box for between $50 and $70.
Visit www.ntia.doc.gov/dtvcoupon for a $40 coupon from the government
that you can use toward the purchase of a converter box.
Disposing of an older vehicle
If your vehicle can still be resold at a reasonable value, then it’s easy to figure
out how to get rid of it: Either trade it in when you purchase a new vehicle or
sell it yourself (which can often get you a better value for it). But what if it’s no
longer in good enough condition to be sold — perhaps it’s no longer running,
requires far more repair than it’s worth, or has been in a major accident —
and you don’t feel right about selling it on to become someone else’s problem?
You may think it’s time for the scrap heap, but that comes with some obvious
issues. Some of the material that goes into a vehicle can be recycled or reused
(the list of potential items includes liquids such as oil and gas, metal, refriger-
ants from air conditioning systems, tires, parts, and even windshields), but
other material including foams and plastics end up shredded and in landfills.
Although programs and research are in progress to improve the situation, 
you can help out by checking your local resources to find out if there are 
any municipal or state recycling programs that will help you get rid of your
vehicle. The U.S. EPA has a section dedicated to vehicles in its “product 
stewardship” area (www.epa.gov) that lists partners and resources for auto-
motive end-of-life issues, including tire recycling and the removal of mercury
switches from vehicles before they head to the landfill. You also can lend your
voice to organizations such as Environmental Defense (www.environmental
defense.org) that are pushing for better management of vehicle end-of-life
issues beginning at the manufacturing stage.

Up to 11 million vehicles reach the end of their useful lives each year in the
U.S., generating as much as 5 million tons of nonrecyclable waste. The U.S.
Council on Automotive Research, a joint effort from DaimlerChrysler, Ford
Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation, is working to improve how
much can be recycled or reused. Find more information at www.uscar.org.
Consider donating your older vehicle to charity: You get a receipt for a tax
deduction, and the charity sells the car either at auction or perhaps to an
auto recycler. As with any charity, research your local options and ensure
that it’s a 510(c)(3) organization that you’re donating to in order to obtain 
the tax deduction. Try to avoid “middlemen” agencies that accept car 
donations and then pass the proceeds on to charities; a better proportion of
your money actually gets to the charity if it’s the charity itself that runs the
donation program rather than a middleman. Charity Navigator has excellent
information about car donation programs at www.charitynavigator.org.

H
ow green does your garden grow? For many people, the garden is an
extra room — a beautifully manicured place to relax in and enjoy
during warm weather. For others a garden is functional — somewhere they
can grow food and create a haven for wildlife.
Everyone can have a garden of some sort — from the window box on the 
tiny balcony or window ledge to the volunteer garden shared by the whole
neighborhood; from the community garden rented (or perhaps even free)
from the local municipality to your private garden that comes with a house 
in the suburbs. Whether your yard is a patch of concrete on an apartment
balcony or a rolling expanse of green grass, there are lots of ways that you
can make your outdoor space greener. In this chapter, we share methods to
design, implement, and maintain your outdoor spaces that will help you 
to conserve water and energy and eliminate chemicals.
Balancing the Garden Ecosystem: 
The Concept
Left to its own devices, any area becomes a complex ecosystem. Plants
attract insects, which in turn attract birds and animals. Everything lives off
something else in the ecosystem, and everything you do in your yard has a
bearing on how that ecosystem evolves. The more you nurture your outdoor
space without the use of chemicals and greenhouse-gas emitting tools, the
greener your garden will be.
Table 7-1 presents the elements of a balanced ecosystem as they apply to
your yard or garden.

animal manure as fertilizer.
When you take active steps to balance the ecosystem in your garden, each
species that calls it home eventually establishes a natural balance, too. For
example:
 Snails will reduce algae in the water feature.
 Birds will reduce the insect population.
 Some good insects like ladybugs will devour bad insects like aphids
(also known as greenflies).
Attract the beneficial insects to your garden to help keep the bad ones
at bay without the use of chemical pesticides. Simply grow the kinds 
of plants that the good insects find attractive, such as yarrow, Queen
Anne’s lace, and marigolds.
Green gardening requires a bit of research, planning, and experimentation 
to get it right. The idea is to get to the point where you have the garden you
want without having to take drastic action with chemicals, power-generated
tools, and so on.

Designing the Layout of Your 
Outdoor Living Space
Devoting some time to planning your outdoor space helps you create the
most efficient, pleasant, and useful layout while ensuring that you reduce
your need for resources such as water. Xeriscaping, which means landscaping
for water conservation, can provide a very effective framework for the 
planning process. Essentially, the idea is to use plants that require less water,
but xeriscaping also encompasses seven principles that walk you through
garden planning and maintenance in a logical way. They are as follows:
 Planning the general layout: Whether you’re designing a brand new
space or renovating an existing yard, this is your opportunity to take
into account how much sun, shade, and rain your yard receives, how
you want to use the space (for entertaining, children’s play areas, pet-
friendly areas, and so on), and any existing structures such as fences.
Think carefully about what you want from the space you have. Even if
you only have room for a few small pots, you have a choice of growing
flowers or herbs. With more space, you can opt for shrubs, bushes,
trees, flowers, fruit, vegetables, or a mixture of all sorts. In a bigger
garden, you may want a patio, pond, or other water feature.
Also think carefully about the environmental impact of deck or seating
areas. Check with the retailer before you buy wood for decking or slabs
for a patio; the materials should come from renewable, sustainable —
even recycled and recyclable — sources.
Keep in mind that if you pour concrete over part of your garden to 
make a patio, water will run off that area and may cause drainage prob-
lems in other parts of the garden. Water also may run off into the streets
and head down the storm sewers. Keep this precious resource on your
property, where it can be used by your garden, by using materials such
as mulch and gravel in your patio plans.
 Deciding how much lawn you’ll have (if any): Lawns can require a lot
of water to keep them green and lush. Grass is much better for wildlife
than concrete, but your grass doesn’t have to be all manicured lawn. 
To reduce the amount of water you use in the garden, cut down on the
area of lawn and grow plants instead that need less water. Or consider
laying down a grass variety that resists drought. Established trees and
shrubs, for example, don’t usually need to be watered if they’re varieties
that suit your local climate conditions; after you baby them through
their first few years, you can just let them be.
Instead of plants, use hardscape items such as rocks, bricks, benches,
and gravel for decorative effect. Using different colors of gravel, for
example, can create a flowing effect through the yard. And if you’re okay
with some hardscaping but can’t imagine your yard completely without
a lawn, reduce the grassy areas gradually. Perhaps replace one corner
135
Chapter 7: Getting Green in the Yard

with a garden bed one year, add a winding gravel path the next year, 
and create a seating area the next. Before you know it, you’ll be looking
forward to the moment when you can retire your lawn mower!
 Analyzing the soil: Test your soil to determine whether it needs any
improvements in order to support your new landscaping plan. You can
buy do-it-yourself analysis kits at garden centers, where staff can also
suggest effective soil amendments for your area.
 Evaluating irrigation: Although it would be ideal to eliminate the need
to irrigate, that’s not always an option. Instead, consider installing an
automatic sprinkler system. In order for it to be as efficient as possible,
you need to design it so that it waters only the areas that need the water
(not sidewalks or driveways), and you need to know how to set and
adjust the watering schedule. A rain sensor that shuts off the system to
avoid overwatering is essential.
You may want to incorporate a water feature into your garden to help
attract beneficial wildlife such as insects, frogs, birds, and butterflies.
Many gardens aren’t big enough for large ponds or relaxing waterfalls,
but you may have room for a small water feature like a fountain, tub, or
small pond (see Figure 7-1) that recirculates its water (this recirculation
keeps it from stagnating and also reuses the water rather than using new
water all the time). Whatever you choose to install, make sure that it
uses solar power rather than electricity. Anything that needs electricity
to make it function isn’t as green as an alternative that can be powered
by the sun.
Take care that children and wildlife won’t be harmed by irrigation or
water features, avoid using chemicals in the water, and provide shelter
and a way out for any frogs, toads, or other critters that find their way
into your garden water feature.
 Choosing plants carefully: Take a look at the plants you want in your
garden, and choose varieties that suit the conditions you already have —
this makes it much easier for them to thrive. See “Nurturing plants” later
in this chapter for more information.

136
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Adding mulch: Use gravel or organic mulching materials such as com-
post, wood chips, grass cuttings, straw, or rotted manure to cover areas
between plants. It keeps the soil cooler, helps to retain moisture and limit
evaporation, and keeps weeds in check so that you don’t have to use
chemical weed killers. Organic mulches also add organic content and
nutrients to the soil.
 Taking care of maintenance: Keep in mind that you need to continually
weed, prune, fertilize, and otherwise care for your garden — that is,
unless you’re going for that overgrown, wild look. . . . Jump to the section
“Maintaining Your Outdoor Habitat” later in this chapter for specific
garden maintenance advice.
When planning your garden, leave space to set up a drying line or a clothes
rack so that you can cut down on the amount of electricity you use running
the clothes dryer.
Filling in the Framework 
with Life and Color
After you plan your garden layout and irrigation, it’s time to get your hands
good and dirty by adding plants. (Of course, you could wear gloves, but
there’s nothing like digging your fingers into healthy loam to help you feel
connected to the earth.) Choosing plants that are native or well-suited to
your local climate and ones that will attract beneficial wildlife is a great way
to fill in the framework — and amenities such as lighting and cooking areas
add a lovely finishing touch.
Nurturing plants
The ideal green garden has native plants and shrubs that thrive in your local
climate. Native plants don’t need additional water and can withstand the bugs
and insects that your yard is likely to attract, so you’ll have fewer reasons 
to even consider using toxic chemicals to keep the plants free of weeds and
diseases.
Native plants also attract native species of butterflies and birds, which are key
parts of your ecosystem. Grow as many varieties of native plants as possible to
support the wildlife in your garden, and do a little research to find out if some
of them can be grown together to naturally ward off each other’s pests.
Talk to experts at your local garden center about the native plants that grow
best in the climate and soil where you live. Other sources of information about
native gardens include American Beauties at www.abnativeplants.com and
the National Wildlife Federation at www.nwf.org/backyard/food.cfm.
137
Chapter 7: Getting Green in the Yard

The plant you think is a weed may be just a wild plant. You may not want it in
your nicely cultivated flowerbed, but if it’s a native plant, you can relocate it
to grow in another part of your garden.
Keeping a garden that supports native plants and shrubs takes some work,
but it’s definitely worth it. When it comes to deciding what to grow in the
garden, it’s impossible to generalize. You can go for trees, shrubs, fruit trees,
vegetables, potted plants, or flowers depending on how much space you
have, how much sunlight your garden gets, the soil quality, how much rainfall
your area gets, how much time you have to spend working in the garden —
the variables are almost endless. The best thing is to choose plant varieties
that suit the conditions you already have; this makes it much easier for them
to thrive. Group plants with similar needs together. For example, ask experts
at your local garden center about how much water different plants need;
some thrive in drier conditions, so you don’t want to plant them in a low spot
that collects water or next to flowers that may get watered often.
Gardening All-in-One For Dummies by the National Gardening Association
(Wiley) gives plenty of additional advice on gardening basics and garden
design as well as on growing roses, perennials, annuals, bulbs, vegetables,
and herbs. In addition, the American Horticultural Society’s SMARTGARDEN
program establishes guidelines for planning and maintaining a better garden,
including assessing your lifestyle and checking your plants often. You can
find the full list of guidelines online at www.ahs.org/gardening_q_and_a/
10_tenants.htm; you also can find other valuable gardening information on
the society’s Web site, but you should note that some information is available
only to society members.
Encouraging wildlife
Even if you feel that you can’t go green in the garden by growing fruits and
vegetables, you can still make a big contribution by creating an environment
that attracts and supports wildlife. Many species of garden birds, insects,
mammals, and amphibians that were once very common are now thin on the
ground due to changes in farming methods and disappearing natural habitat.
By turning your garden into a place where they can make homes, feed, and
breed safely without danger from pesticides and other chemicals, you help
their numbers to recover.
What you plant has an impact on the kinds of wildlife that choose to live in
your garden. Think carefully about the species you want to see, and grow 
the appropriate plants to attract them (fuchsia and geraniums, for example,
to encourage hummingbirds to visit). If you grow the wrong plants, you 
may attract unwanted species like ants, slugs, and moles that may make it
impossible for other plants to survive.
138
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Wildlife isn’t limited to furry critters. You may think all insects are unwanted
visitors to your garden, but that’s not the case at all. A bug is your friend if 
it helps pollinate your plants or controls the population of bad bugs. For
example, honey bees are nature’s great pollinators; dragonflies eat mosquito
larvae and adults; and ground beetles feed on root maggots, caterpillars, and
slugs, among other things. For more information on beneficial insects and
ways to attract them to your garden, visit www.wcsv.org/Education/
Garden/Beneficial_Insects.htm.
Make your garden as varied as possible to attract as many species as possible.
Here are some ideas:
 Plants like roses, honeysuckle, and lavender each attract different insects
like bees and butterflies.
 A woodpile encourages another set of garden dwellers. You may find
frogs in the woodpile if it’s damp, and if it’s big enough to offer a safe
place, a rabbit may move in.
 A wildflower patch can encourage native insects (including butterflies)
and birds to linger in your garden. Growing a wildflower patch can be as
simple as planting a wildflower mix seed packet that’s available at garden
stores — just make sure that the packet notes the climate zone and area
for which the flowers are intended so that you know the flowers are 
well-suited for your area. Garden center staff also can help you choose
wildflower seeds and plants to get you started.
 A pond created from an old bath or basin draws everything from dragon-
flies and frogs to birds and snails.
Change the water in your pond regularly to prevent it from becoming a
mosquito breeding ground, or use a mosquito dunk, which is a small
tablet that you drop into the water to kill mosquito larvae. The biological
control versions of the dunks contain bacteria that destroy the larvae
and are much better for the environment than chemical versions.
 Hedges are great for attracting birds and insects and providing protected
space for small animals to make their homes. Grow as many different
hedge plants as possible together in your hedge because each different
plant attracts different species.
 Trees and shrubs that produce fruit, berries, and seeds are sources of
food for your furry and feathered friends.
 Boxes and feeders attract birds, bats, and bugs galore.

Wildlife Federation. The site also walks you through the exact steps to create
a Certified Wildlife Habitat.
139
Chapter 7: Getting Green in the Yard

After you spend the time and money to make your yard welcoming to wildlife,
you don’t want to sabotage your efforts by using pesticides to control weeds.
You may target weeds, but other species in the ecosystem also may be
adversely affected.
Adding amenities
After you work out the plants and wildlife-attracting elements that you’re
including in your garden, you can turn your thoughts to other garden ameni-
ties. After all, one of the great benefits of an environmentally friendly garden is
spending time in it simply relaxing and enjoying the chair-side view of nature.
Seating, cooking, and entertaining areas are all possibilities to consider.
Sketch out the remaining open space in your garden and note where you want
to put vital other items — most importantly your compost heap or bin, which
we cover in Chapter 8. The following list includes some of the garden items
you may want to include in your design and issues to consider in using them:
 Furnishings: If you see your yard as another room of your home, it 
needs some kind of furniture. If you opt for wooden tables and chairs,
make sure that the wood is from sustainable sources and not from 
tropical hardwood. Consider buying wooden furniture that has the Forest
Stewardship Council’s (www.fscus.org) stamp on it, certifying that it’s
made from wood from sustainable, responsibly managed forests. Also
keep in mind that wooden furniture needs to be treated to keep it from
rotting when it’s left out in the rain, and often the treatment involves
toxic chemicals; make sure that the furniture you buy has been treated
with nontoxic preservatives such as linseed oil, and use such products
for future retreatment.
If you decide to go with plastic furniture, check that it’s made from 
recycled plastic. Metal garden furniture is more likely to be made from
new materials, but you may be able to recycle it when the time comes 
to buy something new. Check with your local recycling service provider
for more information on recycling metal garden furniture.
 Lighting: Candles are very effective in the garden. Put them into glass
containers to shield them from wind and rain; you can make your own
lanterns from glass bottles or jars.
A green alternative is to install lights with solar-powered bulbs that build
up energy from the sun during the day and then release it at night to 
light your garden.
 Outdoor cooking: Use the greenest material possible for your barbecue.
Check that the charcoal comes from renewable wood, and don’t buy 
barbecue material treated to make it light more easily. It’s likely to 
have an oil- or gas-based fuel in it, which doesn’t do much good for the
environment or for your food.
140
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Whether you burn wood, natural gas, electricity, or propane in your out-
door stove or barbecue, you create greenhouse gas emissions. Go with
the greenest possible fuel source: electricity from renewable sources
such as wind, solar, or hydro power or wood (which itself is renewable).
 Outdoor heaters: Outdoor heaters mean that you can spend time in
your outdoor living space later into the evening and for more of the 
year. As pleasant as heating the outdoors may be, though, using an 
outdoor heater that burns gas or uses electricity not only sends your
bills skyward but also adds to the amount of carbon dioxide you release
into the atmosphere. Think carefully before you decide to opt for one of
these heaters. The same goes for wood-burning fire pits, chimineas, and
outdoor chimneys because the wood also releases carbon dioxide when
it burns. Talk to your supplier about whether you can burn eco-logs
(manufactured fireplace logs that release far fewer emissions) in the
appliances.
If you do decide to buy a gas or electric patio heater, don’t leave it 
on when you’re not using it, and make sure that if you’re heating the 
outside space, your lights and heat are turned off inside your home to
reduce your energy use as much as possible.
Maintaining Your Outdoor Habitat
After you design and plant your garden, you have the job of caring for it. 
(You didn’t think you were done, did you?) A neat lawn with healthy plants,
shrubs, trees, and an abundance of wildlife is a joy to behold. The aim is to
be as green as possible in an environmental sense as well as to have a green
and pleasant garden to admire and enjoy.
In the following sections, we help you figure out how best to maintain the
garden oasis that you’ve created. From managing water usage to easing up 
on over-maintenance, and from cutting back on chemicals to evaluating the
garden tools you use, these sections ensure that your garden stays green . . .
in more ways than one.
Making the most of your watering
Water is a big issue for most gardeners. Depending on where you live, you’re
likely to complain about having too little or too much of it at certain times of
the year. If you’re in the former category, you need to safeguard your garden
from drying out; if you’re in the latter, you need to use plants in your yard
that love getting their feet wet!
141
Chapter 7: Getting Green in the Yard

If you live in an area where rain doesn’t flow like water, you have two primary
goals to attain if your aim is to live greenly:
 Water your garden as infrequently as possible. By using native 
plants (refer to the earlier section “Flourishing plants”), you can design
the sort of garden that can stay green without a lot of water in the 
first place.
 Be mindful of your water source. You don’t have to rely on the tap 
if you incorporate alternative water sources (see the next list in this 
section).
Several practices can help you attain these goals and water more greenly and
efficiently:
 Collect rainwater that runs off your roof in rain barrels. Drainpipes
can empty directly into barrels, which should have faucets near the
bottom to make it easy to get the water out (see Figure 7-2). Be sure to
cover the top of the barrel with a screen or some other covering to pre-
vent debris (such as leaves) and insects (such as breeding mosquitoes)
from getting into the water.
If your yard is big enough, consider installing a cistern, or large water-
storage container. If you’re renovating or building, this is a great option,
especially if you can direct greywater from the house into it. Talk to 
your contractor about your options, and check out Chapter 4 for an
illustration of a greywater system.
Even if you don’t have a rain barrel or cistern, you can use basins or
buckets to carry used dishwater or bathwater outside to water your
plants.
 Water your garden during the coolest part of the day to reduce evapo-
ration. Stick to watering in the early morning or late evening, and water
only the areas and plants that need it.
 Use a trigger nozzle or soaker hose instead of a sprinkler. A sprinkler
can use as much water in an hour as a family of four uses in a day!
Trigger nozzles or soaker hoses work better for specific areas such as
garden beds. If you just can’t give up your sprinkler, remember that it
doesn’t take long for a sprinkler to soak your lawn thoroughly. When you
set up the sprinkler, set out an upside-down Frisbee, too; when the
Frisbee’s filled with water, turn off the sprinkler.
 Resist the temptation to reach for the garden hose at the first appear-
ance of a brown patch. Once a week is all the watering your lawn 
needs — even in the hottest weather. Overwatering can actually damage
your lawn, weakening it by encouraging roots to seek the surface.
142

Letting your lawn go — just a bit
If you decide that some lawn is essential in your garden plan, make it as green
as possible by using environmentally friendly ways of keeping it healthy.
Follow these suggestions:
 Leave grass cuttings on the lawn to feed the soil. If there are too many
cuttings, put the excess in the compost heap.
 Use native grass seeds. They’ll grow better in your local climate than
other varieties.
 If your lawn turned brown in the sun the last time you cut it, let 
the grass grow a little longer between cuttings and don’t cut it so
short next time. Longer grass (21⁄2 to 31⁄2 inches, depending on the grass
variety) stays greener than a close-mown lawn, is less likely to scorch,
and needs less watering.
 Leave some of the lawn to grow wild with flowers and decorative
grasses, or plant some trees and shrubs. Those areas will attract
wildlife and reduce the amount of effort needed to care for the lawn.

Chapter 7: Getting Green in the Yard

Trading chemicals for natural alternatives
Although some natural alternatives to garden chemicals are still under devel-
opment, you may be surprised at the number of options you have to deal
with problems in your yard. Keep in mind that in many cases it takes more of
a commitment to go natural rather than chemical: It may take seasons rather
than days to eliminate weeds, for example. But it’s worth it to give your yard
a life free of toxic and harmful chemicals. Not only do you want to limit your
children’s exposure to these chemicals when they’re out in the yard, but you
also don’t want to track the chemicals indoors on your feet or let them blow
in through the windows.
When you’re out in the garden, you no doubt encounter biting insects such
as mosquitoes and ticks. Not only is their bite unpleasant, but they also may
transmit illnesses such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease. Protect yourself
by wearing long pants and long sleeves, especially at times of day when the
insects are most active. Although insect repellants containing DEET are sug-
gested for warding off mosquitoes, natural alternatives are available that con-
tain essential oils or citronella (look for them wherever mosquito repellants
are sold). Experiment to find one that works for you and your family, and be
prepared to apply it more often than the chemical-based version.
Rather than use chemicals to treat your lawn and garden, consider doing the
following:
 Dethatch and aerate your lawn. Dethatching means removing the woody
parts of the grass plant that build up on the surface of the lawn; do this
when the thatch gets more than about 1⁄2 inch thick and therefore restricts
water and air getting to the grass root. A dethatching rake works well for
this task. Aerating removes plugs of grass from your lawn using an aerat-
ing machine (which you can rent) to encourage air and water to reach
the roots. Both practices keep your lawn healthy in a greener way than
relying on broadcast chemicals that deliver fertilizer and herbicide in
combination. (The herbicide ends up in areas that don’t need it and can
run off into groundwater sources.)
 Use natural or organic herbicide alternatives for killing weeds. Some
new products available at garden centers are vinegar-based, for example.
In addition, using a hoe to break up the dirt area around plants stimulates
the growth of plants, reduces water loss from the soil surface, and
removes weeds that take up valuable water and nutrients.
 Use natural fertilizers such as compost, bone meal, and blood meal, all
of which are available at garden centers.
 Use organic garden products such as those that contain sulfur as a
fungicide and insecticidal soaps containing pyrethrum, which comes
from chrysanthemums.
144
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Pour boiling water on ant nests, or buy sticky strips (similar to flypa-
per) to capture them.
 Attract wildlife that feasts on pesky bugs. For example, put in plants
that attract birds and ladybugs, and fill a bird bath (change the water 
regularly to discourage mosquitoes). You can also use this biocontrol
approach by purchasing beneficial insects such as ladybugs at garden
centers and through the mail and releasing them in your garden.
 When the soil is damp, use a digging tool to remove the whole roots 
of dandelions and other weeds; then fill in the hole, and sprinkle corn-
gluten meal (available at garden centers) around it to suppress stray
seeds. Remove annual weeds with a hoe when they’re small, and spread
mulch around trees and shrubs to suffocate any remaining weeds.
 Pick insects off plants using your finger and thumb, wash them off 
with a garden hose, or use organic insecticidal soaps (with care).
 Attract and trap slugs on the bottom of a piece of wood or in empty
grapefruit shells or beer-filled plastic tubs.
 Shake bushes or branches vigorously to dislodge caterpillars onto a
surface such as a plastic or canvas tarpaulin; then dispose of the 
caterpillars in the trash.
One more-involved way to control pests in your yard is by using Integrated
Pest Management (IPM) methods. Created by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, IPM involves taking the following actions:
 Monitoring and identifying the pests in your yard to determine what they
are and whether their numbers present a problem
 Preventing pests from taking hold using methods such as plant rotation
and pest-resistant plant varieties
 Dealing with pest outbreaks using the least risky type of pest control first
You can find more information on IPM and how to implement it in your yard at
www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/ipm.htm and in Chapter 8.
If you have garden chemicals to dispose of, call your local waste management
department to find out where you can take them to get rid of them safely.
Replacing power tools 
with the manual kind
A peek at the contents of the average garden shed reveals no laughing matter.
Most tool sheds or garages harbor some of the least green garden products
on the market; in addition to chemicals for killing weeds and pests, you’re
likely to find gas-powered lawn mowers and electric tools. Gasp!
145
Chapter 7: Getting Green in the Yard

Cut down the energy you use in the garden by replacing your power tools
with manual alternatives (see Figure 7-3). Sure it involves more manual labor
and elbow grease, but think of all the energy and pollution you’re saving! You
can also opt for cordless electric or solar-powered alternatives for items such
as lawn mowers; they have the best of both worlds: reducing emissions and
saving labor. You should find an increasing selection of cordless electric or
solar-powered tools wherever conventional lawn mowers and other garden
machines are sold. Table 7-2 offers suggestions.

powered mower that charges using solar power, or use green electricity,
which is electricity that has been generated by renewable sources such as
wind, solar, or hydro power (check out Chapter 3 for information on 
switching to a green energy supplier).
If you live in an area where livestock is allowed, replace your lawn mower
with a couple of goats (yes, you read that right). The goats will keep the grass
down, fertilize it, and give you milk!
When you start looking in garden centers and catalogs, you’ll find tons of
cool hand tools to try. Look for long-handled tools to give your back a break
and knee pads or kneeling stools to ease the strain on these vulnerable joints.
Sell or give away the electrical and gas-powered tools so that they’re reused.

E
ating locally grown food in season is the greenest way to eat because 
you get the freshest and therefore most vitamin-packed food. Eating
locally also significantly reduces the resources needed to transport the 
food to you — and what could be more local than your own garden? It offers
maximum convenience (it’s right outside your door), reduces waste (you 
pick only what you need), and provides you with a nutrient boost (nutrients
can disappear as fruits and vegetables age in stores).
If your food is organically produced, even better! You ingest fewer chemicals
and help to protect the environment, too. Growing your own food using
organic methods checks off all the green boxes — plus you have the 
satisfaction of having done it all yourself.
You can grow your own food just about anywhere as long as you have a 
bit of sun and a water supply. Even if you live in an apartment with only a
windowsill, you’ll find that herbs and small veggies, such as some lettuce
varieties, can thrive. In this chapter, we cover food gardening from top to
bottom. We help you figure out what to plant, where to plant it, and how 
to keep it organic and earth-friendly.
Planning Your Food Garden: 
Easy Crops for Everyone
You can successfully nurture a wide range of fruits and vegetables in your
own garden simply by matching your local growing conditions with the 
conditions that the plants like best. This task is easier than ever because
many varieties have been developed specifically for differing climate 
conditions across the United States.

What’s most important when you’re deciding which fruits and vegetables to
grow and how to grow them (whether in containers or garden plots) is that
you plant the items that you and your family enjoy the most. Also, grow as
wide a variety as possible to prevent family members from getting so tired of
carrots or eggplants that they flee to the grocery store to find something —
anything — different.
Taking your space and preferences 
into account
When planning your food garden, you need to consider how much space you
have, what your climate conditions are (including rainfall), and how much
time you have to spend maintaining it. Keep in mind that most fruits and 
vegetables have the following essential needs:
 Loose, well-drained, fertile soil: Nutrient-rich soil that gives roots room
to grow leads to larger, healthier plants.
 Full sun: Six to eight hours of sunlight daily helps plants grow more
quickly.
 Shelter from the wind: Exposed locations allow wind to damage or dry
out plants.
 Consistent water source: Water is critical for the optimal health, size,
and juiciness of fruits and vegetables.
 Protection from competitors: Plants should be positioned away from
nearby trees or hedges that would shade them or rob their root systems
of moisture.
If you’re dealing with a small space such as a patio or balcony (or even a 
windowsill), or if your yard is landscaped in a way that doesn’t encourage a
vegetable patch (such as with gravel and seating areas), consider gardening
in containers. You can choose container sizes depending on the needs of
your preferred plants (the planting instructions on seed packets or plant
labels indicate how deep to plant the item and how large it’s likely to grow).
We talk more about container gardening later in this chapter, in the section
“Creating big flavor in containers.”
Plants with descriptions such as bush, compact, space saver, or patio indicate
that they’re specifically designed to grow in smaller spaces; tomatoes are a
good example. Also look for plants that are designed to grow upwards, such
as pole or runner beans, or that can be trained to grow up trellises, such as
cucumbers, in order to save space.
In general, the easiest items to grow in any garden, including container 
gardens, include the following:
150
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 All kinds of lettuce-type greens
 Beets
 Carrots
 Cucumbers
 Eggplant
 Green beans
 Herbs such as chives and mint
 Hot and sweet peppers
 Onions
 Peas
 Radishes
 Raspberries
 Strawberries
 Summer squash
 Tomatoes
Consider planting unusual varieties of fruits and vegetables — especially
ones that you can’t usually find in your supermarket — in your garden. 
For example, yellow tomatoes and blue-fleshed potatoes can be stunning
additions to your dinner plate. Many of these are considered heirloom vari-
eties, meaning that they were once common but have largely been replaced
by more commercially viable types. Choosing heirloom seeds and plants
helps to preserve the diversity of the vegetable and fruit gene pool.
Have some fun with your plantings, too, by planting fresh items that you need
for your favorite meals together. For example, if you enjoy pasta dishes, you
can plant common ingredients such as tomatoes, basil, and peppers together.
Following the seasons
Gardening in the dry climate of Arizona is very different from gardening in 
the moist conditions of the Pacific Northwest. And then there’s the issue of
winter: In southern states, you can grow many plants year-round, whereas in
more northern locations, you have to work around the issue of frosts, frozen
ground, and mounds of snow. Understanding the way the climate and seasons
work in your area can help you choose plant varieties that will thrive.
The best way to navigate your climate is with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Hardiness Zone map, which you can see online at www.usna.
usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html. It divides the nation into a series of
zones labeled 1 through 11, with 1 being the coldest and 11 being the warmest.
151
Chapter 8: Growing Your Own Food

Perennial plants are those that, when planted in one place, come back year
after year on their own. Examples are fruit trees and rhubarb. Check out your
zone on the Hardiness Zone map to be sure that you choose perennial plants
that thrive in your zone. To help you out, perennials and their seed packets
are usually labeled with their zones.
To artificially boost your garden or just parts of it into a warmer zone, look
for microclimates, or areas of your property that are warmer than others.
These include areas that are up against heat-radiating surfaces such as the
house, a shed, or a wooden fence. You may be able to grow plants there that
wouldn’t thrive a few feet away in a more exposed spot.
Annual plants are those that you have to plant new each year as seeds or
plants. When choosing annual fruits and vegetables for your garden, you
need to know the following important dates, which mark the start and end of
the growing season:
 The average last frost of the spring: Many seeds should be planted 
after this date.
 The average first frost of the fall: This frost will damage or kill tender
plants and marks the end of the growing season.
Check the seed packet or plant label of the variety that you’re interested in
growing. As long as your growing season is long enough to let the vegetables
mature, you can try growing it. It’s also a good idea to talk to employees at
your local garden center or nursery about the best kinds of plants to grow in
the conditions you have.
Food Gardening Basics for Containers
and Garden Plots
Whether you’re gardening in small containers or a large garden plot, paying
attention to the basics of good soil, sun, and water will make all the differ-
ence to the success of your fruits and vegetables. In this section, we address
the “where” of food gardening — containers and garden plots. Your decision
about where to plant your fruits and vegetables may be determined by your
available space or simply by the time and effort you’re willing to put into
your garden. The following sections cover both options.
You can find plenty of excellent fruit and vegetable gardening information 
in Organic Gardening For Dummies by Ann Whitman and the National
Gardening Association and Container Gardening For Dummies by Bill Marken
and the National Gardening Association (both from Wiley). The compendium
Gardening All-in-One For Dummies is also full of great tips for planting and
caring for your garden.

Creating big flavor in containers
Even if you don’t have space for a conventional garden, you can grow a sur-
prising amount in containers such as pots and window boxes on a balcony,
on windowsills, or even on a small concrete patio. Container gardening offers
the advantages of fewer insects and weeds than a regularly planted garden,
and it can be placed right outside your door or on your kitchen counter, 
so it’s very handy. But containers do require more frequent care: Regular
watering and fertilizing are very important because the plants don’t get 
that stuff directly from the earth.
You can grow almost any plant in a container as long as the container is large
enough to accommodate its root system. Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants
grow particularly well in containers, as do leafy greens such as lettuce and
spinach, herbs, and fruits such as strawberries. Even if there’s only enough
space for a few herbs or salad leaves, that’s a start. And it takes surprisingly
little space to grow a few tomatoes.
Keep growing in a confined space simple by following these steps:
1. Buy clay or terra-cotta pots, which are the most naturally made pots
on the market.
If your pots are locally made, they’re even greener. Make sure that
they’re deep enough to allow adequate root growth (about 20 to 25 cm)
and that they have holes in the bottom for water drainage. (Water that
sits in the pot can create root rot, which is bad news for your plant.)
2. Buy organically grown seeds or small plants, which are available from
garden centers, nurseries, natural food stores, many hardware stores,
and mail-order growers.
3. Plant the seeds or plants in prepackaged or homemade organic pot-
ting mix, which contains natural ingredients such as soil, plant mulch,
compost, manure, and sand, until your own compost is ready to use
(see the later section “Fertilizing naturally” for compost coverage).
Line the bottom of the pot with broken pieces of terra cotta or small
stones to encourage drainage while preventing the dirt from escaping
through the drainage hole in the bottom of the pot. Then simply fill the
pot with the potting mix, and plant the seeds or plants at the depth 
recommended on the seed or plant packaging.
4. Place the pots in the best position to make the most of sunlight 
and rain.
If your containers are inside, place them near windows for sunlight, but
obviously don’t worry about the rainfall.
As your tiny garden grows, use the following tips to keep it growing greenly:
153
Chapter 8: Growing Your Own Food

 Water as recommended on the seed package or plant label. In general,
when the soil begins drying out, add more water, but avoid soaking the
seed or plant. Too much water can be as damaging as too little.
 Feed your plants organic fertilizer that contains rock minerals and
animal manure produced from sustainable farming methods. You also
can use the liquid from the bottom of a worm farm (see the later section
“Letting a worm farm create compost for you”).
 Use organically made insecticides such as those made from a mix of
garlic, chilies, and dried pyrethrum (a plant of the daisy family).

Planting your seedlings in Mother Earth
A spare area of sod or bare earth in your yard has wonderful potential to be
turned into a source of the freshest produce possible for you and your family.
To get the most from your garden, spend some time planning your design (see
Figure 8-1) and preparing the soil before you start to plant. Then, as seedlings
turn into fruit- and vegetable-producing plants over the growing season, you’ll
gain not only food but also the benefits that come from spending time tending
the garden: relaxation and a stronger connection to the earth.
Choose your garden size based on how much time you have to devote to it.
It’s often best to start with a small plot — 25 to 50 square feet, for example —
and expand it gradually rather than overwhelming yourself at first with an
area that you can’t water and weed regularly.
If you want to be completely self-sufficient when it comes to fruits and vegeta-
bles, plan a plot that’s between 600 and 2,400 square feet. A garden this size
should produce enough food for a family of four for a year, as long as you’re
willing to devote time to canning, freezing, or otherwise preserving your 
harvest.
Prime your garden for best results using these steps:
1. Decide whether you want to grow plants in raised beds. These are beds
that are built up generally about 8 to 12 inches high, filled with a mix of
soil and compost, and surrounded by borders of wood, bricks, or even
rocks to keep the soil in place (see Figure 8-1b). They should be no more
than 5 feet long or wide to make it easy to reach into the center of the
bed without stepping into the bed. The soil in raised beds warms faster
in the spring; other benefits of raised beds are improved drainage and
attractive design possibilities for the garden.
154
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

2. Plan your garden to scale on graph paper to experiment with different
layouts and to find the one that best utilizes your space. Traditional
vegetable gardens orient the plants in rows, but there’s no reason why
you can’t do something different. You can lay out beds of any shape and
group plants in a variety of ways as long as you allow sufficient room for
each plant to grow. Consider orienting rows north–south to expose the
plants to maximum sunshine, and plan to put taller or climbing plants
against fences or at the garden’s north end to avoid having them shade
smaller plants.
If you have room in your garden, consider planting an extra row of pro-
duce for donation to a local food bank or other community organization.
The Garden Writers Association has more information about its Plant a
Row for the Hungry program at www.gwaa.org/par.
3. Analyze your soil (buy testing kits from local garden centers) to find
out what you’re working with and whether it needs amending. Pick up
a handful of soil and squeeze: It should feel moist and stick together but
should also be easy to crumble apart again. Sandy soil that doesn’t stick
together can be too dry and often drains too fast, so you need to add
richness (compost, for example); clay sticks together too much because
it often retains too much water, so you need to add drainage material
(coarse sand and compost, for example). Consult your garden center for
the best options.
4. Dig the bed over, breaking up the compacted soil using a hand tiller 
or rototiller for large areas. Remove rocks, and take out weeds by 
their roots.

Chapter 8: Growing Your Own Food

Give your garden soil a head start for spring by digging over the bed and
adding compost in the fall.
5. Start seeds indoors about six weeks before planting time. (In northern
climates, time your planting for after the last frost danger.) Take planting
and growing directions from seed packages, including thinning the
seedlings so that the mature plants don’t crowd each other.
6. Sow or plant your garden according to the plan you created in Step 2.
To make the harvest manageable, especially if you’re not canning or
freezing, divide up your plantings and sow or plant in successive weeks
so that produce doesn’t ripen all at once.
Keep a journal from year to year tracking which plants grow well and
how various factors such as weather and insects affect your garden.
7. Water your garden regularly, and fertilize according to the plant’s
requirements. When watering, it’s best to use a soaker hose or irrigation
system that gradually and consistently delivers water to root systems
156

Extending the growing season with a greenhouse
If you have the space, money, and time to build and
maintain a greenhouse, you may want to consider
doing so because a greenhouse can extend your
growing season, allowing you to produce plants
that would be too tender to grow outside in harsh
weather. Many greenhouse models are now quite
compact, and the use of plastic products instead of
glass has brought prices down (although of course
the trade-off there is that you may prefer to avoid
plastic given its environmental impact).
A greenhouse protects your plants from both
scorching and freezing weather in the following
ways:
 In summer,the glass (or plastic) makes the inte-
rior temperature warmer so that plants that
wouldn’t thrive in the outside climate can flour-
ish. You can take advantage of the heat to grow
more exotic plants, fruits, and vegetables than
you can grow in the garden. You may also be
able to grow varieties that don’t ordinarily suit
your growing zone. If you live in an area with a
short growing season that often limits your 
harvest of items such as strawberries and
tomatoes, a greenhouse lets you get plants
started early and finished late. And if it gets too
hot inside the greenhouse, you can simply open
vents or windows to cool things down (some
greenhouses even have vents that operate
automatically).
 In winter, especially in warmer parts of the
country, a greenhouse lets you keep alive frag-
ile plants that would otherwise die in the cold
garden because it traps the warmth from the
sun inside, thus moderating cooler overnight
temperatures. Depending on where you live,
you may be able to grow new young plants
from seeds, seedlings, or bulbs in your green-
house and then plant them out in the garden in
the spring. By heating the greenhouse, you can
grow a whole range of plants, but heating isn’t
very green given that it requires energy and
produces carbon emissions.

without wetting the plants’ leaves, which can cause mold growth. You
can see examples of irrigation systems in Figure 8-2 (which shows a
furrow system in which plants are grown in slightly raised beds, allowing
the water to flood the furrows between the beds and seep into the
ground) and Figure 8-3 (which shows an irrigation pipe or soaker hose
that puts water right at the plants’ roots).
If your growing season is short, consider using cold frames to give your plants
a chance to start growing before the season officially begins by protecting
them from cool overnight temperatures. The frames work in a similar way to
greenhouses except that they’re a lot smaller. Cold frames are essentially
boxes with glass tops that cover individual groups of plants (see Figure 8-4).
The glass warms the plants underneath it when it’s closed and can be
propped open to prevent warming the plants too much on warmer days.
You can buy cold frames at garden centers and many hardware stores or
make your own by fitting an old window pane or shower door over a basic
wooden frame.

Putting the “Green” in Green Gardening:
Incorporating Organic Principles
Choosing to garden organically is a great way to help protect your health and
that of the soil around you. It means that no chemical fertilizers or pesticides
have been used to produce the fruits and vegetables that you’re eating. When
you garden organically, you can be confident that the only growing boosts
have been sunlight, water (preferably from water-conserving sources such as
rain barrels), and possibly some organic fertilizer.
Organic growing is about more than what’s not in the food, however. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program certifies as organic
those foods that are produced without using synthetic chemical pesticides 
or that come from animals that haven’t been given antibiotics or growth 
hormones. However, the program also emphasizes using renewable resources
and conserving soil and water to enhance environmental quality in the
future. It’s also about building the health of the soil to feed the plants rather
than simply feeding the plants. For more information on the National Organic
Program, visit www.ams.usda.gov/nop/indexIE.htm.
Figure 8-4:
Cold frames

either buy or
make.

Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

If you don’t sell your produce as organic, you don’t have to comply with the
standards, of course, but the closer you can get to them, the more organic your
home-produced food will be.
If your home’s previous occupants used your garden to grow fruit and vegeta-
bles, it may contain a whole range of chemicals. It takes time to get those
chemicals out of the soil so that your produce is organic — usually at least
three years. To figure out where you’re starting from, it’s very important to
obtain a soil test (contact your local agriculture extension office) to determine
what your soil may be lacking. You can get more information on reclaiming
your garden and making it organic from www.vegetablegardeningguru.
com. Other helpful sites include the National Gardening Association at www.
garden.org and the American Horticultural Society at www.ahs.org. Also
talk to your local nursery or garden center staff about the types of plants and
seeds you need for organic production.
Fruit and vegetable gardening is great for the environment in a number of ways,
but it’s even better if you employ organic gardening principles. This section
guides you through those principles, touching on crop rotation to preserve soil
integrity and nutrients, ways to use and even make your own natural fertilizer,
and strategies for getting a hand from Mother Nature’s creatures.
Rotating your crops
Rotating annual crops, which means making sure that you don’t grow the
same produce in one area more than once every four years, helps to enrich
the soil and prevent diseases and pests that attack specific plants from taking
hold. Different crops take different nutrients from the soil (with the exception
of legumes such as peas and beans, which add nutrients back to the soil), 
so rotating crops and leaving part of the land unplanted gives the soil time to
recover and replenish depleted nutrients.
Crop rotation applies to annual plants only; perennial plants that come back
every spring on their own shouldn’t be rotated. (For more on growing annuals
and perennials, refer to the earlier section “Following the seasons.”)
Here’s a simple way to rotate your crops:
1. Divide your garden into four beds (in a small space, divide your bed
into four areas).
2. Plant produce from the same family together in each bed. Families
include the following:
• Alliums such as onions and shallots
• Brassicas such as broccoli, cauliflowers, and cabbages
• Crucifers such as turnips and radishes
159
Chapter 8: Growing Your Own Food

• Cucurbits such as cucumbers, squashes, and melons
• Legumes such as peas and beans
• Mescluns such as arugula, Swiss chard, and endive
• Solanaceae such as tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant
3. Rotate your crops so that whatever you plant in bed one in the first
year goes in bed two the second year, bed three the third year, and
bed four the fourth year.
Don’t plant potatoes near tomatoes or squash, beans near onions, broccoli
near tomatoes, or carrots near dill because they actually interfere with the
growth of the other plants.
Fertilizing naturally
Fertilizer has long been used to provide plants with the nutrients they need,
such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, to grow more quickly, which 
is of course a strong benefit when you’re growing food crops. It’s important,
though, to keep the fertilizers natural in order to avoid introducing poten-
tially harmful chemicals into the environment. Compost is one of the best 
fertilizers — and if you make it yourself, it’s even free!
If your soil is a bit low on nutrients, you can add them using blood and bone
meal (which is crushed or ground blood and bone); rock potash, compost, 
or liquid fertilizer from nature; seaweed or fish emulsion; or a wormery. Your
local garden center or nursery can advise you about your soil type and how
to enrich it.
Rely on natural fertilizers rather than artificial chemicals that can get into
your food and into nearby streams. One of the most natural fertilizers is
organic compost. Compost is decayed organic material that you use as a fertil-
izer for your garden soil and growing plants. It’s made from anything that 
can rot naturally and break down with the help of the microscopic organisms
that live in it; materials include leaves, grass cuttings, sheets of newspaper,
wood chips, household waste such as fruit and vegetable scraps and coffee
grounds, and straw-based manure. If you pile your organic material for com-
posting into a heap in the garden or put it into a composting bin (which you
can get from a garden center), it eventually decays and becomes brown and
crumbly. When you dig it into your garden soil, it adds nutrients and makes
the soil richer and easier to work with. If you don’t have enough of your own
compost to start, you can buy compost, preferably the organic variety if
you’re growing organic fruits and vegetables.
Whether homemade or store-bought, compost puts back into the soil some 
of the nutrients that plants take out. It helps your soil do a better job for the
growing plants by
160
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Allowing the soil to hold moisture (which also means that you can do
less watering)
 Stopping nutrients leaching out of the soil, which means plants get more
of the nutrients they need
 Keeping the soil healthy and reducing the likelihood of soilborne disease
When fertilizing your garden, resist the temptation to use any materials based
on peat. Peat can’t be replanted and regrown quickly, so it’s not considered
sustainable. Ask your garden center for green alternatives or make your own
compost.
Creating compost out of household waste
Between one-third and half of all household waste can be turned into compost
for use in the garden rather than put in the trash to end up in the landfill.
Anything in your home that eventually decomposes can go into your compost,
including banana skins, eggshells, paper and cardboard, vegetable peelings,
and tea bags. Avoid tossing in meat, fish, newspapers, weeds, and cooked
food, though, and make sure that no cat or dog waste, glossy magazines, or
disposable diapers get into the mix.
The two key ingredients of compost are carbon (think of this as “brown”) and
nitrogen (think of this as “green”). You can find the carbon in your household
recycling bin in the form of paper and cardboard, for example, and you can
find the nitrogen in your kitchen in the form of fruit and vegetable peelings.
Add some grass cuttings, manure (farmyard animal or chicken manure with
straw in it is best), and plants (which produce nitrogen) to the mix, and with a
little time you have some great compost.
The key to good homemade compost is balancing the “brown” and “green”
ingredients. Overdoing it with any one ingredient will oversupply some of the
nutrients, which can sometimes do as much harm as good.
With proper food waste, chop everything into small pieces so that the 
composting process can work more quickly and effectively. The bigger the
pieces are, the longer it takes for the material to break down into compost.
Put the whole lot into a composting bin (see Figure 8-5), which you can get
from your local garden center, hardware store, or municipality; some towns
and cities provide them for free or at a discount. If you want to forego the bin,
devote an area of your garden to a composting heap that you can keep adding
material to.
161
Chapter 8: Growing Your Own Food

In order for the waste material to turn into compost, it needs air and water.
Follow this advice:
 Keep the compost moist to allow the thousands of bacteria and fungi to
do their work. If there’s too much moisture, the heap will be fairly smelly;
add dry ingredients such as grass clippings to correct it. If the heap is too
dry, nothing will break down; add water to correct it.
 Turn the compost over regularly with a garden fork to allow as much
oxygen to enter as possible. The more often you turn it, the quicker the
compost will be ready. Adding sticks into the compost mix also can help
facilitate air circulation in the compost.
As composting materials rot, they produce heat and micro-organisms that
speed up the rotting process. Larger organisms such as flies, worms, and 
other insects will call your compost home and contribute to the rotting
process as well.
Eventually, you get broken-down material that looks like dark earth. It can take
up to a year for small-scale composting of household material to produce com-
post that you can use in the garden, but covering the compost heap with old
carpet or using a compost bin keeps the heat in and speeds up the process.
If you live in an apartment and don’t have anywhere to keep a compost bin,
find out if there’s a community composting project near you (your local gov-
ernment office should know) or if your town offers compost (cities that collect
composting materials as part of recycling efforts sometimes make the finished
compost available to local residents). You can even start your own indoor
worm composting system (see the following section for instructions).

Letting a worm farm create compost for you
Worm farms are an ideal way to deal with small amounts of household waste
and are perfect for creating compost if you don’t have much outside space. 
A worm farm is basically an aerated bin in which you combine worms, paper
bedding, and compostable food and paper scraps. The worms munch the
vegetable and fruit peelings, paper, and cardboard that you put in the top of
the worm farm, and they process it through their digestive systems to come
out the other end as worm castings — very effective compost.
Follow these steps to create your worm composting system:
1. Buy a worm farm kit or box from your local municipality or garden
center or from a supplier over the Internet.
The farm often resembles a household plastic storage bin with holes
punched in the top and a lid.
2. Follow the kit’s instructions to create a bed for the worms, usually
from a mix of shredded newspaper, leaves, cardboard, dry grass, 
and straw.
The bedding needs to be moist, but not wet. If it feels like a well-wrung
sponge, it’s right.
3. Gather the necessary start-up material: red earthworms.
Your kit probably comes with the worms; if not, buy them from a worm
supplier, which you can find at garden centers and via the Internet. For 
a worm farm to work properly you need the right type of worms; most
experts recommend red earthworms because the average garden worm
isn’t right for the job.
4. Add food scraps to feed your worms every few days or as your kit’s
instructions indicate.
Compostable material such as vegetable and fruit scraps, tea leaves, and
coffee grounds are great worm food. Chop up the larger scraps to make
the worms’ job easier. Add the material to the bins (you usually need to
bury it slightly in the bedding).
5. Harvest your compost after three to six months.
When you notice that the food and bedding has become quite a bit
darker and you can see that it’s being converted to compost, it’s time 
to harvest. If you shine a light into the bin, the worms will move away
from it, allowing you to scoop out the compost in the top layers. Many
kits also provide a way to collect the liquid produced in the composting
163
Chapter 8: Growing Your Own Food

process, which is known as tea and can be used as liquid fertilizer for
plants. After the harvest, start your composting again by adding fresh
bedding and food to the bin.
Always follow the instructions for your worm farm kit carefully.
You can find more information about worm composting, also known as 
vermicomposting, as well as links to purchase worm composting bins at
www.compostguide.com/composting_worms.html.
Enlisting the evolutionary food 
chain to care for your crops
You don’t necessarily have to reach for a chemical pesticide to protect your
fruits and vegetables from insects — especially because not every insect is
actually a pest. Organic gardening avoids the use of chemical pesticides, so
it’s important to understand which insects and diseases can be damaging to
the plant, how to prevent them, and how to safely deal with them if you see
signs of trouble in the garden. This is known officially as integrated pest 
management, or IPM.
The most important pest prevention method is to keep your food garden
healthy: Make sure that you’re growing plants well-suited to local conditions
(refer to the earlier section “Following the seasons”), watering sufficiently, and
using natural fertilizers as recommended for your specific plants (refer to the
earlier section “Fertilizing naturally”).
Natural ways to repel pests and promote garden health include
 Planting strong-smelling plants such as onions, garlic, or marigolds in
the vegetable patch
 Planting flowers in the vegetable patch to attract beneficial critters such
as bees (which are pollinators) and birds (which eat insects)
If you spy a potential pest or disease on your beloved garden plants, use this
IPM strategy to solve the problem:
1. Identify the insect or disease.
Put a sample in a plastic bag, seal it firmly, and take it your local garden
center for identification if you aren’t able to find it online or in a 
gardening book or magazine.
2. Determine if the pest or disease is a threat to your plant.
If you’re not sure, monitor the situation to assess whether the problem
is intensifying or spreading.
164
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

3. Research natural alternatives for dealing with the specific problem.
For more information on beneficial insects and ways to attract them to
your garden, turn to Chapter 7.
4. Select the least toxic of the alternatives, and implement it.
5. Evaluate the situation to determine whether the solution has worked.
If it hasn’t, try a different method.
Getting Involved with 
Community Gardens
If you don’t have access to any space of your own but like the idea of 
gardening and growing some of your own food, consider joining a community
gardening project or even setting up one in your area if one doesn’t exist. A
community garden is essentially any plot of land that a group of people garden
together. Many are volunteer-run, perhaps located on land that belongs 
to a housing association, city council, church, school, or healthcare facility.
There’s often a team that manages the project, with people agreeing to 
contribute their time and energy to running the garden as well as growing 
the plants within it.
In general, you don’t have to become part of the team that manages the 
community garden; you can simply participate in tending the garden if that’s
where your passion lies. Each garden runs by its own rules, however, so you
may find that, in some cases, people sign up for specific duties, whereas in
others, the team assigns workers weekly to keep the garden healthy. Part of
the community garden team may include members who take responsibility
for areas such as volunteer management, fundraising, obtaining plants,
garden maintenance, and harvesting.
Many community gardens support a specific project, such as a nearby
senior’s facility, a family resource center, or a local food bank. If the garden
isn’t in support of a specific organization, the team or the volunteers as a
whole may choose where the food goes in order to offer the community the
most appropriate support.
In other situations, a community garden is simply a place where individual
gardeners can rent a piece of a larger garden in order to grow their own 
food (see Figure 8-6). (Rents may be anywhere from $10 per year and up; it
depends entirely on the specific garden.) There’s likely to be central facilities
such as irrigation or at least water faucets, and you’ll have to agree to abide
by a set of rules that everyone follows. Some gardens may be organic, for
example, or have specific opening hours.
165
Chapter 8: Growing Your Own Food

If there’s no central compost in the community garden, set aside an area for a
compost heap in your own plot, and use organic production methods to keep
your area super-green.
Community gardens are sometimes abandoned simply because they’re hard
work and because they’re not on everyone’s doorstep — it’s easier to skip
gardening chores if you’re not looking out the window everyday at what
needs to be done. If you decide to get involved with a community garden,
pick a regular gardening date (at least weekly ) when you spend a few hours
or less on your garden rather than trying to do all the work in one visit,
catching up with chores and ending up exhausted with a sore back.
To find a community garden in your area or to find out how to set one up,
visit the American Community Gardening Association’s Web site at www.
communitygarden.org. You also can find local gardens by searching the
Internet using the keywords “community garden” and your town or city.
Helping Your Harvest Last
Particularly if you live in a climate where you have a distinct growing season,
you may find that you also have a distinct harvest season. Set some time aside
to bring in the fruits and vegetables that your garden has produced and to
preserve them so that they’ll contribute to your table for as long as possible.
Figure 8-6:

nity garden

Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Here are a few ideas for prolonging your harvest:
 Preserving: Turn berries and other fruit into jams and jellies, vegeta-
bles into pickles, and tomatoes into sauces — you get the idea! Store 
preserved foods in carefully sterilized and sealed glass jars to prevent
spoilage.
 Freezing: If you have an energy-efficient chest freezer, you can freeze a
lot of fruits and vegetables to enjoy throughout the year. To preserve
color and freshness, you may need to blanch some vegetables first by
plunging them into boiling water for a couple of minutes and then into
cold water. You can even preserve items such as fruit pies by filling
uncooked pastry with the fruit mixture and freezing the whole uncooked
pie. Just thaw, bake, and serve!
 Drying: Some fruits and vegetables can be dried for use in cooking 
later on.
 Cold storing: Some foods, such as apples and potatoes, keep for weeks
or even months if they’re stored in a cool, dark place such as a basement.
You can find freezing and preserving tips and techniques in Canning &
Preserving For Dummies by Karen Ward (Wiley). The National Center for Home
Food Preservation (www.uga.edu/nchfp) also has excellent background
information.
If you find that you have extra food that you don’t have time to preserve or
room to store, offer it to friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors. They’ll
likely welcome the opportunity to enjoy items fresh from the garden. If they
have their own gardens, you may even be able to trade a few crops with them;
for example, perhaps they grew too much corn and you have extra beets —
just swap.
Also consider donating your extra produce to a local food bank or community-
based organization that prepares meals for those who need extra help. Phone
the organization first to find out if they have any special needs.

Raising Green Kids
In This Chapter
 Finding ways to make your nursery and baby’s life green
 Bringing up children in an eco-friendly home environment
 Getting involved in making schools greener
 Helping your child carry green practices into college
T
he earlier you encourage your children to become interested in green
choices and issues, the more likely they are to carry that interest through
the rest of their lives. With that kind of head start, imagine how much better
off the planet will be when they’re done with it!
Setting a great green example for your children is an excellent beginning.
Then add fun green activities and get involved to encourage your children’s
schools to be as green as possible. What you do in your own home to live 
a greener lifestyle can translate to the school environment, and what your
children learn at school can be put to good use at home — everyone benefits.
This chapter shows you how to best instill green values in your youngsters
as well as how to live greenly with a baby, who likely values only milk, mushy
foods, and snuggling.
Greening Your Baby
There’s nothing like starting the green lifestyle immediately — even before
your children arrive in the world. From the items you surround them with 
to the items you dress them in, you have plenty of opportunities to keep the
materials as natural and organic as possible. You may want to encourage
friends and family who may buy baby gifts for you to go green as well — 
providing hints about where they can find greener items can help. The
increasing number of stores that carry environmentally friendly goods for
babies is making this much easier.

Opting for the most organic and/or local food possible (including breastfeeding
if possible) for your baby is not only environmentally friendly but also healthy.
(You can find general information on eating green in Chapter 10.)
Equipping the green nursery
When going green in the nursery, you can take a variety of approaches. Using
natural and organic materials whenever possible is one way to reduce the
amount of potentially harmful substances that your baby comes in contact
with. Another way to focus on ecological protection is simply to reduce the
number of items that you buy.
The list of baby paraphernalia, from clothing to furniture and everything in
between, can appear endless at first, and if you’re having your first child, it’s
difficult to know what you really need. Get recommendations from other 
parents: Find out what they used a lot and what they hardly used at all. For
example, you may be able to forego a changing table in favor of a low dresser
with a pad on top. Your child can keep the dresser and get more use out of it
over the years than a changing table. It’s important to stay true to your own
lifestyle, however. If you love to jog and find that it’s an excellent stress
reliever, go ahead and invest in a good quality wheeled baby carrier that you
can jog behind in comfort. (Look for one that’s secondhand rather than
buying new.) You’ll be happier and healthier, which helps your baby to be
happy and healthy.
Consider obtaining just these essentials before the baby is born, and add to
your list gradually as you find out whether you really need other items:
 Diapers: See the later section “Choosing cloth versus disposable 
diapers.”
 Clothing: Look for comfy secondhand clothes in good condition, and
forget about all the fancy outfits — they’re more for you than the baby
anyway.
 Blankets: Try baby sleeping bags, which are less fuss than blankets.
 Personal baby care: Many experts recommend plain old olive oil for 
use as baby skin lotion.
 Car seats: Because anchoring car seats properly is a major safety 
issue and could mean the difference between life and death for your
child, relax your green rules here and buy an extra car seat if you have
more than one vehicle in which the child will be riding (this includes
grandparents’ cars). Buy new car seats, or ensure that secondhand 
car seats are in excellent condition.
 Crib: Look for a crib that turns into a child’s bed to reduce the amount
of furniture you need to buy later on.
170
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Toys: Opt for secondhand toys, soft toys made from organic cotton, and
wood toys with nontoxic paints. And keep the number of toys in check.
 High chair: This really does make feeding so much easier.
 Baby buggy/stroller: Look for one that does double duty, converting
from a buggy for young babies to a stroller for older babies and toddlers.
For lots more information, treehugger.com has a section on greening your
baby; also, you can find lots of eco-friendly baby products at ecobaby.com
and information on a green nursery at www.thegreenguide.com/doc/
119/greenroomtogrow.
When choosing materials such as paint, furniture, and flooring for your 
nursery, be aware that many new materials that have a distinctive smell 
(like the scent that new cars often have) are actually offgassing, or releasing
volatile organic chemicals into the air. These chemicals, also known as VOCs,
include formaldehyde and toluene and have been linked with health effects
that range from breathing passage irritation to cancer. It’s best to try to 
avoid items with VOCs, especially plywood, particleboard, and upholstered
furniture or mattresses that contain formaldehyde or PBDEs (polybromi-
nated diphenyl ethers) as flame retardants; Ikea and Select Comfort are two 
companies that have said they’re avoiding these substances in upholstery
and mattresses. You also can decorate the nursery well before the baby
arrives in order to let new materials offgas or keep new items outside or in
the garage for a few days to let the worst of the gases dissipate (the items
release significantly more gases when they’re new).
Here are some strategies for choosing the most eco-friendly items for your
nursery:
 Décor: Choose natural materials wherever possible, including flooring of
solid wood, linoleum, bamboo, cork, or organic cotton or wool carpets;
water-based finishes for hardwood floors; paint that contains low or no
VOCs ; wooden shutters instead of curtains; and soft furnishings made
from natural, organic fabrics.
 Furniture: Select solid wood furniture with nontoxic finishes, and ensure
that the item is durable. You may have to spend a little more on quality,
well-constructed furniture, but the fact that it will hold up much longer
than other offerings makes it worthwhile. Further lengthen the life of
nursery furniture by selecting multipurpose furniture: a crib that can
later become a bed, for example, or a changing table that incorporates a
chest of drawers. Look for mattresses made from natural materials such
as rubber and organic wool or cotton.
 Clothing: Natural fibers are great, but organic natural fibers are even
better: Wool, cotton, hemp, and even bamboo if it comes from sustain-
able and chemical-free sources are all green options that are becoming
more widely available in stores and online.
171
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

 Baby care: Look for products made from natural, organic, and fragrance-
free ingredients. Avoid antibacterial products, and minimize chemical-
impregnated items such as wipes — look for biodegradable, chlorine-
free wipes, for example, from Seventh Generation and other eco-friendly
companies, or use washcloths instead. (Because the issue of cloth versus
disposable diapers is a bigger discussion, we devote the whole next 
section to it.)
 Cleaners: Avoid antibacterial and chemical cleaners. Instead use naturally
based products, from household cleaners to laundry detergents. Stay
away from chemical-based fabric softeners, too. More information about
natural versus chemical cleaners appears in Chapter 5, but you can look
for products such as Ecover, Method’s Free & Clear line, Restore, and
Seventh Generation for greener alternatives to conventional cleaning and
laundry products.
Choosing cloth versus disposable diapers
It’s the big question for prospective parents: Will you use cloth diapers or 
disposable ones? Considering that the little tykes need approximately 6,000 
of the absorbent necessities before they graduate to being toilet-trained, it’s a
big question and an important one. Is it better to go with disposable and add
to the nation’s waste or go with cloth and add to the energy output required
to launder them (as well as the inconvenience of having to deal with the mess
post-baby-cleanup)?
On the pro side of disposables, they’re easy; on the con side, they take
upwards of 500 years to decompose in landfills, and the 18 billion that get
thrown out in the United States annually consume approximately 100,000 tons
of plastic and 800,000 tons of tree pulp every year — not exactly the greenest
products. Plus, there’s the question of what’s hidden within them, namely
dioxin, a byproduct of bleaching the pulp, which has been linked to cancer,
plus other chemicals and fragrances that can cause allergic reactions.
Enter cloth diapers, which have the major disadvantage that they’re not 
convenient — you generally have to presoak the dirty diapers and then wash
them in the washing machine (or at least rinse them and have a laundry 
service take care of washing them). This all means that you’re handling dirty
diapers several times instead of once (as with disposable). Odor also may be
an issue, and the time involved to deal with the dirty diapers most definitely 
is something to think about, too. Removable, biodegradable, flushable liners
for cloth diapers can make the worst of the waste much easier to dispose of —
it gets flushed away with an environmental impact far less than that of a 
disposable diaper (which, of course, isn’t flushable at all). (One option is
gDiapers, cloth diapers that use plastic-free, flushable inserts for easier
cleanup; visit www.gdiapers.com for details.) However, the mess involved
with cloth diapers is an issue for many parents, especially when the child 
has a tummy bug.
172
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

The advantage is that you can use cloth diapers again and again, and some
studies indicate that cloth can help if your baby’s prone to diaper rash. Other
studies have shown that washing diapers takes about the equivalent amount 
of water as flushing a toilet five times a day for the same period (which may be
less than you imagined it would take) and that even when you throw in the
energy that your washing machine uses, cloth diapers have half the ecological
footprint of disposables (even less if you use a laundry service). (See Chapter 1
for a discussion about ecological or environmental footprints.)
So . . . the ultimate in eco-friendliness where diaper duty is concerned appears
to be cloth. The good news is that cloth diapers are much more parent-friendly
than they used to be. Forget about pins: The new versions come with snaps or
hook-and-loop tape for easy on and easy off. They also come in organic fabric
options, including hemp, bamboo, and cotton, and you can choose organic
wool covers that help protect the diaper against leaks, too.
Washing cloth diapers is one occasion when you shouldn’t save energy by
using a cold wash cycle. Hot water kills germs, which is especially important
because the clean diapers go back on your baby. (It’s no good being green if it
negatively affects hygiene.) Presoak cloth diapers in hot water, and then wash
in hot water with a cold rinse using detergent that’s free of perfumes or dyes.
173
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids
Finding secondhand treasures 
for babies and children
Considering how quickly babies grow out of
clothes and furniture, it’s both green and econom-
ical to look for good-quality secondhand items. You
don’t pay nearly as much for the items as you would
if they were new, and you reuse them, which is 
one of the best ways to keep them out of the 
trash. Check out the following places for finding
secondhand items:
 Garage sales
 Swap sessions
 Friends, family members, and coworkers
whose children are older than yours
 Internet sites such as www.freecycle.
org, www.kijiji.com, and www.
craigslist.org
 Newspaper classifieds, especially in free
papers in your town or city
 Thrift and consignment stores
Remember: When buying secondhand items for
your children, pay close attention to hygiene and
safety issues. Check to ensure that the item hasn’t
been part of a recall (the manufacturer’s Web site
usually notes recalls, as does the Consumer
Product Safety Commission at www.cpsc.gov;
you also can enter the product name into your
favorite Internet search engine to find out how
other people like the item). It’s best to stick to cloth-
ing, newer non-electronic toys in good condition,
books, movies, and sturdy furniture, and avoid
potentially dangerous items such as mattresses,
cribs, car seats, strollers, baby gates, baby walk-
ers, jewelry (which may contain lead), playpens,
and older electronics — all of which may not meet
current child safety standards.

Don’t use fabric softener, which can reduce absorbency and cause allergic 
reactions or irritation.
When it comes to diapers, you don’t have to go all the way in either direction.
In fact, some childcare providers don’t allow cloth diapers, so you may have
to compromise there. Or you could use cloth at home and save disposable for
when you’re out and about or for when your child has a digestive upset and
you could really use the extra convenience. If you choose disposable diapers,
opt for chlorine-free, biodegradable versions in order to be friendlier to the
environment and your baby. And whether you use cloth or disposable, change
diapers regularly to help prevent diaper rash, and dump the waste down the
toilet before either laundering or throwing diapers out (this puts human waste
where it should be, which is in the sewer system, not the landfill).
Getting friends and family onboard
Raising children is an expensive and sometimes exhausting proposition, so any
help when it comes to gifts or time is always welcome. Accepting those gifts
can be difficult, however, if they come with an environmental price that you’d
prefer not to pay. If you’re much greener than your family and friends, gently
let them know the best ways to help you.
It’s essential to communicate your desires clearly but without being so strident
that you alienate people. In some cases, setting an example may suffice; for
example, wrap gifts in reusable fabric instead of in paper that’s often thrown
away. You also can try creating a green gift list that offers gift suggestions with
enough detail to let people know what your concerns are, such as asking for
organic-cotton cloth diapers.
Check out local and online stores to see if their gift registries (which are often
welcomed by people who want to give useful, practical gifts) include green
items. You can also approach this in the reverse: Find a supplier of green items,
and ask if it offers a gift registry.
If you discover that stores with gift registries don’t have green items or suppli-
ers of green items don’t have gift registries, it’s time to draw up your own list
complete with item descriptions, quantities, and stores (bricks-and-mortar or
online) where items can be purchased. The Web site www.mygiftlist.com
helps to automate the process, providing a central place for people to see and
interact with your list. You set up your MyGiftList gift registry to contain items
you request from a variety of stores, and you can include Internet links for con-
venient purchasing. Essentially, it works like the typical gift registry except that
it’s not limited to one store.
Even if you don’t entirely agree with family and friends when it comes to their
practices or preferences, compromise is never a bad thing for keeping the
peace and gaining a little much-needed respite. If using disposable diapers for
an afternoon means having your mom come over for a few hours so that you
174
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

can go out for a quiet cup of coffee, then go for it. Maintaining your sanity, after
all, is all-important.
Instilling Green Values at Home
It has been our experience that children understand green issues — some-
times even better than adults do. Children’s curiosity about the world gives
them a natural empathy for the state of the environment, for the plight of the
animals within it, and even for the situations faced by children in developing
countries. When children feel that there’s something they can do to help or
to make a difference, they usually go to it with enthusiasm.
The most effective way to teach your children to live a green lifestyle — with
care and consideration for the environment, animals, and people with whom
they share the world — is to live that lifestyle yourself and become a life-size
example. When kids see you picking up trash from the park even though you
weren’t the one who dropped it, they see value in keeping public places
clean. When they see you volunteering your time for a worthy cause, they see
that giving back to society is worthwhile and important.
From walking them to school to finding ways to reduce your family’s trash,
every choice that you make helps your children to make green choices, 
too. Involving them in the decision-making — in an age-appropriate way, of
course — also helps them to learn how to continue making even bigger green
decisions as they get older. After all, if they grow up green, a sustainable
lifestyle will come naturally to them, allowing them to pass that along to their
friends, colleagues, and eventually their own children. That creates a very
positive, long-lasting ripple effect.
Starting kids young with green 
behaviors and activities
Even young children can gain an appreciation for nature and what it takes to
protect it. Head outside with them whenever you can and introduce them to
the wonder that’s the world, from grass to caterpillars to daisies. Help them
to understand that the world is theirs to enjoy and protect; their desire to
safeguard it will come naturally.
When you do something at home to make your life greener, explain the
change and your reasons to your children, but don’t force changes on them.
Lead by example, and they’ll likely adopt your plans far more quickly than if
you were to force them into something.
Use these suggestions to introduce your children to green living:
175
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

 Choose an active lifestyle. Walk, bike, and play with your children 
regularly.
 Opt for public transportation. Use the car only when necessary; other-
wise, demonstrate a commitment to public transportation by taking
trains and buses with your children. (Chapter 13 looks into transport.)
 Ask for their help. Younger children in particular may be proud and
happy to contribute to grown-up activities. Have them carry a small
bucket of vegetable scraps from under the sink to the compost bin, for
example, and have them help you dig out the resulting soil to put on
garden beds. They can even help you sort your recycling if you handle
the potentially sharp edges on cans and glass, leaving them with safer
items. (Turn to Chapter 8 for composting information and Chapter 6 for
recycling coverage.)
Older children may want to get involved with green activities such as
cleaning up their neighborhood and organizing the household recycling
because they’ve learned about environmental issues at school. If they’re
not enthusiastic, however, you may need to convince them by making it
a family-time activity that you do together or by making their allowance
partially conditional on their help with such projects around the house.
 Introduce them to growers. Take kids with you to places such as 
farmers’ markets and farms where you pick items yourself so that they
understand that food doesn’t just come from supermarket shelves.
 Consider introducing them to wildlife. Petting farms for younger kids
may help them to understand that there’s a whole other world beyond
their community and prevent farm animals from becoming something
that they see only in books or on television. Although zoos are a con-
tentious issue within the green community — many people believe that
wild animals shouldn’t be kept in any kind of enclosures — they offer a
valuable educational and conservation lesson (many zoos are involved
in breeding programs to help support the population of threatened or
endangered species, for example). If you feel that going to a zoo will help
your children understand the wider global environment, look for a zoo
that’s actively involved in conservation, is accredited through the
American Zoo and Aquarium Association (www.aza.org/FindZoo
Aquarium), and provides its animals with as natural an environment as
possible along with plenty of mental stimulation.
 Create a family garden, and get the kids involved. Gardens are places
where the whole family can practice being green. Here are some specific
gardening suggestions:
• Put each person in charge of some green aspect of your outside
space. Children will probably love the compost and the worm farm
(see Chapter 8).
• Provide everyone with an area in which to grow his or her own veg-
etables or flowers. People of all ages can get very competitive with
each other when it comes to who can grow plants most successfully!
176
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

• Suggest that the kids count all the different species that come into
your garden and announce each new arrival.
• If a family member can’t or doesn’t want to do any of the outdoor
work, put him or her in charge of researching alternative green
materials and native plants that would work in the garden.
Even if you don’t have space for a garden, you can involve your kids in
fun tasks such as planting window boxes and pots with herbs and salad
leaves or sorting out kitchen waste for composting in a compost bin or
worm farm.
 Limit consumption. Choose well-made, durable, quality toys over quan-
tity (see the next section for more details about quality green toys). Talk
to family and friends about not overwhelming children with too many
gifts and about checking with you first if they’re considering a big gift.
Encourage kids to donate toys they no longer use to other children.
 Encourage conservation. Let kids know that resource-conserving habits
such as switching off lights and turning off water when brushing their
teeth are expected — and even rewarded.
You don’t have to become a paragon of green overnight, and you shouldn’t
expect your children to either. Start with the things that are easiest to change
and remember that every little bit helps. Add more changes gradually, and
your family will soon be living greener without even realizing it!
Finding green toys
Thanks to the growing green movement and the Internet, finding toys that 
fit the environmentally friendly lifestyle is much easier than it used to be.
Although you don’t want to cut off your children from tools such as electron-
ics that can help them learn, it’s a good idea to aim for a balance between
screen-oriented playthings and those that boost their imagination, especially
if the latter don’t expose them to harmful materials.
When looking for green toys, keep these points in mind:
 Choose natural materials. Toys made from solid wood and nontoxic 
finishes are your best bet along with those made from natural, prefer-
ably organic, fabrics. Avoid soft plastics that contain PVC, which 
has been linked to health hazards. For babies and toddlers, you can
choose stuffed toys that are made from organic cotton and puzzles and
pull-along toys that are made from solid wood and nontoxic paints.
 Free up energy. Choose well-made, durable toys that will last for a long
time. The fewer toys that you have to replace, the more energy you save
in the processes that manufacture the toys in the first place, and the
fewer toys end up in the landfill. Also look for toys that don’t require bat-
teries and toys that are driven by alternative energy, such as solar power.
177
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

(You can find solar-powered frogs, robots, and cars suitable for children
aged about 5 through 10 at many toy stores and online at fatbrain
toys.com.)
 Boost imagination. Ensure that your children have access to unstruc-
tured play opportunities, whether outdoors or in. Science-based kits are
great sources of inspiration and cover every subject from gardening to
chemistry to arts and crafts, but even a collection of eco-friendly dress-
up clothes (made from natural fabrics or secondhand items from friends
and family) or a collection of building blocks, Legos, or a Meccano set 
(as age appropriate) can provide hours of imaginative fun. See the nearby
sidebar on “The necessity of unstructured play” for more explanation
and ideas.
 Go local or Fairtrade. Find out if local artisans or manufacturers 
produce toys near you, and support their businesses. Buying locally
helps to reduce the energy costs associated with transporting toys to
your local store. If you’re considering toys that were made elsewhere,
research the manufacturer to find out who made them; look for toys 
that are certified under Fairtrade programs to ensure that those involved
in the manufacturing process were treated well and paid fairly. Local, 
independent toy stores may carry Fairtrade toys; if not, check out www.
tenthousandvillages.com, which offers a selection of toys including
rattles, puzzles, mobiles, simple musical instruments, kites, and games,
all of which are Fairtrade items.
178
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 
The necessity of unstructured play
An increasing number of child development experts
and studies are sounding the alarm about children
who spend too much time in front of televisions,
computers, and screen-based games, no matter
how educational their content. In fact, 270 profes-
sionals (including psychologists) based around the
world wrote a letter in September 2007 to the Daily
Telegraph newspaper in the United Kingdom 
stating that children need creative play time, on their
own and with other children, for healthy develop-
ment of empathy for others and problem-solving
skills, for example.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (www.aap.
org/pressroom/playFINAL.pdf) agrees,
stating that play — which has been recognized by
the United Nations High Commission for Human
Rights as a right of every child — allows children 
to use their creativity while developing their imagi-
nation; dexterity; and physical, cognitive, and emo-
tional strength. In particular, the academy noted that
undirected play allows children to develop new
skills and resilience, along with skills related to 
sharing, negotiating, and resolving conflicts.

Involving children in green choices
Children like to be able to teach their parents a thing or two, so give them 
the chance to take the lead at home. Put them in charge of various aspects of
your environmental policy at home, and they’ll likely love the role. You can
help them take this leadership position by involving them in decision making
around the house.
Ask them to come up with energy-saving changes, for example. When they
decide on their own that it’s better to switch off the TV when they’re not
using it — and to switch it off by unplugging it from the wall or turning off the
power strip — they’re more likely to translate that into action. Depending on
their ages, you may ask them to help you do the following things:
 Plan healthy, green family menus and then turn them into a shopping list.
 Find items around the house to reuse, such as turning computer paper
printed on one side only into notebooks or scrap paper for art projects.
 Sort through their toys to find items that they’d like to donate to children
in need in their community.
 Save money as a family to help a charity either at home or around the
world; examples include donating to a local food bank or helping a 
community in Africa build a well to provide a reliable source of water.
 Set up bins and a composter to make it easy to organize recycling efforts
(see Chapter 6).
Carrying on the lifestyle 
when school starts
Green education starts before children even arrive at school when you
choose eco-friendly transportation such as walking or carpooling to get to
and from the classroom. In some cases, of course, it’s necessary for children
to take big yellow school buses to school; that’s actually a very green way to
go, too, despite the bus color. Another simple way to keep your child green 
at school is to load them up with green school supplies.
Walking to school
If your children’s schools are close enough to walk to, leave the car in the
garage. Explain to your kids that when you take short journeys in the car, it
doesn’t have enough time to warm up to run most efficiently and so those
journeys cause the most pollution. Walking is the greenest way to travel and
does the least damage to the environment.
179
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

When you decide to walk your kids to school, don’t forget to get up a bit ear-
lier in the mornings or you’ll end up stressed out by trying to get everyone
ready and out of the house on time — and added stress isn’t the aim of green
living! Start out easy by walking on mild, dry mornings and driving when the
weather’s rainy or freezing. Gradually work up to walking even when the
weather’s not so good.
Children love to hang out with their friends, so consider joining forces with
the friends’ parents if they travel the same path to school as you and your
children. This arrangement can give you adult company to chat with, or you
can split the task of walking with the children to school. If enough children in
your area head in the same direction to school, consider setting up a walking
bus in which the children all walk together with a parent at the front as the
“driver” and a parent at the back. The British Web site
www.walkingbus.com has all sorts of information about the benefits of
walking to school and how the walking bus works.
Walking isn’t just green. It’s good exercise and saves you money. You may
even get your kids to school faster than if you were navigating busy streets 
in the car.
When your children are old enough and competent enough on bicycles, let
them cycle to school. Consider enrolling them in a cycling proficiency class
so that you both feel confident that they can handle themselves safely in traf-
fic. Check with your children’s schools, the local police department, or your
town’s parks and recreation organization to find out about safety course
offerings.
Setting up a carpool
If you have to drive your children to school, you can cut down on the number
of cars all going in the same direction each morning and afternoon by sharing
the school run. Organize a group of parents to pick up the number of children
that can safely be transported in the smallest car, and then take it in turns.
To set up a carpool effectively, first talk to parents you know, such as the
ones you see when you drop off your kids or others in your neighborhood, to
find out if their children’s schedules match yours. Find out which days work
best (or worst) for them, and create a schedule that works for everyone, dis-
tributing the driving responsibilities evenly. If the driving can’t be shared
equally, suggest that a small fee be paid to help out with the drivers’ fuel and
maintenance bills.
Carpools are easiest to manage if they involve only two to three families.
For safety reasons, it’s essential that everyone involved in the carpool 
have full contact information for all the children’s parents, along with the
children’s addresses, allergy notes, and any important health information.
Parents should introduce their own children to the parents who are driving
so that “stranger danger” strategies can be maintained.
180
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Have a system in place to notify the day’s driver if something happens to pre-
vent a child from taking the carpool. For example, a phone tree in which each
parent calls and passes along messages to another parent may work best in
these situations. Also consider making up a schedule that can be e-mailed
and printed out in order to keep everyone on track. Also agree ahead of time
on rules, such as everyone wears their seatbelts, appropriate behavior while
in the car, and no stopping while on the carpool run.
Not only does sharing the school run save fuel and reduce the carbon emis-
sions caused by multiple cars, but it also saves everyone time and money.
Carpooling also gives you more flexibility because you don’t always have to
be there to pick up your children after school.
Stocking up on green school supplies
When your kids head to school, their bags should be filled with as many 
green school supplies as possible. Look for solar-powered calculators to save
on batteries, for example, and for post-consumer recycled paper content in
printed products such as loose-leaf paper and notebooks. Glue, crayons, and
markers should be nontoxic, and lunches should be packed in reusable con-
tainers rather than disposable plastic and paper bags. Rather than re-using
plastic water bottles, which can leach chemicals into the liquid they contain,
consider using stainless steel beverage containers such as a Klean Kanteens
(www.kleankanteen.com), which are not only lightweight but also child-
friendly (you can purchase a sippy cup version of the Klean Kanteen for
younger children).
Many office supply stores now stock green paper products along with Energy
Star-certified computers (that is, models that consume the least possible
amount of energy; see www.energystar.gov). An Internet search for specific
items will also turn up green suppliers such as www.thegreenoffice.com
and www.greenearthofficesupply.com from whom you can order online.
Actions often speak louder than words. If you’re involved with your child’s
classroom as a room parent, for example, who brings in snacks for the class,
consider bringing green snacks (such as fruit and veggies with lower fat 
dips or homemade cookies or muffins from reduced fat recipes). As long as
the food is yummy, the kids will enjoy it — and if the kids enjoy it and ask 
for more, you can send the recipes or ideas home with them in a classroom
newsletter.
Partnering with Your Child’s School
Green living is a hot topic in schools throughout the U.S. Many run green 
projects that get students involved, and many incorporate green issues as 
an integral part of social studies, science, and geography classes. But there’s
no national policy on whether and how to teach children about being green,
181
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

so what your children learn usually depends on the individual teacher, the
principal, and the local school board. Getting involved at your children’s
schools — and setting a great example — can make a difference to how much
your child learns at school about the environment. Keep in mind, though,
that teaching green issues isn’t all that’s important; the safety and efficiency
of the school itself is something to consider. From energy efficiency to 
building materials, the school plays an important role in creating a positive,
comfortable, and safe place for your children to learn.
One very good way to help make your child’s school greener is to become 
a part of the parent body that supports and helps to manage the school.
Whether your child’s educational institution has a Parent-Teacher Association
(PTA), school council, or other parent committee, sign up and get involved.
You can even volunteer to head up a “green” committee. If you’re not one for
committees, there are other ways to make your influence felt.
Raising awareness about green issues
As a member of the PTA — or even as a concerned parent — you can help the
environment by (tactfully) raising awareness about all kinds of green issues
at your children’s school.
Step 1: Assessing the school’s green factor
Chances are good that your children’s school is already looking at environ-
mentally friendly initiatives, so it’s best to first find out what the situation 
is, and then consider how your efforts could contribute to the school’s
efforts. To determine where green policy gaps are and why they exist, first
pay attention to what your kids tell you about school. You’re likely to notice
green topics coming up in homework for various subjects, and you may even
hear about green activities such as tree planting or classroom recycling.
Supporting these efforts is a great way to get involved, and you can extend
your influence by finding out where gaps exist in the school’s green policies
or strategies.
If you have a good working relationship with your child’s teacher, and you
know that he or she is interested in green issues too, you may be able to sit
down over a cup of tea or coffee and simply chat about the various issues. 
If, however, you don’t think this will be useful (the teacher is too busy, for
example), try requesting a meeting with the principal or vice-principal. The
administrative assistants in the school’s office will be able to tell you who’s
responsible for school infrastructure and programs — you may find that
someone has already been assigned to manage environmental issues. In 
some cases, you’ll probably want to talk to more than one person; school
programs, for example, may be handled at the principal level, and the deci-
sions about where to source cleaning supplies and building maintenance 
may be handled at the school district level.
182
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

To assess how environmentally aware your child’s school is, seek answers 
to the following questions, keeping in mind that when you sit down with a
school representative, it’s best to keep the conversation focused on positives
(for example, noting that you’re trying to find out where parents can help
provide solutions rather than taking an accusatory “the school’s not doing
enough” tone):
 Energy sources: How does the school obtain its heat and power: from
carbon-based utility providers or from renewable sources such as solar
or geothermal heat?
 Energy efficiency: Are programs in place to encourage staff and students
to reduce energy use? Has the school initiated a building operation and
maintenance policy that includes energy efficiency?
 Sourcing: When furnishing classrooms and buying everyday supplies,
does the school have an environmentally friendly policy that ensures 
the purchase of healthy materials (avoiding particleboard, for example)
and as much recycled content as possible (particularly in paper)? Are
cleaning, art, and chemistry supplies environmentally friendly?
 Waste reduction: Are programs for reuse (for items such as paper) and
recycling (for items such as newspapers, metal cans, glass, and plastics)
in place?
 Food: Are healthy food choices such as vegetables and fruit more readily
available to students than junk foods? Are cafeteria foods sourced from
organic and/or local growers?
 Classroom content: Are green topics covered in social studies, English,
second language, and math classes?
 Outdoor spaces: Do students and staff have access to pleasant, natural
outdoor areas? Are outdoor areas maintained without the use of chemi-
cal fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides?
 Building health: Does the school have a fragrance-free policy to help
people who have allergies or asthma? Is the school checked on at least a
semiannual basis for mold growth (which has been linked to health
issues, especially respiratory illnesses)?
 Transportation: Do schools actively promote the safe and effective use of
public transportation or busing systems if children can’t walk to school?
Step 2: Proposing ideas
After you gather information and insight from school leaders, you may decide
to approach them with ideas for improvements. Start by suggesting ways to
make things greener that won’t cost the school much money or that parents
and students can support through fundraising. Consider the following ideas:
 Recycling initiatives: Offer to provide recycling and composting bins,
for example, along with presentations to students and teachers about
how recycling works.
183
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

• Paper: Encourage the school to use recycled paper and to install 
a large recycling container for discarded paper, magazines, and
cardboard. In more than 20 U.S. cities, the Abitibi Paper Retriever
program (www.paperretriever.com) provides paper recycling
facilities such as containers at schools and then rewards the
schools with money toward fundraising programs based on the
amount of paper recycled. If there isn’t a Paper Retriever or 
similar program operating in your city, check www.recycling-
revolution.com/recycle-newspaper.html for tips about
organizing a local newspaper recycling drive.
• Ink: Ask your child’s teacher or principal to set up a recycling 
program for printer cartridges or to give you permission to set 
one up (many schools would love to do this, but their personnel
simply don’t have the time to manage it). Several ink cartridge
recycling programs operate as school fundraising programs,
including www.kartridgesforkidz.com and www.earth
tonesolutions.com. Refilling the cartridges also may be an
option if the printer warranties allow this; many office supply
stores offer this service for a nominal fee. The important thing is 
to make sure that the school doesn’t just put ink cartridges in the
trash when they run out.
• Food and compost containers: If the school doesn’t have recycling
containers in the dining hall or cafeteria, talk to the principal about
getting some for cans, bottles, and plastics. Waste food should 
be turned into compost, so you should ask about designating a
container for that, too.
 Energy efficiency improvements: The Alliance to Save Energy says 
that schools spend more on energy than on computers and textbooks
combined and that saving money on energy can free up funds for use in
other school programs. The organization has launched a Green Schools
Program that gets 5 to 15 schools in a district involved at a time, with a
team of teachers, custodial staff, administrators, and students carrying
out hands-on projects within the school to save energy through opera-
tions, maintenance, and behavior changes. You can find out where the
project is operating or how to bring it to your district at www.ase.org/
section/program/greenschl/aboutgs. See the sidebar “Tips from
the Green Schools Program” for more tips from the alliance.
 Carpool Web site: If you’re handy with technology (or know someone
who is — including students at the school), design a Web site that helps
parents connect for carpooling. The site also can incorporate walking
and bus route information and other public transportation tips if 
appropriate.
184
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

 Green school lunches: School lunches can be a controversial issue as
the government worries about the rising levels of childhood obesity and
schools worry about funding for meals. If you’re concerned about the
quality of food your child gets in the cafeteria, make a presentation to
the principal and possibly the local school board in order to persuade
them that the food should be as green as possible.
• Step 1: Start by outlining the health issues involved. Cutting
down on fat and sugar content and boosting fresh fruit and vegeta-
bles, for example, can help children maintain healthy weight levels
and boost their attention span and energy. Much seasonal food can
be bought locally rather than imported, thereby promoting green
living on a number of fronts. You can find evidence to support your
case in Chapter 10, which addresses eating green.
• Step 2: Take a look at current costs compared to the costs of 
supplying healthier options. You may need to do quite a bit of
research here, but your school’s annual report or administration
should be a good starting point for current costs and suppliers.
Local catering companies operating healthy lunch programs in
other schools may be able to help in terms of providing costing
alternatives in your school.
• Step 3: Offer ideas for additional funding if necessary. If your
school isn’t already part of the National School Lunch Program
(www.healthyschoollunches.org), a federally assisted school
lunch program that provides funding for schools that follow the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Dietary Guidelines for child nutri-
tion, you can suggest that this may be a source of funding. The pro-
gram is especially applicable if the school has a number of children
who receive free or reduced-price lunches due to their family finan-
cial or other circumstances. Alternatively, consider fundraising
efforts to cover additional costs, or suggest a vote by parents on
the issue of raising fees to cover the costs.
School administrators have limited budgets to spend on school meals,
so they may be resistant to changes that cost more money. One of the
best resources to help you help the school to change is celebrity chef
Jamie Oliver, specifically his Web site at www.channel4.com/life/
microsites/J/jamies_school_dinners. Although Oliver focuses
on the United Kingdom and uses some terminology that may be unfamil-
iar (“school governors” instead of “school boards,” for example, and
“head teachers” instead of “principals”), his campaign to get British
schools serving healthy, greener school lunches (also known as “school
dinners”) offers lots of background information about why this issue is
important, along with detailed instructions on how you can get involved
with change as a parent.
If the school can’t go green in terms of food, suggest a vegetable garden
on school grounds. If you can only make a change on the small, personal
level, send your children to school with green packed lunches.
185
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

Encourage the school to register with an environmental program that 
provides information and tips for making the school a greener place, 
such as the Alliance to Save Energy’s Green Schools program at
186
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 
Tips from the Green Schools Program
The Alliance to Save Energy (www.ase.org/
section/program/greenschl) offers these
ten excellent tips from their Green Schools
Program to help you implement a school-wide
energy efficiency program:
1. Identify a Green Schools “champion” who
knows the school system well and can 
provide the vision and initial drive to get the
program started. The champion finds internal
support for the program, identifies and 
convenes partners, promotes activities, and
troubleshoots problems.
2. Establish a Green Schools team within the
school building. Involving students, teachers,
principals, custodians, and even parents will
enhance the program’s reach and effective-
ness.
3. Build partnerships within your school and
with local organizations and businesses.
These partnerships can be a great source 
of technical, educational, and financial
resources.
4. Adapt the project to your school’s priorities
and curriculum.Making the program your own
will help energy efficiency become a regular
part of your school’s culture and will likely
result in greater long-term savings.
5. Identify curriculum tie-ins. There are many
ways that the Green Schools program can
support your school’s curriculum. It focuses on
education through hands-on experience —
key concepts tie in with science, math, social
studies, and economics curricula.
6. Develop an agreement with the school district
administration to return a percentage of sav-
ings to the individual schools that achieved
them, to involve both facilities and instruc-
tional staff, and to establish their criteria for
energy-efficient retrofits.
7. Establish a strong link between energy and
the environment. Protection of the environ-
ment is a strong motivator. The project helps
students and adults understand that more than
80 percent of pollution results from the 
production, consumption, and disposal of
energy and that actions they take really do
make a difference.
8. Establish a baseline of energy use, which
makes it possible to measure the project’s
success and to identify problem areas. Local
utilities may be willing to assist you in this
effort.
9. Determine the need for retrofits. Consider
what new equipment and/or energy-efficient
technology your school may need. Before 
recommending the purchase of new equip-
ment, be sure to identify the criteria that deci-
sion makers need in order to invest in new
equipment, such as payback period and legally
mandated requirements. A good resource
here is the U.S. Department of Energy’s Rebuild
America Program (www.eere.energy.
gov/buildings/program_areas/re
build.html), which offers technical
resources to school districts.
10. Maintain high visibility for the program to
encourage participation. The program is 
most successful when the whole school and
others in the district are involved. An effective
strategy is to communicate plans and achieve-
ments with key stakeholders in the school
community.

www.ase.org/section/program/greenschl. Oakley and Contra Costa
County in California use the Environmental Action Program for Schools, www.
co.contra-costa.ca.us/depart/cd/recycle/eaps/index.htm; the
information available at this Web site is specific to the California schools, but
you can still use it as a general guide.
If you’re concerned that environmental issues aren’t talked about in 
classrooms, turn to the National Energy Education Development project
(www.need.org). It provides a wealth of teaching aids for a range of grade
levels about all kinds of energy subjects, from the types of fuel that can
power vehicles to how solar energy can be harnessed in homes.
Initiating green projects
Schools have a role to play in the wider community, leading by example when
it comes to being environmentally conscious and friendly. The ultimate goal
of greening schools is to get the children involved in projects that help build
a greener community. If the school uses renewable energy, recycles, and com-
posts food waste, it demonstrates green living in action to children, parents,
and other people in the community.
The best projects are ones that everyone in the school, from the youngest
and most academically minded to the oldest and most practically minded,
can get interested and involved in. A range of projects is ideal in order to
allow everyone the chance to play their part.
Green project ideas can come from the things you do at home or from looking
at what other schools are doing. Check out the “Getting advice on green
school buildings” sidebar for some examples, and browse the Internet for
more suggestions. Don’t forget to ask students for their ideas as well.
The kinds of projects being run around the country range from recycling and
composting plans to worm farming and vegetable production for the school
cafeteria. They also include mentoring schemes in which older students
teach younger ones about the environment. The following sections focus on
ways to make any school greener.
Digging the students’ vegetable plot
Suggest to the principal or teachers that spare land on school grounds be
devoted to a vegetable plot. Students can grow organic vegetables (organic
gardening is covered in Chapter 8) to use in the school cafeteria or to donate
to local nonprofit organizations. In the process of planting, monitoring, and
caring for an organic garden, students learn about organic production, local
and seasonal food, and the link between the land and what ends up on 
their plates.
187
Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

The school saves money if the food is used in the school cafeteria, and if the
food is donated to local organizations, a relationship is established between
the school and community leadership. Children and teachers benefit from
getting exercise outdoors, and everyone is more likely to eat their veggies
because they’re proud of having grown some themselves.
The Alvin S. Hatch Elementary School in Half Moon Bay, California, has cre-
ated a Healthy Eating Active Living, or HEAL, program: Students work in the
school garden, enjoying hands-on science, math, and social studies activities
188
Part II: Living Greenly at Home 
Getting advice on green school buildings
School should be a healthy place for your children
to be. Improving indoor air quality in schools can
reduce sick days for both teachers and students and
improve the energy efficiency of school systems.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA,
offers an Indoor Air Quality “Tools for Schools” 
program that provides schools with a practical plan
to improve the air inside their buildings. The sugges-
tions require little or no cost, focusing instead on
common-sense activities that in-house staff can
carry out. Check out the program at www.epa.
gov/iaq/schools.
Much of the information in Chapters 4 and 5 about
how to build or renovate homes and how to live
within them in a green way can be applied to
schools, too. If your children’s school is building or
renovating its facilities, the U.S. Green Building
Council has a LEED (Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design) program just for schools.
Along with energy efficiency and green building fea-
tures, it also takes into account issues such as class-
room acoustics, mold prevention, and environmental
site assessment. You can find more information at
www.usgbc.org. On the home page, click LEED,
then LEED Rating Systems, and then Schools.
Schools around the U.S. are implementing these
green changes and others in a variety of ways. Here
are some examples:
 Sidwell Friends Middle School in Washington,
D.C., is the U.S. Green Building Council’s first
LEED platinum-rated secondary school. It was
built to be as sustainable as possible, using
reclaimed wood, low-VOC materials, and
renewable materials such as cork, gypsum,
linoleum, bamboo, and wheatboard. The school
also features photovoltaic roof panels, wetlands
that recycle wastewater back to the school, 
a green roof, and maximum use of natural 
daylight.
 Students at Sonoji Sakai Intermediate School on
Bainbridge Island, Washington, learn about
their environment, which includes a stream
used by spawning salmon, through lessons on
water quality monitoring, stream health, sus-
tainable site development, integrated pest 
management, and green building techniques.
The school building design includes careful pro-
tection of the stream and surrounding wetlands.
 Outdoor sustainable practices at Desert Edge
High School in Goodyear, Arizona, include drip
irrigation and xeriscaping (low water-use 
gardening with plants suited to local growing
conditions — see Chapter 7 for more informa-
tion on xeriscaping). Indoors, the school uses
motion and daylight sensors to reduce the time
that lights are on, an Energy Star-certified roof,
and an energy-efficient building envelope. The
result is a school that’s 28 percent more efficient
than conventional schools.

that are linked to state academic standards. The project aims to improve the
nutrition and health of children in the community, including providing
increased fitness activities.
If funding is an issue, consider seeking sponsorship opportunities from the
local community. Garden centers may be interested in providing tools, seeds,
and expert advice, for example, or community organizations may be happy to
provide funds for the purchase of fencing to go around the garden to protect
it from rabbits and other wildlife eager to sample the produce.
You can find a lesson plan that teachers can use to help students plan and
plant their vegetable garden at www.wccusd.k12.ca.us/stc/2000les/
garden.htm.
Visiting the local landfill site and recycling facility
It may seem like a strange way to spend a day out, but taking children to a
landfill site, which is basically a big hole in the ground, to see the reality of
waste management can have a big impact on their habits. If children see how
much waste is produced in their own small area and get a concept of how
waste piles up in all the similar sites around the country, they’re more likely
to see why the U.S. can’t go on managing its waste in that way.
While on a landfill field trip, do the following activities to get children
involved and thinking about waste management:
 Ask them to identify things that could have been reused, repaired, 
or recycled.
 Explain how long it takes various items they see to decompose.
 Explain how toxic chemicals have to be prevented from getting into the
ground and local water supplies during the decomposition process.
 Discuss the various other options for getting rid of and reducing the
waste to a minimum in the first place.
From the landfill site, go to a local recycling facility if there’s one in your area
that’s open to visitors, and show the children what happens to the items that
are sorted and processed there. Being on-site gives children a much clearer
picture, which they can then take home and discuss with parents and friends.
If local landfills don’t allow visitors, or if your school’s staff feel there are too
many health and safety concerns, explore other field trip options, including
 Alternative technology centers if they’re nearby, including power 
facilities generated by solar, hydro, geothermal, or wind energy
 Community composting schemes
 Community gardens
 Urban farms

Chapter 9: Raising Green Kids

Other green projects in your area also may be willing to help you educate 
students at your children’s school. Inquire at your local municipality, and use
your favorite Internet search engine to find other opportunities in your area.
Planting trees
You can plant trees anywhere as long as the owner of the land doesn’t object.
If the school has no land of its own on which to grow these oxygen-producers
and carbon dioxide-consumers, find somewhere else, such as a local park or
playground, to plant a few trees for the children to monitor regularly as they
grow. Planting trees is an important element of being carbon neutral, as we
explain in Chapter 1.
Portable, slow-release irrigation bags for trees, such as the Treegator
(www.treegatordirect.com) shown in Figure 9-1, are useful in school
applications where people may not be able to water young, tender trees as
often as the trees need it. You simply fill the automatic watering system and
then hide it under mulch or whatever material surrounds the tree base to
help protect against theft.
People who fly are asked to plant trees or pay for trees to be planted so that
they can absorb the carbon pumped into the atmosphere as a result of that
aircraft’s engine emissions. The same goes for other kinds of travel and for
energy use around both home and school. You can attempt to make your
whole lifestyle as close to carbon neutral as possible by planting trees or
making financial contributions to other carbon offsetting schemes as
explained in Chapter 1.

Part II: Living Greenly at Home 

Explain the carbon offsetting principle to the children at school, and help
them create a plan for getting involved in a program to offset the carbon
emissions from some project or element of school life, for example, the
carbon emissions from buses that took the kids on a recent field trip. If you
link a particular event to the planting of the trees, the whole concept of
carbon offsetting will be much easier for children to grasp.
Plant fast-growing trees to give the children the joy and benefit of seeing
them grow. Talk to your local garden center about the best species to plant
given your growing conditions.
Launching a green competition
Friendly competitions give children incentives to work, and green projects 
are an ideal opportunity to provide a little extra incentive for extra effort.
Prizes can come from you if you can afford them, or you may ask local green
companies to donate either goods or funds for the prizes. In fact, it’s best if
the prizes contribute to green living, too.
Be very clear about what the prizes will be awarded for so that students 
who enter the competition know what’s expected. The competition may be to
find the students who come up with the best green project of the year or who
write the best essays on a specific green issue, for example. You also could
base a competition on fundraising for a charity or nonprofit organization; part
of the educational bonus would be that the children choose the charity they
want to help (each classroom could choose a different one, or the school as 
a whole could choose one or several that they want to help). Every aspect of
the competition — including letting the kids and their parents know about 
it — should help to raise awareness about green living and green schools.

Participating in green initiatives 
at the college level
Many universities and colleges now operate some
kind of green project, either as research or as a
community program involving local people and stu-
dents. In addition, the Alliance to Save Energy
offers a Green Campus Program that helps design
and implement student-led campaigns to save
energy. The program also helps to build effective
partnerships between student and staff for the
sake of energy efficiency. You and your college 
student can find more information about this pro-
gram at www.ase.org/section/program/

C
hoosing what to eat is one of the most important and sometimes the
most difficult green decisions you have to make because it’s not just
about the environment; it’s also about your health. Luckily, the right thing for
the planet may also be the right thing for your body.
Eating green means knowing where your food comes from, and that involves
two issues: how the food was produced, and how it got to you (including what
happened to it along the way). To be sure that your food is as green as possi-
ble, you need the answers to these questions. Some scientists advise that if
you were to buy locally produced foodstuff — especially from within 12 miles
of your home — you would do more for the environment than if you simply
bought organic foods from farther afield. Most significantly, you’d save all the
greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of the foods from those 
distant places. So, if you follow the philosophy of shopping locally and eating
organically if possible, you’re well on the way to adopting a sustainable diet.
The decision is far from simple, but both choices make your lifestyle greener
than if you were buying nonorganic products not produced locally.
The packaging your food comes in is also a green issue. Even if the food is
organically produced, if it travels any distance to get to you, it usually needs
packaging to protect it. Whether that packaging is recyclable or not, it would
be greener if the packaging weren’t needed at all (which it often isn’t for
locally produced food) because it takes energy to produce the packaging and
then to either recycle or dispose of it. This chapter is all about the food itself,
but we discuss packaging in Chapter 6.

Many factors are important when it comes to making decisions about what
you buy and eat. Of course, it’s not always possible to eat local produce,
especially in cold climates. Cost also may be an issue: Local and/or organic
food can be more expensive than the alternatives that you find at grocery
stores. It’s possible, however, to make practical, reasonably priced decisions
that improve your green eating habits.
The Most Popular Question: Is
Vegetarianism Essential for 
Green Living?
People become vegetarians, meaning that they don’t eat meat, and even
vegans, meaning that they eschew meat, dairy, and other animal byproducts,
for health reasons, philosophical reasons, or both. When you ask people why
they choose to be vegetarians, you often find that they’re protesting against
the meat industry’s production methods. Others give up meat in favor of veg-
etarianism because they’re alarmed by the health issues that we explain the
“Explaining Organic” section, later in this chapter. Still others are concerned
about the resources that go into the production of meat. Grain-feeding ani-
mals in a factory farm uses up a lot of resources — lots of power is used for
lighting and machinery, and it takes a lot of water to flush away effluent. Even
though many farmers keep their cattle and sheep out in the fields, their diets
often are supplemented with grain at times when there’s not enough grass.
Researchers now use the word foodprint to indicate the amount of land 
that various diets require to sustain them; the idea is linked closely with the
idea of a person’s ecological footprint (see Chapter 1 for information about
calculating yours). The diet footprint is a handy way to visualize the environ-
mental impact that your diet has; the bottom line is that a more sustainable
diet requires less land per person. The popular notion is that a meat-free diet
uses the least land per person and is thus the greenest, most sustainable way
of eating. This is in part because animals consume feed grown on land that
could otherwise be used to grow vegetable or fruit crops for humans.
However, researchers at Cornell University recently added a new twist to 
this argument when they explained that, depending on the specific type of
land that surrounds you, a diet that contains a small amount of meat and
dairy actually can be more efficient than a straight vegetarian diet. That’s
because vegetarian crops require higher quality land than the pasture land
that animals need. So if your geographic area and climate offer more pasture
land than crop land, it can be more efficient to eat a small amount of meat.
(The Cornell researchers suggested an annual meat and egg intake that 
averaged out to approximately 2 cooked ounces per day.)
196
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

This argument over the greenest use of land for food, which is particularly
applicable given the current emphasis on eating local food in order to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrates why green issues are rarely black
and white and why one solution doesn’t necessarily fit all situations. So if 
you lust for a lamb shank and pine for a pork chop, you can still pursue a
green eating strategy. Meat can be, and is, produced in the same organic and
sustainable way that many fruits and vegetables are farmed. You can cut
down your impact on the planet’s resources by reducing the amount of meat
you eat and choosing green meat whenever possible.
Choosing Your Food Source Wisely
Despite all the arguments about what food is best in terms of health, there’s
agreement from an environmental point of view that it’s best to buy local
food. At the heart of all the arguments for eating locally grown produce is the
need to cut down on what have become known as food miles, the distance
food travels from where it’s produced to your plate. Transportation (by
plane, truck, ship, or train) over what can be thousands of miles results in 
a lot of carbon emissions. It’s estimated that the food eaten by Americans
travels an average of 1,500 miles before it gets to the plate. In addition, food
that travels a long distance and spends time in storage has fewer nutrients
than locally produced food because the sooner you eat something after it’s
harvested, the more nutrients you get.
However, sometimes buying locally isn’t an option, particularly when you’re
talking about foods that aren’t grown in the U.S. Enter Fairtrade, a trade 
program that works to make sure that
 Producers in the developing world get fair prices for what they produce
 Producers have reasonable working conditions
 The processes used in the developing world are sustainable
Buying Fairtrade items raises the issue of how far the food has traveled to 
get to you. Is it “greener” to buy the Fairtrade item that may have been trans-
ported from the other side of the world but that supports the developing
world, or the local item that isn’t benefiting the developing world’s economy
but that contributed far fewer greenhouse gases to the atmosphere? There’s
room for both in a green lifestyle: Buy local when you can, and buy Fairtrade
when you can’t buy local.
Your best bet: Buying locally
Food that flies thousands of miles to the U.S. from other countries is just part
of the food miles problem. Even American produce can travel many hundreds
197
Chapter 10: Making Great Green Diet Decisions

of miles before it gets to your plate. Retailers buy from producers and often
transport the food over the road to big packaging plants, to huge storage
facilities, to distribution centers, and finally to the stores from which you
drive it home. To cut down on those miles, you have to buy locally rather
than just buy items made in the U.S. The conundrum? The choice of food
retailers is almost as great as the choice of food products.
If you have the time, energy, space, and desire, the greenest option is to grow
some of your food yourself using organic methods. It’s not only the most
local food you can possibly get, but it also contributes to sustainability. You
can find more information about what to grow and how to grow it in Chapter
8. Because it’s unlikely that you have the time and resources to grow all your
food, we discuss your options for retailers in this section.
From locally owned and operated grocery stores
Because of concerns for animal welfare, and because eating food produced
using pesticides and other chemicals may cause health problems, the demand
for organic food has increased to such an extent that big businesses are inter-
ested in its money-making potential. Most people have limited time to shop,
so large grocery stores are the convenient option. They allow you to get
everything under one roof and do a big shop every once in a while, reducing
the miles you travel to get groceries.
Keep in mind, though, that many large grocery stores tend to treat food grown
throughout the U.S. as if it’s locally produced. Even if a cow starts its life in a
farm just one mile away from you, the meat will travel to storage and distribu-
tion centers miles from home and will have traveled a large distance before it
gets back to your grocery store. Big businesses have greater buying power
than small competitors, but they also transport food farther to storage and
distribution facilities, increasing factory and transport emissions and reducing
the nutritional value of the stored food. Also take into account the impact that
big business has on local business, particularly small, locally owned specialty
grocery stores and farmers’ markets.
It may sound like we’re advising against large grocery stores, but what we’re
really doing is suggesting that you take a careful look at where you shop. If
your local (and large) grocery store brings in as much local and organic pro-
duce as possible, then by all means, support it. But if it doesn’t do that, look
for other options. The larger stores’ buying power may translate into lower
food costs on the shelves, but do what you can — within your budget — to
purchase more locally and/or organically produced food.
If you’re unable to buy food from a farmers’ market or directly from a local
farmer (see the next two sections), head for smaller specialty stores and 
co-ops, many of which sell organic and/or local products.
198
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

Co-ops are exactly what they sound like: cooperative organizations in which
people come together as members to take advantage of the buying power
that results from being more than just one individual or one family. Members
usually pool money in some way and thus become member-owners of the
organization, with a say in how it runs and a share in dividends if there’s
money left over at the end of the year. Co-ops can be informal, such as when
several families pool funds in order to buy from a co-op food warehouse, or
they can be more formal with hundreds or even thousands of members.
When it comes to food, many have a mandate to support local, organic, or
natural food producers. You can find co-ops throughout the country through
www.coopdirectory.org and by entering “food co-op” in your favorite
Internet search engine.
Some local shops or co-ops may sell only organically produced and labeled
food; others combine organic food with health food, vitamin and mineral 
supplies, and other well-being and fitness-related products. These kinds of
stores are popping up everywhere in cities and towns and are increasingly
moving into many large shopping centers thanks to the demand for organic
food products.
Wherever you shop, check with the store to see how local “local” is. While it’s
difficult to set a firm distance that experts consider local — some say 12 miles;
some say 100; some say within your own watershed or climatic region — it’s
really up to you to decide what’s practical given your geographic location. (If a
label says “locally grown,” it generally indicates something within 250 miles.) If
you live in the northern part of the country, of course, it’s very difficult to buy
local agricultural products during the winter; in that case, “local” may mean
produce grown within the U.S. in winter but produce grown much closer to
home in summer.
At local farmers’ markets
Farmers’ markets have increased in popularity in the last few years, with
almost 4,400 operating in the U.S. That’s great news for people who love to eat
locally grown food and support local food growers and producers. Farmers’
markets may be open one or two days a week during the growing season, or
they may operate year-round. They cater to people who are interested in
buying fresh, local, and sometimes organic produce. Some have even become
destinations for visitors who are interested in learning about what’s grown in
the region.
At most farmers’ markets, you’re able to sample and buy local fruit and 
vegetables that are in season and talk to the growers about their produce —
they’re usually passionate about the subject — so that you know exactly 
what you’re buying and eating. At many markets, you also find other locally
produced food such as meats, cheeses, and jams and other preserves. You
can find details of local farmers’ markets at www.ams.usda.gov/farmers
markets/map.htm. If you don’t find a market in your town or city listed 
199
Chapter 10: Making Great Green Diet Decisions

on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Web site, inquire with www.
localharvest.org or enter “farmers’ market” and your geographical area
into an Internet search engine.
Not all the produce at a farmers’ market is certified organic. Some growers
use conventional growing methods, some may go through the certification
process to convert to organic (see the later section “Explaining Organic”),
and others simply may be keen vegetable gardeners with green fingers.
Straight from a local farm
If you don’t have a local farmers’ market, you may be able to hook up with 
a farm not too far away from you that sells its produce straight from the 
farm or has its own farm store. Even if you live right in the middle of a city,
you may find that farmers set up shop temporarily and sell produce straight
off their own trucks. (Some farmers even deliver to established regular 
customers.)
Local Harvest (www.localharvest.org) has lists of family farms and other
sources of sustainably grown food; to find farms near you that sell to the
public, you also can enter “farm shop” or “farm store” and your geographic
area into an Internet search engine. In addition, many state government 
agricultural departments maintain lists of such farms.
The produce from a farm store may be somewhat more expensive because
the farm doesn’t sell the volume of produce that allows it to cut prices. If you
have to drive there and back, you also have to think about the fuel you’re
using and the impact of your transportation on the environment. However, if
you can combine a trip to the farm or farm store with other errands, you
reduce your environmental impact.
Getting to know local farmers and shopping directly from farms has the
added advantage of providing a fun day out for the whole family. Farms near
your home may have pick-your-own operations that offer a variety of fruit
and vegetables — often strawberries and raspberries, but the selection
depends on the area, the climate, and the farmer.
If you pick your own fruit and vegetables, you know whether or not they’re
organically grown and local, you don’t contribute to any damage to the 
environment from harvesting machinery, you don’t have a lot of waste from
packaging, and you get the maximum possible nutrients from the produce
because you can consume it right away (or at least very soon after picking).
You also keep your children amused for a day and give them insight into
where their food comes from and how it’s produced. Just don’t let them eat
too many berries!

From food-delivery services
Many cities are serviced by companies that deliver fresh fruit and vegetables
from local growers, with some specializing in organic produce. Depending on
the company, you may be able to sign up for weekly or occasional (on-
demand) delivery and order exactly what you want so that you’ll know what
will arrive on your doorstep.
In the Seattle area, SPUD, or Small Potatoes Urban Delivery (www.spud.com),
offers a range of groceries delivered to your door with a promise that a fair
price has been paid to growers and food producers. Door to Door Organics
(www.doortodoororganics.com) offers organic food home deliveries in
various communities in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and West Virginia/Washington D.C.
To find a food delivery service in your area, run an Internet search for “food
delivery service (your town or city).” You may want to add “organic” to the
search terms.
The alternative option: Finding 
Fairtrade food
The idea of Fairtrade is that more of the money you pay when you buy an
item goes to the producers who then can pay their workers better and invest
more in their businesses. It’s a trading partnership that aims at sustainable
development for excluded and disadvantaged producers.
201
Chapter 10: Making Great Green Diet Decisions
Reducing water miles, too
Americans are drinking an ever-increasing
amount of bottled water — some 27 gallons per
person last year, in fact. The environmental
resources involved in bottled water are stagger-
ing: Energy is required to produce the plastic 
bottles, tap the water source, fill the bottles, 
possibly add carbonation or flavoring, transport
the bottles to the consumer, and finally dispose of
or recycle the plastic bottles.
It’s becoming clear that the water inside the bot-
tles isn’t necessarily healthier than the water
coming out of your tap. You can reduce your water
miles significantly by minimizing your purchase of
bottled water and instead choosing a refillable
and washable container that you can fill from the
tap. If you’re concerned about the taste or quality
of tap water, consider installing a tap-mounted
water filter or using a water filtration pitcher.

In the U.S., you can find a range of goods with the Fairtrade logo on them,
many of which are available at stores near you or via online shopping. There
are approximately 300 on the list, including tea, coffee, chocolate, bananas,
herbs and spices, flowers, cotton, and footballs, and the list is growing as the
program extends its reach. You can even find coffee shops that distinguish
themselves by selling only Fairtrade-certified coffee.
The Fairtrade label ensures that the products it appears on meet the
Fairtrade standards. The goods usually cost a little more than equivalent 
non-Fairtrade goods, but the benefit is knowing that the producers have been
treated fairly. The program aims to make sure that
 Producers are paid a fair price that covers their production and living
costs so that they have some security, they have long-term contracts
and therefore can plan ahead, and their businesses are sustainable.
 The extra money you pay goes toward other aspects of the producers’
welfare, such as education.
 Producers and workers are allowed to join unions and other organiza-
tions that can protect their rights and ensure that they have fair working
conditions.
 No child labor is used.
 Production methods are environmentally friendly and pesticide-free.

Examining the world food supply
The issue of what’s happening with food around the
world is part of the larger discussion of eating
green. While famines often make news headlines,
children in many developing nations face a more
constant (and usually unreported) threat: under-
nourishment and malnutrition. But does this mean
that the world isn’t producing enough food to feed
everyone? Not necessarily.
The Population Reference Bureau (www.prb.
org) reported in 2007 that malnutrition plays a role
in the deaths of approximately 6 million young 
children a year, primarily in the developing world.
That’s 16,000 children a day.
The issue with food isn’t that we can’t currently pro-
duce enough to feed the world: According to the
United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP),
there’s plenty of food to go around. The problem is
that the food isn’t always grown where it’s needed.
Natural disasters, war, lack of infrastructure such
as irrigation, overfarming practices that rob the
land of its fertility, and poverty all can reduce how
much food is available in specific areas. The result
is an overabundance of food in some areas and a
shortage in others.
Improving the green quotient of your food —
buying local and organic — can help protect the
environment and support producers near to you. To
address issues on a global scale, you can support
or get involved with nonprofit organizations that
work in developing areas to improve the situation,
such as the WFP (www.wfp.org).

Find more information about Fairtrade on the Web site for Fairtrade Labelling
Organizations International, an umbrella group that deals with a number of
different certification programs around the world: www.fairtrade.net.
When deciding whether or not to buy certain foods, consider the employment
practices of the country of origin. If you want to live a truly green and ethical
lifestyle, you’ll avoid food from countries that exploit workers or have poor
records on human rights. Do some research to determine what you want to
buy and from where. Not everyone makes the same decisions, however, and
you have to keep in mind that not buying produce from a particular country
can affect the farmers, workers, and producers rather than the country’s 
government.
Explaining Organic
Although it’s easy to focus on taste and convenience when you’re thinking
about getting supper on the table each night, a lot more goes into your food
than meets the eye. If you ask many schoolchildren where bacon comes from,
they’re likely tell you “the grocery store.” The process of breeding, rearing,
feeding, and eventually killing pigs and other animals for food is something
many of them know nothing about. And why should they? They live in towns
and cities where they may never encounter anything related to farming. But if
you want to know what you’re eating, you need to know what kind of farming
methods are used to get the meat you eat from the farmyard to your plate.
Even a simple grilled cheese sandwich likely contains a lot more than wheat
flour and milk. When eating green, you need to consider chemicals and addi-
tives along with factors such as how the chickens were raised and what went
into the field of grain aside from the grain itself.
You may think it should be quite easy to explain exactly what is and isn’t
organic food. But it’s not that straightforward. Hundreds of organizations
around the world give certificates to say that products are organic, and each
has slightly different criteria by which it makes its judgments.
In the U.S., farmers have to meet the USDA definition of organic through the
National Organic Program. Basically, the program says that in growing crops
and raising animals the organic way, natural substances are allowed and 
synthetic substances aren’t. (There are a few exceptions, but they’re clearly
laid out within the program’s regulations; for more information, check out
www.ams.usda.gov.) More specifically, it means that
 Crops are grown without the use of most chemically based pesticides 
or petroleum- or sewage-based fertilizers.
 Animals are raised without antibiotics or growth hormones.
 Genetic engineering and ionizing radiation aren’t allowed at any stage 
of the food creation process.
203
Chapter 10: Making Great Green Diet Decisions

The fast pace of modern life leads to less cooking at home and more reliance
on convenience foods that can be unwrapped and put straight into the oven
or microwave. If you buy ready-made meals, you’re less likely to know what’s
in them and where the ingredients came from than if you prepare a meal from
scratch with fresh, raw ingredients.
It’s interesting to compare the types of ingredients in an organically produced
food compared to a nonorganic equivalent product. Peanut butter, for exam-
ple, is a popular food and can be one of the most simply produced foods on
the market.
 Ingredients in organically produced peanut butter: 100 percent 
organically grown peanuts, with salt added in some brands
 Ingredients in nonorganically produced peanut butter: 90 percent 
minimum imported and local peanuts, with many brands adding corn
syrup, salt, sugar, and partially hydrogenated oils (which contain trans
fats linked to heart health problems)
Although organic food is produced by greener methods and shouldn’t 
contain pesticides and other substances that could potentially be bad for
your health, it’s important to note that scientists aren’t in agreement about
whether or not organic food is safer and more nutritious than its nonor-
ganic equivalents. In fact, the USDA is careful to point out that the National
Organic Program lets consumers know what is and isn’t organic; it doesn’t
make any claims that organic produce is better or safer for you than nonor-
ganic produce. What isn’t disputed, however, is that conventional — and
especially intensive — farming methods can be much more damaging to the
environment than organic methods.
It’s worth noting here that the words “organic” and “natural” are not inter-
changeable. Organic products have been created (or grown) using natural
methods and ingredients and have not come into contact with chemicals. A
product that says it’s natural, however, means simply that it doesn’t contain
artificial ingredients — it doesn’t mean that the production process has been
organic. Green eating certainly means trying to avoid chemical additives that
are often found in processed food, so natural products are “greener” than
those that contain artificial ingredients — just keep in mind that they’re not
necessarily organic.
Green eating means that you may need to pay a little more to get better-
quality foods and good levels of animal welfare. Organic food is generally 
still more expensive than conventional items, but prices are coming down 
as more organic producers break into the marketplace. The entrance of big
grocery store chains into the organic food market as a result of increasing
demand for organic food is driving the demand for more organic food sup-
plies, and the stores can keep prices down because they have huge buying
204
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

power. Some organic foods aren’t grown on a large scale, but if you think
about the whole cost — such as the expense of cleaning up rivers because of
agricultural pesticides leaking into them — and the welfare of the animals
involved, you may decide that it’s worth paying a little extra.
Avoiding chemicals and 
unnecessary medicines
Organic farming is much friendlier for the earth and the local economy 
than mass production of products. Instead of using chemical-based fertilizers
to create a high-yield soil, organic farming uses traditional methods of 
plowing the soil to break down soil compaction that can reduce water and 
air getting to the plants’ roots, rotating the crops to prevent crop-specific 
diseases or pests from building up in the soil, and growing cover crops such
as peas or clover that naturally add fertility to the soil in rotation with 
conventional crops.
Organic farming also emphasizes the use of physical, mechanical, or 
biological controls to handle weeds, insects, and plant diseases. You can 
pull weeds by hand or machine, for example, or introduce a beneficial insect
to eat a harmful one (for example, ladybugs to eat aphids). The lack of chemi-
cals also eliminates the risk that dangerous substances will run into nearby
rivers, streams, and the water table below, affecting water quality. In turn,
you’re less likely to be eating any chemicals used to keep bugs at bay and the
soil fertile.
When it comes to livestock, organic animals are fed only organic feed along
with vitamins and minerals. Depending on the animal, there are specific rules
about when and for how long the feed needs to 100 percent organic.
Look for meats labeled pasture-raised or grass-fed, indicating that the animals
were raised outdoors on pasture and that their diet consisted of grasses and
hay. This diet is much more natural and environmentally supportive than
grain-feeding. Some animals (especially chickens and pigs) are fed some
grains to ensure that they get the nutrients they need, but the grains can be
organically grown.
Growth hormones and antibiotics also are specifically banned in organic food
products, although vaccines are allowed. Of course farmers are allowed — in
fact, they’re required — to give medication, including antibiotics, to animals
that are sick to prevent suffering. However, food products that come from 
the animal involved may not be called “organic” if the animal has received a
medication that’s on the organic-prohibited list.

Chapter 10: Making Great Green Diet Decisions

Letting nature govern production: 
Say no to genetic modification!
Genetically modified organisms — also known as genetically engineered 
organisms — are living things whose genetic makeup (their DNA structure)
has been changed by the addition of genes from another living thing. This
tampering is done primarily to make plants and animals more beneficial to
food production, both in terms of quantity and quality. Human intervention 
in this way, however, carries with it some major concerns that, for the green
community, outweigh the pros.
Although cloning doesn’t fit the definition of genetic modification (the DNA
hasn’t been added to but rather replicated), the use of cloned animals or
their offspring — especially for animal products such as milk (the cloned 
animals themselves are currently too valuable to be used for meat) — in the
food supply is something that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
assessing as this book goes to print. Although the FDA has stated that there’s
no scientific evidence to show that the meat or milk products, for example,
are unsafe, groups opposing the approval point to research that indicates
cloned animals may have some genetic abnormalities. It’s not yet clear what
effect, if any, those abnormalities may have if they enter the food chain.
The potential effects of genetic modification
Depending on the type of genetic modification (GM), foods may taste better,
last longer before spoiling, or contain certain types of nutrients or medicines.
The primary benefit, though, is generally to food producers in terms of higher
production capacities, increased disease or pest resistance, or increased 
herbicide resistance (which actually allows farmers to use more weed-killing
herbicides). Crops, for example, can be genetically modified so that they resist
insects, herbicides, and disease or so that they contain extra nutrients or even
vaccines. Animals can be genetically modified to produce lower-fat meat,
resist certain diseases, or create less waste.
One of the most common genetic changes to food products involves a gene
that comes from a bacterium known as Bt. When this gene is added to plants
such as corn or cotton, those plants begin to produce a protein that’s toxic to
insects that can otherwise prey on the crops.
Proponents of GM crops claim that nutritionally enhanced grain or rice crops
could be used in developing countries to solve some of the issues of under-
nourishment or malnutrition. GM crops also can be used to provide vaccines
against diseases, which also would most benefit the developing world. Some
scientists believe that, by boosting production efficiency, resource conserva-
tion, and nutrition, GM crops and animals could offer solutions to both world
hunger and environmental degradation.
206
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

With all these potential benefits, you’re probably wondering where the con-
cern comes in. Scientists’ biggest reservations lay in the unknown; genetic
engineering is a relatively new concept (modern genetic engineering began
with scientific discoveries in the 1950s through 1970s), so long-term conse-
quences have yet to be determined. And given the amount of time generally
needed to link cause and effect in the scientific world, you can safely assume
that these consequences won’t be identified in your lifetime — and perhaps
not even that of your children or grandchildren.
Some short-term effects have been observed, however, including the potential
for GM crops to “contaminate” non-GM crops when their seeds migrate over
distances. Contamination means that GM seeds could begin growing in non-
GM areas, meaning that the non-GM crops would no longer be considered free
of GM material. The contaminated crops could no longer be considered non-
GM, which is a huge issue especially for organic growers who — through no
fault of their own — would suddenly be prevented from calling their crops
organic. Other concerns include the potential for organisms, such as insects
and viruses, to evolve and become more powerful and overcome the resistant
GM animals and plants. Some scientists also are concerned that GM ingredi-
ents may cause toxic poisoning, allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance, and
even cancer in humans. Research hasn’t proven all the concerns, but there’s
enough evidence to warrant caution.
Health concerns aren’t the only ones that have scientists troubled; the idea 
of manipulating living organisms at the DNA structural level raises serious 
ethical questions. This interference goes well beyond the ways in which
humans have traditionally interfered (by cross-breeding, for example).
Experience should have taught us that interfering with nature can create
unforeseen results (such as when high-end predators like wolves were culled
from the food chain, causing an overpopulation of deer that were then prone
to starvation because there weren’t enough food sources to sustain them).
Genetic engineering goes well beyond that, however, by changing the funda-
mental building blocks of life: Researchers don’t know how changing the
genes of crops will affect wildlife that coexists with the crops, or how chang-
ing the genes of animals may affect them (possibly causing diseases or 
deformities and therefore suffering). If farmers introduce GM crops that have
been designed to resist herbicides, for example, how will they be able to
remove those crops if they later realize that the GM crops have unexpected
and undesirable effects? Until we can answer these ethical questions, we 
need to err very much on the side of caution.
Recognizing when food has been genetically modified
Because of concerns about foods that contain genetically modified ingredi-
ents, GM food has become a major consumer concern in Europe, to the point
where any foods that contain GM products as ingredients must be labeled as
such. For the most part, consumers there avoid GM-labeled foods, so produc-
ers simply aren’t growing crops or raising animals that have been genetically
modified.
207
Chapter 10: Making Great Green Diet Decisions

In the U.S., however, the issue hasn’t captured consumers in the same way.
GM crops are common in the U.S., and no labeling is required; in fact, it’s
believed that upwards of 70 percent of foods in U.S. supermarkets contain
some element of genetic engineering. It’s highly likely that you’re eating GM
ingredients in your food without even realizing it.
The best way to find out whether your food choices contain genetically 
engineered ingredients is to choose local options so that you can talk to the
producers and find out from them exactly what went into the food. If you
can’t do that, then try talking to the managers or owners of local grocery
stores — they may not be able to tell you about production methods, but the
fact that you asked them may help to convince them that they should pay
more attention to this issue.
If you can’t buy the groceries you need from your community, try contacting
food manufacturers directly. Their Web sites often contain information 
about production methods and a consumer telephone or e-mail hotline for
questions. If companies aren’t able to categorically deny that they use GM
ingredients, chances are good that they use these products.
Some of the foods and ingredients currently subject to genetic modification
for reasons such as increasing yield or pest resistance include

The life and times of a factory-farm chicken
You only have to look at how chickens are treated
on a factory farm to understand how viruses such
as bird flu strains can evolve and spread quickly
and why eating meat can introduce chemicals into
your diet. That’s not to mention the welfare issues
related to treating animals with a significant 
lack of compassion. Here’s some insight into how
chickens live their lives on factory farms:
 Many hens born and raised on a factory farm
can live their whole lives crammed inside
cages next to other chickens, never seeing
anything outside the cage in which they’re
housed.
 Most hens raised on a factory farm have never
walked, never stretched their wings, never laid
a nest, and never foraged for food.
 Because of their desire to move around, the
hens can become aggressive and peck at the
other chickens around them, causing injury
and disease. To avoid that, many hens’ beaks
are cut off when they’re born.
 Chickens raised for meat (called broilers)
spend relatively short lives in sheds with 
hundreds or even thousands of other birds.
They’re fed with growth hormones so that they
grow quickly, which makes them predisposed
to disease and physical abnormalities. Many
of these birds die of heart attacks, dehydration,
or starvation because they can’t even stand or
walk to feeders.
You can find more information about factory farm-
ing from the U.S. Animal Welfare Institute (www.
awionline.org), which recently launched its
Animal Welfare Approved certification program for
family farms.

 Soybeans: Soy is one of the main sources of genetically modified ingredi-
ents in food and can be found in everything from chocolate to potato
chips, margarine to mayonnaise, and biscuits to bread.
 Canola: Canola oil comes from certain types of canola plants. GM canola
may be used for oils in making potato chips and animal feed.
 Corn: GM corn is used as cattle feed but also is used in all sorts of pack-
aged food, such as breakfast cereal, bread, corn chips, and gravy mixes.
 Wheat: GM wheat has been developed, but its implementation in North
America so far has been successfully opposed.
 Milk: Cows may be injected with a genetically engineered growth 
hormone to increase milk production.
For animals only: Freedom rules!
Organic livestock farming takes into account both the health of the animals
as well as their welfare. Factory farming concentrates many animals in a lim-
ited space, which can result in an overflow of animal waste on each farm and
the need to use extra water and chemicals to assist in removing the waste.
Additional chemical use can lead to chemicals leaching into the soil and the
water table, and it can mean that the animals are less healthy and may often
need to be treated with antibiotics and other medicines. Organically raised
animals, however, must be free-range, which means they have access to the
outdoors, including pasture. They aren’t confined within buildings but may
be kept in buildings temporarily for health or safety reasons.
The rules on what constitutes free range aren’t always what green experts
would wish; it covers a variety of conditions, from the birds being able to
wander in a natural environment to the birds having access to a small out-
door enclosure that may not be very natural. It’s a good idea to check with
the producer if you can in order to find out what free range means in the con-
text of a particular product.
Factory farming methods have evolved to meet the ever-growing demand 
for meat. The organic approach may be slower and less profitable — animals
have room to move and so fewer animals can be produced from the same
amount of land, for example — but it produces cleaner and healthier animals.
If you find it difficult to find organic meat, ask your local butcher to stock
some organic and sustainable options; increased demand increases supply.
The environment will be better off and your local butcher will have a guaran-
teed customer. You also can purchase food from animals that have been
raised in a sustainable way through the Eat Well Guide at www.eatwell
guide.org. The site has searchable listings of producers across the country.

Fishing for sustainable varieties
Buying fish brings with it a whole range of ethical
issues. The world’s fish stocks are dwindling, which
means that fishermen have to go farther afield into
deeper waters to bring home their catch. Fishing in
deeper waters means greater use of dragnets that
catch endangered species as well as fish for the
stores. Fish are taken from the sea younger, further
depleting stocks because there are fewer breed-
ing fish in the sea. Only 3 percent of the world’s fish
stocks are underexploited. At the same time,
demand for fish is growing, doubling in the last 30
years alone.
One answer to the decrease in fish stocks has
been to farm fish such as salmon. Intensive farming
methods have resulted in the same sorts of prob-
lems faced in livestock farming, however. The use
of chemicals, antibiotics, and disinfectants to 
protect the farmed fish from disease has led to wor-
ries about toxins and cancer-causing chemicals in
the fish you eat, and there are concerns about
escaping fish carrying contamination into wild fish
stocks. All this comes at a time when nutritionists
advise eating more cold-water fish species for the
benefits of the heart-protecting omega-3 oils that
they contain.
Various national and international quotas are in
place that set the amount of fish that can be taken
from the various fishing grounds by each country.
These restrictions have done a lot to conserve 
fish stocks, but some fishermen cross into non-
quota-controlled waters in order to meet demand,
and many conservationists are concerned that 
current quotas aren’t low enough.
When you go shopping for fish you need to think
about
 Whether the fish you’re buying is from 
sustainable stock:“Sustainable stock” means
that the fish are replacing themselves at the
same rate as they’re being fished. Cod, for
example, used to live up to 40 years and grow
up to 6 feet long, but now the stocks are so
depleted that most of the fish caught are less
than 2 years old and haven’t bred replacement
fish. People usually are advised not to buy cod
in order to allow stocks to build up again.
 What the fish’s body may contain: There’s a
major concern that many fish — including
swordfish and Chilean sea bass — contain
higher than healthy doses of substances such
as mercury.
 Whether the fish is farmed or wild: Buying
wild fish may contribute to overfishing, but the
fish may be a healthier option than farmed. If
you choose to buy farmed varieties, opt for
farms that use sustainable and even organic
practices. Wild Alaskan salmon usually are
considered healthy and sustainably caught.
 How the fish was caught:Catching fish by line
doesn’t cause further damage to the marine
environment, but net fishing can do a huge
amount of environmental damage. For exam-
ple, fishing for tuna with nets can and does kill
dolphins. Fishing for shrimp often results in
other unwanted species being caught and
thrown back into the sea dead.
Buy fish from a store where the staff know how and
where the fish were caught, where any farmed fish
come from, and how they were farmed. Check out
the fish facts from the Marine Conservation Society
Web site at www.fishonline.orgor from the
Marine Stewardship Council Web site at
www.msc.org. Also keep on top of changing
information about species that are threatened or
potentially contaminated: Check www.seafood
watch.orgfor the latest news.

Applying Green Ideals When Shopping
the Aisles: Reading Labels
Buying food can be confusing, particularly if you’re trying to make healthy
and sustainable choices. Reading the labels is important because in grocery
stores, they’re often the only source of information about the content of the
food you buy. Food labels aren’t perfect, but they do provide basic informa-
tion about where the food comes from, what it contains, and what nutritional
value it offers.
Finding food with good nutritional value
and ethical production
When buying a food product, find out if it has arrived on the shelf from a 
sustainable production process by checking out the following information 
on the label:
 Ingredients list: Understanding the ingredients and their nutrients gives
you an excellent feel for the quality of your food. Heavily processed 
food is likely to have added salt to assist in preservation and taste and
several chemicals for flavoring and coloring. Naturally prepared foods
are usually low in added salt, sugar, and saturated fats.
 Animals used: Some animals and fish are protected species due to 
their near extinction from being over-farmed or culled or from habitat
destruction. From a food point of view, you’re most likely to run into
threatened species of fish; you can find the latest news plus handy
pocket shopping guides from www.seafoodwatch.org. The site tells
you the best choices for seafood, good alternatives if you can’t find the
best choices, and species that you should avoid.
 Country of origin: Somewhere on the label should be a note that says
“Product of (a country).” Technically, this tells you the country the food
comes from, which is helpful if you’re not able to buy a product from
local sources. The note on the label can tell you, for example, whether
the product is from the U.S. or from Mexico; however, the reality is that
this information sometimes can be misleading. It may indicate, for exam-
ple, where the product was processed and packaged rather than where
the original produce actually came from or where it traveled to during
the processing. The nuances aren’t apparent from the packaging, so you
may have to check sources such as the manufacturer’s Web site to find
out where it processes its products.
211
Chapter 10: Making Great Green Diet Decisions

Looking for organic and more on labels
Organic food is much more plentiful than it used to be; demand for it contin-
ues to increase, so retailers are responding with a wider range of organic 
products at lower prices. Now most of the big food retailers sell organic fruit,
vegetables, and meat as well as processed foods like bread and breakfast
cereal and other foods. The USDA’s National Organic Program has strict rules
on what food manufacturers can and can’t say regarding organic foods on
food labels. Specifically, if a food label has the National Organic Program’s seal
on it (see Figure 10-1), the producer has been certified under the program.
The specifics of the wording, however, are where the differences lie.
Here are the USDA’s labeling terms, with explanations:
 100 Percent Organic: All ingredients in the product are organic.
 Organic: At least 95 percent of the product’s ingredients are organic.
 Made with Organic Ingredients: At least 75 percent of the product’s
ingredients are organic.
 Organic ingredients noted on the ingredients statement: Less than 70
percent of the product’s ingredients are organic, so the producer can
only identify the actual organic ingredients within the ingredients listing
on the product label.
Meat packaging has additional terminology that you should be aware of.
 Natural: Labels may refer to beef and lamb, in particular, as being 
produced naturally, but this only means that the meat may not have any
artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, or other artificial ingre-
dients. Natural production doesn’t necessarily mean that the animals led
the life of Riley outside, gamboling in the fields.
 Grass fed: It’s considered greener (and kinder) if cows are fed primarily
on grass or hay rather than on grain because they can digest grass and
hay more easily.

 Free-range: This means that chickens, for example, weren’t confined 
to cages. There are different degrees of free-range, however — from 
true free-range where the chickens are allowed to wander in a fairly large
space outside to more limited conditions where they may have only
short periods outside in an area that’s quite small. It may be difficult to
tell exactly what free-range means when you see it on meat packaging,
so if you’re looking at a specific product, consider contacting its 
producer directly for clarification.
The next time you’re in the produce aisle, check out the little label that’s
stuck on the fruit: You should see either a four- or a five-digit code on the
label. A four-digit code means that the produce was produced conventionally
(it’s not organic). A five-digit code that starts with “9” indicates that it’s
organically grown, and a five-digit code that starts with “8” indicates that it’s
genetically engineered.
You can get more information on the regulations of food labeling from the
FDA at www.cfsan.fda.gov.
Any food producer in the U.S. that wants to use the word “organic” in its
labeling has to follow the National Organic Program, and any producer that’s
selling more than $5,000 worth of organic food a year has to become certified
under the program. In order to become certified, the land has to have been
treated organically for at least three years, and an organic plan must be in
place to explain production practices and substances. (It takes time to 
convert to organic farming mainly because it takes time for all the existing
pesticides and fertilizers to disappear from the soil.) The producer then
applies for certification, which involves an initial inspection and then annual
inspections for as long as the producer wants to be part of the program. The
program’s inspectors can show up unannounced, and they can test the food
for residues if they think that it may have been in contact with nonorganic
substances.
Failsafe ways to buy locally 
when labels are unclear
If you find no labels on particular foods, or if you find labels with little 
information — which can be the case in smaller stores and in the fruit and
vegetable sections of bigger grocery stores — here are a few tips to help you
make the greenest food choices:
 Eat fruit and vegetables in season. They’re more likely to have been
grown locally. Fruits and vegetables on the shelf that you know aren’t in
season are likely to have been imported or brought by road from the
other end of the country.
213
Chapter 10: Making Great Green Diet Decisions

 Avoid exotic foods. Some foods and ingredients, such as coffee and tea,
likely can’t be grown locally; the U.S. simply doesn’t have the climate for
them. Find out what grows near where you live by checking out local
farmers’ markets or by visiting the Web site of your state’s department
of agriculture, and make the most of it. You’ll be supporting your local
growers.
 Look for local businesses. Check out the companies close to you that
produce, package, and transport things like bread, rice, milk, and so on.
Buying those brands means that you’re likely cutting down on the miles
your food travels.
Food retailers say that customers want exotic foods from around the world,
partly because people are traveling more widely and experiencing foods that
they want to continue to enjoy even after they arrive home. Eating green isn’t
about sacrificing taste or variety or depriving yourself of a taste that you
enjoy. If you’re making greener choices most of the time, there’s more than
enough room for an occasional treat from afar.
If you try to buy local produce in order to cut down on the environmental
impact of food traveling round the globe, you’re likely to end up eating what’s
in season. And that’s how people used to eat: lettuce in the summer and
apples in the fall, for example. Quite apart from the environmental and health
benefits of eating this way, there’s the added pleasure of rediscovering 
particular foods each year. When the season is over, you can look forward to
tasting something again next year instead of becoming used to it all year and
taking it for granted.
Buying local produce may not be practical in areas that are especially hot or
cold because there are times of the year when pretty much nothing grows. As
always, you need to make compromises based on not just the greenest option
but the greenest option that’s available to you.
It’s possible that local producers extend the growing seasons using different
kinds of technology: artificial heating and lighting, for example, or growing
under poly tunnels. While this isn’t as perfectly green as in-season, outdoor
growing, it can be done in a way that reduces the impact on the environment.
Talk to the producers to find out how they manage their growing seasons.
214
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 
Eating greenly when out and about
When you go out for a meal, you have to depend on
the chef when it comes to green principles. Many
chefs, however, make a point of buying only truly
local and/or organic produce. If you want to be sure
of what you’re getting, call the restaurant before you
make a reservation and ask about the ingredients
used. Good restaurants are more than happy to
answer your questions — and if more customers
demand greener restaurant meals, chefs and man-
agers will get the message.

 Keeping clothes in circulation
T
he only true ways to be greener when it comes to clothes is to buy fewer,
better-quality items; to wear them for longer; and to repair and recycle
them. Making a decision about what to buy is about weighing the pros and
cons and deciding what’s most important to you. By far, the best way to be
green is to buy less! It also helps to make sure that what you do buy comes
from naturally produced materials, such as organic cotton, that are grown
without the use of pesticides and other chemicals that often contaminate
water supplies in growing areas.
In this chapter, we give you a primer on the consequences of materialism in
the clothing realm followed by specific advice on how you can help reverse
that trend.
What It Means to Dress in Green
Every season the shops fill up with new clothes. Winter coats, short and
swinging last year, are dipping below the knee this year. Wedges and 
platform soles are so last year — this year’s shoes are flat and bright. As the
trends change, last season’s must-have items suddenly lose their appeal. 
The magazines are full of the latest, hottest, most up-to-date fashions, and
consumers feel the urge to keep up if they can.
This never-ending appetite for new clothes puts pressure on the textile 
industry to supply enough material to cater to the demand. The end result?
Prices have fallen dramatically over the past decade, and clothes are now
seen as disposable: Shoppers buy cheaper clothes more frequently and in

greater quantities and feel less allegiance to them when fashions change or
when the clothes begin to lose their shape or wear out. As you can probably
imagine, this pattern of purchasing and discarding has numerous conse-
quences for the world and its people.
When choosing clothes, consider these three major green issues:
 Impact on workers: It’s not exactly green or sustainable to buy clothes
produced by people who earn very low wages, work in poor conditions,
receive no benefits, and aren’t allowed union representation. A greener
solution is to support companies that treat their workers — whether
they’re employed in the United States or overseas — with fairness and
respect. (See the nearby sidebar, “The high costs of cheap labor,” for
more info.)
 Impact on the local economy: Supporting local companies helps to
create a thriving local and national economy.
 Impact on the environment: From commercial cotton grown using
unsustainable, intensive farming practices to clothing that contains
animal-based products or synthetic materials made from petrochemi-
cals, the where and how of clothing manufacturing can have a signifi-
cant negative impact on the environment. Check the labels as much as 
possible and if you’re unsure go for the green, natural option such as
organically produced cotton and wool.
So, what’s the solution for the individual consumer? It may seem that you
don’t have much sway in the massive clothing industry, but, in fact, you do.
One of the best ways to influence change is to start with your own shopping
habits, which we tell you how to do throughout the sections that follow.
Acquiring Your Clothing from 
All the Green Places
You can start making greener clothing decisions right away simply by finding
out which clothing retailers support environmentally and socially conscious
practices in the manufacture of their clothing. They may include retailers of
new, organically sourced clothing that adhere to Fairtrade or anti-sweatshop
policies, or retailers of used clothing.
The more packaging and plastic bags you bring home with your newly 
purchased clothes, the more of the world’s resources you use up and the
more waste you create. Buy clothes without packaging, and tote your own
reusable shopping bag to stores.

Chapter 11: Wearing It Well
The high costs of cheap labor
The next time you’re sorting through your closet,
take a quick look at the labels on your clothes to
find out where they came from (some may be even
better traveled than you are!). Today, much of 
the clothing sold in the U.S. is imported from over-
seas — from countries such as Bangladesh, China,
Fiji, India, Pakistan, Madagascar, Mexico, and
Turkey. These countries often offer low labor costs,
which in turn keep the manufacturing prices down
and make it possible to sell the clothes for less in
U.S. stores. The problem is that these countries
often don’t enforce the same labor standards as
are found in the U.S. As a result, imported clothing
items may have been made by people who are
poorly paid and working in poor conditions; some
may even be made with the help of child labor.
Even in the U.S., the situation isn’t always ideal.
Despite the Fair Labor Standards Act, some cloth-
ing factories operate outside the law, employing
people in poor conditions and not paying them even
the minimum wage. Many workers don’t complain
because they fear that they’ll lose their jobs or
because they don’t have the right paperwork to
allow them to stay and work legally in the U.S.
Using lower-paid labor in other countries or even
in the U.S. seems so attractive to some manufac-
turers because it’s a way to stay competitive. As a
result, it’s difficult for more-responsible manufac-
turers to compete in the industry, with the result
that some have shut down completely or have
moved their manufacturing processes overseas.
Some may argue that the cheaper clothes and
shoes become, the more shoppers will buy, and the
more jobs will become available for people over-
seas who wouldn’t have those jobs otherwise. 
And it’s true that boycotting certain brands can put
a firm out of business and leave workers high and
dry. This is the reason many nonprofit organizations
working in developing countries advise you not to
boycott goods unless the workers themselves want
a boycott.
It’s a difficult situation without any easy answers,
but you can start choosing a greener lifestyle for
yourself by researching where your clothing 
is coming from and choosing manufacturers or
retailers with policies that ensure fair treatment for
workers — whether they’re overseas or domestic.
By doing so, you support positive social and 
ethical behavior rather than negative. You also can
write letters to manufacturers whose policies
aren’t what you feel they should be, explaining why
you’re not buying their products.
Organizations working with suppliers and produc-
ers overseas to make sure that workers get as 
fair a deal as possible include provisions that
 Producers and workers are allowed to join
unions and other organizations that can 
protect their rights and ensure that they have
fair working conditions.
 Workers have fair wages and conditions that
allow them to afford to feed their families.
 Child labor isn’t used.
 Production methods are environmentally
friendly and pesticide-free.

manufacturers), they’re very likely to have space devoted to their efforts on
their Web sites. You can also ask store staff or management about how the
company’s clothes were manufactured.
Organizations dedicated to fair working conditions for the garment industry

tices. If you’re unhappy with your current clothing sources, start your search
for responsible companies by visiting the following sites:

turers to guarantee that they meet independently verified Fair Labor
(non-sweatshop) standards.

You can browse the online catalogs of Fairtrade producers around the
world at this site, some of which offer clothing and accessory products
such as jewelry.
If you want to know that the producers and workers who made your clothes
were fairly treated, buy from manufacturers and retailers who offer guaran-
tees that they’ve followed those provisions. You generally pay a bit more for
Fairtrade goods, but you may feel it’s money well spent.

Good clothes bought today will last long enough to be the vintage buys of the
future. If you buy fewer better-quality items instead of many cheaper items,
you help to reduce the amount of clothing produced in the long run. For
more on vintage clothing, see the next section.
Buying used: Vintage and 
secondhand clothes
One way to reduce the number of new clothes you cause to be manufactured
is to buy clothes from the past. Lots of good-quality and barely worn clothes
in secondhand, vintage, and nonprofit shops fit the bill for something 
different, and they’re certainly better than buying new from an environmental
point of view.
The great thing about becoming a vintage clothes convert is that it fits 
perfectly within the three Rs model of reducing, reusing, and recycling. Even
though many vintage clothes may have been made from unsustainable materi-
als, keeping these clothes in the supply-and-demand loop reduces the demand
for manufacturers to supply a new stock of unsustainable clothes — and it
keeps that groovy 1970s polyester shirt out of the landfill a while longer.

Avoiding counterfeit brands
If you think that the landscape of regular clothing
manufacturing and materials is tricky to navigate, it’s
got nothing on the world of counterfeit products.
These knock-offs that attempt to pass themselves
off as the real thing — from purses to shoes to high-
fashion clothes — are produced for the lowest 
possible price, which means that they’re most 
vulnerable to being made in sweatshop conditions.
You’re most likely to find counterfeit products in the
market stalls when you’re traveling overseas, but
they’re also available in the U.S., often in open-air
markets, from sidewalk vendors, and in independent
bargain stores.
If you know that the price is well below what it
should be and the source is questionable, the green-
est decision is to keep on walking without making a
purchase. Not only is the vendor stealing the intel-
lectual property of the rightful label owner, but you
have no way of knowing where or how the item was
made — except for a good guess that it wasn’t in a
green, ethical, or sustainable way.

Raid the wardrobes of your older relatives (with their permission, of course).
You may find all sorts of gems that no longer fit their owners but that you can
remodel or alter to fit you — and they’re free!
A quick search on the Internet shows a growing number of vintage clothes
retailers operating online. Online or not, the only trouble with vintage clothes
shopping is figuring out which retailers are selling authentic vintage clothes
and which ones are selling clothes made to look like vintage clothes. Protect
yourself by researching the style and age of clothing that you’re interested in
so that you’re able to spot obvious fakes (plastic buttons before plastic was in
wide use, for example, or fabrics that are inappropriate for the era). Start with
nonprofit shops and markets and online auction sites such as www.ebay.com.
Enter “vintage fashion” into your favorite search engine and you’ll find dozens
of stores — some of which may be in your area. Then research the stores to
check their reputations; don’t be afraid to ask a business owner questions
such as where the store sources its clothing.
When you go shopping for vintage clothes in bricks-and-mortar stores, take
along clothing you want to get rid of. You may be able to arrange a trade-in or
simply sell the items to the same store you buy from.
Living in a Material World
Clothing labels tell you where clothes were made, but they also tell you what
materials were used. The materials information can give you valuable clues
as to how green the production process was likely to be. Look for natural
fibers that come from plants and animals, such as cotton, hemp, and wool,
and aim for those that are organically produced.
If you want to be as green as possible, avoid clothes that have synthetic mate-
rials in them, no matter how much of a bargain they may appear to be in the
stores. Synthetic fabrics are produced using chemicals, including persistent
environmental pollutants (such as fabrics with Teflon coating), and take a long
time to break down in landfill sites. The most popular synthetic materials —
nylon and polyester — are made from petrochemicals. Processing petrochemi-
cals into small fibers uses a large amount of oil and energy and emits green-
house gases. Manufacturing polyester also uses a large amount of water.
After years during which sustainable clothing materials were the territory of
small, often hard-to-find specialty stores, their availability and accessibility is
increasing. Purchase clothing made from the following materials:
 Bamboo is essentially a type of grass that grows very quickly, so it’s one
of the most renewable materials out there. One caveat, however, is that
in some areas growers are replacing native vegetation with bamboo in
order to meet the demand given bamboo’s increasing popularity.

 Hemp is one of the greenest crops because it’s resistant to pests and
therefore doesn’t need chemicals to maintain its quality. It’s easy to
grow in large quantities and enriches the soil when in the ground, both
of which are big bonuses.
 Linen is made from flax, which is resistant to pests and grows more
easily than cotton.
 Organically grown cotton and wool isn’t genetically modified (in
cotton’s case), and its cultivation uses natural fertilizers and pesticides
and traditional farming practices. (See the sidebar “Beware cotton and
wool: Natural isn’t always green!” for more on cotton and wool.)
 Recycled materials are a green choice for clothing material even though
some chemicals and energy likely went into their production. For exam-
ple, clothes and shoes for outdoor use (especially in wet weather) can
be made using recycled polyester, rubber, and even car tires.
 Silk is made from the saliva produced by the larvae of several species 
of moth. (They’re commonly called silkworms, but they’re really caterpil-
lars.) Larvae are a sustainable source of material, but it takes thousands
of larvae to produce a silk tie, and some people prefer to avoid silk
because it can’t be produced without the death of a living creature.
 Soy isn’t just for eating and for candles; it also creates soft, silk-like 
fabrics when the leftovers from oil or tofu processing are processed and
spun into fiber.
If you want to buy alternatives to leather and fur (check out the sidebar
“Animal-based products: To wear or not to wear”), you’re in for a bit of a 
challenge. Cruelty-free and vegetarian clothing stores sell alternative prod-
ucts, but they’re often made of vinyl, PVC, and other chemically produced
materials that have major negative impacts on the environment, including
using significant quantities of oil, water, and energy and producing high
greenhouse gas emissions. The following companies, however, offer clothing
and footwear products that are made from both environmentally and animal-
friendly materials such as hemp, canvas, and microfiber synthetic leathers:
 Moo Shoes: www.mooshoes.com
 Alternative Outfitters Vegan Boutique: www.alternative
outfitters.com
 PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) Mall: www.peta
mall.com
Up to four barrels of oil can go into the manufacture of a fake fur jacket. So if
you don’t want to buy real fur, you may want to stay away from the fake stuff
as well.

Beware cotton and wool: Natural 
isn’t always green!
Just because the two most popular natural fibers,
cotton and wool, come from plants (cotton) and
animals (wool) doesn’t mean they’re green. Like
food, natural fibers are best when they come from
an organic farming process, whether it’s from a
cotton field or from a sheep’s back.
 Cotton:Cotton is one of the most natural fibers
on earth but is also a crop that uses the most
pesticides in order to protect the vulnerable
plant from insects and fungus. Pesticides can
create health problems for those who work on
cotton farms, contaminate ground and 
surface water, and aren’t good for the long-
term health of the soil. The Pesticide Action
Network North America (www.panna.org)
also suggests that pesticide residue stays 
in the cotton fabric after is has been 
manufactured.
Water is also an issue in the cotton manufac-
turing process: It takes hundreds of gallons of
water to make a cotton T-shirt, and if you add
in the dyes used and the amount of energy
required to process raw cotton, it doesn’t add
up to a very green fabric. The manufacturing
of most clothing materials involves the use of
huge quantities of water, which can lead to
problems for human populations in dry regions
where water is in short supply.
 Wool: Wool obviously comes from sheep,
which you may not associate with pesticides,
but in fact chemicals are used to maintain the
quality of wool. Sheep dip, the chemical 
concoction that sheep are dipped into to kill
parasites, contains organophosphates, which
scientists have connected to excessive tired-
ness, headaches, poor concentration, and
mood changes in humans exposed to it. Some
scientists also believe that organophosphates
could be linked to respiratory disease and
possibly neurological issues in children. (And
that’s not to mention the effect on the sheep
themselves.)
With regard to wool production, the animal wel-
fare agency People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA) is also concerned about sheep
being mistreated; the animals may be herded
together in a factory farm–type situation in
order to produce as much wool as possible in
the shortest time possible.
Synthetic and chemical products are sometimes
added to both cotton and wool clothing products,
including color dyes and bleach. There’s also an
increasing number of poly-cotton products on the
market that use chemicals; you may see them
referred to as permanent press, wrinkle-free, no
ironing needed, or crease-resistant.
Buy clothes made from organic cotton and wool,
which are grown and processed without the use
of toxic chemicals. To find them, check out the
Organic Consumers Association at www.
organicconsumers.org and the Organic
Trade Association at www.ota.com. You can
also look for a label that says “Global Organic
Textile Standard,” which is an international stan-
dard for organic textiles; visit www.global-
standard.org for more information.

When it comes to choosing clothing materials, also check the label to 
find out whether the clothing is dry clean only. The U.S. EPA has linked 
one of the traditional chemicals used in dry cleaning (perchlorethylene, 
or PERC) to headaches, cancer, and environmental damage. It’s best to 
avoid dry clean only products if you can. Otherwise, look for a dry 
cleaner that uses environmentally friendlier processes — and definitely 
not PERC.
Reusing and Recycling, Fashionwise
After you purchase (or even make) your clothes, the basic principles of 
green living kick in: reuse, repair, reconstruct, and recycle. Don’t throw 
anything out before you’ve gotten every ounce of wear out of it by fixing it,
recreating it, and reusing it. When you’ve exhausted all possibilities, think
about whether it’s still fit for someone else to wear or whether it can be 
recycled, if not as clothing then as something else.
By following these green living principles throughout the life cycle of your
clothes, you’re doing the most important thing: reducing the amount of 
clothing you buy in the first place. And that, in turn, reduces the amount 
that has to be produced.
223
Chapter 11: Wearing It Well
Animal-based products: To wear or not to wear
Some people refuse to eat food produced from 
animals and extend that position to not wearing
clothes made from animal products — including
leather, fur, reptile skins, and even wool. The 
reasons cited for avoiding animal products
include:
 Animal-based products involve the premature
death or injury of an animal and therefore are
inherently cruel.
 The global demand for some animal-based
products is greater than supply, so animal pop-
ulations can be threatened with disappear-
ance in certain cases.
 Modern methods of manufacturing leather
goods in factories use high levels of energy
similar to other mass-produced products
rather than the traditional methods that incor-
porate natural dyes and skins dried in the sun.

Encouraging your clothes to 
stick around for a while
One of the most effective methods of reducing the demand for clothes is to
keep all the items currently in people’s closets in circulation much longer than
usual. Whether it be by handing them on to other people or charities, trading
them over the Internet, or keeping them for yourself, you can ensure that your
clothes continue wearing on to reduce the demand for new supplies.
Try these tips for extending the life of your clothes:
 Wash clothes only when you need to, and opt for line or air drying 
rather than using a clothes dryer, which can shrink, stretch, or damage
fabric (not to mention the electricity it guzzles!).
 Pay attention to labels that say to wash clothing inside out — it generally
protects the fabric.
 Use cold water washes with detergent designed to work in cold water in
order to help retain the shape and color of your clothes, especially those
made from cotton.
 Pretreat stains immediately for best results.
 Refresh worn collars by carefully removing the collar, turning it around,
and sewing it back on.
 Reconstruct your clothes. For those with a smidgen of crafty, sewing, 
or artistic talents, it’s possible to take tired clothes and turn them into
something unique and unforgettable. Some of the techniques are super-
simple, like cutting off the sleeves of a T-shirt or converting long pants
into capris or shorts (especially for kids who get holes in the knees) by
cutting off the legs just above the knee and sewing a hem. You can take 
it much further by turning that questionable bridesmaid dress into a
fashion statement and even salvaging stained clothes with artful patch-
ing. You can see some other ideas in Figures 11-1 and 11-2.
For more great reconstructing ideas and guidance on how to achieve
them, look to Reconstructing Clothes For Dummies by Miranda Caroligne
Burns (Wiley).
 Use patches either on top or behind holes in your clothes to extend 
the life of the garment. Sew-on patches are much more dependable 
and durable than iron-on patches, but either type gets the job done.

Disposing of clothing
The last thing that you want to do with clothes that are no longer in fashion
is toss them in the trash for a quick trip to the landfill! If they don’t yet look
like rags, take them to a consignment clothing store. If the store accepts your
items for resale, you get some of your money back along with the knowledge
that your discarded clothing will go to a good home.

Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

For select items of clothing, such as designer labels, kids clothing, or plus
sizes, consider taken them to a specialty consignment store where you can
get the best possible price.
If a consignment store won’t take your clothing, find a nonprofit or charitable
organizations that will. Gently worn office wear for women, for example, may
be welcome at an organization that helps victims of domestic abuse get back
on their feet and into the workforce. Kids’ coats are often in demand in local
clothing drives as cold weather approaches. Taking this targeted approach
gives your clothes the best chance of being reused locally.
You also can donate clothing to a nonprofit or charity group that will resell or
donate your clothes to those less fortunate. Drop-off points often are located
in the parking lots of grocery stores and malls. The group sells or gives away
what it can, but be aware that some items may end up being bought by pri-
vate companies that give the designated charity a donation and then sell the
clothes in developing countries.
The clothes that end up developing countries may be unsuitable for the 
climate or culture of the country, and they may affect the success of local 
textile industries in those countries. Ask your nonprofit of choice about what
happens to the clothing that isn’t resold or donated locally, and opt for one
that keeps the clothes closer to home, if possible.
Last but not least, consider re-gifting clothing that you no longer want.
Everyone’s received at least one sweater that they wouldn’t be seen in under
any circumstances, but there may be someone you know who would like the
items you don’t (really!). Re-gifting is green because it reduces the amount
you buy, which in turn decreases the demand for clothing production. It’s 
still the thought that counts, however: Give the item to someone who you
genuinely believe will like or appreciate it. And while you’re at it, spare a
thought for the person who gave you the gift in the first place; it’s best not 
to re-gift their sweater to a mutual friend or family member.
If you simply can’t use the item any longer and there’s no life left in it, repur-
pose it. Use it as a cooking apron, cleaning cloth, cleaning rag, shoe polisher,
or something similarly functional. Save any buttons, zippers, elastic, or 
trims for use in repairing other clothes. If you don’t need extra rags and such
around the house, and if the material was organically produced and the fabric
wasn’t dyed or treated with chemicals, it may be fodder for the compost pile,
where it can recycle some nutrients back into the soil (see Chapter 8 for
more on composting).

Ethical Investments, Donations,
and Banking Solutions
In This Chapter
 Turning to ethical bank account options and banking institutions
 Making green investment choices
 Being charitable in a green and ethical way
Your money has power. If you pay for green and ethical products and 
services whenever possible, for example, you directly help to reduce
greenhouse gases and support responsible businesses, and you indirectly
bring green products within the financial reach of more people (thanks to the
law of supply and demand).
Your money also makes a powerful statement when you choose what not to
spend it on. By avoiding not-so-green products and services, for instance,
and especially by letting the businesses that sell them know why you’re not
buying them, you (and others who do the same) may force those companies
to change their practices. Although you can never bank on changing a 
company’s ways, remember that sellers adapt to the changing marketplace,
of which you are a part.
The same principles apply to your banking, savings, and investment
accounts. As more people choose green or ethical financial products, they
send a message to the entire industry that these products are important and
that there’s a growing number of options, from banks that are conscious of
their supplies or work environments to credit cards that offer carbon offsets
to mutual funds that invest only in companies or organizations that fit 
specific socially responsible criteria.

Choosing a Green Home for Your Cash
There are two elements that you can consider when it comes to green homes
for your money: accounts and institutions. It’s important to remember that
when you deposit money into an account, the money doesn’t sit in your
account in your financial institution. Instead, the institution lends out the
money to other people and businesses or places it into investments that will
be profitable for the financial institution. In other words, it puts your money
to work, returning some of the profit to you in the form of interest and using
the rest of the profit to help fund its operations.
A financial institution that’s concerned with the environment and with social
issues such as poverty or homelessness places a strong emphasis on lending
or investing funds in ways that help the planet and its people. These institu-
tions may not be available in your area, however; in that case, you can at
least look for individual accounts that help the environment. In this section,
we provide some insight into all these issues.
Demystifying ethical checking 
and savings accounts
When you examine how your finances can help the planet, start with your
checking and savings accounts. Some financial institutions have realized 
that their clients are concerned about the planet and the good of the people,
creatures, and plants living on it, so they offer accounts that are linked to
environmental or community-building efforts. Ethical or green banking is
growing in popularity and so more accounts are being offered.
A financial institution’s account-greening options may include the following
(or other similar options):
 Donating a set amount or part of the interest on your savings account
each month to a green cause
 Giving you the option to purchase checks made from 100 percent post-
consumer recycled paper
 Using the money in your savings account as leverage to provide funding
for loans to energy-efficient real estate projects or clean energy and eco-
friendly businesses (this is the case with the Capital Green Account from
Five Star Bank, www.fivestarbank.com)
 Working with environmental or conservation groups to help them 
purchase property in order to protect it
 Offering free or low-cost online Internet banking in order to reduce
paper statements sent through the mail
230
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

As with any other kind of accounts, shop around to get the checking and 
savings accounts that best suit both your banking needs and your ethical
concerns. Because green ethics aren’t always black-and-white choices, and
because implementation of green investing varies with each financial institu-
tion, you may find that you need to prioritize what matters most to you in a
green account. (And by the way, be cautious about the word “green”; some
banks use it simply as an account name, like “gold” or “classic,” without any
link to environmental causes.)
When you begin researching the green options available at various financial
institutions, keep the following questions in mind:
 What service charges does the account carry?
 What interest or other profits or dividends does the account return 
to you?
 What are the account’s specific eco-friendly, ethical, or sustainable 
features?
 Does the account require a minimum deposit?
If your own bank or building society can’t give you a green version of the 
kind of account you’re looking for, move your money to one that can. Make it
clear to the previous bank that you’re moving your money because you want
a green account. If you’re having trouble finding green accounts, check the
options at www.socialinvest.org/directory, a listing of various green
or socially responsible financial services.
Backing an ethical banking institution
You may decide that it’s not enough simply to have a green account — 
perhaps you want to do more by ensuring that you’re banking with a financial
institution that embraces green and ethical action in every facet of its opera-
tions. In this case, it’s important to match the institution — whether it’s a
bank, credit union, or other entity — with the standards that you personally
have for what’s socially and environmentally responsible.
Understanding what you can expect
To assess where your banking institution falls on world standards, take at look
at the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary initiative that gives busi-
nesses a framework for acting within well-accepted principles. The compact
provides an excellent guideline when you’re considering which standards to
ask of your financial institution.
The Global Compact asks businesses to follow these principles, divided into
four main areas:
231
Chapter 12: Ethical Investments, Donations, and Banking Solutions

 Human rights: Businesses should support and respect human rights and
ensure that they’re not complicit in human rights abuses.
 Labor standards: Business should uphold the right of freedom of associ-
ation and collective bargaining and should eliminate all forms of forced
labor, child labor, and discrimination.
 Environment: Business should take a precautionary approach to envi-
ronmental challenges and support initiatives that encourage greater
environmental responsibility and environmentally friendly technologies.
 Corruption: Businesses should work against corruption in all forms.
In other words, you may be looking for a financial institution that doesn’t lend
money to or invest in companies that use factories overseas or at home that
don’t provide reasonable working conditions for workers; that has proactive
antidiscrimination policies for its own operation; that fully supports as many
environmentally friendly measures as possible in its own operation and in its
funding of other businesses or organizations; and that has a written code of
ethics that it abides by.
You may have specific requirements that you want your financial institution 
to meet regarding environmentally friendly practices, but keep in mind that 
a truly green organization can have positive influences well beyond its own
operations. In practical terms, your financial institution may not support 
businesses that use child labor or that pollute or damage the environment, 
or perhaps it focuses on investing in your community to help with affordable
housing programs or energy-efficient renovations. Create a list of issues that
are important to you, and then research what’s available to you in terms of
financial institutions that tackle them (see the next section, “Getting the 
information you seek”).
Some banks may offer one or two ethically sound accounts but ignore green
and ethical issues in the rest of their business dealings. If you want to know
that your bank is behaving ethically as well as using your money ethically, ask
about its code of business ethics and its social and environmental policies.
The following financial institutions are just a few examples of the green- and
community-focused options increasingly being found across the United States:
 ShoreBank Pacific: Based in the Pacific Northwest, ShoreBank Pacific
(www.eco-bank.com) supports sustainable development in many ways,
even employing an environmental scientist to advise customers on green
issues from wetlands development to energy efficiency. The bank offers
options such as using online banking and a check card instead of paper
checks to reduce paper use.
232
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

 Chittenden: A Vermont-based bank, Chittenden (www.chittenden.com)
places a high priority on community development initiatives, including
socially responsible banking. Customers can opt for a lower interest rate
on savings, for example, to provide interest rate discounts for borrowers
such as community groups, small family farms, and conservation groups.
 Permaculture Credit Union: Headquartered in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
Permaculture (pcuonline.org) brings together customer-members
who support the concept of permaculture, which includes care of the
Earth, care of people, and the reinvestment of surplus to benefit the
Earth and its people. The credit union supports the local community,
including offering loans for fuel-efficient vehicles and energy 
conservation measures at home.
 Wainwright Bank & Trust: Based in Boston, the Wainwright Bank &
Trust Company (www.wainwrightbank.com) focuses on social justice
and community development issues, including supporting affordable
housing, the environment, women’s issues, health services, hunger and
homelessness, diversity and non-discrimination, and social activism.
The fact that we list them here doesn’t mean that we recommend these insti-
tutions specifically; they’re simply examples of how green banking works.
Credit unions are your main option aside from banks (you may find some
mortgage companies or loan providers that are green as well, but banks and
credit unions tend to offer a full range of financial services rather than just
one or two); they’re financial cooperatives owned and controlled by their
members, who often have some sort of common bond that determines who
can join. For example, members may work for the same company, live in the
same area, or belong to the same club, church, or trade union. Credit unions
offer savings, loans, and all kinds of financial investments, but because
they’re member-owned, they’re often more likely to know and respond to
what members want.
Getting the information you seek
To find institutions that you’ll be happy banking at, first talk to your current
financial institution about its practices. If they’re not green enough, a quick
Internet search of different local options may turn up a good alternative.
Look for community-based institutions, which are often more focused on
what’s important to local residents than larger nationwide organizations.
Read through their Web sites thoroughly to find out about the programs and
accounts that they offer. Most also have an information line that you can call
to ask questions; if the customer service representative doesn’t have the
answers, he or she can schedule an appointment for you to talk to someone
who does.
233
Chapter 12: Ethical Investments, Donations, and Banking Solutions

When researching various banking institutions, consider asking about their
practices in these areas:
 What’s the institution’s lending policy? The lending policy is one of the
biggest impacts that any financial institution makes, so finding out the
kinds of customers that it provides money to is one way to determine how
green a bank or credit union is. For example, does the company ensure
that loan recipients don’t trade arms, harm the environment, or exploit
workers? If the policy doesn’t clarify something such as this in writing,
you can assume that it may not be concerned about what it’s funding.
 Is the institution a member of the Social Investment Forum? Many finan-
cial institutions in the U.S. that follow environmentally and socially
responsible practices are members of the Social Investment Forum, which
focuses on socially and environmentally responsible investing. You can
find a member listing by state at www.socialinvest.org.
 Does the institution provide an annual social or environmental report
about its activities? If it doesn’t, its annual financial report should have
sections devoted to its eco-friendly or social investment actions.
 What amount does the institution donate to environmental or social
nonprofit organizations each year? This isn’t about lending money; it’s
about giving money, no strings attached.
After investigating your local options for green banking, you may realize that
you want to work with a particular institution even if it doesn’t measure up on
every front. If it’s committed to change and gives you an opportunity to have a
voice in those coming changes, that may be enough.
Greening Your Investment Portfolio
Whether you have a complex portfolio of stocks and investment products, 
an investment-linked insurance policy, or just a few mutual funds tucked away
in a retirement account, you have an increasing number of green choices, 
or at least choices that are greener than they once were. In fact, out of the $24
trillion that currently makes up the U.S. investment marketplace, the Social
Investment Forum reports that $2.3 trillion — almost 10 percent — is invested
in socially responsible financial products.
The decisions that you make about ethical investing are completely up to you.
The most important thing to keep in mind when it comes to investing is that
you may not be able to find one investment that’s environmentally or socially
perfect for you. You should be prepared to make compromises if it comes
down to that, and you shouldn’t forget that it’s perfectly acceptable to make
money to protect your own financial health. In this section, we help you 
navigate the market so that you know just what you’re looking for as well as
what you’re getting.
234
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

Whether the products or companies involved are ethical, green, or socially
responsible, investments that are outside of Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) protection can gain and, more importantly, lose value.
The FDIC covers deposits (at insured banks) including checking, NOW, sav-
ings, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, up to $100,000. It
doesn’t cover money invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, life insurance
policies, annuities, or municipal securities. You can find out more about all
this at www.fdic.gov.
When it comes to green investing, you have myriad options, including buying
stocks, buying shares in mutual funds, investing in your pension fund, and
investing in life insurance. This section looks at green options for all these
investments but doesn’t cover how to invest because that’s a topic for a
whole other book. In short, however, you can invest directly in companies by
buying their shares (either setting yourself up with your own trading account
and buying the shares yourself or buying through a stockbroker or financial
advisor). Or you can invest indirectly in a number of companies at the same
time by buying shares of a mutual fund. (Mutual funds work by pooling
together the money from many different investors and putting it toward
shares in a number of different companies — the advantages are that you
don’t need a lot of money to invest in most mutual funds and they can be
easier to access than buying individual stocks.)
When it comes to investing your money responsibly, it’s essential to obtain
advice from a knowledgeable, qualified financial advisor, preferably one who
specializes in socially responsible, ethical, or green investments. Specialist
advisors offer all the services of a mainstream adviser but also can advise
you on aligning your financial plans with your values and beliefs. If you’re
investing in stocks, working with a stockbroker who understands the ethical
markets is particularly crucial.
To find a financial planner in your area who can advise you on green 
investments, search the online directories at the Social Investment Forum
(www.socialinvest.org) or Co-op America (www.coopamerica.org).
You also can search online through the Certified Financial Planner Board of
Standards, Inc. at www.cfp.net.
Identifying your options 
for investing directly
To invest directly, you can buy shares from specific companies. When 
you invest in companies with strong corporate social responsibility, you
encourage and support them in their efforts. Don’t be shy about asking those
companies about their business ethics and finding out if they produce a
social or environmental report. You also can check their annual financial
reports, stock prospectuses, company brochures, and Web sites for 
information about their activities.
235
Chapter 12: Ethical Investments, Donations, and Banking Solutions

When investing directly in a particular company, choose companies that
 Are developing solar or wind power or are encouraging alternative
energy technologies or energy efficiency
 Offer micro-loans in developing areas of the world (micro-loans are 
very small loans given to small-scale entrepreneurs who wouldn’t 
usually qualify for credit; loans are designed to allow them to develop
businesses that can support them and their families)
 Provide healthcare to a wide audience
 Follow a principled code of ethics
Another way to get involved with a company directly is to invest a small
amount in an environmentally unfriendly company in order to vote or bring
up motions at shareholder meetings that could influence the company 
operations. Of course, you should check with your financial advisor about
the process of buying stocks and any responsibility that may come with 
your purchase, but this can be an effective way to add your voice to those
opposing the company’s practices. Your involvement may spur other share-
holders to add their voices to yours and may even make the company think
twice about some of its actions and attempt to find greener alternatives.
There’s really no way to gauge how responsive a company will be ahead of
time, but this is an option to consider.
Investing indirectly in a mutual 
fund or index fund
If you want to invest indirectly, choose a mutual fund or a stock index fund
that demonstrates green ethics. For example, in efforts to preserve natural
resources and encourage the use of alternative fuels, stay away from a fund
with oil companies in its portfolio, and opt for one pursuing technology 
that uses energy more efficiently.
Ethical or socially responsible funds operate on the principle of not investing
money in enterprises that would harm the environment, people around 
the world, or animals and wildlife, and some actively encourage progressive
green companies. These fund mangers generally choose the investments
based on three different strategies:
 Screening: The fund’s rules include specific criteria about what is and
isn’t allowed as an investment.
 Preference: The fund’s rules include guidelines about company opera-
tions so that if a number of different companies have similar share 
performance, the ones with the best environmental or social policies
and records are chosen.
236
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 

 Engagement: The fund’s rules don’t necessarily exclude or include 
specific investments but instead aim for companies that could be 
influenced by the fund manager to improve their practices.
The Sierra Club Stock Fund (sierraclubfunds.com), for example, says 
that it invests in the top candidates among the most environmentally and
socially progressive mid- and large-cap U.S. companies based on a number 
of different screening processes. The Winslow Green Growth Fund (www.
winslowgreen.com) says that it invests at least 80 percent of its net assets
in domestic companies that are either environmentally proactive or sensitive.
These two funds are examples only, not recommendations for investment.
Although ethical funds once had a reputation for lower financial returns than
general funds, many ethically or socially responsible funds now provide con-
sistent and healthy growth on an annual basis. Your money can have a posi-
tive impact on both your financial health and that of the environment.
Remember, though, that the value of your investments can go up or down —
there are no guarantees. Even if a company or a mutual fund has performed
well in the past, that doesn’t mean its share values will go up in the future.
You’re taking a gamble, so don’t gamble with money you can’t afford to lose.
That goes for any stock market investment — ethical or not.
Other investments: Pension funds 
and life insurance policies
As part of your green investment portfolio you can consider a couple of 
other financial products, including pension funds that are managed by your
employer (some employers provide this as a benefit) and investment-linked
life insurance. (Life insurance may be offered as a benefit by an employer, 
but often it isn’t, leaving you responsible for finding a policy that will cover
your debts and protect your family in case of your death; if you choose an
investment-linked policy, you can look for one that invests in green or
socially sustainable options.)
If you have an employer-based pension fund, research its background 
information to find out how ethical or socially responsible it is. If you’d like 
to see it improve in this regard, talk to the fund manager or your employer
about ways to invest in more acceptable products. If the pension fund is part
of a union contract agreement, you also may be able to ask the union to help
convince management to go greener.
Many life insurance policies have an investment component as well, and these
investments can be just as socially or ethically responsible as any other. If you
already have a policy in place, you may not be able to change it (to a greener
one, for example) without incurring a significant financial penalty. In this case,
you may have to settle for letting the insurance company know that ethical or
237
Chapter 12: Ethical Investments, Donations, and Banking Solutions

environmental issues and investments are important to you as a consumer. 
On the other hand, if you’re looking for investment-linked insurance policies,
research the ones available to you by working with a broker, by calling 
insurance companies directly, and by researching them online, including at
www.socialinvest.org.
Giving Ethically
If you’re looking to give away some of your hard-earned income, thousands 
of charities and nonprofit organizations are only too eager to accept it. Give 
to local housing projects or to clean-water projects in remote parts of the
world — whatever your principles, there’s sure to be a charity to match.
It’s absolutely critical to understand who you’re giving your money to and
how they operate. Some organizations that call themselves charities or 
nonprofits may in fact not be as charitable or nonprofit as you would want
them to be. You need to make sure that as much of your money as possible
goes to the cause that you’re supporting rather than other costs, such as the
administration or salary costs of the charitable organization. You also need 
to make sure that your aid gets to the people it’s designed to help — that food
aid for developing nations is reaching those who are starving, for example,
and not being siphoned off by officials or middlemen in those nations.
Giving is a wonderful action — giving mindfully and responsibly is even better.
238
Part III: Spending and Investing Your Green (Money) 
The indirect gift that keeps on giving
When it comes to giving gifts to friends and 
relatives, go green! Consider giving money in your
friend’s name to a project or a cause that benefits
someone in need elsewhere in the world.
Recent years have seen a big increase in this 
kind of ethical giving. You can donate money for the
purchase of goats, donkeys, chickens, sheep, trees,
guide dogs, wheelchairs, bicycles, school equip-
ment, and water filters. In many cases, the donation
goes well beyond the immediate gift, offering a
chance for people to develop independence and to
support themselves and their families, helping to lift
themselves out of poverty or dependence. A wheel-
chair, for example, may allow someone the mobility
to go to work. A cow may offer milk and related
products that will feed a family for years.
The charity running the program usually gives you a
card or certificate showing that money has been
donated on behalf of your family member or friend,
and you give that person the card showing what
has been donated in their name. A gift of this sort
checks all the boxes: It helps someone, is green,
and doesn’t damage the environment, and there’s
no need to worry for weeks about what to buy
someone. It’s appropriate for nearly every occasion:
holidays, birthdays, weddings, graduations, and so
on. And there’s no wasteful wrapping paper either!

Making sure you know where 
your money will go
Sometimes choosing which cause to donate to is difficult because you can’t
guarantee that your money will get where you intend it to. This is a significant
problem that you need to be aware of when considering where you put your
money. In some cases, food and blankets for victims of natural disasters end
up in warehouses because roads are too dangerous for transporting items to
where they’re needed. In other cases, the charitable organizations require so
much money in order to support their administration that you’re in effect
funding the organization, not the cause.
To make sure that the charity you’re interested in is legitimate and worthwhile,
do the following:
 Call the charity or nonprofit’s head office to find out how much of 
the money you give ends up invested in the project you pick and how
much goes to administrative or fundraising costs. The Better Business
Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance recommends that at least 65 percent of
total charity expenses should go to program service activities rather
than administration. Charities regularly report this information in annual
reports and to potential donors; if a charity isn’t willing to share this
information with you, don’t donate to it.
 Search news stories about a charity’s work. Try Internet searches for
the organization’s name to find possible news stories about its work.
 Seek independent advice about the charity. Turn to the Charity
Navigator (www.charitynavigator.org) and your local Better
Business Bureau (including the BBB’s Wise Giving Alliance at
www.give.org).
 Check whether your contribution is tax-deductible. Just because an
organization is a registered charity with the IRS doesn’t mean that every
donation is tax-deductible. Always ask before you donate.
Considering your options
After you decide on a charity that you’d like to support, you have a number
of different ways to make your donation — it could be a one-time thing 
or something that you commit to for the long term. Small amounts given 
regularly can be very effective: They’re relatively painless for you, but
because the charitable organization knows they’re coming, they’re able to
budget and plan more effectively. This section looks at how to go about
making your donation.
239
Chapter 12: Ethical Investments, Donations, and Banking Solutions

If you want to make a one-time donation to a green charity or nonprofit 
organization, you can always make a direct payment to the charity. Other
handy ways include purchasing charity greeting cards. You usually can find
the cards for sale on the charity’s Web site or during the Christmas season 
in supermarkets, department stores, and gift shops. Also, some credit cards
give you points for dollars spent and sometimes include the option of charity
donation for point exchanges.
If you want to donate on a regular basis, you have a few options to make it
more convenient (in case you don’t feel like writing out a check every month):
 A direct debit program transfers the amount you designate from your
bank account to the charity of your choice each month. You also may 
be able to give through work; your donation is taken directly from your
paycheck and paid straight to the charity.
 Regular (such as monthly) credit card charges work similarly to direct
debit programs, except that the amount is charged against your credit
card rather than coming from your bank account.
 Affinity or charity credit cards give a small percentage of your spending
to charitable or nonprofit causes. For example, General Electric offers 
a credit card that provides $1 in carbon offsets for every $100 that you
spend on the card, and every Earth Day (April 22), the company pur-
chases the appropriate amount of offsets of greenhouse gas emissions.
Find out more about this particular card at www.myearthrewards.com.
In addition, numerous organizations have affinity agreements with credit
card providers, allowing their members to use credit cards that support
their programs.

In this part . . .
B
ecause vehicles and airplanes are some of the biggest
sources of carbon emissions and other pollutants,
this part covers what you can do when traveling (or plan-

This includes alternatives to using your vehicle in all kinds
of situations, but we also understand that sometimes you
just can’t do without the drive. That’s why we also cover
energy-efﬁcient and cleaner fuel options and technologies
that either are available now or are on the horizon.
This part also looks at greening your travel plans —

local communities, and still meet your needs to get away,
have fun, and maybe even do something you’ve never
done before.

I
t’s often said that North Americans have a love affair with their vehicles —
and there’s a lot of truth to that. From the daily commute to the annual
family road trip, it’s second nature to hop into the vehicle and head out on
the open road. But this romance comes with a price: rapidly decreasing sup-
plies of oil, increased pollution in the form of smog and acid rain, and grow-
ing global warming on account of the emission of climate-changing
greenhouse gases.
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, American adults use
vehicles to travel 1⁄2 mile or less to the tune of 15 million miles every single
day. That distance would take ten minutes or less to walk and would be even
quicker by bicycle. Skipping these quickie car trips and either walking or
biking instead would save 1.2 million gallons of gas and $3.9 million in gas
costs! In addition, almost a quarter of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions come
from vehicles. In 2003, traffic congestion in the U.S. spewed 23 million tons of
carbon dioxide into the air; in terms of climate change, that’s like putting 3.8
million more vehicles on the road.
Vehicles that use alternatives to gas and diesel fuel (discussed in detail in
Chapter 14) offer some energy relief, but alternative fuel alone isn’t the
answer. Rather than wait for the development of more-efficient vehicles (by
which time oil and gas reserves may have dwindled even further), environ-
mentalists agree that making significant decreases in vehicle use is the way
to go. Because the continued high level of vehicle usage is dependent on
unsustainable fuel sources, the logical alternative is to turn to sustainable
options such as walking, cycling, public transportation, and carpooling or
car-sharing programs.

244
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
You may wonder how realistic it is to reduce your driving. Not all the sustain-
able options that we cover in this chapter will be practical for you and your
family every time you go somewhere. But do you need to use a vehicle for
every trip, every day? Can you maintain your traveling freedom by owning
and using a vehicle while ensuring the sustainability of urban areas? The
answer is yes, if you’re willing to balance your vehicle use with other trans-
portation options — some of which you may even really appreciate. This
chapter discusses some of those sustainable transportation options, along
with various initiatives aimed at helping you to leave your vehicle in the
garage more often (or get rid of it altogether, if you prefer!).
The rewards of mindful transport
Changing your traveling habits benefits the
environment, your peace of mind, and your
wallet. The relative cost savings can be sub-
stantial: When you take into account all the
expenses that go into a vehicle, the American
Automobile Association (AAA) estimates that
the average cost is approximately 52 cents per
mile. In comparison, the average cost of riding
public transportation is estimated to be 20.7
cents per mile. And in 2001, American house-
holds drove an average 21,187 miles, up from
12,423 in 1969.
If you need more incentive to change the way you
get around, imagine better air quality resulting in
fewer cases of asthma, fewer deaths and injuries
due to traffic accidents, and safer walking and
cycling spaces. The greenhouse gases and other
pollutants that vehicles produce contribute to
problems with air quality such as particle pollu-
tion, especially in cities. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has estimated that par-
ticle pollution in nine cities across the U.S. is
responsible for more than 4,700 people dying
early deaths each year.
Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide aren’t
the only emissions that vehicles produce (see
Chapter 1 for the full definition of greenhouse
gases). Add into the mix hydrocarbons, nitrogen
oxides, and particulate matter and you get the full,
unhealthy picture. A number of these contami-
nants have been linked to cancer, birth defects,
brain and nerve damage, and long-term injury to
the lungs and breathing passages.
Car emissions are especially unhealthy for the
increasing number of asthma sufferers in the
world. Vehicle emissions that cause smog and
soot have been proven to worsen asthma and
trigger attacks. Some evidence suggests that
ozone, which is a main ingredient in smog, and
exhaust particles combine to cause asthma in
some people. According to the American Lung
Association’s State of the Air Report for 2007,
nearly half of the U.S. population lives in coun-
ties that have unhealthy levels of either ozone
or particle pollution.
One of the additional benefits of reducing your
vehicle use is that it eases pressure on the
demand for fossil fuels, especially oil. Oil is a non-
renewable source of energy that’s quickly being
depleted, with some forecasts estimating that
only a 40-year supply remains. To make things
more challenging, most of the oil that was easy to
get to has already been accessed, so it’s becom-
ing more expensive for oil companies to access
the oil, and they’re beginning to look at areas that
haven’t yet been drilled, including some previ-
ously untouched environments where drilling
would seriously affect natural habitats.

Sharing the Driving — And the Car!
Car-sharing programs are becoming increasingly popular in many cities in the
U.S. Although they operate in different ways, they come in these two basic
flavors:
 Carpooling: How often do you drive somewhere alone and see hundreds
of other drivers going in the same direction as you — also alone?
Arrange to drive to the office with a colleague or to take neighbors’ chil-
dren to and from school. Tried-and-true carpooling has been around for
years, encouraged in part by cities with dedicated carpool travel lanes
on major highways for use solely by vehicles with passengers (the
number varies, but it’s always more than just the driver). In most cases,
carpoolers take turns being the driver and using their own vehicles.
You don’t have to carpool with fellow employees, however. If you’re
looking for someone with whom to travel to work — or even across the
country — visit www.erideshare.com. This free service connects
people all over the country who are willing to share long distance or
commuter journeys.
Warning: If you’re carpooling with someone you don’t know, always be
extremely careful. Erideshare offers safety tips, but the bottom line is
that you should never share a vehicle with someone you don’t trust.
 Car-sharing: This arrangement operates differently from carpooling in
that it replaces the need for your own vehicle. You pay a fee that gives
you access to a vehicle (or a pool of vehicles), usually parked nearby or
in an easily accessible location. When you need a vehicle for something
(a shopping trip, perhaps), you make a reservation and then pick up the
vehicle, make the trip, and return the vehicle.
Typical car-sharing costs are $10 an hour, but many programs allow you
to rent by the day or longer if needed (although it’s worth checking to
see if conventional rental agencies are more economical for longer-term
rentals, especially if they offer low-emissions vehicles).
Several car-sharing programs operate in the U.S., but the two most popu-
lar are Zipcar (www.zipcar.com) and Flexcar (www.flexcar.com).
Check your local options too by searching the Internet — try “car sharing”
and your community name; cities such as Austin, Chicago, Philadelphia,
and Madison also have car-sharing programs, and some communities
have created their own.
The greatest impact of car-sharing is that it reduces the number of single-
vehicle trips and therefore the number of vehicles on the road.
245
Chapter 13: Choosing and Using Your Transportation Wisely

The Ins and Outs of Public Transportation
Using buses and trains is greener because there’s strength in numbers: The
amount of polluting gases emitted by a bus or train divided by the number of
passengers means that each individual is responsible for much less pollution
than an individual in a vehicle. (Buses and trains also cut down on traffic con-
gestion, which otherwise wastes your time and money.) All told, using public
transport reduces the carbon footprint of your journey (see Chapter 1 for
more information about carbon footprints).
People give several standard reasons for not using public transport, but others
give just as many reasons for loving it. Those against trains and buses often
refer to safety and security concerns, unreliability, the extra travel time involved,
and lack of services near where they live. Advocates for public transport argue
that trains and buses can be safer and more secure than vehicles; passengers
benefit from becoming part of a community with other passengers; they have
time to read the papers, do the daily crossword puzzle, and complete paper-
work; and they arrive at their destinations feeling more relaxed.
The reality is somewhere in between: Realistically, there may be times and
places when safety is a concern, and reading a full-sized newspaper in a
packed subway car can be challenging. But many objections to public trans-
portation can be alleviated or even overcome by choosing your routes and
times carefully: Leaving 30 minutes earlier for your commute to work, for
example, may give you some much-appreciated elbow room.
246
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
The sustainability of public transport
Many buses and trains run on diesel or electri-
cal energy, which aren’t necessarily the clean-
est sources, but because they carry so many
people at one time, they still fall into the sus-
tainable category. Automobiles can only take a
limited number of people, and they regularly
take only one or two. In contrast, most buses
easily carry upwards of 60 passengers, espe-
cially if they’re articulated (long) models.
Depending on the time of day and how many
coaches used, subway and commuter train ser-
vices can carry hundreds of passengers in each
train.
Now, many bus fleets are being upgraded to
more environmentally friendly fuels, including
compressed natural gas, hybrid-electric, and
ultra-low sulfur diesel, and new regulations for
diesel locomotives are being phased in, too.

If public transportation is reasonably effective at getting you where you need
to go, think seriously about switching — if even for just a few days a week —
from your vehicle to your local options: buses, commuter trains, even ferries.
If you don’t have reasonable access to public transport from where you live,
consider driving to the nearest train station or bus stop and leaving your
vehicle there.
To find the best option, check your local transport service provider’s Web site
to see whether you can get from home to work (and other destinations for that
matter). Most providers have excellent Web sites that can help you plan your
journey; you can find timetable information, route maps, fare information, tick-
eting options, and destination information. Some of the larger agencies even
provide you with trip planners and detailed directions. On these sites, you
enter your home address, the address of your destination, and the time you
want to leave, and you’re provided with the quickest transport options, route
information, the bus stop or train station to get off at, and even walking routes
and distances to your selected destination. You also can call your local trans-
port offices for more information.
Check www.hopstop.com to see if it services your city. If it does, use the site
to navigate public transit more easily. The site gives you all kinds of options
for combining different forms of transportation, including walking.
247
Chapter 13: Choosing and Using Your Transportation Wisely
Encouraging your employer’s contribution
The most obvious trip to consider ditching your
vehicle for is your journey from home to work.
Many initiatives that encourage a more balanced
approach to vehicle use rely on a major player in
society — the workplace. Employers are becom-
ing more interested in encouraging their employ-
ees to leave their vehicles at home, too.
Many companies have become burdened by
employees expecting vehicles with their salary
packages. But if businesses push alternatives
instead, they benefit along with the environ-
ment. Cutting down on the number of company
vehicles means employers need less parking
provision and can use the additional space for
more productive purposes.
Talk to your employer about changing your start
and finish times so that you can travel on public
transportation when it isn’t so busy. If you’re the
boss, think about whether you really need all
your staff to start work at the same time and
especially at the same time as all the other
workplaces in your area. If not, institute stag-
gered or flexible schedules for your employees.
Encourage your employer to provide benefits or
work options that make it easier for staff to
choose more sustainable transportation.
Incentives that encourage employees to reduce
their vehicle use include the following:
 Public transit fare subsidies and passes:
These can be an affordable alternative to
providing company vehicles, and they’re an
incentive for employees to choose public
transport over operating a vehicle with its
fuel, parking, and maintenance costs.
(continued)

248
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
 Personalized travel information: Working
with local public transportation and munic-
ipal authorities to make transit, walking, and
cycling route information available helps
staff plan their commutes.
 Better workplace bus shelter facilities: If
bus shelters are an issue, the company may
be able to work with the municipal and tran-
sit authorities to find a solution.
 Premium parking space for carpools:
Allocating parking spaces in favorable loca-
tions for those who carpool to work is an
added incentive for those programs.
 Flexible work arrangements:
Flexible
schedules and telecommuting make it pos-
sible to leave the vehicle at home some of
the time, to drive at times of least conges-
tion, or to use public transport at a more
convenient time of day.
 Mileage programs: These programs keep
track of miles saved thanks to public trans-
portation, carpooling, or other sustainable
choices in order to reward those who
reduce their vehicle usage.
 Bicycle pools: Providing bikes for use to
and from home could be a real plus for staff.
 Low-emission vehicles: If staff need vehi-
cles to do their jobs, companies can provide
low-emission vehicles or give incentives,
such as a premium mileage rate, for staff to
choose them for themselves.
 Real-time news: Public transit service
announcements and other real-time
information can help staff plan their jour-
neys home in case of unexpected problems
on transit routes.
 Special events: Public transport, walking,
and cycling events (such as breakfasts,
lunches, seminars, and so on) can encour-
age staff to get onboard.
 Web site links: Timetables and links to
interactive trip planners from the company’s
Web site make things easier when it comes
to route planning.
If your workplace doesn’t have sustainable
travel options or incentives in place, ask some
of your colleagues to join you in lobbying for
them. If you can gather support, go to your man-
ager with a report that outlines the benefits for
the company in developing them, such as:
 Team building: Understanding staff needs
(such as public transit incentives) facilitates
better relationships between staff and man-
agement.
 Turnover reduction: Adding sustainable
options to employee benefit packages
enhances the company’s ability to retain
and attract staff.
 Image enhancement: Adopting sustainable
approaches helps to boost the company’s
image in the community.
 Expense reduction: Subsidizing employee
public transport instead of providing vehi-
cles as part of salary packages can help to
reduce company expenses.

Manual Transport: These Legs Were
Made for Walking (And Pedaling)
The greenest alternative to vehicle use is to walk or ride a bicycle to your
destination; you also get all the health benefits of active living. Although
many people live too far from work, stores, or entertainment facilities to walk
or cycle all the way, an increasing trend in many cities around the world is
living close to the workplace and social attractions. This is a reversal of the
donut effect that had people moving out of the inner cities to the suburbs; as
city governments place more emphasis on redeveloping downtowns, people
are moving back.
Even if it’s too far to walk or cycle from your home to your destination, walk-
ing or cycling to a nearby train or bus stop is still much healthier and less
expensive than driving. In fact, cycling is becoming an increasingly popular
mode of transport, largely as a result of many cities and towns investing in
good, safe, and direct cycling paths that don’t compete with road traffic. In
some cases, using a bicycle may be quicker than dealing with traffic conges-
tion (and you can even buy or convert an electric bicycle; see the later sec-
tion “Variations on Manual Transport: Bikes with a Boost”).
If you plan to cycle to and from destinations, you need to do some planning.
Consider the following recommendations:
 Make route plans. Research the route you’ll use, looking for roads or
paths that are well-surfaced and wide enough to avoid conflicts with
vehicles.
 Inquire about bike storage at your destination. Before you roll up,
make sure that your destination has good bicycle parking, ensuring that
no one will take off with your two-wheeled transportation investment. If
you’re headed for the train or bus station, inquire at the transit company
about whether the trains or buses permit you to take the bike onboard
with you (some buses also have racks on the front of them to hold
bikes), or whether there’s secure storage available at bus or train stations.
If secure storage isn’t available, lobby for it.
 Seek out shower facilities (if needed). If you’re riding or walking and
know that you’ll work up a sweat, check that you have access to shower
and changing facilities. If your workplace doesn’t have these kinds of
facilities, talk to your boss about making them available and why you
think they’d make a difference to the work environment as well as the
wider environment.
249
Chapter 13: Choosing and Using Your Transportation Wisely

If you take up cycling to become a greener traveler, don’t forget to stay safe.
Make sure you have good lights and a bell or horn on the bike, and wear a
helmet and highly visible, reflective clothing. Motorists need to be able to see
you easily in the dark or in poor visibility. You also can make yourself com-
fortable on the bike with the right gear: padded shorts, gloves, windbreakers,
riding pants, and bike shoes, for example.
You may not have to buy your own bicycle if cities such as San Francisco,
Portland, and Chicago go forward with bike-sharing programs currently at
various stages of planning. The idea is that bicycles are available in racks in
certain locations, and you simply pick one up, cycle to your destination, and
drop it off at another designated rack. Early bike-sharing programs have run
into problems with theft, but deposit systems and electronic tracking are
helping to solve those issues.
Why not form a bike-sharing club of your own? Chip in with friends to buy a
bicycle, and take turns using it. Even it you only ride to work once a week,
you’ll be a greener traveler.
250
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
Improving your health with active transport
An overreliance on vehicular travel encourages
a couch-potato kind of lifestyle. Think about
how many times you could have walked or
cycled in the last week but chose to drive. Many
of your short trips, such as to the local park or
school or stores, may be within easy walking or
cycling distance, and walking is one of the best
ways to lose a spare tire (the one that your vehi-
cle isn’t equipped with!).
Vehicles are non-active forms of transport.
Active transport choices — such as walking
and cycling, using buses and trains, or even
trams and ferries in some parts of the country —
can have extremely positive health benefits. If
you walk a little bit as part of the journey to and
from work, you not only add valuable exercise
to your day but also do your part to reduce the
cost of maintaining the health system.
As you increase your physical activity every
time you decide not to use your vehicle, you go
a long way toward preventing cardiovascular
disease and reducing the risk of adult-onset
diabetes, osteoporosis, and obesity. People who
walk, cycle, or use public transport are on aver-
age seven pounds lighter than those who travel
everywhere by vehicle. And the recent phe-
nomenon of road rage suggests that driving
your vehicle less may also have psychological
benefits.
The risks involved in driving everywhere are
particularly important when children are
involved because children who grow up inac-
tive are more likely to be overweight and have
corresponding health problems. Apart from the
negative health aspects from physical inactiv-
ity, children who are accustomed to being
driven to school miss out on important life skills:
They may be less motivated to get out and find
their own way around; they may be unaccus-
tomed to navigating and feel uncomfortable in
public places; they may be less street-wise;
and, having less experience in personal road
safety, they may be at risk of severe accidents.

Variations on Manual Transport: 
Bikes with a Boost
Mopeds and small motorcycles are catching on, especially in cities, because
they’re so much easier to maneuver through heavy traffic and to park. They’re
well-suited to people who don’t have to travel far to work, shop, meet friends
and family, or who don’t need to transport any large, fragile objects.
When properly maintained, a motorcycle or scooter running on gas produces
far fewer greenhouse gases than a vehicle. So an increase in moped and
motorcycle use and a corresponding decrease in vehicle use is good news for
the environment.
Rain and snow can definitely put a damper on manual transport. You can
invest in wet-weather tops and bottoms to help you out if it’s raining (espe-
cially if you run into an unexpected shower), but for really bad weather or
slippery conditions, you may consider using public transportation as your
backup plan.
A step up from the everyday bicycle is the electric bicycle (you can see one
example in Figure 13-1), which provides the best of both worlds: You provide
the pedal power and the electric motor provides help up to 20 miles per hour
(it’s great for hills!). The electricity comes from a battery that can be
recharged for just pennies per charge by plugging into a regular wall outlet.
Depending on the model, the power assist either comes on demand (you use
a throttle on the handlebar to trigger it) or automatically (the bike gives you
power whenever you pedal). Brakes and gearing usually look very similar to
those on standard bikes.
You don’t have to buy an electric bike — you can convert a standard bicycle
to be electric powered with the purchase and installation of a conversion kit
(see Figure 13-2), which usually includes the battery, motor, mounting hard-
ware, and charger. If you’re handy, understand how your bike works already,
and don’t mind investing a few hours of your time, you can probably install
the kit yourself; otherwise, take everything to a bike shop or mechanic who’s
familiar with electric conversion kits like these.
Costs vary depending on the power of the motor and the model, but you can
expect to pay about $500 for a conversion kit and upwards of $1,000 for a
bike already equipped with a motor.

Avoiding travel altogether by shopping online
The Internet has had a major impact on trans-
portation: You can shop online at your conve-
nience for many of the goods that you don’t
need to go and see in a store, thus curtailing
trips to shopping centers. This is especially
important because most shopping trips are
made by vehicle.
Although shopping online can increase the
number of commercial deliveries by planes,
trains, and courier vehicles, the environmental
impact is lessened because vehicles deliver to
multiple shoppers instead of everyone driving to
the store individually. The other potential down-
side to increased online shopping is the impact
on the economic and social sustainability of
local stores; however, you still can shop as
locally as possible on the Internet. You may be
surprised to find that many of your local stores
offer online shopping through their Web sites.
One potential downside of online shopping is
the waste that can be generated when retailers
ship their materials; however, if you’re thinking
green, you can reuse or recycle much of it. For
example, you can reuse cardboard boxes and
interior packaging material such as inflatable
plastic or “peanuts,” and you can also recycle
cardboard and some plastic packaging films.
Consider writing to or e-mailing the retailer to
express your concern if you think that the items
are being overpackaged, and check Chapter 6
for more waste reduction tips.
Some of the most popular online shopping cat-
egories that reduce individual transport trips
include:
 Books and music: Amazon.com was one of
the first companies to popularize buying
music and books online. The attraction of
ordering from home is the greater choice
available online compared to what’s avail-
able at your local store.
 Perishable and nonperishable foods: Many
large supermarkets and specialist organic
food stores encourage online shopping, and
because most of the delivery services are
local, everyone benefits.
 Food delivery: From pizza to Chinese or
Indian food, if you’re in an urban area or
even a small town, you can likely have your
dinner come to you.
 Home furniture and electronics: Most large
retailers have online catalogs that enable
you to order and have your bulky purchase
delivered without lifting a finger.
 Anything and everything: Sites such as
eBay and Freecycle, which give people a
chance to sell or give away their own
goods, have given many items a second life
in new homes.
Warning: It’s essential to be very security con-
scious when shopping online. Stick to Web sites
and vendors that you know and trust; ensure
that you’re using a secure Internet connection;
never give out passwords or private information
in response to e-mails; and look for the locked
padlock on the bottom of the Web browser and
the “s” after the “http” in the address that indi-
cates the page is secure. Check the Federal
Trade Commission’s site at www.ftc.gov/
bcp/menus/consumer/tech/online.
shtm for more consumer information on online
shopping.

A number of companies manufacture and sell scooters, small motorcycles,
and electric bicycles. Many of the most robust two-wheeled models are pow-
ered by gas, but just as with traditional vehicles, an increasing number of elec-
tric mopeds and bikes are becoming available. The Web site www.electric-
bikes.com is a fountain of information on green two-wheeled transport
options (including bicycles, scooters, mopeds, and motorcycles) and retail-
ers, and www.bicycle-power.com has links to various sites that sell con-
version kits.
When You Need to Drive: 
Green-Enhancing Actions
Despite the environmental issues attached to vehicle usage,, it’s not practical
for everyone to simply stop using them — especially if you use your vehicle
as part of your job. Buying a brand new, fuel-efficient vehicle may not be within
your budget, either. (If it is, though, check out Chapter 14 before you buy.)
No matter whether your vehicle has the worst or the best fuel efficiency on
the block, there are ways to maximize your fuel efficiency. You can reduce
your fuel use and, in turn, your carbon emissions and other pollutants by
following these strategies:
 Keep up with maintenance in order to keep your vehicle on the 
road. Keep your vehicle well-maintained for as long as possible. There’s
no reason a vehicle can’t last 10 to 15 years or even longer; holding onto
a vehicle for a long time goes a long way toward reducing the number of
new vehicles that need to be manufactured.
Older vehicles pollute more heavily than newer, better-performing ones,
but regular maintenance and immediate repairs can reduce that pollu-
tion. Keeping the engine and the emissions system in good running
order and using the right grade of oil is especially important to cut fuel
consumption and reduce emissions; for example, a clean air filter can
improve fuel consumption by up to 10 percent alone.
 Pump up the tires. Underinflated tires increase fuel consumption by as
much as 3 percent, and they’re more likely to blow and cause an accident.
You also may want to buy tires that offer improved mileage.Warning:
Always check the recommended pressure for your tire and don’t 
overinflate them. 
 Travel lightly. Take anything you don’t need out of your vehicle to
reduce weight, improve your fuel consumption, and reduce emissions.
The same goes for roof racks and other items that increase wind resistance
254
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

and therefore decrease fuel efficiency. Take out weighty winter measures
such as sandbags when better weather means you no longer need them.
 Plan your travel. Consolidate your errands into one big trip rather than
lots of smaller ones. For example, drop the kids at school and then hit
the grocery store. Also consider talking to friends and family members
to see if you can combine trips or errands.
 Plan your timing. Avoid driving at peak times when you’re more likely
to run into traffic congestion that will keep you on the road for longer.
 Don’t idle. Switch off the engine when you’re stationary, and don’t rev
your engine when starting up the vehicle. An idling vehicle gives off 80
percent more pollution than one that’s moving! The U.S. Department of
Energy says that it’s more economical and causes less pollution to
switch off the engine and start it again if the vehicle will be stationary
for 30 seconds or more. In other words, no matter what you’ve heard,
255
Chapter 13: Choosing and Using Your Transportation Wisely
Deciding when to replace your vehicle
There comes a time in every vehicle’s life when
it no longer fits your needs — maybe it breaks
down too often or your kids are off to college
and you can get by with a smaller, more fuel-
efficient vehicle. But sometimes the right time
to replace your vehicle isn’t as obvious. Here
are a few points to consider as part of your
decision:
 Mechanical condition: Compare how much
the vehicle costs, or is likely to cost, per
year in repairs and maintenance given its
age. Is it in great shape for its age, or is your
mechanic telling you that you have seri-
ously expensive repairs ahead? If it’s the
latter, or if parts are becoming hard to find,
it may be time to let go.
 Suitability: Is it still the right vehicle for your
needs or your family’s needs? If you’re dri-
ving a sporty coupe but you need room for
car seats, replacement may be your best
option.
 Fuel efficiency: If you could switch from a
heavy drinker to a light sipper, how much
money could you save each year based on
the miles you usually drive in that time
period?
 Insurance: Check with your insurance com-
pany to find out the cost difference in insur-
ing your older vehicle and the newer
models that you’re considering. Although
insurance savings shouldn’t be the sole
factor in your decision, it could make keep-
ing the older vehicle more economical — or
if you’re considering a switch from a sporty
vehicle to a family-oriented one, the change
may be more cost-effective.
Reducing the decision to financial nuts and bolts
can remove the emotion from the choice . . . after
all, you may be surprisingly attached to what
others view as a straightforward combination of
metal and rubber. If you decide to replace your
vehicle and you’re not yet ready for alternative
fuels, at least choose the most fuel-efficient vehi-
cle that you can find. Find information about fuel
economy ratings at www.fueleconomy.gov
and www.consumerreports.org (on the
Consumer Reports Web site, enter “fuel econ-
omy” into the search box).

turning the vehicle engine off and then back on again uses less fuel than
idling longer than 30 seconds.
 Slow down. You use a quarter less fuel at 50 mph than you do at 70 mph.
Of course, the concept also applies to highway travel at lower speeds —
it’s better for fuel efficiency to drive the speed limit than to exceed it.
 Keep it steady. Avoid hard acceleration and heavy braking, which
increase fuel consumption. If you drive a standard transmission, shift up
to higher gears at about 2,500 rpm. On the highway, use cruise control
(and overdrive, if you have it).
 Go gadget free. Use your vehicle’s air conditioner and other electrical gad-
gets only when you need to because they can use up to 10 percent more
fuel. Keep the inside of your vehicle cooler with dash-mounted fans when
you’re driving or with reflective window shades when you’re parked.
256
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
Thwarting assumptions about a vehicle’s 
size and physique
It’s important not to judge a book by its cover:
Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, get a ton of bad
press for being hard on the environment, but
they’re not all bad. Some models are less harm-
ful to the environment than others, and most are
comparable to pick-up trucks and even mini-
vans when it comes to gas consumption and
emissions. Smaller vehicles, of course, are gen-
erally the most fuel efficient of all, but you
should always check the manufacturer’s fuel
economy rating (and check unbiased sources
such as consumer associations and state or
federal ratings, too, to confirm) for the vehicles
that you’re considering: Don’t simply assume
that smaller is always better. Also, look for a
vehicle with a good durability record; if it’s well-
made and has few repair issues, it’s likely to last
longer than other vehicles.

rom biodiesel to hydrogen fuel cells, a number of automotive technolo-
gies are currently in development in order to lessen greenhouse gases
and other environmental concerns; some have already made it off the draw-
ing board and onto the road in this process of evolution. Although it’s tempt-
ing to believe that one or more of these technologies is the silver bullet needed
to solve the climate change problem, the reality is that it’s important to con-
sider all the environmental implications of each — not just the emissions that
they do or don’t produce from vehicle exhausts.
Putting greener vehicles on the road needs to go hand in hand with reduced
vehicle use in order to make a real difference. Think of the solutions to green-
house gases and climate change in terms of layers: Applying one layer can
help, but applying a series of layers together is much more powerful. Although
you can’t make vehicles disappear, you can at least reduce their negative
impact by making green choices about how and what you drive and the fuel
you use, including renewable and cleaner fuels that are gaining ground.
Alternative Fuel Sources 
for Transportation
The United States government says that it’s working on protecting the oil
supply to ensure that the nation isn’t at the mercy of other countries when it
comes to keeping industry humming, homes heated, lights on, and vehicles on

258
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
the road. But the U.S. can’t reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the necessary
degree without drastically changing the fuel that it burns, and that includes the
fuel that powers your vehicle. In this section, we explore the current options
for vehicle fuel.
A new twist on an old fuel: Diesel
Diesel is a fossil fuel that, like gasoline, is created by refining petroleum. Both
diesel and gasoline engines in vehicles are known as internal combustion
engines, but it’s important to understand that there’s a big difference between
gas and diesel engines: The fuel in a gasoline engine is ignited by spark plugs,
whereas the fuel in a diesel engine relies on compressed air to heat the fuel to
the point where it ignites. This difference is the reason diesel and gasoline
aren’t interchangeable.
The exciting environmental twist on diesel involves options for producing the
fuel from non-petroleum sources such as soybean oils, vegetable oils, used
cooking oil, animal fats, and pulp and paper processing byproducts. These
alternatives burn cleaner because they don’t release the greenhouse gases
that petroleum-based diesel does. Another step forward for the petroleum-
based type of diesel is ultra-low-sulfur diesel, which drastically cuts the
sulfur emissions of conventional diesel.
This section looks at your options for using biodiesel or ultra-low-sulfur
diesel. Just remember that these fuels can’t be used in gasoline engines —
only in diesel engines that have been designed or converted to accommodate
the diesel variants.
Getting the government to help 
buy your car (indirectly, that is)
You may be able to get some government help
to cover the higher purchase price of energy-
efficient vehicles such as hybrid, diesel, elec-
tric, alternative fuel, and fuel cell models as they
become available. The tool here is federal tax
credits. Although the original tax credit program
for hybrid vehicles incorporated a phasing out
of the credits after the manufacturer had sold
60,000 vehicles — and some vehicles are either
on their way to reaching or have already reached
that figure — the government is considering an
additional program and may respond to con-
sumer and taxpayer demand, plus it has other
programs such as one for alternative fuel vehi-
cles. Keep an eye on www.irs.gov for details
about current and future tax credits on green
vehicles.

Burning biodiesel: Grease cars
You may have seen news stories about people who have adapted their diesel
engine vehicles so that they run on used vegetable cooking oil (often from
restaurants). That’s one form of biodiesel; the vehicles that use this as fuel are
often referred to as grease cars. If your vehicle has a diesel engine, you can
convert it to run on used cooking oil with an engine conversion kit, which
runs about $1,000 (installation usually costs another $2,000 to $3,000 if you’re
not mechanically inclined enough to do it yourself). Because the used cooking
oil needs to burn hotter than regular diesel fuel, the kit usually includes some
kind of fuel tank heater to boost the oil’s temperature before it hits the engine.
You can expect your engine to get about the same amount of mileage from
used cooking oil as it does from regular diesel — but without the greenhouse
gas emissions. As for sourcing used cooking oil, many people go to restaurants
to ask for the used oil and process it themselves (it’s not difficult), but services
are cropping up around the country that will do this processing for you.
For instructions on making your own biodiesel from vegetable oil, visit
biodieselcommunity.org. You also can find more information, including
sources of conversion kits and services, at www.greasecar.com.
Burning biodiesel: Commercially available options
Other forms of biodiesel, refined from soybean and vegetable oils (not from
waste cooking oil!), are processed and available commercially (as opposed to
the do-it-yourself nature of grease cars). There are already approximately
1,500 biodiesel fuel stations around the country, with more being added all
the time. These forms of biodiesel are either 100 percent biodiesel (called B100)
or a mix of biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel (such as B20, in which the
biodiesel constitutes 20 percent of the mix, or B5, in which the biodiesel 
constitutes 5 percent of the mix). Although you technically can use commer-
cially refined biodiesel of any concentration in any diesel engine without
needing a conversion kit, the reality is that many major vehicle manufacturers
won’t honor their engine warranties if you’re running biodiesel at concentrations
above B20 because of uncertainty about biodiesel’s effect on parts. Plus,
biodiesel needs warming or additives in cold climates because it gels at warmer
temperatures than regular diesel does.
The production of commercial biodiesel isn’t without its problems; one major
concern is with replacing food crops with biodiesel crops. There may be ways
around this concern, however, because researchers have had good success
with algae-based biodiesel fuel and boosting production efficiencies. If you
use biodiesel sources such as agricultural waste, of course, it becomes much
more renewable.
259
Chapter 14: Expanding the Green Vehicle Evolution

Even when you take into account the energy and emissions involved in pro-
ducing biodiesel, it’s still a lot better than burning fossil fuels: 41 percent
fewer emissions than diesel and 52 percent fewer emissions than gasoline.
For more information about access to biodiesel fuel, check out the state-by-
state listing of stations at www.biodiesel.org.
Using ultra-low-sulfur diesel
If you’re considering a diesel vehicle and you don’t want to go biodiesel, then
ultra-low-sulfur diesel is a reasonable option. As of 2006, federal law requires
the use of ultra-low-sulfur diesel in new diesel vehicles, so if you’re buying a
new diesel car, this is what you’re going to get. Petroleum-based diesel fuel
historically has had a high sulfur content, which not only is linked to health
problems but also creates problems within vehicle emission systems. The
bottom line is that diesel deserved its perception as a dirtier fuel. The ultra-
low-sulfur version, however, is refined to contain less than 10 percent of the
sulfur of regular petroleum-based diesel. Although regular diesel and even
ultra-low-sulfur diesel still come with the issues common to all fossil fuels
(carbon and particle pollution, for example), going ultra-low is a step toward
making the fuel a little healthier than it once was.
Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel is already available at many service stations around
the country. In fact, many now offer both regular diesel for older vehicles and
ultra-low-sulfur for new ones. If you already have a diesel vehicle, you need a
retrofit in order to use the new fuel, however: Talk to your dealer or your repair
shop to find out if one’s available for your vehicle model and how much it costs.
260
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
The not-so-great idea of using natural gas
Imagine filling up your vehicle with the same nat-
ural gas that’s piped into your home for heating
or operating your stove: You simply connect the
vehicle to a gas tap at home (or on the road), and
fill ’er up. When natural gas is compressed or
cooled, it becomes a fuel that you can burn in
vehicles (such as the Honda Civic GX). Because
natural gas burns much more cleanly and more
completely than regular gasoline, it drops green-
house gas emissions by about a quarter.
This sounds good, but natural gas is still a fossil
fuel! It’s not anywhere near a renewable form
of energy, although gas reserves are believed
to be larger than oil reserves. Natural gas also
isn’t nearly as clean as using electric or hybrid
vehicles, so it’s not considered a really viable
option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
to the point that they need to be lowered.

The promise and the problems: Ethanol
Ethanol is a form of alcohol, which is produced when the sugars and starches
in plants are fermented. The major controversy surrounding ethanol as fuel
involves the source of those plants: Using corn as the major ingredient comes
with major environmental problems, which we explain in this section. It’s much
better to go with cellulosic ethanol that’s produced from agricultural waste or
crops that don’t need the kind of high-quality land that corn ethanol does.
Some petroleum-based fuels already contain a small percentage of ethanol,
and these are fine to use in gasoline engines. Purer blends, such as the E85
described in this section, however, require the purchase of a flex-fuel car that
can accommodate both conventional gasoline and ethanol fuels.
Growing corn ethanol
If you want to get a good debate going between the alternative fuel industry
and environmental groups, mention corn ethanol. In the U.S., this fuel is made
primarily from corn (other areas of the world use sugarcane as a base instead).
Essentially, the corn is fermented and the resulting alcohol (ethanol) becomes
a replacement fuel for gas. One of the most common forms of ethanol currently
is known as E85, which means that it’s 85 percent ethanol.
Although you may think ethanol is carbon neutral because the corn absorbs
carbon dioxide as it grows, research has shown that the electricity required
to create ethanol seriously reduces the overall environmental benefit of burning
it as vehicle fuel. And then there’s the other major issue of replacing food
crops with corn ethanol crops. According to Co-op America (www.coop
america.org), the demand for corn ethanol increases corn prices, which
creates serious affordability problems for those who rely on corn as part of
their diet; plus, it’s using good agricultural land for fuel instead of food. Corn
in general — whether it’s used for food or fuel — is also a crop that requires
significant pesticide use, and a lot of it is now genetically modified. Given the
costs, most environmental groups want the country to move away from corn-
based ethanol rather than embrace it.
Vehicles that can burn ethanol as fuel rather than simply as an additive within
the fuel are known as flex-fuel vehicles because they can burn whatever’s
available: gas or ethanol. To find stations offering corn ethanol, visit www.
e85refueling.com.
Calling for wasted plant matter: Cellulosic ethanol
Like corn ethanol, cellulosic ethanol is produced via fermentation to create an
alcohol that can be used as fuel, but it comes from biomass rather than corn.
Biomass is plant matter that’s considered waste, such as corn stalks and paper
pulp, so it’s automatically more environmentally friendly than corn ethanol. It’s
261
Chapter 14: Expanding the Green Vehicle Evolution

also possible to create cellulosic ethanol from plants such as some grasses that
don’t require agricultural land to grow; they can be grown on marginal land,
which means land that isn’t in competition with food crops — again, this is far
more environmentally and people-friendly than corn ethanol.
Unfortunately, cellulosic ethanol isn’t yet commercially available, although
some manufacturing facilities are being built. A lot of government and industry
resources are being funneled into corn ethanol production, but you can help
the cause for cellulosic ethanol by letting the state and federal governments
know that you want resources to be focused on cellulosic ethanol as a more
ecologically and socially balanced alternative fuel — do this by writing or
e-mailing your government representatives.
A Different Means of Supplying Energy:
Hybrid Electric Engines
Hybrid electric vehicles work by adding an electric motor system to a gasoline
engine, thereby reducing the amount of fuel needed to run the vehicle. The
electric system’s battery automatically recharges as you drive through energy
provided by the gasoline engine and/or energy that’s released when you
brake. As long as there’s power in the battery, the vehicle automatically uses
the electric motor as power (either for extra power at higher speeds or to
run the entire vehicle at lower speeds). When there’s not enough electric
power available, the vehicle switches back to the gas engine.
262
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
Laying your two cents on the table
Increased demand for green vehicles will
become one of the most powerful influences to
encourage more manufacturers to create new
versions of their vehicles. Directing that demand
to truly renewable and practical energy sources,
such as the ones we discuss in this chapter, is
essential. Making available retail outlets for alter-
native fuels is also critical to ensure that these
technologies are easy for people to adopt.
A powerful way of supporting these efforts and
changes is to make your views known. Write or
e-mail your state and federal representatives to
let them know that this issue is important to you,
to the nation, and to the planet. You’ll find their
addresses on state and federal government Web
sites.

One problem with early electric vehicles was that they didn’t travel very far
before they needed to be plugged in and recharged. They weren’t practical,
and they didn’t catch on with many people because there was less enthusiasm
about environmental issues at the time. As technology has evolved, however,
they’re becoming increasingly practical. Add the growing concern for the 
environment, and auto manufacturers have responded with hybrid vehicles
that incorporate both gas and electric technologies and don’t need to be
plugged in at all. The best known hybrid is probably the Toyota Prius, but a
number of others exist, including the Toyota Camry Hybrid and the Honda
Civic Hybrid.
Hybrids are more expensive to purchase than their non-hybrid counterparts
(on average, the difference is approximately $4,000, but it varies by model),
but they reduce your gas consumption and therefore your greenhouse gas
and pollution emissions. When the vehicle operates on electric power, there
simply aren’t any emissions. Hybrids are already a strong alternative for
many drivers, and their popularity will only grow. (Take one out for a test
drive and prepare to be fascinated by the dashboard display that shows
where the vehicle is drawing power from and where it’s being generated.)
263
Chapter 14: Expanding the Green Vehicle Evolution
Vessels for energy, waves of the future? 
Hydrogen fuel cells
A lot has been written about hydrogen fuel cell
technology. Its advantages are huge because it
releases no emissions at all. Hydrogen is a
potential catalyst for energy for both utilities as
well as transportation, so we cover its promises
and complexities in depth in Chapter 3, where
we discuss the broader applications of energy
storage for mass use.
In terms of practical applications in vehicles,
several problems are holding up hydrogen:
 Hydrogen fuel cells are fragile, especially at
cold temperatures, which creates a prob-
lem for vehicle use on bumpy roads and in
northern climates.
 Hydrogen fuel cells are a considerably
more expensive technology than combus-
tion engines, which limits their affordability
for a wide range for consumers.
 A larger volume of hydrogen is needed to
get the same amount of energy compared
to gasoline, so currently the hydrogen
needs to be compressed, which in turn
takes more energy, lessening its eco-
friendly potential.
 Special refueling stations have to be built
around the country, adding to the cost to
introduce the technology.
The use of hydrogen fuel cells in vehicles is an
area of development that you’ll simply have to
watch. Researchers are working to overcome
its challenges, and it’s possible that technology
could reach the point where hydrogen fuel cells
can be implemented in the future.

Nowadays manufacturers are adding a twist to conventional hybrid electric
vehicles with a plug-in option. These plug-in hybrids still have both the gas
engine and the electric motor and battery system, but you also can plug them
into a power source. Why plug the vehicle in? Because it means that more power
can be stored in the battery system, increasing the amount of time that electric-
ity powers the vehicle. These vehicles aren’t yet on the road except as a few
demonstration prototypes because the technology requires a bigger battery
that’s proving problematic; researchers are working on technology to make it
more efficient.
Stay tuned to the issue of the plug-in hybrid, however, because the concept
has the capacity to drop emissions even lower than they already are. One of
the environmental keys to plug-in technology is ensuring that the vehicle is
plugged into the cleanest possible source of electricity. Power from an older
coal-fired plant isn’t nearly as green as power from solar or wind energy.
Watch for the Chevy Volt, which will incorporate plug-in technology. This
electric car is currently still at the concept stage and isn’t available for sale,
but you can find out more about it at www.chevrolet.com/electriccar.

Reconciling the Economic Benefits 
and Environmental Costs of Tourism
For many years in the recent past, local, regional, and national governments
around the world have focused on managing the economic good fortune that
visitors brings to their areas. In fact, the United Nations World Tourism
Organization (www.world-tourism.org) says that tourism can contribute
to poverty reduction, which they call an essential condition for peace, envi-
ronmental conservation, and sustainable development, noting the following
specific economic benefits of tourism:

266
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 
 It creates jobs and supports local businesses, which in turn
• Serves travelers
• Serves the country’s residents
• Generates significant tax revenues
The World Tourism Organization says that tourism is one of the major
export sectors for poorer countries and a leading source of foreign
exchange in 46 of the 49 countries that the United Nations considers the
world’s least-developed. Taking tourism away from those countries
would have a devastating economic impact on them.
 It can help countries support and protect their own culture and heritage.
In some African nations, for example, wildlife conservation has become
a major priority because governments have realized that visitors want to
see wildlife in its natural habitat. And in Cambodia, the ancient temple
complex of Angkor attracts visitors that pay an entry fee that helps to
support the protection of those temples.
Tourism also has educational value for travelers. This aspect is much harder
to quantify than the economical benefits of tourism, but the creation of a
world that’s sustainable for years to come isn’t possible without global edu-
cation. There’s nothing like seeing the highly endangered North Atlantic right
whale swimming free along the Eastern seaboard to make you want to do
everything in your power to protect its ability to raise its calves and swim in
safety. And when you make an effort to meet and sensitively interact with the
local people in areas that you’re traveling in — whether you’re in Arizona’s
Navajo country or Egypt’s Nile region — you can gain an understanding of
cultures that are different from yours and contribute to a sense of peace and
kinship around the planet.
Today, however, many people have realized that increasing numbers of 
travelers can have a potentially negative impact on both the environment
and local communities. Local economies can benefit hugely from some types
of tourism, and tourism provides some communities with their main source
of income. But tourism that isn’t managed sustainably and ethically can be
very damaging, bringing pollution, cultural exploitation, environmental
damage, and overdependence on tourism as a source of income. The World
Wildlife Fund (www.wwf.org), for example, says that the impacts of increas-
ing tourism in once remote parts of the world include the following:
 The ruin of coastal ecosystems, particularly plants and wildlife, due to
huge resort developments
 Greatly reduced water supply in various local populations due to water
use for hotels, swimming pools, and golf courses (in dry regions that
don’t see much rain)
 Altered nesting and migration patterns of bird and sea life as well as that of
land animals due to increased numbers of people traveling in ecologically
sensitive areas.

It’s easy to look at the negative effects of tourism and think that everyone
should just stay home. But that’s not really the answer because doing 
so would be a huge downfall for areas that badly need the income. A better 
solution — reducing those negative impacts without turning travelers away
from economically needy countries — is already in the works. Negative
impacts such as those covered in this section are causing the tourism indus-
try to develop standards that encourage greater responsibility by tour 
operators and travelers themselves.
Assessing What Green 
Travel Really Means
Although being seen as green is becoming more and more important to busi-
nesses within the travel industry as demand for sustainable travel increases,
organizations define green travel in different ways. No single certification pro-
gram or standard guides the way that businesses within the travel industry
describe themselves. That means that it’s up to you, the traveler, to assess
how green a particular business — a hotel, tour operator, or attraction, for
example — really is. Just because a business calls itself green, environmen-
tally friendly, or eco-aware doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s as green as you’d
like it to be.
Considering others’ definitions
As you research green travel options, you’ll hear destinations and trips
described in a variety of ways:
 Sustainable vacations are careful to avoid negative impacts on the 
environment and may or may not include a focus on local cultures.
 Ethical or responsible travel is sustainable but usually includes a focus
on treating the local people fairly and equitably. Much of the income
generated by tourism in the developing world never reaches the local
people; an ethical vacation ensures that the money you spend goes into
the local economy rather than to a multinational corporation.
 Geotourism is a term coined by National Geographic to describe travel
that encompasses natural, cultural, and economic sustainability for 
local cultures.
 Ecotourism is sustainable and ethical but in a natural environment.
There’s more on this increasingly popular type of travel later in this
chapter in the section “Embracing Travel that Makes a Difference.”
267
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

You’ll likely see terms such as eco-, ethical, green, and sustainable tourism
used to describe travel that’s environmentally aware. It’s up to you as a con-
sumer to go beyond the words, however, and research exactly what the travel
organization means by them. Ask the company about its environmental and
cultural policies, and examine the trips that it offers so that you can assess
whether or not the company actually lives up to its marketing materials.
Factoring in your own priorities
The greenest vacations are sustainable, ethical, and eco-friendly. If you want
to be truly green, make sure that your trip is as kind as possible to the envi-
ronment and benefits the local community and economy at your destination.
No matter how green a tour company or destination claims to be, the most
important factor is whether it meets your personal green standards. You can
consider a range of issues in deciding exactly what green travel means to you —
this is truly an opportunity to put your money where your heart is.
When determining green travel priorities, consider the following:
 Greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions
 Carbon offsetting programs initiated or offered by the tour company,
destination, or hotel
 Contributions to the local economy
 Protection of the local environment
 Conservation of wildlife
 Support to local, indigenous cultures
 The overall impact of travel to that region and whether it’s over-traveled
Embracing Travel that 
Makes a Difference
Plenty of travel is about relaxation and taking a much-needed break from
everyday work and family routines — and there’s absolutely nothing wrong
with that. A break in the routine can help you to recharge your batteries and
return home refreshed and inspired. If you’re looking for greener travel that
goes the extra mile, however, you can consider ecotourism and volunteer
vacations.
268
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

Both of these types of travel make a difference in the world. At its best, 
ecotourism helps to connect cultures and landscapes while actively working
to respect the environment. Adding a volunteer element allows you to 
contribute to local ecosystems or people — or both. This section takes a 
look at ecotourism and volunteering options that are available to travelers.
Discovering ecotourism
Do you want to learn more about the natural environment that you’re 
traveling to? An increasing number of destinations and tour companies are
offering ecotourism options to serve that desire.
Ecotourism is about doing more than simply enjoying your surroundings; it’s
about understanding them while making sure that your travel doesn’t affect
them negatively. Although it’s often associated with physical adventure, you
don’t have to be out on a ledge on a mountain climb or in the surf in a sea
kayak. More than anything, ecotourism is traveling with care and awareness.
This begins with understanding what ecotourism is and choosing an appro-
priate supplier and destination; then you have to travel in a green and
responsible manner.
What ecotourism is(and is not)
There’s a lot of confusion, even in the travel industry, about what ecotourism
is. Every company that offers a tour, accommodations, or service in unspoiled
natural locations like national parks, wildlife areas, beaches, lakes, and even
remote islands has the potential to claim that it’s an ecotourism company.
The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) (www.ecotourism.org) says
that ecotourism is “Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the
environment and sustains the well-being of the local people.” TIES believes
that ecotourism should
 Minimize impact
 Build cultural and environmental awareness and respect
 Provide positive experiences for both visitors and hosts
 Provide direct financial benefits for conservation
 Provide financial benefits and empowerment for local people
 Raise sensitivity to a host country’s political, environmental, and 
social climates
 Support international human rights and labor agreements
The European Travel Commission (www.etc-corporate.org) says that the
following characteristics apply for a trip to be considered ecotourism:
269
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

 The destination is usually an unpolluted natural area.
 The destination’s attractions are the flora and fauna and its entire 
biodiversity.
 The trip should support the local economy and its indigenous 
atmosphere.
 The trip should contribute to the preservation of the environment 
and promote the importance of conserving nature.
 The trip may include a learning experience.
As you can imagine, it’s not easy to achieve all these objectives, but demand
for ecotourism options is on the rise as travelers become more aware of their
impact on local environments and actively look for green vacation options.
Local communities also see ecotourism as a way to bring in travelers who are
willing to pay a bit extra if they know that their money goes toward saving
endangered species or conserving their natural ecosystems, for example.
Hitting the ecotourism hotspots
The first question you may ask when thinking of an eco-vacation is, “Where
should I go?” Of course, it’s best to travel locally if possible to cut down on
the damage caused by flying (see the later section “Deciding how you’ll get
there (and back)” for more on this damage), but there are many cultural and
economic advantages to traveling farther away, especially if local economies
benefit.
Internationally, a growing number of countries and regions are becoming 
popular ecotourism regions. Some of the most popular locations with an
increasing number of ecotourism attractions and services include:
 Africa: Kenya and Swaziland have become two of the most popular
hotspots. Their national parks, deserts, and forests as well as rich
wildlife and traditional culture (such as the Kenyan Masai tribe) make
them extremely popular places to visit but also put huge pressure on 
the tourism industry to make sure that the recent marked increase in
tourism is managed sensitively.
 Caribbean and Central America: Some of the fastest-growing ecotourism
spots in the world are beach and rainforest areas found in small countries
like the Dominican Republic, Belize, and Costa Rica. Costa Rica has become
one the most popular ecotourism destinations in the Americas thanks to
government support for tourism and the country’s unmatched variety of
rainforests, volcanoes, mountain ranges, and beaches.
 Europe: Although museums and historical sites immediately come to
mind, European countries offer plenty of ecotourism options, too.
Cycling and hiking holidays are especially popular.
270
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

 North America: The beautiful, extensive but increasingly overcrowded
national parks continue to attract visitors to North America, with Alaska
and Canada growing in popularity. Heading to some of the slightly less
popular but equally stunning parks spreads out the impact more equally.
 South America: Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru are high on ecotourism lists,
with the Amazon region in Brazil, the snow-capped volcanic mountains
and indigenous populations in Ecuador, and the Andes in Peru still the
dream destinations for many travelers.
 Southeast Asia: Indonesia and Thailand are the most popular destinations
in this region, with their rainforests and mountain ranges contrasting with
stunning beaches. An increasing number of ecotourists also are visiting
countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and Nepal — although even in Nepal,
garbage on the popular route toward Mount Everest has been a problem.
An increasing number of guidebooks highlight the attractions of these natural
parts of the world (check out the travel titles in the For Dummies series). You
also can type “ecotourism” into your favorite Internet search engine to find
plenty of ecotourism options.
Acting naturally: The seven principles of a no-trace trip
There’s no point using the services of a company that touts green vacations if
you have no intention of being an ecotourist. There are seven principles for
leaving no trace when you travel to natural areas. Here’s a quick rundown; 
for more details, head to the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics at
www.lnt.org:
 Plan ahead and prepare. This principle includes scheduling your trip 
to avoid times of high use, only visiting in small groups, and packaging
food and beverages to minimize potential waste.
 Travel and camp on durable surfaces. Choose ready-made campsites,
don’t alter a site to suit your purposes, and stick to existing trails. Walk
in single file, and avoid places where you can see that use is starting to
damage the area.
 Dispose of waste properly. If you bring it with you, take it away again.
For washing and cleaning, use biodegradable products.
 Leave what you find: Don’t take any rocks, plants, or other potentially
valuable artifacts with you when you leave an area. This includes any
wildlife items such as birds’ eggs and nests.
 Minimize the damage of campfires. Light a campfire only if permitted
by rangers or wildlife officials, and try to use established fire pits when
you do. Never leave a campfire unattended, and burn everything to ash
to be safe.
271
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

 Respect wildlife. Feeding animals or other wildlife can alter their natural
behavior, so just view them from a distance. Know what to do to reduce
your chance of encounters with potentially dangerous wildlife such as
bears and what to do if you come across them.
 Be considerate of others. Respect and give way to other people you
encounter on a trail.
It’s up to you to do your own research to be sure that the vacation you
arrange is as eco-friendly as possible. Don’t take the word of the company
you’re booking through; it may claim to meet all the ecotourism principles,
but the issue comes down to whether a self-proclaimed ecotourism company
is actually adding value to an area rather than having a negative impact. You
can’t take their word for it. Unfortunately, there’s no large-scale international
certification system for eco-vacations; instead, there are lots of different
labels, many of which are only relevant to specific countries and regions.
You can start your research with the organizations listed in the sidebar
“Digging for more details on green vacations.”
If your trip includes wildlife watching, ask about the operator’s Code of 
Conduct before you book. At minimum, it should include provisos to never
chase or interfere with wildlife in any way and to limit the time spent 
watching any one animal.
Volunteering on vacation
Is there a cause that’s near and dear to your heart — so much so that you’d
want to devote part or even all of your vacation to it? Whether you want to
help a homeless family build a house, assist in a remote archeological dig,
comb beaches for signs of plover nests, or clear trails in a storm-damaged
park, there’s a wealth of opportunities just waiting for you to choose from.
You’ll return from your vacation knowing that what you’ve done has made a
difference in the world. And there’s a very good chance that you’ll also gain
new skills and new friends at the same time. What more could you ask for?
You may not be able to change the world in a week’s vacation, but you may
change a little corner of it for someone. By making someone’s life better, you
may help to put them in a position to help someone else. The positive ripple
effect of your action could go on to produce even greater things.
Knowing what to expect
You really need to do your research before committing to a volunteer vaca-
tion. In many cases, you’ll be sharing fairly basic accommodations with other
volunteers in anything from tents to dormitories to local homes. (If you’re
housed in hotels, you can expect the cost of the vacation to be proportion-
ately higher.) You also should fully understand the level of physical strength
272
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

or stamina that may be required. Mentoring journalism students, for exam-
ple, may require specialized knowledge but little in the way of brute strength.
If you’re building rock retaining walls to protect against coastal erosion, 
however, you shouldn’t be surprised when someone points to a rock and asks
you to “lift!”
Find out how much assistance you’ll receive in getting to the volunteer site:
In many cases, you travel with other volunteers; in others, you travel alone.
Either way, you’ll likely be met at a transportation hub near your destination
by organizers who take you the rest of the way. Organizers may provide
cooked meals for you on-site, or you may be responsible for some or all of
your own meals. Knowing these details can help to ensure that your 
expectations are realistic — and met.
Most organized volunteer vacation opportunities ask you to pay for your trip,
including transportation, accommodation, and meals. Some organizations
also ask for a monetary donation as a portion of the trip fee in order to fur-
ther their work; they may ask you to provide this yourself, or you may have
the option of fundraising at home before you head out on your vacation.
Check your federal tax regulations: In the U.S. and Canada, charitable dona-
tions can be tax-deductible, so it’s possible that at least a portion of your trip
cost could be deducted from your taxes, depending on your income level.
Finding volunteer opportunities
If you already support a cause or a nonprofit organization or are interested 
in supporting one, inquire about whether the group organizes volunteer 
vacations. That’s a natural place to start. Otherwise, an Internet search on
“volunteer vacations” will produce hundreds of options. (Try narrowing
down the overwhelming results by refining your search with a geographic
destination or a skill; for example, you may want “volunteer vacations
Nicaragua” or “volunteer vacations trail building.”) These organizations also
can help:
 Charity Guide: www.charityguide.org
 Earthwatch Institute: www.earthwatch.org
 Global Volunteers: www.globalvolunteers.org
 Habitat for Humanity: www.habitat.org
 Wilderness Volunteers: www.wildernessvolunteers.org
 World Volunteers: www.worldvolunteers.org
If you have 27 months or more to spare for training and service, there’s
always the ultimate in volunteer vacations: the Peace Corps (www.peace
corps.gov). You could find yourself teaching English in Madagascar or helping
to develop small businesses in Peru — and that’s just to start.
273
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

Let the Decision Making Begin! What 
to Do Before You Start Planning
The greenest holidays are those spent at home enjoying the countryside
around you without traveling long distances and adding to environmental
damage. But traveling farther afield can have a great deal of value, too. It can
broaden your perspective on the world and even on your own life, helping
you to see world events and people in a more educated light, for example.
Travel also can help to build bridges between cultures, fostering understand-
ing and communication instead of conflict. And it can help you to break free
of patterns and habits that it’s time to let go of.
Whether you choose to stay close to home or head somewhere different,
focus on making every aspect of your vacation as green as possible. This
begins with making the decision about the type of trip you’re going to take —
whether it’s a simple vacation that you want to be as sustainable as possible
or you’re going beyond, into an eco-tourism experience, adventure travel, or
volunteer vacation.
Making your first decision: Who 
should plan the trip?
Your first step in planning green travel is to decide whether you’re willing 
and able to spend time researching the trip yourself or whether you prefer to
let someone else handle the details. Both options are entirely valid, and both
have advantages and disadvantages.
If you prefer to plan your own green travel, you’re in charge of all the deci-
sions and the bookings for travel, accommodation, and activities. You can
make the greenest possible choices at every step without having to explain
them to a travel agent or tour operator.
This does take time, however, and you need to understand the process of
travel — down to details such as how much time you’ll need to transfer between
airline or bus terminals, for example, and whether you’ll need to obtain visas
ahead of time for entry into the countries to which you’re traveling.
When you plan your own eco-vacation, you need to commit the time neces-
sary to research all these areas, but you’re rewarded by the fact that you’re
traveling your way, which can be as deep a shade of green as you want.
274
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

A travel agent or tour operator can take care of many details automatically
and may be able to suggest ideas for itineraries or destinations that you
wouldn’t find on your own. You need to make sure that the person you work
with understands your green travel priorities in order to ensure that the trip
you end up with is one that meets all your standards.
A third option is to combine the trip planning so that you plan parts of it and
a tour operator or travel agent helps you with other parts. In this arrange-
ment, the planning doesn’t overwhelm you but you still have a strong degree
of control. However you decide to plan your trip, make sure that you under-
stand your green priorities; they’ll help both you and any experts that may
be trying to assist you.
Finding green travel operators
Whether you’re heading for an art-filled city or a wildlife-rich forest, you may
not want to plan the entire trip yourself. To keep your trip green, find a tour
or travel business operator that’s as concerned as you are about the ethics
and sustainability of travel. This may require a little more research on your
part, but it will be worth it when you arrive at your destination and feel good
about the impact of your trip.
When you’re looking for green travel operators or vacations, begin with orga-
nizations that have developed certification programs or earned recognition
from them. Three great places to start include:
 Green Globe (www.greenglobe21.com), which offers a label based 
on the UN’s Agenda 21 sustainability principles. Green Globe provides
certification under four sustainability standards and includes all
tourism, whether it’s in cities or natural areas.
 Sustainable Travel International (www.sustainabletravelinter
national.org), which is a Colorado-based organization that offers an
Eco-Directory of businesses committed to sustainable travel. Many of
these business also have qualified for certification programs.
 The International Ecotourism Society (www.ecotourism.org), which
offers a huge range of information about ecotourism, including a Travel
Choice directory of members that have signed a code of conduct to
follow responsible ecotourism guidelines.
The organizations in the preceding list can help you locate certified or recog-
nized eco-friendly travel businesses. To feel confident that you’ve chosen ethi-
cal and sustainable travel operators (or perhaps to help you narrow down
your list of possibilities), be prepared to ask a lot of questions, including the
following:
275
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

 Have you qualified under any kind of environmental certification program?
 Do you have a written ethical policy for your business?
 How are you reducing waste in your operation?
 How are you conserving water and other natural resources, including
power?
 How are you minimizing damage to wildlife and marine environments?
 Have your hotels or other accommodations been built in an environmen-
tally friendly way?
 What percentage of your staff is local, and do you use local guides? Are
your wages fair?
 What percentage of produce is locally sourced?
 Which local initiatives to protect or support culture or the environment
do you support?
Make sure that you’re happy with the answers you receive. The individual
efforts of companies may differ depending on the part of the world that
they’re operating in, but you should feel comfortable that their ethical and
sustainable initiatives are both genuine and effective.
If you book through a tour operator, go with one that’s a member 
of Sustainable Travel International (www.sustainabletravelinter
national.org) or the Association of Independent Tour Operators (www.
aito.co.uk), which includes many international operators. Members of
AITO, for example, have to protect the environment and natural resources,
minimize pollution, ensure that local communities benefit from tourism, 
and also make sure that visitors respect local cultures and customs. Some
tour operators even give money to community projects in the countries 
they organize trips to. Always ask before you book.
Preparing for Your Trip
Planning your trip to ensure that it’s as green as possible takes a little time.
After all, you need to take into consideration where you’re going to go, how
you’re going to get there, where you’re going to stay, and how you’re going to
spend your time. The good news is that at every stage, you’ll find opportuni-
ties to reduce your carbon emissions, avoid environmental damage, support
local communities, and protect local wildlife.
In this section, we take a look at each of these issues, offering advice to get
you started. It’s important to spend that extra time researching your options
so that you choose wisely from the very beginning, helping to ensure that
you can relax and enjoy your travels because you know that you’re doing
everything possible to help the environment.
276
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

Choosing a location
Where you choose to go depends largely on what you want to do when you get
there — whether it’s meandering through museums, playing historian at arche-
ological sites, kayaking along a seacoast, or simply lounging by the pool. Some
things to take into consideration when you’re looking for a location are
 A destination (geographical area or individual resort) that supports envi-
ronmentally friendly principles, especially carbon emissions reduction
 A destination that supports democratic principles and fundamental
human rights for all people, including its own
 A destination that’s actively working to protect local plants, birds, and
wildlife
 A destination that values its own heritage and culture and is working to
educate visitors about both
Do some research into what life is like for the local people. Sure, you deserve
a bit of luxury when you’re on vacation, but in some of the most luxurious
vacation resorts, local people live well below the poverty line. You may 
not feel at all comfortable in a place where there’s a huge gap between how
you’re vacationing and how they’re living. If you think that may be an 
issue, try finding either a location where this isn’t so much of an issue or 
an alternative accommodation that gets you closer to the local culture.

Even if your vacation doesn’t take you outside the U.S., it’s worth remember-
ing that some areas fare better than others in terms of attracting visitors.
There’s nothing wrong with getting off the beaten path into less touristy
areas and spending your money there.
If a train tour or a cruise is in your future (meaning that you don’t necessarily
have one specific destination), research the company you’d like to travel
with before you book. Find out about their green practices, where they find
their staff, and what working conditions are like for the staff. For cruise ships,
you can also visit www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/default.htm for Vessel Sanitation
Program reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although
these inspections are targeted toward preventing disease, they can give you a
good idea about how seriously the ship’s crew and the cruise line take issues
such as the health and well-being of their passengers.
Deciding how you’ll get there(and back)
Until the middle of the 20th century when commercial air travel became
more of an option for regular folks, much of the traveling to and from chosen
travel destinations was done by train and boat. Now, with life getting busier
and busier, travelers often want to get there and back as quickly and as
cheaply as possible. Weekend getaways from the East coast to destinations
as far away as Europe are advertised, and the Caribbean seems to be just a
hop, skip, and a jump away from airports throughout the U.S. (which is 
particularly tempting during winter snow and rain!).
Air travel may be convenient, but it’s also one of the fastest growing sources
of greenhouse gas emissions. And because it releases many of those gases at
high altitudes — into the part of the earth’s atmosphere where they can do
the most damage — it does significantly more damage than other forms of
travel. Even long-haul flights, which are considered the most efficient flights
in terms of emissions per mile, still emit more greenhouse gases per 
passenger per mile than a small car does.
Add to those greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere the noise 
experienced by people living below the flight paths of planes and near busy
airports, and you can see why many experts think that air travel should be
reduced. Instead, predictions indicate that air travel is going to keep increas-
ing over the coming years — and that means more planes, more runways,
more airports, and more fuel. New, modern planes built using the latest tech-
nology are cleaner, less noisy, and more environmentally friendly than their
predecessors, but they still can’t counteract the effect of air travel’s growing
popularity. Fuel economy may be increasing, but total fuel consumption is
also increasing as more people choose to fly.
278
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

Getting there and back in an earth-friendly manner involves looking at alter-
native ways of traveling, including the train, which can open up new travel
possibilities. Going away for longer than the typical vacation and choosing
only one long-distance trip per year (instead of several trips) cuts down on
carbon emissions no matter how you travel.
In this section, we explain the benefits of the other transport options you
have as well as one way you can help offset the environmental costs of flying.
Boarding a train, boat, or bus rather than a plane
If you do nothing else to get greener on vacation, think about how to cut
down on the number of flights you take each year. The first question to 
consider when you decide you need a vacation is how far you need to travel.
Local vacations are the greenest, especially if you can use trains, buses, or
bicycles to get you there. If you have to get to the other side of the country
or even the planet to see friends and family, doing so without flying may not
be an option. But if you have the choice and can go somewhere closer to
home or use alternative forms of transportation, think about your options
before you book airline flights.
If there’s a choice between flying, driving, and taking a train or bus, go for 
the train or bus. Flying and driving are the most polluting options. When 
you let the train or bus take the strain, you can save three to seven times the
greenhouse gas emissions compared to taking a plane, depending on the
route you’re traveling. Of course, it’s difficult — even impossible — to avoid
driving to some destinations that aren’t served by public transportation. In
European countries, for example, the local train and bus networks are often
very good, but in North America, the long distances make comprehensive
networks much more challenging for transportation operators.
In the U.S., you can take wonderful vacations in which traveling by train,
boat, or bus adds to the enjoyment, or even becomes the reason for the 
journey. Scenic train trips, such as through the Rocky Mountains or along the
Pacific coast, give you a chance to relax, let someone else do the “driving,”
and simply enjoy the scenery. You don’t have to worry about your bags 
getting lost, and you get to see a lot of your home country.
Reducing the impact of flying
If you find that you have to fly, try to make the rest of your trip as green as
possible. Consider the following ideas:
 Try to take direct flights rather than those that make stops en route.
Taking off and landing use up more fuel than cruising at high altitude 
so a trip that includes a few hops costs you more in carbon emissions.
Keep in mind when you’re choosing flights that many low-cost airlines
fly via a third location rather than non-stop, so it’s less costly to the
environment to seek a different airline.
279
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

 Find an airline that uses newer model planes. Newer planes tend to
offer better fuel economy than older ones.
 Choose daytime flights. Studies have shown that the jet contrails (those
white lines of exhaust that streak the sky behind planes) can contribute
to warming the atmosphere because as they disperse they can trap 
heat radiating up from the earth. This is especially true at night because
during the day the contrails partially offset the heat trap effect by 
radiating light from the sun away from the earth.
 Pack light. Every pound of weight that a plane carries increases the
amount of fuel that it burns, so reducing your luggage weight actually
reduces your environmental impact — and it makes your luggage much
easier to carry, too!
 If you have a choice between economy class and business or first
class, choose the less comfortable (and less expensive) economy seat.
It makes sense from an environmental point of view because the more
passengers that an aircraft carries, the less fuel is burned per passenger.
When you choose an economy seat, you’re responsible for fewer emis-
sions than if you choose a seat in a roomier class of travel. (Although
each passenger’s weight costs the airline some fuel, there’s a huge fuel
cost in the airplane’s weight, and carrying more passengers distributes
this “fixed” cost among more people.)
 Purchase carbon offsets. These “shares” of sorts basically go toward
reducing the same amount of environmental costs that your trip
expends, and you can purchase these shares for driving as well as flying.
See the next section for more information.
Flying carbon neutral
As with any other aspect of being greener, every little bit helps. If you 
cut down on the number of flights you take each year, choose alternative
transportation whenever possible, enjoy holidays locally, and fly only when
necessary, you’re already doing a lot to help the environment. No matter 
how green you want to be, however, sometimes you really do need to take a
flight — especially because traveling to other areas of the world can help
improve economic conditions there.
To make up for some of the environmental damage done by each flight you
take, consider making the trip carbon neutral. This involves calculating how
much your flight generated in greenhouse gas emissions and buying a certificate
or “share” in a project that aims to reduce emissions by that same amount.
Many of these carbon offset programs or projects involve tree planting
because trees have a huge capacity to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.
They’re not the only choices, however; others involve everything from 
supporting solar and wind power to replacing fossil fuel–burning stoves 
in developing countries with more sustainable energy sources. There also 
are programs in which you pay for energy-efficient appliances or energy 
conservation schemes in developing countries.
280
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

Making your flight carbon neutral is certainly a positive step, but it doesn’t
solve the root problem of greenhouse gas emissions — the amount of flights
that you take. And there’s a limit to how effective carbon offsetting programs
can be; after all, there’s a finite amount of land on which to plant trees. 
It’s best to include the purchase of carbon offsets as one part of a personal
green living strategy that includes reducing flights, too, rather than as a 
complete solution.
A growing number of airlines and other travel businesses are providing 
one-stop shopping for carbon offsets, making it very easy to purchase them.
You can simply opt in at the time you purchase your ticket. (Some outfits
even include the carbon offset in the ticket purchase price.) Other organiza-
tions are making independent carbon offset programs available, which is an
excellent option if you have specific ideas about what you’d like to support.
For example, Sustainable Travel International offers a carbon offset program
for flights: You simply enter your departure and destination airport, and it lets
you know what the carbon dioxide emissions related to that flight will be and
how much it will cost to offset them. For example, a one-way flight between
New York and Paris produces 1.3 tons of CO2, which costs $20 to offset.
When you’re choosing a carbon offset provider, don’t be afraid to ask questions
or research the program’s background thoroughly.
Consider selecting a nonprofit organization to ensure that your money 
and support go to carbon offsetting programs rather than contribute to a 
business’s profitability. Also make sure that you’re supporting a program that
wouldn’t have been possible without the carbon offset scheme. Otherwise,
you’re not actually contributing an additional program; you’re simply paying
for something that was going to happen anyway. To make your purchase go 
further, look for programs that actually reduce the amount of carbon that’s 
produced in the first place rather than simply trying to take out what’s in the
atmosphere. For example, some programs are helping to make charcoal or
wood-burning cookstoves in developing nations more efficient — this not only
reduces the carbon that the stoves release but also helps to conserve a pre-
cious natural resource. Sustainable Travel International (www.sustainable
travelinternational.org/documents/op_carbonoffsets.html)
offers a selection of carbon offset programs that independent experts have
examined to make sure they meet criteria such as these. You also can find
excellent information and carbon offsetting programs at www.carbonoff
sets.org.
Figuring out where you’ll sleep
Whether you decide to spend some time in the world’s great cities or on top
of a mountain, check out the accommodation options carefully. In general,
staying in smaller, locally owned hotels, bed and breakfast (B&B) places, or
281
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

self-catering accommodation — essentially anywhere that’s not part of a big
offshore chain — means that the money that you spend on the accommodation
has a much better chance of staying in and supporting the local economy.
The greenest accommodations include the following:
 Campsites: They’re one of the greenest accommodations because they
reduce the amount of local power and water that you’re likely to use —
as long as you’re following low-impact choices; for example, you should
avoid burning local firewood in places such as Nepal where wood is a
scarce resource.
 Self-catering rooms or apartments: These are the next greenest options
because they allow you to buy and prepare local food and to control the
amount of energy you use.
You may find that the self-catering option is much less expensive than
other options, too. For example, a small apartment in Paris can accom-
modate an entire family very comfortably for a week at a cost far less
than a hotel room or two, and many Parisian apartments are within a
block or two of the Metro subway line.
Even if you’re staying in a more traditional accommodation, you can still be
green. Here are some options:
 Bed and breakfasts: They’re often in private homes where the owner is
also your host. You get a chance to enjoy charming rooms, delicious
breakfasts (often featuring local produce), and insider knowledge about
the local area.
 Hostels: This excellent option offers the company of fellow travelers and
plenty of local information and contacts.
 Hotels or motels: Many hotels and motels are incorporating green ele-
ments into their day-to-day operations. At their most basic, you should
expect an option for reusing towels rather than replacing them every
day and facilities for recycling items such as newspapers and beverage
containers. However, many hotels and motels have gone much further:
They may use their own renewable energy sources (including solar
panels, wind turbines, and even hydroelectricity), bore holes for water,
have water-saving devices, be decorated with local art, feature environ-
mentally friendly and recycled materials in their décor, and use local
produce in their kitchens (some hotels even have their own herb and
vegetable gardens).
When you find a place that you think fits the bill, don’t hesitate to call and
ask about its green elements, or ask your tour operator for the details. You
should know anything that indicates how well an accommodation treats its
staff and whether it employs local people at fair wages.
282
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

When you’re choosing somewhere to stay, be sure to check its location care-
fully. The ideal place is somewhere you can get to from the airport or train sta-
tion without having to rent a car and somewhere that’s close to everything you
want to see so that you can walk, cycle, or use public transport to get around.
You may find the following Web sites worth a visit before you book some-
where to stay:
 www.allstays.com lists green resort, hotel, and B&B accommodations
around the world.
 www.specialplacestostay.com includes a guide to green places 
to stay.
Planning what you’ll do while you’re there
The first step when planning the day-to-day experience of a green vacation is
to find out as much as possible about your destination. (You’d be surprised
at how many people don’t know very much about a place before they arrive.)
Knowing what to expect during your vacation can make a huge difference in
how much you enjoy it. Consider researching some great local cafés to try,
for example, or the best (and most sensitive) wildlife watching locations.
Research really pays off when it comes to what you do while traveling. Hit
your favorite Internet search engine and enter your destination along with
“travel,” “tourist bureau,” or the name of an activity you’re interested in.
These searches may well lead you to Internet chat rooms or forums where
you can communicate with people who have traveled there before you. Of
course, if you know people who have been to your destination, you can talk
to them in person, too!
Consider checking traditional print sources of travel information. Buy travel
guidebooks about your destination (or borrow them from your local library).
Many offer detailed information about places to sleep, eat, and play, and
travel magazines such as National Geographic Traveler, Islands, and Arthur
Frommer’s Budget Travel can be invaluable sources of information and 
inspiration when you’re planning your trip.
It’s great to build in time for spontaneity when you’re traveling and not to be
so committed to your plan that you miss what could be a delightful side trip
or a relaxing afternoon on a secluded beach, for example. But a little advance
planning can go a long way when it comes to getting the most from your
green travel.
283
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

When in Rome(or Zambia, or 
Costa Rica, and So On) . . .
From cultural sensitivities to supporting local economies, when it comes to
travel, there’s a lot of truth to the saying “When in Rome, do as the Romans
do.” It’s important to realize that when you travel, you’re a guest in a commu-
nity that’s not your home, and so you have a responsibility to be the best
possible guest you can. This not only includes green travel principles such as
minimizing your energy usage but also connecting with the local people in a
positive way, to enrich both your experience and theirs.
When traveling, don’t forget to stick to the same green principles you use at
home. Switch lights and appliances off at the wall when you’re not using
them; dry clothes in the fresh air rather than send them to the hotel laundry;
use a solar-powered cellphone charger (check outdoor equipment stores,
cellphone retailers, or type “solar cellphone charger” into a search engine to
get your hands on one of these gems); stick to marked paths and trails to
save wear and tear on the countryside; find local recycling facilities and 
recycle your bottles, cans, and glass; and take your garbage away with you.
Respecting the local people
A good green vacation involves some cultural sensitivity. You make less of an
impact when you at least try to fit in, and the best way to get to know a place
is to try to do what the locals do. Start by researching the traditions and 
customs of the local people at your destination. Knowing these things ahead
of time can help you to be sensitive to their culture while avoiding potentially
embarrassing mistakes. Here are a few suggestions:
 If English isn’t the primary language at your destination, invest in 
a conversational language class as part of your trip preparation.
Knowing how to say “hello,” “please,” and “thank you” goes a long way
to improving your welcome. (Not only will the local people appreciate
the effort you’ve made, but knowing basics such as “left,” “right,” and
“the bathrooms are that way” can make or break a day on the road!)
 Dress appropriately. A good guidebook will give excellent advice 
about what to wear and, more importantly, what not to wear. Generally,
dress as modestly as the local people do. For example, avoid skimpy or
revealing clothing in conservative countries, and cover your shoulders
and choose skirts or trousers when visiting religious buildings.
 Always ask before taking photographs, and beware of taking pho-
tographs or videos in sensitive areas such as near military or 
transportation facilities. Many countries take a dim view of potential
espionage activities!
284
Part IV: Thinking Greenly on the Road 

 Respect sacred or private sites by asking permission to enter and 
by following local customs such as removing shoes and wearing 
headscarves.
 Check into local tipping customs so that you know what to expect 
and can avoid giving offense to restaurant staff and other service
providers. Tour operators, guidebooks, and local tourism offices can
provide tipping information.
 Buy the local newspaper and tune in to some local radio and TV.
Even if you don’t understand a word, the pictures and sounds give you 
a surprisingly good idea of local life.
 Find out about the local environmental issues. After all, you are on a
green vacation, and you may need to conserve water and energy, 
particularly in many remote or developing parts of the world.
Supporting local economies 
and communities
Whether you’re on vacation in a big bustling city like Rome or in a tiny village
in Patagonia, make sure that your money supports local businesses and 
communities. When you get there, do your part by
 Eating in local restaurants that buy their food locally: Eating local pro-
duce reduces the distances that your food has to travel (see Chapters 8
and 10) and supports the local farmers and economy. And besides,
there’s nothing more delicious than dining on fresh fish straight from the
fishing boat (at some beachside restaurants, you can even watch the
boats come in) and meat and vegetables from the local farmer.
 Getting around using local public transport, walking, or renting bikes
instead of vehicles (when possible): If you’re energetic and you love 
the outdoors, you can even base your entire trip around a favorite self-
powered activity, such as hiking, biking, horseback riding, or kayaking.
All these options — from the fare you pay on the local bus to the cost 
of your bike, horse, or kayak rental from a local supplier — support the
local economy.
If you need to drive, rent a fuel-efficient hybrid car (many of the major
rental agencies, including Hertz, Avis, and Enterprise Rent-A-Car have
added them to their fleets), or choose the car that has the best fuel
economy rating (this is often the smallest possible vehicle that suits
your needs). Always try using a local rental agency first.
 Using local guides: Many areas have local training or certification 
programs, so always look for qualified guides. Locals also provide great
insider information about the place you’re visiting.
285
Chapter 15: Becoming a Green Traveler

 Buying locally made crafts and products: Avoid large tourist shops 
that make cheap copies or that sell products imported from elsewhere.
(The “Made in China” label only looks good on something that you’ve
bought . . . in China.) Try local marketplaces instead. Although it can be
fun to barter (once you get the hang of it!), avoid being too aggressive —
and always retain your sense of humor!
 Supporting local projects: Devote either funds or some of your time (or
both!) to projects such as health clinics, schools, or other appropriate
causes.
 Buying food from local markets and shops: If you see a line of local
people outside a shop, find out what it’s all about, and join in. (The only
caveat here is to refrain from buying certain commodities that are in
short supply locally; you don’t want to further restrict supply, which can
drive up the price for local people.)
 Visiting the local cafés and bars rather than remaining in the hotel or
tourist areas: Just be sure that the local areas are considered safe for
visitors before you go wandering into them. (Being mugged is a surefire
downer when you’re on vacation.)
286

The pledge for promoting peace through tourism
The International Institute for Peace Through
Tourism (www.iipt.org) offers a wonderful
and thoughtful credo for the peaceful traveler
that sums up the beauty of enlightened green
travel. Consider these thoughtful words as you
plan and experience your green vacation:
 Grateful for the opportunity to travel and
experience the world and because peace begins
with the individual, I affirm my personal respon-
sibility and commitment to:
 Journey with an open mind and gentle heart
 Accept with grace and gratitude the diver-
sity I encounter
 Revere and protect the natural environment
which sustains all life
 Appreciate all cultures I discover
 Respect and thank my hosts for their 
welcome
 Offer my hand in friendship to everyone 
I meet
 Support travel services that share these
views and act upon them, and
 By my spirit, words and actions, encourage
others to travel the world in peace

Implementing Ideas for a Green
Working Environment
In This Chapter
 Discovering the mutual benefit of green businesses and the environment
 Targeting green business travel
 Cutting back on office waste and electricity usage
 Making your business both green and ethical in the community
A
sk not what your company can do for you, but what you can do for your
company! Like most people with green on the mind, you probably want
the organization for which you work to be more environmentally aware, but
you may feel that it’s challenging to make your workplace greener. Part of the
problem is that workplace methods and routines are established before you
come onboard as an employee — and getting those methods and routines
changed, especially in larger organizations, can be quite a process. You may
feel that you don’t have enough control to effect change. This chapter tells
you that you can make a difference (and how), so don’t give up.
Greening your workplace just takes someone — you — to monitor the 
eco-friendliness of your working environment, to come up with solutions to
enhance it, and then to talk to the powers that be about the best ways to
change things. You may find that you’ve added to your workload because you
get the job of implementing the changes, but at least you know that you’re
doing your part to make your work environment a greener place.
Realizing the Importance and 
Gains of Corporate Greening
You can do a great deal for the environment by changing your habits at
home, so it’s not a huge stretch of the imagination to see how those changes
can do even more for the environment when they’re applied where you work,

too. Whether the business employs a handful of people or hundreds, each
individual green practice — from switching off the lights at night in order to
reduce energy consumption to instituting a recycling system — reduces the
impact of the business on the environment. Even better, when employees
who aren’t green at home see how easy and beneficial it is to implement 
environmentally friendly practices, they may take some of those tips and
techniques home with them.
How businesses affect the environment
Think about how your home affects the environment: There’s the energy 
that you use to heat and cool it, the products that you bring into it, and the
waste that you produce. Businesses are no different from homes except that
because they’re larger than a single home and a single family, they can affect
the environment either positively or negatively to a much larger degree.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), industrial 
and commercial energy use (from such sources as electricity use, product
transportation, industrial processes, burning fossil fuels to power boilers 
and produce steam, and using gasoline to power vehicles) accounts for
nearly 30 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
The good news is that by 2009 — and possibly even earlier — companies 
in the U.S. will have reached the tipping point where they move from being
mostly uninvolved with green practices to being mostly involved with 
them. This prediction is one result from a 2006 study for Siemens Building
Technologies and Siemens USA that talked to corporate leaders across the
nation. Some two-thirds of these leaders also saw green building practices as
financially beneficial and green practices in general as reducing overhead
costs. More than half even saw “green” as a way to foster innovation within
their companies.
Following are some specific examples of ways in which the working world
damages the environment; some may seem obvious, whereas others may 
surprise you:
 Heating and air conditioning systems pump greenhouse gas emissions
from offices into the atmosphere and use up vast amounts of electricity.
Many buildings aren’t designed to include energy efficient designs or
technology to reduce the amount of heat and air conditioning they use.
 Many buildings are built from materials that don’t come from renewable
sources.
 Office buildings have a huge appetite for electricity to power lighting, 
air conditioning, computers, printers, and photocopiers. Equipment may
be left on 24 hours a day, seven days a week — even when no one’s
working.
290
Part V: Creating a Green Society 

 Offices consume vast amounts of paper. Even with more offices recycling
paper, a large amount of paper waste still goes to landfill sites or 
incinerators.
 In addition to paper, offices produce a lot of other waste, including 
equipment (especially computers), because companies regularly upgrade
their equipment to stay competitive. Electronics such as photocopiers
and computers can end up in landfills, where they don’t break down and,
even worse, can leach harmful chemicals into the ground and water.
 Rush-hour traffic jams in towns and cities are full of people trying to get
to work — wasting time and polluting the atmosphere.
How corporate greening 
benefits businesses
Keeping a business as green as possible has benefits for the business as well
as the environment. In addition to the specific benefits that we cover in this
section, taking preventive measures to protect the environment saves the
costs of expensive cleanups when things go wrong. Plus, the environment
messages sent out at work spread and multiply and therefore have a larger
positive effect.
In today’s business world, companies are more willing to make eco-friendly
changes because the companies know that
 They can achieve savings in energy costs. Recycling, energy conserva-
tion, energy-efficient office equipment, and water-saving devices all save
money by cutting bills.
 They don’t have to spend a lot of money to make changes, and often
changes actually save the business money. The “reducing consumption”
part of being green can cut overhead expenses significantly. For example,
printing on both sides of paper doesn’t cost a business anything and can
cut paper supply costs in half.
 They can improve staff productivity. Getting employees involved in
making the business greener and the office and other workplaces more
energy-efficient makes them feel like part of the team and motivates
them. Greener workplaces also are likely to be healthier and safer, which
means that the company loses less money through staff sick time.
 Becoming known as a green firm can be attractive to potential employ-
ees. Being green means looking after people as well as the environment,
and being green may give your company the edge in attracting the 
best staff.
291
Chapter 16: Implementing Ideas for a Green Working Environment

 Introducing telecommuting can cut costs and make staff happier.
Employees working from home can reduce employer costs such as park-
ing and make it easier for employees to manage family issues, thus 
reducing their stress. For more benefits, see the section “Telecommuting”
later in this chapter.
Making a Difference without 
Souring Your Reputation
If you telecommute or work for yourself, you have control over how green
you are in your own workspace. If you have to work in an office, however, you
have to take your green principles with you and work on making them part of
the work culture.
Simply talking to your work colleagues about green issues and how to reduce
the impact you have on the planet can create a positive effect. But then you
have to take action. Get together with colleagues to discuss ways to change
things, and then go to your supervisor with your suggestions. Being green
can cut business costs (see the preceding section for specifics), and if you
present it as a cost-cutting exercise from the beginning, you may well get the
higher-ups onboard.
Change has to come with commitment from the top, so in order to get your
supervisor on your side, keep in mind that employers don’t want you to
come to them with only problems — bring solutions too. Your boss may not
have the time or knowledge to come to grips with any shortcomings in the
greenness of the building and workspace and is likely to welcome your help.
292
Part V: Creating a Green Society 
Applying green principles to 
your own small business
When you create a business — whether it pro-
vides eco-vacations or is an office-based call
center, organic farm, beauty salon, or building con-
tractor — you can apply environmentally friendly
policies such as those covered in this chapter.
Write your green principles into your business
plan, and review them periodically to take into
account new technology that can improve things
and cut your costs further. Also make your employ-
ees responsible for certain aspects of your green
policies so that the green ethos becomes part of
the work culture.

For help convincing your workplace to change, check with your state to find
out if an advisory program is in place. The program may be able to suggest
easy ways and even offer financial or tax incentives to help your organization
go green. Sustainable Development International Corporation offers good
examples and tips about greening your workplace or business at www.smart
office.com, as does the EPA at www.epa.gov/epahome/workplac.htm
(click on In An Office or Worker Health and Safety for more specific
resources).
Encouraging Green Business Travel 
to Cut Costs and Reduce Impact
Think about all the employees heading to work and home every single day 
of the week. If businesses made an effort to reduce their employees’ need 
to commute — and their need to travel on behalf of the business — the
change could make a significant impact on the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted by the employees. Green businesses can try various initiatives, 
from telecommuting to encouraging the use of public transportation or car-
pooling. The bottom line is that so much can be done to reduce the impact 
of business travel.
Telecommuting used in conjunction with workplace travel plans that 
encourage use of public transport, walking, cycling, car-sharing schemes, 
and workplace parking restrictions has real potential for getting employees
to leave their cars at home. Check with local governments and the EPA
(www.epa.gov) to find out about green workplace incentives.
Telecommuting
Telecommuting is a system in which an employee or contractor connects to
work via a computer from home or another remote location, thus reducing
that person’s need to physically commute to work. Thanks to technological
advances, telecommuting is a growing phenomenon: According to the U.S.
Census, the number of workers who worked at home in 1980 was 2.2 million.
By 1990, it was 3.4 million, and by 2000, it was 4 million (or 3.2 percent of the
workforce). The real figures are likely even higher because the census data
involves those who “usually” work at home. Because many companies tend
to offer telecommuting on a part-time basis, with employees working from
home one or two days a week, other studies have pegged the telecommuting
figure as high as 18 percent of the U.S. workforce.
If there’s no telecommuting in your office, it may be that supervisors haven’t
considered it as an option. If they have, they may have chosen not to pursue
it because they don’t believe it fits their business model. For example, a 
293
Chapter 16: Implementing Ideas for a Green Working Environment

company that relies a great deal on employees meeting face-to-face with each
other or working together on projects may be reluctant to have employees at
home; the perception could be that the employees would be less available for
meetings and that workflow would suffer. In some cases, this position is a
holdover from previous management styles that emphasized a greater degree
of control over an employee’s workday. Companies that emphasize a 9-to-5
time-clock approach rather than rely on employee productivity also may be
reluctant to try telecommuting.
If you’re interested in a telecommuting arrangement, create a plan explaining
how it would work for you, and use the arguments in this section to help 
win over your supervisor. Consider researching technology applications such
as Internet-based meeting software that uses video cameras to link everyone
or other teleconferencing methods to help address potential management
concerns.
The pros and cons of telecommuting
Telecommuting has benefits not only for the employer and employee but 
also for the community and the environment. The main selling point from an
environmental point of view is that it cuts down the number of car trips made
between home and work during weekday rush hours. Traffic congestion and
air pollution are reduced as well as fuel consumption.
Telecommuting is attractive for both employers and employees for a variety
of other reasons as well. They include the following:
 You may be more productive. Working from home may allow you to
concentrate better on your job because you don’t have to deal with
workplace distractions such as people dropping in on you.
 You feel trusted by your boss. When your supervisor allows you to
work from home, he sends a clear message that he trusts you to get 
the work done no matter where you are. When you feel trusted, there’s
often a reciprocal effect in that you want to make sure you continue to
deserve that trust, so you make sure that you’re productive.
 You may get the flexibility to look after anyone at home who needs
help during the day, such as older children or elderly parents.
Although not all telecommuting arrangements are this flexible (some
may require your availability during normal work hours even if you’re at
home), some may focus instead on simply making sure that your work
gets done on time, thus giving you more control over how you spend
your time.
 Companies can cut their overhead because they don’t have to cater 
to the needs of all employees five days a week. If some of the staff
telecommutes several days a week, the business can reduce the number
of desks, the sizes of offices, the amount of stationery, and the amount
of parking available.
294
Part V: Creating a Green Society 

 Telecommuting gives job opportunities to a greater range of people.
If you’re the principal caregiver for children or other relatives, or if you
can’t physically travel to work, telecommuting may allow you to become
part of the workforce.
Telecommuting isn’t right for everyone, however, and it can have its disad-
vantages. Before you approach your supervisor with a telecommuting plan
for yourself (or others), consider the following cons:
 Some people don’t have the discipline and personality to be as pro-
ductive at home as they would be in the office. It may turn out that 
you face more distractions at home than you would in the office, such as
little personal things that you can’t get out of your mind until you attend
to them. And if you have young children at home, be prepared to pay for
a babysitter: It’s almost impossible to be both parent and office worker
when the kids need constant attention.
Any telecommuting plan needs input from supervisors to make sure that
employees are available (by phone and e-mail, for example) as needed
and that the work and productivity goals are clearly set out.
 If you’re working from home most of the time, you can get left out of
the loop. It’s one thing to avoid all office politics; it’s much less satisfy-
ing to miss out on the camaraderie, spontaneous outings for coffee, and
general praise when all’s going well. On days that you’re working in the
office, be sure to stick your head around the door often enough so that
you don’t get forgotten! Supervisors also need to make an active effort
to include telecommuters in social activities and perhaps make special
arrangements to have everyone together at certain times to help build
team spirit.
 If your office is one in which face-to-face team meetings are essential
and required on a daily basis, telecommuting may not be practical.
In this case, you may examine the way the business works and offer 
an option that makes telecommuting possible, say, one day a week for
employees (by refraining from scheduling meetings on Fridays, for 
example).
 If your business requires employees to use highly specialized equip-
ment or be part of manufacturing processes, telecommuting may not
be possible. Telecommuting tends to work best for employees whose
work is computer- or telephone-based rather than those involved in
such work as product manufacturing or repair. In the latter cases,
employees need to be on-site in order to do the work.
Requirements for successful telecommuting
Not everyone can telecommute for practical reasons. Many people have 
to be on-site so that they can be involved in meetings, have access to the
right equipment, or serve the public. The most suitable candidates for
295
Chapter 16: Implementing Ideas for a Green Working Environment

telecommuting are employees who produce generally self-contained pieces of 
work — project work and policy analysis, research, planning, and writing, 
for instance. Telecommuters need to be able to
 Work without supervision
 Be productive and happy without social interaction with workmates
 Motivate themselves
 Maintain a trusting relationship with their supervisors
If you have the job, personality, and discipline for telecommuting you 
also need
 The right computer equipment: Telecommuting is much easier with a
computer that enables you to access everything at work as if you were
there. Many companies that offer telecommuting also offer technology
such as laptops for their employees to use at home. The laptop can
replace the computer that an employee uses at the office, too, becoming
a kind of portable office for the employee. Other employers come to an
arrangement with their employees that, in order to telecommute, the
employees provide their own computer equipment (if you’re in this 
position, you may be able to claim a partial or full tax deduction for the
computer because it’s a work-related expense; check with the IRS at
www.irs.gov for details).
If you’re putting together a telecommuting proposal, consider approach-
ing your company’s IT department or specialist to find out what’s
required from an equipment standpoint, but get your supervisor’s per-
mission before approaching IT. If you’re not sure that your supervisor
will support your proposal to telecommute, you may need to ask an 
outside specialist about options, being careful not to reveal your 
company’s name.
 A suitable home office environment: You need a setup that enables you
to divide your home and work life. Ideally, you have a separate room
with a desk, an office-style chair, good lighting, no outside distractions,
and room for office equipment like a printer.
 A telecommuting agreement: You and your supervisor need to agree on
and outline (in writing) your working time, whether you need to log on
and off the network at a certain time, when you communicate with the
office, and whether you can claim any expenses (computer and printing
costs, paper, coffee, and so on).
Carpools and other travel-reducing ideas
Because telecommuting isn’t always practical or possible, it’s worth consid-
ering other ideas to reduce the number of vehicles that are on the road to
296
Part V: Creating a Green Society 

your workplace every day and to reduce the impact when workers need to
travel on behalf of the business. Changes in this area can go a long way
toward helping your company cut down on the greenhouse gas emissions
that it’s responsible for.
Consider these tips for carpooling and other travel-reducing strategies. You
may be able to implement some of them yourself; for others you may need to
obtain management approval:
 Set up a carpool program so that employees can make arrangements
to commute together. This could be as simple as making an arrange-
ment with a limited group of colleagues or as complex as inviting all
company employees to take part (which would involve having someone
set up the program and operate it).
 Request that space be set aside in the parking lot for secure parking
for bikes, and request shower and locker spaces so that people can
cycle in.
 Suggest the use of videoconferencing and teleconferencing facilities
in order to cut down on travel to meetings.
 Arrange to travel by train rather than plane if you have to travel.
Journeys by public transport such as trains and buses are responsible
for fewer carbon emissions than trips by car. (Flying is the most environ-
mentally damaging way to travel; see Chapters 14 and 15 for more info
on transportation options.) When you take into account the time spent
with airport check-in, security checks, and luggage collection, you may
find that public transport doesn’t take up any more of your workday
than air travel.
Reducing Office Waste
To make your workplace greener, you can use the same green principles 
and methods as you do at home, particularly when it comes to waste. It goes
without saying that paper is by far the greatest waste product in business
environments. In this section, we suggest ways of reducing waste of all kinds
in your workplace.
Going paperless
Back in the 1970s, people were excited by the idea of the office of the future
in which technology was so advanced that no one needed to use paper. If you
look around your office today, you probably see reams of paper for photo-
copying and printing and desks piled high with papers. As pervasive as they
are, the Internet and e-mail don’t seem to have helped reduce the amount of
297
Chapter 16: Implementing Ideas for a Green Working Environment

paper used in the typical office. People send e-mails and then print them off
so that they have paper trails, or they e-mail reports and then send out hard
copies, too. It seems that the more advanced technology has become, the
more demand there is for paper.
From a green perspective, reducing the amount of paper you use is key. Paper
is originally produced from trees, which are a declining natural resource.
Wasted paper means that not only the wood is wasted but also the chemicals
and energy that went into processing the paper. More paper is being recycled
than ever before, but even the process of recycling paper uses energy that
can be saved if less paper is used in the first place. (Don’t get us started on
the amount of steel saved by reducing the number of paper clips used to hold
paper together!)
Even though a completely paperless office may be unrealistic, technology
allows you to greatly reduce the amount of paper you use at work. Only 
use paper when it’s absolutely necessary, such as for tax and government
regulation compliance issues. Otherwise, use the technology that’s available
to you. Here are some simple suggestions for cutting back on paper usage
and putting gadgets to good use:
 Review documents electronically on your computer screen, laptop,
cellphone, or PDA (personal digital assistant). The more you use 
the screen, the easier you’ll find it to review and edit material without
printing it off and using a pen. These tools also enable you to work 
wherever you are and are just as portable as paper.
 Use e-mail and Internet access. Advances in these areas enable people
and companies to combine e-mail with fax and voice-mail retrieval.
 Use a scanner to make digital versions of images or items so that you
can exchange them electronically and copy them into electronic
reports.
 Take pictures with a digital camera to save both ink and photographic
paper if you maintain and exchange photo files electronically.
 Use Web pages, CDs, DVDs, or memory sticks instead of paper docu-
ments. Documents can be exchanged via e-mail or accessible servers if
appropriate and depending on their size and security needs. Company
regulations and policy documents also can be posted on the internal
computer system (Intranet) or on CDs or DVDs rather than being
printed out.
 Keep files in online storage systems, which enable centralized elec-
tronic information management on a network that everyone in the
company can access. These online systems can replace hard-copy 
filing systems.
298
Part V: Creating a Green Society 

The more you trust technology (with appropriate file backups), the less
likely you are to want to maintain a paper filing system to back up your
computer filing systems.
 Make sure that people have remote access to the company network so
they can access work from home or another remote location without
carting around a heap of documents.
 Print on both sides of paper.
Adopting other waste-reducing ideas
Even if you can’t eliminate the amount of paper used in your office, you 
can reduce it with some easy and inexpensive ideas. That goes for other 
consumables, too, from office supplies to the items in the staff lounge.
Consider implementing the following suggestions to reduce the amount of
waste produced in your workplace:
 If you can’t go paperless, buy recycled paper from local businesses to
cut down the energy used producing new paper, save trees, and save
fuel in transportation.
 Get the most out of paper by printing on both sides and using scrap
paper to make notes and leave them for other people instead of using
sticky notepads.
 Print using the “fast” or “draft” setting to save ink.
 Recycle used paper.
 Set up a place in the office to store and exchange reusable office 
supplies such as binders, envelopes (relabel them), and file folders
(turn them inside out).
 Set up a complete recycling system for bottles, cans, photocopier 
cartridges, batteries, printer ink cartridges, and plastic. Reuse any-
thing that can be reused, such as rewritable CDs and DVDs, and recycle
the rest.
 When disposable items (such as cups) run out, replace them with
reusable ones.
 Research practical alternatives to having water delivered for water
coolers, such as reverse osmosis water filtration systems.
Chapters 4 and 6 offer dozens of other tips that you can also apply to the
workplace.

Chapter 16: Implementing Ideas for a Green Working Environment

Turning Down Water and 
Electricity Usage
As you take steps to make your workplace more environmentally conscious
and friendly, turn your attention to the building itself. You may not have the
authority or resources to make building-wide changes yourself, but you can
make suggestions about how to improve things like electricity, water usage,
and even furniture — it will be money well spent in the long run. Check out
the suggestions in this section and also those in Chapters 4 and 5: The energy
efficiency and green measures that apply to your home apply equally to 
business properties.
If the rate of illness in your building seems generally high, it may have 
something to do with poor air circulation, sometimes known as sick building
syndrome. A better working environment improves staff comfort and may
even reduce absence due to sickness.
To arm yourself with information about environmentally friendly buildings,
head to the U.S. Green Building Council’s Web site at www.usgbc.org and
click LEED at the top of the homepage. (LEED stands for Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design.)
You can find information about your own building from the maintenance or
operations department or from the person responsible for those issues in
your company. Just remember that you’re doing research — avoid implying
any criticism of them because the company will need them onboard with 
any changes you recommend.
Actions to consider suggesting include the following:
 Switch to highly rated energy-efficient appliances. For details, visit
www.energystar.gov.
 Schedule regular service for heating and air conditioning systems,
and fit them with timers so that they’re in use only when people are
in the office.
 Change electricity suppliers to those sourcing power from green 
initiatives.
 Install water-saving taps, showerheads, and low-flush, dual-flush 
toilets.
 Take advantage of natural lighting, and install task lighting and 
high-efficiency compact fluorescent lighting.
300
Part V: Creating a Green Society 

 Install blinds and shutters on windows to block out direct sun and
reduce the need for air conditioning in the summer and to let sun 
and light in during winter. Blinds and shutters can reduce energy costs
because less electricity or other fuels are used to cool the premises in
summer and to heat the premises in winter.
 Make sure that all equipment is turned off at the end of the day 
rather than left on standby.
 Arrange for the last person out of the office each day to turn out the
lights, or have an electrician put the lights on a motion-sensor timer
that switches them off when there has been no movement in a room
for a certain amount of time.
 Equip the office kitchen with a fridge, a kettle, and perhaps a toaster
oven or microwave so that people can easily reheat food that they
bring from home. The availability of these appliances reduces the need
to drive somewhere off-site for meals and helps employees maintain a
healthy diet if workplaces aren’t close to restaurants that offer healthy
alternatives.
 Give everyone their own mug (or ask them to bring in their own), 
and remind them to save electricity by not boiling more water in the
kettle than they need each time for hot beverages.
 In the winter, turn the thermostat down slightly, and ask people to
wear sweaters or jackets. In the summer, set the air conditioning 
temperature slightly higher, use fans, and ask people to dress 
accordingly.
Talk to your building management or local municipality about the recycling
facilities available, including the usual glass, newspaper, cardboard, plastic,
and paper options, plus any others, and ask if grants or other incentives are
available for taking energy efficiency measures.
People are likely to respond to building-wide changes positively if they 
feel they’re being made for the good of the planet rather than just as a cost-
cutting exercise. Get people involved by making someone responsible for
each aspect of the company’s green policy.
Buying Green Equipment and Supplies
If you have purchasing power in your workplace, buy green goods. If some-
one else is in charge of equipment and supply purchasing, encourage your
boss or purchasing office to buy green whenever possible for the workplace.
It’s great to recycle paper, but it’s even better to buy paper that’s produced
from recycled materials and then recycle it again!
301
Chapter 16: Implementing Ideas for a Green Working Environment

Before buying new, apply the green basics of reusing, repairing, and recycling,
whether you’re looking at machinery, paper, toilet paper, or paint. (Use this
information to research greener options and make proposals to your office’s
purchasers, if that’s not you.)
Consider following (or making) these suggestions, keeping in mind that most
of them will not only make the company greener but also save it money:
 Check whether the business already has something that can do the job
for which the new item is being considered.
 Rent instead of buying new.
 Look for a version that has nontoxic components and as much recy-
cled material as possible.
 Choose the option with as little packaging as possible.
 Opt for rechargeable batteries whenever possible.
 Buy the most energy-efficient product that will last as long as possible.
When purchasing office equipment, look for Energy Star ratings
(www.energystar.gov).
 Make sure that equipment can be serviced and repaired so that it lasts
as long as possible.
 Consider what happens when the item is used up, no longer needed,
or can no longer be repaired. How will it be disposed of? Avoid sending
these items to the landfill if possible by donating them to an organiza-
tion that can use them or by recycling their components as appropriate
(see Chapter 6 for more tips on reducing waste).
Buy from local companies to reduce the distance that items have to be 
transported and therefore reduce the amount of fuel needed to get them to
your workplace.
As demand grows for green business products, the marketplace is 
responding with greater selection and lower prices. As green products
become more readily available, more businesses are willing to buy in. It’s 
a great cycle!
Being green means being fair to people as well as the environment, so 
when you buy green products (or suggest that to someone with the authority
to make such a decision), remember to be fair about paying your suppliers
on time.

Being Green by Being Ethical: Giving
Back to the Community
Green living is about protecting the environment and behaving ethically,
which means taking personal responsibility for your actions and making sure
that they don’t have a negative impact on the environment and the people
around you. At work, that means not doing anything that’s unfair to your
fellow workers, customers, suppliers, and the community in which you oper-
ate. As a result of government legislation, businesses have become much
more aware of the importance of ethical behavior internally over the past few
years (think standards for minimum wage, antidiscrimination, and safe and
healthy business environments and practices).
Nowadays, many businesses are taking their roles in the wider community
more seriously too, embracing what’s called corporate social responsibility.
This concept is all about what a business does — over and above what it has
to do to comply with the law — to make sure that its operations harm no one
and instead benefit everyone around it and involved in it.
Firms can encourage other businesses — such as their suppliers — to be
greener and more ethical and to act in a socially responsible way. Persuade
your supervisors to deal with suppliers with green and socially responsible
policies. The word soon spreads, awareness is raised, and attitudes and
habits change for the better.
When you’re thinking about improving your workplace by making it more
green, consider other ethical aspects too. The company you work for is part
of the local community where it has its offices or factories; this community
includes neighbors, schools, other businesses, community projects, environ-
mental and conservation projects, and hospitals. A truly green business
makes sure that its actions in some way benefit as much of the community 
as possible. You can help your supervisors come up with corporate social
responsibility policies for the company; you can find loads of great informa-
tion from the Business for Social Responsibility at www.bsr.org.
If the wider community benefits from your business, the residents will be
loyal to the business, meaning that the business benefits, too.
A company can contribute to the community in many different ways, some 
of which cost very little. Here are some suggestions for your business:
 Donate old computers or other equipment to schools or community,
volunteer, or charity projects. Some charities even accept equipment
that’s no longer working, saving it from cluttering up landfill sites.
303
Chapter 16: Implementing Ideas for a Green Working Environment

 Send used toner cartridges to charities or organizations that collect
them on behalf of charities.
 Campaign for office coffee and tea to come from certified Fairtrade
and organic producers.
 Ask your supervisor for permission to volunteer with a local commu-
nity project during work hours on a regular basis. For example, you
may be able to spend an hour or two a week assisting a teacher at a
local school.
 Arrange for your company or just your department to adopt a local
nonprofit organization or project, and encourage staff to donate
money or time volunteering on the project for a day or weekend.
Even better: Inquire as to whether your company or department can
take on a community service project on company time (with the 
understanding that all work will stay on track, of course). Consult the
appropriate person depending on your company: If you don’t know 
who that is, start with your supervisor.
 Set up a scheme in which someone from your workplace goes to local
high schools to talk to students about business and working in your
industry.
 Offer local young people work experience that’s appropriate for 
their ages and abilities and your workplace. Check with your Human
Resources department or specialist to find out about any legal 
requirements that the company would have to meet.
 Ask your employer to offer staff more flexible working hours so that
they can look after relatives or do volunteer work. Making it possible
for employees to look after relatives in their own homes enables 
those family members to stay in the community longer before needing
expensive and isolating institutionalized care.
As well as contributing to the local community, get the higher-ups in your
company thinking about supporting charities and organizations helping 
communities in other parts of the world. At some companies, for example,
management chooses a holiday gift for staff that contributes to some kind 
of charitable cause, such as planting trees or purchasing livestock for 
families in developing countries. Other companies have a gift- or service-
matching program that matches the amount of money or time (usually to a
preset limit) that an employee devotes to a charitable cause. If your company
has policies like these in place, make sure that they’re publicized in internal
communications in order raise employee awareness and participation.

Finding green jobs, whether you’re 
starting out or changing careers
You can take greening your workplace one step
further and turn it into a green career. Working for
an organization that’s involved with climate change
awareness, renewable energy, wildlife conserva-
tion, or green construction, for example, not only
provides a paycheck but also a great deal of 
personal satisfaction. Whether your specialty is
accounting, marketing, engineering, information
technology, or virtually anything else, green orga-
nizations can use your expertise and your genuine
interest in the environment.
Consider these strategies for finding work that fits
your green ambitions:
 Volunteer to gain experience. If you’re cur-
rently completing your studies or thinking
about a career change in a greener direction,
consider volunteering for or taking an unpaid
or low-paid internship with an organization that
operates in the area that you’re interested in.
You’ll gain valuable, hands-on experience that
can help you decide whether you want to
pursue a career in the field. At the same time,
you’ll establish a profile within the organization
that may lead to an offer of paid employment
or to valuable career advice and references.
 Identify business opportunities. As you build
your career experience, you may well discover
a green business niche that’s not well-served
by other companies. Launching your own 
business can fill that niche and provide
employment for yourself and others. Be sure to
research and plan your business thoroughly;
the U.S. Small Business Administration at
www.sba.govis an excellent place to start,
as are Small Business For Dummies, 3rd edi-
tion by Eric Tyson and Jim Schnell (Wiley) and
Small Business Kit For Dummies, 2nd edition
by Richard Harroch (Wiley).
 Assess green employers. If a green career is
important to you, make sure that potential
employers have put their greenbacks where
their green words are. To assess their goals
and achievements, do your research by
checking their Web sites and publications
such as research studies and annual reports.
Also search newspaper and magazine data-
bases (often available online through local
libraries) for mentions of the organization to
find out if the company’s press has been 
positive or not. Check out the associations that
the organization belongs to — or should
belong to — to further assess its community
involvement.

In This Chapter

 Bringing back run-down communities
 Getting young people hooked on environmental change
C
ommunity involvement brings together like-minded people, all of whom
likely have ideas about how to improve the environment around them.
It’s a great example of several minds being better than one. Community-based
environmental projects, both new and old, are active across the United States
as concern about green living grows. They range from groups that campaign
for change on a major scale, such as lobbying state and national governments
to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions, to groups of local people who roll
up their sleeves and restore a crumbling old building to preserve its timber
and history.
To find projects that interest you, you can contact your local municipality 
or county for information; check the Internet, your library, and local papers;
or set up a project of your own with neighbors in your street. You can even
get involved with something on the other side of the world or in a network 
of projects that span the globe, thanks in part to the Internet. The United
Nations Volunteers program at www.unvolunteers.org and www.world
volunteerweb.org serves as a global clearinghouse for information about
volunteering.
In this chapter, you find examples of the projects currently taking place in 
different parts of the U.S., what you can do for them, and what they can do
for the environment.

Establishing a Trade or Bartering System
Money may make the world go ’round, but it isn’t always necessary. You can
obtain goods and services (legally!) without cash and as a result become
involved in community-based projects that are sustainable, ethically sound,
and green. Trading or bartering systems and time banks are two ways to 
transcend the need for cash and foster community development.
Creating a community currency 
for trading skills and products
If you have a marketable skill or product, a local bartering system might be a
great way to put it to work without cash. They work by assigning a value for
your skill or product in an alternative currency (not usually the dollar) based
on a point system. As people use your skills or products, you can build up
points in the bartering community’s currency, which you then can use to
obtain other people’s skills or products.
For example, if your skill is in furniture making and you make a table for
someone, you get a certain number of points in whatever your scheme’s cur-
rency is called. You then may use some of those points to pay someone to 
do some babysitting for you. Programs like this encourage less buying of new
products and more sharing, so they make less impact on the environment. Be
aware, though, that bartering can have tax implications, just as purchasing
and selling goods and services does. Check with the IRS at www.irs.gov for
more information.
To find a bartering program near you, check the state-by-state member listing
at the National Association of Trade Exchanges (NATE) Web site: www.nate.
org. You also can find information about bartering at www.u-exchange.
com/barter101, which offers a member-based trade system that operates
across North America (and membership is free), and at www.irta.com, the
International Reciprocal Trade Exchange.
If there isn’t a local exchange and you don’t want to join a nationally based
exchange, consider launching your own exchange. Be aware, however, that
this can be a time-consuming and accounting-heavy endeavor. You need to
gather people together who are interested in bartering; decide how you’re
going to run the barter exchange; set up a currency equivalent, code of
ethics, and operating protocols; and actually run the system. If you need
assistance, Internet-based advisors can help (for a fee), including barter
trainer.com and barternews.com.

Banking your time
TimeBanks is a program in which you volunteer to share your time and skills.
Instead of giving money, you spend time doing something for someone else
and deposit your time in the “bank.” You then make a withdrawal from the
time bank when you need someone to spend time doing something for you. 
A timekeeper (or online matching system) keeps track of the time spent and
matches people up to help as they need it — and no payments change hands.
309
Chapter 17: Getting Involved with Your Community and Beyond
Supporting Agenda 21, a worldwide initiative
In 1992 the United Nations released a ground-
breaking action plan for sustainable development
called Agenda 21 (the United Nations action plan 
is called Agenda 21; local projects come under 
the title of Local Agenda 21). This is a blueprint that
sets out what can be done to contribute to global 
sustainability in the 21st century — hence the
name. The idea was to encourage people to act in
a sustainable or green way at their local level, with
the involvement of local government, business, and
the community.
An Agenda 21 program should deliver at least two
results at a local level:
 Community involvement in the development
and implementation of a sustainable program.
 Support for local people and businesses and
equal access to the opportunities generated by
the program.
Basically, a Local Agenda 21 project should involve
the local community in deciding what needs to be
done and help it make those changes. It’s usually up
to town, city, or county administrations to develop
and put these programs into action (although there’s
no reason why you can’t propose programs).
Here are a few examples of typical projects:
 Energy and water efficiency programs
 Recycling and waste reduction projects
 Worm farms, composting, and green garden-
ing systems
 Alternative energy projects, such as solar light-
ing in local parks
 The promotion of public transit, walking, and
cycling programs
 Public information on unique flora and fauna
and local ecosystems, which may include 
giveaways such as plant seeds
 Exhibitions showcasing low-energy designs for
homes
 Educational programs for people in different
local communities
 Raising awareness about opportunities in
green jobs, such as in city greenhouses, parks,
and gardens
If you type “Local Agenda 21” into a search engine
or visit www.iclei.org, you’ll find many Web
sites outlining individual projects — including
what’s happening in your area.

Everyone’s time is equal: One hour of time earns one time credit to spend
when needed regardless of what you spend that hour doing.
For example, you may register for the program and say that you’re willing 
to help out with people’s yard work. Someone calls in and says that she
needs your help, and you spend two hours working in her yard for her. Those
two hours are banked for you. Perhaps you need some help setting up an
accounting system for your small business. You can ask TimeBanks for two
hours of help from a bookkeeper. The bookkeeper’s two hours then get
banked for him, and the system keeps going.
You can get more information — including details about setting up a 
program in your area if there isn’t one there already — from TimeBanks USA
(www.timebanks.org), the national nonprofit organization that links and
supports time banks across the country by providing inspiration, guidance,
and practical help. TimeBanks appeals to people who know that their time
and skills are in demand but just don’t know what to do about it or where 
to start.
Protecting the Environment 
and Cleaning Up America
There’s no shortage of community projects aimed at protecting nature,
whether it’s wildlife or wild places. You can clear and maintain hiking trails 
in national parks, count birds for wildlife inventories that track declining
species, plant trees, and so much more. Where there are rivers and canals,
areas of common land, pathways, and parks, there are clean-up projects.
Waterways in particular seem to be magnets for plastic bags, supermarket
carts, old couches, and even burned-out cars, but vacant lots and public
lands can become dumping grounds, too. Cleaning these areas up has many
benefits: You’re protecting animals, fish, birds, and plant life from the risks
that the trash brings, and you’re also sending a message to other people that
someone cares about this piece of water or land — that it’s not a place to
dump their unwanted items.
Many of these protection and cleanup activities have a social benefit, too:
You’re out with your community, finding like-minded people and possibly
making great friends. That’s why projects such as these are excellent for
everyone — families, single people, and groups of friends or coworkers.
If you find a piece of land or water that needs some tender loving care, ask
your local municipality, county, or conservation groups what plans they 
310
Part V: Creating a Green Society 

have for cleaning it up. If no plans exist, come up with some of your own. 
For more information, see the sidebar in this chapter “Setting up your own
community project.”
Finding groups with a variety 
of opportunities
The following organizations have myriad opportunities for tending to the
land, some of which we cover in the following sections. Consider joining one
of these initiatives if you prefer to get onboard a nationwide effort:
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (www.orn.usace.army.mil/
volunteer) probably isn’t the first organization you think of when it
comes to volunteering to protect the environment, but in fact the Corps
offers a wide range of opportunities in locations across the country. It
even has its own volunteer hotline to match you up with those opportu-
nities: 1-800-VOL-TEER. More than 50,000 people provide a million hours
of help to the Corps annually as campground hosts, visitor center staff,
program coordinators, computer program developers, and writers. You
also can help with trail building and maintenance, wildlife habitat
restoration, and shoreline cleanup, so you have plenty of opportunities
to choose from.
 The Nature Conservancy (www.nature.org) works around the 
world and across the U.S. to protect the land and water on which life 
on earth — plants, animals, and natural communities — depends for 
survival. You may be familiar with the organization because it often part-
ners with private individuals, nonprofit organizations, governments, and
other groups to purchase land in order to protect it from development
or degradation. However, the Nature Conservancy also depends on vol-
unteers to help out with a wide variety of work. This can include getting
rid of exotic or invasive species on land or in water, running inventory
on plants and animals in a particular area, planting trees, cleaning up
natural areas, maintaining fences, assisting with prescribed burns that
help forests regenerate, and even working in offices to help with market-
ing or administration. Check out the organization’s Web site, which lets
you search by state to find volunteer opportunities in your area.
 National Public Lands Day (www.publiclandsday.org) gives 
volunteers a hands-on opportunity each year to get involved with their
local, state, and federal lands. It started in 1994 with 700 volunteers and
has now grown to nearly 100,000 people getting out and helping on the
designated day (usually near the end of September). Along with building
trails and bridges and planting trees, volunteers remove trash and 
invasive plants from public lands.

Planting trees
When you consider what trees do for the environment, they’re pretty amaz-
ing. They provide food and homes for animals such as squirrels and birds,
shade for the forest floor (and for people!), and oxygen for the atmosphere —
not to mention the fact that trees get rid of carbon dioxide (a major green-
house gas) in the process of releasing oxygen.
According to Trees Forever, an Iowa-based national organization that focuses
on planting and caring for trees as well as on larger environmental issues, a
single tree can provide enough oxygen in one day for a family of four.
To get in on the tree-planting game, you can join a Trees Forever
(www.treesforever.org) chapter in your community or start one if one
doesn’t already exist. Local groups get involved with the nuts and bolts of

Setting up your own community project
You don’t have to join an established organization in
order to make a difference to the environment. 
You can launch your own community project. Here
are some basic steps to follow in order to make it
successful:
1. Identify the need.
Do your research so that you have a clear idea
of the problem and its scope.
2. Find like-minded people.
Share your vision and you may be surprised at
how much help you can get. Talk to local ser-
vice organizations, community-based clubs, or
youth groups, for example. Get your municipal
or county government involved. When you
make presentations to such groups, always
have a sign-up sheet available so that you can
start building a list of potential organizers and
volunteers.
3. Put a plan in place.
Organize your project to map out goals, 
strategies, and even contingencies in case of
obstacles.
4. Raise funds if necessary.
Look for local, state, and federal grants (make
phone calls or start searching online), and col-
lect donations from the community. Check out
the latest edition of Fundraising For Dummies,
by John Mutz and Katherine Murray (Wiley), for
information to guide your way.
5. Raise awareness in the community.
The most successful projects are the ones 
that capture the community’s imagination and
support, so let the community know what’s 
happening and why. Contact local community
newsletters, newspapers, and other media 
outlets and offer to submit articles about the
project or provide people who can be inter-
viewed about it. Put up posters on community
bulletin boards (such as in supermarkets,
libraries, and community halls), and talk about
the project to friends and neighbors.

planting trees, including digging holes, planting, watering, and mulching. But
they also organize and need help with other projects such as planning and
managing events, designing planting plans, learning and educating others
about proper pruning techniques, and counting trees to help with inventories.
Of course, you can launch your own project, too. See the sidebar “Setting up
your own community project” — the tips in it work for tree-planting projects
just as much as any other.
If you’re launching your own tree-planting project, have an expert onboard
who can recommend appropriate tree species and ongoing care and 
maintenance needs for them.
Taking care of the coasts
Each September in countries around the world, people gather on the edges of
oceans, lakes, and waterways to clean up the beaches and banks of these
marine ecosystems. It’s all part of the Ocean Conservancy’s International
Coastal Cleanup (go to www.oceanconservancy.org, click Activities, and
then International Coastal Cleanup), and it’s one of the world’s largest single-
day volunteer efforts dedicated to improving the health of the ocean and its
wildlife.
Along with the cleanup, International Coastal Cleanup volunteers also keep
records of the type and quantity of the trash that’s found in order to help 
with trash elimination and education efforts throughout the year. From 
1986 and 2006, the 6.6 million volunteers that participated in International
Coastal Cleanup efforts removed 116 million pounds of trash from beaches
worldwide — that’s 258 times the weight of the Statue of Liberty!
You also can find other waterway cleanup initiatives by entering “waterway
cleanup” and the name of your city, county, or state into your favorite Internet
search engine. For example, the Texas Waterway Cleanup Program is a project
of the Keep Texas Beautiful organization: www.ktb.org.
Joining or organizing waste-
reduction projects
Cutting down on the amount of waste generated across America is a crucial
part of green living, so it makes sense to get the community involved in 
waste-reduction strategies, including recycling.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (or EPA) operates the WasteWise
Program to help organizations of all kinds — governments, businesses of any
size, nonprofits, hospitals, and so on — reduce their waste and their impact
313
Chapter 17: Getting Involved with Your Community and Beyond

on the environment. The program’s absolutely free and voluntary, and it’s
very flexible, which makes it easier to convince your organization to give it 
a try. If you’re concerned that your workplace or community organization 
isn’t as green as it should be, the WasteWise program is one way to suggest
solutions in a very positive and constructive way; you may even volunteer 
to become the waste-reduction team leader to facilitate the program’s 
implementation and ongoing management.
Your organization can find more information and register for the program at
www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/reduce/wstewise/index.htm. The
EPA recommends that you then conduct a waste assessment to figure out
your starting point and determine the actions you can take to reduce the
amount of trash that you’re generating. The program helps you out by pro-
viding strategies for reducing trash that would otherwise head to municipal
solid waste sites.
There’s no reason that you can’t spearhead the creation of a local recycling
project yourself. You don’t have to start big and tackle your entire city:
Starting with a small project such as composting for your child’s school is
easier to manage, and it provides an excellent building block for future, larger
projects. From smaller projects at schools and workplaces to large systems
for entire communities, the principal requirements are the same.
 Type of recycling: Research the kind of recycling that’s possible for your
target: Do recycling companies in your area take all or at least some of
the usual suspects — paper, glass, aluminum cans, and plastics? Can you
access a community-wide program that’s already in place? (For example,
perhaps you can organize a recycling program for your apartment build-
ing that will feed into your town’s existing program.) Can you handle the
recycling on a local level, as may be the case for composting?
 Equipment: Decide what equipment you need in terms of containers 
for different kinds of material. How large do the containers need to be?
How many do you need in order to be convenient to recyclers? Where
should you place the containers, again thinking about convenience?
 Transportation: Determine if you need to arrange pick-up of the 
recycling materials and transportation to local recycling centers.
 Sponsorship: Find local, state, or national programs or businesses that
will help out with costs such as startup equipment and transportation.
 Project management: Assign someone (or a team of people) to 
be responsible for the ongoing management of the recycling program,
including fundraising, cleaning containers, raising awareness, and 
monitoring the program’s success.
Establishing a recycling program may sound like a lot of work, but if you 
find some people who are equally as concerned as you are — possibly other
parents at the school or other residents of the apartment building, for 
example — you can build a committee to share the work. (See Chapter 9 for
more on organizing green efforts in schools.)

Restoring the Past: Working on 
Historic Buildings and Sites
Rebuilding, restoring, or upgrading sites and buildings of importance to an
area’s history is an effective way to contribute to your local environment. You
can join in one of thousands of projects going on around the country or, if
you’re ambitious, you can launch one of your own locally. The following fed-
eral programs provide opportunities to get involved in a variety of projects in
the areas of building restoration and archaeological studies:
 The National Park Service is one of many resources that you can tap
into if you’re interested in either restoring an old house that you’re pur-
chasing as your home or launching a community project to preserve a
building that has historic significance to the local area. The service’s
Technical Preservation Services department is the best place to start;
use its checklist (www.nps.gov/history/hps/tps/cheklist.htm)
for evaluating the building and planning the rehabilitation:
• Check available documentation.
• Evaluate the building’s historic character.
• Assess architectural integrity and physical condition.
• Plan the rehabilitation work.
• Check codes and other legal requirements.
• Check use of federal funds.
• Check available publications.
 The USDA Forest Service offers ordinary people a Passport in Time — 
a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program in which 
you work with professionals in national forests throughout the nation.
Previous projects indicate the range of work that you can participate 
in: stabilizing ancient cliff dwellings in New Mexico; excavating a 10,000-
year-old village site in Minnesota; restoring a historic lookout tower in
Oregon; cleaning vandalized rock art in Colorado; and serving as 
information specialists at various sites.
You can find current projects listed by state on the program’s Web site
at www.passportintime.com.
To find local projects that are in need of help, contact local historic preserva-
tion societies or groups, local chambers of commerce, local community or
county government offices, and state historic preservation offices. You also
may find projects via the Internet by entering the name of your local area
plus the words “historic building preservation” or “historic restoration.”

Regenerating Communities
In many towns and cities, entire neighborhoods have become run-down, 
contributing to crime and environmental damage. For example, trash, includ-
ing hazardous materials, is often left on streets instead of being disposed of
properly, potentially polluting the ground, air, and storm sewer systems. The
circumstances are reversible, but it’s a big project that requires a lot of time
and resources from different people. Communities don’t deteriorate overnight,
and they also don’t regenerate overnight. Sometimes, though, all it takes is
one project to provide the kick start that’s needed to set the community back
on track.
316
Part V: Creating a Green Society 
Volunteering virtually
Not everyone can volunteer for some of the types
of projects mentioned throughout this chapter. If
you’re taking care of children, looking after some-
one who’s older or sick, or have a disability that
restricts your mobility, some programs may be out of
the question because you don’t have the time or
transportation to participate in a community project
that operates outside your home. Virtual volunteer-
ing is a relatively new and popular approach to
involving people in volunteer capacities in which
you contribute your efforts over the Internet. You
can volunteer for any project that you’re interested
in anywhere in the world as long as it accepts virtual
volunteers. You simply arrange to complete the
tasks at a time and place that suits you.
The types of jobs asked of virtual volunteers include
Web site design, building databases, writing
newsletters, fundraising, doing research, and men-
toring. If you want to get involved virtually with a
particular project in your own community or farther
afield, contact the organization directly and offer
your services. Because you use practically no
energy to make your contribution, you contribute
doubly to the green revolution!
Letter writing is one method of virtual volunteering
that has been around for a long time. If you’re 
concerned about a particular environmental issue,
let local, state, and national politicians know, in 
writing. Many organizations offer templates or letter
samples to help you word your letters most 
effectively. You can use the following sources to
help you find causes, organizations, and places 
to send your letters or e-mails:
 Look to government Web sites to find mail and
e-mail addresses for politicians.
 Head to the National Resources Defense
Council’s Web site at www.nrdc.org for
links to a number of different causes.
 Find information about a vast range of environ-
mental health and well-being issues, including
clean air and water, and open-space protection
at www.uspirg.org, the Web site for 
the U.S. Federation of State Public Interest
Research Groups.

Many community regeneration efforts start with building restoration and 
renovation (refer to the preceding section), but they also can include projects
such as cleaning graffiti; setting up community gardens; clearing vacant lots;
improving park spaces; and organizing community gatherings such as festivals
and suppers, community education efforts, and crime prevention strategies.
Communities need green space to attract birds and other beneficial wildlife.
The National Audubon Society offers great information about providing 
habitat (including food, shelter, nesting sites, and clean water) for a range 
of bird species, whether you’re working in urban, suburban, or rural areas.
Visit www.audubonathome.org for more information.
The New York Restoration Project is an excellent example of a community
regeneration program. Founded by actor and singer Bette Midler in 1995, the
organization reclaims, restores, and develops parks, community gardens, and
other open spaces in New York City. Midler began the project after moving to
New York and noticing the dilapidated state of some of the city’s open
spaces. She launched the organization to clean up and restore those areas,
and the program became the “conservancy of forgotten places.” You can vol-
unteer with the project whether you live in New York or are just visiting;
check out the Web site at www.nyrp.org for details.
According to the New York Restoration Project, the program and its volun-
teers have removed more than 875 tons of trash from the city’s parks and
open spaces, reclaimed more than 400 acres of under-resourced and run-
down parkland, and provided free environmental education programming to
more than 10,000 at-risk urban youngsters.
To find community regeneration projects across the country, run an Internet
search that includes the words “sustainable neighborhoods.” To find assis-
tance in your area, start with your local city or town council, which is likely
to have lists of organizations or staff members that deal with the municipal
planning and social issues that this type of project entails.

Protecting your donations
When considering donating either time or money to
a charitable organization, it pays to do your research
first. You need to make sure that it’s not only a 
legitimate charity but also one that manages dona-
tions wisely and efficiently, ensuring that adminis-
tration costs are kept as low as possible, for
example, so that donations go to action rather than
administration. Charity Navigator evaluates charities
on a number of different levels to help you assess
the relative merits of different organizations. You can
find it online at www.charitynavigator.org.

Encouraging the Next Generation 
to Lead the Way
Whether you want to engage a small group of neighborhood kids, local youth
groups such as Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, or an entire school in an environ-
mental project, you just have to give the kids a few ideas. They’ll likely run
with those ideas, inspired to do as much as they can for the environment.
They could make habitat boxes for birds and bats, plant trees and gardens,
develop nature trails, create wildflower meadows, launch recycling programs,
or even run environmental awareness campaigns.
A number of different organizations offer child-, teen-, and young adult-
oriented programs, including the two we focus on in the following sections.
But you also can create your own program for children of a certain age,
depending on what your community needs most.
Taking action for nature
Action for Nature (www.actionfornature.org) is a worldwide community
project based in San Francisco that encourages young people to do their part
to protect the environment wherever they live. The list of projects and ideas
is endless. For example, children set up recycling schemes among friends and

Restoring New Orleans
One of the largest community regeneration projects
ever attempted in the U.S. is ongoing in New
Orleans as a result of the devastation wrought in
2005 by Hurricane Katrina. Although all levels of
government are involved in rehabilitation efforts, a
large number of individual and community projects
are making a significant difference in New Orleans.
One such project is the New Orleans Area Habitat
for Humanity. Through a number of different pro-
jects including Hoops for Homes, the Baptist
Crossroads Foundation, Musicians Village, the St.
Bernard Recovery Project, and the 2008 Jimmy and
Rosalynn Carter Work Project, the nonprofit organi-
zation is helping to build literally hundreds of 
affordable houses for those in need. You can donate
to the cause or plan a trip to volunteer in person by
visiting www.habitat-nola.org.
Global Green USA, the American affiliate of Green
Cross International, is also active in New Orleans,
focusing on rebuilding in a sustainable way. The
organization is teaming up with partners such as the
Home Depot Foundation and actor Brad Pitt on ini-
tiatives such as the Holy Cross Project, which aims
to build a sustainable low-income housing commu-
nity in the Ninth Ward. The Holy Cross Project
includes several houses and an apartment complex
that will feature green products and energy-efficient
systems, including solar panels to generate elec-
tricity. Find out more at www.globalgreen.org.

families in their communities, or they campaign for their school to use recy-
clable plates and cups instead of plastic ones and to buy food in recyclable
packaging.
Action for Nature also collects stories from young people about what they’ve
been doing that’s green, publishes those stories, and gives eco-awards each
year for the best projects. The group’s messages to children about green
living are similar to the ones in this book — like using public transport,
buying less, and protecting the wider environment — but Action for Nature 
is a practical project that encourages doing something instead of just talking
about the issues. It also encourages children to spread the messages to
friends and family.
Giving water a hand
Give Water a Hand (www.uwex.edu/erc/gwah) is a national program from
the University of Wisconsin’s Environmental Resources Center that helps to
educate young people about watersheds and get them involved in local envi-
ronmental service projects. Young people work with teachers and experts 
to study water issues, such as whether their own local bodies of water are
healthy and rich in wildlife, and to take action to improve water quality.
The program includes both an Action Guide for youth (which is also available
in Spanish) and a Leader Guidebook for youth leaders and teachers. You can
download both documents from the organization’s Web site.
Greening your local schools
If you truly want to create lasting change, then turning schools into centers for
change is a strategy that will last beyond your own lifetime. When schools are
built in green ways and teach green principles — both in the classroom and by
example — the kids who are educated there carry green living ideas with them
throughout their lives and pass them down to their kids, too. (We cover a 
variety of ways to make your children’s schools greener in Chapter 9.)
The Earth Day Network extends well beyond Earth Day itself, which is April 22
each year. In fact, the organization has teamed up with the U.S. Green Building
Council (USGBC) to green all of America’s kindergarten to grade 12 schools
within a generation. Greening these schools involves change in the following
four key areas:
 Healthy foods: The Network supports organic and locally grown food
choices. A major focus of its efforts is encouraging politicians at local,
state, and national levels to pass legislation that improves the nutrition
and quality of foods available in schools.
319
Chapter 17: Getting Involved with Your Community and Beyond

 Curriculum: The Network already has an Educator’s Network in place
that offers lesson plans and other tools for teachers to help them inte-
grate environmental issues into the classroom at all grade levels. It also
plans to create an online warehouse for free classroom materials that
will help educate children and youth about the environment.
 Policy and civics: Green school symposiums and school bond initiatives
(the sale by local governments of interest-bearing bonds that raise
money for specific measures — in this case, environmentally friendly
school construction or renovation) are part of the plan to help convince
politicians to pass measures that encourage green school construction
or renovation projects.
 Green facilities: The Network plans to work with community groups,
volunteers, policymakers, the USGBC, and others to improve both
indoor and outdoor school facilities, using programs to increase energy
efficiency, biodiversity, outdoor green space, and the use of green 
building materials.

with to further this long-term campaign, visit www.earthday.net.
Getting college students to 
ease up on gasoline use
No Gas Required (www.nogasrequired.com) uses the electric car as a

their educational institutions to reduce their hydrocarbon footprint and envi-
ronmental impact. The Web site offers a place for these young adult students
to learn about and discuss environmental issues and shows them how to
become advocates for change.

n this part, you ﬁnd ten easy things you can do today
to be greener right away; ten things that take a little
more effort but really pay off for a green lifestyle; and ten
ways to put the three Rs (that’s reducing, reusing, and
recycling) into effect by restoring and repairing items
around the house instead of trashing them.

Ten Easy Actions that Make 
an Immediate Impact
In This Chapter

 Keeping tabs on vehicle and energy use
 Getting the whole family involved
 Planning ahead for an even greener lifestyle
M
any of the green living suggestions throughout this book require some
planning and help to put into practice, but there are plenty that you
can get started on right now. This chapter lists the actions that are the most
doable and that won’t make any impact on your pocket — they just require a
bit of time and commitment.
Recycle Regularly
Organizing your recycling makes life a lot easier for you and your family, 
and you’ll be more likely to keep it up if it’s convenient. It’s helpful to have 
separate boxes or bags set up in your home so that you can simply drop the
various items to be recycled into the right receptacle as you go along. It’s 
so much easier than sorting them all out later. (You can see some possible
receptacles in Chapter 6.)
It’s possible to recycle cardboard, newspapers, magazines, paper, glass, 
plastic, cans, and clothes, but check out the recycling facilities in your area
because not all areas offer full recycling services yet. Call your city, town, or
county administration and ask to speak with the appropriate person for 
recycling issues; he or she can tell you what items are accepted and how the
system works.

Some places provide big recycling collection bins at various locations and
expect you to take your materials there for recycling. Others provide special
bins or boxes that you fill with the appropriate materials for curbside 
collection on certain days. If your local administration doesn’t offer recycling,
check your telephone directory to see if a private company offers it.
If you have a garden, designate one recycling container for leftover food and
peelings from fruit and vegetables (it’s best if this is a metal container that
won’t pick up any odors), and regularly empty it into your compost heap or
composter in the back yard. (Turn to Chapter 8 for more on composting.)
You can recycle other household items by reusing them. For example, turn 
old, unwearable clothes into rags for polishing shoes, washing vehicles, and
cleaning around the house.
Reduce Your Vehicle Use
Plan your driving schedule by the week to cut down on the use of your 
vehicle as much as possible. For example, if you have to drive your children 
to and from school, do your shopping on the way home or on the way to pick
them up. If you have to drive to and from work, include any other journeys 
that require the vehicle on your way there or back. Also consider sharing 
commutes with colleagues from work or taking other people’s children with
yours to school. If it’s practical from where you live, you may want to drive
your vehicle (or even better, walk or cycle) to the nearest bus or train station
and use public transportation for the rest of the journey. You can find more
transportation information in Chapter 13.
Even if you leave your vehicle in the garage for only the shortest journeys,
you’ll be doing your part to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Short
journeys are often the most environmentally damaging because a cold engine
uses more fuel and pumps out more damaging emissions than one that’s
already running. If you’re considering a short drive because the items you 
need are too heavy to carry back, get a backpack or even a wheeled cart that
may do the trick and let you walk or cycle.
If you have to use the vehicle, think about how you drive. Rapid acceleration
and braking use up more fuel — a smooth driving style is less damaging for
the environment. Keep your tires properly inflated, and don’t let the engine
idle when you can turn it off.
Become Frugal with Your Energy Use
Many of the actions that you can take to become more energy efficient are
super easy, cost little or no money, and will even save you money on your
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

monthly utility bills. Most involve changing your habits (and those of your
family). Be prepared for your new approach to take a little time to catch on,
but be patient because when it does, you save energy and cash.
You can try these tips at home:
 Beat phantom power. Leaving appliances such as cellphone chargers, 
coffeemakers, televisions, and computers plugged in on “standby” uses
a small amount of electricity that’s still very real when you’re paying for
it on your monthly bill. Unplug these appliances or switch them off at a
power strip.
 Turn things off. Turn off the lights in empty rooms. Turn off the com-
puter if it will be unused for more than two hours, and turn off the 
monitor if it will be unused for more than 20 minutes.
 Turn things down. Reduce the thermostat by two to five degrees in
winter (and increase it in summer), and reduce the temperature of your
hot water heater (if your dishwasher has its own temperature booster).
 Lasso the chill. The refrigerator and freezer are more energy efficient if
they’re full but not overloaded. Clean the coils either below or behind
the fridge in order to keep them operating efficiently.
 Avoid the burn. Choose the microwave or toaster oven over the regular
oven. When you have to use the regular oven, don’t open the door to
check cooking progress — you just let out the heat. When using the
stove, match the pan or pot size to the stovetop element, and keep a lid
on the pan or pot to make cooking more efficient. Keep appliances clean.
 Go for full and cold. Always wait to run the washer until you have a full
load, and wash clothes in cold water whenever possible to save energy
and reduce shrinkage and dye transfer. Line-dry whenever possible to
avoid using the clothes dryer.
Over a longer period of time you can do a complete audit of the amount of
energy each of your appliances uses. You can borrow a simple gadget from
many local libraries or utility companies that you plug your appliances into
to see how much power they’re using. This device gives you a clearer picture
of where you can make the most savings.
Maximize the Energy Efficiency 
of Your Lighting
As your conventional light bulbs burn out, replace them with compact fluo-
rescent (CFL) models, which use 75 percent less energy than conventional
bulbs and last up to ten times longer. CFLs cost a little more to purchase, but
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that they save you upwards of
325
Chapter 18: Ten Easy Actions that Make an Immediate Impact

$30 over their lifetime. Another advantage is that you don’t have to change
the light bulbs so often! If everyone in America switched just one bulb from
conventional to CFL, the DOE estimates that enough electricity would be
saved every year to light 3 million homes and prevent greenhouse gas emis-
sions equivalent to 800,000 vehicles.
CFLs contain a tiny amount of mercury, which is poisonous, so be careful 
with them. Don’t put them in the trash because if the glass breaks and the 
mercury leaks out, it could contaminate the area where it leaks. To dispose 
of them properly, seek out recycling facilities by checking www.epa.gov/
bulbrecycling. (Home Depot has a national bulb recycling program — 
you can drop CFLs off in stores.) If you happen to break a bulb in your home, 
follow the clean-up instructions at www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/
promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf.
Sign Up with a Green Energy 
Supplier or Plan
Some energy suppliers can sell you electricity generated by renewable
sources such as wind power. Call your supplier today to see if it offers a
green energy plan. With some plans, the electricity you use and pay for is
from a renewable source. With others, you pay a small premium that goes
toward a renewable project. For more on home energy use, flip to Chapter 5.
Green electricity has virtually no carbon emissions. If your own supplier can’t
come up with something suitable, call around to other suppliers until you
find one that can, and switch.
Turn Off the Tap
Water is the most precious of natural resources, yet it’s often taken for
granted. You can easily reduce the amount of water you use, however: Start
by turning off the tap while brushing your teeth. If everyone in the family gets
out of that habit, it’s a good start to a greener household (see Chapter 5).
Then try these other water-saving tips:
 When you run the faucet to get hot water, collect the cold water that
would otherwise head down the drain. Use kettles, bottles if you like to
have chilled water from the fridge, or a bucket that you can use to 
water plants.
 Make sure that the washing machine and dishwasher are full when you
use them so that you use them less often.
 If you wash the dishes by hand, don’t do it under a running tap.
326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Take quick showers (less than ten minutes) instead of baths. If you do
take a bath, you can use the bath water to water the garden (any bubble
bath ends up diluted).
 Collect rainwater in a rain barrel for use in the garden or for washing 
your vehicle or bicycle. Keep a lid on the barrel so that the water 
doesn’t evaporate on sunny days or attract breeding mosquitoes.
Buy Less; Reuse More
You’ve probably bought many things over the years that you didn’t really
need and didn’t end up using very much. Everything you buy has a tally of
carbon emissions — from the manufacturing process, the packaging, and
transporting it to and from the store — so the more you buy, the more emis-
sions you’re responsible for. And many unwanted items are likely to end 
their days in a landfill site where they take centuries to decompose. Overall,
buying less uses up less of the planet’s natural resources, which is an 
excellent green strategy.
When considering new purchases, first think reduce, reuse, repair, and 
recycle. Do you already have something that would do the job as well if you
repaired it? Can you rent or borrow the item from someone else or share one
belonging to a friend? When you do need to buy an item, consider whether it
can be recycled or reused when you’re finished with it. Maybe a friend can
make use of it and pass it on or a secondhand store could find it a new home.
We cover shopping and material goods in detail in Chapter 6.
Things like paper from presents and material from clothes can be reused to
wrap packages, and gifts you’ve received but don’t want can be regifted to
friends who would appreciate them.
Get Everyone in the Household Involved
You can achieve a lot on your own and even more together with your family.
Talk over your green lifestyle plans with everyone and explain your reasons
for going green. Explain how you’d like everyone to play their part: Maybe
each person can have special green responsibilities. It will take a while before
everyone turns off the light when they leave a room or shuts the fridge 
door, but eventually it will become second nature. By doing things yourself
and setting an example, you can help to create a new green culture around
the home.
Children often get information at school about green issues, so you can 
give your children the job of making sure that they keep you up-to-date on
practical tips they pick up that you can use at home. They’ll feel as if they’re

leading the green revolution in your home. For more on raising green kids,
check out Chapter 9.
Stay Informed
There’s so much information available about leading a greener lifestyle 
that it’s hard to know where to start. One of the best tools for staying
informed about new breakthroughs is the Internet: Just type “green living”
into any search engine and you’ll get links to all sorts of useful information.
Newspapers and radio and television programs also are useful for keeping 
up-to-date.
The Appendix of this book includes dozens of Web sites to give you a head
start on staying informed when it comes to specific aspects of green living,
such as shopping, water conservation, and wildlife issues. We also list Web
sites that you can visit for more general green living information on the 
Cheat Sheet at the front of this book.
Plan for Bigger Steps and 
a Greener Lifestyle
When you start to think about leading a greener lifestyle, you may find that 
you want to do more. The steps in this chapter don’t require money to put
into operation, but now’s the time to plan what you’d like to do if and when
you can save up the money: Most of the energy-efficient measures that cost
money to implement ultimately turn out to be a good investment over the
long term. For example, you save money on your utility bills by replacing old
appliances with more energy-efficient models. Also, your food bills come
down if you convert some of your garden to grow your own vegetables; this
change also pays dividends in terms of providing you with healthier food and
the opportunity to get more exercise.
If you want to become even greener, you may be able to produce some of 
your own power from solar panels or a domestic wind turbine. Research the
grants you may be eligible for, and factor those into the amount you have to
save or roll into your mortgage. (Chapters 4 and 12 have information on this
topic.) If your vehicle is about to give up the ghost and you intend to replace 
it, check out the greener options in the showrooms. Chapter 19 contains ten
suggestions for making your green lifestyle even greener.
There’s no need to rush into spending a lot of money on being green, but
through planning you may well find that it doesn’t cost much more and will
save you money in the long run.

Ten Ways to Darken Your 
Shade of Green
In This Chapter
 Giving away your unwanted items
 Finding green products to replace conventional ones
 Passing the green mindset on to your kids
 Thinking green when exercising
 Renting out your green home
 Commemorating life events in a green way
A
s the green revolution gathers momentum, it gets much easier to buy
food and other items that make your life greener, to donate unwanted
goods, to throw green parties, and even to exercise with the environment in
mind. This chapter outlines ten green actions that will make a difference in
your life and in the life of the planet.
Being green doesn’t always involve spending money. Sometimes putting good
ideas into practice and helping other people by behaving ethically is enough.
Find a New Home for Pre-Loved Items
Of course you can always give things away to friends, family, and stores such
as Goodwill and the Salvation Army, but what happens if no one you know
really wants the items or if there’s no charity store near you? The Freecycle
Network (www.freecycle.org) is an Internet-based free service that allows
people to post messages about items they’d like to give away. It’s one more
tool in your quest to divert as many items as possible away from the landfill.
Freecycle has millions of members around the world who are divided up into
local sites.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
After you post an item on the Freecycle message board, others e-mail you to
say that they’d like the item. Many people just use a “first-come, first-served”
approach to choosing the recipient if more than one person is interested. The
giver and the recipient then decide how to exchange the item. The standard
rule is that, when you become a member, you first offer something up on
Freecycle; after that, you have the opportunity to pick up things that you’d
like that other people are giving away.
Buy Local Produce the Easy Way
Eating in a green way involves as much locally grown food as possible, and
it’s even better if that local food is also organic. You may find, however, that
it’s not convenient for you to head across town to a farmer’s market or into
the countryside to a farm to pick up locally grown produce such as fruit, veg-
etables, and eggs. That’s when a local grocery delivery service can really
come in handy. The food (usually of your choice) is delivered right to your
door. This convenient service is also environmentally friendly because instead
of ten people driving all over town to pick up the produce, the company can
choose an efficient route between those people and deliver to them instead.
This arrangement usually saves both fuel and greenhouse gas emissions.
When comparing services, check out where the food is sourced to make sure
that it’s as local as possible. Also find out where companies source fruit and
veggies when local producers aren’t growing (during the winter, for example).
Opting at least for organic when you can’t find local produce is a good plan.
To find a grocery delivery service in your area, type “organic food delivery
service (your town or city)” into your favorite Internet search engine. Also
check www.spud.com and www.doortodoororganics.com to see if they
deliver locally. If you can’t find an organic food delivery service, try skipping
the “organic” part of the search and check the resulting delivery companies
to see if the produce is at least local.
Eat with Your Children
If your children are involved in shopping for food and cooking it, they’ll have
a much better idea of where the food actually comes from and what’s good
and bad for them. Take them to visit local farms or city farms to help them
understand the link between food and the countryside. (Audubon centers
and farms are a great learning environment and can be found in many states —
check www.audubon.org for a state-by-state listing.) Then welcome their help
in the kitchen in an age-appropriate way so that they think of cooking as some-
thing that’s fun and pleasant rather than a chore.

Focus your family’s choices on fresh foods, including fruit and vegetables, so
that they’re less likely to develop a taste for processed food. This is a great
way to create a green legacy that will last for generations.
Buy Fairtrade Goods
As we explain in Chapters 10 and 11, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations
International is a trading program that works to make sure that producers
(especially in the developing world) receive fair prices for their products that
allow them to reinvest in their business, and that workers have reasonable
working conditions. While it was once quite difficult to find Fairtrade goods,
it’s becoming much easier as the program catches on with consumers. The
more that you support Fairtrade goods, the more money is available to sup-
port further expansion of the program.
Specialty stores and even some supermarkets carry a range of Fairtrade
goods — approximately 300 at the time of this writing — including tea, coffee,
chocolate, bananas, herbs and spices, flowers, cotton, and footballs, and the
list is growing as the program extends its reach. You can find more information
about Fairtrade at www.fairtrade.net.
Green Your Morning Coffee
Because green living isn’t about sacrificing things that make your life more
enjoyable, there’s no reason to do without your morning coffee — but you
can make it a little greener (in philosophy rather than color!). If you pick it up
on your way to work, ask the store to fill your own mug rather than using a
disposable cup. Many coffee shops also offer Fairtrade-certified coffee along
with metal spoons and cartons of cream or milk instead of small individual
(disposable) servings. If your usual stop doesn’t have these things, consider
asking them to change their ways, or just switch to a new coffee place that’s
more environmentally conscious.
If you park your vehicle and go in to get your coffee, you not only save the
fuel and greenhouse gases that you’d otherwise emit while waiting at the
drive-thru, but you also get to know the people who run the shop and so
increase your local community contacts.
Of course, you can also brew your own Fairtrade coffee at home and take it
with you on the road in an insulated mug — the coffee’s even greener if it’s
organic, too!

Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Darken Your Shade of Green

Limber Up with Green Exercise
Regular exercise improves your health tremendously. Simply making time to
walk or cycle can make a huge difference, but if you need or want a little
extra time in the gym, consider buying exercise equipment to use at home
instead. Gyms aren’t necessarily the greenest places to exercise: They use a
huge amount of energy to light the facility, run air conditioning, operate the
equipment, and heat pools, saunas, and other water features; they also use
chemicals in the pools.
You can get greener exercise in the nearest park or at home. Exercise in the
park and there’s no energy involved apart from your own. Exercise at home
and, unless you use electrical equipment, you’ll use no more power than
normal. Plus, you save on those gym fees.
If you need the motivation or social contact that a gym provides, find a facility
that’s as green as possible. For example, it may source power from green
alternatives and clean with natural chemicals. Check the clubs closest to your
home or work to find out which one offers the greenest facility: Use their Web
sites or a quick call to their information lines to gather green details.
Assist in Community Development
If your community is looking for ways in which to plan for sustainable devel-
opment, suggest The Natural Step, an international nonprofit organization
that offers a very concrete, science-based approach to sustainability.
The Natural Step provides a logical, systematic way to approach community
development that focuses on the following issues:
 Resources: Reducing and eventually eliminating the continued mining
and use of minerals brought up from the ground
 Health: Reducing and eliminating contribution to synthetic substances
that are persistent in nature and harmful to health and well-being
 Environment: Reducing the impact that people have on nature in terms
of the physical degradation of natural systems
 Society: Reducing and eliminating the barriers in society that keep
people from meeting their needs
You can find more information about The Natural Step, which is active in
Oregon, at www.naturalstep.org.

Rent to Green Tenants
If you’re lucky enough to have a house, apartment, or room to rent out, think
about green renting, renting to tenants who want to live in an eco-friendly home.
Adding green features to a house or apartment costs money, but it’s worth it.
Green renters are likely to pay a little extra for a home that’s cost-effective or
that doesn’t trigger any of their environmental sensitivities. Green tenants also
are likely to stay longer because of the home’s green features, so you don’t have
as many periods when the property is empty while you look for a new tenant.
(Turn to Chapter 4 for green changes you can make to your home.)
Celebrate Life’s Milestones Greenly
Every big life event — births, birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and Christmas
and other religious festivals — deserves to be marked in an appropriate way.
Celebrate in a way that’s green, and you extend your focus on an environmentally
friendly lifestyle to every aspect of the fun. Use these strategies to green your
celebration:
 Cut back on printing. Send invitations electronically or at least print
them on recycled paper using as little paper as possible. Skip the extra
papers often included in wedding invitations, for example.
 Go organic. Choose local, organic food for celebratory meals, whether
you’re having the celebration at home or in a hotel or restaurant. If
possible, find a caterer in your area who can accommodate this request.
 Support Fairtrade. Whenever possible, buy Fairtrade party supplies.
Check stores that offer Fairtrade products first, and then head online if
you still need items for your celebration.
 Decorate naturally. Use natural rather than artificial decorations, including
potted or garden plants suited to your area that guests can take home after
the celebration (ask a local garden center for advice). If you choose cut
flowers, enjoy them and then compost them after the party.
 Green the gifts. Request or give green gifts: Suggest donations to green
or sustainable causes, or put green items on the gift registry list. Other
low-impact, green gifts include artwork, tickets for the theater, or gift
certificates for a restaurant specializing in local cuisine.

Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Darken Your Shade of Green

Plan for a Green Funeral
You may not want to think about your death and funeral, but you can choose
an environmentally friendly alternative that’s kinder to the planet for almost
every aspect of your end-of-life wishes. If you want a green funeral, you must
do your research, make your plans, draw up a list of dos and don’ts, and talk
to your nearest and dearest about your wishes. Write all the details down,
and keep them with your will.
Your family needs to know whether you would prefer to be buried or cre-
mated. There are green arguments against both these options. Conventional
burials in cemeteries carry a problem of space and the proper disposal of
potentially harmful embalming fluids. For cremation, there’s the issue of
gases released into the atmosphere. Whether you’re buried or cremated is
one decision that’s intensely personal, so do your research and choose the
option that’s right for you.
If you prefer burial and a wood casket, choose one that’s made from wood
certified to come from a sustainable forest — that is, one where trees are
replaced as they’re cut down. (You can get more information on sustainable
forests from the Forest Stewardship Council at www.fscus.org.)
Alternatives to wood caskets are wicker or cardboard caskets, which are
biodegradable. Some suppliers offer a cardboard casket inside a wooden
shell, and the shell goes back to the undertaker when the funeral is over.
Green or natural burial sites are becoming more common. These nature-based
sites don’t usually allow the use of embalming fluids and require biodegrad-
able coffins. Also, there aren’t any headstones in green burial sites; most
graves have trees planted on them, so you have a doubly green send-off.
Visit the Centre for Natural Burial’s site at naturalburial.coop for more
information about green cemeteries in the United States, including Memorial
Ecosystems (www.memorialecosystems.com), which operates locations in
South Carolina and Georgia, and the Glendale Nature Preserve (www.glendal
enaturepreserve.org) in Florida. Another option is having yours or your
loved one’s cremated remains mixed in a cast-concrete reef that’s lowered
onto the seabed off the coast of Florida, where it can serve as a shelter for
marine life for hundreds of years; find more information at www.eternal
reefs.com.

Rather than Trash
In This Chapter
 Salvaging broken china
 Making furniture last longer
 Patching flooring
 Giving fabric a new lease on life
O
ne way to live the green lifestyle is to reduce the amount you purchase;
in order to do that, it makes sense to focus on extending the life of what
you have. This chapter contains our favorite repair and reuse projects for
everyday items from dishware to furniture to fabric. The techniques used are
straightforward, quick, and effective. For tools, equipment, and some extra
help (if you need it), turn to experts at your local home building center or
fabric store.
Turning Broken Plates into Tabletops
You can turn old plates that you don’t use anymore or — oops! — plates that
you’ve accidentally broken into creative works of art as tabletop mosaics.
This project does double duty if your tabletop is in bad shape to begin with.
Follow these steps to make the transformation:
1. Break the plate pieces into workable sizes — anywhere from 1⁄2 inch 
to several inches across. The pieces don’t need to be even or equal 
in size.

For safety, place the pieces you’re breaking under a piece of cardboard or
heavy fabric, and hammer the material. The protective layer stops most
of the pieces from flying around, but you should still wear safety glasses,
just in case.
2. Do a dry layout without adhesive, placing the pieces on the tabletop to
make sure that you’re happy with the design (see Figure 20-1).
3. Remove the pieces from the dry layout in an orderly manner, perhaps
placing them in the same arrangement on your work surface as they
were on the tabletop.
4. Use a notched trowel to apply premixed tile adhesive to the table, and
set the broken pieces into the adhesive.
Choose an adhesive that’s environmentally friendly and nontoxic. If your
local building center doesn’t stock these, you can find them online at
sites such as greenbuildingsupply.com.
5. Allow the tabletop to dry according to the adhesive instructions.
6. Using a rubber-backed trowel, apply premixed grout to the mosaic top
to fill in the spaces between the broken pieces. Wipe a damp sponge
over the surface to remove most of the excess grout.
7. Let the grout dry, and then wipe the surface again with a damp sponge.
8. Let the grout cure according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and
then seal the tabletop with a tile and grout sealer to help protect 
the finish.

Refinishing Wood Furniture
With just a little elbow grease and some water-based paint or stain products,
you can repair and refinish wood furniture to give it a whole new life. A
wooden chest of drawers that’s outlived its usefulness in the master bedroom,
for example, can be reinforced and repainted to suit a child’s bedroom. This
project also is a great way to turn secondhand furniture (look for solid wood
and sturdy construction) into a family heirloom.
The specifics of refinishing vary depending on what you’re working on, how
valuable it is, the finish that’s already on it, and what you want it to look like in
the end. However, the basic steps include first identifying the existing finish;
stripping or sanding it down if needed, or just cleaning it; and applying the
new finish or renewing the old finish according the instructions of the product
that you’re using. Always use the most environmentally friendly, least toxic
products available.
Water-based paint or stain products are much friendlier to the environment
than oil-based products; those that release few or no volatile organic com-
pounds (they’re labeled as low- or no-VOC) are even better.
If part of the furniture structure is beyond salvaging, you may still be able 
to use other parts of it. Remove a tabletop from its legs, for example, and re-
use it with new legs (many stores, including home improvement stores and
Ikea at www.ikea.com, stock a vast array of table-leg options). If the exterior
structure of a chest of drawers is beyond help, you can reuse the drawers as
under-bed storage by adding wheels to the bases and pushing them under the
bed (measure the bed’s height from the floor first to make sure they’ll fit).
Repairing Wooden Chair Rungs
Loose, wobbly chair legs are common on older wooden chairs, but they don’t
have to signal that it’s time for the chair to head to the landfill. If the chair
isn’t particularly valuable and you’re looking for a quick fix, hit the hardware
store for small metal strips that you insert between the rung and the hole that
the rung fits into. The strips grab both surfaces and make the chair wobble no
more. Home improvement stores also sell a glue-based product that you inject
into the space between the rung and its hole to firm things up.
To do the job completely, however, you need to take the chair rungs apart.
Separate the pieces gently, and lay the rungs out in the same pattern as they
fit into the chair so that you know which ones go where when it’s time to
337
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Repair and Restore Rather than Trash

reassemble. Clean off old glue with sandpaper, and then re-glue the joints.
Clamp the chair rungs into place with several rigid bar clamps (see Figure
20-2) or a flexible clamp that cinches around all the legs at the same time
(often called a strap or band clamp), and wipe off any excess glue that oozes
out. Then just wait for the glue to dry according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.

Recovering Dining Chair Sets
Replacing the fabric on dining chair seats is a simple fix that gives the chairs
a whole new look at a fraction of the cost (and environmental impact) of
buying new ones. Before you get started, however, make sure that the chair
frames themselves — whether they’re made of wood, metal, or something
else — are sound, and repair them as necessary. Then follow these steps for
the seat:
1. Remove the seat pad from the chair by removing the screws that hold
it to the frame.
2. The seat pad likely has a piece of cardboard or similar material sta-
pled to its underside to cover the raw edges of the fabric, so carefully
remove the board.
If the board is in good shape, save it; if not, use it as a pattern to cut a
new piece of board (cardboard or otherwise).
3. Remove the old fabric from the seat pad and use it as a pattern to cut
out the new fabric. Check the seat’s padding and replace it if it’s too
compressed or damaged to cushion the seat comfortably.
4. Lay the new fabric right-side down on a sturdy surface. Place the
padding over it and the seat pad on top of the padding so that the
underside of the seat pad is facing up.
5. Grasp the center of the fabric from what will be the front edge of the
seat, fold it over the seat pad, and staple it to the seat. Do the same on
the facing side. Then staple the fabric along those two sides into
place, working from the center staples out toward the edges.
6. Repeat Step 5 on the other two sides of the seat.
7. Staple the board from Step 2 into place to hide the cut edges of the
fabric. If the staples don’t insert themselves all the way, use a hammer
to tap them firmly into place.
8. Screw the seat pad back onto the chair frame.
Renewing Upholstered Furniture
If your chairs and sofas are looking a little tired, you have two options to
extend their life: slipcovering or reupholstering. Both options work best
when the material is tired but the underlying structure is still sound; if the
structure, such as a metal or wooden frame, is broken and not easily fixed, it
may not be worth the time and expense to solve the material problem.
339
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Repair and Restore Rather than Trash

Slipcovering is the easier and less expensive of the two options. You can
either buy or make slipcovers to fit furniture such as sofas and chairs. In many
cases, the slipcover fabric is washable, which gives you the additional benefit
of being able to remove and launder the slipcovers when needed. The covers
often use elastic or fabric ties to secure them to the shape of your furniture,
but one downside is that even with the these measures, they still tend to need
frequent re-tucking. Check out Window Treatments & Slipcovers For Dummies
by Mark Montano and Carly Sommerstein (Wiley) for advice and instructions
on making slipcovers.
Reupholstering your furniture provides a much more permanent — albeit
more expensive — solution for tired furniture. The phone book can direct you
to local stores or craftspeople who specialize in this work in your area, but
you can do it yourself if you’re prepared to be patient and to put the time into
learning the skills and completing the job.
College and community continuing education programs and fabric stores
often offer courses and workshops to help you learn the techniques involved
in sewing your own slipcovers and reupholstering your own furniture. Books,
videos, and Web sites can also help a great deal, but the courses offer a
chance to try the techniques for yourself under the supervision of experts.
Patching Carpets and Vinyl Flooring
You can patch small holes, tears, or damaged areas in carpet and vinyl floor-
ing using quite similar techniques, despite the dissimilarity of the material.
The key is finding a small piece of undamaged carpet or flooring to use as a
patch. If you don’t have any spare carpet or flooring, cut the patch out of an
inconspicuous area such as the back of a closet. Follow these steps:
1. Find a place to cut out the patch where the pattern of the patch will
match the pattern of the damaged area. Cut out the patch using a 
utility knife, running the knife against a metal straightedge to get a
clean seam.
2. Tape the patch into place over the damaged area so that the patterns
match exactly. Use the utility knife to cut out the damaged area using
the patch as a guide (see Figure 20-3).
3. For carpet, stick double-sided carpet tape onto the floor and press 
the patch into place. You also can use seam adhesive to help seal the
patch’s seams. For vinyl flooring, glue the patch into place with vinyl
flooring adhesive (follow the manufacturer’s instructions).
You can find nontoxic adhesives at greenbuildingsupply.com if your
local stores don’t stock them.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If your vinyl flooring dates back beyond 1981, it may contain asbestos. If you
have any doubt or concern about the presence of asbestos in your flooring,
hire an expert to check it before you start repairing it; it may be healthier and
safer either to have it removed by professionals or to lay new flooring over 
top of it.
Turning an Old Door into a Desktop
Reusing furniture doesn’t get any easier than this. An old door can make a
great work surface. A flat door without embellishments or windows works best,
and it’s even better if it’s solid wood rather than hollow core. Here’s how to
make the transformation:
1. Remove all hardware from the door, such as hinges and doorknobs.
2. Measure the space you want the desk to fit into and then measure the
door. If the door fits, great. If it doesn’t, you can cut it to size with a saw.
If you’re using a hollow-core door, carefully save the pieces that you cut
off. There should be a solid piece of wood that forms a frame inside the
door edge. Take this piece of wood out of the discarded piece, and screw
or glue it inside the cut edge of the door to recreate the solid frame.
Figure 20-3:
Lay the
patch 
over the
damaged
area so that

exactly.
341
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Repair and Restore Rather than Trash

3. Refinish the door if desired (refer to the “Refinishing Wood Furniture”
section earlier in this chapter).
4. Mount the door, which is now a tabletop, either on table legs (which
you can buy at home improvement stores and some retailers, such as
Ikea) or on two pieces of similar furniture such as bookshelves or end
tables.
Make sure that the hole for the doorknob is to the rear of the desk; it
makes a great hole through which to pass computer component cables.
Making Gift Wrap Out of Fabric
Making gift bags or gift wrap out of fabric takes just a few minutes (sewing is
optional), but it creates striking gift wrap that can be used again and again.
Buying inexpensive fabric on sale keeps the cost down below that of wrap-
ping paper, but you also can go greener by using leftover fabric from other
projects. You can even salvage fabric from older clothing; jeans, for example,
may be worn at the knees and hem, but if the denim in between is in good
shape, reuse it.
Here are two options for turning fabric into gift wrap:
 The no-sew gift wrap method: Cut out a piece of fabric with pinking
shears. The scissors produce a jagged cut edge that resists fraying.
Wrap the fabric around the gift as if you were using paper, and then tie
the fabric in place with ribbon.
 The quick-sew gift bag method: Cut out a piece of fabric and fold it 
over on itself with the right sides of the fabric together. Assume that the
folded edge is the bottom of the bag, and sew the edges together along
what will be the two sides of the bag. Either fold the edges of the remain-
ing open seam (the top of the bag) over and sew to create a hem, or cut
them using pinking shears. Turn the bag right-side out, place the present
inside, and tie the open side closed with a ribbon.
Sewing an Heirloom Quilt from 
Your Children’s Clothes
Even if you’ve never quilted before, you can make a wonderful keepsake out
of the children’s clothing that you can’t bring yourself to give away. Collect
the clothing you want to use and then select a quilt pattern that you like.
(Search quilt patterns and instructions online, or visit your local library to
peruse quilt pattern books.) Cut the clothing up into pieces that are the
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

proper shapes and sizes for the pattern, and sew them together according to
the pattern instructions. Sandwich the quilt with the pieced top, a layer or
two of batting, and a piece of backing fabric. You can then sew a pattern
through all the layers either by hand or by machine to add interest and keep
the layers together.
If you’re a novice quilter, check out Cheryl Fall’s Quilting For Dummies, 2nd
Edition (Wiley). Also, you can learn so much by taking a quilting class at your
local fabric store or community college. You’ll discover great tools (like the
rotary cutting tool that makes cutting easier and more accurate than scissors),
handy tips, and like-minded people who can help you with your project.
Making a Rag Rug from Fabric Scraps
If you remember how to braid, you can create a rug from leftover fabric that
you have hanging around the house. One strategy is to use fabrics with colors
that complement each other, but that’s not at all necessary: Part of the fun of
the rag rug is not knowing how the colors will come together when they’re
braided. Follow these basic steps and check out Figure 20-4:
1. Cut the fabric into strips that are two to three inches wide and as long
as possible.
2. Sew the short ends of the strips together, with the right sides of the
fabric together, to create long strips that are a maximum of about nine
feet long (any longer and they tend to tangle while braiding).
You’ll braid these strips together in sets of three. It’s difficult to provide
guidelines as to how much footage you need for the strips because the
size of the rug is determined not only by the braid length but also by the
weight or thickness of the fabric. It’s best to estimate the required
footage after you start braiding — then you can see how thick the braids
are and the length of the fabric that went into them.
3. Tie three strips together at one end, and start braiding them.
When you come to the end of the strips, sew each of the strips to a new
strip to lengthen the braid and increase the size of your finished rug.
4. Begin coiling the braid into a circle or oval as desired. As you coil it,
hold it in place with safety pins, and then use an upholstery (curved)
needle and very sturdy thread (nylon works well) to sew the braid to
itself in the shape you want.
To determine the size of a finished oval rug, the center braid that you start
with should be as long as the difference between the length and width of the
finished rug. For example, for a 4-x-6-foot rug, you lay out 2 feet of braid before
turning it to start the coiling process.
