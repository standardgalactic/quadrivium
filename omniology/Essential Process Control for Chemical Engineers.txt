Foreword
FOREWORD
This book is based on the course notes from the introductory process control class at 
Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Scotland. This course is itself based on the IChemE 
model-curriculum for chemical engineers and covers the material that ALL chemical engineers 
are supposed know. The IChemE curriculum was drawn up by a team of industrialists and 
academics, led by Professor Jon Love, in response to a recognised need for chemical engineers 
to be taught a more industrially relevant course. 
This book isn’t a traditional academic textbook in that there are no references anywhere 
in the text. The main reason for this is that the material has been gathered from many 
different sources after a working lifetime of teaching in the area and trying to identify an 
original source is impossible. I have included a bibliography for readers who wish to look 
further into the subject.
I hope students and teachers find this book useful. A major new part of the course at 
Strathclyde University (where I teach) has been the introduction of new process control 
learning software called PISim, and this is described in the appendix. PISim will be 
commercially released in late Autum 2017.

INTRODUCTION
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Why process control is necessary
Process control is concerned with making sure that processes do what they are supposed 
to in a safe and economical way. This isn’t an easy task as most processes are subject to 
many inputs called disturbances that constantly cause the controlled variables to move 
away from their desired values (or setpoints). To prevent this other process inputs called 
manipulations have to be moved to restore the process to the desired state. 
Process control is concerned with the overall system. A control engineer has to know about the 
instruments used to measure process quantities, the valves and other final control elements 
that allow control systems to adjust the process, communications to transmit information 
around, the control algorithms that decide how to respond to the information coming 
from the process, and finally the control engineer needs to understand how the process 
itself behaves: not just its steady-state behaviour but more importantly its dynamic response.
Control engineering is now an area which offers big career opportunities for chemical 
engineers. The area used to be dominated by electrical/electronic engineers as the major 
challenges were in the hardware. This has changed. Sophisticated modern control systems 
allow much more complicated, process related, control schemes and now a major 
requirement for a control engineer is that they have a good understanding of the process.

Introduction
•	 In real chemical plants, steady-state doesn’t exist. Things are always changing. 
Temperatures move up and down, levels get lower and higher, etc (see figure 1).
•	 All processes are subject to disturbances. These are inputs to the process that change 
in a way that is beyond the reach of the local control system. A rainstorm on the 
outside of a distillation column will cool the column and require action to be 
taken to increase the heat input. Raw material variations are another common 
disturbance. Actions of other control systems can also cause disturbances to the 
process of interest – if a control system upstream or downstream of a process reduces 
a flowrate its effects will cascade throughout the rest of the process.
•	 The control system needs to actively regulate against the effects of these disturbances. 
It does this by either measuring the disturbances directly (where this is possible and 
economic) or by measuring their effects on the controlled variables of the process. It 
then makes adjustments to other inputs to the process called manipulated variables 
to try to reduce or eliminate the effects of the disturbances. When controllers are 
holding controlled variables at fixed setpoints they are said to be in regulator or 
disturbance rejection mode.
•	 Process don’t suddenly start at their flowsheet conditions, they don’t shut down 
on their own and don’t change production rate, etc without active intervention 
from control systems. When these major changes are being made to a process, the 
controllers will be acting in a setpoint tracking or servo mode. In servo mode, a 
controller will be trying to make the controlled variable track a moving setpoint.
•	 Control systems also have a major part to play in process safety. The basic control 
system will usually ensure that the process stays within acceptable limits and will 
be equipped with alarms to warn operators of any problems. Interlocks may also 
be present in the basic system. These are used to lock particular inputs when other 
conditions are in existence. For example, the access doors to a kiln may be locked 
by a control system if the internal temperature is dangerously high. In extreme 
circumstances, special control systems (called safety instrumented systems or SIS ) that 
are separate from the normal process control system may come into play. These 
may be local to a particular piece of equipment, for example a high-temperature 
trip on a pump motor; or may have a process or plant-wide focus, for example an 
emergency shutdown system.

Introduction
•	 Finally, good control saves money. Plants are normally operated close to constraints 
(e.g. the acceptable product quality). Poor control means more variability and 
this means that the mean value of a controlled variable needs to be held further 
from the constraint than is necessary with good control. Figure 2 shows a simple 
example – the tops quality from a distillation column. This may have a limit on 
the lowest acceptable composition and it’s the responsibility of the control system 
to hold the composition about this limit. If the control is poor and there’s lots of 
variability, then it will be necessary to set an average value of composition much 
higher than if good control is used. This higher average composition will lead to 
increased reflux going down the column and hence more vapour having to be 
generated by the reboiler, which increases steam costs.

INSTRUMENTATION
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Factors involved in selecting instrumentation
•	 Techniques for temperature, pressure, flow and level measurements
The instruments on a chemical plant are the devices used to monitor the important variables 
that allow the condition of the process to be determined. 
2.1	
WHAT IS AN INSTRUMENT?
Transducers or sensors are the primary sensing elements. They are devices that convert some 
physical quantity that we want to measure (e.g. temperature, pressure, etc). into some sort 
of signal that can be processed further. For example, a thermocouple converts a temperature 
difference into a voltage; a piezo resistive pressure sensor converts a pressure into a change 
in electrical resistance.

Instrumentation
Signal conditioning is the signal processing that is applied to the output of the transducer. 
Sometimes this could simply be amplification, but often more complicated things like 
linearisation are required (ideally, the output of a device should change linearly with changes 
in the quantity being measured). Modern instruments such as Coriolis flowmeters have very 
complicated signal processing build into them to detect the phase shifts in the motion of 
the sensing elements.
A transmitter is a device that converts the output from signal conditioning into a signal 
that is compatible with the communication system being used in the plant. There are many 
different standards in use ranging from 4-20mA analogue signals up to digital Fieldbus 
systems – these will be discussed later.
An instrument is a device that contains at least one but usually more, and often all of 
the above (transducer, signal conditioning and transmitter). An instrument is a complete 
measurement package that senses the quantity to be measured and presents that measurement 
in a form suitable for use (e.g. a simple instrument might be a Bourdon gauge for pressure 
measurement – the transducer, a helical metal tube, distorts with pressure and drives the 
gauge needle directly; a more typical instrument for modern chemical plants might be a 
packaged RTD (resistance temperature device) – it will include the RTD, signal conditioning, 
and a transmitter).
2.2	
FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN SELECTING AN INSTRUMENT
2.2.1	 RANGE
The range of an instrument is range of the measured quantity over which the instrument 
will give a reliable output. The range is always the same or bigger than the span of an 
instrument. While an instrument with a large range might seem to be always desirable this 
isn’t usually the case in practice. The sensitivity (change in output vs change in measurement) 
of transducers drops significantly in large range devices leading to reduced accuracy.
2.2.2	 SPAN
The span of an instrument is an adjustable parameter (there will be a button, screw or 
software link on the instrument that will allow the adjustment). The span is the distance 
the measured quantity has to move to drive the instrument output from its minimum value 
to its maximum (remember that instrument outputs match communication standards which 
have fixed maximum and minimum values). By adjusting the span, the instrument’s sensitivity 
(output change vs. input change) can be altered – large spans will lead to lower sensitivities.

Instrumentation
2.2.3	 ACCURACY AND PRECISION
All measurement instruments are subject to random error – if you take repeated measurements 
of a fixed quantity you will always get a scatter of values about a mean. An accurate 
instrument is one where the mean is centred close to the actual value of the quantity being 
measured. An instrument can be accurate, but still have a significant amount of error on an 
individual measurement – the accurate mean can only be obtained by taking many repeat 
measurements. A precise instrument is one which, when measuring a constant quantity, 
returns output values which are very close to one another – the scatter between readings 
is small. It is possible for an instrument to be precise (high repeatability in measurement) 
but not accurate (with the mean some distance away from the true value of the quantity 
being measured). An ideal instrument is one which is both precise and accurate.
Figure 3 – accuracy and precision
2.2.4	 REPEATABILITY AND DRIFT
In most instruments repeatability and precision mean the same thing. However, some sensors 
suffer from hysteresis. In these sensors the measurement is affected by what the variable being 
measured was doing prior to the measurement. It is most prevalent in systems which involve 
some sort of mechanical element in their sensing. For example, bourdon pressure sensors 
usually exhibit hysteresis – the measurement they produce will be different if the pressure 
was rising or falling immediately prior to the measurement.
Drift is a medium to long term effect that causes some instruments to lose mainly accuracy, but 
also possibly precision. For example, corrosion of a thermocouple will alter its thermoelectric 
properties and hence the voltage produced at a particular temperature.

2.2.5	 DELAY
Some instruments can take time to develop a measurement after the process is ‘sampled’. An 
example of these are chemical analysers – some of these are, in effect, automated analytical 
laboratories that can take several minutes to develop an output. Any delay in measurements 
for control can cause problems to a control system – the controller is looking at the process 
as it was some time in the past rather than where it is at present.
In addition to delay, the instrument’s speed of response needs to be taken into account. 
A large resistance thermometer sensor will take much longer to respond to temperature 
changes than a tiny thermistor (this is simply because of the relative thermal capacities).
2.2.6	 LINEARITY
Almost all commercial control systems are based around linear control algorithms and work 
best when controlling linear or nearly linear systems (a linear system is one where doubling 
a change in the input will produce double the effect on the output). Some transducers (e.g. 
orifice plates (see figure 4) and thermistors) produce outputs that are not linearly related to 
the quantity being measured. In modern instruments these signals will be linearised internally 
in the instrument, but high transducer non-linearity will reduce sensitivity in some areas.

Instrumentation

2.2.7	 CALIBRATION
Calibration involves matching the instrument’s span and zero to the quantity being measured. 
This will involve two or more standard measurements being made (for example, a pH meter 
would be calibrated using several standard buffer solutions) and the instrument adjusted. 
Calibration is a time consuming and sometimes difficult process.
Many packaged instruments, such as RTDs and pressure instruments, are factory calibrated 
and can be installed directly into the process. Others, like orifice plates, need to be calibrated 
in the field after installation. Some instruments, like pH meters, suffer from regular drift 
and need to be recalibrated on a routine basis.
2.2.8	 NOISE
Noise is a random variation in the measurement signal. Noise can be generated by the 
process itself (e.g. by bubbles in the flow being measured by an orifice plate) or it can be 
generated in the measuring instrument or communication lines. If instrument generated 
noise is significant, then it’s better to pick the instrument that generates the least (see 
accuracy and precision above).
2.2.9	 RELIABILITY
Instrumentation in a chemical plant needs to be highly reliable. The measurements are 
used for control and ensure the safe operation of the process. Reliability specifications are 
usually provided on instrument data sheets and are often quoted as the mean time between 
failures (MTBF). This data can be incorporated into a hazard analysis to decide whether 
instrument redundancy is required.

Instrumentation
2.2.10	SUITABILITY FOR PLANT
The instrument must be capable of tolerating the physical conditions (e.g. temperature, 
pressure, vibration, etc.) that it will be exposed to and also be resistant to any chemical 
it is likely to come into contact with. The instrument should also be compatible in an 
engineering sense with the rest of the plant – it should use similar thread sizes, flanges, 
etc, to other plant fittings and also have similar service (e.g. power supplies or instrument 
air) requirements to other plant devices. Finally, many companies tend to limit the number 
of suppliers they purchase from. This allows them to negotiate better deals and also allows 
more extensive stocks of spare parts to be kept.
2.2.11	COST
A cheap purchase price is not usually the best indicator of a good instrument choice. The 
overall lifetime cost needs to be considered – more expensive instruments might last longer 
and require less frequent calibration.
2.2.12	BELLS AND WHISTLES
Since cheap microprocessors have come on the scene many instruments have a host of 
added features, such as averaging and storage of previous values. These are only useful if you 
actually plan to use them, but otherwise should be ignored when selecting an instrument.
2.3	
INSTRUMENTS FOR TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT
Temperature measurement is one of the four most common measurements in a chemical 
plant (the others are pressure, flow, and level). 
2.3.1	 THERMOCOUPLES
A thermocouple is a sensor made from two wires with dissimilar thermo-electric properties 
(i.e. heat liberates electrons to different extents). The wires are joined at each end and a 
small voltage is generated (by the Seebeck Effect) which is proportional to the difference 
between the temperature at the two ends of the device

Originally, the cold end of a thermocouple was kept at a constant temperature by sticking 
it in an ice and water bath. Nowadays, the cold junction is simulated by an electronic chip 
containing a thermistor and some fancy electronics. The electronics also amplify the mV 
output of the thermocouple to something which is more usable in the rest of the instrument.
It’s still possible to buy thermocouple wire (with two strands of dissimilar metals) for special 
applications, but the majority of industrial thermocouples are sold as packaged units with 
a transmitter attached (for example see figure 6). 
Different types of thermocouple are available that cover different ranges and have different 
applications – see table 1.

2.3.2	 RESISTANCE TEMPERATURE DETECTORS (RTDS)
An RTD, or resistance thermometer, is a device that uses a sensor whose resistance changes 
with temperature. The most common type of process measurement RTD is a device with a 
Platinum or Platinum alloy sensor (for stability) whose resistance increases with temperature 
(as it is a conductor). Thermistors are semi-conductor based temperature sensors whose 
resistance decreases as the temperature increases. The change is much less linear than that 
achieved by the Plantinum RTDs and the overall accuracy of temperature measurement is 
also much less. However, thermistors can be made to be very small, and hence very fast, 
and are often used in applications where very fast temperature measurement is required 
(e.g. they are used to detect vortices in some vortex shedding flowmeters).
The sensor elements in Platinum RTDs only generate a change in electrical resistance, and 
this needs to be measured by a bridge circuit. It’s very difficult to buy a platinum sensor 
on its own – most RTDs are complete packages consisting of sensor, signal conditioning 
and transmitter (figure 6). The sensing element in an Pt RTD is bigger than that in a 
thermocouple, and so RTDs are a bit slower. They are also more expensive. However, Pt 
RTDs are more accurate and considerably more stable than thermocouples and are now the 
usual choice for temperature measurement between -200oC and 500oC. 
2.4	
PRESSURE MEASUREMENT
Pressure measurement is very important in chemical plant both as a fundamental measurement, 
and also as an implied measurement of flowrate and level. Pressure measurement can be 
classed into four main categories:
1.	Gauge pressure. The pressure above the local atmospheric pressure (which changes 
according to altitude and weather conditions). If the instrument isn’t connected to 
a pressure source, it will read zero. Pressures below the local atmospheric may be 
registered as negative pressures, if the instrument is configured to do this.
2.	Absolute pressure. The instrument measures the absolute pressure – it will always 
generate some reading (except in a complete vacuum). Pressures below atmospheric 
will be registered as positive absolute pressures.
3.	Vacuum. Sometimes used in vacuum systems. The pressure below local atmospheric 
pressure is measured. (e.g. if local atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia, an absolute 
pressure of 10.7psia will be measured as -4 psig on a gauge pressure device, and 
4psi vacuum on a vacuum measuring device.
4.	Differential pressure. The pressure instrument has two measurement ports and 
measure the pressure difference between them. DP devices can be used as a part 
of flow and level measurement systems.

2.4.1	 BOURDON TUBES
These were the basis of the pressure gauges we’re used to seeing on old movies with steam 
engines, etc, and used to be common on chemical plant. The sensing element is simply a 
coiled metal tube – pressure increases inside the tube cause an ‘unrolling’ force and this is 
used to drive the pointer on the gauge. Although cheap and still used on portable devices 
(e.g. car tire inflators), they are not popular in chemical plant applications as it’s awkward 
to get a signal suitable for transmission to a remote location (the control room).

Nowadays pressure sensors are normally bought ‘packaged’ in a small instrument that includes 
the sensor, signal conditioning and a transmitter (e.g. 4-20mA). Several different types of 
sensor are available, the two most common are:
•	 Piezoresistive. The sensing element is a ‘diaphragm’ of semi-conductor material. When 
the element is subjected to pressure, the diaphragm deforms and the movement is 
detected as a resistance change in the material.

•	 Capacitance. In these instruments, one side of an electrical capacitor is formed 
by a diaphragm that is exposed to the pressure to be measured. As the diaphragm 
deforms, the pressure is measured by the change in capacitance
Modern sensors are available for all pressure measurement applications. Those used for 
differential pressure measurement are usually called DP Cells.

FLOW MEASUREMENT
Flow measurement is an area where the effect of changes in technology are most noticeable. 
Up until a few years ago almost all flow measurement was carried out using differential 
pressure devices (mainly orifice plates) but now a much larger ranges of flowmeters are 
commonly used.
2.5.1	 DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE DEVICES (ORIFICE PLATES, NOZZLES AND 
VENTURI METERS
Figure 9 – Orifice plate (from 1871!)
Orifice plates are essentially a plate with a hole in the centre which is fitted between the 
flanges at a pipe junction. The flow through the pipe can be estimated by measuring the 
differential pressure over the orifice. There is a considerable subtlety in the design of the 
orifice plate itself (e.g. the ratio of the hole to the pipe, the entrance and exit shape of the 
hole), the positioning of pressure trappings (particularly the downstream trapping which 
should be as near to the vena contracta – the place where the diameter of the streamlines 
is least – as possible) and finally the position of the orifice plate itself (it needs to be a 
reasonable distance from things that cause significant disruption to flow patterns – bends, 
pumps, valves, etc.). There is a British Standard (BS EN ISO 5167) for the design of orifice 
plate (and nozzle and venturi meters) installations.

Orifice plates used to be the standard method of measuring flowrates (both gases and liquids) 
in process plants and probably still represent the biggest number of installed flowmeters. 
However, they are no longer the first choice for new installations as alternatives which avoid 
the problems with orifice plates are now available at reasonable cost. The main problems 
with orifice plates are:
•	 The orifice plate needs to be sited carefully – flow disturbances need to be avoided.
•	 Measurements are subject to significant noise when the process stream contains 
bubbles or solid particles.
•	 The orifice will be eroded causing measurement drift over time, particularly if the 
stream contains abrasive particles.
•	 The orifice can become clogged, seriously affecting the measurement.
•	 The orifice plate causes a significant, unrecoverable, pressure drop – wasted energy.
•	 Each orifice plate needs to be carefully calibrated in situ for accurate measurement 
(although often correlations are used in place of calibration, but this produces only 
approximate measurements of flow).
•	 The turndown ratio (the maximum reliable flow measurement divided by the 
minimum), or rangeability, is poor compared to more modern types of flowmeter.

Nozzle and venturi meters are Differential Pressure (DP) meters like the orifice plate, 
although they have lower unrecoverable pressure drops. They are however, very rarely used 
in chemical plant applications.
2.5.2	 VORTEX METERS
Figure 10 – vortex meter
Vortex meters work by inserting a shaped body into the flowpath of the fluid. When this 
is done alternating, swirling, vortices are shed from the back of the body. The frequency 
at which these vortices are shed is directly related to the fluid velocity. In the vortex meter 
the vortices are detected by temperature or pressure sensors built into the device.
Vortex meters have a good turndown ratio (typically 20:1), low pressure drop and high 
reliability. They also have a stable long term accuracy and repeatability.
Disadvantages are that they are not suitable for low flow velocities and care needs to be 
taken in their placement to avoid flow stream disturbances (just like orifice plates).

2.5.3	 CORIOLIS METERS
The Coriolis effect was first discovered by the 19th century mathematician Gustav-Gaspard 
Coriolis. He was concerned with the forces on a body moving from the equator towards 
the poles of the Earth. At the equator, the rotational speed of the Earth is just over 1,000 
miles per hour in a West to East direction and everything at the equator that is ‘stationary’ 
with respect to the surface has this rotational speed too. At the poles the rotational speed 
drops to zero. This means that bodies moving North from the equator will tend to deflect 
to the East and those moving South to the West.
To hold the body on a directly Northward (or Southward) path, a force (the Coriolis force) 
is required to decelerate the body to the local rotational speed. The Coriolis Effect plays 
an important part in weather systems and is popularly claimed (wrongly) to determine the 
direction water goes down a plughole in the Northern and Southern hemispheres!
 Figure 11 – operation of a coriolis meter
In a Coriolis flowmeter the effect is used by passing the fluid whose flow is to be measured 
through a tube that is oscillated in a limited rotary axis. As the fluid moves through the 
tube it goes from zero to maximum rotational velocity in one half of the tube and then 
from maximum to zero rotational velocity in the other half. This produces two Coriolis 
forces which produce a twisting force on the tube. This twisting gives a measure of the 
mass flowrate of the liquid in the tube.
Coriolis flowmeters measure mass flowrate rather than velocity or volumetric flowrate. However, 
they can also be made to measure fluid density (by finding the resonant frequency of the 
tube), allowing volumetric flowrate to be estimated too. They have a very high turndown 
ratio (typically 100:1) and have high accuracy and repeatability. Although they normally 
have a low pressure drop, they can have problems with very viscous fluids. They also rely on 
moving parts (the tube) and electromagnets to drive the motion, so there may be questions 
about reliability (although there seems to be no data on this at present).

LEVEL MEASUREMENT
The measurement and control of liquid levels within a chemical plant is one of the most 
important functions of the instrumentation. Liquid level controllers maintain the overall process 
mass balance and also maintain liquid seals (to prevent vapour going where it shouldn’t).

2.6.1	 DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE MEASUREMENT
Figure 12 – DP cell for level measurement
A very common way of measuring liquid levels is to use a differential pressure instrument. 
One end (the ‘high’ pressure connection) is connected to a tapping near the bottom of the 
vessel, and the other to a tapping near the top. It’s important that the top tapping is in the 
vapour space above the liquid. The differential pressure is a measure of the hydrostatic head 
in the vessel. If the density of the liquid is known, then the level can be easily obtained. 
One problem with this setup, if the fluid contains solids or is likely to form solids, is that the 
pressure tapping can become clogged with solid material. If the clog is partial the instrument 
response will become slower and slower, and if it clogs completely no measurement will 
be possible.
2.6.2	 CAPACITANCE MEASUREMENT
This type of level measurement uses a long probe which is inserted into the tank as one 
side of an electrical capacitor, and another conductor (usually the metal wall of the vessel) 
as the other. As the liquid level in the vessel rises, the measured capacitance will change 
and this can be calibrated to provide a measurement of the liquid level.

Figure 13 – capacitance level meter
Capacitance measurement is very subject to errors caused by changes in the electrical 
properties of the liquid or coating of the vessel or probe. It is no longer very popular in 
the process industries. Another new, but similar, technique called Radio-Frequency (RF) 
admittance is however growing in popularity.
2.6.3	 ULTRASONIC AND RADAR MEASUREMENT
Figure 14 – ultrasonic/radar level measurement
Ultrasonic and microwave measurement devices use a transmitter element which sends 
either an ultrasound or radar signal into the vessel from its top. The signal bounces off the 
liquid surface and is detected by a receiver. The distance between the unit and the liquid 
surface is obtained from the time lag between transmission and receipt of the return signal.
Both types of device are independent of liquid density. Ultrasonic devices can be fooled by 
dense foam layers that deaden the sound signal. Both types of device are expensive compared 
to other level measurement methods, but radar devices are more expensive than ultrasound.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
The measurement of composition is one of the most desired, but also most difficult and 
expensive, measurements that have to be made in chemical and process plants. Composition 
is not just important in reactors, but also in separations like distillation columns, flash 
chambers, membrane units, etc.

The most common use of pH measurement is probably in waste treatment where it is

also important inside many process units to encourage particular reactions or to prevent 
(or encourage) precipitation of particular materials.

The standard method of measuring pH is using a pH electrode. Those used in industry have 
to be much more rugged than those used in standard laboratory applications and often the 
electrode will have to be chosen to suit the particular process conditions. Generally, you’d 
buy the pH device as a self-contained transmitter – the signal from the device would match 
your instrumentation system (e.g. 4-20mA, digital, etc).
2.7.2	 CHEMICAL ANALYSERS
Although science fiction TV shows have devices like ‘Tricorders’ that produce complete 
chemical analyses at the touch of a button, real analysers aren’t quite there yet. 
The first difference is that most analysers need to sample the material to be analysed. This 
involves piping, valves, pumps and control gear that carry out the sampling process. Sampling 
also introduces dead-time (time delay) into any measurement, and significant dead-time 
causes all sorts of problems for feedback controllers.
Once the sample has been taken there are a variety of approaches to obtaining an analysis. 
However, the analyser is always designed to analyse for particular materials – they aren’t 
general purpose. This means that an analyser has to be designed and calibrated for a particular 
application which pushes the price up substantially. Some of the techniques used include 
‘wet’ analysis (where the analyser is a little automated lab); chromatography; and modern 
methods like: NIR, MIR, UV-visible, Raman scattering, Fluorescence, NMR, Microwave, 
Acoustic, and Mass spectrometry techniques.
2.7.3	 LABORATORY ANALYSIS AND INFERENTIAL CONTROL
Due to the cost and other problems with on-line chemical analysers, they are not very 
commonly used. This is beginning to change as new analyser technology is developed, but 
for now the most common way of dealing with control of compositions is to use periodic 
laboratory analysis coupled with inferential control. The idea of inferential control is that 
we can use other measurements from a process to infer the compositions. The simplest 
systems use just a single measurement (e.g. using a measurement of a tray temperature 
near the top of a distillation column to infer the tops composition), but others use several 
measurements combined using some sort of process model (e.g. using a tray temperature, 
a pressure measurement, and a knowledge of the equilibrium data to infer the tops 
composition). All inferential systems make assumptions about the process (e.g. about the 
ratios of the different components) and need to be corrected using periodic (once or twice 
a shift) laboratory analysis.

COMMUNICATION SIGNALS
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Analogue communications
•	 Digital communications
•	 How to convert between signals and engineering units
Process control systems are information processing systems. They gather information about the 
process state from the instruments, then use this to decide what to do to move the process 
to a desired state, and then send information to the various final control elements (usually 
control valves) to produce the desired changes in the process. To handle this information 
there needs to be a means for moving it from the instruments to the controllers and then 
onto the final control elements. This is where process communications come in.
3.1	
TYPES OF COMMUNICATION SIGNAL
There are a number of different sorts of signal that can exist in a process control communications 
system. Some plants may have just one type, but most have a mixture of different sorts of 
signal moving around the system.
3.1.1	 ANALOGUE SIGNALS
Analogue signals are continuous and capable of taking any value at all within the range 
between their maximum and minimum values. They are called analogue signals because the 
level of the communication signal is directly analogous to the value that is being transmitted.
3.1.1.1  Pneumatic signals
Pneumatics are the oldest form of communication signal used for remote monitoring and 
automatic control in chemical plant. A pneumatic communication signal is an air pressure 
between 3 and 15 psig (the 3 psi offset zero allows tube breaks or malfunctioning instruments 
to be detected). The signal is carried in small diameter (about 10mm) metal tubes. As the 
tube length increases, a significant dynamic lag develops as it takes time for the signal 
generator (instrument or controller) to add enough air to increase the tube pressure to the 
desired value. This limits the practical length of communication tube runs, and means that 
plants using this form of communication have to have a number of local control rooms 
near to the site of the instruments.
Pneumatic communications are now obsolete, but may still be present in some very old 
processing plants.

3.1.1.2  Current loops
The most common type of analogue signal used in chemical plant is the 4-20mA current 
loop. The instruments/controllers using this communication system send an electrical current 
around a loop between the transmitter and receiver. This is a better communication signal 
than a voltage as it is independent of the length of the communication line. If a voltage 
signal was to be used there would be some voltage loss in the communication wire, and 
this would increase with line length. With a current loop, the transmitter simply increases 
the transmission voltage until the current around the loop matches the desired signal. In 
theory, 4-20mA signals can be carried on two wires (or even one if a common earth is 
used), but communication cables often include additional wires for power supplies and so 
three and four wire cable is common. The signal wires will be electrically shielded (with 
the shielding earthed) or twisted into a twisted pair to reduce the effects of electrical noise.

3.1.2	 DISCRETE SIGNALS
Chemical plants are full of devices that can only exist in only one of a limited number 
(often just two) of states (e.g. OFF or ON). Examples are switches for motors, pumps, 
agitators, etc, and also ‘instrument’ switches like level and temperature trips.
There is no universal standard for discrete signals, but 0 and 24V are often used to indicate 
two states.
3.1.3	 DIGITAL SIGNALS
Digital communications convert the value to be transmitted into a number and then send 
this number down the communication line. Since only one number can be transmitted 
at a time, digital communications are not continuous, but are sampled. The information 
from a digital communications line is like a series of snapshots of the state of the quantity 
being measured.
Digital signals are transmitted as binary numbers with voltages representing the two binary 
values (0 and 1). The most common voltages used are 0V for 0 and 5V for 1, but other 
voltages are used for the ‘1’ digit. The number of digits in the binary number that is 
transmitted depends on the electronics that have been selected, and affects the resolution 
of the value. Older systems used 8-bit analogue to digital convertors and so produced 8-bit 
numbers, which limited the resolution of the signal to one part in 256 (28). Modern systems 
use 12 or 16-bit convertors, giving resolutions of 1:4096 and 1:65,536 respectively.

3.1.5	 PARALLEL AND SERIES TRANSMISSION
There are two ways of transmitting a digital signal: in parallel or in series. Parallel 
communications have a signal line for each bit of the binary signal plus a number of extra 
lines for communication control purposes (so a 16 bit parallel communications line will 
have more than 16 wires). Serial digital communications transmits the binary digits (bits) 
in series, one after the other. There are always additional control bits before and after the 
digits of the number being transmitted, but all the digits are transmitted serially. This means 
that serial communications can be carried out with as little a two wires (or even one, if a 
common earth is used). Parallel communications are much faster, but the number of wires 
required economically limit the length of cables to very sort runs. Although slower, the 
speed of serial communications has increased dramatically in the last decade and is it is 
now the default type of digital communications for most applications.

Although digital signals have to be sampled and don’t give a continuous picture of what’s 
going on, this isn’t a particular problem in chemical plants since the sample intervals are 
normally many times less than the speeds of response involved in chemical plant operations. 
Digital communications also have considerable advantages over analogue communications. 
For analogue communications, there needs to be an individual cable connecting a particular 
transmitter to its receiver. If a plant has 100 instruments, then there needs to be 100 cables 
run back from the plant to the control room. With digital communications, this doesn’t 
have to be the case. The digital communication can also be made to include an address 
of the instrument to be communicated with. This allows a single cable to be used to link 
multiple transmitters with multiple receivers. Digital communications also allow richer 
communication to take place between devices. As well as transmitting the value of the 
quantity being measured an instrument can send other information, such as the last time 
it was calibrated, or the rate of change of the measurement, etc. The line can also be used 
to communicate in the other direction, for example the controller can use the comms line 
to tell the instrument to run self-diagnostics.

3.1.6	 PROCESS PLANT DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS
There are a number of different digital communications standards in use in the chemical 
industries at the moment. Unfortunately, many of these standards are not interchangeable, 
and this means that it is often necessary to stick to a single supplier if digital communications 
are used.
3.1.6.1  HART communications
HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) http://www.hartcomm.org/index.html is 
a half-way house between analogue communications and full digital comms. HART can be 
retrofitted to existing 4-20mA lines, and superimposes a digital signal on top of the analogue 
communications (just like home broadband rides on top of an analogue telephone signal – 
using the phone doesn’t stop the broadband working). The digital signal can be used to 
provide two way communications between an instrument and central controller. This can be 
used for a number of purposes, e.g. device configuration; diagnostics and troubleshooting; 
accessing other measurement information. HART can also be used to convert a 4-20mA 
line into a multidrop line. In this configuration multiple 4-20mA devices can communicate 
over the same cable – they share time on the cable and this sharing is controlled by the 
HART protocol. 
3.1.6.2  Fieldbus
Fieldbus is the generic name given to a number of standards that have developed since the 
1990s. The latest iteration of the standards is Foundation Fieldbus http://www.fieldbus.org/ 
which now has the largest installed base of all the standards. Fieldbus is a standard for fully 
digital plant communications. Fieldbus makes use of serial digital lines(called buses) that 
are linked to multiple devices. Each device attached to a bus has an address, and can be 
talked to by prefacing any instructions with the device address. When a controller wants a 
measurement from an instrument on a fieldbus, the following sequence occurs
1.	The controller sends a message to the instrument (prefaced with the instrument’s 
bus address) with the instruction to send a measurement.
2.	The instrument takes the measurement and then sends a message to the controller 
(prefaced with the controller’s address) which contains the measurement that was 
asked for.
Devices continuously monitor the bus, but only respond to messages with their address.

3.1.6.3  Ethernet
Ethernet is the name given to a family of standards used for office computer networks. Until 
relatively recently it hasn’t been considered for process plant control systems, as it was felt 
that these required much higher integrity than office based systems. However, the much 
larger installed base means that Ethernet technology moves faster than specialised process 
systems and is also much cheaper. It is probable that Ethernet based process control systems 
will become much more common in the near future.
3.1.6.4  Wireless communications 
Wireless communications are starting to be adopted in some process industry applications. 
They have the advantage that they do not require wiring between the instrument and 
controller, which makes them suitable for distant or exposed locations (e.g. on offshore 
installations). They do require to be placed carefully to ensure that there is a good signal, and 
can be subject to interference (e.g. someone could park a lorry in front of the transmitter!)

FINAL CONTROL ELEMENTS
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Air-to-open and Air-to-close valves
•	 Control valve sizing and valve characteristics
Final control elements are the devices that take the output signal from a controller (which 
is a flow of information in some form) and converts it into something that can physically 
influence the behaviour of the plant (the manipulation). By far the most common final 
control element in the process industries is the control valve, but others such as conveyor 
belt speed controllers, or agitator speed controls are sometimes used.
4.1	
CONTROL VALVES
The most common type of valve used for control purposes is the globe valve. It’s called a 
globe valve because the valve body is usually fairly spherical and looks like a globe. The 
valve stem is a metal rod that runs down through the valve, and attached to its end is the 
valve plug. The stem is capable of moving up and down and, as it does so, it moves the plug 
away and towards the valve seat. The plug and seat of the valve are very carefully machined 
components and give the valve its characteristic; the relationship between the stem position 
and flow through the valve.

Final control elements
Most control valves are pneumatically driven. Air is allowed to flow into a chamber with a 
diaphragm which is driven against a spring to move the valve stem. When the air pressure 
is released, the spring pushes the stem back towards its original position. The pressure of 
the air that drives the valve is set remotely (usually by a controller) and the communication 
signal is converted to an air pressure by a device near the valve itself.
Figure 16 – air to open/close valves
Control valves can be configured (sometimes by simply flipping over the actuator assembly) 
as air-to-open (fail closed ) or air-to-close (fail open). The choice is entirely dependent on 
what’s best for process safety. Control valves need a supply of special clean, dry, air called 
instrument air. If this fails, then there is a potential for a common mode failure that will 
affect multiple control valves. If this happens, then it is important that the valves will fail 
in a direction that will put the process into a safe state. For example, if a valve is used to 
regulate the cooling water supply for an exothermic reactor, then it makes sense to use an 
air-to-close valve (on air failure the valve will go full open). Conversely, a valve manipulating 
the steam to a distillation column reboiler will usually be air-to-open, so that the steam is 
shut off on an air failure.

CONTROL VALVE SIZING
Sizing a control valve doesn’t just mean choosing couplings that fit with the rest of the 
pipework – much more importantly the internals (valve plug and seat) need to be sized 
to give a valve that is appropriate to the application. An undersized control valve won’t be 
able to pass the correct flowrate. An oversized control valve may not be able to be turned 
down sufficiently to give good control of the process. It is important that valves are correctly 
sized for their application.
The basic valve sizing equation (for Fisher Valves) for liquids is:
G

x
C
Q
v
∆
=
)
(
where	 	
Q = volumetric flowrate through valve (US gallons/minute)
	
	
Cv(x) = valve coefficient (different for different valves and stem positions ‘x’). 
Obtained from valve manufacturers tables
	
	
ΔP = Pressure drop over valve (psi)
	
	
G = Specific gravity of liquid (water at 60oF=1.0)
The equation is based on water and the actual flowrate may be different if the fluid viscosity 
is significantly different from water at the test conditions. Valve manufacturers provide 
various ways for compensating for this.
Equations for valve sizing are also available for compressible and two phase flow.

The characteristic or trim of a valve is a description of how the flowrate through the valve 
changes with stem position. There are three common valve characteristics: linear ; quick-
opening; equal percentage. The valve characteristic is altered by choosing different designs of 
valve plug and seat from lists in manufacturers catalogues.
The linear trim is the easiest to appreciate. In this characteristic if the pressure drop over 
the valve is constant then the flow through the valve increases linearly with the stem 
position. The quick opening characteristic is for use in applications where high flow is 
required quickly – small initial movements of the stem as the valve opens produce large 
increases in the flowrate. The equal percentage is the least obvious of the characteristics – 
a percentage change in the stem position will produce an equal percentage change in the 
flowrate through the valve.
The reason that equal percentage characteristics are often used is to do with the installed 
characteristic of the valve. Valves only represent part of the process piping and hence part 
of the pressure drop – to accurately predict how a valve will respond in service we need to 
calculate the installed characteristic.

It’s easy to these equations into a spreadsheet, and that’s how I’ve created this example. 
First of all let’s look at a design where most of the pressure drop in the system is over the 
control valve. To do this I’ve set the pipework Cv to 5.
Let’s use a linear characteristic:

Figure 18 – Comparison of characteristics for a linear valve with equal Delta P
As you can see, the installed characteristic is slightly different from the valve on its own, 
but it still follows a roughly linear relationship. This is desirable as we would usually like 
the flowrate to increase approximately linearly with stem position.
Now, let’s look at what happens when the pressure drop over the valve is normally only 
a small fraction of the overall pressure drop. To generate the curves, I’ve set the pipework 
CV to be equal to 0.5 (roughly a third of that of the control valve at nominal conditions):

Figure 19 – comparison with low valve Delta P
You can see that the valve now behaves very differently when it is installed in the pipework. 
The installed characteristic is now very far away from linear and looks like a quick-opening 
valve. This is a big problem since it’s usually a good idea to minimise the pressure drop over 
the valve as far as possible – pressure drop over the valve is wasted energy.

Let’s now look at what happens with an equal percentage valve. I’ve generated some equal 
percentage CVs in the table below (NB the CV values here have just been generated for 
the example – they are not general and you need to check valve tables for real values). I’ve 
generated the coefficients so that the valve produces the same flow as the linear valve at 
maximum opening.

drop, an equal percentage valve produces an installed characteristic that is much closer to 
the ideal line.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL

Final control elements
Pressure drop over a control valve is wasted energy and you’d normally want to keep it 
as low as practicable. For most installations, therefore, at nominal flows the pressure drop 
over the control valve will be only a small part of the overall pressure drop, and an equal 
percentage valve will normally be chosen. The exception is where the pipework pressure 
drop is unusually small (e.g. in short lengths of pipe): in these cases linear characteristics 
will produce the best results. Quick opening characteristics are normally only used in on-
off control systems.
In real situations, where the control valve is placed at the outlet of a centrifugal pump, the 
installed characteristic is also affected by the pump curve (the relationship between discharge 
pressure and delivered flow). In real life, specifying a control valve isn’t simple!
4.2.2	 SIZING CONTROL VALVES (ONE METHOD)
1.	Identify what the valve is to do. What’s the fluid, the nominal flowrate, the flowrate 
range, the pipe size and the pressure drop available? The pressure drop over the 
valve should normally be around 25–40% of the total, but can go down to 15% in 
long lines. Care needs to be taken if there is a possibility of flashing or cavitation.
2.	Calculate the valve CV required to pass the desired nominal flow.
3.	Look through the valve sizing charts and find the size that gives the desired CV 
when the valve is about 60–70% open (it’s necessary to allow some movement 
either side of the nominal flow for control)
4.	Calculate the installed characteristic for the valve. Ideally the maximum flow through 
the system should be around 1.4 times the nominal (this is a rule-of-thumb so 
treat it with caution!). The minimum flow that is expected operationally should be 
achieved when the valve is more that 10% open – flowrates through a valve at low 
openings (less than 10%) tend to be quite variable. (Note: control valves are not 
designed to shut off flows – there is always leakage. There needs to be an additional 
stop valve in the line if it is desired to close the line completely).

A P&I diagram contains much more detail than a PFD. The P&ID will contain ALL of the 
piping in the process, including things like drain lines and vents. The diagram will show 
all of the valves (including stop and check valves) and other pipefittings (like strainers). All 
of the instruments and control loops will be shown and also details of alarms and other 
emergency control system components.
The P&I diagram is a proper engineering tool. It is used for HAZOP studies before the 
plant is built and is an important tool during the design and commissioning stages. P&I 
diagrams are also available to plant engineers (they are often kept in the control room) 
who have to maintain and develop the plant once it is running (although P&I diagrams 
on operating plant can quickly get out of date and have to be checked before use).
5.2.1	 SHOWING INSTRUMENTATION ON A P&ID
 Figure 23 – a P&ID control system device
The standard method of showing instruments on a P&ID is to show the device inside a 
device bubble. Inside the bubble is the devices tag name, which consists of two parts: a tag 
identifier that gives information about what kind of instrument is being referred to; and 
a tag number, which is used to identify the particular instrument. Attached to the outside 
of the instrument bubble, and connecting it to the other elements of the P&ID are the 
communication lines.

of the vent is a high pressure alarm – this will trigger if the vent is left open. The shell side 
pressure is monitored and displayed at the heat exchanger (PI002). The tube side outlet 
temperature is displayed, recorded and controlled (TCIR001) by a controller over a data

Inputs and outputs in control systems

INPUTS AND OUTPUTS IN 
CONTROL SYSTEMS
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 The difference between process engineering and process control inputs and outputs
•	 Manipulations and disturbances
•	 Controlled and auxiliary outputs
Control systems process information. They gather data about a process from instruments, 
figure out what should be done to move the process to a desired state and then send 
information back to the process to implement the changes. Inputs and outputs, in a control 
sense, are inputs and outputs of information (data) and are quite different to what chemical 
engineers normally understand by these terms.
6.1	
PROCESS INPUTS
There are only two sorts of process input (in control engineering): manipulations and 
disturbances.
A manipulation is an information input to a process that comes from the control system of 
interest. It is usually a signal sent to a valve. The signal will cause the valve to move, which 
will change the flow through the valve and hence change the conditions in the process. 
A disturbance is an input to a process that changes outside of the reach of the control system 
of interest (the control system has no influence over the value of a disturbance input). For 
any process, there will be an almost limitless number of potential disturbances; they can 
arise from a variety of sources, for example:
•	 Raw materials variations (e.g. changes in physical or chemical properties will affect 
the process)
•	 Environmental disturbances (e.g. changes in relative humidity and air temperature 
will affect cooling water temperature).
•	 Disturbances caused by process equipment (e.g. catalyst fouling will change reactor 
reactivity)
•	 Disturbances caused by other control systems (e.g. an upstream controller might 
reduce a flow entering the process).

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL 
FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
56
Inputs and outputs in control systems
The main goal of process plant control systems is to regulate against the effects of these 
disturbance inputs. They do this by making changes to the manipulated inputs to counteract 
the effect of the changes in the disturbance inputs (e.g. if the catalyst in a reactor degrades it 
might be necessary to decrease the flow through the reactor to increase residence time, or the 
temperature might be increased – by changing cooling/heating flows – to increase reactivity).
6.2	
PROCESS OUTPUTS
From a control viewpoint a process output is a flow of information coming from the process; 
they are always the outputs of measuring instruments – there is no other way of getting 
information from the process.
Outputs are also classified into two categories: control variables and auxiliary outputs.
Controlled variables are the outputs of the process that have to be held close to particular 
values (called desired values or setpoints) for the process to be doing what it’s supposed be 
doing. The controlled variables will be attached to controllers that will be trying to hold 
the values of these variables at their setpoints.
Auxiliary variables are additional process outputs that are monitored for a variety of reasons. 
These could be:
•	 To provide more information to operators. Sometimes, particularly in fault conditions, 
extra information helps operators decide what needs to be done.
•	 To provide alternative control variables in special circumstances. Under fault 
conditions, or if a process needs to switch into a different operating mode (e.g. 
when changing product type) some of the existing controlled variables may be 
swapped with auxiliary measurements (the degrees of freedom of a process limit the 
number of things that can be controlled simultaneously).
•	 To provide information for feedforward control. With this type of control, 
information on the current value of disturbances is required. Although a disturbance 
is a process input, any measurement of it is a process output and would be classed 
as an auxiliary output.

PROCESSES IN CONTROL ENGINEERING
A process in control engineering isn’t a sulphuric acid plant, or a distillation column. Instead 
it is something that converts process input information into process output information. 
A process control computer could be disconnected from the process it is controlling and 
reconnected to a simulation and it would continue to operate (and this is the way some are 
tested). The control system is only concerned with the processing of information.
The basic process in control engineering is the single-input/single-output (SISO) system. This 
is a process that converts one input information stream into a single output stream. Most 
real outputs are affected by multiple inputs, producing multi-input/single-output (MISO) 
systems. Real chemical plants have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, with outputs being 
affected by several inputs and inputs influencing several of the outputs, and these are classed 
as multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) systems. As we’ll see later, when linear control system 
analysis is applied we can break MIMO systems into a combination of SISO sub-systems.

MAIN LEARNING POINTS

•	 Controller hardware
•	 Introduction to control loop fault diagnosis
Feedback control is going on everywhere you look. Your own body has a multitude of 
feedback mechanisms that regulate your digestion, blood pressure and heart rate and stop 
you from falling over when you walk. 
The essence of feedback control is that it is the output of the process, the controlled 
variable, which is monitored. If a disturbance enters the process that causes the controlled 
variable to move away from the desired value, the controller sees this and starts to move 
a manipulated variable to try to counteract the effect of the disturbance. The controller 
continues to monitor the output and can see the effect that the changes in the manipulated 
variable are having – the controller can increase the amount of manipulation if the output 
isn’t changing quickly enough, or it can reduce the amount if the output change is too 
fast, or too large.

Introduction to feedback control

Block diagrams are commonly used to illustrate feedback control systems. They can also, 
for linear systems, be used to help analyse control system behaviour through the rules of 
block diagram algebra. In the diagram in figure 27 we have a ‘process’ block on the right 
of the diagram. This represents the process we are trying to control and has a manipulated 
input and disturbance inputs too (if the process is linear, this block could be further broken 
down into a number of SISO blocks). The output of the process block is the controlled 
variable, this is measured by the measurement system and the measurement (the controlled 
value (CV) or measured value (MV)) is fed back to the comparator (part of the controller 
and marked with the Greek letter Σ). The comparator calculates the arithmetic difference 
between the measured value and the desired value, or setpoint (SP), for the controlled variable. 
This difference is called the error (ε). The error signal is then fed to the controller which 
contains a control algorithm, and the output(OP) from the controller is sent to the final 
control element and hence to the process. A continuous loop exists in the system between 
the controller, process and measurement loop – this is called the feedback loop.
Block diagrams are easy to develop directly from P&I diagrams (figure 28).

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACK
A negative feedback system will always try to reduce the size of the error signal. A positive 
feedback system will act to increase the size of the error. Control systems always use 
negative feedback.

CONTROL LOOP PROBLEMS
As you can see from the block diagrams in figure 27 and 28, a feedback control system 
is a system with several interacting components. This is often forgotten about in industry 
and problems concerning poor control are often blamed on the controller. In many cases, 
however, it is another part of the loop that isn’t performing correctly. Controllers nowadays 
are electronic devices and are very reliable. If the loop had been working previously, but has 
now gone faulty, it is much more likely that it’s a component other than the controller that 
is causing the problem. In diagnosing control problems, it is important to check other loop 
elements before touching the controller. Some of the potential loop problem are described 
in the tables below.

DIRECTION OF CONTROL ACTION
All feedback controllers have a switch or button that allows the direction of control action 
to be switched. Usually, the switch is marked with the two possible positions reverse (REV) 
and direct (DIR). A direct acting controller is one whose output will tend to increase as 
the measurement signal increases. A reverse acting controller is one whose output will tend 
to decrease as the measurement signal increases. Why do we need the option to switch the 
direction of action? Consider the level control systems shown in figure 29.
 Figure 29 – level control manipulating inlet
If the valve in the level control loop is air to open, imagine what we’d want to happen if 
the level in the tank (the measurement) started to rise. The controller needs to act to reduce 
this increase in level, and so move the measured level back towards its setpoint. The only 
way it can do this is to reduce the flowrate coming into the tank by altering the position 
of the valve it is connected to. Since the valve is air to open, to get a reduction in flow it 
is necessary to reduce the output of the controller. So, in this configuration an increase in 
the level should lead to a reduction in the controller output – we’d want to set the direction 
switch to reverse acting.
Now consider the system in figure 30.

Introduction to feedback control
 Figure 30 – level control manipulating outlet
This is exactly the same tank, but we are now using the bottom valve as a manipulation. 
In most processes we have multiple manipulations that can affect a particular controlled 
variable, and the task of choosing appropriate pairings isn’t trivial – this will be discussed 
later in the course. For now, let’s think about what happens when the level increases (some 
other control system has opened the top valve). Now we want the exit flow to increase to 
reduce the measured level back towards the desired value. To do this, since we are assuming 
air to open valves, we need to increase the controller output. So, in this case, the direction 
switch should be set to direct acting.
It’s important to remember that the direction of the operation of the control valve needs 
to be taken into account too. If the valves above had been air-to-close (fail open) valves, 
then the direction of control actions would be the opposite of those chosen.
Choosing the wrong direction of control action will convert a control system into a positive 
feedback system. Usually this will be pretty obvious – changing the setpoint will cause 
the process to move in the opposite direction (and usually, depending on the setup of the 
controller, it will keep moving). In slower systems, however, this may not be immediately 
obvious – it’s always worthwhile trying to get the direction right and not rely on trial 
and error.

Introduction to feedback control
Feedback controllers exist in many different forms. The controller in figure 31 is a pneumatic 
controller – it is entirely mechanical and the algorithm is implemented by a complex 
arrangement of nozzles and bellows. Pneumatic controllers used to be widespread throughout 
the chemical industry. With the development of cheap, and more flexible, microelectronics 
they are now very rare. They are sometimes used in potentially flammable atmospheres (since 
they don’t use electricity they are inherently safe) but modern, flammable atmosphere safe, 
controllers are replacing them in this application too. Although the controllers themselves 
are being replaced, the human machine interface (HMI) developed for these controllers 
is still seen in their modern equivalents. The scale on the front (marked 0–100) shows 
the measured value (on the left) and setpoint (on the right). How this was represented 
depended on the controller, there could either be moveable pointers that moved up and 
down the scale, or the pointers could be fixed and the scale could move. This controller 
has a switch on the bottom left marked Man/Auto. In the Man (manual) position, the 
controller algorithm is switched off and the feedback loop is broken. The controller is in 
an open-loop condition and turning the knob on the right (marked ‘Man’) will directly alter 
the controller’s output and hence the position of the valve it is attached to (the output 
is shown on the scale on the bottom part of the faceplate). When the controller is in the 
‘Auto’ condition, the controller algorithm is operational. In this position, fiddling with the 
‘Man’ knob won’t do anything – the valve is now being adjusted by the controller. Instead, 
it’s possible to adjust the controller setpoint by turning the knob marked ‘SET’ which is 
halfway up the faceplate on the right. There are other adjustments available – the direction 
of control action and controller algorithm adjustments, but these are hidden away either at 
the back of the controller or inside the case. These are regarded as ‘engineering’ parameters 
and should not be altered by the process operators. When the controller is installed in 
the control room, these engineering adjustments will be completely inaccessible unless the 
controller is physically removed from the control panel.

Introduction to feedback control
Figure 32 – an electronic controller with traditional faceplate
Some modern, electronic, PID controllers use a similar faceplate design as the old pneumatic 
controllers (figure 32). It gives a clear indication of measured value and setpoint, especially 
if you are used to looking at displays of this type. The modern controllers, however, are 
considerably more sophisticated and will include many additional features such as alarms, 
self-tuning, a choice of control algorithms, etc. Most controllers of this type are no longer 
single loop – they are actually multiple controllers in the same box and the display can be 
switched between each controller.
As engineers and operators who were used to the old ‘faceplate’ style of controllers 
become fewer, new controller designs based on LED displays are becoming much more 
common (figure 33). These controllers only really differ in HMI – they still have multiple 
extra functions and often contain multiple ‘loops’ – they can be used to control several 
variables simultaneously.

The trend in most process plants is to move away from discrete loop controllers and instead 
incorporate control loops into a computer based control scheme. For small installations, 
these loops might be incorporated in a device called a Programmable Logic Controller 
(PLC). Larger installations (anything bigger than a dozen loops) will usually have a Scanning 
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) computer based system that will contain feedback 
controllers, but will also present the operators with a set of nice mimic displays too. These 
systems are discussed in more detail later.

INTRODUCTION TO STEADY-
STATE AND DYNAMIC RESPONSE
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Steady-state gain
•	 Introduction to non-linearity
•	 Basic types of dynamic response: time delay; integrators; self-regulators; instability
•	 First- and second-order response
•	 Measures used to describe controlled responses
•	 How to fit first-order plus dead-time (FOPDT) models to high-order step responses.
As chemical engineers we are used to thinking about most processes in terms of their steady-
state behaviour – when forming mass and energy balances the first thing that is usually 
done is that the accumulation term (the d/dt) is set to zero. In the past most chemical 
engineers were destined for large continuous plant, where steady-state analysis was reasonably 
appropriate for most purposes. Steady-state analysis, however, is never appropriate for 
control – we are very concerned with how things change dynamically. Nowadays, even for 
general chemical engineers, the increasing importance of batch production of high value 
speciality chemicals to the chemical industry means that an understanding of dynamic 
behaviour is vitally important.
8.1	
STEADY-STATE GAIN
It might seem odd to start a section on dynamics with a description of a steady-state 
phenomenon. However, the steady state gain is an important factor in the dynamic response 
of the system – it shows where the system will end up if the response is allowed to complete.
The steady-state gain of a component, or system (a group of components), is defined as 
the steady-state change in the output signal divided by the steady-state change in the input 
signal, it can also be expressed as:

Introduction to steady-state and dynamic response
Figure 34 – gain in a non-linear system
In a linear system, the steady-state gain is constant throughout the systems range, but 
non-linear systems (i.e. all chemical processes) have gains that vary with the point they 
are measured (figure 34). For these systems it is important to state where a gain has been 
obtained – for most process gains, this will be at the nominal operating point of the process.
All the components in a control system will have a steady-state gain. It is possible to calculate 
the overall gain of a group of blocks directly from a block diagram (figure 35), e.g.

Steady-state gains can be obtained from experiments on plant or simulations (by making a 
small change in the input and wait until the output settles) but they’d be more commonly 
obtained by more sophisticated system identification methods that allow model information to 
be obtained from suitably stimulated process input-output data. Gains can also be obtained 
from process models: consider this model for an isothermal CSTR, with a second-order 
rate expression.

Introduction to steady-state and dynamic response
8.2	
DYNAMIC RESPONSE
Dynamic response is the time varying or transient behaviour of a system immediately and 
soon after it is subjected to a change in input. The dynamic response of a system is affected 
by the size and number of capacities that are present. These capacities are places where 
conserved quantities (i.e. total mass/moles, component mass/moles, and energy) are held up 
within the system. For total mass, capacities are as simple as the volume of vessels, reactors, 
etc. – the larger the capacity, the slower the dynamic response is likely to be.
The order of a dynamic response is directly related to the number of capacities (holdups) in 
a particular system between the input and output. Each of these capacities will need a first-
order differential equation (a mass, component or energy balance – mechanical systems will 
include momentum balances too, which are fundamentally second-order, but most process 
industry problems don’t require these) to describe its behaviour. A third-order process will 
contain three capacities, and will be described mathematically by three inter-related first-
order differential equations leading to the overall dynamic response being defined by a 
third-order differential equation.
The systems we deal with in the chemical industry tend to be very high-order – the simplest 
system that can be imagined is a tank, a level measuring instrument and a valve – all of 
these will have, at least, first-order dynamics, leading to a minimum of a third-order process. 
Something like a distillation column can easily have dynamics of the order of a hundred 
or more. High order dynamics can introduce very interesting dynamic behaviour, but a lot 
can be understood by looking at the behaviour of lower order systems (which make up the 
components of the high-order response).
8.2.1	 DYNAMIC RESPONSE – DEAD TIME
Process

Figure 36 – a dead-time process
Dead time (sometimes called distance-velocity lag) is, in some ways, the simplest sort of 
dynamic response that can be observed. If dead-time is present in a system the output will 
not change (it will be dead) for a period of time after the input has changed (see figure 36).

Introduction to steady-state and dynamic response
 Figure 37 – distance-velocity lag
Dead-time is fairly common in process industry systems and can be caused by a number 
of factors. Probably the easiest to understand (although the least likely in practice) is the 
scenario that gives dead-time its alternative name – distance velocity lag (figure 37). In this 
situation, it is assumed that the ‘process’ is a long pipe, of length ‘d’, with a measurement 
device at the exit. Fluid is flowing through the pipe in a pure plug flow manner at velocity 
‘v’. If a change (e.g. temperature or concentration) is injected into the fluid at time t=0, 
no change will be registered at the measuring instrument until the element of fluid has 
had time to move down the length of the pipe. This will take a time equal to the distance 
(length of the pipe) divided by the velocity. Putting instruments at the end of long pipes is 
not really good practice, and so pure distance-velocity lag isn’t common in real situations.
In real processes, dead-time is typically associated with the movement of materials in large 
vessels. We are used to assuming that vessels are perfectly mixed, but this is rarely the case. 
In an imperfectly mixed vessel, if there is a change in one of the inlet streams that change 
will not immediately be seen in all parts of the vessel instantly. Instead there will be a delay 
(dead-time) before anything at all will be seen at a particular point. An instrument inserted 
into the vessel will not immediately detect changes in the vessel contents caused by changes 
in an input stream. This dead-time will be variable and dependent on the size of the vessel, 
agitation conditions, and the flowrates through the vessel.
Another potential source of dead-time in the process industries are chemical analysers. Some 
of these analysers take a sample from the process and then take time to develop an output.
When the dead-time becomes large compared to the other dynamics present in a process, 
it can cause real problems to feedback control systems. These controllers rely on being able 
to immediately see the effect their manipulations are having on the controlled variable. 
If significant dead-time is present, then the feedback controller is seeing the output of 
the process as it responds to an input made a dead-time ago in the past. This temporal 
decoupling of the input and output can cause issues with stability and special techniques 
may have to be used to control such systems.

8.2.2	 DYNAMIC RESPONSE – INTEGRATORS
Figure 38 – an integrating process
An integrator is a process element that simply integrates input changes over time. The easiest 
process related example is the level in a tank with a pumped discharge. The pump prevents 
the outlet flow being significantly affected by the level in the tank. In this example, if the 
inlet flowrate changes by a step, then the level in the tank will increase in a ramp (since 
no extra flow will be leaving the tank). The tank is integrating the change in the inlet flow 
over time.

8.2.3	 DYNAMIC RESPONSE – SELF-REGULATING SYSTEMS
Figure 39 – a self-regulating process
The outputs of most of the processes encountered in the process industries will not continue 
to grow indefinitely after an input change (i.e. they are not integrators). Instead they will 
tend to approach a final value asymptotically over time. An example of a self-regulating 
process is the level in the tank that was used in the integrator example, but with the pump 
replaced with a flow restriction. The flow out of the tank is now a function of the pressure 
drop over the restriction, and hence the level in the tank. Now when the flowrate into the 
tank changes by a step, the level will again start to rise but as it does so it will increase the 
pressure drop over the restriction and hence the discharge flowrate. Eventually, the level 
will rise far enough that flowrate out of the tank matches the flowrate in, and the level will 
stop rising (mathematically this will take an infinite time, but for practical purposes the 
time required can be assumed to be limited).
8.2.4	 DYNAMIC RESPONSE – UNSTABLE SYSTEMS
Some systems are dynamically unstable – when an input changes, the output will grow 
without bound (in theory to infinity, but in practice until something hits a limit or breaks). 
This growth can either be linear (in the case of integrators), exponential, or oscillatory.

Introduction to steady-state and dynamic response
Some processes are fundamentally open-loop unstable – to see an example of one, try 
balancing a pencil on the end of your finger. An example from the chemical industries is 
an exothermic CSTR, operated at its unstable temperature point. For these processes to 
operate, active control is required to stabilise the system around the desired conditions.
Instability can also arise as a result of control action. Using the wrong direction of control 
action can produce unstable controlled responses, and should always be avoided. Even if 
the correct direction of control action is selected it is still possible to destabilise all practical 
processes by making the controller too aggressive in its control action. Excessive control 
action is the usual cause of oscillatory instability.
8.2.5	 DYNAMIC RESPONSE – FIRST-ORDER SYSTEMS
First-order systems are described by first-order differential equations and always are formed 
by taking balances (mass, component or energy) around a single capacity. The standard 
equation for a first-order system is:
u
d
τ dt
dy* + y* = Km * + Kd
*  
where	 	
P =  the time constant – a factor that determines the speed of response and 
is dependent on the size of the capacity involved
	
	
K  = the output of the process (the asterisk has a special meaning that is 
dealt with later)
	
	
&|  = the steady-state gain associated with the manipulated input
	
	
G =  the manipulated input
	
	
&v =  the disturbance steady-state gain – the steady-state gain associated with 
the disturbance input
	
	
7 =  the disturbance input
First order processes are the fundamental building block of all chemical process responses. 
Some examples of systems that will be governed by first-order dynamics are: the temperature 
of a thermometer bulb; the level of a tank; the reactant concentration in a reactor; the mole 
fraction on a plate in a distillation column.

Figure 41 – a first-order step response
First-order systems can be self-limiting or unstable (unstable first-order systems will have a 
negative sign in front of the K  term. The response of a stable first-order system to a step 
input always looks like figure 41.
Stable first-order systems always move at their fastest rate the instant the step is applied, 
and then get slower as time moves on.

Introduction to steady-state and dynamic response
The final change in the output is equal to the steady-state gain times the change in the 
input. First-order responses will be approximately 95% complete after three time constants 
and 99% complete after five time constants (the equations will be obtained later).
8.2.6	 DYNAMIC RESPONSE – SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS
In process industry situations, second-order systems are normally formed as a result of two 
first-order systems acting together. Momentum balances will produce equations which are 
fundamentally second-order (they model position, velocity and acceleration – velocity is 
the first-derivative and acceleration the second-derivative of position) but these are rarely 
required when considering process engineering systems.
The standard form of a stable second-order differential equation is:
P[ 7[K
7F[  MP 7K
7F  K  &|G  &v7 
where	 	
P = natural period of oscillation (not to be confused with the time constant 
of a first-order equation
	
	
M = damping factor
A second-order system’s response to step-changes has richer behaviour than first-order systems, 
and the form of the response is dependent on the damping factor.

Introduction to steady-state and dynamic response
Figure 42 shows the situation when the damping factor has values greater than one. This 
type of response is known as an overdamped response. The final value is still dependent on 
the steady-state gain (since steady-state isn’t a dynamic phenomenon, it is independent of 
the order of the dynamics in the system). Note that second-order (and higher-order) systems 
don’t start moving at their maximum speed until after a lag period – the system has built 
in ‘momentum’ and needs to accelerate.
When the damping factor becomes equal to one, the system is said to be critically damped. 
The response looks very like an overdamped response, but represents a limiting case. As 
the damping factor drops below one, the response becomes underdamped, and produces the 
oscillatory behaviour shown in the figure 43.

Introduction to steady-state and dynamic response
Decay ratio	 	
The ratio of the heights of the first and second peaks of a response 
after a setpoint change (the ratio should also be fairly consistent on 
the following peaks too. Decay ratio may also be used to describe 
response on disturbance changes.
Settling time		
The settling time is the time required for a response to settle within 
a given band (often 5%) of the setpoint after a change. Settling time 
tends to increase as the aggressiveness of control increases, and so there 
is a direct conflict between minimising settling time and rise time.
8.2.8	 FITTING A SIMPLE FIRST-ORDER MODEL TO HIGHER ORDER RESPONSES
There is often a need in dealing with control problems to obtain some sort of model of a 
particular process (remember that in control engineering a ‘process’ is simply something that 
converts input information to output information, and could be part of a unit operation, 
a measurement instrument, etc.). It usually isn’t practical, or even desirable, to obtain the 
full first-principles (based on fundamental balances) models and some sort of approximate 
model that captures the main features of a response is better.
The most common type of approximate model used for this purpose is a first-order plus 
dead-time model (FOPDT). This can be represented by the differential equation:
P 7K
7F  K  &G F  Fv

Introduction to steady-state and dynamic response
The model has three parameters that need to be ‘fitted’ to make the model resemble the target 
system. These are: the time constant (τ ); the steady-state gain (K); and the dead-time (Fv).
One way of fitting this sort of model is to perform a step-test on the system to be modelled. 
This involves putting in a step into the process and recording the response. This will only 
work on over-damped higher order responses: the FOPDT model cannot represent overshoot 
or oscillation. A typical response that might be obtained from a high-order system is shown 
in figure 45.
As the order of the response increases, the length of the acceleration lag time also increases, 
producing an effect that looks very much like dead-time (although the output is changing 
from time zero, the changes are very small).
To fit a FOPDT model we can use the solution of the model’s response to a step change, 
and this is:
K F  &   8a a
 G 
where is the size of the input step.
Steady-state gain can be determined by dividing the final steady-state change in output by 
the steady-state change in input. In the example in figure 45 a step of 1 unit was used, 
leading to a change of 1 in the output, and so the steady-state gain is 1/1 = 1.
This leaves two parameters to fix: the time constant and the dead-time. These can be 
estimated by taking any two points on the curve. Any points can be used, but it makes 
sense to choose points which are reasonably far apart and in regions of the curve where 
the time and change are easy to measure. I suggest the points where the response is 30% 
and 90% complete. The times at these points are read off from the response that’s being 
modelled (see figure 46).

DYNAMIC MODELLING
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Laplace transform solution of simple linear ODEs
•	 Transfer functions and block diagrams
•	 How to recognise response components (i.e. steady-state gain, order, poles, zeroes 
and time delays) in transfer functions and explain the contribution they may make 
to the final response
•	 Forming simple dynamic models from continuity equations (mass, component mass 
and energy balances)
Dynamic modelling is the modelling of process dynamics. It involves forming the differential 
equations, in most cases simplifying them if analytical (mathematical) solution is required, 
and then actually solving them (either analytically or numerically). The most common 
technique used for analytical solution in control is Laplace transform analysis.

LAPLACE TRANSFORMS
When a differential equation (in the ‘t’ or time-domain) is mathematically transformed 
through the use of Laplace transforms it becomes an algebraic equation (in the ‘s’ or Laplace 
domain). This algebraic equation can be manipulated and solved using the normal rules of 
linear algebra to produce an ‘s-domain’ solution. This solution is then inverted back into 
the ‘t-domain’ using tables of inverse transforms.
9.1.1	 DEFINITION
If f(t) is a function in time, then its Laplace transform is defined as:
W 9 F
 9 E 
9 F 8a7F
c
Y
 
Some important properties of Laplace transforms (from Marlin 1995):
1)	A Laplace transform does not exist for all functions. Sufficient conditions for its 
existence are:
a)	f(t) is piecewise continuous.
b)	The integral has a finite value (i.e. f(t) does not increase faster than e-st decreases. 
(Don’t worry about what ‘s’ actually is – it’s only a mathematical symbol and 
has no physical meaning at all. If you think too much about it you’ll end up 
joining the long list of mathematicians who’ve gone insane!)
2)	Laplace transformation converts a function from the ‘t-domain’ into one in the 
‘s-domain’, and the s domain function can have a complex (i.e. real and imaginary) 
representation.
3)	Laplace transformation is a linear operation.
i.e. W 49 F  5: F
 4W 9 F
 5W : F
 
4)	Tables of Laplace transformations are commonly used to convert equations (they are 
available in text books). These tables are also used to provide inverse transformations.

For this example I shall use the differential equation:
 7K
7F  K  G¡F¢ 
where G¡F¢  is subjected to a step of 5 units (i.e. its value jumps from 0 to 5) at time t=0.
9.3.1	 STAGE 1 – CONVERT THE ENTIRE EQUATION INTO THE S-DOMAIN
Since we are using deviation variables (see later for a definition of these), the initial values 
will all be zero (this is another very good reason for using deviation variables to solve 
control problems).

of the whole process.

NB: the second form of y*/u* with a single ‘s’ is simply a shorthand way of writing the ratio.
The transfer function contains all the information about how the process it describes will 
behave in response to any input. The transfer function is a very powerful tool for handling 
linear process dynamics.
9.5	
BLOCK DIAGRAMS
Block diagrams are a very useful way of graphically representing and, through the use of 
block diagram algebra, solving linear process control problems. Block diagrams are based 
around s-domain representations of the various system elements.
Block diagrams are constructed from two types of blocks:
9.5.1	 ADDITION/ SUBTRACTION BLOCK
This block adds (figure 48), or subtracts (figure 49), the signals supplied to it as inputs.
o(s) = i1(s) + i2(s)

BLOCK DIAGRAM ALGEBRA
As well as representing dynamic and control systems graphically, block diagrams can be 
used to combine the individual transfer functions to obtain the overall dynamic response. 
The only rule of block diagram algebra is concerned with blocks in series. Consider the 
system in figure 51.

Because AZ  is the same as <[. 
RULE:	
for blocks in series, the overall transfer function is simply the product of the 
individual transfer functions.

SOLUTIONS OF RESPONSES FOR HIGH-ORDER SYSTEMS
Although Laplace transforms can be inverted for high order systems, the algebra involved 
in factorising the s-domain solutions into forms available in tables of inverse transforms 
can be very compicated.

However, a great deal can be said about the form of the response of a high-order system

For stable systems subjected to a finite input change it’s possible to use a variant of this 
theorem to get the steady-state gain – just set ‘s’ to zero in all the terms of the transfer 
function. This works even with very complicated TF’s!

Dynamic modelling
9.7.2	 GENERALISED DYNAMIC RESPONSE
This section is concerned with the information on the dynamic characteristics of the response 
that can be obtained from the transfer function. This information comes from the roots of 
the denominator (poles) and the numerator (zeroes).
9.7.2.1  Poles
The denominator of a transfer function, also known as the characteristic equation, determines 
the overall form of the response of the process represented. The order of this equation 
determines the order of the system response (i.e. if the highest power in ‘s’ is 4, then 
the transfer function represents a fourth-order system, and the corresponding t-domain 
differential equation would be fourth-order). The roots of the characteristic equation are 
called the poles of the system and each root contributes something to the overall response 
(think of what you would do if you were trying to invert an s-domain solution – the first 
thing required is for the denominator to be factorised into bits that can be looked up in a 
table of inverse transforms). Obviously, the number of poles for a transfer function is the 
same as the order of the transfer function.
Poles that have real values always lead to pure exponential terms appearing in the t-domain 
solution. If a pole has a negative real value (e.g. a factor like (s+1) – ‘s’ has a value of -1), 
then it will give rise to a term of the form 
t
e α
−  in the t-domain solution, i.e. a term that 
will decay exponentially as time increases. If, on the other hand, the pole has a positive 
real value (factors like (s-1)), then it will give rise to a term of the form 
t
eα ,  i.e. one which 
increases exponentially with time. Terms of this type cause the system to be exponentially 
unstable – no matter what the other terms are, a single unstable pole will make the whole 
response unstable.
In process engineering problems, complex poles always appear in conjugate pairs (i.e. a + 
ib and a – ib). Complex poles give rise to sinusoidal terms in the t-domain response. If the 
real part of the pole (the ‘a’ bit) is negative then the sinusoid will decay away exponentially 
with time (whether the oscillation is apparent in the t-domain response depends on the 
relative values of all the poles of the transfer function). If the real part of the pole is positive, 
however, then the t-domain term will be a sinusoidal oscillation that grows exponentially in 
amplitude with time (oscillatory unstable). A single pair of such complex poles will cause 
the whole system to be unstable, regardless of what the other poles are.

Dynamic modelling
9.7.2.2  Zeroes
The roots of the numerator of a transfer function (if any) are called the zeroes of the process. 
Zeroes modify the behaviour, but don’t change the overall order of a system’s dynamic 
response (unless they exactly equal a system pole and cause pole-zero cancellation – in this 
case the order of the response will be reduced by one for every cancellation).
Zeroes with negative values will accelerate the initial response, and can cause overshoot even 
in processes with no complex poles.
Systems with positive zeroes are more difficult from a control point of view since they exhibit 
what is known as inverse response. A system with inverse response initially responds in the 
opposite direction that its steady-state gain would indicate. This causes obvious problems 
with feedback control were the direction of control action is chosen on the basis of the 
sign of the steady-state gain on the manipulation term.
Systems with positive zeroes always occur because there are two, or more, routes whereby 
an input can affect the output, but with opposite gains, for example for the system shown 
in figure 52.

Dynamic modelling

FORMING DYNAMIC MODELS
For many control purposes, when dynamic models are required they are produced by fitting 
simplified models to process data (e.g. the FOPDT model fit that was described earlier). 
Producing a dynamic model from first principles is a major undertaking, not just because 
of the number of equations involved but also because of the need to obtain good estimates 
for all of the many parameters in the equations (e.g. heat and mass transfer coefficients).
However, for some purposes, it is necessary to produce models that closely resemble the 
real process. For standard processes, this can often be done by using the ‘stock’ models that 
are available in the dynamic parts of process simulation packages (e.g. Aspen Dynamic). In 
theory, these models can be produced as a follow on from steady-state flowsheet modelling, 
by simply adding the various capacity parameters necessary for dynamic modelling (remember 
that capacities are what make processes dynamic). In reality, the modelling process is a lot 
more complex, and often special models need to be written to deal with non-standard bits 
of equipment.
Although real dynamic modelling can be difficult and complex, the ideas behind it are 
relatively simple and involve only one equation – the continuity equation. As chemical 
engineers you’ll be very familiar with this equation already, although you’ve probably been 
calling it a mass balance or an energy balance or a component balance. The full equation 
is always done over a capacity (something that has the capability of holding some of the 
quantity being balanced) and has the form:
-4F8A9466G?G>4F<A@  -4F8%@  -4F8*GF  -4F8A9#8@8D4F<A@ 
The continuity equation needs to be applied to a conserved quantity: total mass (or moles); 
component mass (or moles); energy; momentum. Momentum balances are unusual in 
process engineering, and so we are normally concerned with just three quantities (total 
mass, component mass and energy).
Forming the accumulation term is easiest if the following approach is taken:
-4F8A9466G?G>4F<A@

Remember that continuity balances are always made over a capacity.

Dynamic modelling
When you form continuity balances you should always get in the habit of checking the 
units of each term – this will check dimensional consistency, but will also highlight mistakes 
that may have been made in forming the equations. Terms in a mass, or component mass, 
balances always have units of mass/time. Energy balance terms always have units of energy/
time. Remember to check the consistency of both the mass or energy units AND the time 
units used in the equation (i.e. don’t mix hours and minutes).

This can be a little more complicated if we assume that the total mass balance is not constant, 
and a good bit more complicated if constant temperature is not assumed (i.e. if we need a 
dynamic energy balance). Let’s look at the simplest case first.
Assume constant and equal densities in all streams; perfect level control (with the previous 
assumption this gives a constant mass balance and Fin=Fout); perfect mixing; perfect 
temperature control (i.e. constant temperature – no need to consider the effect of temperature 
on reaction rate).

Relaxing the level control assumption hasn’t changed the order of the response for the 
reactor concentration to changes in inlet flow or concentration.
If we go a step further and relax the perfect temperature control assumption, we need to

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

•	 Step-response solution for a simple, but realistic, process
Laplace transforms are a very powerful method of solving differential equations, but they 
are limited to linear differential equations. There is, in fact, no general solution method for 
non-linear differential equations. Unfortunately, almost without exception, the models that 
are produced for process engineering problems will involve non-linear equations.
These non-linear models can be solved using numerical (dynamic simulation) techniques, 
but analytical (mathematical) solutions have advantages. It’s much easier to understand 
the overall behaviour, and sensitivity, of a solution by looking at an equation than it is 
by looking at the results of multiple simulation studies. Linear solutions also allow more 
advanced analytical techniques to be used for controller design.
10.1	 TYPES OF NON-LINEARITY
Before considering how we can deal with non-linearity it is worthwhile looking at the 
sorts of non-linearity that can arise in process industry models. A differential equation is 
non-linear if a non-linear function, or multiplicative combination, is applied to any of the 
time-varying (inputs or outputs) terms. 
10.1.1	FUNCTIONAL NON-LINEARITIES
Functional non-linearities are the easiest to spot – a non-linear function is applied to 
input or output terms. The following are examples of process engineering equations with 
functional non-linearities:

It is possible to subject linear differential equations to non-linear inputs and have something 
that is perfectly solvable (since the differential equation itself is linear):
P 7K
7F  K  &G I;8D8G  9¡F¢ 
if G  ¡QF¢,  then this can be inserted into the equation:
P 7K
7F  K  &E<@¡QF¢ 
This equation can be solved.
10.1.2	COMBINATIONAL NON-LINEARITIES
Combinational non-linearities occur when two, or more, time varying terms are multiplied, 
or divided, together. They can be awkward as an equation can change from being linear to 
non-linear depending on the assumptions that are made as to what terms are time varying. 
For example, consider the reactant balance in a simple CSTR:
1 7
7F  "y}  "  =1 
If we assume that only the inlet concentration (y}¢  (and also, since it’s the equation output, 
the outlet concentration) is variable, then the equation is linear. However, if we also allow 
the flowrate through the reactor (")  to vary as well, then we end up with two combinational 
non-linearities ("y} and ") 
10.2	 LINEARISATION OF NON-LINEAR EQUATIONS
One way of dealing with non-linear equations is to approximate (linearise) them with linear 
equations. This only works if the amount of variation is limited to a small region around 
the point where the equation is approximated (the point of linearisation). In most control 
problems in the process industries we are concerned with disturbance rejection around the 
nominal flowsheet conditions and linearised equations can give reasonable approximations.
The process of linearising an equation involves identifying all the non-linear parts of the 
equation and then replacing them with a linear approximation. This can be understood 
either graphically or with reference to Taylor series approximation.

In figure 57, ‘X’ is the time varying quantity (input or output) that is subjected to some 
non-linear function, producing the relationship shown in the blue line on the graph. If 
we want to approximate this function with a straight line, we first need to pick where we 
want to form the approximation – the linear approximation we get will vary radically with 
the point of linearisation that is chosen. In this case we’ve chosen to linearise around the 
nominal steady-state (which is what’s usually chosen for control). To approximate the non-
linear function at this point, we draw a straight line through the point of linearisation with 
a slope which is tangent to the curve at that point. The equation of this straight line will 
now give use the linear approximation to the function, i.e.

can be used to approximate any function to any desired degree of accuracy. For linearisation, 
we can’t use any terms after the first order terms – if we do we’ll end up with non-linearities 
(e.g. 3[)  in our ‘simplified’ expression. If we omit all terms which are second-order and 
higher then we get:

There are advantages in thinking about linearisation in terms of the Taylor series. The 
first is that it allows us to gauge how accurate our approximation will be. For Taylor 
series approximation, the error is of the same order as the first-term that is omitted. For 
linearisation this is:
7["
73[
r
3  3nn
[ 
So, the linearisation accuracy is dependent on the second-derivative of the non-linear 
function, and on the square of the distance from the point of linearisation. The second 
derivative can be thought of as a measure of the non-linearity of the function at a particular 
point – high values of second-derivative means that the slope of the function is changing 
rapidly, i.e. it is highly non-linear.
The second advantage of the Taylor series interpretation is that it can be easily extended to 
multi-variable (combinational) non-linearities, e.g.

10.3	 SIMPLIFYING EXPRESSIONS THROUGH DEVIATION VARIABLES
In control problems we are usually interested in how things change around a particular 
operating point – usually the nominal steady-state. Leaving steady-state information in our 
equations can make things really messy. This mess comes from two sources: linearisation, 
and initial values in Laplace transforms of derivatives.
Linearisation always produces a whole bunch of steady-state terms that need to be included

All this steady-state information makes the equations messy and difficult to handle and 
contributes absoultely nothing. The steady-state information will be the same at the end of 
the solution as it was at the beginning.
Deviation variables are a mathematical trick that get rid of the steady-state components of a 
solution and make equations much easier to handle. The definition of a deviation variable is:
K  K  Knn 
The value of the deviation variable (marked with an asterisk) is equal to the full-value variable 
(which changes with time) minus the steady-state value of the variable (that is fixed).
It’s possible to convert an equation to deviation variable form by inspection, although care 
needs to be taken to take the deviation of complete non-linear terms (rather than the non-
linear function of the deviation), e.g.

10.4	 PROCEDURE FOR SIMPLIFYING AND SOLVING A 
NON-LINEAR MODEL
The following is the best procedure to be followed when analytically solving non-linear 
equations:
1.	Identify non-linear terms and draw a bracket around them
2.	Take the deviation of all the time-varying terms – remember to take care with 
non-linearities.
3.	Linearise the non-linear parts of the expression
4.	Solve the model using Laplace transforms
5.	If required, add back the steady-state components.

The reactor operates at constant density and has perfect level and temperature control (the 
total mass and energy balances are steady-state). The nominal operating conditions for the 
reactor are shown in table 9.

Develop a dynamic model of the reactor around its nominal operating conditions and show 
how it responds to a) a step change in the flowrate from 1 to 1.1m3.hr-1; b) a step change 
in inlet concentration from 50 to 55 kg.m-3.
The first thing to do is to form the continuity equations necessary for modelling the reactor. 
We’re told that we have a constant total mass balance and a constant energy balance (and 
reactor temperature), so the only equation we need to form is the component mass balance 
for the reactor:

 -4F8<@  -4F8AGF  -4F8A978EFDG6F<A@ 
It’s always worthwhile, at least initially, to write down the equation in words first. Now 
let’s add the maths:
7
7F 1  "y}  "  =1[ 
or
1 7
7F  "y}  "  =1[ 
since the liquid volume is constant.
Check the units of each term – the flow rate x concentration terms are kg/hr, as is the 
reaction rate. The term inside the bracket on the accumulation is kg, and a d/dt derivative 
is being applied to it, which converts it to kg/time unit. Since the RHS of the equation is 
using hours as the time unit, this is the unit that the derivative will be expressed in too. 
The units in the equation are fine.

The next stage is to identify non-linearities. We know that the C2 term will be a functional 
non-linearity, since C is the output of the equation and so is time varying. There are two 
other possible ("y} and ")  combinational non-linearities in the equation, if F is allowed 
to vary. We know that we’ll have to vary F to get the answer to part (a), so it makes sense 
to include it as a potentially time varying term. In control problems the more variables that 
are allowed to change with time, the more complicated the solution and so it’s important 
to only allow things to vary if you have to.
At this point we’ve identified the time varying quantities; all the other terms in the equation 
will be constants (at least from the point of view of this problem). It’s worthwhile getting 
the values of these constants in now:

We can see a lot about the sort of response we can expect just by looking at the equation. 
The equation is first-order and is stable, so we know the shape of the response to a step 
change in input. The time constant of the response is 3×10-3 hrs, or 10.8 seconds – after 
a step, we can expect the response to be 63% complete after 10.8sec (one time constant), 
95% complete after 32.4sec (3 time constants) and 99% complete after 54 seconds(5 time 
constants). The steady-state gain on flowrate changes is 0.04995 – if we change the flowrate 
by 0.1 m3.hr-1, we can expect the final outlet concentration (steady-state) to change by 
0.004995 kg.m-3. The gain on the inlet concentration is 10-3 – a change of 5 kg.m-3 in the 
inlet concentration should produce a final outlet concentration change of 5×10-3 kg.m-3.

MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 On-off control and deadbands
•	 The components of a PID algorithm and how they contribute to the overall 
controlled system behaviour
•	 The effect of controller gain, reset time and derivative time constant on a controlled 
system’s response
•	 Some of the different forms of the PID algorithm
I’ve already discussed the basic idea of feedback control, where the controller takes a fed-
back measurement of the controlled output, compares it with a setpoint, and then computes 
a manipulation value that will bring the two closer together. We haven’t so far considered 
the algorithms that can carry out this computation, but we’ll do so in this section.

PID Controller algorithm
11.1	 REALLY SIMPLE FEEDBACK CONTROLLER – ON-OFF 
Figure 58 – pure on-off control
The simplest type of feedback controller is one that implements an on-off control algorithm. 
In this algorithm, the controller output has only two states: fully on; or fully off. Let’s say 
the process to be controlled has a negative overall gain (i.e. a fully on controller action will 
produce a negative change in controlled variable output). In this case, if the measurement 
rises above the setpoint the controller will open its output fully and so drive the controlled 
variable back down. The controller will hold its output on until the controlled variable 
crosses the setpoint and becomes less. At this point, the controller output will switch to 
fully off, to raise the output once more towards the setpoint. This behaviour will repeat at 
a frequency which is dependent on the dynamics in the system, producing a fast oscillation 
like that shown in the figure 58.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL

119
PID Controller algorithm
The high frequency oscillation of pure on-off control holds the controlled output close to 
the setpoint at all times (provided the control effort is sufficient) but is often not acceptable 
due to the wear it causes to the final control element which must switch between fully on 
and fully off at a high frequency. In situations where this is likely to be a problem (i.e. 
almost always) on-off control may be implemented with a deadband around the setpoint. 
The deadband, which is often made adjustable, is a region around the setpoint where the 
controller takes no action at all. If a deadband was added to the controller in the example 
above, then the controller would not change state the first time until the controlled variable 
moved past the upper edge of the deadband. This would cause the controlled variable to 
start to move down, back towards the setpoint and cross back into the deadband region. The 
controller takes no action and the controlled variable moves further down, and eventually 
crosses the setpoint. The controller still takes no action, until the controlled variable crosses 
the lower edge of the deadband. At this point, the controller switches the output to fully 
off and the controlled variable begins to rise again. This behaviour continues for as long 
as the controller is switched on, causing a lower frequency oscillation which is dependent 
on the dynamics of the system and on the width of the deadband – larger deadbands will 
cause lower frequency oscillations. The behaviour of an on-off controller with dead-band 
is illustrated in figure 59.
Deadbands are sometimes used with more sophisticated controllers too as they prevent 
the controller taking action when the controlled variable is oscillating around the setpoint 
value due to noise.
On-off control is common in domestic applications – most central heating systems operate 
using this type of control. However, the continuously oscillating nature of the response is 
not desirable in process engineering applications, where there are usually several hundred 
individual controllers involved.
11.2	 PROPORTIONAL-INTEGRAL-DERIVATIVE (PID) CONTROL
The Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller is almost universally used in feedback control 
applications in the process industries. Even when more sophisticated controller techniques, 
such as predictive control, are used they often cascade down onto lower level PID controllers 
that actually make the changes to the process.

The PID algorithm was first developed by an engineer who was designing an automatic 
steering system for ships in the US Navy. He observed that the human helmsman, who was 
given a bearing to steer by the captain, adjusted the position of the ships wheel according 
to three factors: how far the current bearing was from the desired bearing (a big difference 
would result in a big change in wheel position – the action is proportional ); how long the 
bearing had been different from the desired bearing (if a difference was persisting, then the 
helmsman would turn the wheel further – effectively integrating the error); how quickly the 
actual bearing was changing (if the actual bearing was changing very quickly towards the 
desired bearing, then the helmsman would see that the time based derivative was too high 
and move the wheel back a bit).
The earliest PID controllers implemented these human generated control rules by mechanical 
means, with bellows, nozzles, flappers and compressed air. Soon, however, there was a need 
for analysis and the PID algorithm was expressed mathematically. There are many different 
forms of the PID algorithm, but the one we’ll mainly be using in this course is what is 
known as the classical form:

The PID controller can be used in a variety of different ways, and the individual parts 
(proportional, integral and derivative) can be switched off to make the algorithm suit different 
applications. The most common way PID controllers are used in the process industry is 
as a PI controller (with the derivative switched off), P controllers (integral and derivative 
switched off) are sometimes used for level control, full PID control is used on fairly slow 
non-noisy systems. The other possible control modes (I,ID,PD) are very rarely (never?) 
used in the process industries and derivative-only control is never used, as it wouldn’t work!
It is useful to consider each of the three control modes individually, however.

This is a PID controller with the integral and derivative actions turned off (by setting the 
respective time constants to infinity and zero). The algorithm is now:

Proportional action provides the fastest response of the three terms when an error enters 
the system. It generates a change in the controller output instantaneously, and the size of 
the change is proportional to the size of the error.

Figure 60 – a P-controlled level
When used on its own, as a P controller, proportional action does have limitations. Consider 
the system shown in figure 60. When the system is at its nominal steady-state (steady-state 
at flowsheet conditions) the error in the controller will be zero (the level will be at the 
setpoint) and the manipulated exit valve will be held open, by the bias term, far enough 
to make sure that the exit flowrate matches the inlet flowrate. If a disturbance now enters 
the process that causes the inlet flowrate to rise, the level in the tank will start to increase. 
The controller will detect this increase, and will start to open the valve. If the gain is very 
large it will open the exit valve a long way, to bring the level back towards the setpoint 
very quickly. However eventually, provided the system is stable, the controller will reach 
a steady-state where the outlet flowrate matches the inlet flowrate, and the level will stop 
changing. However this steady-state will only occur if there is a non-zero residual steady-
state error called the steady-state offset. If the offset isn’t present (i.e. the error is zero) the 
output of the controller will be equal to the bias and the flow out will be equal to the 
original flow. The only way the system can come to steady-state under proportional-only 
control is to have a steady-state offset. This is a ‘feature’ of proportional-only control and 
occurs on all disturbance changes, and on almost all setpoint changes (the one exception 
is when controlling a system with an integrator, such as the system in figure 60) where 
setpoint changes will be tracked without offset.
The amount of offset can be reduced by increasing the gain (as the gain tends to infinity, 
the offset tends to zero), but in practical systems stability considerations limit the maximum 
value of gain that can be used.

The most common use of pure proportional control is in level control, where exact control 
of the level isn’t usually required – all that is important is that the level is kept between 
certain limits(although in practical situations a little integral is still added to ‘centre’ the 
response). In these situations, allowing the level to vary can be a positive advantage, as 
the capacity can smooth out variations in the input signal. Figure 61 shows the level in a 
system like that in figure 60 with a very high gain proportional controller, with the input 
flow being subjected to a sinusoidal variation.

PID Controller algorithm
The setpoint of the controller is set at 1, and you can see that the high gain of the controller 
is very successful in holding the level close to this value. 
Figure 62 – inlet and outlet flows at a high gain
However, now look at figure 62 – this shows the input (red) and output (blue) flowrates 
from the tank (you won’t be able to see the two traces as they overlap). The high gain 
means that the controller is moving the valve a long way in response to level changes, and 
the variations in the inlet flowrate are being passed straight through to the outlet.
Dropping the controller gain results in much more variation in level (figure 64), but also 
reduces the variation in flowrate that is passed through the tank (figure 63). The tank is 
being used for surge control.

11.3.1	CALCULATING THE GAIN FOR LEVEL CONTROL APPLICATIONS
If the plan is to use the capacity of a vessel to even out variations in the inlet flow, then 
it is possible to calculate an appropriate gain directly from a knowledge of the maximum 
allowable variations in the level, and the maximum changes in the disturbance flowrate. The 
maximum variation in level will be when the system comes to steady-state after a maximum 
change in disturbance flowrate. At this point, the manipulated flowrate needs to be equal 
to the disturbance flowrate, so the change in the manipulated flowrate needs to equal the 
change in the disturbance, i.e.
G  #4<@L  7 
Hence, the gain can be calculated. Note that the gain that is calculated is the product of the 
controller and valve gain (i.e. the gain between the measurement and the change in flowrate).
Example:
What gain would be required to limit changes in level to ±0.5m, when the inlet flowrate 
changes by ±5m3.h-1.
#4<@  

  
 ?\ ;aZ
? 
The controller gain would need to be obtained from this value from a knowledge of the 
valve gain. Adjustments would also have to be made to deal with the dimensionless gains 
that are used in all controllers. In practice the gains on level control systems are usually 
adjusted by trial and error, guided by prior knowledge.

11.4	 INTEGRAL ONLY CONTROL
Although integral-only control isn’t commonly used (and is impossible to implement using 
the classical PID algorithm) it is useful to consider its behaviour as it sheds light on the 
contribution integral action makes when mixed with the other control modes.
An algorithm for integral-only control is:
64   &i
L7F  <4E 
The integral gain, &i,  is an adjustable constant. In the classical algorithm it is made up of 
two other constants, i.e.
&i  &f
Pi
 
changing either &f  or Pi  will change the value of the integral gain, and hence the effect of 
integral action. However if the controller gain is changed then this will affect the proportional 
and derivative components as well (which makes controller tuning a bit easier). In mixed 
mode (e.g. PI or PID) controllers the relative effect of integral action is adjusted by changing 
the integral time constant.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL 
FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS

PID Controller algorithm
Now, let’s look at an integral-only controller’s response to a constant error (let L  !  where 
E is a constant). In this case the controller output is:
64  &i
!7F  <4E 
64  &i!F  <4E 
So, a pure-integral controller will respond to a constant error with a controller output that 
increases linearly with time, with a gradient which is dependent on the size of the error 
and on the integral gain.
This is the big advantage of the integral term – while an error is present in the system, 
integral action will always be changing the controller output to try to eliminate the error. 
The integral part of a PID control will only stop changing the controller output when the 
error becomes equal to zero. A controller which has integral action enabled will not suffer 
from steady-state offsets – these will always be eventually eliminated by the integral part 
of the algorithm.
There is a practical downside to the continuous integration of the error and hence the 
continuous change in controller output. In real systems there is a limit on the range of 
any manipulation that can be applied – a valve can’t be more closed than fully closed, nor 
more open than fully open. A pure integral controller won’t recognise this – it will continue 
to integrate the error even when the controller output has reached it high or low limit 
(this is known as output saturation). This causes problems when the error reduces – the 
large error integral that has been built up will hold the output against the limit for a long 
time, resulting in the measured value grossly overshooting the setpoint. In extreme cases 
this behaviour, which is called integral saturation or reset windup, or just windup, can cause 
the output of the controller to oscillate between its high and low limits. All controllers 
are protected against local windup (windup caused by the limits of that controller being 
reached). This is often done by simply switching off the integration of the error when an 
output limit is reached, and then switching it back on when the output moves off the limit. 
Saturation is a potential problem, however, when multiple controllers are connected in a 
cascade arrangement – this is described later.

PID Controller algorithm
Derivative action works on the derivative of the error. It only changes the controller output 
when this derivative is non-zero. Provided the error isn’t changing, derivative action will 
do nothing at all, regardless of the actual value of the error. As a mechanism for reducing 
error, derivative action is useless.
When working with the other control modes, however, derivative action can result in 
significant control performance improvements. Derivative action generates a controller output 
change which is proportional to the rate of change of the error. If the error derivative is 
large and positive (i.e. the error is rapidly increasing) then derivative action will make a 
big positive change in the control action – it will apply lots of effort to try to reduce the 
future error. On the other hand, if the error derivative is large and negative (i.e. the error 
is rapidly decreasing) then this is probably because excess control action has already been 
applied and the measured value is likely to significantly overshoot the setpoint. In this case 
(with a large negative error derivative) derivative action will make a big negative change in 
the control action to try to reduce the rate of setpoint approach. Using derivative action 
alongside the other control modes can stabilise the controlled response and allow higher 
gains and shorter integral time constants to be used, and so improve the quality of control.
However, despite the potential improvements that derivative action can provide, there are 
two reasons that it isn’t frequently used: it’s awkward to tune; and it has real problems 
with noisy systems. Derivative action is difficult to tune because it only really improves 
controlled response through its interactions with the other control modes. Changing the 
gain or integral time constant will change the effect that the derivative action has. This can 
lead to a long, and expensive, trial and error tuning process. However, the second problem 
(it’s sensitivity to noise) is even more serious.

Figure 65 shows some moisture measurement information from a grain dryer in a whisky 
distillery. The important thing to notice is the spikes and ‘rapid’ fluctuations in both 
traces. The real process was a big rotating dryer (over 4m long and 2m in diameter) which 
contained several tonnes of grain. This had a time constant measured in hours, and this can 
be seen clearly on the trace on the right, where the controller moves the moisture content 
from just under 15% down towards the setpoint of 12.5%. On top of the real process 
variation there is a whole lot of random noise that is superimposed. The grain in the dryer 
isn’t perfectly mixed and the infra-red sensor (used for moisture measurement) only looked 
at a small portion. Sometimes the grain that was measured could have come from direct 
contact with the heated surface and so be much dryer than the bulk, and other times grain 
that hadn’t really touched the heaters would be scanned. These variations gave ‘spikes’ in 
the moisture measurement.

PID Controller algorithm
Imagine what would happen if a measurement signal of this sort was fed directly into a 
controller with derivative action. The derivative part of the controller generates a change 
in output that is proportional to the error derivative, and the spikes would produce huge 
values of this (even if the error wasn’t large, the derivative is). This would cause the derivative 
action to make large changes to the controller output, which would then be applied to 
the process causing large, real, changes to the controlled variable. Very quickly the whole 
system would become unstable. 
If derivative control is to be used on a system, then any noise needs to be filtered out. This 
is relatively straight forward when the noise is of a significantly different frequency, compared 
to real process changes. In temperature control in large tanks the noise frequency will be 
multiple Hz, compared to the vessel time constants of several hours and the noise can be 
almost completely removed without affecting the process signal. In faster systems, like flow 
control, where the noise and real measurement change at similar rates it is impossible to 
remove the noise without significantly degrading the process measurement, and derivative 
action should never be used.
11.6	 PROPORTIONAL-INTERGRAL (PI) CONTROL
PI control is by far the most common type of feedback control in the process industries. It is 
achieved by simply setting the derivative time constant to zero, producing the PI algorithm:
64   &f L  
Pi
L7F  <4E 
With the classical algorithm, the controller gain affects both the proportional and integral 
parts of the algorithm. To change the relative balance between the two, the integral time 
constant is adjusted.
In the PI algorithm, the proportional part provides the immediate, fast, response to errors 
entering the system. The integral part of the algorithm then removes any residual steady-
state error.

Figure 66 shows the results of a simulation of full PID control of a third-order process. 
The top plot shows the values of the controlled variable (in red) and the constant setpoint 
(the green line). The process was disturbed at time t=0 by injecting a step disturbance, and 
the PID controller attempted to counteract the effects of this disturbance. In the three 
plots below the controlled variable, I’ve separated out the contributions made to the overall 
controller output by the proportional, integral and derivative parts.

At point ‘A’ the disturbance has caused the controlled variable to move away from the 
setpoint, but the error is fairly small. Proportional action has gone positive, but isn’t too large 
as the error is small. Integral action has also gone positive, but the effect is small, because 
the error and the length of time it has existed are tiny. Derivative action has gone positive, 
and to a larger extent than the other two control modes. Although the error is small, the 
error derivative is large. By applying a large positive control action the derivative term will 
act to reduce this error derivative and so reduce the amount of deviation from the setpoint. 
At point ‘B’ the controlled variable has reached its maximum positive deviation from the 
setpoint. The proportional action is now generating its maximum positive effect (remember 
that it generates an action which is proportional to error). The effect of integral action has 
increased, but is still well below its maximum value – the time hasn’t been sufficient to 
build up a big error integral. Derivative action is at zero as the direction of change switches.

PID Controller algorithm
At point ‘C’, the error is still positive but the controlled variable is moving back towards the 
setpoint. The proportional term is still producing a positive control action, but less than the 
maximum. The integral term is adding a large positive contribution, as it has been integrating 
the error over all the time since the disturbance entered the system. Derivative action is 
now producing a negative contribution to the overall control action – it is reducing the 
effect of the other two control modes. This is because the error derivative is now negative. 
Derivative action is slowing the rate of approach to the setpoint and hence the size of the 
subsequent undershoot of the setpoint. 
At point ‘D’ the controlled variable dips below the setpoint, and the error becomes negative. 
Proportional action switches negative as a result, and is trying to drive the controlled variable 
back up. Integral action remains positive – it has built up a big positive integrated error. 
The output from the integral term is a bit less that its maximum value because the negative 
error has started to eat away at the accumulated positive error integral. The derivative term 
is still negative as the error derivative is negative, and derivative action is working with the 
proportional term to pull the controlled value back towards the setpoint. At point ‘E’ the 
system has now almost reached steady-state. The controlled variable is sitting on the setpoint 
and so the error is zero. The proportional and derivative terms’ contribution have dropped 
to zero as the error and error derivative are zero. Integral action is, however, significantly 
non-zero. This is because the integral action is applying all the steady-state correction that 
is required to precisely counteract the effects of the disturbance. Although the other two 
control models are doing nothing at the final steady state, they did contribute significantly 
to the dynamic behaviour of the response. 
11.8	 OTHER FORMS OF PID ALGORITHM
The classical form of the PID algorithm is only one of many that are available. In the past 
individual manufacturers had their own takes on the algorithm and supplied controllers 
with these ideas built in. Nowadays most modern controllers offer a choice in the type of 
algorithm that the controller uses. There usually aren’t strong reasons to use one algorithm 
over another; it’s often just a matter of taste and what the particular control engineer is 
used to.

 <4E 
This is a bit of a mess of an algorithm that is a historical artefact; it can be implemented 
using a single pneumatic or electronic amplifier. The problem with the algorithm is that 
all of the terms interact with each other making it difficult to relate the output of the 
controller to the individual modes (which is handy to be able to do for controller tuning).
11.8.3	ALGORITHM TWEAKS
There are lots of minor and not so minor tweaks for the PID algorithm that may be 
implemented in particular controllers.
Derivative action is sometimes based on the derivative of the measured variable, rather 
than the error. This deals with the potential problem that can be caused with the standard 
method (derivative of error) when somebody introduces a step change in setpoint (and so 
creates an infinite error derivative!)
Almost all practical derivative action is implemented with a built-in first-order filter. In early 
controllers this was essential, as it was the only way that the derivative could be obtained – 
an analogue mechanism can’t ‘save’ old values like a digital system. With current controllers, 
the filter provides protection against sudden changes in setpoint (if the derivative is error 
based) and spikes in the measurement (although the measurement should already be filtered 
sufficiently outside of the controller).
Modifications can also be made to proportional action. Using the square of the error 
dramatically increases the change on large errors, but reduces the action on smaller errors. 
However, this produces a non-linear controller that can be awkward to tune.
11.8.4	DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE PID ALGORITHM
The PID algorithm needs to be altered to work in digital systems that rely on sampling 
the process (the measurements are numbers that represent snapshots of the process state).
The positional algorithm is a direct conversion of the analogue algorithm into its digital 
equivalent, and generates the actual value of the controller output:

L =      =  error at the current sample
	
	
	F       =  sample interval for the controller (the time between successive 
snapshots)
An alternative form of this, called the velocity algorithm is much more commonly used. 
This is formed by subtracting the previous output (at sample k-1) from the current one:

The control algorithm gives the change required in the controller output, and so this needs 
to be added to the previous output. The reason that this form of the algorithm is popular is 
because it provides bumpless transfer from manual to automatic operation in the controller. 
Most processes are moved to new operating points under manual control. When the operator 
gets the process near to where it should be they will flip the switch to put the controller 
into automatic mode. With the positional algorithm, if the error is not exactly zero then 
the proportional term will cause a sudden change in the controller output and this will be 
transmitted to the process causing a sudden disturbance (a bump). If the velocity algorithm 
is used, then a non-zero initial error won’t cause an immediate proportional response (since 
the proportional action operates on the change of error). Instead, integral action will activate 
(this will be tuned to be much less aggressive than proportional) and make gradual changes 
in the controller output to reduce the error.

MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Analysis of simple feedback control systems using transfer functions and block 
diagrams
•	 Analysis of the response of first- and second-order process under pure proportional 
control
•	 Analysis of the response of first-order processes under pure integral control.
Control system analysis involves using mathematics to understand the behaviour of control 
systems. This lets us predict how particular systems will respond and, more interestingly, allow 
us to design control algorithms and systems that will produce particular desired behaviours.
12.1	 ANALYSIS OF A TYPICAL FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEM
Transfer functions, which we have already covered, and block diagrams are a very powerful 
way of analysing control systems. A typical feedback control system is illustrated in figure 67.
Figure 67 – a typical feedback control system
GC is the transfer function for the controller algorithm; GCV is the control valve TF; GP 
is the manipulation process transfer function (i.e. the ‘process’ by which the manipulation 
affects the controlled output); Gd is the disturbance process transfer function; and Gm is 
the transfer function of the measuring instrument.
Knl
 ¡E¢  is the Laplace transform of the setpoint signal (expressed in deviation variables);

controlled. The input to GP is the manipulation signal, which is being adjusted by the

Using the rules of block diagram algebra, we can get an expression that shows us the overall 
transfer functions between the setpoint and controlled variable and the disturbance and 
controlled variable. To do this, start from the right hand side of the block diagram and 
work backwards.

The    term is simply the switch on the controller to move it between reverse and direct

valve and process gains. The control valve gain sign will switch depending on whether an 
air-to-open or air-to-close valve is used (air-to-open will have a positive gain – an increase 
in input will lead to an increase in flow). The sign on the process gain is entirely dependent 
on the process model. Ultimately, we want to choose a controller action that gives a positive 
summation on the left side of the equation above (and also a positive setpoint gain), i.e.

Control system analysis
The control valve and measurement transfer functions are real – there is a gain between 
the controller output and the flowrate, and the measurement and the signal transmitted 
back to the controller, and both devices will have dynamics. However, for simplicity, we’ll 
be assuming that the dynamics are very fast (i.e. time constants close to zero) and that the 
gains are absorbed into the process transfer functions (i.e. Gp contains not just the process 
gain, but the gains of the control valve and measuring instrument too).

if the time constants for the disturbance and manipulation are the same (as they often 
are). ‘u’ is the symbol normally used for the manipulated variable, ‘d’ for a disturbance, 
and the ‘K’s are the manipulation and disturbance steady-state gains. Note these are shown 
as positive in this example, but can be either positive or negative – it depends completely 
on the process model.
We can represent this controlled system on a block diagram shown in figure 68.

If the system was open-loop (with the controller switched off), then the steady state change 
in the output on a disturbance change would be &v7.  Adding proportional control has 
reduced this change in the output by a factor of   &|&f.  The closed loop disturbance 
gain of the system is now:
&v
  &|&f
 
When the disturbance changes, there will be a steady-state offset even when the controller 
is active. However this offset will be smaller when the controller is active than when the 
system is open-loop. The controller gain, &f,  is an adjustable parameter and can be altered 
to provide any desired reduction in offset – as the gain approaches infinity, the offset will 
approach zero.

A controller with no offset would have a setpoint gain of one. Again, larger values of 
controller gain will make this residual steady-state offset smaller.
Now let’s look at the effect of control on dynamic performance. To do this, rearrange the 
closed loop TFs slightly to get them into standard form:

Adding the controller has not changed the order of the response – the controlled process 
will still respond in a first-order manner, but it has changed the gains (as we’ve already seen) 
and the time constant. The time constant has been reduced by a factor of   &|&f,  and 
so the controlled process is faster than the open loop process. The higher the controller 
gain is set, the faster the controlled response.
In a pure first-order process there is no limit to how high the controller gain can be set. It 
is impossible to destabilise the controlled response by increasing gain. However, all practical 
processes are third-order or higher (see earlier) and these can always be destabilised by excessive 
controller gain. Eliminating offsets by using very large controller gains is never practical.
12.4	 EXAMPLE OF A FIRST ORDER PROCESS UNDER 
PROPORTIONAL CONTROL
A stirred tank with refrigeration coil is used to cool a process stream. The inlet temperature 
of the process stream is subject to disturbances and it is desired to use a proportional 
controller to regulate the outlet temperature of the tank by manipulating the power of the 
refrigeration unit.

where T is the tank outlet temperature, Tin, the inlet temperature and Q the refrigeration 
power in W. The time constants of the TFs are in minutes.
If a proportional controller is used, what gain is required to reduce the steady-state change 
in outlet temperature to 0.1oC after the inlet temperature changes in a step by 5oC? Sketch 
the response of the controlled system and indicate how long it will take to come to steady-
state. What will be the change in refrigeration power at the new steady-state?

A proportional controller is to be used to regulate against disturbances and to provide 
setpoint tracking. Answer the following:
a)	Sketch the open loop disturbance response
b)	What is the maximum gain that can be used in the proportional controller before 
the response will tend to oscillate?
c)	At this gain, what is the steady-state offset on disturbance changes, as a percentage 
of the open loop change expected?
d)	At the same game, what is the offset on setpoint changes, as a percentage of the 
change in setpoint.
a)	The steady-state gain on the disturbance is -2. To find out more about the response 
we need to get the roots of the characteristic equation:

so, the roots are -0.5 and -1. The roots are both negative, real and distinct – the response 
is stable and overdamped (Figure 70).

disturbance term is zero – when the system comes to steady-state the effect of the disturbance 
will be completely eliminated. You can see that the controller gain, &f,  appears in the 
characteristic equation. The form of the second order response can be altered by changing 
the controller gain. Higher gains will lead to less and less damping (moving an overdamped 
process eventually to underdamping).

13	 CONTROLLER TUNING
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 What’s involved in configuring a controller to suit a process
•	 What is a good controller performance
•	 Algorithmic methods of controller tuning (open-loop, closed-loop and lambda tuning)
•	 Trial and error tuning
•	 Control loop health monitoring
All controllers need to be tuned to suit a particular process application. In the case of PID 
controllers it’s necessary to set appropriate values for the adjustable constants (controller 
gain, reset time and derivative time constant). There are a variety of methods for doing this 
that are discussed in this section.
Modern control systems can also monitor the controlled system behaviour over time and 
use this information to spot potential problems. This loop monitoring is also discussed in 
this section.
13.1	 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO TUNE A PID CONTROLLER?
There are a number of stages involved in setting up a PID controller for a particular 
application:
1.	The direction of control action needs to be specified. This is completely dependent 
on the process (manipulation) gain and the type of valve (air-to-open or air-to-
close) that is used, but the switch in the controller needs to be set in the ‘direct’ 
or ‘reverse’ position before proceeding.
2.	It is necessary to decide what types of control modes are required. A proportional-
only controller is the simplest, but has a problem with offset. PI is a bit more 
complicated to tune, but doesn’t have offset problems. PID can, potentially, give 
the best results but extreme care needs to be taken with noise. If derivative action 
is to be used, then noise filters need to be in place before tuning takes place.
3.	The controller constants need to be set at values appropriate to the process. High 
gain processes usually have low controller gains. Processes with long time constants 
usually have longer integral time constants. Most controller tuning will involve 
some amount of trial and error. The process of setting the controller constants to 
suit a particular process is known as controller tuning.

13.2	 HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT IS A GOOD 
CONTROLLER PERFORMANCE?
In theory this should be easy – you choose the setup that maximises the economic 
performance of the system. However chemical plants are complicated systems and usually 
have hundreds of control loops. It is virtually impossible to assess the economic impact of 
a particular controller’s performance. In place of a direct economic assessment then, other 
measures are used. These can be split into two broad categories ‘academic’ measures and 
‘practical’ measures.
13.2.1	ACADEMIC MEASURES OF CONTROL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
If controlled system responses are to be compared scientifically, then it is useful to have a 
single number that can indicate the superiority, or otherwise of a particular scheme. This 
is particularly the case in academic papers, where the authors are often seeking to compare 
some new proposed technique with existing methods.
The most common academic measures that are used are Integral Absolute Error (IAE); Integral 
Squared Error (ISE); Integral Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE).

Integral Absolute Error (IAE):
This is a measure that integrates the absolute value of the error signal over a particular test 
period. All of the academic measures require the test period (usually after a disturbance or 
setpoint change) to be stated as part of the problem definition. The absolute value of the 
error is taken to avoid negative errors cancelling out positive values (if the absolute wasn’t 
taken then a system in sustained oscillation would have an error integral of zero).
%! 
L 7F 
IAE treats all errors equally. There is no weighting against very large errors, nor against 
errors that persist for a long time.
Integral Squared Error (ISE):
This measure integrates the square of the error over the test period.
%.! 
L[7F 
ISE weights against larger errors (because it squares them). To optimise for ISE, a controller 
will have to eliminate larger errors quickly and this may mean tolerating smaller errors for 
a longer time.
Integral Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE):
This measure integrates the absolute error, but weights the error with the time. 
%/! 
F L 7F 
Because of this time weighting, errors that exist later in the experiment will have a much 
larger effect than errors at the start. A controller optimised for ITAE will tend to eliminate 
errors quickly, even if this means larger errors in the early part of the response.

 Figure 72 – A PI controller optimsed for the three response measures
Figure 72 shows the response of a PI controlled system (a third-order system with a negative 
zero) with the gain and integral time constant optimised for the three different control 
measures. ISE is producing the fastest response. The controller is trying to eliminate the 
large error as quickly as possible. The aggressiveness of the controller is causing slightly larger 
overshoots, but the larger errors are being eliminated quickly. The ISE tuned controller is 
taking longer to eliminate the residual steady-state error – the tuning emphasises proportional 
action for maximum speed of response, and small errors are acceptable. The IAE tuning 
isn’t as aggressive as ISE – all errors are treated equally. The ITAE tuned controller is the 
least aggressive. The priority with this controller is to damp down oscillation – errors that 
exist later in the test will be highly weighted by the measure.
13.2.2	PRACTICAL MEASURES OF CONTROL PERFORMANCE
The academic measures are of little use in industrial applications. It is virtually impossible 
to get a fixed period of operation where other disturbances are absent from the system and 
this makes the comparisons using the academic measures impossible.

Instead, much more simple, but robust measures are used. These include:
•	 Amount of steady-state offset.
•	 Rise time: the time taken to rise to the new setpoint for the first time after a 
setpoint change. Controllers in the process industries are mainly used for disturbance 
rejection, not servo action. However, disturbances, by definition, can not be called 
up to order and controllers are normally tuned by observing their response to small 
setpoint changes around the nominal operating point.
•	 Settling time: the time take to settle within a fixed amount (often 5%) of setpoint 
after a change. Rise time and settling time are opposed. A system with a short rise 
time is likely to be aggressive, with lots of overshoot and oscillation – leading to 
long settling times. A system tuned to have a short settling time is likely to be 
quite sedate, with limited overshoot and oscillations, but quite a long rise time.
•	 Decay ratio: the decay ratio is the ratio of the first and second oscillation peaks 
after a setpoint change. The rule of thumb is that a decay ratio of ¼ represents a 
good balance between rise time and settling time, and this is often the target used 
by control engineers when carrying out trial and error tuning.

13.3	 SOME METHODS OF CONTROLLER TUNING
There are a number of ways in which at least initial estimates of the correct tuning parameters 
for PID controllers can be obtained. None of these methods are foolproof, however, and the 
very best controller tuning often requires some trial and error. In industry, it is relatively 
common to find controllers that haven’t been tuned at all – the instrument people set 
the correct direct of control action and leave the default factory settings for the control 
parameters. The main reason for this is that controller tuning can be time consuming and 
also requires engineers with the required skill set – these are relatively rare. However, often, 
good tuning can pay for the time taken many times over.
13.3.1	CLOSED LOOP METHODS – ZIEGLER-NICHOLS
This method requires the controller to be put into automatic and set up for proportional-
only control. A series of small setpoint changes are then made and the response of the loop 
observed. The object is to get the loop into a sustained oscillation by altering the controller 
gain. If oscillations in the loop die away after a setpoint change, then the gain is increased. 
If they start to grow (i.e. the system is unstable) then the gain is reduced (quickly!) Once 
sustained oscillations are achieved, the controller gain is noted (this is called the ultimate 
gain) and the period of oscillation (known as the ultimate period ) is also measured.These 
values are then used to obtain the controller constants from table 10.

Table 11 – Tyreus and Luyben controller settings
The Zielger-Nichols method sounds attractive at first, as the process remains under control 
during the required tests. However, there are a number of problems with it that means that 
it is rarely used in practical situations:
•	 Many processes have slow dynamics, and it can take a long time to form a pattern 
of oscillations that can be used to determine whether they shrinking, growing or 
holding steady.
•	 All processes are subject to random disturbances which will almost certainly interfere 
with a long duration test.
•	 The method requires the process to be driven to the edge of stability. Without 
careful monitoring of the test this could lead to serious problems.
13.3.2	OPEN-LOOP METHODS – PROCESS REACTION CURVE
Process information for tuning can be obtained by carrying out a step test on the open 
loop system. This is done by putting the controller in manual and making a small step 
change in output. A first-order plus dead-time model is then fitted to this resulting output 
response (see earlier in the course) producing values for the manipulation process gain, &l,  
the time constant, τ, and the dead-time, Fv,  and the controller parameters obtained from 
one of the sets of published formulae (see tables 12 and 13).

Controller tuning
13.3.4	LAMBDA (OR IMC) TUNING
This is a ‘model based’ technique that seems to have become popular in industry (particularly 
in the USA). The technique is basically a model-based control design called Internal 
Model Control, but many of those writing about it seem to think that it has some sort of 
magical powers! 
The advantage of model based control is that you can design the controller to produce a 
desired response rather than the response being adjusted after installation by altering controller 
parameters. A true model-based design would require high-order, accurate, models, but the 
lambda tuning technique approximates the process model by using a FOPDT (first-order 
plus dead-time) model.
This model approximation is the same as that used in Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon 
tuning, but those methods use tuning constants that minimise some error measure (e.g. ISE). 
Lambda tuning, on the other hand, uses tuning constants that should always produce an 
overdamped response to setpoint changes. It is still necessary to identify the gain, dead-time 
and time constant for the approximate model, but lamda tuning introduces another, design, 
parameter ‘λ’ that allows engineers to tailor the controlled response to different applications.
To tune a process using lamda tuning, the engineer first performs a step test and estimates 
the model gain (K), time constant (τ) and dead-time (Fv) (or identifies the model in some 
other way). The value of ‘λ’ then needs to be chosen. ‘λ’ is essentially the closed-loop time 
constant (if the model was perfect), and so the controlled response to a setpoint change will 
be complete after 3λ to 5λ. However, this is only true in general if the approximate model 
is a good representation of the real process. Model error can mess up lambda tuning and 
produce responses with oscillation. To avoid this large values of ‘λ’ have to be used and 
these provide what is known as robustness to the controller design (the closed loop response 
will behave in the expected way even when there are fairly large errors in the model).
A common recommendation for lambda is that it should be three times the value of the 
assumed process time constant or dead-time, whichever is bigger. Many authors suggest 
modifications to this for different types of process, but the closed-loop response is always 
slower that the open-loop response.

Controller tuning
Once lambda is chosen, the following rules are used for PI controller tuning:
&f 
P
&l N  Fv
 
Pi  P 
where	 	
&f =  controller gain
	
	
Pi =  integral time constant
	
	
N =  lambda 
	
	
&l =  process gain
	
	
P =  process time constant
	
	
Fv =  process dead-time
Advantages of Lambda tuning are:
•	 The slow setpoint reponse means that changing setpoints has limited effect on other 
loops in the process. This has made lambda tuning popular in the paper industry.
•	 Multiple loops can be ‘synchronised’ to have similar closed loop responses.
•	 Important loops can be given precedence by allocating smaller lambda values to them.
•	 The method is robust and tolerant to pretty poor process testing and model-fitting.
Disadvantages of Lambda tuning
•	 The response is really slow – slower than open loop
•	 As a result of the slow response, disturbance rejection is terrible
•	 Special tuning rules need to be applied for non-standard processes (e.g. integrators 
or open-loop unstable/oscillatory)
13.3.5	AUTOTUNING
Many PID controllers are sold with an autotuning feature. Usually this is a specific function 
that needs to be activated, runs for a period, and then stops. adaptive controllers that 
continuously modify their parameters to match changing process conditions are popular in 
academia, but very uncommon in industry. Using an adaptive controller requires absolute 
confidence that the adaption algorithm won’t do something horrible.

There are a variety of autotuning techniques used by different manufacturers ranging from 
relay-based methods (a bit like an automatic version of Ziegler-Nichols) to expert systems 
(that look at controlled responses like an expert might). Although autotuning can be useful, 
it can’t be relied on as a complete solution to the tuning problem for the following reasons:
•	 Just like the manual closed-loop and open-loop techniques, the formula used to 
calculate controller constants from response parameters are not guaranteed to give 
the best results in all cases.
•	 In interacting systems (where there are many manipulations and controlled variables, 
and manipulations can affect several controlled variables) the behaviour of controllers 
will change depending on whether other controllers are in manual or auto. This 
is very common in the process industries (it exists, to some extent, in all practical 
processes). and automatic tuning cannot take this into account.

13.3.6	TRIAL AND ERROR TUNING
Trial and error tuning involves someone with some expertise playing with the loop and 
adjusting the tuning constants to achieve the desired performance. Skilled tuners can 
produce good results in less time that it takes to run Ziegler-Nichols or reaction curve tests. 
Tuning of important loops will always be finished with some manual tweaking as experts 
can always produce more tailored tuning that the general algorithms used in the methods 
or in auto-tuning algorithms. The methods used for manual tuning vary with the person 
doing the tuning, but one procedure is:
1.	Set up the controller in P-only mode
2.	Adjust gain until approximately ¼ decay ratio on small setpoint changes
3.	If offset unacceptable, then reduce gain by around 20% and add integral action.
4.	Adjust gain/integral time constant according to the form of response obtained.
5.	Derivative control needs special considerations
At step 4, the gain and integral time constant needs to be adjusted – the map shown in 
figure 64 could be useful.
 Figure 73 – Tuning map for PI control
The ‘ideal’ tuning in figure 73 is in the centre of the map, with quick rise time, settling 
time and quarter decay ratio. At the bottom left the gain is too low (the immediate change 
in output on setpoint change is small) and the integral time constant is too long (it’s taking 
ages for the controlled variable to rise to the setpoint). At the top left, the gain is too high 
(the process has been driven into sustained oscillations) but the integral time constant is 
still too long – the centre of the oscillations is taking ages to centre on the new setpoint. 
The rest of the map is self-explanatory.

13.4	 CONTROL LOOP HEALTH MONITORING
Controllers that were initially well tuned sometimes become less effective as time goes on. 
This can because of process changes, such as heat exchangers fouling or catalysts degrading, 
that cause the gains and dynamic parameters of the process response (and hence the required 
tuning) to change. Operating points may also change – production levels can be varied and, 
in some plants, the grade or even type of product produced can be changed.
Often these changes in the gains and dynamic parameters of the process cause only gradual 
reductions in controller performance that are not really noticed until the effects become 
really bad. 
Some modern SCADA (Scanning Control And Data Acquisition) systems can provide 
control loop health monitoring, which can monitor the loops in a plant and provide early 
warning of potential problems. Some of the things that can be monitored are:
•	 The fraction of time a loop spends in auto. If this changes, with the loop spending 
more time in manual then it suggests that operators are unhappy with the loop 
performance.
•	 The percentage of the operating time the output from the controller is saturated. 
All controllers will occasionally saturate (the output bumps against a limit) but 
when they do they are no longer adequately controlling the process. An increasing 
length of time spent saturated suggests that the available control effort is no longer 
suitable for the process – perhaps the valve needs resized or pipework cleaned.
•	 The oscillation index is a measure used to characterise the amount of oscillation in 
a controlled response. If this changes significantly it indicates that something has 
happened to put the loop out of tune.
•	 Variability in controlled variable and manipulation can be measured in a number 
of ways (e.g. by calculating the standard deviation over a fixed, moving, period) If 
the process is assumed to be operating in a roughly constant way, then changes in 
variability suggest something has changed in the loop.
•	 IAE and other control measures can be used in a moving period basis (e.g. the 
IAE is calculated over 50 hours, but the period covered moves forward every five 
minutes) and used as alternative measures of controlled variable variability.
•	 Stiction represents the force required to get something moving from a standing 
start, and takes into account the impulse but also the ‘stickiness’ involved. Control 
valves drive valve stems up and down through sealing systems. When an air pressure 
is applied, the valve won’t start moving until the pressure reaches a level sufficient 
to overcome the stiction between the stem and the seal. As the seal wears, or gets 
contaminated, the stiction involved will change, and consistent changes may suggest 
the need to service the valve.

•	 Settling time is another measure associated with variability, and for it to be used 
effectively requires that the process operates in pretty much the same way over time.
•	 Operator activity can also be recorded. This includes changing setpoints or flipping 
the controller from auto to manual and back again. Increases in the amounts of 
operator activity on a loop suggest that they are giving it more attention and that 
there is a potential problem.
13.5	 CONTROL LOOP DIAGNOSTICS
When there is a problem with a control loop, it usually isn’t the controller that’s at fault. 
Instead it’s much more likely to be one of the other loop components: an instrument 
might be faulty, or in need of recalibration; a control valve may be sticking; there may be 
interference in a communications line. It’s important to eliminate other possible trouble 
sources before attempting to retune the controller. Retuning may mask other problems for 
a while, but it won’t eliminate them. Even when it’s decided that retuning is necessary it’s 
worth trying to find out why – has the process changed? Has new equipment been installed? 
Are heat exchangers fouling? Only after a reasonable explanation for the need for retuning 
been established should the controller actually be adjusted.

CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Extensions to basic feedback control: cascade; selective and override control
•	 Ratio control
•	 Steady-state and dynamic feedforward control
Up to now we’ve been talking about a standard feedback loop, where there is a controller, 
final control element, process and measuring device all connected together in a loop. In 
practice there are often modifications made to this scheme for various purposes. Also, there 
is a completely different type of single-variable control, called feedforward control. These are 
the subjects of this chapter.
14.1	 CASCADE CONTROL

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL 
FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
164
More advanced single-loop control arrangements
Cascade control is very common in the process industries. To understand how it works, 
consider the process in figure 74. This represents a CSTR with both the inlet and outlet 
valves being manipulated. The outlet valve is being used to control the level in the reactor, 
and the inlet to control the outlet concentration by varying the flow through the reactor (and 
hence the mean residence time). Let’s look at the operation of the concentration controller. 
This will work for changes in most of the potential disturbances: e.g. inlet concentration 
changes; temperature changes; etc. However, it won’t give the best possible performance 
for one of the most common types of disturbance: pressure variations in the feed line. 
These pressure variations could be caused by upstream changes (e.g. a change of level in a 
vessel) or by variations in density or and/or viscosity in the feedstream. The signal from the 
controller only sets the stem position of the valve, and if the pressure drop over the valve 
changes, then this will quickly lead to a change in the flowrate being delivered by the valve. 
The change in flowrate will then change the mean residence time in the reactor and lead to 
a gradual change in the outlet concentration. The concentration controller will detect this 
and act to eliminate the disturbance, but if the reactor is large, then the dynamics will be 
slow and it could take a considerable time for the controller to alter the inlet valve position 
to suit the new pressure.
A better way of regulating against inlet flow line pressure variations is shown in figure 75. 
In this P&ID a flow controller has been added onto the inlet flowrate. This flowrate can 
now be regulated against disturbances in the flow line pressure. The reponse of the loop 
will be very fast – the only significant dynamics are those of the valve and these will have 
a time constant of seconds, or less. There is a big problem with this scheme, however, 
and that is that we’ve given up controlling the outlet concentration from the reactor. Any 
disturbances, other than flow line pressure changes, will now cause the outlet concentration 
to drift from its desired value.

We need to be able to control the outlet concentration, but we have no valve available to 
allow a controller to be connected to the process. We do, however, have an input that we 
can use – the setpoint to the flow controller. If we plug the output of our concentration 
controller into the flow controller setpoint, we’ll get the scheme shown in figure 76. This 
arrangement is called cascade control – we’ve cascaded the output of XC001, the primary or 
master controller, onto the setpoint of FC001, the secondary or slave controller. If a disturbance 
enters the process that causes the outlet concentration to change (such as a change in inlet 
concentration) then XC001 will deal with this by altering the flow setpoint. FC001 will 
track this new setpoint and change the flowrate through the reactor. The overall control of 
concentration will be relatively sluggish as it will be dictated by the dynamics of the reactor. 
However, if an inlet pressure disturbance occurs this will be corrected very quickly by the 
flow controller, leaving very little for the concentration controller to deal with.

Figure 76 – Reactor with cascade control
Cascade control is widely used in the process industries. The most common application are 
controllers cascading onto flow controller secondaries – that way the primary controllers are 
adjusting flowrates rather than valve stem positions, but other cascade loops are used too. 
For cascade to be applicable, the following conditions must be present:
•	 The overall process must be made up of at least two sub-processes, and the outputs 
of the sub-processes must be measurable
•	 The secondary process (the flow system in the example) must have a strong causal 
effect on the primary (the outlet reactor concentration in the example).
•	 The secondary process needs to be at least five times as fast as the primary (if it 
isn’t then cascade won’t produce performance improvements).
Cascade control is easy to set up, provided it’s done in a systematic way.
1.	Set-up the secondary controller first. Switch the controller to accept a local setpoint 
and then tune it using one of the techniques discussed earlier.
2.	Prepare the primary. The measurement and setpoint limits will be set as normal, but 
the output of the controller is now going to the setpoint of the secondary. If the 
control system in use simply specifies outputs as a percentage (i.e. 0–100%), then 
nothing special needs to be done. However, many SCADA systems use engineering 
units, and appropriate units and ranges need to be set to make the output signal 
match the setpoint of the target secondary controller (for the example above, the 
units might be set to m3.h-1, and the limits set to whatever are appropriate limits 
for the flowrate (but see below about saturation).

3.	Connect the primary output to the secondary setpoint (with a wire, or a software 
link) and then flip the secondary controller’s setpoint source switch from local to 
remote (so that the setpoint is now taken from the output of the primary). Put 
the secondary controller into AUTO.
4.	Now tune the primary as normal – the secondary controller effectively becomes 
part of the process being controlled.
Integral saturation can be a problem in higher level controllers in a cascade system. single 
loop controllers are usually protected against saturation in their own outputs (e.g. when the 
output hits a limit, the integral action is switched off). However, the primary controller in 
a cascade loop isn’t directly connected to the process. It is possible for the primary to set 
an output that causes the secondary controller to saturate (i.e. the valve moves to a limit). 
Without extra protection, the primary won’t know this, and will continue to integrate the 
error. To deal with this there needs to be extra communication between the secondary and 
the primary to inform the primary of the saturation in the secondary – extra logic can then 
switch off the integral action in the primary. Most controllers have features that allow this 
extra anti-windup protection to be setup, but sometimes the engineers who have installed 
the control system don’t setup the protection properly. This should always be checked if a 
cascade loop is suffering from large overshoots on setpoint or disturbance changes.

In some pieces of equipment in chemical plant, the controlled variable can change not 
just with time, but also with the position it is measured in the equipment. An example of 
this is the temperature in an exothermic tubular reactor. In these reactors the temperature 
changes as the reactants move along the length of the reactor (figure 77). The reactants 
enter the reactor relatively cool, but then begin to react and get warmer. As the temperature 
increases the rate of reaction rises, increasing the rate of temperature increase. Eventually, 
however, the reactants become depleted and the rate slows down again. As the hot gases 
move along the reactor they meet colder and colder coolant that is flowing, in a jacket or 
tubes, counter-current to the reacting mixture. When the reactants are almost exhausted 
this cooling effect overcomes the reaction heating and the reacting mixture begins to cool. 
This leaves a temperature profile in the reactor similar to that in figure 77, where there is 
a clear ‘hot-spot’ in the reactor. Control of this hot-spot temperature is important: if it is 
too low, then the reaction may not progress to the extent desired, or catalyst may foul; if it 
is too high, then structural damage may be caused to the reactor. The problem is that the 
hot-spot doesn’t stay in a fixed position. As the flow rate of the reactants, inlet concentrations 
or inlet temperatures change, the hot-spot moves up and down the reactor.

Obviously a single temperature sensor is not going to be able to reliably capture the 
maximum temperature over the length of the reactor. Instead it will be necessary to use 
multiple sensors. However, this leaves us with the problem of how to connect these to the 
temperature controller. A controller can only deal with a single input. The way around this 
is process the signals, using what is called a computational unit, to extract the maximum 
and then feed this to the controller input. The control scheme is shown in figure 78. In 
this case we are using a unit to extract the maximum signal, but computational units can 
be used to extract the minimum and for other functions too. These computation units are 
available in all SCADA systems, but were also available, as discrete boxes, in the days of 
pneumatic controllers. The type of control scheme that has been set up for the reactor is 
called an auctioneering or selective control system.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL

More advanced single-loop control arrangements
We are limited in the number of things that we can simultaneously control in a plant 
by the available degrees of freedom (this concept is explained in the control system design 
section). Sometimes, however, it is necessary for variables that are not usually controlled to 
override an existing loop to maintain process operation, or to avoid damage to equipment. 
For example, consider the system in figure 79. The bottoms mole fraction (of the most 
volatile component) of this column is normally controlled by manipulating the steam flow 
to the reboiler. However, under a fault condition it is possible for the bottoms mole fraction 
to rise excessively. When this happens the controller increases the steam, and hence the 
vapour rate up the column to try to drive the volatiles away. At some point this vapour 
rate becomes so large that it interferes with the movement of liquid down the column and 
the column floods. At the flooding point the column is useless: not only bottoms mole 
fraction control is lost, but also the tops. A way to prevent this happening is to install the 
override control scheme shown in figure 80. In this scheme a differential pressure cell is 
fitted over a section of the column. Rises in the DP will indicate an approach to the flooding 
condition (as more vapour tries to force its way up the column). A pressure controller is 
setup to control this differential pressure by manipulating the steam flow. However, the mole 
fraction controller is still there to control the mole fraction under normal conditions, and 
this wants to manipulate the steam flow valve too. It is impossible for two outputs to be 
connected to the valve simultaneously, so the most appropriate one must be selected by a 
computational unit (in this case a minimum unit needs to be used). The scheme works are 
follows. Under normal conditions the DP will be well below the setpoint of the pressure 
controller, and so the pressure controller will be demanding a large steam flow to try to 
drive the DP upwards. At the same time the mole fraction controller will be operating, 
but will be requesting a smaller steam flow. The ‘min’ computational unit will select the 
minimum signal and so will connect the mole fraction controller to the valve. Under the 
fault condition, the mole fraction controller will demand more and more steam, until the 
DP eventually crosses the DP setpoint in the pressure controller. At this point, the output 
from the pressure controller will become the smallest and it will be connected to the valve. 
Differential pressure control will override bottoms mole fraction control. When overridden 
the bottoms mole fraction controller is no longer operating – we have lost control of the 
bottom composition. However the column will still be operating and control should still 
be possible at the top of the column.

14.4	 RATIO CONTROL
Ratio control is a common requirement in chemical processes. Many of the systems we work 
with require streams to be held within a certain ratio of each other, e.g. reactant streams 
into a reactor; reflux ratio in a distillation column; liquid to gas ratio in an absorber. The 
controller used for ratio control is the first example of non-feedback control in the course.
Figure 81 – Ratio control
A ratio control scheme always consists of at least two streams. The first is called the wild 
stream. This stream is not manipulated by the ratio scheme and represents a disturbance 
to the ratio being controlled. The other stream is the manipulated stream and this is the 
stream that is adjusted by the ratio controller. It is common to manipulate the stream 
through a cascade to a secondary flow controller – that way it is the flowrate of the stream 
that is manipulated rather than the valve position. An example of ratio control is given in 
figure 81. In this case the controller is setup to control the reflux ratio of the column. The 
distillate stream (monitored by FI001) is the wild stream – it is manipulated by the level 
controller, but is a disturbance to the ratio control system. MLT001 is the ratio controller 
itself. It is just a multiplier that multiplies the measured flowrate of the wild stream by 
the reflux ratio (which can be set in the device, or set remotely by another controller in a 
cascade) and then sends the result to the setpoint of the secondary flow controller (FC001).
Ratio controllers do not usually measure the ratio of the flows (the controlled variable), but 
instead measure the wild stream (a disturbance). This makes ratio control a simple form of 
feedforward control rather than feedback control.

14.5	 FEEDFORWARD CONTROL
Feedback control systems operate by monitoring the controlled variable, a process output, 
and adjusting the manipulation to drive this output towards the setpoint. The problem with 
a feedback control system is that a disturbance entering the system has to actually affect 
the process before it will be detected at the output and the correction process started. If 
the process includes large capacities, then large amounts of material can be altered by the 
disturbance and it can take a long time for the system to recover to the setpoint value.
Feedforward control offers an alternative strategy to improve disturbance rejection in processes 
with large capacities. A feedforward controller is one which measures the disturbance, a 
process input, rather than the controlled variable. The controller uses a model to estimate 
the effect this disturbance will have on the controlled variable and then another model to 
calculate the manipulation change which is required to precisely counteract the effects of 
the disturbance. In theory, if both the disturbance and manipulation models are perfect, it 
is possible for a feedforward controller to reject a disturbance with no change at all being 
observed in the controlled variable.

The object of the controller is to hold the output at the setpoint so, for controller design

and the design equation can be rearranged to produce the feedforward controller:
G E  
#l
 Knl


#l
 7¡E¢ 
If the real process (i.e. not the model) has the transfer functions #l and #g,  then the 
controlled system can be represented as in the block diagram in figure 82.
Note that there are no loops in a feedforward controller Provided that the controller and 
process are open loop stable, it isn’t possible to destabilise a feedforward controlled system. 
Equally, however, feedforward control can’t be expected to stabilise open loop un-stable 
processes (the special case of pole-zero cancellation just doesn’t happen in real life due to 
plant-model mismatch).

STEADY-STATE FEEDFORWARD CONTROL
There are two basic types of feedforward controller. The steady-state feedforward controller is 
designed around steady-state models of the manipulation and disturbance effects. These can 
be obtained from first principles steady-state modelling (and so can be made non-linear) 
but it’s much more common to use gain-only models. These gains can be obtained from 
transfer functions, if these are available, or from simple tests on the real process or on a 
steady-state simulation model (e.g. an Aspen flowsheet).
 Figure 83 – A steady-state feedforward controller
The modelled system for gain-only models is:
K E  &lG E  &g7¡E¢ 
as before, this can be re-arranged into a feedforward controller:

if we use a simple first-order process as an example system we get the block diagram shown

diagram from the output:

If we have a perfect model (&g  &g
 ,  and &l  &l
 )  and the disturbance and manipulation 
dynamics are identical (Pg  Pl),  then the system reduces to:
K E  
7 E 

  PlE Knl

E  
So, in a steady-state feedforward controlled system with equal manipulation and disturbance 
dynamics a perfect model will result in perfect disturbance rejection. When the disturbance 
changes it will be immediately cancelled by manipulation changes made by the controller 
and no deviation will occur in the controlled variable. The setpoint response is less exciting. 
Although setpoint changes are tracked exactly (if a perfect model is used) the speed of 
tracking is just the open loop speed of the process. Setpoint tracking will be much slower 
than can be achieved with a feedback controller.
Now, let’s consider what happens if we have equal disturbance and manipulation dynamics, 
but imperfect steady-state models:
K E 
&g  &g
 &l
&l

  PE
7 E 
&l
&l

  PE Knl

E  
The effect of the disturbance is no longer zero. It is now a first-order process with dynamics 
the same as the open-loop process and with a gain of:
&g  &g
 &l
&l
  
This means that a steady-state error will be left when the disturbance changes. Provided 
the model is at least somewhere nearly correct (
j
j
    and &g
  &g),  the controlled gain 
will be much less than the uncontrolled gain, but there will be some steady-state change in 
the output. Similarly, the gain on the setpoint TF is no longer 1 and so perfect set-point 
tracking will not be obtained – there will be an error. Errors in the gains in models for 
feedforward controllers always produce steady-state errors in the controlled variable after a 
disturbance or setpoint change.
Finally, consider the case where we have a perfect model, but different manipulation and 
disturbance dynamics (in this case the time constants are not equal).

The setpoint response is unaffected, and it’s still pretty terrible. The disturbance response has, 
however, changed. At steady-state (when the terms in ‘s’ go to zero) there will be no change 
in the output, but until steady-state is reached there will. Although the manipulation is 
immediately changed to counteract the disturbance at steady-state as soon as the disturbance 
enters the system, the two changes move through the process at different rates, and the 
output is altered for a time. Consider a unit step in the disturbance and no setpoint change:
K E 
&g
  PgE 
&g
  PlE

E 
K F  &g
  8a     8a 
 
Figure 84 shows the sort of response that will result when the disturbance process is faster 
than the manipulation. The effect of the disturbance gets through to the output first, causing 
the output to deviate away from the setpoint. As the manipulation works its way through, 
the output deviation is reduced and eventually eliminated as the system moves to steady-state.

This sort of transient error is called dynamic error.

DYNAMIC FEEDFORWARD CONTROL
If the manipulation and disturbance dynamics are very different then the amounts of dynamic 
error may be large. In these cases it may be worth considering a full dynamic controller 
(where dynamic process models are used instead of steady-state ones). For a first-order 
process, we have the following assumed model:
K E 
&l

  Pl
 E G E 
&g

  Pg

  Pl

The setpoint controller function is potentially troublesome. If a step is made in the setpoint, 
then this transfer function will generate an infinite controller output. Additionally, if there 
had been any dead-time in the TF inverting it would lead to positive exponentials in ‘s’ – 
representing prediction rather than time-delay terms and producing what is known as a 
physically unrealisable controller. For these reasons, and because steady-state controller servo 
response is poor, feedforward control is never used for setpoint tracking. We’ll proceed on 
this basis by setting the change in the controller setpoint to zero.

In the case of a perfect model (the corresponding gains and time constants are equal) perfect 
disturbance rejection is achieved.
If the dynamics are correct, but the gains are inaccurate, then there will be a residual steady-
state error on a disturbance change. Even if the model is incorrect worthwhile reductions 
in dynamic error can be achieved.
If the gains are correct, but the time constants are inaccurate then there will be a dynamic 
error in the response (it’s easiest to see this by assuming that it’s only the disturbance time 
constant that’s inaccurate). Again, if the models are nearly correct then the controlled 
behaviour will be much better than a steady-state controller.
14.8	
FEEDFORWARD/FEEDBACK CONTROL
Perfect modelling is never possible – there will always be some errors – and so perfect 
disturbance rejection isn’t achievable from a feedforward controller. Feedforward control is 
also very poor at tracking setpoint changes. For these reasons feedforward control is seldom 
used on its own and is almost always combined with a feedback controller to produce as 
feedforward/feedback controller. There are a number of proposed arrangements for this in the 
literature, but the most sensible is shown in figure 85.
In this arrangement all setpoint tracking is dealt with by the feedback controller, and the 
feedforward controller doesn’t get involved. When a disturbance enters the system it is 
detected by the feeforward controller, and this immediately outputs a manipulation signal 
that should counteract the disturbance. If this works, then there will be no change in the 
controlled variable, and the feedback controller won’t get involved. However, if there is 
model error in the feedforward controller then there will be some change in the controlled 
variable, and this will be detected and acted upon by the feedback controller.

15	 DESIGN OF CONTROL SYSTEMS
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Steady-state control envelopes
•	 Multi-variable processes
•	 How to determine the number of things that can be controlled
•	 Plant mass balance control
•	 How to select control loops
The design of a control system for a processing plant is a major task, involving many different 
areas of expertise. As chemical engineers we are most likely to get involved in specifying 
what loops are required, what other measurements are necessary and what safety systems 
may be needed. We also might get involved with control valve and instrument selection. 
Some chemical engineers, who specialise in control systems, also get involved with specifying 
the control system architecture – what hardware and communication systems will be used. 
Electronic, electrical and instrument engineers are usually involved in the design of the 
physical installation.
This section of the course is to give you an introduction to what is involved in loop selection 
in a control system design.
15.1	 CONTROL ENVELOPE
Imagine you have a job packing shelves. You are expected to be able to lift a variety of 
packages from floor level onto the shelving. There will be a maximum weight of box that 
you’ll be able to lift and this will be set by your physical makeup. If a bigger box comes 
along, you won’t be able to handle it. Just like the big boxes, there are physical limits on 
the size of disturbances that a control system can handle. These limits are set by the degree 
of variability built into the control valves, i.e. by how much control effort is available. The 
limits to control action are determined by steady-state considerations, but have important 
implications on dynamic behaviour near the edges of the envelope.

Design of control systems
Consider a mixing vessel which is used to further dilute a low-concentration salt stream 
prior to waste treatment. The salt stream flows into the vessel and is mixed with a flow 
of water that is manipulated by a controller that is controlling the exit salt concentration 
from the vessel. The level in the vessel is perfectly controlled and there are no significant 
density differences between the streams. The potential disturbances to the system are the 
flowrate and inlet concentration of the salt stream. The steady-state component balance for 
the system is given by:

  "y}  "v
  "  "v ~ 
To work out the control limits we need to place limits on the manipulated variable and 
set the outlet concentration to the setpoint value – this will give us two equations: one for 
the upper limit on the manipulated variable and another for the lower:

  "y}  "  "v ~ 

  "y}  "  "v ~ 
and these can be arranged to produce the equations for the two edges of the control envelope:
y} 
"  "v ~
"
 
y} 
"  "v ~
"
 
Let’s put some numbers in and calculate the control limits. Assume that the normal inlet 
salt concentration is 0.01 kg.m-3 , and that the desired exit concentration is 0.001 kg.m-3. 
If the nominal flow of salt solution is 1m3.min-1, this gives us a nominal diluent flow 
requirement of 9 m3.min-1. Assume that we choose a valve that allows us to vary the diluent 
flow between 2 and 12.6 m3.min-1. Putting these numbers into the equations above generates 
the curves shown in figure 86.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL 
FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS

Design of control systems
For all the combinations of inlet flowrate and salt concentration inside the green area, 
steady-state operation (and hence control) is possible. It isn’t possible to control the process 
if the disturbance combinations fall in the red areas (outside of the control envelope ).
At the edges of the envelope, the manipulation will be hard against one of the controller 
output limits. Dynamic operation near the edges will almost certainly result in the controller 
output saturating, producing poorer control performance than will be achieved further 
inside the envelope.
Earlier I described a rule of thumb for control valve sizing (the valve should be sized for 
1.4 times the nominal flow). This is fine for a general rule, but control system designers 
should always consider the effect this may have on the control envelope – processes with 
very low process gains may need a much bigger range of manipulation variability to be 
successfully controlled.
15.2	 MULTIVARIABLE PROCESSES
In the course so far we’ve considered control systems with a single manipulated and a single 
controlled output. Real processes are much more complicated with multiple controlled 
outputs, manipulations and disturbances. Figure 87 shows an s-domain block diagram for 
a 3 input/2 output Multiple-input/Multiple output (MIMO) system.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL

Design of control systems
The s-domain representation of a MIMO system is a simplification of most real MIMO 
processes as the s-domain necessarily represents a linear (or linearised) model. However, it is 
useful for discussing the major features of such systems. The main thing to notice is that each 
input is capable of affecting either, or both, outputs. This means that a disturbance entering 
the process can change both of the system outputs. It would be possible to setup control loops 
to control the outputs connecting GZ
  to KZ
  and G[
  to K[
 ,  but it is also possible to setup 
an alternative control combination where GZ
  is used to manipulate K[
 and G[
  manipulates 
KZ
.  Either of these control schemes may be used to control the process, although it is 
likely that one of the loop combinations will be better than the other. If there are equal 
numbers of manipulated and controlled variables( say ‘n’), then the number of possible loop 
combinations is @  i.e. if there are 4 controlled variables there are     different 
ways of combining the manipulations and controlled variables in loops.
Choosing the best way to combine controlled outputs and manipulations in a multi-loop control 
system is not a trivial task, and there is no general method to achieve the best performance. 
Some rules of thumb can be used to at least eliminate the worst loop combinations:
•	 Choose loops where there is a strong causal relationship between the manipulation 
and disturbance
•	 Choose loops that minimise the dead-time between the manipulation and disturbance
•	 Choose loop combinations that minimise the interaction between the loops
•	 Choose loops with a reasonable process gain (this limits the manipulation 
range required)
•	 Where possible, choose loops with an approximately linear relationship between 
the manipulation and disturbance (often this isn’t possible).
Another alternative to controlling these MIMO or multivariable systems is to use a full 
multivariable controller. This is a controller that considers the system as a whole and doesn’t 
decompose the control into single loops. This type of controller has been present in the oil 
industry for many years (e.g. Dynamic Matrix Control) and is getting increasingly popular 
in other applications. Multivariable control is beyond the scope of this introductory text.
15.3	 HOW TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF CONTROLLED VARIABLES
In our discussion of control we have automatically assumed that we know what the controlled 
variables of a system are. In real situations, this isn’t predetermined and the first job of 
the control system designer is to decide what should be controlled on a process. Also, the 
designer isn’t free to choose as many controlled variables as he/she thinks are necessary – 
they will be limited by the available degrees of freedom in the system.

You will have encountered degrees of freedom in thermodynamics and statistics, and they 
have a similar effect on control systems. The formal definition of the degrees of freedom 
for a system is:
 *"  )G?58DA9<@78B8@78@FH4D<45>8E  )G?58DA98CG4F<A@ED8>4F<@:F;8? 
The degrees of freedom are the number of ways that the system can move without violating 
a constraint. In control, the degrees of freedom are further limited by disturbance variables, 
which are set externally and not available for control. The degrees of freedom for control are:
 *"f   *"  )G?58DA97<EFGD54@68E<@6>G7874E<@78B8@78@FH4D<45>8E 
The object of control is add control loops (in a multi-loop design) to reduce the number of 
control degrees of freedom to zero. Each control loop will reduce the degrees of freedom by 
one (by fixing one direction of movement) so the number of loops will be equal to  *"f.  
If there are fewer loops than this, then the system will not be fixed (i.e. controlled) and 
will not produce consistent results. If there are more loops than degrees of freedom, then 
the system is overdetermined, and some of the control loops (and it’s difficult to predict 
which) just won’t work.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL

Design of control systems
It’s actually really difficult to sit down and work out the number of degrees of freedom 
involved in most realistic process systems, and practical control engineers never bother to 
do this. Instead, they judge the number of control loops required from experience. Usually 
this isn’t too hard to do, but care does need to be taken. Generally it’s much more likely 
for less experienced engineers to have too many controllers than too few.
A rough rule of thumb is the maximum number of things that can be controlled in a 
system is equal to the number of manipulable streams entering or leaving the capacity. 
These streams can be mass or energy streams. However, it is necessary to have a mass or 
energy balance on the system so it isn’t possible to control ALL the mass or energy streams 
to particular values.
15.3.1	CONTROL OF A BLENDER
Figure 88 – a simple blender
If we consider the simple mixing process (figure 88) in isolation (i.e. all three streams can 
be manipulated) then we have three potential manipulations, three loops and three possible 
control variables. The choice of what could be controlled is varied, but some combinations 
are not possible (see the table 14).

there are three potential manipulations, three control loops and three controlled variables.

Design of control systems
15.3.3	CONTROL OF MULTIPLE UNITS
Figure 90 – blender/reactor combination
When units are joined together, degrees of freedom are lost due to shared streams. In the 
example shown (figure 90) the blender output now becomes the reactor inlet stream. This 
removes a degree of freedom (controlled variable) from either the reactor or the blender.
15.3.4	SELECTION OF CONTROLLED VARIABLES
Degrees of freedom, or other methods, tell us how many things may need to be controlled 
to fix a system, but they don’t tell us what the best controlled variables may be. Some rules 
of thumb for selecting appropriate controlled variables are:
•	 Inventories (levels in liquid systems and sometimes pressures in gas systems) always 
need to be controlled and should be the first controlled variables that are selected.
•	 Other controlled variables should be aligned to the strategic goals of the unit. If 
a distillation column is intended to purify a volatile compound, then the tops 
composition needs to be controlled (either as a composition, or as some inferred 
composition measurement, such as temperature).
•	 Controlled variables should be readily measured. Compositions are very important 
in many chemical process units (e.g. distillation columns, absorbers, reactors) but 
composition is often rather difficult to measure. In many of these systems other 
variables which are related to composition (e.g. top plate temperatures in a distillation 
column) are used as control variables instead.
•	 Controlled variables need to be strongly influenced by at least one of the available 
manipulations. If there is no strong causal relationship between manipulations and 
controlled variables, then good control will not be possible.

15.4	 PLANTWIDE MASS BALANCE CONTROL
In a complex processing plant there needs to be some point at which the overall production 
rate for the process is set. When this production rate is changed then all the individual 
units within the production process need to change their output to suit the new production 
rate. At first glance, this seems to be a hugely complex problem that will require complex 
control calculations. In fact it is easy to achieve using the interactions between individual 
unit inventory controllers.
The first thing that needs to be decided is what end of the process will set the production 
rate. It might be assumed that the best place to do this is at the output end (downstream 
mass balance control  ) and for some processes this is the appropriate thing to do. However, 
for others, such as processes involving distillation columns in the main process route, it 
is often better to adjust the production rate from the raw materials end (upstream mass 
balance control   ).
Figure 91 is an example of downstream mass balance control. In this process the production 
rate is set at the output by flow controller FC001. For the process to maintain a mass 
balance, all of the units on the main process route need to maintain their inventories by 
manipulating their input streams as shown. If FC001 increases the production rate, this will 
start to reduce the level in the third unit. LC003 will try to counteract this by increasing 
the flowrate into the unit, which in turn will reduce the level in the second unit. In this 
way, the change in the production rate at the output is transmitted backwards through the 
controlled units to produce an increase in raw materials into the process.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL

Design of control systems
Upstream mass balance control is shown in figure 92. In this case the production rate is 
set at the raw materials end by flow controller FC001. If this flowrate is increased, then 
the level in the first unit will start to rise causing level controller LC002 to open the valve 
and allow more flow into the second unit. Through the interaction between the inventory 
controllers the increase in the flow of raw materials will make its way through to the output 
of the process. Where processes have side-streams (e.g. a process has a distillation column 
with the bottoms on the main process route and the tops as a side-stream) then the side 
stream inventory controllers always need to be configured to manipulate the outlet stream, 
regardless of the type of mass balance control. This is because the production rate is set on 
the main process route and the side-stream has to take whatever has been set for the main 
process. An example of side stream mass balance control is shown in figure 93.

ARCHITECTURE
MAIN LEARNING POINTS
•	 Effect of technology on process plant control rooms
•	 Human factors in control systems
Control systems are implemented by a combination of hardware and software and have been 
affected more by the changes in technology in the last thirty years than probably any other 
system in process plants. The introduction of new technology has completely changed the 
way in which plants are operated, the number of people involved, and the jobs that they do.
16.1	 THE EFFECT OF TECHNOLOGY ON PROCESS PLANT 
CONTROL ROOMS
Before the widespread use of electrical communications signals almost all measurement and 
control signals were transmitted by pneumatic signals (3–15psi) passing through narrow 
diameter brass tubes. These tubes limited the distance a signal could be transmitted, not 
just due to the cost involved in the tubing, but also because the dynamics of transmission. 
When an instrument at one end of a tube changed its output air pressure, a significant 
dynamic lag existed due the air volume in the tube – the signal at the other end took time 
to reach the transmitted pressure. This lag grew as the length of the tube increased, and 
this meant that tube runs had to be kept relatively short.

The limitation had a significant effect on the way plants were operated. Since tube runs had 
to be kept fairly short it was usual to have several local control rooms in a plant rather than 
a single central control room (the first plant I worked in was a compound fertiliser plant 
and had three control rooms: one for phosphoric acid preparation; one for the granulation 
drums; and the third for the dust extraction equipment). Since each control room required 
a minimum of two operators to be present (for safety) there were many more operators 
on plant than would typically be seen nowadays. In addition, to save tube runs, it was 
common for some instrument displays to be kept ‘in the field’, i.e. the display was near 
the instrument. This meant that operators were often walking around the plant rather than 
spending all of their time in the control rooms.

ESSENTIAL PROCESS CONTROL 
FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS
196
Control system architecture
Figure 95 – a modern control room
The control rooms themselves looked very different from modern rooms. Figure 94 shows 
a petrochemical plant control room in 1971. At this time the only visual display units were 
cathode ray tubes and the computers that were available were too large, fragile and low-
powered to be used to drive chemical plant display systems. Instead the control panel is 
made up of various gauges and other instruments which had a direct pneumatic connection 
with the instrument concerned. The large circular devices you can see on the control panel 
are chart recorders. These recorded the trends of certain key variables in ink on a circular 
paper chart. These charts were replaced at frequent intervals and, along with paper records 
produced by the operators, they represented the only historical data that was available on 
plant operation.
Contrast figure 94 with the control room shown in figure 95. Figure 95 is the control room 
for the same plant (South Hampton Resources, Texas) but in 2014. Modern instrumentation 
now is almost exclusively based around analogue electrical or digital communications. 
The length of cable runs is relatively unimportant – they no longer affect the signal being 
transmitted. As a result, most plants now have centralised control rooms rather than 
distributed rooms. The control rooms may be sited some distance from the plant (for safety 
reasons) and very few instruments are now field located. This means that fewer operators 
are required and that, in some factories, they rarely go out on plant. Modern control room 
displays are computer driven and present a large amount of information to operators on 
paged screens. Historical data is now directly recorded onto disc and is easily retrievable by 
process engineers looking for information about the process behaviour.

The working environment for operators has also considerably improved. Since they were 
based on plant the old control rooms could be noisy, hot and uncomfortable. Modern 
control rooms are air conditioned and much more like a standard office environment.
16.2	 HUMAN FACTORS IN CONTROL ROOM DISPLAYS
The old control rooms HMI (human-machine interface) were pretty primitive and operators 
need significant amounts of training just to remember what particular instruments were 
telling them. Some companies made attempts to improve things by physically embedding 
the instruments (i.e. cutting a slot for them in the plywood) in plant ‘mimic’ diagrams 
that were painted on a wall in the control room. Due to the number of instruments that 
a typical chemical plant requires for control, this strategy never worked too well.
Modern SCADA (scanning, control and data acquisition) systems now include editors that 
allow engineers to create plant displays and embed the output of instruments or operator 
adjustable controls. The displays can be set up in a hierarchy that allow operators to bore 
down through general plant information into very specific displays that represent particular 
process units.

Although being able to edit plant displays (and adding pictures, colours and animation) 
is a very powerful feature of these systems, it has been overused in the past. There are 
many examples of plant control systems with displays in garish colours or with very high 
information densities (figure 96). Poorly designed displays increase operator stress during 
plant incidents and make it hard for them to reach the information they need to make the 
correct decisions. A group of companies and academics recognised the need for good human 
factors in control room HMIs (human-machine interface) and formed the Abnormal Situation 
Management (ASM) consortium. The consortium have produced a number of publications 
on subjects ranging from best practises for information presentation to alarm management.

Control system architecture
Figure 97 – an ASM compliant display
A big message from the ASM publications on operator displays is that the use of colour 
should be minimised and only used to highlight abnormal conditions. Plant mimics are 
greyscale so that they enhance rather than detract from the information that is being 
presented. ‘Three dimensional’ images of plant equipment are also avoided as these distract 
from the information. Instead shapes filled with a neutral grey are used to represent the 
process items.

Control system architecture
Alarm handling is another important area in HMI design. Alarms are generated by the 
normal process control system (as opposed to SIS (safety instrumented system) events) 
when a process value, or rate of change, exceeds pre-set high or low limits. The object of 
alarms is to warn the operators of unusual events. In the pre-computer age (and still in 
some modern) control rooms alarms were shown on annunciator panels. These were panels 
of colour coded (usually amber/yellow for warnings and red for serious problems) lights 
with text on the front describing the alarm involved (e.g. ‘Reactor Temperature High’). The 
lights were normally off, but would flash when an alarm condition was breached, often 
accompanied by a siren sounding. The control room operators would ‘accept’ the alarm by 
pressing the face of the annunciator and operating a switch – this stopped the flashing and 
siren, but left the alarm illuminated for as long as the condition persisted. 
Annunciator panels limited the number of alarms that could be presented to operators, as 
there was a limited amount of wall space in the control room. When computer based systems 
were first introduced, however, this limitation disappeared. Alarms were now presented to 
operators in an alarm list that had an almost unlimited length. In the early days of computer 
control systems, engineers tended to add alarms to almost every variable just to be ‘on the 
safe side’. When an incident occurred this meant that operators were bombarded with dozens 
of alarms related to a single fault. The stress and pressure of dealing with multiple alarms 
meant that operators found it very difficult to diagnose and deal with the real problem 
behind the alarm conditions. Alarm management, which involves many things including 
careful selection of alarms and operator training, is now taken very seriously in the process 
industries. The aim is to provide operators with sufficient warning of abnormal events 
without overloading the operators’ ability to cope.
16.3	 DISTRIBUTED CONTROL SYSTEMS
Distributed control systems (DCS) are now widely used in the process industry. This has 
really been driven by the use of microprocessor technology, which provides control system 
devices (instruments, controllers and valves) with a degree of ‘intelligence’ that wasn’t available 
in the past. A DCS distributes the information gathering and decision making tasks in a 
control system amongst multiple devices. These devices are additionally normally arranged 
in a hierarchy where devices at different levels have different sorts of decision making tasks.

16.4	 SAFETY INSTRUMENTED SYSTEMS
A safety instrumented system (SIS) is a control system that is completely separate from the 
normal process control system. A SIS has its own instruments, control hardware and software 
and final control elements. The purpose of the SIS is to take over from the normal process 
control system in extreme situations where normal process control is failing to keep the 
plant in a safe condition (e.g. in a fire). The valves on a SIS are normally open/close – the 
object is no longer to regulate the process, but is instead to put the plant into a safe place 
(by, for example, shutting off flows to reactors and opening cooling water lines).

APPENDIX 
THE USE OF SOFTWARE FOR TEACHING PROCESS CONTROL AT 
STRATHCLYDE UNIVERSITY
Chemical engineering students typically find process control a very difficult subject to 
grasp. One of the main reasons for this is that control is fundamentally dynamic, whereas 
almost everything else in the chemical engineering curriculum is taught as steady-state. 
Another reason is that control is a systems based discipline, where looking at one element 
in isolation is rarely useful. The behaviour of a control system is the result of multiple 
subsystems responding to each other, and this is very difficult for students new to the 
discipline to visualise.
To deal with these problems I’ve always used computer simulation to support my control 
classes. When I started teaching (in 1986) Strathclyde had just joined a teaching experiment 
run by IBM using their mainframe based Advanced Control System (ACS). The mainframe 
was based at Imperial College in London and about half a dozen other UK universities were 
connected to this by landline. Although there were problems in running in this way, working 
with ACS really opened my eyes to what could be possible. Due to the limited number 
of terminals that we had we ran the ACS work as a laboratory with groups of students 
were rotated through the computer room during a working week. During each lab session 
the students worked through a series of set tasks that were based on a course developed at 
Purdue University (one of the first Universities involved in the IBM experiment). ACS was 
popular with the students and we also ran several introductory control classes for industry 
using the system.
The experiment was abandoned after a couple of years. I think IBM realised that mainframe 
computers weren’t where the future of process computing was going. We’d also had significant 
problems with the reliability of the landline down to London and couldn’t justify the costs 
associated with maintaining this. I searched for alternative pieces of software that could 
support dynamic simulation in chemical engineering control classes and came across a 
program called UCONLINE that was being developed by a team led by Prof. Alan Foss 
at UC Berkeley.

Appendix 
UCONLINE was quite different from ACS in that it ran on microcomputers (which is what 
we called PCs at that time!) using MSDOS. In the late eighties and early nineties micro-
computer prices had fallen to the level where they were affordable to purchase in numbers 
suitable for teaching, and Strathclyde began creating PC laboratories across the campus. 
This meant that we were able to include computer simulation as a class activity where the 
whole class met in a computer room once a week to do dynamic simulation work.
Although MSDOS-based, UCONLINE was a powerful tool for teaching. Students could 
change valve positions and watch the effects on the process. They could add their own 
control arrangements, ranging from basic PID up to more complicated systems with dead-
time compensators, decouplers and feedforward controllers. They could then simulate the 
complete control system and tune and adjust their controllers as required.
When Alan Foss retired, support for UCONLINE disappeared and we were forced to look 
for a new way of using simulation in our classes. For a number of years we used the block-
structured dynamics simulation languages, VisSim and Simulink. These are powerful pieces 
of software, but are really designed for real simulation modelling and not for teaching. The 
diagrams the students were producing also looked nothing like the P&IDs that chemical 
engineers use every day. This really hit home when a former student wrote a letter complaining 
that he hadn’t been taught about P&IDs. He had, of course, but I realised that he had spent 
most of his time looking at block diagrams and hadn’t realised the importance of P&IDs.
We did try to use Aspen Dynamic for teaching (Aspen Dynamic is the dynamic modelling 
add-on for Aspen Plus, the steady-state flowsheet modeller). This had the advantages of 
being a package that was used in industry and that it produced control diagrams that were 
very similar to standard P&IDs. However the software is complicated to use and we found 
that our control class wasn’t teaching control, but was instead training students to use the 
software (badly!).

Appendix 
When I started to design the new introductory control class (which is the material covered 
in this book) I realised that I needed better software to support the simulation elements. I 
could find nothing available that met my needs and so, with a group of colleagues decided 
to build my own. The main requirements of the software were:
•	 It had to represent the process and control system on a standard P&ID (Figure 99)
•	 Learners should be free to add instruments and controllers in any way they wished
•	 It had to mimic the elements on the P&ID with virtual devices (created as users 
added P&ID elements) that could be attached to a virtual control panel or SCADA 
screen (Figure 100).
•	 It had to include a lesson system that presented material to learners and also 
measured their performance (by, for example, comparing their control layout with 
an instructors).
•	 It had to be capable of simulating the system (process plus attached controllers and 
instruments in real and accelerated time).
The software, called PISim has been in development over a three year period and has been 
used in the last two cycles of the control class. Even though the software used by the 
students was at a relatively early stage of development it has proven to be easy to use and 
popular. Some of the student comments from the 2016/17 session were: ‘I think the PISim 
element of the course was extremely useful’; ‘very useful in showing how control systems 
work’; ‘Practical simulations with PISim were fun’; ‘PISim was a very effective teaching tool’.
