Preface
reface
 
 elcome to Criminal Investigation, Ninth  Edition. 
Designed to be one of the most practical, 
hands-on, reliable textbooks you will ever purchase, Crimi-
nal Investigation presents the procedures, techniques, and 
applications of private and public investigation. Th e book 
seamlessly integrates coverage of modern investigative 
tools alongside discussion of established investigation 
procedures and techniques. Th e Ninth Edition features 
updated, enhanced coverage of such important topics as 
terrorism and homeland security, cybercrime, forensics and 
physical evidence, federal law enforcement investigations, 
report writing, crimes against children, investigative pho-
tography and sketching, preparing and presenting cases in 
court, identity theft, white-collar crime, and much more.
 
Forensics and crime-scene investigation are increas-
ingly popular components of criminal investigation courses 
today and are correspondingly emphasized in this text, 
which features complete coverage of digital ﬁ ngerprint-
ing, DNA evidence and databases, ballistics, body-ﬂ uid 
collection and examination, contamination of evidence, 
new technologies, exhibiting evidence in court, and new 
technologies that are changing the way crime scenes are 
documented through photography, sketching, and so on.
 
Opportunities in investigations have altered since 
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. New careers 
have opened up in federal law enforcement, and interest 
in working with federal agencies has grown amongst job 
seekers. Th is new edition increases its focus on federal 
investigations. It also delves more deeply into the ﬁ ght 
against terrorism and the ways in which law enforcement, 
whether federal, state, or local, must be involved and must 
work collaboratively with other agencies to be eﬀ ective.
 
Criminal Investigation can serve as an overview of the 
entire ﬁ eld or as a solid foundation for specialized course-
work. Although the content of each chapter could easily be 
expanded into an entire book or course, this text provides 
the basic concepts of each area of investigation and will 
prove to be an invaluable reference long after students 
move on from the classroom.
ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXT
In Section 1, the student is introduced to the broad ﬁ eld 
of criminal investigation; to the elements of an eﬀ ective, 
eﬃ  cient investigation; and to the equipment, technol-
ogy, and procedures that facilitate investigation (Chap-
ter 1). Important court cases and decisions are cited and 
explained throughout the text.
 
Section 2 is designed to acquaint readers with various 
investigative responsibilities: documenting the scene by 
note taking, photographing, and sketching (Chapter 2); 
writing reports (Chapter 3); searching crime scenes and 
suspects (Chapter 4); identifying and collecting physical 
evidence for forensic examination (Chapter 5); obtaining 
information (Chapter 6); and identifying and arresting 
suspects (Chapter 7).
 
Sections 3, 4, and 5 illustrate how these responsi-
bilities are carried out in speciﬁ c types of investigations. 
Section 3 discusses the basics in investigating violent 
crimes: death investigations (Chapter 8); assault, domes-
tic violence, stalking and elder abuse (Chapter 9); sex 
oﬀ enses (Chapter 10); crimes against children (Chap-
ter 11); and robbery (Chapter 12). Section 4 discusses 
crimes against property: burglary (Chapter 13); larceny/
theft, fraud and white-collar crime (Chapter 14); motor 
vehicle theft (Chapter 15); and arson, bombs and explo-
sives (Chapter 16). Section 5 discusses other investiga-
tive challenges: computer crimes and their evolution 
into cybercrimes (Chapter 17); the dual threats of drug-
related crime and organized crime (Chapter 18); the ille-
gal activities of gangs and other dangerous groups, such 
as hate groups and cults (Chapter 19); terrorism and 
homeland security (Chapter 20); and the culmination of 
investigations: preparing for and presenting cases in 
court (Chapter 21).

HOW TO USE THIS TEXT
Criminal Investigation is a carefully structured learning 
experience. Th e more actively you participate in it, the more 
you will learn. You will learn and remember more if you 
ﬁ rst familiarize yourself with the total scope of the subject. 
Read and think about the table of contents, which provides 
an outline of the many facets of criminal investigation.
 
Th en follow these steps for quadruple-strength learn-
ing as you study each chapter.
 1. Read the objectives at the beginning of the chapter. 
Th ese are stated as Do You Know? questions and are 
designed to help you assess your current knowledge 
of the subject of each question. Consider any precon-
ceptions you may hold. Also, look at the key terms in 
the Can You Deﬁ ne? section, and watch for them when 
they are used.
 2. Read the chapter while underlining, highlighting 
or taking notes—whatever is your preferred study 
method. Pay special attention to all highlighted infor-
mation or words that appear in boldface type. Th e 
former represent the answers to the chapter-opening 
Do You Know? questions, and the latter comprise the 
key terms identiﬁ ed in the chapter-opening Can You 
Deﬁ ne? section.
 3. When you have ﬁ nished reading the chapter, read 
the summary—your third exposure to the chapter’s 
key information. Th en return to the beginning of the 
chapter and quiz yourself. Can you answer the Do You 
Know? questions? Can You Deﬁ ne? the key terms?
 4. Finally, in Sections 3, 4, and 5, complete the Applica-
tion exercises at the end of each chapter. Th ese exer-
cises ask you to apply the chapter concepts in actual 
or hypothetical cases. Th en read the Discussion Ques-
tions and be prepared to contribute to a class discus-
sion of the ideas presented in the chapter.
 
By following these steps, you will learn more informa-
tion, understand it more fully, and remember it longer.

1. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION: AN OVERVIEW
1
INTRODUCTION
elcome to criminal investigation. What are 
you in for? Here’s a glimpse . . . 
 
New to law enforcement, Ofﬁ cer Richard Gautsch 
found himself standing over the bullet-ridden corpse of 
a 15-year-old gas station attendant. The boy had been 
robbed, kidnapped and brutally executed, all for the 
48 bucks in his pocket, and Gautsch’s view of the world 
was forever changed. The 24-year-old detective (the 
youngest in Minnesota) had had little time to transi-
tion from life as a college jock to the violent world of 
murder investigations. And although naïve and inexpe-
rienced, he played a lead role in the pursuit, arrest and 
conviction of the two murder suspects.
 
During the next 5 years with a suburban metro 
police department, Gautsch worked a variety of major 
cases throughout the metropolitan area, including 
numerous undercover assignments. His youthful appear-
ance quickly landed him in the middle of a major angel 
dust investigation, and it didn’t take long for him to real-
ize that the glitz and glamour of Miami Vice was pure 
ﬁ ction. Detective Gautsch unexpectedly found himself 
in a car with two dealers, his informant and a lit pipe 
full of the pungent chemical. As the pipe was being 
passed around, the dealers demanded to know why 
w
Gautsch wasn’t inhaling. The informant (who was inhal-
ing deeply) asked the same question. With no weapon 
or backup, Gautsch suddenly felt a sensation he’d never 
seen portrayed by the heroes of those one-hour cop 
shows—fear and the urge to ﬂ ee. After a sprint to safety, 
Gautsch wondered if he’d chosen the right career.
 
As the young detective gained experience, he 
learned that successful investigations rely on commu-
nication skills and attention to tedious tasks. Search-
ing ﬁ lthy attics and sifting through the rotting contents 
of a dumpster are more common than are excitement 
and intrigue. Investigators’ abilities to interview and 
to write reports are far more important than how accu-
rately they shoot or how fast they can drive.
 
Gautsch was promoted to detective supervisor and 
placed in charge of the Investigation Unit. That same 
year, he investigated the murder of a young police ofﬁ -
cer answering a burglary call. The case was his most 
difﬁ cult—the ofﬁ cer was one of his best friends.
 
Five years later, Gautsch pinned on his cap-
tain’s bars, his command expanding to include the 

Investigative Unit and a special multijurisdictional 
undercover task force. In 1988, he led a highly publi-
cized murder investigation that stunned the entire com-
munity. After an argument with her boyfriend, a young 
mother was brutally stabbed to death in her apartment. 
The evidence against the boyfriend was so overwhelm-
ing that no one doubted his guilt, yet he remained 
uncharged. The community was outraged. Gautsch and 
his detectives doggedly pursued the suspect for 3 years, 
only to learn they had the wrong guy.
 
This thumbnail sketch of one detective’s career 
offers a glimpse into the world of the criminal inves-
tigator. Criminal investigation is a complex, sophis-
ticated ﬁ eld, each aspect of which could constitute 
a book. This text includes the most basic aspects of 
criminal investigation. Section 1 presents an overview 
of criminal investigation and general guidelines to 
follow or adapt in speciﬁ c circumstances, as well 
as basic considerations in the preliminary inves-
tigation, the most critical phase in the majority of 
investigations.
 
Investigators must be thoroughly familiar with 
crimes and their elements, modus operandi (MO) 
information, the major goals of investigation, the basic 
functions of investigating ofﬁ cers and the investigators’ 
relationships with other individuals and agencies.
 
Investigators do not operate in a vacuum but must 
relate to constitutional safeguards. They must also 
understand case law determining the parameters within 
which they perform the investigative process. How these 
constitutional safeguards and case law speciﬁ cally 
affect investigations is emphasized throughout the text.

Outline
n April 19, 1995, Trooper Charlie Hanger of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol 
was traveling north on Interstate 35 when he saw a 1977 Mercury Marquis 
with no license plate. Hanger pulled the car over, and the only occupant, a white 
male, got out. While Hanger was questioning the driver about the license plate, 
the trooper noticed a bulge in the man’s clothing. When asked, the man admitted 
he had a gun and was arrested. Th e driver—Timothy McVeigh—was later found 
responsible for the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 
people and left hundreds injured. Some would say that the arrest was just plain luck. 
However, experience and alertness often play important roles.

to criminal investigations, or it may be the result of 
taking advantage of new developments in the forensic 
and management sciences. (“Recognizing Innovation,” 
2003, p.140)
 
Because no two crimes are identical, even if com-
mitted by the same person, each investigation is unique. 
Th e great range of variables in individual crimes makes 
it impossible to establish ﬁ xed rules for conducting an 
investigation. Nevertheless, some general guidelines 
help to ensure a thorough, eﬀ ective investigation. Inves-
tigators modify and adapt these guidelines to ﬁ t each 
case.
 
Investigators need not have superhuman reasoning 
ability. Th ey must, however, proceed in an orderly, sys-
tematic way, gathering facts to analyze and evaluate. Th is 
chapter introduces decisions to be made and the actions 
to be taken. Subsequent chapters explain each step of the 
preliminary investigation more fully.
 
An observant police oﬃ  cer can initiate an important 
criminal investigation, sometimes without realizing it at 
ﬁ rst. Criminal investigation combines art and science and 
requires extraordinary preparation and training. And in 
today’s high-tech society, where information ﬂ ows faster 
than ever and citizens expect results more quickly, inves-
tigators need to step up their technology and teamwork 
skills—they need an edge. Th e International Association 
of Chiefs of Police (IACP) declares, 
It’s a new world and the role of the detective has 
changed dramatically. In the old world, shoe leather 
was the detective’s primary tool. Luck and persistence 
were cornerstones of success. Th e key to managing a 
detective bureau was motivating the investigators.
 
Now, in the information age, where technology 
advances daily, shoe leather is still important—as are 
luck and persistence—but aggressive detectives and 
their supervisors are constantly looking for a new 
edge. Th at edge might be a new method or approach 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
DEFINITIONS
An investigation is a patient, step-by-step inquiry 
 or observation, a careful examination, a record-
ing of evidence or a legal inquiry. Th e word investigate is 
derived from the Latin word vestigare, meaning to track or 
trace, a derivation easily related to police investigation. 
A criminal investigation is the process of discovering, 
collecting, preparing, identifying and presenting  evidence 
to determine what happened and who is responsible.
 
Criminal investigation is a reconstructive process that 
uses deductive reasoning, a logical process in which a con-
clusion follows from speciﬁ c facts. Based on speciﬁ c pieces 
of evidence, investigators establish proof that a suspect 
is guilty of an oﬀ ense. For example, ﬁ nding the suspect’s 
watch at the scene of a burglary is one piece of evidence that 
supports the premise that the suspect was at the scene. An 
issue that might arise is whether the watch could have been 
planted there. Investigators need to anticipate what issues 
might arise and what evidence is needed to support the 
prosecutor’s case. All issues in dispute must be supported 
by evidence. Th e more evidence an investigation yields, the 
stronger the proof of guilt. Equally important, however, is 
evidence establishing innocence. 
OTHER TERMS DEFINED
Criminalistics refers to specialists trained in recording, 
identifying and interpreting the minutiae (minute details) 
of physical evidence. A criminalist (aka crime scene tech-
nician, examiner or investigator) searches for, collects and 
preserves physical evidence in investigations of crime and 
suspected criminals. Criminalistics is a branch of forensic 
science, which is a broader ﬁ eld encompassing the appli-
cation of science to the law: “Forensic science involves 
applying scientiﬁ c processes to solve legal problems, most 
notably within the context of the criminal justice system” 
(Fantino, 2007, p.26). Th us, forensic science covers a wide 
array of disciplines, including pathology, entomology, 
odontology, anthropology, photography, serology, toxi-
cology and the list goes on and on.
 
Th e ﬁ rst determination in a criminal investigation is 
whether a crime has, in fact, been committed. Does the 
evidence support a speciﬁ c oﬀ ense? A legal arrest cannot 
be made for an act that is not deﬁ ned by statute or ordi-
nance as a crime. Although everyone has a notion of what 
crime is, investigators must have a very precise under-
standing of what it means. Speciﬁ c deﬁ nitions of such 

CHAPTER 1 | Criminal Investigation:  An Overview | 7
terms as crime, felony, misdemeanor, criminal statute and 
ordinance are found in case law:
• • A crime is an act in violation of penal law and an 
oﬀ ense against the state. Th e broader use of the term 
includes both felonies and misdemeanors. A crime 
is a violation of a public right or law. It is an act or 
omission forbidden by law and punishable by a ﬁ ne, 
imprisonment or even death. Th is contrasts with 
torts, or private harms.
• • A felony is a serious crime, graver than a misde-
meanor; it is generally punishable by death or impris-
onment of more than 1 year in a penitentiary.
• • A misdemeanor is a crime or oﬀ ense that is less 
 serious than a felony and is punishable by a ﬁ ne or 
imprisonment of as long as 1 year in an institution 
other than a penitentiary.
• • A criminal statute is a legislative act relating to a 
crime and its punishment.
• • An ordinance is an act of the legislative body of 
a municipality or county relating to all the rules 
governing the municipality or county, including 
misdemeanors.
 
Crimes and their penalties are established and 
deﬁ ned by state and federal statutes and local ordi-
nances.1 An act that is not declared a crime by statute 
or ordinance is not a chargeable oﬀ ense, no matter how 
wrong it may seem. Designated crimes and their punish-
ments change as society’s attitudes change. In the past, 
for example, behavior associated with alcoholism was 
considered criminal, but today many states regard alco-
holism as an illness. However, driving while intoxicated 
is now considered a much more serious oﬀ ense than it 
was previously. Conversely, our society has designated 
as crimes certain acts, such as computer fraud, that were 
unknown in earlier times.
 
Crimes fall into two general categories—felonies and 
misdemeanors—depending on the severity of an act and 
its recommended punishment. Th e more serious society 
considers a crime, the more severe the penalty. Investi-
gations involve both types of crimes. Misdemeanors are 
sometimes further subdivided into gross and petty mis-
demeanors, based on the value of the property involved.
 
Because deﬁ nitions of crimes and their penalties 
vary considerably depending on whether they occur at 
the municipal, county, state or federal level, investigators 
must be familiar with their area’s criminal statutes and 
ordinances. For example, in some states, such as Michigan, 
shoplifting is a felony. Otherwise, in most states, the value 
of the shoplifted property determines whether the crime is 
a misdemeanor or a felony.
 
Statutes and ordinances list speciﬁ c conditions, called 
the elements of the crime, that must occur for an act to 
be called a speciﬁ c kind of crime. For example, a state stat-
ute might deﬁ ne burglary as occurring when (1) an accused 
enters a building (2) without the consent of the rightful 
owner (3) with the intent to commit a crime. An investiga-
tion must prove each element, even if the suspect has con-
fessed. Many crimes have as an element criminal intent, 
that is, purposely performing an unlawful act or knowing an 
act to be illegal. Sections 3 and 4 of this text discuss the ele-
ments of major crimes. Knowing these elements is essential 
to gathering evidence to prove a crime has been committed.
 
In addition to proving a crime has been committed, 
investigators must determine who committed it. Inves-
tigation is often aided by knowing how criminals usu-
ally operate, that is, their modus operandi, or MO. For 
example, it was relatively easy to recognize the “work” of 
Jack the Ripper or the DC-area snipers. Th e peculiarities 
of each crime scene may be entered into an MO ﬁ le and 
matched with characteristics of known perpetrators of 
previous crimes. However, investigators must always be 
vigilant of the potential for “copycat” oﬀ enders.
 
MO information can provide clues in numerous cases. 
For example, if several burglaries are committed between 
11 a.m. and 1 p.m. in one area of a community and all 
involve broken glass in a door, one may infer that the same 
individual committed the crimes. Th e probability of the 
burglaries being unrelated is low. One may further assume 
that the burglar would not commit armed robbery or other 
crimes unless surprised while committing a burglary.
 
Such assumptions are not certainties, however. Some 
criminals commit several types of crimes and may change 
the type according to need, opportunity, inability to 
repeat certain types of crimes or greater sophistication. 
For example, a narcotics user may commit larceny, bur-
glary or robbery to obtain money for drugs. A burglar may 
switch from targeting residences to engaging in shoplift-
ing or may ﬁ rst steal checks and a check writer and then 
turn to forgery to cash the checks. Suspects should never 
be eliminated simply because their known MO does not ﬁ t 
the crime being investigated.
GOALS OF CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATIONS
The goal of criminal investigation would seem to 
 be to solve cases, to discover “whodunit.” In 
reality, the goals of criminal investigation are not quite so 
1Some states, such as Illinois, do not consider violations of city ordinances 
to be crimes.

8 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
simple. To hold oﬀ enders to account, criminal investiga-
tion has several important goals.
The goals of criminal investigation are to 
• • Determine whether a crime has been committed.
• • Legally obtain information and evidence to identify 
the responsible person.
• • Arrest the suspect.
• • Recover stolen property.
• • Present the best possible case to the prosecutor.
 
While committing crimes, people may make mistakes. 
Th ey almost always leave some type of evidence. Th ey may 
overlook tangible evidence such as a jacket, pen, purse, 
piece of paper or card that connects them with a crime 
scene. Such evidence may be left for any number of rea-
sons: carelessness, panic, underestimation of police capa-
bilities, emotional or mental instability or the inﬂ uence 
of drugs or alcohol. More often, however, criminals leave 
trace evidence, less visible evidence such as ﬁ ngerprints, 
small particles of glass or dirt, a faint footprint, body hairs 
or clothing ﬁ bers.
 
Investigators search for evidence using methods dis-
cussed fully in Chapter 4. Sometimes, however, little or 
no evidence exists. Th us, not all crimes are solvable. For 
example, a theft committed by a transient who enters a 
house through an open door, takes food (larceny), eats it 
and then leaves the area unseen is a crime not likely to be 
solved. A burglary committed by a person wearing gloves 
and whose footprints are washed away by a hard rain 
before police arrive will be more diﬃ  cult to solve than if 
it had not rained. Often ﬁ ngerprints are found but can-
not be matched with any prints on ﬁ le. Many cases have 
insuﬃ  cient evidence, no witnesses and no informants to 
provide leads.
 
Investigators learn to recognize when a case is unsolv-
able, but only after all leads (avenues bearing clues or 
potential sources of information relevant to solving the 
crime) have been exhausted. A Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation (FBI) agent once remarked, “Any average person 
with training can pursue ‘hot’ leads. It is the investigator 
who can develop leads when the trail grows cold who is 
the superior investigator.” A successful investigation is 
one in which
• • A logical sequence is followed.
• • All physical evidence is legally obtained.
• • All witnesses are eﬀ ectively interviewed.
• • All suspects are legally and eﬀ ectively interrogated.
• • All leads are thoroughly developed.
• • All details of the case are accurately and completely 
recorded and reported.
 
Investigators systematically seek evidence to identify 
the individual who committed a crime, locate the indi-
vidual and obtain suﬃ  cient evidence to prove in court 
that the suspect is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Procedures to accomplish these goals are the focus of the 
remainder of this text. However, determining the truth 
is more important than obtaining a conviction or closing 
a case.
BASIC FUNCTIONS
Successful investigation involves a balance 
 between scientiﬁ c knowledge acquired by study 
and experience and the skills acquired by the artful applica-
tion of learned techniques. Police portrayals in mystery 
stories and on radio and television seldom depict police 
investigations accurately.
 
Police investigations involve great attention to detail, 
an exceptionally suspicious nature at the appropriate 
time, considerable training in the classroom and the ﬁ eld, 
an unusual ability to obtain information from diverse 
types of personalities under adverse circumstances and 
endless patience and perseverance.
Investigators perform the following functions: 
• • Provide emergency assistance
• • Secure the crime scene
• • Photograph, videotape and sketch
• • Take notes and write reports
• • Search for, obtain and process physical evidence
• • Obtain information from witnesses and suspects
• • Identify suspects
• • Conduct raids, surveillances, stakeouts and 
undercover assignments
• • Testify in court
 
Most of these basic functions are discussed in Section 
2. What is important at this point is to realize the com-
plexity of and interrelationships among the various func-
tions performed by investigators and the skills they must 
develop.
 
Criminal investigation has become more scientiﬁ c 
since 1750, when Henry Fielding’s Bow Street Runners 
became the ﬁ rst paid detectives, as shown in Table 1.1. 
Despite these advances, investigators are frequently 
required to practice the “art” of investigation, that is, to 
rely on skill acquired by experience, study and observation 
rather than on scientiﬁ c principles. Th ey must develop 
the ability to see relationships between and among 

CHAPTER 1 | Criminal Investigation:  An Overview | 9
apparently unrelated facts and to question the apparently 
unquestionable.
CHARACTERISTICS OF AN 
EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATOR
A good investigator is knowledgeable, creative, 
patient and persistent. A good investigator 
also reads a lot about a variety of subjects. Regardless of 
title, pay or rank, investigative oﬃ  cers are more eﬀ ec-
tive when they possess speciﬁ c intellectual, psychologi-
cal and physical characteristics.
INTELLECTUAL CHARACTERISTICS
Investigators must absorb training and apply it to their 
work. Th ey must know the elements of the crime, under-
stand and be able to apply investigative techniques and be 
able to work with many diﬀ erent types of people. Excep-
tional intelligence is not a requisite trait of an eﬀ ective 
investigator; objectivity, logic and common sense are 
more important.
Effective investigators obtain and retain information; 
apply technical knowledge; and remain open-minded, 
objective and logical. They are also culturally adroit, 
that is, skilled in interacting across gender, ethnic, 
generational, social and political group lines.

schoolgirls. The police held a prime suspect in the case, a kitchen porter at an insane asylum who had confessed 
to one of the murders. They brought Jeffreys semen samples from the murder scenes and a blood sample from the 
suspect. Jeffreys conﬁ rmed that the same person committed both crimes, but it was not the suspect the police 
held. On November 21, 1986, the kitchen porter became the ﬁ rst person in the world to have his innocence proven 
by DNA testing.)
1988
First use of DNA typing in a criminal case, in the United States, in which a criminal was identiﬁ ed by DNA (Florida 
v. Tommy Lee Andrews). (Lifecodes Corporation [Stamford, CT] performed the tests in the ﬁ rst case in the United 
States in which a criminal was identiﬁ ed by DNA. The trial of accused rapist Tommy Lee Andrews began in 
Orlando, Florida, on November 3, 1987. A scientist from Lifecodes and an MIT biologist testiﬁ ed that semen from 
the victim matched Andrews’ DNA and that Andrews’ print would be found in only 1 in 10 billion individuals. On 
November 6, 1987, the jury returned a guilty verdict, and Andrews was subsequently sentenced to 22 years in 
prison.)

10 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
 
Investigators obtain vast amounts of information. 
Th ey meet and talk with people from all walks of life—blue-
collar workers and professionals, males and females, adults 
and juveniles—and must adjust their approach to each. In 
addition, each crime scene must be absorbed and recalled, 
sometimes months or years later. Th us, accurate, complete, 
well-organized reports and records are essential.
 
Investigators also develop knowledge of and skill in 
investigative techniques such as interviewing and interro-
gating, photographing and sketching, searching, note taking 
and numerous other areas discussed in Section 2. Knowl-
edge of and skill in investigative techniques are acquired 
through continuous training and experience, including aca-
demic classroom experiences, personal experiences, street 
learning and learning from others in the ﬁ eld.
 
Th e abilities to obtain and retain information and to 
use investigative techniques eﬀ ectively are worth little 
without the ability to reason through a case. Th e mental 
process involved in investigation is extremely complex. 
Logic is indispensable and often involves reverse thinking, 
that is, working the case backward. Why did an event hap-
pen? When? How? Who is culpable? Investigators must 
examine all possible cause-and-eﬀ ect relations, ﬁ nd links 
and draw conclusions—but only after they thoroughly 
explore all alternatives.
 
Decision making is continual and, to be eﬀ ective, must 
be based on facts. When investigators review information 
and evidence, they concentrate on what is known (facts), 
rather than on what is only probable (inferences), and they 
eliminate personal opinions as much as possible. With suf-
ﬁ cient facts, investigators can make valid inferences, from 
which they can logically draw deﬁ nite conclusions.
 
A fact is an action, an event, a circumstance or an 
actual thing done. In contrast, an inference is a process of 
reasoning by which a fact may be deduced (deductive rea-
soning). An opinion is a personal belief. For example, an 
investigator called to the scene of a shooting ﬁ nds a dead 
man with a revolver in his hand (fact) and a suicide note 
on the table (fact). Th e oﬃ  cer might infer that the man 
committed suicide. He or she might also hold the opinion 
that people who commit suicide are cowards. Th is opin-
ion is irrelevant to the investigation. Th e inference, how-
ever, is critical. If the oﬃ  cer formulates a theory about the 
death based on suicide and sets out to prove the theory 
correct, much information and evidence may be ignored. 
Th is is known as inductive reasoning, going from the 
generalization and establishing it by gathering speciﬁ c 
facts. (Recall that criminal investigation is a reconstruc-
tive process that uses deductive reasoning.) Often both 
types of reasoning are required in an investigation.
 
Although investigators must draw inferences and 
form theories, they must also remain open-minded and 
willing to consider alternatives. Eﬀ ective investigators 
guard against the tendency to become sold on a suspect 
or theory early in an investigation because such a mind-
set creates an investigative myopia or shortsightedness, 
fostering the subconscious shaping of evidence or inter-
preting information to support their premature theory. 
Preconceived ideas hinder good investigation; objectivity 
is essential. Whenever an inference is drawn, its valid-
ity should be tested by examining the facts on which it 
is based. All alternatives should be considered; otherwise, 
valuable time may be lost, evidence may disappear or the 
case may simply remain unsolved.
Popular television series such as CSI 
have brought the role of the investigator 
into the public eye, perhaps raising 
expectations that a case can be 
solved within an hour, with time out for 
commercials. (© Eric Liebowitz/CBS Photo

CHAPTER 1 | Criminal Investigation:  An Overview | 11
 
Th e hazards of drawing premature conclusions are 
illustrated by a homicide case in which lie-detection tests 
were given to two main suspects. Suspect A was given two 
polygraph tests by separate operators. Both tests indicated 
that he was deceptive on critical questions concerning the 
case. Suspect B was given a lie-detection voice-stress test 
that indicated he was truthful on the same questions. 
Based on these results, the investigators concentrated on 
discovering evidence to link Suspect A to the crime and 
ignored Suspect B. After 6 months of following up leads 
that turned into dead ends, the investigators resumed 
their investigation of Suspect B and discovered enough 
evidence to persuade him to confess to the crime.
 
Th e point of this illustration is not that lie-detection 
tests are invalid. In fact, correlation between positive test 
results and suspect involvement or guilt is very high. Th e 
point is that no one fact should dominate an entire inves-
tigation. All alternatives should be considered. In our illus-
trative case, Suspect B had taken six tranquilizers before 
taking the test, which made interpretation more diﬃ  cult. 
Suspect A may have been involved in an unrelated homi-
cide or may simply have been extremely nervous because 
he was a prime suspect. Perseverance eventually revealed 
the truth despite evidence apparently to the contrary.
 
Th e investigator seeks the truth, not simply proof of 
the suspect’s guilt. Article 10 of the Canons of Police Ethics 
(International Association of Chiefs of Police) states, 
Th e law enforcement oﬃ  cer shall be concerned equally 
in the prosecution of the wrongdoer and the defense 
of the innocent. He shall ascertain what constitutes 
evidence and shall present such evidence impartially 
and without malice. In so doing, he will ignore social, 
political and all other distinctions among the persons 
involved, strengthening the tradition of the reliability 
and integrity of an oﬃ  cer’s word.
 
Th e law enforcement oﬃ  cer shall take special pains 
to increase his perception and skill of observation, 
mindful that in many situations his is the sole impartial 
testimony to the facts of a case.
PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Certain psychological characteristics are indispensable to 
eﬀ ective investigation.
Effective investigators are emotionally well balanced, 
detached, inquisitive, suspecting, discerning, 
self-disciplined and persevering.
 
Investigation is highly stressful and involves many 
decisions. Th erefore, it requires emotional stability. Overly 
defensive or overly sensitive oﬃ  cers may fall victim to stress. 
Investigators must also absorb abuse and at the same time 
show kindness and empathy. Further, they must remain 
detached and uninvolved; otherwise, the problems of those 
with whom they are in contact will decrease their objectiv-
ity. Personal involvement with individuals associated with 
an investigation hinders the investigation and poses a direct 
threat to the investigator’s emotional well-being.
 
Although remaining detached and objective, eﬀ ective 
investigators are intimately involved with every aspect of 
the case. Th ey do not accept things at face value; rather, 
they question what they hear and see. Th ey use their 
knowledge of human nature to determine the truth of 
what is said. People often lie or tell half-truths, but this 
does not necessarily mean they are criminals. With expe-
rience, investigators develop a sense for who is telling the 
truth, who has important information and who is acting 
suspiciously. Th e ability to distinguish the ordinary from 
the extraordinary and the normal from the suspicious is a 
hallmark of an eﬀ ective investigator.
 
In addition, investigators must be self-disciplined and 
able to organize their time. Success often depends on an 
investigator developing eﬃ  cient work habits, setting priori-
ties and using time wisely. Closely related to self-discipline 
is the willingness to persevere, to “stick with it” as long as 
is reasonable. Investigation often involves hours, days or 
months of waiting and watching, of performing tedious, bor-
ing assignments that may or may not yield information or 
evidence helpful to the case. Th us, patience and perseverance 
are often the key to successful investigation. And although 
perseverance is desirable, it should not be confused with a 
stubborn refusal to admit a case is not likely to be solved.
 
Investigators often experience cases in which facts, 
reason and logic seem to lead nowhere. Yet, when the 
case is about to be closed, additional clues often surface 
by chance. An obscure newspaper item, an anonymous 
phone tip, an overheard remark at a social function or 
even a series of events having no apparent connection 
with the case may provide leads for further investigation. 
Many cases are solved when investigators develop leads 
and pursue both relevant and seemingly irrelevant infor-
mation. Th is is where the art of investigation supersedes 
the science of investigation.
 
Perseverance, coupled with inquisitiveness and intu-
ition, is indispensable in diﬃ  cult cases. Although some 
deny the existence or worth of intuition, hundreds of 
experienced investigators attest to its value. Intuition 
is a “sudden knowing” without conscious reasoning or 
apparent logic. Based on knowledge and experience, it is 
commonly referred to as street sense. It is the urge to pro-
ceed with no apparent valid reason, a “gut feeling” devel-
oped through experience. 
 
Monreal (2007) describes a situation in which a neigh-
boring jurisdiction placed a mutual aid request to search 
for two suspects involved in the theft of several bottles 

12 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
of liquor from a store. He spotted the suspect vehicle on 
the highway dividing the two jurisdictions and planned to 
stop it. However, he noticed three people in the car rather 
than two, and the front seat passenger was reaching under 
the car’s seat. Something just didn’t feel right. He called 
for backup before ordering the suspects out of the car, 
one at a time, detaining them for further investigation. 
Th e veteran oﬃ  cers who had requested the assistance 
were amused at the call for backup, implying it was over-
kill. However, one of the suspects who had been charged 
with the theft committed a double homicide 2 weeks later. 
Monreal’s advice: “Trust your instincts and stay safe!”
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Age, height and weight, unless they are extreme, are not 
important characteristics for investigators. However, 
some physical characteristics are important.
Effective investigators are physically ﬁ t and have good 
vision and hearing.
 
Good health and a high energy level are beneﬁ cial 
because the hours spent performing investigative duties 
can be long and demanding. In addition to being physically 
ﬁ t, investigators are aided by keen vision and hearing. If 
uncorrected, color blindness, nearsightedness, night blind-
ness and farsightedness may impair investigative eﬀ ec-
tiveness. Hearing is especially important when darkness 
limits vision. Keen hearing helps estimate the nearness of 
a suspect, the movement of animals or people, the direc-
tion of gunﬁ re or other detonations and the direction of 
foot sounds. In addition, investigators may have to listen 
to words during sobbing, moans and hysteria; hear a very 
weak voice from a seriously wounded or dying person; lis-
ten to more than one person talking at a time; or conduct 
an interview while a plane is ﬂ ying overhead, machinery 
is operating or heavy traﬃ  c is passing by. All these intel-
lectual, psychological and physical characteristics may be 
needed in the preliminary investigation of a crime.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE 
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS
A criminal investigation is usually initiated by 
personal observation or information from a 
citizen. Patrol oﬃ  cers may see a suspicious action or per-
son, or a citizen may report suspicious actions or people.

areas, much larger staﬀ s, computer-dispatched vehicles 
and personnel and, thus, much larger budgets.
 
It is important to arrive at a crime scene rapidly 
because
• • Th e suspect may still be at or near the scene.
• • Injured persons may need emergency care.
• • Witnesses may still be at the scene.
• • A dying person may have a confession or other perti-
nent information to give.
• • Weather conditions may change or destroy evidence.
• • Someone may attempt to alter the crime scene.
 
Th e responding oﬃ  cers proceed to the scene as 
quickly as safety allows. Oﬃ  cers who injure themselves or 
someone else on the way to a call may create more serious 
problems than exist at the crime scene. Th ey may, in fact, 
open themselves, their department and even their city to 
a civil lawsuit.
 
Th e seriousness of a crime and whether it is in prog-
ress are important factors in the rapidity of response. Th e 
driving speed and use of emergency lights and siren depend 
on the information furnished. A siren speeds arrival, but 
it also prompts the criminal to ﬂ ee the scene. On the other 
hand, in a violent crime against a person, a siren alerts the 
oﬀ ender but may prevent further violence. Sometimes 
the victim, to avoid attracting attention, requests that no 
sirens and red lights be used. 
Such information is received at police headquarters by 
telephone, fax, e-mail, radio or direct report when a per-
son steps up to a police complaint desk. A police dis-
patcher relays the information to a patrol oﬃ  cer by radio 
or phone, and the oﬃ  cer responds. However the incident 
becomes known to police, this reporting of a crime sets 
the investigative wheels in motion and is the ﬁ rst stage 
in a criminal investigation. Th e various stages of the 
investigative process, as well as the personnel involved, 
the oﬃ  cial reports generated and the victim’s role, are 
described in Table 1.2.
 
Th us, an investigation starts with a direction to pro-
ceed to a scene. Department policy deﬁ nes not only who is 
to respond but also the duties of these individuals, as well 
as those of evidence technicians, investigators, supervisors 
and command personnel.
THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION: BASIC 
CONSIDERATIONS
The ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer who responds is in charge until 
 relieved by another oﬃ  cer. Th e same basic pro-
cedures are followed regardless of whether the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer 
at the scene is a patrol oﬃ  cer, an investigator or the chief 
of police.
The initial response is usually by a patrol ofﬁ cer 
 assigned to the area where a crime has occurred.
 
Th e initial response is crucial to the success of an 
investigation. Although it is popularly believed that cases 
are won or lost in court, more cases actually are lost dur-
ing the ﬁ rst hour of an investigation—the initial response 
period—than in court.
THE INITIAL RESPONSE
After notiﬁ cation, either through direct observation or 
departmental communications, oﬃ  cers go to the scene 
as rapidly and safely as circumstances permit. A crime-
 response survey conducted by the Law Enforcement Assis-
tance Administration (LEAA) revealed that a response time 
of 1 minute or less is necessary to increase the probability 
of arrest at the scene. Most police departments, however, 
cannot assure their citizens of such a short response time, 
even for emergencies. To provide a 1-minute response 
time, police agencies would need much smaller patrol 
Preplanning routes to high-crime areas can be critical to rapid 
response time. Even if no immediate arrest is made, the amount of 
information that can be obtained is directly related to the speed of 
the response. (© Stephane Brunet/911 Pictures)

Th e route taken is also discretionary. Oﬃ  cers should 
know which streets are under construction in their areas 
and avoid them. Th ey must also choose between the fast-
est route and the route the suspect might use to leave the 
scene. When approaching a scene, oﬃ  cers should observe 
people leaving the scene and make mental notes of their 
descriptions. If two oﬃ  cers are in the patrol vehicle, one 
may write descriptions of people and vehicles observed 
leaving the scene. Many oﬃ  cers use tape recorders for 
such observations. Th is equipment permits either a single 
oﬃ  cer or the second person in a two-oﬃ  cer car to record 
while proceeding to the scene.
 
If other oﬃ  cers are available, they are alerted to cover 
escape routes rather than go directly to the scene. While 
driving to the scene, oﬃ  cers formulate a plan of action 
based on the type of crime and its location.
 
An immediate response may be crucial because, even 
if no immediate arrest is made, the amount of informa-
tion that can be obtained is directly related to the speed 
of response.
 
Initial information is often the most important and 
accurate. Many departments are developing necessary 
guidelines for rapid responses, replacing the assumption 
that all calls for service should be responded to as rapidly 
as possible.
 
Other departments are ﬁ nding that sending several 
vehicles to a crime scene may not be the most eﬀ ective 
approach. Instead, they implement a “bull’s-eye,” or tar-
get, approach, dispatching only a few vehicles directly 
to the crime scene (the bull’s-eye). Other units are sent 
to observe traﬃ  c at major intersections radiating away 
from the crime scene in an attempt to intercept ﬂ eeing 
suspects. Success depends on broadcasting the suspects’ 
descriptions rapidly and getting to the major intersections 
quickly. In many cases, such a response is more eﬀ ective in 
catching the suspects than focusing all resources directly 
on the crime scene itself.
THE POINT OF ARRIVAL
When the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cers arrive, the scene may be either 
utter confusion or deserted. Regardless of the situation, 
the oﬃ  cers must take charge immediately and form a plan 
for proceeding. Th e actions the ﬁ rst responders take at a 
crime scene can determine the value of the evidence for 
investigators and prosecutors (Spraggs, 2006, p.36). 
 
People at a crime scene are usually excited, appre-
hensive and perplexed. Th ey may be cooperative or unco-
operative, confused or lucid. Th erefore, oﬃ  cers must be 
ﬂ exible and understanding. Discretion and good judgment 
are essential because the greatest potential for solving 
the case lies with those present at the scene, even though 
many details of the crime may not be known at this stage. 
More decisions are made in less time at the point of arrival 
than at any other stage in the investigation, and this is 
when oﬃ  cers obtain most leads for subsequent action.
SETTING PRIORITIES
Circumstances at the scene often dictate what is done 
ﬁ rst.
The priorities are 
• • Handle emergencies ﬁ rst.
• • Secure the scene.
• • Investigate.
 
Th e following guidelines can be adapted to ﬁ t speciﬁ c 
circumstances.
HANDLING EMERGENCY SITUATIONS
Sometimes emergencies dictate procedure. An emergency 
may include a dangerous suspect at or near the scene or 
a gravely injured person. For example, if you arrive at a 
crime scene and the suspect begins to shoot at you, appre-
hending the suspect obviously becomes your ﬁ rst priority. 
In other instances, a person may be so seriously injured 
that without immediate care, death is probable. Such 
emergencies take precedence over all other procedures.
 
Good judgment and the number of available oﬃ  cers 
dictate what should occur ﬁ rst if more than one emergency 
exists. Sometimes the decision is diﬃ  cult. For example, if 
a victim is drowning, a suspect is running away and only 
one oﬃ  cer is at the scene, the oﬃ  cer must make a split-
second decision. Usually, saving life takes precedence. 
However, if the oﬃ  cer can do nothing to save the victim, 
the best alternative is to pursue the suspect. Apprehend-
ing the suspect may save other victims.
 
Responding to emergency situations causes the adren-
aline to ﬂ ow. At the same time, oﬃ  cers must plan their 
approach. One oﬃ  cer facing a life-or-death situation said 
he thought of a quotation: “Death must be a beautiful 
moment; otherwise they wouldn’t save it until last.” Hold-
ing this thought, he carried out his immediate responsi-
bilities without hesitation. Oﬃ  cers, however, must remain 
extremely vigilant regarding the inherent danger asso-
ciated with in-progress crimes: “Oﬃ  cer deaths from in-
progress crimes (robbery, burglary, etc.) still rank near the 
top of the annual FBI Uniform Crime Reports’ Oﬃ  cer Killed 
Summaries” (Grossi, 2007, p.24).
 
Oﬃ  cers should also attempt to think like the suspect. 
Th ey should decide which escape routes are probable and 
block them. Available information about the situation 
helps oﬃ  cers decide whether using lights and siren is 

CHAPTER 1 | Criminal Investigation:  An Overview | 15
advantageous to them or to the suspect. Oﬃ  cers should 
think about what they would do if they were the suspect 
and were cornered at the crime scene. If it is daytime, oﬃ  -
cers may be visible and the suspect not. If it is nighttime, 
oﬃ  cers may be able to take advantage of a darker area for 
their approach.
 
Flexibility is essential. Th e situation must be carefully 
assessed because each incident is diﬀ erent and requires 
diﬀ erent approaches and techniques. Oﬃ  cers should be 
cognizant that more than one suspect may be present. 
Th ey should check their equipment on the way to the 
scene and provide the dispatcher with all pertinent infor-
mation. Maintaining some distance can facilitate obser-
vation and give oﬃ  cers time to make decisions that will 
enhance their safety.
A Suspect At or Near the Scene If a call is made 
rapidly enough and oﬃ  cers can respond quickly, they may 
observe the crime in progress and arrest the suspect at 
the scene.
Any suspect at the scene should be detained, 
questioned and then released or arrested, depending 
on circumstances.
 
Departmental policy determines whether the ﬁ rst oﬃ  -
cer at the scene thoroughly interrogates a suspect. Before 
any in-custody interrogation, an oﬃ  cer must read the 
Miranda warning to the suspect (a legality discussed in 
Chapter 6). Even if the policy is that oﬃ  cers do not inter-
rogate suspects, oﬃ  cers often use discretion. For example, 
they may have to take a dying declaration or a suspect’s 
spontaneous confession. If this occurs, a statement is taken 
immediately because the suspect may refuse, or be unable, 
to cooperate later. A more formal interrogation and written 
confession can be obtained later at the police department.
 
Th e suspect is removed from the scene as soon as 
possible to minimize the destruction of evidence and to 
facilitate questioning. Th e sooner suspects are removed, 
the less they can observe of the crime scene and possible 
evidence against them.
If the Suspect Has Recently Fled If the suspect has 
just left the scene, immediate action is required. If the 
information is provided early enough, other units en 
route to the scene may make an arrest.
If a suspect has recently left the scene, ofﬁ cers obtain 
descriptions of the suspect, any vehicles, direction of 
travel and any items taken. The information is dispatched 
to headquarters immediately.
 
As soon as practical, oﬃ  cers obtain more detailed 
information about the suspect’s possible whereabouts, 
friends, descriptions of stolen items and other relevant 
information regarding past criminal records and MOs.
If a Person Is Seriously Injured Emergency ﬁ rst aid 
to victims, witnesses and suspects is often a top priority 
of arriving oﬃ  cers. Oﬃ  cers should call for medical assis-
tance and then do whatever possible until help arrives. 
Th ey should observe and record the injured person’s condi-
tion. When medical help arrives, oﬃ  cers should assist and 
instruct medical personnel during the care and removal of 
those injured to diminish the risk of contaminating the 
scene and losing evidence.
 
If a person is injured so severely that he or she must 
be removed from the scene, attending medical personnel 
should be instructed to listen to any statements or utter-
ances the victim makes and to save all clothing for evi-
dence. If the injured person is a suspect, a police oﬃ  cer 
almost always accompanies the suspect to the hospital. Th e 
humanitarian priority of administering ﬁ rst aid may have 
to become second priority if a dangerous suspect is still at 
or near the scene because others may be injured or killed.
If a Dead Body Is at the Scene A body at the crime 
scene may immediately become the center of attention, 
and even a suspect may be overlooked. If the victim is obvi-
ously dead, the body should be left just as it was found but 
it and its surroundings protected. Identifying the body is 
not an immediate concern. Preserving the scene is more 
important because it may later yield clues about the dead 
person’s identity, the cause of death and the individual 
responsible, as discussed in Chapter 8.
PROTECTING THE CRIME SCENE
Securing the crime scene is a major responsibility of 
the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cers to arrive. Everything of a nonemer-
gency nature is delayed until the scene is protected. Th e 
critical importance of securing the crime scene is better 
understood when one considers Locard’s principle of 
exchange, a basic forensic theory holding that objects 
that come in contact with each other always transfer mate-
rial, however minute, to each other. Th is evidence can eas-
ily be lost if the crime scene goes unprotected. At outdoor 
scenes, weather conditions such as heat, wind, rain, snow 
or sleet can alter or destroy physical evidence. In addi-
tion, people may accidentally or intentionally disturb the 
scene. Additions to the scene can be as disconcerting to 
later investigation as the removal of evidence is.
Oﬃ  cers should explain to bystanders that protect-
ing the crime scene is critical and that the public must 
be excluded. Bystanders should be treated courteously 

16 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
but ﬁ rmly. A delicate part of public relations is dealing 
with the family of someone who has been killed. Oﬃ  cers 
should explain what they are doing and why and help fam-
ily members understand that certain steps must be taken 
to discover what happened and who is responsible.
 
Crime scene protection can be as simple as locking a 
door to a room or building, or it can involve roping oﬀ  a 
large area outdoors. Within a room, chairs or boxes can 
be used to cordon oﬀ  an area. Many oﬃ  cers carry rope in 
their vehicle for this purpose and attach a sign that says, 
“CRIME SCENE—DO NOT ENTER.”
 
A guard should be stationed to maintain security. If all 
oﬃ  cers are busy with emergency matters, a citizen may be 
asked to help protect the area temporarily. In such cases, 
the citizen’s name, address and phone number should be 
recorded. Th e citizen should be given speciﬁ c instructions 
and minimal duties. Th e citizen’s main duty is to protect 
the crime scene by barring entrance and to keep passersby 
moving along. He or she should not let any person into the 
area except police who identify themselves with a badge. 
Th e citizen should be relieved from guard duty as soon as 
possible and thanked for the assistance.
 
Sometimes other oﬃ  cers arriving at the scene can cause 
problems by ignoring posted warnings and barriers. Ironi-
cally, police oﬃ  cers with no assigned responsibilities at a scene 
are often the worst oﬀ enders. Arriving oﬃ  cers and everyone 
present at the scene should be told what has happened and 
what they need to do. Other oﬃ  cers can be asked to help pre-
serve the scene, interview witnesses or search for evidence.
All necessary measures to secure the crime scene 
must be taken—including locking, roping, barricading 
and guarding—until the preliminary investigation is 
completed.
 
Evidence should be protected from destruction or 
alteration from the elements by being covered until pho-
tographing and measuring can be done. Sometimes inves-
tigators must move evidence before they can examine it. 
For example, a vehicle covered with snow, dust or other 
materials can be moved into a garage. In one case, a car 
used in a kidnapping was found four days later in a parking 
lot. Snow that had fallen since the kidnapping covered the 
car. To process the car’s exterior for ﬁ ngerprints, investi-
gators took the car to a garage to let the snow melt and the 
surface dry. Evidence is discussed in depth in Chapter 5.
CONDUCTING THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
After all emergency matters have been handled and the crime 
scene has been secured, the actual preliminary investigation 
can begin. Th is includes several steps whose order depends 
on the speciﬁ c crime and the types of evidence and wit-
nesses available. Appendix A contains a detailed checklist of 
steps to be taken by ﬁ rst responders at a crime scene.
Responsibilities during the preliminary investigation 
include
• • Questioning victims, witnesses and suspects.
• • Conducting a neighborhood canvass.
• • Measuring, photographing, videotaping and 
sketching the scene.
• • Searching for evidence.
• • Identifying, collecting, examining and processing 
physical evidence.
• • Recording all statements and observations in notes.
 
Each of these procedures is explained in Section 2. 
At this point, what is important is the total picture, the 
overview. In simple cases, one oﬃ  cer may perform all 
these procedures; in complex cases, responsibilities may 
be divided among several oﬃ  cers. Everything that occurs 
at a crime scene is recorded with photographs, videotape, 
sketches and complete, accurate notes. Th is record is the 
basis of future reports and for future investigation and 
prosecution of the case.
 
Information may be volunteered by victims, witnesses 
or suspects at or very near to the time of the criminal actions. 
Unplanned statements about what happened by people 
present are called res gestae (“things done”) statements.
Res gestae statements are spontaneous statements made 
at the time of a crime concerning and closely related to 
actions involved in the crime. They are often considered 
more truthful than later, planned responses.
 
Res gestae statements are generally an exception to the 
hearsay rule because they are usually very closely related 
to facts and are therefore admissible in court. Res gestae 
statements should be recorded in the ﬁ eld notes, and the 
person making the statements should sign or initial them 
so there is no question of misunderstanding or of the per-
son later denying having made the statement.
 
In addition to receiving and recording voluntary 
statements by victims and witnesses, investigators must 
go looking for information by conducting a neighborhood 
canvass as discussed in Chapter 6.
Determining Whether a Crime Has Been Committed 
and When As soon as possible during the preliminary 
investigation, it is necessary to determine whether a crime 
has, in fact, been committed.

CHAPTER 1 | Criminal Investigation:  An Overview | 17
Determining whether a crime has been committed 
involves knowing the elements of each major offense 
and the evidence that supports them and ascertaining 
whether they are present. Ofﬁ cers also try to determine 
when the event occurred.
 
Individual elements of various oﬀ enses are discussed 
in Sections 3 and 4.
 
Oﬃ  cers should observe the condition of the scene 
and talk to the complainant as soon as possible. After dis-
cussing the oﬀ ense with the victim or complainant, the 
oﬃ  cers should determine whether a speciﬁ c crime has 
been committed. It is common for crime victims to mis-
classify what has occurred. For example, they may report 
a burglary as a robbery. In addition, state statutes diﬀ er 
in their deﬁ nitions of the elements of certain crimes. For 
example, in some states, entering a motor vehicle with 
intent to steal is larceny. In other states, it is burglary. 
Determining when the event occurred is critical for check-
ing alibis and reconstructing the MO.
 
If no crime has been committed—for example, the 
matter is a civil rather than a criminal situation—the vic-
tim should be told how to obtain assistance.
Field Tests Investigators often want to know whether 
evidence discovered is what they think it is—for example, 
a bloodstain or an illegal substance. Field-test kits help in 
this determination.
 
Field tests save investigators’ time by identifying 
evidence that may have little chance of yielding positive 
results in the laboratory, and ﬁ eld tests are less expensive 
than full lab examinations. However, they are used on 
only a small number of speciﬁ c items of evidence located 
at crime scenes. If a ﬁ eld test is aﬃ  rmative, the evidence is 
submitted to a laboratory for a more detailed, expert exam-
ination whose results can then be presented in court.
 
Investigators can use ﬁ eld tests to develop and lift ﬁ n-
gerprints; discover ﬂ ammable substances through vapor 
and ﬂ uid examination; detect drugs, explosive substances 
on hands or clothing, imprints of ﬁ rearms on hands or 
bullet-hole residue; and conduct many other tests. Local, 
state and federal police laboratories can furnish informa-
tion on currently available ﬁ eld-test kits and may provide 
training in their use.
Establishing a Command Center In complex cases 
involving many oﬃ  cers, a command center may be set 
up where information about the crime is gathered and 
reviewed. Th is center receives summaries of communica-
tions, police reports, autopsy results, laboratory reports, 
results of interviews, updates on discovered evidence and 
tips. Personnel at the center keep ﬁ les of news releases 
and news articles and prepare an orderly, chronological 
progress report of the case for police command, staﬀ  and 
ﬁ eld personnel. If the investigation becomes lengthy, the 
command center can be moved to police headquarters.
Dealing with the News Media A close, almost symbi-
otic relationship exists between the police and the news 
media. Th ey depend upon each other. Th us, it is impor-
tant that the media and the police understand and respect 
each other’s roles and responsibilities.
 
Th e media serve the public’s right to know within 
legal and reasonable standards, a right protected by the 
First Amendment. Th e public is always hungry for news 
about crime. Th e police, on the other hand, are respon-
sible for upholding the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment 
guarantees of the right to a fair trial, the protection of a 
suspect’s rights and an individual’s right to privacy. Th is 
often necessitates conﬁ dentiality. Further, making some 
information public could impair or even destroy many 
investigations. On the other hand, the police rely on the 
media to disseminate news about wanted suspects or 
to seek witnesses from the community. Many cases are 
solved because of information from citizens.
 
Some departments use public information oﬃ  cers 
(PIOs) to interface with the media. Other departments 
assign the highest-ranking oﬃ  cer at the time of an incident 
or use written information releases. Still others allow vir-
tually any oﬃ  cer involved in a case to address the media.
 
Media access to police information is neither com-
prehensive nor absolute. In general, the media have no 
right to enter any area to which the public does not have 
access, and all rules at cordoned-oﬀ  crime scenes are as 
applicable to the media as they are to the general public. 
On the other hand, police may not construct a “cocoon” of 
secrecy. Neither should regard the other as the enemy.
 
Despite the need for cooperation, complaints from 
both sides are prevalent. Reporters complain that police 
withhold information and are uncooperative. Th e police 
complain that reporters interfere with cases and often 
sensationalize. 
 
Most members of the media understand the restric-
tions at a crime scene and cooperate. It is necessary to exer-
cise ﬁ rmness with those who do not follow instructions 
and even to exclude them if they jeopardize the investiga-
tion. Only facts—not opinions—should be given to report-
ers. Th e name of someone who has been killed should be 
given only after a careful identity check and notiﬁ cation of 
relatives. No information on the cause of death should be 
released; the medical examiner determines this. Likewise, 
no legal opinions about the speciﬁ c crime or the perpetra-
tor should be released. If oﬃ  cers do not know certain infor-
mation, they can simply state that they do not know. Th e 
phrase “no comment” should be avoided, as it implies you 

18 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
are hiding something. Th e beneﬁ t of a healthy relationship 
with the media is clear: “A good rapport with the media fos-
ters a positive relationship with the general public. If you 
have a good partnership with the media, you generally have 
a good relationship with the public, because that’s how the 
public gets information” (Garrett, 2007, p.24). Rosenthal 
(2007, p.6) notes, “Mainstream news reporters may never 
be your friends, but they are also almost never your ene-
mies either (Geraldo Rivera is a notable exception!). You 
may never walk hand-in-hand with reporters, but you can 
work shoulder to shoulder with them. Like you, they sim-
ply have a job to do. Deal With It! Like it or not, engage-
ment with the news media is inevitable. It is victory that is 
optional. Th e best-practices of law enforcement have com-
mitted to victory by embracing the DWI Principle.”
 
Paris (2007, p.51) oﬀ ers these suggestions for dealing 
with the media: conﬁ rm the situation and verify informa-
tion before giving any statement; position yourself with 
a provision for an easy exit; give a brief initial statement 
(5–10 seconds) with no questions answered and indicate 
police concern for the safety of those involved; establish 
your intent to return with additional information and set 
the time for the return. Additional advice for dealing with 
television reporters involves presenting a positive image, 
including marked patrol cars in the background and uni-
formed personnel actively engaged in the crime scene. 
Negative views to be avoided include body bags, yellow 
crime scene tape, hysterical victims and relatives, iden-
tifying or referencing items such as addresses, evidence 
that needs to be kept conﬁ dential and oﬃ  cers just stand-
ing around (Donlon-Cotton, 2007, pp.75–76).
 
Although an investigations section may handle com-
plex cases and those extending beyond the ability of 
patrol, patrol oﬃ  cers should handle a case from beginning 
to end whenever possible, including presenting it to the 
prosecutor, even if it means taking a case beyond the end 
of the watch (Stockton, 2006, p.12). Important beneﬁ ts of 
this follow-through include the following: 
 1. Patrol oﬃ  cers’ eﬀ ectiveness and expertise increase 
signiﬁ cantly.
 2. Initial eﬀ ort increases because oﬃ  cers know who’s 
working on the follow-up. 
 3. Follow-up is timelier, resulting in more reliable witness 
interviews.
 4. Job satisfaction increases.
 5. When patrol oﬃ  cers know how to conduct an inves-
tigation, a department has investigators working 
around the clock.
 6. Whether patrol oﬃ  cers or detectives investigate a 
case, crime scene investigators become involved in 
many instances.
CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS
A crime scene investigator (CSI) is a specialist in 
organized scientiﬁ c collection and processing 
of evidence. A CSI develops, processes and packages all 
physical evidence found at the crime scene and transports 
it to the lab for forensic evaluation; attends and docu-
ments autopsies; and writes reports and testiﬁ es in court 
about the evidence.
 
Th e public has become familiar with how CSIs oper-
ate through the popular television series CSI: Crime Scene 
Investigation, which ﬁ rst aired on CBS in October 2000, 
attracting millions of viewers who tune in to watch “gor-
geous investigators use techno-wizardry to uncover and 
analyze physical evidence, never failing in their eﬀ orts to 
Photographers watch as investigators collect evidence at a mass 
grave site. The media have no right to enter any area to which 
the public does not have access. However, the police may 
not construct a cocoon of secrecy around a case either.

solve the crime” (Dutelle, 2006, p.113). Mertens (2006, 
p.52) describes what happens when real-life CSI and Hol-
lywood collide: “In today’s world of TV and movie drama, 
every case is solved, a conclusion always reached and the 
‘smoking gun’ consistently found, most times with very 
little eﬀ ort. . . . Th e ‘CSI’ culture also includes costumes, 
sets and vehicles the real CSI teams don’t even dream 
of.” Fantino (2007, p.26) calls this the “CSI eﬀ ect,” where 
“unrealistic portrayals of the science have translated to 
equally unrealistic expectations from not only the public 
but also other professions that operate within the justice 
system who now apparently believe in magic.”
 
Th e challenges of the CSI eﬀ ect for investigators and 
forensic experts alike are being brought to life in Ameri-
ca’s courtrooms: “Popular forensic drama television shows 
have resulted in a phenomenon which is impacting crimi-
nal investigations and driving jury verdicts across Amer-
ica. People who end up on a jury know, or think that they 
know, a great deal about forensic science and the kind of 
science necessary to solve crimes. Prosecutors say juries 
expect scientiﬁ c evidence in every case, even though the 
majority of criminal cases do not call for such evidence” 
(Dutelle, 2006, p.113). Shelton (2008, p.1) observes, 
Reality and ﬁ ction have begun to blur with crime maga-
zine television shows such as 48 Hours Mystery, Ameri-
can Justice, and even on occasion, Dateline NBC. Th ese 
programs portray actual cases, but only after exten-
sively editing the content and incorporating narration 
for dramatic eﬀ ect.
 
Th e next level of distortion of the criminal justice 
system is the extremely popular “reality-based” crime-
ﬁ ction television drama. Th e Law & Order franchise, for 
example appears on television several nights a week. . . .
 
Th e most popular courtroom dramas—whether 
actual, edited, or purely ﬁ ctional—focus on the use of 
new science and technology in solving crime. CSI Crime 
Scene Investigation has been called the most popular 
television show in the world. (According to a 2006 
weekly Nielsen rating, 70 million watched at least one 
of the three CSI shows.)
Before their participation in the trial process, 1,000 jurors 
were surveyed about their expectations regarding forensic 
evidence:
• • 46 percent expected to see some kind of scientiﬁ c evi-
dence in every criminal case.
• • 22 percent expected to see DNA evidence in every 
criminal case.
• • 36 percent expected to see ﬁ ngerprint evidence in 
every criminal case.
• • 32 percent expected to see ballistic or other ﬁ rearms 
laboratory evidence in every criminal case (Shelton, 
2008, p.3).
Th e survey found that for all categories of evidence, CSI 
viewers had higher expectations for scientiﬁ c evidence 
than non-viewers. However, “Potential jurors’ increased 
expectations of scientiﬁ c evidence did not translate into 
a demand for this type of evidence as a prerequisite for 
ﬁ nding someone guilty.” Says Shelton (2008, p.5), “Th ere 
was scant evidence in our survey results that CSI viewers 
were either more or less likely to acquit defendants with-
out scientiﬁ c evidence.”
 
Th e real issue is how the criminal justice system 
will respond to juror expectations. Th e ability to equip 
law enforcement and other investigating agencies with 
the most up-to-date scientiﬁ c equipment is beyond the 
capacity of most departments’ resources, and crime lab-
oratories are hard-pressed to handle what they are cur-
rently processing. A more practical response might be to 
equip oﬃ  cers of the court (judges, prosecutors, defense 
attorneys) with more eﬀ ective ways to address juror 
expectations: “Most importantly, prosecutors, defense 
lawyers and judges should understand, anticipate, and 
address the fact that jurors enter the courtroom with 
a lot of information about the criminal justice system 
and the availability of scientiﬁ c evidence. Th e bottom 
line is this: Our criminal justice system must ﬁ nd ways 
to adapt to the increased expectations of those whom 
we ask to cast votes of ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’” (Shelton, 
2008, p.6).
 
Th e increased attention to the job of the CSI can be 
seen in some colleges oﬀ ering a degree in crime scene 
technology. 
THE FOLLOW-UP 
INVESTIGATION
Preliminary investigations that satisfy all the 
 investigative criteria do not necessarily yield 
enough information to prosecute a case. Despite a thorough 
preliminary investigation, many cases require a follow-up 
investigation. A need for a follow-up investigation does not 
necessarily reﬂ ect poorly on those who conducted the pre-
liminary investigation. Often factors exist that are beyond 
the oﬃ  cers’ control. Weather can destroy evidence before 
oﬃ  cers arrive at a scene, witnesses can be uncooperative 
and evidence may be weak or nonexistent, even after a very 
thorough preliminary investigation.
 
Th e follow-up phase builds on what was learned dur-
ing the preliminary investigation. Th is phase can be con-
ducted by the oﬃ  cers who responded to the original call 
or, most often, by detectives or investigators, depending 
on the seriousness and complexity of the crime and the

size of the department. If investigators take over a case 
begun by patrol oﬃ  cers, coordination is essential.
 
Investigative leads that may need to be pursued 
include checking the victim’s background; talking to 
informants; determining who would beneﬁ t from the 
crime and who had suﬃ  cient knowledge to plan the 
crime; tracing weapons and stolen property; and search-
ing MO, mug shot and ﬁ ngerprint ﬁ les. Figure 1.1 pro-
vides an example of an investigative lead sheet that

dures for the major oﬀ enses are discussed in Sections 3,

COMPUTER-AIDED 
INVESTIGATION
Computers have signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ected police 
 operations. One of the biggest advances in 
using computer technology came in 1994 when William 
Bratton implemented the CompStat program in New 
York. From the beginning CompStat was hailed as an 
innovative managerial paradigm in policing: “CompStat 
(Computerized Statistics, aka Compare Statistics) is a 
goal-oriented, information-driven management process 
that stresses both operational strategy and managerial 
accountability. Its goal is to reduce crime and enhance the 
community’s quality of life. Th e CompStat process con-
sists of four components: (1) collection and analysis of 
crime data, (2) development of a strategy to address prob-
lems, (3) rapid deployment of resources, and (4) follow-up 
and accountability” (Geoghegan, 2006, p.42).
 
Computers also can help investigators eﬃ  ciently 
access existing information such as ﬁ ngerprint records 
and DNA tests, record new information and store it com-
pactly for instant transmission anywhere, analyze the 
information for patterns (mapping), link crimes and crim-
inals, manipulate digital representations to enhance the 
images and re-create and visually track a series of events. 
Computers are also increasingly being used for electronic 
document management, allowing investigators to scan 
evidence captured from paper and attach audio and video 
clips to the case ﬁ le. Furthermore, software is available 
to help investigators develop an analytical time line and 
manage the scheduling of tasks related to the investiga-
tion, such as follow-up interviews and evidence handling 
and analysis. 
 
Th e ability to share data across jurisdictional lines is 
one of the most valuable beneﬁ ts computers provide to 
investigators. In addition, the Internet has become an 
invaluable tool to criminal investigators. And although 
some agencies have yet to realize the full potential of 
Internet access, many others are already capitalizing on 
the multiple beneﬁ ts of being online. Th e Internet oﬀ ers 
hundreds of thousands of Web sites to aid informed 
investigators.
CRIME ANALYSIS, MAPPING AND 
GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Using crime mapping, spreadsheet software and advanced 
data analysis, crime analysis units have become integral 
partners in today’s policing. Before the computer revo-
lution, the traditional crime map consisted of a large 
representation of a jurisdiction glued onto a bulletin 
board with colored pins stuck into it. Th ese maps suf-
fered many limitations—they lost previous crime pat-
terns when they were updated, could not be manipulated 
or queried and were diﬃ  cult to read when several types 
of crimes represented by diﬀ erent colored pins were 
mixed together.
 
In addition to pushpin maps, investigators routinely 
used link charts to keep track of the people and places 
involved in a case, connecting index cards and photos 
with a maze of strings as relationships became established 
and details of an investigation emerged. Th e cumbersome 
pin maps and link charts have since given way to comput-
erized crime maps and crime analysis programs. Crime 
mapping changes the focus from the criminal to the loca-
tion of crimes—the hot spots where most crimes occur 
(Figure 1.2).
 
According to the National Institute of Justice (“NIJ 
Crime Mapping Resources,” 2007), “Th e ability to visualize 
how crime is distributed across the landscape (i.e., crime 
mapping) gives analysts and policymakers a graphic rep-
resentation of crime and its related issues. Simple maps 
help law enforcement leaders direct patrols to areas where 
they are most needed. Complex maps help policymakers 
and investigators observe trends and respond more intel-
ligently to changing issues. For example, detectives may 
use maps to understand the hunting patterns of serial 
criminals, determine where these oﬀ enders might live 
and identify their next likely target.”
 
Geographic information systems (GIS) and geographic 
proﬁ ling are other powerful tools for investigators: “Today 
the majority of law enforcement agencies use some degree 
of Geographic Information Systems/mapping technology 
to locate callers and provide ﬁ rst responders with critical 
information before arriving on the scene. . . . In recent 
years GIS has evolved to provide signiﬁ cantly more infor-
mation to improve safety and answer important questions 
during an emergency” (Wandrei, 2007, p.61).
 
GIS has moved beyond its traditional uses into the 
next trend in mapping technology: location intelligence 
(Donahue, 2007b, p.84). Donahue (2007a, p.32) explains, 
“Location intelligence solutions consist of a combination 
of software, data and expert services that help organiza-
tions leverage spatial capabilities without the need for 
a GIS expert.” Location intelligence includes automatic 
vehicle location (AVL) and global positioning systems 
(GPS). Th ree ways to implement AVL/GPS technology 
are (1) to place a unit inside or on a police vehicle, (2) to 
install a unit into a laptop computer or (3) to equip the 
oﬃ  cer’s portable radio with a built-in GPS transceiver 
(Brewer, 2007, p.46). Any of these applications enhance 
oﬃ  cer safety and increase the eﬃ  ciency of front line 
police (p.54).

22 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
 
Geographic proﬁ ling is yet another advancement in 
mapping and is based on the theory that all people, includ-
ing criminals, have a pattern to their lives. Th is pattern 
involves, among other things, a limited geographical area 
that encompasses the bulk of a person’s daily activities. 
According to the “least eﬀ ort” principle of human behav-
ior, people travel only as far as necessary to accomplish 
their goals, so the most likely area for a crime is where 
an oﬀ ender’s desire for anonymity intersects with the 
oﬀ ender’s desire to stay within his or her comfort zone.
 
In addition to location, computer programs can help 
investigators uncover patterns in the timing of criminal 
events. Unfortunately, time analysis methods have lagged 
behind spatial analysis techniques and have proved more 
diﬃ  cult to develop and implement thus far. Th e improve-
ment of technology and the corresponding expansion of 
information now accessible to investigators have created 
a new set of challenges.
DATA MINING
Although information is, indeed, the cornerstone of inves-
tigation, the plethora of information being generated can 
easily overwhelm an investigator. To be eﬀ ective, investi-
gators must know how to sift through the mountains of 
available information to ﬁ nd the data that pertain to their 
case, a process known as data mining. For example, data 
mining applied in a homicide case might allow investiga-
tors to more quickly develop a possible motive and thus 
expedite the identiﬁ cation of a suspect or help narrow the 
ﬁ eld of possible suspects. 
PROBLEM-ORIENTED POLICING
Problem-oriented policing (POP) can be deﬁ ned 
 as “a departmental-wide strategy aimed at solv-
ing persistent community problems. Police identify, ana-
lyze and respond to the underlying circumstances that 
create incidents” (Eck and Spelman, 1987). Goldstein 
explains problem-oriented policing like this:
Problem-oriented policing is an approach to policing in 
which discrete pieces of police business (each consist-
ing of a cluster of similar incidents, whether crime or 
acts of disorder, that the police are expected to handle) 
are subject to microscopic examination (drawing on 
the especially honed skills of crime analysts and the 
accumulated experience of operating ﬁ eld personnel) 
in hopes that what is freshly learned about each prob-
lem will lead to discovering a new and more eﬀ ective 
strategy for dealing with it. Problem-oriented policing 
places a high value on new responses that are preven-
tive in nature, that are not dependent on the use of the 
FIGURE 1.2
Computerized crime analysis programs 
have changed the focus of crime 
mapping from the criminal to the 
location of crimes—the hot spots where 
most crimes occur. This map shows 
several hot spots in San Antonio, Texas, 
where gang activity occurs more often.

criminal justice system, and that engage other public 
agencies, the community and the private sector when 
their involvement has the potential for signiﬁ cantly 
contributing to the reduction of the problem. Problem-
oriented policing carries a commitment to imple-
menting the new strategy, rigorously evaluating its 
eﬀ ectiveness, and, subsequently, reporting the results 
in ways that will beneﬁ t other police agencies and that 
will ultimately contribute to building a body of knowl-
edge that supports the further professionalization of 
the police. 
Data collected during criminal investigations can be 
 extremely valuable to the problem-oriented policing that 
many departments are adopting. Investigators can ana-
lyze data to determine groups of problems rather than 
isolated incidents. Once speciﬁ c underlying problems are 
identiﬁ ed, departments can seek alternative approaches 
to reduce or eliminate the incidence of particular crimes.
 
In addition, although criminal investigations are, by 
nature, reactive, they can use the technology just described 
to become proactive in solving crimes. Criminal investiga-
tions are mainly about solving crimes that have occurred. 
Unsolved crimes are problems that usually depend for a 
solution more on whether the victims and witnesses iden-
tify the oﬀ enders than on keen deductive reasoning or 
cutting-edge forensic analysis.
 
Th e subject of problem-solving policing is beyond the 
scope of this text, but problem-oriented strategies can be 
used in criminal investigations in many ways. One way 
is to expand collaborations by having investigators work 
more eﬀ ectively with patrol oﬃ  cers and with other law 
enforcement agencies. Another way is to improve the 
quality of information in existing data systems, especially 
MO ﬁ les. Th e likelihood that an oﬀ ender in a new case has 
been arrested previously (and should be in the MO ﬁ le) is 
greater than often thought. Combining problem-oriented 
strategies with traditional investigative techniques can 
help investigators improve their ability to solve crimes 
and to help prevent them as well.
INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCTIVITY
Productivity has been of interest in the police 
 ﬁ eld for some time. Major opposition to a 
focus on productivity in police work may arise because of 
alleged “quota systems” in issuing traﬃ  c citations. Pro-
ductivity involves considerably more than issuing cita-
tions, however. Nearly all jobs have some standard of 
productivity, even though the job may not involve a pro-
duction line.
 
A screening process to eliminate criminal investi-
gations with low potential for being solved can often 
increase productivity. Many police departments screen 
investigations with a form that asks speciﬁ c questions. If 
the answers to these questions are negative, the depart-
ment either gives the case low priority for assignment or 
does not assign it at all.
 
Criminal investigation personnel have traditionally 
been evaluated by the number and type of cases assigned 
to them, the number of cases they bring to a successful 
conclusion, and the number of arrests they make and 
the amount of property they recover. Th e evaluations 
should also assess how well the oﬃ  cers use investiga-
tive resources spacing and how well they perform overall 
within the department and in the community.
 
An advantage of continuous evaluation of produc-
tivity is that updating case status is possible at any time. 
Such information is useful not only for investigating 
but also for developing budgets, making additional case 
assignments, identifying MO similarities among cases 
and responding to public inquiries.
THE INVESTIGATIVE 
FUNCTION: THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL 
POLICE PERSONNEL
Early police organizations were one-unit/
 one-purpose departments with everyone per-
forming generalized functions. However, over time, de -
part   ments perceived a need for specialization. Th e ﬁ rst 
detective bureaus in the United States were established in 
Detroit in 1866 and in New York in 1882. Investigation 
became specialized because of 
• • Th e need to know about criminals and their MOs.
• • Th e amount of training necessary for learning and 
developing investigative techniques.
• • Th e frequency with which investigators had to 
leave their assigned shifts and areas during an 
investigation.
• • Patrol forces’ heavy workloads.
• • A general administrative philosophy that supported 
specialization as a means of increasing eﬃ  ciency and 
therefore solving more crimes.
 
In larger police departments, specialization developed 
ﬁ rst in investigative functions before it did in other areas 

24 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
such as traﬃ  c, crime prevention, juveniles and community 
relations. In departments with specialized investigative 
units, the investigative and patrol functions often experi-
enced diﬃ  culty separating their respective duties. Duties 
often overlapped, decreasing eﬃ  cient coordination.
 
Many of these diﬃ  culties have been overcome, but 
many others remain. Regardless of whether departments 
have specialists or generalists, their goal is the same: solv-
ing crimes.
The ultimate responsibility for solving crimes lies 
with all police personnel. It must be a cooperative, 
coordinated departmental effort.
 
All levels of police administration and operations 
contribute to successful investigations. Administrative 
decisions aﬀ ect the selection and assignment of person-
nel as well as the policies regulating their performance.
 
In most larger departments, the investigative division 
remains a separate unit under its own command and super-
visory personnel. Th e oﬃ  cer in charge reports directly to 
the chief of police or a chief of operations. Department 
policy speciﬁ es the roles of and the relationships among 
the administrative, uniformed patrol and investigative 
divisions. When these roles are clearly deﬁ ned, the depart-
ment can better achieve its common goals, with the inves-
tigative division fulﬁ lling its assigned responsibilities in 
coordination with all other departments.
 
Today, however, researchers are studying the extent 
to which specialization should remain, its eﬀ ectiveness, 
the number of personnel that should be assigned to spe-
cialized investigative functions and the selection and 
training required for such specialization. Th e following 
factors appear to support the training of all oﬃ  cers to 
perform investigative duties:
• • Increasing competition for tax monies
• • Possession of highly sophisticated equipment by some 
criminals
• • More criminals using multiple MOs
• • “Withdrawal syndrome” within the general public (i.e., 
the desire to remain uninvolved necessitates special-
ized training in interviewing techniques)
• • Overwhelming workload of cases assigned to investi-
gative personnel
• • More intelligent, better-educated police recruits
• • More police training available
 
In addition, most police oﬃ  cers’ daily activities are 
investigative, even though the matters they investigate 
may not involve crimes. Th erefore, the trend is for a few 
specialists to direct an investigation and for all oﬃ  cers to 
assume a more active role in investigating crimes. Th is role 
gives patrol oﬃ  cers more responsibility when respond-
ing to a call to proceed to a crime scene. It also enables 
them to conduct as much of the follow-up investigation as 
their shift and assigned areas of patrol permit. Th e impor-
tance of the patrol oﬃ  cer’s investigative role cannot be 
overemphasized.
 
Traditionally, uniformed patrol has been considered 
the backbone of the police department and has been 
Successful investigations often depend 
on information provided by victims 
and witnesses. These statements 
are typically taken by the ofﬁ cer ﬁ rst 
responding to the crime scene.

responsible for the initial response to a crime. Because 
they are the ﬁ rst to arrive, patrol oﬃ  cers are in an ideal 
position to do more than conduct the preliminary investi-
gation. Experiments have shown that initial investigations 
by patrol oﬃ  cers can be as eﬀ ective as those conducted by 
specialists. Th is is partly because the oﬃ  cers deal with the 
entire case.
 
Th is new challenge for patrol oﬃ  cers—involvement 
in the entire investigative process—creates interest in 
crime prevention as well as investigation. In addition, giv-
ing patrol oﬃ  cers increased responsibility for investigat-
ing crimes frees detectives to concentrate on oﬀ enses that 
require detailed investigations as well as on cases that 
require them to leave the community to conduct special 
interviews or to pursue leads. Th e result is better inves-
tigation by the patrol oﬃ  cer of the more frequent, less 
severe crimes.
INTERRELATIONSHIPS WITH 
OTHERS—COMMUNITY 
POLICING
Investigators do not work in a vacuum but rely 
 heavily on assistance from numerous other 
individuals and agencies. Th ey can beneﬁ t greatly from 
the trend toward departments adopting a community 
policing philosophy. In 1829 in England, Sir Robert Peel 
stated, “Th e police are the public and the public are the 
police.” Scholars have pointed to this philosophy as the 
modern-day roots of community policing. Miller and Hess 
(2008, p.xvii) note, “Community policing . . . is a philoso-
phy, a belief that working together, the police and the 
community can accomplish what neither can accomplish 
alone. Th e synergy that results from community policing 
can be powerful. It is like the power of a ﬁ nely tuned ath-
letic team, with each member contributing to the total 
eﬀ ort.” According to the Community Oriented Policing 
Services (COPS) Oﬃ  ce, 
Community policing is a philosophy that promotes 
organizational strategies, which support the systematic 
use of partnerships and problem solving techniques, to 
proactively address the immediate conditions that give 
rise to public safety issues, such as crime, social disor-
der, and fear of crime. . . . Community policing is often 
misunderstood as a program or set of programs. . . . 
Although programs may be incorporated as part of a 
broader strategic community policing plan, these pro-
grams are not community policing. Rather, community 
policing is an overarching philosophy that informs 
all aspects of police business  (“Community Policing 
Deﬁ ned,” 2008, p.1).
Using a community policing orientation, investigators 
interrelate with uniformed patrol ofﬁ cers, dispatchers, 
the prosecutor’s staff, the defense counsel, supervisors, 
physicians, the coroner or medical examiner, laborato-
ries and citizens, including witnesses and victims.
UNIFORMED PATROL
Patrol oﬃ  cers are a vital part of the investigative pro-
cess because they are usually the ﬁ rst to arrive at a crime 
scene. What patrol oﬃ  cers do or fail to do at the scene 
greatly inﬂ uences the outcome of an investigation. Th e 
patrol oﬃ  cer, as the person daily in the ﬁ eld, is closest to 
potential crime and has probably developed contacts who 
can provide information.
 
A potential pitfall is lack of direct, personal commu-
nication between uniformed and investigative personnel, 
which can result in attitudinal diﬀ erences and divisiveness. 
Communication problems can be substantially reduced by 
using a simple checklist describing the current investiga-
tive status of any cases jointly involving patrol and inves-
tigators. Th e form should include information such as that 
illustrated in Figure 1.3.
 
Patrol oﬃ  cers want to know what happens to the 
cases they begin. Oﬃ  cers who have been informed of the 
status of “their” cases report a feeling of work satisfaction 
not previously realized, increased rapport with investiga-
tive personnel and a greater desire to make good initial 
reports on future cases.
DISPATCHERS
In most cases, a police dispatcher is the initial contact 
between a citizen and a police agency. Most citizens call 
a police agency only a few times during their lives, and 
their permanent impression of the police may hinge on 
this contact and the citizens’ perceptions of the police 
agency’s subsequent actions.
 
In addition, the information obtained by the dispatcher 
is often critical to the oﬃ  cer, the victim, other citizens and 
the success of the investigation. Th e accuracy of the infor-
mation dispatched to the ﬁ eld oﬃ  cer or investigator may 
determine the success or failure of the case. Th e responding 
oﬃ  cer needs to know the exact nature and location of the 
incident. A direct radio, computer or phone line should be 
cleared until the oﬃ  cer arrives at the scene. All pertinent 

26 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
descriptions and information should be dispatched directly 
to the responding oﬃ  cer.
 
As with working relationships with the media, the rela-
tionship between the police and dispatchers is not always 
positive: “Th ere is no better example of a ‘love-hate rela-
tionship’ than the daily interaction between street cops and 
dispatchers. When things are going well, we love each other; 
when they’re not, tempers ﬂ are, attitudes take a nosedive 
and we temporarily hate each other” (Branter-Smith, 2007). 
One reason for the discord is that dispatchers spend their 
shift responding to crisis after crisis and rarely get to hear 
the outcome. Oﬃ  cers should be sensitive to this situation 
(Branter-Smith, 2007). Dispatchers constantly deal with 
rage, fear and helplessness but must diﬀ use these elevated 
emotions while enhancing the caller’s functionality and 
ability to answer questions or receive instructions (Bumpas, 
2006, p.20). Dispatchers are sometimes the lifeline for vic-
tims requiring assistance and the oﬃ  cers responding to a 
crime. Good working relationships with these individu-
als can go a long way in eﬀ ectively responding to a crime 
scene. 
PROSECUTOR’S STAFF
Another group of individuals with whom good working 
relationships are a necessity are prosecutors. Coopera-
tion between investigators and the prosecutor’s staﬀ  
depends on the personalities involved, the time avail-
able, a recognition that it is in everyone’s best interest 
to work together and an acceptance of everyone’s inves-
tigative roles and responsibilities. Given suﬃ  cient time 
and a willingness to work together, better investigations 
and prosecutions result. When investigators have con-
cluded an investigation, they should seek the advice of 
the prosecutor’s oﬃ  ce. At this point, the case may be 
prosecuted, new leads may be developed or the case may 
be dropped, with both the investigator and the prosecu-
tor’s oﬃ  ce agreeing that it would be ineﬃ  cient to pursue 
it further.
 
Th e prosecutor’s staﬀ  can give legal advice on state-
ments, confessions, evidence, the search and necessary 
legal papers and may provide new perspectives on the 
facts in the case. Th e prosecutor’s oﬃ  ce can review inves-
tigative reports and evidence that relates to the elements 
of the oﬀ ense, advise whether the proof is suﬃ  cient to 
proceed and assist in further case preparation. Th e role 
of the prosecutor in investigations is discussed further 
in Chapter 21.
DEFENSE COUNSEL
Our legal system is based on the adversary system: 
the accused against the accuser. Although both sides 
seek the same goal—determining truth and obtaining 
justice—the adversarial nature of the system requires 
that contacts between the defense counsel and inves-
tigators occur only on the advice of the prosecutor’s 
oﬃ  ce. Inquiries from the defense counsel should be 
referred to the prosecutor’s oﬃ  ce. If the court orders 
speciﬁ c documents to be provided to the defense coun-
sel, investigators must surrender the material, but they 
should seek the advice of the prosecution staﬀ  before 
releasing any documents or information. Th e role of 
the defense counsel is also discussed in greater depth 
in Chapter 21.
PHYSICIANS, CORONERS AND MEDICAL 
EXAMINERS 
If a victim at a crime scene is obviously injured and a doctor 
is called to the scene, saving life takes precedence over all 
aspects of the investigation. However, the physician is there

for emergency treatment, not to protect the crime scene, so 
investigators must take every possible precaution to protect 
the scene during the treatment of the victim.
 
Physicians and medical personnel should be directed 
to the victim by the route through the crime scene that 
is least destructive of evidence. Th ey should be asked to 
listen carefully to anything the victim says and to hold all 
clothing as evidence for the police.
 
Th e coroner or medical examiner is called if the victim 
has died. Coroners or medical examiners have the author-
ity to investigate deaths to determine whether they were 
natural, accidental or the result of a criminal act. Th ey can 
also provide information about the time of death and the 
type of weapon that might have caused it.
 
About 2,000 medical examiners and coroners’ 
(ME/C) oﬃ  ces provided death investigation services 
across the United States in 2004 (Hickman, Hughes, 
Strom and Ropero-Miller, 2007, p.1). Th ese oﬃ  cers are 
responsible for the medicolegal investigation of deaths. 
Th ey may conduct death scene investigations, perform 
autopsies and determine the cause and manner of death 
when a person has died as a result of violence, under 
suspicious circumstances, without a physician in atten-
dance or for other reasons. In a typical year, ME/C oﬃ  ces 
handle about 4,400 unidentiﬁ ed human decedents, 
of which about 1,000 remain unidentiﬁ ed longer than 
1 year. Nearly 1 million human death cases were referred 
in 2004, of which about 500,000 were accepted. Depend-
ing on the individual case, investigators and the ME/C 
may work as a team, with an investigator present at the 
autopsy. Th e ME/C may obtain samples of hair, cloth-
ing, ﬁ bers, blood and body organs or ﬂ uids as needed for 
later laboratory examination.
FORENSIC CRIME LABORATORIES
Many criminal investigations involve the processing of 
physical evidence through a crime lab. All law enforce-
ment agencies now have access to highly sophisticated 
criminalistic examinations through local, state, federal 
and private laboratories. 
 
Th e state crime laboratory is usually located either in 
the state’s largest city or in the state capital and can be 
used by all police agencies of the state. Th e FBI Laboratory 
in Washington, DC, is also available to all federal, state 
and local law enforcement agencies, with personnel avail-
able to provide forensic examinations, technical support, 
expert witness testimony and training.
 
Th e National Institute of Justice (Increasing Eﬃ  ciency 
in Crime Laboratories, 2008, p.1) reports, “Television has 
given forensic science great public visibility, but provides 
viewers with the mistaken notion that crime laboratories 
provide results quickly. In truth, most crime laboratories 
have large case backlogs.” “Justice Delayed” also reports 
that resources available for crime labs have not kept pace 
with the demands of police departments and prosecutors: 
“Long backlogs for analysis of DNA, ﬁ ngerprints, ﬁ bers, 
drugs and other types of forensic evidence are the rule at 
publicly funded crime labs around the country.” For exam-
ple, the L.A. Police Department had nearly 7,000 untested 
DNA samples from sexual assault cases in cold storage 
in 2007 (Shapiro, 2007). “Th e backlogs have contributed 
to occasional miscarriages of justice, including probably 
guilty suspects who walk free and others, wrongly charged, 
who languish in jail for want of timely forensic analysis” 
(“Justice Delayed,” 2007, p.A18). 
CITIZENS
Investigators are only as good as their sources of informa-
tion. Th ey seldom solve crimes without citizen assistance. 
In fact, citizens frequently provide the most important 
information in a case. Witnesses to a crime should be con-
tacted immediately to minimize their time involved and 
inconvenience. Information about the general progress 
of the case should be relayed to those who have assisted. 
Th is will maintain their interest and increase their desire 
to cooperate at another time.
 
Citizens can help or hinder an investigation. Fre-
quently, citizens who have been arrested in the past have 
information about crimes and the people who commit 
them. Th e manner and attitude with which such citizens 
are contacted will increase or decrease their cooperation 
with the police, as discussed in Chapter 6.
WITNESSES
Witnesses are often the key to solving crimes. Th ey can 
provide eyewitness accounts, or they can provide leads 
that would be otherwise unavailable. However, such testi-
mony is often unreliable: “Nationwide, misidentiﬁ cation 
by witnesses led to wrongful convictions in 75 percent of 
the 207 instances in which prisoners have been exoner-
ated over the last decade” (Moore, 2007). Maryland, North 
Carolina, Vermont and West Virginia passed legislation in 
2007 creating tougher standards for identifying suspects 
by witnesses, which is often called “one of the most trou-
ble-ridden procedures” in an investigation (Moore). 
 
Despite criticism and controversy regarding the value 
of eyewitness testimony, judges and juries accord signiﬁ -
cant weight to eyewitness evidence.
 
Key witnesses should be kept informed of the prog-
ress of the case and of their role in the prosecution, if any. 
If they are to be called to testify in court, their testimony 
should be reviewed with them, and they should be given 

28 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
assurances that their participation is important in achiev-
ing justice. Police oﬃ  cers must be aware of the problem 
of witness intimidation, which is described as “pervasive 
and increasing” (Dedel, 2006). Th e consequences of such 
intimidation go beyond losing individual cases: “Witness 
intimidation lowers public conﬁ dence in the criminal jus-
tice system and creates the perception that the system 
cannot protect the citizenry” (Dedel). Such intimidation 
can also be directed at victims of crime.
VICTIMS
Almost every crime has a victim. According to the National 
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), U.S. residents age 12 
or older experienced an estimated 23 million violent and 
property victimizations in 2005 (Catalano, 2006, p.1). 
Jordan, Romashkan and Werner  (2007, p.44) contend, 
“Th e law enforcement community has historically focused 
on the apprehension and prosecution of perpetrators, and 
although state laws deﬁ ne the rights and redress of victims 
of crime—such as the right to be treated with fairness, 
dignity, and respect; to be informed and present through-
out the entire criminal justice process; to be reasonably 
protected from the accused; and to be entitled to seek 
restitution—these individuals are very often neglected in 
the criminal justice system.”
 
Even so-called victimless crimes often have innocent 
victims who are not directly involved in a speciﬁ c inci-
dent. Th e victim is often the reporting person (complain-
ant) and often has the most valuable information. Yet, in 
many instances, the victim receives the least attention 
and assistance.
 
Police should keep victims informed of investiga-
tive progress unless releasing the information would 
jeopardize prosecuting the case or unless the informa-
tion is confidential. The Federal Victimization Bill pro-
vides matching-fund assistance to states for victims of 
some crimes. Numerous states also have victimization 
funds that can be used for funeral or other expenses 
according to predetermined criteria. Police agencies 
should maintain a list of federal, state and local agen-
cies; foundations; and support groups that provide 
assistance to victims. Police should tell victims how 
to contact community support groups. For example, 
most communities have support groups for victims of 
sexual offenses—if not locally, then at the county or 
state level.
 
In larger departments, psychological response teams 
are available. In smaller agencies, a chaplains’ corps or 
clergy from the community may assist with death notiﬁ -
cations and the immediate needs of victims.
 
Investigating oﬃ  cers should also give victims infor-
mation on future crime prevention techniques and tem-
porary safety precautions. Th ey should help victims 
understand any court procedures that involve them. Oﬃ  -
cers should tell victims whether local counseling services 
are available and whether there is a safe place they can 
stay if this is an immediate concern.
 
Unfortunately, although millions of people in the 
United States are victimized every year, only a small 
percentage of these victims and family members obtain 
the services they need to manage the stress that devel-
ops when falling victim to crime (Oetinger, 2007, p.40). 
Viverette (2006, p.6) stresses, “When we in law enforce-
ment treat crime victims with sensitivity and respect, 
their healing process starts sooner, and they are more 
likely to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of 
the crime. Responding eﬀ ectively and appropriately to all 
crime victims is not only the right thing to do but it is also 
in law enforcement’s best interests.” One important way 
to assist victims as well as witnesses is to prepare them to 
deal with the media.
WITNESSES, VICTIMS AND THE MEDIA
At any major crime scene or during any major criminal 
investigation, the media will be seeking all the human 
interest stories they can find. Their primary targets

will be victims and witnesses. In some instances, vic-
tims are taken by surprise when the media shows up 
without enough safeguards to protect their identity. 
And in some cases, victims inadvertently reveal infor-
mation being withheld to preserve the integrity of an 
investigation.
 
Some police departments have tried to protect the 
privacy of victims and witnesses by providing them with 
a card telling them how to deal with the media (Figure 
1.4). The back of the card lists telephone numbers for 
the public information office and the victim services 
section.
MAJOR-CASE TASK FORCES
Shrinking police budgets and the complications 
 of modern-day crime have resulted in task 
forces becoming necessary for many crimes involving 
drugs, gangs and terrorism. Combined federal, state 
and local task forces now exist for these and other 
crimes. In addition, “Task forces are critical when 
addressing multi-jurisdictional needs, investigating 
major cases impacting several agencies or when combat-
ing regional crime problems” (Boetig and Mattocks, 
2007, p.51).  
 
A multidisciplinary approach to case investigation uses 
specialists in various ﬁ elds from within a particular juris-
diction. A multijurisdictional investigation, in contrast, 
uses personnel from diﬀ erent police agencies. Many met-
ropolitan areas consist of 20 or more municipalities sur-
rounding a core city. In a number of metropolitan areas, 
multijurisdictional major-case squads or metro crime 
teams have been formed, drawing the most talented 
investigative personnel from all jurisdictions. In addition, 
the services of federal, state or county police agency per-
sonnel may be used.
 
Many agencies are developing special investiga-
tion units, focusing resources and training eﬀ orts on 
speciﬁ c local crime problems. Other areas commonly 
investigated by special units include drug traﬃ  cking 
and gaming enforcement. In some major cases—for 
example, homicides involving multijurisdictional prob-
lems, serial killers, police oﬃ  cer killings or multiple sex 
oﬀ enses—it is advisable to form a major-case task force 
from the jurisdictions that have vested interests in the 
case. All evidence from the joint case is normally sent 
to the same laboratory to maintain continuity and con-
sistency. Murphy, Wexler, Davies and Plotkin (2004, 
p.13) observe, “Local law enforcement have long been 
scrutinized for how they handle large-scale, complex 
criminal investigations—often those involving serial, 
spree or mass murderers or violence against national 
leaders or celebrities. Many of these notorious crimes 
were investigated within a task force structure, involv-
ing multiple agencies, jurisdiction or levels of govern-
ment. Th ese crimes shared a number of characteristics 
that called for complicated, demanding investigations 
that challenged the agencies tasked with solving them 
in unprecedented ways.”
  
In examining the lessons learned from the DC sniper 
investigation, Murphy et al. (2004, p.15) were able to 
identify some critical aspects of a successful investigation, 
including thorough planning and preparation, advanced 
role deﬁ nition and delineation of responsibilities, eﬃ  -
cient information management, and a focus on eﬀ ective 
communication.
 
On the federal level, the Violent Criminal Appre-
hension Program (VICAP) has been created within the 
FBI to study and coordinate investigation of crimes of 
interstate and national interest: “VICAP’s mission is 
to facilitate cooperation, communication and coordi-
nation among law enforcement agencies and provide 
support in their efforts to investigate, identify, track, 
apprehend and prosecute violent serial offenders” 
(Murphy et al., 2004, p.41).
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
RESOURCES
Investigators also have available several 
 resources at the federal level as well as at the 
global level.
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES
Federal law enforcement agencies can provide numer-
ous resources to aid local and state agencies involved in 
high-profile investigations. Federal agencies may have 
forensic experts that a local or state law enforcement 
agency does not employ in-house. The Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), FBI and 
Secret Service are available for such forensic expertise. 
Specialized response units, such as the FBI’s Critical 
Incident Response Group (CIRG), the Rapid Deploy-
ment Logistics Unit (RDLU) and the Hostage Rescue 
Team (HRT) are also accessible to local and state law 
enforcement. In addition, the National Center for the 
Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) Behavioral Analysis 

30 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
Unit (BAU) provides behavioral-based investigative and 
operational support: “BAU . . . provides assistance to 
law enforcement through ‘criminal investigative analy-
sis,’ a process of reviewing crimes from behavioral and 
investigative perspectives. BAU staff—commonly called 
profilers—assess the criminal act, interpret offender 
behavior and/or interact with the victim for the pur-
poses of providing crime analysis, investigative sugges-
tions, profiles of unknown offenders, threat analysis, 
critical incident analysis, interview strategies, major 
case management, search warrant assistance, prosecu-
tion and trial strategies, and expert testimony” (Mur-
phy et al., 2004, p.41).
  
Other federal resources available to investigators will 
be discussed throughout the remainder of the text.
INTERPOL
INTERPOL, whose correct full name is Th e International 
Criminal Police Organization (ICPO), has participated 
in disseminating information related to stolen or seized 
property since 1947. Information maintained in the 
INTERPOL computerized database is available to law 
enforcement agencies worldwide. 
 
Before concluding this overview of criminal inves-
tigation, it is worth briefly considering what can hap-
pen if investigators step outside their legal boundaries 
during an investigation. Some might think the worst-
case scenario is that the suspect walks, but that would 
be only part of the bad news. The other part: The 
investigator finds that the shoe is on the other foot, 
as he or she has now become the defendant in a civil 
liability suit. 
AVOIDING CIVIL LIABILITY
Civil liability refers to a person’s degree of risk 
 of being sued. Oﬃ  cers must face the unfortu-
nate reality that being sued goes with wearing the uni-
form: “In the past few years, police litigation has 
skyrocketed in terms of both the number of lawsuits and 
the amount of money needed to defend these lawsuits 
(and to pay out large verdicts when they occur)” (Ramirez, 
2006, p.52). Many aspects of police work (e.g., use of 
force, high-speed pursuits) leave oﬃ  cers and their depart-
ments vulnerable to possible lawsuits. Searches and 
arrests have the potential for lawsuits, as do failures to 
investigate or arrest. 
 
Most civil lawsuits brought against law enforce-
ment officers are based on Statute 42 of the U.S. Code, 
Section 1983, also called the Civil Rights Act. This act, 
passed in 1871, was designed to prevent the abuse of 
constitutional rights by officers who “under color of 
state law” denied defendants those rights and states, 
“Every person who, under color of any statute, ordi-
nance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or 
Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected any citi-
zen of the United States or other person within the 
jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, 
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitu-
tion and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an 
action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceed-
ing for redress.”
  
Basically, Section 1983 states that anyone who acts 
under the authority of law and who violates another 
person’s constitutional rights can be sued. Of particu-
lar relevance to criminal investigations are those con-
stitutional protections involving searches and seizures, 
interrogations and custody situations. 
 
Operations manuals and training are critically 
important in protecting departments against lawsuits 
(Cotton and Donlan-Cotton, 2007). Such manuals pro-
vide guidelines within which officers and investigators 
should operate. Manuals should be updated as case law 
changes and as new technologies become available.
 
Hess (2009, p.423) observes, “Investigative proce-
dure is [one] area of police work commonly brought up 
in lawsuits. Almost every investigation gives officers 
discretion to decide what evidence should be included in 
prosecutor reports and warrant applications, and what 
evidence should be omitted.” If investigators withhold 
exculpatory evidence, which is evidence favorable to 
the accused, the courts have deemed this to be a vio-
lation of a defendant’s due process rights: “Leaving 
out exculpatory evidence may lead to liability for false 
arrest, malicious prosecution, and illegal search and sei-
zure claims. To support such liability claims, a plaintiff 
must show that the affiant knowingly and deliberately, 
or with reckless disregard for the truth, omitted facts 
that are material or necessary to a finding of probable 
cause [Franks v. Delaware, 1978].”
 
One of the best ways to avoid lawsuits or to defend 
yourself if sued is to keep complete, accurate records of 
all official actions you take. Hess and Wrobleski (2006, 
p.467) offer suggestions to avoid lawsuits.

CHAPTER 1 | Criminal Investigation:  An Overview | 31
problems and liability risks in law enforcement like 
good interpersonal communication skills. We all know 
oﬃ  cers who can go in a biker bar, make an arrest and 
leave with a friend. Other oﬃ  cers could start a ﬁ ght in 
a Quaker Friends meeting.” Means notes, “Dealing with 
people can be complex and demanding, especially in law 
enforcement. But there are straightforward, guiding 
principles that, when applied, sharply improve odds of 
success and reduce both physical and legal risks.” Th ese 
interpersonal communication techniques are discussed 
in Chapter 6.
Protection against lawsuits includes
• • Effective policies and procedures clearly 
communicated to all.
• • Thorough and continuous training.
• • Proper supervision and discipline.
• • Accurate, thorough police reports.
 
Means (2007, p.33) oﬀ ers another suggestion for 
avoiding lawsuits: “Nothing whatsoever reduces legal 

32 | SECTION 1 | Introduction
A criminal investigation is the process of discovering, col-
lecting, preparing, identifying and presenting evidence 
to determine what happened and who is responsible. Th e 
goals of police investigation vary from department to 
department, but most investigations aim to
• • Determine whether a crime has been committed.
• • Legally obtain suﬃ  cient information and evidence to 
identify the responsible person.
• • Locate and arrest the suspect.
• • Recover stolen property.
• • Present the best possible case to the prosecutor.
 
Among the numerous functions performed by inves-
tigators are those of providing emergency assistance; 
securing the crime scene; photographing, videotaping 
and sketching; taking notes and writing reports; search-
ing for, obtaining and processing physical evidence; 
obtaining information from witnesses and suspects; 
identifying suspects; conducting raids, surveillances, 
stakeouts and undercover assignments; and testifying in 
court.
 
All investigators—whether patrol oﬃ  cers or 
 detectives—are more eﬀ ective when they possess 
certain intellectual, psychological and physical char-
acteristics. Eﬀ ective investigators obtain and retain 
information, apply technical knowledge and remain 
open-minded, objective, logical, and culturally adroit. 
Th ey are emotionally well balanced, detached, inquisi-
tive, suspecting, discerning, self-disciplined and per-
severing. Further, they are physically ﬁ t and have good 
vision and hearing.
 
The first officer to arrive at a crime scene is usually 
a patrol officer assigned to the area. In any preliminary 
investigation, it is critical to establish priorities. Emer-
gencies are handled first, and then the crime scene is 
secured. Any suspect at the scene should be detained, 
questioned and then either released or arrested, 
depending on circumstances. If a suspect has recently 
left the scene, general descriptions of the suspect, 
any vehicles, direction of travel and any items taken 
should be obtained and dispatched to headquarters 
immediately.
 
After emergencies are dealt with, the ﬁ rst and most 
important function is to protect the crime scene and evi-
dence. All necessary measures to secure the crime scene 
should be taken—including locking, roping, barricad-
ing and guarding—until the preliminary investigation is 
completed.
 
Once the scene is secured, the preliminary inves-
tigation is conducted, which includes questioning 
SUMMARY
victims, witnesses and suspects; conducting a neighbor-
hood canvass; measuring, photographing, videotaping 
and sketching the scene; searching for evidence; iden-
tifying, collecting, examining and processing physical 
evidence; and recording all statements and observa-
tions in notes. Res gestae statements are spontaneous 
statements made at the time of a crime, concerning and 
closely related to actions involved in the crime. They 
are often considered more truthful than later, planned 
responses. The crime scene is preserved through these 
records.
 
As soon as possible, oﬃ  cers should determine whether 
a crime has been committed by knowing the elements of 
each major oﬀ ense and the evidence that supports them 
and then ascertaining whether they are present. Oﬃ  cers 
should also try to determine when the event occurred.
 
Even in police departments that have highly special-
ized investigation departments, the ultimate responsibil-
ity for solving crimes lies with all police personnel. It must 
be a cooperative, coordinated departmental eﬀ ort. Coop-
eration and coordination of eﬀ orts are also required out-
side the police department. Investigators must interrelate 
with uniformed patrol oﬃ  cers, dispatchers, the prosecu-
tor’s staﬀ , the defense counsel, supervisors, physicians, 
the coroner or medical examiner, laboratories and citi-
zens, including victims. Criminal investigation is, indeed, 
a mutual eﬀ ort.
 
Protection against lawsuits includes (1) eﬀ ective poli-
cies and procedures clearly communicated to all, (2) thor-
ough and continuous training, (3) proper supervision and 
discipline and (4) accurate, thorough police reports.

or do we always expect the experts and the specialists to 
“ﬁ gure it out“?
 
Essentially, how well do our front-line patrol inves-
tigators, detectives and sergeants execute the funda-
mentals of high-quality police work at the scene of a 
crime? As Coach Wooden taught us so many years ago, 
you don’t get to cut the net down after the ﬁ nal game if 
you don’t understand the most basic fundamentals of 
the game and perform them consistently well. So it is 
with front-line police work.
 
The basic investigative techniques introduced in 
Chapter 1 are central to the successful resolution of a 
crime. Investigators must be skilled in documenting the

Basics.” Law Enforcement News, March 31, 1999, p.8.

s Berg1 points out, “Police can learn a few 
  lessons from legendary basketball coach 
John Wooden,” who believed that constantly practic-
ing, mastering and executing the basics were the keys 
to a team’s success. Berg contends,
Ofﬁ cers, detectives, and sergeants should constantly 
evaluate their fundamentals. Are reported crimes being 
thoroughly investigated or merely reported? Are neigh-
borhoods being canvassed for that one witness who may 
give us the little piece of information we need to identify 
the suspect? Have we searched thoroughly for evidence, 
including ﬁ ngerprints, and have we protected evidence 
and gathered it in an expert manner? Are we completing 
well written reports that contain all of the information that 
will make a subsequent follow-up successful? Are we 
doing a comprehensive job investigating at a crime scene 

crime scene and any continuing investigation, includ-
ing taking notes and photographs or videotaping and 
sketching (Chapter 2), and then casting this informa-
tion into an effective report (Chapter 3). Investigators 
must also be skilled in searching (Chapter 4); obtaining 
and processing physical evidence (Chapter 5); obtain-
ing information through interviews and interrogation 
(Chapter 6); and identifying and arresting suspects and 
conducting raids, surveillances, stakeouts and under-
cover assignments (Chapter 7).
 
Although these techniques are discussed sepa-
rately, they actually overlap and often occur simultane-
ously. For example, note taking occurs at almost every 
phase of the investigation, as does obtaining informa-
tion. Further, the techniques require modiﬁ cation to suit 
speciﬁ c crimes, as discussed in Sections 3, 4 and 5. 
Nonetheless, investigation of speciﬁ c crimes must pro-
ceed from a base of signiﬁ cant responsibilities appli-
cable to most investigations. This section provides that 
base.

ocumentation is vital throughout an investigation. Most people who go 
into law enforcement are amazed at the amount of paperwork and writing 
that is required—as much as 70 percent of an investigator’s job is consumed by 
these functions. In addition, photography plays an important role in documenting 
evidence and presenting cases in court. Some larger departments have a 
photographic unit. Other departments rely on their investigators to perform this 
function. Often both photographs and sketches must accompany written notes to 
provide a clear picture of the crime scene.

FIELD NOTES: THE BASICS
Note taking is not unique to the police profes-
sion. News reporters take notes to prepare 
stories; physicians record information furnished by 
patients to follow the progress of a case; lawyers and 
judges take notes to assist in interviewing witnesses and 
making decisions; students take notes in class and as they 
read. Quite simply, notes are brief records of what is seen 
or heard.
Investigative notes are a permanent written record of 
the facts of a case to be used in further investigation, in 
writing reports and in prosecuting the case.
 
Note taking and report writing are often regarded as 
unpleasant, boring tasks. Yet no duty is more important, 
as many oﬃ  cers have found, much to their embarrass-
ment, when they did not take notes or took incomplete 
notes. Detailed notes can make or break a case. For 
example, when a defense attorney challenges in court 
the reliability or validity of various breath or blood mea-
surements of alcohol content, the case often hinges on 
the thoroughness of an oﬃ  cer’s written report. Accurate 
notes aid later recall and are used for preparing sketches 
and reports. Notes are important throughout an entire 
investigation.
WHEN TO TAKE NOTES
Start taking notes as soon as possible after receiving a 
call to respond and continue recording information as it 
is received throughout the investigation.
 
Sometimes it is physically impossible to take notes 
immediately—for example, while driving a vehicle or in 
complete darkness. At other times, taking notes immedi-
ately could hinder obtaining information if it intimidates 
a witness or suspect. Whether to take out a notebook 
immediately in the presence of a person being questioned 
is a matter of personal insight and experience.
 
When people are excited, want to get their name in 
the newspaper or want to get your attention, you can 
usually record information immediately. Most people are 
willing to give information if you are friendly and courte-
ous and you explain the importance of the information. In 
such cases, no delay in taking notes is required.
 
On the other hand, reluctant witnesses and suspects 
may not talk if you record what they say. In such cases, 
obtain the information ﬁ rst and record it later. You must 
sense when it is best to delay writing notes. Speciﬁ c meth-
ods of obtaining information from willing and unwilling 
people are discussed in Chapter 6.
 
If someone gives you an exact wording of what was 
said by a person committing a crime, have the witness 
initial that portion of your notes after reading it to help 
ensure its accuracy. If possible, have people who give you

information regarding crimes committed

CHAPTER 2 | Documenting the Crime Scene: Note Taking, Photographing and Sketching | 41
information take time to write a statement in their own 
handwriting. Th is avoids the possibility that they may 
later claim that they did not make the statement or were 
misunderstood or misquoted.
WHAT TO RECORD
Enter general information ﬁ rst: the time and date of 
the call, location, oﬃ  cer assigned and arrival time at the 
scene. Police departments using centrally dispatched mes-
sage centers may automatically record date, time and case 
numbers. Even if this is done, make written notes of this 
initial information because recorded tapes may not be 
kept for extended periods or may become unusable. Th e 
tapes and notes corroborate each other.
Record all information that helps to answer the questions 
Who? What? Where? When? How? and Why?
 
As you take notes, ask yourself speciﬁ c questions such 
as these:
• • When: did the incident happen? was it discovered? 
was it reported? did the police arrive on the scene? 
were suspects arrested? will the case be heard in 
court?
• • Where: did the incident happen? was evidence found? 
stored? do victims, witnesses and suspects live? do 
suspects frequent most often? were suspects arrested?
• • Who: are suspects? accomplices? Complete descrip-
tions include gender, race, coloring, age, height, 
weight, hair (color, style, condition), eyes (color, size, 
glasses), nose (size, shape), ears (close to head or pro-
truding), distinctive features (birthmarks, tattoos, 
scars, beard), clothing, voice (high or low, accent) and 
other distinctive characteristics such as walk.
• • Who: were the victims? associates? was talked to? 
were witnesses? saw or heard something of impor-
tance? discovered the crime? reported the incident? 
made the complaint? investigated the incident? 
worked on the case? marked and received evidence? 
was notiﬁ ed? had a motive?
• • What: type of crime was committed? was the amount 
of damage or value of the property involved? hap-
pened (narrative of the actions of suspects, victims 
and witnesses; combines information included under 
“How”)? evidence was found? preventive measures 
had been taken (safes, locks, alarms, etc.)? knowledge, 
skill or strength was needed to commit the crime? was 
said? did the police oﬃ  cers do? further information is 
needed? further action is needed?
• • How: was the crime discovered? does this crime relate 
to other crimes? did the crime occur? was evidence 
found? was information obtained?
• • Why: was the crime committed (was there intent? 
consent? motive?)? was certain property stolen? was a 
particular time selected?
 
Make notes that describe the physical scene, includ-
ing general weather and lighting conditions. Witnesses 
may testify to observations that would have been impos-
sible given the existing weather or lighting. Accurate 
notes on such conditions will refute false or incorrect 
testimony.
 
Record everything you observe in the overall scene: 
all services rendered, including ﬁ rst aid, description of 
the injured, location of wounds, who transported the 
victim and how. Record complete and accurate informa-
tion regarding all photographs taken at the scene. As the 
search is conducted, record the location and description 
of evidence and its preservation. Record information 
to identify the type of crime and what was said and by 
whom. Include the name, address and phone number of 
every person present at the scene and all witnesses.
 
Th e amount of notes taken depends on the type of 
oﬀ ense, the conditions of the case, your attitude and abil-
ity and the number of other oﬃ  cers assigned to the case. 
Make sure you take enough notes to completely describe 
what you observe and do during an investigation. Th is will 
provide a solid foundation for a detailed report and for 
court testimony. If in doubt about whether to include a 
speciﬁ c detail, record it. As noted in the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI)’s Handbook of Forensic Services (2007, 
p.178): “Nothing is insigniﬁ cant to record if it catches 
one’s attention.” Take notes on everything you do in an 
oﬃ  cial investigative capacity. Record all facts, regardless 
of where they may lead. Information establishing a sus-
pect’s innocence is as important as that establishing guilt:
Very few cases are of the open-and-shut variety. In 
most cases, there will be some evidence pointing to the 
suspect’s guilt (“inculpatory”) and other evidence that 
appears inconsistent with the suspect’s guilt (“exculpa-
tory”). For example, two witnesses might identify the 
suspect as the perpetrator of the crime, while a third 
insists that the suspect is not the one; a victim might 
make a positive ID of a suspected robber who neverthe-
less has an alibi based on a time clock at his job. When 
such evidentiary conﬂ icts exist, the general rule is that 
all of the evidence, both inculpatory and exculpatory 
should be reported to the prosecutor for evaluation. 
(Rutledge, 2007, p.68)
Th is begins with including such information in the notes 
about a case.

42 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
HOW TO TAKE NOTES
Note taking is an acquired skill. Time does not permit a 
verbatim transcript. Learn to select key facts and record 
them in abbreviated form.
Write brief, legible, abbreviated notes that others can 
understand.
 
Do not include words such as a, and and the in your 
notes. Omit all other unnecessary words. For example, 
if a witness said, “I arrived here after having lunch at 
Harry’s Cafe, a delightful little place over on the west 
side, at about 1:30, and I found my boss had been shot,” 
you would record: “Witness arrived scene 1:30 (after 
lunch at Harry’s Cafe) to find boss shot.” You would 
not know at the time if the fact that she had lunch at 
Harry’s Cafe was important, but it might be, so you 
would include it.
 
Write or print legibly, especially when recording 
names, addresses, telephone numbers, license numbers, 
distances and other speciﬁ c facts. If you make an error, 
cross it out, make the correction and initial it. Do not 
erase. Whether intentional or accidental, erasures raise 
credibility questions.
 
Whenever possible, use standard abbreviations such 
as mph, DWI, Ave. Do not, however, devise your own short-
hand. For example, if you wrote, “Body removed by A. K.,” 
the initials A. K. would be meaningless to others. If you 
become ill, injured or deceased, others must be able to read 
and understand your notes. Th is is necessary to further 
the investigation, even though some question regarding 
admissibility in court may arise.
Using a Tape Recorder Some police departments use 
tape recorders extensively because of the deﬁ nite advan-
tage of recording exactly what was stated with no danger 
of misinterpreting, slanting or misquoting. However, 
tape recorders do not replace the notebook. Despite 
their advantages, they also have serious disadvantages. 
Th e most serious is that they can malfunction and fail 
to record valuable information. Weak batteries or back-
ground noise can also distort the information recorded. 
In addition, transcribing tapes is time consuming, expen-
sive and subject to error. Finally, the tapes themselves, 
not the transcription, are the original evidence and thus 
must be retained and ﬁ led.
 
If information is taped, check the recorder before 
using it, record the appropriate heading before beginning 
the questioning and always play the tape back to ensure 
that the information is recorded satisfactorily. Supple-
ment the tape with notes of the key points.
 
Do not jot down information unrelated to the 
investigation—for example, the phone number of a 
friend, an idea for a poem or a doodle. If the defense 
attorney, judge or jury sees your notes, such irrelevant 
material will reflect poorly on your professionalism.
WHERE TO RECORD NOTES
Use a notebook to record all facts observed and learned 
during an investigation. Despite the availability of sophis-
ticated recorders and computers, the notebook remains 
one of the simplest, most economical and most basic 
investigative tools. Notes taken on scraps of paper, on the 
backs of envelopes or on napkins are apt to be lost, and 
they reﬂ ect poorly on an oﬃ  cer’s professionalism.
 
Divide the notebook into sections for easy reference. 
One section might contain frequently used telephone num-
bers. Another section might contain frequently needed 
addresses. Th is information can be a permanent part of 
the notebook. Identify the notebook with your name, 
address and telephone number, as well as the address and 
telephone number of your police department.
 
Opinions vary about whether it is better to use a 
loose-leaf notebook or separate spiral-bound notebooks 
for each case. If you use a loose-leaf notebook, you can 
easily add paper for each case you are working on as the 
need arises, and you can keep it well organized. Most 
investigators favor the loose-leaf notebook because of its 
ﬂ exibility in arranging notes for reports and for testifying 
in court. However, use of a loose-leaf notebook opens the 
opportunity of challenge from the defense attorney that 
the oﬃ  cer has fabricated the notes, adding or deleting 
relevant pages. Th is can be countered by numbering each 
page, followed by the date and case number or by using a 
separate spiral notebook for each case.
 
Disadvantages of the latter approach are that the 
spiral notebook is often only partially used and therefore 
expensive and may be bulky for storage. Further, if other 
notes are kept in the same notebook, they also will be sub-
ject to the scrutiny of the defense. A ﬁ nal disadvantage is 
that if you need a blank sheet of paper for some reason, 
you should not take it from a spiral notebook because 
most of these notebooks indicate on the cover how many 
pages they contain. Th e defense can only conjecture about 
loose-leaf pages that might have been removed, but miss-
ing pages from a spiral notebook can be construed as evi-
dence that something has been removed.
 
Th e decision to use a loose-leaf or spiral-bound note-
book is sometimes a matter of department policy. In addi-
tion to the notebook, always carry pens and pencils. Use 
a pen for most notes because ink is permanent. You may 
want to use pencil for rough sketches that require minor 
corrections as you sketch.

CHAPTER 2 | Documenting the Crime Scene: Note Taking, Photographing and Sketching | 43
 
Eﬀ ective notes are also well organized. Make entries 
from each case on separate pages and number the pages. 
Keep the pages for each case together and record the case 
number on each page.
FILING NOTES
Some oﬃ  cers destroy all their ﬁ eld notes after 
they have written their reports. Th ey believe 
that notes simply duplicate what is in the report and may 
in fact contain information no longer pertinent when the 
report is written. Some police departments also have this 
as a policy.
 
If department policy is to keep the notes, place them 
in a location and under a ﬁ ling system that makes them 
available months or even years later. Department policy 
usually determines where and how notes are ﬁ led.
If notes are retained, ﬁ le them in a secure location 
 readily accessible to investigators.
 
Store notes in an oﬃ  cial police department case ﬁ le 
or any secure location where they are available on short 
demand. Some departments ﬁ le notes with the original 
ﬁ le in the oﬃ  cial records department. Others permit an 
oﬃ  cer to keep the original notes and ﬁ le only the report 
made from the notes. Wherever notes are ﬁ led, they must 
be secure.
 
No one ﬁ ling system is best. Notes may be ﬁ led 
alphabetically by the victim’s name, by case number or 
in chronological order. As long as the system is logical, 
the notes will be retrievable. Appeals have been granted 
as long as 20 years after convictions, with the defendant 
being granted a new trial. Because of this, many oﬃ  cers 
retain their notes indeﬁ nitely.
ADMISSIBILITY OF NOTES IN COURT
Th e use of notes in court is probably their most important 
legal application. Th ey can help discredit a suspect’s or a 
defense witness’s testimony; support evidence already 
given by a prosecution witness, strengthening that tes-
timony; and defend against false allegations by the sus-
pect or defense witnesses. Notes give you an advantage 
because others rarely make written notes and, therefore, 
must testify from memory.
 
All oﬃ  cers who are present at the scene while the 
notes are being taken and who witness the writing and 
initial the notes at that time may use the notes during 
CHARACTERISTICS OF 
EFFECTIVE NOTES
Eﬀ ective notes describe the scene and the events 
well enough to enable a prosecutor, judge or 
jury to visualize them.
Effective notes are complete, accurate, speciﬁ c, factual, 
clear, well-organized and legible.
 
Th e basic purpose of notes is to record the facts of a 
case. Recall the discussion of the importance of objectiv-
ity in an investigation. Use this same objectivity in note 
taking. For example, you might include in your notes the 
fact that a suspect reached inside his jacket and your infer-
ence that he was reaching for a gun. Your opinion on the 
merits of gun-control laws, however, has no place in your 
notes. If you have a speciﬁ c reason for including an opin-
ion, clearly label the statement as an opinion. Normally, 
however, restrict your notes to the facts you observe and 
learn and the inferences you draw. If, for example, you see 
a person you consider to be nervous and you make a note 
to that eﬀ ect, you are recording an inference. If, on the 
other hand, you record speciﬁ c observations such as, “Th e 
man kept looking over his shoulder, checking his watch 
and wiping perspiration from his forehead,” then you are 
recording facts on which you based your inference. You 
may not remember 6 months or a year later why you 
inferred that the man was nervous.
 
Record facts accurately. An inaccurately recorded 
name can result in the loss of a witness or suspect. Inaccu-
rate measurements can lead to wrong conclusions. Have 
people spell their names for you. Repeat spellings and 
numbers for veriﬁ cation. Recheck measurements.
 
Be as speciﬁ c as possible. Rather than writing tall, fast 
or far, write 6'8", 80 mph or 50 feet. Little agreement may 
exist on what is tall, fast or far.
 
Notes are usually taken rapidly, increasing the chance 
of errors. Take enough time to write legibly and clearly. 
Legibility and clarity are not synonymous. Legibility refers 
to the distinctness of your letters and numbers. Clarity 
refers to the distinctness of your statements. For exam-
ple, lack of clarity is seen in a note that states, “When vic-
tim saw suspect he pulled gun.” Who pulled the gun: the 
victim or the suspect? Th e same lack of clarity is seen in 
the statements “When suspect turned quickly I ﬁ red” (Did 
the suspect turn quickly, or did the oﬃ  cer ﬁ re quickly?) 
and “When the suspect came out of the house, I hit him 
with the spotlight.” Make certain your notes are clear and 
can be interpreted only one way.

44 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES 
OF PHOTOGRAPHS
One advantage of photographs is that they can be taken 
immediately, an important factor in bad weather or when 
many people are present. For example, a picture of a foot-
print in the dirt outside a window broken during a bur-
glary can be important if it rains before a casting can be 
made. Th e same is true when the large number of people 
present might alter the scene.
 
Another obvious advantage of crime scene photo-
graphs is that they accurately represent the crime scene 
in court. Th e eﬀ ect of pictures on a jury cannot be overes-
timated. Photographs are highly eﬀ ective visual aids that 
corroborate the facts presented.
Advantages of photographs: They can be taken 
 immediately, accurately represent the crime scene
and evidence, create interest and increase attention 
to testimony.
 
Although photographs of a crime scene accurately 
represent what was present, they include everything at 
the scene, both relevant and irrelevant. So much detail 
may distract viewers of photographs.
Disadvantages of photographs: They are not selective, 
do not show actual distances and may be distorted 
and damaged by mechanical errors in shooting or 
processing.
 
Despite these disadvantages, photography is a valu-
able investigative technique. Th e introduction of video 
technology (analogue videocassettes or digital video discs 
[DVDs]) into crime scene investigation has allowed inves-
tigators to compensate for some of the shortcomings of 
still photography.
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF VIDEO
A videocassette or DVD, played before a jury, can bring 
a crime scene to life and oﬀ ers some distinct advantages 
over photographs, such as showing distance and being 
cost-eﬀ ective. While taping, the videographer can use the 
camera’s audio function to describe the procedure being 
used to make the video and to explain what is being taped. 
Furthermore, a slow pan of a crime scene is more likely 
than is a series of photographs to capture all evidence, 
including that in the periphery of view, which might seem 
rather inconsequential at the time.
courtroom testimony. If you anticipate the need to have 
other investigators testify from a speciﬁ c set of notes, 
be sure they do in fact witness the original note tak-
ing at the crime scene and provide their initials on the 
original notes. Th e admissibility of notes in court is pre-
sented in greater detail in the ﬁ nal chapter of this text.
 
In addition to accurate notes, photographs provide 
vital and necessary means of documenting a crime scene.
INVESTIGATIVE PHOTOGRAPHY:
AN OVERVIEW
Apicture is, indeed, worth a thousand words, 
and investigative photographs and videotapes 
are essential to proper crime scene documentation. Th e 
basic purpose of crime scene photography is to record the 
scene permanently. Photos and video taken immediately, 
using proper techniques to reproduce the entire crime 
scene, provide a factual record of high evidentiary value. 
Th e time that elapses between the commission of a crime 
and when a suspect in that crime is brought to trial can 
stretch into months or years, with the condition of the 
crime scene and physical evidence deteriorating along the 
way. Photos and videos preserve the scene. Do not touch 
or move any evidence until pictures and video have been 
taken of the general area and all evidence.
Photographs and videotapes reproduce the crime scene 
in detail for presentation to the prosecution, defense, 
 witnesses, judge and jury in court and are used in 
 investigating, prosecuting and police training.
 
Although investigators take most crime scene pho-
tographs, they may also be acquired from commercial or 
amateur photographers, attorneys, news media personnel 
or the coroner’s staﬀ . For example, in an arson case at a 
church, photographs came from three outside sources. 
Th e pastor hired a photographer to take pictures for his-
torical purposes and to assess damage, an insurance com-
pany photographer took pictures, and a television news 
crew had taken live in-progress footage. Th ese pictures, 
along with those taken by police personnel, provided an 
excellent record of the ﬁ re in-progress, its point of origin 
and the resulting damage.
 
Videotape is now well established as an investigative 
tool. Lightweight, handheld video camcorders are easy 
to use at a crime scene. Videotapes can also be made of 
witness testimony, depositions, evidence, lineups and 
even trials.

BASIC PHOTOGRAPHIC 
EQUIPMENT
Crime scene photography uses both common 
and special-function cameras and equipment, 
depending on the crime investigated and the investiga-
tor’s preferences. Lyons (2007b, p.9) suggests, “First and 
foremost in the photographer’s arsenal of equipment 
must be a good camera bag or case.” He also notes that a 
high-quality, sturdy tripod is essential equipment.
At a minimum, have available and be skilled in operating 
a 35-mm single-lens reﬂ ex (SLR) camera (ﬁ lm or digital), 
a Polaroid-type instant-print camera, a press camera, a 
ﬁ ngerprint camera and video record/playback equipment.
 
Investigators commonly have individual preferences 
about the equipment to use in a given situation. Some 
have switched from 35-mm and press cameras to profes-
sional roll-ﬁ lm cameras: “Th e type of camera and features 
appropriate for a department depends greatly on who is 
going to use it” (Simon, 2006, p.62). Generally, equipment 
should meet several photographic needs.
 
Versatile 35-mm SLR ﬁ lm cameras provide nega-
tives for enlargements. Many models have an automatic 
built-in ﬂ ash (which can be turned oﬀ ) and can imprint 
the date directly on the photo. Many also allow the ﬁ lm to 
be rewound before the entire roll is shot.
 
Single-use cameras are another option for the ﬁ rst oﬃ  -
cer on a crime scene, regardless of photographic training 
or skill. Th ese ﬁ xed-focus ﬂ ash cameras come preloaded 
with both ﬁ lm and battery. Th e photographer simply 
points and shoots the photo.
 
Instant-print cameras such as those made by Pola-
roid and Impulse provide pictures at low cost per image. 
Instant-print photography provides immediate conﬁ rma-
tion of the quality and accuracy of the picture at a time 
when it is possible to take another shot. Th e cameras are 
simple to operate, which lessens the need for training. 
Every oﬃ  cer on the force can use an instant-print cam-
era. Th ese cameras have good optics, resolution and color 
and can document small evidence such as bullet holes. Th e 
greatest advantage, however, is that the photographer can 
tell immediately whether the photo is good.
 
Digital cameras also provide instant veriﬁ cation of a 
photo’s quality: “Th e oﬃ  cer or detective taking the photos 
can immediately see the image on the LCD review screen, so 
there really is no excuse for out-of-focus or poorly exposed 
photographs anymore. . . . Th e beneﬁ ts of digital photography 
Advantages of videos: They can be viewed immediately, 
accurately represent the crime scene and evidence, are 
able to show distance more clearly than photos, have 
sound capability to more fully document what is being 
seen and are cost-effective.
 
Regrettably, many agencies fail to provide adequate 
training to those tasked with videotaping a crime scene, 
assuming that if oﬃ  cers are able to tape their cousin’s 
wedding or their daughter’s soccer game, they should be 
able to handle a camcorder in any venue.
 
Th e negative consequences of poor video can damage 
a case, Some common mistakes made by untrained crime 
scene videographers include shooting without planning 
ahead, not shooting enough, shooting too much (resulting 
in a boring presentation), poor focusing, overusing the zoom 
feature, making jerky camera movements, including unin-
tentional audio, and failing to use a tripod. Proper training 
can help eliminate most, if not all, of these common video-
taping errors and increase the video’s documentation value.
Disadvantages of videos: Many people mistakenly 
 believe that no training in videotaping is necessary, 
which leads to poor video quality and a diminished value 
in the video’s documentation of the crime scene.
 
A vast array of modern equipment has greatly en -
hanced the investigative usefulness of photography and 
videography.
Digital technology is being used more often in documenting crime 
scenes. Digital cameras allow instant veriﬁ cation of a photo’s 
quality, and most automatically stamp the date and time of the 
image capture on an attached text ﬁ le. (© Stockdisc/Getty Images)

camera sensor’s sensitivity to light], shutter speed, and 
aperture control. . . . Point-and-shoot digital cameras are 
really well suited for patrol oﬃ  cers responding to burglar-
ies, auto trespasses, simple assaults, and other crimes that 
don’t require more advanced photography techniques” 
(Spraggs, 2006a, p.28).
 
Spraggs (2006a, p.30) notes that SLR digital cameras 
have “signiﬁ cantly higher image quality than point-and-
shoots” and suggest that the single greatest advantage of 
an SLR camera is the ability to change lenses: “With an 
SLR, the user can switch from a wide-angle lens for pho-
tographing the inside of a vehicle, to a specialized macro 
lens for ﬁ ngerprint work, and then switch to a long tele-
photo for surveillance work.”
 
A study by the Institute for Forensic Imaging reveals 
that digital photography can double the likelihood of con-
viction, mostly through plea bargains in domestic violence 
cases: “Th e study found that 64 percent of defendants in 
cases involving digital images as evidence plead guilty ver-
sus 20 percent in cases that did not have images of the 
victim” (Simon, p.62).
 
Th e discussion of digital cameras here is intention-
ally much more detailed than are the descriptions of other 
types of cameras because so many oﬃ  cers are converting 
to digital cameras.
 
Press cameras provide excellent photographs of a 
general scene as well as of smaller areas or small pieces 
of evidence. Th e ground glass of their lenses permits per-
fect focusing and shows exactly what portion of the scene 
will appear in the photograph. Th e 4" x 5" negative allows 
enlargement for detailed court presentation.
are clear, high-quality images; instant feedback and access 
to photos; the ability to keep imaging services in-house; and 
lower ongoing costs” (Spraggs, 2006a, p.28).
 
LCD does, however, have drawbacks: “Th e LCD on 
a digital SLR camera is relatively small and very bright. 
Images taken at shutter speeds below 1.60 of a second may 
appear ﬁ ne on the LCD but be out of focus when viewed on 
a larger computer screen or printed” (Lyons, 2006b, p.56).
 
One advantage of digital cameras is eliminating the 
time and expense involved in processing photographic 
ﬁ lm, while ensuring strict conﬁ dentiality. In addition, dig-
ital photos are quickly adaptable as e-mail attachments, as 
additions to electronic databases and as inserts on written 
reports. Another advantage is that most digital cameras 
record technical information about each photograph, such 
as the date and time and speciﬁ c camera settings, in a text 
ﬁ le associated with the image. A signiﬁ cant advantage of 
digital over ﬁ lm photos is consistency. Digital photogra-
phy, which suﬀ ers from none of the image degradation 
of analogue copies, changes the deﬁ nition of what was 
once vaunted as the original master. Now every copy is, in 
eﬀ ect, an original. All the advantages of digital still pho-
tography apply to digital video recording.
 
Digital cameras suitable for law enforcement are usu-
ally either point-and-shoot cameras (which have a ﬁ xed 
lens) or SLR cameras (which have interchangeable lenses). 
Both have strengths and weaknesses: “Most digital cameras 
sold today are point-and-shoots. Th ese cameras oﬀ er high 
levels of automation, including exposure, white balance,

digital video camera system to review a

The system, which records video and 
audio to a computer hard drive, is being 
installed in 60 Tyler police cruisers. 
Eventually, police headquarters will be 
able to see a live video transmission 
from the cameras through a wireless 
network. In addition to trafﬁ c stops, 
these video recorders can be used for 
taping evidence of driving under the 
inﬂ uence and drug arrests. The tapes

high-intensity spotlights. Lighting equipment can also assist 
in illuminating the scene as oﬃ  cers search for minute evi-
dence. Lenses and ﬁ lters are available for diﬀ erent purposes. 
Normal lenses are best for evidence, but sometimes special 
lenses are needed. For example, a telephoto lens can capture 
a distant subject, whereas a wide-angle lens can cover an 
entire room in a single frame. Various ﬁ lters can eliminate 
certain colors from a photograph. Lens care products and a 
soft bristled lens airbrush and lens cloth are also a necessity.
 
Selection of a camera and accessories is determined 
by budget, local needs and investigator preference. Some-
times investigators can borrow equipment from local 
schools or community organizations or share it with other 
agencies. In some communities, citizens lend special-pur-
pose equipment to the police department.
 
Darkroom facilities are an additional consideration. 
Smaller departments often share a darkroom with another 
agency, such as a ﬁ re department. Larger departments usu-
ally have their own darkrooms. If a commercial developer is 
used, it may take too long to get pictures back, conﬁ dential 
information may be revealed and the commercial developer 
may be required to testify in court. For these reasons, a 
police department may ﬁ nd it advantageous to have its own 
darkroom facilities or to share them with another agency.
 
A major advance is the ability of computer software 
to stitch together digital photos of 180 degrees or more 
to create one 360-degree photo—a panoramic view of a 
crime scene that is interactive, allowing viewers, includ-
ing jury members, to walk through it as though they were 
there (Figure 2.1). Th is type of 360-degree photographic 
 
Fingerprint cameras are specially constructed to take 
pictures of ﬁ ngerprints without distortion. Th ey provide 
their own light through four bulbs, one in each corner. 
Removing a bulb from any corner provides slanted light-
ing to show ﬁ ngerprint ridge detail. According to the 
Handbook of Forensic Services (2007, p.82), a tripod and 
cable release should be used when photographing latent 
prints. Th is camera can also photograph trace evidence 
such as bloodstains and tool marks.
 
Video cameras are used to record alleged bribery, pay-
oﬀ s and narcotics buys. Permanently installed units fre-
quently photograph crimes actually being committed, 
such as bank robberies or shoplifting. Videotaping crime 
scenes is now common. Th e cameras have become much 
less expensive, much more portable and much easier to 
operate. Th ey have the advantage of immediacy and elimi-
nation of a middle processing step in the chain of evidence. 
In addition, most can operate in quite limited light.
 
Camcorders and videotaping equipment have for some 
time been used for in-station recording of bookings and 
for testing of suspects in driving-while-intoxicated stops. 
Use of video cameras for crime scene investigations is now 
prevalent. Many police departments have purchased video 
equipment to record crime scenes and criminal acts such as 
vandalism, drug deals and thefts, increasing convictions.
 
Many police departments have mounted video cam-
eras on their patrol vehicles’ dashboards, an application 
that oﬀ ers many beneﬁ ts. Specialized cameras such as bin-
ocular cameras and trip cameras (cameras that set them-
selves oﬀ ) are helpful in surveillance.
 
Film for the various cameras may be black-and-white 
or color. Although more expensive, color ﬁ lm is often pre-
ferred because it is more realistic and accurate. Film can 
also be special-purpose, such as infrared ﬁ lm. Literature 
furnished with the camera gives detailed information 
about the type of ﬁ lm to use.
 
It is diﬃ  cult to describe color and sometimes impos-
sible to describe varying shades of color accurately. 
Th erefore, color ﬁ lm has a clear advantage. Oﬃ  cers and 
witnesses can more easily recognize objects in color pho-
tographs. Color photographs can bring out faintly visible 
stains and preserve the original colors of objects that fade 
because of weather or age. Color photographs are espe-
cially helpful in showing the nature and extent of physi-
cal injuries. More extensive uses of color photography in 
police work are being developed each year, and improved 
ﬁ lm and processing are assisting in the admissibility of 
color photographs in court.2
 
Accessories, depending on the camera(s) used, include 
an exposure meter, ﬂ ash attachments and ﬂ ood lamps and 
2 Defense attorneys sometimes object to color photographs on the grounds 
that they are inﬂ ammatory. Th is concern is discussed later in the chapter.

investigators to recreate the crime scene and to piece together 
better the events that occurred. These programs may also be

48 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Resolution is commonly quantiﬁ ed by pixels. A pixel is 
the smallest unit of a digital image, generally a dot within 
the image (just as traditional newsprint photos are made 
up of tiny dots); one megapixel is about a million dots. 
Th e more dots, the larger the image can be made without 
losing resolution quality. Digital cameras or other cap-
ture devices range in resolution from 2 megapixels to 24 
megapixels. However, resolution of computer monitors 
and printers, referred to as output devices, are given in 
pixels per inch, or PPI. Both types of resolution must be 
factored in when taking digital photographs because both 
aﬀ ect the ﬁ nal size and quality of the image. An image 
photographed with a high-resolution camera (the capture 
device), if printed on a low-resolution printer (the output 
device), will not show ﬁ ne detail clearly. A low-resolution 
image, if enlarged too much, will also lose quality.
 
An understanding of resolution is critical for investi-
gators who use digital cameras to document a crime scene 
because resolution aﬀ ects every aspect of digital imaging. 
Improper choice of equipment or incorrect settings on it 
will produce low-quality results, which may have damag-
ing consequences in the courtroom.
 
Th e importance of understanding resolution, and the 
plethora of other digital terms and concepts too detailed 
to explore here, is brought into focus when one considers 
evidentiary standards and requirements surrounding this 
technology. For example, an investigator photographing 
latent prints at a crime scene must know that the FBI’s 
Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identiﬁ cation System 
(AFIS) requires a latent print to be photographed with 
a minimum resolution of 1,000 PPI. In eﬀ ect, for digi-
tal images to have value in the courtroom, investigators 
must thoroughly understand their equipment and apply 
the technology properly. (Admissibility of photographs is 
examined shortly.)
WHAT TO PHOTOGRAPH OR VIDEOTAPE
Th e Handbook of Forensic Services (2007, p.179) recom-
mends photographing the crime scene as soon as possible 
and photographing the most fragile areas of the crime 
scene ﬁ rst. Take suﬃ  cient photographs or videotape to 
reconstruct the entire scene. Th is usually requires a series 
of shots, notably of the entrance point, the crime commis-
sion area and the exit point. If possible, show the entire 
crime scene in a pictorial sequence. Th is helps relate the 
crime to other crimes.
 
Move the camera to cover the entire crime scene 
area, but plan a sequence of shots that least disturb the 
scene. Th e initial photographs showing the entire crime 
scene should use a technique called overlapping. Pho-
tograph the scene clockwise and take the ﬁ rst picture 
with a speciﬁ c object on the right. For the second photo, 
view is called immersive imaging. Crime Scene Virtual 
Tour (CSVT) software lets jurors virtually step into a crime 
scene. Th e software allows the scene to be viewed from any 
angle with zoom, pan, tilt and rotate features. If a witness 
claims to have been standing at a certain place, an investi-
gator can virtually go there to view that perspective.
TRAINING IN AND USING 
INVESTIGATIVE PHOTOGRAPHY
Investigators can master most photographic 
equipment by reading the accompanying man-
uals and practicing. Some equipment, however, requires 
special training. Photographic training includes instruction 
in operating all available photographic equipment; shoot-
ing techniques; anticipated problems; and identifying, ﬁ l-
ing and maintaining continuity of photographic evidence. 
Learn the nomenclature and operation of your available 
photographic equipment. Sometimes camera and equip-
ment manufacturers or outlets provide such training.3
 
Professional commercial photographers in the com-
munity can sometimes assist in training or serve as con-
sultants. Th ey can provide information on photographic 
techniques and special problems such as lighting, close-
ups, exposures and use of ﬁ lters. Training programs also 
include instructions on identifying and ﬁ ling photographs 
and on establishing and maintaining the continuity of the 
chain of evidence.
DIGITAL CAMERAS
As with other types of crime scene processing techniques, 
proper training in the use of digital equipment is essen-
tial. Digital technology brings with it a new language and 
application skill set for investigators to learn. Although an 
in-depth discussion of digital technology, capabilities and 
applications is beyond the scope of this text, a few exam-
ples should make clear the critical need for investigators 
to be thoroughly trained in using digital equipment.
 
One of the most basic terms used when discussing 
digital photography is resolution, which refers to the 
ﬁ neness of image detail captured with a camera, displayed 
on a monitor or printed on paper. High resolution pro-
duces a sharp image; low resolution, a blurrier image. 
3 Th e Polaroid Corporation publishes a photography newsletter for law 
enforcement called Instant Evidence! (Back issues are available online at 
www.polaroid.com/instantevidence.) In addition, Polaroid has a technical 
assistance hotline: 1–800–225–1618. Th e hotline for digital cameras is 
1–800–432–5355.

CHAPTER 2 | Documenting the Crime Scene: Note Taking, Photographing and Sketching | 49
from two-dimensional photographs. Photogrammetry 
can also automatically orient photographs taken from 
awkward angles and can correct for camera misalign-
ment. Furthermore, this technique can cut in half the 
amount of time investigators spend performing on-site 
mapping of a crime scene. The major advantage is that 
images can be recorded quickly, reducing time spent at 
the crime scene.
PHOTOGRAPHING INJURIES
As noted in the description of digital cameras, photo-
graphs of injuries can increase convictions. Spraggs (2007, 
pp.26, 27) suggests, “Many of the guidelines we follow 
for crime scene photography also apply to documenting 
injury. Generally, it’s best to start with overall photo-
graphs and then take closer, more detailed pictures.” Th e 
close-up photos should nearly ﬁ ll the frame. One photo 
should be taken without a marker and a second taken with 
a marker. Spraggs also recommends controlling the sur-
roundings because cluttered, busy backgrounds in photos 
are distracting.
ERRORS TO AVOID
To obtain eﬀ ective photographs and videos, be familiar 
with your equipment and check it before you use it.
Take photographs and videos before anything is 
 disturbed. Avoid inaccuracies and distortions.
 
If something has been moved, do not put it back. It is 
legally impossible to return an object to its original posi-
tion. To minimize distortion or misrepresentation, main-
tain proper perspective and attempt to show the objects 
in a crime scene in their relative size and position. Take 
pictures from eye level, the height from which people nor-
mally observe objects.
PHOTO LOGS AND CHECKLISTS
Lyons (2007a, p.60) stresses, “Checklists are a critical as -
pect of the law enforcement function, especially when it 
comes to crime scene photography.” A checklist for a 35-mm 
SLR ﬁ lm camera might include such items as the following: 
are the batteries in the camera; is the ﬁ lm loaded; is the 
camera on; is the ﬂ ash cable connected to the ﬂ ash and to 
the camera; is the lens cap removed? Settings such as ﬁ lm 
speed, shooting mode, white balance, shutter speed, lens 
focal length and aperture should also be included. Similar 
items should be checked for digital SLR cameras.
make sure that the same object is on the left side of the 
photograph. Continue in this way until you have covered 
the entire scene.
First, photograph the general area, then speciﬁ c areas 
and ﬁ nally speciﬁ c objects of evidence. Take exterior 
shots ﬁ rst because they are the most subject to alteration 
by weather and security violations.
 
Th is progression of shots or video will reconstruct the 
commission of a crime:
 1. Take long-range shots of the locality, points of ingress 
and egress, normal entry to the property and build-
ings, exterior of the buildings and grounds and street 
signs or other identiﬁ able structures that will estab-
lish location.
 2. Take medium-range shots of the immediate crime 
scene and the location of objects of evidence within 
the area or room.
 3. Take close-range shots of speciﬁ c evidence such as 
hairs, ﬁ bers, footprints and bloodstains. Th e entire 
surface of some objects may be photographed to show 
all the evidence; for example, a table surface may con-
tain bloodstains, ﬁ ngerprints, hairs and ﬁ bers.
 
Zoom lenses allow close shots without disturbing the 
crime scene, and close-ups are possible with macro lenses. 
Such close-range shots usually should include a marker, 
sometimes called a scale. A marker is anything used in 
a picture to show accurate or relative size. It is usually a 
ruler, but it can be some other object of a known size. An 
important point: Using a marker introduces something 
foreign to the crime scene. Th e same is true of chalk marks 
drawn around a body or placed on walls to illustrate bul-
let direction. Th erefore, ﬁ rst take a picture of the scene or 
object without the marker; then add the marker and take 
a second photograph.
 
Diﬀ erent crimes require diﬀ erent types of photo-
graphs. In arson cases, photograph the point of origin 
and any incendiary devices. In burglaries, photograph the 
points of entry and exit, tool marks, ﬁ ngerprints and other 
trace evidence. In assaults, photograph injuries and do so 
in color if possible. In homicides or suicides, photograph 
the deceased, including pictures of the clothing worn; take 
a full-length picture showing height, position of the body 
and all extremities and evidence near the body. Photo-
graph injured parts of the body to show the location and 
extent of injuries and any postmortem lividity (discussed 
in Chapter 8).
 
Photogrammetry can be used at most crime scenes. 
Forensic photogrammetry is the technique of 
extrapolating three-dimensional (3-D) measurements 

50 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
can reach them easily. Lighting conditions determine whether 
color or black-and-white ﬁ lm is appropriate. Hidden camcord-
ers can be used at drug-buy scenes.
 
Often the tapes from security cameras leave much to 
be desired: “Old tapes, poor time lapse, bad coloring or 
lighting and non-sharp images are just some of the many 
common problems” (Gordon, 2006, p.56). Such problems 
can be overcome by professional video and audio forensic 
tools such as dTective and dVeloper available from Ocean 
Systems (Gordon).
 
Such video analysis, according to a national video 
forensics expert is the “new DNA for law enforcement” 
(Heinecke, 2007, p.86). Th e Department of Justice and 
the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) 
have developed four Regional Forensic Video Analysis 
Labs, located in Cincinnati, Ohio; Fort Worth, Texas; 
Raynham, Massachusetts; and a fourth location yet to 
be determined in the northwestern United States. Th ese 
labs will be equipped with dTective, currently in use by 
90 percent of all agencies with video analysis capabilities: 
“Just as DNA has CODIS and ﬁ ngerprints have AFIS, now 
forensic video evidence will have the Regional Forensic 
Video Analysis Labs—a national database of criminals 
caught on tape” (Heinecke, 2007, p.87).
 
Enhanced surveillance capability can be provided 
by using robots: “Th rough the addition of cameras and 
microphones, as well as wireless communications, critical 
TYPES OF INVESTIGATIVE 
PHOTOGRAPHY
In addition to crime scene photography, certain 
other types of photography play vital roles in 
investigation.
Types of investigative photography include crime 
scene, surveillance, aerial, night, laboratory, lineup 
and mug shot.
SURVEILLANCE PHOTOGRAPHY
Surveillance photography establishes the identity of a 
subject or records criminal behavior without the pho-
tographer’s presence being known to the subject. Th e 
photographs or videotapes can help identify a suspect’s 
associates, destroy an alibi, plan a raid or develop a surveil-
lance plan. Banks and stores frequently use surveillance 
cameras to help identify robbers and burglars. Numerous 
bank robbers have been identiﬁ ed through photographs 
taken by surveillance cameras installed in the bank. With 
a well-thought out plan, surveillance tapes can potentially 
be a “real force multiplier for law enforcement agencies of 
any size” (Kanable, 2008, p.30).
 
Photographs during a stakeout are usually taken with 
an SLR camera with several telephoto lenses. Sometimes 
infrared ﬁ lm is used. It may be necessary to use a van—
preferably borrowed because it is best to use a vehicle only 
once for such purposes. An appliance repair van or any van 
that would commonly be seen in the area is desirable.
 
Concealing a camera can be a problem. You might use 
a bag, briefcase, suitcase or coat pocket with an opening. 
You can also conceal the camera by using rooftops or win-
dows of buildings or vehicles in the area. A camera kept 
away from a vehicle window is rarely seen by people out-
side the vehicle. Keep the camera loaded and adjusted to 
the required light so you can take pictures instantly.
 
Surveillance photography is often called trap pho-
tography because the photos prove that an incident 
occurred and can help identify suspects and weapons. 
Th ese photos corroborate witness testimony and identiﬁ -
cation. Th e fact that the photos exist often induces guilty 
pleas without court appearances, thus saving investiga-
tors’ time.
 
Battery-operated cameras can be moved to diﬀ erent 
locations. You can reduce the amount of ﬁ lm needed by using 
triggering devices such as bait-money pull switches or by plac-
ing activation buttons in several locations where employees 
Technology Innovations
As Gordon (p.57) explains,
dVeloper addresses those old security tapes 
and poor lighting by assisting in clearing up a 
video and bringing out hidden details. It can 
remove snow and rain and enhance a dark video by 
removing noise and video graininess, permitting an 
optimized picture.
dVeloper was used by the Columbus Ohio 
Division of Police to apprehend a serial rapist. 
The suspect operated in an area of the Ohio State 
University and after committing the rape, would 
use the victim’s ATM card to withdraw money. 
The surveillance video from the ATM window was 
basically a dark screen with only vehicle taillights 
visible. Forensic video specialist John Hodson 
of the Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Com-
mission used dVeloper and was able to make the 
license plate number visible, which led to an ulti-
mate conviction.

CHAPTER 2 | Documenting the Crime Scene: Note Taking, Photographing and Sketching | 51
technology now allows those silos of data to be shared 
with each other in near real time.”
 
Aerial photographs are often available in commercial 
photographers’ ﬁ les, engineering oﬃ  ces or highway-plan-
ning agencies. Th e vast areas covered by highways and 
engineering projects usually require aerial mapping. Fed-
eral, state, county and municipal agencies also may have 
aerial photos. If none are available, a local photographer 
can be hired to provide them. Many larger departments 
and county sheriﬀ ’s oﬃ  ces have helicopters that may be 
available.
 
Aerial photos can be enlarged or presented on slides to 
show the relationships of streets and roads. For example, 
in the John F. Kennedy assassination investigation, the 
entire area was photographed, including all points from 
which shots might have been ﬁ red. More recently, soft-
ware based on aerial photography was used by multiple 
jurisdictions involved in the DC sniper investigation.
 
A high-tech application of aerial photography involves 
Pictometry®, a unique, patented computer technology 
that integrates various aerial shots of a land-based arti-
fact taken straight down (orthogonal) and from numerous 
angles (oblique). Th e result is a high-resolution 3-D image 
of the object, whether it be a landmark, a neighborhood, a 
bridge, a river, a house or any other structure or geologi-
cal feature, which investigators may view from multiple 
perspectives with the simple click of a mouse (Figure 2.2). 
Th e software also features extreme zooming capabilities, 
allowing investigators to rotate and zoom in on a particu-
lar structure.
NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY
Taking pictures at night presents special problems, par-
ticularly that of illuminating a scene. Adequate light can 
be obtained by increasing exposure time, using a photo-
ﬂ ash for small areas and a ﬂ ash series for larger areas or 
using ﬂ oodlights. Floodlights also aid in locating evidence 
and decrease the chance of evidence being accidentally 
destroyed.
 
Investigators can make the camera see as the pho-
tographer sees through camera position, time exposure 
and supplemental lighting. State-of-the-art night-vision 
devices and cameras are dramatically better than earlier 
ones, with a range extending as far as a mile. Night-vision 
devices use image intensiﬁ cation and can be binoculars, 
weapon mounted, camera mounted or head mounted.
LABORATORY PHOTOGRAPHY
Not all investigative photography is done in the ﬁ eld. 
Sometimes objects are photographed in a laboratory with 
special equipment that is too large, delicate or expensive 
intelligence can be gathered without exposing oﬃ  cers” 
(Ashley, 2008, p.32). Small video cameras have also 
been attached to radio-controlled model airplanes. Siuru 
(2006, p.126) describes one such airplane: “‘SkySeer™ is 
a high-tech, but relatively inexpensive, unmanned aerial 
vehicle, or UAV, designed speciﬁ cally for law enforce-
ment work.’ . . . Th e SkySeer™ carries a video surveillance 
camera that transmits images in real time. It ﬂ ies auton-
omously on a ﬂ ight path programmed in before launch 
and using GPS waypoints. It is controlled in real time by 
a joystick on the ground station.”
 
Surveillance photography can also be a crime preven-
tion and detection tool. For example, the Newark, New 
Jersey, Police Department has video cameras mounted in 
six diﬀ erent areas of the 2-square-mile downtown area. 
An oﬃ  cer observes what is taking place in each area from 
a central location. Burglaries and street robberies have 
decreased, and the police have successfully presented the 
videos as evidence in court.
AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY
Investigators often use aerial photography to cover 
extensive areas. For example, it can be used following 
a bank robbery to show roads leading to and from the 
bank. Aerial photography is also useful when police know 
that a crime is going to be committed but not when. 
Aerial photography shows routes to the scene as well 
as how to block escape routes and avoid detours during 
pursuit and where to set up roadblocks. It is essential 
in locating dead-end streets—information that can be 
very important if a chase ensues. Aerial pictures can also 
help establish the location of a crime scene, especially in 
large rural areas or mountainous sectors. And, as noted 
previously, a UAV might be used to provide aerial video 
in real time.
 
Geographical information systems (GIS) technol-
ogy is now enhancing the aerial views of crimes scenes 
by providing background information about specific 
crime scenes, such as buildings and streets, to the 
investigator: “GIS used successfully with leading pub-
lic safety software will continue to offer the speed and 
performance needed to respond when seconds mat-
ter” (Wandrei, 2007, p.56). Historically, many agen-
cies have multiple and separate data silos within a 
local government (Wandrei, p.58). For example, the 
road commission maintains a schedule of road closures 
and ongoing road construction projects, and the fire 
department maintains much information about com-
mercial buildings, including floor plans, alarm codes, 
evacuation routes and on-premise hazardous materials. 
Wandrei suggests such information can be invaluable 
to law enforcement: “A significant improvement in GIS

as hairs or ﬁ bers. In contrast, macrophotography enlarges 
a subject. For example, a ﬁ ngerprint or a tool mark can be 
greatly enlarged to show the details of ridges or striations.
 
Laser-beam photography can reveal evidence indis-
cernible to the naked eye. For example, it can reveal the 
outline of a footprint in a carpet, even though the ﬁ bers 
have returned to normal position.
to use in the ﬁ eld. For example, infrared ﬁ lm photographs 
can reveal the contents of unopened envelopes, blood-
stains, alterations to documents, variations in types of 
ink and residue near where a bullet has passed through 
clothing. X-ray cameras can detect loaded dice.
 
Microphotography takes pictures through a micro-
scope and can help identify minute particles of evidence such

CHAPTER 2 | Documenting the Crime Scene: Note Taking, Photographing and Sketching | 53
IDENTIFYING, FILING AND 
MAINTAINING SECURITY OF 
EVIDENCE
Photographs must be properly identiﬁ ed, ﬁ led 
and kept secure to be admissible as evidence.
IDENTIFYING
In the ﬁ eld notes, the photographs taken should be dated 
and numbered in sequence. Include the case number, type 
of oﬀ ense and subject of the picture. To further identify 
the photograph with the crime scene and the subject, 
record the photographer’s name, location and direction of 
 
Ultraviolet-light photography uses the low end 
of the color spectrum, which is invisible to human sight, 
to make visible impressions of bruises and injuries long 
after their actual occurrence. Bite marks, injuries caused 
by beatings, cigarette burns, neck strangulation marks 
and other impressions left from intentional injuries can 
be reproduced and used as evidence in criminal cases by 
scanning the presumed area of injury with a ﬂ uorescent 
or blue light. Th e damage impression left by the injury is 
then photographed. In addition, the type of weapon used 
in committing a crime can often be determined by exam-
ining its impression, developed by using ultraviolet light.
MUG SHOTS
Although investigators seldom take mug shots them-
selves, these photographs are often signiﬁ cant in crimi-
nal investigations. Mug shots originated in 19th-century 
France when Alphonse Bertillon developed a method of 
identiﬁ cation that used an extensive system of measure-
ments to describe people. Th e Bertillon identiﬁ cation 
system included a written description, the complete mea-
surements of the person and a photograph. Th e pictures 
of people in police custody were kept in department ﬁ les 
for identiﬁ cation and became known as mug shots. Gath-
ered in ﬁ les and displayed in groups, they were called a 
rogues’ gallery.
 
Opinions diﬀ er regarding the preferred poses for mug 
shots. Some agencies believe the front and proﬁ le of the 
head are suﬃ  cient; others prefer full-length, stand-up pic-
tures. No matter what the pose, mug shots should include 
the facial features and the clothing worn at the time of 
arrest, because a defendant’s appearance may change 
between the time of arrest and trial. Mug shots can be 
ﬁ led by age, sex and height to make them more readily 
accessible for viewing. Mug shots can be carried in the 
ﬁ eld to identify suspicious persons or to show to crime 
victims to assist in identifying their attacker. Mug shots 
are also used for “wanted” circulars distributed to other 
police agencies and the public. Th e use of mug shots in 
suspect identiﬁ cation is discussed in Chapter 7.
LINEUP PHOTOGRAPHS
Th e computer’s capacity to sort through a database of mug 
shots and bring up all the “hits” within speciﬁ c categories 
can assist in generating photographic lineups. After enter-
ing characteristics of a known suspect, an oﬃ  cer can select 
6 to 12 other “hits” to be used for presentation with the 
suspect’s photo. In addition, videotapes or photographs 
of people included in lineups may be taken to establish 
the fairness of the lineup.
A video imaging system allows ofﬁ cers to sort a database 
using speciﬁ c parameters—race, sex, hair color, height, age, 
distinguishing marks—any feature that can be visually described. 
The “hits” can then be used to assemble a photographic lineup.

will be accurate. Inaccuracies do not necessarily render 
the photograph inadmissible as evidence as long as they 
are fully explained and the court is not misled about what 
the picture represents.
 
Likewise, distortion will not necessarily disqualify a 
photograph as evidence if no attempt is made to misrep-
resent the photograph and if the distortion is adequately 
explained. For example, an amateur photographer may 
have taken the picture from an unusual camera height to 
produce a dramatic eﬀ ect, not knowing the picture would 
later be useful as evidence in a criminal investigation.
 
Color distortion is a frequent objection. Because most 
objects have color, black-and-white photographs are tech-
nically distorted. Th erefore, color photographs usually 
constitute better evidence. However, color can also be dis-
torted by inadequate lighting or faulty processing. Never-
theless, the photograph can still be useful, especially if the 
object’s shape is more important than its color.
 
Although color photographs are less distorted and 
are usually better evidence than black-and-white photo-
graphs, they have often been objected to as being inﬂ am-
matory—for example, showing in gruesome, vivid color 
a badly beaten body. To be ruled inadmissible, color pho-
tographs must be judged by the court to be so inﬂ amma-
tory that they will unduly inﬂ uence the jury. Sometimes 
taking both color and black-and-white pictures is advis-
able. Th e black-and-white pictures can be introduced as 
evidence; the color pictures can be used for investigatory 
purposes only.
 
Objections to enlargements have also been raised. 
Such objections can be nulliﬁ ed by producing the origi-
nal negative along with the enlargement to prove that no 
alterations have been made.
AUTHENTICATING DIGITAL IMAGES
Th e availability of software, such as Adobe Photoshop, 
that modiﬁ es, enhances or otherwise alters digital images 
raises authenticity issues and concerns regarding such 
digital photographs’ originality and integrity. To over-
come defense challenges that a digital image was altered 
or otherwise tampered with, investigators must rigor-
ously maintain the chain of custody and use techniques 
that safeguard the authenticity of their photographs: 
“Image authentication is providing proof that the image 
introduced into evidence is the same image taken at the 
crime scene. Th is can be done through testimony of the 
photographer, other persons present when the photo was 
taken, and/or through the use of authentication software” 
(Lyons, 2006a, p.80).
 
Several software programs have been developed that 
“watermark” or authenticate the original image, either 
at the point of capture (within the camera) or as it is 
the camera, lens type, approximate distance in feet to the 
subject, ﬁ lm and shutter speed, lighting, weather condi-
tions and a brief description of the scene in the picture.
 
Th e photos should also be marked like any other evi-
dence relating to the crime scene using a procedure called 
backing. Th is includes writing on the back of the photo 
your initials, the date the photo was taken, what the photo 
depicts and the direction of north.
FILING
File the picture and negatives for easy reference. Pictures 
in the case ﬁ le are available to others. Th erefore, it is usu-
ally best to put them in a special photograph ﬁ le, cross-
referenced by case number.
MAINTAINING SECURITY
Record the chain of custody of the ﬁ lm and photographs 
in the ﬁ eld notes or in a special ﬁ le. Mark and identify 
the ﬁ lm as it is removed from the camera. Each time the 
ﬁ lm changes possession, record the name of the person 
accepting it. If a commercial ﬁ rm develops the ﬁ lm, take 
it to the company in person or send it by registered mail 
with a return receipt.
ADMISSIBILITY OF 
PHOTOGRAPHS IN COURT
Photographs must be taken under certain con-
ditions and must meet speciﬁ c criteria to be 
admissible in court.
Photographs must be material, relevant, competent, 
accurate, free of distortion and noninﬂ ammatory.
 
A material photograph relates to a speciﬁ c case and 
subject. Material evidence is relevant and forms a sub-
stantive part of the case presented or has a legitimate and 
eﬀ ective inﬂ uence on the decision of the case. A relevant 
photograph helps explain testimony. A competent pho-
tograph accurately represents what it purports to repre-
sent, is properly identiﬁ ed and is properly placed in the 
chain of evidence and secured until court presentation.
 
Testimony reports the exact conditions under which 
the photographs were taken, the equipment and type of 
ﬁ lm used and where the ﬁ lm was processed. Photographs 
must be accurate and free of distortion. If nothing has 
been removed from or added to the scene, the photograph 

CHAPTER 2 | Documenting the Crime Scene: Note Taking, Photographing and Sketching | 55
• • Helps create a mental picture of the scene for those 
not present.
• • Is a permanent record of the scene.
• • Is usually admissible in court.
A crime scene sketch assists in (1) interviewing and 
 interrogating people, (2) preparing the investigative 
report and (3) presenting the case in court.
 
Th e sketch supplements photographs, notes, plaster 
casts and other investigative techniques. Artistic ability is 
helpful but not essential in making crime scene sketches. 
Still, many police oﬃ  cers avoid making sketches. To over-
come this hesitance, practice by drawing familiar scenes 
such as your home, oﬃ  ce or police station. Use graph 
paper to make sketching easier.
 
Th e most common types of sketches are those drawn 
at the crime scene, called rough sketches, and those com-
pleted later by an investigator or a drafter, called scale (or 
ﬁ nished) drawings. Both describe the crime scene pictorially 
and show the precise location of objects and evidence.
THE ROUGH SKETCH
Arough sketch is the ﬁ rst pencil-drawn outline 
of a scene and the location of objects and evi-
dence within this outline. It is not usually drawn to scale, 
although distances are measured and entered in the appro-
priate locations.
Sketch all serious crime and crash scenes after photo-
graphs are taken and before anything is moved. Sketch 
the entire scene, the objects and the evidence.
 
It is better to include too much rather than too little, 
but do not include irrelevant objects that clutter and con-
fuse the sketch.
 
Th e area to be sketched depends on the crime scene. 
If it involves a large area, make a sketch of nearby streets, 
vegetation and entrance and exit paths. If the scene is 
inside a house or apartment building, show the scene’s 
location in relation to the larger structure. If the scene 
involves only a single room, sketch only the immediate 
crime scene, including an outline of the room, objects and 
the evidence within it.
 
Do not overlook the possible availability of archi-
tectural drawings of the house or building. Th ese are 
downloaded from the camera to a computer. Th e pro-
grams then store the original image in a secure location 
and write-protect it, making it impossible to alter the 
original, yet still allowing copies to be manipulated for 
investigative purposes. A new technology for authentica-
tion is the Lexar LockTight system.
 
In addition to admissible photographs and videotapes, 
investigators usually must prepare a crime scene sketch.
CRIME SCENE SKETCHES: 
AN OVERVIEW
An investigator’s scene sketch can be more 
descriptive than hundreds of words and is 
often an extremely important investigative aid. Th e crime 
scene sketch:
• • Accurately portrays the physical facts.
• • Relates to the sequence of events at the scene.
• • Establishes the precise location and relationship of 
objects and evidence at the scene.
Technology Innovations
Spraggs (2006b, p.33) contends, “The LockTight 
system makes certain that no unauthorized users 
can access images stored on a LockTight-enabled 
CompactFlash card. If you can’t access the images, 
you can’t alter them.” He provides an overview of the 
system:
The LockTight system consists of four compo-
nents: a digital camera, a dedicated CompactFlash 
card, a special card reader, and the LockTight soft-
ware package. . . .
The data on a LockTight card is “locked” until 
the authorization process occurs between the 
LockTight card and either the camera or computer 
trying to access the card. . . .
The memory card is “unlocked” by entering 
an approved user name and password. This lets 
the user access the camera’s CompactFlash card 
in the LockTight reader. Once access is granted, 
the CompactFlash card shows up as a normal drive 
on the user’s computer desktop, allowing data to 
be transferred to archival storage per the agency’s 
standard operating procedures.

56 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
To sketch a crime scene:
• • Observe and plan.
• • Measure distances and outline the area.
• • Plot objects and evidence within the outline.
• • Take notes and record details.
• • Identify the sketch with a legend and a scale.
• • Reassess the sketch.
STEP ONE: OBSERVE AND PLAN
Before starting to sketch, observe the scene as many times 
as you need to feel comfortable with it. Take in the entire 
scene mentally so you can recall it later. Plan in advance 
how to proceed in an organized way to avoid destruction 
of evidence. Ask yourself, “What is relevant to the crime? 
What should be included in the sketch?”
 
Th e size of the area determines how many sketches 
you make. For example, part of the crime may have taken 
place indoors and another part outdoors a considerable 
distance away. To include the entire area would make the 
scale too small. Th erefore, make two sketches.
 
Th e overview also helps you determine where to start 
sketching and measuring. If the scene is a room, stand in 
the doorway and start the sketch there. Th en continue 
clockwise or counterclockwise. Th e photographs, sketch 
and search are all made in the same direction. Usually it 
does not matter which direction is selected, but try to use 
the one that is least disturbing to evidence.
STEP TWO: MEASURE DISTANCES 
AND OUTLINE THE AREA
All measurements must be accurate. Do not estimate dis-
tances or use paces or shoe length measurement. Use con-
ventional units of measurements such as inches, feet or 
yards. Do not move any objects while measuring.
 
If another oﬃ  cer is helping you take measurements, 
reverse the ends of the tape so you both can observe the 
actual distance on the tape. Legally, it is hearsay for oﬃ  cers to 
testify to what they did not actually observe. If a third oﬃ  cer 
is taking notes, that oﬃ  cer can testify to only the measure-
ments given to him or her unless he or she actually saw the 
tape measurement. However, all oﬃ  cers may testify from the 
same notes if they review and initial them as they are made.
 
Do not measure from movable objects. Use ﬁ xed loca-
tions such as walls, trees, telephone poles, building cor-
ners, curbs and so on. Measure from wall to wall, not 
baseboard to baseboard.
 
Once the outside measurements have been made, 
sketch the outline, maintaining some distance ratio. Use 
the longest measurement ﬁ rst and orient the sketch paper 
often on ﬁ le with local engineering, assessing or building 
departments or with the architect who drew the original 
plans.
SKETCHING MATERIALS
Materials needed for rough sketches should be assembled 
and placed in their own kit or in the crime scene investiga-
tion kit.
Materials for the rough sketch include paper, pencil, long 
steel measuring tape, carpenter-type ruler, straightedge, 
clipboard, eraser, compass, protractor and thumbtacks.
 
Paper of any type will do, but plain white or graph 
paper is best. No lines interfere if you use plain white. On 
the other hand, graph paper provides distance ratios and 
allows for more accurate depictions of the relationships 
between objects and evidence at the scene. When sketch-
ing, use a hard lead pencil to avoid smudges. Keep two or 
three pencils on hand.
 
Use a 50- to 150-foot steel measuring tape for 
measuring long distances. Steel is preferable because 
it does not stretch and therefore is more accurate than 
cloth tape. Use a carpenter-type ruler to take short and 
close-quarter measurements and a straightedge to draw 
straight lines. A clipboard will give a ﬁ rm, level drawing 
surface.
 
Use a compass to determine true north, especially in 
areas and buildings laid out in other than true directions. 
Use a protractor to ﬁ nd the proper angles when determin-
ing coordinates.
 
Thumbtacks are helpful to hold down one end of 
the tape when you measure. You can also use them 
to fasten paper to a drawing surface if no clipboard is 
available.
STEPS IN SKETCHING THE 
CRIME SCENE
Once photographs have been taken and other 
priority steps in the preliminary investigation 
performed, you can begin sketching the crime scene. 
First, make an overall judgment of the scene. Remember 
not to move, remove, touch or pick up anything until it 
has been photographed, located on the rough sketch, and 
described in detail in your notes. Th en handle objects only 
in accordance with the techniques for preserving 
evidence.

might look like Figure 2.3, whereas the outline sketch of 
an outdoor scene might look like Figure 2.4.
to this distance, positioning the sketch so north is toward 
the top of the paper. Place the outside limits in the sketch 
using dimension lines such as this:
|__________10'__________|
 
Determine the scale by taking the longest measurement 
at the scene and dividing it by the longest measurement of 
the paper used for sketching. For example, if your paper is 
10 inches and the longest measurement at the scene is 100 
feet, let 1 inch equal 10 feet. Use the largest, simplest scale 
possible. Table 2.1 presents suggested scales for sketches.
 
Graph paper makes it easier to draw to scale. Each 
square can equal 1 square foot or 1 square inch, depending

scene measurements. Here, New York

the sketch, some courts have withheld introduction of 
the sketch until the evidence has been approved. If the 
evidence is placed only in the ﬁ nished scale drawing, the 
sketch can be introduced and used by witnesses to cor-
roborate their testimony.
 
While sketching, check measurements frequently. 
Make corrections if needed, but make no changes after 
leaving the scene. Measurements may or may not be 
placed in the sketch itself, depending on how many 
objects are located in the available space. Measurements 
can be placed in your notes and later entered in the scale 
drawing.
 
Many software products allow laser measurements to 
be coupled with digital photographs of an area to create a 
virtual scene that, such as those generated by Pictometry, 
can be rotated and zoomed in on.
 
Next, measure and sketch the doors and windows. 
Record their measurements and indicate whether the 
doors open in or out. To measure windows, use the width 
and height of the actual window opening; do not include 
the window frame. Th e outline of a room with doors and 
windows added might look like Figure 2.5.
 
Sketch the location of physical objects within the perime-
ter. Use approximate shapes for large objects and symbols for 
small ones. Place items of evidence in the sketch at the same 
time you place objects. Use numbers to designate objects and 
letters to designate evidence. Include such items as bullet 
entry or exit points, body, hair, gun, ﬁ bers, bloodstains and 
so on. Use exact measurements to show the location of evi-
dence within the room and in relation to all other objects.

tion of evidence in this sketch. If evidence is placed within

CHAPTER 2 | Documenting the Crime Scene: Note Taking, Photographing and Sketching | 59
Triangulation Method Triangulation is commonly used in 
outdoor scenes but can also be used indoors. Triangulation 
uses straight-line measures from two ﬁ xed objects to the 
evidence to create a triangle with the evidence in the angle 
formed by the two straight lines. Th e degree of the angle 
formed at the location of the object or evidence can then be 
measured with a protractor. Th e angle can be any degree, in 
contrast to the rectangular-coordinate and baseline meth-
ods, in which the angle is always a right angle (90 degrees).
 
Always select the best ﬁ xed points possible, with 
emphasis on their permanence. Fixed points may be closet 
doors, electrical outlets, door jambs or corners of a struc-
ture. It is sometimes impossible to get to the corners of a 
room for accurate measurements because of obstacles.
 
Triangulation is illustrated in Figure 2.10.
STEP THREE: PLOT OBJECTS AND EVIDENCE
Plotting methods are used to locate objects and evidence 
on the sketch. These methods include the use of rectan-
gular coordinates, a baseline, triangulation and compass 
points.
 
To plot objects and evidence accurately, determine 
ﬁ xed points from which to measure.
Rectangular-Coordinate Method 
The rectangular-
coordinate method is a common way to locate objects 
and evidence in a room. The rectangular-coordinate 
method uses two adjacent walls as fixed points from 
which distances are measured at right angles. Locate 
objects by measuring from one wall at right angles 
and then from the adjacent wall at right angles. This 
method is restricted to square or rectangular areas 
(Figure 2.6).
Baseline Method Another way to measure by coordi-
nates is to run a baseline from one ﬁ xed point to another. 
Th e baseline method establishes a straight line from 
one ﬁ xed point to another, from which measurements 
are taken at right angles. Take measurements along either 
side of the baseline to a point at right angles to the object 
to be located. An indoor baseline method sketch might 
look like Figure 2.7 or Figure 2.8. Outdoors, it might look 
like Figure 2.9.
 
Sometimes the distance between two locations is 
important. For example, the distance from the normal 
route to a door might be very important if evidence is 
found in a room. Th e 34-foot measurement in Figure 2.9 
illustrates this need in an outdoor setting.

above it, looking down. In eﬀ ect, the room is ﬂ attened 
out much like a box cut down at the four corners and 
opened out ﬂ at. A cross-projection sketch presents 
the ﬂ oor and walls as though they were one surface. 
Objects of evidence on both the ﬂ oor and the walls can 
be measured to show their relationship on a single plane, 
as shown in Figure 2.12.
STEP FOUR: TAKE NOTES AND RECORD 
DETAILS
After you have completed your sketch, take careful notes 
regarding all relevant factors associated with the scene 
that are not sketchable, such as lighting conditions, colors 
and people present.
Compass-Point Method Th e compass-point method 
uses a protractor to measure the angle formed by two 
lines. In Figure 2.11, for example, Object A is located 10'7" 
from origin C and at an angle of 59 degrees from the verti-
cal line through point C. Object B is 16'7" from origin C at 
an angle of 47 degrees from the vertical.
Cross-Projection Method For some interior crime 
scenes, it is useful to show the relationship between 
evidence on the ﬂ oors and the walls. Th is can be done 
by sketching the room as though the viewer is straight

FILE THE SKETCH
Place the rough sketch in a secure ﬁ le. It is a 
permanent record for all future investiga-
tions of the crime. It may be used later to question wit-
nesses or suspects and is the foundation for the ﬁ nished 
scale drawing. Th e better the rough sketch is, the better 
the ﬁ nished drawing will be.
 
Keep the rough sketch in its original form even 
after the scale drawing is completed because it may 
be needed for testifying. Otherwise, the defense may 
claim that changes were made in preparing the scale 
drawings.
STEP FIVE: IDENTIFY THE SCENE
Prepare a legend containing the case number, type of crime, 
name of the victim or complainant, location, date, time, inves-
tigator, anyone assisting, scale of the sketch, direction of north 
and name of the person making the sketch (Figure 2.13).
STEP SIX: REASSESS THE SKETCH
Before leaving the scene, make sure you have recorded every-
thing you need on the sketch. Make sure nothing has been 
overlooked or incorrectly diagrammed. Once you have left, 
nothing should be added to the sketch. Compare the scene 
with the sketch. Are all measurements included? Have all 
relevant notations been made? Have you missed anything?

is drawn to scale, using exact measurements. Th e materi-
als used for making scale drawings are listed in Table 2.2.
 
Th e artistic reﬁ nements of the scale drawing do not 
permit it to be made at the crime scene. Instead, the scale 
drawing is made at the police station by the investigator 
or by a drafter. If anyone other than the investigator pre-
pares the ﬁ nished scale drawing, the investigator must 
review it carefully and sign it along with the drafter.

Beneﬁ ts of CAD programs, alternately called com-
puter-assisted drafting programs, include their accu-
racy, repeatability and simplicity. In addition, the 
diagram ﬁ les can be inserted into other documents, 
including ﬁ nal crime reports. Figure 2.16 compares a 
typical hand-drawn diagram with one drawn with a CAD 
software program.
 
Crime Zone, a popular forensic diagramming applica-
tion, is easy to use and can create diagrams with great pre-
cision and attention to detail, giving the drawing greater 
credibility in court. Crime Zone’s 3-D graphics have been 
used to diagram the trajectory of bullets, to document the 
scene of a carjacking and to help a jury visualize the loca-
tions of witnesses, victims and suspects at the scene of a 
shooting (Figure 2.17).
 
Th e Vista FX drawing program, like many software 
packages, contains several versions, each with features 
geared toward diﬀ erent applications (Figure 2.18). For 
example, crash reconstruction programs would likely 
include a linear momentum analysis feature, calcula-
tors for deriving acceleration and deceleration rates 
and predrawn symbols of intersections and other driv-
ing- and road-related icons. In contrast, a crime scene 
investigation edition of the same general CAD package 
might oﬀ er a bloodstain-pattern analysis feature, bal-
listics data and predrawn symbols of bodies or various 
weapons.
 
Th e MapScenes software package has more than 7,000 
predrawn shapes and symbols, and can generate 3-D ani-
mation computer movies like those shown on CSI. A 3-D 
crime scene is illustrated in Figure 2.19.
 
Th e ﬁ nished drawing can be simple or complex, but it 
must represent the actual distances, objects and evidence 
contained in the rough sketch. Color designations and plas-
tic overlays to illustrate other phases of the investigation 
are often added. Th e drawing can be duplicated for other 
investigators and distributed to the prosecuting attorney. 
It is usually placed on white mounting board for display in 
court. A ﬁ nished scale drawing is illustrated in Figure 2.15.
COMPUTER-ASSISTED 
DRAWING
As evidenced throughout this entire chapter, 
computer technology has enhanced many of 
the processes and procedures involved in crime scene 
documentation. In the fourth edition of this text 
(1990), computer-aided design (CAD) was highlighted 
as a technological advance, a cutting-edge tool for crim-
inal investigators. Back then, cumbersome, confusing 
and complicated CAD software made it challenging for 
even the most computer-savvy investigators to fully 
implement this technology. However, drawing software 
for investigators has improved significantly, and today 
a plethora of user-friendly CAD programs are available: 
Crime Zone, Quick Scene, DeltaSphere-3000, iWitness, 
Linear Systems, MapScenes, ScenePD, SmartDraw, 
SmartRoads, Panoscan, Vista FX, HawkEye, VS Investi-
gator Suite, . . . and the list is sure to grow.

Speed and portability are two other features investi-
gators look for when selecting a CAD program. Portable 
data collection and drawing units save investigators’ 
time by rapidly generating accurate, scaled diagrams 
at crime scenes, thus reducing time spent measuring 
and diagramming and allowing more time to actually 
investigate.

SmartDraw 2007 Legal Edition contains more 
than 50,000 graphics and more than 800 templates, 
including many legal symbols and predrawn graph-
ics of objects unique to crime scenes. The layout is 
intuitive, and the functions are easily understood. 
The U.S. Department of Justice has purchased 25,000 
copies of the SmartDraw Legal Edition for use in all 
its ofﬁ ces (Ashley, 2007).

66 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
A scale drawing also is admissible if the investigating 
ofﬁ cer drew it or approved it after it was drawn and if 
it accurately represents the rough sketch. The rough 
sketch must remain available as evidence.
 
Well-prepared sketches and drawings help judges, 
juries, witnesses and other people visualize crime scenes. 
Th e responsibilities of an investigator in court are the 
focus of Chapter 21.
 
Ashley (2007, p.60) describes SmartDraw as “soft-
ware for the artistically challenged.”
ADMISSIBILITY OF SKETCHES 
AND DRAWINGS IN COURT
As with all other evidence, the investigator must 
be prepared to testify about the information 
contained in the sketch, the conditions under which it 
was made and the process used to construct it.
An admissible sketch is drawn or personally witnessed 
by an investigator and accurately portrays a crime scene.

CHAPTER 2 | Documenting the Crime Scene: Note Taking, Photographing and Sketching | 67
shots ﬁ rst because they are the most subject to alteration 
by weather and security violations. Categories of investiga-
tive photography include crime scene, surveillance, aerial, 
night, laboratory, lineup and mug shot.
 
After photographs are taken, they must be properly 
identiﬁ ed, ﬁ led and kept secure to be admissible as evi-
dence. In addition, rules of evidence dictate that photo-
graphs be material, relevant, competent, accurate, free of 
distortion and noninﬂ ammatory.
 
In addition to photographs, crime scene sketches are 
often used. A crime scene sketch assists in (1) interviewing 
and interrogating people, (2) preparing the investigative 
report and (3) presenting the case in court. Photographs, 
sketches and written notes are often needed to provide a 
clear picture of the scene.
 
Sketch the scene of a serious crime or crash after 
photographing it and before moving anything. Include all 
relevant objects and evidence. Materials needed for mak-
ing the rough sketch include paper, pencil, long steel mea-
suring tape, carpenter-type ruler, straightedge, clipboard, 
eraser, compass, protractor and thumbtacks. Th e steps 
involved in sketching include (1) observing and planning; 
(2) measuring distances and outlining the general area; (3) 
plotting objects and evidence within the outline; (4) tak-
ing notes and recording details; (5) identifying the sketch 
with a legend and a scale; and (6) reassessing the sketch.
 
Plotting methods useful in locating objects and evi-
dence include rectangular-coordinate, baseline, triangula-
tion and compass-point. A cross-projection sketch shows 
the ﬂ oor and walls in the same plane. An admissible sketch 
is drawn or personally witnessed by an investigator and 
accurately portrays a crime scene. A scale drawing also is 
admissible if the investigating oﬃ  cer drew it or approved 
it after it was drawn and if it accurately represents the 
rough sketch. Th e rough sketch must remain available 
as evidence. Investigative notes are a permanent written 
record of the facts of a case to be used in further investiga-
tion, in writing reports and in prosecuting the case.
 
After completing the sketch, record in your notes the 
lighting conditions, colors, people present at the scene 
and all other information that cannot be sketched. Th en 
place a legend in the lower corner of the sketch, outside 
the room or area outline. Identify the scene completely—
the location, type of crime and case number. Include the 
scale and an arrow indicating north pointing to the top 
of the sketch. Include the name of the person making the 
sketch. Before leaving the scene, make sure nothing has 
been overlooked. Keep the sketch secure, because it is the 
basis for the ﬁ nished scale drawing and may be needed as 
evidence in court.
 
Th e ﬁ nished scale drawing is done in ink on a 
good grade of paper and is drawn to scale using exact 
Investigative notes and reports are critical parts of a crim-
inal investigation. Notes are a permanent written record 
of the facts of a case to be used in further investigation, 
in writing reports and in prosecuting the case. Start tak-
ing notes as soon as possible after receiving an initial call 
to respond and continue recording information as it is 
received throughout the investigation.
 
Record all relevant information concerning the crime, 
the crime scene and the investigation, including informa-
tion that helps answer the questions Who? What? Where? 
When? How? and Why? Write brief, legible, abbreviated 
notes that others can understand. Make them complete, 
accurate, speciﬁ c, factual, clear, well-organized and leg-
ible. After you have written your report, ﬁ le your notes in 
a secure location readily accessible to you or destroy them 
according to department policy. Original notes are legally 
admissible in court and may be used to testify from or to 
refresh your memory. Take to court only those notes that 
pertain to the case.
 
Photography, one of the ﬁ rst investigative techniques 
to be used at a crime scene, helps establish that a crime was 
committed and helps trace the occurrence of the crime. 
Photographs and videotapes reproduce the crime scene in 
detail for presentation to the prosecution, defense, wit-
nesses, judge and jury in court and are used in investigat-
ing, prosecuting and police training.
 
Photography has become increasingly important in 
criminal investigation because it can immediately pre-
serve evidence, accurately represent the crime scene and 
evidence, create interest and increase attention to testi-
mony. However, photographs also have disadvantages: 
Th ey are not selective, do not show actual distances and 
may be distorted and damaged by mechanical errors in 
shooting or processing. At a minimum, have available and 
be skilled in operating a 35-mm SLR camera (ﬁ lm or digi-
tal), an instant-print camera, a press camera, a ﬁ ngerprint 
camera and video record/playback equipment.
 
Videos (videocassettes and DVDs) are now well 
established as an investigative tool. Videos can be viewed 
immediately, accurately represent the crime scene and 
evidence, are able to show distance more clearly than do 
photos, have sound capability to more fully document 
what is being seen and are cost-eﬀ ective. Th e disadvan-
tages of videos, however, center around the mistaken 
belief that no training in videotaping is necessary, which 
leads to poor video quality and a diminished value in the 
video’s documentation of the crime scene.
 
Take photographs and video of the entire crime scene 
before anything is disturbed, and avoid inaccuracies and 
distortions. First, photograph the general area, then speciﬁ c 
areas and ﬁ nally speciﬁ c objects of evidence. Take exterior

ne of the most important skills investigators must develop is report writing. 
Th e remainder of this volume discusses in detail how evidence is located and 
processed; how witnesses, victims, suspects and others are questioned; and how 
speciﬁ c cases are investigated. Report writing is included here because the report 
captures the essentials of an investigation.
O
Do You Know?

72 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
THE IMPORTANCE OF REPORTS
Orlando W. Wilson and Roy C. McLaren wrote in 
Police Administration nearly 30 years ago: “Almost 
everything that a police oﬃ  cer does must be reduced to writ-
ing. What is written is often the determining factor in 
whether a suspect is arrested in the ﬁ rst place and, if he is 
arrested, whether he is convicted and sentenced. Th e con-
tents of written reports, in fact, often have great bearing in 
life-and-death situations. To say that oﬃ  cers need to be pro-
ﬁ cient in report writing is an understatement.”
 
Another reason report-writing skills are so important 
is that as much as 20 percent of frontline oﬃ  cers’ time is 
spent writing reports (Brewer, 2007, p.36).
 
Th e importance of well-written reports becomes obvi-
ous when you realize that your reports are used, not sim-
ply ﬁ led away. If investigative reports were not required 
for eﬃ  cient law enforcement, you would not have to write 
them. 
Reports are permanent written records of important facts 
of a case to be used in the future and are a crucial and 
necessary cog in the wheel of justice.
 
Well-written reports further the cause of justice and 
reﬂ ect positively on your education, your competence and 
your professionalism. In fact: “Your reputation and that 
of your department often rest on your written words” 
(Arp, 2007, p.100).
 
Figure 3.1 shows the typical path of an investigative 
report. Th e number of times the report loops between the 
supervisor and the oﬃ  cer, or between the prosecutor and 
the oﬃ  cer, depends on how carefully (or carelessly) the 
oﬃ  cer constructs the report to begin with.
 
Most law enforcement oﬃ  cers submit their reports 
for prosecution with concern about the outcome but 
without much thought about the wheels they’ve started 
in motion. Th is is understandable, for they’ve done their 
jobs and many more cases wait to be investigated. But 
what happens when they haven’t really done their jobs? 
When their reports are distorted or incomplete (as many 
are) because of poor writing? Th e results cost the taxpay-
ers in wasted personnel hours, and they breed disaster 
in the courtroom, if the case even makes it that far. Poor 
police report writing can jeopardize eﬀ ective criminal 
prosecution.
 
Th e little things in a report can have major conse-
quences for the disposition of a case. Consider this all-
too-common example: In one criminal case the reporting 
oﬃ  cer, using the passive voice, wrote, “Th e weapon was 
found in the bushes where the suspect had thrown it.” 
He did not clarify this statement elsewhere in his report. 
Expectedly, the prosecuting attorney subpoenaed the 
reporting oﬃ  cer to testify at the preliminary hearing. 
Unfortunately, the reporting oﬃ  cer’s testimony revealed 
that his partner, not he, had observed the suspect’s 
action and had retrieved the weapon. Th e partner was 
unavailable to testify on short notice. Without her tes-
timony, the necessary elements of the crime could not 
be established and the case was dismissed, having to be 
reﬁ led. Th e personnel hours expended at the time of the 
dismissal, by witnesses, secretaries, clerks, attorneys 
and the judge, were virtually wasted because the whole 
Retrieving and recording information are essential steps in 
constructing a sound report. Improved technology in police cars, 
such as this laptop computer equipped with air card used by 
the Putnam County (Florida) Sheriff’s Ofﬁ ce, provides of a total 
wireless data solution, including improved productivity, increased 
response times, enhanced customer service, fast access to 
information when on the road and, ultimately, more effective 
reports. (© Joel Gordon)

CHAPTER 3 | Writing Effective Reports | 73
process had to be repeated. Th e reporting oﬃ  cer could 
have avoided the problem at the onset through use of 
the active voice, which would have provided clariﬁ cation. 
Sadly, this basic writing error is not an isolated example; 
it, and others like it, slip through the system daily, caus-
ing delays in the judicial process and depleting dwindling 
budgets.
 
To better understand how to write eﬀ ective reports, 
consider ﬁ rst how they may be used.
USES OF REPORTS
R eports are permanent records of all important 
facts in a case. Th ey are a stockpile of informa-
tion to be drawn on by all individuals on a law enforce-
ment team. Th ey are an aid to individual law enforcement 
oﬃ  cers and investigators, supervisors, administrators, 
the courts, other governmental agencies, reporters and 
private individuals. Further, a department’s eﬃ  ciency is 
directly related to the quality of its reports and reporting 
procedures.
 
Consider the case of an oﬃ  cer called to the scene of a 
hit-and-run. Th e initial accident report would be used to 
continue the investigation of the oﬀ ense. If the oﬀ ender 
were apprehended, the report would be used by the pros-
ecuting attorneys in preparing the case, by the respond-
ing police oﬃ  cer when testifying in court, by the judge in 
determining the facts of the case and by the jury if a trial 
resulted. Th e report might also be used by the department 
in determining where dangerous intersections exist and in 
making future plans. Additionally, an oﬃ  cer’s supervisor 
could use the report to evaluate the investigating oﬃ  cer’s 
performance. If the oﬃ  cer failed to conduct a thorough 
investigation, this lack of thoroughness would show in 
the report.

Public vs. Private
Each state’s data privacy laws dictate how
information contained in a police report should be
handled: what information can be retained, what data
can be released and when, to whom such data can be
released, etc.
In general, if releasing certain information would
hamper or otherwise jeopardize an investigation,
police may withhold such data from the media/public
until such time as they see fit.
Some cases (e.g., those involving juveniles) or certain
details of a case (such as those of criminal sexual
assaults) are often not made public, although the court
can typically order any case information be made
public if it so chooses.
If a case report remains “private,” it may still be
accessed by some, such as other officers,
investigators, attorneys, and prosecutors.8
1 Often the report is simply handwritten by the officer, given to the shift supervisor for a cursory review/initialing, and then sent off for transcription before going to an assigning supervisor.
2 Assigning supervisor is typically of higher rank (lieutenant, captain, etc.).
3 In smaller departments, the case may go to a generalized investigator. In larger departments, several investigative units may exist (homicide, arson, motor vehicle theft, etc.).
4 Case can proceed to prosecutor with or without an arrest having been made.
5 A rejection does not necessarily mean case is not prosecutable at a later date. It means only that a complaint is not issued at that time.
6 Who has access to the report(s) at trial varies by state. For example, in Minnesota, the judge and jury do not automatically receive the report(s).
7 The report itself is not evidence, but any testimony the officer/investigator provides based on the content of a report becomes part of the trial record (testimonial evidence).
8 Check with your state’s data privacy law. Laws vary from state to state regarding what can be retained, what must be released, and when information must be released. Consideration must also be given to
   whether or not release of information would hamper any ongoing investigations.

74 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Reports are read by
• • Other ofﬁ cers.
• • Supervisors.
• • Attorneys and judges.
• • Jurors.
• • City ofﬁ cials.
• • Insurance adjusters and investigators.
• • Citizens.
• • Reporters.
 
You should neither talk down to your audience nor 
try to make your report appear “more professional” by 
using bureaucratic, complicated language. Keep your 
reports straightforward and reader friendly, focusing on 
the need to express the facts of the case rather than trying 
to impress the audience with your expansive vocabulary. 
Writing to impress rather than express is a common prob-
lem with many investigative reports. 
COMMON PROBLEMS WITH 
MANY POLICE REPORTS
Writing eﬀ ective investigation reports is a skill 
that must be learned and practiced just as any 
other skill necessary in police work, such as ﬁ rearms use, 
self-defense techniques and interview methods. Unfortu-
nately, some departments have yet to develop a full appre-
ciation of the beneﬁ ts of well-written reports. In these 
agencies, reports are viewed as tedious time wasters that 
keep investigators from more signiﬁ cant tasks. Field train-
ing oﬃ  cers encourage new recruits to take report short-
cuts, while administrators look the other way, happy to 
avoid the overtime that can occur with thorough, accu-
rate, complex reports. Amid such an environment, eﬀ ec-
tive report writing skills are neither taught nor recognized 
as important and problems in the department’s police 
reports abound.
Among the common problems in police reports are
• • Confusing or unclear sentences.
• • Conclusions, assumptions and opinions.
• • Extreme wordiness and overuse of police jargon and 
abbreviations.
• • Missing or incomplete information.
• • Misspelled words and grammatical or mechanical 
errors.
• • Referring to “above” information.
Reports are used to
• • Examine the past.
• • Keep other police ofﬁ cers informed.
• • Continue investigations.
• • Prepare court cases.
• • Provide the courts with relevant facts.
• • Coordinate law enforcement activities.
• • Plan for future law enforcement services.
• • Evaluate individual ofﬁ cer and department 
performance.
• • Refresh a witness’s memory about what he or she 
said occurred.
• • Refresh the investigating ofﬁ cer’s memory during 
the trial.
• • Compile statistics on crime in a given 
jurisdiction.
• • Provide information to insurance investigators.
 
Reports are critical in examining police performance 
and investigating potentially illegal police practices 
such as racial proﬁ ling. Many departments have begun 
voluntarily augmenting their traﬃ  c stop reports in an 
eﬀ ort to shed light on allegations of racial proﬁ ling. 
Although some agencies are embracing the initiative as 
a way to seize control of their traﬃ  c data and build con-
ﬁ dence in the fairness of their policing, other depart-
ments are opting out of the program, claiming that the 
more extensive reports add to their already excessive 
paperwork load. Critics of the program believe oﬃ  cers 
might be dissuaded from making legitimate traﬃ  c stops 
because of the undue amount of paperwork these will 
generate.
 
Th e various uses of reports make it obvious that they 
will be read by many diﬀ erent people for many diﬀ erent 
reasons. Th ese people make up your audience.
THE AUDIENCE
What you write may be read by other oﬃ  cers, 
your supervisor, lawyers, judges, jurors, 
social workers, city oﬃ  cials, insurance adjusters and 
investigators, citizens and reporters—people from dif-
ferent backgrounds and ﬁ elds who have varying degrees 
of familiarity with legal terms and police jargon. Cer-
tainly, most of your audience will not have been present 
at the crime scene. Th erefore, you must communicate 
clearly to these numerous readers what happened, when 
and how.

CHAPTER 3 | Writing Effective Reports | 75
 
Steps 2 and 3 may be repeated several times in a report 
on a case where you talk to several witnesses and victims.
A Brief Look at Law Enforcement Report Forms 
Although this chapter focuses on writing narrative reports, 
many departments use box-style law enforcement report 
forms for certain oﬀ enses and incidents. Law enforcement 
report forms vary greatly in format, and the example 
shown in  Figure 3.2 is only one type of forms in use.
 
Hess and Orthmann (2008, p.iv) state, “Report forms . . . 
contain boxes or separate category sections, e.g., property loss 
section, for placement of descriptive information, addresses 
and phone numbers of those involved. It is unnecessary to 
repeat this information in the narrative unless it is needed for 
clarity because it tends to interrupt the ﬂ ow of words and clut-
ter the narrative.” In contrast, narrative reports that do not use 
the box-style format include descriptive information, addresses 
and phone numbers within the body of the narrative.
 
Read the following excerpt from a narrative report, 
noting the underlined descriptive information.
I talked to the victim, Betty Jones, 355 Rose St., Albany, 
New York, phone 555-9002. Jones told me that her 
 diamond ring was taken during the burglary. Th e ring 
was a 2-carat diamond stone, platinum setting, with the 
initials B.A.J. inside the band, valued at $11,500.00.
 
If these data were, instead, to be formatted into a 
box-style report, the underlined descriptive information, 
address and phone number would be deleted from the 
narrative unless that information was needed for clarity, as 
shown in the following excerpt:
Th e victim, Betty Jones, told me that her diamond ring 
was taken during the burglary.
CHARACTERISTICS OF EFFECTIVE REPORTS: 
CONTENT AND FORM
In addition to a well-structured narrative, an eﬀ ective 
report exhibits several other characteristics, which gener-
ally fall into one of two areas: content, or what is said, 
and form, or how it is written.
The effective report writer attends to both content 
and form because they are equally important in a 
 well-written report.
 
Th e content of an eﬀ ective report is factual, accurate, 
objective and complete. Th e form of a well-written report is 
concise, clear, grammatically and mechanically correct and 
written in Standard English. An eﬀ ective report is also orga-
nized into paragraphs and written in the past tense, using 
the ﬁ rst person and active voice. Finally, a  well-written 
 
Having brieﬂ y looked at the “don’ts” of report writing, 
the discussion now turns to the “do’s” and how to craft a 
well-written report.
THE WELL-WRITTEN REPORT: 
FROM START TO FINISH
Report writing is a skill that takes time and prac-
tice to develop. It is not a talent—you are not 
expected to write entertaining literary masterpieces, full of 
insight and originality. Instead, to write an eﬀ ective report, 
you must organize your notes and adhere to some basic 
standards of written English regarding content and form.
ORGANIZING INFORMATION
A cornerstone of good report writing is organization. Good 
reports do not just happen. Th e writer plans in advance in 
what order the information should be written. Too many 
oﬃ  cers simply sit down and start writing without giving 
any thought to how the report should ﬂ ow, which results 
in more time spent rewriting and revising later. To use your 
time most eﬃ  ciently, ﬁ rst make an informal outline. Next, 
list what you want to include under each heading in the 
outline. Review your notes and number each statement to 
match a heading in your outline. For example, if Section III.C 
of the outline is headed “Description of Suspect #2,” write 
III.C in the margin wherever Suspect #2 is described in your 
notes. List the facts of the investigation in chronological 
order, beginning with the response to the call and conclud-
ing with the end of the investigation. If the report is long 
(more than four pages), use headings to guide the reader—
for example, “Initial Response,” “Crime-Scene Conditions,” 
“Photographs Taken,” “Evidence,” “Witnesses,” “Suspects” 
and so on. After you complete the outline and determine 
where each note ﬁ ts, you are ready to begin writing.
STRUCTURING THE NARRATIVE
Usually the narrative, the “story” of the case in chrono-
logical order, is structured as follows:
 1. Th e opening paragraph of a police report states the time, 
date, type of incident and how you became involved.
 2. Th e next paragraph contains what you were told by 
the victim or witness. For each person talked to, use a 
separate paragraph.
 3. Next record what you did based on the information 
you received.
 4. Th e ﬁ nal paragraph states the disposition of the case.

about them. An opinion, however, reﬂ ects personal beliefs, 
on which there is seldom agreement. For example, how do 
you resolve the diﬀ erences between two people arguing 
over whether pie tastes better than cake? You can’t. It’s 
simply a matter of personal preference.
 
Inferences (conclusions) can prove valuable in a 
report, provided they are based on suﬃ  cient evidence. 
Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between facts and 
inferences. One way to tell them apart is to ask the ques-
tion “Can the statement be simply proven true or false, or 
do I need other facts to make it reasonable?” For example, 
if you wanted to verify the statement “Th e driver of the 
truck was drunk,” you would need to supply several facts 
to support your inference. One such fact might be that 
he had a blood alcohol content higher than 0.10. Other 
facts might include your observations, such as his slurred 
speech, his red and watery eyes, ﬁ ve empty beer cans 
behind the driver’s seat and the strong odor of an alco-
holic beverage on the driver’s breath.
 
An inference is not really true or false; it is sound or 
unsound (believable or not believable). And the only way 
to make an inference sound (believable) is to provide facts 
to support it. One way to ensure that your inference is 
clearly an inference, instead of a fact, would be to use the 
word apparently or appeared (e.g., “Th e driver appeared to 
be under the inﬂ uence of alcohol.”).
 
Inferences are also referred to as conclusionary 
 language. Avoid conclusionary language by showing, not 
telling. For example, do not write, “Th e man could not walk 
a straight line.” You do not know what another person can 
or cannot do. A more factual way to report this would be 
“Th e man did not walk a straight line.” Even better would 
be “Th e man stepped 18 inches to the right of the line 
twice and 12 inches to the left of the line three times.” 
Consider this account by Rutledge (2000, pp.110–111):
I once got into a drunk driving trial where, according 
to the arresting oﬃ  cer, the defendant had “repeatedly 
refused” to take a chemical test. Th e defendant was 
named Sanchez, and at trial he insisted, through a court 
report is audience focused, legible and submitted on time. 
Table 3.1 illustrates the diﬀ erences between content and 
form as they relate to investigative reports.
An effective report is factual, accurate, objective, com-
plete, concise, clear, grammatically and mechanically cor-
rect, written in Standard English, organized into paragraphs 
and written in the past tense; uses the ﬁ rst person and 
active voice; and is audience focused and legible, leaving 
the reader with a positive impression of the writer’s com-
petence. A well-written report is also submitted on time.
 
Facts, opinions and inferences were introduced in 
Chapter 1. Investigators must diﬀ erentiate between these 
three types of statements: “Th e ability of investigators to 
explain both verbally and in writing how inferences (e.g., 
clues, evidence, etc.) lead them to draw logical and reason-
able conclusions (e.g., probable cause, facts, etc.) remains a 
critical skill in investigative work” (Jetmore, 2007, p.22).
Factual Th e basic purpose of any investigation report 
is to record the facts. A fact is a statement that can be 
proven. (It may be proven false, but it is still classiﬁ ed as 
a factual statement.) Th e truthfulness or accuracy of facts 
will be discussed shortly. First, consider how to clearly dis-
tinguish between three basic types of statements.
Fact: 
A statement that can be proven.
Example: 
 The man has a bulge in his black leather 
jacket pocket.
Inference: 
A conclusion based on reasoning.
Example: 
The man is probably carrying a gun.
Opinion: 
A personal belief.
Example: 
Black leather jackets are cool.
 
A well-written report is factual. It does not contain 
opinions. You can discuss and debate facts and inferences 
logically and reasonably and come to some agreement

Conclusionary language may also lead to inaccuracies 
in your report.
Accurate To be useful, facts must be accurate. An eﬀ ec-
tive report accurately records the correct time and date, cor-
rect names of all persons involved, correct phone numbers 
and addresses, and exact descriptions of the crime scene, 
property, vehicles and suspects involved. Have people spell 
their names. Repeat spellings and numbers for veriﬁ cation. 
Recheck measurements. Be sure of the accuracy of your 
facts. An inaccurately recorded license number may result 
in losing a witness or suspect. Inaccurate measurement or 
recording of the distance and location of skid marks, bullet 
holes or bodies may lead to wrong conclusions.
 
To be accurate, you must be speciﬁ c. For example, 
it is better to say, “Th e car was traveling in excess of 90 
mph” than to say, “Th e car was traveling fast.” It is more 
accurate to describe a suspect as “approximately 6-foot-6” 
than to describe him as “tall.”
 
You must have the facts in the case correct. If your 
report says four men were involved in a robbery but in 
reality, three men and a woman were involved, your report 
would be inaccurate. If you are unsure of the gender of the 
individuals involved in an incident, identify them as “peo-
ple,” “suspects,” “witnesses,” or whatever the case may be. 
If your facts come from the statement of a witness rather 
than from your own observation, say so in your report.
 
Phrases such as “He saw what happened” or “He heard 
what happened” are conclusionary and may lead to inaccura-
cies in your report. People can be looking directly at something 
and not see it, either because they are simply not paying atten-
tion or because they have terrible vision. Th e same is true of 
hearing. Again, you do not know what another person sees or 
hears. Your report should say, “He said he saw what happened” 
or “He looked directly at the man committing the crime.”
 
Another common conclusionary statement found in 
police reports is, “Th e check was signed by John Doe.” 
interpreter, that he neither spoke nor understood any 
English. His defense that he couldn’t possibly refuse an 
English-language request when he couldn’t even under-
stand it sold well with the jury, especially after the 
oﬃ  cer had to admit that he didn’t recall exactly how or 
in what speciﬁ c words the defendant had “refused” a 
test. Th e cop couldn’t live with his conclusionary report. 
Neither could I. Th e defendant lived with it very com-
fortably, and he owed his acquittal directly to the same 
oﬃ  cer who had arrested him. Ironic?
 
We would have been much better oﬀ  if the cop had 
never used the conclusionary word “refused,” but had 
instead married the defendant to his own words! Th e 
report could have helped the prosecution, instead of 
the defense, if it had been written like this:
 
After I explained the need to take a chemical test,  Sanchez 
said, in Spanish-accented English, “Screw you, cop. . . . I ain’t 
taking no test, man. Why don’t you take it yourself?” I told him 
he had to take a test or his license would be suspended. He said, 
“I don’t need no license to drive, man. I know lots of people 
drive without a license. You ain’t scared me, man, and I ain’t 
taking no stupid test. I’ll beat this thing.”
 
See the diﬀ erence? Not a single conclusion or inter-
pretation. Th e reader gets to “hear” the same things the 
writer heard. Th e oﬃ  cer could have lived with some-
thing like that—the defendant couldn’t.
Th e following conclusionary statements can also jeopar-
dize the eﬀ ectiveness and value of investigative reports:
• • “Th ey denied any involvement in the crime.”
• • “She confessed to seven more arsons.”
• • “He admitted breaking into the warehouse.”
• • “He consented to a search of the trunk.”
• • “She waived her rights per Miranda.”
 
Table 3.2 presents alternatives to conclusionary words 
and phrases that will make reports more factual and, thus, 
more eﬀ ective and valuable.

training we spent 4 hours learning to resemble a ﬁ rearm 
and the remainder of the time learning defective driving.”
 
Keep to the facts. Include all facts, even those that may 
appear to be damaging to your case. Objectivity is attained 
by including both sides of the account. Slanting, that is, 
including only one side of a story or only facts that tend to 
prove or support the oﬃ  cer’s theory, can also make a report 
nonobjective. A good report includes both sides of an inci-
dent when possible. Even when facts tend to go against your 
theory about what happened, you are obligated to include 
them. Omitting important facts is not objective. Recall the 
previous discussion of the importance of including both 
inculpatory and exculpatory statements in reports: “Th ere 
are signiﬁ cant legal and ethical reasons why police oﬃ  cers 
should include all known material statements and evidence 
in reports submitted to the prosecutor. Due process disclo-
sure of exculpatory evidence must be determined and made 
by the prosecutor, and ‘tainted’ evidence may still be fully 
admissible, or useful for limited purposes. Full reporting 
helps avoid civil liability, reversals of convictions, and mis-
carriage of justice” (Rutledge, 2007, p.71).
Complete Information kept in the reporting oﬃ  cer’s 
head is of no value to anyone else involved in the case. 
Scarry (2007, p.68) points out, “What oﬃ  cers write in their 
report stays with them forever.” Th erefore, she recom-
mends, “Every report should reﬂ ect the basic details of the 
event, and the important details must be included. Why? 
Simply put, in today’s litigious society, police oﬃ  cers and 
their agencies are easy targets for civil lawsuits, particularly 
oﬃ  cers involved in a shooting or other incident ending in 
death or great bodily harm.” She (p.69) contends, “If it’s 
not documented in the police report, a savvy attorney rep-
resenting the suspect will always argue that it never hap-
pened.” Scarry (p.71) concludes, “When it comes to writing 
police reports, oﬃ  cers should always strive to document 
all injuries they receive during any incident, even if it’s a 
minor injury; record any unusual statements germane to 
the event; and explain why the oﬃ  cers took certain actions, 
particularly with respect to the need to use force.”
 
An eﬀ ective report contains answers to at least six 
basic questions: Who? What? When? Where? How? and 
Why? Th e who, what, when and where questions should be 
answered by factual statements. Th e how and why state-
ments may require inferences. When this is the case, 
clearly label the statements as inferences. Th is is espe-
cially true when answering the question of cause. To avoid 
slanting the report, record all possible causes no matter 
how implausible they may seem at the time.
 
If a form is used for your reports, all applicable blanks 
at the top of the form should be ﬁ lled in. Certain agencies 
require a slash mark, the abbreviation N.A. (not applica-
ble) or the abbreviation UNK (unknown) to be placed in 
any box that does not contain information.
Unless you saw John Doe sign the check, the correct 
 (accurate) statement would be, “Th e check was signed 
John Doe.” Th e little two-letter word by can create tre-
mendous problems for you on the witness stand.
 
Vague, imprecise words have no place in police 
reports. Th e following words and phrases should not be 
used because they are not speciﬁ c: a few, several, many, 
frequently, often. Finally, instead of writing contacted, be 
speciﬁ c by using telephoned, visited, e-mailed or whatever 
particular mode of communication was involved.
 
Another common mistake often found in police reports is 
using the phrase the PC for the stop, referring to probable cause: 
“It should be clear that PC is not needed for a stop—only 
for an arrest. All the Fourth Amendment requires for a stop 
(detention) is reasonable suspicion” (Rutledge, 2008, p.66). 
Police oﬃ  cers who write about “the PC for the stop” feed the 
confusion of legal standards that may already be cloudy to 
some prosecutors, the defense attorneys and trial judges.
Objective You have seen that reports must be factual. 
It is possible, however, to include only factual statements 
in a report and still not be objective. Being objective 
means being non-opinionated, fair and impartial. Lack of 
objectivity can result from either of two things: poor word 
choice or omission of facts.
 
Word choice is an often overlooked—yet very 
 important—aspect of report writing. Consider, for example, 
the diﬀ erence in eﬀ ect achieved by these three sentences:
 
Th e man cried.
 
Th e man wept.
 
Th e man blubbered.
 
Although you want to be speciﬁ c, you must also be 
aware of the eﬀ ect of the words you use. Words that have 
little emotional eﬀ ect, for example, cried, are called deno-
tative words. Th e denotative meaning of a word is its 
objective meaning. In contrast, words that do have an emo-
tional eﬀ ect are called connotative words, for example, 
wept, blubbered. Th e connotative meaning of a word com-
prises its positive or negative overtones. In the three ear-
lier sentences, only the ﬁ rst sentence is truly objective. Th e 
second sentence makes the reader feel sympathetic toward 
the man. Th e third makes the reader unsympathetic.
 
Likewise, derogatory, biased terms referring to a per-
son’s race, ethnicity, religion or sexual preference have 
no place in police reports. A defense attorney will cer-
tainly capitalize on words with emotional overtones and 
attempt to show bias. Even the use of claimed rather than 
stated can be used to advantage by a defense attorney, 
who might suggest that the oﬃ  cer’s use of claimed implies 
the oﬃ  cer did not believe the statement.
 
Also, use the correct word. Do not confuse words that 
are similar, or you can be made to appear ridiculous. For 
example, this sentence in an oﬃ  cer’s report would proba-
bly cast suspicion on the oﬃ  cer’s intelligence: “During our 

CHAPTER 3 | Writing Effective Reports | 81
• • Th ree cars were reported stolen by the Los Angeles 
police yesterday.
• • Police begin campaign to run down jaywalkers.
• • Squad helps dog bite victim.
 
Rewrite such sentences so that only one interpreta-
tion is possible. For example, the ﬁ rst sentence in the pre-
vious list might read, “Oﬃ  cers who volunteer will paint 
the locker room after it is completely plastered.” Th e third 
sentence might read, “According to the Los Angeles police, 
three cars were reported stolen yesterday.”
 
Follow these guidelines to make your reports clearer:
• • Use speciﬁ c, concrete facts and details. Compare the fol-
lowing statements and determine which is clearer:
1. Th e car sped away and turned the corner.
2. Th e gold 1996 Cadillac Fleetwood pulled away from 
the curb, accelerated to approximately 65 mph and 
then turned oﬀ  First Street onto Brooklyn Boulevard.
 
 
 Th e second statement is clearer because it con-
tains concrete facts and details.
• • Keep descriptive words and phrases as close as possible to 
the words they describe. Compare the following state-
ments and determine which is clearer.
1. He replaced the gun into the holster which he had 
just ﬁ red.
2. He replaced the gun, which he had just ﬁ red, into 
the holster.
 
 
 Th e second statement is clearer because the 
phrase “which he had just ﬁ red” is placed close to 
the word it modiﬁ es (gun).
• • Use diagrams and sketches when a description is complex. 
Th is is especially true in reports of crashes, homicides 
and burglaries. Th e diagrams do not have to be artistic 
masterpieces. Th ey should, however, be in approxi-
mate proportion and should help the reader follow the 
narrative portion of the report. As noted in Chapter 2, 
several software programs for computer-assisted dia-
grams are now readily available.
• • Do not use uncommon abbreviations. Some abbrevia-
tions (such as Mr., Dr., Ave., St., Feb., Aug., NY, CA) 
are so commonly used that they require no explana-
tion. Other abbreviations, however, are commonly 
used only in law enforcement. Do not use these in 
your reports because not all readers will understand 
them. Confusion can result if two people have diﬀ er-
ent interpretations of an abbreviation. For example, 
what does S.O.B. mean to you? To most people it has a 
negative meaning. But for people in the health ﬁ eld, it 
means “short of breath.” Consider the following exam-
ple as information that can be written in your notes 
but should not appear, as such, in a report: Unk/W/F/, 
nfd, driving Fd/4DRed, nfd.
 
Each speciﬁ c type of crime requires diﬀ erent infor-
mation. Sections 3, 4 and 5 discuss speciﬁ c oﬀ enses and 
contain checklists outlining information that should be 
included in your report.
Concise Being concise means making every word count 
without leaving out important facts. Avoid wordiness; 
length alone does not ensure quality. Some reports can be 
written in half a page; others require 12 or even 20 pages. 
No speciﬁ c length can be prescribed, but strive to include 
all relevant information in as few words as possible.
 
You can reduce wordiness in two basic ways: (1) Leave 
out unnecessary information and (2) use as few words as 
possible to record the necessary facts. For example, do 
not write, “Th e car was blue in color”; write “Th e car was 
blue.” A phrase such as “information that is of a conﬁ den-
tial nature” should be recognized as a wordy way of saying 
“conﬁ dential information.”
 
Do not make the mistake of equating conciseness 
with brevity. Being brief is not the same as being concise. 
For example, compare
Brief 
She drove a car.
Concise 
 She drove a maroon 1992 Chevrolet 
Caprice.
Wordy 
 She drove a car that was a 1992 Chevro-
let Caprice and was maroon in color.
 
Avoiding wordiness does not mean eliminating 
details; it means eliminating empty words and phrases. 
Consider these examples of how to make wordy phrases 
more concise:

Table 3.3 lists more natural-sounding alternatives for 
wordy, artiﬁ cial phrases.
Clear An investigation report should have only one 
interpretation. Two people should be able to read the 
report and come up with the same word-picture and 
understanding of the events. Make certain your sentences 
can be read only one way. For example, consider the fol-
lowing unclear sentences:
• • When completely plastered, oﬃ  cers who volunteer 
will paint the locker room.
• • Miami police kill a man with a machete.

CHAPTER 3 | Writing Effective Reports | 83
 
Use caution when relying on grammar- and spell-checker 
programs to ﬁ nd mistakes in computerized documents. For 
example, if an investigator wrote that a victim of an assault 
was unable to be interviewed because “she had lapsed into a 
comma,” or that a suspect had been restrained because “he 
was acting erotically,” when what the writer meant to say was 
“coma” and “erratically,” respectively, the reader might ques-
tion the investigator’s intelligence or attention to detail.
Written in Standard English People often disagree 
about what Standard English is. And the standards between 
spoken and written English diﬀ er. For example, if you 
were to say, “I’m gonna go walkin’ in the mornin’,” it would 
probably sound all right. People often drop the “g” when 
they speak. In writing, however, this is not acceptable.
 
Just as there are rules for spelling, capitalization and 
punctuation, there are rules for what words are used when. 
For example, it is standard to say “he doesn’t” rather than 
“he don’t”; “I don’t have any” rather than “I ain’t got 
none”; “he and I are partners” rather than “him and me 
are partners.”
 
Your experience with English will often tell you what 
is standard and what is not—especially if you have lived 
in surroundings in which Standard English is used. If you 
speak Standard English, you will probably also write in 
Standard English. But that is not always true.
Paragraphs As discussed earlier, in structuring the 
narrative and making your report clear, eﬀ ective writers 
use paragraphs to guide the reader. Keep the paragraphs 
short (usually 100 words or less). Skip a line to indicate the 
beginning of a new paragraph. Discuss only one subject in 
each paragraph. Start a new paragraph when you change 
speakers, locations, time or ideas—for example, when you 
go from observations to descriptions to statements.
 
Paragraphs are reader friendly, guiding the reader 
through your report. Most paragraphs should be 5 to 6 
sentences, although they may be a single sentence or as 
many as 10 or 15 sentences on occasion.
Past Tense Write in the past tense throughout the 
report. Past-tense writing uses verbs that show that 
events have already occurred. Your report contains what 
was true at the time you took your notes. Use of present 
 
 
 Instead, write out, I saw an unknown white 
female (no further description available) driving a 
red Ford 4-door (no further description available).
 
Use only abbreviations common to everyone.
• • Use short sentences, well organized into short para-
graphs. Short sentences are easier to read. Likewise, 
paragraphs should be relatively short, usually 5 to 10 
sentences. Each question to be answered in the report 
should have its own paragraph. Th e report should be 
organized logically. Most commonly, it begins with 
when and where and then tells who and what. Th e what 
should be in chronological order—that is, going from 
beginning to end without skipping back and forth.
Grammatically and Mechanically Correct  If you 
were to hear the words “Your chances of being promoted 
are good if you can write eﬀ ective reports,” you would 
probably feel diﬀ erently than if you were to read the same 
words written like this: “yur chanses of bein promottid 
are gud if you kin rite afectiv riports.” Th e mechanics—
spelling, capitalization and punctuation—involved in 
translating ideas and spoken words into written words are 
important. Mistakes in spelling, punctuation, capitaliza-
tion and grammar give the impression that the writer is 
careless, uneducated or stupid—maybe all three!
 
Arp (2007, p.101) contends, “Spelling is the most impor-
tant part of writing. Even if the structure of your paragraph 
leaves a little to be desired, if you spell everything correctly, 
the reader will have some forgiveness. But not if your spell-
ing is bad!” He points out that many oﬃ  cers make the mis-
take of using words that are too complicated: “A good rule to 
follow is that if you can’t spell it, don’t use it.”
 
Use a dictionary and a grammar book if in doubt about 
how to write something. Th e dictionary can tell you how 
to spell a word and whether it should be capitalized and 
how it should be abbreviated. To make spelling less diﬃ  -
cult, consider using a speller/divider. Th ese little reference 
books contain thousands of the most commonly used 
words, showing their spelling and how they are divided. 
Th e reader is not distracted by deﬁ nitions, information 
on the history of the word, synonyms and so on. Th e most 
important advantage is that 1 speller/divider page has as 
many words on it as 15 to 20 dictionary pages.

tioned by name.
 
Example: Th e program was postponed because the

Sergeant Fairchild sent the wrong ﬁ lm.
 
Example: Insuﬃ  cient evidence was gathered at the

Better than: Investigator Hanks gathered insuﬃ  -
cient evidence at the crime scene.
Audience Focused Always consider who your audi-
ence is. Recall the diversity of possible readers of police 
reports. Given these varied backgrounds and individuals 
with limited familiarity with law enforcement terminol-
ogy, the necessity for audience-focused reports becomes 
obvious. By keeping in mind this diverse audience, you 
will construct a reader-friendly report.
 
One way to be reader friendly is to be certain that 
the narrative portion of your report can stand alone. Th at 
calls for eliminating such phrases as the above. A reader-
friendly report does not begin like this: “On the above 
date at the above time, I responded to the above address 
to investigate a burglary in progress.”
 
Using such phrases presents two problems. First, if 
readers take time to look “above” to ﬁ nd the information, 
their train of thought is broken. It is diﬃ  cult to ﬁ nd where 
to resume reading, and time is wasted. Second, if readers 
do not take time to look “above,” important information 
is not conveyed, and it is very likely the reader, perhaps 
subconsciously, will be wondering what would have been 
found “above.” If information is important enough to 
refer to in your report, include it in the narrative. Do not 
take the lazy approach and ask your reader to search for 
the information “above.”
 
Another way to write a reader-friendly report is to 
avoid police lingo and other bureaucratic language and 
use plain English rather than “Cop Speak.” Consider this 
example provided by Robinson (2006, p.30):
Oﬃ  cer, would you read the marked section from your 
report?
 
I attempted to apply an escort hold to the subject, 
but I noted resistive tension in his arm, so I applied 
pain compliance instead. Th e subject actively resisted, 
so I administered a focused knee strike to the lower 
abdominal area, and decentralized the subject.
 
In other words, Oﬃ  cer, you tried to grab my cli-
ent’s arm, and when he pulled away, you twisted his 
wrist, and then kicked him in the groin and threw him 
down on the pavement, is that about it?
 
Well, I wouldn’t put it in quite those words.
 
No, oﬃ  cer, I imagine you wouldn’t. No further 
questions.
tense can cause tremendous problems later. For example, 
suppose you wrote, “John Doe lives at 100 South Street 
and works for Ace Trucking Company.” One year later, you 
ﬁ nd yourself on the witness stand with a defense attorney 
asking you, “Now, Oﬃ  cer, your report says that John Doe 
lives at 100 South Street. Is that correct?” You may not 
know, and you would have to say so. Th e next question: 
“Now, Oﬃ  cer, your report says John Doe works for Ace 
Trucking Company. Is that correct?” Again, you may be 
uncertain and be forced into an “I don’t know” response. 
Use of the past tense in your report avoids this problem.
First Person Use the ﬁ rst person to refer to yourself. 
First person in English uses the words I, me, my, we, us 
and our. Th e sentence “I responded to the call” is written in 
the ﬁ rst person. Th is contrasts with “Th is oﬃ  cer responded 
to the call,” which uses the third person. Whether you 
remember your English classes and discussions of ﬁ rst-, 
second- and third-person singular and plural is irrelevant. 
Simply remember to refer to yourself as I rather than as 
this oﬃ  cer.
Active Voice A sentence may be either active or passive. 
Th is is an easy distinction to make if you think about what 
the words active and passive mean. (Forget about the term 
voice; it is a technical grammatical term you do not need 
to understand to write well.) In the active voice the sub-
ject of the sentence performs the actions—for example, “I 
wrote the report.” Th is contrasts with the passive voice, in 
which the subject does nothing—for example: “Th e report 
was written by me.” Th e report did not do anything. Th e 
problem with the passive voice is that often the by is left 
oﬀ —for example: “Th e report was written.” Later, no one 
knows who did the writing. Passive voice results in a “who-
dunit” that can have serious consequences in court.
 
Statements are usually clearer in the active voice. 
Although most sentences should be in the active voice, a 
passive sentence is acceptable in the following situations:
 1. If the doer of the action is unknown, unimportant or 
obvious.
 
Example: Th e gun had been ﬁ red three times.
 
We don’t know who ﬁ red it. Th is is better than 
“Someone had ﬁ red the gun three times.”
 
Example: Th e woman has been arrested four times.
 
Who arrested her each time is not important.
 
Example: Felix Umburger was paroled in April.
 
Who is obviously the parole board.
 2. When you want to call special attention to the receiver 
of the action rather than the doer.
 
Example: Oﬃ  cer Morris was promoted after the 
examination.
 
You want to call attention to Oﬃ  cer Morris, rather 
than to the person who promoted him.

CHAPTER 3 | Writing Effective Reports | 85
TAPING AND DICTATING 
REPORTS
Tape-recording or dictating reports is common 
in some departments. Reports that need quick 
attention may be red-tagged, and records personnel type 
all red-tagged cases ﬁ rst.
 
In eﬀ ect, tape-recording or dictating reports shifts 
the bulk of writing/transcribing time to the records divi-
sion. Even with taping or dictating, however, oﬃ  cers must 
still take ﬁ nal responsibility for what is contained in the 
report. Do not assume that what you think you spoke into 
a dictation machine is what will end up on paper. Follow-
ing are some humorous illustrations of how some dictated 
sentences can be misinterpreted:
• • He called for a toe truck.
• • Smith was arrested for a mister meaner.
• • Jones was a drug attic.
• • Th e victim was over rot.
• • Johnson died of a harder tack.
 
A technology called the Intuitive Pen recognizes hand-
writing, taking what an oﬃ  cer has written and converting 
it into an electronic form, thereby reducing redundancies 
and increasing the eﬃ  ciency and accuracy of the report-
generating process. Simon (2005, p.96) explains,
Th is pen can save oﬃ  cers time since data collected in 
the ﬁ eld will not need to be retyped. Every stroke cre-
ated by this pen is saved. . . . To retrieve the informa-
tion, the pen is inserted into the docking station, which 
is connected to a computer through a USB cable. Th is 
information is then transferred to the computer and 
the software converts it into typed text within the form.
 
While many investigators carry PDAs [personal 
digital assistants] or tablet PCs [personal computers] to 
record information, such devices are not conﬁ gured to 
allow a fast, easy switch between the various preloaded 
forms oﬃ  cers use to enter important data, as is often 
needed in a rapidly unfolding or emergency situation. Th e 
Intuitive Pen, however, is able to eﬀ ectively and accurately 
capture information that is not collected sequentially.
 
Th e pen can be interfaced with a report manage-
ment system that automatically converts the data 
into an appropriate format for use in a department’s 
reports. Furthermore, it can be used as part of an evi-
dence tracking program, creating an evidence receipt 
copy in the ﬁ eld and then being docked at the station, 
with the data retrieved and used to print barcode labels 
for all evidence collected.
 
Although computerized report writing has greatly 
increased oﬃ  cers’ eﬃ  ciency, it cannot correct sloppy 
 
Robinson explains that the defense attorney made the 
jury think the oﬃ  cer tried to hide his use of force behind 
a smoke screen of clinical language and that he did so to 
minimize brutality. According to Robinson, law enforce-
ment trainers use such jargon to make communication 
within the profession more concise and eﬃ  cient. When 
it comes to this clinical-sounding terminology for use of 
force, they use it for two additional reasons: (1) to enable 
precise description and (2) to diﬀ erentiate between trained 
techniques and “street-ﬁ ghting.” Robinson explains, “As 
litigation has driven improvements in use-of-force train-
ing, it has also promoted a push for precision in describing 
what actually happens during a ﬁ ght. A term like ‘focused 
strike’ rather than ‘punch’ aﬀ ords more accuracy in distin-
guishing, for example, a blow with a closed ﬁ st from a ‘dif-
fuse strike’ with an open hand. . . . Being able to refer to 
those trained techniques in reporting a use of force makes 
it easier to show the oﬃ  cer’s use of force was objectively 
reasonable under the circumstances, a requirement under 
Graham v. Connor.”
 
Robinson (2006, p.32) does not suggest that oﬃ  -
cers abandon clinical-type describing but rather should 
describe their actions in everyday language: “For exam-
ple, instead of saying, ‘I decentralized the subject,’ have 
the oﬃ  cer describe exactly what push-down technique 
was used to take Mr. Jones to the ground. ‘I pulled him 
toward me and stabilized his forehead against my upper 
chest, by locking my arms around the back of his head and 
neck. Th en I stepped back, and used my hands to direct 
him to the ground, while also verbally commanding him 
to get down.’”
 
Robinson (2006, p.32) concludes, “If oﬃ  cers learn to 
articulate their use of force in speciﬁ c, everyday language, 
the reasonableness will become more apparent. A good 
report can make an excessive-force lawsuit less likely to 
be ﬁ led in the ﬁ rst place, and if it does go to court, less 
likely to be successful.”
Legible and On Time It does little good to learn to 
write well if no one can read it or if the report is turned in 
after it was needed. Ideally, reports should be typed, and 
in today’s computer-driven world, most reports are gener-
ated this way. Sometimes, however, this is not practical or 
possible. In fact, a poorly typed report is often as diﬃ  cult 
to read as an illegible one. 
 
If you do not type your reports, and if you know that 
you have poor handwriting, you may want to print your 
reports by hand. A key factor in legibility is speed, and 
most oﬃ  cers need to slow their writing speed (Arp, 2007, 
p.102). A report that cannot be read is of little use to any-
one. Whether your reports are typed, written or printed, 
make certain that others can read them easily and that 
they are submitted on time.

86 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
EVALUATING YOUR REPORT
Once you have written your report, evaluate it. Do 
not simply add the ﬁ nal period, staple the pages 
together and turn it in. Reread it. Proofread it to look for 
mistakes in spelling, punctuation and capitalization.
 
Also make certain it says what you want it to and con-
tains no content or composition errors. Ask yourself if the 
report is factual, accurate, objective, complete, concise, 
clear, grammatically and mechanically correct, written in 
Standard English, organized into paragraphs, written in 
the past tense, uses the ﬁ rst person and active voice and 
is audience focused and legible. For larger reports, ask a 
colleague whose writing you admire to read your report. It 
is very diﬃ  cult to proofread your own writing. 
 
Table 3.4 provides an evaluation checklist for 
 investigative reports.
data entry. Oﬃ  cers are responsible for the accuracy and 
 clarity of the data. Th e accuracy and clarity of a report 
are often deciding factors in whether a case is prosecuted. 
Preparing for and presenting cases in court are discussed 
in Chapter 21.
COMPUTERIZED REPORT 
WRITING
Another advance is computer-assisted report 
entry (CARE). Th is live-entry system centers 
around a CARE operator who leads oﬃ  cers through pre-
formatted screens and questions, allowing them to 
complete reports in minutes. Th e CARE system has 
reduced report-writing times and improved the quality, 
accuracy and timeliness of police reports. In addition, 
Uniform Crime Reporting information is automatically 
aggregated.
 
Computers have made signiﬁ cant contributions to eﬃ  -
ciency in report writing. Th e hardware available for word 
processing has become smaller and faster. It is easier to 
use and much more portable. Most of today’s oﬃ  cers use 
vehicle -mounted computers or portable laptops. Software 
has also kept pace, with software developments allowing 
faster, more eﬃ  cient report writing (Jetmore, 2008, p.27). 
In addition to sophisticated spell- and grammar-checker 
programs (to be used with the caveats noted earlier in 
“Grammatically and Mechanically Correct”), other pro-
grams have been developed to help in the actual prepara-
tion of police reports: “Software selection is speciﬁ c to each 
agency and their particular requirements, based on that 
agency’s roles and responsibilities” (Brewer, 2007, p.38). 
For example, an agency with a large marine section should 
have the ability to query a boat’s hull identiﬁ cation number 
(HID) on the software’s query mask (Brewer). Pen-based 
computers, which involve use of a special “pen” to write on 
the computer screen, have also made report writing easier.
 
How many times have you heard, “Great job. Now do 
it again”? Th is demoralizing phrase can deﬂ ate an oﬃ  cer 
who has gone to great lengths to ensure an accurate, com-
plete report. Yet police oﬃ  cers often encounter this “do 
it again” hurdle when they write a report. Report writing 
is ﬁ lled with redundancies—turning handwritten notes 
into typed reports, sometimes ﬁ lling out numerous forms 
along the way, all involving the same basic information 
garnered from the initial note-taking event. Each trans-
fer of data takes time from an investigator and introduces 
an opportunity for error—a transposed number or two, a 
misspelled name, a detail that gets overlooked and never 
makes it to the ﬁ nal report.
An unavoidable and critical part of law enforcement is documenting 
actions taken during a shift. Here police ofﬁ cers in San Antonio, 
Texas, complete their arrest reports at the City Detention facility.

CHAPTER 3 | Writing Effective Reports | 87
 
In accessing the local department’s Web site and pulling 
up the page with the crime report form, citizens are able to 
complete an online report with such required ﬁ elds as name, 
address, type of incident or loss experienced, and so on. 
Before the citizen can submit the report, a warning appears 
stating the penalties for ﬁ ling a false report. Gitmed (2007, 
p.124) notes, “Trying to obtain police reports from tourists, 
who would rather get back to their vacations than deal with 
ﬁ ling a report, and trying to obtain a copy of these reports 
for insurance purposes can be a logistical nightmare.” He 
(pp.124–125) suggests the following beneﬁ ts of citizen 
online reporting:
Th e beneﬁ ts of online reporting can be seen from the 
perspective of both the law enforcement agency pro-
viding the service and from citizens using the service. 
Agencies have the ability to serve citizens as they nor-
mally would while keeping oﬃ  cers on the street. Th is 
prevents busy or understaﬀ ed departments from having 
to create “no-response” policies for low-priority calls. 
Staﬀ  resources can also be better allocated as online 
reports gradually replace telephone reports and the 
workload for desk oﬃ  cers becomes manageable com-
pared with a never-ending stream of citizens visiting 
police station lobbies to report crimes. Th e monetary 
savings are quite substantial when considering the vol-
ume of reports that are taken online as opposed to hav-
ing oﬃ  cers take reports and write them. Depending on 
the vendor an agency chooses, online reporting systems 
can also facilitate crime tips, special form submissions, 
and volunteer applications and can even serve as a 3-1-1 
system, so that citizens can conveniently report aban-
doned vehicles, barking dogs, or even streetlight outage.
 
Once submitted, the report can be retrieved and proofed 
by a records clerk in the police department, who determines 
whether the report is valid and assigns a case number to those 
meeting the predetermined criteria. Some systems allow 
the report to be directly downloaded into the department’s 
records management system, and some generate a conﬁ rma-
tion postcard containing the case number, which is sent to 
the person who submitted the report. An increasing number 
of departments are switching to e-mail conﬁ rmation.
 
Gitmed (2007, p.131) concludes, “Online reporting is 
not a fad that will disappear in the near future, but rather 
an enhancement of police service that is here to stay.”
THE FINAL REPORT
The culmination of the preceding steps is the 
ﬁ nal, or prosecution, report, containing all 
essential information for bringing a case to trial. Th e ﬁ nal 
report will be examined more closely in Chapter 21, as 
part of preparing a case for court.
CITIZEN ONLINE REPORT 
WRITING
Anew trend allows citizens to ﬁ le crime reports 
online, which has the potential of easing 
reporting delays for those jurisdictions suﬀ ering from 
staﬃ  ng shortages or unmanageable caseloads. Such 
reporting is used only for discovery crimes, not involve-
ment crimes, and is most appropriate for property crimes 
where no suspect information is available. For example, 
the San Francisco Police Department allows citizens to ﬁ le 
online police reports for lost property, theft, vandalism 
and graﬃ  ti, vehicle tampering, vehicle burglary and 
harassing phone calls (Gitmed, 2007, p.127).

written reports. All these beneﬁ ts ultimately save the depart-
ment time and expense. Jetmore (2008, p.26) stresses, 
Although great strides have been made in the forensic 
and scientiﬁ c aspects of investigation, most would 
agree criminal investigation is still an art in which skills 
are enhanced through a combination of experience, 
training, and the ability to apply investigative tech-
niques to complex situations. Attention to detail, perse-
verance, and common sense prove critical.
 
It’s not just skillful investigation that brings the 
bad guy to justice, however. It’s the investigator’s ability 
to prepare a report that will withstand minute scrutiny 
by judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, citizens, and 
the media. Th e report’s ability to hold up under scrutiny 
may determine whether the guilty go free or justice is 
rendered to the victim. Why? Because in a democracy, 
the police are rightly constrained by a legal frame-
work that not only presumes innocence, but places 
strict legal limitations on every police contact, detain-
ment, arrest, and search of its citizens. Every police 
report must jump over the substantial hurdle of the 
A FINAL NOTE ON THE 
IMPORTANCE OF WELL-
WRITTEN REPORTS
Given the many uses of reports and the number of 
individuals who rely on them, the importance of 
reports should now be clear. What is key here is to make 
these necessary documents as well written as possible, thus 
maximizing the beneﬁ ts they can provide. A report written 
well the ﬁ rst time means less time spent rewriting it. A well-
written report also keeps everyone involved in the case 
 current and clear on the facts, which can lead to higher pros-
ecution rates, more plea bargains, fewer trials and an easing 
of caseloads on the court system. A well-written report can 
also save an investigator from spending an inordinate 
amount of time on the witness stand attempting to explain 
any omissions, errors or points of confusion found in poorly

responded with lights and siren in accordance with our policy to a report of a robbery at
Helen’s Liquor Store. The perp had been arrested by officer Andrews driving northbound
several blocks from the scene. When this officer arrived at the above listed address their
were two men standing near the front door. The clerk was frightened bad and nearly out of
control as he walked back into the store. He said he’d been ripped off by a man wearing
orange colored coveralls, a blue baseball cap about 40 years old, 6, with big ears
weighing about 200 pounds who pushed him against the wall and grabbed money from
the till and a gun had been fired as he exited the front door. No one was hurt and this
officer decided not to request an ambulance. The other witness followed us into the store
and was obviously drunk and also adorned in coveralls orange in color and two sizes too
big, which made him look sloppy. This witness proceeded to the main door and a piece
was pointed out a short distance from the sidewalk where the perp must have thrown it.
The clerk indicated that he new the guy and that there regular customers. This officer
asked the clerk if he could make a positive identification of the party and he
acknowledged in the affirmative. I new Officer Andrews was 10–12 with one and I asked
him his ETA. He said he was waiting for a CSO to stand by for the hook, but there always
late and we needed a new system for tows. He snapped your just gonna have to wait, I’ll
get there ASAP. He said he thought we were close enough in time to do a one on one
showup and this officer concurred. When I first arrived at the scene, this officer was of the
opinion that the man in the orange colored coveralls was acting strange and may have
been thinking about booking on me. I contemplated cuffing him, but the PC was a little
weak. I engaged the party in further conversation to ascertain weather he’d offer additional
incriminating evidence or make a damaging utterance. Having recently attended training
in the latest Miranda rulings, this officers surmised he was within his rights to converse with
the subject since he wasn’t in custody and he hadn’t lawyered up. As I asked him
questions, he became defensive and moved in a suspicious manner. It became evident
that he had drug and alcohol problems and this officer made the decision to render the
firearm safe and secure it in the trunk of my squad. On the arrival of Officer Andrews, the
clerk shouted out the door that their brothers and of course he can identify him. Officer
Andrews then rolled up and lowered his window. The clerk went hysterical and screamed
that he owed him a hundred bucks. Both witnesses positively identified the suspect sitting
in the back seat with a sour look. Officer Andrews gave the clerk back a hundred dollars
and transported the suspect who was wearing orange colored coveralls and a blue hat to
the PD for booking. He identified the defendant as Bart Jennings, 5-11-65. The suspect
confessed in front of us and totally exonerated his brother. The clerk calmed down and
asked when he’d get the gun back.  I said that was up to the detectives and cleared the
scene at 5624 Forest Street. This officer identified the witnesses as Stanley Jennings and
Thomas Benson. See above for addresses and DOB’s. END OF REPORT

A ﬁ nal beneﬁ t of well-written reports is to the writer,

A well-written report helps the criminal justice sys-

Swobodzinski (2007, p.47) notes, “Your investigative 
report may be the one pivotal piece of documentation that 
makes a diﬀ erence in the prosecution of a murderer or a 
serial rapist. You certainly don’t want it to be the weakest 
link in the investigation and provide a gap for an oﬀ ender 
to get away with their crimes.”
 
In today’s litigious society, where anyone can sue 
anyone else for practically anything, law enforcement 
is not immune to becoming the target of a lawsuit. For 
this reason, well-written reports can reduce legal liability 
for both the oﬃ  cer and the department by clearly docu-
menting the actions taken throughout the investigation. 
Jetmore (2008, p.29) points out, “Writing a good inves-
tigative report proves diﬃ  cult without signiﬁ cant knowl-
edge of the legal concepts inherent to the profession. Th e

On 10-20-04 at 1900 hours, I was dispatched to Helen’s Liquor Store (5624 Forest Street)
regarding a robbery. I arrived at 1905 and saw the victim, Thomas Benson, and a witness, Stanley
Jennings, standing outside the front door. Both men identified themselves with Minnesota driver’s
licenses. I followed Benson into the store.
Benson paced and his hands trembled as he spoke. He told me that at 1845 hours a customer
pushed him against the wall, grabbed about $100 from the cash register, and ran from the store.
The robber dropped a handgun outside the door as he left, and it fired. Benson described the
man as white, about 40 years old, 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, with big ears. He wore orange coveralls
and a blue baseball hat. Benson said he knew the man and could identify him.
As I spoke with Benson, S. Jennings came into the store and stood by the front door. He was
wearing orange  coveralls, swayed from side to side, and repeatedly moved his hands in and out
of his pockets. His eyes were red and watery, and I smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage on
his breath. S. Jennings opened the door and pointed at a Colt 38 caliber revolver in the grass
about 6 feet west of the sidewalk.
After marking the location of the revolver with an evidence tag, I placed the gun in the trunk of my
squad for safety reasons.
At 1910 hours Officer Andrews contacted me by radio. He had detained Bart Jennings (5-11-65)
several blocks north of Helen’s Liquor Store. Andrews brought B. Jennings back to the liquor store
at 1925 hours. B. Jennings was wearing orange coveralls, a blue baseball cap, and had big ears.
He stayed in the back seat of the squad. (Please see Officer Andrews’ arrest report.)
Benson ran toward the squad and shouted, “That’s him, that’s the creep. He owes me 100 bucks.”
He also told me that Stanley and Bart Jennings were brothers. 
S. Jennings leaned against the front door of the store and said, “Yup, that’s him.”
B. Jennings shifted forward in his seat and stated, “I done it, but I didn’t use no gun. It just fell out
of my pocket. And Stan didn’t know I was going to do it.”
Officer Andrews transported B. Jennings to the Police Department. I told Benson and S. Jennings
that a detective would contact them. I logged the gun into evidence.

90 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Reports are permanent written records of important facts 
of a case to be used in the future and are crucial and neces-
sary cogs in the wheel of justice.
 
Reports are used to examine the past, keep other police 
oﬃ  cers informed, continue investigations, prepare court 
cases, provide the courts with relevant facts, coordinate 
law enforcement activities, plan for future law enforce-
ment services, evaluate individual oﬃ  cer and department 
performance, refresh a witness’s memory about what he 
or she said occurred, refresh the investigating oﬃ  cer’s 
memory during the trial, compile statistics on crime in a 
given jurisdiction and provide information to insurance 
investigators. Reports are read by other oﬃ  cers, supervi-
sors, attorneys and judges, jurors, city oﬃ  cials, insurance 
adjusters and investigators, citizens and reporters.
 
Among the common problems in police reports are
• • Confusing or unclear sentences.
• • Conclusions, assumptions and opinions.
• • Extreme wordiness and overuse of police jargon and 
abbreviations.
• • Missing or incomplete information.
• • Misspelled words and grammatical or mechanical 
errors.
• • Referring to “above” information.
 
Th e eﬀ ective report writer attends to both content and 
form because they are equally important in a well-written 
report. An eﬀ ective report is factual. A fact is a statement 
that can be proven, an inference is a conclusion based on 
reasoning and an opinion is a personal belief. A well-writ-
ten report is also accurate, objective, complete, concise, 
clear, grammatically and mechanically correct, written in 
Standard English, organized into paragraphs and written 
in the past tense; uses the ﬁ rst person and active voice; 
and is audience focused and legible, leaving the reader 
with a positive impression of the writer’s  competence. A 
well-written report is also submitted on time.
 
A well-written report helps the criminal justice 
 system operate more eﬃ  ciently and eﬀ ectively, saves the 
department time and expense, reduces liability for the 
department and the oﬃ  cer and reﬂ ects positively on 
the investigator who wrote it.

o search is to go over or look through a house or other building, a person or 
 a vehicle to ﬁ nd contraband or illicit or stolen property, or some evidence 
of guilt to be used in prosecuting a criminal action or oﬀ ense. In United States 
v. Jacobsen (1984), the Supreme Court deﬁ ned a search as “a governmental 
infringement of a legitimate expectation of privacy.” Rutledge (2008, p.28) explains, 
“In situations where it would be unreasonable for a person to expect privacy, there 
is no ‘search’ to justify, so no warrant is needed.”

LEGAL SEARCHES AND THE 
FOURTH AMENDMENT
An understanding of the Fourth Amendment 
to the U.S. Constitution and its relevance for 
searches and seizures is critical for any investigator. Th e 
Fourth Amendment states, “Th e right of the people to be 
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and eﬀ ects, 
against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be 
violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable 
cause, supported by oath or aﬃ  rmation, and particularly 
describing the place to be searched, and the persons or 
things to be seized.”
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids 
unreasonable searches and seizures.
 
Th e Fourth Amendment strikes a balance between 
individual liberties and the rights of society. It is an out-
growth of the desire of the founders of the United States 
to eliminate the oﬀ ensive British practices that existed 
before the Revolutionary War, such as forcing the colonists 
to provide British soldiers housing and indiscriminately 
searching the homes of those suspected of disloyalty to 
the king. Th e Fourth Amendment meant to ensure that 
the new government would respect its citizens’ dignity and 
privacy: “Th e Fourth Amendment is all about privacy. . . . 
Th e critical distinction to be made at this point is that 
the only ‘privacy’ that counts is that privacy that society 
is willing to accept as reasonable as interpreted by the 
courts. Th e determination of reasonableness depends on 
the balance between the public interest and the individu-
al’s right to be left alone from arbitrary interferences from 
law enforcement” (Ivy and Orput, 2007, p.8). 
 
Th e courts are bound by rules and can admit evi-
dence only if it is obtained constitutionally. Th us, the 
legality of a search must always be kept in mind during 
an investigation.
To conduct an effective search, know the legal require-
ments for searching, the items being searched for and the 
elements of the crime being investigated; be organized, 
systematic and thorough.
BASIC LIMITATION ON 
SEARCHES
All searches have one limitation.
The most important limitation on any search is that 
the scope must be narrow. General searches are 
unconstitutional.
 
Laws regulating how and when searches may be legally 
conducted are numerous and complex. It is critical, how-
ever, that oﬃ  cers responsible for criminal investigations 
know these laws and operate within them. Th e penalty for 
not doing so is extreme—no evidence obtained during an 
illegal search will be allowed at a trial, as established by 
the exclusionary rule.
THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE 
Through the exclusionary rule, the courts 
enforce the prohibition against unreason-
able searches set forth in the Fourth Amendment. In the 
early 1900s the federal courts declared “Th ey would 
require that evidence be obtained in compliance with 
constitutional standards” contained in the Fourth 
Amendment.
 
Investigators make many kinds of searches. They 
search crime scenes, suspects, dead bodies, vehicles, 
hotel rooms, apartments, homes and offices. Search-
ing is a vital task in most criminal investigations 
because through searching, evidence of crime and 
against criminals is obtained. Equally vital, however, 
is an investigator’s understanding of the laws relating 
to searches. Every search must be firmly based on an 
understanding of the restrictions under which police 
officers must operate. 

CHAPTER 4 | Searches | 95
The exclusionary rule established that courts may not 
accept evidence obtained by unreasonable search and 
seizure, regardless of its relevance to a case. Weeks 
v. United States (1914) made the rule applicable at the 
federal level; Mapp v. Ohio (1961) made it applicable to 
all courts.
 
Th e exclusionary rule aﬀ ects illegally seized evidence 
as well as evidence obtained as a result of the illegally 
seized evidence, referred to as fruit of the poisonous tree. 
Th e “fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree” doctrine established 
that evidence obtained as a result of an earlier illegality 
must be excluded from trial. Th e exclusionary rule may 
seem to favor criminals at the expense of law enforcement, 
but this was not the Court’s intent. Th e Court recognized 
that important exceptions to this rule might occur. Two of 
the most important exceptions are the inevitable-discovery 
doctrine and the good-faith doctrine.
THE INEVITABLE DISCOVERY EXCEPTION
In Nix v. Williams (1984), a defendant’s right to counsel 
under the Sixth Amendment was violated, resulting in his 
making incriminating statements and leading the police 
to the body of his murder victim. Searchers who had been 
conducting an extensive, systematic search of the area then 
terminated their search. If the search had continued, the 
search party would inevitably have discovered the victim’s 
body. Th e inevitable-discovery doctrine established 
that if illegally obtained evidence would in all likelihood 
eventually have been discovered legally, it may be used.
 
The intent of the exclusionary rule, the Court said, 
was to deter police from violating citizens’ constitu-
tional rights. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice 
Warren E. Burger wrote, “Exclusion of physical evi-
dence that would inevitably have been discovered adds 
nothing to either the integrity or fairness of a criminal 
trial.”
THE GOOD FAITH EXCEPTION
In United States v. Leon (1984), police in Burbank, Cali-
fornia, were investigating a drug-trafficking operation 
and, following up on a tip from an unreliable infor-
mant, applied for and were issued an apparently valid 
search warrant. Their searches revealed large quantities 
of drugs and other evidence at various locations. The 
defendants challenged the sufficiency of the warrant 
and moved to suppress the evidence seized on the basis 
of the search warrant. The district court held that the 
affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause 
because of the informant’s unreliability. The U.S. Court 
of Appeals affirmed the district court’s action. Then 
the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed whether the exclu-
sionary rule should be modified to allow the admission 
of evidence seized in reasonably good faith. The Court 
noted that the exclusionary rule is a judicially created 
remedy intended to serve as a deterrent rather than a 
guaranteed constitutional right. The good-faith doc-
trine established that illegally obtained evidence may 
be admissible if the police were truly not aware they 
were violating a suspect’s Fourth Amendment rights.
 
Scarry (2007a, p.76) notes, “Courts know police oﬃ  -
cers can and will make reasonable mistakes. It’s simply 
the nature of the job.” Rutledge (2007a, p.71) contends, 
“Objectively reasonable good faith may prevent suppres-
sion and liability in these kinds of cases: search warrants, 
misidentiﬁ cation, invalid statutes, arrest warrants and 
consent.”
JUSTIFICATION FOR 
REASONABLE SEARCHES
The courts have adopted guidelines to assure 
law enforcement personnel that if they adhere 
to certain rules, their searches or seizures will be reason-
able, and thus legal.
A search can be justiﬁ ed and therefore considered legal 
if any of the following conditions are met:
• • A search warrant has been issued.
• • Consent is given.
• • An ofﬁ cer stops a suspicious person and believes 
the person may be armed.
• • The search is incidental to a lawful arrest.
• • An emergency exists.
 
If any one of these preconditions exists, a search will 
be considered “reasonable” and therefore legal. However, 
states can impose further restrictions on police powers 
within their boundaries.
SEARCH WITH A WARRANT
Technically—according to the Fourth Amendment—all 
searches are to be conducted under the authority of a 
warrant. In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Johnson v. 
United States that without exigent circumstances, searches 
are presumptively unconstitutional if not authorized by a 
search warrant. 

96 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
several states adhere to this more stringent requirement 
for establishing probable cause.
Other Requirements In addition to establishing prob-
able cause for a search, the warrant must contain the 
reasons for requesting it, the names of the people pre-
senting aﬃ  davits, what speciﬁ cally is being sought and 
the signature of the judge issuing it. Th e warrant must be 
based on facts and sworn to by the oﬃ  cer requesting the 
warrant. An address and description of the location must 
be  given—for example, “100 S. Main Street,” “the ABC 
Liquor Store,” or “1234 Forest Drive, a private home.” 
 Figure 4.1 is an example of a search warrant.
 
A search warrant can be issued to search for and seize 
the following:
• • Stolen or embezzled property
• • Property designed or intended for use in committing a 
crime
• • Property that indicates a crime has been committed or 
a particular person has committed a crime
 
In Groh v. Ramirez (2004), the Supreme Court sent a 
message to law enforcement on the importance of pay-
ing attention to detail. In this case, police obtained a 
warrant to search a residence. Although the application 
and aﬃ  davit described the items to be seized, the war-
rant did not contain such a description as required by the 
Fourth Amendment. Th e section that was to contain a 
list of items to be seized instead described the place to be 
searched. A judge reviewed and signed the warrant, which 
was then executed. Th e oﬃ  cer was sued for an alleged 
Fourth Amendment violation. Th e lower court agreed that 
a constitutional violation occurred and that any reason-
able oﬃ  cer would have concluded that the warrant was 
invalid. Th e U.S. Supreme Court agreed: “It is incumbent 
upon the oﬃ  cer executing a search warrant to ensure the 
search is lawfully authorized and lawfully conducted.”
 
Once a warrant is obtained, it should be executed 
promptly. In many states, the warrant is good for 10 days 
between 6 A.M. and  P.M. unless endorsed otherwise. 
Usually the oﬃ  cer serving the warrant knocks on the par-
ticular door, states the purpose of the search and gives a 
copy of the warrant to the person who has answered the 
knock. If oﬃ  cers attempting to serve a search warrant 
are not admitted by occupants following a knock-notice 
announcement, forcible entry may be made, but unneces-
sary damage to the structure may make the entry unrea-
sonable: “Destruction of property in the course of a search 
may violate the Fourth Amendment, even though the 
entry itself is lawful (United States v. Ramirez)” (Rutledge, 
2007d, p.78). Th e “knock-and-announce” rule is based in 
English common law and ensures the right to privacy in 
one’s home.
 
To obtain a valid search warrant, oﬃ  cers must appear 
before a judge and establish probable cause to believe that 
the location contains evidence of a crime and speciﬁ cally 
describe that evidence. Probable cause is more than 
reasonable suspicion. Probable cause to search requires 
that a combination of facts makes it more likely than not 
that items sought are where the police believe them to be. 
Probable cause is what would lead a person of “reason-
able caution” to believe that something connected with a 
crime is on the premises or person to be searched: “Prob-
able cause is a commonsense, non-technical conception 
that deals with the factual and practical considerations of 
everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not 
legal technicians, act” (Scarry, 2007b, p.59).
 
Jetmore (2007b, p.28) explains probable cause as 
“less than proof, but more than suspicion that a crime is 
being, has been or will be committed. Th us, probable cause 
requires a higher standard than reasonable suspicion, but 
less than the proof beyond a reasonable doubt required 
for a conviction in court.” He provides a partial list of 
guilt-laden or other facts to build probable cause: ﬂ ight, 
furtive movements, hiding, an attempt to destroy evi-
dence, resistance to oﬃ  cers, evasive answers, unreason-
able explanations, contraband or weapons in plain view, 
a criminal record, police training and experience, unusual 
or suspicious behavior and information from citizens.
 
When oﬃ  cers use information from civilians on 
search warrant applications, they should state whether 
the civilian is an informant or citizen giving information 
as a civic duty.
Using Informants Th e Supreme Court has established 
requirements for using informants in establishing prob-
able cause. In Aguilar v. Texas (1964), the Court adopted a 
two-pronged test: (1) Is the informant reliable/credible? 
and (2) is the information believable? Th is two-pronged 
approach was upheld in Spinelli v. United States (1969) 
when the Court ruled that the aﬃ  davit of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for a warrant was insuﬃ  -
cient to establish probable cause because there was not 
enough information to adequately assess the informant’s 
reliability.
 
Th e Court abandoned this two-pronged approach 
in Illinois v. Gates (1983), where the Court ruled that 
probable cause is a practical concept that should not 
be weighed by scholars using tests, such as the Aguilar-
Spinelli two-pronged test. Rather, the test for probable 
cause under the Fourth Amendment should be a totality-
of-the-circumstances test. Th is is a principle upon 
which a number of legal assessments are made; it refers 
to the sum total of factors leading a reasonable person 
to a course of action. However, federal courts are still 
guided by the two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli test, and

ive or resistant to arrest. Th e knock-and-announce rule 
is intended (1) to protect citizens’ right to privacy, (2) to 
reduce risk of possible violence to police and residence occu-
pants and (3) to prevent needless destruction of private 
property. Implementing a no-knock or quick-knock war-
rant can provide a tactical advantage for law enforcement 
(Heinecke, 2007, p.30). As Scarry (2006b, p.65) explains, 
“Many situations arise where it’s not necessary for police 
to knock and announce their presence; e.g., where there’s a 
threat of physical violence, a reason to believe the evidence 
would be destroyed if advance notice were given or where 
knocking and announcing would prove futile.”
 
In a unanimous ruling in United States v. Banks 
(2003), the Supreme Court upheld the forced entry into a 
The 
Knock-and-Announce 
Rule Th e knock-and-
 announce rule requires oﬃ  cers serving a search warrant 
to knock, announce themselves and wait a “reasonable 
length of time” before attempting entry. In Wilson v. 
Arkansas (1995) the Court made this centuries-old rule a 
constitutional mandate: “Th e underlying command of the 
Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures 
be reasonable, and that the common-law requirement that 
oﬃ  cers announce their identity and purpose before enter-
ing a house forms a part of the Fourth Amendment inquiry 
into the reasonableness of the oﬃ  cers’ entry.” Th e courts 
have recognized that in some instances safe and eﬀ ec-
tive law enforcement requires certain exceptions be made 
to the knock-and-announce rule. A no-knock  warrant 
may be issued if evidence may be easily destroyed or if 
there is advance knowledge of explosives or other speciﬁ c

98 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
is a “far-reaching ruling that could encourage police 
with search warrants to conduct more aggressive raids.” 
However, as Hilton (2007, p.38) cautions, “Some police 
departments have interpreted the Supreme Court’s 
recent Hudson v. Michigan ruling as a license to execute 
warrants without knocking, announcing and waiting a 
reasonable amount of time for a resident to answer the 
door before entering. Th at interpretation is both wrong 
and dangerous. Failure to adhere to the requirements of 
the knock-and-announce rule can result in terrible trag-
edy and extremely expensive litigation.” A defense against 
possible abuse of the knock-and-announce requirement is 
oﬃ  cer safety: “Most oﬃ  cers ﬁ nd it judicious to know and 
announce their presence and intentions. ‘Surprise’ entries 
can lead to misunderstanding on the suspect’s part, creat-
ing situations that can escalate into unnecessary violence” 
(Geoghegan, 2007, p.99).
 
Rutledge (2006c, p.97), likewise, comments, “Never 
mind the headlines and the editorials proclaiming that the 
Supreme Court did away with the knock-and-announce 
requirement. It did no such thing.” Oﬃ  cers must still bal-
ance the knock, announce and wait requirements against 
both oﬃ  cer safety and evidence destruction issues and the 
entry must still be reasonable. Videotaping knock-notice 
announcement and entry provides evidence of compli-
ance with the rule as well as the amount of time oﬃ  cers 
waited before entry. 
A search conducted with a warrant must be limited to the 
speciﬁ c area and speciﬁ c items named in the warrant, in 
accordance with the particularity requirement (Stanford 
v. Texas, 1965).
 
During a search conducted with a warrant, items not 
speciﬁ ed in the warrant may be seized if they are similar 
to the items described, if they are related to the particular 
crime described or if they are contraband.
Anticipatory Search Warrants In United States v. 
Grubbs (2006), the Supreme Court approved use of an 
anticipatory search warrant. Th e Court deﬁ ned an antici-
patory warrant as one “based upon an aﬃ  davit showing 
probable cause that at some future time (but not pres-
ently) certain evidence of crime will be located at a speci-
ﬁ ed place.” According to Rutledge (2006a, p.66): “A search 
warrant can be procured based on prior knowledge that an 
illegal product or substance will be delivered.” Th e Court 
noted that, in a sense, all search warrants are anticipa-
tory. Anticipatory warrants are constitutional if a proper 
showing is made that contraband or evidence will likely 
be found at the target location at a given time, or when 
a speciﬁ c triggering event occurs. Th e Court ruled that 
suspected drug dealer’s apartment 15 to 20 seconds after 
police knocked and announced themselves. Th is ruling 
strengthened police powers in cases where loss of evidence 
or physical danger were crucial factors and provides guid-
ance to law enforcement oﬃ  cers/entry teams on how long 
they need to wait before forcing entry into a residence.
 
Th en in 2006 the Supreme Court ruled in Hudson v. 
Michigan that the Constitution does not require the gov-
ernment to forfeit evidence gathered through illegal “no 
knock” searches while executing a search warrant. Van 
Dorn (2006, p.10) describes the facts in the case:
Th e police obtained a search warrant authorizing a 
search for drugs and ﬁ rearms at the house of Booker 
Hudson. Th ey seized drugs and a loaded gun that was 
found between the cushion and the armrest of a chair. 
Hudson subsequently was charged under Michigan law 
with unlawful possession of drugs and ﬁ rearms.
 
When the police executed the warrant, they 
announced their presence and waited approximately 
three to ﬁ ve seconds before making their entry. Hud-
son moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the 
three-to-ﬁ ve second wait was unreasonable and vio-
lated his Fourth Amendment rights.
 
Th e trial court suppressed the evidence ﬁ nding 
that the oﬃ  cers’ entry was premature and violated the 
Fourth Amendment, but the Michigan Court of Appeals 
reversed, ﬁ nding that suppression of the evidence 
was not an appropriate remedy to address a too-short 
wait before entry. Th e defendant was convicted and 
appealed. . . .
 
Th e Supreme Court found that even if the police 
entered the house prematurely, the entry was nonethe-
less warranted by judicial order. Th e nature of such a 
police error, if it was an error, does not make evidence 
suppression reasonable.
 
Th e Court said, “Suppression of evidence has always 
been our last resort, not our ﬁ rst impulse. Th e exclusionary 
rule generates substantial social costs which sometimes 
include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large.” 
Th e Court also considered the availability of other means 
of deterring police errors when executing search warrants: 
“For example, oﬃ  cers and their agencies may be held civ-
illy liable for damages and attorney’s fees for knock-notice 
violations. Also, police internal discipline and increased 
professionalism provide checks against abuses. Th erefore, 
‘Resort to the massive remedy of suppressing evidence of 
guilt is unjustiﬁ ed’” (Rutledge, 2006c, pp.97–98). In the 
5-to-4 vote, writing for the Court’s ﬁ ve-member conserva-
tive majority, Justice Alito said police blunders should not 
result in a “get-out-of-jail-free card” for defendants. 
 
Holland (2006a, p.A3) calls the ruling “a signiﬁ cant 
rollback of earlier rulings protective of homeowners.” 
Concurring, Lane (2006a, p.A01) contends the decision 

CHAPTER 4 | Searches | 99
Further, the person may revoke the consent at any time 
during the search. If this occurs, oﬃ  cers are obligated to 
discontinue the search.
 
If the police believe the person giving consent has 
authority, they may act on this belief, even though it later 
turns out the person did not have authority. Any of sev-
eral people occupying a location may usually give consent 
for the entire premises.
 
A form of consent with which oﬃ  cers should be 
familiar is the consent once removed exception to the 
search warrant requirement. Under this exception, oﬃ  -
cers can make a warrantless entry to arrest a suspect if 
consent to enter was given earlier to an undercover oﬃ  -
cer or informant.
Denial of Consent by One Resident In Georgia v. 
 Randolph (2006), the Supreme Court changed the rules 
governing some consent searches of private premises. 
Harris (2006, p.22) describes the facts of this case:
Scott Randolph and his wife, Janet, had been separated 
for several weeks. In early July of 2001, she returned 
to the family home and a domestic dispute occurred. 
Scott left the scene with their minor child and Janet 
called the police. Janet told the police of their domestic 
troubles and noted that Scott’s cocaine use had caused 
them ﬁ nancial troubles. Scott Randolph returned 
shortly. When he spoke to the police he denied cocaine 
use. Janet renewed her claim and told police there 
were “items of drug evidence” in the house. Police 
asked Scott for permission to search the home and he 
unequivocally refused.
 
Oﬃ  cers then turned to Janet who granted consent 
and led the oﬃ  ce to a bedroom which she identiﬁ ed as 
Scott’s. Th e oﬃ  cer saw there a straw which had a white 
powdery substance which he suspected was cocaine. 
Janet then withdrew her consent, but it appears the 
police had already seized the straw. Th ey obtained a 
search warrant and seized further items of evidence.
 
In a 5–3 opinion, the Court stated, “If any party who 
is present and has authority to object to the search does 
object to the search, the police may not conduct the search 
on the authority of that party who gave consent.” As Fer-
rell (2006, p.10) explains, “When adult co-residents of a 
home are both present, and one denies consent to enter 
and search and the other purportedly grants consent, 
police may not enter or search based on the purported 
consent. Th e denial of consent by one overrules and over-
rides what would otherwise be a valid consent by the 
other.” Lane (2006b, p.A8) suggests that Justice Souter’s 
majority opinion said the consent of one partner is inad-
equate because of “widely shared social expectations” that 
adults living together each have veto power over who can 
enter their shared living space.
where a triggering condition was speciﬁ ed in the search 
warrant application or aﬃ  davit, the failure to include that 
triggering condition in the warrant did not undermine the 
warrant’s validity (Mount, 2006, p.8).
SEARCH WITH CONSENT
Oﬃ  cers can conduct a search without a warrant under 
certain circumstances, one of which occurs when consent 
to search is given. Holtz (2006, p.19) notes, “As a general 
matter, the Fourth Amendment permits the police to 
make a warrantless entry and search of premises based on 
the voluntary consent of a third party—generally an occu-
pant—who shares ‘common authority’ over the premises 
or eﬀ ects sought to be inspected.” Searching without a 
warrant is allowed if consent is given by a person having 
authority to do so. Th is might be a spouse or roommate, 
a business partner if the search is at a place of business, 
the owner of a car and the like: “Th e Supreme Court has 
ruled that when people jointly occupy a residence, each 
assumes the risk that the other may permit police access 
to shared areas in the home” (Rutledge, 2006d, p.70). As 
with a search warrant, searches conducted with consent 
have limitations.
Consent to search must be voluntary, and the search 
must be limited to the area for which consent is given.
 
Th e consent must not be in response to an oﬃ  cer’s 
claim of lawful authority or phrased as a command or 
threat. It must be a genuine request for permission to 
search. A genuine aﬃ  rmative reply must also be given; a 
simple nodding of the head or opening of a door is not 
suﬃ  cient. Silence is not consent. Th e Supreme Court ruled 
in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973) that it would use the 
totality-of-the-circumstances test to determine whether 
the consent was voluntary. Th is includes the character-
istics of the subject, the environment (location, number 
of people and oﬃ  cers present and time of day), the sub-
ject’s actions or statements and the oﬃ  cer’s actions or 
statements. Scarry (2007b, p.57) recommends, “It’s good 
practice when asking for a consent to search that oﬃ  cers 
actually ask for the consent as opposed to stating they 
would like to conduct a search. Additionally, it’s good 
practice to get an aﬃ  rmative answer before conducting a 
search and even better practice to obtain a written con-
sent to search.”
 
Oﬃ  cers should thoroughly document everything they 
say and do when asking for consent and while conducting 
the search. Some oﬃ  cers use a prepared consent form to 
be signed by the person giving consent. If consent is given, 
the person granting it must be legally competent to do so. 

100 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
 
Th e Court warned that a patdown or frisk is “a seri-
ous intrusion upon the sanctity of the person which may 
inﬂ ict great indignity and arouse strong resentment, and 
it is not to be undertaken lightly.” Th e “search” in a frisk 
is sometimes referred to as a safety search. Oﬃ  cers should 
know the limits of their authority to protect themselves—
physically and legally—so that they never are forced to 
choose between being safe and being sued (Rutledge, 
2007b, p.36). 
 
Terry has been further expanded in other cases. Adams 
v. Williams (1972) established that oﬃ  cers may stop and 
question individuals based on information received from 
informants. United States v. Hensley (1985) established 
that police oﬃ  cers may stop and question suspects when 
they believe they recognize them from “wanted” ﬂ yers 
issued by another police department.
 
Stop-and-frisk has been validated on the basis of fur-
tive movements; inappropriate attire; carrying suspicious 
objects such as a television or a pillowcase; vague, non-
speciﬁ c answers to routine questions; refusal to identify 
oneself; and appearing to be out of place. As established 
in Alabama v. White (1990), such a stop-and-frisk can 
also be made based on an anonymous tip, provided the 
tip predicts future activities the oﬃ  cer can corroborate, 
making it reasonable to think the informant has reliable 
knowledge about the suspect. However, in Florida v. J. L. 
(2000) the Court held that police could not stop and frisk 
someone based solely on an anonymous tip.
 
Usually during a Terry stop, law enforcement oﬃ  -
cers ask those they detain to identify themselves. Hiibel 
v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, Humboldt County 
(2004) ruled that state statutes requiring individuals to 
identify themselves as part of an investigative stop are 
constitutional and do not violate the Fourth or Fifth 
Amendments. However, the Hiibel ruling applies only if 
a state law requires people to provide their names to law 
enforcement oﬃ  cers.
 
In United States v. Drayton (2002), the Supreme Court 
ruled that law enforcement oﬃ  cers do not need to advise 
bus passengers of their right not to cooperate during 
a consensual bus interdiction. Vehicle stops as well as 
checkpoints for various purposes are discussed shortly.
 
Th e Court has also ruled (Illinois v. McArthur, 2001) 
that oﬃ  cers may detain residents outside their homes 
until a search warrant can be obtained if necessary.
SEARCH FOLLOWING AN ARREST
Every lawful arrest is accompanied by a search of the 
arrested person to protect the arresting oﬃ  cers and oth-
ers and to prevent destruction of evidence. Any weapon or 
dangerous substance or evidence discovered in the search 
General Rules on Third Party Consent Rutledge (2006d, 
p.72) summarizes the general rules on third-party consent: 
“(1) Property owners cannot validly consent to police entry 
or search while a tenant or guest has lawful right of posses-
sion of the premises, (2) when the suspect is not present or 
makes no objection, a co-occupant can give valid consent, 
but (3) if one co-occupant is present and objects, another 
cannot give valid consent as to evidence incriminating the 
objector.” Ferrell (p.10) stresses, “First and foremost, this 
case [Georgia v. Randolph] deals only with situations involv-
ing a resident who is present and denying consent. If the 
only resident present at a home gives a valid consent, the 
validity of that consent is unchanged by the later insistence 
of another resident that he did not approve of the search 
and would have denied consent had he been present.” 
PATDOWN OR FRISK DURING A “STOP”
Another exception to the warrant requirement is a stop 
and frisk situation. Two situations require police oﬃ  cers 
to stop and question individuals: (1) to investigate sus-
picious circumstances and (2) to identify someone who 
looks like a suspect named in an arrest warrant or whose 
description has been broadcast in an all-points bulletin 
(APB).
 
Th e procedures for stopping and questioning sus-
pects are regulated by the same justiﬁ cations and limita-
tions associated with lawful searches and seizures. If it is 
suspected that a person stopped for questioning may be 
armed, the oﬃ  cer is justiﬁ ed in conducting a through-the-
clothes patdown for weapons. If the oﬃ  cer feels an object 
that may be a weapon, the oﬃ  cer may seize it.
 
Th e prime requisite for stopping, questioning and pos-
sibly frisking someone is reasonable suspicion, a lesser stan-
dard than probable cause but equally diﬃ  cult to deﬁ ne. A 
stop and a frisk are two separate actions and each must 
be separately justiﬁ ed: “Stops and frisks, though usually 
factually related, are two separate matters legally. Just 
because a stop is permissible doesn’t mean a frisk is per-
missible. In fact, in most stops, a non-consensual frisk 
would not be permitted because of the absence of reason-
able suspicion of the presence of weapons” (Means, 2008, 
p.23). Th e landmark decision in Terry v. Ohio (1968) estab-
lished police oﬃ  cers’ right to patdown or frisk a person 
they have stopped to question if they believe the person 
might be armed and dangerous.
The Terry decision established that a patdown or frisk is 
a “protective search for weapons” and as such must be 
“conﬁ ned to a scope reasonably designed to discover 
guns, knives, clubs and other hidden instruments for the 
assault of a police ofﬁ cer or others.”

CHAPTER 4 | Searches | 101
a search of that property is no longer an incident of the 
arrest and a search warrant should be obtained.
 
Maryland v. Buie (1990) expanded the area of a prem-
ises search following a lawful arrest to ensure oﬃ  cers’ 
safety. In this case, the Supreme Court added authority 
for the police to search areas immediately adjoining the 
place of arrest. Such a protective sweep, or Buie sweep, 
is justiﬁ ed when reasonable suspicion exists that another 
person might be present who poses a danger to the arrest-
ing oﬃ  cers. Th e search must be conﬁ ned to areas where a 
person might be hiding.
 
New York v. Belton (1981) established that the vehicle 
of a person who has been arrested can be searched with-
out a warrant: “When a policeman has made a lawful cus-
todial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, 
as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the 
passenger compartment of that automobile. It follows 
from this conclusion that the police may also examine the 
contents of any containers found within the passenger 
compartment, for if the passenger compartment is within 
reach of the arrestee, so also will containers in it be within 
his reach.”
 
Jetmore (2007a, p.31) cautions, “Individual state stat-
utes and/or department policies and procedures may further 
limit the scope of a search incidental to arrest. Oﬃ  cers should 
understand their individual state statutes and department 
policies.”
SEARCH IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION
In situations where police oﬃ  cers believe there is probable 
cause but have no time to secure a warrant—for example, 
if shots are being ﬁ red or a person is screaming—they 
may act on their own discretion.
A warrantless search in the absence of a lawful arrest 
or consent is justiﬁ ed only in emergencies or exigent 
circumstances where probable cause exists and the 
search must be conducted immediately (New York v. 
Quarles, 1984).
 
Most courts recognize three conditions that must 
be met to support a warrantless entry under the exigent 
 circumstances exception:
 1. Oﬃ  cers must believe a real emergency exists requir-
ing immediate action to protect or preserve life or to 
prevent serious injury.
 2. Th e entry or search must not be motivated primarily 
to ﬁ nd evidence.
 3. Th e emergency and the area entered or searched must 
have a connection.
may be seized. Limitations on a search incidental to arrest 
are found in Chimel v. California (1969).
The Chimel decision established that a search incidental 
to a lawful arrest must be made simultaneously with 
the arrest and must be conﬁ ned to the area within the 
suspect’s immediate control.
 
A person’s immediate control encompasses the area 
within the person’s reach. Th e Court noted that using an 
arrest to justify a thorough search would give police the 
power to conduct “general searches,” which were declared 
unconstitutional nearly 200 years ago.
 
If law enforcement oﬃ  cers take luggage or other per-
sonal property into their exclusive control and there is 
no longer any danger that the arrestee might gain access 
to the property to seize a weapon or destroy evidence, 
When ofﬁ cers have reasonable suspicion to believe someone they 
have stopped to question may be armed and dangerous, they are 
legally justiﬁ ed in frisking that person for weapons, as established 
by the Terry decision. (© Joel Gordon)

102 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
containers in it. If probable cause does not exist, oﬃ  cers 
may be able to obtain voluntary consent to search the 
vehicle, including any closed containers (Florida v. Jimeno, 
1990). Th e driver must be competent to give such con-
sent, and silence is not consent. If at any time the driver 
rescinds consent, the search must cease.
 
Oﬃ  cers must also know their state’s laws regard-
ing full searches of vehicles pursuant to issuing a traﬃ  c 
citation, which may often seem contradictory. Although 
several states have statutes that authorize searches of 
vehicles following the issuance of a traﬃ  c citation, the 
policy in most states is to allow searches only after a 
driver has been arrested and is in custody. In Knowles v. 
Iowa (1998), the Supreme Court ruled that when an oﬃ  cer 
issues a citation instead of making an arrest, a full search 
of the driver’s car violates the Fourth Amendment.
Pretext Stops Scarry (2007c, p.82) notes, “Ulterior 
motive for a valid traﬃ  c stop does not violate the Fourth 
Amendment.” Th e so-called pretext stop is overridden by 
an oﬃ  cer’s probable cause to believe the motorist is, or is 
about to be, engaged in criminal activity. In other words: 
“Probable cause trumps pretext” (Scarry, p.82). Scarry 
(p.86) says, “State vehicle codes are written to provide 
law enforcement oﬃ  cers ample opportunity to establish 
probable cause to initiate a traﬃ  c stop when an individual 
is suspected of having committed, or about to commit, a 
crime other than the infraction of the vehicle code. Th ey 
are invaluable tools.”
Searches of Passengers in a Stopped Vehicle Accord-
ing to Rutledge (2007f, p.70): “Passengers’ rights dur-
ing vehicle stops often diﬀ er from those of drivers.” He 
(p.71) further notes, “All passengers in private vehicles are 
detained at a stop. Passengers may be ordered out and kept 
from leaving. Passengers may be arrested for joint pos-
session of contraband. And passengers’ property and the 
vehicle may be searched incident to their arrest (passenger 
compartment), or with probable cause (any hiding place).”
 
However, the Court has also ruled in Wyoming v. 
Houghton (1999) that an oﬃ  cer may search an automobile 
passenger’s belongings simply because the oﬃ  cer suspects 
the driver has done something wrong. Th is “passenger 
property exception” ruling was intended to prevent driv-
ers from claiming that illegal drugs or other contraband 
belonged to passengers, rather than themselves.
 
In Brendlin v. California (2007), the Supreme Court 
reaﬃ  rmed what oﬃ  cers already knew—that they must 
have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to stop a 
vehicle. “If oﬃ  cers have no lawful basis for a traﬃ  c stop, 
Brendlin makes clear that anyone in the car—the driver or 
its passengers—may challenge the stop’s constitutional-
ity” (Scarry, 2007d, p.64).
 
In Mincey v. Arizona (1978), the Supreme Court stated 
that the Fourth Amendment does not require police oﬃ  -
cers to delay a search during an investigation if to do so 
would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others. 
Once the danger has been eliminated, however, any fur-
ther search should be conducted only after obtaining a 
search warrant.
 
In Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart (2006), the Supreme 
Court ruled that law enforcement oﬃ  cers could enter a 
house without a warrant to render emergency assistance 
to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from 
imminent injury, as occurred in this case, when oﬃ  cers 
entered a private home to stop a ﬁ ght in progress (Rut-
ledge, 2006b, p.102). Although the defendants argued 
that their conduct was not serious enough to justify the 
oﬃ  cers’ intrusion into the home, the Supreme Court dis-
agreed. Justice Roberts stated, “Th e role of a peace oﬃ  cer 
includes preventing violence and restoring order, not sim-
ply rendering ﬁ rst aid to casualties; an oﬃ  cer is not like a 
boxing (or hockey) referee, poised to stop a bout only if it 
becomes too one-sided” (Holland, 2006b).
 
Th e Court also stated, “Th e ultimate touchstone of 
the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness,’ the warrant 
requirement is subject to certain exceptions.” Citing entry 
onto private property to ﬁ ght a ﬁ re, or to engage in “hot 
pursuit” of a ﬂ eeing suspect, the Court held, “Th us the 
‘exigencies of the situation’ may make the needs of law 
enforcement so compelling that a warrantless search is 
objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.”
WARRANTLESS SEARCHES OF VEHICLES
A vehicle stop is a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth 
Amendment and, therefore, must generally be supported 
by reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. Oﬃ  cers can often 
search vehicles after a lawful traﬃ  c stop because “one has 
a lesser expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle as its 
function is transportation and it seldom serves as one’s 
residence or the repository of personal eﬀ ect” (Scarry, 
2008, p.62). Th is is also known as the automobile excep-
tion. Warrantless searches are often justiﬁ ed because of a 
vehicle’s mobility, that is, the vehicle can be easily moved. 
Th e precedent for a warrantless search of an automobile 
was established in Carroll v. United States (1925).
The Carroll decision established that automobiles may be 
searched without a warrant if (1) there is probable cause 
for the search and (2) the vehicle would be gone before a 
search warrant could be obtained.
 
After stopping a moving vehicle, if oﬃ  cers have prob-
able cause, they may search the vehicle and any closed

explained, “Th e stop’s primary law enforcement purpose 
was not to determine whether a vehicle’s occupants were 
committing a crime, but to ask vehicle occupants, as 
members of the public, for their help in providing infor-
mation about a crime in all likelihood committed by oth-
ers. Th e police expected the information elicited to help 
them apprehend, not the vehicle’s occupants, but other 
individuals.”
 
Th is ruling was a victory for law enforcement. Another 
victory for law enforcement came in 2004 in United 
States v. Flores-Montano, in which the Supreme Court 
unanimously overturned a decision by a circuit court of 
appeals, ruling that privacy interests do not apply to vehi-
cles crossing the border. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, 
“Complex balancing tests to determine what is a ‘routine’ 
search of a vehicle . . . have no place in border searches 
of vehicles. Th e government’s interest in preventing the 
entry of unwanted persons and eﬀ ects is at its zenith at 
the international border. Time and again, we have stated 
that searches made at the border . . . are reasonable simply 
by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border.”
Inventory Searches Unlike a search incidental to an 
arrest, a vehicle search need not be made immediately.
Chambers v. Maroney (1970) established that a vehicle 
may be taken to headquarters to be searched.
 
When police take custody of a vehicle (or other prop-
erty), the courts have upheld their right to inventory such 
property for the following reasons:
• • To protect the owner’s property. Th is obligation may 
be legal or moral, but the courts have supported the 
police’s responsibility to protect property taken into 
custody from unauthorized interference.
• • To protect the police from disputes and claims that the 
property was stolen or damaged. Proper inventory at 
the time of custody provides an accurate record of the 
property’s condition at the time it was seized.
• • To protect the police and the public from danger. Custody 
of an automobile or a person subjects the police to 
conditions that require searching the person or the 
vehicle for objects such as bombs, chemicals, razor 
blades, weapons and so on that may harm the oﬃ  cers 
or the premises where the vehicle or person is taken.
• • To determine the owner’s identity. Identifying the owner 
may be associated with identifying the person under 
arrest, or it may help the police know to whom the 
property should be released.
 
Th e courts have held that each of these factors out-
weighs the privacy interests of property and therefore 
Searches of Vehicles Incident to and Contemporane-
ous with Lawful Arrests In New York v. Belton (1981), 
the Supreme Court ruled that vehicle searches incident to 
and contemporaneous with a lawful arrest are valid: “Once 
an oﬃ  cer determines that there is probable cause to make 
an arrest, it is reasonable to allow oﬃ  cers to ensure their 
safety and to preserve evidence by searching the entire 
passenger compartment.”
 
In Th ornton v. United States (2004), the Supreme 
Court ruled that police can search the passenger compart-
ment of a vehicle incident to arrest when the arrestee was 
approached after recently occupying that vehicle.
Vehicle Searches at Roadblocks and Checkpoints A 
quarter-century ago, in United States v. Martinez-Fuerte 
(1976), the Supreme Court ruled that checkpoints at the 
country’s borders were constitutional because they served 
a national interest and that this interest outweighed the 
checkpoint’s minimal intrusion on driver privacy. A bor-
der search can be made without probable cause, without 
a warrant and without any articulable suspicion. Th e only 
limitation on a border search is the Fourth Amendment 
requirement that it be conducted reasonably. Th e func-
tional equivalent doctrine establishes that routine border 
searches are constitutional at places other than actual bor-
ders where travelers frequently enter or leave the country, 
including international airports.
 
Th ree years later in Brown v. Texas (1979), the 
Supreme Court created a balancing test (an evaluation of 
interests and factors) to determine the constitutional-
ity of roadblocks. Th e Brown balancing test requires that 
courts evaluating the lawfulness of roadblocks consider 
three factors:
 1. Th e gravity of the public concerns served by establish-
ing the roadblock
 2. Th e degree to which the roadblock is likely to succeed 
in serving the public interest
 3. Th e severity with which the roadblock interferes with 
individual liberty
 
Michigan v. Sitz (1990) established that sobriety check-
points to combat drunken driving were reasonable under 
the Brown balancing test if they met certain guidelines. 
However, the Court ruled in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond 
(2000) that checkpoints for drugs are unconstitutional: 
“We cannot sanction stops justiﬁ ed only by the general-
ized and ever-present possibility that interrogation and 
inspection may reveal that any given motorist has com-
mitted some crime.” Th us, vehicle checkpoints for general 
crime control are constitutionally unreasonable.
 
In Illinois v. Lidster (2004), the Court upheld the con-
stitutionality of informational checkpoints. Justice Breyer

any way, or it will be declared inadmissible. Maintain the 
chain of custody of evidence from the initial discovery to 
the time of the trial as discussed in the next chapter.
ORGANIZING THE CRIME SCENE SEARCH
After emergencies have been attended to, the scene has 
been secured, witnesses have been located and separated 
for interviewing, and photographing and sketching have 
been completed, a search plan must be formulated. Also, 
a search headquarters needs to be established away from 
the scene to prevent destruction of evidence.
Organizing a search includes dividing the duties, 
 selecting a search pattern, assigning personnel and 
equipment and giving instructions.
 
Proper organization results in a thorough search with 
no accidental destruction of evidence. However, even the 
best-organized search may not yield evidence. Evidence 
may have been destroyed before the search or removed 
by the criminal. In a few rare instances, evidence is simply 
nonexistent.
 
In a single-investigator search, one oﬃ  cer conducts 
the physical search and describes, identiﬁ es and preserves 
the evidence found. If two or more oﬃ  cers conduct the 
search, the highest-ranking oﬃ  cer on the scene usually 
assumes command. In accordance with department pol-
icy, the oﬃ  cer in charge assigns personnel based on their 
training. For example, if one oﬃ  cer has specialized train-
ing in photography, another in sketching and a third in 
ﬁ ngerprinting, they are assigned to their respective spe-
cialties. Someone is assigned to each function required in 
the search. Often two oﬃ  cers are assigned to take mea-
surements to ensure accuracy. Th ese same two oﬃ  cers 
can collect, identify and preserve evidence as it is found. 
Evidence should never be removed from the scene with-
out the search leader’s permission.
 
Th e search leader also determines the number of 
personnel needed, the type of search best suited for the 
area and the items most likely to be found. Personnel are 
assigned according to the selected search pattern. Search 
party members are given all known details of the crime 
and instructed on the type of evidence to seek and the 
members’ speciﬁ c responsibilities.
 
Th e search leader also determines whether anyone 
other than the person who committed the crime has 
entered the scene. If so, the person is asked to explain 
in detail any contacts with the scene that might have 
contaminated evidence. If no one has entered the scene 
between the time the crime was committed and when the 
police arrived, and if the scene was immediately secured, 
justiﬁ es an inventory search. Th e search must be reason-
able. To be correct in the inventory procedure, the police 
must show legal seizure and make an inventory according 
to approved procedures.
 
Although inventory and search are technically two 
diﬀ erent processes, in practice they may take place simul-
taneously. If property found during such an inventory is 
evidence of a crime, it is admissible in court. It is advis-
able, however, where a vehicle is no longer mobile or is 
in police custody, to obtain a search warrant so as not to 
jeopardize an otherwise perfectly valid case.
 
Although the major cases governing warrantless 
searches of a vehicle have just been discussed, others 
may be encountered during an investigation. Table 4.1 
summarizes the relevant court rulings related to vehicle 
searches.
 
Having looked at the legal restrictions on searching, 
now consider the searches themselves, beginning with 
the search of a crime scene. Although each crime scene is 
unique, certain general guidelines apply.
THE CRIME SCENE SEARCH 
A basic function of investigators is to conduct a 
thorough, legal search at the scene of a crime. 
Even though not initially visible, evidence in some form is 
present at most crime scenes. Th e goal of any search dur-
ing an investigation, at the crime scene or elsewhere, is to 
discover evidence that helps to
• • Establish that a crime was committed and what the 
speciﬁ c crime was.
• • Establish when the crime was committed.
• • Identify who committed the crime.
• • Explain how the crime was committed.
• • Suggest why the crime was committed.
A successful crime scene search locates, identiﬁ es and 
preserves all evidence present.
 
Evidence found at a scene assists in re-creating a 
crime in much the same way that bricks, properly placed, 
result in constructing a building. A meticulous, properly 
conducted search usually results in the discovery of evi-
dence. Th e security measures taken by the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer 
at the scene determine whether evidence is discovered 
intact or after it has been altered or destroyed. During a 
search, do not change or contaminate physical evidence in

TABLE 4.1 | Summary of Major Court Rulings Regarding Vehicle Searches
Case Decision
Holding
Carroll v. United States (1925)
Automobiles may be searched without a warrant if (1) there is probable 
cause for the search and (2) the vehicle would be gone before a search 
warrant could be obtained.
Chambers v. Maroney (1970)
A vehicle may be taken to headquarters to be searched.
South Dakota v. Opperman (1976)
Warrantless routine inventory searches of automobiles impounded 
or otherwise in lawful police custody, pursuant to standard police 
procedures, are reasonable and not prohibited by the Fourth 
Amendment.
New York v. Belton (1981)
After a custodial arrest of an occupant of the vehicle, ofﬁ cers may 
conduct an immediate search of the vehicle, following the rule that the 
search is incident to arrest. The search must be limited to the passenger 
compartment and may be a general search without a speciﬁ c object in 
mind. The search may include closed containers.
United States v. Ross (1982)
A search may be made when probable cause exists to believe that 
contraband or evidence is within the vehicle. This includes the trunk or 
closed containers in the vehicle.
Texas v. Brown (1983)
Contraband or evidence in plain view may be conﬁ scated. Two 
conditions must exist: (1) The ofﬁ cer must be legally present and (2) 
there must be probable cause to believe that the object in plain view is 
contraband or the instrumentality of a crime.
Florida v. Jimeno (1990)
A warrantless search may be made when consent is obtained from the 
owner or person in possession of the vehicle. The entire vehicle may 
be searched, including closed containers, unless the consenter has 
expressed limitation.
Florida v. Wells (1990)
The contents of a lawfully impounded vehicle may be inventoried for 
purposes of property accountability, public safety and protection against 
later claims of damage or loss of property.
United States v. Ibarra (1991)
If there is no statutory authority to impound, the vehicle cannot be 
taken into custody legally; therefore, an inventory search under these 
circumstances would be inadmissible.
United States v. Bowhay (1993)
Because a department policy required ofﬁ cers to search everything, the 
ofﬁ cers had no discretion. Therefore, the presence of an investigative 
motive did not prohibit the inventory search.
Knowles v. Iowa (1998)
When an ofﬁ cer issues a citation instead of making an arrest, a full 
search of the driver’s car violates the Fourth Amendment.
Wyoming v. Houghton (1999)
An ofﬁ cer may search an automobile passenger’s belongings simply 
because the ofﬁ cer suspects the driver has done something wrong. 
This “passenger property exception” ruling was intended to prevent 
drivers from claiming that illegal drugs or other contraband belonged to 
passengers, rather than themselves.
Thornton v. United States (2004)
Police can search the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to 
arrest when the arrestee was approached after recently occupying that 
vehicle.
Brendlin v. California (2007)
Ofﬁ cers must have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to stop 
a vehicle. If ofﬁ cers have no lawful basis for a trafﬁ c stop, anyone 
in the car—the driver or its passengers—may challenge the stop’s 
constitutionality.

106 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
the time limits imposed by weather and light conditions 
and the circumstances of the individual crime scene. 
Search patterns ensure thoroughness.
EXTERIOR SEARCHES 
Exterior searches can cover small, large or vast areas. 
Regardless of the dimensions, the area to be searched 
can be divided into subareas and diagrammed on paper. 
As each area is searched, check it oﬀ . Be certain suﬃ  cient 
light is available. A search conducted with inadequate 
light can destroy more evidence than it yields. If weather 
conditions are favorable, delay nighttime searches until 
daylight if feasible.
Exterior search patterns divide an area into lanes, strips, 
concentric circles or zones.
Lane-Search Pattern Th e lane-search pattern parti-
tions the area into lanes, or narrow strips, using stakes and 
string, as illustrated in Figure 4.2. An oﬃ  cer is assigned to 
each lane. Th erefore, the number of lanes used depends 
on the number of oﬃ  cers available to search.
 
Th ese lanes can be imaginary. Oﬃ  cers’ search widths 
vary from arm’s length to shoulder-to-shoulder, either on 
foot or on their knees. Such searches use no string or cord 
to mark the lanes.
 
If only one oﬃ  cer is available for the search, the lane 
pattern can be adapted to what is commonly called the 
strip-search pattern, illustrated in Figure 4.3.
 
For an extensive search, the lane pattern is often 
modiﬁ ed to form a grid, and the area is crisscrossed, as 
illustrated in Figure 4.4.
Circle-Search Pattern Another commonly used pat-
tern is the circle search, which begins at the center of 
an area to be searched and spreads out in ever-widening 
concentric circles (Figure 4.5).
 
A wooden stake with a long rope is driven into the 
ground at the center of the area to be searched. Knots are 
tied in the rope at selected regular intervals. Th e searcher 
circles around the stake in the area delineated by the ﬁ rst 
knot, searching the area within the ﬁ rst circle. When this 
area is completed, the searcher moves to the second knot 
and repeats the procedure. Th e search is continued in 
ever-widening circles until the entire area is covered.
Zone- or Sector-Search Pattern In the zone  or sec-
tor search, an area is divided into equal squares on a map 
of the area and each square is numbered. Search person-
nel are assigned to speciﬁ c squares (Figure 4.6).
the scene is considered to be a true, or uncontaminated, 
scene; that is, no evidence has been introduced into it or 
taken from it except by the person who committed the 
crime.
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Physical evidence ranges in size from very large objects 
to minute substances. Understanding what types of evi-
dence can be found at various types of crime scenes is 
important to the search. Not everything found at a scene 
is evidence.
Knowing what to search for is indispensable to an effec-
tive crime scene search. Physical evidence is anything 
material and relevant to the crime being investigated.
 
Th e elements of the crime help to determine what will 
be useful as evidence. For example, a burglary requires an 
illegal entry; therefore, tool marks and broken glass in a 
door or window are evidence that help prove burglary.
 
A forcible rape requires a sexual act against a victim’s 
will. Th erefore, bruises, semen stains or witnesses hear-
ing screams would help establish evidence of that crime. 
Speciﬁ c types of evidence to seek are discussed in Chapter 
5 and throughout Sections 3, 4 and 5.
 
Besides knowing what types of evidence to search for, 
investigators must know where evidence is most likely to 
be found. For example, evidence is often found on or near 
the route used to and from a crime. A suspect may drop 
items used to commit a crime or leave shoe or tire prints. 
Evidence is also frequently found on or near a dead body.
 
Th e “elephant-in-a-matchbox” doctrine requires 
that searchers consider the probable size and shape of evi-
dence they seek because, for example, large objects can-
not be concealed in tiny areas. Ignoring this doctrine can 
result in a search that wastes resources, destroys poten-
tial evidence and leaves a place in shambles. It may also 
result in violating the Fourth Amendment requirements 
on reasonable searches.
SEARCH PATTERNS
All search patterns have a common denomina-
tor: Th ey are designed to locate systematically 
any evidence at a crime scene or any other area where evi-
dence might be found. Most patterns involve partitioning 
search areas into workable sizes. Th e search pattern should 
be adapted to the area involved, the personnel available,

Th e ﬂ oor usually produces the most evidence, fol-
lowed by doors and windows. Although the ceiling is 
often missed in a search, it too can contain evidence such 
as stains or bullet holes. It can even contain such unlikely 
evidence as footprints. Footprints were found on the ceil-
ing by an alert oﬃ  cer during a bank burglary investiga-
tion. Paperhangers had left wallpaper on the bank’s ﬂ oor 
during the night and had hung it on the ceiling early the 
next morning before the burglary was discovered. During 
the night, one burglar had stepped on the wallpaper, leav-
ing a footprint that was transferred in a faint outline to 
the ceiling.
 
An interior room search usually starts at the point of 
entry. Th e ﬂ oor is searched ﬁ rst so no evidence is inadver-
tently destroyed during the remainder of the search. Th e 
INTERIOR SEARCHES
Most searches are interior searches. Th e foregoing exte-
rior search patterns can be adapted to an interior crime 
scene. Of prime concern is to search thoroughly without 
destroying evidence.
Interior searches go from the general to the speciﬁ c, 
usually in a circular pattern, covering all surfaces of a 
search area. The ﬂ oor should be searched ﬁ rst.
 
In making an interior search, look closely at all room 
surfaces, including the ﬂ oor, ceiling, walls and all objects 
on the ﬂ oor and walls. Evidence can be found on any 
surface.

CHAPTER 4 | Searches | 109
PLAIN-SENSE EVIDENCE
Th e limitations on searches are intended to protect the 
rights of all citizens and to ensure due process of law. Th ey 
are not intended to hamper investigations, nor do they 
preclude the use of evidence that is not concealed and is 
accidentally found through any of the oﬃ  cer’s senses. Th e 
most common type of plain-sense evidence is that seen by 
an oﬃ  cer.
Plain-View Evidence Anywhere oﬃ  cers have a right to 
be, they have a right to see. Petrocelli (2006, p.14) points 
out, “Th e plain-view doctrine allows law enforcement oﬃ  -
cers to seize contraband or evidence of a crime without 
ﬁ rst obtaining a search warrant.” Th is doctrine puts few 
constraints on oﬃ  cers and often yields very productive 
results.
Plain-view evidence—unconcealed evidence seen by 
an ofﬁ cer engaged in a lawful activity—is admissible in 
court.
 
Although the Fourth Amendment prohibits unrea-
sonable intrusions into a person’s privacy, the precedent 
for plain-view evidence was established in Katz v. United 
States (1967) when the Supreme Court held, “Th e Fourth 
Amendment protects people, not places. What a person 
knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home 
or oﬃ  ce, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protec-
tion. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an 
lane- or zone-search patterns are adaptable to an interior 
ﬂ oor search.
 
After the ﬂ oor search, the walls—including doors and 
windows—and then the ceiling are searched, normally 
using a clockwise or counterclockwise pattern around the 
room. Because doors and windows are points of entry and 
exit, soil, ﬁ ngerprints, glass fragments and other evidence 
are often found there. Walls may contain marks, blood-
stains or trace evidence such as hairs or ﬁ bers.
 
After a room is searched in one direction, it is often 
searched in the opposite direction because lighting is dif-
ferent from diﬀ erent angles. Th e same general procedures 
are followed in searching closets, halls or other rooms oﬀ  
the main room. Th e search is coordinated, and the loca-
tion of all evidence is communicated to members of the 
search team.
GENERAL GUIDELINES
Th e precise search pattern used is immaterial as long 
as the search is systematic and covers the entire area. 
Assigning two oﬃ  cers to search the same area greatly 
increases the probability of discovering evidence. Finding 
evidence is no reason to stop a search. Continue search-
ing until the entire area is covered. Schonely (2007, p.60) 
notes, “Many oﬃ  cers search like it is a race and they are 
being timed to complete the task. Th ese oﬃ  cers will miss 
many suspects over their careers. . . . Slowing down and 
being patient will allow your senses to work as you com-
plete the search.”

OTHER TYPES OF 
INVESTIGATORY SEARCHES
In addition to crime scene searches, oﬃ  cers 
may search buildings, trash or garbage cans, 
vehicles, suspects and dead bodies as they investigate 
criminal oﬀ enses.
BUILDING SEARCHES
Oldham (2006, p.73) contends, “Building search and the 
entry into non-secured areas is one of the most intricate 
skills that are not routinely taught to police oﬃ  cers.” 
When executing a warrant to search a building, oﬃ  cers 
should ﬁ rst familiarize themselves with the location and 
the past record of the person living there. Check records 
for any previous police actions at that location. Decide on 
the least dangerous time of day for the suspect, the police 
and the neighborhood. For example, the time of day when 
children come home from school would not be a good time 
to execute a warrant.
 
Do not treat the execution of a search warrant as rou-
tine. Plan for the worst-case scenario. Th ink safety ﬁ rst 
and last. Arrive safely. Turn oﬀ  your vehicle’s dome light 
as you approach the building. Stay away from the head-
lights or turn them oﬀ . Use any available cover as you 
approach the building.
 
Have a plan before entering the building. Secure the 
outside perimeter and as many exits as possible—at a 
minimum, the front and rear doors. If possible, call for 
a backup before entering and search with a partner. Old-
ham (2006, p.73) stresses, “Oﬃ  cers should clear the fatal 
funnel in a rapid fashion and then slow down to perform 
search operations.” Th e fatal funnel is a zone that exists 
outside the door and inside the doorway: “Th is area is the 
ultimate choke point where the oﬃ  cers are the most vul-
nerable” (Oldham, p.74). Once inside, wait for your vision 
to adjust to interior light conditions.
 
Keep light and weapons away from your body. Reduce 
the audio level of your radio, and turn oﬀ  your beeper. 
Go quickly through doors into dark areas. When moving 
around objects, take quick peeks before proceeding. Avoid 
windows. Use light and cover to your advantage. Know 
where you are at all times and how to get back to where 
you were. Look for exits. If the entire building is to be 
searched, use a systematic approach. Secure each area as 
it is searched.
 
Sometimes when police search a suspect’s home 
under authority of a search warrant, several people may 
be present, perhaps outnumbering the oﬃ  cers on the 
area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally pro-
tected.” In both Michigan v. Tyler (1978) and Mincey v. Ari-
zona (1978), the Court ruled that while oﬃ  cers are on the 
premises pursuing their legitimate emergency activities, 
any evidence in plain view may be seized.
 
Containers can be opened where their outward appear-
ance reveals criminal contents, for example, a kit of bur-
glar tools or a gun case (Rutledge, 2007c, p.71). By their 
nature, they do not support a reasonable expectation of 
privacy because their contents can be inferred from their 
appearance.
 
An oﬃ  cer cannot obtain a warrant and fail to men-
tion a particular object and then use “plain view” to justify 
its seizure. If the oﬃ  cer is looking for it initially, it must 
be mentioned in the warrant. Plain-view evidence itself is 
not suﬃ  cient to justify a warrantless seizure of evidence; 
probable cause must also exist.
 
Oﬃ  cers may seize any contraband they discover dur-
ing a legal search. In Boyd v. United States (1886), Justice 
Bradley stated, “Th e search for and seizure of stolen or 
forfeited goods or goods liable to duties and concealed to 
avoid payment thereof, are totally diﬀ erent things from a 
search or a seizure of a man’s private books and papers. In 
one case the government is entitled to the property, and 
in the other it is not.”
Plain Feel/Touch Th e “plain feel/touch” exception is 
an extension of the plain-view exception. If a police oﬃ  -
cer lawfully pats down a suspect’s outer clothing and feels 
an object that he immediately identiﬁ es as contraband—in 
other words, plain feel/touch evidence—a warrantless 
seizure is justiﬁ ed because there is no invasion of the sus-
pect’s privacy beyond that already authorized by the oﬃ  -
cer’s search for weapons (Minnesota v. Dickerson, 1993).
Plain Smell Evidence may also be seized if an oﬃ  cer 
relies on a sense other than sight or touch. For example, 
a customs oﬃ  cer who smells marijuana coming from a 
package has probable cause to make an arrest under a 
“plain-smell” rationale (United States v. Lueck, 1982). Rut-
ledge (2007c, p.71) notes, “Some distinctive odors can be 
detected by oﬃ  cers (for example, the odor of gasoline in 
an arson investigation); some can be detected by trained 
dogs. Merely smelling the air surrounding a suspect, his 
vehicle or some container does not constitute a search. If 
the odor reveals the presence of seizable objects, they may 
be seized.”
Plain Hearing Oﬃ  cers or undercover agents can posi-
tion themselves in accessible locations where they can 
overhear criminal conversation without any extraordinary 
listening devices (such as wiretaps or parabolic micro-
phones). Anything overheard can be used as evidence.

CHAPTER 4 | Searches | 111
surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the 
area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect 
the area from observation by people passing by.”
 
Searches of trash may also extend to the local 
landﬁ ll.
VEHICLE SEARCHES
Cars, aircraft, boats, motorcycles, buses, trucks and vans 
can contain evidence of a crime. Again, the type of crime 
determines the area to be searched and the evidence to 
be sought. In a hit-and-run accident, the car’s undercar-
riage can have hairs and ﬁ bers or the interior may reveal a 
hidden liquor bottle. In narcotics arrests, various types of 
drugs are often found in cars, planes and boats. An ordinary 
vehicle has hundreds of places to hide drugs. In some cases, 
vehicles may have specially constructed compartments.
 
As with other types of searches, a vehicle search must 
be systematic and thorough. Evidence is more likely to be 
found if two oﬃ  cers conduct the search.
Remove occupants from the car. First, search the area 
around the vehicle and then the exterior. Finally, search 
the interior along one side from front to back, and then 
return along the other side to the front.
 
Before entering a vehicle, search the area around it 
for evidence related to the crime. Next, examine the vehi-
cle’s exterior for ﬁ ngerprints, dents, scratches or hairs 
and ﬁ bers. Examine the grill, front bumper, fender areas 
and license plates. Open the hood and check the numer-
ous recesses of the motor, radiator, battery, battery case, 
engine block, clutch and starter housings, ventilating 
ducts, air ﬁ lter, body frame and supports. Open the trunk 
and examine any clothing, rags, containers, tools, the 
spare-tire well and the trunk lid’s interior.
 
Finally, search the vehicle’s interior, following the 
same procedures used in searching a room. Vacuum the 
car before getting into it. Package collections from dif-
ferent areas of the car separately. Th en systematically 
examine ashtrays, the glove compartment, areas under 
the seats and the window areas. Remove the seats and 
vacuum the ﬂ oor. Hairs and ﬁ bers or traces of soil may be 
discovered that will connect a suspect with soil samples 
from the crime scene.
 
Use a ﬂ ashlight and a mirror to examine the area 
behind the dashboard. Feeling by hand is not eﬀ ective 
because of the numerous wires located there. Look for ﬁ n-
gerprints in the obvious places: window and door handles, 
underside of the steering wheel, radio buttons, ashtrays, 
distributor cap, jack, rearview mirror, hood latches and 
seat adjustment levers.
scene, creating problems of safety and control. Guidelines 
for this situation were established in Michigan v. Summers 
(1981) when the Supreme Court stated, “We hold that a 
warrant to search for contraband founded on probable 
cause carries with it the limited authority to detain the 
occupants of the premises while a proper search is con-
ducted.” Th e Court did not say whether detained individ-
uals could be handcuﬀ ed or for how long they could be 
detained.
 
Law enforcement oﬃ  cers may also require residents 
to remain outside their home until a search warrant can 
be obtained if the oﬃ  cers have probable cause to believe 
the home contains evidence of illegal activity (Illinois v. 
McArthur, 2001).
 
Oﬃ  cers should be aware of the ruling in Kyllo v. 
United States (2001), which held that thermal scanning 
of a private residence from outside the residence is a 
search under the Fourth Amendment and requires a 
search warrant. Th e Kyllo decision is a slight respite from 
government-sponsored surveillance. 
TRASH OR GARBAGE CAN SEARCHES
Trash and garbage cans in alleys and on public sidewalks 
are often the depository for evidence of thefts, drug pos-
session and even homicides. In California v. Greenwood 
(1988), the Supreme Court ruled that containers left on 
public property are open to search by police without a war-
rant. Th e Supreme Court ruled that such a search does not 
constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment or a rea-
sonable expectation of privacy: “It is common knowledge 
that plastic garbage bags left on a public street are readily 
accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and 
other members of the public,” and therefore “no reason-
able expectation of privacy” is violated by such a search. 
Trash or garbage containers on private property may not 
be searched without a warrant.
 
Th e most important factor in determining the legality 
of a warrantless trash inspection is the physical location of 
the retrieved trash. Police cannot trespass to gain access 
to the trash location, and the trash must not be located 
within the curtilage, which the Supreme Court has 
described as “the area to which extends the intimate activ-
ity associated with the sanctity of a man’s home and the 
privacies of life.” In other words, curtilage is that portion 
of a residence that is not open to the public. It is reserved 
for private owner or family use, and an expectation of pri-
vacy exists. Th is is in contrast to sidewalks and alleys that 
are used by the public. In United States v. Dunn (1987), the 
Court ruled, “We believe that curtilage questions should 
be resolved with particular reference to four factors: 
the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the 
home, whether the area is included within an enclosure 

112 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
 
Stonebrook (2005, p.10) notes, “Th e Fourth Amend-
ment permits oﬃ  cers executing high-risk search warrants 
for dangerous people, weapons, or contraband to hand-
cuﬀ  and detain occupants of the premises during the 
conduct of the search. Mere police questioning of those 
who are detained does not, by itself, constitute a seizure 
or require Fourth Amendment justiﬁ cation.” Before con-
ducting any search, ask the suspect if he has anything on 
him that could get the oﬃ  cer into trouble, asking speciﬁ -
cally about needles and blades. When possible, search a 
suspect while a cover oﬃ  cer observes. If arresting the sus-
pect, ﬁ rst handcuﬀ  and then search. Every search should 
be done wearing protective gloves. 
Thorough Search If you arrest a suspect, conduct a 
complete body search for both weapons and evidence. 
Whether you use an against-the-wall spread-eagle search 
or a simple stand-up search, follow a methodical, exact 
procedure. Th e complete body search often includes tak-
ing samples of hair and ﬁ ngernail scrapings as well as test-
ing for ﬁ rearm residue when appropriate. Regardless of 
whether an arrest has been made, respect the suspect’s 
dignity while conducting the patdown or search, but keep 
your guard up.
 
Strip searches may be conducted only after an arrest 
and when the prisoner is in a secure facility. Such searches 
should be conducted by individuals of the same gender 
as the suspect and in private and should follow written 
guidelines. Considerations in deciding when a strip search 
is necessary include the individual’s past behavior, the 
possibility the person is concealing dangerous drugs or 
weapons, whether the person will be alone or with others 
in a cell and how long the person will be in custody. Cavity 
 
Figure 4.7 illustrates the areas of vehicles that should 
be searched. Th e vehicle is divided into speciﬁ c search 
areas to ensure order and thoroughness.
 
As in any other search, take precautions to prevent 
contaminating evidence. Be alert to what is an original 
part of the vehicle and what has been added. For example, 
compartments for concealing illegal drugs or other contra-
band are sometimes added. Th e systems and equipment 
of the vehicle should be validated. Is the exhaust real or 
phony? Check recesses and cup holders for sneaker ﬂ ip 
panels that may contain contraband or weapons. Check 
the headliner. In convertibles, check the boot.
 
Some oﬃ  cers use a wheeled platform that has dual peri-
scopic mirrors and ﬂ uorescent lights and rolls easily under 
a vehicle, allowing them to view its underside. A handheld 
model is also available, allowing viewing of vehicle interiors, 
engine compartments and tops of high-proﬁ le vehicles.
SUSPECT SEARCHES
How a suspect should be searched depends on whether 
an arrest has been made. If you have reasonable suspicion 
to stop or probable cause to arrest a person, be cautious. 
Many oﬃ  cers are injured or killed because they fail to 
search a suspect. If a suspect is in a car, have him or her 
step out of the car, and be careful to protect yourself from 
a suddenly opened door.
If the suspect has not been arrested, conﬁ ne your search 
to a patdown or frisk for weapons. If the suspect has been 
arrested, make a complete body search for weapons and 
evidence. In either event, always be on your guard.

patting, rather than grabbing, motions to avoid being 
stuck by sharp objects such as hypodermic needles. Tech-
niques for collecting evidence that may be contaminated 
with the AIDS virus are discussed in the next chapter.
 
Weather can be another factor that compromises the 
thoroughness of a search. Driving rains, freezing or swel-
tering temperatures, blowing snow—all may entice an 
oﬃ  cer to hurry through a search.
DEAD BODY SEARCHES
Searching a dead body should be done only after the coro-
ner or medical examiner has arrived or given permission. 
In one case, a well-meaning oﬃ  cer turned a body over 
to search for identiﬁ cation before the medical examiner 
arrived. Th is caused major problems in documenting the 
body’s position.
 
Searching a dead body is unpleasant, even when the 
person has died recently. It is extremely unpleasant if 
the person has been dead for a long period. In some such 
cases, the body can be searched only in the coroner’s 
examination room, where eﬀ ective exhaust ventilation is 
available.
Search a dead body systematically and completely. 
Include the immediate area around and under the body.
 
Th e search usually begins with the clothing, which 
is likely to reveal a wallet or personal identiﬁ cation 
papers as well as trace evidence. If the body is not ﬁ n-
gerprinted at the scene, tie paper bags securely on the 
hands so that ﬁ ngerprinting can be done at the coro-
ner’s laboratory. If possible, place the body in a body 
bag to ensure that no physical evidence is lost while it is 
being transported.
 
Search the area around and beneath where the body 
lay immediately after it is removed. A bullet may have 
passed through part of the body and lodged in the ﬂ oor or 
the dirt beneath it. Trace evidence may have fallen from 
the body or clothing as the body was removed. Inventory 
and describe all items removed from the deceased.
 
Department policy determines the extent of a search 
at the scene. Normally a complete examination is delayed 
until the body is received by the coroner’s oﬃ  ce. Th e coro-
ner may take ﬁ ngernail scrapings, blood and semen sam-
ples and possibly some body organs to establish poisoning 
or the path of a bullet or knife.
 
Once the body is taken to a funeral home, its organs 
and ﬂ uids will be contaminated by burial preparation. 
Once the body is buried, it is a long, diﬃ  cult legal process 
to exhume it for further examination. If the body is cre-
mated, no further examination is possible.
searches go beyond the normal strip search and must fol-
low very strict departmental guidelines. Normally such 
searches should be conducted by medical personnel.
Inhibitors to a Thorough Search A variety of factors 
may inhibit an oﬃ  cer’s ability or desire to conduct a thor-
ough search of a suspect. Th e presence of bodily ﬂ uids is 
one factor that may interfere with a complete search. Th e 
threat of contracting AIDS or hepatitis infections in the 
line of duty has led police to consider using special equip-
ment when searching suspects. Goggles or face masks are 
other pieces of equipment that reduce personal contact 
with blood and other body ﬂ uids, the main carriers of 
these viruses. Oﬃ  cers must also be alert to suspects who 
may spit on or bite them.
 
Another inhibitor to thorough searches is a fear 
of needles. When searching, oﬃ  cers should avoid put-
ting their hands into suspects’ pockets. Th ey should use

contraband and evidence. Ofﬁ cers should take precautions to protect

diﬀ erent ways, using dogs to locate them has greatly 
assisted law enforcement oﬃ  cers. Attempts to mask drug 
odors from dogs trained to sniﬀ  out drugs are futile because 
dogs can smell more than one odor simultaneously.
 
In Illinois v. Caballes (2005), the Supreme Court con-
ﬁ rmed that a dog sniﬀ  was not a search under the Fourth 
Amendment, a ruling that reinforced law enforcement’s 
ability to identify drug traﬃ  ckers and users by using 
police K-9s in walk-around searches of vehicles stopped 
for traﬃ  c oﬀ enses. If, however, use of a drug-sniﬃ  ng 
canine prolongs a stop, the dog sniﬀ  may become an ille-
gal search.
 
Dogs have also been trained to detect explosives 
both before and after detonation. Th eir ability to detect 
explosives before detonation lessens the oﬃ  cer’s risk 
and can help prevent crimes. A study by the Law Enforce-
ment Assistance Administration and the Federal Aviation 
Authority demonstrated that dogs can locate explosives 
twice as often as people can. In the case of detonated 
explosives, dogs have helped locate bomb fragments hid-
den under piles of debris and at considerable distances 
from the detonation point.
 
As agents of the police, dogs are subject to the same 
legal limitations on searches that oﬃ  cers are. Court rul-
ings appear to highlight the beneﬁ ts of using K-9s to build 
probable cause to seize and arrest. In United States v. Place 
(1983), the Supreme Court ruled that exposing luggage 
located in a public place to a police K-9 sniﬀ  was not a 
search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In 
essence, such a ruling concedes that the use of dogs may 
lead to the same end via less intrusive means, thus sparing 
law enforcement other time-consuming steps required to 
eﬀ ect a legal search.
 
K-9s have also been used to seek and detain suspects. 
Courts have ruled that using K-9s can enhance the safety 
of oﬃ  cers, bystanders and suspects and that K-9s might 
be considered as less-lethal alternatives to deadly force. 
Guidelines for deploying K-9s are found in Graham v. Con-
nor (1989). Before deploying a K-9, a handler should con-
sider the totality of the circumstances and the available 
information, including the severity of the crime, whether 
the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of oﬃ  -
cers or others and whether the suspect is actively resisting 
arrest or attempting to evade arrest by ﬂ ight. Administra-
tors and trainers should be familiar with case law pertain-
ing to K-9s.
 
If a police department is not large enough to have or 
lacks suﬃ  cient need for a search dog and trained handler, 
learn where the nearest trained search dogs are and how 
they can be obtained if needed. Many major airports have 
dogs trained to locate explosives and may make these dogs 
available to police upon request.
UNDERWATER SEARCHES
Underwater searches might involve victim, aircraft, ﬁ re-
arm or vehicle recovery. Underwater searches are aﬀ ected 
by limited visibility, extreme water temperature, swift cur-
rents and hazardous materials. When a victim is located, 
the ﬁ rst concern is whether it is a crime scene or an acci-
dent scene. Th e normal body position of a drowning vic-
tim is face down and in a semi-fetal position. If a victim 
found underwater has straight limbs and closed ﬁ sts, this 
indicates the person may have been killed on land and 
rigor mortis had set in before the body was submerged.
 
Metal detectors are needed in most underwater 
searches—particularly pulse induction metal detectors, 
which are known for their deep seeking capabilities. 
Advances in the technology have reduced power require-
ments, resulting in longer battery life and decreased 
weight.
USE OF DOGS IN A SEARCH
“Field deployable electronic sensors or instruments 
can’t top dogs, which have been increasingly in 
demand since 9/11,” says Kanable (2007, p.68). Scarry 
(2006a, p.78) adds, “No doubt, canines remain a valuable 
asset for law enforcement. Th ey sniﬀ  out drugs, conduct 
building searches, and capture dangerous suspects.” Falk 
(2006, p.48) states, “Th ey [dogs] are good for bomb, chemi-
cal and drug detection; tracking both suspects and lost per-
sons; and ﬁ nding real and counterfeit money, land mines, 
people hiding, weapons, buried bodies or ﬁ re igniters/accel-
erants in arson cases.” A dog can search a building in 10 min-
utes, whereas it takes two or three oﬃ  cers an hour to conduct 
the same search: “Canines are a great force multiplier and a 
psychological advantage. Many suspects are not afraid of 
getting shot, Tasered, OC’d or even bean-bagged, but most 
of them fear police dogs and will give up very quickly when 
they know a police dog is on deck” (Smith, 2006, p.52).
 
Dogs are ideally suited to assist in searching large 
areas; areas with poor visibility, such as warehouses that 
may contain thousands of items; or any area with numer-
ous hiding places. In addition, using dogs for such pur-
poses lessens the physical risk to investigating oﬃ  cers.
Dogs can be trained to locate suspects, narcotics, 
explosives, cadavers and more.
 
Th e use of dogs to sniﬀ  out narcotics has been widely 
publicized. Because narcotics can be concealed in so many 

CHAPTER 4 | Searches | 115
such as school searches, searches of highly regulated 
businesses (such as firearms dealers, pawn shops 
and junkyards), employment and educational drug 
screening and the immediate search for “evanescent” 
evidence (such as blood-alcohol content) (Rutledge, 
2007e, p.56).
A REMINDER
Jetmore (2007b, p.26) stresses, “Ability to skill-
fully document in writing facts and circum-
stances that lead to logical inferences and reasonable 
conclusions remains a professional requirement in crimi-
nal investigation. Excellent investigative work is negated 
and the guilty may walk free if the legal framework on 
which it was based can’t be adequately explained.” Th e 
Fourth Amendment requires that oﬃ  cers’ actions be rea-
sonable: “Clearly outline in your report every detail known 
to you at the time so that a subsequent reviewing author-
ity has the full situation in mind when deciding whether 
your actions were reasonable given the totality of the cir-
cumstances” (Jetmore, p.30).
WARRANT CHECKLIST
Rutledge (2008, p.29) states, “For every entry 
and search not authorized by a recognized 
exception, a warrant is required.” He summarizes the 
 recognized exceptions from a somewhat diﬀ erent 
perspective:
 
No Search Warrant Required:
• • No search (plain sense, open ﬁ elds, abandoned 
property, private-party delivery, controlled delivery, 
exposed characteristics)
• • Independent justiﬁ cation (consent, probation or 
parole, incident to arrest, oﬃ  cer safety, booking 
search, inventory)
• • Exigent circumstances (rescue, protection of property, 
imminent destruction of evidence, fresh pursuit, 
escape prevention, public safety)
• • Fleeing target (car, van, truck, RV, bus, boat, aircraft, 
etc.) with PC and lawful access
 
The courts have also identified several “special 
needs” exceptions that do not fit into other categories, 
Specially trained K-9s can be invaluable 
in searching for drugs or explosives.

evidence seen by an oﬃ  cer engaged in a lawful activity—is 
admissible in court.
 
In addition to crime scenes, investigators frequently 
search vehicles, suspects and dead bodies. When search-
ing a vehicle, remove the occupants from the car. First, 
search the area around the vehicle, then the vehicle’s 
exterior. Finally, search the interior along one side from 
front to back and then return along the other side to the 
front. Vehicles may be searched without a warrant if there 
is probable cause and if the vehicle would be gone before 
a search warrant could be obtained (Carroll). Chambers v. 
Maroney established that a vehicle may be taken to head-
quarters to be searched in certain circumstances.
 
When searching a suspect who has not been arrested, 
conﬁ ne the search to a patdown for weapons (Terry). If 
the suspect has been arrested, conduct a complete body 
search for weapons and evidence. Always be on your 
guard. Search a dead body systematically and completely; 
include the immediate area around and under the body. 
Specially trained dogs can be very helpful in locating sus-
pects, narcotics, explosives, cadavers and more.

CHECKLIST
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
Th e Fourth Amendment to the Constitution forbids unrea-
sonable searches and seizures. Th erefore, investigators 
must know what constitutes a reasonable, legal search. To 
search eﬀ ectively, know the legal requirements for search-
ing, the items you are searching for and the elements of 
the crime. Be organized, systematic and thorough.
 
Th e most important limitation on any search is that 
the scope must be narrow; general searches are unconsti-
tutional. If a search is not conducted legally, the evidence 
obtained is worthless. According to the exclusionary rule, 
evidence obtained in unreasonable search and seizure, 
regardless of how relevant the evidence may be, is inad-
missible in court. Weeks v. United States established the 
exclusionary rule at the federal level; Mapp v. Ohio made it 
applicable to all courts.
 
A search can be justiﬁ ed if (1) a search warrant has 
been issued, (2) consent is given, (3) an oﬃ  cer stops a sus-
picious person and believes the person may be armed, (4) 
the search is incidental to a lawful arrest or (5) an emer-
gency exists. Each of these situations has limitations. A 
search conducted with a warrant must be limited to the 
area and items speciﬁ ed in the warrant, in accordance 
with the particularity requirement. A search conducted 
with consent requires that the consent be voluntary and 
that the search be limited to the area for which the con-
sent was given. Th e search in a stop-and-frisk situation 
must be limited to a patdown for weapons. Th e Terry deci-
sion established that a patdown or frisk is a “protective 
search for weapons” and as such must be “conﬁ ned to a 
scope reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, 
and other hidden instruments for the assault of a police 
oﬃ  cer or others.” A search incidental to a lawful arrest 
must be made simultaneously with the arrest and be con-
ﬁ ned to the area within the suspect’s immediate control 
(Chimel). A warrantless search in the absence of a lawful 
arrest or consent is justiﬁ ed only in emergencies where 
probable cause exists, and the search must be conducted 
immediately.
 
A successful crime scene search locates, identiﬁ es and 
preserves all evidence present. For maximum eﬀ ective-
ness, a search must be well organized. Th is entails dividing 
the duties, selecting a search pattern, assigning personnel 
and equipment and giving instructions. Knowing what to 
search for is indispensable to an eﬀ ective search. Anything 
material and relevant to the crime might be evidence.
 
Search patterns have been developed that help ensure a 
thorough search. Exterior search patterns divide an area into 
lanes, strips, concentric circles or zones. Interior searches 
go from the general to the speciﬁ c, usually in a circular pat-
tern that covers all surfaces of the area being searched. Th e 
ﬂ oor is searched ﬁ rst. Plain-view evidence—unconcealed

“T
 
he evolution of law enforcement has
 
 beneﬁ ted greatly from the many 
extraordinary advances in the ﬁ eld of forensic science—
the application of scientiﬁ c processes to solve legal 
problems most notably within the context of the criminal 
justice system” (Fantino, 2007, p.26). Modern forensic 
science dates back to 1910 and the “exchange principle” 
set forth by French criminologist Edmond Locard. As 
explained in Chapter 1, Locard’s exchange principle states 
that whenever two objects come in contact with each 
other (e.g., a criminal and an object or objects at a crime 
scene), there is always a transfer of information, however 
minute, between them. In other words, a criminal always 
removes something from the crime scene and leaves 
behind incriminating evidence. Th e remnants of this 
transfer are called proxy data, the evidence analyzed by 
forensic scientists to uncover the relationships between 
people, places and objects.
A primary purpose of an investigation is to locate, 
identify and preserve evidence—data on which a judg-
ment or conclusion may be based. Evidence is used for 
determining the facts in a case, for later laboratory 
examination and for direct presentation in court. Best 
evidence, in the legal sense, is the original evidence 
or highest available degree of proof that can be pro-
duced. Investigators should be cognizant throughout 
an investigation of the best-evidence rule, which stipu-
lates that the original evidence is to be presented in 
court whenever possible. Other factors pertaining to 
admissibility of evidence will be discussed later in the 
chapter.
DEFINITIONS
Evidence is generally categorized as one of four 
types: testimonial, documentary, demonstra-
tive or physical. Testimonial evidence is information 
obtained through interviewing and interrogating individ-
uals about what they saw (eyewitness evidence), heard 
(hearsay evidence) or know (character evidence). Testi-
monial evidence is the subject of Chapter 6. Documentary 
evidence typically includes written material, audio record-
ings and videos. Demonstrative evidence includes mockups 
and scale models of objects or places related to the crime 
scene and helps juries visualize more clearly what they are 
unable to view personally. Occasionally, however, juries 
are taken to the crime scene if the judge deems it vital to 
the fair processing of the case, but this is expensive and 
time-consuming. Most commonly, investigators deal with 
physical evidence. Physical evidence is anything real—
that is, which has substance—that helps to establish the 
facts of a case. It can be seen, touched, smelled or tasted; 
is solid, semisolid or liquid; and can be large or tiny. It may 
be at an immediate crime scene or miles away; it may also 
be on a suspect or a victim.
Some evidence ties one crime to a similar crime or con-
nects one suspect with another. Evidence can also provide 
new leads when a case appears to be unsolvable. Further, 
evidence corroborates statements from witnesses to or 
victims of a crime. Convictions are not achieved from 
statements, admissions or confessions alone. A crime 
must be proven by independent investigation and physi-
cal evidence.
For example, in a small western town, a 6-year-old 
girl and her parents told police the girl had been sexually 
molested. Th e girl told police that a man had taken her to 
the desert, had shown her some “naughty” pictures that 
he burned and had then molested her. Because it was dif-
ﬁ cult for the police to rely on the girl’s statement, they 
needed physical evidence to corroborate her story. Fortu-
nately, the girl remembered where the man had taken her 
and led the police there. Th ey found remains of the burned 
pictures and conﬁ scated them as evidence. Th e remains of 
one picture, showing the suspect with a naked young girl 
on his lap, were suﬃ  cient to identify him by the rings on 
his ﬁ ngers. Th is physical evidence supporting the girl’s 
testimony resulted in a charge of lewdness with a minor.
Physical evidence can be classiﬁ ed in diﬀ erent ways. 
One common classiﬁ cation is direct and indirect evidence. 
Direct evidence establishes proof of a fact without 
any other evidence. Indirect evidence merely tends to 
incriminate a person—for instance, a suspect’s footprints 
found near the crime scene. Indirect evidence is also called 
circumstantial evidence, or evidence from which infer-
ences are drawn. A popular myth is that circumstantial evi-
dence will not stand alone without other facts to support 

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 123
it, but many convictions have been obtained primarily on 
circumstantial evidence.
Extremely small items, such as hair or ﬁ bers, are a 
subset of direct evidence called trace evidence. Evi-
dence established by law is called prima facie evidence. 
For example, 0.8 percent ethanol in the blood is direct or 
prima facie evidence of intoxication in some states. Asso-
ciative evidence links a suspect with a crime. Associative 
evidence includes ﬁ ngerprints, footprints, bloodstains, 
hairs and ﬁ bers.
Corpus delicti evidence establishes that a crime has 
been committed. Contrary to popular belief, the corpus 
delicti (“body of the crime”) in a murder case is not the 
dead body but the fact that death resulted from a criminal 
act. Corpus delicti evidence supports the elements of the 
crime. Pry marks on an entry door are corpus delicti evi-
dence in a burglary.
Probative evidence is vital to the investigation or 
prosecution of a case, tending to prove or actually prov-
ing guilt or innocence. Also of extreme importance to the 
investigator is exculpatory evidence, discussed in Chapter 
1, which is physical evidence that clears one of blame—for 
example, having a blood type diﬀ erent from that of blood 
found at a murder scene.
Material evidence forms a substantive part of the 
case or has a legitimate and eﬀ ective inﬂ uence on the deci-
sion of the case. Relevant evidence applies to the matter 
in question. Competent evidence has been properly col-
lected, identiﬁ ed, ﬁ led and continuously secured.
To locate and properly process evidence at a crime 
scene, investigators must have the necessary tools and 
equipment.
INVESTIGATIVE EQUIPMENT
Frontline police personnel who conduct a pre-
liminary investigation need speciﬁ c equip-
ment to accomplish their assigned tasks. Although not all 
crime scenes require all items of equipment, you cannot 
predict the nature of the next committed crime or the 
equipment you will need. Th erefore, you should have 
available at all times a crime scene investigation kit con-
taining basic equipment. Check the kit’s equipment after 
each use, replacing items as required.
Investigations can be simple or complex and can reveal 
little or much physical evidence. Consequently, the equip-
ment needs of each investigation are diﬀ erent. Table 5.1, 
alphabetized for easy reference, contains the investigative 
equipment most often used.
Although the list may seem extensive, numerous other 
items are also often used in investigations: bags, binocu-
lars, blankets, brushes, bullhorns, cable, capsules, chains, 
checklists, chemicals, chisels, coat hangers (to hang up 
wet or bloodstained clothing), combs, cotton, cutters, 
directories, drug kits, eyedroppers, ﬁ les, ﬁ xatives, ﬂ ares 
or fuses, ﬂ ood lamps, forceps, forms, gas masks, genera-
tors, gloves, guns, hammers, hatchets, levels, lights, mag-
nets, manuals, maps, matches, metal detectors, moulages 
(for making impressions or casts), nails, padlocks, pails, 
plastic sheets, punches, putty, rags, receipts, rubber, saws, 
scrapers, shovels, side cutters, solvent, sponges, sprays, 
stamps, swabs, syringes, tape, tape recorders, thermom-
eters, tin snips, towels, transceivers (to communicate in

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 125
EQUIPMENT CONTAINERS
Th e equipment can be put into one container or divided into 
several containers, based on frequency of use. Th is is an admin-
istrative decision determined by each department’s needs. 
Dividing equipment results in a compact, lightweight kit suit-
able for most crime scenes while ensuring availability of other 
equipment needed to investigate less common cases.
Carriers or containers come in all shapes, sizes, colors 
and designs. Briefcases, attaché cases and transparent plastic 
bags are convenient to use. Some commercially produced kits 
include basic equipment. However, many departments prefer 
to design their own kits, adapted to their speciﬁ c needs. Th e 
container should look professional, and a list of its contents 
should be attached to the outside or inside the cover.
TRANSPORTING EQUIPMENT
Crime scene investigative equipment is transported in 
a police vehicle, an investigator’s vehicle or a crime van. 
Th e equipment can be transported in the trunk of a car, 
or a vehicle can be modiﬁ ed to carry it. For example, spe-
cial racks can be put in the trunk, or the rear seat can be 
removed and special racks installed. Investigators are 
advised, when storing equipment in a car trunk, to orga-
nize items laterally instead of longitudinally, for if the car 
is involved in a high-speed rear-end collision, equipment 
oriented front-to-back can puncture through the back 
seat of the car or rupture the fuel tank.
A mobile crime lab is usually a commercially customized 
van that provides compartments to hold equipment and 
countertops for processing evidence. However, a van can-
not go directly to some crime scenes, so the equipment must 
be transported from the van in other containers. Th e most 
frequently used equipment should be in the most accessible 
locations in the vehicle. Substances that freeze or change 
consistency in temperature extremes should be protected.
large buildings, warehouses, apartment complexes or open 
areas), vacuums, wax, wire and wrenches. Th e blood-test 
kits, gun-residue kits and other ﬁ eld-test kits described in 
Chapter 1 are also used.
Newer, more specialized equipment for investigation 
may also include pagers, cellular phones, latex gloves, gog-
gles, metal detectors, electronic tracking systems, digital 
voice recorders, camcorders and much more, discussed 
throughout this section. Many departments are able to use 
forfeiture assets conﬁ scated during drug busts and other 
law enforcement eﬀ orts to purchase specialized investi-
gative equipment. Additional heavy-duty, less-portable  
types of equipment such as large pry bars or long ladders 
are frequently found on ﬁ re and rescue vehicles and can be 
used jointly by the police and ﬁ re departments.
SELECTING EQUIPMENT
Survey the types of crimes and evidence most frequently 
found at crime scenes in your jurisdiction. Select equip-
ment to process and preserve the evidence you are most 
likely to encounter. For example, because ﬁ ngerprints are 
often found at crime scenes, ﬁ ngerprint-processing equip-
ment should be included in the basic kit. However, you 
would probably not need to take a shovel along to inves-
tigate a rape.
After the basic equipment needs are identiﬁ ed, select 
speciﬁ c equipment that is frequently needed, lightweight, 
compact, high quality, versatile and reasonably priced. 
For example, boxes should either nest or be collapsible. 
Containers should be lightweight and plastic. Th e lighter 
and smaller the equipment, the more items can be car-
ried in the kit. Consider miniaturized electronic equip-
ment rather than heavier, battery-operated items. Select 
equipment that accomplishes more than one function, 
such as a knife with many features or other multipur-
pose tools.

126 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
CRIME SCENE INTEGRITY AND 
CONTAMINATION OF EVIDENCE
The value of evidence is directly aﬀ ected by what 
happens to it immediately following the crime. 
Evidence in an unprotected crime scene will degrade, dimin-
ish or disappear over time unless collected and preserved. 
Recalling Locard’s principle of exchange, the very act of col-
lecting evidence, no matter how carefully done, will result 
in a post-crime transfer of material—contamination.
To minimize contamination of a crime scene and the 
evidence within, cordon oﬀ  the area and keep all unnec-
essary people, including police oﬃ  cers, outside the scene 
perimeter. Law enforcement oﬃ  cers not assigned to the 
crime who walk through a scene out of curiosity can oblit-
erate clues and add trace evidence.
Make sure that evidence does not lose its value— 
its integrity—because of a contaminated crime scene. Integ-
rity of evidence refers to the requirement that any item 
introduced in court must be in the same condition as when 
it was found at the crime scene. Th is is documented by the 
chain of evidence, also called the chain of custody: docu-
mentation of what has happened to the evidence from the 
time it was discovered until it is needed in court, including 
every person who has had custody of the evidence and why.
All selected vehicles should be equipped with radio 
communication and be able to convey equipment to disas-
ter scenes as well as crime scenes—to make them cost-
eﬀ ective. Cost-eﬀ ectiveness can be further enhanced if 
the vehicles are available as command posts, for stakeouts 
and as personnel carriers.
Regardless of whether you work with a fully equipped 
mobile crime laboratory or a small, portable crime scene 
investigation kit, your knowledge and skills as an investi-
gator are indispensable to a successful investigation. Th e 
most sophisticated, expensive investigative equipment 
available is only as eﬀ ective as you are in using it.
TRAINING IN EQUIPMENT USE
Th e largest failure in gathering evidence is not the equip-
ment available but lack of training in using it eﬀ ectively. 
Each oﬃ  cer should understand the use and operation 
of each item of equipment in the kit. Expertise comes 
with training and experience. Periodic refresher sessions 
should be held to update personnel on new techniques, 
equipment and administrative decisions.
Once investigators have the proper equipment and 
are competent in using it, they are ready to begin ﬁ nd-
ing and processing evidence. Before actually stepping into 
the crime scene to process evidence, however, it is vitally 
important that investigators protect the integrity of the 
scene to keep it from becoming contaminated.
This all-purpose investigation kit was designed for general crime investigation. It contains materials for lifting and developing 
ﬁ ngerprints, along with a variety of specialized tools for gathering and storing evidence. (©BVDA America, Inc.)

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 127
Under-disclosure would deprive the original defendant 
of his constitutional right to a fair trial and could even 
lead to civil liability for law enforcement” (Means, 2008, 
p.12). Investigators must use common sense in what is 
or might be evidence.
Th e importance of physical evidence depends on its 
ability to establish that a crime was committed and to 
show how, when and by whom. Logic and experience help 
investigators determine the relative value of physical evi-
dence. Evidence in its original state is more valuable than 
altered or damaged evidence.
Probabilities play a large role in determining the value 
of evidence. Fingerprints and DNA, for example, provide 
positive identiﬁ cation. In contrast, blood type does not 
provide positive identiﬁ cation, but it can help eliminate a 
person as a suspect.
An object’s individuality is also important. For exam-
ple, a heel mark’s value is directly proportional to the 
number of its speciﬁ c features, such as brand name, num-
ber of nails and individual wear patterns that can be iden-
tiﬁ ed. Some objects have identiﬁ cation marks on them. 
Other evidence requires a comparison to be of value—a 
tire impression matching a tire, a bullet matching a spe-
ciﬁ c revolver, a torn piece of clothing matching a shirt.
A standard of comparison is an object, measure or 
model with which evidence is compared to determine whether 
both came from the same source. Fingerprints are the most 
familiar example of evidence requiring a standard of compari-
son. A ﬁ ngerprint found at a crime scene must be matched 
Th e value of evidence may also be compromised by 
improper collection, handling or identiﬁ cation. Th erefore, 
investigators’ evidence processing skills are extremely 
important.
PROCESSING EVIDENCE: 
MAINTAINING THE CHAIN OF 
CUSTODY FROM DISCOVERY 
TO DISPOSAL
Simply collecting physical evidence is not 
enough. To be of value, the evidence must be 
legally seized and properly and legally processed. Of 
importance at this point is processing evidence correctly. 
Th is includes discovering or recognizing evidence; collect-
ing, recording and identifying it; packaging, conveying 
and storing it; examining it; exhibiting it in court; and dis-
posing of it when the case is closed.
Processing physical evidence includes discovering 
or recognizing it; collecting, recording and identifying 
it; packaging, conveying and storing it; examining it; 
exhibiting it in court; and disposing of it when the case 
is closed.
DISCOVERING OR RECOGNIZING EVIDENCE
During a crime scene search, it is often diﬃ  cult to deter-
mine immediately what is or might be evidence. Numer-
ous objects are present, and not all are evidence.
To determine what is evidence, ﬁ rst consider the appar-
ent crime. Then look for any objects unrelated or foreign 
to the scene, unusual in location or number or damaged 
or broken or whose relation to other objects suggests a 
pattern that ﬁ ts the crime.
Recall from Chapter 4: “If you see property out in 
the open [in plain view], that’s immediately recogniz-
able as relating to a crime, chances are you can legally 
seize it” (Rutledge, 2006, p.82). Recall also that the 
Brady Rule requires law enforcement to gather all evi-
dence that helps establish guilt or innocence. Oﬃ  cers 
must, however, be aware of the risks inherent in both 
over- and under- disclosure: “Over-disclosure could 
unnecessarily muddy the waters of the case and, in 
some cases, harm the reputation of a witness oﬃ  cer. 
Evidence at a crime scene must be properly identiﬁ ed, collected and 
preserved to be of value. Crime scene tape helps protect the area 
from contamination or the destruction or removal of evidence. Here, 
investigators walk between police lines January 17, 2001, in front of 
the wreckage of a tractor-trailer truck that burned after crashing into 
the southern entrance of the California State Capitol building late 
January 16. The driver of the truck was killed in the crash. Although 
not entirely sure, police ofﬁ cials believe the crash was intentional 
and are treating the area as a crime scene. (© Reuters/CORBIS)

compartments. Police often use thermal imaging to detect 
heat generated by indoor marijuana-growing operations. 
However, recall from Chapter 4 that the Supreme Court 
has ruled that using thermal imaging to view inside a 
residence is a search under the Fourth Amendment and 
requires a search warrant.
COLLECTING, MARKING AND IDENTIFYING 
EVIDENCE
Once evidence is discovered, photograph and sketch it 
before collecting it. Th en, collect and identify all objects 
that are or may be evidence, leaving the ﬁ nal decision 
regarding relevance to the prosecutor.
with a known print to be of value. Likewise, a piece of glass 
found in a suspect’s coat pocket can be compared with glass 
collected from a window pane broken during a burglary.
Sometimes how an object ﬁ ts with the surroundings 
determines whether it is likely to be evidence. For exam-
ple, a man’s handkerchief found in a women’s locker room 
does not ﬁ t. Th e same handkerchief in a men’s locker room 
is less likely to be evidence.
Sometimes, to detect evidence, the human eye needs 
assistance. Tools and techniques available to enhance evi-
dence detection include forensic light sources and three-
dimensional (3-D) technology.
Forensic Light Sources Forensic light sources (FLSs), 
also called alternative light sources (ALSs), are becoming 
increasingly popular and easier to use. An FLS that works 
on the principle of ultraviolet ﬂ uorescence, infrared lumi-
nescence or laser light can make evidence visible that is 
not otherwise detectable to the naked eye, such as latent 
prints, body ﬂ uids and even altered signatures.
Ultraviolet (UV) light is the invisible energy at the 
violet end of the color spectrum that causes substances to 
emit visible light, commonly called ﬂ uorescence. Evidence 
that ﬂ uoresces, or glows, is easier to see—sometimes 
thousands of times easier. For some kinds of hard-to-
see evidence—small amounts of semen, for instance, or 
ﬁ bers—an FLS is the only practical way to make the invis-
ible visible. An inexpensive tool for investigators projects 
a ﬁ ltered light beam onto evidence dusted with ﬂ uorescent 
powder, and a luminescent print appears immediately. A 
portable long-wave UV-light source can illuminate latent 
prints on several types of objects. Evidence is then exposed 
to superglue (cyanoacrylate), then stained or dusted. After 
this, it can be viewed under the UV light source.
Lasers can also assist in investigations: “Evidence col-
lection has beneﬁ ted greatly from lasers. Th ey can be used 
for trajectory analysis, measurement and evidence collec-
tion in and out of the lab. Because of their high intensity 
light beam compared to alternative light sources (ALSs), 
lasers also are capable of uncovering evidence often missed 
by other ALSs and are able to show evidence in greater 
detail and clarity, without spraying or special treatment” 
(Mills-Senn and Kozlowski, 2006, p.186).  
Th ermal imaging is another common forensic light 
technique. In one case, a motorcyclist driving along a 
highway had shot a trucker. Th e crime scene was 1.5 miles 
long, and oﬃ  cers had 14 shell casings to locate. Using a 
thermal imager, they were able to recover all 14 casings.
Th e Law Enforcement Th ermographers Association 
(LETA) has approved thermal imaging for search and res-
cue missions, fugitive searches, perimeter surveillance, 
vehicle pursuits, ﬂ ight safety, marine and ground surveil-
lance, structure proﬁ les, disturbed surfaces and hidden 
Technology Innovations
Spraggs (2008, p.39) describes the TracER foren-
sic laser, which illuminates evidence details not 
easily seen by other means:
TracER stands for Trace Evidence Recovery. This 
diode-based solid state laser provides a whopping 
5 watts of power output in a completely self-
contained portable light source. The TracER is mar-
keted as weighing less than 50 pounds and costing 
under $50,000. At close to 50 pounds the TracER 
is certainly not light, but this weight includes its 
built-in DC (direct current) power supply and 
battery. . . . [T]he TracER is unique because it can 
be powered from a standard 110 volt AC outlet or it 
can run off its integrated battery for about 1.5 hours 
of continuous use. This means no more portable 
generators and extension cords in your remote 
crime scenes.
Physically, the TracER is about the size of a 
large breadbox. It has a carrying handle on top and 
a 15-foot ﬁ ber optic cable that delivers the laser 
light. This cable terminates in a hand wand that 
allows the user to adjust the spread of the laser 
with an optical zoom, as well as control the light 
intensity. . . .
The Coherent TracER is a unique forensic 
laser light source that offers cutting-edge tech-
nology with incredible power and portability. It’s 
already in service with the FBI, the Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Border Patrol, 
as well as many smaller agencies throughout the 
United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 129
Common errors in collecting evidence are (1) not collect-
ing enough of the sample, (2) not obtaining standards of 
comparison and (3) not maintaining the integrity of the 
evidence.
To simplify testimony in court, one oﬃ  cer usually col-
lects evidence and another oﬃ  cer takes notes on the loca-
tion, description and condition of each item. Th e oﬃ  cer 
collecting evidence enters this information in personal 
notes or witnesses and initials the notes of the oﬃ  cer 
assigned to record information. All evidence is identiﬁ ed 
by the oﬃ  cer who collects it and by any other oﬃ  cer who 
takes initial custody of it.
Mark or identify each item of evidence in a way that can 
be recognized later. Indicate the date and case number 
as well as your personal identifying mark or initials.
Make your marking easily recognizable and as small 
as possible—to reduce the possibility of destroying part of 
the evidence. Mark all evidence as it is collected or received. 
Do not alter, change or destroy evidence or reduce its value 
by the identiﬁ cation marking. Where and how to mark 
depends on the item. A pen is suitable for some objects. A 
stylus is used for those that require a more permanent mark 
that cannot be done with a pen, such as metal boxes, motor 
parts and furniture. Other objects can be tagged, labeled or 
placed in containers that are then marked and sealed.
Record in your notes the date and time of collection, 
where the evidence was found and by whom, the case 
number, a description of the item and who took custody.
Evidence descriptions can be computer entered and 
cross-referenced to current cases in the local jurisdiction 
and the surrounding area.
PACKAGING AND PRESERVING EVIDENCE
Careful packaging maintains the evidence in its original 
state, preventing damage or contamination. Do not mix, 
or cross-contaminate, evidence. Package each item sepa-
rately, keeping in mind the speciﬁ c requirements for that 
type of evidence. Some evidence is placed in sterile con-
tainers. Other types, such as ﬁ ring-pin impressions or 
markings on a fatal bullet, are packed to prevent break-
age or wrapped in cotton to prevent damage to individual 
characteristics. Hairs, ﬁ bers and other trace evidence are 
often placed in paper that is folded so that the evidence 
cannot fall out. Th is is called a druggist fold (Figure 5.1).
Collecting evidence requires judgment and care. Put 
liquids in bottles. Protect cartridges and spent bullets 
with cotton, and put them in small containers. Put other 
items in appropriate containers to preserve them for 
later packaging and transporting. Th e scene of a violent 
crime should be vacuumed with a machine that has a ﬁ lter 
attachment. Th e vacuumed material can then be placed in 
an evidence bag and submitted to a crime laboratory.
Be sure to collect an adequate amount of the sample 
and to obtain standards of comparison, if necessary. Take 
extreme care to avoid cross-contamination, that is, 
allowing items of evidence to touch one another and thus 
exchange matter. When using the same tool for several 
tasks, be certain it is thoroughly cleaned after each use 
to prevent the transfer of material from one piece of evi-
dence to another.
Forensic light sources help investigators ﬁ nd hard-to-see 
crime evidence. Here, an examiner uses a UV light to detect 
body ﬂ uids and other trace evidence on a piece of cloth.

130 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Place a transmittal letter to the laboratory in an enve-
lope attached to the outside of the box. Th is letter should 
contain the name of the suspect and the victim, if any; indi-
cate what examinations are desired and which tests, if any, 
have already been done; and refer to any other pertinent 
correspondence or reports. Include a copy of the letter 
with the evidence, and mail the original separately. Retain 
a copy for your ﬁ les. Figure 5.3 shows a sample letter.
TRANSPORTING EVIDENCE
If the crime laboratory is nearby, an oﬃ  cer can deliver 
the evidence personally. However, even if the evidence is 
personally delivered, include with it a written request on 
department letterhead or a department form.
Personal delivery, registered mail, insured parcel post, 
air express, Federal Express (FedEx) and United Parcel 
Service (UPS) are legal ways to transport evidence. 
Always specify that the person receiving the evidence is 
to sign for it.
How evidence should be transported depends on its 
size and type and the distance involved. Use the fast-
est method available. If the package is mailed, request a 
return receipt.
PROTECTING AND STORING EVIDENCE
Before, during and after its examination, evidence must 
be securely protected and properly stored. Physical evi-
dence is subject to chemical change, negligence, accident, 
intentional damage, theft and alteration during handling. 
With proper storage, however, theft, loss, tampering, 
contamination and deterioration may be prevented. Pro-
tecting and storing evidence is often the weakest link in 
the chain of evidence. All too often defendants are found 
not guilty because evidence in the chain of custody is not 
documented and cannot be determined.
In addition to being secure, the storage area must be well 
organized and free from pests, insects and excessive heat 
or moisture. A proper storage area has ample space and is 
climate controlled, typically kept at 65° to 75° Fahrenheit. 
Evidence is stored in vaults, property rooms, evidence 
rooms, evidence lockers, garages or morgues or under spe-
cial conditions such as refrigeration. At a crime scene, an 
oﬃ  cer’s vehicle trunk can provide temporary storage.
Some evidence requires more care than others. 
Improperly sealed containers can allow liquid evidence to 
evaporate or moisture to enter. Envelopes can split open. 
Tags can fall oﬀ .
Package each item separately in a durable container to 
maintain the integrity of evidence.
Packaging is extremely important. Although some-
times plastic bags are used, few departments use plastic 
because it does not “breathe” and hence may cause conden-
sation to form. Th is can impede laboratory examination 
of the evidence. Many departments use new brown-paper 
grocery bags, especially for clothing. Although boxes may 
be better in some respects, they can be impractical to carry 
and diﬃ  cult to ﬁ nd. You can usually ﬁ nd a supermarket 
open somewhere if you run out of bags. Be sure to provide 
a means of sealing whatever type of container is used to 
maintain the integrity of the evidence.
Preserve evidence on immovable items at the scene. 
Often some reproduction of the evidence is made. Finger-
prints are developed, photographed, lifted and later com-
pared. Tool marks are reproduced through photography, 
modeling clay, moulage, silicone and other impression-
making materials. (Th ese methods are acceptable in accor-
dance with the best-evidence rule.) Speciﬁ c requirements 
for the most frequently found evidence and best evidence 
are discussed later.
Submit movable items directly into evidence or send 
them to a laboratory for analysis. Sometimes an object is 
both evidence and a container of evidence. For example, a 
stolen radio found in a suspect’s car is evidence of theft, 
and the ﬁ ngerprints of a second suspect found on the 
radio are evidence that links that person to the theft.
Before packaging evidence for mailing to a laboratory, 
make sure it was legally obtained and has been properly 
identiﬁ ed and recorded in your notes. Submitting inad-
missible evidence is costly and ineﬃ  cient. Pack any bulky 
item in a sturdy box, seal the box with tape and mark it 
“evidence.” If any latent evidence such as a ﬁ ngerprint is 
on the surface of the object (Figure 5.2), be sure to state 
this clearly.

custodian checks each piece of evidence to ensure that all 
forms are properly completed and that the evidence is the 
same as described in the forms. Figure 5.4 shows a sample 
evidence card.
Strict checkout procedures ensure that the evidence 
is always accounted for. Everyone who takes evidence 
signs for it, giving the date, time, place it is to be taken 
and purpose. When the evidence is returned, it is again 
signed for, dated and examined to ensure it is in the same 
condition as when taken. Any change in condition is noted 
and explained.
Property Management Securing, storing and tracking 
evidence is no small task. Each article must be accounted 
for. Some evidence, such as explosives or biohazardous 
Writing on labels can become smudged, blurred, or 
faded to the point of illegibility. Th erefore, take care to 
handle evidence gently, keeping it away from moisture 
and heat sources. Be sure to keep electronic evidence, 
such as computers and disks, away from strong magnets 
and other forces that may corrupt the data.
Package evidence properly to keep it in substantially 
the same condition in which it was found and store 
it securely. Document custody of the evidence at 
every stage.
All evidence received is recorded in a register, prop-
erly marked and put in an appropriate place. An evidence

of limitation (Kiley, 2008, p.1). Nonetheless, the conse-
quences of mishandling such property can range from pub-
lic embarrassment to ﬁ nancial liability, criminal charges 
against the department and the inadmissibility of key evi-
dence. Kiley (p.6) says, “In many evidence rooms, car parts,

cases and even tree limbs from nonviolent cases sit mixed

cialized facilities and features for safe storage.

EMPALL MERCHANDISE MART
BURGLARY
RE:
Sometime during the early morning of March 16, 20_ _,someone entered the Empall 
Merchandise Mart through an unlocked side window and made an unsuccessful 
attempt to rip open the safe.  The outer layer of metal on the safe door had been 
pried loose from the upper right corner and bent outward, ripping the metal along 
the top and down the side of the safe about 12" each way.  The burglar may have 
been scared away because the job was not completed.  Investigation led us to Guy 
Pidgin, who denies complicity.  He voluntarily let us take his shoes and trousers and 
a crowbar that was under his bed in his rooming house.
                          I am sending by Federal Express a package containing
the following evidence in this case:

(2006, p.18), an evidence technician, reports, “I averaged 
three to four hours each day entering new evidence into 
our RMS system. After the implementation of the barcode 
system, I spent 30 minutes at the most.” 
EXHIBITING EVIDENCE IN COURT
Evidence is of little value to a criminal case if it is inadmis-
sible in court. Th erefore, adherence to a strict protocol is 
essential to ensure that evidence may be used during a trial.
To ensure admissibility of evidence in court, be able to 
(1) identify the evidence as that found at the crime scene, 
(2) describe exactly where it was found, (3) establish its 
custody from discovery to the present and (4) voluntarily 
explain any changes that have occurred in the evidence.
Typically, the oﬃ  cer who will identify the evidence in 
court obtains it from the evidence custodian and delivers 
it to the prosecuting attorney, who takes it to the court-
room and introduces it at the proper time. Th e identifying 
oﬃ  cer uses the notes he or she made at the scene to lay 
the proper foundation for identifying the evidence.
In addition to the integrity of the evidence itself, con-
sideration should be given to how evidence is presented 
in court. Evidence presented in a dirty, battered card-
board box creates a much diﬀ erent image than evidence 
rapes and murders. Piles accumulate in cramped and aging 
rooms often not built to store evidence.”
A major crime scene investigation might generate 
more than 200 pieces of evidence. Th e amount of property 
that must be tracked and stored in metropolitan depart-
ments is typically 100,000 to 400,000 or more items. To 
account for so many items accurately and to maintain 
the chain of custody, each item must be categorized and 
described, including ownership (rightful, seized, found, 
etc.). Its location should be documented, as should its dis-
position (returned, auctioned, burned, etc.).
Automated evidence storage can prevent many prob-
lems. Computer programs are available to help manage the 
property/evidence room. Many property control systems 
are using bar codes, which are extremely eﬃ  cient and eﬀ ec-
tive. At the time property is “booked,” it is entered into a 
computer and given a bar code, which is aﬃ  xed to the item. 
During any subsequent signing in/out of the property, the 
chain of custody is updated by scanning the item’s evidence 
bar code into the log. Such a system provides an audit trail, 
helps with the inventory process and prints management 
and audit reports and disposition logs.
Handheld computers and portable printers capable 
of generating bar-coded labels are making the task of tag-
ging and securing evidence more manageable. Bar codes 
can also help reduce the time investigators need to spend 
collecting and recording evidence at complicated crime 
scenes, such as homicides or major traﬃ  c crashes. Turner

specify how to dispose of evidence, but most do not spec-
ify when this should occur. Th erefore, departments typi-
cally go by the statute of limitations for the type of case 
when deciding how long to hold items of evidence before 
disposing of them. Every criminal oﬀ ense has a statute of 
limitations except homicide, and these statutes vary from 
state to state.
In cases involving suspects, arrests, plea bargains or 
trials, evidence is held until the case is cleared, at which 
time personal property may be returned to the rightful 
owner. In cases in which prosecution is not anticipated, 
contraband items can be released at any time. In mis-
demeanor cases where there are no suspects or arrests 
after one year, the property can generally be returned 
to the owner, sold or destroyed. Items of evidence may 
also be returned or otherwise disposed of because the 
cases have exceeded the statute of limitations. As a gen-
eral rule, evidence for felony cases is held 3 to 5 years, 
and evidence in sexual assault cases is retained for 5 to 
6 years. However, when an appeal occurs or is antici-
pated or the case is a homicide, evidence must be main-
tained indeﬁ nitely.
Furthermore, guidelines for disposing of evidence 
are changing because of advancing forensic technologies, 
which are allowing cases to be solved many years after the 
commission of a crime. 
Evidence is either returned to the owner, auctioned or 
destroyed.
Evidence is either disposed of continuously, annu-
ally or on a special date. Departments using computerized 
evidence management programs can generate routine 
inventory reports that show the status of each case and 
whether the related evidence must be maintained or 
can be disposed of. Departments without such a sys-
tem must manually review the status of items and then 
either return them as evidence to storage or dispose of 
them. Witnessed aﬃ  davits of disposal list all items sold, 
destroyed or returned. Th e aﬃ  davits include the date, 
type of disposition, location and names of all witnesses to 
the disposition.
Whitehead (2007, pp.72–74) describes an innova-
tive approach to disposing of evidence that is no longer 
needed: an online auction.
PropertyRoom.com is an auction Web site created by 
retired police oﬃ  cers to take the burden of unclaimed 
property oﬀ  of police departments’ hands. And for 
many, the site saves them money and hassle in com-
parison to doing a local auction. . . .
presented in a clean, neatly labeled box. Simple details 
like this can make a diﬀ erence in jury perception, which, 
right or wrong, inﬂ uences the credibility of the prosecu-
tion’s case.
Frye and Daubert Scientiﬁ c evidence is commonly pre-
sented in court as part of either the prosecutor’s or the 
defense’s case and is frequently accompanied by expert tes-
timony. When assessing the admissibility of expert opin-
ions based on scientiﬁ c evidence or knowledge, courts look 
to the rulings of the Frye and Daubert cases for guidance. 
Th e opinion in Frye v. United States (1923) reads, in part, 
“Just when a scientiﬁ c principle or discovery crosses the 
line between the experimental and demonstrable stages 
is diﬃ  cult to deﬁ ne. Somewhere in this twilight zone the 
evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and 
while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testi-
mony deduced from a well-recognized scientiﬁ c principle 
or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made 
must be suﬃ  ciently established to have gained general accep-
tance in the particular ﬁ eld in which it belongs [emphasis 
added].”
Th e merits of Frye faced much debate, and the Frye 
test was eﬀ ectively displaced when the Supreme Court, in 
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals (1993), held that 
the Federal Rules of Evidence, not Frye, provide the stan-
dard for admitting expert scientiﬁ c testimony. Within the 
Rules is speciﬁ cally R.702, which speaks directly to expert 
testimony: “If scientiﬁ c, technical, or other specialized 
knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the 
evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness quali-
ﬁ ed as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, 
or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opin-
ion or otherwise.”
In its opinion summary, the Supreme Court stated, 
“‘General acceptance’ is not a necessary precondition to 
the admissibility of scientiﬁ c evidence under the Federal 
Rules of Evidence, but the Rules—especially R.702—do 
assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an 
expert’s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation 
and is relevant to the task at hand. Pertinent evidence 
based on scientiﬁ cally valid principles will satisfy those 
demands.”
Th is requirement that an expert’s testimony be both 
reliable and relevant is known as the two-pronged Daubert 
standard.
FINAL DISPOSITION OF EVIDENCE
Evidence must be legally disposed of to prevent major 
storage problems as well as pilferage or unauthorized con-
version to personal use. State statutes and city ordinances

FINGERPRINTS
“Fingerprint analysis has been a staple of forensic inves-
tigation since the inception of crime investigation” (Han-
son, 2006, p.104). At the end of each human ﬁ nger, on 
the palm side, exists a unique arrangement of small lines 
called friction ridges, which provide just enough rough-
ness to give ﬁ ngers “traction” when holding or otherwise 
manipulating objects. Within these friction ridges lie 
sweat pores. When the sweat they produce mixes with 
body oils, dirt or other matter, that substance will rub oﬀ  
on any surface the ﬁ nger touches, leaving behind a print if 
the surface is relatively smooth.
Th ese prints are useful in criminal investigations 
because a person’s friction-ridge patterns are formed 
before birth and remain the same throughout that per-
son’s life. Th e lines in the thumbprint raindrops made 
by a second grader in art class will be the same pattern 
the person’s thumb will leave on the newspaper she reads 
every morning before going to work years later. Besides 
remaining consistent over time, prints are useful because 
they are unique—no two people have the same friction-
ridge pattern. Th erefore, ﬁ ngerprints are a positive way 
to prove that a suspect was at a crime scene. Th e implica-
tions of ﬁ nding identiﬁ able prints at the scene vary with 
each case. For example, prints may not be important if 
the suspect had a legitimate reason for being there. Often, 
however, this is not the case.
Although many laypeople assume that identiﬁ able 
ﬁ ngerprints are almost always found at a crime scene, in 
many cases none are found. Even when they are, it is often 
diﬃ  cult to locate the person who matches the prints. If a 
person’s prints are not on ﬁ le and there are no suspects, 
ﬁ ngerprints are virtually worthless. Other times, however, 
ﬁ ngerprints are the most important physical evidence in 
a case (Figure 5.5). Finding ﬁ ngerprints at a crime scene 
requires training and experience. Some surfaces retain 
prints more easily than others.
Fingerprints are of various types:
• • Latent ﬁ ngerprints are impressions transferred to a 
surface, either by sweat on the ridges of the ﬁ ngers or 
because the ﬁ ngers carry residue of oil, dirt, blood or 
 
Currently, 712 police departments in 41 states are 
using Property Room’s auction service. Th ere aren’t 
any upfront fees to sell through the auction company, 
and Property Room takes care of all the details, start-
ing with arranging for the pick up of property from the 
department. At the end of the auction, Property Room 
keeps half the proceeds from items that sell for less 
than $1,000. And if it sells for more than that, Property 
Room only keeps 25 percent from the sale. Th e company
estimates that about 98 percent of everything it 
 auctions, sells.
Having explored the path evidence generally takes 
during the course of an investigation, the discussion now 
turns to the most common types of evidence encountered 
and how they are examined.
FREQUENTLY EXAMINED 
EVIDENCE
The laboratory analyzes evidence associated 
with the physical characteristics of suspects 
using biometrics. Biometrics is the statistical study of 
biological data, which allows for positive identiﬁ cation of 
individuals. Biometric identiﬁ cation technology ranges 
from ﬁ ngerprints to techniques that recognize voices, 
hand geometry, facial characteristics and even blood ves-
sels in the iris of an eye. Fingerprints and iris recognition 
are considered most reliable, followed by facial and hand, 
with voice the least reliable.
Th e lab also analyzes the class and individual character-
istics of objects providing evidence. Class characteristics 
are the features that place an item into a speciﬁ c category. 
For example, the size and shape of a tool mark may indi-
cate that the tool used was a screwdriver rather than a 
pry bar. Individual characteristics are the features that 
distinguish one item from another of the same type. For 
example, chips and wear patterns in the blade of a screw-
driver may leave marks that are distinguishable from those 
of any other screwdriver. Whether the examination is done 
in house or by a public or private forensic lab, quality can 
be enhanced by using a lab that is accredited: “Participat-
ing in a forensic science accreditation program is the best 
hope of obtaining an unbiased evaluation of the forensic 
science operation within a law enforcement agency. . . 
.Th e consequences of shoddy, incompetent, or presumed 
results can be momentous, including costs of lawsuits for 
innocent convictions or ruined careers” (Fitzpatrick and 
Ely, 2007, p.50).

136 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
rearview mirrors. Examine objects that appear to have 
been moved. Consider the nature of the crime and how it 
was probably committed. Prints found on large, immov-
able objects are processed at the scene by photographing 
or dusting with powder or chemicals.
Dusting Latent Fingerprints Fingerprint dusting pow-
ders are available in various colors and chemical compo-
sitions to provide maximum development and contrasts. 
When dusting for ﬁ ngerprints, use a powder that con-
trasts in color to the surface.
Do not powder a print unless it is necessary, and do not 
powder a visible print until after you photograph it.
Spraggs (2007, p.26) cautions, “Th e number one mis-
take oﬃ  cers make is over-processing the latent ﬁ ngerprint. 
First rule: use less powder than you think you need.”
To dust for ﬁ ngerprints, follow these steps:
 1. Make sure the brush is clean. Roll the handle of the 
brush between your palms to separate the bristles.
 2. Shake the powder can to loosen the powder. Apply 
the powder lightly to the print, following the contour 
lines of the ridges to bring out details.
 3. Remove all excess powder.
 4. Photograph.
Use a camel-hair brush for most surfaces. Use an aspi-
rator for dusting ceilings and slanted or diﬃ  cult areas. If 
in doubt about which powder or brush to use, test them 
on a similar area ﬁ rst.
Learn to use the various materials by watching an 
experienced investigator demonstrate the correct pow-
ders, brushes and techniques. Th en practice placing latent 
other substance. Latent prints are not readily seen but 
can be developed through powders or chemicals. Th ey 
are normally left on nonporous surfaces.
• • Visible ﬁ ngerprints are made when ﬁ ngers are dirty 
or stained. Th ey occur primarily on glossy or light-
colored surfaces and can be dusted and lifted.
• • Plastic ﬁ ngerprints, one form of visible print, are 
impressions left in soft substances such as putty, 
grease, tar, butter or soft soap. Th ese prints are photo-
graphed, not dusted.
Any hard, smooth, nonporous surface can contain latent 
ﬁ ngerprints.
Nonporous surfaces include light switches; window 
frames and moldings; enameled surfaces of walls, doors 
and painted or varnished objects; wood; lamps; polished 
silver surfaces; and glass. Fingerprints often occur on doc-
uments, glass, metals, tools and weapons used in a crime 
as well as on any objects picked up or touched by a suspect 
or any other person. Objects such as ﬁ rearms, tools, small 
metal objects, bottles, glassware, documents and other 
transportable items are submitted to a laboratory, where 
the prints are developed by experts.
Some porous materials also produce latent prints. For 
example, paper and cloth surfaces have developed excel-
lent prints. Passing a ﬂ ashlight at an oblique angle over a 
surface helps to locate possible prints. Latent prints have 
even been collected from human skin.
Begin the search for ﬁ ngerprints by determining the 
entry and exit points and the route through a crime scene. 
Look in the obvious places as well as less-obvious places 
such as the underside of toilet seats and the back of car 
FIGURE 5.5
Three men checked into a motel at 11:00 P.M. 
Shortly after midnight, when a new desk 
clerk came on duty, the men went to the 
ofﬁ ce and committed an armed robbery. 
Police investigating the scene went to 
the room occupied by the three men and 
found a latent ﬁ ngerprint on an ashtray. 
The print was later matched to one of the 
suspects whose ﬁ ngerprints were on ﬁ le 
with the police department.

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 137
Chemical Development of Latent Fingerprints  
Although powders are used to develop latent ﬁ nger-
prints on many surfaces, they are not recommended for 
unpainted wood, paper, cardboard or other absorbent 
surfaces. Using powder on such surfaces will smudge any 
prints, destroying their value as evidence. For such sur-
faces, use a special chemical such as iodine, ninhydrin or 
silver nitrate.
Use gloves and a holding device to avoid contaminat-
ing the evidence by inadvertently adding your own ﬁ n-
gerprints. Th e chemicals can all be applied to the same 
specimen because each reacts diﬀ erently with various 
types of materials. However, if all are used, the order 
must be iodine ﬁ rst, then ninhydrin and ﬁ nally silver 
nitrate.
In the iodine method, iodine crystals are placed in a 
fuming cabinet or a specially prepared fuming gun. Th e 
crystals are heated and vaporized, producing a violet 
fume that is absorbed by the oil in the ﬁ ngerprints. Th e 
ﬁ ngerprint ridges appear yellow-brown and must be pho-
tographed immediately because they fade quickly. Fuming 
cabinets and guns can be made or purchased from police 
supply houses.
Th e ninhydrin method develops amino acids. Ninhydrin 
(highly ﬂ ammable) is available in spray cans or in a powder 
form from which a solution of the powder and acetone or 
ethyl alcohol is made. Th e evidence is then either sprayed 
prints on various surfaces and using diﬀ erent-colored 
powders to determine how well each adheres and how 
much color contrast it provides. Practice until you can rec-
ognize surfaces and select the appropriate powder.
When photographing developed latent prints, record 
the color of the powder used, the color of the surface and 
the location of the prints. Place your identiﬁ cation, date 
and case number on the back of the photograph and sub-
mit it to the crime laboratory. Th e laboratory will deter-
mine whether it is an identiﬁ able print and whether it 
matches a known suspect or other people whose prints 
were submitted for elimination.
Lifting Prints To lift ﬁ ngerprints, use a commercially 
prepared lifter that has both a black-and-white back-
ground and a wide transparent lift tape. Use black lifters 
for light powders and light lifters for black powders.
To lift prints on doorknobs or rounded surfaces, use 
transparent tape so you can see any spots where the tape 
is not sticking. Put the tape over the dusted print. Do not 
use too much pressure. Work out any bubbles that appear 
under the tape by applying extra pressure. When you have 
lifted the print, transfer it to a ﬁ ngerprint card.
Common errors in lifting prints include removing 
too much or too little powder from the ridges, allowing 
bubbles to develop under the tape and failing to make two 
lifts when a second lift would be better than the ﬁ rst.
A forensic investigator uses a ﬁ ne 
brush to apply ﬁ ngerprinting dust to 
a cup. The dust adheres to the oil of 
a ﬁ ngerprint, revealing a distinctive 
ridged pattern that can be used to 
identify the person who held the cup, 
thereby linking that person to this crime 
scene. (© Mauro Fermariello/Science Photo 
Library/Photo Researchers, Inc.)

138 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
or brushed with or dipped into the ninhydrin. Develop-
ment of prints can be speeded up by applying heat from 
a fan, pressing iron or oven. At room temperature, prints 
develop in a minimum of 2 hours; with a pressing iron, they 
develop almost immediately. Ninhydrin-developed prints 
do not fade immediately, but they eventually lose contrast. 
Th erefore, photograph them soon after development.
Th e silver nitrate method develops sodium chloride 
in the ﬁ ngerprint ridges into silver chloride that appears 
as a red-brown print. Because silver nitrate destroys oils 
and amino acids, it must be used after the iodine and nin-
hydrin methods. Immerse the specimen in a solution of 
3 to 10 percent silver nitrate and distilled water. Remove 
it immediately and hang it to dry. Th e prints can be 
developed more rapidly by applying light until they start 
to develop. Th ey should be photographed immediately 
because they disappear after several hours.
Other Methods of Lifting Prints Fingerprints may 
also be located and developed by using Magnabrush tech-
niques, laser technology, gelatin lifters and cyanoacrylate 
(superglue). Superglue fuming involves heating three 
or four drops of glue to generate fumes that adhere to 
 ﬁ ngerprints. Th e process can eﬀ ectively develop prints on 
plastic, bank checks, counterfeit money, metal and skin. 
Portable lasers are used to ﬁ nd and highlight ﬁ ngerprints. 
Th ey can detect ﬁ ngerprints on the skin of a murder  victim 
and trace a gunshot path.
Investigators can also use gelatin lifters to lift dusted 
prints or dust marks (footprints) from a wide variety of 
surfaces. Used in Europe for decades, the lifters are ﬂ ex-
ible and easily cut to suit speciﬁ c needs. Th ey can lift dust 
A detective demonstrates how to lift a print, in this case a handprint. Volcanic powder is brushed onto a surface to reveal a print (left), then a 
lifter, which is transparent adhesive tape, is placed over the print (right). The next step is to transfer the lifted print on the tape to a print card.

prints from any smooth surface—from tile ﬂ oors to card-
board boxes. Th e high contrast of the black lifters allows 
investigators to see dust prints not visible to the naked 
eye, and the lifted prints photograph extremely well. In 
addition, the lifters can pick up particle samples such as 
hair or paint chips. In the laboratory, tweezers or a scalpel 
can remove the samples from the lifter without damaging 
the sampled material.
Page (2007b, p.128) points out, “As most crime scene 
experts know; dusting for ﬁ ngerprints can sometimes 
destroy parts of the prints, erasing potentially valuable 
forensic clues.” In addition, conventional ﬁ ngerprinting 
methods may use liquids or vapors that might alter the 
prints. 
Elimination Prints If ﬁ ngerprint evidence is found, 
it is important to know whose prints “belong” at the 
scene. Prints of persons with reason to be at the scene 
are taken and used as elimination prints. For example, 
family members in a home where a crime has occurred or 
employees of a business that has been robbed should be 
ﬁ ngerprinted so that their ﬁ ngerprints at the scene can be 
eliminated from suspicion.
Inked Prints Most police departments have equipment 
for taking ﬁ ngerprints. Standard procedure is to ﬁ nger-
print all adults who have been arrested, either at the time 
of booking or at the time of release. Th ese ﬁ ngerprint 
records help ensure that the person arrested is identiﬁ ed 
correctly. Some departments have portable ﬁ ngerprint 
kits in patrol vehicles that allow them to take inked prints 
and develop latent prints at crime scenes.

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 139
the prints and transfers them onto a ﬁ ngerprint card. 
Several beneﬁ ts in moving to optical live-scan devices are 
that “Digital ﬁ ngerprints can be stored simply, retrieved 
accurately, and transmitted rapidly” (Oehler).
Stored ﬁ ngerprint information includes the person’s 
gender, date of birth and classiﬁ cation formula and each 
ﬁ nger’s ridge count. Th is automated ﬁ ngerprint iden-
tiﬁ cation system (AFIS) technology maps ﬁ ngerprints 
and creates a spatial geometry of the minutiae of the print, 
which is changed into a binary code for the computer’s 
searching algorithm. When queried, the system selects the 
cards within the range limitations for the entered classi-
ﬁ cation formula. Th e capability of registering thousands 
of details makes it possible for the computer to complete 
a search in minutes that would take days manually. Th e 
search success rate has been as high as 98 percent in some 
departments with ﬁ les under one million. Once the com-
puter search ﬁ nds a hit, a ﬁ ngerprint expert then visually 
compares the prints.
If no match is found in local or state ﬁ les, prints are 
submitted to the FBI Identiﬁ cation Division for a further 
search. Th is division has on ﬁ le ﬁ ngerprints of arrested 
people as well as of nearly 100 million other people such 
as aliens and individuals in government services, including 
the military. Given that approximately 35 to 40 percent 
of crime scenes have latent prints, AFIS is a tremendous 
advance in crime ﬁ ghting.
Th e value of AFIS technology was ﬁ rst seen when it 
was used to solve the “Night Stalker” serial killer case in 
1985. AFIS systems are constantly being augmented with 
the introduction of new services and features and recently 
went mobile, allowing investigators in the ﬁ eld to take a 
live scan of a person’s prints. Th e potential exists to adapt 
mobile AFIS systems to quickly identify ﬁ ngerprints at 
crime scenes. Th e units will need to be modiﬁ ed to accom-
modate the scanning of crime scene prints, but this pro-
cess could greatly reduce the important time frame of the 
ﬁ rst 24 hours after the commission of a crime, the period 
in which a suspect is most likely to be identiﬁ ed.
In 1999, the FBI introduced its automated ﬁ ngerprint 
identiﬁ cation system, which provides ﬁ ve major services 
to local, state and federal law enforcement and criminal 
justice agencies:
• • Ten-print–based identiﬁ cation services (i.e., ten 
rolled ﬁ ngerprint impressions and ten ﬂ at ﬁ ngerprint 
impressions)
• • Latent ﬁ ngerprint services
• • Subject search and criminal history services
• • Document and image services
• • Remote search services
To take inked prints, start by rolling the right thumb 
and ﬁ ngers in the order stated on the card. Th en roll the 
left thumb and ﬁ ngers in order. Use a complete roll; that 
is, go from one side to the other. Next, press the ﬁ ngers 
and then the thumb of each hand on the spaces provided 
on the card. Th e card also has spaces for information 
about the person and the classiﬁ cation made by the ﬁ n-
gerprint examiner. Learn to take inked ﬁ ngerprints by 
having someone demonstrate.
Digital Fingerprinting Advances in computer technol-
ogy are allowing digital ﬁ ngerprinting to replace inked 
printing: “Electronic live-scan capture of ﬁ ngerprints has 
eliminated many of the messy problems that irritated 
oﬃ  cers using ink on paper” (Oehler, 2007, p.123). Latent 
ﬁ ngerprints are scanned and converted into an electronic 
image or inkless ﬁ ngerprint that is stored in a database 
for rapid retrieval. In this method, a suspect’s hand is 
placed onto a glass platen, where a laser optically scans 
Technology Innovations
Researchers at the Los Alamos National Labora-
tory in New Mexico have developed a novel method 
of detecting ﬁ ngerprints using X-rays that don’t dis-
turb the print in any way (Page, 2007, pp.128–131):
The technique uses a process called microbeam 
X-ray ﬂ uorescence (MXRF), which rapidly reveals 
the elemental composition of a sample by irradiat-
ing it with a thin beam of X-rays without disturbing 
the sample.
So far the research is proof-of-concept only: to 
demonstrate the possibility of detecting ﬁ ngerprint 
patterns using MXRF, whereby the ﬁ ngerprint pat-
tern is determined by detecting inorganic elements 
present in the print residue.
“Thus, we both detect the print pattern digi-
tally and collect chemical information from the 
print as well,” Worley [Los Alamos chemist] says.
Fingerprints contain detectable quantities of 
salts, such as sodium chloride and potassium chlo-
ride, excreted in sweat. The Los Alamos researchers 
have shown they could detect the sodium, potas-
sium and chlorine from these salts. Since these salts 
are deposited along with the patterns present in a 
ﬁ ngerprint, an image of the ﬁ ngerprint can be visual-
ized producing an elemental image for analysis.

140 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Usefulness of Fingerprints Fingerprints are extremely 
valuable in criminal investigations.
Fingerprints are positive evidence of a person’s identity. 
They cannot, however, indicate a person’s age, sex 
or race.
Fingerprinting is increasingly being applied to home-
land security eﬀ orts because ﬁ ngerprints can be sent via 
communications systems across the country and around 
the globe and visually reproduced. Crime victims are iden-
tiﬁ ed by their prints to prove the corpus delicti. Courts, 
parole and probation oﬃ  cers and prosecutors use ﬁ nger-
prints to positively identify people with multiple criminal 
records.
Fingerprints also aid in noncriminal investigations 
by helping to identify victims of mass disasters, miss-
ing persons, amnesia victims, and unconscious persons. 
Military agencies use ﬁ ngerprints recorded at enlist-
ment to identify those killed in combat. Hospitals use 
ﬁ ngerprints or footprints to identify newborn babies. 
Furthermore, ﬁ ngerprints are becoming widely used as 
identiﬁ cation for cashing checks and processing legal 
documents.
One beneﬁ t of electronic ﬁ ngerprinting systems is 
their increased speed and accuracy. Another major ben-
eﬁ t of this technology is the ability to transmit the print 
image over telephone or cable lines from one AFIS system 
to another or to computerized criminal records centers. 
Th is feature also allows international sharing of databases 
to help capture criminals who move from one country to 
another. 
In September 2006, the FBI and the Department of 
Homeland Security merged their ﬁ ngerprint databases 
into what is called the Integrated Automated Finger-
print Identiﬁ cation System, known as IAFIS. Th e merger 
of databases containing millions of ﬁ ngerprints taken 
from convicted criminals and illegal immigrants marks an 
unprecedented interagency eﬀ ort to capture more terror-
ists and solve more crimes: “Th e system, which the FBI 
bills as the world’s largest biometric data base, allows law 
enforcement oﬃ  cials to search the ﬁ ngerprints and crimi-
nal history information of more than 47 million people” 
(Taylor, 2006). A ﬁ ngerprint entered into IAFIS led to Lee 
Boyd Malvo, one of the two suspects in the Washington, 
DC, area sniper case. Malvo had been previously arrested 
by the INS.
Despite the many beneﬁ ts provided by AFIS and 
IAFIS, these programs simply search the databases for 
possible matches. In the end, a human ﬁ ngerprint exam-
iner must determine the match. In addition: “Th e data 
base contains the ﬁ ngerprints of only a small percentage 
of the population. Moreover, to make a comparison, the 
latent print must be of suﬃ  cient quality to identify cer-
tain individual characteristics” (Bowen and Schneider, 
2007).
Fingerprint Patterns, Analysis and Identification  
Once a print has been captured, whether chemically devel-
oped, rolled in ink or digitally scanned, the ﬁ ngerprint 
patterns are analyzed for unique features that will, it is 
hoped, lead to identifying one individual. Fingerprint pat-
terns are classiﬁ ed as arched, looped or whorled. Variations 
of these conﬁ gurations result in the 9 basic ﬁ ngerprint 
patterns illustrated in Figure 5.6. Normally, 12 match-
able characteristics on a single ﬁ ngerprint are required for 
positive identiﬁ cation.
When using digital ﬁ ngerprint images, the image 
quality becomes critical. As with rolled (inked) prints, 
smudges and distortions reduce the print’s usefulness. 
Digital programs, if not up to standard, might also create 
artifacts or false minutiae in the image, which will impair 
an examiner’s ability to analyze and match a print. Mini-
mum standards have been established to ensure maxi-
mum usefulness of the prints they scan.
An automated ﬁ ngerprint identiﬁ cation system compares 
ﬁ ngerprints recovered at crime scenes to the millions of prints 
stored in its database. This technology enables large numbers 
of ﬁ ngerprints to be analyzed more rapidly and accurately than 
the traditional method of visual analysis conducted by a print 
technician. Here, the software identiﬁ es speciﬁ c minutiae (unique 
characteristic identiﬁ er) shared by the evidence (latent) print and a 
particular individual’s (suspect’s) print. (© Joel Gordon)

the side of the hand, from the wrist up to the curled ﬁ fth, 
or  “pinkie,” ﬁ nger, that rests on the table or paper when 
someone is writing. In one interesting case, a burglar shat-
tered a restaurant’s plate glass window. Th e police found 
no ﬁ ngerprints around the window but did ﬁ nd footprints 
and a toe print on a piece of the broken glass. Th ese were 
developed and lifted. Later, a 17 year old was arrested for 
vagrancy. Learning that he often went barefoot, police 
also took his footprints and forwarded them to the FBI. 
Th ey were identical to those on the plate glass window 
fragment. It was learned that the youth had taken oﬀ  his 
shoes and put his socks on his hands to avoid leaving ﬁ n-
gerprints at the crime scene. He was found guilty.
In another case, a string of peeping-tom cases was 
solved because of three lip impressions left by the suspect 
on a windowpane. And in a case in Illinois, authorities 
matched lip prints on a piece of duct tape the suspect had 
held in his mouth while binding a victim.
VOICEPRINTS
A voiceprint is a graphic record made by a sound spec-
trograph of the energy patterns emitted by speech. Like 
ﬁ ngerprints, no two voiceprints are alike. Voiceprints can 
assist in identifying bomb hoaxers, obscene phone callers 
and others who use the phone illegally: “Valuable evidence 
Admissibility in Court To ensure admissibility in court, 
investigators should establish the probative value of the 
print; that is, either the defendant had claimed never being 
at the scene, or even if the defendant had legitimate access 
to the scene, he or she did not have legitimate access to the 
object on which the print was found, or the print was found 
on the instrumentality of the crime. Investigators should 
also ensure admissibility by the testimony of the investi-
gator who lifted the latent print, by the level of expertise 
used by the ﬁ ngerprint examiner and by the testimony of 
the ﬁ le supervisor who maintained the print.
As with digital photography, digital ﬁ ngerprinting has 
faced authenticity and admissibility challenges in court. 
Despite attempts to create tracking software, such as 
MoreHits, to overcome such challenges, thus far no tool 
has been designed that will oﬀ er a secure chain of custody 
for digital prints.
Other Types of Prints Suspects may leave palmprints, 
footprints or even prints of lips. Th ese impressions can be 
photographed and developed just as ﬁ ngerprints are.
Palmprints contain many more friction-ridge land-
marks than ﬁ ngerprints have, thus giving print exam-
iners more points of comparison when determining 
matches. Biometric databases are also beginning to store 
prints from the part of the hand called the writer’s edge,

race or ethnicity or what part of the country (or world) 
the person grew up in or has spent recent time in. Lan-
guage analysis may also provide insight into a person’s 
educational level, political views and religious orientation, 
which may in turn provide further evidence regarding a 
criminal motive.
HUMAN DNA PROFILING
Human cells contain discrete packs of information known 
as chromosomes, which are made of DNA. DNA, or deoxy-
ribonucleic acid, is an organic substance contained in a 
cell’s nucleus. Th e DNA double-helix strand is composed of 
building blocks called nucleotides, which consist of a base 
molecule connected to a molecule of sugar and a molecule 
of phosphoric acid. Th e four bases are adenine (A), gua-
nine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T), which link to each 
other to form a chain millions of nucleotides long. Within 
this DNA chain are areas of conserved regions, where the 
A-T-C-G pattern is the same for every human, and vari-
able regions, where the nucleotide sequence is distinct and 
diﬀ erent for every person, thereby determining a person’s 
individual characteristics. Th is unique genetic code can be 
used to create a genetic ﬁ ngerprint to positively iden-
tify a person. Except for identical twins, no two individu-
als have the same DNA structure.
DNA proﬁ ling uses material from which chromosomes 
are made to identify individuals positively.
DNA can tell investigators the sample donor’s gender, 
race, eye color and hair color. DNA proﬁ ling can be done 
on cells from almost any part of the body. 
Table 5.2 lists possible items of crime scene evidence 
on which DNA might be located. DNA technology is used 
in paternity testing, immigration disputes, missing per-
sons and unidentiﬁ ed-body cases and criminal and assail-
ant identiﬁ cation. DNA analysis was used to identify many 
of the World Trade Center victims killed on September 11, 
2001. DNA keeps its integrity in dried specimens for long 
periods and consequently can help resolve unsolved cases.
In the past, DNA evidence was usually collected only in 
violent crimes. In fact, the FBI laboratory does not accept 
cases involving property crimes such as theft, fraud, bur-
glary and automobile theft unless the cases involve more 
than $100,000. Part of the reason is that an average DNA 
case costs approximately $2,000 in forensic science, ana-
lytical time and supplies. However: “Once relegated to 
major crime scenes, where investigators gathered bio-
logical evidence from blood, semen and hairs, authori-
ties are now unearthing the utility of applying CSI-style 
analysis techniques to high-volume serial crimes, such 
often rests on an answering machine recording, cell phone 
message, 911 call tapes, etc. Most state crime laboratories 
and many private companies now perform audio forensic 
investigation” (Hanson, 2007b, p.134). However: “As with 
all crime scene evidence, strict chain-of-custody rules and 
procedures must be adhered to. When a piece of audio 
evidence is found, it should be immediately placed in an 
evidence bag or appropriate container and shipped to the 
audio lab” (Hanson, p.137).
A voiceprint made during a phone call can be retained 
until a suspect is in custody. Th en a sample of a suspect’s 
voice can be taken and compared to the voiceprint evi-
dence: “Spectrographic examinations compare an unknown 
recorded voice sample with a known verbatim voice exemplar 
produced on a similar transmission-and-recording device 
such as the telephone. Decisions regarding spectrographic 
voice comparisons are not conclusive. Th e results are for 
investigative guidance only” (Waggoner, 2007, pp.18–19).
As with many other investigative techniques, advances 
in forensic audio analysis are giving investigators higher-
quality data despite eﬀ orts of those being surveilled 
to distort their voices or conceal them with high levels 
of background noise. Use of adaptive digital ﬁ lters can 
remove background noise and enhance speech and data 
from tapes. Th is technology can also analyze sounds other 
than voices, thus converting annoying background noise 
into isolated, distinguishable sounds that give clues about 
where the calls are originating.
 Th e use of voiceprints in criminal trials is controver-
sial. In a number of cases, convictions obtained through 
voiceprints have been reversed because the voiceprints 
were not regarded as suﬃ  ciently reliable. 
LANGUAGE ANALYSIS
A useful and often overlooked type of evidence is the 
actual language used by victims, witnesses and suspects. 
“Excited utterances” made by persons at a crime scene 
can, upon analysis, reveal the speaker’s state-of-mind and 
may be admitted into testimony even if the person does 
not testify (Ivy and Orput, 2006, p.7). To qualify for this 
exception to the hearsay rule, the victim or witness must 
have seen an exciting or startling event and made the 
statement while still under the stress of the event. Th is is 
similar to res gestae statements discussed in Chapter 1. To 
capture this type of evidence, many oﬃ  cers and investi-
gators carry lightweight digital voice recorders with date- 
and time-stamp features.
One area of language analysis involves psycholin-
guistics, the study of the mental processes involved in 
comprehending, producing and acquiring language. 
An individual’s communication, whether written or 
spoken, may provide clues about his or her gender, age,

evidence. Laska (2007, p.40) points out, “DNA is a tool 
available to every oﬃ  cer. Collection is simple to conduct. 
Th e supplies are inexpensive. Processing time in the ﬁ eld 
is minimal. Standards are easily obtained. By recogniz-
ing contamination issues and the needs and status of the 
lab, a patrol oﬃ  cer can ensure samples are used to their 
highest potential.” An example of the ease of collection is 
seen where a suspect agrees to provide a DNA sample and 
the oﬃ  cer performs a simple buccal swab of the suspect’s 
mouth to obtain a saliva sample (Longa, 2008). Sterile, 
cotton-tipped applicator swabs, which are inexpensive, 
easily obtained and easy to carry and store, are used to col-
lect four DNA samples by rubbing the inside surfaces of 
the cheeks thoroughly and then air-drying the swabs and 
placing them back into the original paper packaging or an 
envelope with sealed corners. Plastic containers should not 
be used, as they can retain moisture that may damage the 
integrity of the DNA sample (Waggoner, 2007, pp.96–97).
Th e National Institute of Justice (NIJ) oﬀ ers guidelines 
to help investigators avoid contaminating DNA evidence:
• • Use disposable instruments or clean them thoroughly 
before and after handling each sample.
• • Avoid talking, sneezing and coughing over evidence.
• • Air-dry evidence thoroughly before packaging.
• • Put evidence into new paper bags or envelopes, not 
into plastic bags, and never use staples.
Suggestions for collecting and preserving DNA evi-
dence are oﬀ ered by Lifecodes Corporation in Table 5.3.
An innovative two-day course called “DNA from Crime 
Scene to Courtroom” is oﬀ ered by the NIJ’s National 
as burglaries, robberies, and acts of vandalism” (Garrett, 
2006b, pp.122–123). Statistics from the United King-
dom show that every DNA conviction obtained prevents 
as many as eight future crimes: “If the U.K. statistics are 
accurate, and you can prevent crimes by solving one crime, 
then the $400 burglary, which cost us $2,000 to solve, is 
priceless” (Garrett, p.124).
Th ree National Institute of Justice (NIJ) pilot projects 
demonstrate that analyzing DNA from property crimes can be 
extraordinarily useful and can have major public safety ben-
eﬁ ts: “Th e beneﬁ ts stem from the recognition that property 
oﬀ enders—burglars in particular—pose a signiﬁ cant threat 
not just to those whose property they steal, but to the com-
munity” (Zedlewski and Murphy, 2006, p.3). Th e NIJ reports,
• • Burglary has the lowest clearance rate of any Index 
crime.
• • Individuals who commit property crimes have a higher 
recidivism rate than do those who perpetrate other 
crimes.
• • Burglary can be a “gateway” crime that leads to more seri-
ous, violent crimes in the future (Garrett, 2006a, p.8).
Timoney (2007, p.2) urges law enforcement to use 
DNA’s full potential, stating, “DNA testing can now pro-
vide conclusive evidence in high-volume crimes like bur-
glaries and car break-ins.”
Collecting and Preserving DNA Evidence Consider-
ing the potential value of DNA evidence in a criminal case, 
investigators must understand and be trained in proper 
collection and preservation procedures for this type of

TABLE 5.3 | Collecting Evidence for DNA Analysis
Types of Evidence and Minimal Amounts to Collect
Blood
Fresh liquid blood: 3 drops
Stains: Quarter size
Drawn specimens (exemplars): 1 cc or 1 mL
Semen
Fresh liquid semen: 3 drops
Stains: Dime size
Swabs: 2 swabs
Other types
Tissues/Bones/Teeth: Although small amounts of evidence have provided enough DNA for analysis, the amount that will be needed 
is unpredictable and depends on many factors, including age and concentration of sample.
How to Collect Biological Evidence
Specimens should be collected and dried as soon as possible to avoid bacterial contamination.
Wet specimens
Quick-dry using a hair dryer on the cool setting.
For large amounts of material, use a large ﬂ oor fan.
Absorb wet specimen onto sterile gauze, 100% cotton, or Q-Tips and then dry.
Dry specimens
Scrape dried specimen from permanent surfaces.
Cut dried specimen out from large areas.
Package whole items if manageable.
Packaging Specimens
Drying specimens isn’t enough. They must be kept as free from moisture as possible. Therefore
Small items
Place the collected specimen in a zip-lock bag.
Squeeze the air out of the bag.
Larger items
Use paper bags for large items and tape them closed.
Storing Collected Evidence
Heat can destroy DNA. Therefore, if the evidence is not sent for DNA analysis within a few days, store the packaged evidence as directed.
Short-term storage (less than 30 days)
Store in freezer.
If freezer is not available, refrigerate evidence.
Store at room temperature for only 1–2 days.
Extended storage (more than 30 days)
Call Lifecodes for recommendations. When it has been collected and stored properly, evidence as old as 10 years has been 
successfully analyzed.
Sending Evidence for DNA Analysis
Send evidence and exemplar samples, from the victim and suspect(s), properly labeled, together with a written description of the 
specimens. Include any other important or relevant facts concerning the case and origin of the sample(s) for the forensic scientist. 
Send samples via an overnight carrier. The sender is responsible for following the chain of custody.

creates a genetic uniqueness for every person that DNA 
analysts are able to proﬁ le.
Before PCR, the dominant technique for DNA analy-
sis was restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP, 
pronounced riﬀ -lip). Although many labs still use this 
method, a signiﬁ cant shortcoming is that it requires a 
large amount of intact DNA, whereas PCR needs only a 
tiny amount of DNA, even if degraded.
Another extremely useful forensic DNA analysis 
method examines a genetic marker called a single nucle-
otide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced snip) (Figure 5.7). A 
SNP is a one-base diﬀ erence in the DNA sequence between 
individuals. Advancements continue to be made in DNA 
testing. Th e National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy has developed a quality assurance standards kit for 
DNA typing that laboratories can use to assess the accuracy 
of their DNA testing procedures within a narrow margin 
of error.
Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center 
(NLECTC)–Rocky Mountain, in Denver, Colorado. Th e 
course teaches investigators, crime scene personnel and 
prosecutors about the powers and pitfalls of DNA evi-
dence. Students are walked through a mock crime scene to 
learn where to search for DNA evidence and how to collect 
and preserve it. Th en they are shown how a forensic scien-
tist analyzes the sample. 
In some cases, DNA analysis has been rendered worth-
less by the defense’s successful attack on the methods used 
to collect and store the evidence on which DNA analysis 
was performed. For example, in the O. J. Simpson double-
murder trial, DNA matches were disregarded by jurors 
after questions were raised about how blood samples were 
collected, preserved and examined.
DNA Testing Because of the expense and time involved, 
three criteria must usually be met for a lab to accept DNA 
samples:
• • Suﬃ  cient material must be submitted.
• • Samples (exemplars) must be submitted from both 
the suspect and the victim.
• • Th e evidence must be probative.
Th e FBI’s Handbook of Forensic Services (Waggoner, 2007, 
p.34) explains the types of DNA used in DNA analysis: 
Th ere are two types of DNA used in forensic analyses. 
Nuclear DNA (nDNA) is the more discriminating of the 
two types and is typically analyzed in evidence contain-
ing blood, semen, saliva, body tissues, and hairs that 
have tissue at their root ends. Th e power of nDNA test-
ing done by the DNA Analysis Unit lies in its ability to 
potentially identify an individual as being the source of 
the DNA obtained from an evidence item in a reason-
able degree of scientiﬁ c certainty, as well as the deﬁ ni-
tive power of exclusion.
 
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is typically analyzed 
in evidence containing naturally shed hairs, hair frag-
ments, bones, and teeth. Typically, these items contain 
low concentrations of degraded DNA, making them 
unsuitable for nDNA examinations. Th e high sensitivity 
of mtDNA analysis allows scientists to obtain informa-
tion from old items of evidence associated with cold 
cases, samples from mass disasters, and small pieces of 
evidence containing little biological material. 
Diﬀ erent methods of DNA analysis are available, but 
most crime labs’ typing systems use the polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), duplicating short segments of DNA. Th e 
short pieces of DNA that PCR targets are areas where the 
genetic code repeats, called short tandem repeats (STRs). 
Each human chromosome contains hundreds of diﬀ erent 
types of STRs, with the number of repeats on each chro-
mosome varying greatly among individuals. Th is variation 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique known as the 
short tandem repeat (STR) DNA method. STRs are genetic markers 
that vary in size among individuals and are very discriminating for 
single-source samples, meaning they can be used to determine 
with 99.999% certainty that a speciﬁ c DNA sample came from a 
particular individual. (© Joel Gordon)

however, are sometimes criticized as extensions of racial 
proﬁ ling. Fink (2006, p.54) observes, “Questions about 
the forensic infallibility of DNA emerge even as police 
begin to proﬁ le suspects by race.” She also notes, however, 
the DNA evidence has scientiﬁ cally rigorous probabilities, 
with the chances far less than 1 in 10 billion for a full DNA 
proﬁ le from a single individual matching that of another 
individual.

investigators to include or exclude certain people from an 
investigation based on their ancestry. Th ese types of tools,

Prime and Newman (2007, p.34) note, “One of the dif-
ﬁ culties associated with DNA analysis is that if a sample 
contains DNA from more than one individual (known as 
a mixed proﬁ le), the proﬁ les cannot be easily separated, 
reducing the overall success of the testing.” They give as 
a common example a mixed proﬁ le obtained in a sexual 
offense in which semen is recovered from a woman’s 
body. A new technique called Y-STR analysis is being 
used in such cases (Prime and Newman):
The Y chromosome is a male-speciﬁ c identiﬁ er, and 
typing techniques are now available that develop pro-
ﬁ les speciﬁ c to the male contributor of the DNA. The 
advantage of this test is in its high level of sensitivity, 
the test is able to generate a proﬁ le of a male perpetra-
tor in the presence of DNA from a female contributor.
A limitation of Y-STR analysis is that the DNA 
proﬁ le obtained will be identical for all males 
within the same paternal lineage (i.e., the father’s 
proﬁ le will be the same as that of his son, whose 
proﬁ le will also match that of his grandfather on 
his father’s side, and so on).

DNA Witness is a test procedure that provides 
information on the ancestry of a person from his or 
her DNA sample (Hanson, 2007a, p.98): 
In this test, hundreds of different regions of a DNA 
sample are looked at where changes are more 
commonly associated with one race than another. 
By repeating this process for various ancestry com-
binations, a picture of the potential ancestry of the 
person is built up. At present, the DNA Witness test 
procedure can break down ancestry into the follow-
ing groups: Europe (Caucasian), African, East Asian, 
and Native American. Additional analysis allows the 
European group to be further divided into Northwest-
ern, Southeastern, and Middle European groups.
The DNA Witness has been employed in a 
variety of criminal investigations and in identifying 
remains found in cold cases.

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 147
CODIS must be subsequently validated as a match by a 
qualiﬁ ed DNA analyst.
By year end 2007, the NDIS forensic index contained 
203,401 proﬁ les, and the convicted oﬀ ender index contained 
5,372,773 proﬁ les (“CODIS,” 2008). However, many more 
proﬁ les could, and should, be added to CODIS if the enor-
mous backlog of untested DNA evidence were addressed. 
Backlog of DNA Awaiting Testing McGhee (2008) 
observes, “Th roughout the country, DNA tests that could 
pave the way to jailing violent predators are routinely 
delayed, sometimes for years, because of staﬃ  ng and 
funding constraints of crime labs and increasing numbers 
of convicts being tested.” According to the National Insti-
tute of Justice Web site,  approximately 450,000 oﬀ ender 
samples remain stored in individual state forensic labo-
ratories and have not yet been entered into CODIS, and 
another roughly 500,000 oﬀ ender samples still need to be 
collected and analyzed (“Recommendation of the National 
Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence,” 2007). 
Outsourcing DNA analysis to private laboratories is one 
alternative but presents a “Catch-22”: “It has reduced the 
testing backlogs, but created CODIS entry backlogs. Even 
if the private laboratory is accredited, no private labora-
tory in this country has direct access to CODIS, creating 
redundancy” (Heinecke, 2007b, p.85).
Admissibility in Court Spagnoli (2007, p.42) asserts, 
“Today a DNA match is virtually undisputable in court. 
DNA can identify a criminal with near absolute certainty 
or exonerate innocent suspects.” Ivy and Orput (2007, 
DNA Databases In October 1998, under the authority 
of the DNA Identiﬁ cation Act of 1994, the FBI activated a 
database called the National DNA Index System (NDIS) in 
an eﬀ ort to establish a national DNA index for law enforce-
ment purposes. In 1990, the FBI Laboratory launched 
a pilot project called the Combined DNA Index System 
(CODIS), which blended forensic science and computer 
technology to help solve violent crimes. CODIS created a 
distributed database with three hierarchical tiers—local, 
state and national—enabling participating laboratories to 
exchange and compare DNA proﬁ les electronically. DNA 
proﬁ les are generated at the local level (LDIS) and then 
ﬂ ow to the state (SDIS) and national (NDIS) levels. NDIS 
is at the top of the CODIS hierarchy. When CODIS was 
ﬁ rst implemented, it served 14 state and local laborato-
ries. Since its inception, more than 4.2 million forensic 
and convicted oﬀ ender proﬁ les have been entered into 
CODIS: “Th rough January 2007, according to the FBI’s 
CODIS Web site, there were 44,567 cases in 49 states and 
two federal laboratories where CODIS added value to the 
investigative process” (Spagnoli, 2007, pp.42–43).
Th e CODIS database is organized into two indexes: 
the forensic and oﬀ ender indexes. Th e forensic index con-
tains DNA proﬁ les from crime scene evidence where the 
oﬀ ender’s identity is unknown. Th e oﬀ ender index contains 
DNA proﬁ les of individuals convicted of sex oﬀ enses and 
other violent crimes. Investigators can submit biological 
evidence from a crime scene to CODIS and cross-check it 
against existing proﬁ les, generating investigative leads 
and making links between crimes and oﬀ enders. As with 
IAFIS and ﬁ ngerprint searches, all DNA hits identiﬁ ed by 
Preeminent forensic scientist, Henry 
C. Lee, examines a DNA proﬁ le. Such 
proﬁ les are entered into state and 
national databases to help solve a 
variety of crimes. (© AP/Wide World Photos)

148 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
“States are dramatically expanding controversial DNA sam-
pling beyond convicted felons to include tens of thousands 
of suspects arrested for felony oﬀ enses before they are tried” 
(Johnson, 2008). Most of the new laws require destroying 
samples if suspects are acquitted or charges are dropped.
A congressional directive likely to become law will 
require the collection of DNA from arrestees as well as 
samples from people other than U.S. citizens and legal per-
manent residents who are detained by U.S. authorities, in 
an eﬀ ort to help catch a range of domestic criminals. Th is 
strategy, however, goes well beyond the FBI’s initial aim 
of storing information on perpetrators of violent crimes 
(Nakashima and Hall, 2008, p.A01). An American Civil Lib-
erties Union representative states, “Innocent people don’t 
belong in a so-called criminal database. We’re crossing a 
line” (Nakashima and Hall). Immigration rights advocates 
point out that most illegal immigrants are detained for 
administrative violations, not federal crimes, but adding 
their DNA to the database suggests they are criminals.
BLOOD AND OTHER BODY FLUIDS
Blood is frequently analyzed for DNA, but it and other 
body ﬂ uids such as semen and urine can also provide other 
valuable evidence to investigators. Blood assists in estab-
lishing that a violent crime was committed, in re-creating 
the movements of a suspect or victim and in eliminat-
ing suspects. Body ﬂ uids can be found on a suspect’s or 
 victim’s clothing, on the ﬂ oor or walls, on furniture and on 
other objects. Some body ﬂ uids, such as semen and saliva, 
may be diﬃ  cult to detect but, given their natural ﬂ uores-
cent property, will become visible under a variety of FLSs.
Blood is important as evidence in crimes of violence. 
Heelprints of shoes in blood splashes may be identiﬁ -
able apart from the blood analysis. It is important to test 
the stain or sample to determine whether it is, in fact, 
human blood. In addition, because blood is so highly vis-
ible and recognizable, those who commit violent crimes 
usually attempt to remove blood from items. A number of 
reagents—including luminol, tetramethyl benzedrine and 
phenolphthalein—can identify blood at a crime scene, and 
because crime laboratories are swamped with evidence to 
examine, such preliminary on-scene testing is important.
Luminol, for example, is an easy-to-apply water-based 
solution sprayed from a pump bottle over an area where 
blood traces are suspected. Luminol causes blood to ﬂ uo-
resce a pale blue color and can detect blood that has been 
diluted as much as 10,000 times. Another beneﬁ t to using 
luminol is that it does not harm DNA in blood, thus allow-
ing the blood to be collected for further analysis. How-
ever, luminol can give false positive reactions and is only 
a presumptive positive test for blood. Luminol also reacts 
with bleach products and some metals or strong oxidizing 
p.30), likewise, note, “Be it chromosomal DNA evidence 
from a cell’s nucleus (PCR-STR DNA) or chromosomal evi-
dence taken from a cell’s cytoplasm outside the nucleus 
(mitochondrial DNA), DNA evidence has tremendous 
potential value for proving crimes beyond a reasonable 
doubt at trial.”
According to Prime and Newman (2007, p.35), “Th rough 
partnerships between police and scientists, DNA analysis 
will continue to be regarded as the standard of excellence for 
the development of impartial, unbiased scientiﬁ c evidence 
in the support of the justice system.” However, the poten-
tial for human error and contamination is a critical factor in 
determining DNA evidence’s admissibility in court.
Exoneration of Incarcerated Individuals Moore 
(2007) states, “State lawmakers across the country are 
adopting broad changes in criminal justice procedures as 
a response to the exoneration of more than 200 convicts 
through the use of DNA evidence. . . . Nationwide, mis-
identiﬁ cation by witnesses led to wrongful convictions in 
75 percent of the 207 instances in which prisoners have 
been exonerated over the last decade, according to the 
Innocence Project, a group in New York that investigates 
wrongful convictions.”
In the ﬁ rst appeal from a ﬁ nding of guilty, the Virginia 
State Supreme Court upheld the conviction and death sen-
tence of Timothy Spencer in the rape and murder of two 
women, holding that DNA test results were reliable. A man 
who served more than two decades in prison for the rape 
and murder of two children had his convictions thrown 
out after an advanced DNA test showed that a neighbor 
may have been responsible for the crimes (Gold, 2007).
Moral and Ethical Issues Prime and Newman (2007, 
p.34) note, “Some of the challenges for the future will test 
the balance between the needs of the law enforcement com-
munity and the public’s interest in preserving its own civil 
liberties. Techniques are currently under development that 
will enable the prediction of some physical traits through 
DNA analysis, providing police with a potential genetic 
‘eyewitness.’ In addition, databanks are being used to iden-
tify perpetrators through kinship relationships to relatives 
whose proﬁ les may already be included in a DNA databank; 
this use of the technology is raising moral and ethical ques-
tions about such applications.” For example, when police in 
Wichita, Kansas, were unable to obtain a DNA sample from 
Denis Rader to conﬁ rm he was the murderer known as BTK 
(Bind, Torture, Kill), they used instead Rader’s daughter’s 
DNA—left at a hospital after a doctor appointment—to 
make a familial match (Shapiro, 2007).
Another controversial development in the use of DNA 
evidence is the sampling of people not yet convicted of a 
crime but who have been arrested and are awaiting trial: 

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 149
Blood-spatter patterns can help to determine a sus-
pect’s truthfulness. In many cases, suspects have claimed 
a death was accidental, but the location and angle of 
blood-spatter patterns refuted their statements.
Collect liquid blood with an eyedropper and put it in 
a test tube. Write the subject’s name and other pertinent 
information on medical tape applied to the outside. Send 
by air express, priority mail or registered mail. Scrape dry 
blood ﬂ akes into a pillbox or envelope, identiﬁ ed in the 
same way. Mark bloodstained clothing with a string tag or 
directly on the clothing. If the bloodstain is moist, air-dry 
the clothing before packing.
Blood can be identiﬁ ed as animal or human and is most 
useful in eliminating suspects. Age or race cannot be 
determined from blood samples, but DNA analysis can 
provide positive identiﬁ cation.
agents. Consequently, if a surface was cleaned with bleach, 
it might react when sprayed with luminol.
Bloodstains and spatter patterns are also useful evi-
dence because they are characteristics of certain physical 
forces and can help investigators determine how a criminal 
event played out. With a suﬃ  cient quantity of bloodstain 
evidence at a crime scene, investigators can determine 
the location of people or objects within a crime scene; the 
movement of people or objects within the scene; areas of 
origin of bloodshed; type(s) of weapon(s) used and force 
levels involved; the minimum number of blows, shots or 
events; and whether the suspect may have been injured 
(Frier, 2006,  p.52). 
Some blood evidence is easier to interpret than others: 
“Bloodstain pattern analysis can range from the simple to 
the complex. Th e trails of blood in a crime scene or cast-
oﬀ  blood patterns are reasonably straightforward and 
understandable. Determining areas of convergence and 
origin employing string methods or trigonometric meth-
odologies are more complex and call for a trained special-
ist” (Geberth, 2007, p.38). As a general rule, the greater 
the amount of force applied to the source, the smaller the 
drops will be. Th at is, as the force increases, the drop size or 
diameter decreases (Frier, 2006, p.53). Th ese force levels 
are broken into three categories. Th e ﬁ rst level, low veloc-
ity, consists of drops of blood. Th e second level, medium 
velocity spatter, produces bloodstains 4 mm to 6 mm in 
diameter or larger. Th e third level, high velocity, produces 
a mist or spray-type pattern. Investigators or technicians 
must accurately measure, record and photograph blood 
spatters at a crime scene so that expert bloodstain ana-
lysts can properly interpret the spatter data.
Bloodstain pattern software has been a mainstay of 
criminal forensic analysis since 1989 (Kanable, 2006, 
p.40). Computer programs make bloodstain analysis 
faster, easier and more accurate. Some programs can cal-
culate bloodstain measurements for point of origin, let-
ting investigators know, for example, where a gunshot 
victim stood. Computer software is also available that 
takes bloodstain pattern data and converts them into a 
3-D model of the crime scene, helping investigators recon-
struct speciﬁ c spatial and sequential events that occurred 
before and during the act of bloodshed. Th e numerous 
beneﬁ ts of using computer software such as Backtrack 
include these:
• • Th e results are obtained by using procedures based on 
solid science.
• • Using a computer saves time.
• • Th e computer produces virtual strings that do not sag 
and are mathematically positioned correctly.
• • Th e software makes use of the latest digital imaging 
techniques (Kanable, 2006).
Investigators use luminol to look for the possible presence of blood 
at a crime scene. Even if blood has been cleaned up, enough can 
remain that when the chemicals in luminol come into contact with the 
hemoglobin in the blood traces, a light-producing chemical reaction 
takes place. Investigators using luminol will try to make the crime scene 
as dark as possible so that the glow of the reaction can illuminate 
patterns, footprints, or possibly traces of blood in unsuspected 
places. This crime-scene investigator is wearing specialized gear 
recommended for when luminol is used. (© Spencer Grant/PhotoEdit)

HAIRS AND FIBERS
Hairs and ﬁ bers are often diﬃ  cult to locate without a care-
ful search and strong lighting. FLSs are commonly used to 
locate hair and ﬁ ber evidence in carpets and bedding or on 
other surfaces. Th ey are valuable evidence because they can 
place a suspect at a crime scene, especially in violent crimes 
in which interchange of hairs and ﬁ bers is likely to occur. 
Th e suspect can also take hairs and ﬁ bers from the scene.
Place hairs and ﬁ bers found at the crime scene in 
paper, using a druggist fold, or in a small box. Seal all 
edges and openings, and identify on the outside. If hairs 
and ﬁ bers are found on an object small enough to send to 
a laboratory, leave them on the object. Hairs and ﬁ bers 
often adhere to blood, ﬂ esh or other materials. If the hairs 
are visible but are not adhering ﬁ rmly to the object, record 
their location in your notes. Th en place them in a pillbox 
or glass vial to send to a laboratory. Do not use plastic.
If you suspect that hairs are on an object, carefully 
wrap the object and send it intact to a laboratory. Attempt 
to obtain 25 to 50 full hairs from the appropriate part 
of the suspect’s body for comparison, using a forceps or 
comb. Document the hair and ﬁ ber evidence using special 
ﬁ lters, light sources and photomicrographs to reproduce 
the specimens in black-and-white or color.
Examining Hair A hair shaft has a cuticle on the out-
side consisting of overlapping scales that always point 
toward the tip, a cortex consisting of elongated cells, and 
the medulla—the center of the hair—consisting of vari-
ably shaped cells. Variations in these structures make 
comparisons and identiﬁ cations possible.
In some cases, blood, without DNA analysis having 
been performed on it, can help to infer race; for example, 
sickle-shaped red blood cells occur primarily in African 
Americans.
SCENT
A type of evidence that does not receive much attention 
is scent evidence. Every person has a unique scent, which 
cannot be masked or eliminated, not even by the most 
potent perfume. A person’s scent proﬁ le is the combina-
tion of sweat, oils and gases his or her body produces. 
Th ese smells, along with the skin cells every body con-
stantly sheds, are detectable to specially trained scent-
discriminating dogs. Scents can also be categorized as 
primary and secondary. For example, in a child abduction 
case, a dog was given a shirt of the missing girl as the scent 
article and tracked this primary scent to the location of 
her body in a ﬁ eld. At this point, the investigators held oﬀ  
going to her body right away to allow the dog to refocus on 
the secondary scent of the abductor. However, if oﬃ  cers, 
search volunteers, parents or any other person comes in 
contact with the victim, the scene becomes scent contami-
nated and a valuable opportunity to track the perpetra-
tor’s secondary scent is lost.
Scent evidence can also be collected by placing a ster-
ile gauze pad on another item of evidence. A Scent Trans-
fer Unit uses a vacuum system to trap the scent on the 
gauze. If no scent article is available, the unit can be put 
in a closed room to vacuum the air for 5 minutes to try to 
capture a scent. Th ese scent pads can be presented to a 
tracking dog or placed in a freezer for preservation.
Blood pattern analysis can help 
investigators determine where the blood 
originated, the distance from there to 
where the blood came to rest, the type 
and direction of impact creating the 
bloodstains, the type of object producing 
them, and the position of the victim 
and the assailant during and after the 
bloodshed. Generally, the smaller the 
size of the blood spatters, the greater 
the energy used to create them. This 
blood spatter was the result of a beating 
and is an example of a medium-velocity 
event. The various measurements made 
by the investigators show the technique 
of examining the pattern to determine 
the area of convergence before 
calculating the area of origin.

chemicals as identiﬁ ers. Chemicals in hair conditioning 
products produce distinct chemical signatures, allow-
ing the identiﬁ cation of hair samples. Although chemical 
colorants and other products commonly applied to hair 
can thwart microscopic analysis, SIMS is not aﬀ ected by 
such substances and can capitalize on their presence to 
improve identiﬁ cation.
Examining Fibers Fibers fall into four general groups: 
mineral, vegetable, animal and synthetic. Mineral ﬁ bers 
most frequently submitted are glass and asbestos. Vege-
table ﬁ bers include cotton, jute, manila, kapok, hemp and 
many others. Animal ﬁ bers are primarily wool and silk. 
Synthetics include rayons, polyesters, nylons and others. 
Each ﬁ ber has individual characteristics that can be ana-
lyzed chemically.
Fibers are actually more distinguishable than hairs 
are. Fiber examination can determine a ﬁ ber’s thickness, 
the number of ﬁ bers per strand and other characteristics 
that help identify clothing. Fibers can be tested for origin 
and color. Although often overlooked, ﬁ bers are the most 
Microscopic examination determines whether hair is 
animal or human. Many characteristics can be deter-
mined from human hair: the part of the body it came from; 
whether it was bleached or dyed, freshly cut, pulled out 
or burned; and whether there is blood or semen on it. 
Race, sex and age cannot be determined.
As with blood samples, it is extremely diﬃ  cult to state 
that a hair came from a certain person, but it can usually be 
determined that a hair did not come from a certain person. 
Hair evidence is important because it does not deteriorate 
and is commonly left at a crime scene without a subject’s 
knowledge. Laboratory examination does not destroy hair 
evidence as it does many other types of evidence. Hair 
evidence may be subjected to microscopic examination to 
determine type (e.g., facial or pubic), to biological exami-
nation to determine blood-type group and to toxicological 
examination to determine the presence of drugs or poi-
sons. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) chemi-
cals can distinguish trace hair samples using consumer 
A laboratory technician recovers samples from a bloodstained pillow found at a crime scene. These samples can be used for DNA testing 
against blood drawn from a suspect. Good conservation of samples is the only condition required for DNA tests to be reliable, even after a

LeMay (2006, p.42) notes, “Dust impressions can be 
made when a person with dust on their shoes walks on a 
surface, thereby transferring the dust from their shoes to 
the surface they step on. Dust impressions also can be cre-
ated when a person walks across a dusty surface and that 
dust transfers from the surface onto the person’s shoes, 
resulting in a negative impression. Bowen and Schneider 
recommend “SoleMate,” a commercial database contain-
ing information—manufacturer, date of market release, 
an image or oﬀ set print of the sole and pictorial images of 
the uppers—for more than 12,000 sport, work and casual 
shoes. SoleMate is sold on DVD and updated and distrib-
uted to subscribers every 3 months.
If shoe or tire prints are found on paper or cardboard, 
photograph them and then submit the originals for labo-
ratory examination. Use latent ﬁ ngerprint lifters to lift 
shoe and tire tread impressions from smooth surfaces. 
Photograph with and without a marker before lifting the 
impression. Do not attempt to ﬁ t your shoe into the sus-
pect’s shoe print to determine size. Th is can destroy the 
shoe print. Regarding two-dimensional tire prints, unless 
the actual impression occurs on material small enough to 
be submitted to the lab, the only way to collect the evi-
dence is to photograph the length of the impression with 
a long scale adjacent to it.
Shoe and tire impressions generally have unique 
wear patterns that should be cast when possible. Th ree-
dimensional impressions should always be cast.
After photographing, cast shoe or tire tread impressions 
found in dirt, sand or snow.
To cast is to make an impression. Th e word also 
refers to the impression that results. Some departments 
use plaster, whereas others prefer dental casting mate-
rial because of its strength and durability and because it 
needs no reinforcement. Premeasured mix kits are also 
available. Th e steps in making a plaster cast of an impres-
sion are these:
 1. Build a retaining frame around the impression about 
2 inches from its edges.
 2. Coat the impression with ﬁ ve or six layers of alcohol 
and shellac or inexpensive hairspray, allowing each 
coat to dry before applying the next. Apply talcum 
powder to the last layer so the spray can easily be 
removed from the cast.
 3. Rapidly mix the plaster following directions on the 
box.
 4. Pour the plaster into the impression, using a spatula 
to cushion its fall and guide it into all areas of the 
impression. Fill the impression halfway.
frequently located microscopic evidence. Th ey are often 
found in assaults, homicides and rapes, where personal 
contact results in an exchange of clothing ﬁ bers. Fibers 
can be found under a suspect’s or victim’s ﬁ ngernails. Bur-
glaries can yield ﬁ bers at narrow entrance or exit points 
where clothing becomes snagged. Hit-and-run accidents 
often yield ﬁ bers adhering to vehicles’ door handles, 
grilles, fenders or undercarriages.
Advances in FLSs used to examine evidence have been 
particularly beneﬁ cial in the area of ﬁ ber evidence, where 
often only a strand or two is found. 
SHOE AND TIRE IMPRESSIONS
Shoe and tire prints are common evidence at crime 
scenes and, if collected, recorded and analyzed properly, 
can yield valuable investigative data. Shoe footprints, in 
addition to providing unique wear patterns that can be 
compared with a suspect’s shoes, can indicate whether a 
person was walking or running, was carrying something 
heavy or was unfamiliar with the area or unsure of the 
terrain. Tire marks can show the approximate speed and 
direction of travel and the manufacturer and year the 
tires were made. In the July 1999 slaying of a Yosemite 
Park naturalist, the killer left behind footprints and the 
distinctive tracks of his vehicle, which had a diﬀ erent 
brand of tire on every wheel.

a third, inner layer that is present only in thick, large hairs.

a violent crime, inflicted by either the victim or the 
perpetrator, and the marks left behind can be collected 
as evidence. Bite marks may also be found in partially 
eaten food or other objects that had been placed inside 
a person’s mouth. If the impression is visible, photo-
graph it and then swab the bite area for saliva, blood 
residue, DNA and microorganisms. Then cast it in the 
same way as shoe and tire tread impressions. Dental 
impression material is again preferred because of its 
fine texture.
If a bite mark is too shallow to cast, photograph it and 
then “lift” it by placing tape over it and then transferring 
the tape to plastic to see the outline of the mark. FLSs 
help locate bite marks that are not visible. Again, once 
illuminated, photograph the bite marks.
Investigators may need to enlist the services of a 
forensic odontologist to examine tooth-related evidence 
(Jetmore, 2007b, p.25). Teeth may also be an excellent 
source of genomic DNA (Jetmore).
 5. Add wire or gauze to reinforce the impression.
 6. Pour in more plaster until it overﬂ ows to the retain-
ing frame.
 7. Before the cast hardens, use a pencil or other pointed 
instrument to incise your initials, the case number 
and the date on the back of the impression.
 8. After the cast hardens, remove it and the retaining 
frame. Do not wash the cast; the laboratory does 
this.
 9. Carefully wrap the cast in protective material to avoid 
breakage, and place it in a strong box to ship to the 
laboratory.
Th e laboratory compares the cast with manufacturers’ 
shoe and tire tread ﬁ les.
A relatively new technique in preserving shoe impres-
sion evidence involves a device called an electrostatic 
dust print lifter (EDPL). EDPL is used on dry-origin shoe 
impressions, which involve the transfer of dry residue 
on a shoe tread to another dry surface, such as a carpet 
or seat cushion. Th ese impressions are very fragile and 
among the most diﬃ  cult to locate. Th e lift must then be 
photographed before it can be analyzed, as the lift itself is 
extremely fragile.
BITE MARKS
Bite mark identification is based on the “supposed” 
individuality of teeth and is legally admissible in court, 
having endured a number of legal challenges (Page, 
2007a, p.115). Bites may occur during commission of 
Shoes and boots can leave distinctive impressions that can be 
traced to an individual’s personal possessions. Manufacturers can 
provide photographs of their speciﬁ c lines of shoes and boots that 
can be compared with photographs taken at the scene.

154 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Do not attempt to ﬁ t a suspected tool into a mark to 
see if it matches. Th is disturbs the mark, as well as any 
paint or other trace evidence on the suspect tool, making 
the tool inadmissible as evidence.
Photograph tool marks and then either cast them or send 
the object on which they appear to a laboratory.
Photographing Tool Marks First, photograph the loca-
tion of the tool or tool mark within the general crime scene. 
Th en take close-ups ﬁ rst without and then with a marker 
to show actual size and detail.
Casting Tool Marks Casting of tool marks presents 
special problems because tool marks often are not on a 
horizontal surface. In such cases, construct a platform 
or bridge around the mark by taping tin or other pliable 
material to the surface. Plaster of Paris, plasticine and 
waxes do not provide the detail necessary for tool stria-
tion marks. Better results are obtained from moulage, sili-
cone and other thermosetting materials.
Comparing Tool Marks Tool marks are easy to com-
pare if a suspect tool has not been altered or damaged 
since it made the mark. If the tool is found, send it to the 
laboratory for several comparison standards.
A tool mark is compared with a standard-of-comparison 
impression rather than with the tool itself.
TOOLS AND TOOL MARKS
Common tools such as hammers and screwdrivers are 
often used in crimes and cause little suspicion if found 
in someone’s possession. Such tools are often found in 
a suspect’s vehicle, on the person or at the residence. If 
a tool is found at a crime scene, determine whether it 
belongs to the property owner. Broken tool pieces may 
be found at a crime scene, on a suspect or on a suspect’s 
property.
Identify each suspect tool with a string tag. Wrap it separately 
and pack it in a strong box for transport to the laboratory.
A tool mark is an impression left by a tool on a sur-
face. For example, a screwdriver forced between a window 
and a sill may leave a mark the same depth and width as 
the screwdriver. Th e resiliency of the surface may cause 
explainable diﬀ erences in mark dimensions and tool 
dimensions. If the screwdriver has a chipped head or other 
imperfections, it will leave impressions for later compari-
son. Tool marks are often found in burglaries, auto thefts 
and larcenies in which objects are forced open.
A tool mark provides leads to the size and type of tool 
that made it. Examining a suspect tool determines, within 
limits, whether it could have made the mark in question. 
Even if you ﬁ nd a suspect tool, it is not always possible to 
match it to the tool mark, especially if the tool was dam-
aged when the mark was made. However, residue from 
the forced surface may adhere to the tool, making a com-
parison possible.

These imperfections are unique to this speciﬁ c tool. Marks made with this chisel on a test surface can be compared with marks left at a

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 155
as it passes through the bore, providing greater projectile 
control and accuracy. Caliber refers to the diameter of 
the bore as measured between lands, as well as the size 
of bullet intended for use with a speciﬁ c weapon. As the 
bullet rotates through the barrel, it receives highly indi-
vidualized and characteristic striations, or scratches, 
from the riﬂ ing, which provide valuable comparison 
evidence on recovered bullets. A ﬁ red bullet is marked 
only by the barrel, but a ﬁ red cartridge case is marked by 
several parts of the weapon when it is loaded, ﬁ red and 
extracted.
Several factors can aﬀ ect a bullet’s path. Intervening 
objects, especially the contents of pockets, can deﬂ ect bul-
lets. A raised arm can produce the illusion that a bullet 
pierced the clothing and went sideways before entering 
the body. It may also suggest that the point of impact was 
lower than it actually was. Th is phenomenon gave rise 
to the controversy regarding the ﬁ rst bullet that struck 
President John F. Kennedy, which hit him in the neck. 
Because he had his arm raised to wave at the moment of 
impact, the hole in his jacket suggested that the bullet hit 
him between his shoulder blades when draped normally. 
Bullets can also veer within the body after striking a bone 
or upon leaving the body.
Collecting and Identifying Firearms and Ammunition  
Use extreme caution when handling ﬁ rearms found at 
a crime scene. Tools used to manufacture weapons and 
defects in weapons acquired through use or neglect often 
permit positive identiﬁ cation. A bullet or cartridge case 
can often be linked with the weapon from which it was 
Th e material used for the standard is as close as pos-
sible to the original material. Ideally, a portion of the orig-
inal material is used.
Th e tool mark found at the scene and the standard of 
comparison are placed under a microscope to make the 
striation marks appear as light and dark lines. Th e lines 
are then adjusted to see whether they match. Variations of 
approximately 10 degrees in angle are permissible. Roughly 
60 percent of the lines should match in the comparison. 
Value of Tool Marks A speciﬁ c mark may be similar to 
or found in the same relative location as tool marks found 
at other crimes. Evidence of the way a tool is applied—the 
angle, amount of pressure and general use—can tie one 
crime to another. A tool mark also makes it easier to look 
for a speciﬁ c type of tool. Possession of, or ﬁ ngerprints 
on, such a tool can implicate a suspect.
FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION
Many violent crimes are committed with a ﬁ rearm: a 
revolver, a pistol, a riﬂ e or a shotgun. Each ﬁ rearm imparts 
a distinctive ﬁ ngerprint, or ballistic signature, to every bul-
let and casing ﬁ red through it, which provides useful evi-
dence to investigators. Th e broad deﬁ nition of ballistics 
is that it is the study of the dynamics of projectiles, from 
propulsion through ﬂ ight to impact; a narrower deﬁ nition 
is that it is the study of the functioning of ﬁ rearms.
Th e bore refers to the inside portion of a weapon’s 
barrel, which is surrounded by raised ridges called 
lands and recessed areas called grooves. Th ese lands and 
grooves make up the riﬂ ing and grip and spin the bullet

unique, reproducible, three-dimensional 
contour pattern. The striated toolmarks 
were made in sheet lead. Because the 
striations made in the test environment

at the crime scene, this image depicts 
a positive identiﬁ cation. (Courtesy Ventura

primer combine to form a gaseous cloud or residue, some-
times referred to as a plume, that can reach as far as 5 feet 
from the weapon. Th is residue may settle on the hands, 
sleeves, face and other parts of the shooter, as well as any 
other object or person within the residue fallout radius. 
Th rough various techniques, this residue may be detected 
and used as evidence.
Laboratory examination of GSR under a scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) is considered the most reli-
able analysis method. Adhesive tapes are applied to a 
person’s hands and then placed under an SEM, which the 
ﬁ red. When handling a weapon found at a crime scene, 
do NOT put an object inside the barrel to pick it up. Th e 
object may scratch the inside of the barrel, aﬀ ecting a bal-
listics test. Include in your notes the ﬁ rearm’s make, cali-
ber, model, type, serial number and ﬁ nish, along with any 
unusual characteristics.
Examine weapons for latent ﬁ ngerprints. Photograph 
weapons and then identify them with a string tag. Unload 
ﬁ rearms. Record the serial number on the string tag and 
in your notes. Label the packing container “Firearms.” 
Identify bullets on the base, cartridges on the outside of 
the case near the bullet end and cartridge cases on the 
inside near the open end. Put ammunition in cotton or 
soft paper and ship to a laboratory. Never send live 
ammunition through the mail; use a common carrier.
Evidence from Firearms and Ammunition A plethora 
of physical evidence can be obtained from ﬁ rearms, bul-
lets, shell casings, slugs, shot pellets and gunshot residue: 
“Th ere may be ﬁ ngerprints, blood or other biological evi-
dence on the ﬁ rearm, clips, magazine or bullets. Th e serial 
number on a ﬁ rearm may prove ownership and/or provide 
an investigator with the ability to trace a gun from its man-
ufacturer to sale and ownership” (Jetmore, 2007a, p.20).
Gunpowder tests, shot pattern tests and functional tests 
of a weapon can be made and compared. Th e riﬂ ing of a gun 
barrel, the gun’s ejection and extraction mechanisms and 
markings made by these mechanisms can also be compared. 
Class characteristics of a bullet caused by the ﬁ rearm’s barrel 
can help identify the weapon used. Th ese class characteris-
tics include the number of lands and grooves in the ﬁ rearm’s 
barrel and their height, width and depth (Figure 5.8).
Evidence bullets are compared to determine whether a 
speciﬁ c bullet was ﬁ red from a speciﬁ c comparison weapon. 
Figure 5.9 shows how bullets and casings receive a signa-
ture. Firearms examiners linked 11 sniper shootings around 
Washington, DC, in October 2002 using the same methods 
to analyze bullets and casings. Shot patterns determine the 
distance from which the victim was shot and may disclose 
the type of choke on the gun and its barrel length. Gun 
parts found at a crime scene are compared with a weapon, 
and the trigger pull is tested and measured.
Forensic criminologists can use ﬁ rearms evidence 
smaller than a ﬁ ngernail to build a case strong enough 
to put people in prison. However, crime labs have faced 
increasingly diﬃ  cult identiﬁ cation challenges with cer-
tain types of bullets and projectiles. 
Gunshot residue (GSR) is another type of evidence 
investigators may seek in crimes involving ﬁ rearms. 
Whenever a ﬁ rearm is discharged, the gunpowder and 
Technology Innovations
Page (2008, p.54) describes a “revolutionary” 
microstamping technology in California, the ﬁ rst 
state in the nation to mandate its use (Bill AB 1471).
The bill requires that all semi-automatic handguns 
purchased in California, beginning in 2010, have the 
ability to imprint identifying information on cartridges 
ﬁ red by the weapon—turning spent cartridges into 
potential evidence in civil and criminal cases.
The ﬂ edgling microstamping technology, con-
sidered by some the next generation in ballistics 
information, is a relatively recent development 
that utilizes lasers to make distinct microscopic 
engravings on the breech face and ﬁ ring pin of a 
gun. As the gun is ﬁ red, the weapon’s serial num-
ber is stamped onto the cartridge, giving police 
some chance of determining from which weapon 
the shell was ﬁ red.
The technology is not without its critics, one of 
which is the National Shooting Sports Foundation 
(NSSF), which asserts, “AB 1471 fails to recognize 
the unfortunate reality that mandating the technology 
for ﬁ rearms sold each year in the state of California 
will create an illegal black market for ‘non-laser 
engraved’ ﬁ rearms and further increase illegal inter-
state ﬁ rearm trafﬁ cking” (Page, 2008, p.58). The NSSF 
also notes that that law doesn’t consider the tens of 
millions of ﬁ rearms in circulation that have not been, 
and cannot now be, micro-laser engraved. The Cali-
fornia National Riﬂ e Association (NRA) contends that 
microstamping could create false evidence trails 
if criminals pick up microstamped cartridge cases 
ﬁ red and abandoned at any police or public ﬁ ring 
range and planted at crime scenes (Page, p.59). 

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 157
technician uses to locate and identify speciﬁ c residue par-
ticles and their composition.
Shooter ID kits are also available for conducting GSR 
tests in the ﬁ eld. Th ese kits allow oﬃ  cers to quickly test 
multiple suspects and may be used by investigators in dis-
tinguishing between a suicide and a homicide, with the 
absence of GSR on a victim indicating homicide and an 
abundance of GSR suggesting suicide. 
As with ﬁ ngerprints and DNA, a national database of 
ballistic information has helped investigators link ﬁ rearms 
with oﬀ enders. Before 2002, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with the Integrated Ballis-
tics Identiﬁ cation System (IBIS) (originally called “Cease-
Fire”), and the FBI, with DrugFire, each collected ballistic 
data but kept their systems separate, because of incompat-
ibility issues. Realizing the value in and need for a uniﬁ ed 
ballistic evidence system, the ATF created the National 
Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN).
GLASS
Glass can have great evidentiary value. Tiny pieces of glass 
can adhere to a suspect’s shoes and clothing. Larger glass 
fragments are processed for ﬁ ngerprints and can be ﬁ t 
back together to indicate the direction from which the 
glass was broken. Th e source of broken glass fragments 
also can often be determined.
Label glass fragments using adhesive tape on each 
piece. Wrap each piece separately in cotton to avoid 
chipping, and place them in a strong box marked 
“fragile” to send to the laboratory.

FIGURE 5.8
Features of a riﬂ ed ﬁ rearm’s barrel.
Microscopic, spectrographic and physical compari-
sons are made of the glass fragments. Microscopic exami-
nation of the edges of two pieces of glass can prove they 
were one piece at one time. Spectrographic analysis can 
determine the elements of the glass, even extremely small 
fragments. Submit for comparison pieces of glass at least 
the size of a half-dollar.
In general, high-velocity impacts are less likely to 
shatter glass than are low-velocity impacts. A bullet that 
does not shatter glass will generally leave a small, round 
entry hole and a larger, cone-shaped exit hole (Figure 
5.10). Th e faster a bullet travels, the smaller the cracks 
and the tighter the entry point will be.
Th e sequence of bullets ﬁ red through a piece of glass 
can be determined from the pattern of cracks. Th e direc-
tion and angle of a bullet or bullets through glass can also 
be determined by assembling the fragments. When a bul-
let hits a glass surface, the glass bends causing radial frac-
tures on the side of the glass opposite the point of impact. 
Th ese concentric rings indicate the bullet’s direction.
Th is allows investigators to determine which side of 
a piece of glass has received an impact, because a blow 
causes the glass to compress on that side and to stretch 
on the opposite side. As the impact occurs, concentric 
fractures form around the point of impact and intercon-
nect with radial cracks to form triangular pieces. Th e edge 
of each triangular piece has visible stress lines that tell 
the direction of the blow. Th e lines on the side that was 
struck have almost parallel stress lines that tend to curve 
downward on the side of the glass opposite the blow (see 
Figure 5.11). Such an examination can establish whether 
a burglar broke out of or into a building.
In addition to concentric and radial fractures, investiga-
tors should look for Wallner lines, also called ridges, which 
are rib-shaped marks with a wavelike pattern and are almost 
always concave in the direction from which the crack was 
propagating. In low-velocity impact fractures, the ridges or 
Wallner lines on radial cracks nearest the point of impact are at 
right angles to the side opposite, or to the rear, of the impact, 
a phenomenon referred to as the “4R Rule” (Ridges on radial 
cracks are at right angles to the rear). It should be noted, how-
ever, that tempered glass, laminated glass, and small pieces 
of glass tightly held in a frame or window case do not reliably 
demonstrate the fracture patterns just described.
Because larger glass fragments can be matched by ﬁ t-
ting the pieces together, a slight mark put on the side of 
the glass that was facing out helps to reconstruct stress 
lines. To protect glass as evidence, put sharp points in 
putty, modeling clay or some other soft substance.
Th e Glass Evidence Reference Database contains more 
than 700 glass samples from manufacturers, distributors and 
vehicle junkyards and is a useful resource for investigators 
(Bowen and Schneider, 2007). Although it cannot determine

on a suspect’s shoes or clothing from his or her area of res-
idence. Because soils found in the victim’s residence may 
have been brought there by the victim or by other persons 
not suspected in the crime, collect elimination samples of 
soil from the area around the scene.
Put one pound of comparison soil into a container identi-
ﬁ ed on the outside. Collect evidence soil the same way. 
Seal both containers to prevent loss, wrap them and send 
them to a laboratory.
Soils vary greatly in color, particle size, mineral con-
tent and chemical composition. Some comparisons are 
the source of an unknown piece of glass, the database can 
assess the relative frequency that two glass samples from 
diﬀ erent sources would have the same elemental proﬁ le.
SOILS AND MINERALS
Forensic geologists examine soils and minerals—substances 
such as mud, cement, plaster, ceramics and insulation—
found at a crime scene or on a victim, a suspect, clothing, 
vehicles or other items. Th is circumstantial evidence can 
place a suspect at a crime scene or destroy an alibi.
Although most soil evidence is found outdoors, sus-
pects can bring soil into structures from the outside. Soils 
found inside a structure are most valuable if brought there

How bullets and casings receive a signature
When a weapon is ﬁred, it leaves unique markings—much like ﬁngerprints—on bullets and casings.
Linking weapons to shootings
Here are two ways the FBI’s DrugFire system and the ATF’s Integrated Ballistics Identiﬁcation System (IBIS) databases
can use the markings to link weapons to shootings.
Scenario 1
Investigators ﬁnd bullets and/
or casings at a crime scene.
Scenario 2
Investigators arrest a suspect with
a ﬁrearm or recover a ﬁrearm.
1. Technicians enter the
markings from bullets
and/or casings into a
computer.

and compares them against other markings

X-ray diﬀ raction (to determine mineral content) and by 
microscope.
Because varied species of plants grow in diﬀ erent sec-
tions of the country, examining dirt evidence that contains 
pollen and spores (palynology) is useful. Th is evidence can 
refute the alibi of a suspect who is arrested at a distance from 
a crime scene and denies having been there. Electron micro-
scope detection of pollen and spores found at the crime scene 
and on the suspect’s clothing or vehicle will refute the alibi.
SAFE INSULATION
Most safes are ﬁ re-resistant, sheet-steel boxes with thick 
insulation. If safes are pried, ripped, punched, drilled or 
blown open, the insulation breaks apart and falls or dis-
seminates into the room. Burglars often carry some of 
this insulation in their clothing. People with safe insula-
tion in or on their clothing must be considered suspects 
because few people normally come into contact with safe 
insulation. Tools used to open a safe can also have insula-
tion on them, as may the ﬂ oor of a vehicle in which the 
tools were placed after a burglary. Investigating burglary 
is the focus of Chapter 13.
Put samples of safe insulation in paper containers identi-
ﬁ ed on the outside.
Safe insulation can be compared with particles found 
on a suspect or on the tools or vehicle used during a 
crime. Comparison tests can show what type of safe the 
insulation came from and whether it is the same insula-
tion found at other burglaries. Insulation is also found on 
paint chips from safes. Always take standards of compari-
son if safe insulation is found at a crime scene.
Th e FBI and other laboratories maintain ﬁ les on safe 
insulations used by major safe companies. Home and 
building insulation materials are also on ﬁ le. Th is infor-
mation is available to all law enforcement agencies.

visual; others are made through laboratory analysis. Both 
diﬀ erences and similarities have value because soils sepa-
rated by only a few inches can be very diﬀ erent. Th erefore, 
take suﬃ  cient samples (about 1 cup) directly from and 
around the suspected area at perhaps 5- to 100-foot inter-
vals, depending on the scene. In addition, soil samples 
should be packaged in only glass vials or plastic locking 
bags, never envelopes.
If soil evidence is in or on a suspect’s clothing, place 
the entire article with the soil intact in a paper bag and 
send it to the laboratory. If an object containing soil 
cannot be moved, use a spatula to scrape oﬀ  or otherwise 
collect the soil. Th en place the soil in a glass jar or plastic 
locking bag, properly marked and identiﬁ ed.
Chemical analysis of soil is expensive and not always 
satisfactory. Soil is generally examined by density, by

national drug code and drug class (Bowen and Schneider, 
2007). Another resource is PharmInfoNet, a free Internet 
database containing information on prescription drugs, 
including uses, marketing and availability and common 
side eﬀ ects (Bowen and Schneider). If a drug is a prescrip-
tion drug, verify the contents with the issuing pharma-
cist. Determine how much of the original prescription has 
been consumed. 
Put liquid drugs in a bottle and attach a label. Put 
powdered and solid drugs in a pillbox or powder box 
and identify them in the same way.
A device called the “Hound” helps investigators detect 
and identify drugs. Th is toolbox-sized sniﬀ er can detect 
drug residue in concentrations so small that the skin oil 
left behind on a doorknob may trigger the device’s alarm. 
It works by drawing several cubic feet of air through a 
ﬁ lter and concentrating the compounds extracted into a 
smaller sample, which is then analyzed by an ion mobil-
ity spectrometer that is part of the device. A detailed dis-
cussion of evidence in drug investigations is contained in 
Chapter 18.
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
As implied by its name, a weapon of mass destruction 
(WMD) is designed to produce substantial damage, dis-
order and disruption to people and infrastructures: “A 
weapon of mass destruction (WMD) is typically associated 
ROPES, STRINGS AND TAPES
Ropes, twines, strings and tapes are frequently used in 
crimes and can provide leads in identifying and linking 
suspects with a crime.
Put labeled rope, twine and string into a container. Put 
tapes on waxed paper or cellophane and then place 
them in a container.
Laboratories have various comparison standards for 
ropes, twines and tapes. If a suspect sample matches a 
known sample, the laboratory can determine the manu-
facturer of the item and its most common uses. Cordage 
can be compared for composition, construction, color and 
diameter. Rope ends can be matched if they are frayed. 
Likewise, pieces of torn tape can be compared with a sus-
pect roll of tape.
Fingerprints can occur on either side of a tape. Th e 
smooth side is developed by the normal powder method 
or by using cyanoacrylate (superglue) if the surface is 
extremely slick. Th e sticky-side prints will be visible and 
are either photographed or retained intact.
DRUGS
Drug-identiﬁ cation kits can be used to make a prelimi-
nary analysis of a suspicious substance, but a full analysis 
must be done at a laboratory. One valuable reference is 
“Ident-A-Drug,” which contains codes imprinted on tab-
lets and capsules, information on color and shape, the

CHAPTER 5 | Forensics/Physical Evidence | 161
instruments—pens, crayons and pencils—and various 
types of inks can also be compared. Indented writings, 
obliterated or altered writings, used carbon paper, burned 
or charred paper and shoeprint or tire tread impressions 
made on paper surfaces can all be examined in a labora-
tory. A document’s age can also be determined.
Do not touch documents with your bare hands. Place 
documents in a cellophane envelope and then in a 
manila envelope identiﬁ ed on the outside.
Standards of comparison are required for many docu-
ment examinations. To obtain handwriting standards 
from a suspect, take samples until you believe he or she 
is writing normally. Th e suspect should not see the origi-
nal document or copy. Tell the suspect what to write and 
remove each sample from sight after it is completed. Pro-
vide no instructions on spelling, punctuation or wording. 
Use the same size and type of paper and writing materi-
als as the original. Obtain right-handed and left-handed 
samples as well as samples written at diﬀ erent speeds. 
Samples of undictated writings, such as letters, are also 
helpful as standards. In forgery cases, include the genuine 
signatures as well as the forged ones. 
A useful resource for investigators is the Forensic Infor-
mation System for Handwriting (FISH), which is maintained 
by the U.S. Secret Service. Th is database merges federal 
and Interpol databases of genuine and counterfeit iden-
tiﬁ cation documents, such as passports, driver’s licenses 
and credit cards (Bowman and Schneider, 2007). Caution 
must be used in focusing solely on counterfeit documents, 
however, because in many cases criminals are able to use 
legitimate documents in illegal ways. For example, the ter-
rorists involved in the 9/11 attacks breached the U.S. border 
through fraudulently obtained—but genuine—U.S. travel 
documents. As a result of that discovery, the U.S. Depart-
ment of State’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) stepped 
up its overseas investigations of visa fraud, and these inves-
tigations resulted in revocation of 1,680 visas and 512 
arrests in 2006 alone (Griﬃ  n, 2007, p.30).
To help identify and investigate other counterfeit or 
crime-related handwritten documents, the FBI maintains 
a national fraudulent check ﬁ le, an anonymous letter ﬁ le, 
a bank robbery note ﬁ le, paper watermarks, safety paper 
and checkwriter standards. Also, as in other areas of evi-
dence examination, computer programs have been devel-
oped to analyze handwriting.
People often type anonymous or threatening letters, 
believing that typewritten materials are not as traceable as 
handwritten ones. However, some courts have held that 
typewriting can be compared more accurately than hand-
writing and almost as accurately as ﬁ ngerprints. To collect 
with nuclear and/or radiological, biological, or chemical 
agents; however, it also may be an explosive” (Waggoner, 
2007, p.144). In our post–9/11 world, the entire law 
enforcement profession has a heightened awareness of ter-
rorists and the tools they use to paralyze people, not only 
psychologically through fear, but also perhaps physically 
through chemical agents. Unfortunately, the methods to 
analyze and ﬁ ngerprint the source of these weapons are 
currently insuﬃ  cient.
Drielak (2006, p.48) contends, “Today’s global jus-
tice environment demands a new standard for collecting 
chemical, biological, and radiological criminal evidence in 
cases involving weapons of mass destruction.” He (p.53) 
explains, “Th e collection of chemical, biological, and radio-
logical evidence can be broken down into 15 basic sam-
pling disciplines that cover ﬁ ve basic sample matrixes. 
Th ese matrixes include aerosols (or air), liquids, solids, 
surfaces, and dermal samples. Each of these evidence 
collection disciplines has its own unique and detailed 
requirements.” At any WMD crime scene, however, the 
public’s safety takes precedence over evidence collection 
(Drielak, p.52).

Typing, handwriting and printing can be examined. 
Typewriters and printers can be compared and paper

162 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
DIGITAL EVIDENCE
Th e digital revolution and preponderance of electronic 
devices pervading everyday life, such as cell phones, pag-
ers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), computers and 
global positioning systems (GPSs), have generated a new 
class of evidence and requirements for handling it: “Th e 
need for state and local police departments to leap ahead 
in the war on cyber-crime and develop procedures for 
identifying and processing electronic evidence is urgent” 
(Ritter, 2006, p.20). Perhaps the greatest challenge in elec-
tronic crimes is the absence of geographic boundaries and 
the question of jurisdiction (Ritter). Another challenge is 
the length of time it takes for Internet service providers 
(ISPs) to respond to subpoenas. Currently, response time 
can run as long as several weeks.
Much of the information available about digital evi-
dence relates to cell phones. At the end of 2006, there 
were 233 million U.S. wireless subscribers, more than 76 
percent of the total U.S. population (Kanable, 2007, p.16). 
Heinecke (2007a, p.62) suggests, “Considering the perva-
sive nature of cell phones, and their ability to contain vast 
amounts of useful information and potentially powerful 
evidence, cell phone seizure devices are a critical compo-
nent of the forensic examiner’s toolkit.”
Th e ﬁ rst part of collecting evidence from a cell phone 
is the actual handling of the device. Dunnagan and 
Schroader (2006, p.47) suggest the following basic rules:
 1. Do not change the condition of the evidence. If it’s 
oﬀ , leave it oﬀ ; if it’s on, leave it on.
 2. Look for more devices. Remove any other potential 
points of evidence, which can include SIM cards, 
external media, power cables and data cables.
 3. Make sure you have a search warrant before searching 
the device.
 4. Return the device to a lab for proper processing.
 5. Use forensically sound software and processing tools, 
and validate your evidence. 
Kanable (2006, p.21) cautions, “No one should attempt 
to analyze a cell phone without training. Even then, a pro-
cess should be followed and individuals knowledgeable in 
the process should be performing the exam.” All cell phones 
leave a trail: “Each time a cell phone is turned on, it sends a 
registration message, including the serial and phone num-
bers, to the closest cellular tower” (Puente, 2007). Global 
positioning system chips built into cell phones allow author-
ities to track criminals as well as people in need of help.
Each cell phone provider stores and maintains sub-
scriber records, which include subscriber information, 
such as name, address and birth date, as well as  call-detail 
typewriting standards, remove the ribbon from the sus-
pected typewriter and send the ribbon to a laboratory. Use 
a diﬀ erent ribbon to take each sample. Take samples using 
light, medium and heavy pressure. Submit one carbon-copy 
sample with the typewriter on stencil position. Do not send 
the typewriter to a laboratory, but hold it as evidence.
Given enough typing samples, it is often possible to 
determine the make and model of a machine. Typewriter 
standard ﬁ les are available at the FBI laboratory. Th e 
information can greatly narrow the search for the actual 
machine. Th e most important comparison is between the 
suspect document and a speciﬁ c typewriter.
As word processing replaces typewriters, the word-
processing software program and the printer used become 
important evidence. Computer scanners and desktop pub-
lishing programs make producing fraudulent documents 
much easier. Collect as evidence the computer hard drive, 
printer, copier, scanner or whichever devices were used to 
generate the document.
Computer-related document evidence may be con-
tained on tapes or disks, not readily discernible and highly 
susceptible to destruction. In addition to information 
on tapes and disks, evidence may take the form of data 
reports, programming or other printed materials based 
on information from computer ﬁ les. Investigators who 
handle computer tapes and disks should avoid contact 
with the recording surfaces. Th ey should never write on 
computer disk labels with a ballpoint pen or pencil and 
should never use paper clips on or rubber bands around 
computer disks. To do so may destroy the data they con-
tain. Computer tapes and disks taken as evidence should 
be stored vertically, at approximately 70°F, and away from 
bright light, dust and magnetic ﬁ elds.
Photographs frequently are also valuable evidence, 
whether taken by an oﬃ  cer or by someone outside the 
department. Some researchers are focusing their eﬀ orts 
on techniques to enhance grainy, blurred or poorly con-
trasted photographs by digitally converting them and sub-
jecting them to software programs. Photographic images 
of injuries on human skin can be enhanced using reﬂ ective 
and ﬂ uorescent UV imaging.
Recall that the best-evidence rule stipulates that the 
original evidence is to be presented whenever possible. 
For example, a photograph or photocopy of a forged check 
is not admissible in court; the check itself is required.
When submitting any document evidence to a labo-
ratory, clearly indicate which documents are original and 
which are comparison standards. Also indicate whether 
latent ﬁ ngerprints are requested. Although original docu-
ments are needed for laboratory examinations and court 
exhibits, copies can be used for ﬁ le searches. A photograph 
is superior to a photocopy.

automobile paints, which can help identify the year, make 
and color of a motor vehicle from a chip of paint left at the 
scene. 
In hit-and-run cases, collect paint samples from any area 
of the vehicle that had contact with the victim. Take paint 
samples down to the original metal to show the layer 
composition.
Use small boxes for submitting paint samples to the 
crime lab, putting samples from diﬀ erent parts of the vehicle 
in separate small boxes. If paint chips are on the clothing of 
the victim or suspect, send the entire article of clothing in a 
paper bag to the laboratory, properly labeled and identiﬁ ed.
SKELETAL REMAINS
Laboratory examination can determine whether skeletal 
remains are animal or human.
If adequate human skeletal remains are available, the 
sex, race, approximate age at death, approximate height 
and approximate time since death can be determined.
Dental comparisons and X-rays of old fractures are other 
important identifying features or individual characteristics.
Forensic anthropology uses standard scientiﬁ c 
techniques developed by physical anthropologists and 
archaeologists to identify human skeletal remains as they 
relate to a criminal case. Ongoing research at the Body 
Farm in Knoxville, Tennessee, is helping scientists observe 
the decomposition process of the human body following 
death and how exposure to various environmental condi-
tions aﬀ ects this process. 
WOOD
Wood comparisons are made from items on a suspect, in 
a vehicle or in or on clothing found at a crime scene. Th e 
origin is determined by the size or the ﬁ t of the fracture 
with an original piece of wood or by matching the sides or 
ends of pieces of wood. Th e type of wood is determined 
from its cellular elements. When handling wood evidence, 
if it is found wet, keep it wet; if it is dry, keep it dry.
OTHER TYPES OF EVIDENCE
Prescription eyeglasses, broken buttons, glove prints and 
other personal evidence found at a crime scene can also 
be examined and compared. Investigators should learn 
records containing data regarding incoming and outgo-
ing phone numbers and the towers that transmitted 
these calls. Carriers commonly hold records for 90 days, 
but if an investigation cannot be completed within that 
time, a preservation order letter should be submitted to 
the phone company speciﬁ cally documenting which cel-
lular records you need preserved (Reiber, 2007, p.41). 
Th e records will usually be held for 90 days from the 
date the carrier receives the request, unless investiga-
tors “refresh” the preservation request for an additional 
90 days.
About 100 colleges and universities now oﬀ er under-
graduate and graduate courses in digital forensics, with 
a few oﬀ ering majors (Whitcomb, 2007, p.42). Several 
publications are also available as resources to investiga-
tors, such as Th e Journal of Digital Forensic Practice, which 
debuted in 2007. Th e National Institute of Justice has 
published Investigative Uses of Technology: Devices Tools 
and Techniques, which presents detailed information 
regarding digital evidence. Th e investigation of computer 
crimes is the focus of Chapter 17.
LAUNDRY AND DRY-CLEANING MARKS
Many launderers and dry cleaners use speciﬁ c marking sys-
tems. Th e Laundry and Dry Cleaning National Association 
has ﬁ les on such marking systems. Many police laboratories 
also maintain a ﬁ le of visible and invisible laundry marks 
used by local establishments. Military clothing is marked 
with the wearer’s serial number, name and organization.
Use UV light to detect invisible laundry marks. Submit 
the entire garment to a laboratory, identiﬁ ed with a string 
tag or a marking directly on the garment.
Laundry and dry-cleaning marks are used to identify 
the dead and injured in mass disasters such as airplane 
crashes, ﬁ res and ﬂ oods and in other circumstances as 
well. For example, a dead baby was traced by its sheet’s 
laundry marks. Clothing labels can also assist in locating 
the possible source of the clothing.
PAINT
Paints are complex and are individual in color, composi-
tion, texture and layer composition: “Th e layer structure of 
a questioned paint sample can be compared with a known 
source from a suspect. Th e sequence, relative thickness, 
color, texture, number, and chemical composition of each 
of the layers can be compared” (Waggoner, 2007, p.101). 
Police laboratories and the FBI maintain ﬁ les of standard 

164 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
crime scenes involving violence. Th erefore, it is important 
to know the facts about these infectious agents.
AIDS is not spread through casual contact such as 
touching an infected person or sharing equipment. Nor 
is it spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. An 
important issue related to HIV/AIDS is a person’s conﬁ -
dentiality rights concerning his or her HIV status, includ-
ing disclosure of such information in police reports. 
Investigators should be familiar with their jurisdiction’s 
basic medical information conﬁ dentiality laws as well as 
any other speciﬁ c laws pertaining to HIV/AIDS.
Chances are less than 1 percent that an oﬃ  cer will 
contract the AIDS virus on the job. Tuberculosis (TB), 
meningitis and hepatitis pose greater threats. TB is 
transmitted through the air by coughing, hacking and 
wheezing. TB can also be transmitted through saliva, 
urine, blood and other body ﬂ uids. Meningitis, spread 
through the air, causes inﬂ ammation of the membranes 
that surround the brain. Th e hepatitis B virus, known 
today as HBV, is a blood-borne pathogen that can live 
outside the body longer than HIV can. HBV is found in 
human blood, urine, semen, cerebrospinal ﬂ uid, vaginal 
secretions and saliva. A safe, eﬀ ective vaccine to prevent 
HBV is available.
Schneider (2007, p.20) reports on the methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) virus, which he 
describes as “tougher than Kevlar”: 
MRSA is a severe and sometimes deadly staph infection 
that is resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, which 
include methicillin and other more common antibiotics 
such as oxacillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin. It is conta-
gious through casual contact between individuals, shared 
surfaces, and even personal items such as towels and 
linens. Th e infection is very painful, can be deadly, and 
treatment consists of draining and rebreeding the wound 
followed by multiple potent doses of antibiotics that 
cause most patients to feel ill during treatment.
 
What’s worse is MRSA is a growing epidemic. Th e 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
report staph bacteria are one of the most common 
causes of skin infection in the United States and are 
a common cause of pneumonia, surgical wound infec-
tions and bloodstream infections. Th e majority of 
MRSA infections occur among patients in hospitals or 
other health care settings; however, the CDC reports it 
is becoming more common in the community setting. 
Use precautions when collecting blood evidence and 
other body ﬂ uids. Universal precautions, which is the pro-
tocol used by medical health professionals, dictates that 
public safety oﬃ  cials treat every individual as if he or she is 
infected and take precautions to minimize risks. Consider all 
body secretions as potential health hazards. If body ﬂ uids are 
to read “product DNA,” the printed code that appears on 
nearly every manufactured, mass-produced item, because 
it can provide valuable leads. For example, the numbers 
on a candy bar wrapper can tell investigators when that 
candy bar was made, packaged, shipped and delivered, 
and to what store. Other discarded items at a crime scene 
that may yield useful information include store and res-
taurant receipts, bank deposit slips, beverage contain-
ers, cigarette packages, membership and check-cashing 
cards, clothing manufacturer labels and laundry tags and 
footwear. If there is a problem processing any evidence, a 
laboratory can provide speciﬁ c collecting and packaging 
instructions.
EVIDENCE HANDLING AND 
INFECTIOUS DISEASE
Throughout this chapter, you have looked at 
ways to collect evidence and keep it secure from 
contamination. As a ﬁ nal discussion in handling physical 
evidence, consider how to protect yourself from contami-
nation. “One of the risks you face as a law enforcement oﬃ  -
cer is potential exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as 
the hepatitis B virus, the hepatitis C virus and the human 
immunodeﬁ ciency virus (HIV)” (Bloodborne Pathogens, no 
date, p.2). Investigators are likely to encounter crimes of 
violence involving the blood and other body ﬂ uids of peo-
ple with infectious diseases. Police oﬃ  cers are likely to 
encounter these infectious body ﬂ uids during the search of

as cameras, tools and notebooks, must be decontaminated 
using a bleach solution or rubbing alcohol. Even properly 
dried and packaged evidence is still potentially infectious. 
Th erefore, place appropriate warnings on all items.
After processing, decontaminate the crime scene. If it 
is to be left for future decontamination, place biohazard 
warning signs and notify the cleaning team of possible 
contamination.
Further information on procedures for dealing with 
evidence with potential of transmitting an infectious dis-
ease can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, Oﬃ  ce of Health and Biosafety, 1600

present at a crime scene, even if dried, wear latex gloves, 
goggles and a face mask. Secure evidence in glass, metal or 
plastic containers. Seal evidence bags with tape rather than 
staples. Do not allow hand-to-mouth or hand-to-face con-
tact during collection. Do not eat, smoke, apply makeup or 
drink at crime scenes because these activities may transfer 
contaminated body ﬂ uids to you. When ﬁ nished, wash your 
hands thoroughly (20 to 30 seconds) with soap and water: 
“Hand washing ranks as the top protection against MRSA 
and other super bugs” (Garrett, 2008, p.51). 
While processing the crime scene, constantly be alert 
for sharp objects, such as hypodermic needles and syringes. 
If practical, use disposable items where blood is present so 
the items can be incinerated. All nondisposable items, such

Prints of persons with reason to be at the scene are taken 
and used as elimination prints. Fingerprints are positive 
evidence of a person’s identity. Th ey cannot, however, 
indicate a person’s age, sex or race.
 
DNA proﬁ ling uses material from which chromosomes 
are made to positively identify individuals. DNA can tell 
investigators the sample donor’s gender, race, eye color 
and hair color. Blood can be identiﬁ ed as animal or human 
and is very useful in eliminating suspects. Age or race can-
not be determined from blood samples. DNA analysis, 
however, can provide positive identiﬁ cation. Microscopic 
examination determines whether hair is animal or human. 
Many characteristics can be determined from human hair: 
the part of the body it came from; whether it was bleached 
or dyed, freshly cut, pulled out or burned; and whether 
there is blood or semen on it. Race, sex and age cannot be 
determined.
 
After photographing, cast shoe or tire tread impres-
sions found in dirt, sand or snow. Identify each suspected 
tool with a string tag, wrap it separately and pack it in a 
strong box to send to a laboratory. Photograph tool marks 
and then either cast them or send the object on which 
they appear to a laboratory. A tool mark is compared with 
a standard-of-comparison impression rather than with 
the tool itself.
 
Examine ﬁ rearms for latent ﬁ ngerprints. Photograph 
ﬁ rearms and then identify them with a string tag. Unload 
guns and record their serial number on a string tag and in 
your notes. Label the packing container “Firearms.” Iden-
tify bullets on the base, cartridges on the outside of the 
case near the bullet end and cartridge cases on the inside 
near the open end. Put ammunition in cotton or soft 
paper and ship to a laboratory. Never send live ammuni-
tion through the mail; use a common carrier instead.
 
Label glass fragments using adhesive tape on each 
piece. Wrap each piece separately in cotton to avoid chip-
ping and place in a strong box marked “fragile” to send 
to a laboratory. Put one pound of comparison soil into a 
container identiﬁ ed on the outside. Collect evidence soil 
the same way. Seal both containers to prevent loss, wrap 
them and send them to a laboratory.
 
Put samples of safe insulation in paper containers 
identiﬁ ed on the outside. Put labeled rope, twine and 
string in a container. Put tapes on waxed paper or cel-
lophane and then place them in a container. Put liquid 
drugs in a bottle and attach a label. Put powdered and 
solid drugs in a pillbox or powder box and identify them 
in the same way.
 
Do not touch documents with your bare hands. Place 
them in a cellophane envelope and then in a manila enve-
lope identiﬁ ed on the outside. Use ultraviolet light to 
detect invisible laundry marks. Submit the entire gar-
ment to a laboratory, identiﬁ ed with a string tag or with 
Criminal investigations rely heavily on various types of evi-
dence. To be of value, evidence must be legally and prop-
erly seized and processed. Processing physical evidence 
includes discovering or recognizing it; collecting, record-
ing and identifying it; packaging, conveying and storing 
it; examining it; exhibiting it in court; and disposing of it 
when the case is closed. Th e relative importance of physi-
cal evidence depends on its ability to establish that a crime 
was committed, as well as how, when and by whom.
 
To determine what is evidence, ﬁ rst consider the 
apparent crime. Th en look for any objects unrelated or 
foreign to the scene, unusual in their location or number, 
damaged or broken or whose relation to other objects sug-
gests a pattern that ﬁ ts the crime. Th e more individual the 
evidence, the greater its value.
 
Common errors in collecting evidence are (1) not col-
lecting enough of the sample, (2) not obtaining standards 
of comparison and (3) not maintaining the integrity of 
the evidence.
 
Mark or identify each item of evidence in a way that 
can be recognized later. Include the date and case number 
as well as your identifying mark or initials. Record in your 
notes the date and time of collection, where it was found 
and by whom, case number, description of the item and 
who took custody of it. Package each item separately in 
durable containers to maintain the integrity of evidence. 
Personal delivery, registered mail, insured parcel post, air 
express, Federal Express (FedEx) and United Parcel Service 
(UPS) are legal ways to transport evidence. Always specify 
that the person who receives the evidence is to sign for it.
 
Package evidence properly to keep it in substantially 
the same condition in which it was found. Document cus-
tody of the evidence at every stage. To ensure admissibility 
of the evidence in court, be able to (1) identify the evidence 
as that found at the crime scene, (2) describe exactly where 
it was found, (3) establish its custody from discovery to 
the present and (4) voluntarily explain any changes that 
have occurred in the evidence. After a case is closed, evi-
dence is returned to the owner, auctioned or destroyed.
 
Frequently examined physical evidence includes 
ﬁ ngerprints; voiceprints; language; DNA; body ﬂ uids 
(including blood); scent; hairs and ﬁ bers; shoe and tire 
impressions; bite marks; tools and tool marks; ﬁ rearms 
and ammunition; glass; soils and minerals; safe insula-
tion; rope, strings and tapes; drugs; bioterror agents; doc-
uments; laundry and dry-cleaning marks; paint; skeletal 
remains; wood; and many other types of evidence.
 
Know how to locate, develop, photograph, lift and 
submit ﬁ ngerprints for classiﬁ cation by experts. Any 
hard, smooth, nonporous surface can contain latent ﬁ n-
gerprints. Do not powder a print unless it is necessary; 
do not powder a visible print until after photographing it.

a marking directly on the garment. In hit-and-run cases, 
collect paint samples from any area of the vehicle that 
had contact with the victim. Take paint samples down 
to the original metal to show the layer composition. If 
adequate human skeletal remains are available, the sex, 
race, approximate age at death, approximate height and 
approximate time since death can be determined.
Physical Evidence
• Was all physical evidence photographed before any-
thing was moved?
• • Was the physical evidence located in the crime scene 
sketch?
• • Were relevant facts recorded in your notebook?
• • Was the evidence properly identiﬁ ed, including the 
date, case number, your initials or mark and a descrip-
tion of the evidence?
• • Was the evidence properly packaged to avoid contami-
nation or destruction?
• • Were standards of comparison obtained if needed?
• • Was the evidence sent in a way that kept it secure and 
provided a signed receipt, such as by registered mail?
• • Was the evidence kept continuously secure until pre-
sented in court?
 
Th e following types of physical evidence are fre-
quently found at a crime scene and should be searched 
for, depending on the type of crime committed:

SOURCES OF INFORMATION
In addition to physical evidence, three primary 
sources of information are available.
Important sources of information include (1) reports, 
records and databases, including those found on the 
Internet; (2) people who are not suspects in a crime but 
who know something about the crime or those involved; 
and (3) suspects in the crime.
 
Often these sources overlap. For example, informa-
tion in a hotel’s records may be supplemented by informa-
tion supplied by the hotel manager or the doorkeeper.
 
Because so many informational sources exist in any 
given community, it is helpful to develop a sources-of-
information ﬁ le. Each time you locate someone who can 
provide important information on criminal activity in 
a community, make a card with information about this 
source or enter the information into a computer ﬁ le. For 
example, if a hotel manager provides useful information, 
make a card with the manager’s name, name of the hotel, 
address, telephone number, type of information provided 
and other relevant information. File the card under hotel.
A sources-of-information ﬁ le contains the name and 
location of people, organizations and records that may 
assist in a criminal investigation.
 
We have progressed from the Stone Age to the agri-
cultural age to the industrial age to the information 
age, a period driven by words rather than by agriculture 
or industry as in the past. Knowledge is doubling every 
2.5 years. In no area have more advances been made than 
in moving information. Th e challenge is in how to keep 
abreast of it all.
finding physical evidence. Although physical evidence 
is important by itself, supporting oral testimony adds 
considerable value when presented in court. Conversely, 
although a confession may appear conclusive, it cannot 
stand alone legally. It must be supported by physical evi-
dence or other corroboration.
nowledge obtained through questioning and 
physical evidence is equally important. Physi-
cal evidence can provide a basis for questioning people 
about a crime, and questioning can provide leads for 
K
 
Among the most important advances for law enforce-
ment is the availability of computerized information. 
Such information has been in existence for several years 
but not in individual squad cars and easily accessible by 
the average oﬃ  cer on the beat. Oﬃ  cers now receive infor-
mation on stolen vehicles, individual arrest records and 
the like within minutes.
REPORTS, RECORDS AND DATABASES
Reports, records and databases at the local, state and 
 federal level assist in criminal investigations.
Local Resources An important information source 
is the records and reports of your police department, 
including all preliminary reports, follow-up investigative 
reports, oﬀ ense and arrest records, modus operandi ﬁ les, 
ﬁ ngerprint ﬁ les, missing persons reports, gun registra-
tions and wanted bulletins. Closely examine a suspect’s 
prior record and modus operandi. Examine all laboratory 
and coroner’s reports associated with a case.
 
Also check records maintained by banks, loan and 
credit companies, delivery services, hospitals and clin-
ics, hotels and motels, newspapers, telephone books, city 
directories, street cross-directories, utility providers, per-
sonnel departments, pawnbrokers, storage companies, 
schools and taxi companies. Each time you locate a source 
whose records are helpful, add it to your sources-of-infor-
mation ﬁ le.
Auto Track Systems Auto Track systems can be 
helpful if businesses believe their inventory is shrink-
ing or they are losing tools and other equipment. Auto 
Track automatically generates reports on inventory and 
can capture transaction activity by department or other 
classiﬁ cations.
Caller ID Th e telephone number from which a call is 
placed can be recorded by a caller ID service, even if the 
call is not answered. Caller ID also provides the date and 

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 173
time of the call and can store numbers in its memory when 
more than one call is received.
 
In some criminal investigations, evidence has been 
obtained from telephones served by caller ID. For exam-
ple, a person who committed a burglary ﬁ rst called the 
business’s oﬃ  ce to see if anyone was there. Th e oﬃ  ce 
telephone recorded the number of the phone the burglar 
used, enabling the police to locate the suspect. Caller ID 
can be helpful in cases involving telephoned threats, kid-
nappings and the like.
Pen Registers Pen registers are electronic devices that 
record all numbers dialed from a speciﬁ c phone line. Th e 
term includes any device or program that performs func-
tions to the original pen registers. Title 18 of the U.S. Code 
deﬁ nes a pen register as
a device or process which records or decodes dialing, 
routing, addressing, or signaling information transmit-
ted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or 
electronic communication is transmitted, provided, 
however, that such information shall not include the 
contents of any communication, but such term does 
not include any device or process used by a provider or 
customer of a wire or electronic communication service 
for billing, or recording as an incident to billing, for 
communications services provided by such provider or 
any device or process used by a provider or customer 
of a wire communication service for cost accounting 
or other like purposes in the ordinary course of its 
business.
Th is expanded deﬁ nition was set forth in the USA 
PATRIOT Act.
Dialed Number Recorders (DNR) A dialed number 
recorder (DNR) can simultaneously monitor call activity 
on several lines and some have wiretapping capabilities. 
For each intercepted call, the DNR displays and prints a 
detailed call record. Once installed, the DNR is fully auto-
matic and requires minimal attention.
State Resources Investigators also use information from 
the state police, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the 
Department of Corrections and the Parole Commission.
Federal Resources Federal resources include the U.S. 
Post Oﬃ  ce; the Immigration and Naturalization Service; 
the Social Security Administration; the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
arms and Explosives (ATF); and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration.
 
Th e FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) 
contains online databases on wanted and missing persons; 
stolen guns, securities, articles, boats, license plates and 
vehicles; criminal histories; foreign fugitives and deported 
felons; gang and terrorist members; and persons subject 
to protection orders. Th e newest generation, NCIC 2000, 
includes mug shots (e.g., of sexual oﬀ enders and persons 
on probation or parole or incarcerated in federal prisons) 
and other personal identifying images, such as scars and 
tattoos; images of vehicles; an enhanced name search (of 
all derivatives of a name, e.g., Jeﬀ , Geoﬀ , Jeﬀ rey); auto-
mated single-ﬁ nger ﬁ ngerprint matching; and informa-
tion linking. Th ese provide the ability to associate logically 
related records across NCIC ﬁ les for the same criminal or 
the same crime. For example, an inquiry on a gun also 
could retrieve a wanted person or a stolen vehicle.
THE INTERNET
Th e Internet is an extremely valuable source of informa-
tion. Fast-breaking cases, such as a kidnapping, can be 
aided by an investigator’s ability to distribute photographs 
and important details eﬃ  ciently and quickly.
 
Another resource is the Web site of the International 
Association of Chiefs of Police, http://www.theiacp.org. 
Th e FBI’s Web site, http://www.fbi.gov, provides infor-
mation about major investigations, wanted felons, vari-
ous FBI programs and initiatives and ways to contact FBI 
agents regarding various crimes.
VICTIMS, COMPLAINANTS AND WITNESSES
 In addition to reports and records, databases and other 
Internet resources, investigators obtain information from 
people associated with the investigation. Vast amounts 
of information come from people with direct or indirect 
knowledge of a crime. Although no one is legally required 
to provide information to the police except personal iden-
tiﬁ cation and accident information, citizens are respon-
sible for cooperating with the police for their own and the 
community’s best interests. Everyone is a potential crime 
victim and a potential source of information. Interview 
anyone other than a suspect who has information about a 
case. Th is includes victims, complainants and witnesses.
 
A victim is a person injured by a crime. Frequently 
the victim is also the complainant and a witness. Victims 
are emotionally involved and may be experiencing anger, 
rage and fear. Such personal involvement can cause them 
to exaggerate or distort what occurred. Victims may 
also make a dying declaration that can provide valuable 
information to investigators. A dying declaration usu-
ally qualiﬁ es as a hearsay exception and is admissible as 
evidence.
 
A complainant is a person who requests that some 
action be taken. Th e complainant is especially important 
in the initial stages of a case. Listen carefully to all details 

174 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
The Knock and Talk Another technique to obtain infor-
mation from others is the “knock and talk.” As Scarry (2007, 
p.62) explains, “‘Knock and talk’ is a legitimate investigative 
technique that occurs at the home of a suspect or an indi-
vidual with information about an investigation. A number 
of courts recognize that knock and talks are consensual 
encounters that do not violate the Fourth Amendment.” In 
United States v. Crapser (2007), the Ninth District Court of 
Appeals set forth the general rule regarding knock-and-talk 
encounters that has become a ﬁ rmly rooted notion in Fourth 
Amendment jurisprudence (Scarry, p.64): “Absent express 
orders from the person in possession against any possible 
trespass, there is no rule of private or public conduct which 
makes it illegal per se, or a condemned invasion of the per-
son’s right of privacy, for anyone openly and peaceably, at 
high noon, to walk up the steps and knock on the front door 
of any man’s ‘castle’ with the honest intent of asking ques-
tions of the occupant thereof—whether the questioner be a 
pollster, a salesman, or an oﬃ  cer of the law.”
 
Scarry notes, “Police oﬃ  cers learn early on in their 
careers, they are permitted to brieﬂ y detain people as long 
as they can articulate the basis, or reasonable suspicion, 
for that detention.”
A Caution Be aware that suspect and witness state-
ments are not always reliable. A group of police oﬃ  cers 
attended a session on the reliability of witnesses’ memory 
and were given a memory recall test. Every oﬃ  cer failed 
the test. Witnesses are often more conﬁ dent in their 
knowledge of what happened than they are accurate. 
Many people see only a part of the commission of a crime 
but testify as though they witnessed the entire event.
INFORMANTS
An informant is anyone who can provide information 
about a case but who is not a complainant, witness, victim 
or suspect. Informants may be interested citizens or indi-
viduals with criminal records.
 
Informants are frequently given code names, and only 
the investigator knows their identity. In some instances, 
however, informants may not remain anonymous, and 
their identity might have to be revealed. Be extremely 
careful in using such contacts. Never make promises or 
deals you cannot legally fulﬁ ll. Many jurisdictions have 
policies regarding the use of juveniles as informants, spec-
ifying a certain minimum age for informants or requiring 
police to ﬁ rst get permission from a court, parental or 
legal guardian.
Confidential Informants Of importance to investi-
gators is the conﬁ dential informant or CI, described as “a 
person formally registered with and compensated by the 
and determine the extent of the investigative problems 
involved: the type of crime, who committed it, what wit-
nesses were present, the severity of any injuries and any 
leads. Th ank the complainant for contributing to the 
investigation.
 
A witness is a person who saw a crime or some part of 
it being committed. Good eyewitnesses are often the best 
source of information in a criminal investigation. Record 
the information a witness gives, including any details that 
can identify and locate a suspect or place the suspect at 
the crime scene. Although not always reliable, eyewit-
nesses’ testimony remains a vital asset in investigating 
and prosecuting cases.
 
Sometimes a diligent search is needed to ﬁ nd wit-
nesses. Th ey may not want to get involved, or they may 
withhold information or provide it for ulterior motives. 
Make every eﬀ ort to locate all witnesses. Check with the 
victim’s friends and associates. Make public appeals for 
information on radio, television and the Internet. An 
informational checkpoint might also be used, as described 
in Chapter 4. Check the entire crime scene area. Conduct a 
neighborhood canvass to determine whether anyone saw 
or heard anything when the crime occurred.
The Neighborhood Canvass Often the best way to 
solve a crime is to go door to door in the area around the 
crime scene. Nyberg (2006, p.36) says,
Th ere’s a sign mounted on the walls of our homicide 
oﬃ  ce with wooden letters that read GOYAKOD. Th at’s 
not some Russian obscenity. It’s a piece of advice on 
how to close cases. We would sit sometimes during 
meetings about our current cases, brainstorming ideas 
to generate leads. More often than not, someone would 
nod, smile, and say GOYAKOD, which stands for “Get 
oﬀ  your ass and knock on doors.” If any one phrase 
exempliﬁ es what good police work is, that’s it.
 
In a major criminal investigation, getting oﬀ  your 
ass and knocking on some doors is essential. In fact, 
it is a crucial element in the early stages of working 
an unsolved case. Th e area canvass—knocking on the 
doors of all the residences surrounding the entire crime 
scene—in one of the ﬁ rst tasks a lead detective should 
have on his lead sheet.
 
Monheim (2007, pp.48–49) stresses, “It is irrefutable 
that neighborhood canvasses solve criminal cases. Count-
less cases have been solved by a single item of information 
gleaned during a well-done area canvass. Seasoned inves-
tigators are well aware of the value of a conscientiously 
performed canvass; however, detectives new to the inves-
tigative process often ignore their importance. With the 
advent of more sophisticated and alluring scientiﬁ c meth-
ods of processing the crime scene, the area canvass has, 
sadly, become a lost art.”

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 175
when the tip predicts future activities that the oﬃ  cer is 
able to corroborate, which makes it reasonable to think 
that the informant has inside knowledge about the 
suspect.”
Possible Dangers Faced by Informants Griﬃ  th (2007,
p.12) notes, “Th e prison code of ‘No Snitching’ rules the 
streets, and society has to do something about it.” He gives 
as an example a 38-year-old Phoenix woman who had the 
word “snitch” burned into her face from ear to mouth 
after she reportedly informed police about a domestic vio-
lence incident that resulted in her attackers’ child being 
removed from their home.
 
One controversial Web site, whosarat.com, bills itself 
as the largest online database of informants and agents 
and exposes witnesses cooperating with the government, 
much to the displeasure of the federal government: “Fed-
eral prosecutors are furious, and the Justice Department 
has begun urging the federal courts to make fundamen-
tal changes in public access to court ﬁ les. Th e site also 
discloses the identity of people engaged in undercover 
operations and those whose information is being used to 
build a case. Prosecutors say the Web site endangers the 
lives of informants and undercover agents and compro-
mises investigations. However, most legal experts agree 
that whosarat.com is protected by the First Amendment” 
(Liptak, 2007).
SUSPECTS
A suspect is a person considered to be directly or indirectly 
connected with a crime, either by overt act or by planning 
or directing it.
 
Do not overlook the suspect as a chief source of 
information. An individual can become a suspect either 
through information provided by citizens or by his or her 
own actions. Any suspicious individuals should be ques-
tioned. Complete a ﬁ eld-interview card for any suspicious 
person you stop. Th is card places a person or vehicle in 
a speciﬁ c place at a speciﬁ c time and furnishes data for 
future investigative needs. A sample ﬁ eld-interview card 
is shown in Figure 6.1.
 
A person with a known modus operandi ﬁ tting a 
crime may be spotted at or near the crime scene. Th e per-
son may be wanted for another crime or show an exagger-
ated concern for the police’s presence, or the person may 
be in an illegal place at an illegal time—often the case with 
juveniles.
 
When questioning occurs spontaneously on the street 
(referred to as a ﬁ eld interview), it is especially advanta-
geous to oﬃ  cers to question someone suspected of involve-
ment in a crime right after the crime has occurred.
department for supplying information or performing 
a service, such as a controlled purchase of drugs. Com-
pensation may take the form of money and/or a reduced 
sentence for criminal behavior” (Jetmore, 2007a, p.22). 
Investigators’ skill in recruiting, maintaining and moti-
vating CIs to supply information can greatly enhance their 
eﬀ ectiveness in solving cases: “Th ere is still no substitute 
for gathering information from the street. A police oﬃ  -
cer’s ability to develop a case by using sources of informa-
tion from people engaged in criminal behavior or living on 
the fringes of society is the bread and butter of detective 
work” (Jetmore).
 
Feuer and Baker (2008) call CIs a detective’s best 
friend: “Th ey act as eyes and ears. Th ey serve as secret tip-
sters. Th ey take the police, by proxy, to the dangerous and 
privileged places where badges cannot go.” CIs are usually 
recruited and managed in secret, making it hard to deter-
mine how many there are (Feuer and Baker). Th e FBI is 
said to maintain more than 15,000 secret informants; the 
Drug Enforcement Administration has about 4,000 at any 
one time.
 
 Remsberg (2006, p.50) points out, “In neighborhoods 
where the police are viewed as an occupying force, you’ll 
have to work hard to build trust. No one wants to help out 
an enemy. . . . You have to come across as the good guy 
who wants to help out.” Th e golden rule about develop-
ing informants is that sincerity is everything (Remsberg, 
p.46). Building trust is also key in developing informants: 
“You have to develop a degree of reciprocal trust based on 
the ﬂ imsiest of foundations, which is no small feat. And 
just as you will establish a credibility baseline for your 
informant, he will doubtedlessly have some very valid 
concerns about you” (Scoville, 2007a, p.24).
Establishing Reliability Th e following steps are rec-
ommended to help investigators achieve the totality 
of circumstances necessary to establish probable cause 
(Jetmore, 2007b, p.24):
 1. Corroborate as much of the informant’s information 
as possible.
 2. Determine how, where, when and under what circum-
stances the informant obtained the information.
 3. Explain (without citing speciﬁ c cases and names) use 
of the informants’ information in past criminal cases 
that led to arrests, convictions, seizures, and so on.
 4. Provide or reveal statements informants made.
 5. Identify the informant if it’s safe to do so.
 
Criteria for determining the reliability of infor-
mants’ information were discussed in Chapter 4. Th e 
Court ruled in Alabama v. White (1990), “An anonymous 
tip can provide the foundation for reasonable suspicion 

176 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
information from them, a process commonly referred to 
as either an interview or an interrogation.
 
An interview is questioning people who are not sus-
pects in a crime but who know something about it or the 
people involved. An interrogation is questioning those 
suspected of direct or indirect involvement in a crime.
The ultimate goal of interviewing and interrogating 
is to determine the truth, that is, to identify those 
responsible for a crime and to eliminate the innocent 
from suspicion.
 
Investigators must obtain all the facts supporting the 
truth, whether they indicate a person’s guilt or innocence. 
Th e best information either proves the elements of the 
crime (the corpus delicti) or provides leads.
 
Sometimes direct questioning of suspects is not the 
best way to obtain information. In cases in which direct 
contact would tip oﬀ  the person, it is often better to use 
undercover or surveillance oﬃ  cers or various types of lis-
tening devices, as discussed in Chapter 7.
INTERVIEWING AND 
INTERROGATING
Information is obtained continuously through-
out an investigation. Some is volunteered, and 
some the police oﬃ  cer must really work for; some is use-
ful and some worthless or even misleading. Most of an 
oﬃ  cer’s time is spent meeting people and obtaining

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 177
• • Conﬁ dent and optimistic. Do not assume that because 
the person you are questioning is a hardened criminal, 
has an attorney, is belligerent or is better educated 
than you that no opportunity exists to obtain informa-
tion. Show that you are in command, that you already 
know many answers and that you want to corroborate 
what you know. If the conversation shifts away from 
the subject, steer the discussion back to the topic.
• • Objective. Maintain your perspective on what is 
sought, avoiding preconceived ideas about the case. 
Be aware of any personal prejudices that can interfere 
with your questioning.
• • Sensitive to individual rights. Maintain a balance 
between the rights of others and those of society. Nat-
urally, suspects do not want to give information that 
conﬂ icts with their self-interests or threatens their 
freedom. Moreover, many citizens want to stay out of 
other people’s business. Use reason and patience to 
overcome this resistance to becoming involved.
• • Knowledgeable of the elements of the crime. Know what 
information you need to prove the elements of the 
crime you are investigating. Phrase questions to elicit 
information related to these elements.
ENHANCING COMMUNICATION
Successful questioning requires two-way communica-
tion between the investigator and the person being ques-
tioned. Th ere are several ways to improve communication, 
whether in interviewing or interrogating.
CHARACTERISTICS OF AN EFFECTIVE 
INTERVIEWER/INTERROGATOR
Many of the emotional and intellectual traits of an inves-
tigator (discussed in Chapter 1) are especially valuable 
in communicating with others. Presenting a favorable 
appearance and personality and establishing rapport are 
more important than physical attributes. Sometimes, 
however, it is an advantage to be of the same race or gen-
der as the person being questioned. Under some circum-
stances, it is better not to wear a uniform. Sometimes a 
suit or jeans and a sweater are more appropriate.
An effective interviewer/interrogator is adaptable and 
culturally adroit, self-controlled, patient, conﬁ dent, 
optimistic, objective, sensitive to individual rights and 
knowledgeable about the elements of crimes.
• • Adaptable and culturally adroit. Your cultural and 
educational background and experience aﬀ ect your 
ability to understand people from all walks of life, 
to meet them on their own level on varied subjects 
and to adapt to their personalities, backgrounds and 
lifestyles.
• • Self-controlled and patient. Use self-control and 
patience to motivate people to talk. Be understanding 
yet detached, waiting for responses while patiently 
leading the conversation and probing for facts. 
Remain professional, recognizing that some people 
you interview may feel hostile toward you.
Building trust with citizens, 
including children, is important for 
law enforcement. The ability to 
communicate with individuals from 
diverse populations—various ages, 
ethnicities, socioeconomic groups, 
and so forth—is a critical skill for 
effective investigators.

178 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Language barriers might be minimized or eliminated by 
seeking a mix of bilingual oﬃ  cers in hiring, training oﬃ  -
cers in conversational foreign languages and matching 
oﬃ  cers to appropriate beats and assignments.
 
One of the most common techniques used to help oﬃ  -
cers communicate with non-English-speaking people is the 
Point Talk Law Enforcement Translator, in which an oﬃ  cer 
locates the appropriate language either in a handbook or on 
a computer screen and then points to appropriate phrases 
to ask speciﬁ c questions or elicit desired responses.
 
Additional barriers to communication exist with indi-
viduals who are hearing impaired, who have Alzheimer’s 
disease or who are mentally retarded. It is highly recom-
mended that oﬃ  cers learn sign language to help them 
communicate with the hearing impaired. Th is skill also 
allows oﬃ  cers to communicate silently among themselves 
when confronting suspects. In addition, it can be a univer-
sal means of recognition for undercover oﬃ  cers from dif-
ferent agencies or from large agencies where oﬃ  cers often 
do not know each other.
EFFECTIVE QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES
Most cases are solved through eﬀ ective questioning tech-
niques. Investigators use questions and repetition eﬀ ec-
tively and know how to question reluctant subjects. No 
matter which technique or combination of techniques you 
select, you should follow two key requirements:
Two basic requirements to obtain information are to 
listen and to observe.
 
How people act during questioning can tell as much as 
or more than their words. Signs of unusual nervousness, 
odd expressions, rapid breathing, visible perspiration or 
a highly agitated state are cause to question the person’s 
truthfulness. Table 6.1 summarizes the guidelines for a 
successful questioning.
Direct Versus Indirect Questions A subtle but impor-
tant diﬀ erence exists between direct and indirect ques-
tions. A direct question is to the point, allowing little 
possibility of misinterpretation—for example, “What 
time did you and your husband leave the restaurant?” In 
contrast, an indirect question is disguised. For example, 
a question such as, “How do you and your husband get 
along?” could elicit a variety of answers.
Ask direct questions, that is, questions that come right 
to the point. Use indirect questions—those that skirt the 
basic questions—sparingly.
To improve communication: Prepare in advance, obtain 
the information as soon after the incident as possible, 
be considerate and friendly, use a private setting, elimi-
nate physical barriers, sit rather than stand, encourage 
conversation, ask simple questions one at a time, listen 
and observe.
Emotional Barriers to Communication People often 
have reasons for not wanting to answer questions that 
police ask. Even though these reasons may have no logical 
basis, be aware of the common barriers to communication.
Emotional barriers to communication include ingrained 
attitudes and prejudices, fear, anger or hostility and 
 self-preservation.
  
One important barrier to communication between 
police and the public is the ingrained attitude that tell-
ing the truth to the police is wrong. Th e criminal element, 
those closely associated with crime and even the police 
commonly use such terms as ﬁ nk and snitch, which imply 
that giving information to the police is wrong, unsavory 
or illegal.
 
Prejudices concerning a person’s race, beliefs, reli-
gion, appearance, amount of education, economic status 
or place of upbringing can be barriers to communication. 
You may encounter prejudice because you are a police oﬃ  -
cer or because of your race, physical appearance or reli-
gious beliefs. Equally important, prejudices you hold can 
interfere with your communicating with some people and 
therefore with your investigation.
 
Fear is another barrier to communication. Some wit-
nesses fear that criminals will harm them or their family 
if they testify, or they fear the imposition on their time 
and the negative impact on their wages of having to go to 
court to testify.
 
People actually involved in a crime can be reluctant 
to talk for many reasons, the most important of which 
is self-preservation. Although suspects naturally do not 
want to implicate themselves, other factors may also 
cause them to not answer questions. Severe guilt feelings 
can preclude telling anyone about a crime. Fear of conse-
quences can be so great that nothing will induce them to 
tell the truth. Th ey may fear that if they are sent to prison 
they will be sexually assaulted or beaten, or they may fear 
that any accomplices they implicate will seek revenge.
Other Barriers to Communication As ethnic diversity 
increases and other languages proliferate, language barri-
ers become an increasing challenge to law enforcement. 

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 179
Taping and Videotaping Interviews and Interroga-
tions Anand (2008, p.60) notes, “Tired of the debate 
over who said what, many agencies use new digital tech-
nology to record all interviews of suspects, victims and 
witnesses.” Collins (2006, p.10) suggests, “Police inter-
rogations, especially those that produce incriminating 
evidence or even a confession, may need to be recorded 
in order to withstand increased judicial or legislative 
scrutiny in the coming years. “Courts in Alaska and 
Minnesota have mandated recording all interrogations 
through use of the exclusionary rule. Critics of manda-
tory recording policies voice concern that such tech-
niques might deter confessions and cause some people 
to refuse to speak freely. Interestingly, a similar concern 
was voiced when Miranda was decided. Yet, people con-
tinue to volunteer information despite being given a 
Miranda warning.
 
Some agencies are videotaping interviews and confes-
sions rather than simply recording them. More than half 
of all police agencies nationwide videotape at least some 
portion of investigative interviews and interrogations 
(Spahr, 2006, p.1). Beneﬁ ts of such videotaping include 
(Spahr, p.4)
• • Th e reduced need for copious note taking and 
increased focus on suspect dialogue and mannerism.
• • Greater accuracy in documenting suspect’s 
statements.
 
Th e axiom that the shortest distance between two 
points is a straight line is generally true in obtaining 
information. Knowing the elements of the crime you are 
investigating lets you select pertinent questions.
Repetition 
Anyone who watches detective shows has 
heard victims or suspects complain, “I’ve already told 
my story to the police.” This is true to life. Individuals 
are asked to tell and retell their version of what hap-
pened and for very good reasons. Someone who is lying 
will usually tell a story exactly the same way several 
times. A truthful story, however, will contain the same 
facts but be phrased differently each time it is retold. 
After a person has told you what happened, guide the 
discussion to some other aspect of the case. Later, 
come back to the topic and ask the person to repeat 
the story.
Repetition is an effective technique to obtain recall and 
to uncover lies.
 
Often repeating what someone has told you helps the 
person provide additional information. Sometimes it also 
confuses the person being questioned, and if the original 
version was not true, another repetition will reveal this 
fact. If inconsistencies appear, go back over the informa-
tion and attempt to account for them.
TABLE 6.1 | Interview/Interrogation Guidelines
• • Ask one question at a time and keep your responses simple and direct.
• • Avoid questions that can be answered “yes” or “no“; a narrative account provides more information and may reveal 
inconsistencies in the person’s story.
• • Be positive in your approach, but let the person save face if necessary so that you may obtain further information.
• • Give the person time to answer. Do not be uncomfortable with pauses in the interview.
• • Listen to answers, but at the same time anticipate your next question.
• • Watch your body language and tone of voice.
• • Start the conversation on neutral territory.
• • Tape recorders can be frightening.
• • React to what you hear.
• • As you move into difﬁ cult territory, slow down.
• • Don’t rush to ﬁ ll silences.
• • Pose the toughest questions simply and directly.
• • No meltdowns. You must establish professional distance. Keep your role clear.

180 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
may be in a state of panic, frustration or anger. In the pres-
ence of such emotions, remain calm and detached, yet show 
empathy and understanding—a diﬃ  cult feat. After inter-
viewing witnesses, interview people who can furnish facts 
about what happened before or immediately after the crime 
or who have information about the suspect or the victim.
 
Not all people with relevant information are at the 
crime scene. Some people in the general area may have 
seen or heard something of value. Even people miles away 
from the scene may have information about the crime or 
the person committing it. Explain to such individuals why 
you are questioning them, check their identiﬁ cation and 
then proceed with your interview.
 
Th e main sources of immediate information away 
from the crime scene are neighbors, business associates, 
people in the general area such as motel and hotel per-
sonnel, and longtime residents. Longer-term contacts 
may include informants, missing witnesses, friends and 
relatives. Appeals for public cooperation and reports from 
various agencies and organizations may also produce 
information. Record both positive and negative informa-
tion. Th e fact that a witness did not see anyone enter a 
building may be as important as having seen someone.
ADVANCE PLANNING
Many interviews, at least initial ones, are conducted in 
the ﬁ eld and allow no time for planning. If time permits, 
plan carefully for interviews. Review reports about the 
case before questioning people. Learn as much as possible 
about the person you are going to question before you 
begin the interview.
SELECTING THE TIME AND PLACE
Sometimes there is no time to decide when and where to 
conduct an interview. Arriving at a crime scene, you may 
be confronted with a victim or witness who immediately 
begins to supply pertinent information. Recall that these 
res gestae statements are extremely valuable. Th erefore, 
record them as close to verbatim as possible.
 
Determine as soon as possible who the complainant 
is, where and how many witnesses exist and whether the 
suspect has been apprehended. If more than one oﬃ  cer 
is present, the oﬃ  cer in charge decides who will be ques-
tioned and assigns personnel to do it.
 
Immediate contact with people who have informa-
tion about a crime improves the chances of obtaining 
information. Although emotions may be running high, 
witnesses are usually best able to recall details immedi-
ately after an incident. Th ey are also less likely to embel-
lish or exaggerate their stories because others present can 
• • Increased transparency of detective behavior and line 
of questioning.
• • Use of the interview tapes for review and training.
 
In addition, showing a judge, defense attorney and 
jury a videotape of an interrogation alleviates any defense 
arguments about coercion, illegitimate handling of the 
suspect and lack of Miranda rights being read: “It [video-
taping] is a huge form of protection for law enforcement, 
proving that yes, the oﬃ  cer did follow the law, and yes, 
the confession was not coerced” (Mills-Senn, 2006, p.57). 
Laws vary from state to state about whether suspects 
must consent to being recorded.
THE INTERVIEW
Interviewing involves talking to people, ques-
tioning them, obtaining information and read-
ing between the lines. Th e main sources of information at 
the crime scene are the complainant, the victim and wit-
nesses. (Th ese may be the same person.) Separate the wit-
nesses and then obtain a complete account of the incident 
from each one.
Interview witnesses separately if possible. Interview the 
victim or complainant ﬁ rst, then eyewitnesses and then 
people who did not actually see the crime but who have 
relevant information.
 
Finding, detaining and separating witnesses are high 
priorities. Witnesses who are not immediately detained 
can drift oﬀ  into the crowd or decide not to become 
involved. Obtain the information as rapidly as possible. 
Identify all witnesses and check their names and addresses 
against their identiﬁ cation. Ask witnesses not to speak to 
one another or to compare stories until they have written 
down in their own words what happened.
 
If there are many witnesses, discuss the incident 
brieﬂ y with each. Th en establish a priority for obtaining 
statements based on the witnesses’ availability and the 
importance of their information.
 
In most cases, interview complainants ﬁ rst, because 
they can often provide enough information to determine 
whether a crime has been committed and, if so, what type 
of crime. If department policy requires it, have complain-
ants read and initial or sign the information you record 
during the interview.
 
Anyone who saw what happened, how it happened or 
who made it happen is interviewed next. Such witnesses 

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 181
not condone criminal behavior and will assist you. How-
ever, they often do not know what is important to a spe-
ciﬁ c investigation. Provide every opportunity to establish 
rapport and to assist citizens in providing information.
 
Not everyone with information can provide it easily. 
People who are emotionally unstable or mentally deﬁ cient, 
have temporary loss of memory or fear the police often 
cannot or will not be forthcoming. With them, estab-
lishing rapport is critical. If a person is deaf or speaks a 
foreign language, arrange for an interpreter. If a person 
appears unwilling to talk, ﬁ nd out why.
 
Give reluctant witnesses conﬁ dence by demonstrat-
ing self-assurance. Give indiﬀ erent witnesses a sense of 
importance by explaining how the information will help 
a victim. Remind them that someday they may be victims 
themselves and would then want others to cooperate. 
Find a way to motivate every witness to talk with you and 
answer your questions.
 
Careful listening enhances rapport. Do not indicate 
verbally or nonverbally that you consider a matter trivial 
or unimportant; people will sense if you are merely going 
through the motions. Take a personal interest. Discuss 
their family, their work or their hobbies. Be empathetic 
and assure them that everything possible will be done but 
that you need their help.
NETWORKING AN INTERVIEW
Most people are familiar with the concept of a business or 
professional network—a body of personal contacts that 
be asked to verify the information. Moreover, witnesses 
can be separated so they will have no opportunity to com-
pare information. Finally, the reluctance to give the police 
information is usually not so strong immediately after a 
crime. Given time to reﬂ ect, witnesses may fear that they 
will have to testify in court, that cooperation will take 
them away from work and cost them ﬁ nancially or that 
the criminal will retaliate.
BEGINNING THE INTERVIEW
How an interview is started is extremely important. At 
this point, the interviewee and the interviewer size each 
other up. Mistakes in beginning the interview can estab-
lish insurmountable barriers. Make your initial contact 
friendly but professional. Begin by identifying yourself 
and showing your credentials. Th en ask a general question 
about the person’s knowledge of the crime.
ESTABLISHING RAPPORT
Rapport is probably the most critical factor in any inter-
view. Rapport is an understanding between individuals 
created by genuine interest and concern. It requires empa-
thy. Empathy means accurately perceiving and responding 
to another person’s thoughts and feelings. Th is diﬀ ers 
from sympathy, which is an involuntary emotion of feel-
ing sorry for another person.
 
People who are approached civilly may volunteer a 
surprising amount of useful information. Most people do 
Some interviews are conducted
under difﬁ cult circumstances, when 
victims or witnesses have suffered 
trauma or are under duress. Obtaining 
statements from domestic violence 
victims can be particularly challenging. 
In such situations, what interview 
techniques should the investigator
use so that useful information can be 
drawn out while remaining sensitive 
to the needs of the interviewee?

182 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
 
Among the drawbacks of this method are the amount 
of time it takes and the need for a controlled environment. 
Nonetheless, the cognitive interview is especially eﬀ ective 
for obtaining information from victims and  witnesses 
who have diﬃ  culty remembering an event.
AVOIDING CONTAMINATING THE INTERVIEW
When investigators impede or negatively inﬂ uence an 
interview, this is like contaminating a crime scene and can 
be equally devastating to successful resolution of a case. 
Table 6.2 provides guidelines for avoiding interview con-
tamination. Th e questioning process is a complex skill that 
can be visualized as a funnel, as illustrated in Figure 6.2.
 
A recent development in interviewing individuals 
with knowledge of a crime has changed the timing of 
questioning in some situations, that is, those dealing with 
testimonial hearsay.
Testimonial Hearsay Testimonial hearsay includes 
prior testimony as well as statements made as a result 
of police interrogation. Witness statements obtained 
through such “structured questioning” are inadmissible 
in a criminal trial unless the witness is unavailable to tes-
tify and was previously cross-examined by the defendant 
(Crawford v. Washington, 2004).
 
Police reports should diﬀ erentiate between state-
ments that resulted from structured questioning and 
those that did not. Oﬃ  cers should listen well, take good 
notes and make it clear in the notes and report that they 
did not direct or extract the speciﬁ c information. If an 
interview yields substantial information related to a case, 
a statement should be obtained.
can further one’s career. In reality, networks can extend 
much farther than this.
 
Networks also establish relationships between people 
and between people and their beliefs. Networks produce a 
context in which to understand a person. Th ese networks 
may be social, ethnic, cultural, business, professional/
occupational, religious or political. As American society 
becomes more diverse, oﬃ  cers will have to understand 
the networks in their jurisdictions.
Reluctant Interviewees Most people who are reluc-
tant to be questioned respond to one of two approaches: 
logical or emotional.
Appeal to a reluctant interviewee’s reason or emotions.
 
Th e logical approach is based on reason. Use logic to 
determine why the person refuses to cooperate. Explain 
the problems that result when people who know about a 
crime do not cooperate with investigators.
 
Th e emotional approach addresses such negative feel-
ings as hate, anger, greed, revenge, pride and jealousy. 
You can increase these emotions or simply acknowledge 
them (e.g., “Anyone in your situation would respond the 
same way”). If such tactics do not work, warn the person 
of the serious consequences of withholding important 
information.
 
Whether to select a logical or an emotional approach 
depends on the person being interviewed, the type of 
investigation and your personal preference.
The Cognitive Interview Interview style has impor-
tant implications for how much information is received 
from subjects. Th e cognitive interview tries to get the 
interviewee to recall the scene mentally by using simple 
mnemonic techniques aimed at encouraging focused 
retrieval. Th ese techniques include allowing interviewees 
to do most of the talking, asking open-ended questions, 
allowing ample time for answers, avoiding interruptions, 
and encouraging the person to report all details, no mat-
ter how trivial.
 
Th e cognitive interview method calls for using a 
secluded, quiet place free of distractions and encourag-
ing a subject to speak slowly. Th e interviewer ﬁ rst helps 
the interviewee reconstruct the circumstances by asking, 
“How did you feel . . . ?” Have the interviewee describe 
the weather, the surroundings, objects, people and 
smells. Interviewees are encouraged to report everything, 
even if they think something is unimportant. Th ey might 
also be asked to relate the events in a diﬀ erent order or to 
change perspectives. What would another person present 
have seen?

A combination of questions and answers, with the 
answers in narrative form, is often the most effective 
format. However, a question and answer format is 
often challenged in court on grounds that questions 
guide and control the response. Another alternative is 
for you to write down the words of the person and have 
the person read and sign your notes. Also record the 
ending time.
 
Beginning and ending times may be of great value in 
court testimony.
CLOSING THE INTERVIEW
End each interview by thanking the person for cooperat-
ing. If you have established good rapport with the inter-
viewee, that person will probably cooperate with you later 
if needed.
STATEMENTS
A statement is a legal narrative description of events 
related to a crime. It is a formal, detailed account. It begins 
with an introduction that gives the place, time, date and 
names of the people conducting and present at an inter-
view. Th e name, address, and age of the person questioned 
are stated before the main body of the statement. Figure 
6.3 shows a sample statement.
 
Th e body of the statement is the person’s account of 
the incident. A clause at the end states that the informa-
tion was given voluntarily. Th e person making the state-
ment reads each page, makes any needed corrections, 
initials each correction and then signs the statement.
 
Obtain statements in private, with no one other than 
police oﬃ  cers present, and allow no interruptions. How-
ever, other people will need to be called in to witness the 
signing of the statement.
 
Statements can be taken in several ways: prepared in 
longhand by the person interviewed, dictated to a typist

THE INTERROGATION
Questioning suspects is usually more diﬃ  cult 
than questioning witnesses or victims. Once 
identiﬁ ed and located, a person who is involved in a crime 
may make a statement, admission or confession that, cor-
roborated by independent evidence, can produce a guilty 
plea or obtain a conviction.
 
Many procedures used in interviewing are also used 
in interrogating, but you should note some important dif-
ferences in how you question suspects. One of the most 
critical is ensuring that you do not violate suspects’ con-
stitutional rights, so that the information you obtain will 
be admissible in court. It is imperative that oﬃ  cers distin-
guish between questioning in a Terry-type stop/detention 
situation and a custodial situation requiring giving the 
Miranda warning.

THE MIRANDA WARNING
Before interrogating any suspect in custody, you must 
give the Miranda warning, as stipulated in Miranda v. 
Arizona (1966). In this decision, the Supreme Court ruled 
that suspects must be informed of their right to remain 
silent, to have an attorney present and to have a state-
appointed attorney if they cannot aﬀ ord private counsel. 
Suspects must also be warned that anything they say may 
be used against them in court. Many oﬃ  cers read suspects 
their rights from a card (Figure 6.4).
The Miranda warning informs suspects of their Fifth 
Amendment rights. Give the Miranda warning to every 
suspect you interrogate while in custody.
 
Th e Fifth Amendment states, “No person shall be 
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against 

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 185
defendant’s constitutional rights (Wong Sun v. United 
States, 1963). Th at same consequence does not follow 
from a failure to follow the Miranda procedures. If oﬃ  -
cers learn about contraband or evidence from a statement 
that does not comply with Miranda, the contraband or evi-
dence need not be suppressed as “poisonous fruit” of the 
inadmissible statement (United States v. Patane, 2004).
 
Th e Miranda warning does not have to be given in 
the exact form described in Miranda. In fact, a Florida 
count found that law enforcement agencies had 89 diﬀ er-
ent versions of the warning. It is recommended that law 
enforcement oﬃ  cers consult with local prosecutors to 
ensure compliance with local court decisions (Rutledge, 
2006b, p.93).
When Miranda Does Not Apply Th e Miranda warning 
has never applied to voluntary or unsolicited, spontane-
ous statements, admissions or confessions. Someone can 
approach a police oﬃ  cer and say, “I want to confess that 
I killed Mark Jones. I took a gun from my car and shot 
him.” If this remark was unsolicited and completely vol-
untary, the police oﬃ  cer is under no obligation to inter-
rupt the person giving the confession. In one instance, a 
person telephoned the police long-distance to voluntarily 
confess to a felony.
 
Miranda warnings are not required during identiﬁ ca-
tion procedures such as ﬁ ngerprinting, taking voice or 
handwriting exemplars or conducting a lineup or sobri-
ety tests. Th ey are not required during routine booking 
questions, during brief on-the-scene questioning or dur-
ing brief, investigatory questioning during a temporary 
himself.” Th e Miranda decision established that this right 
must be made known to suspects in custody before any 
questioning can occur.
 
Th ousands of words have been written for and against 
this decision. Th e general interpretation and application 
of the Miranda decision is that once you have reasonable 
grounds to believe a person has committed a crime, that 
person’s constitutional rights are in jeopardy unless the 
Miranda warning is given before any questioning.
 
Many court cases illustrate the gray area that exists 
in determining when to give the warning. Th e terms most 
often used to describe when it should be given are in 
 custody or custodial arrest. In custody generally refers 
to a point at which an oﬃ  cer has decided a suspect is 
not free to leave, there has been considerable deprivation 
of liberty or the oﬃ  cer has arrested the suspect.
 
In Oregon v. Mathiason (1977), the Supreme Court 
deﬁ ned custodial interrogation as questioning initi-
ated by law enforcement oﬃ  cers after a person has been 
taken into custody or otherwise signiﬁ cantly deprived 
of freedom. If a suspect chooses to remain silent, ask no 
further questions. If the suspect requests counsel, ask no 
more questions until counsel is present.
 
Th e Miranda custody standard is no diﬀ erent for juve-
niles. In Yarborough v. Alvarado (2004), the Supreme Court 
held that a trial court need not consider age in determining 
whether a “reasonable person” is in custody for Miranda 
purposes.
 
Another Miranda-related concern, the fruit-of-the-
poisonous-tree doctrine (Chapter 4), makes inadmissible 
any evidence obtained through an earlier violation of the 
Peace Officers
Constitutional Pre-Interrogation Requirements
The following warnings must be given prior to questioning a person who is in custody or
is deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way:
THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES I INFORM YOU THAT:
1.  YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
2.  ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN COURT.
3.  YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TALK TO A LAWYER NOW AND HAVE HIM
     PRESENT NOW OR AT ANY TIME DURING QUESTIONING.
4.  IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD A LAWYER, ONE WILL BE APPOINTED FOR YOU
     WITHOUT COST.
Waiver of Rights
The suspect may waive his rights, but the burden is on the officer to show the waiver is made
voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.
He must affirmatively respond to the following questions:
1.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND EACH OF THESE RIGHTS I HAVE EXPLAINED TO YOU?
2.  DO YOU WISH TO TALK TO US AT THIS TIME?
Election of Rights
A subject can avail himself of his rights at any time and interrogation must then cease.
If a subject will not waive his rights or during questioning elects to assert his rights, no
testimony of that fact may ever be used against him at trial.
FIGURE 6.4
Miranda warning.

186 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
  
Silence, in itself, is not a waiver. Th e suspect must 
articulate a waiver of rights. Th erefore, many oﬃ  cers read 
the Miranda warning aloud from a printed card and then 
have the suspect read and sign the card (see Figure 6.5). 
Th e date and time are also recorded. If no card is available, 
a summary of the Miranda warning can be written, read 
and signed. Police have the legal burden of proving that the 
suspect did waive his or her rights. Th e suspect retains the 
right to stop answering questions at any point, even when 
he or she originally waived the right to remain silent.
 
According to the Davis rule, as established in Davis 
v. United States (1994), “Where it is not necessarily clear 
that a suspect who has already waived his rights is asking 
for an attorney, the court declined to place the burden of 
detention such as a Terry stop. A Miranda warning is also 
not required during roadside questioning following a rou-
tine traﬃ  c stop or other minor violation for which cus-
tody is not ordinarily imposed. Miranda warnings are not 
required by probation oﬃ  cers questioning those on pro-
bation for whom they are responsible. Finally, a warning 
is not required during questioning by a private citizen who 
is not an agent of the government.
Waiving the Rights A suspect can waive the rights 
granted by Miranda but must do so intelligently and know-
ingly. A waiver, that is a giving up of a right, is accom-
panied by a written or witnessed oral statement that the 
waiver was voluntary (Figure 6.5).

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 187
suspect in custody states that he or she wants an attor-
ney, police must halt all questioning and may not engage 
in further questioning unless the suspect requests it. Th e 
defendant in Edwards v. Arizona interrupted a statement 
and said to FBI agents, “Maybe I should get a lawyer” but 
then resumed his story without prompting. Th e Court 
ruled that neither the Fourth nor the Fifth Amendment 
prohibits agents from merely listening to a defendant’s 
voluntary statements and using them at a trial. Even if 
one inferred that the agents’ silence amounted to “subtle 
compulsion,” this would not necessarily vitiate the volun-
tariness of the defendant’s statements.
 
In 1984, Minnesota v. Murphy established that proba-
tion oﬃ  cers do not need to give the Miranda warning, and 
Berkemer v. McCarty ruled that the Miranda warning is not 
required for traﬃ  c violations.
 
Th e Supreme Court ruled in Illinois v. Perkins (1990) 
that jailed suspects need not be told of their right to 
remain silent when they provide information to under-
cover agents. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the 
intent of the Miranda decision was to ensure that police 
questioning of suspects in custody is not suﬃ  ciently 
coercive to make confessions involuntary. Suspects must 
be told of their rights not to incriminate themselves. 
Miranda was not meant to protect suspects who boast 
about their criminal activities to individuals they believe 
to be cellmates.
Miranda Challenged Th e Supreme Court’s ruling in 
Dickerson v. United States (2000) held that Miranda is a 
constitutional decision and therefore could not be over-
ruled by an act of Congress. In declining to strike down 
Miranda, the Court said it found no compelling reason to 
overrule a 34-year-old decision that “has become embed-
ded in routine police practice to the point where the warn-
ings have become part of our national culture.”
THE “QUESTION FIRST” OR “BEACHHEADING” 
TECHNIQUE
An interrogation technique commonly used in some 
departments is the “question ﬁ rst,” or beachheading, 
technique: An oﬃ  cer questions a custodial suspect with-
out giving the Miranda warnings and obtains incriminat-
ing statements; the oﬃ  cer then gives the warning, gets a 
waiver and repeats the interrogation to obtain the same 
statement. Th e thinking behind this technique is that 
even though the ﬁ rst statement would be suppressed, the 
second, waived statement would be admissible. However, 
in Missouri v. Seibert (2004) the Supreme Court found this 
technique unconstitutional: “It is likely that if the inter-
rogators employ the technique of withholding warnings 
until after interrogation succeeds in eliciting a confession, 
resolving the ambiguity on the police” (Rutledge, 2006a, 
p.70). In this case, the suspect, who had waived his 
Miranda rights, said about an hour and a half into the 
interrogation, “Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.” In Davis, 
the court ruled, “Th e suspect must unambiguously request 
counsel. He must articulate his desire to have counsel 
present suﬃ  ciently clearly that a reasonable police oﬃ  cer 
in the circumstances would understand the statement to 
be a request for an attorney.”
 
A suspect’s “Miranda history” is also important: “If a 
suspect responds to Miranda warnings by invoking either 
his right to silence or his right to counsel, he can always 
change his mind (without pressure from police) and 
reopen discussion” (Rutledge, 2007c, p.70). Following is a 
Miranda reinitiation checklist (Rutledge, p.71):
• • After a waiver, OK to question.
• • After suspect reinitates and waives, OK to question.
• • After invocation of silence on Case A, OK to seek later 
waiver and question.
• • After invocation of counsel, no police-initiated 
 questioning on any case during continuous custody.
 
Oﬃ  cers should not just state the suspect waived his 
rights; it is important they state which speciﬁ c rights were 
waived (Rutledge, 2007a, p.70). Th e Fifth Amendment 
requires that suspects not have to incriminate themselves; 
the Sixth Amendment requires that suspects be provided 
a lawyer. Th e Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies 
only to the speciﬁ c crime for which the person has been 
indicted or arraigned. Th is situation often occurs when 
detectives are investigating a cold case and want to ques-
tion suspects who are incarcerated on a diﬀ erent charge. 
Th e following is a checklist for reinitiation of questioning 
(Rutledge, p.71):
• • Prior waiver—reinitiation OK with warning and 
waiver.
• • Prior invocation of silence—initiation OK as to diﬀ er-
ent oﬀ ense with warning and waiver.
• • Prior invocation of counsel—no reinitiation as to any 
case during continuous custody.
The Effects of Miranda Th e Miranda warning does not 
prevent suspects from talking. It simply requires that sus-
pects be advised of and fully understand their constitu-
tional rights. Th e basic intent of the Miranda decision is 
to guarantee the rights of the accused. Th e practical eﬀ ect 
is to ensure that confessions are obtained without duress 
or coercion, thereby removing any inferences that third-
degree tactics were used.
 
Several Court decisions relate to the Miranda warn-
ing. Edwards v. Arizona (1981) established that once a 

188 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
the same defendant (Williams) but diﬀ erent prosecu-
tors. In the ﬁ rst trial, Brewer v. Williams (1977), the issue 
revolved around information solicited from Williams 
without his being Mirandized. An arrest warrant was 
issued in Des Moines, Iowa, for Williams, an escapee from 
a mental institution wanted for murdering a little girl on 
Christmas Eve. Williams turned himself in to police in 
Davenport, Iowa. Des Moines police went to Davenport to 
transport Williams back to Des Moines, with all agreeing 
that Williams was not to be questioned on the way. How-
ever, one detective, knowing Williams was a psychiatric 
patient who possessed a strong religious faith, told Wil-
liams that he wanted him to think about where the little 
girl was buried. He could perhaps show them where the 
body was on the way back because it was sleeting and they 
might not be able to ﬁ nd it in the morning. Th e oﬃ  cer 
told Williams that the little girl who was snatched away 
on Christmas Eve needed a Christian burial (the Christian 
Burial Speech). Williams complied and showed the oﬃ  cers 
where he had buried the girl.
 
As Harr and Hess (2008, p.195) note, “Although the 
lower courts admitted Williams’ damaging statements 
into evidence, the Supreme Court in Brewer v Williams 
aﬃ  rmed the court of appeals’ decision that any state-
ments made by Williams could not be admitted against 
him because the way they were elicited violated his con-
stitutional rights to counsel.” Th e Court granted Williams 
a new trial.
 
At the second trial, in Nix v. Williams (1984), the 
Court allowed the body of the little girl to be admitted into 
evidence because a search party had been approaching 
the location of the burial site and would have discovered 
the body without Williams’ help. Th is case established the 
inevitable-discovery doctrine discussed in Chapter 4.
Right to Counsel under the Fifth and Sixth Amend-
ments Th e Supreme Court concluded in Miranda that 
custodial interrogation creates an inherently coercive 
environment that violates the Fifth Amendment protec-
tion against compelled self-incrimination by requiring 
that suspects be told of their right to an attorney. Th e 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel, however, does not 
hinge on the issue of custody. Th e right to counsel under 
the Sixth Amendment does not apply until proceedings 
against a suspect have begun.
 
 Fellers v. United States (2004) illustrates the diﬀ erence 
between these two rights. Oﬃ  cers went to Fellers’ home 
to discuss his involvement in methamphetamine distribu-
tion. Th ey told him a grand jury had indicted him and four 
others and had a federal warrant for his arrest. Th e oﬃ  -
cers did not advise Fellers of his Miranda rights and asked 
him no questions, but Fellers told them he knew the four 
others and had used methamphetamine with them. Th e 
the warnings will be ineﬀ ective in preparing the suspect 
for successive interrogation, close in time and similar in 
content.”
THE INTERPLAY OF THE FOURTH AND FIFTH 
AMENDMENTS
Chapter 4 discussed how the Fourth Amendment restricts 
searches. Th is chapter discusses how the Fifth Amend-
ment restricts confessions. Often the two amendments 
become intertwined, as was seen in New York v. Quarles 
(1984), a case in which an exigent search resulted in a 
Fifth Amendment issue because of the statements elicited 
pursuant to the search. In Quarles, the Supreme Court 
ruled on the public safety exception to the Miranda 
warning requirement.
 
In 1980 two police oﬃ  cers were stopped by a young 
woman who told them she had been raped and gave 
them a description of her rapist, who, she stated, had 
just entered a nearby supermarket and was armed with a 
gun. Th e suspect, Benjamin Quarles, was located, and one 
oﬃ  cer ordered him to stop. Quarles ran, and the oﬃ  cer 
momentarily lost sight of him. When he was apprehended 
and frisked, he was wearing an empty shoulder holster. 
Th e oﬃ  cer asked Quarles where the gun was, and he nod-
ded toward some cartons and said, “Th e gun is over there.” 
Th e oﬃ  cer retrieved the gun, put Quarles under formal 
arrest and read him his rights. Quarles waived his rights 
to an attorney and answered questions.
 
At the trial, the court ruled pursuant to Miranda that 
the statement “Th e gun is over there” and the subsequent 
discovery of the gun as a result of that statement were 
inadmissible. After reviewing the case, the Supreme Court 
ruled that the procedural safeguards that both deter a sus-
pect from responding and increase the possibility of fewer 
convictions were deemed acceptable in Miranda to protect 
the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
However, if Miranda warnings had deterred the response 
to the oﬃ  cer’s question, the cost would have been more 
than just loss of evidence that might lead to a conviction. 
As long as the gun remained concealed in the store, it 
posed a danger to public safety.
 
Th e Court ruled that in this case the need to have 
the suspect talk (an exigent circumstance) took prece-
dence over the requirement that the defendant be read 
his rights. Th e Court ruled that the material factor in 
applying this “public safety” exception is whether a public 
threat could possibly be removed by the suspect making 
a statement. In this case, the oﬃ  cer asked the question 
only to ensure his and the public’s safety. He then gave 
the Miranda warning before continuing questioning.
 
Th e Fourth and Fifth Amendments also came into 
play in one case that was argued twice. Th e trials involved

is more readily established.
 
Opinions diﬀ er about how interrogation rooms should 
be furnished. An austere, sparsely furnished room is gen-
erally less distracting; pictures can reduce the eﬀ ective-
ness of questioning. Many interrogation rooms have only 
two chairs: one for the investigator and one for the sus-
pect. Some include a small, bare table. Some oﬃ  cers feel 
it is better not to have a desk or table between the oﬃ  cer 
and the suspect because the desk serves as a psychological 
protection to the suspect. Without it, the suspect tends 
to feel much more uncomfortable and vulnerable. Keep 
all notebooks, pencils, pens and any objects of evidence 
to be used in the interrogation out of view, preferably in 
a drawer, until the appropriate time. An austere setting 
develops and maintains the suspect’s absolute attention 
and allows total concentration on the conversation.
 
Other investigators, however, contend that such a 
setting is not conducive to good rapport. It may remind 
suspects of jail, and a fear of going to jail may keep them 
from talking. Instead, some investigators prefer a nor-
mally furnished room or oﬃ  ce for interrogations. Doctors, 
lawyers, insurance investigators and others have shown 
that a relaxed atmosphere encourages conversation. Even 
background music can reduce anxiety and dispel fear—
major steps in getting subjects to talk.
STARTING THE INTERROGATION
Conducting the interrogation at the police station allows 
many options in timing and approach. A suspect can be 
brought to the interrogation room and left alone tempo-
rarily. Often the suspect has not yet met the investigator 
and is apprehensive about what the investigator is like, 
what will be asked and what will happen. Provide time for 
the anxiety to increase, just as a football team sometimes 
takes a time-out before the opposing team attempts a 
critical ﬁ eld goal.
 
As you enter the room, show that you are in com-
mand, but do not display arrogance. Th e suspect is in an 
unfamiliar environment, is alone, does not know you, 
has been waiting, is apprehensive and does not know 
what you will ask. At this point, select your interrogation 
technique, deciding whether to increase or decrease the 
suspect’s anxiety. Some investigators accomplish their 
goals by friendliness, others by authoritarianism. Show 
your identiﬁ cation and introduce yourself to the suspect, 
state the purpose of the interrogation and then give the 
Miranda warning. Avoid violating the suspect’s personal 
zone. Try to stay 2 to 6 feet away when questioning.
oﬃ  cers transported Fellers to jail and advised him of his 
rights, which he waived. At trial, Fellers ﬁ led a motion to 
suppress all his statements, claiming they were obtained 
in violation of his rights. Th e Supreme Court ruled in favor 
of Fellers, emphasizing that the Sixth Amendment right 
to counsel diﬀ ers from the Fifth Amendment (Miranda) 
custodial-interrogation principle and applies even when 
the police do not question a defendant. Th e Court stated, 
“Th ere is no question that the oﬃ  cers in this case deliber-
ately elicited information from Fellers during the contact 
at his home.”
FOREIGN NATIONALS, THE VIENNA 
CONVENTION TREATY AND DIPLOMATIC 
IMMUNITY
 Partly because of concern that foreign nationals charged 
with crimes in the United States will not fully understand 
their rights within the complex U.S. legal system, the 
Vienna Convention Treaty, signed in 1963, gives foreign 
nationals the right to contact their consulate in the event 
of their detention or arrest. Another treaty signed in 1972 
provides diplomatic immunity for certain individuals. 
Oﬃ  cers who want to interrogate a person claiming diplo-
matic immunity should request the diplomatic identiﬁ ca-
tion and check the reverse of the card. A general guideline 
is to treat foreign nationals and diplomats as you would 
want Americans to be treated under similar circumstances 
abroad: “Compliance with treaties is not an option—it’s 
the law” (Rutledge, 2005, p.75).
SELECTING THE TIME AND PLACE
Like interviews, interrogations are conducted as soon as 
possible after a crime. Selecting the right place to question 
suspects is critical because they are usually reluctant to 
talk to police. Most interrogations are conducted at police 
headquarters. However, if a suspect refuses to come to the 
station and evidence is insuﬃ  cient for an arrest, the inter-
rogation may take place at the crime scene, in a squad car 
or at the suspect’s home or place of work. If possible, sus-
pects should be interrogated in an unfamiliar place, away 
from their friends and family.
Conduct interrogations in a place that is private and free 
from interruptions.
 
Ideal conditions exist at the police station, where pri-
vacy and interruptions can be controlled. Visible move-
ments or unusual noises distract a suspect undergoing 
questioning. Only the suspect, the suspect’s attorney 
and the interrogators should be in the room. Having two 

190 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
who cooperate. Also point out that family and friends 
are usually more understanding if people admit they are 
wrong and try to “go straight.”
 
If the suspect will not provide the names of accom-
plices because they are friends, explain that such “friends” 
have put the suspect in the present predicament.
APPROACHES TO INTERROGATION
As with interviews, interrogations can follow an emo-
tional or a logical approach. An emotional approach is 
either empathetic or authoritarian. After talking with 
the suspect, select the approach that seems to oﬀ er the 
best chance for obtaining information. Rapport has 
been stressed previously. Rationalization, projection and 
minimization are among techniques commonly used in 
interrogation.
Interrogation techniques include inquiring directly or 
indirectly, forcing responses, deﬂ ating or inﬂ ating the 
ego, minimizing or maximizing the crime, projecting the 
blame, rationalizing and combining approaches.
Inquiring Indirectly or Directly Indirect inquiry 
draws out information without mentioning the main sub-
ject. For example, an indirect approach may be phrased, 
“Have you ever been in the vicinity of Elm Street? Grove 
Street? the intersection of Elm and Grove?” In contrast, 
a direct question would be, “Did you break into the house 
on the corner of Elm and Grove Streets on December 
16th?”
Forcing Responses A forced response is elicited 
by asking a question that will implicate the suspect, 
regardless of the answer given. For example, the ques-
tion “What time did you arrive at the house?” implies 
that the suspect did arrive at the house at some time. 
Answering the question with a time forces the suspect 
to admit having been there. Of course, the suspect may 
simply state, “I never arrived there,” or may refuse to 
answer at all.
Deflating or Inflating the Ego Belittling a suspect is 
often eﬀ ective. For example, you may tell a suspect, “We 
know you couldn’t be directly involved in the burglary 
because you aren’t smart enough to pull oﬀ  a job like that. 
We thought you might know who did, though.” Question 
the suspect’s skill in committing a crime known to be his 
specialty. Suggest that the suspect’s reputation is suﬀ ering 
because his latest burglaries have been bungled. Th e suspect 
 
Do not become so wrapped up in yourself and your 
quest for information that you overlook body language 
or nonverbal communication that may indicate decep-
tion, anger or indiﬀ erence. Research has shown that 10 
percent of a message delivered is verbal and 90 percent is 
nonverbal. Oﬃ  cers who can correctly interpret what they 
see arm themselves with a powerful tool.
 
Deception, for example, may be indicated by look-
ing down, rolling the eyes upward, placing the hands 
over the eyes or mouth or rubbing the hands around the 
mouth. Other possible indicators of deception include 
continual licking of the lips, twitching of the lips, inter-
mittent coughs, rapid breathing, change in facial color, 
continuous swallowing, pulsating of the carotid artery 
in the neck, face ﬂ ushing, tapping the ﬁ ngers and avoid-
ing eye contact. Excessive protestations of innocence 
should also be suspect, for example, “I swear on my 
father’s grave.”
ESTABLISHING RAPPORT
As with interviewing, speciﬁ c approaches during inter-
rogating may either encourage cooperation or induce 
silence and noncooperation. Th e techniques for estab-
lishing rapport during an interview also apply in an 
interrogation. You may decide to instill the fear that 
there will be serious consequences if the suspect fails 
to cooperate. You may choose to appeal to the suspect’s 
conscience, emphasizing the importance of getting out 
of the present situation and starting over with a clean 
slate. Try any approach that shows the person that coop-
eration is more desirable than having you ﬁ nd out about 
the crime another way.
 
It also helps to know why the crime was committed. 
Some crimes are committed out of uncontrollable pas-
sion, panic or fear without consideration of the conse-
quences. Other crimes result from the demands of the 
moment; the presumed necessity of the crime appears 
to justify it. Some criminals’ guilt becomes so overpow-
ering that they turn themselves in to the police. Other 
criminals turn to drugs or alcohol or leave the area to 
start over somewhere else.
 
It takes skill to obtain information from those involved 
in crime, especially if they know the consequences can be 
severe. Suspects who understand there is no easy way out 
of a situation may become cooperative. At this point, oﬀ er-
ing alternatives may be successful. Because most people 
respond to hard evidence, show suspects the physical evi-
dence against them. Acknowledge to the suspect that there 
is no completely agreeable solution, but point out that 
some alternatives may be more agreeable than others.
 
Make no promises, but remind the suspect that the 
court decides the sentence and is apt to be easier on those 

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 191
water. Once the suspect has been made comfortable, begin 
by acknowledging that a problem exists but that before 
talking about it, the suspect needs to be informed of his 
rights. Th en suggest that the suspect probably already 
knows all about these rights, and ask the suspect to tell 
what he does know. Usually the suspect can paraphrase 
the Miranda warning, and you can then compliment him 
on his knowledge. Th is helps establish rapport. Next, 
encourage the suspect to tell his side of the story in detail, 
intervening only to give encouragement to continue talk-
ing. When the suspect has ﬁ nished, review the account 
step by step.
 
Following this, begin a “virtual monologue about 
robbery” and how some people’s desperate ﬁ nancial cir-
cumstances lead them into such a crime. Th e monologue 
describes how no one starts out planning a life of crime, 
but some, like an addict, fall into a criminal pattern that 
leads either to getting shot and killed or to spending a 
lifetime in prison. End the monologue by emphasizing 
that the inevitable result of this pattern of crime is life in 
prison or death.
 
Next, suggest that the suspect can avoid this fate 
only by breaking this pattern and that the ﬁ rst step is to 
admit that it exists. Add that a person’s life should not 
be judged by one mistake, nor should that person’s life 
be wasted by a refusal to admit that mistake. Following 
this monologue, begin to talk about the suspect’s accom-
plices and how they are still free, enjoying the fruits of 
the crime.
 
Finally, talk about the suspect’s previous encounters 
with the criminal justice system and how fairly it has 
treated the suspect. In the past, the suspect has prob-
ably always claimed to be not guilty. Judges are likely 
to go easier on suspects who indicate remorse for what 
they have done. Th is cannot happen unless the suspect 
ﬁ rst admits the crime. Point out that intelligent people 
recognize when it is in their best interest to admit a 
mistake.
Investigative Questionnaires An alternative to a 
face-to-face interrogation is the Crime Questionnaire, 
a document with 21 questions that test for truth and 
deception and can be used in conjunction with a poly-
graph or in situations where a polygraph cannot be used: 
“Whether a suspect is guilty or innocent, most will will-
ingly ﬁ ll out an investigative questionnaire instead of 
a polygraph exam” (Bassett, 2006, p.21). Supporters of 
this method believe the questionnaire shows “consider-
able accuracy” in predicting guilt or innocence, and one 
study found the questionnaire correctly predicted poly-
graph results 84.8 percent of the time (Bassett). Formal 
training, however, is required to interpret these ques-
tionnaires: “Language analysis principles are used to 
may attempt—out of pride—to prove that it was a profes-
sional job.
 
Th e same results can be obtained by inﬂ ating suspects’ 
egos, praising the skill shown in pulling oﬀ  the job. Sus-
pects may want to take the credit and admit their role in 
the crime.
Minimizing or Maximizing the Crime Concentrate 
your eﬀ orts on the crime itself, ignoring for the moment 
the person committing it. Instead of using the word 
crime, say “the thing that happened.” Refer to stolen 
property as “the stuﬀ  that was taken.” Do not use terms 
such as robbery, homicide or arson. Use other, less threat-
ening terms. For example, asking the suspect “to tell 
the truth” is much less threatening than asking some-
one “to confess.” Overstating the severity of an oﬀ ense 
can be as eﬀ ective as understating it. Mentioning that 
the amount of stolen money was $5,000 rather than the 
actual $500 puts the suspect on the spot. Is a partner 
holding out? Is the victim lying about the losses? Will 
the suspect be found guilty of a felony because of such 
lies? Making the oﬀ ense more serious than it actually is 
can induce suspects to provide facts implicating them in 
lesser oﬀ enses.
Projecting the Blame Projecting blame onto others is 
another eﬀ ective way to get suspects talking. When sus-
pects feel as if others are at fault, they may be more will-
ing to share information that will ultimately incriminate 
them. Th is is often seen in rape cases where the oﬃ  cer 
suggests that the woman “was asking for it” by the way 
she was dressed.
Rationalizing Rationalizing is another technique that 
shifts fault away from a suspect. Even though the suspect 
committed the act, there was a good reason to justify it. 
Skilled interrogators understand this psychology and con-
vey empathy by saying they understand where the suspect 
is “coming from.”
Combining Approaches Having the suspect tell the 
story using diﬀ erent methods can reveal discrepancies. If 
an oral statement has been given, have the suspect put 
this information in writing and compare the two versions. 
Th en give the story to two diﬀ erent investigators and have 
them compare the versions.
USING PERSUASION DURING INTERROGATION
Sometimes investigators may obtain much better results 
using persuasive techniques: making sure the suspect is 
comfortable and has basic needs taken care of, such as 
being allowed to go to the restroom and to get a drink of 

192 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
 
Several cases support officer use of deception. The 
Supreme Court stated in Sorrells v. United States (1932): 
“Criminal activity is such that stealth and strategy are 
necessary weapons in the arsenal of the police offi-
cer.” In United States v. Russell (1973), the Court said, 
“Nor will the mere fact of deceit defeat a prosecution, 
for there are circumstances when the use of deceit is 
the only practicable law enforcement technique avail-
able.“ United States ex rel. Caminito v. Murphy (1955) 
held that it is permissible to tell suspects that they 
have been identified by witnesses even though that is 
untrue. Moore v. Hopper (1974) allowed telling suspects 
that material evidence, such as a firearm used to com-
mit a crime, has been found, when it has not. Frazier v. 
Cupp (1969) held that it is permissible to tell suspects 
that an accomplice has already confessed, when this is 
untrue.
 
Interrogatory deception may include fabricating evi-
dence, making promises, misrepresenting the seriousness 
of the oﬀ ense, misrepresenting identity (for example, pre-
tending to be a cellmate or a reporter), or using the “good 
cop/bad cop” routine. Creating false evidence, however, is 
neither ethical nor legal.
 
Television and movies often depict the good-cop/
bad-cop method of interrogation, portraying one oﬃ  cer 
as very hostile and another one as trying to protect a sus-
pect from the hostile oﬃ  cer. Routines such as this could 
be considered illegal if carried to an extreme. Some inter-
rogation techniques, even if not illegal, may be unethical. 
Th e use of deception in interrogation and the determina-
tion of ethical, professional behavior remain important 
issues.
 
A letter from an inmate, incarcerated for a murder 
he pled guilty to but later claimed innocence for, sheds 
light on the reasons a suspect in jail awaiting trial might 
confess:
Jail can be hell. I was locked in a cell alone 23 hours a 
day. Th e other hour I was still alone, but able to take 
a shower, etc. Th e doors are solid steel. When it closes 
there is no more contact for another day. I used to 
dread the closing of that door. . . . Try and imagine 
sitting in a room the size of your bathroom with no 
window, not knowing when that door will open or 
what your family is doing outside it. Th en picture that 
for a year.
 
Th ey told me many times in many diﬀ erent ways 
how much better things would be if I cooperated with 
them. I don’t know if I did it hoping things would 
get better or if I just didn’t care. I do remember very 
clearly my feelings of being at the end of my rope. I 
would of sold my soul to the devil not to hear that 
door bang again, locking me in for another 23 hours 
with myself.
assess the truthfulness of ambiguous or unique answers 
not found in the database” (Bassett, p.31).
ETHICS AND THE USE OF DECEPTION
Although law enforcement oﬃ  cers are expected to be hon-
est, the Supreme Court has recognized that their duties 
may require limited oﬃ  cially sanctioned deception dur-
ing a criminal investigation (Mount, 2007, p.10). Rutledge 
(2007b, p.59) contends, “Sometimes you have to resort to 
trickery to get confessions from suspects.” Playing arrestees 
against each other can help elicit confessions: “For starters 
you may leave your arrestees cuﬀ ed in the cage in the back 
of your police car with a concealed tape recorder running 
in the front seat. If you walk away out of earshot, they may 
scramble to come up with a story” (Rutledge, 2008, p.61).
Technology Innovations
Phillips (2007, pp.112–117) describes virtual 
interrogation software that allows ofﬁ cers to ﬁ ne 
tune their interrogation skills on or off duty.
Traditional role-playing scenarios are now 
becoming a thing of the past, thanks to sophis-
ticated software technology allowing ofﬁ cers 
to train and practice interviewing techniques 
at their leisure. . . . SIMmersions’s simulated 
people technology is very real, and is used by 
law enforcement agencies worldwide to help 
train professionals how to recognize the signs of 
deception, and to be a better interviewer . . .
Using video and DVD capabilities, SIMmer-
sion has created more than 20 life-like simulations 
of people in realistic settings. These “simulated” 
characters have realistic emotions, and a “simu-
lated” brain that uses real-time interaction and 
logic to reﬂ ect the way people actually speak and 
respond to one another in real situations.
To keep the trainees’ interest, they are scored 
like a video game with scores based on judgment 
to determine whether the suspect is being truth-
ful or deceptive. Most of the scored points come 
from how rapport is developed and how accurately 
verbal and non-verbal clues are detected. Scores 
are tracked over time to measure and monitor 
how well the ofﬁ cer is improving. Scores are also 
visible to other ofﬁ cers, so it lends a competitive 
approach to learning.

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 193
I know who did.” If the suspect is not implicated in the 
crime but has relevant information, attempt to obtain 
a statement. If the suspect is implicated, try to obtain 
an admission or confession. Th e format for obtaining 
admissions and confessions from suspects in criminal 
cases is fairly standard. However, state laws, rules and 
procedures for taking admissions and confessions vary, 
so you need to know the rules and requirements of your 
jurisdiction.
 
An admission contains some information concern-
ing the elements of a crime but falls short of a full confes-
sion (Figure 6.6). A confession is information supporting 
the elements of a crime given by a person involved in 
committing it. It can be oral or written and must be vol-
untary and not given in response to threats, promises or 
rewards. It can be taken in question and answer form or 
in a narrative handwritten by the suspect or the interro-
gator (Figure 6.7).
A confession, oral or handwritten, must be given of the 
suspect’s free will and not in response to fear, threats, 
promises or rewards.
 
The voluntary nature of the confession is essential. 
For example, Ernesto Miranda had an arrest record and 
was familiar with his rights; yet, his confession was 
ruled inadmissible because these rights had not been 
clearly stated to him. Although formal education is 
not required for making a confession, a suspect must 
be intelligent enough to understand fully everything 
stated.
 
In most states, oral confessions are admissible in 
court, but written confessions usually carry more weight. 
Put an oral confession into writing as soon as possible, 
even if the suspect refuses to sign it. Have the suspect 
repeat the confession in the presence of other witnesses 
to corroborate its content and voluntariness. In extremely 
important cases, the prosecutor often obtains the con-
fession to ensure that it meets all legal requirements. 
Many departments are now videotaping statements and 
confessions.
 
After obtaining a confession, you may also go 
with the suspect to the crime scene and reenact the 
crime before witnesses. Take pictures or films of this 
reenactment. Go over the confession and the pictures 
with the suspect to verify their accuracy. (Such con-
fessions and reenactments can also be used for police 
training.)
 
Even though a confession is highly desirable, it may 
not be true, it may later be denied or there may be claims 
that it was involuntary.
 
To some observers, such treatment might border on 
third-degree tactics.
THIRD-DEGREE TACTICS
Considerable literature deals with the use of the third 
degree in police interrogations. It is not known how 
widely these methods are used and how much of what is 
claimed is exaggeration. Th ird degree is the use of phys-
ical force; the threat of force; or other physical, mental 
or psychological abuse to induce a suspect to confess to 
a crime. Th ird-degree tactics, which are illegal, include 
striking or hitting a suspect, denying food or water or 
sleep for abnormal time periods, not allowing a suspect 
to go to the restroom, having a number of oﬃ  cers ask 
questions in shifts for prolonged periods and refusing 
normal privileges. Obtaining information by these meth-
ods is inexcusable.
Third-degree tactics—physical force; threats of force; 
or other physical, mental or psychological abuse—
are illegal. Any information so obtained, including 
 confessions, is inadmissible in court.
 
Th e image of police brutality is diﬃ  cult to oﬀ set when 
third-degree tactics are used. Such tactics create a loss of 
respect for the oﬃ  cer involved and for the entire depart-
ment and the police profession.
 
Although physical force is not permitted, this does 
not rule out physical contact. Placing a hand on a shoulder 
or touching a suspect’s hand can help to establish rapport. 
Looking directly at a suspect while talking and continu-
ing to do so during the conversation is not using physical 
force, even though it usually makes the suspect extremely 
uncomfortable.
 
If you give a suspect all the privileges you yourself 
have within the interrogation context, there is no cause 
for a charge of third-degree tactics. Allow the suspect 
the same breaks for meals, rest and going to the rest-
room that you take. Law enforcement officers are obli-
gated to protect both the public interest and individual 
rights. No situation excuses a deliberate violation of 
these rights.
ADMISSIONS AND CONFESSIONS
When a suspect has become cooperative, you can increase 
the amount of conversation. Once rapport is established, 
listen for words indicating that the suspect is in some 
way connected with the crime, such as “I didn’t do it, but 

194 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
their joint trial (Rutledge, 2008, p.62). To avoid this situ-
ation, Rutledge (p.63) suggests that if two suspects have 
waived Miranda but only one has confessed, bring the 
two together and ask the confessor to repeat his confes-
sion implicating the other suspect. If the nonconfessing 
suspect does not deny the allegations made against him 
by the suspect who confessed, this can be considered an 
adoptive admission by the nonconfessor: “An adoptive 
admission occurs when someone else makes a state-
ment in a person’s presence and under circumstances 
where it would be logical to expect the person to make 
a denial if the statement falsely implicated him, but he 
does not deny the allegations.”
A confession is only one part of an investigation. 
 Corroborate it by independent evidence.
 
Your investigation will proceed in much the same way 
with or without a confession. However, a confession often 
provides additional leads. Although it cannot stand alone, 
it is an important part of the case.
 
According to the Bruton rule, which resulted from 
Bruton v. United States (1968), a defendant’s Sixth 
Amendment right to confront and cross-examine wit-
nesses against him is violated if a confessing defendant’s 
statement is used against a nonconfessing defendant at

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 195
 Obtain parental permission before questioning a youth. 
Do not use a youth as an informant unless the parents 
know the situation.
QUESTIONING CHILDREN AND 
JUVENILES
Special considerations exist when questioning 
children and juveniles. As in any interview, 
the ﬁ rst step is to build rapport. You might give the child 
a tour of the building and show him or her where the 
parent(s) will be waiting. Scoville (2007b, p.32) notes, 
“Investigators face formidable challenges when interview-
ing child victims, especially in sex crime cases.” He 
recommends establishing what words a child uses to refer 
to the private parts of the body.
 
Investigators must obtain parental permission before 
questioning a juvenile, unless the situation warrants 
immediate questioning at the scene. Parents usually permit 
their juveniles to be questioned separately if the purpose is 
explained and you have valid reasons for doing so. Overpro-
tective parents can distract and interfere with an interview 
or interrogation. Often, however, parents can assist if the 
youth is uncooperative. Th ey can ask questions and bring 
pressures to bear that you cannot. Th ey know and under-
stand the child and can probably sense when the child is 
lying. Decide whether to question a juvenile in front of the 
parents or separately after you determine their attitudes 
when you explain to them the reasons for the inquiry.

even though volunteered, is truthful. Corroborate or disprove 
statements made during questioning.
 
To cross-check a story, review the report and the 
details of the oﬀ ense. Determine the past record, family 
status, hobbies and special interests of those questioned. 
If a person has a criminal record, determine his or her 
prior modus operandi. With such information, you can 
ask questions in a way that indicates you know what 
you are talking about and that deceptive answers will be 
found out.
 
A person who resorts to half-truths or lies usually 
ends up on the defensive and becomes entangled in deceit. 
Knowing the facts of a case allows you to neutralize delib-
erate lies. If discrepancies in statements occur, question 
the suspect again or use polygraph or psychological tests. 
Compare the replies of people questioned and assess 
whether they are consistent with the known facts.
BREAKING A “PAT” STORY
A person who is telling the truth can usually repeat the 
story the same way many times, although he or she may 
use diﬀ erent words and a diﬀ erent sequence in retelling 
it. Times and dates may be approximate, and the person 
may simply not be able to remember some things. In con-
trast, a person who is telling a fabricated story can usu-
ally repeat it word for word innumerable times. Dates and 
times are usually precise, and all details are remembered. 
However, it is diﬃ  cult to repeat lies consistently; each one 
sounds better than the other, and the story becomes dis-
torted with mistakes and exaggerations. To break a pat 
story, ask questions that require slightly diﬀ erent answers 
and that will alter memorized responses.
 
Scientiﬁ c aids have also been developed to help deter-
mine the truthfulness of information provided during an 
investigation.
SCIENTIFIC AIDS TO 
OBTAINING AND EVALUATING 
INFORMATION
Many attempts have been made to determine the 
truth through scientiﬁ c instruments. Even 
before instruments were developed, however, trials by 
ordeal and other tests relied on psychological and physio-
logical principles. For example, it was common knowledge 
for centuries that when a person was lying or nervous, vis-
ible or measurable physiological changes occurred in the 
 
Your attitude toward youths will greatly inﬂ uence 
how well you can communicate with them. Ask yourself 
whether you consider the youth a person who has a prob-
lem or a youth who is a problem.
 
Many juveniles put on airs in front of their friends. 
For example, in one case, a juvenile and some other youths 
were brought into a room for observation by witnesses. 
Th e suspect youth knew he was being watched and chal-
lenged his school principal by stating that he had a right 
to know who was looking at him and why. Th is 10-year-old 
boy wanted to impress his friends. A few days later, the 
boy’s parents brought him to the police station at the oﬃ  -
cer’s request. It took two questions to determine that the 
boy had set a ﬁ re that resulted in an $80,000 loss. After a 
third question, the youth admitted his guilt. Although he 
had acted like a big shot in front of his friends, his action 
weighed heavily on his conscience. Th e presence of the 
police and the knowledge that his parents were waiting in 
another room motivated him to cooperate.
 
Finally, juveniles may have deﬁ nite opinions about 
the police. Some dislike adults in general and the police in 
particular. Like adults, however, most do not dislike the 
police and will cooperate with them. Put yourself in their 
shoes; learn their attitudes and the reasons for them. 
Time and patience are your greatest allies when question-
ing juveniles. Explain why you are questioning them, and 
you will probably gain their conﬁ dence.
 
Do not underrate young people’s intelligence or 
cleverness. Th ey are often excellent observers with good 
memories. Talk to them as you would to an adult. Praise 
them and impress upon them their importance to the 
investigation.
 
If a juvenile confesses to a crime, bring in the parents 
and have the youth repeat the confession to them. Th e 
parents will see that the information is voluntary and not 
the police’s account of what happened. Parents often pro-
vide additional information once they know the truth. For 
example, they may be alerted to stolen items at home and 
report them.
EVALUATING AND 
CORROBORATING 
INFORMATION
Do not accept information obtained from inter-
views and interrogations at face value. Verify all 
information. You cannot know the motives of all those who 
provide information. Do not assume that all information, 

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 197
examiner’s conclusion is accurate, because certain doubts 
and uncertainties plague even the best polygraph exams” 
(United States v. Scheﬀ er, 1998). Some authorities claim 
that the results violate hearsay rules because it is impos-
sible to cross-examine a machine.
The polygraph is an instrument used to verify the truth, 
not a substitute for investigating and questioning. 
 Although the results are not presently admissible in 
court, any confession obtained as a result of a polygraph 
test is admissible.
 
Th e polygraph is sometimes useful to develop leads, 
verify statements and cross-check information. More-
over, it provides the police with a psychological advantage 
that may lead to a confession. Such confessions are admis-
sible in court even though the test results are not. Even 
in jurisdictions in which the polygraph is not admissible 
in court, prosecuting attorneys often give weight to the 
ﬁ ndings of a polygraph examination in deciding whether 
to prosecute a case.
 
Th e normal procedure for setting up a polygraph test 
is for the police agency to request in writing that a poly-
graph test be conducted. Th e examiner reviews the com-
plete case, including any statements made by the subject 
before the test. A pretest interview with the subject covers 
the information to be included in the test, a review of the 
questions to be asked and an advisement of the suspect’s 
constitutional rights.
 
Th e polygraph examiner will need the following infor-
mation before the test:
• • Th e case facts—the precise criminal oﬀ ense involved, 
the complete case ﬁ le and a summary of the evidence
• • Information about the subject—complete name; date 
of birth; physical, mental, emotional and psychological 
data if known; and criminal history
 
Th e proper tests are then determined, and the ques-
tions prepared and reviewed with the subject. After the 
test is completed, the subject and the police are advised 
of the results in person or by letter. If the test indicates 
deception, an individual interrogation may follow. Any 
confessions that follow from such tests are almost uni-
versally accepted by the courts. Th e examiner’s testimony 
is not conclusive evidence but rather opinion evidence 
regarding either guilt or innocence.
 
Computerized polygraphy eliminates most of the 
mechanical equipment, replacing it with a virtual graph on 
a computer monitor. Th e graph can be printed, if desired. 
In computerized polygraph systems, the software analyzes 
body. Th ese include dryness of the mouth, shaking or 
trembling, perspiration, increased heartbeat, faster pulse 
and rapid breathing. Th e ancient Chinese capitalized on 
the symptom of mouth dryness when they made a suspect 
chew rice. If the rice remained dry after being chewed, the 
suspect was assumed to be lying.
 
Science and technology have provided aids to help 
determine the reliability of information. Among them 
are the polygraph, the computerized voice stress analyzer 
(CVSA), hypnosis and truth serums.
THE POLYGRAPH AND VOICE STRESS TESTS
As implied by the name, a polygraph (literally, “many 
writings”) records several measurements on a visible 
graph.
The polygraph scientiﬁ cally measures respiration and 
depth of breathing, changes in the skin’s electrical 
 resistance and blood pressure, and pulse.
 
Th e same factors measured by the polygraph may be 
visible to a trained observer through such signs as ﬂ ush-
ing of the face, licking the lips, slight pulsing of the neck 
arteries, beads of perspiration, rapid breathing and other 
signs of nervousness. A person does not actually have 
to respond verbally for a polygraph to work because the 
machine measures the mental and emotional responses 
regardless of whether the person answers questions.
 
Many law enforcement agencies use polygraphs in 
their investigations; however, the eﬀ ectiveness of the 
polygraph has been questioned. Among polygraph sup-
porters, opinions diﬀ er regarding its accuracy, which 
depends on the subject, the equipment and the opera-
tor’s training and experience. In some cases, the machine 
may fail to detect lies because the subject has taken drugs, 
makes deliberate muscular contractions or has a psycho-
pathic personality.
 
Th e subject must be physically, mentally and emo-
tionally ﬁ t for the examination. Th e examination must be 
voluntary and completed under conditions conducive to 
cooperation. A clear, concise summary of the test results 
is furnished only to authorized personnel.
 
Despite advances in technology, improved training 
of polygraph operators and claims of 95 percent accuracy, 
polygraph results are not now accepted by the courts. 
Th e Supreme Court has said, “Th ere is simply no consen-
sus that polygraph evidence is reliable. To this day, the 
scientiﬁ c community remains extremely polarized about 
the reliability of polygraph techniques. . . . Th ere is simply 
no way to know in a particular case whether a polygraph 

198 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
other standard investigative eﬀ orts have been exhausted. 
Because of the restricted criteria, these techniques are 
used in a comparatively small number of cases.
Hypnosis Hypnosis psychically induces a trancelike 
condition in which the person loses consciousness but 
responds to a hypnotist’s suggestions. Hypnosis is used 
with crime victims and witnesses to crimes, not with sus-
pects. It should be used only after careful consultation with 
the person to be hypnotized and after a detailed review of 
the case as well as of the subject’s mental, physical and 
emotional condition. Written consent from the subject 
and permission from the prosecutor’s oﬃ  ce should be 
obtained, and an attorney should be present.
 
A professional should carefully analyze the subject 
and the case before hypnosis is conducted. Th e actual act 
of hypnotism and interrogation should be performed only 
by a psychiatrist, psychologist or physician speciﬁ cally 
trained in the techniques.
 
Courts have established guidelines for using testi-
mony gained from hypnosis. Th e guidelines require that a 
trained professional perform it and that the professional 
be independent of, rather than responsible to, the prose-
cution. Th e number of people present should be restricted 
to the hypnotist and the coordinator from the police 
agency who has knowledge of the case and perhaps an art-
ist who can draw a sketch based on any descriptions of 
suspects. And although forensic hypnosis has ﬁ nally been 
accepted as a valuable crime-ﬁ ghting tool, many states 
remain reluctant to allow testimony elicited from hypno-
sis into court.
 
Th e session should be videotaped, if possible. Ques-
tions should relate only to what the witness states under 
hypnosis. Th e witness should not be prompted or induced 
in any way.
Truth Serums Truth serums are fast-acting barbitu-
rates of the type used to produce sleep at the approximate 
level of surgical anesthesia. Alcohol produces somewhat 
the same eﬀ ects to a much lesser degree. Th e theory is 
that the drug removes a person’s inhibitions so that he 
or she is more likely to tell the truth. In the past, scopol-
amine and hyascine were the most used drugs, but sodium 
amatol and sodium pentathol are more commonly used 
today.
 
Truth serums are not used extensively by the police 
because the accuracy of the information obtained with 
them is questionable. Truth serum is administered by 
a physician, preferably a psychiatrist, who remains to 
monitor the person’s condition while the questions are 
asked. Th e drugs can cause serious side eﬀ ects, so the 
subject must be monitored continually. Some patients 
also become violently excited. Moreover, individuals vary 
physiological changes and reports the probability that the 
person has answered the question truthfully.
 
Th e psychological stress evaluator (PSE), which mea-
sured stress in the micro-tremors of the human voice, was 
introduced in the 1970s. A more recent version of this 
technology is the CVSA. Voice stress tests have not, how-
ever, undergone peer-reviewed, independent research to 
show that they have accuracy. Although law enforcement 
departments throughout the country have invested mil-
lions of dollars in voice stress analysis (VSA), a study by 
the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) found that two of 
the most popular VSA programs used by agencies nation-
wide are “no better than ﬂ ipping a coin when it comes to 
detecting deception” (Damphouse, 2008, p.8).
 
Both the polygraph and the CVSA reduce investiga-
tive costs, focus on speciﬁ c suspects, increase conviction 
rates (because many tests are followed by confessions) 
and eliminate suspects. Police agencies should not go on 
“ﬁ shing expeditions,” however. Th rough normal investi-
gative practices, the number of suspects should be nar-
rowed to not more than two people before a polygraph 
examination or CVSA is used.
HYPNOSIS AND TRUTH SERUMS
Like the polygraph, hypnosis and truth serums are supple-
mentary tools to investigation. Th ey are not used as short-
cuts but rather in speciﬁ c cases where the criteria for their 
use have been determined by thorough review. Cases that 
meet these criteria are normally crimes of violence or cases 
where loss of memory or ability to recall is involved and all

CHAPTER 6 | Obtaining Information and Intelligence | 199
XML Data Model (GJSCM) was developed. Over the past 
several years, GJSCM has become “the national, de facto 
data sharing standard” (Wagner, 2007, p.114). Other 
advances in technology have also enhanced data sharing 
eﬀ orts.
 
Haslip (2007, p.32) states, “Th e public rightly expects 
that criminal justice agencies and especially law enforce-
ment agencies at all levels of government will cooperate 
and share information seamlessly.” Many departments 
are already sharing information by contributing to the 
National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP) 
developed by the International Association of Chiefs of 
Police and the U.S. Department of Justice after Septem-
ber 11, 2001 (Matney, 2007, p.28).
 
One such information sharing eﬀ ort is the OneDOJ 
Initiative, a storefront for federal law enforcement infor-
mation (Hitch, 2007, p.26). Th e OneDOJ Initiative allows 
state, local and tribal law enforcement partners to obtain 
greatly in their response to truth serums. Some can with-
hold information even under the inﬂ uence of a large dose 
of the serum.
 
Th e courts do not oﬃ  cially recognize truth serums 
or their reliability, nor do they admit the results as 
evidence.
USE OF PSYCHICS AND 
PROFILERS
Television shows have popularized the use of 
psychics and proﬁ lers in criminal investiga-
tions, and to many viewers, the incidents depicted are 
entirely believable. Although use of psychics in criminal 
investigations is controversial, some agencies are willing 
to consider any possible lead or source of information, 
including psychics.
 
Proﬁ lers are more commonly accepted. Proﬁ ling com-
bines art and science, resting on the premise that careful 
analysis of the crime scene and the crime will yield clues 
about the type of person who would commit such a crime. 
Eﬀ ective proﬁ ling relies on the proﬁ ler’s ability to com-
bine investigative experience, training in forensic and 
behavioral sciences and information about the character-
istics of known oﬀ enders.
SHARING INFORMATION
In the beginning of this chapter, the vast 
amount of information available on the Inter-
net was discussed. Th e Internet allows information related 
to criminal investigations to be shared across jurisdic-
tional lines as never before. Since September 11, 2001, the 
sharing of information has become increasingly impor-
tant as the United States focuses on homeland security: 
“Th e key to combating terrorism lies with the local police 
and the intelligence they can provide to federal authori-
ties” (Hess and Wrobleski, 2006, p.298). Th e role of police 
in the “war on terrorism” is discussed in Chapter 20.
 
“Substantial obstacles” that prevent police agencies 
from sharing information include competing local sys-
tems, incompatible data formats, issues of who controls 
the data, security questions, cost and training time and 
resources (Miller, 2008, p.54). To overcome the obstacle 
of incompatible data formats and enable federal, state 
and local justice and public safety agencies to exchange 
data in a common, replicable format, the Global Justice 
Collaboration between law enforcement agencies is often required 
for the successful investigation of a crime. Here an ATF and an FBI 
agent look at a nail found outside of a nightclub that was bombed 
the previous night. The explosion injured ﬁ ve people. A second bomb 
was found by police and was detonated at the site.

information from all the department’s investigative 
 components—the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the U.S. Marshals 
Service; and the Bureau of Prisons—with a single query.
 
Another initiative is the Law Enforcement National 
Data Exchange (N-DEx), being developed by the Raytheon 
Corporation after being selected in February 2007 from a 
competitive bid process. Th is Internet-based information 
system, illustrated in Figure 6.8, will eventually link the 
more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the nation 
electronically: “Th e system is not limited to law enforce-
ment information, but is truly a ‘criminal justice’ infor-
mation system, which will eventually include probation 
and parole data as well as law enforcement incident and 
case reports” (“FBI Begins to Implement a System,” 2008, 
pp.3–5).
 
Bush (2008, p.12) notes, “Th e vision of the N-DEx is 
clear: to share complete, accurate, timely and useful infor-
mation across jurisdictional boundaries and to provide 
new investigative tools that will enhance the ability of 
the United States to ﬁ ght crime and terrorism.” He also 
says, “Th e deployment of the N-DEx is generating excite-
ment within the law enforcement community because it 
is the ﬁ rst time in U.S. history that local, county, state 
and federal information will be openly shared.” O’Harrow 
and Nakashima (2008, p.A01) report, “Federal authorities 
Technology Innovations
Siuru (2007, p.79) describes CrimeCog, an inno-
vative information system technology:
Popular interactive Web sites such as MySpace.
com and Wikipedia.org let anyone with Internet 
access add and retrieve information on the Web
site. CrimeCog is a similar Internet-based infor-
mation sharing and records management concept, 
but only for law enforcement and justice system 
use.
CrimeCog is powered by E*Justice™, . . . 
already used by large cities and counties across 
America . . .CrimeCog’s user-friendly Web browser 
can manage all types of police reports, court 
records, case histories and information about pris-
oners in jails and prisons. It even works with exist-
ing victim notiﬁ cation systems.
CrimeCog users enter data one time to share 
with other agencies, eliminating time-wasting and 
error-prone keying. It also allows a single service 
to handle all information about a crime from the 
ﬁ rst report through arrest, preliminary incarcera-
tion, prosecution, sentencing and parole.

hope N-DEx will become what one called a ‘one-stop shop,’ 
enabling federal law enforcement, counterterrorism and 
intelligence analysts to automatically examine the enor-
mous caches of local and state records for the ﬁ rst time.” 
Page (2007, p.98) quotes Wormeli of the integrated Jus-
tice Information Systems Institute, who is equally enthu-
siastic: “With respect to using technology to solve crimes, 
N-DEx is the biggest revolution in policing since NCIC was 
originally created.”
 
Marshall (2006, p.40) notes, “All participants in the 
planning process agree that N-DEx is being built to sup-
port law enforcement investigations and that it is being 
built on the foundation of local law enforcement records 
systems.”
 
N-DEx is not an intelligence system and will not con-
tain intelligence data, although the information will be 
valuable to the intelligence community (Marshall, 2006).
INFORMATION VERSUS 
INTELLIGENCE
Information is simply data: “In order for infor-
mation to be useful, there must be some value 
attached to it. . . . Information without connectivity to an 
intelligence problem is merely white noise that tends to 
overwhelm the analysts who are supposed to make sense 
Technology Innovations
Careless (2006, pp.68–72) notes that even the 
best intelligence is of little use if it can’t be shared 
and analyzed with other police ofﬁ cers and agencies 
capable of adding pieces to the puzzle. Intel is also 
of little use if ofﬁ cers can’t ﬁ nd it when a case goes 
to court or years later when comparing a current 
crime to a past occurrence. He says Memex rem-
edies such problems:
Memex has been designed to ﬁ le intelligence 
information in a uniform, logical, and easy-to-com-
pare fashion. Also, the ﬁ les generated by Memex 
are designed to automatically meet key criteria so 
that the information within is properly recorded 
and veriﬁ able.
For instance, every time a new ﬁ le is opened, 
Memex requires the user to rank the reliability 
of his intel source. . . . Once an intel ﬁ le has been 
created, Memex’s Intelligence Report Wizard auto-
matically suggests what kind of additional ﬁ les the 
reporting ofﬁ cer may wish to create.
Memex’s Link Management tool records how 
certain tips are linked to each other, how strong 
the links are, and what actions have been taken to 
date in investigating them. Having the intel mapped 
out makes it easy to grasp “the big picture.” Not 
only are the relationships between data shown, but 
the actions that are being taken to follow them up 
are immediately apparent. . . .
Add in Memex’s ability to automatically alert 
other users when new data is posted and to keep 
an eye on who is viewing what and the result is a 
sophisticated, ﬂ exible, and powerful intel collec-
tion/evaluation tool.

of the fragmented bits and pieces of information that they 
are receiving” (Zimmerman, 2006, p.48).
Information or data is not intelligence. Information plus 
analysis is intelligence.
 
Kanable (2006b, p.14) explains, “Law enforcement 
agencies are great at collecting information (in investi-
gative ﬁ les, in criminal information databases, in their 
brains), but that’s not helping produce intelligence upon 
which decisions need to be made.” An “Intelligence Tool-
box” training program is oﬀ ered through Michigan State

and intelligence, maximize resources, streamline opera-
tions, and improve the ability to ﬁ ght crime and terrorism 
by merging data from a variety of sources. . . . In addition, 
fusion centers are a conduit for implementing portions of 
the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan.”
 
Advances such as these have led to intelligence-led 
policing: “Leading police associations in the United States 
and the United Kingdom have advocated that law enforce-
ment adopt an intelligence-led policing model (ILP). Th e 
model builds on community policing, problem solving and 
continuous improvement business models that have been 
adopted by police departments” (McGarrell, Freilich and 
Chermak, 2007, p.142). Intelligence-led policing is in the 
same situation community policing was 15 to 20 years 
ago, being endorsed by the key law enforcement profes-
sional organizations, but still a fairly nebulous concept 
(McGarrell et al., p.154).
University as a quick-start program to help state, local 
and tribal law enforcement agencies understand the intel-
ligence process contained in the National Criminal Intel-
ligence Sharing Plan (NCISP), which involves planning 
and direction (what to collect), collection, processing/col-
lation, analysis, dissemination and feedback or re-evalua-
tion. Th is process is illustrated in Figure 6.9.
 
Modaﬀ eri (2007,p.28) also notes, “Information has 
become so voluminous, those of us in law enforcement 
agencies may not be aware of what we already have. Sim-
ply put, we do not know what we know. Once we apply 
analytical skills to the relevant and credible information 
we collect, we create useful intelligence. Once dissemi-
nated, this intelligence can be used eﬀ ectively for both 
tactical and strategic purposes.”
 
Kanable (2006a, p.48) suggests, “A fusion center is an 
eﬀ ective and eﬃ  cient mechanism to exchange information

confessions, is inadmissible in court. Any confession, oral 
or handwritten, must be given of the suspect’s free will 
and not in response to fear, threats, promises or rewards. 
A confession is only one part of the investigation. It must 
be corroborated by independent evidence.
 
Special considerations are also observed when ques-
tioning children and youths. Obtain parental permission 
before questioning a juvenile. Do not use a juvenile as an 
informant unless the parents know the situation.
 
In addition to skills in interviewing and interrogating, 
you can sometimes use scientiﬁ c aids to obtain information 
and determine its truthfulness. Th e polygraph scientiﬁ -
cally measures respiration and depth of breathing, changes 
in the skin’s electrical resistance and blood pressure and 
pulse rate. It is an instrument used to verify the truth, not a 
substitute for investigating and questioning. Although the 
results are not presently admissible in court, any confes-
sion obtained as a result of a polygraph test is admissible. 
Other scientiﬁ c aids include hypnosis and truth serums, 
but such aids must be monitored closely, and the results 
are seldom admissible in court. Information or data is not 
intelligence. Information plus analysis is intelligence.
Obtaining Information
• • Were the complainant, witnesses, victim and infor-
mants questioned?
• • Were all witnesses found?
• • Was all information recorded accurately?
• • Was the questioning conducted in an appropriate 
place? at an appropriate time?
• • Was the Miranda warning given to all suspects before 
questioning?
• • Were the type of oﬀ ense and oﬀ ender consid-
ered in selecting the interviewing or interrogating 
techniques?
• • Were answers obtained to the questions of who, what, 
where, when, why and how?
• • Were checks made of all available reports and records? 
the sources-of-information ﬁ le? ﬁ eld-identiﬁ cation 
cards? the National Crime Information Center? other 
police agencies? public and private agencies at the 
local, county, state and national levels?
• • Were conﬁ dential informants sought?
• • Was a request for public assistance or an oﬀ er of a 
reward published?
• • Is there a private number to call or a private post 
oﬃ  ce box to write to for persons who have informa-
tion about a crime?
• • Was a polygraph used to check the validity of informa-
tion given?
CHECKLIST
Most solved cases rely on both physical evidence and 
information obtained from a variety of sources. Impor-
tant sources of information include (1) reports, records 
and databases, including those found on the Internet, (2) 
people who are not suspects in the crime but who know 
something about the crime or those involved; and (3) 
suspects in the crime. A sources-of-information ﬁ le con-
tains the name and location of people, organizations and 
records that may assist in a criminal investigation.
 
Th e ultimate goal of interviewing and interrogating is 
to determine the truth, that is, to identify those respon-
sible for a crime and to eliminate the innocent from sus-
picion. Th e eﬀ ective interviewer/interrogator is adaptable 
and culturally adroit, self-controlled, patient, conﬁ dent, 
optimistic, objective, sensitive to individual rights and 
knowledgeable about the elements of the crime.
 
Regardless of whether you are interviewing or inter-
rogating, there are several ways to improve communica-
tion: Prepare in advance and obtain the information as 
soon after the incident as possible, be considerate and 
friendly, use a private setting and eliminate physical 
barriers, sit rather than stand, encourage conversation, 
ask simple questions one at a time, listen and observe. 
Emotional barriers to communication include ingrained 
attitudes and prejudices, fear, anger or hostility, and self-
preservation.
 
Two basic requirements to obtain information are to 
listen and to observe. Ask direct questions that come right 
to the point. Use indirect questions—those that skirt the 
basic question—sparingly. Repetition is the best way to 
obtain recall and to uncover lies. Appeal to a reluctant 
interviewee’s reason or emotions.
 
Interview anyone other than a suspect who has 
information about the case. Th is includes complainants, 
witnesses, victims and informants. Interview witnesses 
separately if possible. Interview the victim or complainant 
ﬁ rst, then eyewitnesses and then those who did not actu-
ally see the crime but who have relevant information.
 
Although many of the same principles apply to inter-
rogating and interviewing, interrogating involves some 
special considerations. One important consideration is 
when to give the Miranda warning, which informs sus-
pects of their rights and must be given to any suspect 
who is interrogated while in custody. It is also impor-

he classic question in detective stories is “Who-
dunit?” Th is question is also critical in criminal 
investigations. In some cases, the suspect is obvious. How-
ever, in most cases, there is no suspect initially. Although 
many crimes are witnessed, victims and witnesses may 
not recognize or be able to describe the suspect. Further, 
many crimes are not witnessed.
Factors crucial to resolving criminal investigations are 
called solvability factors. Th ese are factors you should 
consider when deciding whether to investigate a crime. 
Among the most important are the existence of one or 
more witnesses and whether a suspect can be named or at 
least described and located.
Even if a suspect is known or has confessed, you must 
prove the elements of the crime and establish evidence 
connecting the suspect with the criminal act. Some cases 
require that suspects be developed, located, identiﬁ ed 
and then arrested. Others begin with an arrest and pro-
ceed to identiﬁ cation. No set sequence exists. Regardless 
of whether an arrest begins or ends an investigation, the 
arrest must be legal.
T
IDENTIFYING SUSPECTS 
AT THE SCENE
f a suspect is at the scene, you can use the 
per son’s driver’s license, mobile identiﬁ cation 
technology or ﬁ eld or show-up identiﬁ cation.
IDENTIFICATION BY DRIVER’S LICENSE
Technology has advanced by leaps and bounds since that 
ﬁ rst driver’s license was issued more than 100 years ago. 
As an unfortunate consequence, today’s driver’s licenses 
and their rightful owners have fallen victim to theft, forg-
ery and counterfeiting. According to multiple reports, all 
nineteen of the September 11, 2001, hijackers had used 
valid driver’s licenses to pass through airport security. By 
some accounts, these 19 men held as many as 63 driver’s 
licenses between them. In an eﬀ ort to make driver’s licenses 
more secure, the government passed the REAL ID Act, 
which requires states to take new steps to verify the iden-
tity of applicants before issuing drivers’ licenses and other 
ID cards. By December 31, 2009, state agencies will have 
to verify and authenticate birth certiﬁ cates, Social Secu-
rity cards, and other source documents that individuals 
use to obtain driver’s licenses. REAL ID security require-
ments also will make these drivers’ licenses and other 
IDs tamper-resistant and harder to forge. In its Notice 
of Proposed Rule Making, the Department of Homeland 
Security makes clear its commitment to privacy (Improv-
ing Security and Protecting Privacy through REAL ID, 2007): 
“DHS believes that protecting the privacy of the personal 
information associated with implementation of the REAL 
ID Act is crucial to maintaining the public trust that 
 government can provide basic services to its citizens while 
preserving their privacy. DHS recognizes the signiﬁ cant 
privacy issues that are associated with the act.”
Hsu (2008a, p.A03) notes, “DHS revised its ID plan 
after states and civil libertarians criticized draft regula-
tions, issued last March and setting a 2013 deadline, as 
unworkable and threatening to Americans’ privacy by cre-
ating a de facto national ID for 245 million U.S. drivers. 
Seventeen states have passed legislation opposing or opt-
ing out of the program.” Hsu (2008b, p.A05) also observes, 
“Over the past three years, DHS has struggled to fulﬁ ll the 
counterterrorism mandate set by Congress in 2006 to pro-
duce the new licenses by May 2008. As DHS’s timetable 
has slipped, resistance to the plan has grown across the 
country.” Stay tuned.
Asking to see a suspect’s driver’s license is routine. 
However, often suspects do not carry identiﬁ cation or, 
if they do, it may be fake. Investigators need to deter-
mine whether licenses are legitimate as well as whether 
they belong to those using them. One aid in determin-
ing authenticity of driver’s licenses is the Drivers License 
Guide, which contains information and graphics of more 
than 200 driver’s licenses, as well as other documents 
commonly used for identiﬁ cation. Keep a current copy of 
this publication on hand.
MOBILE IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
An important advance in law enforcement is the ability 
to receive information about suspects through oﬃ  cers’ 
laptop or in-car computers. Th e amount of time it takes 
to identify a suspect is directly correlated to the length of 
time it takes to solve a crime.

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 209
Facial recognition is but one type of biometric identi-
ﬁ cation being used in law enforcement.
BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION
“Biometric are systems that recognize a person through 
analysis of certain physiological or behavioral character-
istics” (Ashley, 2007b, p.80). According to Hanson (2007, 
p.84), “Th e features measured in biometric analysis may 
include facial geometry, palm vein pattern, ﬁ ngerprints, 
iris pattern, retina pattern, voice or speech prints and 
handwriting. Most of these features are well-established 
and are genetically determined, and all are distinctive for 
each person.” 
Facial recognition is being used in many states 
to compare a photograph of someone applying for a 
replacement or renewal license with prior images to be 
sure the applicant is the same person. Such a system 
could improve the millions of manual ID veriﬁ cations 
performed daily.
Applications of face recognition in law enforcement 
include searching large databases for the “bad guys,” the 
most wanted or suspects (the most common application); 
verifying travelers at border crossing; checking people 
against blacklists, such as shoplifters; performing remote 
surveillance; and analyzing collected surveillance video 
(Falk, 2007, p.37). Several challenges to facial recogni-
tion software include negative perceptions, tight budgets, 
image collection limitations and the fact that, unlike ﬁ n-
gerprints, the face is always changing (Langerman, 2008, 
p.64). Nonetheless, “Facial recognition technology has 
come a long way. Experts and designers believe it must 
become a mainstay of biometrics and law enforcement. 
Th e ability to identify a subject by face in the ﬁ eld is criti-
cal when a suspect refuses to cooperate or is dangerous” 
(Langerman, p.67).
FIELD IDENTIFICATION OR SHOW-UP 
IDENTIFICATION
If a suspect is apprehended while committing a crime, 
you can have witnesses identify the suspect. Th e same is 
generally true if the suspect is apprehended at or near the 
crime scene.
Technology Innovations
Reality Mobile’s Reality Vision is software that 
broadcasts video and images from connected ofﬁ -
cers in its system to decision makers at headquarters 
and to law enforcement team members instantly 
(Kozlowski, 2007, pp.126–127):
Reality Vision transmits an ofﬁ cer’s live video 
to headquarters and then back out to other team 
members in the ﬁ eld. Acting as an intelligence 
gathering tool, the software allows law enforce-
ment to handle issues they previously were unable 
to. The potential for in-ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation arose 
through the use of integrated technologies, such 
as facial recognition software, that would analyze 
the transmitted still image or video for suspects. 
If the software identiﬁ ed a suspect, law enforce-
ment would then be able to take appropriate action 
based on more informed decisions. . . . 
Reality Mobile’s Reality Vision provides deci-
sion makers the information to return the knowl-
edge back to ﬁ rst responders in the ﬁ eld, saving 
time and manpower in the ﬁ eld and on the street.
Technology Innovations
Siuru (2006, p.39) describes the Mobile Identi-
ﬁ er™, which has accuracy identiﬁ cation rates of 
greater than 99 percent:
A new handheld electronic “mug shot book” prom-
ises real-time identiﬁ cation—in the ﬁ eld. 
The handheld Mobile Identiﬁ er’s face recogni-
tion software has many more applications, such as 
identifying those wanted on warrants, dangerous 
sexual predators, fugitives and other bad guys. 
According to the [Los Angeles Police Department] 
LAPD’s Assistant to the Director of Operations, 
Commander Charlie Beck, “Mobile Identiﬁ er is pro-
viding our ofﬁ cers with critical identity information 
at their ﬁ ngertips.”
To ID a suspect, the ofﬁ cer points the lens of 
the 1.3-megapixel camera in the pocket PC-like 
unit. The unit has built-in LED lighting for illumi-
nating suspects under poor lighting conditions. 
Within seconds, the new image is compared with 
images in the database of the Mobile Identiﬁ er and 
nine images appear on the 3.5-inch display screen. 
These represent the best matches based on simi-
larity and differences, and are presented in order of 
likely accuracy, from best to worst match. In virtu-
ally every case, the correctly identiﬁ ed person is 
either in the ﬁ rst or second position.

210 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
If a match is found, the system returns the individual’s 
name and date of birth directly to the remote data terminal 
(RDT). Th e system also can query existing criminal history 
and warrant ﬁ les and provide information within minutes.
DEVELOPING A SUSPECT
If a suspect is not at the scene and not apprehended 
nearby, you must develop a suspect.
Suspects are developed through the following means:
• • Information provided by victims, witnesses and 
other persons likely to know about the crime or the 
suspect
• • Physical evidence left at the crime scene
• • Psychological proﬁ ling
• • Information in police ﬁ les
• • Information in the ﬁ les of other agencies
• • Informants
Many sources are sometimes needed to develop a sus-
pect. Most of these sources were introduced in the pre-
ceding chapter. At other times, the victim or witnesses 
provide the required information. Th en your task is to 
corroborate the identiﬁ cation through associative evi-
dence such as ﬁ ngerprints or DNA analysis, shoe prints, 
personal belongings and other such evidence left at the 
scene as described in Chapter 5. Police agencies also have 
automated ﬁ ngerprint identiﬁ cation systems and comput-
erized imaging systems to assist in identifying suspects.
VICTIMS AND WITNESSES
Developing a suspect is much easier if the victim or wit-
nesses can describe and identify the person who com-
mitted the crime. Witnesses may not have observed the 
actual crime but may have seen a vehicle leaving the scene 
and can describe it and its occupants. Obtain a complete 
description of the suspect(s) and any vehicles involved.
Ask very speciﬁ c questions and use an identiﬁ cation 
diagram to assist witnesses in describing suspects and 
vehicles.
Rather than simply asking a witness to describe a sus-
pect, ask speciﬁ c questions about each item in Table 7.1. A 
description sheet with a diagram also helps people describe 
suspects (Figure 7.1). Obtain information about how the 
suspect left the scene—on foot or in a vehicle. If in a vehi-
cle, obtain a complete description of it. Identifying the car 
may lead to identifying the suspect.
Field identiﬁ cation or show-up identiﬁ cation is on-the-
scene identiﬁ cation of a suspect by a victim of or witness 
to a crime. Field identiﬁ cation must be made within a 
short time after the crime was committed.
Th e critical element in ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation is time. Iden-
tiﬁ cation must occur very soon after the crime was com-
mitted (usually 15–20 minutes). Some experts, however, 
suggest that if a suspect has been temporarily detained, 
the show-up may occur as long as 2 hours after the crime 
was committed. If the suspect has ﬂ ed but is apprehended 
within minutes, you can either return the suspect to the 
scene or take the witness to where the suspect was appre-
hended. It is usually preferable to take the witness to the 
suspect than to return the suspect to the crime scene.
Whether the identiﬁ cation is made at or away from 
the scene, the victim or witness must identify the suspect 
as soon after the crime as possible so that details are still 
clear. However, a reasonable basis must exist for believ-
ing that immediate identiﬁ cation is required before using 
ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation. 
United States v. Ash, Jr. (1973) established that a 
 suspect does not have the right to have counsel 
present at a ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation.
Read suspects the Miranda warning before question-
ing them. Suspects may refuse to answer questions and 
may demand a lawyer before any questioning occurs, but 
they do not have the right to have a lawyer present before 
ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation is made. Suspects may not even know 
such identiﬁ cation is occurring. Victims or witnesses may 
be positioned so they can see the suspect while the sus-
pect cannot see them.
Field identiﬁ cations have been attacked on the basis 
that the victim or witness is too emotionally upset at the 
time to make an accurate identiﬁ cation, but such objec-
tions are seldom upheld. Mistaken identiﬁ cation is less 
likely if the person committing the crime is apprehended 
at the scene and is identiﬁ ed immediately. Have the vic-
tim or witnesses put their positive identiﬁ cation in writ-
ing and sign and date it, and then have it witnessed.
An integrated biometric identiﬁ cation system (IBIS) 
shrinks this time factor and solves a problem continually 
faced by police—the need to obtain positive identiﬁ cation 
and information on suspects at a crime scene or during a 
traﬃ  c stop. An IBIS is a comprehensive data system allows 
ﬁ eld oﬃ  cers to capture forensic-quality ﬁ ngerprints and 
facial images on a handheld device. Th e images can be trans-
mitted FBI’s Automated Fingerprint Identiﬁ cation System 
(AFIS) and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). 

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 211
identiﬁ cation, victim or eyewitness identiﬁ cation of a 
suspect should be corroborated by as much physical and 
circumstantial evidence as possible.
MUG SHOTS
If the victim or witness does not know the suspect but saw 
him or her clearly, mug shots may be used.
Have victims and witnesses view mug shots in an at-
tempt to identify a suspect you believe has a record.
Th is procedure, frequently depicted in television detec-
tive shows, is very time-consuming and is of value only if 
the suspect has a police record and has been photographed. 
Using facial recognition to scan the face of a suspect against 
a database of thousands of mug shots of known criminals 
helps oﬃ  cers pare down a list of suspects or solve a case.
Th e Integrated Law Enforcement Face-Identiﬁ cation 
System (ILEFIS) deploys a three-dimensional system to 
match images from surveillance or still photographs to 
existing mug shots with a high degree of accuracy.
COMPOSITE DRAWINGS AND SKETCHES
If witnesses can provide adequate information, a composite 
image can be made of the person who committed the crime. 
Composite drawings are most commonly used to draw 
human faces or full bodies, but they can also be used for 
any inanimate object described by a witness—for example, 
vehicles, unusual marks or symbols, tattoos or clothing: “A 
composite image’s main objective is to generate leads for 
the investigating detectives” (Jackson, 2006. p.37). 
Composite sketches can also be created using a com-
puterized identiﬁ cation kit such as Identi-Kit®, although 
some training is required to use them. Identi-Kit 2003 is a 
computerized version of the original Identi-Kit, developed 
in the late 1950s. Th e process starts with a police oﬃ  cer 
asking a series of initial questions, which creates a general 
likeness of a suspect based on a victim’s or witness’s descrip-
tion. After creating a general composite, oﬃ  cers can ﬁ ne-
tune the image of the criminal. Figure 7.2 illustrates how 
Identi-Kit helps develop suspects. Other software such as 
CompuSketch or Visatex is also becoming more popular 
for drafting computer-generated composites. 
DEVELOPING A SUSPECT THROUGH MODUS 
OPERANDI INFORMATION
A series of crimes often creates a recognizable modus ope-
randi (MO). For instance, a forger may use the same or a very 
similar name on each forgery, or a burglar may take the same 
type of property. If a series of burglaries occurs at the same 
Victims can provide information about who has a 
motive for the crime, who has the knowledge required to 
commit it and who is not a likely suspect. For example, in 
an “inside” burglary, the employer may be able to provide 
important information about which employees may or 
may not be suspects.
Eyewitness identiﬁ cation is highly fallible because of 
factors such as poor visibility, brief duration, distance and 
faulty memory. Because of such problems with witness

Proﬁ les are developed primarily for violent acts such as 
homicides, sadistic crimes, sex crimes, arson without 
apparent motive and crimes of serial or ritual sequence. 
Th e proﬁ le provides investigators with corroborative 
information about a known suspect or possible leads to an 
unknown suspect.
Th e psychological proﬁ le is determined by examining all 
data and evidence from a speciﬁ c crime scene, including, but 
not only, crime scene photographs, detailed photos of bodily 
injuries to victims, photos of any mutilation evidence, infor-
mation related to the condition of the  victim’s clothing or 
absence thereof, information regarding whether the crime 
scene was altered or unaltered, photos of the area beyond 
the immediate crime scene, available maps of the area, 
the medical examiner’s report and opinion and any other 
relevant information concerning the crime, particularly 
time of day, this may be the suspect’s time away from a regu-
lar job. Such MOs furnish important investigative leads.
Check the details of a speciﬁ c crime against your 
department’s MO ﬁ les. If no similar MO is listed, a new 
criminal may be starting activity in your area, or this may 
be the only crime the suspect intends to commit. In such 
cases, the suspect must be developed through sources 
other than MO information, such as information con-
tained in a psychological or criminal proﬁ le.
PSYCHOLOGICAL OR CRIMINAL PROFILING 
AND GEOGRAPHIC PROFILING
One method of suspect identiﬁ cation is psychological or 
criminal proﬁ ling, which attempts to identify an individ-
ual’s mental, emotional and psychological characteristics.

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 213
Psychological proﬁ ling is most often used in crimes 
against people in which a motive is unknown. Th e proﬁ le 
seeks to disclose a possible motive. Continued use of the 
technique has shown that the more information the police 
furnish the FBI, the greater the possibility of obtaining 
accurate leads. Reporting the unusual is extremely impor-
tant. Psychological proﬁ ling can help both eliminate and 
develop suspects, thereby saving investigative time.
Geographic proﬁ ling can also be helpful in iden-
tifying suspects who commit multiple crimes (serial 
criminals). Geographic proﬁ ling is based on the fact that 
everyone has a pattern to their lives, particularly in rela-
tion to the geographical areas they frequent. Th e serial 
criminal operates within a comfort zone—near to where 
he or she lives but far enough away to remain anonymous 
and still feel comfortable because he or she knows the 
area. A chief statistician for the Baltimore County Police 
Department asserts, “We can use computer programs to 
analyze crime patterns and depict geographically where 
certain crimes are clustered, relate those crimes to the 
environment in which they occur and identify where the 
potential suspects most likely live. Th at’s as important to 
solving crimes as a suspect’s description. It helps police 
understand better the areas where crimes occur. And it 
lets them focus on suspects with the highest probability 
of having committed the crime” (“Predicting a Criminal’s 
Journey to Crime,” 2006). 
Despite its usefulness, proﬁ ling is not infallible. 
Investigators should not rely solely on a proﬁ le without 
supporting evidence. For example, in the Atlanta Olympic 
bombing case of 1996, the proﬁ le resulted in the arrest 
abnormalities such as multiple slashings, disembowelment 
or dismembering of the body.
Speciﬁ c information is then categorized to produce 
predictive information regarding the suspect’s likely age, 
sex, race, weight and height; physical, mental and psycho-
logical condition; area of residence; whether known to the 
victim; whether the suspect has a criminal record; and 
other details.
Th e psychological proﬁ le produced by experts in 
criminal behavior analysis can provide excellent leads for 
investigators. Investigators who desire such assistance 
may provide a complete crime report to the local oﬃ  ce of 
the FBI, Domestic Cooperative Services. If the report is 
accepted, it is then forwarded to the FBI Behavioral Sci-
ence Unit.
In one criminal investigation, the FBI’s Behavioral 
Science Unit advised a police department that the serial 
rapist they were seeking was probably a 25- to 35-year-
old, divorced or separated White male, with a high school 
education who worked as a laborer, lived in the area of 
the rapes and engaged in voyeurism. Based on this infor-
mation, the agency developed a list of 40 suspects with 
these characteristics. Using other information in the pro-
ﬁ le, they narrowed their investigation to one suspect and 
focused on him. Within a week, they had enough informa-
tion to arrest him.
Interestingly, William Tafoya of the FBI developed a 
psychological proﬁ le of the Unibomber that many rejected. 
However, after the arrest of Th eodore Kaczynski, Tafoya’s 
assessment was observed to be much more accurate than 
many in the FBI had believed.

214 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Th e stereotyping of Blacks as criminals is so  pervasive 
throughout society that ‘criminal predator’ is used as a 
euphemism for ‘young Black males.’” Racial proﬁ ling
occurs when an oﬃ  cer singles out and focuses on an indi-
vidual as a suspect based solely on that person’s race: “Racial 
proﬁ ling, the inclusion of race as a primary determinant in 
characterizing persons considered to commit a speciﬁ c type 
of oﬀ ense, has been paired with accusations of racial dis-
crimination against Blacks and Latinos by police” (McGee, 
2007, p.224). Indicative of the seriousness of the matter, 
the entire August 2007 issue of Journal of Contemporary 
Criminal Justice was devoted to the topic of racial proﬁ ling. 
Racial proﬁ ling is unconstitutional, period. 
It is important to distinguish between proﬁ ling
(legitimate) as a policing technique and the politically 
charged term racial proﬁ ling (not legitimate). Some have 
suggested replacing racial proﬁ ling with the term biased-
based policing to emphasize this distinction: “Bias-based 
policing is an issue that police departments all across 
the country are addressing. Considering that bias-based 
policing undermines relationships between the police 
and the public, a considerable amount of research has 
been conducted to uncover and prevent the occurrence 
of bias-based policing. . . . Th is research found that 21 
percent of survey respondents believed that bias-based 
policing is presently practiced by oﬃ  cers in their depart-
ment, and 25.9 percent believed that bias-based policing 
is practiced by oﬃ  cers in other departments” (Ioimo et 
al., 2007, p.270).
Another viable alternative to racial proﬁ ling is “build-
ing a case.” Airport security personnel are taught to watch 
for certain traits—young, African American male paying 
for a ticket in cash, no luggage, nervousness, and so on—to 
proﬁ le possible drug dealers and are frequently criticized 
for such proﬁ ling. However, change the African American 
description to one of Middle Eastern descent and it is sud-
denly appropriate conduct for law enforcement: “In the 
aftermath of September 11, Arab Americans have a greater 
fear of racial proﬁ ling and immigration enforcement than 
of falling victim to hate crimes, according to a national 
study ﬁ nanced by the Justice Department. . . . Arab Ameri-
cans reported an increasing sense of victimization, suspi-
cion of government and law enforcement, and concerns 
about protecting their civil liberties” (Elliot, 2006). A 2004 
Amnesty International report (Th reat and Humiliation) 
states, “Just as it is inaccurate to talk about racial proﬁ ling 
in the context of the ‘War on Drugs’ as simply as ‘Driving 
While Black or Brown,’ it is wrong to characterize racial 
proﬁ ling committed in the name of the ‘War on Terror’ as 
simply ‘Flying While Arab.’”
Th e perception of racial proﬁ ling may be bolstered by 
discussions of pretextual traﬃ  c stops, that is, stop-
ping vehicles when the oﬃ  cer’s intent (pretext) was not 
of the security guard, who was later cleared. In addition, 
the legitimate use of proﬁ ling is sometimes confused with 
racial proﬁ ling.
RACIAL PROFILING
Welch (2007, p.276) reports, “Th e racial stereotyping of 
criminals has been an enduring and unfortunate feature of 
American culture. However, following the civil right move-
ment, the linkage between Blacks and crime was galvanized. 
Technology Innovations
Corbley (2008, pp.96–101) notes that geographic 
information systems (GIS) combined with global 
positioning systems (GPS) photomapping can be an 
excellent tool in helping investigators spatially piece 
together clues and evidence that are spread out over 
a relatively large area. In certain types of offenses, 
such as abductions, high-speed chases, assaults or 
rapes, the crime scene itself may be quite expansive, 
with evidence such as blood, bullet casings, tire 
treads or footprints, weapons and other items scat-
tered across many yards or even miles. The pattern 
of evidence dispersal can enable a forensics expert 
to reconstruct how a scene unfolded. The GPS photo-
mapping software uses photos taken by crime scene 
investigators and automatically maps the photos 
according to GPS location. The images are further 
stamped with coordinates, including the time and 
date of collection. The software then geo-references 
the photos according to their locations on a GIS base 
map, denoting each piece of evidence with an icon 
on the digital map, thus created a spatially accurate 
map of evidence locations. 
In one example, investigators used this technol-
ogy to help solve a 20-year-old case in which a man 
went missing during a boating excursion on Lake 
Powell in Utah and was presumed to have drowned. 
When human remains were found two decades later 
along the lakeshore, investigators used GPS photo-
mapping to cross reference the location with where 
the man had been initially reported missing 20 years 
ago. But it was still unclear whether  the victim had 
drowned by accident or by foul play. Investigators 
looked for answers at the site. The map of evidence 
suggested the body had simply been broken apart 
by waves and possibly coyotes over the years. The 
coroner found no evidence of foul play.

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 215
Th e courts have ruled that race can be one factor 
among others to use in developing suspects. In United 
States v. Weaver (1992), a Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration (DEA) agent stopped and questioned Arthur 
Weaver at a Kansas City airport “because he was 
‘roughly dressed,’ young, Black, and on a direct ﬂ ight 
from Los Angeles, a source city for drugs.” Weaver was 
carrying illicit drugs but challenged the legality of the 
arrest. Th e Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 
oﬃ  cer’s conduct:
Facts are not to be ignored simply because they may be 
unpleasant—and the unpleasant fact in this case is that 
the [DEA agent] had knowledge, based upon his own 
experience and upon the intelligence reports he had 
received from Los Angeles authorities, that young, male 
members of the African-American Los Angeles gangs 
were ﬂ ooding the Kansas City area with cocaine. To 
that extent then, race, when coupled with the other fac-
tors [the agent] relied upon, was a factor in the decision 
to approach and ultimately detain [the suspect]. We 
wish it were otherwise, but we take the facts as they are 
presented to us, not as we would wish them to be.
Shortly after September 11, 2001, the Supreme Court 
refused to hear the only remaining case previously dock-
eted concerning an equal protection claim in a case where 
police oﬃ  cers stopped persons based primarily on racial 
or ethnic descriptions. In Brown v. City of Oneonta (2001), 
a court of appeals for the Second Circuit held that where 
law enforcement oﬃ  cials have a description of a suspect 
that consists only of the suspect’s race and gender, and 
lacking evidence of discriminatory intent, they can act 
on that description without violating the equal protec-
tion clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Subjecting 
oﬃ  cers to equal-protection scrutiny when they detain or 
arrest could hamper police work. Oﬃ  cers who fear per-
sonal liability from equal-protection violations might fail 
to act when they are expected to. If police eﬀ ectiveness is 
hobbled by special racial rules, inner-city residents would 
be harmed the most.
TRACKING
Sometimes knowledge of tracking is helpful in develop-
ing suspects. Forensic tracking is the science of locat-
ing, retaining and interpreting footprint and tire tread 
impressions to solve criminal cases. Hanratty (2007, 
p.51) notes, “Th e art and science of tracking has a long 
history in America, but it has fallen out of favor over the 
last century.” He suggests, “‘What we don’t look for, we 
don’t ﬁ nd’ is a cliché that seems to apply to tracks. Foot-
prints are truly ‘the missed evidence’ in many jurisdic-
tions” (p.50).
In December 2003, the city of Garden Grove, California, began 
experiencing a series of armed robberies involving several 
suspects. The robberies consisted of one to three offenders robbing 
liquor stores and motel desk clerks at gunpoint. All offenders were 
wearing masks. The offenders would often commit two or three 
robberies a night in a spree.
 
A geographic proﬁ le was initially done for this case in late 
December and was updated in January. At that point, the total 
had reached 32 robberies. The area of the crimes covered 546 
square miles. There were now 11 police jurisdictions with crimes 
in the series.
 
The offenders were captured in early February 2004 after 
the suspects had completed 45 robberies. It was found that all 
offenders were staying at one of the motels they had previously 
robbed.
 
The peak proﬁ le area shown by the geographic proﬁ le was 
8 square miles. The location of the motel (the offender’s anchor 
point for the series) was in the top one percent of the updated 
proﬁ le (32 crimes), a highly accurate result.

the real reason for the stop. For example, an oﬃ  cer may 
stop someone for a traﬃ  c violation when he really sus-
pects that the person has drugs in the car, but he does 
not have reasonable suspicion to make the stop for drug 
possession. In Whren v. United States (1996), the Supreme 
Court aﬃ  rmed that oﬃ  cers could stop vehicles to allay any 
suspicions even though they have no evidence of crimi-
nal behavior. Th e legality of the stop will be gauged by its 
objective reasonableness, as discussed in Chapter 6.

216 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
physical characteristics, date of birth, age, race, general 
build, kind of clothing usually worn, height, weight, hair 
color and style, facial features, unusual marks, scars, tat-
toos, deformities, abnormalities, alcohol or drug use, 
MO and other information.
Field-interview cards that patrol oﬃ  cers ﬁ le when 
they stop people under suspicious circumstances can also 
provide leads. An oﬃ  cer may not know of an actual crime 
committed at the time of a stop but may later learn that a 
business or residence in the area of the stop was burglar-
ized at about the same time. Descriptions of vehicles in 
a high-crime area that do not ﬁ t the neighborhood also 
help to identify suspects. Chapter 6 discussed sources of 
information ranging from the local to the federal level, as 
well as the use of informants.
LOCATING SUSPECTS
any information sources used to develop a 
 suspect can also help locate the suspect. If the 
suspect is local and frequents public places, the victim 
may see the suspect and call the police. In one instance, a 
rape victim saw the alleged rapist in a shopping center and 
remembered that she had seen him there just before her 
rape occurred. Th e investigator accompanied the victim to 
the shopping center for several evenings until the victim 
saw the suspect and identiﬁ ed him.
Telephoning other investigative agencies, inquiring 
around the neighborhood of the suspect’s last known 
address or checking the address on a prison release 
form, questioning relatives and checking with utility 
companies and numerous other contacts can help locate 
suspects.
IDENTIFYING SUSPECTS
ield identiﬁ cation and mug shots have been 
 discussed previously.
Suspects can be identiﬁ ed through ﬁ eld or show-up 
identiﬁ cation, mug shots, photographic identiﬁ cation or 
lineups.
PHOTOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION
Often the victim or witnesses get a good look at the sus-
pect and can make a positive identiﬁ cation.
Footprints can provide valuable clues. Th e length of 
stride and depth of impression of footprints can help 
determine the size or height of the person and whether 
the person was carrying a heavy load. To determine an 
individual’s height from shoeprint length, “Measure the 
shoeprint length in inches and divide by two to get the 
height in feet. For example, a shoeprint that measures 
12 inches in length will indicate a person 6 feet tall. Th is 
is a rough estimate for use at the scene to rule in or rule 
out possible suspects” (Hanratty, 2007, p.47).
Tire prints can also provide information to investiga-
tors. For example, transfer of sticky soils is a good way 
to determine vehicle direction. Wet sand, mud or clay will 
initially stick to tires. As the vehicle continues moving, 
this material will fall oﬀ  the tires in the direction the vehi-
cle is headed. If the tracks shine in grass, they are headed 
away from you. Tire tracks coming toward you will show 
faintly as an oﬀ  color to the surrounding grass (Lee, 2007, 
pp.28–34). 
Tracking skill can be developed for impressions other 
than footprints and can provide many investigative leads. 
People hiding in outside areas may leave foot, knee, hand, 
heel or body impressions. Broken tree branches provide 
evidence of when the branch was broken—the lighter the 
color of the break, the more recent it is. Recent overturn-
ing of a stone may be indicated by the dirt or by the moist 
side being on top.
OTHER IDENTIFICATION AIDS
Visual aids such as newspaper photos or video and news 
ﬁ lms disseminated to the public may provide rapid iden-
tiﬁ cation of suspects. Yearbooks have also proved to be 
valuable in developing suspects.
If a suspect or victim is deceased and the identity is 
unknown, dental and orthopedic records may help. Facial 
reconstruction is also used in many areas to identify 
unknown victims or suspects if suﬃ  cient skull and facial 
parts are available. 
INFORMATION IN POLICE FILES AND 
FILES OF OTHER AGENCIES
Police records on solved crimes and on suspects involved 
in certain types of crimes often suggest leads. For exam-
ple, in the “Son of Sam” case in New York City, one lead 
was provided by a woman who saw an illegally parked car 
that ﬁ t the description of the car reported as being used in 
the crimes. Police then checked all parking tickets issued 
on that date for that time and location. Th is, combined 
with other information, eventually led to the suspect.
Police ﬁ les contain considerable information about 
people who have committed or are suspected of commit-
ting crimes. Th e ﬁ les contain such information as their 
M

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 217
It is unwise to show a single photograph to a vic-
tim or witness to obtain identiﬁ cation. Such identiﬁ ca-
tion is almost always inadmissible as evidence because 
it allows a chance of mistaken identity. Th e Supreme 
Court decision in Manson v. Brathwaite (1977), however, 
did approve the showing of a single picture in speciﬁ c 
circumstances.
After identiﬁ cation is made, review with the witness 
the conditions under which the suspect was seen, includ-
ing lighting at the time and distance from the suspect. 
Also ask just how certain they are they. Record this and 
the conditions of the identiﬁ cation, and ask the witness 
to sign the document.
LINEUP IDENTIFICATION
“Th e police lineup is a time-honored staple of crime solv-
ing, not to mention of countless cop movies and televi-
sion shows like Law and Order. Each year, experts estimate 
77,000 people nationwide are put on trial because wit-
nesses picked them out of [a lineup]” (Zernike, 2006). 
Schuster (2007, p.3) explains, “At its most basic level, a 
police lineup involves placing a suspect among people not 
suspected of committing the crime (ﬁ llers) and asking 
the eyewitness if he or she can identify the perpetrator.” 
Lineup identiﬁ cation is commonly used when the suspect 
is in custody and there were witnesses to the crime. Police 
have adopted lineup procedures to ensure accurate, fair 
identiﬁ cations and to meet the standards established by 
Supreme Court decisions. Basically, a lineup has the same 
requirements as photographic identiﬁ cation.
Use lineup identiﬁ cation when the suspect is in custody. 
Use at least ﬁ ve individuals of comparable race, height, 
weight, age and general appearance. Ask all to perform the 
same actions or speak the same words. Instruct those view-
ing the lineup that they need not make an identiﬁ cation.
Use photographic identiﬁ cation when you have a good 
idea of who committed a crime but the suspect is not 
in custody, or when a fair lineup cannot be conducted. 
Tell witnesses they need not identify anyone from the 
photographs.
Photographs can be obtained through surveillance or 
from ﬁ les. Select pictures of at least ﬁ ve people of com-
parable race, height, weight and general appearance. Th e 
photographs can be kept separate or mounted on a com-
posite board. Write a number or code on the back of each 
photograph to identify the individual, but do not include 
any other information, especially that the person has a 
criminal record. Tell witnesses that they need not iden-
tify anyone from among the photographs and that it is as 
important to eliminate innocent people from suspicion as 
it is to identify the guilty.
A suspect does not have the right to a lawyer if a photo-
graphic lineup is used (United States v. Ash, Jr., 1973).
Many departments use a “six pack” photo display of 
mug shots or other photos of the suspect and ﬁ ve other 
individuals. If there are several witnesses, have each one 
view a separate set of pictures independently—preferably 
in a diﬀ erent room if other witnesses are viewing the pho-
tographs at the same time. If witnesses recognize a photo-
graph, have them indicate this by placing their initials and 
the date on the front of the photograph. Th en have them 
initial and date the back of each remaining photograph. Th is 
procedure establishes the fairness of the identiﬁ cation.
Other departments use a sequential approach to 
showing photographs to witnesses one photograph at a 
time. Such a sequential showing allows a witness to decide 
about each photo before looking at the next, reducing the 
tendency to compare photos.
This lineup shows ﬁ ve suspects of 
comparable race, height, weight, age, 
and general appearance in accordance 
with lineup standards set by the U.S. 
Supreme Court. A computer was used 
to select lineup subjects and generate 
a useable composite for a witness to 
look at. (© Helen King/Corbis)

218 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
After obtaining the money, he left the bank and drove 
away with an accomplice who had been waiting outside 
in a car.
In March 1965, an indictment was returned against 
Wade and an accomplice for the bank robbery. He was 
arrested April 2, 1965. Approximately 2 weeks later, an 
FBI agent put Wade in a lineup to be observed by two bank 
employees. Wade’s counsel was not notiﬁ ed of the lineup. 
Each person in the lineup had strips of tape similar to 
those worn by the bank robber, and each was requested 
to say words allegedly spoken at the robbery. Both bank 
employees picked Wade out of the lineup as being the 
robber, and both employees again identiﬁ ed Wade in the 
courtroom.
Th e defense objected that the bank employees’ court-
room identiﬁ cations should be stricken because the origi-
nal lineup had been conducted without the presence of 
Wade’s counsel. Th e motion was denied, and Wade was 
found guilty. Counsel held that this violated his Fifth 
Amendment right against self-incrimination and his 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel being present at the 
lineup.
Th e Wade decision ruled, “Prior to having a sus-
pect participate in a lineup, the oﬃ  cer must advise the 
suspect of his constitutional right to have his lawyer 
present during the lineup.” Recall that this right to a 
lawyer does not apply to ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation or photo-
graphic identiﬁ cation. Th e Court held that a suspect has 
the right to have counsel present at the lineup because 
a lineup is held for identiﬁ cation by eyewitnesses and 
may involve vagaries leading to mistaken identiﬁ cation. 
Th e Court cited the many cases of mistaken identiﬁ ca-
tion and the improper manner in which the suspect may 
have been presented. Th e Court commented that nei-
ther the lineup nor anything that Wade was required 
to do in the lineup violated his privilege against self-
incrimination.
Th e Court stated in Schmerber v. California (1966) that 
protection against self-incrimination involved disclosure 
of knowledge by the suspect. Both state and federal courts 
have held that compulsion to submit to photographs, ﬁ n-
gerprinting, measurements, blood analysis or samples of 
writing and speaking is not self-incrimination under the 
Fifth Amendment.
Th e ruling in Gilbert v. California (1967), a compan-
ion case to Wade, also held that ID evidence from a lineup 
conducted without counsel, after indictment and arraign-
ment, was inadmissible at trial. Th is requirement of pro-
viding counsel to a suspect in a lineup that occurs after 
indictment or arraignment is known as the “Wade-Gilbert 
Rule” (Rutledge, 2006, p.69).
If suspects waive their right to counsel, get the waiver 
in writing. A waiver such as the one in Figure 7.3 can be 
used.
Lineups may have from 5 to 10 people. The suspect 
must not be of a different race, exceptionally taller or 
shorter, have longer or shorter hair or be dressed very 
differently from the others in the lineup. The sus-
pect must not be handcuffed unless everyone in the 
lineup is handcuffed. Nor may the suspect be asked 
to step forward, turn a certain direction or speak cer-
tain words unless everyone in the lineup is asked to do 
the same.
Recent studies on lineup structure and implementa-
tion have led to questions and disagreements. Th e person 
conducting the lineup typically knows who the suspect is, 
and some evidence exists that this person might, either 
purposefully or inadvertently, give the witness verbal or 
nonverbal cues to the suspect’s identity (Schuster, 2007). 
For example, the lineup administrator might say, “Take 
your time,” in eﬀ ect, leading the witness away from a 
ﬁ ller. To compensate for this tendency, some have rec-
ommended using a double-blind lineup, where neither the 
administrator nor witness knows the suspect’s identity 
(Schuster).
As with photographic identiﬁ cation, lineups may be 
simultaneous or sequential. Having one person at a time 
appear before the witness (a sequential lineup) avoids 
having the witness identify, through the process of elimi-
nation, someone who looks most like the suspect. Some 
studies have proved that witnesses tend to compare one 
member of a simultaneous lineup with another, making 
relative judgments about who looks most like the per-
petrator. Consequently, “Social scientists studying lab 
research said that showing suspects one at a time—in 
person or in photos—would result in more accurate iden-
tiﬁ cation” (Rozas, 2007).
However, a study on eyewitness identiﬁ cation by the 
Illinois State Police found that the sequential double-
blind procedures resulted in a higher rate of false iden-
tiﬁ cation than did the simultaneous lineup (“Study of 
Police Lineup,” 2007, pp.6–7). Th e research to date favors 
the sequential double-blind lineup, but the controversy 
continues.
If the suspect refuses to participate in the lineup or 
a lineup cannot be conducted for some reason, simply 
photograph the suspect and each individual in the lineup 
separately and use photographic identiﬁ cation.
Suspects may refuse to participate in a lineup, but such 
refusals can be used against them in court (Schmerber v. 
California, 1966). Suspects have a Sixth Amendment right 
to have an attorney present during a lineup. 
In United States v. Wade (1967), a robber forced a 
cashier and a bank oﬃ  cial to place money in a pillowcase. 
Th e robber had a piece of tape on each side of his face.

SURVEILLANCE, UNDERCOVER 
ASSIGNMENTS AND RAIDS: 
THE LAST RESORT
ollow that car!” “I think we’re being tailed!” 
 “I lost him!” “My cover’s blown!” “We’ve been 
made!” “It’s a raid!” Police oﬃ  cers, criminals and the public 
are very aware of investigative practices such as observing 
suspects or their houses or apartments, tailing suspects, 
staking out locations and conducting raids. Television 
shows and movies, however, usually depict the glamorous, 
dangerous sides of this facet of investigation. Th ey seldom 
show the long hours of preparation or the days—even 
weeks—of tedious watchfulness frequently required.
Surveillance, undercover assignments and raids are used 
only when normal methods of continuing the investiga-
tion fail to produce results.
Avoid having the same person make both photographic 
and lineup identiﬁ cation. If you do so, do not conduct 
both within a short time period.
If suspects choose to have a lawyer, they may either 
select their own or ask you to obtain one. Th e lawyer 
may confer with the suspect in private before the lineup 
and may talk with witnesses observing the lineup, but 
witnesses are not obligated to talk with the lawyer. Wit-
nesses may wear face covers to avoid recognition by 
the suspect. Usually the lineup room ensures viewers’ 
anonymity.
Give witnesses clear instructions before the lineup. 
Tell them they need not identify anyone in the lineup, 
they are not to confer with any other witnesses viewing 
the lineup and they are not to indicate an identiﬁ cation 
in any way. Tape record or videotape the proceedings and 
take a color photograph of the lineup to nullify any allega-
tions by the defense counsel of unfair procedure. Th e form 
in Figure 7.4 provides additional evidence of the fairness 
and reliability of a lineup identiﬁ cation.
WAIVER OF RIGHT TO LEGAL COUNSEL AT LINEUP
Your Rights Are:  The police are requesting you to personally appear in a lineup.  There
will be a number of other persons similiar in physical characteristics with you.  The
purpose of the lineup is to permit witnesses to observe all persons in the lineup, to make
an identification.  You may be asked to perform certain actions such as speaking, 
walking or moving in a certain manner or to put on articles of clothing.  You must appear
in the lineup, but you have a right to have legal cousel of your choice present.  If you do
not have an attorney, one can be appointed for you by the court, and the lineup will not be
held until your legal counsel is present.  An attorney can help you defend against an
identification made by witnesses at the lineup.
You have the right to waive legal counsel being present at the lineup.
WAIVER
I have read, or have had read to me, this statement of my rights and I understand these
rights.  I am willing to participate in a lineup in the absence of legal counsel.  I fully
understand and give my consent to what I am being asked to do.  No promises or threats
have been made to me, and no pressure of coercion has been used against me.  I
understand that I must appear in the lineup, but this consent is to the waiver of legal
counsel being present at the lineup.

Surveillance can help do the following:
• • Gain information required for building a criminal 
complaint
• • Determine an informant’s loyalty
• • Verify a witness’s statement about a crime
• • Gain information required for obtaining a search or 
arrest warrant
• • Gain information necessary for interrogating a 
suspect
• • Identify a suspect’s associates
• • Observe members of terrorist organizations
• • Find a person wanted for a crime
• • Observe criminal activities in progress
Th ese techniques are expensive and potentially dan-
gerous and are not routinely used.

he covert, discreet observation of people 
 or places is called surveillance (“to watch 
over”). 
The objective of surveillance is to obtain information 
about people, their associates and their activities that 
may help to solve a criminal case or to protect witnesses.

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 221
location, when you suspect that stolen goods are to be 
dropped or when informants have told you that a crime 
is going to be committed. Such assignments are compara-
tively short. An outside surveillance simpliﬁ es planning. 
Th e observation may be from a car, van or truck or by post-
ing an oﬃ  cer in an inconspicuous place with a view of the 
location. A “dummy” van or a borrowed business van and 
a disguise as a painter, carpenter or service technician are 
often used. Take photographs and notes throughout the 
surveillance.
In longer surveillances, it is often necessary to pho-
tograph people who frequent a speciﬁ c location, such as a 
store suspected of being a cover for a bookmaking opera-
tion or a hotel or motel that allows prostitution or gam-
bling. If the subject of surveillance is a place rather than a 
person, obtain a copy of the building plan and personally 
visit the building in advance if possible. Know all entrances 
and exits, especially rear doors and ﬁ re escapes. To prop-
erly record what is observed, use closed-circuit camera 
equipment, movie or video cameras, binoculars with a 
camera attached, telephoto lenses or infrared equipment 
for night viewing and photographing.
Lengthy ﬁ xed surveillance is often conducted from a 
room with an unobstructed view of the location, such as 
an apartment opposite the location being watched. Nat-
urally, the surveillant must not be noticed entering the 
observation post.
Whether the stationary surveillance is short or long, 
have adequate communications such as radio, horn signals 
or hand signals. Use simple hand signals such as pulling 
up the collar, buttoning the shirt, pulling down the brim 
on a hat, tying a shoelace, running the hand through the 
hair or checking a wristwatch. If you use radio communi-
cations, ﬁ nd out whether the subject might be monitoring 
police radio frequencies and, if likely, establish a code.
Select the surveillance team to ﬁ t the case and area, 
and have enough surveillants to cover the assignment. 
Scout the area in person or by studying maps. Sketch the 
immediate area to determine possible ways the subject 
could avoid observation or apprehension. Be aware of 
alleys, abnormal street conditions, one-way streets, bar-
ricades, parking ramps and all other details. Th is is espe-
cially critical when the objective of the surveillance is to 
apprehend people committing a crime. In such cases, all 
members of the stakeout must know the signal for action 
and their speciﬁ c assignments.
Moving Surveillance Th e subjects of moving surveil-
lance are almost always people. Th e surveillant may be 
referred to as a tail. Th e ﬁ rst step in planning such a sur-
veillance is to obtain as much information about the subject 
as you can. View photographs and, if possible, personally 
observe the subjects. Memorize their physical descriptions 
• • Make a legal arrest
• • Apprehend a criminal in the act of committing a crime
• • Prevent a crime
• • Recover stolen property
• • Protect witnesses
Because surveillance is a time-consuming, expensive 
operation that can raise questions of invasion of privacy, 
ﬁ rst exhaust all alternatives. Balance the rights of the 
individual against the need for public safety.
THE SURVEILLANT
Th e surveillant is the plainclothes investigator who makes 
the observation. Surveillants must be prepared for tedium. 
No other assignment requires as much patience and perse-
verance while demanding alertness and readiness to respond 
instantly. Surveillants must display ingenuity in devising a 
cover for the operation. Lack of resourcefulness in provid-
ing adequate answers at a moment’s notice can jeopardize 
the entire case. Th e most successful surveillants do not 
attract attention but blend into the general populace.
Multiple surveillants may also compose a surveillance 
team (ST). An eﬀ ective ST requires everyone to be “on the 
same page,” which calls for communication and brieﬁ ngs.
THE SUBJECT
Th e subject is whom or what is observed. It can be a 
person, place, property, vehicle, group of people, organi-
zation or object. People under surveillance are usually sus-
pects in a crime or their associates. Surveillance of places 
generally involves a location where a crime is expected to 
be committed: the residence of a known criminal; a place 
suspected of harboring criminal activities such as illegal 
drug transactions, gambling, prostitution or purchase of 
stolen goods or fencing operations; or the suspected head-
quarters of a terrorist organization.
TYPES OF SURVEILLANCE
Th e type of surveillance used depends on the subject and 
the objective of the surveillance. In general, surveillance is 
either stationary or moving.
The types of surveillance include stationary (ﬁ xed, plant 
or stakeout) and moving (tight or close, loose, rough, on 
foot or by vehicle). 
Stationary Surveillance Stationary, or ﬁ xed surveil-
lance, also called a plant or stakeout, is used when you 
know or suspect that a person is at or will come to a known 

222 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
the subject leave or you can wait outside. If a subject enters 
a building that has numerous exits, follow at a safe distance, 
noticing all potential exits. If the subject takes an elevator, 
wait at the ﬁ rst ﬂ oor until the subject returns, noticing the 
ﬂ oors at which the elevator stops. If there is a stairway near 
the elevator, stand near the door so you can hear if the sub-
ject has gotten oﬀ  the elevator and taken the stairs. Such 
stairs are seldom used, and when someone is going up or 
down, his or her footsteps echo and can easily be heard.
When tailing a subject on the street, do not hesitate to 
pass the subject and enter a store yourself. Th e less obvi-
ous you are, the more successful you will be. Use the glass 
in doors and storefront windows to see behind you.
Subjects who suspect they are being followed use 
many tricks. Th ey may turn corners suddenly and stand 
in a nearby doorway, go into a store and duck into a 
restroom, enter a dressing room, hide behind objects or 
suddenly jump on a bus or into a taxi. Th ey may do such 
things to determine whether they are being followed or to 
lose someone they know is following them. It is usually bet-
ter to lose subjects than to alert them to your presence or to 
allow them to identify you.
Surveillants often believe they have been recognized 
when in fact they have not. However, if you are certain the 
subject knows you are following, stop the surveillance, but 
do not return to the police department right away because 
the subject may decide to tail you.
If it is critical not to lose the subject, use more than one 
surveillant, preferably three. Surveillant A keeps a very close 
tail immediately behind the subject. Surveillant B follows 
behind Surveillant A and the subject. Surveillant C observes 
from across the street parallel with the other two. If the sub-
ject turns the corner, Surveillant A continues in the previous 
direction for a while, and Surveillant B or Surveillant C picks 
up the tail. Surveillant A then takes the position previously 
held by the surveillant who picked up the close tail.
When tailing by vehicle, have descriptions of all vehicles 
the subject drives or rides in. Th e subject’s vehicle can be 
marked in advance by an electronic device or beeper mon-
itored by a receiver in your car, or you can place the beeper 
in an object the subject will be carrying. A small amount of 
ﬂ uorescent paint can be applied to the rear bumper of the 
vehicle to make it easily identiﬁ able day or night.
Your own vehicle should be inconspicuous. Obtain 
unregistered (“dead”) plates for it from the motor vehi-
cle authorities and change them frequently, or change 
your vehicle daily, perhaps using rental cars. Changing 
the number of occupants tends to confuse a suspicious 
subject. If surveillance is to be primarily at night, install 
a multiple contact switch to allow you to turn oﬀ  one of 
your headlights at will.
Like subjects being tailed on foot, subjects being tailed 
by vehicle often use tricks to determine whether they are 
and form a mental image of them. Concentrate on their 
appearance from behind, as this is the view you normally 
have while “tailing” them. Although subjects may alter their 
physical appearance, this usually presents no problem. Th e 
major problem is to keep subjects under constant surveil-
lance for the desired time. Know the subjects’ habits, where 
they are likely to go and whether they walk or drive. If they 
drive, ﬁ nd out what kind of vehicle(s) they use. Also ﬁ nd 
out who their associates are and whether they are likely to 
suspect that they are being observed.
Other problems of moving surveillance are losing the 
subject and having the subject recognize you as a surveillant. 
Sometimes it is not important if the subject knows of the sur-
veillance. Th is is often true of material witnesses the police 
are protecting. It is also true of organized crime ﬁ gures, who 
know they are under constant surveillance and consider this. 
In such instances, a rough tail or open tail is used. You 
need not take extraordinary means to remain undetected. 
Th e major problem of a rough tail is that it is liable to the 
charge of police harassment or invasion of privacy.
At other times, it is more important to remain unde-
tected than to keep the subject under constant observa-
tion. In such cases, a loose tail is used. Maintain a safe 
distance one or two vehicles behind the subject and “hand 
oﬀ ” the subject to another oﬃ  cer after taking one turn. 
If the subject is lost during surveillance, you can usually  
relocate the subject and resume the surveillance. A loose 
tail is often used when you need general information 
about the subject’s activities or associates.
Often, however, it is extremely important not to lose 
the subject, and a very close (tight) tail is maintained. 
On a crowded street, this means staying within a few 
steps of the subject; on a less crowded street, it means 
keeping the subject in sight. A close tail is most commonly 
used when you know the subject is going to commit a 
crime, when you must know the subject’s exact habits or 
when knowledge of the subject’s activities is important to 
another critical operation.
When tailing a subject on foot, you can use numerous 
delaying tactics. You can cross to the other side of the 
street, talk to a person standing nearby, increase your dis-
tance from the subject, read a magazine or newspaper, buy 
a soda, tinker with the engine in your car, tie your shoe, look 
in windows or in parked cars or stall in any other way.
If the subject turns a corner, do not follow closely. 
When you do turn the corner, if you ﬁ nd the subject wait-
ing in a doorway, pass by without paying attention. Th en 
try to resume the tail by guessing the subject’s next move. 
Th is is often possible when you have advance information 
on the subject’s habits.
If the subject enters a restaurant, you can either enter 
and take a seat on the side of the room opposite from the 
subject, making sure you are near the door so you can see 

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 223
of avoiding surveillance or, at the very least, of making 
surveillance diﬃ  cult. Half the battle for law enforcement 
oﬃ  cers is realizing that they are actually being watched, 
as opposed to being the watchers” (Donlon-Cotton, 2007, 
p.75). Sometimes a counter-counter-surveillance is used 
if personnel are available.
Not every surveillance is successful. In some instances, 
the subject is lost or the surveillant is recognized, despite 
the best eﬀ orts to avoid either. Like any other investigative 
technique, failure results from unforeseen circumstances 
such as vehicle malfunction, illness of the surveillant, 
unexpected absence of the subject due to illness or emer-
gency, abnormal weather conditions or terrain and other 
factors beyond control. Usually, however, information and 
evidence obtained through surveillance are well worth the 
time and eﬀ ort invested. In most instances, a form such 
as the one shown in Figure 7.5 should be completed after 
a surveillance assignment.
SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT
Surveillance equipment includes binoculars, telescopes, 
night-vision equipment, body wires and video systems. 
Surveillance systems have become extremely sophisti-
cated. One system, for example, conceals a periscope in 
what looks like a standard air vent in the roof of a van. 
Th e periscope rotates 360 degrees and is undetectable. 
being tailed or to lose an identiﬁ ed tail. Th ey may turn in 
the middle of the block, go through a red light, suddenly 
pull into a parking stall, change traﬃ  c lanes rapidly, go 
down alleys or go the wrong way down a one-way street. 
In such cases, if temporarily losing the subject causes no 
problem, stop the surveillance.
If it is critical not to lose the subject, use more than 
one vehicle for the surveillance. Th e ideal system uses 
four vehicles. Vehicle A drives ahead of the subject and 
observes through the rearview mirror. (Th is vehicle is not 
used if only three vehicles are available). Vehicle B follows 
right behind the subject. Vehicles C and D follow on left 
and right parallel streets to pick up the tail if the subject 
turns in either direction.
AVOIDING DETECTION
Criminals are often suspicious of stakeouts or of being 
followed and may send someone to scout the area to see 
whether anybody has staked out their residence or their 
vehicle. Th is person may stand on the corner near the 
residence or drive around the block several times to see if 
everything is clear. Criminals often watch the windows or 
roofs of buildings across the street for movements. When 
they leave their residences, they may have an accomplice 
trail behind to see if anyone is following. Anticipate and 
plan for such activities: “Counter surveillance is the practice

224 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
Covert video systems can be disguised in many 
ways—in clocks, picture frames, exit signs and domes. 
Such systems can record drug buys, money laundering, 
shoplifting, and bank robberies and are usually admissi-
ble in court. Remote network video cameras are available 
that can send video via commercial cellular telephone net-
works. Such surveillance cameras can be discreetly posi-
tioned anywhere and can be hidden inside a weatherproof 
enclosure mounted on a telephone pole or deployed from 
a squad car (Careless, 2007, p.22).
Although a warrant is generally required to use surveil-
lance, the courts have allowed law enforcement to protect 
certain investigative techniques, to protect information 
regarding sensitive equipment or to protect surveillance 
Remote motion detectors activate the system to video-
tape the area under surveillance.
Global positioning system (GPS) technology is also 
being used in surveillance operations. In United States v. 
Knotts (1983), the Court ruled that installing and moni-
toring a bird dog tracking device in a public location did 
not violate a suspect’s rights.
AERIAL SURVEILLANCE
Aerial surveillance may provide information about areas 
inaccessible to foot or vehicle surveillance. Communica-
tion between air surveillance and ground vehicles facili-
tates the operational movement in and around the target 
area. Th e aerial pilot should either be a police oﬃ  cer or be 
carefully selected by the police. Th e pilot should be famil-
iar with the landmarks of the area because many such sur-
veillances involve moving suspect vehicles.
Photographs taken from navigable air space, usu-
ally 1,000 feet, do not violate privacy regulations. In one 
aerial surveillance, oﬃ  cers viewed a partially covered 
greenhouse within the residential curtilage from a heli-
copter 400 feet above the greenhouse. Th e greenhouse, 
which contained marijuana plants, was located 10 to 20 
feet behind the residence, a mobile home. A wire fence 
surrounded the entire property, and “Do Not Enter” 
signs were posted. Nonetheless, Florida v. Riley (1989) 
approved the warrantless aerial surveillance, noting that 
there should be no reasonable expectation of privacy 
from the skies above.
VISUAL/VIDEO SURVEILLANCE
Video images are often used as evidence in high-proﬁ le 
criminal investigations, with thousands of lesser crimes 
caught on video each year: “Criminal acts are increasingly 
captured on analog video tape and in digital formats from 
closed-circuit television systems, cell phone cameras and 
other forms of security and surveillance equipment. Th e 
video is generally available to law enforcement oﬃ  cers, 
originating from banks, malls, schools, parking lots, oﬃ  ce 
complexes, retail establishments, service stations, hotels, 
and restaurants” (Pincince, 2007, p.105). For example, 
the black-and-white video image of Timothy McVeigh’s 
Ryder truck within a block of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building placed the suspected vehicle at the scene.
Areas experiencing illegal drug sales might be placed 
under covert surveillance for extended periods in which 
police resources are focused intensively on the area: 
“Interdictions based on problem-oriented policing can be 
successful. Largely invisible interdictions of this type can 
have positive impacts on reported neighborhood crime” 
(Nunn et al., 2006, p.73).
Technology Innovations
Miles (pp.20–23, 2007) describes a potentially 
life-saving innovation—through-the-wall (TWS) 
surveillance: 
TWS technology helps ofﬁ cers to determine if 
someone is in a room before putting themselves in 
harm’s way and to save lives by using motion and 
images to differentiate between a hostage and a 
hostage taker. It can also detect motion through 
ﬂ oors and rubble following a building structure 
failure and, therefore, help in the search for sur-
vivors. It allows users to conduct room-to-room 
searches for suspected terrorists, map the interior 
of buildings, and mind military combatants and 
weapons caches—all through an interior or exte-
rior building wall. Certain TWS technologies do 
not even need to be placed against a wall and can 
be used to perform standoff searches, for example, 
from a vehicle into a building. . . .
Current TWS technology is limited in what it 
can do. Metal in walls and metal-backed insula-
tion can block the ability to see into a room, and 
most TWS technologies provide a lower resolution 
image compared to video images. . . .
TWS technology raises signiﬁ cant privacy 
issues. Does it violate a person’s Fourth Amendment 
right against unreasonable search and seizure? In 
some situations, this technology would constitute 
an unreasonable search of a home unless a warrant 
with probable cause had been issued. The primary 
exception would be in emergency or exigent condi-
tions. There is a signiﬁ cant body of case law that 
describes such conditions.

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 225
ability to process video, just like they have police cars and 
oﬃ  cers have guns” (Heinecke, 2007, p.86). To this end, the 
Department of Justice and the International Association 
of Chiefs of Police have developed three Regional Foren-
sic Video Analysis Labs, located in Cincinnati, Ohio; Fort 
Worth, Texas; and Raynham, Massachusetts. A fourth 
location is yet to be determined. Heinecke notes, “Just as 
DNA has CODIS and ﬁ ngerprints have AFIS, now foren-
sic video evidence will have the Regional Forensic Video 
Analysis Labs—a national database of criminals caught on 
tape” (p.89).
AUDIO OR ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE
In special instances, electronic devices are used in surveil-
lance. Such electronic surveillance techniques include wir-
ing a person who is going to be talking with a subject or 
entering a suspicious business establishment, “bugging” 
a subject’s room or vehicle or wiretapping a telephone.
Th e most common forms of lawfully authorized elec-
tronic surveillance available to law enforcement are pen 
registers, trap-and-trace devices and content intercep-
tions. Pen registers and trap-and-trace devices record 
dialing and signaling information used in processing and 
routing telephone communication, such as the signals 
that identify the dialed numbers of outgoing calls or the 
originating numbers of incoming calls.
Electronic surveillance and wiretapping are con-
sidered forms of search and are therefore permitted 
only with probable cause and a court order (Katz v. 
United States, 1967).
In Katz v. United States, the Supreme Court consid-
ered an appeal by Charles Katz, who had been convicted 
in California of violating gambling laws. Investigators 
had observed Katz for several days as he made telephone 
calls from a particular phone booth at the same time each 
day. Suspecting he was placing horse-racing bets, the 
investigators attached an electronic listening/recording 
device to the telephone booth and recorded Katz’s illegal 
activities. Th e evidence was used in convicting Katz. Th e 
Supreme Court reversed the California decision, saying, 
“Th e Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. . . . 
Wherever a man may be, he is entitled to know that he will 
remain free from unreasonable searches and seizures.” 
Th e investigators did have probable cause, but they erred 
in not presenting their information to a judge and obtain-
ing prior approval for their actions.
Th e importance of electronic surveillance is recog-
nized in the introduction to Title III of the Omnibus Crime 
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which authorized 
locations. Th e courts have allowed warrantless surveillance 
if revealing the technique may endanger law enforcement 
oﬃ  cers’ lives or the lives of those who allow their property 
to be used in such activity, or they may no longer allow 
their property to be used for surveillance. Th e courts have 
also allowed warrantless surveillance if once a technique 
is revealed it is of no further value to law enforcement or 
might show criminals how to use the technique. 
Many visual surveillance systems have night-vision 
or telephoto lenses as well as time-and-date generators. 
Many also have hard-copy printers that produce black-
and-white or color photographic copies on site. One of the 
most valuable pieces of equipment is often high-quality 
binoculars. Visual or video surveillance is often used in 
conjunction with audio or electronic surveillance.
Video Analysis Fredericks, a national video forensics 
expert says, “Video analysis is the new DNA for law enforce-
ment. It is the next generation of investigation. Every 
police department in the country will have to have the 
Gloved ﬁ ngers hold a miniature video camera. These cameras, 
known as board cameras, are used for covert surveillance at 
home or in the work place. They can be located where they will 
not be noticed and used to surveil suspects. The cameras can be 
connected to standard video and television equipment.

in the vehicle for drugs. While in the patrol car, the sus-
pects made incriminating statements that were recorded 
without their knowledge. Although one defendant argued 
that the recording violated his right to privacy, the court 
disagreed, stating “no reasonable expectation of privacy 
exists in the back seat of a patrol car.”
Th e courts have also held that no expectation of pri-
vacy exists in prison cells or in interrogation rooms. 
SURVEILLANCE AND THE CONSTITUTION
Th roughout the discussion on surveillance, of most 
importance is the balance between acting without vio-
lating suspects’ constitutional rights and the need for 
law enforcement to do its job of protecting society. Th e 
Court’s desire to maintain this balance was seen in Kyllo 
v. United States (2001), introduced in Chapter 4. In this 
case, the Court held that thermal imaging of a house was 
a search and required a warrant.
UNDERCOVER ASSIGNMENTS
he non-uniformed or plainclothes investigator 
 is in a good position to observe illegal activi-
ties and obtain evidence. For example, a male plainclothes 
oﬃ  cer may appear to accept the solicitations of a prosti-
tute, or any plainclothes police oﬃ  cer may attempt to buy 
stolen goods or drugs or to place illegal bets. Many such 
activities require little more than simply “not smelling 
court-ordered electronic surveillance of organized crime 
ﬁ gures. Th e U.S. Congress stated, “Organized criminals 
make extensive use of wire and oral communications in 
their criminal activities. Th e interception of such commu-
nications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes 
or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to 
law enforcement and the administration of justice.”
Title III does not prohibit surreptitiously recording 
telephone conversations if one party consents. To avoid 
wiretaps, suspects often use “drop phones,” prepaid cell 
phones that are disposed of regularly. Prepaid phone 
cards serve the same purpose and can be easily purchased 
in many places without a person’s having to produce 
identiﬁ cation.
Federal and state laws allow electronic surveillance 
(eavesdropping), provided it is authorized by a federal or 
state judge and speciﬁ ed procedures are followed. Adver-
tisements in police magazines describe state-of-the-art 
surveillance systems that make undercover work more 
eﬃ  cient and eﬀ ective. Laser technology can direct a beam 
at the glass in a window with another beam modulated 
by sonic vibrations inside the room, bouncing the sound 
back to a receiver so oﬃ  cers can hear what is being said. 
Eavesdropping with “bugs” is now easier than ever. Crimi-
nals are using high-tech electronic countermeasures to 
detect such devices in a room before they hold a meeting 
or conversation there.
Th e courts have upheld the right of oﬃ  cers to tape 
conversations that occur inside their squad cars. In the 
case of United States v. McKinnon (1993), two suspects 
were stopped for a traﬃ  c violation and asked to sit in the 
patrol car while the oﬃ  cer conducted a consent search

regardless of whether it is a person or an organization. 
If you are going to be working undercover, make plans 
for communicating with headquarters. Make telephone 
calls from public pay phones, or mail letters to a ﬁ ctitious 
friend’s post oﬃ  ce box. Have a plan for communicating 
emergency messages, and know what to do if the authori-
ties move in on the subject when you are there. Have a 
plan for leaving the subject when you have acquired the 
desired information or evidence.
Because you might be arrested if the subject is 
arrested, learn ahead of time whether you are to “blow 
your cover” or submit to arrest. In some instances, out-
side sources may interfere with the lawful arrest, posing 
great danger for an undercover agent whose identity has 
become known during the arrest. When the assignment is 
successfully completed, give the subject a plausible expla-
nation for leaving because it may be necessary to reestab-
lish the undercover contact later.
It is often better to use undercover agents than infor-
mants because the testimony of a reliable, trained investi-
gator is less subject to a defense attorney’s attack than is 
that of an informant.
Th e legality of placing an undercover oﬃ  cer in a high 
school to investigate student drug use was decided in 
 Gordon v. Warren Consolidated Board of Education (1983). 
High school oﬃ  cials had put an undercover oﬃ  cer into 
classes. Th e claimants alleged deprivation of their civil 
rights, but the federal district court dismissed the case for 
failure to state a cause of action. On appeal, the Supreme 
Court aﬃ  rmed the prior judgment, stating that the pres-
ence of the undercover oﬃ  cer did not constitute any more 
than a “chilling” eﬀ ect on the First Amendment right 
because it did not disrupt classroom activities or educa-
tion and had no tangible eﬀ ect on inhibiting expression 
of particular views in the classroom.
Undercover oﬃ  cers posing as prison inmates can 
acquire key information from other inmates suspected of 
other crimes. Th ey may also operate undercover online.
Grossi (2006, pp.42–44) oﬀ ers the following sugges-
tions when working undercover.
• • Adopt credible aliases. Keep your real ﬁ rst name and 
date of birth.
• • Whether you’re going to “carry” or not may be a mat-
ter of personal preference or an issue your agency 
addresses.
• • Choose your “garb” based on your assignment. Th e 
primary objective is to ﬁ t in with your target group.
• • Avoid the draw of the street, which can be overwhelm-
ing and even addicting.
• • Remember who you are. Nothing is worth compromis-
ing your integrity as a police oﬃ  cer.
like the law.” Unlike other forms of surveillance in which 
a prime objective is not to be observed, undercover sur-
veillants make personal contact with the subject using an 
assumed identity, or cover.
The objective of an undercover assignment may be to 
gain a person’s conﬁ dence or to inﬁ ltrate an organiza-
tion or group by using an assumed identity and to thereby 
obtain information or evidence connecting the subject 
with criminal activity.
Undercover assignments can be designed to
• • Obtain evidence for prosecution.
• • Obtain leads into criminal activities.
• • Check the reliability of witnesses or informants.
• • Gain information about premises for use in later con-
ducting a raid or an arrest.
• • Check the security of a person in a highly sensitive 
position.
• • Obtain information on or evidence against subversive 
groups.
Some undercover assignments are relatively simple 
and are referred to as ruses. Th e two general types of ruses 
are (1) deception as to identity—for example, posing as 
a drug dealer or prostitute, and (2) deception as to pur-
pose—for example, pretending to investigate a diﬀ erent 
person.
Many undercover assignments are more elaborate. 
Such undercover assignments are frequently made when 
criminal activity is greatly suspected or even known but 
no legal evidence of it exists. Such assignments can be 
extremely dangerous and require careful planning and 
preparation.
Th e undercover agent selected must ﬁ t the assign-
ment. Age, sex, race, general appearance, language 
facility, health, energy level, emotional stability and 
intelligence are all important selection considerations. 
Undercover agents must be good actors—able to assume 
their roles totally. Th ey must be intelligent and able to 
deal with any problems that arise, make quick decisions, 
improvise plans and actions and work with the person 
or within the group or organization without arousing 
suspicion. 
A good cover is essential. Rookies are often used 
because they are not yet known and because they have not 
been in law enforcement long enough to acquire expres-
sions or mannerisms that hardened criminals recognize 
as “the law.”
In addition to devising a good cover, the under-
cover agent learns everything possible about the subject, 

228 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
term purpose, it is diﬃ  cult to deﬁ ne precisely what a sting 
operation is. However, with some exceptions, all sting 
operations contain four basic elements:
 1. An opportunity or enticement to commit a crime, 
either created or exploited by police.
 2. A targeted likely oﬀ ender or group of oﬀ enders for a 
particular crime type.
 3. An undercover or hidden police oﬃ  cer or surrogate or 
some form of deception.
 4. A “gotcha” climax when the operation ends with arrests.
Sting operations target speciﬁ c crimes such as fenc-
ing and stolen property, drug dealing, sales of alcohol and 
tobacco to minors, prostitution, car theft, fraud and cor-
ruption and child pornography (Newman, 2007). Beneﬁ ts 
of sting operations include the facilitation of investiga-
tion and increased arrests, enhanced public relations and 
police image, enhanced police presence, improved col-
laboration between police and prosecutors, provision of 
an impressive conviction record, the possibility of success 
without convictions or arrests and the necessary part-
nering with community and business organizations that 
improves community relations by recovering stolen prop-
erty (Newman, p.viii). 
Stings also have their downside, including not reduc-
ing or preventing recurring crime problems, being expen-
sive, being deemed unethical by some and raising privacy 
and entrapment issues.
A controversial sting operation in New York City, 
Operation Lucky Bag, prompted charges of entrapment. 
The sting was started in 2006 and involved police offi-
cers leaving purses, bags or wallets on subway trains 
or other public places. If someone took the item, he or 
she was arrested. A spokesperson for the NYPD said, 
“Operation Lucky Bag is designed to combat the most 
frequently reported serious crime in the city’s tran-
sit system—grand larceny” (“Controversial New York 
Sting,” 2008, p.3). The executive director of the New 
York Civil Liberties Union has criticized the operation, 
calling it “worse than entrapment. Entrapment is set-
ting people up to engage in criminal activity to which 
they would not otherwise be disposed. This is setting 
people up to be Good Samaritans and then treating 
them like criminals.”
RAIDS
A  police raid is a planned, organized operation 
based on the element of surprise. Consider all 
other alternatives before executing a raid.
Haberman (2007, p.1) observes, “Th e very nature of 
this work can lead to nightmarish situations because, by 
deﬁ nition, undercover oﬃ  cers are supposed to meld into 
their surroundings.” It is vital that undercover investi-
gators keep accurate notes during their investigation, 
yet they must not allow the subject to be aware of such 
documentation.
Precautions for undercover agents:
• • Write no notes the subject can read.
• • Carry no identiﬁ cation other than the cover ID.
• • Ensure that any communication with headquarters is 
covert.
• • Do not suggest, plan, initiate or participate in 
criminal activity.
Th e ﬁ nal precaution warrants particular notice 
because regardless of how well planned and executed an 
undercover operation is, if the suspect can prove the crim-
inal action for which they were arrested resulted from a 
suggestion made by the undercover oﬃ  cer, the entire case 
may be jeopardized by a charge of entrapment.
ENTRAPMENT
Th e Supreme Court has deﬁ ned entrapment in Sorrells 
v. United States (1932) as “the conception and planning 
of an oﬀ ense by an oﬃ  cer, and his procurement of its 
commission by one who would not have perpetrated it 
except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the oﬃ  cer.” 
Sorrells also explained the need for trickery in obtaining 
evidence: “Society is at war with the criminal classes, and 
the courts have uniformly held that in waging this war-
fare the forces of prevention and detection may use traps, 
decoys and deception to obtain evidence of the commis-
sion of a crime.” Sorrells concludes, “Th e fact that gov-
ernment agents merely aﬀ ord opportunities or facilities 
for the commission of the oﬀ ense does not constitute 
entrapment.”
Th ese Court rulings still stand. In Sherman v. United 
States (1958), the Court explained, “Entrapment occurs 
only when the criminal conduct was ‘the product of the 
creative activity ’ of law enforcement oﬃ  cials. To deter-
mine whether entrapment has been established, a line 
must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent 
and the trap for the unwary criminal.”
STING OPERATIONS
Newman (2007, p.3) notes, “Because sting operations 
cover a wide variety of crimes and use diﬀ erent tech-
niques depending on the operation’s immediate or long-

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 229
be extremely dangerous, intend to use adequate ﬁ repower 
and personnel. Determine the required weapons and 
equipment. Plan for enough personnel to minimize vio-
lence, overcome opposition through superiority of forces 
and prevent the suspect’s escape or destruction of evi-
dence. Also anticipate that the suspect may have installed 
surreptitious surveillance devices or booby-trapped the 
premises to thwart intruders. Make sure all entrances and 
exits will be covered and that a communication system 
is established. Decide how to transport the raiding party 
to the scene and how to take the suspect or evidence and 
property away. Determine who will be in command during 
the raid.
Remember that other people may be in the vicinity of 
the raid. If possible, evacuate everyone from the area of 
the raid without making the suspect suspicious. It is not 
always possible to do this without losing the element of 
surprise vital to the success of the raid.
EXECUTING A RAID
“Surprise, shock and speed” can give oﬃ  cers a “leg up on 
the bad guys,” says Hamilton (2007, p.42). “You want 
to surprise your adversary, shock them so they can’t 
really react to you, and capitalize on it by attacking with 
speed.”
A raid should occur only after a careful brieﬁ ng of all 
members of the raiding party. Each participant must know 
the objective, who the suspect is or what evidence or prop-
erty is sought and the exact plan of the raid itself. Give 
each participant proper equipment such as body armor, 
weapons, radios, whistles, megaphones and signal lights. 
Give each participant a speciﬁ c assignment, and answer 
all questions about the raid before leaving the brieﬁ ng. 
Th e raid commander directs the raid, giving the signal to 
begin and coordinating all assignments.
Decisions about the initial entry and control phase 
of a raid must be made rapidly, because control is usually 
established within the ﬁ rst 15 to 30 seconds of a success-
ful raid. No two raids are executed in precisely the same 
manner. Th e immediate circumstances and events dictate 
what decisions and actions are made.
Handguns are still the most versatile weapon during 
a raid, but shotguns and other assault-type weapons are 
useful in the perimeter operations and to control arrested 
individuals. If guard animals are known to be inside the 
raid area, provide for their control. Special equipment such 
as sledgehammers or rams may help in breaking down for-
tiﬁ ed entrances. An ambulance should be on standby, or 
raid personnel should at least know the fastest route to 
the nearest hospital.
Because raids are highly visible, the public and the 
news media often take interest. Th erefore, raids are likely 
The objectives of a raid are to recover stolen property, 
seize evidence or arrest a suspect.
Sometimes all three objectives are accomplished in 
a single raid. Th e ﬁ rst consideration is whether there are 
alternatives to a raid. A second consideration is the legal-
ity of the raid.
A raid must be the result of a hot pursuit or be under the 
authority of a no-knock arrest or search warrant.
If you are in hot pursuit of a known felon and have 
no time to plan a raid, make sure enough personnel and 
weapons are available to reduce danger. Call for backup 
before starting the raid. If time permits, however, careful 
planning and preparation will enhance the likely success 
of the raid.
Planning, organizing and executing a raid are some-
what similar to undertaking a small military attack on a 
speciﬁ c target. Without careful planning, the results can 
be disastrous, as illustrated in the 1993 federal raid on the 
compound of the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas, in 
which 80 cult members were killed.
PLANNING A RAID
Begin planning a raid by gathering information on the 
premises to be raided, including the exact address and 
points of entry and exit for both the raiding party and the 
suspect. Obtain a picture or sketch of the building and 
study the room arrangement. Additional location infor-
mation might be obtained from aerial photographs, sur-
veillance photos, walking the neighborhood and the city 
planning department.
Next, study the suspect’s background. What crimes 
has the suspect committed? What diﬃ  culties were encoun-
tered in making past arrests? Is the suspect a narcotics 
addict? An alcoholic? Likely to be armed? If so, what type 
of weapon is the suspect likely to wield?
Obtain the appropriate warrants. Most raids are 
planned and result from an arrest warrant. In such cases, 
the subject is usually living under circumstances that 
necessitate a raid to make an arrest. In addition, if the 
raid is conducted to obtain evidence or property, obtain 
an exact description of the property sought, its likely loca-
tion on the premises, and a legal search warrant. Specify 
that you require a no-knock warrant to conduct the raid 
and perhaps a nighttime warrant to enhance the element 
of surprise.
Th roughout the entire planning process, keep the 
raid plan as simple as possible. Because the subject may 

230 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
SWAT TEAMS
Many police agencies have developed tactical squads, 
sometimes called special weapons and tactics (SWAT) 
teams, to execute raids. Th ese units, also called paramili-
tary police units (PPUs), are thoroughly trained to search 
areas for criminals, handle sniper incidents and hostage 
situations, execute arrest and search warrants and appre-
hend militants who have barricaded themselves inside a 
building or other location. 
SWAT was born on August 1, 1966, in Austin, Texas, 
when Charles Whitman went on a 96-minute shooting spree 
from the top of a tower at the University of Texas, killing 
15 people and wounding 31 before two Austin police oﬃ  -
cers were able to climb the tower and stop him: “Since then, 
police departments across the country have constructed 
SWAT units, and these teams have successfully stopped 
many felons and saved many lives” (Polan, 2008, p.36).
In the 1990s, two seemingly contradictory models 
of policing emerged: community-oriented policing (COP) 
and SWAT teams. COP is a philosophy that stresses com-
munity partnerships and proactive problem solving, in 
contrast to the militaristic, reactive approach used by 
SWAT teams to deal with high-risk situations. Such teams 
generally adhere to the approach used by General Colin 
Powell of being the “meanest dog in town.” According to 
the Powell Doctrine, force should be used sparingly, but if 
used, it should be used decisively.
In most jurisdictions, both approaches are needed 
depending on speciﬁ c circumstances, with community 
policing being the predominant approach, but with SWAT 
teams at the ready for emergency situations. 
to be the object of community praise or criticism. Th ey are 
also often vital to successfully prosecuting a case.
Precautions in conducting raids:
• • Ensure that the raid is legal.
• • Plan carefully.
• • Assign adequate personnel and equipment.
• • Thoroughly brief every member of the raiding party.
• • Be aware of the possibility of surreptitious 
surveillance devices or booby traps at the raid site. 
Drug busts and raids on crack houses have become 
increasingly common. In some instances, police have used 
front-end loaders and other tank-like vehicles to break 
through the walls of suspected crack houses. 
Th e Supreme Court has refused to review a lower 
court’s decision that an FBI raid on Representative 
 William J. Jeﬀ erson’s congressional oﬃ  ce violated the 
Constitution, a ruling that federal prosecutors fear could 
make lawmakers’ oﬃ  ces a “sanctuary for crime” (Barnes 
and Schmidt, 2008, p.A04). Th e Court decided not to get 
involved in the legal battle between the Justice Depart-
ment and Congress over the 2006 search of the Louisiana 
Democrat’s Washington oﬃ  ce, resulting in Jeﬀ erson being 
indicted on charges that he solicited more than $500,000 
in bribes: “A Justice spokeswoman said the department 
is disappointed that the court will not review the case. 
Th e government’s brief had said the lower court’s ruling 
also could endanger the use of wiretaps or searches of the 
‘homes, vehicles or briefcases’ of members of Congress” 
(Barnes and Schmidt).

oﬀ enses such as failing to wear a seatbelt were held to be 
constitutional. Atwater authorized police to arrest drivers 
of vehicles for violations punishable by only a monetary 
ﬁ ne, widening police authority in traﬃ  c-related stops.
In many states, an arrest may also be made by a “pri-
vate person” who witnesses a misdemeanor and then 
turns the suspect over to law enforcement authorities. 
Figure 7.6 shows a sample citizen’s arrest form.
If you have probable cause to believe a suspect has 
committed a felony and there is no time to obtain an 
arrest warrant, you can make an arrest without the war-
rant. Facts gathered after the arrest to justify probable 
cause are not legally admissible as evidence of probable 
cause. Th ey can, however, strengthen the case if probable 
cause was established before the arrest.
Probable cause for believing the suspect committed a 
crime must be established before a lawful arrest can 
be made.
An arrest for a felony or gross misdemeanor can usu-
ally be made any time if there is an arrest warrant or if 
the arresting oﬃ  cer witnessed the crime. An arrest may 
be made only in the daytime if it is by warrant, unless a 
magistrate has endorsed the warrant with a written state-
ment that the arrest may be made at night. Th is is com-
monly referred to as a nightcap provision.
Oﬃ  cers are allowed to break an inner or outer door 
to make an arrest after identifying themselves, stating 
the purpose for entry and demanding admittance. Th is 
is often necessary when oﬃ  cers are in plainclothes and 
hence not recognized as police. Th e courts have approved 
no-knock entries in cases in which the evidence would be 
immediately destroyed if police announced their inten-
tion to enter. Oﬃ  cers may break a window or door to 
leave a building if they are illegally detained inside. Th ey 
may break a door or window to arrest a suspect who has 
escaped from custody. Finally, oﬃ  cers may break an auto-
mobile window if a suspect rolls up the windows and locks 
the doors to prevent an arrest. You should give proper 
notiﬁ cation of the reason for the arrest and the intent 
to break the window if the suspect does not voluntarily 
comply.
You can accomplish the physical act of arrest by tak-
ing hold of or controlling the person and stating, “You 
are under arrest for . . .” In most jurisdictions the arrest-
ing oﬃ  cer’s authority must be stated, and the suspect 
must be told for what oﬀ ense the arrest is being made. In 
some cases, the apparent reason for the arrest turns out 
to be incorrect, with a diﬀ erent charge being brought. In 
Devenpeck v. Alford (2004), the Supreme Court ruled that 
an arrest is not rendered unlawful even if an arresting 
Davis (2007b, p.12) stresses, “Th e use of a police tacti-
cal team is a use of force . . . a very high proﬁ le use of force. 
Th e possibility of accident or injury always exists when a 
team of highly armed and motivated tactical operators 
rolls on a call. Add forced entry, distraction devices, long 
guns, movement through an unknown area, and hands-on 
control of suspects, and the chances for an intended or 
unintended injury or property damage increases.” Davis 
(2007a, p.12) also stresses, “No operation, regardless of 
how great or how small, should be performed without 
properly planning and rehearsing before execution.” A 
successful raid usually results in arrests.
LEGAL ARRESTS 
nce a suspect has been located and identiﬁ ed, 
 the next step is generally an arrest. Police 
powers to arrest (or search) are restricted by the Fourth 
Amendment, which forbids unreasonable searches or sei-
zures without probable cause. Just as state laws deﬁ ne and 
establish the elements of crimes, they also deﬁ ne arrest 
and establish who may make an arrest, for what oﬀ enses 
and when. Most state laws deﬁ ne an arrest in general 
terms as “the taking of a person into custody in the man-
ner authorized by law for the purpose of presenting that 
person before a magistrate to answer for the commission 
of a crime.” An arrest may be made by a police oﬃ  cer or a 
private citizen. It may be made with or without a warrant, 
although a warrant is generally preferred because this 
places the burden of proving that the arrest was illegal on 
the defense.
Police ofﬁ cers are authorized to make an arrest
• • For any crime committed in their presence.
• • For a felony (or for a misdemeanor in some states) 
not committed in their presence if they have 
probable cause to believe the person committed the 
crime.
• • Under the authority of an arrest warrant.
Most arrests are for misdemeanors such as disor-
derly conduct, drunkenness, traﬃ  c violations, minor lar-
ceny, minor drug oﬀ enses, simple assaults, nuisances and 
other oﬀ enses of lesser severity. In most states, the police 
oﬃ  cer must see such oﬀ enses to make an arrest without 
a warrant. In Atwater v. Lago Vista (2001), the Supreme 
Court allowed personally observed probable cause to per-
mit an arrest and custodial detention for a minor misde-
meanor. In other words, warrantless arrests for nonjailable 
O

for questioning. If bringing someone in for question-
ing appears to be an arrest without probable cause, even 
if the suspect is not told he’s under arrest, and even if 
the oﬃ  cers don’t personally consider him to be under 
arrest, the courts are likely to rule that the oﬃ  cers 
have, in eﬀ ect, made an illegal de facto arrest, that is, 
the functional equivalent of an arrest. As a result, the 
courts will suppress any evidence so obtained. At mini-
mum, the Supreme Court has ruled four times that if 
police take someone involuntarily to a police facility for 
investigation, this will be considered a de facto arrest. 
Th e ﬁ rst case was Davis v. Mississippi (1969), followed 
by Dunaway v. New York (1979), then Hayes v. Florida 
(1985) and more recently by Kaupp v. Texas (2003). If 
you are going to question the suspect, read the Miranda 
warning ﬁ rst.
oﬃ  cer’s probable cause for making it is not the same crim-
inal oﬀ ense for which the known facts provided probable 
cause. Th e Court held that although it is a “good police 
practice” to inform a person of the reason for his arrest 
at the time he is taken into custody, the Court has “never 
held that to be constitutionally required.”
Arresting a suspect requires that the Miranda warning 
be given before any questioning can occur. An arrest also 
starts the clock on the time limits within which a judge 
must review the case, usually within 48 hours (County of 
Riverside v. McLaughlin, 1991). Oﬃ  cers who postpone an 
arrest can conduct additional investigation before start-
ing the McLaughlin clock and can bolster their probable 
cause for arrest as well.
In some departments, it is common practice to take 
a suspect who is not under arrest to the department

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 233
allow the police in the absence of an emergency to arrest a 
person outside his home and then take him inside for the 
purpose of conducting a warrantless search.”
In the third case, Vale v. Louisiana (1970), police con-
ducting surveillance on Vale’s home saw him walk outside 
and sell drugs to people who drove up and honked. Th ey 
arrested Vale on the front steps of his house and then 
entered and searched the residence. In this case, the Court 
held, “If a search of a house is to be upheld as incident to 
arrest, that arrest must take place inside the house. Our 
past decisions make clear that only in a few speciﬁ cally 
established and well-delineated situations may a warrant-
less search of a dwelling withstand constitutional scrutiny. 
We decline to hold that an arrest on the street can provide 
its own exigent circumstance so as to justify a warrantless 
search of the arrestee’s house.”
Police do, however, have a right to maintain control 
over a suspect once he is arrested: “If the suspect is arrested 
outside his home and requests an opportunity to go back 
inside temporarily (such as to obtain bail money or ID, or 
to get a jacket or tell his family of his predicament), he is 
giving police implied consent to accompany him inside. If 
oﬃ  cers then see contraband or evidence in plain view, they 
have a right to seize it” (Rutledge, 2008, p.61).
ARRESTING A GROUP OF COMPANIONS
In Maryland v. Pringle (2003), an oﬃ  cer stopped a car for 
speeding. Th e three male occupants consented to a search 
of the vehicle, which turned up over $700 of rolled-up 
cash and ﬁ ve bags of cocaine. All three denied any knowl-
edge of the money and drugs, so the oﬃ  cer arrested all 
three, including Pringle. Th e Maryland state court held 
that absent speciﬁ c facts establishing Pringle’s control 
over the drugs, the oﬃ  cer’s mere ﬁ nding that it was in a 
car occupied by Pringle was insuﬃ  cient to justify probably 
cause to arrest. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, 
concluding that the oﬃ  cer had suﬃ  cient probable cause 
to arrest Pringle based on the information known to him 
at the time of arrest.
OFF-DUTY ARRESTS
Every department needs a policy that allows oﬀ -duty 
oﬃ  cers to make arrests. A suggested policy for oﬀ -duty 
arrests requires oﬃ  cers to
• • Be within the legal jurisdiction of their agency.
• • Not be personally involved.
• • Perceive an immediate need for preventing a crime or 
arresting a suspect.
• • Possess the proper identiﬁ cation.
If your intent is to make an arrest and you inform the 
suspect of this intent and then restrict the suspect’s right 
to go free, you have made an arrest.
Oﬃ  cers may also pursue a ﬂ eeing suspect to make a 
Terry-type  stop that could escalate into an arrest. In Illinois 
v. Wardlow (2000), the Supreme Court ruled that a person’s 
sudden ﬂ ight upon seeing a police oﬃ  cer can be used to 
establish reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop. 
Sometimes a suspect will refuse to identify himself or 
herself. Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s opinion in Hiibel 
v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada (2004), a state law 
requiring a subject to disclose his name during a Terry stop 
does not violate the Fourth Amendment’s ban on unreason-
able search and seizure (Bray, 2007, p.10): “Obtaining a sus-
pect’s name in the course of a Terry stop serves important 
government interests. Knowledge of identity may inform 
an oﬃ  cer that a suspect is wanted for another oﬀ ense, or 
has a record of violence or mental disorder. On the other 
hand, knowing identity may help clear a suspect and allow 
the police to concentrate their eﬀ orts elsewhere.”
If, during the Terry stop, an oﬃ  cer establishes prob-
able cause to arrest, and if the suspect resists, the oﬃ  cer 
may use force, but if he does, he may leave himself open 
to civil liability.
RESIDENTIAL ENTRY AFTER OUTDOORS 
ARREST
“Entry incident to outdoors arrest” is not on the list of lawful 
ways to get inside a residence (Rutledge, 2008, p.60). Th ree 
separate Supreme Court cases have held such entries to be 
unconstitutional. In James v. Louisiana (1965), the defen-
dant was lawfully arrested and then driven to his home 
more than two blocks away. Without a warrant, consent or 
an emergency, the oﬃ  cers entered and searched James’s 
home, ﬁ nding narcotics equipment and morphine. He was 
convicted, but on appeal, the Supreme Court held that the 
evidence was the result of an illegal entry and could not be 
used against him: “In the circumstances of this case, the 
search of defendant’s home cannot be regarded as incident 
to his arrest on a street corner more than two blocks away. 
A search can be ‘incident to an arrest’ only if it is substan-
tially contemporaneous with the arrest and is conﬁ ned to 
the immediate vicinity of the arrest” (Bray, p.11).
In Shipley v. California (1969), oﬃ  cers had staked out 
a suspect in an armed robbery and arrested him when he 
got out of his car in front of his home. Th ey took him inside 
and searched his home, ﬁ nding the stolen jewelry. In this 
case, the Court also reversed Shipley’s conviction: “Th e 
Constitution has never been construed by this Court to 

234 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
must choose between being charged with dereliction of 
duty if he does not arrest when he has probable cause, and 
being mulcted [penalized] in damages if he does. Although 
the matter is not entirely free from doubt, the same con-
sideration would seem to require excusing him from liabil-
ity for acting under a statute that he reasonably believed 
to be valid but that was later held unconstitutional on its 
face or as applied.”
USE OF FORCE
Th e most diﬃ  cult lawsuits to handle are those dealing 
with use of force. Physical force is not a necessary part of 
an arrest; in fact, most arrests are made without physical 
force. A 2001 study conducted by the International Asso-
ciation of Chiefs of Police (IACP) on use of force found that 
force of any kind was used only at a rate of 3.61 incidents 
per 10,000 calls for service. However, “It is an unfortunate 
reality that law enforcement oﬃ  cers around the world are 
often required to resort to some form of force in order to 
enforce the law, protect the public, and guard their own 
safety as well as that of innocent bystanders. Th is is par-
ticularly true in the United States” (Ruecker, 2007, p.6). 
Th e amount of resistance to arrest varies, and this 
determines how much force you should use. Slahor 
(2008b, p.75) notes, “Currently, one in 30 U.S. Police oﬃ  -
cers is being sued. For the past ﬁ ve years, 40 percent to 
45 percent of those cases involved allegations of excessive 
use of force.” 
When making an arrest, use only as much force as is 
necessary to overcome any resistance. If no resistance 
occurs, you may not use any force.
Deciding how much force to use in making an arrest 
requires logic and good judgment. However, in the heat 
of the moment, police oﬃ  cers may use more force than 
intended. Courts and juries have usually excused force 
that is not blatantly unreasonable, recognizing that many 
factors are involved in such split-second decisions.
Ederheimer and Fridell (2005, p.4) deﬁ ne force as 
“any non-negotiable use of police authority to inﬂ uence 
citizen behavior.” Reasonable force is the amount of 
force a prudent person would use in similar circum-
stances. Excessive force means more than ordinary 
force. Ederheimer and Fridell (p.4) characterize excessive 
force as “the illegal or unreasonable use of force, with rea-
sonableness determined by whether a reasonably prudent 
oﬃ  cer would have used the same amount of force in the 
same situation, in light of the information available to the 
oﬃ  cer at the time.” Use of excessive force (such as strik-
ing with a nightstick) is justiﬁ ed only when exceptional 
Unless all these conditions exist, oﬃ  cers should not 
make an arrest but should report the incident to their 
department for disposition.
AVOIDING CIVIL LIABILITY 
WHEN MAKING ARRESTS
ﬃ  cers should be aware of the situations in 
 which they may ﬁ nd themselves named in a 
lawsuit and should be aware of case law in these areas. 
Ofﬁ cers leave themselves open to lawsuits in several 
areas related to arrests, including false arrests, exces-
sive force, shootings and wrongful death.
FALSE ARREST
Police oﬃ  cers always face the possibility of false arrest. 
Some oﬃ  cers carry insurance to protect themselves 
against such lawsuits. Most are idle threats, however.
A false-arrest suit is a civil tort action that attempts 
to establish that an oﬃ  cer who claimed to have authority 
to make an arrest did not have probable cause at the time 
of arrest. Th e best protection is to be certain that probable 
cause to arrest does exist, to have an arrest warrant, or to 
obtain a conviction in court.
Even when the defendant is found not guilty of the 
particular oﬀ ense, a basis for a false-arrest suit is not auto-
matically established. A court will consider the totality of 
the circumstances at the time of the arrest and will decide 
whether they would lead an ordinarily prudent person to 
perceive probable cause and take the same action.
Police oﬃ  cers should know what the statute of limi-
tations, the time frame within which a claimant can ﬁ le 
a civil rights lawsuit, is for a federal claim for false arrest 
in their state (Scarry, 2007a, p.138). In Wallace v. Kato 
(2007), the Supreme Court ruled, in a 7 to 2 decision, that 
the correct starting point for a false-arrest claim in which 
criminal proceedings are initiated afterward is when a 
judge reviews the criminal charges against the defendant 
and binds them over for trial.
Police oﬃ  cers reduce the probability of valid false-
arrest actions by understanding the laws they enforce, 
the elements of each oﬀ ense and what probable cause is 
needed to prove each element. Police oﬃ  cers who hon-
estly believe they have probable cause for an arrest can 
use the “good-faith” defense, as established in Pierson v. 
Ray (1967): “A policeman’s lot is not so unhappy that he 
O

to look rough, kinda like Ultimate Fighting without the 
pay-per-view. A violent confrontation is never pretty and 
the public and the media need to be taught it ain’t a ‘beat-
ing’ just because the cop won! Use of force is ugly and 
eventually we need to educate the public to this. As cops, 
we have one rule . . . We win! And the community we pro-
tect needs to understand that.”
Oﬃ  cers should know their department’s policies 
regarding use of force. Further, uses of force in making 
arrests should be critiqued, and complaints of excessive 
force should be thoroughly reviewed.
Oﬃ  cers should also be aware of research ﬁ ndings 
about when force is most likely to be used. For example, 
some research has found that oﬃ  cers were signiﬁ cantly 
more likely to use higher levels of force with suspects 
encountered in disadvantaged neighborhoods and neigh-
borhoods with higher homicide rates. Other research sug-
gest that disrespectful suspects are more likely to have 
their behavior reciprocated, and some researchers con-
clude that force is most likely to be used when suspects 
show signs of alcohol or drug intoxication or engage in 
hostile behavior. Oﬃ  cers should be aware of this ﬁ nding 
and not take any disrespect shown to them too personally 
or be goaded into using more force than necessary. 
Most police departments know of oﬃ  cers who tend to 
become involved in resistance or violent situations more 
frequently than others. In some instances, these oﬃ  cers’ 
approach seems to trigger resistance. However, in any 
situation that is not out of control when you arrive, give a 
friendly greeting and state who you are and your author-
ity if you are not in uniform. Speak calmly and convey the 
impression that you are in control. Show your badge or 
identiﬁ cation and give your reason for the questioning. 
Ask for identiﬁ cation and listen to their side of the story. 
Th en decide on the appropriate action: Warn, release, 
issue a citation or make an arrest.
Although voluntary compliance is the “best” arrest, 
there are always situations that are not peaceful. In such 
cases, use only as much force as is necessary to overcome 
the resistance, progressing from control by empty-hand 
methods (defensive tactics) to the use of control agents 
(such as mace or tear gas) to the use of a police baton 
or—in the case of life-threatening resistance—deadly 
force.
Use-of-Force Continuums Force continuums were 
developed in the 1960s to train oﬃ  cers in use of force. 
Since that time, some 50 continuums have been developed 
(Peters and Brave, 2006, p.8). Most continuums are based 
on a suspect’s degree of resistance and specify what level 
of force is appropriate in response. Traditionally, use-of-
force continuums have been linear, going from no resis-
tance to aggravated aggression, as shown in Figure 7.7.
resistance occurs and there is no other way to make the 
arrest.
Th e landmark case on use of force, Graham v. Connor 
(1989), set parameters on use of force, which stated, “Our 
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized 
that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop 
necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of 
physical coercion or threat thereof to eﬀ ect it.” In Graham, 
the Court explained, “Th e reasonableness of a particular 
use of force must be judged from the perspective of a rea-
sonable oﬃ  cer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 
vision of hindsight.” Graham established ﬁ ve factors to 
evaluate alleged cases of excessive force:
• • Th e severity of the crime
• • Whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the 
oﬃ  cer or others
• • Whether the circumstances were tense, uncertain and 
rapidly evolving
• • Whether the suspect was attempting to evade arrest 
by ﬂ ight
• • Whether the suspect was actively resisting arrest
Graham v. Connor further held that plaintiﬀ s alleging 
excessive use of force need show only that the oﬃ  cer’s 
actions were unreasonable under the standards of the 
Fourth Amendment. 
In Saucier v. Katz (2001), the Supreme Court held 
that “the inquiry as to whether an arresting police oﬃ  cer 
is entitled to qualiﬁ ed immunity for the use of excessive 
force is distinct from the inquiry as to whether the use 
of force was objectively reasonable under Fourth Amend-
ment excessive force analysis.”
In the aftermath of the Rodney King case in Los 
Angeles and the alleged use of excessive force in other 
cities since then, much national attention has focused 
on the question of the deﬁ nition of excessive force. 
Sometimes the force used is obviously excessive and 
outrageous. For example, New York City police oﬃ  cer 
Justin Volpe admitted assaulting and sodomizing Abner 
Louima with a broomstick in an attempt to humiliate 
and intimidate the handcuﬀ ed Haitian immigrant. Oﬃ  -
cer Charles Schwartz was charged with holding down 
Louima during the assault.
Th e public is very aware of and sensitive to police 
use of force. Th e instantaneous decisions and actions 
by police oﬃ  cers at the scene are subject to long-term 
review by the public and the courts. Police departments 
must review their use-of-force policies to ensure that 
they are clear and in accordance with court decisions as 
well as eﬀ ective in ensuring oﬃ  cer safety. Smith (2006, 
p.80) questions, “When is the public going to learn that 
on video or not, winning a physical confrontation is going 

236 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
it is diﬃ  cult if not impossible to be sure which option is 
the greater and which is the lesser” (p.89). In an attempt 
to address this situation, some departments are shifting 
from linear to nonlinear models. 
One such circular model is a force wheel, with the 
spokes in the wheel representing a speciﬁ c type of force, 
as shown in Figure 7.8. Th is continuum avoids the 
implied stepwise progression of linear models, but such 
Note that the least amount of force relies on commu-
nication skills: “Communication has become a lost art, and 
some oﬃ  cers have begun to rely more on technology than 
on talking” (Ruecker, 2007, p.6). Oﬃ  cers must develop 
the communication skills necessary to resolve conﬂ icts, 
where possible, before force is necessary.
Critics of linear use-of-force continuums note that 
the continuums seem to imply that force events are pre-
dictable and escalate in an orderly fashion, when this is 
not reality. However, even if oﬃ  cers are taught that they 
can skip steps and go up and down on the continuum, 
linear continuums are sometimes explained in court as 
calling for such an orderly progression: “Th e actual law on 
the degree of allowable force is quite broad and very much 
in favor of oﬃ  cers. Legal standards such as those articu-
lated in Graham take numerous factors into account that 
continuums do not. . . . Nevertheless, some judges, juries 
and police administrators erroneously substitute the con-
tinuum standard for the constitutional legal standard or 
commingle the two standards when analyzing a use-of-
force event” (Peters and Brave, 2006, p.8). Means (2007, 
p.12) notes, “Because the use-of-force policies and linear 
continuum-type training models of many agencies require 
(or at least suggest) that the oﬃ  cer must use the least or 
minimum amount of force possible, they assist the plain-
tiﬀ  in his eﬀ ort to prove that the ‘greater’ amount of force 
used by the oﬃ  cer was unreasonable. . . Policy and training 
demands for the minimum or the least force possible are 
not mandated by law, at least not by federal constitutional 
law.” Means (p.14) observes, “In many use-of-force situa-
tions, several levels or types of force would all be reason-
able. Also, in respect to certain pairs of response options,

barricade resolution.” Few oﬃ  cers will be directly involved 
with using tear gas. Most will be involved in direct appli-
cations, generally involving a close-range oﬃ  cer-suspect 
engagement via belt-carried aerosol spray, most com-
monly pepper spray, also called oleoresin capsicum (OC) 
spray (Ijames). Pepper spray has been used for about 
20 years, and few oﬃ  cers go on duty without some type 
of OC product on their belt: “Pepper spray is very cost 
eﬀ ective, generally safe, easy to train with and use, and 
eﬀ ective about 81 percent of the time. As a result, pepper 
spray is considered by many to be the single most signiﬁ -
cant resistance-control and injury-reduction tool in law 
enforcement history” (Ijames, p.22). 
models otherwise provide little guidance to oﬃ  cers’ force 
decisions. 
One option on most force continuums is use of less-
lethal weapons.
LESS-LETHAL WEAPONS
Whether they are called less-than-lethal, less-lethal or 
nonlethal weapons, their intent is to avoid the use of 
deadly force. However, “Less-lethal does not imply never-
lethal. Munitions ﬁ red from most less-lethal weapons can 
cause death if vital areas are struck: head, eyes, throat and 
possibly the upper abdomen” (Page, 2007, p.144).
Discussing the use of non-lethal use-of-force options 
during an arrest, Ashley (2007a, p.72) notes, “Th at’s what 
you use the most, and they remain the most likely to get 
you hurt and/or sued: Th ere are dozens of non-lethal 
options out there, and probably hundreds of variations on 
each one. Generally, though, there are six basic options 
for controlling someone with non-lethal force/control. 
Your verbal/visual management of the scene, empty-hand 
control, restraints, aerosols, electronic control devices 
(ECDs) and impact weapons” (Ashley, p.71).
RESTRAINTS
Th e most commonly used restraint is handcuﬀ s. 
Handcuffs Police oﬃ  cers are usually trained that the 
best way to transport a suspect under arrest is to place 
handcuﬀ s on the person’s wrists with the person’s hands 
placed behind his or her back. Sometimes, when the hand-
cuﬀ s are removed, red marks, abrasions, bruising, numb-
ness and other injuries can be seen. Several courts have 
addressed the issue of whether tight handcuﬀ s can con-
stitute excessive force under the Fourth Amendment, but 
no general rule says handcuﬀ s must be loose or at what 
level they become “too tight” (Scarry, 2007b, p.50). Ashley 
(2007a, p.72) says, “Improper or sloppy use of handcuﬀ s, 
and sometimes failure to use them at all, has probably 
gotten more oﬃ  cers hurt and killed than any other com-
monly used law enforcement tool.” Departments typically 
train oﬃ  cers to double-lock the cuﬀ  to prevent the cuﬀ s 
from getting increasingly tighter if a suspect struggles in 
them. Double-locking keeps a routine arrest from pro-
gressing into a medical call (and a lawsuit) caused by cuﬀ s 
that have cut oﬀ  circulation to a suspect’s hands.
Aerosols Ijames (2007, p.22) explains, “Th e two pri-
mary concepts of chemical munitions deployment are 
space deprivation and direct application. Space depriva-
tion involves area contamination—as in outdoor riot 
situations—and enclosed space contamination—as in 
Technology Innovations
Stradley (2007a, p.32) describes an innovative 
less-lethal weapon using OC spray—TigerLight:
The TigerLight provides ofﬁ cers with the abil-
ity to respond to an immediate threat with OC 
spray that is built into the tail of a ﬂ ashlight tube. 
This makes the TigerLight a very effective less-
lethal weapon. . . . TigerLight has been shown to 
achieve compliance in 95 percent of deployments.
TigerLight is more effective than belt-carried 
OC spray because it is already in the ofﬁ cer’s hand 
at the point of the attack. The OC shot from the Tiger-
Light is also a surprise to most subjects. This means 
the subject has no warning that the spray is on the 
way. He cannot hold his breath and cover or close 
his eyes in an attempt to defeat the pepper spray.
Stradley (2007b, p.45) also states,
The TigerLight Non-Lethal Defense System is the 
most effective way to quickly deliver non-lethal force 
in the form of pepper spray that I’ve experienced. . . .
Even during daylight hours, the light is blind-
ing. When the light rotates out of the subject’s face, 
he automatically looks right at where he believes 
I am. The subject doesn’t prepare because he 
doesn’t know the pepper is coming . . .
The TigerLight is credited with achieving a 
25 percent decrease in signiﬁ cant force being 
used. . . . This is an effective tool for taking aggres-
sive, violent subjects into custody while reducing 
the likelihood of causing injury to them or risking 
injury to ourselves.

as the TASER getting the job done. Data reported from 
the ﬁ eld strongly suggests that it stops subjects in their 
tracks more frequently than any other incapacitation 
tool, including ﬁ rearms.
 
Also, the TASER works on people experienc-
ing a “mind-body” disconnect, who are incapable 
of feeling pain and complying accordingly. This is 
especially important today, as officers deal with an 
ever-increasing number of self-medicated or highly 
intoxicated subjects and those with a mental illness. 
These issues can reduce or eliminate perception of 
pain—which not surprisingly—limits the officers’ 
options in a resistance control world dominated with 
pain compliance techniques.
 
Oﬃ  cers engaging such people often ﬁ nd their con-
ventional eﬀ orts have little eﬀ ect, which can be prob-
lematic to say the least. Th ankfully, the TASER doesn’t 
rely on pain compliance, which has greatly assisted oﬃ  -
cers facing law enforcement’s most diﬃ  cult challenges. 
(Ijames, 2008, p.22)
TASER International has developed a new Extended 
Range Electronic Projectile (XREP) that can be delivered 
with a 12-gauge shotgun (Williams, 2007, p.40). Th e XREP 
uses wireless technology to deliver an electro-muscular 
disruption (EMD) eﬀ ect on a target at ranges beyond the 
handheld, hardwired TASERs. Another enhancement to 
the TASER X26 line is a camera accessory: “It records both 
black-and-white video and audio whenever the safety 
switch is ﬂ ipped oﬀ . It works even in zero-light condi-
tions. Th at means the TASER Cam™ is rolling whenever a 
TASER X26 is used. Th is will give law enforcement a tre-
mendous advantage in the courtroom. Based on the in-car 
video experience, when video evidence is available, 96.2 
percent of police oﬃ  cers are exonerated from misconduct 
allegations” (Rowe, 2007, p.35).
Ijames, author of the IACP’s model policy for CED use, 
comments, “CED is more valuable than any incapacitation 
tool I’ve ever seen because it stops people who don’t feel 
pain. Nothing else does that, except tools that kill people. . . . 
To equip oﬃ  cers with a means of non-lethal problem resolu-
tion, the CED is indispensable”  Garrett (2007, p.60).
Th e Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department 
(LVMPD) was involved in a TASER study with the 
hypothesis that the CED would reduce the number of 
oﬃ  cer-involved shootings, sparing oﬃ  cers the trauma 
of taking a life and increasing the community’s trust in 
police (Ault et al., 2007, p.4). Results of the study indi-
cated that oﬃ  cers armed with the CED were 75 percent 
less likely than were oﬃ  cers without the device to dis-
charge a ﬁ rearm. In addition, oﬃ  cers armed with CEDs 
were 90 percent less likely to deploy pepper spray. Th e 
study also found limited support for substituting CEDs 
for batons in situations where a suspect was openly 
aggressive toward the oﬃ  cers.
Impact Weapons Impact munitions are “specially 
designed projectiles that are made to strike a subject’s 
body causing non-lethal blunt trauma and incapacita-
tion” (Young, 2007, p.26). For example, “Th e LAPD bean-
bag platform is capable of controlling combative subjects 
without causing serious injury and without compromising 
oﬃ  cer safety” (Hudson and Webb, 2007, p.51).
Controlled Electronic Devices (CEDs) Controlled 
electronic devices (CEDs) are also called electronic control 
devices (ECDs). Th ese handheld devices operate by caus-
ing neuron-muscular incapacitation (NMI) resulting in a 
subject’s loss of motor function and, usually, consequent 
collapse to the ground (Guilbault, 2007b, p.42). Perhaps 
the best-known and most controversial less-lethal weapon 
is the TASER: 
Th e X26 TASER™ has taken American law enforcement 
by storm, with agencies reporting ‘full deployment’ 
being added almost every day. Few things are as certain 
Technology Innovations
Munson (2007, pp.86–91) describes the Pepper-
Ball FlashLauncher: 
The PepperBall® FlashLauncher™ is a handheld 
projectile launcher with a built-in LED ﬂ ashlight 
and laser aiming device, i.e., Flash(light) Launcher. 
The latest tool in PepperBall’s non-lethal armory, 
the FlashLauncher is an option for a wide variety 
of law enforcement tasks: knife-wielding standoffs 
and similar contact weapon barricades, control-
ling uncooperative or combative suspects, crowd 
control and civil disorder, cell extraction, domestic 
violence and suicide-by-cop scenarios. Flash-
Launcher appears to be an oddly shaped ﬂ ashlight 
and is rather inconspicuous to the untrained eye.
The FlashLauncher is a semi-auto launcher 
capable of ﬁ ring ﬁ ve projectiles in 2 to 4 seconds. 
The FlashLauncher uses a standard 12-grain CO2 
cartridge, available at any sporting goods store. 
Once a CO2 cartridge has been punctured, even 
if only one projectile has been ﬁ red, it must be 
replaced within a few hours.
The FlashLauncher has one extremely valu-
able feature. The CO2 cartridge is not punctured 
until the ﬁ rst shot. That means the device can 
be loaded and stored indeﬁ nitely without risk 
of a slow leak bleeding off pressure from the 
CO2 cartridge.

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 239
Ashley (2007a, p.75) cautions, “Beware of an over-
reliance on technology. Your weapons are useful tools, but 
never forget they can fail, and probably eventually will. 
When that time comes, be ready to react with another 
control option. And remember: What gets you sued is also 
what gets you hurt.”
Use of less-lethal alternatives is not required when use 
of deadly force is justiﬁ ed: “If you’re authorized by your 
agency and by law to use deadly force in a situation, your 
access to less-lethal equipment doesn’t mean that you must 
use it before using deadly force” (Kasanof, 2006, p.80). In 
fact, as Guilbault (2007a, p.42) notes, “Th e old saying, ‘Never 
bring a knife to a gunﬁ ght’ applies just as well for a TASER. 
It is not a replacement for a gun.” He stresses, “Never bring 
a TASER to a gunﬁ ght. Drawing a TASER when you need 
your duty weapon can be a fatal mistake” (p.40).
USE OF DEADLY FORCE
From 2003 to 2006, 47 states and the District of Colum-
bia reported 2002 arrest-related deaths. Of these, 1,095 
were individuals killed by law enforcement (Mumola, 
2007, p.1).
Police oﬃ  cers carry guns and are trained in using 
them. Th ey also have department policy on deadly force 
as a guide. Unfortunately, the point of last resort may be 
immediate because many police situations rapidly deteri-
orate to the point of deadly force decision making. When 
such situations occur, they must be viewed in the light of 
both department policies and the individual situation.
Department policies on deadly force should be 
reviewed periodically in the light of the most recent 
Researchers White and Ready (2007) studied the use 
of TASERs, analyzing 243 incidents involving primarily 
emotionally disturbed persons showing signs of violence 
at the time of arrest. White and Ready found that 85 
percent of the suspects were incapacitated by use of the 
TASER and arrested without further incident.
Ho (2007a, p.32), after reviewing the literature, con-
cludes, “Current research on both animals and humans 
shows that TASERs are among the safest cop weapons.” 
Sanow (2007, p.6) echoes, “Th e TASER is probably the 
best less-lethal weapon in the police toolbox. Th at state-
ment is not a product endorsement. Instead, it is a 
summary of use-of-force and litigation statistics from 
agencies all across the country. Th e facts are the TASER 
has the fastest eﬀ ectiveness, fastest subject recovery 
time, lowest rate of oﬃ  cer injury, lowest rate of subject 
injury and the least liability to the department of the 
force options.” 
Despite claims of its eﬀ ectiveness, “Currently the 
TASER represents the most controversial tool in the use-
of-force continuum” (Th ompson, 2006, p.9). Headlines 
implicating the use of a TASER in deaths cause concern 
among citizens: “Th e public believes that TASERs kill, and 
something must be done to change their minds. . . . Almost 
every TASER death has involved a cocaine overdose, but 
that’s never the headline” (Griﬃ  th, 2007, p.12).
One way to overcome public opposition is to have 
eﬀ ective policies for the use of ECDs that address such 
issues as using ECDs on high-risk individuals, limiting the 
number of applications, placement of ECDs on the force 
continuum, medical evaluations after exposure and the 
like (Staton, 2008, p.93). Recognizing this need, Cronin 
and Ederheimer (2006), with the collective eﬀ orts of the 
Police Executive Research Forum and the Department of 
Justice, developed Conducted Energy Devices: Standards 
for Consistency and Guidance: Th e Creation of National CED 
Police and Training Guidelines, an invaluable resource for 
those wanting to learn more about CEDs.
Other Less-Lethal Options Capture nets have been an 
alternative for subduing combative suspects for decades. 
A modern version is the Super Talon™ net gun: 
Th e net deploys at 22 feet per second. Of course, it 
slows down as it spreads out and as it travels down 
range. Th e minimum range at which the Super Talon 
may be ﬁ red at a subject is 15 feet due to net spread. 
Th e ideal deployment range is between 20 and 30 feet.
 
In the best case, the use of the net gun protects 
the oﬃ  cer from direct physical contact with the violent 
oﬀ ender until the suspect is ensnared and at least par-
tially subdued. Unique among less-lethal options, the 
net gun allows the capture of two, or even three, closely 
spaced suspects. (Munson, 2008, p.88)
Technology Innovations
Another innovation ﬁ nding its way into law 
enforcement is acoustic technology (Borrello, 2007, 
p.50): 
Acoustical weapon technology is basically the 
development of a directional system that can 
deliver a focused pulse of sound at such a high 
decibel (dB) level that it becomes intolerable for 
the target to bear. An air raid siren blasts sound at 
about 130 dB. The human threshold of pain is about 
140 dB, which is considered the danger level for 
one’s hearing. Sound weapons can send focused 
and sustained sound down range in excess of 146 
dB, which is nearly the auditory equivalent to the 
roar of a jet turbine.

240 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
showing that oﬃ  cer reaction times are signiﬁ cantly longer 
than commonly believed: 
Th e Force Science Research Center has shown that it 
takes the average oﬃ  cer about half a second to per-
ceive a threat and approximately another half second 
to decide what to do about it. All of this has to happen 
before the oﬃ  cer begins his or her draw stroke. What 
this means is that with the threat closing at 7 feet per 
half second, we are closer to a 35-foot rule.
 
And it is extremely diﬃ  cult to smoothly draw and 
accurately ﬁ re when under a life-threatening attack. So 
that means that we had better add another 10 feet to 
allow for the attacker to keep coming if we miss center 
mass or even if we hit him, even mortally wound him, 
but he doesn’t go down.
 
It’s now the 45-foot rule. (Irwin, 2007, p.83)
Another life-threatening misconception often held by 
oﬃ  cers is the inevitability of a lawsuit following the draw 
of their service weapon: “Unwarranted concerns about 
legal liability cloud the thinking and thus the survival of 
too many oﬃ  cers. I have heard oﬃ  cers say they will not use 
their ﬁ rearm because they fear being sued. Th ese oﬃ  cers 
are essentially saying they are more afraid of being sued 
than murdered” (Chudwin, 2006, p.78).
In some deadly force incidents, oﬃ  cers have had sus-
pects attempt to grab the oﬃ  cers’ sidearms to use against 
them.
In situations that involve a ﬂ eeing felon, oﬃ  cers must 
assess the situation rapidly, considering the law, depart-
ment policy and the speciﬁ c existing conditions. An oﬃ  cer 
need not wait to see a ﬂ ash from a suspect’s gun muzzle 
before taking action. On the other hand, the Garner deci-
sion caused policy changes in many departments that had 
previously approved shooting ﬂ eeing felons under all cir-
cumstances, including unarmed ﬂ eeing felons.
Whether to use deadly force is a major and diﬃ  cult 
decision for police oﬃ  cers. When it should be used is gen-
erally deﬁ ned in state statutes, but in any case of use of 
deadly force, the suspect must be threatening the life of 
an oﬃ  cer or another person.
One consideration not to be overlooked is the psycho-
logical eﬀ ect on an oﬃ  cer who has shot a suspect. Based 
on his 20-year study of deadly force, Brubaker (2002, p.8) 
reports, “Th e majority of oﬃ  cers commented that they 
were not prepared for the psychological impact upon 
themselves, their families and their departments.” He 
says, “One oﬃ  cer summed it up best when he said, ‘All 
oﬃ  cers should have training and knowledge concerning 
the post shooting experience. All oﬃ  cers need to know 
when you pull that trigger, your department and family 
also are pulling it’” (p.13). In addition, “An oﬃ  cer-involved 
shooting certainly has immediate eﬀ ects, but it also has 
Supreme Court decisions. Policies must be restrictive 
enough to limit unreasonable use of deadly force but not 
so restrictive that they fail to protect the lives of oﬃ  cers 
and members of the community. 
Use of a deadly weapon is carefully deﬁ ned by state 
laws and department policy. Such policies usually per-
mit use of a gun or other weapon only in self-defense or 
if others are endangered by the suspect. Some policies 
also permit use of a deadly weapon to arrest a felony 
suspect, to prevent an escape or to recapture a felon 
when all other means have failed. Warning shots are not 
usually recommended because they can ricochet, harm-
ing others.
Th e landmark case on use of deadly force is the 
Supreme Court ruling in Tennessee v. Garner (1985), 
where the Court ruled, “It is not better that all felony sus-
pects die than that they escape. Where the suspect poses 
no immediate threat to others, the harm resulting from 
failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly 
force to do so. It is no doubt unfortunate when a suspect 
who is in sight escapes, but the fact that the police arrive a 
little late or are a little slower afoot does not always justify 
killing the suspect.”
In this case, the Court banned law enforcement oﬃ  -
cers from shooting to kill ﬂ eeing felons unless an immi-
nent danger to life exists. Th is ruling invalidated laws in 
almost half the states that allowed police oﬃ  cers to use 
deadly force to prevent the escape of a suspected felon. In 
this case, police shot and killed an unarmed 15-year-old 
boy who had stolen $10 and some jewelry from an unoc-
cupied house. Th e Court ruled, “A police oﬃ  cer may not 
seize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him 
dead.”
Th e Garner decision did not take away police oﬃ  -
cers’ right to use deadly force. Th e Court acknowledged 
legitimate situations in which deadly force is not only 
acceptable but also necessary: “Where the oﬃ  cer has 
probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat 
of serious physical harm, either to the oﬃ  cer or to oth-
ers, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent 
escape by using deadly force. Th us, if the suspect threat-
ened the oﬃ  cer with a weapon or there is probable cause 
to believe that he had committed a crime involving the 
inﬂ iction or threatened inﬂ iction of serious physical 
harm, deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent 
escape and if—where feasible—some warning has been 
given.”
Th e “21-foot rule” in using deadly force states that 
a knife-wielding attacker could be as far away as 21 feet 
and still stab the oﬃ  cer before he could eﬀ ectively ﬁ re 
his handgun (Irwin, 2007, p.82). Irwin quotes research by 
Lewinski and Fackler of the Force Science Research Center 

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 241
disproportionately large, extremely agitated, threatening 
violence, talking incoherently, tearing oﬀ  clothes, and it 
takes four or ﬁ ve oﬃ  cers to get the attention of that indi-
vidual and bring him out of harm’s way—that’s excited 
delirium.” Other signs and symptoms that might indicate 
excited delirium include elevated body temperature, para-
noia, constant motion, inappropriate and often violent 
behavior and feats of incredible strength (Ho, 2007b, 
p.28). Oﬃ  cers recognizing such symptoms should imme-
diately call for help. Because of the potential for lawsuits 
in such cases, it is imperative that oﬃ  cers know how to 
investigate such deaths immediately. Investigating in-
custody deaths is discussed in Chapter 8.
Use of Force and the Mentally Ill Dealing with people 
who are mentally ill or otherwise emotionally disturbed 
can present a use-of-force challenge. Use of less-lethal 
weapons may contain the situation or worsen it. Research-
ers Swartz and Lurigio (2007, p.581) studied the relation-
ships among psychiatric disorders, substance use and 
arrests for violent, nonviolent and drug-related oﬀ enses 
and found that the statistical association between serious 
mental illness (SMI) and arrest across psychiatric diagno-
ses was substantially but only partially mediated by sub-
stance use. For nonviolent oﬀ enses and for drug-related 
oﬀ enses, the relationship between SMI and arrest was 
almost completely mediated by substance use, reduced 
to statistical nonsigniﬁ cance: “Th ese ﬁ nding suggest that 
co-occurring substance use increases the chances a person 
with any SMI, not just schizophrenia, will be arrested for 
any oﬀ ense, not just violent oﬀ enses, but that the magni-
tude of this relationship varies by oﬀ ense type and, to a 
lesser extent, by disorder” (Swartz and Lurigio).
Many of the violent individuals the police encounter 
are mental patients who have stopped their treatment 
plans (Moore, 2006, p.134). For example, with the shoot-
ings at Northern Illinois University, the shooter had a 
long history of mental illness and had recently stopped 
taking antidepressant medication. Currently, an esti-
mated 3.5 million Americans suﬀ er from some form of 
severe mental illness, and research suggests that police 
often see the mentally ill as more dangerous than other 
suspects are. In fact, those with mental illness are often 
unfairly portrayed as violent: “It is wrong to tar all emo-
tionally disturbed individuals with the same stereotype-
tainted brush” (Pies, 2008).
One method used in responding to calls involving 
emotionally disturbed individuals is the deployment 
of a crisis intervention team (CIT). Th e Memphis Police 
Department established training under the CIT model in 
1998, stressing communication and de-escalation. Many 
departments have adopted the model across the country. 
many long-term eﬀ ects in the criminal, civil, administra-
tive, media and public sectors involved in the aftermath” 
(Slahor, 2008a, p.12).
Everyone understands that force should be used as 
a last resort. Use other less-lethal means when you have 
opportunity and time. Millions of arrests—many with the 
potential for use of deadly force—have been made with-
out such force. Yet, even when oﬃ  cers try every possible 
means to avoid using deadly force, the actions of the sub-
ject or suspect may demand a response with deadly force.
“Ramming” in Pursuit as Use of Force Th e inten-
tional collision of a law enforcement oﬃ  cer’s vehicle 
with another constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure 
and requires objective reasonableness at the time of the 
seizure (Risher, 2007, p.10). Th is issue was addressed in 
Scott v. Harris (2007), a case that resulted when Victor 
Harris ignored the blue lights and siren of Deputy Tim-
othy Scott, who was trying to stop Harris for speeding. 
Harris led oﬃ  cers on a 6-minute, 10-mile chase at speeds 
exceeding 85 miles per hour on mostly two-lane roads. 
Th e Eleventh Circuit Court ruled that the facts and cir-
cumstances did not justify use of deadly force, focusing 
on Harris’s “crime” as speeding. When the case reached 
the Supreme Court, it focused on the “relative culpabil-
ity” in balancing the nature and quality of the intrusion 
against the importance of the government interest. Th e 
Court concluded that the motoring public in the area was 
innocent; Harris, however, was culpable because he, by 
initiating the chase, had placed himself and others in dan-
ger. Th e case is signiﬁ cant in several respects: “First, the 
Court is willing to consider raw evidence (in this case, the 
recording of the chase) rather than reserving the factual 
determinations for the jury in a case where the objective 
recording eliminates any genuine issue of material facts. 
In addition, the Fourth Amendment does not require 
oﬃ  cers to abandon a pursuit when the pursued drives so 
recklessly as to endanger others” (Risher, p.11).
In-Custody Death: Excited Delirium When a person 
suddenly dies in police custody, it is often called excited 
delirium. Th is is not a medical diagnosis but, rather, a set 
of behaviors making up the conditions (Sullivan, 2007). 
Kulbarsh (2007) notes, “Th ere is no medical or psychiatric 
diagnosis of excited delirium. Th e International Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police has not acknowledged the syn-
drome, either. It is the subject’s behavior that indicates 
the syndrome. However, annually, excited delirium is 
increasingly determined to be the cause of in-custody 
deaths.”
Sullivan (2007) quotes Deborah Mash, a professor of 
neurology at the University of Miami: “Someone who’s 

242 | SECTION 2 | Basic Investigative Responsibilities
to his or her own fate. Williams (2003, p.67) notes that 
almost all such deaths involve alcohol intoxication, being 
under the inﬂ uence of drugs or being mentally ill. All also 
involve emotionally charged circumstances. In addition, 
all involve either violence, threatened violence, or pres-
ence of a weapon that ends up with the police becoming 
involved.
Often when a law enforcement oﬃ  cer uses deadly 
force, a lawsuit will almost certainly follow. Th at under-
scores the criticality of use-of-force reports.
USE-OF-FORCE REPORTS
As has been stressed, thorough, accurate, well-written 
reports are critical to the investigator. Litigation has 
prompted a push for precision in describing what hap-
pened during the incident in a use-of-force report and 
diﬀ erentiating between trained techniques and “street 
ﬁ ghting” (Robinson, 2006, p.30). 
Language intended to convey precision and pro-
fessionalism may sound like euphemisms to a jury, as 
though the oﬃ  cer is being evasive (Robinson, 2006, 
p.31). Instead, oﬃ  cers need to articulate their use of force 
in everyday language to show the reasonableness of their 
actions (Robinson, p.32). For example, rather than writ-
ing “I decentralized the subject,” the oﬃ  cer might have 
written, “I used a  push-in/pull-down technique to take 
Mr. Jones to the ground, while verbally commanding him 
to get down.” Robinson concludes, “A good report can 
make an excessive-force lawsuit less likely to be ﬁ led in 
the ﬁ rst place, and, if it does go to court, less likely to be 
successful. . . . We have a duty to teach oﬃ  cers to use force 
eﬀ ectively so they can survive on the street. If we don’t 
also teach them to report it eﬀ ectively, they may not sur-
vive in court.”
CIT oﬃ  cers are taught to recognize the various psychiat-
ric syndromes, the biologic basis for severe mental illness, 
de-escalation of crisis situations, the law pertaining to the 
detention of the mentally ill, and access to emergency and 
nonemergency mental health services (Tactical Response 
Team Staﬀ , 2006, p.54). According to Anderson (2006, 
p.14), “CIT is not just about training. It is about building 
relationships between law enforcement and the mental 
health community and working together to improve the 
eﬀ ectiveness of the response to mental health 911 calls. 
CIT is about humanizing people with mental illness and 
understanding that mental illness is ﬁ rst and foremost a 
health care problem.”
Sanow (2006, p.6) suggests, “Th e CIT oﬃ  cer will save 
your department money starting right oﬀ  by fewer incar-
cerations, and all that expense. Th ere will be fewer uses of 
force and lower levels of force used. Fewer oﬃ  cer and sub-
ject injuries. Fewer repeat calls and hospital transports. 
Less court time and fewer lawsuits. With the CIT on scene, 
the right people go to jail, the right people go to the hospi-
tal, and the right people get released to their families.”
When individuals who are mentally ill force police 
oﬃ  cers into shooting them, the question often arises, Is 
this a case of suicide by cop?
Suicide by Police Suicide by police is a phenomenon in 
which someone intentionally acts so threatening toward 
oﬃ  cers as to force them to ﬁ re, accomplishing the subject’s 
ultimate goal of dying, albeit not by his or her own hand.
Sometimes it seems very implausible that a person 
really wants to die in what appears to be a suicide-by-cop 
situation. Such instances have been presented as “death 
by indiﬀ erence.” When it seems that suicide by cop is 
not probable, investigators should consider the possi-
bility of death by indiﬀ erence by an oﬀ ender apathetic 

CHAPTER 7 | Identifying and Arresting Suspects | 243
can be tight or close, loose, rough, on foot or by vehicle. 
Electronic surveillance and wiretapping are considered 
forms of search and therefore are permitted only with 
probable cause and by direct court order (Katz v. United 
States, 1967).
 
Th e objective of an undercover assignment may be 
to gain a person’s conﬁ dence or to inﬁ ltrate an organiza-
tion or group by using an assumed identity and to thereby 
obtain information or evidence connecting the subject 
with criminal activity. If you are working undercover, 
write no notes the subject can read; carry no identiﬁ ca-
tion other than the cover ID; make sure any communica-
tion with headquarters is covert; and do not suggest, plan, 
initiate or participate in any criminal activity.
 
Th e objective of a raid is to recover stolen property, 
seize evidence or arrest a suspect. To be legal, a raid 
must be the result of a hot pursuit or under authority of 
a no-knock arrest warrant or a search warrant. Precau-
tions in conducting raids include ensuring that the raid 
is legal, planning carefully, assigning adequate person-
nel and equipment, thoroughly brieﬁ ng every member 
of the raiding party and being aware of the possibility of 
surreptitious surveillance devices or booby traps at the 
raid site.
 
An arrest may occur at any point during an investiga-
tion. Police oﬃ  cers are authorized to make an arrest (1) for 
any crime committed in their presence, (2) for a felony (and 
in some states for a misdemeanor) not committed in their 
presence if they have probable cause to believe the person 
committed the crime or (3) under the authority of an arrest 
warrant. A lawful arrest requires that probable cause for 
believing the suspect committed a crime be established 
before the arrest.
 
If your intent is to make an arrest and you inform 
the suspect of this intent and then restrict the suspect’s 
right to go free, you have made an arrest. Oﬃ  cers leave 
themselves open to lawsuits in several areas related to 
arrests, including false arrests, excessive force, shootings 
and wrongful death. When making an arrest, use only as 
much force as is necessary to overcome any resistance. If 
no resistance occurs, you may not use any force.
Identifying and Arresting 
Suspects
• • Was a suspect observed by police on arrival at the 
scene?
• • Was a suspect arrested at the scene?
• • Was anyone observed at the scene by any other 
person?
CHECKLISTS
Developing, locating, identifying and arresting suspects 
are primary responsibilities of investigators.
 
Field or show-up identiﬁ cation is on-the-scene identi-
ﬁ cation of a suspect by a victim of or witness to a crime. 
To be admissible, ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation must be made shortly 
after a crime is committed, usually within 15 to 20 minutes. 
Suspects do not have the right to counsel at a ﬁ eld identiﬁ -
cation (United States v. Ash, Jr., 1973).
 
If the suspect is not immediately identiﬁ ed, you must 
develop a suspect through information provided by vic-
tims, witnesses and other people likely to know about 
the crime or the suspect; physical evidence at the crime 
scene; psychological proﬁ ling; through information in 
police ﬁ les; information in other agencies’ ﬁ les; or infor-
mants. Help witnesses describe suspects and vehicles by 
asking very speciﬁ c questions and using an identiﬁ cation 
diagram.
 
Suspects can be identiﬁ ed through ﬁ eld identiﬁ ca-
tion, mug shots, photographic identiﬁ cation or lineups. 
Use ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation when the suspect is arrested at or 
near the scene. Use mug-shot identiﬁ cation if you believe 
the suspect has a police record. Use photographic identiﬁ -
cation when you are reasonably sure who committed the 
crime but the suspect is not in custody or a fair lineup can-
not be conducted. Th e pictures should portray at least ﬁ ve 
people of comparable race, height, weight, age and general 
appearance. Tell witnesses they need not identify anyone 
from the photographs. A suspect does not have the right 
to a lawyer if a photographic lineup is used (United States 
v. Ash, Jr., 1973).
 
Use lineup identiﬁ cation when the suspect is in cus-
tody. Again, use at least ﬁ ve people of comparable race, 
height, weight, age and general appearance. Ask them all 
to perform the same actions or speak the same words. 
Instruct those viewing the lineup that they need not make 
an identiﬁ cation. Suspects may refuse to participate in a 
lineup, but such refusal may be used against them in court 
(Schmerber v. California, 1966). Suspects have a right to 
have an attorney present during a lineup (United States 
v. Wade, 1967). Avoid having the same person make both 
photographic and lineup identiﬁ cation. If you do so, do 
not conduct both within a short time.
 
Some investigations reach a point after which no 
further progress can be made without using surveillance, 
undercover agents or a raid. Before taking any of these 
measures, you should exhaust all alternatives.
 
The objective of surveillance is to obtain informa-
tion about people or their associates and activities that 
may help solve a criminal case or protect witnesses. 
Surveillance can be stationary (fixed, plant or stake-
out) or moving (tail or shadow). Moving surveillance

Crime and Evidence 
in Action
Select one of three criminal case scenarios and 
sign in for your shift. Your Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) 
will get you started and update you throughout the case. 
During the case, you’ll become a patrol oﬃ  cer, detective, 
prosecutor, defense attorney, judge, corrections oﬃ  -
cer or parole oﬃ  cer to conduct interactive investigative 
research. Each case unfolds as you respond to key decision 
points. Feedback for each possible answer choice is packed 
full of information, including term deﬁ nitions, Web links 
and important documentation. Th e sergeant is available 
at certain times to help mentor you, the Online Resources 
Web site oﬀ ers a variety of information and be sure to 
take notes in your e-notebook during the suspect video 
statements and at key points throughout (these notes can 
be saved, printed or e-mailed). Th e Forensics Exercise will 
test your ability to collect, transport and analyze evidence 
from the crime scene. At the end of the case, you can track 
how well you responded to each decision point and join 
the Discussion Forum for a postmortem. Go to the CD 
and use the skills you’ve learned to solve a case.

he Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) 
Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) contains statis-
tics on eight types of serious crimes, previously called 
Index offenses: murder, aggravated assault, forcible 
rape, robbery, burglary, larceny/theft, motor vehicle 
theft and arson. In years past, data were collected for 
each of these offenses and published in an annual UCR 
to serve as a national barometer of crime in the United 
States. However, as noted (FBI, Uniform Crime Report),
In June 2004, the CJIS [Criminal Justice Information Sys-
tem] Advisory Policy Board (APB) approved discontinuing 
the use of the Crime Index in the UCR Program and its 
publications. The CJIS APB recommended that the FBI 
publish a violent crime total and a property crime total 
until a more viable index is developed. In recent years, the 
Crime Index has not been a true indicator of the degree of 
criminality of a locality. The Crime Index was calculated 
by adding the totals of seven Part I crimes. (The Modiﬁ ed 
Crime Index included arson.) Currently, larceny-thefts 
account for almost 60 percent of the total crimes reported. 
Consequently, the volume of larcenies overshadows more 
serious but less frequently committed crimes.
 
Thus, while previous editions of this text discussed 
crime statistics in the context of the Crime Index, this 
edition simply divides such data into two categories—
violent crime and property crime. This section looks at 
violent crime; property crime is the focus of Section 4.
 
According to the Uniform Crime Reports for 2006 
(Crime in the United States 2006), a violent crime 
occurred nationally every 22.2 seconds:
• • 1 robbery every 1.2 minutes
• • 1 aggravated assault every 36.6 seconds
• • 1 forcible rape every 5.7 minutes
• • 1 murder every 30.9 minutes
 
FBI data also indicate that an estimated 1,417,745 
violent crimes were committed in the United States 
in 2006, representing an increase of 1.9 percent 
from the 2005 violent crime count. The 5-year trend 
T
INVESTIGATING 
VIOLENT CRIMES

(2006 compared with 2002) indicated that violent crime 
decreased 0.4 percent. For the 10-year period (2006 
compared with 1997), violent crime fell 13.3 percent. As 
in previous years, aggravated assaults comprised the 
largest portion of violent crime in 2006 at 60.7 percent, 
followed by robbery (31.6 percent), forcible rape (6.5 
percent) and murder (1.2 percent). According to 
Crime in the United States 2006
The occurrence of violent crime throughout the nation in 
2006 was estimated at a rate of 473.5 violent offenses per 
100,000 inhabitants.
 
Firearms were used in 67.9 percent of the nation’s 
murders, in 42.2 percent of the robbery offenses and in 21.9 
percent of the aggravated assaults. (Weapon data are not 
collected for forcible rape.)
 
The decade-long trend of a decrease in violent 
crime ended in 2004 and the increase continued 
through 2006, as shown in Figure III-1. These increases 
raise concerns: “The world is experiencing a crime

pandemic. Crime rates are on the rise almost every-
where, and these crime statistics typically are distinct 
from the death and mayhem that comes with terrorism, 
civil war or major conﬂ ict. The data reﬂ ect the boom-
ing number of civilians assaulted, robbed or murdered 
by other civilians who live in the same city, often in the 
same neighborhood. Frequently the victims are as poor 
as the criminals” (Naim, 2007).
 
However, FBI statistics show, “The number of vio-
lent crimes reported nationwide appears to have fallen 
modestly in the ﬁ rst half of 2007, signaling the ﬁ rst 
notable decline in violence in two years” (Eggen, 2008, 
p.A02).
 
Caution must be used when interpreting such ﬁ g-
ures, however, as they do not include crime data for 
categories not included in the UCR program and under-
represent the true extent of violent crime.
 
Another measure of crime is achieved through the 
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which 
tallied 3.7 million crimes of violence in 2006 (Rand and 
Catalano, 2007, p.1). The overall violent crime rate was 
23.3 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older. 
Note the difference between the ﬁ ndings of these two 
national measures of crime in the United States.
 
Investigating violent crimes is made more difﬁ cult 
by the emotionalism usually encountered not only from 
the victim but also from the public. Generally, however, 
investigating violent crimes results in more and better 
information and evidence than investigating crimes 
against property, discussed in Section 4.
 
Although states vary in what elements must be 
proven in a given crime, some common elements exist, 
as shown in Figure III-2.
 
In recent years, violent-crime investigations 
have been enhanced by the establishment of the Vio-
lent Crime Apprehension Program (VICAP) at the FBI 
National Police Academy in Quantico, Virginia: “VICAP 
is a national database on crimes of violence. VICAP’s 
Essential elements as required
by the statutes of each state:
• proof of the harm done (death, etc.)
• proof of the age of the victim
• other essential elements required
 by statute
Possession
(either actual
or constructive)
can be an essential
element of a crime.
Scienter can be made
an essential element of
a crime.
Mens rea
(the guilty mind)
can be made an
essential element
of a crime.
A forbidden act
or omission
(actus reus) is an
essential element
of all crimes.
Motive is rarely made an essential element
of a crime, but is always admissible evidence
and is used by the state to help prove the guilty
mind requirement of many crimes.
FIGURE III.2
Elements that may be essential to the proof of a crime
*Scienter is guilty knowledge, that is, the suspect knew about 
certain facts. For example, a person cannot be found guilty of 
 possessing stolen property if he or she did not know the property 
was stolen.

mission is to facilitate cooperation, communication and 
coordination between law enforcement agencies and 
provide support in their efforts to investigate, identify, 
track, apprehend, and prosecute violent serial offend-
ers” (Cronin et al., 2007, p.139). Information considered 
viable is published in the FBI Law Enforcement Bul-
letin. If the case merits interagency cooperation, a 
major case investigation team of investigators from all 
involved agencies may be formed.
 
Viability is determined by specialists at VICAP who 
review the information submitted and compare it with 
information received from other departments about sim-
ilar cases and their MOs. This is especially important in 
serial killings and other major violent crimes in which 
the suspects have moved to other areas and committed 
similar crimes.
 
The chapters in this section of the book discuss 
speciﬁ c considerations in investigating deaths/ murder 
(Chapter 8); assault, domestic violence, stalking and 
elder abuse (Chapter 9); sex offenses (Chapter 10); 
crimes against children (Chapter 11); and robbery 
(Chapter 12). In actuality, more than one offense can 
occur in a given case. For example, what begins as 
a robbery can progress to an assault, then a forcible 
rape and ﬁ nally a murder. Each offense must be proven 
separately.

homicides in the United States in 2006 (Crime in the United 
States 2006), an increase of 1.8 percent from 2005. How-
ever, deaths reported as accidents or suicides may actually 
have been murder, and vice versa. It may be necessary to 
determine whether a death was a murder made to appear 
as a suicide to eliminate further investigation or a murder 
made to appear as an accident to collect life insurance.
 
Because homicides have received increasingly exten-
sive media attention, it may appear as if this crime is 
occurring more frequently. However, it is actually declin-
ing. Males are most often the victims and the perpetra-
tors in homicides, being 10 times more likely to commit 
murder than are females.
 
No other crime is measured as accurately and pre-
cisely. Homicides continue to receive the most attention 
by police, because they are considered the most serious 
crime and because they are complex cases to investigate. 
Furthermore, the national clearance rate for homicides is 
the highest of all the serious oﬀ enses: “Murder cases tend 
to clear quickly if they are cleared at all. Th e frequency of 
time to clearance shows a rather large drop-oﬀ  after one 
week, which conﬁ rms conventional wisdom regarding 
time to clearance” (Addington, 2007, pp.87–112).
ou arrive at the scene of a death in response to an 
emergency call and ﬁ nd the body of a 55-year-old 
white male crumpled at the bottom of a steep staircase—
obviously dead. Did the victim trip and fall (accidental 
death)? Did he suﬀ er a fatal heart attack at the top of the 
stairs and then fall (natural death)? Did he throw himself 
down the stairs to end some intense physical or mental 
suﬀ ering (suicide)? Or was he pushed (homicide)?
 
Only the fourth explanation involves a criminal action 
meriting an oﬃ  cial police investigation. However, because 
the police must determine whether it actually was homicide, 
the other three possible explanations must be investigated.
A basic requirement in a homicide investigation is to 
 establish whether death was caused by a criminal 
 action.
 
Statistically, murder is the least signiﬁ cant of the 
violent crimes, with the FBI reporting 17,034 criminal 
Y
CLASSIFICATION OF DEATHS
The four types of death are
• • Natural
• • Accidental       Noncriminal
• • Suicide
• • Homicide: Noncriminal or criminal
NATURAL CAUSES
Natural causes of death include heart attacks, strokes, 
fatal diseases, pneumonia, sudden crib deaths and old age. 
Frequently, a person who dies of natural causes has been 
under a physician’s care, and a death from natural causes 
is easily established.
 
Sometimes, however, a death is made to look as 
though it resulted from natural causes. For example, 
drugs that simulate the eﬀ ects of a heart attack may be 
used in a suicide or homicide.
ACCIDENTAL DEATHS
Among the causes of accidental death are falling; drown-
ing; unintentionally taking too many pills or ingesting a 
poisonous substance; entanglement in industrial or farm 
machinery; or involvement in an automobile, boat, train, 
bus or plane crash. Some people advocate that certain 
accidental deaths be investigated as criminal homicide—
for example, fatal crashes. A murder investigation can 
routinely involve 30 oﬃ  cers. A fatal-crash clearance is 
usually completed by just 1 or 2 oﬃ  cers.
 
As with natural deaths, an apparently accidental death 
can actually be a suicide or a homicide. For example, a per-
son can jump or be pushed from a roof or in front of a vehi-
cle or can voluntarily or involuntarily take an overdose of 
pills.
SUICIDE
Suicide—the intentional taking of one’s own life—can 
be committed by shooting, stabbing, poisoning, burn-
ing, asphyxiating or ingesting drugs or poisons. How-
ever, homicides are often made to look like suicides, 
}

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 255
and many suicides are made to look like accidents, 
usually for insurance purposes or to ease the family’s 
suﬀ ering.
 
Although suicide is not a criminal oﬀ ense, in most 
states it is a crime to attempt to commit suicide. Th is 
allows the state to take legal custody of such individuals 
for hospitalization or treatment. It may also be a crime 
to help someone commit or attempt to commit suicide 
by either intentionally advising, encouraging or actu-
ally assisting the victim in the act. Th e topic of assisted 
suicide is extremely controversial. Th e Supreme Court 
has found that there is no constitutional “right to die” 
and has left this decision to each individual state. One 
high-proﬁ le ﬁ gure in this controversy is Jack Kevorkian, 
“Dr. Death,” a pathologist-turned-assisted-suicide-cru-
sader who facilitated more than 130 suicides during the 
1990s. After being tried multiple times on assisted sui-
cide charges, Kevorkian was eventually tried for murder, 
found guilty and sent to prison in 1999. He was paroled 
in 2007.
HOMICIDE
If another individual is the direct or indirect cause of the 
death, the death is classiﬁ ed as homicide.
Homicide is the killing of one person by another.
 
Homicide includes the taking of life by another per-
son or by an agency, such as a government. It is either 
criminal or noncriminal, that is, felonious or nonfeloni-
ous. Criminal homicide is subdivided into murder and 
manslaughter, both of which are further subdivided. 
Noncriminal homicide is subdivided into excusable and 
justiﬁ able homicide.
Classiﬁ cation of homicides:
• • Criminal (felonious)
 
• Murder (ﬁ rst, second or third degree)
 
• Manslaughter (voluntary or involuntary)
• • Noncriminal (nonfelonious)
 
• Excusable homicide
 
• Justiﬁ able homicide
 
Th us, murder and homicide are not synonymous. All 
murders are homicides (and criminal), but not all homi-
cides are murders (or criminal).
Criminal 
Homicide Th e two classes of criminal 
 homicide—murder and manslaughter—have several 
 similarities but also important diﬀ erences.
 
Murder is the most severe statutory crime, one of 
the few for which the penalty can be life imprisonment 
or death. (In some states, treason and ransom kidnap-
ping carry a similarly severe penalty.) Some laws classify 
murder into first, second or third degrees. First-
degree murder requires premeditation (advanced 
planning) and the intent to cause death. Some statutes 
include in this classification any death that results dur-
ing the commission of or the attempt to commit a fel-
ony such as rape or robbery. Second-degree murder 
includes the intent to cause death, but not premedita-
tion. An example is a violent argument that ends in one 
person spontaneously killing the other. Third-degree 
murder involves neither premeditation nor intent. It 
results from an act that is imminently dangerous to 
others and shows a disregard for human life, such as 
shooting into a room where people are likely to be pres-
ent or playing a practical joke that may result in some-
one’s death.
 
Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another per-
son with no prior malice. It may be voluntary or involun-
tary. Voluntary manslaughter is the intentional causing 
of the death of another person in the heat of passion, that 
is, because of words or acts that provide adequate provoca-
tion. For example, the law generally recognizes such acts 
as adultery, seduction of a child or rape of a close relative 
as outrageous enough to constitute adequate provoca-
tion. Th is provocation must result in intense passion that 
replaces reason and leads to the immediate act. Th e provo-
cation, passion and fatal act must occur in rapid succession 
and be directly, sequentially related; that is, the provoca-
tion must cause the passion that causes the fatal act.
 
Involuntary manslaughter is accidental homicide 
that results from extreme (culpable) negligence. Examples 
of involuntary manslaughter include handling a ﬁ rearm 
negligently; leaving poison where children may take it; 
and operating an automobile, boat or aircraft in a crimi-
nally negligent manner. Some states, such as California, 
have a third category of manslaughter: manslaughter with 
a motor vehicle.
 
Other acts that can be classiﬁ ed as involuntary man-
slaughter include shooting another person with a ﬁ rearm 
or other dangerous weapon while mistakenly believing 
that person to be an animal; setting a spring gun, pitfall, 
deadfall, snare or other dangerous device designed to trap 
animals but capable of harming people; and negligently 
and intentionally allowing a known vicious animal to 
roam free.

256 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
investigation does not yield proof of premeditation, a 
charge of second-degree murder is made.
Causing the Death of Another Person Usually the 
death of a person is not diﬃ  cult to prove; a death certiﬁ -
cate completed by a physician, coroner or medical exam-
iner suﬃ  ces. If a death certiﬁ cate is not available, the 
investigator must locate witnesses to testify that they 
saw the body of the person allegedly killed by the suspect. 
When insuﬃ  cient remains exist to identify the body posi-
tively, death is proven by circumstantial evidence such as 
examination by a qualiﬁ ed pathologist or by other experts 
and their expert testimony regarding dental work, bone 
structure and the like.
 
A more diﬃ  cult portion of the element to prove is the 
cause of death. To show that the suspect’s act caused the 
death, (1) prove the cause of death and (2) prove that the 
suspect, through direct action, inﬂ icted injury suﬃ  cient to 
cause the death with some weapon or device. For example, 
if the cause of death was a fatal wound from a .22-caliber 
weapon, it is necessary to show that the suspect produced 
the cause of death. Did the suspect own such a weapon? 
Can witnesses testify that the suspect had such a weapon 
immediately before the fatal injury? Was the suspect seen 
actually committing the oﬀ ense? Did the suspect admit 
the act by statement or confession?
Premeditation Premeditation is the consideration, 
planning or preparation for an act, no matter how brieﬂ y, 
before committing it. Laws use such terms as premeditated 
design to kill or malice aforethought. Whatever the law’s 
wording, it is necessary to prove some intention and plan 
to commit the crime before it was actually committed.
Premeditation is the element of ﬁ rst-degree murder that 
sets it apart from all other classiﬁ cations.
 
Were oral statements or threats made during a heated 
argument? Did the suspect buy or have a gun just before 
the crime was committed or travel a long distance to wait 
for the victim? Premeditation can be proved in many 
ways. Sometimes the time interval between thought and 
action is only a minute; other times, it may be hours, days, 
weeks, months or even years.
 
Determine at what time before the killing the suspect 
considered, planned, threatened or made some overt act 
to prepare to commit the murder. Th is may be established 
by statements from witnesses or from the victim before 
death, from evidence at the crime scene or through a review 
of the suspect’s criminal history and past statements.
Intent to Effect the Death of Another Person Intent 
is a required element of most categories of criminal 
• • Murder
 
•  First degree—premeditated and intentional, or 
while committing or attempting to commit a felony
 
•  Second degree—intentional but not premeditated
 
•  Third degree—neither intentional nor 
premeditated, but the result of an imminently 
dangerous act
• • Manslaughter
 
•  Voluntary—intentional homicide caused 
by intense passion resulting from adequate 
provocation
 
•  Involuntary—unintentional homicide caused by 
criminal (culpable) negligence
Noncriminal Homicide Although the term homicide 
is usually associated with crime, not all homicides are 
crimes.
Excusable homicide is the unintentional, truly accidental 
killing of another person. Justiﬁ able homicide is killing 
another person under authorization of the law.
 
Excusable homicide results from an act that normally 
would not cause death or from an act committed with 
ordinary caution that, because of the victim’s negligence, 
results in death, as when a person runs in front of a mov-
ing car.
 
Justiﬁ able homicide includes killing in self-defense 
or in the defense of another person if the victim’s actions 
and capability present imminent danger of serious injury 
or death. Killing an enemy during wartime is also clas-
siﬁ ed as justiﬁ able homicide. Th is classiﬁ cation further 
includes capital punishment, death caused by a public 
oﬃ  cer while carrying out a court order and deaths caused 
by police oﬃ  cers while attempting to prevent a dangerous 
felon’s escape or to recapture a dangerous felon who has 
escaped or is resisting arrest. Oﬃ  cers need not risk their 
lives when faced with a shoot-or-be-shot situation.
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME
Laws on criminal homicide vary signiﬁ cantly from 
state to state, but certain common elements are 
usually found in each, as summarized in Table 8.1.
 
Th e degree eventually charged is decided by the prose-
cuting attorney based on the available evidence. For exam-
ple, the only diﬀ erence between ﬁ rst- and second- degree 
murder is the element of premeditation. If  thorough 

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 257
Adequately Provoked Intent Resulting from Heat of 
Passion Th is element is the alternative to premedita-
tion. It assumes that the act was committed when the 
suspect suddenly became extremely emotional, thus 
precluding premeditation. Heat of passion results 
from extremely volatile arguments between two peo-
ple, from seeing a wife or family member raped, from 
a sudden discovery of adultery or from seeing a brutal 
assault being committed against a close friend or family 
member.
While Committing or Attempting to Commit a 
Felony In some states, a charge of ﬁ rst-degree murder 
does not require that the murder was committed with 
premeditation if the victim died as a result of acts com-
mitted while the suspect was engaged in a felony such as 
rape, robbery or arson. Proof of the elements of the felony 
must be established.
While Committing or Attempting to Commit a 
Crime Not a Felony 
If a death results from an act 
committed by a suspect engaged in a nonfelonious 
crime such as purse snatching or petty theft, it can be 
charged as either third-degree murder or voluntary 
manslaughter, depending on the state in which the 
offense occurs.
homicide. Evidence must show that the crime was inten-
tional, not accidental. Malicious intent, an element of 
ﬁ rst- and second-degree murder, implies ill will, wicked-
ness or cruelty. How the act was committed shows the 
degree of intent. Th e type of weapon used, how and when 
it was acquired and how the suspect and victim came 
together help prove the intent as well as the act that 
caused the death.
 
Intent and premeditation are not the same. Premedita-
tion is not a requirement of intent. Most crimes of pas-
sion involve intent but not premeditation or malicious 
intent.
 
Th is element also applies to a death caused to some-
one other than the intended victim. For example, in one 
case a woman intended to kill her husband by placing 
poison in a bottle of whiskey he kept under the seat of 
the family car. Unknowingly, the husband oﬀ ered a drink 
from the bottle to a friend, who died as a result. Th e wife 
was charged with ﬁ rst-degree murder and convicted, even 
though the person who died was not her intended victim. 
It was a reasonable consequence of her act.
 
An explosive that was set for one person may deto-
nate prematurely and kill someone else. A person shoot-
ing at an intended victim may miss and kill an innocent 
bystander. Both of these would constitute ﬁ rst-degree 
murder.

ASPECTS OF THE OFFENSE ASSOCIATED WITH 
LIKELIHOOD OF CLEARING A CASE
Research indicates that several aspects of a homicide pertain-
ing to the investigation are associated with the likelihood of 
clearing the case (Regoeczi et al., 2008, pp.145–146):
• • Homicide Circumstances. Several studies report that 
 felony-related homicides are more diﬃ  cult to clear than 
are homicides resulting from other circumstances.
• • Weapons. Homicides committed with weapons that 
bring the oﬀ ender and victim into contact with one 
another (such as a knife) increase the likelihood of 
closing the case.
• • Location. Among the more consistent ﬁ ndings con-
cerning homicide clearance is the greater likelihood of 
clearance for cases occurring in residences.
LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AFFECTING 
CLEARANCE
Research by University of Maryland Professor Charles 
Wellford and Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) 
Research Associate Jim Cronin focused on homicide 
clearance rates in 20 cities and found that high clearance 
rates were associated with several factors, including the 
initial response, actions of the detectives and other police 
actions (Cronin et al., 2007, pp.24–27).
The Initial Response Variables associated with success-
fully clearing a homicide case during the initial response 
include
• • Th e ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer on the scene immediately notiﬁ es the 
homicide unit, the medical examiner’s oﬃ  ce and the 
crime lab.
• • Th e ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer on the scene immediately secures the 
area and attempts to locate witnesses.
• • Th e detective assigned to the case arrives at the scene 
within 30 minutes of being notiﬁ ed.
Actions of the Detectives Variables in the actions of 
the detectives that signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ected whether a case 
was solved include the following:
• • Th ree or four detectives, instead of one or two, were 
assigned to the case.
• • Th e detectives took detailed notes describing the 
crime scene, including measurements.
• • Detectives followed up on all information provided by 
witnesses.
• • At least one detective assigned to the case attended 
the postmortem examination.
Culpable Negligence or Depravity Th e act and the 
way it is committed establish this element. Th e act must 
be so dangerous that any prudent person would see death 
of a person as a possible consequence. A person causing a 
death while depraved and committing acts evident of such 
depravity is guilty of third-degree murder.
Negligence A fine line separates this element from 
the preceding element. Some states make no distinc-
tion, classifying both in a separate category of crimi-
nal negligence. Where separate categories exist, this 
lesser degree of negligence involves creating a situation 
that results in an unreasonable risk of death or great 
bodily harm.
THE DECLINING CLEARANCE 
RATE
Cleared, closed and solved are often used inter-
changeably. Th e FBI uses the term cleared. 
According to Crime in the United States 2006, 60.7 per-
cent of murders were cleared by arrest or exceptional 
means in 2006. Although this is the highest clearance 
rate for the eight crimes included in the Uniform Crime 
Reports, the rate has been declining, having decreased 
by nearly 30 percent since the 1960s. Cronin et al. (2007, 
p.2) report,
Homicide clearance rates in police departments are 
decreasing. In 1965, the average national clearance 
rate for homicide was 91 percent; in 1976 it was 79 
percent and in 2002 it was 64 percent. Many prac-
titioners attribute the declining clearance rates to 
several factors: an increase in stranger-to-stranger 
homicides, which are usually more diﬃ  cult to solve 
than cases in which the perpetrator knows the victim; 
gang-related oﬀ enses that turn fatal; community 
and witness intimidation; and reductions in witness 
cooperation.
 
Police departments also report that increasing num-
bers of “petty arguments” and incidents of “disrespect” 
lead to homicides. . . . Another factor is the reentry of 
prisoners [650,000 per year] into communities, which 
increases the number of persons prone to violence. . . .
 
Additionally, backlogs and heavy caseloads within 
crime labs and coroners’ oﬃ  ces may reduce investiga-
tive eﬀ ectiveness.
 
Other factors include increases in illegal immigra-
tion from countries where residents fear and do not 
trust the local police; and the growth of “Th ug Culture” 
and “Stop Snitchin’” campaigns.

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 259
enforcement or citizen); the victim’s refusal to cooperate 
with the prosecution after the oﬀ ender has been identi-
ﬁ ed; or the denial of extradition because the oﬀ ender 
committed a crime in another jurisdiction and is being 
prosecuted for that oﬀ ense.”
CHALLENGES IN 
INVESTIGATION
Police have an obligation to act on behalf of the 
deceased and their families. Th ey are expected 
to conduct a professional investigation to identify, arrest 
and prosecute suspects. One apparent injustice in the 
criminal justice system is that to an outsider, it appears 
that the police are constantly trying to protect the rights 
of the perpetrator and pay slight attention to the rights of 
the deceased or the family.
Challenges in homicide investigations include pressure 
by the media and the public, the difﬁ culty of establishing 
that a crime has been committed, identifying the victim 
and establishing the cause and time of death.
 
Homicides create high interest in the community, as 
evidenced by increased sales of newspapers and higher 
ratings for the news media. Indeed, the media have a spe-
cial interest in police investigations of deaths—accidental 
or otherwise. Police oﬃ  cers who have dealt with the news 
media understand the important relationship between law 
enforcement and the media, as discussed in Chapter 1.
 
Police policies and guidelines should specify what 
information is to be released: the deceased’s name, 
accused’s name and general identifying information; any 
details regarding formal charges; and general facts about 
the investigation that are not harmful to the continuing 
investigation.
 
Do not pose the accused for photographs, and do not 
permit the accused to talk to the press. If investigators 
have details known only to them and the accused, that 
information must not be released. Exercising good sense, 
getting to know the reporters personally and refraining 
from giving oﬀ -the-record comments will prevent many 
problems. Reporters have a right to be at the scene, and 
cooperation is the best policy—within the policies and 
guidelines of the department.
 
From time to time, public outrage over particular 
crimes places increased pressure on the police to solve 
murders. A more serious problem is the diﬃ  culty of estab-
lishing that a crime has, in fact, been committed. Search 
Other Police Actions Variables in the “other police 
responses” category found to signiﬁ cantly increase the 
likelihood that a homicide is solved include the following:
• • A computer check using the local criminal justice 
information system was conducted on the suspect or 
on any guns found.
• • A witness interviewed at the crime scene provided 
valuable evidence such as information about circum-
stances of the death or the perpetrator’s motivation, 
an identiﬁ cation of the suspect or victim or the where-
abouts of the suspect.
• • Witnesses, friends, acquaintances and neighbors of 
the victim were interviewed.
• • Th e medical examiner prepared a body chart of the 
victim, which was included in the case ﬁ le.
• • Th e attending physician and medical personnel were 
interviewed.
• • Conﬁ dential informants provided information.
 
Many departments use a homicide case review solv-
ability chart to determine which cases to focus on. Such 
tools can provide support for requesting additional 
resources. Appendix B shows an example of a solvability 
chart.
IMPACT OF UNSOLVED HOMICIDES
Cronin et al. (2007, p.14) contend, “Unsolved homicides 
hamper the healing process for the family and friends 
of the victim, and have a signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect on communi-
ties and all aspects of the criminal justice system. . . . Of 
course, the most important consequence of an unsolved 
homicide is that a killer remains free, able to commit addi-
tional murders or become a victim himself.”
CASES EXCEPTIONALLY CLEARED
Crime in the United States 2006 explains, “In certain situ-
ations, elements beyond law enforcement’s control pre-
vent the agency from arresting and formally charging 
the oﬀ ender. When this occurs, the agency can clear the 
oﬀ enses exceptionally.” To do so, law enforcement agen-
cies must have identiﬁ ed the oﬀ ender; garnered enough 
evidence to support an arrest, make a charge and turn 
over the oﬀ ender to the court for prosecution; identiﬁ ed 
the oﬀ ender’s exact location so that the suspect could be 
taken into custody immediately; and encountered a cir-
cumstance outside the control of law enforcement that 
prohibits the oﬃ  cers from arresting, charging and prose-
cuting the oﬀ ender. Th e FBI clariﬁ es, “Examples of excep-
tional clearance include, but are not limited to, the death 
of the oﬀ ender (e.g., suicide or justiﬁ ably killed by law 

260 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
SIDS (approximately 85 percent of cases) or will identify 
another cause of death, such as homicide. Investigating 
SUID is covered in Chapter 11.
 
In-custody deaths present a tremendous challenge 
to investigators. Th ese cases typically involve suspects 
who have been restrained for some time, during which 
they enter a state of medical crisis and die. Families of 
the deceased frequently ﬁ le lawsuits claiming that police 
brutality caused the death, and the oﬃ  cers involved con-
tend that the restrained person succumbed to some type 
of preexisting physical defect (weak heart, aneurysm, etc.) 
brought about by the subject’s own state of agitation. 
Sometimes this is referred to as excited delirium, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 7; Sullivan (2007) notes that this diag-
nosis is controversial and viewed by civil libertarians as a 
cover up for excessive use of force. Peters (2006, p.106) 
says, “During transport and, in some cases, during the 
restraint process, the individual will suddenly get calm, 
become unconscious, and go into respiratory arrest and/
or cardiac arrest.” He contends, “Th ese deaths are often 
associated with chronic, rather than acute, drug use—
usually multifactoral, complex, and often not isolated to 
a single incident” (p.104).
 
Because police are involved in the death, a thorough 
but objective investigation is critical:
Th e investigator(s) should determine if the body is 
still at the scene. If so, information and photographs 
should be obtained and taken regarding the body’s ﬁ nal 
position, location, clothing, etc. If possible, it should 
be determined if the person had been sweating. If it 
appears the person had been sweating, photographs 
should be taken of wet clothing, perspiration on the 
skin, hair, etc. to highlight and conﬁ rm the sweating.
 
A core body temperature should be taken of the 
decedent, regardless of where (s)he is located. Asking 
for a core body temperature after the medical inter-
ventions have been completed is not an unreasonable 
request. . . .
 
Determine if the person was restrained prior to 
his or her death, and/or was restrained at the time of 
death. Th e type of restraint(s) used (e.g., metallic, plas-
tic, nylon, specialty restraints, combinations) should be 
identiﬁ ed in the investigation report, and photographs 
taken of the restraint(s) applied to the person.
 
One speciﬁ c area of photographic interest is the 
decedent’s thumb(s). A person who is addicted to or 
uses crack cocaine on a regular basis will often use a dis-
posable lighter to heat a crack pipe. . . . several times a 
day which will many times cause a callous to be formed 
on the underside of their thumbs, known as “crack 
thumb”. (Peters and Brave, 2006, pp.56–57)
 
A checklist for investigating sudden in-custody deaths 
is provided in Appendix C. As with SUID cases, in-custody 
deaths must be thoroughly investigated, beginning with 
warrants can be issued if proof of a crime exists; however, 
such proof may not be legally available without a warrant. 
In addition, many perpetrators attempt to make the crime 
scene look as if a robbery or burglary has taken place. It 
can also be diﬃ  cult to determine whether the death was 
homicide or suicide.
EQUIVOCAL DEATH
Equivocal death investigations are situations 
that are open to interpretation. Th e case may 
present as homicide, suicide or accidental death. Th e facts 
may be intentionally vague or misleading as in staged 
crime scenes.
 
A staged crime scene is one where a killer hopes to 
cover his or her tracks by making it look like the victim 
committed suicide, suﬀ ered a fatal accident or died of 
natural causes. Inexperienced investigators who jump to 
the hasty conclusion that a man found hanging in his 
garage or the dead woman in the bathtub with slit wrists 
must have committed suicide may be allowing a perpe-
trator to get away with murder. A critical piece of the 
investigation is assessing the victimology: “Conducting 
a thorough victimology is a process that is central to the 
investigation. A victimology, a thorough understanding 
of who the victim is, how he makes a living, his back-
ground, and the background where he comes from, will 
not only allow the investigator to thoroughly know about 
the victim but will be the ﬁ rst step to ﬁ nding out why he 
was victimized, and by whom” (Joyce, 2006, p.49). What 
was the victim’s state of mind in the days leading up to 
the death? Had the victim made long-term plans, such 
as having purchased plane tickets for a vacation, prepaid 
membership dues or begun a major house renovation 
project? Answers to these questions may not support 
an initial assessment of suicide. Th e prudent investiga-
tor approaches all equivocal death scenes as if they were 
homicides until forensic evaluation of evidence can point 
one way or the other—homicide or not.
 
Another equivocal death situation involves sudden, 
unexplained infant death (SUID), which is not to be con-
fused with SIDS or sudden infant death syndrome. SIDS 
is the sudden death of a child under age 1 that remains 
unexplained even after a thorough investigation involv-
ing a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene 
and review of the infant’s clinical history. It is a “diag-
nosis of exclusion,” when all other possible causes of 
death (disease, illness, abuse, etc.) have been explored 
and ruled out. SUID is a preinvestigative term. A SUID 
case, after a thorough investigation, may be classiﬁ ed as

arrangements with an undertaker or other evidence of 
putting one’s aﬀ airs in order.
 
Learn whether the victim was left- or right-handed 
and see whether this ﬁ ts with the method of committing 
suicide. Note lividity conditions and the body’s location 
to determine how long the person has been dead and 
whether the body has been moved. Note the condition of 
rigor mortis. Are there “hesitation marks” indicating inde-
cision before the ﬁ nal act? Do not assume that any blood 
on the victim is the victim’s; it may be from a murderer. 
(Th ese issues are discussed later in the chapter.)
 
When smaller-caliber weapons are ﬁ red, blood may 
not appear on the hands of the person ﬁ ring the gun. In 
fact, in most suicide cases, blood does not appear on the 
hands. A test for gunshot residue (GSR), as explained in 
Chapter 5, will conﬁ rm whether the deceased ﬁ red the 
weapon. In more than 75 percent of suicide cases in which 
a gun is used, the gun is not found in the victim’s hand but 
is near the body. In a number of suicides, the victims have 
multiple wounds. If evidence surfaces after the initial 
investigation that proves a suicide was actually a homi-
cide, do not hesitate to reopen the case.
 
What appears to be a double suicide can also present 
problems. It may be a murder-suicide. Determine who 
died ﬁ rst or who inﬂ icted the fatal wounds. Attempt to 
determine the motive. Search for a note. Look for signs 
of a violent struggle before death. Sometimes suicide is 
obvious, as when suspects kill themselves to avoid being 
captured by the police.
 
To gain a better understanding of the victim’s frame 
of mind when the suicide occurred or to reveal that the act 
was perhaps not suicide at all, investigators must study 
the personality traits, character and lifestyle of the vic-
tim, reconstructing as accurately as possible the days and 
hours preceding the victim’s death. Life Crisis Services 
of St. Louis, one of the nation’s oldest and continuous 
working suicide and crisis intervention hotlines, lists the 
following warning signs often observable in someone con-
templating suicide (Kelly and Martin, 2006, p.94):
• • Talking, writing or joking about suicide or death
• • Giving away prized possessions
• • Making ﬁ nal arrangements
• • Depressive symptoms
• • Sudden, unexplained recovery from a profound 
depression
• • Marked feelings of helplessness and hopelessness
• • Risk taking behavior
• • Self-mutilating behavior
• • Organizing a suicidal plan or gathering the means
• • Previous suicide attempts
a complete autopsy to determine whether a heart attack, 
stroke or other physical condition caused the death. 
Sometimes an equivocal death investigation reveals the 
cause to be suicide.
SUICIDE
Suicide often presents as a homicide. Investiga-
tors should keep in mind that more Americans 
die by suicide than by homicide. Often depression or 
schizophrenia is involved, and usually these people have 
made their intentions known to someone. Th erefore, 
investigators should try to determine whether a suspected 
suicide victim was suﬀ ering from depression or schizo-
phrenia or whether the victim had talked to anyone about 
committing suicide.
 
Th e reason for an apparent suicide must be deter-
mined. An act that appears to be too violent for suicide 
and is therefore a suspected homicide may actually be a 
natural death. Never exclude the possibility of death from 
natural causes in the initial phase of an investigation 
because of the presence of obvious marks of violence. Th e 
abnormal activity of a person suﬀ ering from an acutely 
painful attack can create the appearance of a struggle. 
Th e onset of more than 70 diseases can produce sudden 
death. People who experience such an attack may disar-
range their clothing and sustain severe injury by falling. In 
one case, a man shot himself to relieve excruciating pain, 
and the autopsy showed that a ruptured aorta caused his 
death, not the gunshot. What appeared to be suicide was 
declared to be death by natural causes.
 
Check for weapons on or near the body. Were there 
any prior suicide attempts, a history of mental illness or 
recent traumatic incidents? Were there any recent changes 
or conﬂ icts in the victim’s personal relationships? Was 
the victim being treated for a medical condition? Were 
any prescription drugs found at the scene? What was the 
cause of death?
 
When investigating suspected suicides, attempt to 
ﬁ nd a note or letter. However, lack of a note does not 
eliminate the possibility of suicide—a suicide note is left 
in only a fourth of the cases investigated. If you do ﬁ nd a 
note, have it compared with the deceased’s handwriting.
 
Preserve all evidence until the medical examiner or 
coroner’s oﬃ  ce rules whether the death is a suicide.
 
Also look for videos or cassettes describing the 
actions taken. Examine any pads of paper near the body 
for the presence of indentation remaining from writing 
on sheets of paper torn from the pad and destroyed. Look 
for manuals on how to commit suicide. Check on prior 

262 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
SUICIDE OF POLICE OFFICERS
Th ere is no question—police work is stressful. And it can 
take its toll in tragic ways. Although many consider police 
work to be a dangerous profession primarily because of 
the risk of encountering violent and armed individuals, 
more oﬃ  cers lose their lives to suicide than to homicide. 
Some data show that three times as many oﬃ  cers kill 
themselves, about 300 annually, as are killed by criminals 
in the line of duty, making oﬃ  cer suicide “the single most 
lethal factor in police work” (Miller, 2006, p.90). Grossi 
(2007, p.34) reports, “Some studies indicate police oﬃ  -
cers are eight times more likely to kill themselves than to 
die by felonious assault. Other experts report that police 
oﬃ  cers have a three times greater chance of taking their 
own life than to die in a job-related accident, and that they 
are twice as likely to commit suicide as other municipal 
 workers. Th e National Police Suicide Foundation out of 
Pasadena, Md. reports that two to three times as many 
cops die by their hand than get killed on the job.” Which-
ever study one chooses to reference, the fact remains that 
suicide rates for police—at least 18 per 100,000—are 
higher than for the general population (J. Ritter, 2007).
 
Contributing factors in police suicides, as with other 
victims of suicide, are alcohol, family issues and the 
breakup of relationships. Th e public’s image of the police, 
and indeed oﬃ  cers’ image of themselves, is that of the 
strong protector of society. Yet police work forces oﬃ  cers 
to confront daily the dark side of human nature and may 
eventually cause oﬃ  cers to lose their faith in the good-
ness of humanity or in their abilities to make a positive 
impact on the lives of others. Th is sense of weakness and 
failure is so contradictory to the image of the police that 
some oﬃ  cers may simply see no other choice than to “take 
themselves out of the game.”
 
About 97 percent of oﬃ  cer suicides involve their own 
duty weapon: “Oﬃ  cers have a special relationship with 
their gun. It is a source of control, of conﬁ dence and of 
comfort. . . . Although some critics argue the high rate of 
using a gun in a police-involved suicide is due to acces-
sibility, others disagree saying, ‘Th e weapon has a sig-
niﬁ cance. It has an identity. It becomes someone who 
is trustworthy, reliable and someone with a solution’” 
(Perin, 2007, p.14).
 
When an oﬃ  cer commits suicide, the family—and 
sometimes the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cers on the scene—may attempt 
to make the death look accidental or like a homicide to 
avoid the stigma of suicide or to ensure that the family 
can collect the life insurance. Any oﬃ  cer’s death requires a 
thorough investigation. As with suspected suicide-by-cop 
incidents, investigation into the oﬃ  cer’s prior mental/
emotional status (presence of depression, posttraumatic 
stress disorder), substance use or abuse, family situations 
• • Anxiety over impending or anticipated discipline
• • Chemical abuse
SUICIDE BY POLICE
Suicide by police was introduced in Chapter 7 and refers 
to a situation in which a person decides he or she wants 
to die but does not want to pull the trigger. Such people 
may lack the constitution to take their own lives and take 
the option of forcing a police oﬃ  cer to do it for them; or 
they may view suicide as socially or religiously unaccept-
able but believe that if they are killed by police, the stigma 
of suicide will be averted and society may see them as vic-
tims. Some insurance policies will not pay if a person com-
mits suicide, making suicide by cop an attractive option 
for those bent on killing themselves.
 
Often such cases involve a “man-with-a-gun” call. 
 Arriving police are confronted with a person acting bizar-
rely and threatening to shoot himself or herself, a hostage 
or the responding oﬃ  cers. In many instances, the gun is 
not loaded, is a fake or is inoperative, but if it is pointed 
at the police, the police are forced to shoot. Th e actions 
of armed individuals who go out of their way to provoke a 
lethal response by police have led those in academia to refer 
to such suicide-by-cop incidents as “victim-precipitated.”
 
When investigating a suspected case of suicide by cop, 
a critical element to determine is the probable motivation 
of the oﬀ ender/victim. Suicide-by-cop oﬀ ender proﬁ les 
indicate that such subjects often have a poor self-image, 
feel a sense of guilt for harm they have caused, talk about 
death and express a desire to be with deceased loved ones, 
speak often of a higher being, are aggressively confron-
tational with police and possess an unloaded or non-
functioning (toy) gun. Other issues that may potentially 
indicate suicidal motivations include
• • Financial concerns
• • Divorce or serious relationship issues
• • Loss of a job or retirement
• • Being investigated
• • Health problems
 
Th e presence of such factors may help oﬃ  cers identify 
potential suicide-by-cop cases. Investigators must evaluate 
the totality of physical evidence and behavioral indicators 
to accurately assess whether the incident is one of suicide 
by cop, as no single piece of evidence, action or behavior is 
usually suﬃ  cient to establish an oﬀ ender’s motivation.
 
Whatever the circumstances, a police oﬃ  cer who 
is forced to take a life may suﬀ er emotionally. In some 
instances, oﬃ  cers who have taken a life end up taking 
their own.

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 263
premises. However, the Court speciﬁ cally rejected the idea 
that there is any general “murder scene exception” to the 
search warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. 
Th e situation qualiﬁ es as simply an exigent circumstance.
 
A study of 800 homicide cases (“Secrets of Success,” 
2000, p.1) found that investigators are more likely to 
clear a homicide if they arrive within 30 minutes of 
being notiﬁ ed, as compared with half an hour or longer. 
Th e researchers also found that following up on witness 
information made it more than twice as likely that a case 
would be solved, and if that information proved valuable, 
more than 17 times as likely. Furthermore, the study (p.6) 
found, “Th e behavior of police at crime scenes plays a sig-
niﬁ cant role, as well. Cases were less likely to be solved if 
the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer at the scene failed to notify the homicide 
unit, medical examiner or crime lab. Th e chances of solv-
ing the case also fell if the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer did not attempt to 
round up witnesses.” As in any crime scene investigation, 
the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer on the scene is extremely important.
 
As you enter the scene, it is important to introduce 
yourself, identify key personnel, establish rapport and 
assess the safety of the scene. Of course, if you discover 
upon arrival that the victim is still alive, the ﬁ rst priority 
is to render emergency aid and make sure an ambulance is 
en route.
The ﬁ rst priority is to give emergency aid to the victim 
if he or she is still alive or to determine that death has 
occurred.
 
If the suspect is still at the scene, priorities may diﬀ er 
drastically. Normally, however, the suspect is not at the 
scene, and the victim is the ﬁ rst priority. If the victim is 
obviously dying, take a dying declaration. Th e live victim 
is taken to a hospital as rapidly as possible.
 
Th e ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer on the scene determines the path to 
the victim that will least disturb evidence. If the victim is 
obviously dead, the body remains at the scene until the 
preliminary investigation is complete. It is then taken to 
the morgue by the medical examiner or coroner for post-
mortem examination or autopsy.
 
Following the assessment of the victim, investiga-
tors must document everything they can about the scene. 
Th is includes detaining and identifying everyone present, 
obtaining brief statements from each, maintaining control 
of the scene and everyone present, listing all oﬃ  cers present 
upon the investigator’s arrival and throughout the investi-
gation and recording the presence of all other personnel at 
the scene (medical personnel, coroner, family members). A 
death-scene checklist developed by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) can help ensure a thorough preliminary 
investigation. Th is checklist is reprinted in Appendix D.
(divorce, death of a spouse or child), ﬁ nancial status (large 
debts) and health (serious or chronic illness) provide criti-
cal insight into possible motivations for suicide. Being 
under an internal aﬀ airs investigation and facing the 
potential loss of one’s identity as an oﬃ  cer is the most 
compelling reason for an oﬃ  cer to make a hasty decision 
to commit suicide.
 
Once forensic examination concludes that a death 
was caused by suicide, the investigation is over and the 
case closed. For those cases that are homicides, a thor-
ough criminal investigation must be conducted.
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION 
OF HOMICIDE
“The homicide crime scene is, without a doubt, 
the most important crime scene to which a 
police oﬃ  cer or investigator will be called upon to 
respond,” says Geberth (2006, p.140). He explains, 
“Because of the nature of the crime, death by violence or 
unnatural causes, the answer to what happened can be 
determined only after a careful and intelligent examina-
tion of the scene. Th e preliminary investigation conducted 
at the scene by the detectives will provide for the intelli-
gent and eﬀ ective retrieval of evidence paramount to 
the successful conclusion and prosecution of the case” 
(p.140).
 
Th e initial investigation of a homicide is basically the 
same as for any other crime, although it may require more 
ﬂ exibility, logic and perseverance. Th e primary goals of the 
investigation are (1) to establish whether a human death 
was caused by the criminal act or omission of another and 
(2) to determine who caused the death. Promoting Eﬀ ective 
Homicide Investigations (Cronin et al., 2007) is a valuable 
resource for homicide investigators and covers clearance 
rates, managing homicide units, eyewitness identiﬁ cation, 
videotaping interrogations and cold case investigations.
 
Th e homicide case normally begins with a report of 
a missing person or the discovery of a body. Th e oﬃ  cer 
in the ﬁ eld seldom makes the initial discovery. Th e ﬁ rst 
notiﬁ cation is received by the police communications cen-
ter or a dispatcher who records the date, time and exact 
wording used. Because the original call is sometimes made 
anonymously by a suspect, a voice recording is made for 
comparison with later suspects.
 
In Flippo v. West Virginia (1999), the Supreme Court 
held that police may make warrantless entries onto prem-
ises where they reasonably believe a person is in need of 
immediate aid, or may make a prompt warrantless search 
of a homicide scene for other victims or a killer on the 

264 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
Physical evidence in a homicide includes a weapon, a 
body, blood, hairs and ﬁ bers.
 
Any of the various types of evidence discussed in 
Chapter 5 can be present at a homicide scene. Especially 
important are the body and the weapon.
 
After priority matters are completed, the focus of the 
homicide investigation is to
• • Identify the victim.
• • Establish the time of death.
• • Establish the cause of and the method used to produce 
death.
• • Develop a suspect.
 
Th e preliminary investigation either accomplishes 
these things or provides leads that investigators can fol-
low up.
 
A fact-ﬁ nding capsule such as that shown in Figure 
8.1 might guide homicide investigations. Th ree important 
rules govern these investigative tactics:
• • Speciﬁ city. Explore all issues to obtain precise facts 
and enough details to make objective judgments and 
correlations.
• • Element of surprise. Keep witnesses from comparing 
stories and deny suspects time to cover their tracks or 
create alibis.
• • Haste. Accomplish all tasks quickly to gather and 
promptly develop facts.
Table 8.2 lists the investigative avenues to pursue.
DETERMINING THAT DEATH HAS OCCURRED
Medically, death is determined by the cessation of three 
vital functions: heartbeat, respiration and brain activity. 
Th e ﬁ rst two signs are observable.
Signs of death include lack of breathing, lack of heart-
beat, lack of ﬂ ushing of the ﬁ ngernail bed when pressure 
is applied to the nail and then released and failure of the 
eyelids to close after being gently lifted.
 
Cessation of respiration is generally the ﬁ rst visible 
sign of death. However, in cases such as barbiturate over-
doses, breathing can be so shallow that it is undetectable. 
Th erefore, always check for a heartbeat and pulse. Except 
in some drug overdoses and with certain types of blind-
ness, failure of the pupils to dilate in reaction to light is 
also a sign of death.
 
If the victim appears to have died at the moment of 
the oﬃ  cer’s arrival or dies in the oﬃ  cer’s presence, the 
oﬃ  cer should attempt resuscitation with the standard 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation methods.
THE FOCUS OF THE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION
As with any other criminal investigation, the homicide 
scene must be secured, photographed and sketched. Vid-
eotaping the crime scene can produce excellent results 
and is being done more frequently. All evidence must be 
obtained, identiﬁ ed and properly preserved. Physical evi-
dence can be found on the body, at the scene or on the 
suspect.

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 265
 
In many cases, identifying the deceased is no prob-
lem. Th e spouse, parents, a close friend or a relative makes 
the identiﬁ cation. If possible, have several people identify 
the body, because people under stress make mistakes. In 
a number of cases, a homicide victim has been identiﬁ ed 
only to turn up later alive. Although personal identiﬁ ca-
tion by viewing the deceased is ideal, corroborate it by 
other evidence. Personal eﬀ ects found on the victim assist 
in identiﬁ cation. However, such personal eﬀ ects may not 
necessarily belong to the deceased. Th erefore, check them 
carefully.
 
If identiﬁ cation cannot be made by relatives or 
acquaintances or by personal eﬀ ects, the most positive 
identiﬁ cation is by ﬁ ngerprint or DNA analysis. Com-
parative ﬁ ngerprints are not always available, however, 
and blood type does not provide a positive identiﬁ cation, 
although it can prove that a body is not a speciﬁ c person.
 
Schoﬁ eld (2006, p.14) asserts, “Two of the more dif-
ﬁ cult kinds of cases for a criminal investigator to handle 
are those related to missing persons and those involving 
unidentiﬁ ed human remains. Not surprisingly, the two 
often go hand-in-hand.” According to N. Ritter (2007b, 
p.2), “On any given day, there are as many as 100,000 
active missing persons cases in the United States.” Th e 
FBI’s National Crime Information Center currently regis-
ters more than 100,000 missing-persons cases and some 
5,800 sets of remains (Schoﬁ eld).
 
Jetmore (2006, p.32) stresses, “Th e skilled investi-
gator recognizes the need to include experts from a vari-
ety of scientiﬁ c ﬁ elds on the investigative team from the 
earliest stages possible. Homicide investigation is no 
longer feet on the pavement, but ﬁ ngers moving across 
a computer keyboard to identify and recruit people who 
have unique scientiﬁ c skills and are willing to use them.” 
He suggests that in addition to the medical examiner, a 
recovery team should consist of a forensic anthropolo-
gist (to provide information on gender, height, race and 
age), a forensic odontologist (to provide an age range) 
and a forensic entomologist (to provide information 
DISCOVERING AND 
IDENTIFYING THE VICTIM
In some cases, no body is present. It may have 
been burned, cut up beyond recognition or 
dissolved in a vat of acid. Some states allow the use of cir-
cumstantial evidence to prove the corpus delicti when no 
body can be found. In other cases, there is a body, but 
locating it is a challenge. It may have been weighted and 
sunk in a body of water or buried underground.
 
When searching for human remains, investigators 
can use technologies such as ground-penetrating radar, 
magnetometers, metal detectors and infrared thermog-
raphy. Infrared thermography can distinguish between 
hidden new and old gravesites faster and more accurately 
than can other techniques. In addition, cadaver-search 
canines have proven eﬀ ective: “Cadaver dogs are trained 
to locate and follow the scent of decomposing human 
ﬂ esh. Not a pretty thought, but their job is vital to both 
families of the victims, and to a justice system that oft-
times needs a body to prove a crime” (Miﬃ  n, 2008). Dogs 
can be trained to detect human remains long after death, 
despite burial or attempted concealment. Trained dogs 
can distinguish between human remains, animal remains 
and a wide range of other odors that would normally be 
expected to distract them (Lowy and McAlhany, 2008). 
Th eir ability to distinguish between sources of similar 
biological odors enhances their use in human remains 
detection (HRD).
 
Once a body is found, it must be identiﬁ ed.
Homicide victims are identiﬁ ed by immediate family, 
relatives or acquaintances; personal effects, ﬁ ngerprints, 
DNA analysis and dental and skeletal studies; clothing 
and laundry marks; or through missing-persons ﬁ les.

fractures and by examining signs of prior surgical proce-
dures, such as scars or other abnormalities.
ESTIMATING THE TIME OF 
DEATH (TOD)
In many homicides, there is a delay between the 
commission of the crime and the discovery of 
the body, sometimes only minutes, other times years. Th is 
period between death and corpse discovery is called the 
postmortem interval (PMI). Understanding the processes 
that occur in a body during the PMI can help investigators 
estimate a time of death. Research facilities, such as the 
Body Farm outside of Knoxville, Tennessee, are allowing 
forensic scientists to study and document these processes 
under various environmental conditions in an eﬀ ort to help 
investigators more accurately determine the time of death. 
However, as Geberth (2007a, p.58) observes, “Th roughout 
the years, forensic scientists and pathologists have searched 
for a deﬁ nitive method of determining time of death, but at 
present, there is no single reliable method. . . . Based on an 
appreciation of a large number of variables, an experienced 
pathologist can arrive at a reasonable estimation of time of 
death, usually placing it within a range of hours.”
on the location and approximate time of death): “If an 
investigator has only gender, height, race and approxi-
mate age, at least this provides a starting point to query 
multiple missing-person databases and begin assem-
bling a list of names” (p.33). Such information can be 
submitted to the Unidentiﬁ ed Persons index of the 
CODIS database.
 
Identifying the mass fatalities resulting from the 
 September 11, 2001, attacks presented the greatest 
forensic challenge in this country’s history. A balance 
had to be struck between speed and accuracy: “To assist 
in this monumental eﬀ ort, NIJ brought together a group 
of experts to advise and support New York City’s Oﬃ  ce 
of the Chief Medical Examiner during the identiﬁ cation 
eﬀ ort. Th e Kinship and Data Analysis Panel (KADAP) 
made recommendations on forensic technologies, policies, 
and procedures to help identify victims who perished in 
the World Trade Center” (N. Ritter, 2007a, p.20).
 
Th e Kinship and Data Analysis Panel (KADAP) report, 
Lessons Learned from 9/11: DNA Identiﬁ cation in Mass 
Fatality Incidents (2006, p.1) states, “DNA analysis is the 
gold standard for identiﬁ cation of human remains from 
mass disasters. Particularly in the absence of traditional 
anthropological and other physical characteristics, foren-
sic DNA typing allows for identiﬁ cation of any biological 
sample and the association of body parts, as long as suﬃ  -
cient DNA can be recovered from the samples. Th is is true 
even when the victim’s remains are fragmented and the 
DNA is degraded.” Th e bulk of the report is aimed at the 
technicians who perform such DNA analysis.
 
In July 2007, the U.S. Justice Department launched a 
program to help law enforcement agencies, medical exam-
iners and others identify missing persons who have been 
murdered or have died of other causes. Th is program, 
the National Missing and Unidentiﬁ ed Persons Initiative 
(NamUs) was created by the National Institute of Justice 
(NIJ) and brings together two existing programs and their 
online, searchable databases: IdentifyUs.org, which con-
tains data on unidentiﬁ ed human remains and Find-the-
Missing.org, which provides information about missing 
persons (“NIJ Begins Work on Database,” 2007, p.7).
 
For an unknown victim, record a complete descrip-
tion and take photographs if possible. Check these against 
missing-persons ﬁ les. Circulate the description and pho-
tograph in the surrounding area. Check the victim’s cloth-
ing for possible laundry marks or for labels that might 
indicate where the clothes were purchased.
 
If the body is badly decomposed, the bones provide 
a basis for estimating height, sex and approximate age as 
well as proof that the deceased was a human. If there are 
leads to whom the victim might be, you can attempt iden-
tiﬁ cation by comparing dental charts and X-rays of prior 
Bones often assist in identiﬁ cation of victims through comparison 
with health and dental records. If a victim’s identity is unknown, 
bones can be used to create a facial model of what the victim 
may have looked like. Here, Trooper Sarah Foster, a Michigan 
State Police forensic artist, measures a three-dimensional facial

make. Th e body is still warm; mucous membranes are 
still moist but drying; blood is still moist but drying; the 
pupils have begun to dilate; and in fair-skinned people, the 
skin is becoming pale. Th is characteristic of recent death 
becomes less discernable as skin pigmentation increases.
DEATH THAT OCCURRED ONE-HALF HOUR TO 
4 DAYS PRIOR
Generally, if the death occurred within the past 4 days but 
more than one-half hour ago, the mucous membranes and 
any blood from the wounds are dry, there are skin blisters 
and skin slippage, the body is slightly pink, body tempera-
ture has dropped, rigor mortis and postmortem lividity 
are present and the pupils are restricted and cloudy.
Body Temperature Th ough not an accurate measure of 
time of death, body temperature is helpful in conjunction with 
other factors. Algor mortis refers to the postmortem cool-
ing process of the body and can be extremely helpful in homi-
cide investigations. After death, the body tends to assume the 
temperature of its environment. Record the temperature of 
the surroundings and the amount of clothing on the body. 
Reach under the clothing to determine the body’s warmth 
or coldness. Compare this with exposed parts of the body to 
determine whether the clothing is retaining body heat.
Body temperature drops 2 to 3 degrees in the ﬁ rst hour 
after death and 1 to 1.5 degrees for each subsequent hour 
until 18 hours.
 
Th e time of death relates directly to whether the suspect 
could have been at the scene and to the sequence of multiple 
deaths. It is also important to the victim’s family in settling 
insurance claims and Social Security and pension payments.
 
Both the investigator and the medical examiner or 
coroner are responsible for estimating the time of death. 
Knowing how the professional examiner estimates time 
of death helps investigators to understand better what 
circumstances are important at the crime scene and alerts 
them to observe and record speciﬁ c factors that aid in 
estimating the time of death, including environmental (or 
ambient) temperature. Some of these factors are available 
only to the ﬁ rst oﬃ  cers at the scene.
 
Without eyewitnesses, the time of death is seldom com-
pletely accurate. Normally, however, the time of the death—if 
it has occurred within the past 4 days—can be determined to 
within 4 hours, depending on the examiner’s expertise and 
the factors available for examination. Figure 8.2 shows the 
timing of various body changes after death.
Factors that help in estimating the time of death are 
body temperature, rigor mortis, postmortem lividity 
(livor), eye appearance, stomach contents, stage of 
decomposition and evidence suggesting a change in 
the victim’s normal routine.

this condition, the victim was holding the weapon at the 
moment of death.
A weapon tightly clutched in the victim’s hand as the 
result of cadaveric spasm indicates suicide.
 
Ensure that the weapon clutched was the murder 
weapon. It might be that both the victim and an assailant 
were armed and that the death was not suicide. Likewise, 
absence of cadaveric spasm does not preclude suicide 
because it does not always occur.
Postmortem Lividity When the heart stops beat-
ing at death, the blood no longer circulates and grav-
ity drains the blood to the body’s lowest levels. Th is 
causes a dark blue or purple discoloration of the body 
called postmortem lividity, or livor mortis. Lividity 
is cherry red or a strong pink if death has been caused by 
carbon monoxide poisoning, and various other poisons 
give lividity other colors.
 
If a body is on its back, lividity appears in the lower 
portion of the back and legs. If facedown, it appears on 
the face, chest, stomach and legs. If the body is on its side, 
lividity appears on the side on which the body is resting 
and if the body is upright, it appears in the buttocks and 
lower legs.
Postmortem lividity starts one-half to 3 hours after 
death and is congealed in the capillaries in 4 to 5 hours. 
 Maximum lividity occurs within 10 to 12 hours.
 
Any part of the body pressing directly on a hard sur-
face does not show lividity because the pressure of the 
body’s weight prevents blood from entering the blood 
vessels in that area. If blood has been released from large 
wounds, very little if any lividity occurs.
 
Postmortem lividity and bruises appear similar, but 
they are easy to distinguish. When bruises are pressed 
with the thumb or ﬁ ngers, they remain the same, whereas 
lividity turns white, or blanches, when pressure is applied. 
If the blood has already congealed, an incision reveals 
whether the blood is still in the vessels (lividity) or out-
side them (bruise). In addition, the color of a bruise varies, 
whereas the color of lividity is uniform.
The location of lividity can indicate whether a body was 
moved after death.
 
Besides helping to establish time of death and some-
times the cause, lividity helps determine whether the body 
 
Some investigators use the formula of 1.5 degrees 
cooling per hour, assuming an internal temperature of 
98.6° F and an environmental temperature of 70° to 75° F,
with the rate of loss adjusted up and down depending 
on the actual environmental temperature and with the 
accuracy decreasing after 10 hours. Th e formula would 
be 98.5 – T / 1.5 = N, where T equals rectal tempera-
ture in degrees Fahrenheit and N is the number of hours 
since death.
 
Th ese times vary in abnormally hot or cold environ-
ments. Also, body temperature drops more slowly in large 
or obese people, if a high fever was present before death, 
if humidity prevents evaporation or if strenuous physical 
activity occurred immediately before death.
Rigor Mortis Th e body is limp after death until rigor 
mortis sets in. Rigor mortis, a Latin term that literally 
translates to “stiﬀ ness of death,” is a stiﬀ ening of the 
joints of the body after death because of partial skeletal 
muscle contraction. Onset may occur anywhere from 
10 minutes to several hours postmortem, depending on 
physical conditions concerning the body and the environ-
ment. Excitement, vigorous activity, heavy clothing and 
abnormally high temperatures increase the rapidity of 
rigor; cold slows it. Babies and the aged have little rigor.
 
Rigor mortis is ﬁ rst noticed in smaller muscles, such 
as those of the face, and spreads to larger muscle groups 
throughout the body, reaching maximum rigor between 
12 and 24 hours. Th e body can remain rigid for approxi-
mately 3 days, until the muscles themselves begin to 
decompose, although rigor generally begins to diminish 
after 36 hours postmortem.
Rigor mortis appears as a stiffening of muscles several 
hours after death, with maximum stiffness occurring 12 to 
24 hours after death. Rigor then begins to disappear and 
is generally gone after 3 days postmortem.
 
Th e degree of rigor mortis as an indicator of time of 
death is usually accurate to within 4 hours when used 
along with other factors, such as ambient temperature.
 
Closely associated with rigor mortis is cadaveric 
spasm, a condition that occurs in speciﬁ c muscle groups 
rather than the entire body. It occurs most often when 
the victim is holding something at the time of death. Th e 
hand closes tightly around the object because of the stress 
and tension of death. Th e condition does not disappear 
as rigor mortis does, and it cannot be induced by another 
person. Cadaveric spasm does not always occur, but when 
it does, it helps establish whether death was a homicide 
or a suicide. If a dead person is found tightly clutching a 
gun or knife and this is the only area of the body showing 

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 269
was moved after death occurred. Postmortem lividity in 
a body moved immediately after death would provide no 
clues. However, if the body was moved to a diﬀ erent posi-
tion after lividity had set in, lividity will occur in unlikely 
areas, indicating that the body was moved.
Examination of the Eyes Th e appearance of the eyes 
also assists in estimating the time of death. After death, 
eye muscle tone lessens and tends to disappear. Th e pupils 
tend to dilate.
A partial restriction of the pupil occurs in about 7 hours. 
In 12 hours, the cornea appears cloudy.
 
Th e cornea clouds more rapidly if the eyes are open 
after death. During the medical examination, ﬂ uid can be 
withdrawn from the eyeball (or the spine) to determine 
the level of potassium, which tends to rise at a predictable 
rate after death.
Examination of Stomach Contents Although the 
stomach contents must be examined during the medi-
cal examination, the investigator can provide important 
information for the examiner: “It has been determined 
through extensive research that under ordinary circum-
stances, the stomach empties its contents four to six hours 
after a meal. If the stomach is found at autopsy to be ﬁ lled 
with food and digestion of the contents not extensive, it 
is reasonable to assume that death followed shortly after 
the meal. If the stomach is entirely empty, death probably 
took place at least four to six hours after the last meal. If 
the small intestine is also empty, the probability is that 
death took place at least 12 or more hours after the last 
meal” (Geberth, 2007a, pp.62–63).
Determine when and what the victim last ate. If any 
vomit is present, preserve it as evidence and submit it for 
examination.
 
Attempt to ﬁ nd out when the victim last ate. Th e 
medical examiner can often determine how long the vic-
tim lived after eating because digestion is a fairly constant 
process, measurable in hours. If the victim has vomited, 
the stomach is empty and will distort the estimate of time 
of death; therefore, report the presence of any vomit near 
the body. Preserve such vomit as evidence, as it may pro-
vide information on drugs or poisons related to the cause 
of death.
MANY DAYS AFTER DEATH
It is more diﬃ  cult to estimate the ToD if death occurred 
several days before discovery of the body. Th e cadaver 
is bloated, lividity is darkened, the abdomen is green-
ish, blisters are ﬁ lled with gas and a distinct odor is 
present.
Decomposition Th e medical examiner makes a rough 
estimate of time of death based on the body’s state of decom-
position. Decomposition is ﬁ rst observed as an extended 
stomach and abdomen, the result of internal gases devel-
oping. In general, decomposition is increased by higher 
temperatures and decreased by lower temperatures.
Postmortem lividity. When the heart 
stops beating at death, the blood no 
longer circulates, and gravity drains 
the blood to the body’s lowest levels. 
This results in a dark blue or purple 
discoloration of the body called 
postmortem lividity. Lividity patterns 
can indicate whether a body has been 
moved after death. This 48-year-old 
white male fell asleep against a fence 
and died of heart disease. When he 
was found the following afternoon, 
lividity indicated he had been dead 
approximately 18 hours and had died in 
that position. (Lakewood Police Department 
Crime Lab)

270 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
notes the forensic entomologists can provide an accurate 
estimate of the postmortem interval and often additional 
information such as whether the body was moved and 
the location where the murder occurred. He also notes, 
“In some rare instances, insect evidence has been used to 
identify a murderer in even more spectacular ways. On 
one occasion, all but one part of a crushed grasshopper 
was found at a murder scene. Th e remaining piece of the 
puzzle, a fractured grasshopper leg, was located inside the 
pant cuﬀ  of the perpetrator. Yet another time, a body was 
found in one of the very few rural areas of Southern Cali-
fornia where chiggers are known to attack humans. In this 
case, chigger bites found on the murderer greatly helped 
during court proceedings.”
EFFECTS OF WATER
Stevens (2007, p.110) cautions, “For too long the word 
‘drowning’ has been synonymous with ‘accident.’” An 
understanding of the drowning process will beneﬁ t the 
investigation by enabling detectives to recover evidence 
that might indicate foul play (Stevens, p.113). Bodies 
immersed in water for some time undergo changes that 
help investigators determine whether the drowning was 
accidental or a homicide. A body immersed in water may 
decompose rapidly, depending on the water tempera-
ture, salinity, mineral content and eﬀ ects of ﬁ sh and 
other marine life.
 
If the body is in a hot, moist location, a soapy appear-
ance called adipocere develops. Th is takes as long as 3 
months to develop fully. Attacks by insects, bacteria, ani-
mals and birds also increase the decomposition rate.
 
Complete dehydration of all body tissues results in 
mummiﬁ cation. A cadaver left in an extremely dry, hot 
area will mummify in about a year and will remain in this 
condition for several years if undisturbed by animals or 
insects.
 
Th e presence on the body of insect eggs, their stage 
of development and the life cycle of the species, as well 
as various stages of vegetation on or near the body, also 
provide information about the time of death. A forensic 
entomologist (FE) can examine various types of insects to 
assist in estimating the time of death. Table 8.3 provides 
a checklist for investigators working a homicide where 
entomological evidence is found.
 
Examination of insects is especially helpful when 
death occurred more than a week before. Insects can detect 
newly dead body odors two miles away. Because particular 
insects work or rest during the day or the night, the types 
of insects at the scene provide clues as to the timing of the 
body’s deterioration. Furthermore, it is possible to tie a 
suspect to the area in which a body is found by comparing 
evidence on the body with insect parts smashed on the 
suspect’s windshield, grille or other vehicle parts. Rowe 
(2007, p.55) contends, “Forensic entomology is an exact 
science, supported by hard data from experiments.” He 
Carbon monoxide poisoning. When carbon monoxide is 
inhaled, it enters the bloodstream and displaces oxygen 
from the blood. Reddish lividity, as seen on the body in this 
photo, indicates carbon monoxide poisoning. This 35-year-
old white male committed suicide by lying next to a running 
vehicle in a closed garage. (Lakewood Police Department Crime Lab)

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 271
 
Several factors can alert an investigator to whether a 
drowning is a suicide, an accident or a homicide (Stevens, 
2007, p.117):
• • Body placement. In a drowning, most victims curl up 
in a semi-fetal position.
• • Lividity and rigor mortis. Lividity, position of rigor 
mortis and blanching of the body can show if the per-
son was dead before entering the water.
• • Th e victim’s eyes. Drowning victims’ eyes glisten for a 
short time when they are brought up but quickly dry 
out. If half the eye looks dry when examined imme-
diately after being pulled from the water, the victim 
probably died on land.
 
Th e medical examination also determines whether 
the person was alive or dead at the time the body was 
immersed in water. Th is provides evidence to support 
homicide, suicide or accidental death.
 
As with insects found on bodies on land, diatoms and 
algal material can help forensic biologists determine the 
time of death for bodies found in water, as well as whether 
the person was drowned. Diatoms are tiny, single-celled 
aquatic organisms that live in both saltwater and freshwa-
ter environments. Th e composition of diatoms in one par-
ticular body of water or aquatic ecosystem is often unique 
and can be distinguished from other groups of diatoms 
from other locations. Th us, forensic biologists who collect 
diatoms from a suspect’s shoes and match them to the 
population of diatoms existing in a pond where a murder 
victim was found can help investigators place that suspect 
at the crime scene.
FACTORS SUGGESTING A CHANGE IN THE 
VICTIM’S ROUTINE
Check telephone calls made to and by the victim. Check 
dates on mail and newspapers and expiration dates on 
food in the refrigerator. Determine who normally pro-
vides services to the victim, such as dentists, doctors, 
barbers, hairdressers and clerks. Find out whether any 
appointments were not kept. Were any routines discon-
tinued, such as playing cards or tennis, going to work on 
schedule or riding a particular bus? Was there food on the 
stove or the table? Was the stove on? Were the lights, tele-
vision, radio or stereo on or oﬀ ? Were pets fed? Were dirty 
dishes on the counters or in the sink? Was this normal for 
the victim? Was a ﬁ re burning in the ﬁ replace? Was the 
damper left open? Determining all such facts helps esti-
mate the ToD and can corroborate the estimate based on 
physical ﬁ ndings.
A dead body usually sinks in water and remains im-
mersed for 8 to 10 days in warm water or 2 to 3 weeks in 
cold water. It then rises to the surface unless restricted. 
The outer skin loosens in 5 to 6 days, and the nails sepa-
rate in 2 to 3 weeks.

272 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
 
After the autopsy is completed, the cause of death, if 
determined, is recorded. Deaths not recorded as natural, 
suicide or accidental are recorded as either undetermined 
or homicide. Before making a ﬁ nal determination, the 
medical examiner reads the police investigation reports 
to date. Th ese reports indicate prior symptoms such as 
vomiting, a comatose state, partial paralysis, slow or rapid 
respiration, convulsions and various colorations.
 
During the investigation, report everything relating 
to the cause of death to the pathologist. Likewise, infor-
mation discovered by the pathologist is conveyed to the 
investigative team.
 
Pennsylvania has passed a law mandating that before 
any body is cremated, the coroner must approve the crema-
tion. Although an autopsy is not done, the body is exam-
ined and X-rays are usually taken. Th is law is intended to 
decrease the likelihood of a murder going unnoticed.
EXHUMING A BODY FOR MEDICAL 
EXAMINATION
It is not common to exhume a body. Usually this is done 
to determine whether the cause of death stated on the 
death certiﬁ cate is valid. It may also be done if the body 
is suspected of having been buried to conceal the cause of 
death or if the identity of the body is in question.
 
Exhuming a body requires adherence to strict legal 
procedures to prevent later civil action by relatives. First, 
obtain permission from the principal relatives. If they 
do not grant it, it is necessary to obtain a court order to 
proceed. Arrange to have the coroner or medical exam-
iner, a police representative, a gravedigger, a cemetery 
oﬃ  cial and a family member present at the exhumation. 
Have the cemetery oﬃ  cial or the person who placed the 
THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION 
OR AUTOPSY
After the preliminary investigation, the body is 
taken to the morgue for an autopsy. a term 
derived from the Greek autopsia, meaning “to see for one-
self.“ Most large departments have medical examiners 
and forensic pathologists on staﬀ  or available as consul-
tants for autopsies. Th e medical or forensic pathologist 
assists investigations by relating the evidence to the 
autopsy ﬁ ndings. Th e study of 800 homicides (“Secrets of 
Success,” p.6) found that the presence of detectives at the 
postmortem examination nearly doubled the likelihood of 
a clearance.
 
Th e main purpose of the coroner’s or medical exam-
iner’s (ME) oﬃ  ce is to determine the cause and manner of 
death (Downs, 2007, p.44). If no unnatural cause is found, 
no crime exists. Much of the evidence that leads the exam-
iner to conclude that the death was murder also provides 
corroborating evidence for investigating and prosecuting 
the case; therefore, pathologists and investigators work 
together closely.
 
Certain types of death must be investigated. These 
include all violent deaths, whether homicide, suicide or 
an accident; sudden deaths not caused by a recogniz-
able disease; deaths under suspicious circumstances, 
including those of persons whose bodies will be cre-
mated, dissected, buried at sea or otherwise made 
unavailable for further examination; deaths (other 
than from disease) of inmates in prisons or public 
institutions; deaths caused by disease that may consti-
tute a public threat; and deaths resulting from hazard-
ous employment.
 
Before an autopsy, the body is kept intact. An inves-
tigator present at the autopsy records the location, date, 
time, names of those attending and the name of the 
person who performs the autopsy. Th e body is weighed, 
measured, and photographed before the autopsy begins 
and is then periodically photographed as each stage is 
completed. Facial features and any marks, cuts, wounds, 
bruises or unusual conditions are photographed close up. 
Th e deceased, including clothing, is completely described. 
Th e clothing is tagged, marked for identiﬁ cation and sent 
to the police laboratory for examination. Fingerprints 
are usually taken, even if the body has been personally 
identiﬁ ed.
The medical examination provides evidence related to 
the cause and time of death and to the presence of drugs 
or alcohol.
Technology Innovations
A new technology that uses a total body scan is 
supplementing traditional autopsies (Siuru, 2006, p.38):
Autopsies to determine cause of death from 
crimes or accidents can now be done without a 
scalpel or any blood. Instead, pathologists and 
medical examiners can use multi-slice computed 
tomography (MSCT) scanning and magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) scanning. Both are based on 
the CT or CAT scan and MRI techniques that are 
now routine medical procedures performed on the 
living. Virtual autopsies allow determination of 
cause of death while still treating the deceased 
with respect for their religious beliefs.

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 273
marker identify the grave. Photograph the general area, 
the speciﬁ c grave with the marker and the coﬃ  n before 
exhumation.
 
Present at the lid opening at the morgue are the coro-
ner, police, family, undertaker and pathologist. Th e body 
is then identiﬁ ed by the persons present if they knew the 
deceased, and the examination is conducted.
UNNATURAL CAUSES OF 
DEATH AND METHOD USED
As just discussed, in all cases of violent death, 
industrial or accidental death, or suicide, the 
medical examiner determines the cause of death. A num-
ber of deaths involve circumstances that are investigated 
by police and the medical examiner, even though many 
are not criminal homicides.
Among the most common causes of unnatural death 
are gunshot wounds; stabbing and cutting wounds; 
blows from blunt objects; asphyxia induced by choking, 
drowning, hanging, smothering, strangulation, gases or 
poisons; poisoning and drug overdose; burning; explo-
sions, electrocution and lightning; drug-related deaths; 
and vehicular deaths.
 
Table 8.4 indicates the probability of a speciﬁ c 
cause of death being the result of an accident, suicide or 
homicide.
GUNSHOT WOUNDS
Most deaths caused by gunshot wounds result from dis-
charges of handguns, riﬂ es or shotguns. Knowing the type 
of weapon is important for making comparison tests and 
locating unknown weapons. Th e major cause of death from 
gunshot wounds is internal hemorrhaging and shock. Th e 
size, number and velocity of the ammunition used and the 
type of weapon determine the eﬀ ect on the body.
 
Shots ﬁ red from a large distance produce little or no 
powder tattooing or carbons on the skin around where the 
bullet entered the body, and it is diﬃ  cult to determine the 
exact distance—even though the angle of trajectory can 
be determined from the bullet’s path through the body. 
In the intermediate-distance range, tattooing appears on 
the clothing or the body when handguns are ﬁ red from 
as much as approximately 2 feet away. Powder tattooing 
results from both burned and unburned powder. By using 
test-ﬁ ring pattern comparisons with the same weapon 
and ammunition, the actual ﬁ ring distance can be deter-
mined. GSR evidence was discussed in Chapter 5.
 
If the muzzle of the weapon was in direct contact with 
the body, contact wounds will be evident. You may notice 
a muzzle impression on the skin and soot or powder frag-
ments in the entrance area or around the wound. At the 
entry point, the hole is smaller than the bullet because the 
skin’s elasticity closes the entry point slightly. Entrance 
wounds are normally round or oval with little bleeding. 
As the bullet passes through the skin, it leaves a gray to 
black abrasion collar around the edges of the entrance 
wound.
 
The exit wound is usually larger than the entrance 
wound, but this is not always the case. The exit wound 
A medical examination or an autopsy 
provides legal evidence related to 
the cause and time of death and 
the presence of alcohol or drugs 
in the system of the deceased. The 
main job of the coroner’s or medical 
examiner’s ofﬁ ce is to determine the 
cause of death. Much of the evidence 
that leads the examiner to conclude 
a death was murder also provides 
corroborating evidence for investigating 
and prosecuting the case; therefore, 
pathologists and investigators work 
together closely. Before an autopsy, 
the body condition is kept intact and is 
photographed in this state. In addition to 
being weighed and measured, the body 
is periodically photographed as each 
stage of the examination is completed.

274 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
Th e bullet’s path or angle helps to determine the angle at 
which the weapon was ﬁ red and therefore the suspect’s 
possible location at the time of ﬁ ring. Th is angle also helps 
diﬀ erentiate between suicide and murder.
 
When investigating gunshot deaths, determine 
whether the death was to the result of the wound or to 
some other injury. Was the wound impossible for the vic-
tim to have produced? What is the approximate distance 
from which the weapon was ﬁ red? Were there one or 
more wounds? Examine the victim’s hands to determine 
whether he or she ﬁ red the gun. What was the position of 
the body when found?
Gunshot wounds
• • Suicide indicators:
 
• Gun held against skin
 
•  Wound in mouth or in right temple if victim is 
right-handed and left temple if left-handed
 
• Not shot through clothing, unless shot in the chest
 
• Weapon present, especially if tightly held in hand
• • Murder indicators:
 
• Gun ﬁ red from more than a few inches away
 
• Angle or location that rules out self-inﬂ iction
 
• Shot through clothing
 
• No weapon present
also bleeds more profusely and has no abrasion collar. 
It is typically larger because gases build up in the body, 
especially from shots at close range, and tissues bunch 
up ahead of the bullet until reaching the outer skin. 
Elasticity then forces the skin outward until it breaks, 
permitting the bullet and the gases to pass through. 
The exit wound is generally jagged and torn. The differ-
ence between entrance and exit wounds is observable.
 
Shotgun wounds are distinctly diﬀ erent because 
numerous pellets penetrate the body. At close range these 
leave a much larger hole than does a bullet, and at farther 
range, they produce a discernible pellet pattern. Both the 
entrance and exit wounds are larger than those produced 
by single bullets.
 
Shotgun-wound patterns and the appearance of en -
t rance and exit wounds from handguns and riﬂ es help 
determine the distance from which the gun was ﬁ red. 
Contact wounds (ﬁ red at point-blank range) cause a large 
entrance wound with smudging around the edges. Th e 
principal damage is caused by the blasting and ﬂ ame of 
the powder. Smudging around a wound can be wiped oﬀ , 
but the tattooing pattern cannot be eliminated. If the gun 
is more than 18 inches from the body when ﬁ red, no tat-
tooing or smudging occurs.
 
In addition, a bullet or pellets from any weapon 
produce a track through the body that follows the angle 
between the weapon and the victim at the time of ﬁ ring.

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 275
Cutting Wounds With cutting wounds, external bleeding 
is generally the cause of death. Cutting wounds are frequently 
the result of suicide. It is common in such cases to observe 
hesitation wounds in areas where the main wound occurs. 
Th ese less severe, superﬁ cial cutting marks are caused by 
attempts to build up enough nerve to make the fatal wound.
 
Suicidal cutting wounds are made at an angle related 
to the hand that held the weapon, generally in a down-
ward direction because of the natural pull of the arm as it 
is brought across the body.
Stabbing and cutting wounds
• • Suicide indicators:
 
• Hesitation wounds
 
• Wounds under clothing
 
• Weapon present, especially if tightly clutched
 
• Usually wounds at throat, wrists or ankles
 
• Seldom disﬁ gurement
 
• Body not moved
• • Murder indicators:
    
• Defense wounds
 
• Wounds through clothing
 
• No weapon present
 
• Usually injuries to vital organs
 
• Disﬁ gurement
 
• Body moved
BLOWS FROM BLUNT OBJECTS
Fatal injuries can result from hands and feet and blows 
with various blunt objects, including hammers, clubs, 
heavy objects and rocks. It is often impossible to deter-
mine the speciﬁ c type of weapon involved. Th e injuries can 
occur to any part of the body and can result in visible exter-
nal bruises. Th e size of the bruise may not correspond to 
the size of the weapon because blood escapes into a larger 
area. Severe bruises are not often found in suicides.
 
In battered-child investigations, it has been found 
that death rarely results from a single blow or a single 
series of blows but, rather, from physical abuse over an 
extended period. An autopsy reveals prior broken bones 
or injuries. Death may also have been caused by starvation 
or other forms of neglect.
 
Falls can cause death or can be used to conceal the 
real cause of death. In some cases, the victim is taken to 
a staircase and pushed down after being severely beaten. 
Intoxication is often given as the reason for the fall, but 
this can easily be checked through blood tests.
ASPHYXIA
Asphyxiation results when the body tissues and the brain 
receive insuﬃ  cient oxygen to support the red blood cells. 
STABBING AND CUTTING WOUNDS
Stabbing and cutting wounds diﬀ er in shape, size and 
extent of external and internal bleeding. A knife is the 
most frequently used weapon. Th e weapon and wound can 
be diﬀ erent sizes, depending on the depth and severity of 
the wound and whether it is into or across the tissues and 
ﬁ bers.
Stab Wounds Stab wounds are caused by thrusting 
actions. Th ey vary in size in diﬀ erent areas of the body but 
are usually smaller than cutting wounds. A stab wound in 
a soft part of the body produces a larger hole than does 
one in the head or a bony area. Ice-pick wounds in a skull 
covered by a substantial amount of hair can easily be 
missed on initial examination.
 
Th e major damage in stab wounds is to internal tis-
sues, followed by bleeding, primarily internal. Th e extent 
and rapidity of internal bleeding depends on the size of 
the blood vessels aﬀ ected. In most cases, the cause of 
death is bleeding rather than damage to a vital organ. A 
stab wound can be deeper than the length of the weapon 
used because the force of the thrust on the softer tissues 
can compress the body’s surface inward.
 
Even if a weapon is found, it can rarely be designated 
as the murder weapon unless part of it separates and 
remains in the body or it contains blood, tissue and ﬁ bers 
from the deceased.
 
Most stabbing deaths are murders. In murders, stab 
wounds can be single or multiple and can be in several 
areas of the body if the victim attempted self-defense. 
Defense wounds—cuts on the hands, arms and legs—
result when the victim attempts to ward oﬀ  the attacker.
The muzzle impression on the skin around the gunshot wound 
indicates the weapon was held in direct contact with the body. Gun 
powder residue on the victim’s hand may support suicide, as would 
a wound occurring on the same side of the head as the victim’s 
handedness (i.e., a right-handed victim would usually hold a gun to the 
right side of his or her own head). (© 2000–2005 Custom Medical Stock Photo)

just below the ears. Observe the condition and angle of 
these marks and save the entire rope, including the knot, 
as evidence.
Strangulation Strangulation by rope, hands, wire or 
scarf produces the same eﬀ ect as hanging. In both, the 
cause of death is total constriction of air. In contrast to 
hangings, however, the ligature marks caused by stran-
gulation are normally evenly grooved and are horizontal 
around the neck. In cases of manual strangulation, marks 
often remain from the hand pressure.
In asphyxiation deaths, most cases of choking, drowning 
and smothering are accidental; most cases of hanging 
are suicides; most cases of strangulation are murder.
Poisons, Chemicals and Overdoses of Sleeping 
Pills Asphyxiating chemicals, including ammonia and 
chloroform, can cause irritation severe enough to totally 
constrict the breathing passages. Ingestion of certain 
chemicals and drugs can also cause constriction and 
blockage of the airways. Examination of the air passages 
indicates paralysis.
 
Asphyxiation can occur by breathing carbon monox-
ide (CO), a method chosen by some to commit suicide. 
Accidental carbon monoxide poisoning can occur from 
improperly installed or malfunctioning gas appliances, 
such as furnaces, water heaters and clothes dryers. Using 
charcoal grills indoors or burning wood in an improperly 
vented ﬁ replace can also lead to CO poisoning.
Autoerotic Asphyxiation In autoerotic asphyxia-
tion, the victim has sought to intensify sexual gratiﬁ ca-
tion by placing a rope or other ligature around the neck 
and causing just enough constriction to create hypoxia, 
or a deﬁ ciency of oxygen in the bloodstream that results 
in semiconsciousness. Such experimentation may be 
successful a number of times, but then results in total 
unconsciousness rather than semiconsciousness. In such 
a case, the body goes limp in the noose, and the body’s 
weight tightens the noose, causing death. Although not 
common, autoerotic asphyxiation should be recognized 
by police oﬃ  cers. In these instances, suicides are in fact 
tragic accidents that occurred during dangerous auto-
erotic acts. Such deaths are classiﬁ ed into three categories: 
suﬀ ocation, strangulation and chemical asphyxia—the 
most common of which is strangulation resulting from 
suspension of the body. In such cases, the body is usu-
ally touching the ground and the victim is often bound. 
Analysis will show, however, that the binding could have 
been done by the victim.
 
Indicators of accidental death during autoerotic prac-
tices include
An examination of blood cells shows this lack of oxygen. 
Discoloration occurs in all dead bodies, but in asphyxia 
deaths, it is usually more pronounced and varied because of 
the lack of oxygen—especially in the blood vessels closest 
to the skin surface. It is most noticeable as a blue or purple 
color around the lips, ﬁ ngernails and toenails. Although 
you need not know the varied coloration produced by dif-
ferent causes and chemicals, be certain to record precise 
descriptions of coloration that can be interpreted by the 
medical examiner and related to probable cause of death.
 
Asphyxia deaths result from many causes, including 
choking, drowning, smothering, hanging, strangulation, 
swallowing of certain chemicals, poisoning and overdos-
ing on sleeping pills. Asphyxiation may also result from 
certain types of autoerotic behavior.
Choking Foreign bodies in the throat cause choking, 
as do burial in grain or sand slides or rapid pneumonia in 
infants in cribs. Such deaths are almost always accidental.
Drowning Most drownings are accidental. Murder is 
rarely proven unless witnesses are present. If a dead body 
is placed in water to make it appear as though death was 
caused by drowning, a medical examination can determine 
whether the person was dead when immersed. If acciden-
tal or suicide, diatoms and algae material will be found in 
lungs. In a homicide, diatoms or algae may be found on 
the mouth or lips but not in the lungs. However, if the 
victim was killed by drowning, these organisms would be 
sucked into the lungs as the person struggled to escape 
and surface, similar to what happens to someone who 
accidentally drowns.
Smothering Smothering is an uncommon means of 
murder, despite many ﬁ ctional depictions of this method. 
Intoxicated persons, the elderly and infants are most 
likely to be victims of smothering, usually by the hands or 
a pillow. Often, however, such deaths are accidental. For 
example, an infant weak from disease may turn over, face 
downward or become tangled in bedclothes and acciden-
tally suﬀ ocate.
Hanging Hangings are normally suicides, but murders 
have been made to appear as suicides. Some hangings 
result from experimentation to achieve sexual satisfac-
tion, as discussed later. In suicides, the pressure on the 
neck is usually generated by standing on a chair or stool 
and kicking the support away, jumping oﬀ  or simply let-
ting the body hang against the noose. (A body need not 
be completely suspended to result in death by hanging.) 
Although it is commonly thought that death results from 
a broken neck, it is usually the result of a broken trachea 
or a complete constriction of the air supply.
 
In hangings, the ligature marks start from the area 
of the neck below the chin and travel upward to the point 

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 277
can determine the type of poison, the amount ingested, 
the approximate time ingested and the eﬀ ect on the body.
 
Investigators should ask the following questions to 
help determine if a homicidal poisoning has occurred 
(Steck-Flynn, 2007, p.125):
• • Was the death sudden?
• • Has the caregiver been associated with other illnesses 
or death?
• • Did the victim receive medical treatment and appear 
to recover, only to die later?
• • Did the caregiver have access to restricted drugs or 
other chemicals?
• • Was the victim isolated by the caregiver? Did the care-
giver position himself or herself to be the only one 
with access to the victim’s food or medications?
• • Was there a history of inﬁ delity of either the victim or 
spouse?
• • Is there a history of the deaths of more than one child?
 
If a child is poisoned by accidentally ingesting clean-
ing ﬂ uid, detergents, pills or other such substances, the 
parents are sometimes charged with manslaughter or 
negligent homicide.
 
An overdose death is not necessarily a suicide. It 
might have been accidental—a result of the person’s 
not knowing when medication was last taken or being 
in a semi-stupor and taking more pills than intended. 
If a prescription bottle is found, determine from family 
members how many pills were in the bottle before the 
death. Check with the issuing pharmacist to determine 
whether it was a legal prescription, how many pills 
were prescribed and the date the prescription was last 
filled. Preserve all evidence until the coroner’s office 
rules the death accidental or a suicide. Other important 
evidence includes the medicine cabinet’s contents, any 
excretions or vomit at the scene and any food the vic-
tim recently ate.
BURNING
Most deaths by burning are accidental. However, a death 
resulting from burns received in a ﬁ re caused by arson is 
classiﬁ ed as murder. Moreover, people sometimes try to 
disguise murder by burning the victim’s body. Even in 
the most destructive ﬁ res, however, considerable infor-
mation is available from an autopsy because bones are 
not easily burned. Even in extreme heat, enough blood 
usually remains to enable a carbon monoxide analysis to 
determine whether the victim was alive at the time of the 
ﬁ re. In extremely hot ﬁ res, however, the heat may cause 
the skin to break open, and the resulting wounds may 
appear to be knife or other wounds inﬂ icted by an assail-
ant before the ﬁ re.
• • Nude or sexually exposed victim
• • Evidence of solo sexual activity
• • Mirrors placed to observe the ritual
• • Evidence of masturbation and presence of such items 
as tissues or towels for cleanup
• • Presence of sexual fantasy aids or sexually stimulating 
paraphernalia (vibrators, dildos, sex aids and porno-
graphic magazines)
• • Presence of bondage
 
In addition to asphyxiation, investigators should be 
aware of other types of autoerotic fatalities.
OTHER TYPES OF AUTOEROTIC DEATH
Th ere is limited clinical or forensic information about 
other autoerotic fatalities, but in several documented 
cases, an act of risky solitary sexual behavior went fur-
ther than anticipated, leading to accidental death. Such 
fatalities have involved electrocution, crushing, sepsis 
following perforation of the bowel and accidental self-im-
palement. Investigators should look for similar types of 
indicators as described under “Autoerotic Asphyxiation” 
earlier. Such accidental fatalities can easily be misinter-
preted as suicide,
POISONING
Poisoning, one of the oldest methods of murder, can occur 
from an overwhelming dose that causes immediate death 
or from small doses that accumulate over time and cause 
death. Poisons can be injected into the blood or muscles, 
inhaled as gases, absorbed through the skin surface, taken 
in foods or liquids or inserted into the rectum or vagina. 
Steck-Flynn (2007, p.118) contends, “Th e savvy detective 
familiarizes himself with the signs of accidental poison-
ing, signs of possible toxins and the forensic tests used 
to prove homicidal poisoning took place.” She notes, “Th e 
terminally ill, mentally incapacitated, drug addicts, the 
elderly, and the very young are at highest risk of poison-
ing. Th e other high-risk group is the unwanted spouse or 
lover.” Perpetrators of homicidal poisonings are often 
employed in the medical or caregiving ﬁ elds (p.120).
 
Homicidal poisoning can be accomplished with any 
one of thousands of substances, but some are far more 
common that others. Among the most commonly used is 
arsenic, known as the King of Poisons and the Poison of 
Kings. Cyanide, also commonly used, is a favorite in mass 
homicides, suicides and politically motivated killings. 
Strychnine, given in large enough doses, produces “a dra-
matic and horrifying death with the victim’s body frozen 
in mid-convulsion, eyes wide open” (Steck-Flynn, 2007, 
pp.121–124). Experts in toxicology (the study of poisons) 

278 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
stabs her ex-boyfriend while he’s on a date with his new 
girlfriend. In these cases, the VOR is close and established. 
Instrumental violence is goal-directed predatory behav-
ior used to exert control—for example, the carjacker who 
shoots his victim before stealing the vehicle. Th e VOR in 
events involving instrumental violence may or may not 
be close, with such events commonly occurring between 
strangers who have no preestablished relationship.
 
A prevalent theory regarding VOR and risk of instrumental 
versus expressive violence is that a close relationship (spouse/
lover, family member, close personal friend) may protect a per-
son from certain types of instrumental violence (e.g., robbery) 
because they have someone to watch out for them, but it may 
also make them more vulnerable to expressive violence.
 
Drug traﬃ  cking operations commonly cross jurisdic-
tional boundaries, a factor that severely impedes the prog-
ress of an investigator working a drug traﬃ  cking murder. 
To better address this challenge, some areas have devel-
oped a violent traﬃ  ckers task force (VTTF). Investigating 
drug oﬀ enses is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 18.
VEHICULAR DEATHS
According to the National Highway Traﬃ  c Safety Adminis-
tration (NHTSA) (Motor Vehicle Crashes, 2008, p.1), motor 
vehicle traﬃ  c crashes were the leading cause of death for 
every age 3 through 6 and 8 through 34 in 2005. Vehicular 
homicide can result from reckless driving, driving under the 
inﬂ uence or other circumstances where a driver’s failure to 
obey the rules of the road, either intentionally or negligently, 
leads to the death of another person. Aggressive driving and 
road rage can escalate to a case of vehicular homicide: “Th e 
only diﬀ erence between a vehicular homicide and other 
homicides is the use of a motor vehicle as a weapon, as 
opposed to a gun or knife” (“Th e Facts,” no date).
 
When a traﬃ  c crash results in a fatality, all vehicles 
involved must be thoroughly examined. Document the 
condition of the vehicles through photographs and writ-
ten observations. Also of extreme importance are weather 
and road conditions at the time of the incident. An acci-
dent reconstruction expert must be brought in to help the 
investigator make sense of skid marks, impact dynamics 
and other factors present at the scene.
 
If the driver or drivers are still at the scene, obtain evi-
dence for a toxicology examination to determine whether 
there were any drugs in the person’s system at the time of 
the incident. Toxicology evidence is also necessary for the 
victim, even if that person wasn’t driving a car, because his 
or her condition before the incident may have played a role.
 
If the case is one of hit-and-run, physical evidence left 
at the scene, such as paint, metal shavings, tire impres-
sions and glass, can help link a suspect and a vehicle to 
the crime. Evidence to look for on the suspect’s vehicle 
includes hairs, ﬁ bers, blood and other biological ﬂ uids 
EXPLOSIONS, ELECTROCUTION AND LIGHTNING
Explosives can caused death from the direct tearing force of 
the blast, from a shock wave or from the victim being blown 
oﬀ  the top of a structure or against an object with enough 
force to cause death. Such deaths are usually accidental.
 
Electrocution paralyzes the heart muscle, causing rapid 
death. Nearly all electrocution deaths are accidental (except, 
of course, in capital punishment cases). High-voltage lines 
and lightning are the main causes. Lightning leaves linear 
stripes on the body, turns the skin blue and burns the skin, 
especially at the lightning bolt’s entry and exit points.
Poisoning deaths can be accidental, suicide or murder. 
Most deaths caused by burning, explosions, electrocu-
tion and lightning are accidental, although burning is 
sometimes used in an attempt to disguise murder.
DRUG-RELATED DEATHS
Many studies have documented the relationship between 
drugs and homicide and the prominent role drugs play in 
homicide events. Some evidence suggests that the decline 
in homicides since the early 1990s is partially attributable 
to declining levels of drug market activity: “Part of the 
homicide decline is likely due to a drop in the amount of 
drug market activity, some of it is attributable to the aging 
of drug market participants, and some appears to be due 
to unmeasured factors which may have created a ‘kinder 
and gentler’ drug market” (Ousey and Lee, 2007, p.48).
 
Th e same techniques used in general death investiga-
tions also apply to drug-related death investigations. Look for 
evidence of alcohol use or consumption of drugs (pill bottles 
or paraphernalia). Alcohol mixed with certain drugs can pose 
a particularly lethal combination. Prescription drugs are the 
leading cause of drug-related deaths in the United States.
 
Diﬀ erent categories of drug-related homicides include 
deadly disputes involving individuals high on drugs (no 
organized drug or gang aﬃ  liation); deaths caused during the 
commission of economically motivated crimes, such as rob-
bery, in the oﬀ ender’s eﬀ ort to get money to buy drugs; and 
murders associated with the systemic violence surrounding 
the drug business itself. Th is third category includes hits on 
traﬃ  ckers, dealers or buyers (may be gang related); assassi-
nations of law enforcement oﬃ  cers or others ﬁ ghting drug 
traﬃ  cking; and the killing of innocent bystanders in drug-
related disputes. Each category presents speciﬁ c investiga-
tive options, summarized in Table 8.5.
 
Th e victim-oﬀ ender relationship (VOR) requires an 
understanding of the diﬀ erence between expressive and 
instrumental violence.
 
Expressive violence is that stemming from hurt 
feelings, anger or rage, such as when the jealous lover 

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 279
enraged someone. Take the victim’s ﬁ ngerprints and deter-
mine whether any criminal history may lead to a suspect.
 
Interview personal contacts such as doctors, pas-
tors or counselors to learn about the victim’s physical 
and emotional condition, especially if it has not yet been 
determined whether the death was an accident, suicide 
or homicide. Th e person’s medical background may pro-
vide information about an extremely painful or terminal 
disease that could motivate suicide. Inquire about the 
victim’s mental stability. Most suicide victims attempt to 
avoid inﬂ icting severe pain on themselves when they take 
their lives, but this is not always true. One woman cut oﬀ  
both her feet before fatally stabbing herself in the chest. 
Some people set themselves on ﬁ re to commit suicide.
The victim’s background provides information about 
whether the death was an accident, suicide or 
 homicide. If a homicide, the background often provides 
leads to a suspect. Evidence on the victim’s body can 
also provide important leads.
from the victim. Th e vehicle may contain evidence of the 
impact. Evidence of fresh paint jobs or recent repairs war-
rants further investigation.
THE HOMICIDE VICTIM
In most crimes, the victim provides verbal details 
of what occurred. In homicides, the victim may 
be able to provide such information if witnesses or the 
police are present before death occurs. However, the infor-
mation usually comes from the crime scene, witnesses, 
physical and circumstantial evidence and the suspect.
 
Victims often know the person who killed them, so 
information about the deceased can furnish leads to the 
suspect. Obtain the victim’s name, address, age, sex, nation-
ality and type and place of work. Also ﬁ nd out the names 
of family members, close friends and known enemies and 
learn about the victim’s habits. Ask about any religious, 
political or business actions or remarks that might have

the highest midyear body count in nearly three decades.” 
Figure 8.3 shows the circumstances under which oﬃ  cers 
have been feloniously killed during the past 10 years.
WITNESSES
In violent criminal deaths, struggles often create 
noise and attract the attention of neighbors 
or passersby. Witnesses may know and name a suspect, or 
they may have seen the suspect or vehicle. Often, how-
ever, there are no witnesses, and information must be 
sought from family members, neighbors and associates. 
Conducting a neighborhood canvass is a critical step in a 
thorough homicide investigation.
 
St. Louis police have set up a homicide hotline with 
an untraceable number that murder witnesses can call 
to oﬀ er anonymous tips. Th e hotline is answered by a 
 
In violent murders, the victim may grab the suspect’s 
hair, shirt buttons or other parts of clothing or scratch and 
claw the suspect. A victim may leave injuries on the suspect, 
and traces of the suspect’s ﬂ esh may be found under the vic-
tim’s ﬁ ngernails. Identify and preserve all belongings and evi-
dence on or near the deceased. Carefully examine the location 
where the body was found if it is not where death occurred.
 
After the entire scene and the evidence have been 
photographed and sketched, move the body carefully. Lift 
it a few inches oﬀ  the surface and slide a sheet under it to 
catch any evidence that may fall while transporting the 
body to the vehicle. Itemize other possessions and send 
them along with the body to the morgue for later release 
to the family if they are not evidence.
 
Although you may use a body bag, ﬁ rst wrap the body in a 
clean, white sheet. Evidence on the body that falls oﬀ  is much 
easier to see on a sheet. Th e sheet also absorbs moisture.
DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE HOMICIDE
Joyce (2006, p.52) points out, “Domestic violence is a very sen-
sitive subject and unfortunately, too many homicides occur at 
the hands of a close family member. A detective needs to get to 
the absolute truth when determining the relationships main-
tained with family members.” Many batterers eventually kill 
their intimate (one out of six murders is a partner homicide), 
and women who leave their batterers face a 75 percent greater 
risk of being killed by them than do those who stay. In some 
cases, batterers themselves become victims of homicide.
 
Many of these murders occurred despite restrain-
ing orders on the intimate partner. In addition, four of 
ﬁ ve murders by females are reported to be responses to 
domestic violence.
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KILLED
Th e risk of being killed in the line of duty “comes with the 
job.” Although fewer than half of the oﬃ  cers killed on the 
job are gunned down or otherwise murdered, being shot and 
killed in the line of duty is still considered a very real risk of 
police work. Th e FBI reports that in 2006, 48 law enforce-
ment oﬃ  cers were feloniously killed as a result of 47 sepa-
rate incidents (Oﬃ  cers Feloniously Killed 2006). Of these, 12 
oﬃ  cers died as a result of felonious attacks during arrest 
situations; 10 were fatally assaulted when ambushed; 8 were 
killed while responding to disturbance calls (e.g., bar ﬁ ghts, 
family quarrels); 8 were killed while conducting traﬃ  c pur-
suits or stops; 6 died while investigating suspicious persons 
or circumstances; 2 were killed in tactical situations (barri-
caded oﬀ enders, hostage takers, high-risk entry, etc.); 1 died 
during the handling, transporting, or custody of a prisoner; 
and 1 was killed while handling a person with mental illness.

SUSPECTS
If the suspect is arrested at the crime scene, fol-
low the procedures described in Chapter 1. If 
the suspect is known but is not at the scene, immediately 
disseminate the description to other investigators, ﬁ eld 
oﬃ  cers and police agencies.
 
If the suspect is not known, identiﬁ cation becomes a 
priority. Often, several suspects are identiﬁ ed and eventually 
eliminated as information and evidence are obtained and the 
list is reduced to one or two prime suspects. In major cases, 
any number of suspects may be developed from information 
at the scene, from informants and from intelligence ﬁ les.
 
Discovering a motive is not a speciﬁ c requirement in 
the investigation, but motive is so closely tied to intent 
and to developing a suspect that it should be determined. 
Murders are committed for many reasons. Common types 
of criminal homicide include the anger killing, the love-
triangle killing, the revenge or jealousy killing, killing for 
proﬁ t, random killing, murder-suicide, the sex-and-sadism 
killing and felony murder. Anger killings often begin as 
assaults. Th e possibility of killing for proﬁ t almost always 
exists. Th us, it is always critical to determine who would 
stand to proﬁ t from the victim’s death.
Determine the motive for a killing because it provides 
leads to suspects and strong circumstantial evidence 
against a suspect.
 
Some murders are contracted or hired. Th is is fre-
quently the case in murders of organized crime ﬁ gures.
MASS MURDERERS
A mass murder occurs when multiple victims are killed 
in a single incident by one or a few suspects. Recent years 
have seen several highly publicized cases of mass fami-
licides, particularly parents killing their children—the 
Fresno, California, man who murdered nine of his chil-
dren; the Texas mom who methodically drowned her ﬁ ve 
kids. Without a doubt, the terrorist attacks of Septem-
ber 11, 2001, were the most horriﬁ c mass murder events 
ever witnessed by contemporary Americans in their 
homeland.
 
Felony-related mass murder, such as the killing of eye-
witnesses during a robbery or a group of participants at a 
drug buy, increased during the last part of the 20th century.
 
Th e well-publicized episodes of school shootings and 
attacks at the workplace, in which a lone gunman or pair of 
gunmen opened ﬁ re on students, coworkers or others within 
a building or institution, are other examples. Frequently 
these killers unleash their murderous fury on total strangers. 
School shootings resulting in multiple deaths have occurred 
throughout the United States, as shown in Table 8.6.
 
It is important to realize that school violence almost 
never occurs without warning, with most school shooters 
dropping hints about their intentions.
 
Workplace violence may also result in multiple mur-
ders. As Hess and Wrobleski (2006, p.245) note, “Th e 
perpetrators are frequently loners with poor social skills, 
often obsessed with violence and weapons. Th e targets 
include authority ﬁ gures and peers who are in conﬂ ict 
with them. Th e perpetrators often bring an arsenal of 
weapons and kill all who get in their way.” As with school 
shootings, workplace violence may sometimes be antici-
pated by noting personality changes in the potential 
shooter as well as the occurrence of certain precipitat-
ing events, such as a missed promotion or a termina-
tion. Other triggers include divorce and severe ﬁ nancial 
troubles.

Another type of murder suspect who also kills mul-
tiple victims is the serial killer.
SERIAL KILLERS
Serial murder is the killing of three or more separate 
victims, with a “cooling oﬀ ” period between the kill-
ings. A number of serial killers in the United States have 
Similarities between school and workplace murders 
include the perpetrators’ proﬁ les, the targets, the means 
and the motivation.
 
In many of these cases, the killers take their own lives 
at the end of the shooting rampage, leaving investigators 
to wonder about possible motives.

developed, the investigator should consider reporting the 
crime to the FBI’s National Center for the Analysis of Vio-
lent Crime (NCAVC) at Quantico, Virginia. NCAVC provides 
a proﬁ ling program as well as research and development, 
training and the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program 
(VICAP). Police departments investigating cases they believe 
involve serial murder can submit their cases to VICAP. Other 
cases with similar modus operandi submitted by other agen-
cies are then compared, and information is furnished to the 
submitting agencies. As the Henry Lucas cases illustrate—
where murders were committed in 24 states—VICAP is an 
important resource in investigating and prosecuting this 
type of killer. If VICAP determines that a serial murderer is 
probably involved, a multijurisdictional major crime investi-
gation team may be assembled to handle the case.
 
In some cases, where media coverage leads to an ava-
lanche of citizen tips to authorities, investigators ﬁ nd 
themselves overwhelmed by the ﬂ ood of potentially use-
ful, but more often useless, information.
 
Because of improved information sharing, inter-
jurisdictional communication and media coverage, some 
received national attention: Henry Lucas, who confessed 
to 188 murders in 24 states; Gary Ridgway, the Green 
River strangler, 48 murders over two decades; Th eodore 
(Ted) Bundy, 40 murders; John Wayne Gacey, 33 murders; 
Jeﬀ rey Dahmer, 16 murders; David Berkowitz, the “Son of 
Sam,” 6 murders (he blinded one person, paralyzed another 
and wounded 7 others); and Aileen Wuornos, 7 murders. 
In 1997, Andrew Cunanan went on a cross-country murder 
spree of ﬁ ve men that culminated in the slaying of fashion 
designer Gianni Versace on the front steps of his Miami 
mansion and the suicide of Cunanan a week later. Th e 
Washington, DC, “Beltway snipers,” John Allen Muham-
mad and Lee Boyd Malvo, terrorized the nation, particu-
larly citizens along the Northeast coast, with their 21-day 
random shooting rampage that left 10 people dead and 3 
wounded. And Dennis Rader was sentenced in August 2005 
to 10 consecutive life terms for the 10 killings he confessed 
to as the BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) serial killer.
 
Investigating a murder committed by a serial killer may 
initially seem the same as investigating any other murder. 
As a case is investigated, however, and if no suspect can be 
In this image made from a video released by the Jefferson County (Colorado) Sheriff’s department, Eric Harris, left, and Dylan Klebold 
are shown walking the halls of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, the day of their deadly rampage. The two student gunmen 
killed 13 and wounded 21 before turning their guns on themselves.
Their plans for attacking the school, recovered by investigators after the tragedy had occurred, evolved over a year’s time. Klebold 
and Harris intended to kill as many students and faculty as possible by placing two 20-pound propane bombs inside the cafeteria, set to 
detonate during the peak lunch time, and then shoot any survivors trying to run out of the building.
Witnesses to the shooting spree heard one of the gunmen shout, “This is what we always wanted to do. This is awesome!”
Another witness hiding in the cafeteria reports hearing one of the shooters say, “Today the world’s going to come to an end. 
Today’s the day we die.” (© AP/Wide World Photos)

284 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
LUST MURDERERS
A lust murder is a sex-related homicide involving a sadis-
tic, deviant assault. In lust murder, the killer deperson-
alizes the victim, sexually mutilates the body and may 
displace body parts. Two types of lust murderers are often 
described—organized and disorganized. Th e organized oﬀ -
ender is usually of above-average intelligence, methodical 
and cunning. He is socially skilled and tricks his victims 
into situations in which he can torture and then murder 
them. In contrast, the disorganized oﬀ ender is usually of 
below-average intelligence, has no car and is a loner who 
acts on impulse.
 
Both the organized and the disorganized oﬀ enders usu-
ally murder victims from their own geographic area, and the 
murders involve fantasy, ritual, fetishes and symbolism. 
Th ey also both usually leave some sort of physical evidence.
COLD CASES
Of all violent crimes, homicide has the highest 
clearance rate. Yet, as the statistics given at the 
beginning of this chapter attest, nearly 40 percent of all 
murders go unsolved. At any given time, a large metropoli-
tan jurisdiction may have thousands of cold homicide cases 
on its shelves: “Th e term ‘cold case’ means diﬀ erent things 
in diﬀ erent agencies. Th e deﬁ nition depends on several fac-
tors. In particular, the number of cases and the number of 
employees available to investigate them will dictate a depart-
ment’s cold case deﬁ nition” (Cronin et al., 2007, p.102).
 
Many departments have created cold case squads ded-
icated to handling these challenging cases. Although the 
mantra for fresh homicide investigations is typically “time 
is of the essence”—assuming that, if after 72 hours no sus-
pect has been found, the case is unlikely to be solved—cold 
case squads use the passing of time to their advantage. 
Diﬀ erent squads use diﬀ erent criteria in deciding which 
cases to reinvestigate, but in general, the presence of well-
preserved physical evidence and the ability to identify and 
locate original witnesses raise the priority level of a case.
 
Phillips (2007, p.22) notes, “Typically, cold case inves-
tigations begin with a trip down memory lane and to the 
property storage room. . . retrieving every bit of evidence 
originally collected to allow for proper re-examination.” 
Phillips also notes, “Dynamics in relationships are com-
pletely unscientiﬁ c compared to DNA or AFIS, but knowing 
the dynamics between suspects and victims is important, 
because it could change over the years” (p.24). Over time, 
witnesses who were once uncooperative, either feeling too 
threatened or intimidated to get involved or still in shock 
from what they saw, may no longer be afraid to talk to the 
homicide investigations that begin as single-incident 
investigations may now have the potential to develop into 
serial killing investigations. For example, Donald Blom, 
who confessed to abducting and murdering 19-year-old 
Katie Poirier in Minnesota, is now a possible suspect 
in several other unsolved disappearances and murders 
around the state and in neighboring states. Cary Stayner, 
a handyman convicted of the murder of a national park 
tourist, is suspected of three other killings. Authorities 
speculate that if Stayner’s last victim had not put up such 
a struggle, leaving behind a small but invaluable collec-
tion of physical evidence, Stayner’s ﬁ rst three victims—
and potentially more in the future—may have forever 
remained untraceable and unconnected to him.
 
DNA evidence obtained in any homicide can provide 
valuable leads for investigators, and the importance of 
such evidence is magniﬁ ed greatly in serial killings, even 
if investigators are at ﬁ rst unaware of any links to other 
crimes. Police oﬃ  cers who understand the psychology 
underlying serial killings will be more eﬀ ective in inves-
tigating the murders and in interviewing the murderers. 
Serial killers generally select strangers as their victims, 
although by the time the actual murder occurs, they may 
have become quite familiar with them.
 
Dennis Rader, the BTK serial killer, divulged in court 
how he selected victims as he played out his sexual fan-
tasies. During this self-described “trolling phase,” Rader 
would look for several potential victims, referring to them 
as “projects,” and begin stalking them. Multiple projects 
were selected so if one didn’t work out, he’d have some 
backups. Over time, Rader explained, he’d start really 
honing in on one person to become the victim.
 
Th e acts of serial killers are typically considered in 
discussions of homicides, and, indeed, the very term used 
to describe this group of oﬀ enders focuses on the killing 
part of the crime. However, to the perpetrator, the actual 
homicide is more of an incidental event.
 
Th ey are often quite intelligent and very much in 
touch with reality, which partially explains their success 
in eluding capture. When interviewing serial killers, any 
attempts to evoke sympathy for the victims or surviving 
relatives will probably be futile. Appeals to their ego, on 
the other hand, may succeed. It is also important not to 
display shock at the atrocities that may have been com-
mitted because this is often what serial murderers want.
 
Th e acts of serial murderers seem incomprehensible to 
“normal” people. For example, in 1991, the killing and muti-
lation of 16 young men and boys by Jeﬀ rey Dahmer made 
national headlines. When police entered Dahmer’s stench-
ﬁ lled apartment, they found body parts of 11 males—
painted human skulls, severed heads and body parts in cold 
storage and torsos disintegrating in an acid-ﬁ lled vat. Dah-
mer’s murders can also be classiﬁ ed as lust murders.

CHAPTER 8 | Death Investigations | 285
didn’t believe in dead ends. Together they solved numer-
ous cold cases and, eventually, after various insurance 
issues were worked out, were sworn in as oﬃ  cers, issued 
badges and guns and given carte blanche to conduct full-
blown investigations.
BENEFITS OF A COLD CASE UNIT
Cronin et al. (2007, p.116) conclude, “Th e rewards asso-
ciated with the development of a cold case unit are sig-
niﬁ cant. Case clearance rates increase, guilty parties are 
brought to justice, innocent parties are exonerated, vic-
tims’ survivors get a measure of relief, and investigators 
beneﬁ t from the personal satisfaction associated with 
solving cold cases. . . . Regardless of how a cold case unit 
is organized, the resounding message from those with 
experience is that as long as it is staﬀ ed with passionate, 
patient, and experienced investigators, it will be a success-
ful endeavor.”
 
Cold cases are, without a doubt, one of the most 
challenging tasks a homicide investigator may face. 
Another diﬃ  cult responsibility is that of making a death 
notiﬁ cation.
DEATH NOTIFICATION
Departments may use a police dispatcher, a police 
chaplain or an oﬃ  cer to perform death notiﬁ ca-
tions, but such messages should be delivered by a two-per-
son team. Generally, if the police chaplain or a pastor from 
the deceased’s religious faith accompanies the oﬃ  cer, the 
chaplain or the pastor performs the initial notiﬁ cation and 
the oﬃ  cer ﬁ lls in the details. If the relative is in another 
community or state or is out of the country, ask police of 
that jurisdiction to make the notiﬁ cation, using the tele-
phone to make the actual notiﬁ cation only as a last resort.
 
Oﬃ  cers must be prepared for a wide range of emo-
tional and physical reactions people may have upon hear-
ing of a death. Th ey may collapse or suﬀ er another reaction 
that requires ﬁ rst aid. Th ey may become aggressive or even 
violent and require physical restraint. Having two oﬃ  cers 
perform death notiﬁ cations will aﬀ ord better control of 
such reactions. Furthermore, if two or more survivors are 
to be notiﬁ ed at the same location, it may be advisable to 
do the notiﬁ cations separately, particularly if one or more 
individuals will be asked to provide investigative informa-
tion. Because some homicides are committed by the sur-
vivor receiving the notiﬁ cation, oﬃ  cers should be sure to 
observe and later record how the survivor reacted.
 
Page (2008, p.20) identiﬁ es “best practices” in death 
notiﬁ cations: “Notiﬁ cation should be done in person, in 
police; people who had once had a relationship with the 
suspect but no longer do may decide to come forward with 
incriminating information.
 
In addition to getting information from witnesses, 
investigators may generate leads by having physical evidence 
reexamined. Advances in technology during the past decade, 
particularly DNA analysis techniques, are helping to crack 
once unsolvable cases. If ﬁ ngerprint, DNA or other evidence 
in a cold homicide case had been previously examined but 
not entered into a national database, such as the Integrated 
Automated Fingerprint Identiﬁ cation System (IAFIS), the 
Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) or VICAP, that infor-
mation should certainly be entered now. Besides national 
forensic evidence databases, cold case investigators have 
several other resources they should tap for help, including 
the media, the public and the inmate population.
 
Rutledge (2007a, p.70) cautions, “In many instances, 
the suspect in the cold case turns out to be someone who 
is serving time for another crime. . . . Reinterrogating a 
suspect already serving time is a legal mineﬁ eld.” Accord-
ing to Rutledge, “If arrest reports show that the suspect 
waived Miranda when he was arrested on the prior oﬀ ense 
for which he is now serving time, investigators on the cold 
case can simply give a new Miranda warning and, if the sus-
pect waives, ask him questions about the cold case. Reinter-
rogation is also permissible if the oﬀ ender had previously 
invoked silence, but the investigators give a proper warning 
and receive a waiver. However, if the inmate had previously 
requested counsel, no reinitiation as to any case during 
continuous custody may be made” (Rutledge, pp.70–71).
 
Cold case investigators also need to work closely with 
prosecutors to ensure that their eﬀ orts will meet the 
requirements to get a case to court. Figure 8.5 is a check-
list of the criteria used by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg, 
North Carolina, Police Department in determining which 
cold case homicides to reopen. Appendix E provides the 
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Cold Case 
Solvability Criteria.
VOLUNTEER COLD CASE SQUADS
Moore (2007, p.138) suggests, “Although departments 
can have their own cold case squads populated by active 
duty officers, why not shift those investigators to new 
cases and let the cases that linger in the evidence room 
in boxes covered with dust be handled by willing and 
knowledgeable volunteers?” She points out, “Your com-
munity may be the home of retirees from many differ-
ent agencies. Why not tape into those resources?”
 
Treen (2007, pp.81–84) describes how when he 
retired from being a homicide detective he missed the 
work. So he teamed up with three other retirees, and they 
became known as the “Cold Case Cowboys.” Th ey simply 

286 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
pairs, in private, in plain language, and in time. Avoid 
words such as passed on expired. And make notiﬁ cation 
before the family sees it on the news.”
 
Finally, family members should be allowed to see the 
body, whether it is at the hospital or the morgue. Viewing 
a body at the scene may compromise the investigation.
 
Notifying the family of an oﬃ  cer who has been killed is 
even more diﬃ  cult. Departments should develop a proto-
col for handling these notiﬁ cations, including having oﬃ  -
cers ﬁ ll out a questionnaire covering the following points:
• • Who should be notiﬁ ed after a line-of-duty death? 
Include address and relationship to oﬃ  cer.
• • Are there any special circumstances to be aware of, 
such as a survivor’s heart condition?
• • Is there a clergy preference?
• • Is there a family friend who can provide support?
STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING 
HOMICIDE
Traditionally, police have treated homicide as a 
crime relatively immune from police suppres-
sion eﬀ orts, a crime over which they had little control. Two 
trends are changing this reactive view. Th e ﬁ rst trend is 
crime analysis showing that homicide is greatest for young 
people in core, inner-city neighborhoods and is often related 
to drugs, guns and gangs. Th e second trend is the emergence 
of community policing and a problem-solving approach to 
crime. In this approach, homicide is viewed as part of a larger, 
more general problem—violence. Results of numerous stud-
ies of police departments across the country that have imple-
mented community policing support the theory that greater 
community involvement and a shift in policing philosophy 
to one that emphasizes proactive problem solving can reduce 
overall levels of violence within a community.
The conventional wisdom about homicide has changed 
in some departments from viewing it as a series of 
unconnected, uncontrollable episodes to seeing it as part 
of the larger, general problem of violence, which can be 
addressed proactively.
 
Th is change in perspective allows departments to be 
proactive rather than reactive and to develop strategies to 
reduce homicides in their jurisdictions. One strategy being 
used is CompStat, which uses computer software to per-
form statistical analysis of crime data and target geographic 
areas throughout the city that have high levels of violent 
crime. By focusing law resources and eﬀ orts on those areas,

law enforcement is able to eﬀ ect greater change and have a 
more positive impact. Other departments are implement-
ing early intervention programs to keep small issues from 
growing into bigger, more violent events.
THE 10 MOST COMMON 
ERRORS IN DEATH 
INVESTIGATIONS
Geberth (2007b and 2008) lists the following 10 
most common errors in death investigations:
 1. Improper response to the scene
 2. Failure to protect the crime scene
 3. Not handling suspicious deaths as homicides
 4. Responding with a preconceived notion
 5. Failure to take suﬃ  cient photos
 6. Failure to manage the process (maintaining the chain 
of custody and proper documentation)
 7. Failure to evaluate victimology
 8. Failure to conduct an eﬀ ective canvass
 9. Failure to work as a team
 10. Command interference or inappropriate action
 
Geberth (2007b, p.85) gives an example of an inap-
propriate response to a death:
Uniform oﬃ  cers respond to a call, “Man out the window.” 
When they arrive, they observe a crowd gathered around 
a body in the alleyway of a tenement building. Th e oﬃ  -
cers determine that the man appears dead and call for 
an ambulance and detectives. Th ey fail to establish any 
crime scene except where the body lies and they make no 
attempt to detain anyone or identify any witnesses.
 
Instead, they chase the crowd away and cordon-oﬀ  
the body pending the arrival of the ambulance crew, 
which pronounces the victim dead. During this time 
a drunken man carrying a bottle persists on viewing 
the victim’s body and states that he and the victim are 
roommates. Th e uniform oﬃ  cers threaten to arrest him 
if he doesn’t go away.
 
When the detectives arrive, they ascertain from 
witnesses that the drunken man and the victim were 
in an altercation earlier in the evening in a ﬁ fth-ﬂ oor 
apartment in the tenement. An assault had occurred 
and the drunken man threw his friend out the window, 
and his body ended up in the alleyway. None of these 
locations had been secured and the assailant had been 
chased away by the uniform oﬃ  cers.
A CASE STUDY
Nyberg (2007, pp.38–41) presents the following 
case study: “Th e Moonberry Pond Murder” of 
James Mixon. James Mixon was a drunk who ran afoul of 
everyone he met. Ruth and Jason Brunson also didn’t get 
along with regular society and slept in a tent with their 
4-year-old daughter, Muﬃ  n. Th ey had a deal with the 
state that they could camp on a slender peninsula of land 
that led to an antenna housing as long as they kept people 
from driving out to the little fenced structure. One day 
Mixon showed up, and they ﬁ gured he was harmless so 
they let him stay. Muﬃ  n spent her time with her beloved 
kitten Moonberry. She also named all the critters around 
the campsite, including a young alligator she named “Tater 
the Gator.”
 
One day a man looking for a place to dump some 
junk metal found Mixon’s shirtless body in a small clear-
ing, shot multiple times in the head. Th e Brunsons coop-
erated in turning over their Ruger .356 and providing 
ﬁ ngerprints and handwriting samples. While detectives 
were interviewing Ruth Brunson, she was very coop-
erative, but when a detective asked, “Was there any-
thing that caused you to decide he shouldn’t stay?” she 
started to answer when Muﬃ  n interrupted with, “He was 
mean to Moonberry.” At this, her mother exploded with 
“QUIET!” “You shut up when Mommy is talking,” which 
was markedly diﬀ erent than the way she had treated 
Muﬃ  n before.
 
Th e investigators took the gun, the handwriting sam-
ple and the ﬁ ngerprints and let the Brunsons go. Four 
days later, they got two calls and two hits. Th e bill of sale 
for a vehicle the Brunsons had purchased from Mixon was 
not in James Mixon’s handwriting but, rather, close to 
Jason Brunson’s. And the projectiles taken from Mixon’s 
head matched the Ruger .357. Investigators called the 
Brunsons in and questioned them separately. Under 
pressure, the wife confessed. One detective assumed 
the husband was the killer, but it turned out to be the 
wife, sometimes referred to as “gender prejudice.” What 
had happened is that Mixon had seized Muﬃ  n’s beloved 
Moonberry and thrown the kitten into the pond where 
Tater devoured it.
 
Lessons learned by the Miami-Dade homicide unit:
• • Work as a team—having two interviews going at the 
same time led to success.
• • Avoid gender prejudice—women can kill too.
• • Stay attuned to subtle clues—Ruth’s outburst at 
Muﬃ  n was a telltale clue.

288 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
cadaveric spasm indicates suicide rather than murder. 
Postmortem lividity starts one-half to 3 hours after 
death and is congealed in the capillaries in 4 to 5 hours. 
Maximum lividity occurs within 10 to 12 hours. Th e loca-
tion of lividity can indicate whether a body was moved 
after death. A partial constriction of the pupil occurs in 
about 7 hours. In 12 hours, the cornea appears cloudy. 
Th e investigator should determine when and what the 
victim last ate. If any vomit is present, it should be pre-
served as evidence and submitted for examination. A 
dead body usually sinks in water and remains immersed 
for 8 to 10 days in warm water or 2 to 3 weeks in cold 
water. It then rises to the surface unless restricted. Th e 
outer skin loosens in 5 to 6 days, and the nails separate 
in 2 to 3 weeks.
 
Among the most common causes of unnatu-
ral death are gunshot wounds; stabbing and cutting 
wounds; blows from blunt objects; asphyxia induced 
by choking, drowning, hanging, smothering, strangula-
tion, gases or poisons; poisoning and drug overdoses; 
burning; explosions, electrocution and lightning; drug-
related deaths; and vehicular deaths. In the case of a 
gunshot wound, suicide may be indicated if the wound 
shows gun contact against the skin, the wound is in the 
mouth or temple, the shot did not go through clothing 
or the weapon is present. Murder may be indicated if 
the gun was fired from more than a few inches away or 
from an angle or location that rules out self-infliction, 
if the victim was shot through clothing or if there is no 
weapon present.
 
Stabbing and cutting wounds may be the result of sui-
cide if the body shows hesitation wounds; if the wounds 
appear under clothing or on the throat, wrists or ankles; if 
the weapon is present; or if the body has not been moved. 
Defense wounds, cuts through clothing or to vital organs, 
the absence of a weapon, disﬁ gurement and signs that 
the body has been moved indicate murder. Most cases of 
choking, drowning and smothering are accidental; most 
cases of hanging are suicides; most cases of strangulation 
are murder. Poisoning deaths can be accidental, suicide or 
murder. Most deaths caused by burning, explosions, elec-
trocution and lightning are accidental, although burning 
is sometimes used in an attempt to disguise murder. Th e 
victim’s background can also provide information about 
whether the death was an accident, a suicide or a homi-
cide. Th is background and the evidence on the victim’s 
body often lead to a suspect.
 
Determine a motive for the killing to develop a sus-
pect against whom to provide strong circumstantial evi-
dence. Similarities between school and workplace murders 
include the perpetrators’ proﬁ les, the targets, the means 
and the motivation.
Homicide investigations are challenging and frequently 
require all investigative techniques and skills. A basic 
requirement is to establish whether death was caused by 
a criminal action. Th e four basic types of death are death 
by natural causes, accidental death, suicide and homicide. 
Although technically you are concerned only with homi-
cide, you frequently do not know at the start of an investi-
gation what type of death has occurred; therefore, any of 
the four types of death may require investigation.
 
Homicide—the killing of one person by another—is 
classiﬁ ed as criminal (felonious) or noncriminal. Criminal 
homicide includes murder and manslaughter. Noncrimi-
nal homicide includes excusable homicide—the uninten-
tional, truly accidental killing of another person—and 
justiﬁ able homicide—killing another person under autho-
rization of law. Premeditation is the essential element of 
ﬁ rst-degree murder, distinguishing it from all other mur-
der classiﬁ cations.
 
Special challenges in homicide investigations include 
pressure by the public and the media, diﬃ  culty in estab-
lishing homicide rather than suicide or an accidental or 
natural death, identifying the victim and establishing the 
cause and time of death.
 
Th e ﬁ rst priority in a preliminary homicide investiga-
tion is to give emergency aid to the victim if he or she is 
still alive or to determine that death has occurred—pro-
vided the suspect is not at the scene. Signs of death include 
lack of breathing, lack of heartbeat, lack of ﬂ ushing of the 
ﬁ ngernail bed when pressure is applied and then released 
and failure of the eyelids to close after being  gently lifted. 
After priority matters are completed, the focus of the 
homicide investigation is on identifying the victim, estab-
lishing the time and cause of death and the method used 
to produce it, and developing a suspect.
 
Homicide victims are identiﬁ ed by their relatives, 
friends or acquaintances; by personal eﬀ ects, ﬁ ngerprints, 
DNA analysis and dental and skeletal studies; clothing 
and laundry marks; or through missing-persons ﬁ les.
 
General factors used to estimate time of death are 
body temperature, rigor mortis, postmortem lividity, 
eye appearance, stomach contents, stage of decompo-
sition and evidence suggesting a change in the victim’s 
normal routine. Body temperature drops 2 to 3 degrees 
in the ﬁ rst hour after death and 1 to 1.5 degrees for each 
subsequent hour until 18 hours. Rigor mortis appears 
in the head 5 to 6 hours after death; in the upper body 
after about 12 hours; and in the entire body after about 
18 hours. After about 36 hours, rigor mortis usually dis-
appears in the same sequence as it appeared, and by 72 
hours postmortem, rigor is generally gone. Any weapon

return his picture. Tom stated that after receiving the pic-
ture, he went to his room, went to sleep and awoke about 
8 A.M. When he looked out his window, he saw Mary’s car 
parked out front.
 
Looking into the car, he discovered Mary sitting 
erect behind the steering wheel, shot through the chest, 
a .22 revolver lying beside her on the front seat. She was 
dead—apparently a suicide. Th e revolver had been a gift 
to Mary from her father. Tom called the police to report 
the shooting.
 
Mary had been shot once. Th e bullet entered just 
below the right breast, traveled across the front of her 
body and lodged near her heart. Th e medical examiner 
theorized that she did not die immediately. When found, 
she was sitting upright in the car, her head tilted slightly 
backward, her right hand high on the steering wheel, her 
left hand hanging limp at her left side.
 
When questioned, Tom steadfastly denied any 
knowledge of the shooting. Mary’s clothing, the bullet 
from her body and the gun were sent to the FBI labo-
ratory for examination. An examination of her blouse 
where the bullet entered failed to reveal any powder 
residues. The bullet removed from her body was iden-
tified as having been fired from the gun found beside 
her body.
Questions
 1. Is the shooting likely to be a suicide or a homicide? 
What facts support this?
 2. How should the investigation proceed?
B. Ten-year-old Denise was playing in a school parking 
lot with her 9-year-old stepbrother, Jerry. A car pulled up 
to the curb next to the lot, and the man driving the car 
motioned for Denise and Jerry to come over. When the 
man asked where they lived, Denise described their house. 
Th e man then asked Denise to take him to the house, say-
ing he would bring her right back to the lot afterward. 
Denise got into the car with the man, and they drove away. 
When they did not return after an hour, Jerry went into 
the school and told a teacher what had happened. Denise 
did not return home that evening. Th e next day the police 
received a report that a body had been found near a lover’s 
lane. It was Denise, who had been stabbed to death with 
a pocketknife.
Questions
 1. What steps should be taken immediately?
 2. Where would you expect to ﬁ nd leads?
 3. What evidence would you expect to ﬁ nd?
 4. Speciﬁ cally, how would you investigate this murder?
 
Physical evidence in a homicide includes a weapon, 
a body, blood, hairs and ﬁ bers. A medical examination 
or an autopsy provides legal evidence related to the 
cause and time of death and the presence of alcohol or 
drugs and corroborates information obtained during the 
investigation.
 
Th e conventional wisdom has changed in some 
departments from viewing homicides as a series of uncon-
nected, uncontrollable episodes to viewing homicides as 
part of the larger, general problem of violence, which can 
be addressed proactively.

wo people have a violent argument and hurl insults at each other. A

294 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
Some assaults take place very publicly, often with victims 
and witnesses who are willing to press charges and testify 
in court. Others take place behind closed doors in the pri-
vacy of the home. Domestic violence, once viewed as a 
family matter, has become a priority in many depart-
ments, partly because such violence may end in homi-
cide. Psychological assaults or stalking behaviors have 
become law enforcement concerns since 1990.
ASSAULT: AN OVERVIEW
The court has deﬁ ned assault as “an intentional, 
unlawful act of injury to another by force, or 
force directed toward another person, under circumstances 
that create fear of imminent peril, coupled with an apparent 
ability to execute the attempt, if not prevented. Th e inten-
tion to harm is of the essence. Mere words, although pro-
voking or insulting, are not suﬃ  cient” (Naler v. State, 1933). 
Assault is unlawfully threatening to harm another 
person, actually harming another person or attempting 
unsuccessfully to do so.
 
Assaults range from violent threats to brutal gangland 
beatings, from a shove to a stabbing. Many assaults arise from 
domestic conﬂ icts, often during periods of heavy drinking 
by one or both parties. Some result from long-developing ill 
feelings that suddenly erupt into open violence. Some result 
from an argument such as a barroom dispute that ends in a 
brawl. Assaults often are connected with robberies. 
 
In many states, the term assault formerly referred to 
threats of or attempts to cause bodily harm, whereas battery 
referred to the actual carrying out of such threats. Actual phys-
ical contact is not required for assault. Th e threat or fear of an 
assault along with ability to commit the act is suﬃ  cient.
 
In most revised state statutes, the term assault is syn-
onymous with battery, or the two terms have been joined 
in a single crime termed assault. Some states, however, 
still have separate statutory oﬀ enses of assault and bat-
tery. Where one statute remains, battery includes the 
lesser crime of assault.
CLASSIFICATION
Assaults are classiﬁ ed as either simple or aggra-
vated (felonious).
Simple assault is intentionally causing another 
person to fear immediate bodily harm or death or 
intentionally inﬂ icting or attempting to inﬂ ict bodily 
harm on the person. Aggravated, or felonious assault 
is an unlawful attack by one person on another to 
inﬂ ict severe bodily injury.
 
Simple assault is usually a misdemeanor. It does 
not involve a deadly weapon, and the injuries sustained, 
if any, are neither severe nor permanent. Aggravated 
assault, on the other hand, is a felony. Nationally, it 
is the most frequent of the violent crimes. Aggravated 
or felonious assault is sometimes further classiﬁ ed as 
assault with a deadly weapon or assault with intent to 
commit murder. National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCVS) data indicates a victimization rate of 20.7 per 
1,000 persons age 12 or older in 2006 (Rand and Cata-
lano, 2007). Th e rate was 15.2 for simple assault and 5.5 
for aggravated assault. FBI data shows 860,853 aggra-
vated assaults in 2006 (Crime in the United States, 2006). 
Th e rate was estimated at 287.5 oﬀ enses per 100,000 
inhabitants. Th e Oﬃ  ce for Victims of Crime reports that 
one person is assaulted every 7.2 seconds (“Crime Clock,” 
2008). Th e clearance rate for aggravated assault was 54.0 
percent in 2007.
OFFICERS ASSAULTED
Th e FBI reports that in 2006 58,634 oﬃ  cers were assaulted 
while performing their duties, at a rate of 11.8 per 100 oﬃ  -
cers (Law Enforcement Oﬃ  cers Killed and Assaulted, 2007). 
Th e largest percentage (30.9) were assaulted responding 
to disturbance calls (family quarrels, bar ﬁ ghts, etc.); 12.2 
percent were handling, transporting or maintaining cus-
tody of prisoners; and 11.1 percent were performing traf-
ﬁ c stops.
LEGAL FORCE
Physical force may be used legally in certain instances.

CHAPTER 9 | Assault, Domestic Violence, Stalking and Elder Abuse | 295
In speciﬁ ed instances, teachers, people operating public 
conveyances and law enforcement ofﬁ cers can legally 
use reasonable physical force.
 
Teachers have the authority of in loco parentis (“in 
the place of the parent”) in many states and are allowed to 
use minimum force to maintain discipline, stop ﬁ ghts on 
school property or prevent destruction of school property. 
Bus drivers, train conductors, airplane pilots and ship cap-
tains have authority to use force to stop misconduct by 
passengers. Law enforcement oﬃ  cers may use as much 
force as needed to overcome resistance to a lawful arrest. 
Force used in self-defense is also justiﬁ able.
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME
The elements of the crime of assault are not as 
straightforward as with most other crimes 
and vary signiﬁ cantly from state to state.
SIMPLE ASSAULT
Most state statutes have common elements for simple 
assault.
The elements of the crime of simple assault are
• • Intent to do bodily harm to another.
• • Present ability to commit the act.
• • Commission of an overt act toward carrying out the 
intention.
Intent to Do Bodily Harm to Another Evidence of 
speciﬁ c intent to commit bodily injury must be present. 
Injury that is caused accidentally is not assault. A suspect’s 
words and actions or any injuries inﬂ icted on a victim 
imply this intent. Th e injury must be to another person; 
injury to property or self-inﬂ icted injury—no matter how 
serious—is not assault.
 
Th e bodily harm or injury in simple assault need not 
cause severe physical pain or disability. Th e degree of 
force necessary in simple assault ranges from a shove or a 
slap to slightly less than that required for the great bodily 
harm that distinguishes aggravated assault.
Present Ability to Commit the Act Th e suspect must 
have been physically able to commit the act at the time. A 
suspect who hurled a knife at a victim who was obviously out 
of range would not have had the ability to hit the target.
Commission of an Overt Act An overt act, more than a 
threat or gesture, must have been completed. If the suspect 
was in range to strike the victim, even if someone inter-
vened, an assault can be proven. Intentionally pushing, 
shoving or physically preventing someone from entering or 
leaving property is often determined to be simple assault.
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT
Aggravated assault includes the three elements of simple 
assault plus an element relating to the severity of the attack. 
Aggravated assault is usually committed with a weapon or by 
some means likely to produce great bodily harm or death.
An additional element of aggravated assault is that the 
intentionally inﬂ icted bodily injury must have resulted in 
one of the following:
• • A high probability of death
• • Serious, permanent disﬁ gurement
• • Permanent or protracted loss or impairment of 
the function of any body member or organ or other 
severe bodily harm
 
As with simple assault, the act must be intentional—
not accidental.
High Probability of Death An assault is considered aggra-
vated if it is committed by any means so severe that a reason-
able person feels it would result in a high probability of death. 
Examples include a blow suﬃ  cient to cause unconsciousness 
or coma, a gunshot or knife wound that causes heavy bleed-
ing or burns inﬂ icted over most of a person’s body.
Serious, Permanent Disfigurement Permanent disﬁ g-
urement includes such things as losing an ear, eye or part of 
the nose, or permanent scarring of the face or other parts of 
the body that are normally visible. It cannot be a temporary 
injury that will eventually heal and not be evident.
Loss or Impairment of Body Members or Organs 
Regardless of the body part aﬀ ected, a charge of aggravated 
assault is supported by the loss or permanent impairment 
of body members or organs, or maiming. “Maiming signi-
ﬁ es to cripple or mutilate in any way which deprives the use 
of any limb or member of the body, to seriously wound or 
disﬁ gure or disable” (Shackleford v. Commonwealth, 1945). 
 
Only one of these additional elements is needed to 
show aggravated assault, although two or all three are 
sometimes present. Some states do not require perma-
nent or protracted injury or loss if the weapon used in the 
assault is a dangerous weapon that causes fear of immedi-
ate harm or death.

296 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
 
It is sometimes diﬃ  cult, especially in cases of wife and 
child beating, to obtain a complaint from the victim. If it is 
simple assault, which is a misdemeanor, you must see the 
oﬀ ense committed or obtain a complaint and arrest war-
rant or have the victim make a citizen’s arrest. Some states, 
such as Pennsylvania, have given the same right of arrest 
for domestic assaults that exists for felony arrest—police 
can arrest without victim complaint and without actually 
witnessing the assault, as discussed later in the chapter.
 
Patrol oﬃ  cers usually make the ﬁ rst contact with the 
complainant or assault victim. Police on regular patrol 
sometimes observe an assault occurring. Usually, how-
ever, they are sent to the assault scene by the dispatcher. 
Assault calls are potentially dangerous for the police. 
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 
more police oﬃ  cers are killed while investigating distur-
bance calls, such as family quarrels or bar ﬁ ghts, than in 
responding to robbery and burglary calls (Law Enforce-
ment Oﬃ  cers, 2006). Oﬃ  cers may arrive at the point of 
most heated emotions and in the middle of a situation 
that stems from a deep-rooted problem entirely unknown 
to them. Th eir ﬁ rst act is to stop any assaultive action by 
disarming, separating or arresting the people involved. 
Th is reduces the possibility of further conﬂ ict.
 
Oﬃ  cers should be on their guard and not take sides in 
any dispute. If people are injured, ﬁ rst aid must be admin-
istered or emergency personnel summoned to the scene. 
Th e ﬁ rst oﬃ  cer on the scene should determine whether 
more help is needed and whether a description of the sus-
pect must be broadcast.
 
In most assault cases, arriving police oﬃ  cers ﬁ nd that 
the assault has been completed. However, verbal abuse 
and considerable confusion may still exist. Interview 
the victim as soon as possible to obtain details about the 
injury, the degree of pain, medical assistance rendered 
and other facts related to the severity of the attack. Th e 
extent and nature of the injury determines the degree of 
assault to be charged. Further facts supporting the sever-
ity of the attack are obtained by noting what treatment 
the victim requires and by talking to medical personnel.
 
Th e victim frequently knows who committed the 
assault, either by name or by an association that can be 
checked. Determine the reason for the assault. Find out 
what actions the victim and assailant took before, dur-
ing and after the assault. If the victim of an aggravated 
assault is severely injured and indicates by words, ges-
tures or appearance that death may be imminent, obtain 
a dying declaration.
 
If the suspect is at the scene, an arrest should be 
made if the situation warrants, or the victim may make 
a citizen’s arrest. If the suspect is known but is not at the 
scene, the suspect’s description should be broadcast and 
the investigation begun.
ATTEMPTED ASSAULT
Attempted aggravated assault is also a crime in many 
states. If the suspect intended to assault someone but 
was prevented from doing so for some reason, it is still 
a punishable oﬀ ense categorized as “unlawful attempt to 
commit assault.”
Attempted assault requires proof of intent along with 
some overt act toward committing the crime.
 
Intent or preparation is not enough to prove attempted 
assault. For example, a suspect must have done more than 
obtain a weapon or make a plan or even arrange to go to 
the scene. Rather, the suspect must actually have gone 
there and have had the weapon in possession when the 
eﬀ ort was aborted.
 
A person who intends to rob a grocery store and whose 
gun accidentally discharges while the person is in the store 
has indeed committed an overt act. However, if the gun 
discharges while the person is driving to the store, there 
is no overt act to support an attempted assault charge. 
Likewise, if a potential rapist approaches a woman and 
has raised his arm to strike her when he is apprehended, 
an overt act toward an assault has been committed. But if 
the man is apprehended while still lurking behind a bush, 
reasonable doubt exists.
SPECIAL CHALLENGES IN 
INVESTIGATION
Sometimes it is diﬃ  cult to know who started a 
ﬁ ght. Both parties may claim the other person 
struck the ﬁ rst blow. In such cases, both may be charged 
with disturbing the peace until oﬃ  cers can obtain more 
information.
Special challenges in assault investigations include 
distinguishing the victim from the suspect, determining 
whether the matter is civil or criminal and determining 
whether the act was intentional or accidental. Obtaining 
a complaint against a simple assault also is sometimes 
difﬁ cult. Moreover, such calls may be dangerous for 
responding ofﬁ cers.
 
It is also necessary to determine whether the alterca-
tion is a civil or a criminal matter. A person who acciden-
tally injures someone is not guilty of a criminal oﬀ ense 
but may be sued in civil court by the victim.

CHAPTER 9 | Assault, Domestic Violence, Stalking and Elder Abuse | 297
• • Obtain preliminary statements.
• • Photograph evidence.
• • Collect and preserve evidence.
• • Reconstruct the crime.
PROVING THE ELEMENTS OF ASSAULT
An assault that involves no dangerous weapon and results 
in no serious injury is a relatively minor crime. In contrast, 
aggravated assault is an extremely serious crime.
To prove the elements of assault, establish the intent 
to cause injury, the severity of the injury inﬂ icted and 
whether a dangerous weapon was used.
 
Establish intent by determining the events that led 
up to the assault. Record the suspect’s exact words and 
actions, and take statements from the victim and any 
witnesses.
 
Establish the severity of the assault by taking photo-
graphs and describing all injuries in your notes. Describe 
the size, location, number, color, depth and amount of 
bleeding of any injuries. Some bruises do not become vis-
ible for several hours or even a day or two. Assault vic-
tims should be advised of this and told that additional 
photographs should be taken. Obtain an oral or written 
statement from a qualiﬁ ed medical person regarding the 
severity and permanence of the injuries and any impair-
ment of bodily functioning.
 
Determine the means of attack and the exact weapon 
used. Was it hands, ﬁ sts, feet, a gun or a knife?
EVIDENCE IN ASSAULT INVESTIGATIONS
Corroborate the victim’s information with physical 
evidence.
Physical evidence in an assault case includes pho-
tographs of injuries, clothing of the victim or suspect, 
weapons, broken objects, bloodstains, hairs, ﬁ bers and 
other signs of an altercation.
 
Two important pieces of evidence are photographs of 
injuries and the weapon used in the assault. If the hands, 
ﬁ sts or feet were used, examine them for cuts and bruises 
and photograph any injuries. Obtain ﬁ ngernail scrapings 
from both the victim and the suspect.
 
Take as evidence any weapons found at the scene. Th e 
victim’s clothing may contain evidence such as bullet holes 
or tears made by a knife or other cutting instrument.
THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
At a minimum, an oﬃ  cer arriving on the scene of 
an assault should
• • Control and disarm those involved in the altercation.
• • Provide medical aid to injured people.
• • Separate suspects.
• • Protect the crime scene.
• • Give the Miranda warning if applicable.
Some domestic assaults are severe enough to require 
hospitalization of the victim. Despite injuries, the assault victim 
is normally conscious and can provide critical information about 
the assailant and details about the severity of the attack. Battered 
spouses, however, are commonly reluctant to give investigators 
such details, either out of loyalty to their abuser or fear of reprisal.

298 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
 
If you suspect that alcohol or drug use may have 
contributed to the assault, arrange for the appropri-
ate urine, blood and saliva tests. Photograph and make 
notes regarding evidence that indicates the intensity of 
the assault—for example, overturned furniture, broken 
objects, torn-up sod and bent shrubs.
 
Reﬂ ective ultraviolet photography can allow investi-
gators to document injuries on ﬂ esh as long as 9 months 
after they have visibly healed. Reﬂ ective ultraviolet pho-
tography can reveal pattern injuries—that is, injuries that 
have a recognizable shape—including cigarette burns, 
whip or belt marks, bruising, contusions, abrasions, 
injury margins from immersion burns, bite marks and 
scratches.
To aid in data collection, special categories of assault 
are domestic violence, stalking and elder abuse.
INVESTIGATING DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE
Oﬃ  cers may not understand that although it 
appears that the victim can change the cir-
cumstances, victims often do not believe they have this 
capability.
Domestic violence is a pattern of behaviors involving 
physical, sexual, economic and emotional abuse, alone 
or in combination, often by an intimate partner and often 
to establish and maintain power and control over the 
other partner.
HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: FROM MALE 
PRIVILEGE TO CRIMINAL ACT
Domestic violence has deep roots in the patriarchal sys-
tems the colonists brought with them when they settled 
in the New World. At the time, however, such violence 
was perceived not as a crime but as a man’s duty, for 
he, as head of the family and the authority ﬁ gure in the 
home, was expected to keep control over his wife and 
children and was allowed to use any means necessary 
to achieve order. In the case of State v. Rhodes (1868), 
the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that although a 
husband had the right to whip his wife, if the switch was 
thicker than the thumb, it was considered abuse. Th is 
Rule of Th umb standard, adopted by most state courts 
across the nation during the colonial period, was derived 
from English common law and permitted men to use any 
instrument to physically enforce family obedience as 
long as the object was no larger than the thickness of the 
man’s thumb.
 
Th e use of force was an acceptable male privilege and 
was considered a family matter to be handled privately. 
But times have changed: “Police interventions in domestic 
violence cases have altered radically over the past 30 years 
from treating wife assault as a matter most appropri-
ately addressed privately within the family to regarding 
it is a crime appropriate for criminal justice intervention” 
 (Russell and Light, 2006, p.375). Despite the criminaliza-
tion of such assaults, domestic violence remains a per-
sistent problem for thousands of households across the 
country, partly because the abusive behavior is part of the 
family dynamic, tightly woven into the fabric of family 
relationships and passed from generation to generation 
through a cycle of violence.
THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE
Domestic violence is commonly thought of as occurring 
in a three-phase cycle: (1) the tension-building stage, (2) 
the acute battering episode and (3) the honeymoon. Th is 
cycle, which typically increases in both frequency and 
severity, is illustrated in Figure 9.1.
 
Th is pattern of abuse often becomes a vicious inter-
generational cycle because research has found that chil-
dren who witness abuse or are abused themselves are more 
likely to abuse a spouse or child when they become adults. 
Crimes against children are the focus of Chapter 11.
TYPES OF ASSAULT
Th e National Institute of Justice (NIJ) describes four 
main types of intimate partner violence (“Intimate Part-
ner Violence,” 2007):
Physical violence is the intentional use of physical force 
(e.g., shoving, choking, shaking, slapping, punching, 
burning, or use of a weapon, restraints, or one’s size 
and strength against another person) with the potential 
for causing death, disability, injury, or physical harm.
 
Sexual violence can be divided into three catego-
ries: (1) the use of physical force to compel a person 
to engage in a sexual act unwillingly, whether or not 
the act is completed; (2) an attempted or completed 
sexual act involving a person who, because of illness, 
disability, or the inﬂ uence of alcohol or other drugs, or 
because of intimidation or pressure is unable to under-
stand the nature or condition of the act, decline partici-
pation, or communicate unwillingness to engage in the 

CHAPTER 9 | Assault, Domestic Violence, Stalking and Elder Abuse | 299
 
Th e Oﬃ  ce for Victims of Crime (OVC) “Crime Clock” 
shows that one woman is victimized by an intimate part-
ner every 1.3 minutes; one man is victimized every 6.7 
minutes; and one child is reported abused or neglected 
every 35 seconds. Data from the National Crime Victim-
ization Survey report that 595,740 women were aﬀ ected 
by intimate partner violence during 2006 (Rand and Cat-
alano, 2007). Th ese ﬁ gures, however, are an undercount 
because much of the domestic violence that occurs goes 
unreported. Domestic abuse in families from diverse 
ethnic or cultural backgrounds also commonly goes 
unreported. For example, female abuse victims of Asian 
descent are reluctant to notify the police because they do 
not want to bring shame on their family or community.
 
Fear is another reason such crimes go unreported. 
Many women do not report domestic assaults because 
of threats such as “I’ll take the kids and you’ll never see 
them again” or “I’ll kill you if you call the police.” In many 
instances, the wife fails to report the abuse (and to leave 
the relationship) because she has no work skills and no 
independent income, because of the stigma and embar-
rassment associated with the oﬀ ense or because she has 
one or more children to support. Some victims choose 
to stay with their batterers for fear that leaving would 
further enrage their partners. Statistics document that 
many batterers eventually kill their intimate. In recent 
years, one third of female murder victims were killed by 
their intimate partners (Jethwani and Nickel, 2006, p.1).  
In some instances, the male batterer becomes the victim 
of homicide. In such cases, the defense often attributes 
act; and (3) abusive sexual contact. [Sexual violence is 
the focus of Chapter 10.]
 
Th reats of physical or sexual violence communicate 
the intent to cause death, disability, injury, or physical 
harm through the use of words, gestures, or weapons.
 
Psychological/emotional violence traumatizes the 
victim by acts, threats of acts, or coercive tactics (e.g., 
humiliating the victim, controlling what the victim 
can and cannot do, withholding information, isolating 
the victim from friends and family, denying access to 
money or other basic resources). In most cases, emo-
tional violence has been preceded by acts of threats of 
physical or sexual violence.
 
Table 9.1 shows the type of actual or threatened 
 physical assault and gender of domestic violence victims.
PREVALENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
AND ITS VICTIMS
Domestic violence includes intimate partner violence as 
well as violence between family members. Intimate rela-
tionships involve current or former spouses, boyfriends 
or girlfriends, including same-sex relationships. Intimates 
are distinguished from other relatives (parent, child, sib-
ling, grandparent, in-law, cousin), acquaintances (friend,  
coworker, neighbor, schoolmate, someone known) and 
strangers (anyone not previously known by the victim). 
Domestic violence is found at all income levels and in all 
races, but it occurs more often in households facing eco-
nomic distress (Catalano, 2006). 
Tension-Building Stage:
The victim suffers minor battering
incidents, verbal abuse and
psychological humiliation.
Acute Battering Episode:
This is the explosive, violent
incident, which may be physical or
sexual.
The Honeymoon:
During this phase—the most
challenging and frustrating for law
enforcement—the batterer tries to win
the victim's forgiveness with
apologies, affection, promises, gifts,
etc. This often works, and the cycle
continues.

probation violation); to dismiss for insuﬃ  cient evidence 
(versus full prosecution); and to reduce felony charges to a 
misdemeanor or violation of parole. Th e study found sus-
pect gender to be statistically signiﬁ cant in all four out-
comes, in favoring female over male suspects, suggesting 
that female intimate violence perpetrators are frequently 
viewed more as victims than as oﬀ enders (Kingsnorth and 
MacIntosh, 2007, p.461).
Gay and Lesbian Domestic Violence Traditionally 
the issue of gay and lesbian domestic violence was ignored 
and its extent undocumented. Th at law enforcement once 
considered abuse within a heterosexual couple’s relation-
ship a private, personal matter makes understandable the 
lack of police concern regarding violence between homo-
sexual partners. 
 
However, “Th e dynamics of same-sex domestic vio-
lence are similar to those of opposite-sex domestic vio-
lence in many respects” (Pattavina, Hirschel, Buzawa, 
Faggiani and Bentley, 2007, p.5). Th e cause is cyclical, 
escalates over time and maintains a commonality in char-
acteristics of batterers. Th e rates of physical violence vary 
from 8 percent to 60 percent for lesbians and from 22 per-
cent to 44 percent for gay men (Pattavina et al.). When the 
law enforcement response to domestic violence incidents 
involving heterosexual and same-sex couples is compared, 
the murder to the “battered-woman syndrome,” which is 
based on the concept of duress and results from a cycle of 
violence.
Women as Abusers Although most abuse victims are 
women, women also perpetrate such violence. Although 
it is common for battered women to feel shame at being 
victims of domestic abuse, the stigma for battered men 
is even greater. Many reports of husband abuse go unre-
ported because these men anticipate an unsympathetic 
or incredulous reaction from responding oﬃ  cers. Indeed, 
the misperception persists that women who commit vio-
lence against men have been driven to it through years 
of victimization at the hands of these men (the battered-
woman syndrome), and thus, the men “have it coming.” 
However, oﬃ  cers responding to a domestic violence call 
must not assume the male is always the perpetrator and 
the female always the victim.
 
A study that examined whether women who assaulted 
their male partners were more likely to avoid arrest found 
that this was, indeed, the case (Felson and Pare, 2007, 
p.436). Another study examined the diﬀ erences in how 
male and female batterers were treated by the criminal 
justice system and assessed four decision points: the 
decision to ﬁ le charges (versus rejection for insuﬃ  cient 
evidence); to ﬁ le as a felony (versus a misdemeanor or

violence because an oﬃ  cer who is unable to carry a gun is 
unlikely to ﬁ nd or retain a job. 
PREDICTORS AND PRECIPITATORS OF 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
Research has attempted to identify factors that predict 
or precipitate episodes of domestic violence, both for 
victimization and perpetration. As mentioned, one well-
documented predictor of the likelihood of family abuse is 
a history of family violence (Figure 9.2). Other risk fac-
tors include gun ownership by the abuser, unemployment 
of the batterer and estrangement, where the victim has 
moved out of the previously shared residence.
 
Analysis of domestic assault reports in the Charlotte-
 Mecklenburg, North Carolina, Police Department Baker 
One District (“Domestic Violence Intervention,” p.4) 
revealed that, on average, domestic assault victims had 
ﬁ led nine previous police reports, most involving the same 
suspect named in the domestic assault case.  However, most 
of these prior reports concerned not domestic assault but 
other crimes, which were referred to as  indicator crimes. 
Indicator crimes are oﬀ enses that, in situations involving 
the same victim and suspect, can establish a pattern of 
events indicative of an abusive relationship. Th ese crimes 
can range from harassing phone calls to hit-and-run.
 
Animal cruelty is another predictor of abusive or vio-
lent behavior. Results of numerous studies have demon-
strated a link between animal abuse and domestic violence, 
with some research going beyond the surface correlation 
to explore deeper aspects of the abusive psyche. In a study 
of several of the largest domestic violence shelters in the 
country, the Humane Society of the United States found 
that 91 percent of adult victims and 73 percent of chil-
dren, upon entering the shelter, mention incidents of 
companion animal abuse. But only about 18 percent of 
the shelters routinely ask victims about their pets (Animal 
Cruelty Is Family Violence, 2008).
 
Blum (2006) cites the statement from the volunteer 
coordinator for a survivor’s center: “Animal abuse is a 
serious crime in its own right. However, the ties between 
animal abuse and human violence are unmistakable. Th e 
evidence is compelling. Animal cruelty is just one aspect 
of an environment marked by violence.” Blum presents 
the following statistics:
• • 75 percent of women entering shelters are pet  owners. 
Of those women, 71 percent said their abuser had 
either injured or killed their family pet.
• • In 88 percent of homes with prosecutable animal cru-
elty, children were also being physically abused.
• • In more than two-thirds of cases involving elder 
abuse, the perpetrator may neglect or abuse the elder’s 
the oﬀ enders receive similar treatment. However, same-
sex victims rarely are aﬀ orded the same protection as het-
erosexuals are (Pattavina et al.). 
When the Abuser Is a Police Officer Knowing the 
seriousness of the crime and the damage it causes to 
victims and families does not make oﬃ  cers immune 
from committing domestic violence themselves. In fact, 
research suggests that domestic abuse may occur more 
often in police families than among the general public.
 
Lonsway (2006, pp.398–399) reports on four studies 
using rigorous social scientiﬁ c methodology to estimate 
the number of police families who experience domestic 
violence. In the ﬁ rst study, oﬃ  cers were asked whether 
they had gotten out of control and acted violently toward 
their spouse or children in the last 6 months. Forty per-
cent of the oﬃ  cers said they had. In the second study, 
both oﬃ  cers and wives said that 37 to 41 percent of the 
relationships involved some level of physical violence, a 
considerably higher ﬁ gure than comparable studies per-
formed with military families (32 percent) and four times 
higher than the 10 percent ﬁ gure for the general public. 
In the ﬁ nal two studies, almost one quarter (24 percent) 
of the oﬃ  cers reported having used some form of violence 
against their spouses, roughly the same as the 28 percent 
provided by the wives.
 
When the abuser is a police oﬃ  cer, special challenges 
exist. Few professions are characterized by the ﬁ erce loy-
alty to one’s coworkers that prevails in law enforcement. 
Th is allegiance is put to the test when responding to a 
domestic violence call at an oﬃ  cer’s home. In the past, 
responding oﬃ  cers would simply separate the parties 
and persuade the battered spouse to give the abuser time 
to cool oﬀ , explaining away the violence as the result of 
a stressful job and convincing the spouse that an arrest 
would only jeopardize the security of the entire fam-
ily. Typically, no oﬃ  cial report would be ﬁ led about the 
incident, and the abuse would be allowed to go on. Some-
times the abuse continues to escalate until the oﬃ  cer kills 
his spouse and then, commonly, himself. In many, if not 
most, of these cases, the oﬃ  cer’s service weapon is used in 
the crime. 
 
Spurred by research that showed how domestic abuse 
can evolve to domestic homicide, particularly when a ﬁ re-
arm is available to the abuser, a federal law was passed in 
1996 prohibiting anyone, including a police oﬃ  cer, who 
has been convicted of a qualifying misdemeanor domestic 
violence oﬀ ense from owning or using a ﬁ rearm or pos-
sessing ammunition. Th is law, known as the Lautenberg 
Act (18. U.S.C. § 925), amended the Gun Control Act 
of 1968, which barred only those convicted of a felony 
oﬀ ense from owning or using a ﬁ rearm. Th is law also puts 
another wrinkle in the issue of police-involved domestic 

302 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
her frame of mind and that of the potential attacker. From 
that point on, responding oﬃ  cers’ actions are critical.
 
Th e availability of computers in patrol vehicles and 
use of real-time response software enable a premises and 
individual records check as part of the preliminary inves-
tigation. Th is may include previous calls for service from 
the complainant’s residence, complaints of illegal activi-
ties at this address, open warrants for involved parties and 
background information on the victim or alleged assail-
ant. Th is information enhances the safety of the oﬃ  cers 
and helps them better assess the situation upon arrival at 
the scene.
 
Grossi (2007, p.28) asserts, “Most oﬃ  cers know the 
stats: Domestic disputes are the most dangerous calls 
they respond to. And they’re right. Th e latest statistics 
from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports again show the 
single largest category for oﬃ  cer assaults is response to 
domestic calls (30.5 percent). And most oﬃ  cers know 
pet as a form of control or retaliation, out of frustra-
tion over their caretaking responsibilities, or as a way 
to extract ﬁ nancial assets from the victim.
 
Blum also notes, “Many serial killers and even stu-
dents involved in recent school shootings have  histories 
of abusing animals ﬁ rst before moving on to human 
targets.”  
 
Although not a predictor or precipitator of domestic 
violence, the presence of ﬁ rearms can drastically change 
the complexion of domestic violence and make responding 
to such calls exponentially more dangerous for oﬃ  cers.

a protective or restraining order against the attacker, and 
some require an arrest even though no such order exists.
 
Many departments have a mandatory arrest policy for 
domestic abuse, requiring the oﬃ  cer to make an arrest if 
there is probable cause, even without a signed complaint 
by the victim. In Nevada, for example, if the police have 
suﬃ  cient reason to believe that a person, within the pre-
ceding 4 hours, committed an act of domestic violence 
or spousal battery, the oﬃ  cer is required to arrest that 
person if there are no mitigating circumstances. Some 
states have legislated that police must have and imple-
ment such a policy. Th is philosophy was largely the result 
of the “Minneapolis Experiment” conducted by Sherman 
and Berk in the early 1980s, which concluded that arrest 
was a more eﬀ ective deterrent to repeat oﬀ enses than was 
advising or sending the suspect away. Th is report, some-
times summarized as “arrest works best,” helped create a 
nationwide pro-arrest sentiment in domestic violence sit-
uations. However, “It may be premature to conclude that 
arrest is always the best way for police to handle domestic 
violence, or that all suspects in such situations should be 
arrested. A number of factors suggest a cautious interpre-
tation of the ﬁ nding” (Sherman and Berk, 1984, pp.6–7).
 
Indeed, since that time, numerous other studies have 
found that alternatives to arrest may be better in spe-
ciﬁ c circumstances. Sherman (1995, p.207) himself has 
asserted that arrest can backﬁ re, and mandatory arrest 
laws can actually compound the domestic violence prob-
lem rather than alleviate it. A more recent study by Dugan 
(2003, p.303) found that although households in states 
with mandatory arrest laws are less likely to experience 
spousal violence, police in these same states are also less 
likely to discover such abuse: “Th is suggests that manda-
tory arrest laws not only reduce the chances of violence, 
but also keep people from calling the police.” According to 
Dugan, although domestic violence victims are no more 
likely to report an incident in states with mandatory arrest 
laws, third parties are signiﬁ cantly less likely to make a 
report, thus bringing fewer cases to the attention of law 
enforcement.
 
Oﬃ  cers should not base their decisions regarding 
arrest on their perception of the willingness of the victim 
or witnesses to testify. Furthermore, the victim need not 
sign a complaint. 
 
Departments vary in their policies regarding mutual 
abuse. Some departments require the responding oﬃ  cer 
to determine who the primary physical aggressor was and 
then arrest that person, whereas other agencies have a 
dual arrest policy. Dual arrest policies, which gained use 
following passage of pro-arrest laws, allow oﬃ  cers to cir-
cumvent the primary aggressor assessment and arrest 
both parties when injuries to both sides are observed. 
Critics of dual arrest policies have argued that they result 
why.” Grossi explains what often happens when oﬃ  cers 
respond to domestic violence calls:
Th e traditional domestic dynamic reveals that in any 
call involving family troubles, there are usually two 
principal players involved: the victim (usually the 
abused spouse) and the suspect (the abuser). As soon 
as you, the oﬃ  cer, arrive on the scene, the dynamic 
changes. A third element is now injected into the sce-
nario: the rescuer. Of course, what most cops hope for 
is that you and your partner can get the principals sepa-
rated, get things calmed down, arrest the abuser and in 
essence rescue the victim.
 
However, what often happens is a change in 
dynamics and labels shift. Th e abuser now is seen as the 
victim, you are now viewed as the abuser and the only 
vacancy left—the rescuer slot—is ﬁ lled by the abused 
spouse, who turns on you to “rescue” their abuser-
spouse. Th e stage is set for a double-team assault.
 
To avoid such a situation, Grossi (p.28) recommends 
always responding with a backup or two. Further recom-
mendations include separating people for the interviews, 
impounding all ﬁ rearms at the scene if the laws and poli-
cies in your area permit and never dropping your guard 
just because you’re dealing with a homosexual or lesbian 
couple (p.29).
 
Police oﬃ  cers must listen to the facts and determine 
who the oﬀ ender is if the assault is not continuing when 
they arrive. Reduce the level of tension at the scene by 
separating and talking to the participants and being vigi-
lant about the safety of the participants and any children 
present.
 
Gather evidence of the oﬀ ense. In any assault, one of 
the most important kinds of evidence is photographs of any 
injuries. Be aware that some bruises do not become visible 
until well after the battering episode. Obtain all evidence, 
including photographs of injuries, victim’s statements, 
prior police reports, doctor or hospital reports, weapons 
used, damaged clothing or other property and statements 
from neighbors or other witnesses. Explain to the victim 
that an order of protection may be obtained from a court to 
help prevent future assaults, as discussed shortly.
 
Th e importance of the incident report should not be 
overlooked. Th e better the report, the better the chance of 
obtaining a conviction. Describe completely any injuries 
and the victim’s physical condition. Some departments 
have a supplemental report form to document evidence in 
domestic violence cases.
To Arrest or Not? Basically, any evidence that would 
lead an oﬃ  cer to make an arrest in any other situation also 
applies to spousal situations. All states permit an arrest 
based on probable cause. Many states now mandate police 
to make an arrest in domestic violence incidents if there is 

304 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
to domestic violence, which appears to be highly success-
ful. Although many departments view arrests as a critical 
part of a zero-tolerance stance, some researchers contend 
that it is not the arrest itself but what happens after the 
arrest that ultimately determines the eﬀ ectiveness of the 
response.
 
In some jurisdictions, arrested batterers are processed 
through the justice system just as many other types of crim-
inal oﬀ enders—jail, prosecution and, one hopes, convic-
tion. In other jurisdictions, arrested abusers are required 
to participate in a batterer intervention program (BIP), 
a counseling and treatment alternative to sending these 
oﬀ enders to jail. Th e most common BIP used throughout 
the country is based on the Duluth Model, founded on 
the feminist theory that domestic violence is the result of 
a patriarchal ideology in which men are encouraged and 
expected to control their partners. Th e Duluth Model BIP 
seeks to enlighten abusive men by exploring their atti-
tudes about control and teaching them strategies to bet-
ter interact with their partners. Other BIPs are based on 
cognitive-behavioral modiﬁ cation to correct faulty think-
ing patterns, group practice models that seek to root out 
the multiple causes of battering and customize treatment 
to ﬁ t the oﬀ ender’s needs, and group therapy BIPs that 
take the controversial position that spouses are equal par-
ticipants in creating disturbances in relationships.
 
As with arrest research ﬁ ndings, results of studies 
that have examined the eﬀ ectiveness of BIPs are mixed. 
Researchers Labriola, Rempel and Davis (2008, p.252) 
report,
Over the past two decades, a growing number of courts 
have come to rely on batterer programs as their man-
date of choice, especially when the legal issues in a case 
preclude the imposition of jail [the case is classiﬁ ed as a 
misdemeanor]. Th ree of four previously randomized 
trials produced largely negative results. Th e present 
study . . . randomly assigned misdemeanor domestic 
violence oﬀ enders in the Bronx, New York, to either 
a batterer program or not; and to either monthly or 
graduated judicial monitoring with the latter involving 
reduced court appearances in response to compliance 
and increased appearances in response to noncom-
pliance. Th e study found that neither the batterer 
program nor either of the two monitoring schedules 
produced a reduction in oﬃ  cial re-arrest rates for any 
oﬀ ense, for domestic violence, or for domestic vio-
lence with the same victim. Similarly, 1-year victim 
interviews indicated that neither program assignment 
nor monitoring schedule signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ected victim 
reports of re-abuse.
 
Results of studies that have examined the eﬀ ectiveness 
of BIPs suggest that perhaps the most signiﬁ cant factor in 
the rehabilitation of a batterer is the oﬀ ender’s stake in 
in more arrests than are necessary because oﬃ  cers ﬁ nd it 
easier to simply arrest both parties than try to determine 
who the primary aggressor was, even if only one party 
shows injury. A dual arrest policy does not preclude the 
single arrest of the primary aggressor only, if the oﬃ  cer 
is able to make that determination. Factors to consider in 
making this assessment include
• • Prior domestic violence involving either person.
• • Th e relative seriousness of the injuries inﬂ icted upon 
each person involved.
• • Th e potential for future injury.
• • Whether one of the alleged batteries was committed 
in self-defense.
• • Any other factor that helps the oﬃ  cer decide which 
person was the primary physical aggressor.
 
Specialized domestic violence units hold promise 
(Bune, 2007, pp.12–13). Such a unit might consists of a 
detective who jointly works cases with a deputy sheriﬀ  in 
the county. Whenever a patrol oﬃ  cer takes a report, the 
domestic violence unit follows up to ensure proper pro-
cedures have been followed: “Cases involving domestic 
violence require a focused approach with a priority placed 
on the enforcement and prosecution of batterers, direct 
services and support of victims and community outreach. 
Th e utilization of dedicated and specialized units within 
police departments and prosecutors oﬃ  ces has proven 
to be eﬀ ective in a coordinated approach and seems best 
suited to dealing with the continuous cycle of domestic 
violence.”
Police Nonresponse One reason oﬃ  cers are criticized 
for not responding to domestic violence incidents is that 
they commonly receive calls from uninvolved third par-
ties. For example, an apartment tenant calls to say the 
couple across the hall is shouting at each other and it 
sounds like things are being thrown and glass is breaking. 
When oﬃ  cers arrive, the couple may be embarrassed or 
angry because this is how they argue. Th ey see no reason 
to involve the law and are irritated at the interference of 
neighbors and police. In other cases, a spouse may report 
a false domestic violence incident just to see the other 
party punished or the threat of punishment inﬂ icted.
 
Several studies have examined whether the police 
response to domestic violence calls does receive a lower 
priority than other crime calls. Th e results generally show 
an increasingly high priority being placed on such calls.
EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS
Increasing numbers of departments throughout the 
United States are adopting a “zero-tolerance” approach 

CHAPTER 9 | Assault, Domestic Violence, Stalking and Elder Abuse | 305
the batterer threatens or tries to intimidate them into 
dropping the charges.
 
One option commonly suggested to victims of vio-
lent abuse is to obtain an order of protection, also called a 
restraining order.
RESTRAINING ORDERS
Domestic violence victims themselves are taking a more 
active role in preventing recurring assaults by obtaining 
restraining orders. Th ese court-issued documents aim to 
restrict an alleged abuser’s behavior to protect his intended 
victim. A provision of the Violence Against Women Act 
(VAWA) of 1994 assigns full faith and credit to valid 
orders of protection, meaning that an order issued any-
where in the country is legally binding and enforceable 
nationwide.
 
Restraining orders typically take several weeks to 
obtain, but if the victim is in immediate life-threatening 
danger, an emergency restraining order can generally be 
issued within 24 hours. A court hearing is usually con-
ducted before a restraining order is issued, allowing a 
judge time to review the facts of the case provided by the 
victim on the request form and to hear from the abuser, 
if he appears at the hearing. If an order of protection is 
granted, it may contain a variety of conditions regarding 
the abuser’s personal conduct, use of alcohol, child cus-
tody or visitation, child or spousal support, a stay-away 
order, a move-out order and a ban on the possession or 
use of ﬁ rearms.
 
Th is ﬁ nal condition poses a problem for oﬃ  cers 
who have a restraining order ﬁ led against them, as they 
are prohibited from possessing a weapon even while on 
duty. Some restraining orders automatically expire after a 
speciﬁ ed time limit, unless renewed, but others are valid 
indeﬁ nitely unless a request is made for dismissal and a 
court grants such dismissal.
 
Although abuse victims are certainly encouraged to 
protect themselves, they cannot rely solely on a piece of 
paper for security. In fact, some studies have found that 
women who seek restraining orders are well aware of their 
potential ineﬀ ectiveness.
LEGISLATION
In addition to mandatory arrest laws, other laws address 
issues concerning convicted domestic abusers. One such 
statute already discussed is the Lautenberg Amendment 
to the Crime Control Bill of 1968, which  prohibits individ-
uals convicted of misdemeanor crimes involving domestic 
violence from owning or possessing a ﬁ rearm. Th is retro-
active statute is a problem for law enforcement oﬃ  cers, 
for if convicted of domestic violence, they will lose their 
conformity, a constellation of variables that, in eﬀ ect, 
comprise “what an oﬀ ender has to lose,” such as marital 
status, residential stability or employment. Post-BIP recid-
ivism among batterers who were married, owned homes 
and had steady employment was signiﬁ cantly lower than 
for oﬀ enders who were less stable in property ownership, 
employment or marriage (Jackson et al., 2003, p.12).
 
Some jurisdictions have implemented intervention 
programs that draw on the cultural strengths of the com-
munity. In New Mexico, for example, domestic violence in 
Indian Country had become a signiﬁ cant problem, and the 
traditional route of incarceration was not having positive 
results. A sergeant with the local sheriﬀ ’s department, 
himself a Navajo, suggested an intervention program 
built on a fundamental aspect of Native American com-
munities—the clan, and the wisdom of elders. Th e elders’ 
knowledge and experience in resolving conﬂ icts through 
peacemaking is what makes this unique intensive inter-
vention program a success in Indian Country.
 
Dodge (2006, p.84) reports, “Th e published research 
on police and domestic violence conﬁ rms much of what is 
already known and shows strong support for the continued 
emphasis on interagency coordinated responses to inti-
mate partner abuse.” Of equal importance are partnerships 
with the community. Th e biggest obstacle to such partner-
ships is poor oﬃ  cer attitude about partnering, domestic 
violence or both (Reuland, Morabito, Preston and Cheney, 
2006, p.34). According to one chief of police, “Oﬃ  cer atti-
tudes are the biggest barrier to success. Problem attitudes 
include beliefs about victims, such as ‘If the victim won’t 
do something for herself, why should we,’ and that domes-
tic violence is ingrained in our society, and has been for 
centuries, and that it is ‘no big deal.’” Reuland et al. (p.42) 
report, “Most frequently, police respondents said that the 
key to eﬀ ective response to domestic violence is to treat 
it like any other crime, that is seriously, to conduct a solid 
investigation (involving good evidence collection), and to 
make arrests. In addition, the police department must be 
willing to partner with a range of community members 
(including schools and animal shelters) and criminal jus-
tice agencies (such as the court system) to address the 
problem collectively.” Reuland et al. (p.44) conclude, “Th e 
predominant ﬁ nding of this project is that partnerships 
between the police and a community-based partner have 
made tremendous improvements in the way agencies com-
municate and channel their energies toward a shared goal 
of improving safety for the victims of domestic violence.”
 
As important as intervention programs aimed at 
batterers are, of equal importance are eﬀ orts to help vic-
tims. It is fairly common for abuse victims who have ﬁ led 
a report and begun the process of pressing charges to 
change their minds and want to drop charges, either out 
of guilt for having “turned on” their partner or because 

306 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
to pay almost $1 million because they failed to protect 
Tracy from her husband, who had a history of battering 
her (Th urman v. City of Torrington, 1984).
 
To reduce lawsuits, departments should have a pro-
arrest policy if oﬃ  cers have probable cause to believe a 
domestic assault has occurred. Th ey should train oﬃ  cers 
in this pro-arrest policy and require them to document 
why an arrest has or has not been made.
INVESTIGATING STALKING
Closely related to investigating domestic vio-
lence cases is the challenge of investigating 
stalking cases. A stalker is someone who intentionally 
and repeatedly follows, tries to contact, harasses or intim-
idates another person. Th e National Institute of Justice 
(“Stalking,” 2007) states, 
Like domestic violence, stalking is a crime of power and 
control. Stalking is conservatively deﬁ ned as “a course 
of conduct directed at a speciﬁ c person that involves 
repeated (two or more occasions) visual or physical 
proximity, nonconsensual communication, or verbal, 
written, or implied threats, or a combination thereof, 
that would cause a reasonable person fear.” Stalking 
behaviors also may include persistent patterns of leav-
ing or sending the victim unwanted items or damaging 
or threatening to damage the victim’s property, defam-
ing the victim’s character, or harassing the victim via 
the Internet by posting personal information or spread-
ing rumors about the victim.
Although legal deﬁ nitions vary among jurisdictions, 
stalking is generally deﬁ ned as the willful or intentional 
commission of a series of acts that would cause a 
reasonable person to fear death or serious bodily injury 
and that, in fact, does place the victim in fear of death or 
serious bodily injury. 
 
According to the National Center for Injury Prevention 
and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDCP), more than seven million women and two million 
men in this country have been stalked, with stalking aﬀ ect-
ing 7 percent of women (1 in 14) and two percent of men 
(1 in 50) at some time in their lives (Report to Congress, 
no date). Data from the National Center for  Victims of 
Crime (NCVC) (“Stalking Fact Sheet,” 2008) indicate that 
1,006,970 women and more than 370,000 men are stalked 
in the United States every year. Of those, 28  percent of 
females and 10 percent of males had obtained a restrain-
ing order against their stalker.
jobs. Interestingly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
has ruled that the portion of the law denying possession 
of ﬁ rearms to police oﬃ  cers convicted of spouse abuse is 
unconstitutional.
 
Despite the many laws devoted to reducing or elimi-
nating domestic violence, criminal justice should not 
expect too much from such legislation.
AVOIDING LAWSUITS
Failure to respond appropriately to domestic violence can 
result in serious ﬁ nancial liability to local governments. 
More and more, victims of domestic violence are suing 
local governments for failure to protect them. Perhaps the 
most well-known case is that of Tracy Th urman in Tor-
rington, Connecticut. Th e police department was ordered 
Technology Innovations
Healy and Barrios (2007) describe a new Massa-
chusetts law that requires an offender who violates 
a domestic order of protection to wear a global 
positioning system (GPS) monitoring device.
The GPS helps enforce the restraining order by 
preventing the batterer from entering “liberty 
zones,” such as the battered partner’s domicile and 
place of work, their children’s schools, and the 
residences of extended family members. Probation 
agents will monitor offenders to ensure that they 
do not breach these zones. If they do, a record of 
a restraining order violation will be made, thus 
making stalking and further violent attacks more 
difﬁ cult. Further, police and the victim are automat-
ically phoned if the offender breaches the battered 
partner’s liberty zone, thus minimizing the victim’s 
fears of an unexpected confrontation. . . .
The new law not only adapts technology 
that better protects victims, but it also represents 
a logical step toward changing the paradigm of 
responsibility for domestic violence—away from 
the victim to provide for her own safety by hiding, 
and onto the justice system to hold the offender 
accountable. By using GPS technology, we align 
accountability with criminal behavior and do 
more than simply apprise a battered partner of her 
options. The law utilizes modern technology to give 
teeth to a restraining order, making real progress 
toward returning liberty to battered partners and 
their children.

CHAPTER 9 | Assault, Domestic Violence, Stalking and Elder Abuse | 307
victim via computer. However, the problem has grown 
in such scope and severity that more elaborate and spe-
ciﬁ c deﬁ nitions are now used. Th e Department of Justice 
deﬁ nes cyberstalking as the repeated use of the Inter-
net, e-mail, or other digital electronic communications 
devices to stalk another person. Working to Halt Online 
Abuse (“Online Harassment Statistics,” 2008) received 
372 reports of online harassment and cyberstalking for 
calendar year 2006. Like other forms of stalking, cyber-
stalking can turn violent.
 
Th e perception of anonymity aﬀ orded by online activ-
ity is thought to be one reason cyberstalking is on the rise. 
Consequently, states have turned to legislation to address 
this problem.
LEGISLATION AND DEPARTMENT POLICIES
Th e ﬁ rst antistalking laws were passed in 1990 in California. 
Since that time, all 50 states and the District of Columbia 
have enacted general stalking laws, many of which are also 
applicable to cyberstalking oﬀ enses. According to “Cyber-
stalking Laws” (2008), there are currently 45 cyberstalking 
(and related) laws on the books. Title 18, §875 of the U.S. 
Code makes it a federal oﬀ ense to transmit, electronically 
 
Stalking is a crime in every state and the District of 
Columbia and at the federal level. Fifteen states classify 
stalking as a felony upon the ﬁ rst oﬀ ense; 34 states classify 
it as a felony upon the second oﬀ ense or when it involves 
aggravating factors such as possession of a deadly weapon, 
violation of a court order or condition of probation or parole 
(Report to Congress, no date). Additional aggravating factors 
include a victim younger than 16 or the same victim as in 
prior incidents (“Stalking Fact Sheet,” 2008).
 
Stalking often leads to homicide. Statistics on 
 femicide, the murder of a woman, reveal that 76 percent 
of femicide victims had been stalked by the person who 
killed them, and 54 percent had reported the stalking to 
the police before they were murdered by their stalkers 
(“Stalking Fact Sheet,” 2008). Research ﬁ ndings support 
a strong connection between stalking and domestic vio-
lence. Th e seriousness of this problem is further reﬂ ected 
in the fact that almost one-third of the women killed in 
the United States are murdered by their husbands or boy-
friends, and as many as 90 percent are stalked before the 
murder. 
TYPES OF STALKING
Stalkers are typically categorized as a certain typology, 
usually based on the relationship between the stalker and 
the victim. One system of stalking typologies involves the 
three categories of intimate or former intimate, acquain-
tance and stranger stalking.
 
In intimate or former intimate stalking, the stalker and 
victim may be married or divorced, current or former 
cohabitants, serious or casual sexual partners or former 
sexual partners. Th is is the most common relationship 
involved in stalking cases. In acquaintance stalking, the 
stalker and victim know each other casually. Th ey may be 
neighbors or coworkers. Th ey might have even dated once 
or twice but were not sexual partners. In stranger stalking, 
the stalker and victim do not know each other at all.
 
Th e NCVC presents a diﬀ erent set of typologies for stalk-
ers, also including three varieties: the simple obsessional, 
the love obsessional and the erotomanic. Simple obsessional 
stalkers are the basic equivalent of the aforementioned inti-
mate stalkers but also include acquaintance stalkers. Th ese 
cases are the most common type and most often occur in 
the context of domestic violence. Love obsessional stalkers 
have no prior relationship with their victim but become ﬁ x-
ated on that person, often a celebrity, believing they belong 
together. Erotomanic stalkers, the rarest of the three types, 
believe that their victim is in love with them.
Cyberstalking Th e growth of e-mail and use of the 
Internet has resulted in cyberstalking, which, in previous 
editions of this text, was simply deﬁ ned as preying on a 
Dawnette Knight reacts in court as a letter from Catherine 
Zeta-Jones is read Friday, July 8, 2005, in Los Angeles during 
Knight’s sentencing for stalking the actress. Zeta-Jones, who almost 
suffered a nervous breakdown because of the vicious death threats,

Knight wrote more than a dozen letters describing how she was 
going to “slice [Zeta-Jones] up like meat on a bone and feed her to 
the dogs,” so that when she ﬁ nished with “this bitch/whore she will

on Douglas, and was upset when she read in the tabloids that the

co-stars. Knight was given 3 years in state prison, but with credit for 
time served she could be imprisoned for as little as 7 months.

maybe disjointed acts that all have the same motive.” 
He suggests some of the acts reported to police during 
an investigation such as receiving ﬂ owers, love notes 
and stuﬀ ed animals are hardly associated with violent 
crimes, but if such seemingly “innocuous acts” disrupt 
a victim’s life, it is a case of stalking. During stalk-
ing investigations, oﬃ  cers often learn that the crimes 
occurred at several locations across diﬀ erent jurisdic-
tions, so joint eﬀ orts are often needed. Knowing what 
constitutes stalking in an oﬃ  ce’s jurisdiction is crucial: 
“By deﬁ nition stalking requires two or more incidents, 
so a good history is an important part of any investiga-
tion” (Petrocelli, p.23). 
 
Petrocelli (2007b, p.23) recommends encouraging 
victim input: “Th e crime is partially deﬁ ned by the victim’s 
reaction; she must be trained to record the initial, visceral 
reactions to each act. Th ese reactions can be written or 
audio taped in a “stalking log.” Dates, times, locations, 
and her feelings should be immediately recorded. A well-
kept stalking log, supported by physical evidence (phone 
recordings, e-mails, etc.), will not only be strong evidence 
at a trial, but will empower the victim. No longer is she 
just a defenseless victim; now she is a collector of incrimi-
nating evidence, working toward her own justice.”
 
Evaluating the potential for violence is an important 
part of a stalking investigation because stalking behav-
ior can, and in some cases does, elevate to homicide. Th e 
FBI’s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime 
(NCAVC) is a valuable resource in helping stalking inves-
tigators assess an oﬀ ender’s potential for violence. Th e 
NCAVC stresses the need to consider a stalker’s behavior 
in its totality by considering speciﬁ c actions and other fac-
tors, including
• • Th reats to kill.
• • Access to or recent acquisition of weapons.
• • Violations of protective orders.
• • Prior physical violence against the victim or others, 
including pets.
• • Substance abuse.
• • Location of violence (private vs. public setting).
• • Status of the victim-oﬀ ender relationship.
• • Surveillance of the victim and “chance” meetings.
• • Mental illness.
• • Prior intimacy between victim and oﬀ ender.
• • Fantasy—homicidal or suicidal ideation.
• • Obsessive jealousy.
• • Desperation.
• • Blaming the victim for personal problems.
• • Loss of power or control.
or otherwise, any threatening communication in inter-
state or foreign commerce, with such acts punishable by 
ﬁ ne, imprisonment for as long as 5 years or both.
 
Antistalking laws describe speciﬁ c threatening con-
duct and hold the suspect responsible for proving that his 
or her actions were not intended to frighten or intimidate 
the victim. Most stalking laws require proof of a credible 
threat made by the perpetrator against the victim or the 
victim’s family. 
 
Th e NCVC has released model legislation to combat 
stalking by helping states update their laws to reﬂ ect 
changes in what is known about stalking and how stalkers 
operate (“Victims’ Group Issues Model Code,” 2007, p.1).
 
Although legislation makes stalking a speciﬁ c crime 
and empowers law enforcement to combat the oﬀ ense, 
a great deal of variation and subjectivity exists among 
the states’ legal deﬁ nitions of stalking. Many oﬃ  cers are 
unaware of antistalking legislation in their state. And 
many oﬃ  cers do not know about their own department’s 
policy on stalking.
THE POLICE RESPONSE
Th e traditional law enforcement response to stalk-
ers has been to issue restraining orders. Unfortunately, 
such orders are often ineﬀ ective, as demonstrated when 
one oﬀ ender dramatically stabbed his wife to death and 
“knifed” the court order to her chest. Because of this 
proven ineﬀ ectiveness of restraining orders, the perceived 
inability of criminal justice to eﬀ ectively handle stalkers 
and victims’ fear of antagonizing and angering their stalk-
ers, many stalking incidents go unreported.
 
Law enforcement faces a unique challenge in address-
ing and investigating stalking incidents because of the lack 
of clear deﬁ nitions of stalking or of the elements constitut-
ing the oﬀ ense. In general, victims should be encouraged to 
use an answering machine to screen their calls and to docu-
ment the threatening messages. All threatening electronic 
communications should be saved and a hardcopy printed. 
Victims should obtain an unlisted phone number or a new 
e-mail address or change their user name if the harassment 
involves cyberstalking. In short, investigators should sup-
port victims in gathering evidence and in helping to keep 
themselves safe until the stalker can be stopped.
 
One step an oﬃ  cer should take is to assess the threat 
to determine the credibility and overall capability of the 
stalker to actually carry out his expressed intent to cause 
harm. Elements to consider include the target, the stalk-
er’s motivation, the perpetrator’s ability to follow through 
on threats, the stalker’s personal background and the 
victim-oﬀ ender relationship.
 
Petrocelli (2007b, p.22) observes, “Stalking is truly 
a unique crime. It is not a single act, but rather several

for virtually all types of crimes compared to their younger 
counterparts, the unique characteristics of their victim-
ization and its aftermath illuminate the urgent need for 
informed prevention strategies.” Bachman and Meloy 
note that elderly victims, especially females, are more 
likely to require medical attention than are younger vic-
tims. In addition, a violent victimization for community-
dwelling elderly individuals increases their risk of nursing 
home placement following the victimization. Th e National 
Center on Elder Abuse (“Elder Abuse Prevalence and Inci-
dence,” no date) reports, 
According to the best available estimates, between 1 
and 2 million Americans age 65 or older have been 
injured, exploited, or otherwise mistreated by someone 
on whom they depended for care or protection.
 
Estimates of the frequency of elder abuse range 
from 2 percent to 10 percent based on various sam-
pling, survey methods, and case deﬁ nitions.
 
Data on elder abuse in domestic settings suggest 
that 1 in 14 incidents, excluding incidents of self-
 neglect, come to the attention of authorities.
 
It is estimated that for every one case of elder 
abuse, neglect, exploitation, or self-neglect reported to 
authorities, about ﬁ ve more go unreported.
 
Th e OVC Crime Clock shows that one elderly person 
is victimized every 2.7 minutes. However, elder abuse has 
been called a “hidden” or “silent” crime because a large 
percentage of cases are not reported. Determining the 
prevalence of elder abuse is a challenge because of the lack 
of data, a problem compounded by a reluctance to report 
the crime—similar to the situation with domestic assault. 
Some elderly individuals are physically incapable of pro-
viding information or may be suﬀ ering from conditions 
such as senility or Alzheimer’s disease that might cause 
others not to believe their statements. In other cases, vic-
tims may fear further abuse or loss of the care of the only 
provider they have, or they may be embarrassed that their 
child could mistreat them.
TYPES OF ELDER ABUSE
Th e National Center on Elder Abuse (“Major Types of Elder 
Abuse,” 2007) identiﬁ es the following types of elder abuse:  
physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional or psychologi-
cal abuse, neglect (including abandonment), ﬁ nancial or 
material exploitation and self-neglect. Self-neglect refers 
to a refusal or failure to provide himself or herself with 
adequate food, water, clothing, shelter, personal hygiene, 
medication (when indicated) and safety precautions.
Financial Abuse and Exploitation of the Elderly Finan-
cial abuse and exploitation of the elderly is an area of 
growing concern. According to Curtailing Abuse Related 
 
Oﬃ  cers should make a concerted eﬀ ort to talk to 
the stalker, recording the conversation if possible. Oﬃ  -
cers must make it clear to the stalker that this behavior 
is a crime and the actions must cease or an arrest will be 
made. Th e conversation and the suspect’s reaction should 
be in the oﬃ  cial report (Petrocelli, 2007b, p.23). 
 
Complications in investigating cyberstalking include 
the unwillingness of some Internet service providers (ISPs) 
to give law enforcement access to subscribers’ records and 
the increased availability of anonymizing Internet tools, 
such as remailers that strip identifying information from 
e-mail headers and erase transactional data from servers 
that would otherwise be used to trace a message’s author.
INVESTIGATING ELDER ABUSE
A ﬁ nal area to examine in the investigation of 
assault and family violence is elder abuse. Th e 
U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2025, nearly 62 mil-
lion people will be older than age 65, and by 2040, that 
number will climb to 92 million. As the U.S. population 
ages, a growing concern in law enforcement is elder abuse. 
Elder abuse is not a speciﬁ c crime category in many states, 
which makes its frequency data diﬃ  cult to obtain. Elder 
abuse is typically included in the assault, battery or mur-
der category. 
 
Th e National Research Council deﬁ nes elder abuse 
and mistreatment as “(1) intentional actions that cause 
harm or create a serious risk of harm to a vulnerable elder 
by a caregiver or other person who stands in a trust rela-
tionship to the elder, or (b) failure by a caregiver to satisfy 
the elder’s basic needs or to protect the elder from harm” 
(“Elder Abuse,” 2007).
Elder abuse is the physical and emotional abuse, ﬁ nan-
cial exploitation and general neglect of the elderly. The 
extent of elder abuse is currently unknown.
 
Although incidents of burglaries, robberies, motor vehi-
cle thefts, assaults, rapes and homicides of the elderly are rel-
atively well documented in oﬃ  cial reports, or at least at rates 
comparable to those documenting oﬀ enses against other 
age groups, cases of elder abuse typically involve the types of 
victimization that occur outside the spotlight focused on by 
the FBI, in the shadowy fringes of crime collection.
PREVALENCE AND NATURE OF ELDER ABUSE
Bachman and Meloy (2008, p.186) note, “Although elderly 
citizens generally have a much lower rate of victimization

Signs of Physical Abuse of the Elderly Signs of 
physical abuse of the elderly that investigators should be 
aware of include
• • Injury incompatible with the given explanation.
• • Burns (possibly caused by cigarettes, acids or friction 
from ropes).
• • Cuts, pinch marks, scratches, lacerations or puncture 
wounds.
• • Bruises, welts, or discolorations.
• • Dehydration or other malnourishment without 
illness-related causes; unexplained loss of weight.
• • Pallor; sunken eyes or cheeks.
• • Eye injury.
• • Soiled clothing or bedding.
• • Lack of bandages on injuries or stitches where needed, 
or evidence of unset bone fractures.
• • Injuries hidden under the breasts or on other areas of 
the body normally covered by clothing.
• • Frequent use of the emergency room or clinic.
 
Th e American Medical Association provided doctors 
with the following questions, which are equally applicable 
to law enforcement oﬃ  cers:
• • Has anyone at home ever hurt you?
• • Has anyone ever scolded or threatened you?
• • Have you ever signed any documents that you didn’t 
understand?
• • Are you often alone?
• • Are you afraid of anyone at home?
• • Has anyone ever touched you without your consent?
• • Has anyone ever made you do things you didn’t 
want to?
Signs of Financial Abuse of the Elderly Gross (2006) 
notes, “Th e fact that the elderly control 70 percent of the 
nation’s wealth makes them tempting targets for greedy 
relatives or swindlers.” Johnson (2004, pp.23–24) oﬀ ers 
the following indicators for those investigating ﬁ nancial 
abuse and exploitation of the elderly:
• • A recent acquaintance expresses an interest in 
ﬁ nances, promises to provide care or ingratiates him-
self or herself with the elder.
• • A relative or caregiver has no visible means of support 
and is overtly interested in the elder’s ﬁ nancial aﬀ airs.
• • A relative or caregiver expresses concern over the cost 
of caring for the elder, or is reluctant to spend money 
for needed medical treatment.
to the Elderly (CARE), a program administered by River-
side County, California, older Americans account for 60 
percent of all victims contacting the National Fraud Infor-
mation Center (NFIC). 
 
Johnson (2004, pp.2–7) divides elderly ﬁ nancial 
abuse crimes into two categories: (1) fraud committed by 
strangers and (2) exploitation by relatives and caregivers. 
Listed among the types of fraud commonly committed 
against the elderly by strangers are prize and sweepstakes 
scams, investment fraud, charitable contribution fraud, 
home and automobile repair scams, loan and mortgage 
fraud, bogus or unnecessary duplicates of health and life 
insurance policies, fraudulent funeral plans, false health 
remedies and “miracle cures,” travel fraud, conﬁ dence 
games, telemarketing fraud, mail fraud and face-to-face 
contacts that give an oﬀ ender a chance to steal from 
or otherwise scam the elderly victim, such as posing as 
a utility worker to gain access to the home to commit a 
robbery.
 
Even more unsettling than falling victim to a smooth-
talking scam artist is the victimization endured at the 
hands of trusted family members or others with whom the 
victim has an ongoing relationship. According to John-
son (2004, p.5), this type of ﬁ nancial exploitation can 
occur when a relative or caregiver borrows money with-
out repaying, withholds medical care or other services to 
conserve funds, sells the elder’s possessions without per-
mission, signs or cashes pension or Social Security checks 
without permission, misuses the elder’s automated teller 
machine (ATM) or credit cards, forces the elder to sign 
over property or simply takes away the elder’s money, 
property or valuables. Other opportunities for exploita-
tion occur with ﬁ nancial and legal arrangements such as 
joint bank accounts, deed or title transfers, powers of 
attorney and durable powers of attorney and living trusts 
and wills. Johnson (p.7) notes, “Distinguishing between 
an unwise, but legitimate, ﬁ nancial transaction and an 
exploitative transaction resulting from undue inﬂ uence, 
duress, fraud, or lack of informed consent can be diﬃ  -
cult. Suspicious transactions may be well intentioned 
but guided by poor advice. Generally, ﬁ nancial exploita-
tion involves a pattern of behaviors, rather than single 
incidents.”
INDICATORS OF ELDER ABUSE
It cannot always be assumed that a broken bone on an 
elderly person or an unwise ﬁ nancial investment are the 
direct results of elder abuse or exploitation. Older people 
have weaker muscles and bones. Th ey fall and bruise. Th ey 
make bad choices on how to invest their money. But when 
these unfortunate events become a matter of routine, 
they may warrant further investigation.

CHAPTER 9 | Assault, Domestic Violence, Stalking and Elder Abuse | 311
the latter, stating, “You have the lawful right and the legal 
duty to check on an elder’s welfare. . . . It is critical that you 
verify the emotional, physical and, in some cases, ﬁ nan-
cial well-being of the victim, regardless of how much the 
alleged caregiver objects.” Th ree potential abusers of the 
elderly are family members, hired caregivers (in home or 
in a nursing home) and professional con artists. Albrecht 
(p.45) suggests the following investigative responses:
Have patience with your victims. Th ey are usually 
embarrassed, prideful, forgetful, scared and/or fearful 
their cooperation will make things worse.
 
For physical abuse cases, take good photos during 
your ﬁ rst response and again several days later, if possi-
ble. If the victim is hospitalized, speak to the attending 
physicians about the type and severity of the injuries.
 
For ﬁ nancial crimes, collect anything that looks 
like evidence, including credit cards and statements, 
ATM photos (which may be available from the bank for 
only 30 days), bank statements and annuity or invest-
ment account information.
 
For neglect cases, it’s better to document the scene 
by taking comprehensive video of the kitchen, bath-
rooms, bedrooms and other living areas.
 
Make creative arrests to get those people out of the 
house. Run all suspects for warrants, criminal histories, 
probation and parole violations, gang membership, and 
DOJ hits.
 
Petrocelli (2007a, p.16) notes, “Many of the skills 
you have developed in dealing with domestic violence 
and abused children will be applicable in an elder abuse 
investigation.” Investigators should observe the general 
condition of the residence when arriving to investigate an 
elder abuse complaint. Once inside, investigators should 
carefully observe the general conditions and interview the 
alleged victim: “As with all interviews, non-verbal cues 
are as important as the content of the responses. Look 
for the following telltale cues: Is a suspected perpetrator 
hovering in the area, refusing to leave the senior alone 
to answer questions? Is the potential victim answering 
the questions by looking the oﬃ  cer in the eye and giving 
direct responses or is he or she averting eye contact and 
giving ambiguous answers?” (Petrocelli, p.16). 
 
Findings from NIJ-funded research projects help 
caretakers, medical personnel, Adult Protective Services 
agencies, and law enforcement oﬃ  cers recognize abuse 
indicators—known as forensic markers—to help dis-
tinguish between injuries caused by mistreatment and 
those that are the result of accidents, illnesses or aging 
(McNamee and Murphy, 2006). One critical aspect of an 
investigation of physical elder abuse is to determine if 
bruising is the result of an accident or of abuse. Research-
ers have found that accidental bruising occurs in predict-
able locations in older adults, with 90 percent of all bruises 
• • Th e utility and other bills are not being paid.
• • Th e elder’s placement, care or possessions are incon-
sistent with the size of his or her estate.
• • A relative or caregiver isolates the elder, makes 
excuses when friends or family call or visit and does 
not give the elder messages.
• • A relative or caregiver gives implausible explanations 
about ﬁ nances, and the elder is unaware of or unable 
to explain the arrangements made.
• • Checking account and credit card statements are sent 
to a relative or caregiver and are not accessible to the 
elder.
• • At the bank, the elder is accompanied by a relative or 
caregiver who refuses to let the elder speak for himself 
or herself, or the elder appears nervous or afraid of 
the person accompanying him or her.
• • Th e elder is concerned or confused about “missing 
money.”
• • Th ere are suspicious signatures on the elder’s checks, 
or the elder signs checks and another party ﬁ lls in the 
payee and amount sections.
• • Th ere is an unusual amount of banking activity, 
particularly just after joint accounts are set up or 
someone new starts helping with the elder’s ﬁ nances.
• • A will, power of attorney or other legal document 
is drafted, but the elder does not understand its 
implications.
RISK FACTORS FOR ELDER ABUSE 
Th e National Center on Elder Abuse (“Risk Factors for 
Elder Abuse,” 2007) lists several risk factors associated 
with elder abuse: domestic violence grown old; personal 
problems of the abuser, especially in the case of adult chil-
dren; caregiver stress; personal characteristics of the elder 
(dementia, disruptive behaviors, problematic personality 
traits); and the cycle of violence. Th is last factor supports 
the theory that domestic violence is a learned problem-
solving behavior transmitted from one generation to the 
next.
THE POLICE RESPONSE
Controversy exists about the role of law enforcement in 
dealing with elder abuse, especially in identifying “hard-
to-detect” cases. Some departments believe this is the 
responsibility of social services, rather than law enforce-
ment. Other departments feel they are in an ideal posi-
tion to learn from and to assist social services in dealing 
with cases of elder abuse. Albrecht (2008, p.44) is among 

312 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
ness; and a facility’s unwillingness to release medical 
records.
REDUCING ELDER ABUSE
Oﬃ  cers should advise their senior contacts to remain active 
in some type of community group (church, social, neighbor-
hood), because social isolation is one of the greatest con-
tributors to elder mistreatment. Oﬃ  cers should also make 
sure senior contacts know about the services and resource 
centers in their neighborhoods (Petrocelli, 2007a, p.17).
 
One approach to reducing elderly victimization is 
Triad, a cooperative eﬀ ort of the International Association 
of Chiefs of Police (IACP), AARP (formerly the American 
Association of Retired Persons) and the National Sheriﬀ s’ 
Association (NSA). Th ese three organizations are working 
together to design programs to reduce victimization of the 
elderly, assist those who have been victimized and gener-
ally enhance law enforcement services to older adults and 
the community at large. AARP is another resource to tap 
when trying to reduce the occurrence of elder abuse. Th e 
AARP Web site (www.aarp.org) posts numerous articles 
about how to protect against ﬁ nancial exploitation and 
what to do if nursing-home or other caregiver problems 
exist, along with various other links to resources able to 
assist elderly victims.
 
Brito, Luna and Toliver (2006, p.4) recommend 
“Improving the Response to Elder Abuse: A Curriculum 
for Law Enforcement Agencies,” which provides guidance 
in building evidence-based cases by drawing from the 
collective wisdom of law enforcement, elder abuse spe-
cialists, prosecutors and trainers. Th ey explain that this 
program is the result of over a decade of work and is a 
practical, user-friendly, easily adaptable curriculum that 
respects the formats and timeframes typically used by law 
enforcement trainers.
found on the extremities; accidental bruises are rarely, if 
ever, seen on the ears, neck, genitals, buttocks or soles of 
the feet (McNamee and Murphy).
 
NIJ-funded researchers also examined data from the 
deaths of elderly residents in long-term care facilities to 
identify potential markers of abuse. Although most inves-
tigations did not raise suspicions, the researchers identi-
ﬁ ed four categories of markers that often led to referral to 
the attorney general for further investigation (McNamee 
and Murphy, p.19): 
 1. Physical condition/quality of care. Speciﬁ c markers 
include documented but untreated injuries; undocu-
mented injuries and factures; multiple, untreated, 
and/or undocumented pressure sores; medical orders 
not followed; poor oral care, poor hygiene, and lack 
of cleanliness of residents; malnourished residents 
who have no documentation for low weight; bruising 
in unusual locations; statements from family con-
cerning adequacy of care; and observations about the 
level of care for residents with nonattentive family 
members.
 2. Facility characteristics. Speciﬁ c markers include 
un changed linens; strong odors (urine, feces); trash 
cans that have not been emptied; food issues (unclean 
cafeteria); and documented problems in the past.
 3. Inconsistencies. Speciﬁ c markers include: inconsisten-
cies between the medical records, statements made by 
staﬀ  members, and/or observations of investigators; 
inconsistencies in statements among groups inter-
viewed; and inconsistencies between the reported 
time of death and the condition of the body.
 4. Staﬀ  behaviors. Speciﬁ c markers include: staﬀ  mem-
bers who follow an investigator too closely; lack of 
knowledge and/or concern about a resident; unin-
tended or purposeful, verbal or nonverbal evasive-

CHAPTER 9 | Assault, Domestic Violence, Stalking and Elder Abuse | 313
Assault is unlawfully threatening to harm another person, 
actually harming another person or attempting unsuc-
cessfully to do so. Simple assault is intentionally causing 
another to fear immediate bodily harm or death or inten-
tionally inﬂ icting or attempting to inﬂ ict bodily harm on 
another. It is usually a misdemeanor. Aggravated assault 
is an unlawful attack by one person on another to inﬂ ict 
severe bodily injury. It often involves use of a dangerous 
weapon and is a felony. In speciﬁ ed instances, teachers, 
persons operating public conveyances and law enforce-
ment oﬃ  cers use physical force legally.
 
Th e elements of the crime of simple assault are (1) 
intent to do bodily harm to another, (2) present ability 
to commit the act and (3) commission of an overt act 
toward carrying out the intent. An additional element in 
the crime of aggravated assault is that the intentionally 
inﬂ icted bodily injury results in (1) a high probability of 
death; (2) serious, permanent disﬁ gurement; or (3) per-
manent or protracted loss or impairment of the function 
of any body member or organ or other severe bodily harm. 
Attempted assault requires proof of intent and an overt 
act toward committing the crime.
 
Special challenges in investigating assaults include 
distinguishing the victim from the suspect and determin-
ing whether the matter is civil or criminal and whether the 
act was intentional or accidental. Obtaining a complaint 
against simple assault is also sometimes diﬃ  cult. More-
over, such calls may be dangerous for responding oﬃ  cers.
 
To prove the elements of the oﬀ ense of assault, estab-
lish the intent to cause injury and the severity of the injury 
inﬂ icted and determine whether a dangerous weapon was 
used. Physical evidence in an assault case includes photo-
graphs of injuries, clothing of the victim or suspect, weap-
ons, broken objects, bloodstains, hairs, ﬁ bers and other 
signs of an altercation.
 
Domestic assault, stalking, and elder abuse are, for 
reporting and research purposes, candidates for categoriza-
tion as separate crimes rather than being lumped into the 
general category of assault. Domestic violence is deﬁ ned as 
a pattern of behaviors involving physical, sexual, economic 
and emotional abuse, alone or in combination, often by an 
intimate partner, often for the purpose of establishing and 
maintaining power and control over the other partner.
 
Although legal deﬁ nitions vary among jurisdictions, 
stalking is generally deﬁ ned as the willful or intentional 
commission of a series of acts that would cause a reason-
able person to fear death or serious bodily injury and that, 
in fact, does place the victim in fear of death or serious 
bodily injury. Elder abuse is the physical and emotional 
abuse, ﬁ nancial exploitation and general neglect of the 
elderly. Th e extent of elder abuse is currently unknown.

Read the following and then answer the questions:
Mike S. was drinking beer with friends in a local park at 
about 9:00 P.M. It was dark. He knew Tom C. was at the 
other end of the park and that Tom had been seeing Mike’s 
girlfriend, Suzy H. Suzy was with Mike, trying to talk him 
out of doing anything to Tom. Mike said he was going to ﬁ nd 
Tom and “pound him into the ground. When I get through 
with him, they’ll have to take him to the hospital.”
 
Mike left the group and Suzy then, telling them to 
wait for him. Tom C. was found later that night two blocks 
from the park, lying unconscious on a boulevard next to 
the curb. His clothes were torn, and his left arm was cut. 
When he regained consciousness, he told police he was 
walking home from the park when someone jumped out 
from some bushes, grabbed him from behind, beat him 
with ﬁ sts and then hit him over the head with something. 
He did not see his assailant.
 
Mike S. was arrested because a person at the park 
overheard his threats.

Outline
hysically attractive or unattractive people of any age—from very young 
children to senior citizens—may be victims of sexual assault. Sex oﬀ enses 
range from voyeurism (the Peeping Tom) to rape and murder. Sex oﬀ enses can be 
diﬃ  cult to investigate because the victim is often emotionally distraught. Moreover, 
investigating oﬃ  cers may be uncomfortable because they lack special training in 
interviewing sex oﬀ ense victims or oﬀ enders.
P

318 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
 
Some sex oﬀ enders are emotionally disturbed and feel 
no remorse for their actions. For example, a 38-year-old man 
with a 20-year history of sex oﬀ enses admitted to a prison 
psychiatrist that even he could not remember how many 
rapes and sexual assaults he had committed. Th e suspect 
also talked freely about his sexual exploits with children and 
showed no emotion at all. A pedophile—a person who is 
sexually attracted to young children—can be extremely dan-
gerous, as can a sadist, a person who derives sexual gratiﬁ ca-
tion from causing pain to others, often through mutilation.
 
Although some sex oﬀ enders are emotionally dis-
turbed, the fact remains that most victims know their 
attacker and that most attacks occur not in dark alleys but 
in living rooms and bedrooms. According to the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reports 
(Crime in the United States, 2006), an estimated 92,455 
forcible rape oﬀ enses occurred nationwide in 2006, a 1.9 
percent decline from 2002. Of the total number of forcible 
rape oﬀ enses, rapes by force accounted for 91.0 percent. 
Th e remainder were attempts. Th e clearance rate for rape 
was 40.9 percent. Th e Oﬃ  ce for Victims of Crime (OVC) 
(“Crime Clock,” 2008) reports one person is raped every 
2.7 minutes. Further, “Most research supports the claim 
that sexual assault is common in physically abusive rela-
tionships” (Taylor and Gaskin-Laniyan, 2007).
 
Before looking at speciﬁ c sex oﬀ enses, consider three 
other crimes that are directly related to the major focus of 
this chapter—sexual assault.
INVESTIGATING OBSCENE 
TELEPHONE CALLS
“Obscene or harassing phone calls can be one of 
the most stressful and frightening invasions 
of privacy a person experiences” (“How to Put an End,” 
2006). Making obscene telephone calls is a crime. Recall 
that this is a frequent form of harassing stalking behavior. 
Police departments receive complaints of many types of 
harassment calls that are not of a sexual nature and have 
established procedures for investigating such calls. Th e 
same procedures apply to phone calls with sexual 
implications.
In most obscene phone calls, the callers want to 
remain anonymous, using the phone as a barrier between 
themselves and their victims. Th e callers receive sexual or 
psychological gratiﬁ cation from making contact with vic-
tims, even from a distance. Calls involving sexual conno-
tations are threatening to the victims because they have 
no way of knowing the caller’s true intent. Although such 
calls may be made randomly, the caller knows the victim 
in many cases.
If the victim wants to prosecute, the ﬁ rst contact 
may be the phone company. Th e information section at 
the front of most phone directories provides informa-
tion about what constitutes a violation of phone company 
regulations and the law, and provides instructions about 
what to do if a person receives obscene or harassing calls 
(stay calm, do not respond and quietly hang up the phone; 
if the calls persist, call the phone company). Th e company 
will assist the victim in contacting the police for further 
investigation. Caller ID may discourage obscene calls, 
although a caller may still be able to block his or her name, 
phone number or both. Th e police may also use traps and 
traces if given a signed aﬃ  davit from the victim stating 
the facts related to the obscene calls. 
INVESTIGATING 
PROSTITUTION
Prostitution—soliciting sexual intercourse 
for pay—raises several concerns, including 
moral and nuisance concerns, public health concerns, per-
sonal safety concerns, economic concerns and civil rights 
concerns (Scott and Dedel, 2006, pp.2–4). Prostitution 
contributes to the spread of venereal disease and HIV, and 
proﬁ ts from it often go to organized crime. Of special con-
cern to law enforcement oﬃ  cers is the practice of enticing 
very young girls into prostitution. Legislation—for exam-
ple, the Mann Act—attempts to prevent such actions. 
Section 2423 of the act prohibits “coercion or enticement 
of minor females and the taking of male or female persons 
across the state line for immoral purposes.” 
Th e National Institute of Justice’s research on street 
prostitution reveals, “Many women enter prostitution 
as minors and use the income to support a drug habit 
or to stave oﬀ  homelessness. Many suﬀ ered abuse as 

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 319
children. Th ey have extremely high rates of on-the-job 
victimization—possibly the highest homicide rate of 
any group of women studied thus far—and a signiﬁ -
cant number of prostitute homicides remain unsolved” 
(Moses, 2006, p.22).
SINGLE VERSUS SERIAL MURDERERS 
OF PROSTITUTES 
Moses provides the following proﬁ les of single and serial 
murderers of prostitutes:
Single and serial murderers, like their victims, 
appeared to resemble each other on the surface. Th ey 
both shared violent criminal backgrounds, substance 
use histories, and lifestyle choices. Th e sample of per-
petrators consisted of an equal proportion of African 
Americans and Caucasians who ranged in age from 
early to mid-30s.
 
However, serial murderers diﬀ ered from single 
murderers in three areas—sexual aggression, devi-
ant sexual interests, and active sexual fantasies. Serial 
killers engaged more frequently in planning activities 
(such as bringing a victim to a preselected area, remov-
ing clothing from the victim’s body, and so forth), 
 ritualistic behaviors, body mutilation, and removal of 
body parts.
Moses suggests that such knowledge might help state 
and local law enforcement oﬃ  cers identify suspects 
and more eﬃ  ciently and thoroughly investigate such 
homicides.
In some cases the women involved are, in fact, sex 
slaves, another challenge facing law enforcement.
INVESTIGATING HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING
The Th irteenth Amendment to the U.S. Consti-
tution, ratiﬁ ed in 1865, states, “Neither slav-
ery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for 
crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, 
shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to 
their jurisdiction.” But it has yet to be abolished in this 
country. Th e Crime of Human Traﬃ  cking (2008, p.1) 
reports, “Human traﬃ  cking, commonly referred to as 
“modern day slavery” is a global phenomenon that involves 
obtaining or maintaining the labor or services of another 
through the use of force, fraud, or coercion in violation of 
an individual’s human rights. Generating billions of dol-
lars in proﬁ t each year, human traﬃ  cking is one of the 
world’s fastest growing criminal activities, operating on 
the same scale as the illegal trade of guns and drugs. 
Fueled by global economic conditions and increased inter-
national mobility, the market for and trade of human 
beings continues to expand rapidly.”
Human traﬃ  cking yields $9.5 billion a year in global 
proﬁ ts, of which $3.5 billion is generated in the United 
States (Whiting, 2007). Th e U.S. State Department’s 
Traﬃ  cking in Persons Report (2008, p.7) estimates that as 
many as 800,000 people are traﬃ  cked per year interna-
tionally, a ﬁ gure that does not include those traﬃ  cked 
within their own countries. An estimated 80 percent of 
those traﬃ  cked are women and girls, and as many as half 
are minors. Newman (2006, p.5) cautions, “Statistics 
concerning human traﬃ  cking are necessarily unreliable 
because of the clandestine nature of the activity and the 
diﬃ  culties in deﬁ ning it.” 
Signed into law in October 2000, the Traﬃ  cking in 
Victims Protection Act (TVPA) was passed to address the 
problem of traﬃ  cking in persons and to provide for pro-
tection and assistance for victims, prosecution of oﬀ end-
ers and prevention eﬀ orts internationally. Th e TVPA 
deﬁ nes human traﬃ  cking or “severe forms of traﬃ  cking 
in persons” as
• • Th e recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision 
or obtaining of a person for labor or services through 
the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of 
involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slav-
ery. Th is occurs in situations of forced labor such as 
domestic servitude, factory or agricultural work; or
• • Sex traﬃ  cking, meaning the recruitment, harboring, 
transportation, provision or obtaining of a person for 
the purpose of a commercial sex act in which a com-
mercial sex act is induced by force, fraud or coercion, 
or in which the person induced to perform such act is 
under 18 years of age.
Between 2001 and 2005, U.S. attorneys investigated 
555 suspects in matters involving human traﬃ  cking, 
with more than half (58 percent) of the cases for oﬀ enses 
created under the TVPA: forced labor (24 percent), sex 
traﬃ  cking of children (23 percent), traﬃ  cking slaves 
(9 percent) and unlawful conduct or general provisions 
(2 percent) (Motivans and Kyckelhahn, 2006, p.1). 
Almost half (48 percent) of these cases occurred in fed-
eral judicial districts in four states: California (17 per-
cent), Florida (14 percent), Texas (9 percent) and New 
York (8 percent).
Traﬃ  cking victims are often lured by the promise 
of better living conditions and good job opportunities, 
with adults and children being traﬃ  cked for commer-
cial sex or forced labor: “Like domestic violence, sexual 

320 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
• • Th e victim was paid for services.
• • Th e victim had freedom of movement.
• • Th ere were opportunities to escape but the victim 
didn’t.
• • Traﬃ  cking involves the crossing of borders.
• • U.S. citizens can’t be traﬃ  cked.
• • Th e traﬃ  cker’s actions are culturally appropriate.
• • It can’t be traﬃ  cking when the traﬃ  cker and victim 
are related or married.
CHALLENGES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
“Traﬃ  cking involves movement from one place to 
another, often across international borders, leading to 
jurisdictional and investigatory diﬃ  culties for enforce-
ment oﬃ  cials. Additional challenges lie in identiﬁ cation 
and later conviction of oﬀ enders because traﬃ  cking com-
prises multiple crimes instead of a singular event to pros-
ecute. Th is, compounded with the low tendency of victims 
to report crimes, ensures diﬃ  cult enforcement of laws” 
(“United Nations Releases Toolkit,” 2006, p.5). 
Another challenge is attitudes of law enforcement 
agencies toward human traﬃ  cking. Researchers Wilson, 
Walsh and Kleuber (2006, p.2) found that law enforce-
ment agencies do not appear to consider human traﬃ  ck-
ing a high priority problem
Despite the important role of local law enforcement as 
the “frontline” agency for detecting, investigating, and 
prosecuting traﬃ  cking cases, their results show that 
local law enforcement agencies, though fully aware of 
the nature and seriousness of the crime, have engaged 
in few proactive endeavors related to policing human 
traﬃ  cking. Although almost half of the agencies 
assault, stalking, and child and elder abuse, traﬃ  cking 
in persons is an underreported crime, and many cases 
go undiscovered” (Orchowsky, Puryear and Iwama, 
2007, p.1). An additional challenge occurs when traf-
ﬁ cking victims are unable to communicate in English: 
“Victims are often isolated, fear their captives, fear 
law enforcement and the legal system, and lack proper 
documentation. Th ese factors often prevent them from 
cooperating with authorities’ attempts to identify traf-
ﬁ cking cases and assemble evidence against the traﬃ  ck-
ers” (Orchowsky et al., p.1).
TRAFFICKING VERSUS SMUGGLING
Th e Crime of Human Traﬃ  cking (2008, p.3) makes clear 
the key diﬀ erences between the crimes of traﬃ  cking and 
smuggling: 
Smuggling occurs when someone is paid to assist 
another in the illegal crossing of borders. Th is relation-
ship typically ends after the border has been crossed 
and the individual has paid the smuggler a fee for assis-
tance. If the smuggler sells or “brokers” the smuggled 
individual into a condition of servitude, or if the smug-
gled individual cannot pay the smuggler and is then 
forced to work that debt oﬀ , the crime has now turned 
from smuggling into human traﬃ  cking. 
 
A person may choose and arrange to be smuggled 
into a country, but when a person is forced into a situ-
ation of exploitation where their freedom is taken way, 
they are then a victim of human traﬃ  cking. Central to 
the distinction is the denial of the victim’s liberty. An 
individual’s willingness to be smuggled into another 
country does not minimize the victimization he or she 
may experience at the hands of a traﬃ  cker. . . .
 
Under U.S. law, once a person has been held in ser-
vitude, a person’s status as a traﬃ  cking victim super-
sedes all other smuggling or immigration questions and 
aﬀ ords them legal protection and social services.
The key distinction between human trafﬁ cking and 
smuggling lies in the individual’s freedom of choice.
Figure 10.1 illustrates three elements of traﬃ  cking.

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 321
between consenting adults, such as sodomy. Th e former 
are most frequently reported to police and investigated. 
Th e latter are often simply oﬀ ensive to others and are 
 seldom reported or investigated.
Sex offenses include bigamy, child molestation, incest, 
indecent exposure, prostitution, sodomy and rape 
(sexual assault).
Bigamy is marrying another person when one or 
both parties are already married.
Child molestation is usually a felony and includes 
lewd and lascivious acts, indecent exposure, incest or 
statutory rape involving a child, male or female, under 
age 14. Th is is a diﬃ  cult charge to prove because children 
frequently are not believed. Moreover, parents are often 
reluctant to bring charges in such cases. (Th is oﬀ ense is 
discussed in depth in the next chapter.)
Incest is sexual intercourse with another person 
of nearer kin than ﬁ rst cousin when the relationship is 
known. In some states, incest extends beyond bloodlines 
to include people related by adoption.
Indecent exposure is revealing one’s genitals to 
another person to such an extent as to shock the other’s 
sense of decency. It is not necessary to prove intent. Th e 
oﬀ ense is a misdemeanor, although repeated oﬀ enses 
can be charged as a felony in many states. Ordinarily, 
exhibitionists—those who expose themselves—are not 
dangerous but may become so if they are humiliated or 
abused.
Sodomy is any form of anal or oral copulation. 
Although commonly thought of as being performed 
by homosexual males, sodomy can occur between a 
male and female, between two females or between a 
human and an animal (bestiality). Oral or anal penetra-
tion must be proven. Both parties are guilty if the act 
is voluntary. Because sodomy is usually a private act 
between consenting adults, it is difficult to obtain suf-
ficient evidence for prosecution. In some states, sod-
omy between consenting adults is no longer a crime. 
Such acts between adults and juveniles remain crimes, 
however.
Rape—or sexual assault—is sexual intercourse with 
a person against his or her will. Rape is usually consid-
ered the most serious crime after murder and carries a 
heavy penalty in most states. It is now viewed as a violent 
assault rather than a type of deviance.
Sex oﬀ enses may include a wide range of forbidden 
sexual activity, including the following:
• • Cunnilingus—sexual activity involving oral contact 
with the female genitals
(46 percent) agreed that traﬃ  cking is a problem within 
their region of the country, only 40 percent indicated it 
was a problem within their own state, only 35 percent 
believed it is a problem for local agencies, only 18 per-
cent saw it as a problem in their own jurisdiction, and 
only 12 percent saw it as a signiﬁ cant issue for their 
own department. Th e majority of respondents 
(61 percent) agreed that the issue was not really a local 
law enforcement problem and was best handled by fed-
eral law enforcement (72 percent). Only 4 percent of 
the reporting agencies had speciﬁ c personnel assigned 
to deal with investigating human traﬃ  cking.
Identifying Human Trafficking Identifying victims 
and perpetrators of human traﬃ  cking is a major chal-
lenge. Law enforcement professional have to rely on 
their instincts to notice “red ﬂ ags” that might indicate 
someone is a victim or perpetrator of traﬃ  cking. Th ey 
should consider businesses in their community that 
might serve as fronts for traﬃ  cking. Th ey should deter-
mine if building security is used to keep people out or 
to keep them in. What are the working conditions? Do 
workers have freedom of movement? Do they live and 
work in the same place? Do they owe a debt to their 
employers? Do the employers control their workers’ 
immigration documents? Oﬃ  cers should also consider 
the appearance and mannerisms of the workers. Are 
there signs of trauma, fatigue, injuries or other evidence 
of poor care? Are individuals withdrawn, afraid to talk, 
or is the communication censored? (Th e Crime of Human 
Traﬃ  cking, 2008, p.5).
It is diﬃ  cult to get victims and witnesses who are in 
the country illegally to cooperate in investigations and 
prosecutions. A partial solution is now available: “Oﬃ  -
cers investigating human traﬃ  cking now have an option 
that can help overcome the fear and reluctance of victims 
and witnesses who are not in the United States legally. A 
new limited visa option, the T visa, now available under 
federal law, allows important witnesses or victims to 
remain in the United States to testify against human 
traﬃ  ckers and their criminal enterprises” (Ramage, 
2007, p.10).
CLASSIFICATION OF SEX 
OFFENSES
Sex crimes are sometimes classiﬁ ed according 
to whether they involve physical aggression 
and a victim—for example, rape—or are victimless acts 

322 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
Forcible rape is sexual intercourse against a person’s 
will by the use or threat of force. Statutory rape is sexual 
intercourse with a minor, with or without consent.
Th e National Violence against Women Survey 
(NVAWS) reports, “Nearly 18 million women and almost 
three million men in the United States have been raped 
at some time in their lives, and in a single year, more 
than 300,000 women and 93,000 men are estimated to 
have been raped” (Tjaden and Th oennes, 2006). In most 
cases, the victim knew the rapist, the rapes occurred 
in a private setting and the perpetrator did not have a 
weapon or threaten to harm or kill them. However, 38 
percent of victims said they were slapped, hit, kicked, 
bitten, choked or otherwise “beaten up,” and 13 percent 
said they feared that they or someone close to them 
would be harmed or killed. Th e survey also notes that 
in nearly two-thirds of the rape incidents, the victim 
reported that the perpetrator had been using drugs, 
alcohol or both.
According to the Uniform Crime Reports, Crime in 
the United States 2006, in 2006, there were an estimated 
92,455 forcible rapes reported to law enforcement, a 2.0 
percent decrease from 2006. Compared with 1997 data, 
forcible rape declined 3.8 percent. Th e rate of forcible 
rapes in 2006 was estimated at 60.9 oﬀ enses per 100,000 
female inhabitants. Th e clearance rate for forcible rape 
was 40.9 percent in 2006.
Sex crimes are underreported for a variety of reasons, 
the most frequently cited being ambiguity about what 
illicit sexual conduct is, fear of reprisal from the oﬀ ender 
and feelings of embarrassment and stigma. Taylor (2006, 
p.28) reports, “During the past three decades, women 
have become more likely to report rapes and attempted 
rapes—particularly those involving known assailants—to 
police. Reporting by others, such as friends and family 
members, has also risen.” However, between 1992 and 
2000, an average of 31 percent of attempted and com-
pleted rapes were reported, meaning the majority of these 
crimes continue to go unreported (Taylor, p.30).
 Most states have substituted the term sexual assault 
for rape. In this chapter, the words rape and sexual assault 
are used synonymously and interchangeably. In some 
states, statutory rape is classiﬁ ed as “illegal intercourse.” 
In other states, it is classiﬁ ed as “assault with intent to 
commit rape” or as “attempted rape” when the suspect 
is prevented from completing the act. Some states have 
broadened their deﬁ nition to provide that the victim and 
the perpetrator may be of either sex. In addition, several 
states provide greater penalties for attacks on the very 
young and the very old.
• • Fellatio—sexual activity involving oral contact with 
the male genitals
• • Oral copulation—the same as cunnilingus and 
fellatio; the act of joining the mouth of one person 
with the sex organ of another person
• • Penetration—any intrusion, however slight, of any 
part of a person’s body or any object manipulated or 
inserted by a person into the genital or anal openings 
of another’s body, including sexual intercourse in its 
ordinary meaning
• • Sadomasochistic abuse—fettering, binding or 
otherwise physically restraining; whipping; or 
torturing for sexual gratiﬁ cation
• • Sexually explicit conduct—any type of sexual inter-
course between persons of the same or opposite sex, 
bestiality, sadomasochistic abuse, lewd exhibition or 
mutual masturbation
OTHER SEX OFFENSE TERMINOLOGY
Intimate parts usually refers to the primary genital 
areas, groin, inner thighs, buttocks and breasts.
Sexual contact usually includes any act commit-
ted without the complainant’s consent for the suspect’s 
sexual or aggressive satisfaction. This includes touch-
ing the complainant’s intimate parts, forcing another 
person to touch one’s intimate parts or forcing another 
person to touch the complainant’s intimate parts. In 
any of these cases, the body area may be clothed or 
unclothed.
Sexual penetration includes sexual intercourse, 
cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse or any other 
intrusion, no matter how slight, into the victim’s geni-
tal, oral, or anal openings by the suspect’s body or by an 
object. An emission of semen is not required. Any act of 
sexual penetration by the suspect without the aﬃ  rma-
tive, freely given permission of the victim to the spe-
ciﬁ c act of penetration constitutes the crime of sexual 
assault.
RAPE/SEXUAL ASSAULT
Although males report a signiﬁ cant number of 
rapes every year, women are by far the pre-
dominant victims. In view of that, this discussion 
assumes that the victim is usually female and the sus-
pect male. Rape is often classiﬁ ed as either forcible or 
statutory.

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 323
An Act of Sexual Intercourse Th e element of sexual 
intercourse does not require establishing that a complete 
sex act accompanied by ejaculation occurred. Any degree 
of penetration is suﬃ  cient to constitute sexual inter-
course. An emission of semen is not required.
With a Person Other Than a Spouse Th is element 
now allows the possibility of a man being raped, either 
by a male or female. Some states, as noted, are revising 
their laws to include as rape forcible sex acts committed 
by an adult male against another male. Although most 
states require that the victim not be the man’s wife, a hus-
band can be charged with assault. Moreover, some states 
include as rape an act of forced sexual intercourse with a 
wife during a legal separation if the act fulﬁ lls the other 
requirements of rape. Other states are considering laws 
that would include as rape a husband’s forced sexual inter-
course accompanied by serious threats against a wife’s 
life. Oregon has such a law and has tried (and acquitted) 
a husband.
Committed without the Consent of the Victim  Con-
sent given because of fear, panic, emotional disturbance, 
mental illness or retardation; while on drugs or uncon-
scious; or by a child is not considered true consent.
Against the Victim’s Will and by Force Th is element 
has traditionally been the most diﬃ  cult to prove and 
the most subject to attack by the defense. Although laws 
require the victim to use the utmost resistance possible, 
such resistance can result in additional violence and even 
death. A person willing to rape is often willing to injure. 
Th erefore, legislation in many states emphasizes the rap-
ist’s words, actions, and intent rather than the victim’s 
degree of resistance.
Police oﬃ  cers are often asked whether it is better for 
a victim to resist or to submit to a sexual attack. Does 
resistance increase the attacker’s violence? It is a diﬃ  cult 
question to answer because researchers have arrived at 
diﬀ erent conclusions. Some results indicate that resist-
ing reduces the likelihood of continued assault; other 
results indicate that it makes the attacker more violent. 
Some people who have been sexually assaulted reported 
that they fought back only after they had already been 
harmed, which would appear to preclude that resisting 
caused increased violence. It has been found that peo-
ple who have been attacked previously are more apt to 
resist.
One study pointed out that in no other crime are 
victims expected to resist or not to resist their assail-
ants. Everyone has a right to defend himself or herself, 
but whether it is more harmful to the victim to choose 
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME OF RAPE
Rape is deﬁ ned in various ways by state laws, but certain 
elements of the oﬀ ense are fairly universal.
The elements of the crime of rape or sexual assault 
commonly include
• • An act of sexual intercourse
• • with a person other than a spouse,
• • committed without the victim’s consent and
• • against the victim’s will and by force.
Rape is underreported for a number of reasons. Many victims 
feel worthless or guilty afterward. Some fear the social stigma 
associated with rape. Others have a close relationship with 
their rapist and fear that a charge of rape would damage the 
relationship. Many victims appear to be intimidated by the criminal 
justice system in general or by the way the system appears to have 
dealt with rape cases in the past. Here, a policewoman takes 
oral evidence from a rape victim who is seated in the ofﬁ cer’s 
squad car. (© Spencer Grant/Photoedit)

relationship with victim. Th en obtain arrest and search 
warrants. If the suspect is unknown to the victim, check 
modus operandi (MO) ﬁ les and have the victim look at 
photo ﬁ les on sex oﬀ enders.
MO factors important in investigating sex offenses 
include type of offense, words spoken, use of a weapon, 
actual method of attack, time of day, type of location and 
victim’s age.
Th ese MO factors are manifested in the oﬀ ender’s 
behavior and should be asked about when interviewing 
victims, as discussed shortly.
CHALLENGES TO 
INVESTIGATION
Steck-Flynn (2007, p.64) notes, “Th e crime of 
sexual assault can be one of the most diﬃ  cult 
cases to investigate.” Immediate reporting increases the 
changes of obtaining physical evidence. Th e initial call 
concerning a rape (or other sexual oﬀ ense) is normally 
taken by the dispatcher, communications oﬃ  cer or com-
plaint clerk. Th e person taking the call immediately dis-
patches a patrol unit, not only because rape is a felony but 
also because it is a crime in which the oﬀ ender may be 
known or close to the scene. Th e person taking the call 
then tells the victim to wait for the police to arrive if at a 
safe location and not to alter her physical appearance or 
touch anything at the scene. Th e victim is asked whether 
she can identify or describe the suspect, whether she has 
sustained serious injuries and whether she needs immedi-
ate medical assistance. Th e victim should also be advised 
not to wash, shower or douche before having a medical 
exam. As with any violent crime, early response is critical 
in apprehending the suspect and in reducing the victim’s 
anxiety.
Special challenges to investigating rape include the 
sensitive nature of the offense, social attitudes and the 
victim’s horror or embarrassment. A rape investigation 
requires great sensitivity.
To help investigators overcome some of these chal-
lenges, many departments are implementing a procedure 
for victims of sexual assault known as blind reporting.
to defend is not possible to state. Th is must be an indi-
vidual decision. Some police departments do not give 
advice on this question because of the possibility of 
lawsuits.
More emphasis should be placed on the attacker’s 
behavior than on that of the victim. Increasing the pen-
alty where the attacker uses extreme violence may help 
reduce the severity of the attacks, although this is prob-
lematic because of the emotional status and possible men-
tal instability of this type of criminal.
SEX OFFENDERS
Some sexual assault oﬀ enders are sadistic and 
commit physical abuses in hostile, vicious 
manners that result in injury or even death. Others seek 
to control their victims through threats and physical 
strength but do not cause permanent physical injuries. 
Still others act out aggression and hatred in short 
attacks on women selected as random targets. Rapists 
may be categorized as motivated by either power or 
anger. Each category is further divided into two subcat-
egories (Table 10.1).
However, as one reviewer of this text noted, “Many 
rapists commit their acts not because of anger or power 
issues, but because they can. Th ey want sex, and they are 
simply going to take it. Sometimes it’s about evil people 
acting on their own hedonism against weaker individu-
als.” No personality or physical type can be automatically 
eliminated as a sex oﬀ ender. Sex oﬀ enders include those 
who are married, have families and good jobs, are college 
educated and are active churchgoers.
Suspects fall into two general classiﬁ cations: those 
who know the victim and those who are known sex 
oﬀ enders. In the ﬁ rst category are friends of the vic-
tim, people who have daily contact with the victim’s 
relatives, those who make deliveries to the victim’s 
residence or business, and neighbors. In the second cat-
egory are those on ﬁ le in police records as having com-
mitted prior sex oﬀ enses. Known oﬀ enders with prior 
arrests are prime suspects because rehabilitation is 
often unsuccessful.
INFORMATION TO OBTAIN 
If a suspect is arrested at or near the scene, conduct a 
ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation. If much time has elapsed between the 
oﬀ ense and the report, use other means of identiﬁ cation. 
If the victim knows the assailant, obtain the suspect’s 
name, address, complete description and the nature of the 

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 325
Blind reporting allows sexual assault victims to retain 
their anonymity and conﬁ dentiality while sharing critical 
information with law enforcement. It also permits victims 
to gather legal information from law enforcement without 
having to commit immediately to an investigation.
Th e success of blind reporting hinges on whether 
trust can be established between the victim and the inves-
tigator. Figure 10.2 outlines six steps law enforcement 
BLIND REPORTING
Rape victims may feel foolish, hurt, ashamed, vulnerable 
and frightened. Furthermore, the prospect of reliving the 
entire experience by having the police ask detailed and 
personal questions is more than many victims can bear, 
particularly immediately after the incident. However, 
given time, victims may come to trust others enough 
to recount the attack, even hoping to prevent the same 
assailant from attacking others.

other identity-concealing clothing. A time lapse before 
reporting the oﬀ ense can occur because of the victim’s 
embarrassment, confusion or shock or because the vic-
tim was taken to a remote area, giving the suspect time 
to escape.
Establish a command post away from the scene to 
divert attention from the address of the victim and to 
preserve the scene. Conduct the preliminary investi-
gation as described in Chapter 1. Ascertain the back-
ground of both the accuser and, if possible, the accused. 
At a minimum, oﬃ  cers on the scene should do the 
following:
• • Record their arrival time.
• • Determine the victim’s location and condition. 
Request an ambulance if needed. Obtain identiﬁ cation 
of the suspect if possible.
• • Determine whether the suspect is at the scene.
• • Protect the crime scene.
• • Identify and separate witnesses. Obtain valid iden-
tiﬁ cation from them and then obtain preliminary 
statements.
• • Initiate crime broadcast if applicable.
Sometimes it is diﬃ  cult to determine whether an 
assault or homicide is a sex-related crime. Evidence of 
sexual activity observable at the crime scene or on the vic-
tim’s body includes torn or no clothing, seminal ﬂ uid on 
or near the body, genital bruising or injury and sexually 
suggestive positioning of the body.
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Evidence in a rape case shows the amount of force that 
occurred, establishes that a sex act was performed and 
links the act with the suspect.
agencies can take to develop an eﬀ ective blind reporting 
system.
Th e legal acceptability of blind reporting varies from 
state to state, and even from county to county. In jurisdic-
tions where prosecutors accept blind report records, such 
records become the “founding document” in the formal 
sexual assault investigation should the victim decide to 
ﬁ le a complaint and proceed with a full investigation.
Blind reporting procedures provide for collecting cru-
cial medical-legal evidence from sexual assault victims, 
as discussed shortly. However, for the sexual assault vic-
tims who do report the attack immediately, law enforce-
ment personnel must be prepared for a swift yet sensitive 
response.
THE POLICE RESPONSE
The ﬁ rst oﬃ  cers to arrive can make or break a 
rape case depending on how they approach 
the victim. All police oﬃ  cers should have special training 
in handling sexual assault victims. Whenever possible, an 
oﬃ  cer without such training should not be assigned to 
this kind of case.
As soon as you arrive at the scene, announce yourself 
clearly to allay fears the victim may have that the suspect 
is returning. Explain to the victim what is being done for 
her safety. If the rape has just occurred, if there are seri-
ous injuries or if it appears the victim is in shock, call for 
an ambulance.
Protect the crime scene and broadcast a descrip-
tion of the assailant, means and direction of ﬂ ight and 
the time and exact location of the assault. Th e victim 
may be unable to describe the suspect because of stress 
or darkness or because the perpetrator wore a mask or 
1.  Establish and uphold a policy of victim confidentiality.
2.  Allow victims to disclose as little or as much information as they wish.
3.  Accept the information whenever victims might offer it—a delay of disclosure is not
     an indicator of the validity of the statement.
4.  Develop procedures and forms to facilitate anonymous information from third parties
     (e.g., examiners).
5.  Clarify options with victims for future contact—where, how, and under what
     circumstances they may be contacted by the law enforcement agency.
6.  Maintain blind reports in separate files from official complaints to prevent
     inappropriate use.

Six steps for developing an effective blind 
reporting system.

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 327
left behind. Examine washcloths or towels the suspect 
may have used. Photograph any signs of a struggle such 
as broken objects, overturned furniture or, if outdoors, 
disturbed vegetation.
If the assault occurred outdoors, take soil and veg-
etation samples for comparison. If the assault occurred 
in a vehicle, vacuum the car seats and interior to obtain 
soil, hairs and other ﬁ bers. Examine the seats for blood 
and semen stains. DNA analysis has become increasingly 
important in sexual assault cases.
If a suspect is apprehended, photograph any injuries, 
marks or scratches on the suspect’s body. Obtain blood and 
Evidence in a rape case consists of stained or torn 
clothing; scratches, bruises or cuts; evidence of a 
struggle; and semen and bloodstains.
Because such evidence deteriorates rapidly, obtain it 
as soon as possible. Some police departments have rape 
kits that contain the equipment needed to collect, label 
and preserve evidence.
Steck-Flynn (2007, p.66) describes how oﬃ  cers 
responding to a call of sexual assault should proceed:
When responding to a sexual assault scene, the 
way the oﬀ ender gained access to the victim is 
important in determining the scope of the crime scene. 
Th ere also may be primary, secondary or multiple scenes.
 
Th e ﬁ rst thing needed to preserve physical evi-
dence is to secure the scene, ensuring the safety of the 
victim and witnesses. A log of all persons at the scene 
is important, including emergency personnel. Th ey may 
be required to submit samples of hair, DNA, etc. at a 
later date to rule them in or out as a source of evidence 
at the scene. If something looks out of place, collect it, 
even if its connection to the crime or identiﬁ cation is 
unknown.
 
In some cases emergency personnel may have 
arrived on the scene before the police. Th ey may have 
noticed a vehicle or person of interest upon arrival. 
Th ey may also have experienced transient evidence, 
such as odors, at the scene. . . .
 
Medical personnel can be asked to help preserve 
evidence in several ways. First, if there are pools of 
liquid, such as blood, on the ground or ﬂ oor, the 
stretcher can be carried around the material rather 
than wheeled. Wheel tracks through liquid or soil can 
contaminate the material.
 
Any clothing removed from the victim can be 
placed in a clean paper evidence bag and sealed. . . .
 
To maintain the chain of custody where evidence 
on the victim is concerned, whenever possible an oﬃ  cer 
should accompany the victim to the hospital.
It is also unwise to allow civilians or family members 
access to the scene. In the JonBenet Ramsey case, the 
family and several friends stayed in the home for hours. 
To alleviate their restlessness, the single oﬃ  cer at the 
scene let them search the house. Th e father found the 
girl’s body in the basement, which had not been searched. 
Says Steck-Flynn (2007, p.69), “Even if they were not the 
perpetrators of the crime, they surely contaminated and 
destroyed evidence.”
Photograph all injuries to the victim, and take as evi-
dence any torn or stained clothing. Examine the scene for 
other physical evidence such as ﬁ ngerprints, footprints, a 
weapon, stains or personal objects the suspect may have 
A cocktail sits atop a date rape drug detection coaster. The test 
spots in the corners of the coasters are supposed to turn dark blue 
in about 30 seconds if a splash of alcohol contains drugs often used 
to incapacitate victims. Colleges around the country are buying 
millions of coasters that test for “date-rape” drugs in drinks. But 
law enforcement experts say the coasters are ineffective and 
could lead to more assaults by creating a false sense of security. 
The coaster manufacturer, however, contends the 40-cent paper 
coasters are 95 percent accurate. (© AP/Wide World Photos)

of the drug, lower blood pressure, sleepiness, muscle 
relaxation or loss of muscle control, drunk feeling, nau-
sea, problems talking, diﬃ  culty with motor movements, 
loss of consciousness, confusion, problems seeing, dizzi-
ness, confusion and stomach problems.
Another date rape drug is Ecstasy, or MDMA (3,4 
methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Various forms of 
this drug include an odorless, colorless liquid, a white 
powder and a pill. Ecstasy is a stimulant with psychedelic 
eﬀ ects that can last from 4 to 6 hours. It is usually taken 
orally in pill form. Its psychological eﬀ ects include confu-
sion, depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, drug craving and 
paranoia. Adverse physical eﬀ ects include muscle tension, 
involuntary teeth clenching, nausea, blurred vision, feel-
ing faint, tremors, rapid eye movement and sweating or 
chills.
Ketamine is a white powder that can cause hallucina-
tion, lost sense of time and identity, distorted perceptions 
of sight and sound, feeling out of control, impaired motor 
function, problems breathing, convulsions, vomiting, 
out-of-body experiences, memory problems, dream-like 
feeling, numbness and loss of coordination.
Acknowledging the severe and dangerous nature of 
such drug-assisted sexual assaults, the Drug-Induced 
Rape Prevention and Punishment Act was signed in 1996, 
allowing courts to impose prison sentences of as long as 
20 years on anyone intending to use illicit drugs to aid in 
the committing a sexual assault.
Oﬃ  cers investigating a sexual assault where the vic-
tim cannot give much information about the crime should 
suspect a date rape drug is involved. Th erefore, in addition 
to following the usual protocol for investigating sexual 
assault, oﬃ  cers should inform emergency medical tech-
nicians and emergency room (ER) personnel that a date 
rape drug is suspected. Blood and urine tests may show 
the presence of a speciﬁ c drug.
THE VICTIM’S MEDICAL 
EXAMINATION
The rape victim should have a medical examina-
tion as soon as possible to establish injuries, 
to determine whether intercourse occurred and to protect 
against venereal disease and pregnancy. Some hospitals 
provide drugs at the initial examination to lessen the pos-
sibility of pregnancy. Further examination for venereal 
disease is also conducted.
Although each hospital has its own procedures, 
ER doctors and nurses are trained to observe and treat 
hair samples, and give the appropriate tests to determine 
whether the suspect is intoxicated or on drugs. Obtain any 
clothing or possessions of the suspect that might connect 
him with the rape. If necessary, obtain a warrant to search 
his vehicle, home or oﬃ  ce. Such searches may reveal items 
associated with perversion or weapons of the type used in 
the assault.
The Significance of Fantasy in Sexual Assaults  
Because fantasy is strongly associated with sexual assault, 
search warrant applications should include a list of the 
materials they would expect to recover from an oﬀ ender 
who indulged in sexual fantasies, such as sadistic pornog-
raphy, drawings, videotapes, women’s lingerie and cloth-
ing and fantasy stories featuring sexual sadism.
Sexual sadists may be obsessed with keeping trophies 
and recordings of the assaults. Th erefore, any search 
warrant applications in such cases should include photo-
graphs, records, scripts, letters, diaries, audiotapes, vid-
eotapes and newspaper reports of the crimes as possible 
evidence to be seized.
INVESTIGATING DATE RAPE
A particularly diﬃ  cult type of sexual assault is date rape, 
sometimes called acquaintance rape, in which the victim 
knows the suspect. Frequently drugs, including alcohol, 
are involved in such cases. According to the National 
Women’s Health Center, “Because of the eﬀ ects of these 
drugs, victims may be physically helpless, unable to refuse 
sex, and can’t remember what happened. Th e drugs often 
have no color, smell or taste and are easily added to ﬂ a-
vored drinks without the victim’s knowledge” (“Date Rape 
Drugs,” no date). Th e center suggests that most experts 
prefer the term drug-facilitated sexual assault.
Additional evidence in date rape cases may include the 
presence of alcohol, drugs or both in the victim’s system.
Th e three most common date rape drugs are Rohyp-
nol, gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and ketamine. 
Rohypnol is the oldest drug used in this crime and is as 
much as 10 times more powerful than Valium and Halcion 
in producing a slowing of physical and mental responses, 
muscle reﬂ exes and amnesia. It is manufactured in pill 
form and dissolves in liquids. As a safety feature, newly 
produced pills turn blue when added to liquids, but older 
pills, which are still available, have no color. According to 
the National Women’s Health Information Center, Rohyp-
nol can cause the following problems: loss of memory con-
cerning events that happened while under the inﬂ uence 

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 329
INTERVIEWING THE VICTIM
Rape is typically a horrifying, violent experience 
of violation to the victim. Reporting it to the 
police is frequently a courageous act because the victim 
knows that he or she will be forced to relive the experience 
through numerous retellings and that his or her word may 
be doubted. In addition, rape is humiliating and can 
involve numerous undesirable repercussions such as 
ostracism by friends and family, hospitalization, preg-
nancy, venereal disease and even AIDS. At the time of the 
interview, the rape victim may be hysterical or unusually 
calm. Remember: Rape is a crime of aggression and hostil-
ity and is usually conducted violently. Attempt to estab-
lish rapport by using sympathetic body language and 
explaining the necessity for asking sensitive questions.
Attempt to reinforce the victim’s emotional well-
being, but also obtain the facts. Th e pressure and stress 
caused by rape can make victims uncooperative. Insen-
sitive actions by a male investigator may reinforce the 
female victim’s image of male aggressiveness and result in 
refusal to answer questions.
Rape victims sometimes complain that investiga-
tive personnel question the complaint’s validity even 
before hearing the facts, are rude and overly aggressive, 
fail to explain the procedures used in the investigation, 
ask highly personal questions too early in the interview 
or have or express unsympathetic or negative attitudes 
about the victim’s personal appearance, clothing or 
actions, implying that the victim may be partly respon-
sible for the crime.
Both uniformed and investigative personnel, male 
and female, can help the victim cooperate if they are 
understanding and supportive. Such an approach con-
tributes to the victim’s psychological well-being and helps 
obtain information and evidence required to apprehend 
and prosecute the oﬀ ender. Some departments require 
that two investigators or a victim’s advocate be present 
when a rape victim is interviewed.
Although some police feel that professional medical 
personnel should obtain the personal details of a sexual 
attack, this is shirking responsibility. Deal with the vic-
tim’s emotional and psychological needs completely while 
investigating the case and preserving evidence.
Whether the investigator’s gender aﬀ ects the victim’s 
cooperation is debatable. Some believe that a female inves-
tigator should interview female victims. Others feel that 
a male can better show victims that men can be under-
standing and nonaggressive. How much victims cooper-
ate usually depends less on the interviewer’s gender than 
trauma; therefore, they can provide counseling and sup-
port services to the victim during this initial critical phase. 
Good examination-stage care promotes later cooperation 
from the victim.
Th e hospital obtains medical-legal evidence that 
includes a detailed report of an examination of the victim 
for trauma, injuries and intercourse. Th e report contains 
precise descriptions of all bruises, scratches, cuts and 
other injuries. Th e physician’s report contains descriptions 
of the physician’s ﬁ ndings and treatment, the victim’s 
statements, documentation of the presence or absence 
of semen, documentation of the presence of drugs in the 
victim’s system, the speciﬁ c diagnosis of trauma and any 
other speciﬁ c medical facts concerning the victim’s con-
dition. Th e report should contain no conclusions about 
whether the woman was raped because this is a legal mat-
ter for the court to decide. However, in some states, hos-
pitals are required by law to report suspected rape cases 
to the police.
Most hospitals have a sexual assault and vaginal kit in 
the examination room with the proper forms and tests for 
semen. Tests can be made of the vagina, anus or mouth, 
depending on the type of assault. After the examination, 
these kits are given to the police at the victim’s request 
and sent to a crime laboratory for analysis.
The victim should be asked to sign a release form 
that authorizes the medical facility to provide police a 
copy of the examination record. Hospital reports may 
be introduced as evidence even if a police officer was 
not present during the examination. Also ask the hos-
pital and the victim for the clothing the victim was 
wearing at the time of the assault if it was not obtained 
earlier.
Th e victim is reimbursed for medical examination 
costs in jurisdictions that have victim compensation laws. 
In other states, local or state health agencies may cover 
the costs. Personnel at rape crisis centers can assist in 
these arrangements. Such information is important to 
many victims.
As mentioned, many rape victims choose not to go 
to the police immediately following their attack. Such 
victims, however, must be encouraged to seek prompt 
medical attention and to allow for the collection of evi-
dence at a medical examination in case they later decide 
to proceed with an investigation. Given these victims’ 
overwhelming need for privacy and conﬁ dentiality at 
this critical time, the availability of blind reporting is 
extremely beneﬁ cial in motivating sexual assault vic-
tims to proceed with collecting and processing medical 
evidence.
A suspect apprehended at or near the scene also usu-
ally undergoes a similar medical examination.

• • Medical history, physical and mental
• • Occupation, past and present
• • Personal habits
• • Physical description, including attire at the time of the 
incident
• • Recent changes in lifestyle
• • Recent court actions
• • Reputation on the job and in the neighborhood
• • Residence, past and present
• • Social habits
• • Use of alcohol and drugs
Obtain a detailed account of the crime, including the 
suspect’s actions and statements, special characteristics 
or oddities and any unusual sexual behaviors. Determine 
exactly where and how the attack occurred, what hap-
pened before and after the attack and whether the victim 
can give any motive for the attack. Explain what you need 
to know and why, the procedures you will follow and how 
important the victim’s cooperation is. Use open-ended 
questions such as, “Take your time and tell me exactly 
what happened.”
Determine the exact details of resistance, even if not 
required by law. Was there any unconsciousness, paralysis 
or fainting? Was there penetration? Who did the victim 
ﬁ rst talk to after the assault? How soon was the report 
made, and if there was a delay, what was the reason?
Establish lack of consent. Obtain the names of any 
witnesses. Determine where the victim was before the 
attack and whether someone might have seen her and 
followed her. Th e suspect’s description can then be used 
at that location to see whether anyone there can identify 
him. Obtain as much information as possible about the 
suspect: voice, mannerisms, clothing, actions and general 
appearance.
It is important to obtain as many details as possible 
even though they may appear insigniﬁ cant at the time. 
How the initial contact was made; attempts at conceal-
ment; the suspect’s voice, appearance and exact words; 
unusual behavior, including unusual sexual acts per-
formed—all these can be helpful.
ESTABLISHING THE BEHAVIORAL PROFILE IN 
SEX OFFENSE CASES
Because rapists are generally recidivists (about 70 percent 
of them commit more than one rape), the details and MOs 
of oﬀ enses in another area of the same city or another 
community might be identical to the present case. For this 
reason, the usefulness of behavioral proﬁ ling becomes 
on his or her attitude, patience, understanding, compe-
tence and ability to establish rapport. Treat the victim 
with care, concern, and understanding. Assume that 
the sexual assault is real unless facts ultimately prove 
otherwise.
Th e interview location is also important. Th e police 
station may be unsatisfactory. Th e victim’s home may be 
ideal—if the rape did not occur there. Tell the victim you 
must ask questions about the incident and ask where she 
would be most comfortable talking about it. If the victim 
is hospitalized, consult with the medical staﬀ  about when 
you can question her or him.
No matter where the interview is conducted, do it pri-
vately. Although the victim should be allowed to have a 
relative or friend nearby to talk to, it is better to be alone 
with the victim when speciﬁ c questions are asked. If the 
victim insists on having someone with her, discuss with 
this person the procedure to be followed. Explain that the 
person’s presence is important to the victim for reassur-
ance and security but that the person must allow the vic-
tim to talk freely and not interrupt.
Th e victim’s family and friends can considerably inﬂ u-
ence whether the victim relates the entire story. A wide 
range of emotions can occur from mothers, fathers, hus-
bands or other family members. Th ey may be silent, hys-
terical, or angry to the point that they have every intention 
of killing the perpetrator if they ﬁ nd him. Sometimes such 
anger is turned against the victim.
Make a complete report of the victim’s appear-
ance and behavior: presence of liquor or drugs; bruises, 
scratches or marks; manner of speech; emotional condi-
tion; appearance of clothes or hair; color of face; smeared 
makeup; torn clothes; and stains. Take photographs to 
supplement your notes.
Th e needed initial information includes the vic-
tim’s name, age, home address, work address, telephone 
number(s) and any prior relationship with the oﬀ ender, if 
the oﬀ ender is known. At a later interview, investigators 
should obtain additional information about the victim, 
including 
• • Children and their ages 
• • Educational level of victim
• • Family, parents and the nature of the victim’s rela-
tionship with them
• • Fears
• • Financial status, past and present
• • Friends and enemies
• • Hobbies
• • Marital status

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 331
Such demands also shed insight into the oﬀ ender’s 
motivation.
Speciﬁ cally ask victims about any change in the 
oﬀ ender’s behavior, either verbal, physical or sexual. Such 
changes can indicate weakness or fear if the oﬀ ender 
lessens his eﬀ orts, or anger and hostility if he suddenly 
increases his eﬀ orts.
A further area of inquiry relates to the oﬀ ender’s 
experience level. Did he take actions to protect his iden-
tity, to destroy or remove evidence or to make certain 
he had an escape route? Th e novice rapist may take 
minimal or obvious actions to protect his identity—for 
example, wearing a ski mask and gloves, changing his 
voice tone, aﬀ ecting an accent, ordering the victim not 
to look at him, or blindfolding and binding the victim. 
Th ese are common precautions a person not knowledge-
able of phosphotate tests of hair and ﬁ ber evidence 
would be expected to take. In contrast, the experienced 
rapist may walk through the residence or prepare an 
escape route, disable the phone, order the victim to 
shower or douche, bring bindings or gags, wear surgi-
cal gloves or take or force the victim to wash items the 
rapist touched or ejaculated on, such as bedding and the 
victim’s clothing.
Also determine whether any items other than those 
of evidentiary value were taken by the oﬀ ender. Of inter-
est are items of value as well as items of a personal nature. 
It is important to determine whether items were taken 
and why. Again, such information may provide insight 
into the oﬀ ender’s motivation.
ENDING THE VICTIM INTERVIEW
End the interview with an explanation of available vic-
tim assistance programs, such as Sexual Oﬀ ense Services 
(SOS). Arrange for relatives, friends or personnel from a 
rape crisis center to help the victim. If the victim refuses 
to be questioned, is incapable of answering questions 
because of shock or injuries or begins the interview but 
then breaks down emotionally, terminate the interview 
for the time being, but return later.
Explain to the victim what will happen next in 
the criminal justice system. Give the victim the case 
number and a phone number to call at the police 
department if any other details are remembered or if 
questions arise.
FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION
After the preliminary investigation, medical examination 
and initial interview are completed, conduct a follow-up 
investigation. Interview the victim again in 2 to 5 days 
apparent, and interviews with victims should focus on the 
oﬀ ender’s behavior.
Several speciﬁ c areas should be covered in the 
 behavior-oriented interview of rape victims, embodied 
in three essential basic steps: (1) Carefully interview the 
victim about the rapist’s behavior, (2) analyze that behav-
ior to ascertain the motivation underlying the assault and 
(3) compile a proﬁ le of the individual likely to have com-
mitted the crime.
Th e three types of rapist behavior of concern to inves-
tigators are physical (use of force), verbal and sexual. 
First, ascertain the method of approach. Th ree common 
approaches are the “con” approach, in which the oﬀ ender 
is initially friendly, even charming, and dupes the victim; 
the “blitz” approach, in which the oﬀ ender directly physi-
cally assaults the victim, frequently gagging, binding or 
blindfolding the victim; and the “surprise” approach, 
in which the oﬀ ender hides in the back seat of a car, in 
shrubbery or behind a wall or waits until the victim is 
sleeping.
After determining the approach, you should determine 
how the perpetrator maintained control. Four common 
methods of control are (1) mere presence, (2) verbal threats, 
(3) display of a weapon and (4) use of physical force.
If the rapist used physical force, it is important to 
determine the amount of force because this gives insight 
into the oﬀ ender’s motivations. Four levels of physical 
force may be used: (1) minimal, perhaps slapping; (2) mod-
erate, repeated hitting; (3) excessive, beating resulting in 
bruises and cuts; and (4) brutal, sadistic torture. Th is last 
type of oﬀ ender is typically extremely profane, abusive 
and aggressive, and the victim may require hospitaliza-
tion or die.
Sexual sadists become more sexually excited the more 
the victim suﬀ ers. Th e pleasure of complete domination 
over another person is the essence of the sadistic drive. 
Most sadists are cunning and deceitful and feel no remorse 
or compassion. Th ey feel superior to society, especially 
the law. Th ey often use pliers, electric cattle prods, whips, 
ﬁ re, bondage, amputation and objects inserted into the 
vagina. Th ey may keep diaries, audiotapes, sexual devices 
and devices to torture victims, photographs of victims and 
other incriminating evidence—all items to be included in 
a search warrant.
In addition to the oﬀ ender’s sexual behavior, investi-
gators should inquire about the oﬀ ender’s verbal behav-
ior. Th emes in rapists’ conversations include threats, 
orders, personal inquiries of the victim, personal revela-
tions, obscene names, racial epithets and inquiries about 
the victim’s sexual enjoyment. Also ask about the victim’s 
verbal behavior. Did the oﬀ ender demand that the victim 
say certain words or demand that she beg, plead, scream? 

332 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
When interrogating sex offenders, obtain as much 
information as possible, yet remain nonjudgmental. 
The suspect should be the last person interviewed. 
This allows the interviewer to have all information 
possible by the time of the suspect interview: facts 
about the victim, the type of offense and the location 
of the crime; statements from witnesses, neighbors 
and informants; and information about the suspect’s 
background.
As in most interrogation situations, building rapport 
is the ﬁ rst step. Suggest to the suspect that you under-
stand what he is going through. Ask about his family, 
his job and his interests. Assess the suspect’s character. 
After rapport is established, ask the suspect to tell his 
side of the story from beginning to end and do not inter-
rupt him. Show interest in what he is saying and keep 
him talking. Th e interrogator’s approach should be one 
of “you tell me what happened and I will understand,” 
even though that may not be the investigator’s actual 
feelings.
Th e objective is to obtain the truth and the informa-
tion necessary for proving guilt or innocence. To help 
accomplish this goal, attempt to gain the suspect’s con-
ﬁ dence. Many suspects feel they can justify their actions 
by putting some blame on the victim—for example, “She 
came on to me.”
During the interrogation, remember that the serious-
ness of the charge to be brought will be based on the infor-
mation you obtain. All elements of the charged oﬀ ense 
must be proven, so keep the possible charges in mind and 
prepare questions to elicit supporting information.
COORDINATION WITH OTHER 
AGENCIES
A number of other agencies and individuals 
assist in handling rape cases.
A rape case often involves cooperation with medical 
personnel, social workers, rape-crisis-center personnel 
and the news media.
Th e public and the news media can greatly inﬂ uence 
the prosecution of a rape case. Medical and hospital per-
sonnel inﬂ uence the victim’s attitude and cooperation 
in obtaining facts for medical reports and the necessary 
evidence for use in court. Rape crisis centers can provide 
various kinds of support to victims and encourage them 
to sign a complaint.
to obtain further information and to compare the state-
ments made after time has elapsed. Following that inter-
view, determine whether the crime scene or evidence has 
been altered or contaminated and interview all possible 
witnesses to the oﬀ ense.
Many prosecutors discourage conducting follow-up 
interviews with sexual assault victims, contending that 
the only thing these interviews accomplish is to provide 
the defense with inconsistent statements. Instead, these 
prosecutors argue, the victim should be interviewed by 
the on-the-scene oﬃ  cer and then formally interviewed by 
the investigator. Sexual assault investigators should be 
cognizant of this hazard of inconsistent statements and 
be familiar with the practices and preferences of prosecu-
tors in their jurisdiction.
INTERVIEWING WITNESSES
Locate witnesses as soon as possible, and obtain 
their names, addresses and phone numbers. 
Canvass the neighborhood for possible witnesses. Even 
though witnesses may not have seen the incident, they 
may be able to describe the suspect or his vehicle. Th ey 
may have heard screams or statements made by the vic-
tim or the oﬀ ender.
Determine whether a relationship exists between the 
witness and the victim or oﬀ ender. Determine exactly 
what the witness saw and heard. Did the witness see the 
victim before, during or after the assault? Did the witness 
see the victim with the suspect? How did the witness hap-
pen to be in the vicinity where the oﬀ ense occurred? Inter-
view acquaintances and individuals known to the victim, 
because many victims know their rapists. Th e incidence of 
date rape has been increasing. In such cases, it is a matter 
of proving lack of consent.
TAKING A SUSPECT 
INTO CUSTODY AND 
INTERROGATION
If a suspect is apprehended at the scene, record 
any spontaneous statements made by the sus-
pect and photograph him. If more than one suspect is 
present, separate them. Do not allow communication 
among suspect, victim and witness. Remove the suspect 
from the scene as soon as possible.

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 333
the county where the crime occurred pay the medical 
examination expenses.
Many recent laws have reduced the penalties for sexual 
assault, which should lead to more convictions.
Former penalties were so severe that many juries hes-
itated to convict. More recent laws usually include both 
oral and anal sexual conduct, and many classify sexual 
oﬀ enses by degrees.
Some victims decide not to prosecute because of pres-
sure from family or friends, fear of reprisal, shame, fear of 
going to court or emotional or mental disturbance. Some-
times the prosecuting attorney refuses to take the case to 
court because the case is weak and thus has little chance 
of conviction. For example, there may not be enough 
physical evidence to corroborate the victim’s complaint, 
the victim may be a known prostitute or a girlfriend of 
the rapist or she may be pregnant because of prior sexual 
relations with the assailant. At other times, the report is 
unfounded and unsubstantiated by the evidence.
FALSE REPORTS 
Women make false reports of sexual assault for a number 
of reasons, including getting revenge on lovers who have 
jilted them, covering up a pregnancy or getting attention. 
Such circumstances need to be ruled out when investigat-
ing a reported sexual assault. Th e credibility of rape reports 
is probably questioned more frequently than that of any 
other felony report. A polygraph can help determine the 
truth of the complainant’s statements. If the evidence of 
a false report is overwhelming, include all the facts in your 
closeout report.
If the victim admits orally or in writing that her story 
was false, close the case. When the victim’s credibility is 
in serious doubt because of contradictory evidence, the 
investigating oﬃ  cer’s superior or the prosecutor can close 
the case.
CIVIL COMMITMENT OF SEX 
OFFENDERS AFTER SENTENCES 
SERVED
Because of the high recidivism rate of sex 
 oﬀ enders following their release from jail or 
prison, many advocate legislation that allows the civil 
commitment of sex oﬀ enders upon completion of their 
PROSECUTION OF RAPE AND 
STATUTORY CHARGES
Few criminal cases are as diﬃ  cult to prosecute 
as rape, at least under older laws. Despite 
changes in the law, it is virtually impossible to obtain a 
conviction on the victim’s testimony alone.
Conviction in sexual assault cases requires medical evi-
dence, physical evidence such as torn clothing, evidence 
of injuries and a complaint reported reasonably close to 
the time of the assault.
Defendants usually want a jury trial because of pres-
ent laws and attitudes regarding rape, and because the 
defendant is not required to testify. However, the vic-
tim must relate a very diﬃ  cult ordeal and be subjected to 
cross-examination that can make her appear to be the one 
on trial.
Juries tend to be unsympathetic with a victim who 
was drinking heavily, hitchhiking or using drugs or who 
left a bar with a stranger or engaged in other socially “unac-
ceptable” actions. Many newer laws make it very explicit 
that such conditions are not to be considered during the 
trial. Newer laws also state that the victim’s testimony 
need not be corroborated and that testimony about the 
degree of resistance—although it may be admitted—is 
not required.
Moreover, testimony about the victim’s previous sex-
ual conduct is not admissible unless (1) the victim has had 
prior sexual relations with the defendant, (2) there is evi-
dence of venereal disease or pregnancy resulting from the 
assault, (3) circumstances suggest that consent occurred 
within the calendar year or (4) the victim has not told the 
truth or has ﬁ led a false report.
Juries must not be instructed that a victim who con-
sented to sexual intercourse with other persons would be 
likely to have consented with the defendant, that the vic-
tim’s prior sexual conduct may be used to determine cred-
ibility or that the victim’s testimony should be subjected 
to any greater test of credibility than in any other crime. 
Some have argued, however, that victims’ characters are 
being judged even before a case has a chance to go to trial. 
Th ese critics contend that victim characteristics and cred-
ibility issues frequently prevent sexual assault cases from 
ever reaching court by negatively aﬀ ecting prosecutors’ 
charging decisions in sexual assault cases.
Some states have made it illegal to publish the names 
or addresses of sex crime victims and have required that

in rural Minnesota and has never been found. Th e Jacob 
Wetterling Crimes against Children and Sexually Violent 
Oﬀ ender Registration Act was enacted as part of Presi-
dent Clinton’s 1994 Crime Act. It required states to estab-
lish registration systems for convicted child molesters 
and other sexually violent oﬀ enders. States could release 
the information to the public, but they were not required 
to do so.
Th e second act was named for 7-year-old Megan 
Kanka, raped and murdered by a convicted sex oﬀ ender 
who lived across the street from Megan’s family with 
two other released sex oﬀ enders. Megan’s Law, signed by 
President Clinton in 1996, amends the Jacob Wetterling 
Act in two ways: (1) It requires states to release any rel-
evant information about registered sex oﬀ enders neces-
sary to maintain and protect public safety and (2) it allows 
disclosure of information collected under a state registra-
tion program for any purpose permitted under the laws 
of the state.
Th e third law in the federal trilogy was named for 
a victims’ rights advocate killed in a plane crash in July 
1996. Oﬃ  cially called the Pam Lychner Sexual Oﬀ ender 
Tracking and Identiﬁ cation Act, it directed the FBI to 
establish a national sex oﬀ ender database. Th e permanent 
National Sex Oﬀ ender Registry File is part of the FBI’s 
National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and includes 
ﬁ ngerprint and photo images of registered oﬀ enders.
Th e ﬁ rst sex oﬀ ender registry was created in Califor-
nia in 1947, before it was legally required. By 1996, all 
states had enacted laws requiring sex oﬀ enders to regis-
ter within their states to help law enforcement agencies 
manage oﬀ enders released from secure conﬁ nement. In 
California, failure to register as a sex oﬀ ender is a felony, 
making punishment more severe. If the previous sex crime 
itself was a felony, failure to register carries a mandated 
prison term. 
In 2006, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety 
Act was signed into law. Title I of the act was the Sex 
Oﬀ ender Registration and Notiﬁ cation Act (SORNA), 
establishing comprehensive standards for sex oﬀ ender 
registration and notiﬁ cation (Horst, 2007, p.18). As of 
July 1, 2006, all 50 states are included in the National 
Sex Oﬀ ender Public Registry (NSOPR) Web site, which 
incorporates real-time public data on sex oﬀ enders 
around the country, allowing citizens to view registries 
outside their own states. Sharing information on the 
500,000 registered sex oﬀ enders in the United States 
is an eﬀ ective prevention tool in tracking an individual 
from one area to another (“DOJ Sex Oﬀ ender Registry,” 
2006, pp.1, 4). Th e registry can be accessed at http://
www.nsopr.gov.
sentence. Sex oﬀ ender civil commitment (SOCC) has been 
enacted in 16 states amid widespread controversy (Lucken 
and Bates, 2008, p.95). Such legislation acknowledges 
that although sex oﬀ enders may have paid a debt to soci-
ety by spending time behind bars, often little if anything 
is accomplished during this incarceration to address and 
treat the disorders that lead oﬀ enders to commit sexual 
assault.
Although many contend that these acts violate oﬀ end-
ers’ civil rights, the Supreme Court has upheld the consti-
tutionality of at least one state’s civil commitment law. 
In Kansas v. Hendricks (1997), the Court upheld Kansas’ 
Sexually Violent Predator Act, which establishes proce-
dures by which that state may civilly commit to a mental 
hospital people likely to commit predatory acts of sexual 
violence because of a mental abnormality or personality 
disorder.
However, in Kansas v. Crane (2002), the Supreme 
Court began reﬁ ning its 1997 ruling in Hendricks, adding 
a new limitation on such civil commitments, saying that 
there must be “proof of [an oﬀ ender’s] serious diﬃ  culty in 
controlling [his] behavior.”
SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY AND 
NOTIFICATION
With the realization that many convicted sex 
oﬀ enders have committed one or more such 
crimes before the current act for which they are serving 
time has come a ﬂ urry of legislation designed to notify the 
public of such predators living in their communities and 
to assist law enforcement in keeping track of these recidi-
vism-prone individuals.
However, because of the highly mobile nature of 
today’s society, it is increasingly diﬃ  cult to monitor these 
oﬀ enders as they move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, 
changing their names and appearances along the way. 
Nonetheless, state and national sex oﬀ ender registries 
have proliferated in recent years, as mandated by law 
(Figure 10.3). 
The evolution of sex offender registries can be traced to 
a trilogy of federal statutes: the Jacob Wetterling Act, 
Megan’s Law and the Pam Lychner Act.
Th e ﬁ rst act was named for 11-year-old Jacob Wet-
terling, who was abducted in October 1989 near his home 

CHAPTER 10 | Sex Offenses | 335
harassment of oﬀ enders and increased acts of vigilantism. 
Sometimes the stigma placed on sex oﬀ enders is too great a 
burden to handle. A convicted child molester in Maine shot 
himself to death, saying in a tape-recorded message that he 
feared living in a world “with no forgiveness.”
It appears that sex oﬀ ender registration and notiﬁ -
cation have more supporters than opponents. Internet 
access is quickly revolutionizing the way the public keeps 
informed of the whereabouts of convicted sex oﬀ enders. 
In many jurisdictions, residents are now able to access a 
registry online, enter their zip codes and obtain informa-
tion on sex oﬀ enders living in their area.
A case in point: the May 2005 kidnapping of 8-year-old 
Shasta Groene and her 9-year-old brother, Dylan, from their 
Idaho home by registered sex oﬀ ender Joseph Edward Dun-
can III. Th e children’s mother, older brother and the mother’s 
boyfriend had been slain in their home just before the kidnap-
pings, and Dylan’s remains were later discovered after Shasta 
had been rescued and Duncan apprehended. At the time of 
Many arguments exist both for and against sex oﬀ ender 
registries and notiﬁ cation laws. People who advocate sex 
oﬀ ender registration and notiﬁ cation cite the signiﬁ cant 
number of sex oﬀ enders under community supervision, 
the fear of recidivism and the protection of children and 
their families. Th e challenge is to balance the communities’ 
rights to access public information with the protections 
provided to convicted oﬀ enders.
Th e three basic objections to notiﬁ cation laws center 
around punishment, privacy and due process issues. Some 
oﬀ enders claim that registering subjects them to additional 
punishment. Th e National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers (NACDL) asserts, “It’s a ﬁ ction to say that this is a 
civil matter when this is, in fact, an extension of the crimi-
nal punishment” (VanderHart, 2008). However, in April 
1998, the Supreme Court rejected constitutional challenges 
that claimed that the laws’ notiﬁ cation requirements rep-
resented an unconstitutional added punishment. Another 
concern of opponents is that notiﬁ cation will lead to

the deterrent it provides against repeat oﬀ ending and the 
higher level of protection oﬀ ered to the public by ensuring 
a subject does not enter prescribed areas such as an ele-
mentary school or victim’s neighborhood without enforce-
ment agencies being immediately notiﬁ ed (p.25).
Another eﬀ ort to track released sex oﬀ enders is to 
screen them against motor vehicle databases when they 
apply for or renew a driver’s license. Th e National Center 
for Missing and Exploited Children says, “States should 
adopt policies that ﬂ ag driver-license and vehicle registra-
tion ﬁ les of registered sex oﬀ enders as a means of keeping 
law enforcement authorities informed of address changes, 
vehicle information and personal data” (“Plan to Monitor 
Sex Oﬀ enders,” 2008, p.6).

Several young people in a car wave down a police car and 
tell the oﬃ  cers that screams are coming from the south 
end of a nearby park. At about the same time, the police 
dispatcher receives a call from a resident who says she 
hears screams and cries for help but cannot tell exactly 
what part of the park they are coming from. Th e oﬃ  -
cers talk to the juveniles, get their names and a descrip-
tion of the area and then head for the park without red 
lights and siren to avoid warning the attacker. Arriving 
at the south end of the park, the oﬃ  cers see a man run-
ning from some bushes. He is wearing a dark jacket and is 
bareheaded. One oﬃ  cer goes to ﬁ nd the victim; the other 
attempts to follow the ﬂ eeing man. At the scene, the oﬃ  -
cer observes a woman with torn clothing and a cut on the 
side of her head. She is unable to speak coherently, but 
she has obviously been assaulted. Th e juveniles have fol-
lowed the squad car to the scene and crowd around the 
victim to oﬀ er help. Th e oﬃ  cer chasing the suspect has 
lost him and has returned to the scene. Both oﬃ  cers help 
APPLICATION
Th e key distinction between human traﬃ  cking and smug-
gling lies in the individual’s freedom of choice. Sex oﬀ enses 
include bigamy, child molestation, incest, indecent expo-
sure, prostitution, sodomy and rape (sexual assault) . Th e 
most serious of these is rape—sexual intercourse with a 
person against the person’s will. Rape is classiﬁ ed as forc-
ible (by use or threats of force) or statutory (with a minor, 
with or without consent).
 
Most states include the following elements in deﬁ n-
ing the crime of rape or sexual assault: (1) an act of sexual 
intercourse, (2) with a person other than a spouse, (3) 
committed without the victim’s consent, (4) against the 
victim’s will and by force.
 
MO factors important in investigating sex oﬀ enses 
include type of oﬀ ense, words spoken, use of a weapon, 
method of attack, time of day, type of location and vic-
tim’s age. Special challenges in investigating rape include 
the sensitive nature of the oﬀ ense, social attitudes and 
the victim’s horror or embarrassment. A rape investiga-
tion requires great sensitivity. To help overcome some of 
these challenges, many departments are implementing a 
procedure known as blind reporting, which allows sexual 
assault victims to retain their anonymity and conﬁ denti-
ality while sharing critical information with law enforce-
ment. It also permits victims to gather legal information 
from law enforcement without having to commit immedi-
ately to an investigation.
 
Physical evidence commonly found in rape cases 
includes stained or torn clothing; scratches, bruises or 
cuts; evidence of a struggle; and semen and bloodstains. 
Additional evidence in date rape cases may include 
the presence of alcohol, drugs or both in the victim’s 
system.
 
A rape case often involves cooperation with medical 
personnel, social workers, personnel of rape crisis cen-
ters and news media. Conviction in sexual assault cases 
requires medical evidence, physical evidence such as torn 
clothing, evidence of injuries and a complaint reported 
reasonably close to the time of the assault. Many recent 
laws have reduced the penalties for sexual assault, which 
should lead to more convictions.
 
Th e evolution of sex oﬀ ender registries can be traced 
to a trilogy of federal statutes: the Jacob Wetterling Act, 
Megan’s Law and the Pam Lychner Act.

Crime and Evidence 
in Action
Go to the CD and choose the domestic 
violence case. During the case, you’ll become a patrol 
oﬃ  cer, detective, prosecutor, corrections oﬃ  cer and 
probation oﬃ  cer to conduct interactive investigative 
research. Each case unfolds as you respond to key deci-
sion points. Feedback for each possible answer choice is 
packed full of information, including term deﬁ nitions, 
Web links and important documentation. Th e sergeant 
is available at certain times to help mentor you, the 
Online Resources Web site oﬀ ers a variety of informa-
tion and be sure to take notes in your e-notebook during 
the suspect video statements and at key points through-
out (these notes can be saved, printed or e-mailed). Th e 
Forensics Exercise will test your ability to collect, trans-
port and analyze evidence from the crime scene. You’ll 
even have the opportunity to consider a plea bargain 
oﬀ ered by the defense. At the end of the case, you can 
track how well you responded to each decision point and 
join the Discussion Forum for a postmortem. Go to the 
CD and use the skills you’ve learned in this chapter 
to solve a case.
MEDIA EXPLORATIONS
the victim into the squad car and leave the scene with red 
lights and sirens, heading for the hospital. After leaving 
the victim at the hospital, they return to the scene. Th ey 
ﬁ nd that branches are broken from some of the bushes. 
Th ey also ﬁ nd an article of clothing from the victim and 
a switchblade knife on the ground. Th ey secure the scene 
by posting several of the juveniles around the area until 
further help arrives.
Questions
1. Should red lights and siren have been used in going to 
the scene?
 2. Was it correct for the oﬃ  cers to split up as they did?
 3. Evaluate the eﬀ ectiveness of the oﬃ  cers’ actions after 
arriving at the scene.
1. What myths and prejudices have you heard about 
prosecuting rape cases? Are rape cases more diﬃ  cult 
to prosecute than other crimes?
 2. What are the penalties for rape in your state? Are 
these penalties adequate, or should they be more or 
less severe?
 3. Past rape laws have required the utmost resistance 
by the victim. Present laws have reduced this require-
ment. Do you support this change?
 4. What persons or agencies can assist the police in rape 
investigations? What functions or services can they 
provide? What resources are available in your com-
munity? your state?
 5. Should the rape victim be interviewed by male or 
female investigators?
 6. Rape victims often complain about the attitudes of 
police and medical personnel during a rape investiga-
tion. Do you believe this is justiﬁ ed, or is it due to the 
victim’s emotional stress?
 7. A case in Oregon received wide publicity because a 
husband was charged with raping his wife during 
a temporary separation and was acquitted. Do you 
agree with this verdict? Are there circumstances under 
which such a charge should be supported?
 8. What environment is best for interviewing the vic-
tim of a rape or sexual assault? How would you start 
the interview? How supportive of the victim would 
you be? What questions would you ask? Who would 
you allow to be present? How would you close the 
interview?
 9. How vigorously should sex oﬀ enses such as sodomy, 
indecent exposure and prostitution be investigated?

342 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
hroughout history, children have endured 
physical violence. Infants have been killed 
as a form of birth control, to avoid the dishonor of 
illegitimacy, as a means of power and as a method 
of disposing of retarded or deformed children. In 
ancient Greece, a child was the absolute property of the 
father. Th e father would raise the ﬁ rst son and expose 
subsequent children to the elements. Under Roman 
law, the father had the power of life and death (patria 
potestas) over his children and could kill, mutilate, sell or 
oﬀ er them as a sacriﬁ ce.
During the industrial, urban and machine age, the 
exploitation of child labor was common. Children of 
all ages worked 16 hours a day, usually with irons and 
chains on their ankles to keep them from running away. 
Th ey were starved, beaten and dehumanized, and many 
died from exposure in the workplace, from occupational 
diseases or from suicide.
Karmen (2007, p.190) notes, “For centuries, parents 
were permitted to beat their children as they saw ﬁ t 
in the name of imposing discipline. Legal notions of 
progeny as the property of their parents, as well as 
religious and legal traditions (of “honor thy father 
and mother” and “spare the rod and spoil the child”) 
legitimized parental violence toward youngsters as a 
necessary, even essential, technique of child rearing. 
Only if permanent injury or death resulted were adults 
in danger of being held responsible for going too far, a 
problem labeled cruelty to children.” 
Just as domestic violence used to be considered a 
family matter, so was mistreating children considered 
a family matter. Now both are considered crimes, and 
they must be thoroughly investigated. And like domestic 
violence, crimes against children are underreported. It is 
estimated that for every report of abuse the police and child 
protective services receive, there are 10 unreported cases.
Youths are also victims of the various other crimes 
that occur, but those crimes are usually investigated 
in the same ways as for adult victims, other than some 
changes in interviewing techniques, discussed later in 
this chapter.
Law enforcement agencies are charged with 
investigating all crimes, but their responsibility is 
especially great where crimes against children are involved. 
Children need the protection of the law to a greater degree 
than do other members of society because they are so 
vulnerable, especially if the oﬀ ense is committed by one 
or both parents. Even after the oﬀ ense is committed, the 
child may still be in danger of further victimization.
Crimes against children include maltreatment (neglect 
and abuse), sexual exploitation (pornography and 
prostitution), trafﬁ cking and abduction.
T
MALTREATMENT OF CHILDREN: 
NEGLECT AND ABUSE
Literally, maltreatment  means to treat roughly 
or abuse. Maltreatment exists in many forms 
and along a continuum of severity and chronicity. Deﬁ ni-
tions of the various types of maltreatment vary from state 
to state and even locality to locality, but all are based on 
minimum standards set by federal law. Th e federal Child 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) (42 U.S.C. 
§5106g), as amended by the Keeping Children and Families 
Safe Act of 2003, deﬁ nes child abuse and neglect as
• • Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a par-
ent or caretaker which results in death, serious harm, 
serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or 
exploitation; or
• • An act or failure to act which presents an imminent 
risk of serious harm. 
According to the Oﬃ  ce for Victims of Crime “Crime 
Clock” (2008), one child is reported abused or neglected 
every 35 seconds.
The four common types of maltreatment are 
neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse and 
sexual abuse.
• • Neglect  is the failure to meet a child’s basic needs, 
including housing, food, clothing, education and 
access to medical care.

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 343
• • Physical abuse refers to beating, whipping, burning 
or otherwise inﬂ icting physical harm upon a child. 
Child abuse has been identiﬁ ed as the biggest single 
cause of death of young children. One study found 
that between 3 and 4 million children have at some 
time been kicked, beaten or hit with a ﬁ st by their 
parents, and between 900,000 and 1.8 million have 
been assaulted with a knife or gun. In some tragic 
instances, the abuse results in death.
• • Emotional abuse refers to causing fear or feelings 
of unworthiness in children by such means as locking 
them in closets, ignoring them or constantly belittling 
them.
• • Sexual abuse includes sexually molesting a child, 
performing sexual acts with a child and statutory rape 
and seduction. Sexual assault victims may number in 
the millions, and perhaps some 90 percent of child 
molestations are not reported. Th e reason is unclear. 
Some cultures sanction sexual relationships between 
adults and children, but such acts are illegal in this 
country.
Th ese forms of maltreatment may be found separately 
or in combination. 
State statutes diﬀ er in their deﬁ nitions of minor, 
with the most common specifying under the age of 16 
or 18. When classifying crimes against children, several 
state statutes are applicable, including oﬀ enses of physi-
cal assault, sexual assault, incest, sexual seduction, inde-
cent exposure, lewdness, and molestation. Physical and 
emotional abuse are fairly straightforward. However, 
neglect and sexual abuse are not as clear-cut. 
NEGLECT
Neglect is the most common form of child maltreatment 
and may be fatal.
Often the families from which neglected children come 
are poor and disorganized. Th ey have no set routine for 
family activity. Th e children roam the streets at all hours. 
Th ey are continually referred to juvenile court for loiter-
ing and curfew violations. Th e family unit is often frag-
mented by death, divorce or the incarceration or desertion 
of parents.
Broken homes often deprive children of aﬀ ection, 
recognition and a sense of belonging unless a strong par-
ent can overcome these responses and provide direction. 
If a child’s protective shield is shattered, the child may 
lose respect for moral and ethical standards. Th e broken 
home, in and of itself, does not cause delinquency. But 
it can nullify or even destroy the resources youths need 
to handle emotional problems constructively. Children 
from broken homes may suﬀ er serious damage to their 
personalities. Th ey may develop aggressive attitudes and 
strike out. Th ey may think that punishment is better 
than no recognition. Even when marriages are intact, 
both parents often work. Consequently, many parents 
spend little time in the home interacting with their 
children.
Child neglect often occurs in homes and apartments 
that house methamphetamine labs. Scott and Dedel 
(2006, p.5) report, 
Two children play near their home 
and an open sewer. This poverty-
stricken area in Tunica, Mississippi, is 
sometimes referred to as “Sugarditch.”

344 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
In 2004, President Bush signed the Unborn Victims of 
Violence Act, or Laci and Conner’s Law. Th is law amended 
the U.S. Code and the Uniform Code of Military Justice to 
punish separately the harming of a child in utero. Th e pun-
ishment is the same as provided under federal law for con-
duct causing the injury to, or death of, the unborn child’s 
mother, but the imposition of the death penalty is prohib-
ited. Th is separate oﬀ ense does not require proof that the 
person who committed the oﬀ ense knew or should have 
known that the victim was pregnant or that the accused 
intended to harm the unborn child.
THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM
The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data 
 System (NCANDS) is a federally sponsored 
eﬀ ort that collects and analyzes data on child abuse and 
neglect and prepares an annual report, Child Maltreat-
ment, released each spring. Th e most recent report by the 
Child Welfare Information Gateway (Child Maltreatment, 
) provided the following data:
During federal ﬁ scal year 2006, an estimated 3.3 mil-
lion referrals, involving the alleged maltreatment of 
approximately 6.0 million children, were made to 
child protective services (CPS) agencies. An estimated 
3.6 million children received an investigation or 
assessment.
•  Approximately 60 percent (61.7%) of referrals were 
screened in for investigation or assessment by CPS 
agencies. 
•  Approximately 30 percent of the investigations or 
assessments determined at least one child who was 
found to be a victim of abuse or neglect with the 
following report dispositions: 25.2 percent substan-
tiated, 3.0 percent indicated, and 0.4 percent alter-
native response victim. 
•  More than 70 percent of the investigations or 
assessments determined that the child was not a 
victim of maltreatment with the following disposi-
tions: 60.4 percent unsubstantiated, 5.9 percent 
alternative response nonvictim, 3.2 percent “other,” 
1.7 percent closed with no ﬁ nding, and 0.1 percent 
intentionally false. 
For 2006, more than one-half of all reports (56.3%) 
of alleged child abuse or neglect were made by profes-
sionals. Th e term professional means that the person 
had contact with the alleged child maltreatment 
victim as part of the report source’s job. Th is term 
includes teachers, police oﬃ  cers, lawyers, and social 
services staﬀ . Th e remaining reports were made by 
Many jurisdictions are now ﬁ nding that children are 
commonly exposed to the hazards of clandestine 
methamphetamine labs. Young children frequently 
put their hands in their mouths, have higher meta-
bolic and respiratory rates than adults, and have 
developing central nervous systems, all leaving them 
vulnerable to harm from inhaling, absorbing, or 
ingesting toxins from chemicals. About two-thirds of 
children found at labs seized by police tested positive 
for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. Others 
suﬀ er burns to their lungs or skin from chemicals or 
ﬁ re. Some have died in explosions and ﬁ res. Many are 
badly neglected or abused by parents suﬀ ering from 
drug abuse’s eﬀ ects. . . . When police agencies start 
targeting labs for investigation and seizure, social ser-
vice agencies and family courts should be prepared for 
increased workloads, as well.
Child protective services (CPS) agencies are inundated 
with cases involving removing children endangered by 
chemicals and toxic fumes: “Child neglect cases . . . abound 
in areas where methamphetamine use and production 
exists” (Hunt, 2006, p.26). McGlasson (2006) contends, 
“One of the most sobering aspects about methamphet-
amine-related child endangerment is that its eﬀ ects will 
be felt within the family and by the child for years after-
ward.” In addition to the devastating physical eﬀ ects, 
long-term exposure can cause developmental, learning 
and behavioral disorders as well as a variety of emotional 
and psychological problems (McGlasson).
SEXUAL ABUSE
Sexual seduction means ordinary sexual intercourse, 
anal intercourse, cunnilingus or fellatio committed by a 
nonminor with a consenting minor. Lewdness means 
touching a minor to arouse, appeal to or gratify the per-
petrator’s sexual desires. Th e touching may be done by 
the perpetrator or by the minor under the perpetrator’s 
direction. Molestation is a broader term, referring to any 
act motivated by unnatural or abnormal sexual interest 
in minors that would reasonably be expected to disturb, 
irritate or oﬀ end the victim. Molestation may or may not 
involve touching of the victim.
Legislatures in a number of states are attempting to 
broaden penalties to make them match the severity of the 
oﬀ ense, especially if the victim is very young. Th ere is also 
a concerted eﬀ ort to expand the oﬀ enses to make genders 
equal, recognizing that victims and oﬀ enders may be male 
or female. Th e age of the oﬀ ender as well as the type of 
crime are both taken into account. Illinois, for example, 
has consolidated 9 sex oﬀ enses into 4 but provides for 
24 combinations of charges.

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 345
of a black youth being murdered was four times that 
of a white youth (p.22).
Th ese violent crimes are investigated using the procedures 
described in the preceding chapters, but taking into con-
sideration the age of the victims. 
When the violence is severe enough, death can occur.
Child Fatalities Child fatalities are the most tragic con-
sequence of maltreatment. During 2006, 
• • An estimated 1,530 children died because of child 
abuse or neglect.
• • Th e overall rate of child fatalities was 2.04 deaths per 
100,000 children.
• • More than 40 percent (41.1 percent) of child fatalities 
were attributed to neglect; physical abuse also was a 
major contributor to child fatalities.
• • More than three-quarters (78.0 percent) of the chil-
dren who died because of child abuse and neglect were 
younger than 4 years old.
• • Infant boys (younger than 1 year) had the highest rate 
of fatalities, at 18.5 deaths per 100,000 boys of the 
same age in the national population. 
• • Infant girls had a rate of 14.7 deaths per 100,000 girls 
of the same age. (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 
2006)
Child abuse has been identiﬁ ed as the biggest single 
cause of death of young children. 
According to the Juvenile Oﬀ enders and Victims 2006 
National Report (2006, p.20), the number of juveniles 
murdered in the United States fell 44 percent during 
the 10-year period from 1993 to 2002, to the lowest 
level since the mid-1980s. Child Abuse and Neglect Fatali-
ties: Statistics and Interventions (2008), citing NCANDS 
statistics, reports that the rate of child abuse and 
neglect fatalities during the last several years has var-
ied slightly, beginning with a rate of 1.95 per 100,000 
in 2001, increasing to 1.98 in 2002, 2.00 in 2003 and 
2.03 in 2004, and ﬁ nally decreasing to 1.96 in 2005, the 
overall increase often attributed to improved reporting 
by some states. 
However, many researchers and practitioners believe 
child fatalities are underreported, perhaps by 50 to 60 
percent. Reasons include variation among reporting 
requirements and deﬁ nitions of child abuse and neglect, 
variation in death investigative systems and in training 
for investigators, variation in state child fatality review 
processes and the amount of time it may take to establish 
the cause of death.
 nonprofessionals, including friends, neighbors, sports 
coaches, and relatives.
Th e three most common report sources were teachers 
(16.5%), lawyers or police oﬃ  cers (15.8%), and social 
services staﬀ  (10.0%). 
During 2006, an estimated 905,000 children were 
 determined to be victims of abuse or neglect. Among the 
children conﬁ rmed as victims by CPS agencies in 2006:
•  Children in the age group of birth to 1 year had 
the highest rate of victimization at 24.4 per 1,000 
children of the same age group in the national 
population. 
•  Just over one-half (51.5%) of the child victims were 
girls; and 48.2 percent were boys. 
•  Approximately one-half (48.8%) of all victims were 
White; one-quarter (22.8%) were African-American; 
and 18.4 percent were Hispanic. 
As in prior years, neglect was the most common form 
of child maltreatment. CPS investigations determined 
that:
•  More than 60 percent (64.1%) of victims suﬀ ered 
neglect. 
•  More than 15 percent (16.0%) of the victims suf-
fered physical abuse. 
•  Less than 10 percent (8.8%) of the victims suﬀ ered 
sexual abuse. 
•  Less than 10 percent (6.6%) of the victims suﬀ ered 
from emotional maltreatment. 
Physical and sexual abuse, regardless of the age of the 
 victim, is also classiﬁ ed as violent crime. 
CHILDREN AS VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME
According to Juvenile Oﬀ enders and Victims 2006 National 
Report (2006), of oﬀ enses known to law enforcement,
• • One of every four violent crime victims is a juvenile, 
and most are female (p.331).
• • More than one-third of juvenile victims of violent 
crime are under age 12 (p.32).
• • About two-thirds of violent crimes with juvenile vic-
tims occur in a residence (p.36).
• • Few statutory rapes involve both juvenile victims and 
juvenile oﬀ enders, with the majority of victims being 
females (95 percent), most of whom were ages 14 or 
15. Male oﬀ enders were much older than their female 
victims (p.37).
• • On an average day in 2002, about four juveniles were 
murdered, roughly two white and two black youth. 
Adjusting for the diﬀ erences in their numbers in the 
general population, this means that in 2002 the risk

likely to be arrested as [adults], and 3.1 times more likely 
to be arrested for a violent crime than matched controls.”
Research by Siegel and Williams (2003, p.71) found 
that child sexual abuse was a statistically signiﬁ cant pre-
dictor of certain types of oﬀ enses, but other indicators of 
familial neglect and abuse were signiﬁ cant factors as well: 
“Child sexual abuse may indeed play a central role in some 
girls’ pathway to delinquency and subsequent crime.” 
 Siegel and Williams conclude, “Sexual abuse victims were 
signiﬁ cantly more likely to have been arrested as adults 
than their matched counterparts even after controlling 
for a childhood history characterized by family problems 
serious enough to have resulted in a dependency hearing” 
(p.84). Cohen, Smailes and Brown (2004) report similar 
results, ﬁ nding that victims of oﬃ  cially identiﬁ ed abuse 
were more likely to be arrested as adults.
Research that compared the arrest records of 908 
abused or neglected children, age 11 or younger at the 
time of arrest with the arrest records for 667 children who 
were not abused or maltreated found that “being abused 
or neglected as a child increased the likelihood of arrest 
as a juvenile by 59 percent, as an adult by 26 percent, and 
for a violent crime by 30 percent” (Family Violence, 2006). 
Researchers Teague, Mazerolle, Legosz and Sanderson 
(2008, pp.313–314) obtained similar ﬁ ndings: “Th e results 
reveal that physically abused oﬀ enders reported higher 
rates of violent, property, and total oﬀ ending than non-
abused oﬀ enders.” Teague et al.’s literature review stated 
that child abuse and neglect aﬀ ected a signiﬁ cant propor-
tion of children’s lives, including being more aggressive, 
experiencing more internalizing behavior problems, having 
higher levels of impaired social functioning and having an 
increased risk of mental health problems, teenage preg-
nancy and alcohol and other drug abuse.
Another likely eﬀ ect of child abuse is that as an adult, 
the former victim frequently becomes a perpetrator of child 
abuse, thereby creating a vicious circle sometimes called 
the intergenerational transmission of violence. Research 
shows that a child’s history of physical abuse predisposes 
that child to violence in later years. Victims of neglect are 
also likely to engage in later violent criminal behavior.
RISK FACTORS FOR AND 
CAUSES OF ABUSE AND 
NEGLECT

has identiﬁ ed characteristics of children that 
increase their risk of being abused: premature birth; birth 
THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROBLEM
Experts disagree on just how serious the problem of child 
abuse is. Karmen (2007, p.180) describes two conﬂ icting 
views: the maximalist alarmist and minimalist skeptical 
perspectives. Th e maximalist alarmist perspective contends 
that the problem of child and sexual abuse is reaching epi-
demic proportions: “Dire consequences will follow unless 
drastic steps are taken. . . . Maximalists try to mobilize 
people and resources to combat what they believe is a 
growing crisis.”
Th ese claims have resulted in a predictable opposite 
position, the minimalist skeptical perspective (Karmen, 
2007, p.180): “Minimalists consider maximalist estimates 
to be grossly inﬂ ated for either a well-intentioned reason 
or perhaps for a self-serving purpose.” Th e most heated 
debates concern the actual fate of missing children, the 
true extent of physical child abuse and the true prevalence 
of incest and child molestation.
THE EFFECTS OF CHILD ABUSE 
AND NEGLECT
The eﬀ ects of child abuse and neglect can be 
devastating.
Child abuse and neglect can result in serious and 
permanent physical, mental and emotional damage, 
as well as in future criminal behavior.
Physical damage may involve the brain, vital organs, 
eyes, ears, arms or legs. Severe abuse may also cause men-
tal retardation, restricted language ability, restricted per-
ceptual and motor-skill development, arrested physical 
development, blindness, deafness, loss of limbs or even 
death.
Emotional damage may include impaired self-concept 
as well as increased levels of aggression, anxiety and ten-
dency toward self-destructiveness. Th ese self-destructive 
tendencies can cause children to act out antisocial behav-
ior in the family, the school and the community at large. 
Such self-destructiveness can also manifest itself in risky 
behavior that endangers youths’ health and safety.
English, Spatz and Brandford (2002) tracked 877 
youths for 15 to 24 years following dependency and found 
“strong support” for the relationship between child abuse 
and neglect and delinquency, adult criminality and violent 
criminal behavior: “Abused and neglected children are 4.8 
times more likely to be arrested as juveniles, 2 times more

child to bed without dinner? To address and reduce some 
of this ambiguity, laws regarding child abuse and neglect 
have been passed at both federal and state levels.
Typically child abuse and neglect laws have three 
components: (1) criminal deﬁ nitions and penalties, (2) a 
mandate to report suspected cases and (3) civil process 
for removing the child from the abusive or neglectful 
environment.
FEDERAL LEGISLATION 
In 1974, the federal government passed Public Law (PL) 
93–247, the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treat-
ment Act (CAPTA). It was amended in 1978 under PL 
95–266 and again in 2003 as the Keeping Children and 
Families Safe Act (P.L. 108-36), as mentioned at the 
beginning of the chapter. Th e law states, in part, that any 
of the following elements constitutes a crime: “Th e physi-
cal or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, negli-
gent treatment, or maltreatment of a child under the age 
of 18, by a person who is responsible for the child’s wel-
fare under circumstances that indicate the child’s health 
or welfare is harmed or threatened.” 
Nonetheless, federal courts have also ruled that 
parents are free to strike children because “the custody, 
care and nurture of the child resides ﬁ rst in the parents” 
(Prince v. Massachusetts, 1944). Th is fundamental right 
to “nurture” has been supplanted by the Supreme Court 
with the “care, custody and management” of one’s child 
(Santosky v. Kramer, 1982). Th is shift from “nurture” to 
“management” could herald a return to older laws, such as 
the one expressed in People v. Green (1909): “Th e parent is 
the sole judge of the necessity for the exercise of disciplin-
ary right and of the nature of the correction to be given.” 
Th e court need only determine whether “the punishment 
inﬂ icted went beyond the legitimate exercise of parental 
authority.” 
Current laws often protect parents, and convictions 
for child abuse are diﬃ  cult to obtain because of circum-
stantial evidence, the lack of witnesses, the husband-wife 
privilege and the fact that an adult’s testimony often is 
enough to establish reasonable doubt. All too often, the 
court determines punishment to be reasonable, never 
reexamining the age-old presumption that hitting chil-
dren is permissible.
Th e courts’ role is to decide when and to what degree 
physical punishment steps beyond “the legitimate exer-
cise of parental authority” or what constitutes “excessive 
punishment.” Th e courts always begin with the presump-
tion that parents have a legal right to use force against 
their own children. In Green, 70 marks from a whipping 
of a child to adolescent parents; colic, which makes infants 
diﬃ  cult to soothe; congenital deﬁ ciencies or abnormali-
ties; hospitalization of the newborn resulting in a lack of 
parental contact; and presence of any condition that inter-
feres with parent-child bonding. Further causes of child 
abuse include racial discrimination and the desensitiza-
tion to violence by frequently viewing brutality on televi-
sion and in the movies. Other characteristics that correlate 
to child abuse include low income, social isolation and 
parental expectations that exceed a child’s abilities.
A seesaw model conceptualizes other causes of child 
abuse, illustrating both functional and nonfunctional 
families and two critical factors: stress and resources. In 
the functional family, the resources are available to help 
family members cope with daily stressors, resulting in a 
“balanced” family. In the nonfunctional family, resources 
are insuﬃ  cient to deal with the stresses, and they become 
overpowering. To bring such families into balance, stres-
sors must be removed, or resources to cope with the stres-
sors must be increased—or both.
The two leading causes of child abuse are thought to be 
poverty and violence between husbands and wives.
Parents or caretakers commit most emotional and 
physical child abuse. Th e causes of such abuse often cen-
ter on a cycle of abuse passed from one generation to the 
next. 
THE CYCLE OF ABUSE 
“General delinquency research shows that childhood abuse 
(physical and sexual) is often associated with delinquency 
and that the early onset of maltreatment may increase 
the variety, seriousness and duration of problems. It is 
also widely suggested that violence begets violence—
that today’s abused children become tomorrow’s violent 
oﬀ enders” (Widom and Maxﬁ eld, 2001, p.1). 
Before looking at investigating cases of child mal-
treatment, consider the laws under which investigators 
must operate.
CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT 
LAWS
A complicating factor in investigating child 
abuse is the perceived ambiguity of what it is. 
Is spanking a child abuse? Belittling a child? Sending a

the body of a child.” Other state statutes are much less 
broad. For example, Maryland’s statute states that a 
person is not guilty of child abuse if the defendant’s 
intentions were good, but his or her judgment was bad. 
Th e defendant in Worthen v. State (1979) admitted he 
had punished his 2-year-old stepdaughter because she 
was throwing a temper tantrum, “but sought to explain 
as not having exceeded the bounds of parental propri-
ety.” Th e jury found him guilty of assault and battery 
for the multiple contusions about the girl’s face, ribs, 
buttocks and legs, but the appellate court ordered a new 
trial because the trial court in its jury instructions had 
omitted the defense of good intentions and also the 
defense that the stepfather had not exceeded the bounds 
of parental authority. What is “reasonable” varies from 
state to state, from one judge or court to another and 
from jury to jury.
CASE PROCESSING
Most child abuse and neglect cases enter the 
child welfare system through child protective 
services (CPS) agencies (Juvenile Oﬀ enders and Victims, 
2006, p.47). Child protective services generally refers to ser-
vices provided by an agency authorized to act on behalf of 
a child when parents are unable or unwilling to do so. Th e 
report notes,
Professionals who come into contact with children as 
part of their jobs, such as medical and mental health 
professionals, educators, childcare providers, social 
services providers, law enforcement personnel, and 
clergy are required by law to notify CPS agencies of 
suspicions of child maltreatment. Some states require 
reporting by any person having knowledge of child 
maltreatment.
 
CPS agencies “screen in” most referrals as reports 
to be investigated or assessed. If the intake worker 
determines that the referral does not constitute an 
allegation of abuse or neglect, the case may be closed. If 
there is substantial risk of serious physical or emotional 
harm, severe neglect, or lack of supervision, a child 
may be removed from the home under provisions of 
state law.
CPS may provide protective custody of a child outside 
the home or provide protective supervision of the child 
within the family unit at any point until a case is closed or 
dismissed. Th e speciﬁ c options once a case enters formal 
court processing are the focus. Frequently a formal inves-
tigation is required.
was held to be excessive and unreasonable, even though 
the parent claimed he was not criminally liable because 
there was no permanent injury and he had acted in good 
faith. But the assumption remained that the parent had 
an unquestionable right “to administer such reasonable 
and timely punishment as may be necessary to correct 
growing faults in young children.” 
A determination of “reasonableness” was made in 
Ingraham v. Wright (1977) regarding the use of physical 
punishment of students by teachers, after one student 
was beaten by 20 strokes with a wooden paddle and 
another was beaten by 50 strokes. Th e Florida statute 
speciﬁ ed that the punishment was not to be “degrading 
or unduly severe.” 
In 2000, Congress passed the Child Abuse Preven-
tion and Enforcement Act making more funds available 
for child abuse and neglect enforcement and prevention 
initiatives. In 2006, the Adam Walsh Child Protection 
and Safety Act was signed into law, aimed at tracking sex 
crime oﬀ enders and subjecting them to stiﬀ , mandatory 
minimum sentences. Th e act is named for the 6-year-old 
son of John and Reve Walsh who was abducted and mur-
dered in Florida in 1981 (“Adam Walsh Act Signed into 
Law,” 2006, p.5.) Th e act expands previous sex registry 
requirements, setting forth strict guidelines for states, 
territories and tribal nations to develop and maintain a 
jurisdiction-wide sex oﬀ ender registry. Failure to com-
ply with the guidelines can result in a reduction in the 
amount of federal funds received by a jurisdiction. Th e 
act also established the Oﬃ  ce of Sex Oﬀ ender Sentenc-
ing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering and Track-
ing (the SMART Oﬃ  ce), housed in the Oﬃ  ce of Justice 
Programs at the U.S. Department of Justice. Th is oﬃ  ce is 
responsible for directing the sex oﬀ ender registration and 
notiﬁ cation program, administering grant programs and 
providing technical assistance, coordination and support 
to other entities (“A Closer Look,” 2006, p.3).
STATE LAWS
Since the 1960s, every state has enacted child abuse and 
neglect laws. On the whole, states oﬀ er a bit more protec-
tion to children by statute than does the federal govern-
ment. Legal deﬁ nitions vary from state to state. California, 
for example, declares it illegal for anyone to willfully cause 
or permit any child to suﬀ er or for any person to inﬂ ict 
unjustiﬁ able physical or mental suﬀ ering on a child or to 
cause the child to “be placed in such situations that its 
person or health is endangered” (California Penal Codes, 
Sec. 273A).
Alaska deﬁ nes abuse broadly: “Th e inﬂ iction, by 
other than accidental means, of physical harm upon 

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 349
• • Th e child needs immediate medical or psychiatric care, 
and the parents refuse to get it.
• • Th e parents cannot or will not provide for the child’s 
basic needs.
• • Maltreatment in the home could permanently damage 
the child physically or emotionally.
• • Th e parents may abandon the child.
Consultation with local welfare authorities is some-
times needed before police oﬃ  cials ask the court for a 
hearing to remove a child from the parents’ custody or 
for protective custody in an authorized facility. Because 
police rarely have such facilities, the child should be taken 
to the nearest welfare facility or to a foster home as soon 
as possible, as stipulated by the juvenile court. Th e par-
ents or legal guardians of the child must be notiﬁ ed as 
soon as possible.
THE NEED TO INVOLVE OTHER AGENCIES: THE 
MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM APPROACH
Another challenge facing law enforcement is the need to 
collaborate with various social services, child welfare and 
health agencies to more eﬀ ectively handle child abuse 
cases. Traditionally, law enforcement and social service 
agencies have worked fairly independently on child abuse 
cases, with each conducting its own separate interviews 
and investigations. Many police departments have seen 
no need to collaborate with social services unless their 
investigation determines a need to remove the child from 
parental custody. However, it is increasingly evident that 
this lack of communication and coordination among these 
agencies has led to numerous cases “falling through the 
cracks” of the disjointed system, sometimes with devas-
tating results.
A multidisciplinary team (MDT) consists of profession-
als who work together to ensure an eﬀ ective response to 
reports of child abuse and neglect. Coordinated responses 
can also minimize the likelihood of conﬂ icts between 
agencies with diﬀ erent philosophies and mandates. Joint 
investigations often result in more victim corroborations 
and perpetrator confessions than do independent investi-
gations. In addition, referral agencies provide support and 
assistance to families and victims experiencing child abuse 
or neglect. A collaborative, community-based approach 
to problems associated with children and youths should 
result in identifying, developing and implementing more 
eﬀ ective, multiagency solutions.
A community-involvement program that can assist 
in investigating abused, abandoned or abducted children

CHALLENGES IN INVESTIGATING 
MALTREATMENT CASES
Many prosecutors at all levels of the judiciary 
system perceive crimes against children as 
among the most diﬃ  cult to prosecute and for which to 
obtain convictions. Th erefore, oﬃ  cers interviewing child 
witnesses and victims should have specialized training to 
prosecute the guilty and to protect the innocent. Regard-
less of whether crimes against children are handled by 
generalists or specialists within the department, certain 
challenges are unique to these investigations.
Challenges in investigating crimes against 
children include the need to protect the child 
from further harm, the possibility of parental 
involvement, the need to collaborate with other 
agencies, the difﬁ culty of interviewing children and 
credibility concerns.
PROTECTING THE CHILD
When child abuse is reported, investigators may initiate 
an investigation on their own, or they may investigate 
jointly with the welfare department. Regardless of the 
source of the report and regardless of whether the investi-
gation is a single or joint eﬀ ort, the primary responsibility 
of the investigator assigned to the case is the immediate 
protection of the child.
If the possibility of present or continued danger to 
the child exists, the child must be removed into 
protective custody.
Under welfare regulations and codes, an officer 
may take a child into temporary custody without a 
warrant if there is an emergency or if the officer has 
reason to believe that leaving the child in the present 
 situation would subject the child to further abuse or 
harm.  Temporary custody without hearing usually 
means for 48 hours. Factors that would justify placing 
a child in protective custody include 
• • Th e child’s age or physical or mental condition makes 
the child incapable of self-protection.
• • Th e home’s physical environment poses an immediate 
threat to the child.

350 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
and falsely accused. No other crime is so fraught with 
stigma. Consequently, accusations of this type can be dif-
ﬁ cult to dispel even if false.
Because of the “loaded” nature of child sexual abuse 
allegations, parents who are divorcing may be tempted to 
use such claims as ammunition against their soon-to-be 
ex-spouse. For investigators, sorting through details of 
such allegations to determine their credibility can be 
extremely challenging. Occasionally, the credibility of 
the child victim is challenged. However, investigators 
must approach each case and each victim with an open 
mind.
In most child abuse cases, children tell the truth to the 
best of their ability.
People who work with child abuse cases point out that 
children will frequently lie to get out of trouble, but they 
seldom lie to get into trouble. Although most child abuse 
reports are valid, investigators must use caution to weed 
out those cases reported by a habitual liar or by a child 
who is telling a story to oﬀ set other misdeeds he or she has 
committed. A child’s motivation for lying may be revenge, 
eﬀ orts to avoid school or parental disapproval, eﬀ orts to 
cover up for other disapproved behavior or, in the case 
of sexual abuse, an attempt to explain a pregnancy or to 
obtain an abortion at state expense.
THE INITIAL REPORT
According to the NCANDS, of the 3.3 million 
referrals to CPS agencies, more than one-half 
(56.3 percent) were made by such professionals as educa-
tors, law enforcement and legal personnel, social services 
personnel, medical personnel, mental health personnel, 
child day care providers and foster care providers. Friends, 
neighbors and relatives submitted the rest of the reports.
Most reports of child neglect or abuse are made by third 
parties such as teachers, physicians, neighbors, siblings 
or parents. Seldom does the victim report the offense.
In most states, certain individuals who work with or 
treat children are required by law to report cases of sus-
pected neglect or abuse. Th ese mandated reporters 
include teachers, school authorities, child care personnel, 
camp personnel, clergy, physicians, dentists, chiroprac-
tors, nurses, psychologists, medical assistants, attorneys 
and social workers. Such a report may be made to the 
project, which provides information to law enforcement 
agencies about the identiﬁ cation of children who have 
been ﬁ ngerprinted and are listed in their ﬁ les. Th ese con-
ﬁ dential ﬁ les contain the prints of some 40,000 children. 
Th e prints are submitted by parents, police and sometimes 
civic organizations as a community project.
Other technological developments allow police to 
communicate more eﬀ ectively with organizations such 
as the media in cases involving child abductions—cases 
where speed of information dissemination is critical.
DIFFICULTY IN INTERVIEWING CHILDREN
When children are very young, a limited vocabulary can 
pose a severe challenge to investigators. Unfortunately, 
by the time children are old enough to possess the words 
or other skills needed to communicate and describe their 
abusive experiences, they have also developed the ability 
to feel such shame, embarrassment and fear over these 
events that they might resist talking about them.
Interviewing a child abuse victim takes special under-
standing, skill and practice. Children often have diﬃ  culty 
talking about abuse, and often they have been instructed 
not to tell anyone about it. Th ey may have been threat-
ened by the abuser, or they may have a close relationship 
with the abuser and not want anything bad to happen to 
that person.
When interviewing children, ofﬁ cers should consider the 
child’s age, ability to describe what happened and the 
potential for retaliation by the suspect against a child 
who “tells.”
Another diﬃ  culty in interviewing children is their 
short attention spans. Questions should be brief and 
understandable, a skill that often proves diﬃ  cult and 
requires training and practice. Interviewers who are excel-
lent with adults may not be so successful with children.
Investigators may consider inviting a social  service 
professional to help conduct the interview because they 
often have more formal training and experience in inter-
viewing children at their level and may therefore be 
 better able to establish rapport. More speciﬁ c guidelines 
for interviewing abused children are discussed in detail 
shortly.
CREDIBILITY CONCERNS 
Assessing the credibility of people reporting child abuse 
is a constant challenge for investigators. As repulsive as 
society ﬁ nds child abuse, particularly sexual abuse, inves-
tigators must exercise great care to protect the innocent 

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 351
INTERVIEWING ABUSED CHILDREN
Interviewing children requires special skills. Before the 
interview, obtain relevant background information from 
the parents or guardian and anyone else involved in the 
case, including caseworkers, counselors and physicians. 
Also review the incident report.
Often several interviews are necessary to get a com-
plete statement without overwhelming the child. Th e 
initial interview should be brief, merely to establish the 
facts supporting probable cause, with a second interview 
later.
Generally, it is best to conduct the interview in pri-
vate in the child’s or a friend’s home or in a small room 
at a hospital or the police station. An interview room in 
a police station can be converted into a friendly environ-
ment for youngsters with the addition of some simple 
toys or coloring books. If the interview is to take place at 
the child’s home, it might be best not to wear a uniform, 
especially if the child thinks he or she is to blame. Th e 
uniform could be too intimidating and frighten the child 
into thinking that he or she is going to be arrested. Casual, 
comfortable clothes are usually best.
Regardless of whether the interview is conducted at 
the child’s home or at the police station, it is usually not 
advisable to have a family member present—but if the 
child so desires, the wish should be respected. Th e fam-
ily member should be seated out of the child’s view so 
as not to inﬂ uence the interview. However, if a parent is 
suspected of being the oﬀ ender, neither parent should be 
present. Th e investigator should record the time the inter-
view begins and ends. Because taking written statements 
from children is diﬃ  cult, it is sometimes better to video-
tape the interview. Videotapes may be used by other oﬃ  -
cers, prosecutors and the courts, which eliminates having 
to re-question the victim.
When conducting an interview with a child, investi-
gators must maintain rapport. Th e gender of the inter-
viewer generally does not matter—the ability to elicit 
accurate information is the key quality. Th e interviewer 
should sit next to the child and speak in a friendly voice, 
without talking down to the child. It may help to play a 
game with the child or to get down on the ﬂ oor at the 
child’s level to get attention and to encourage the child to 
talk naturally. Allow the child freedom to do other things 
during the interview, such as moving around the room or 
playing with toys, but do not allow distractions from the 
outside. Learn about the child’s abilities and interests by 
asking questions about everyday activities, such as school 
and household chores. Ask about the child’s siblings, 
pets, friends and favorite games or television shows. It 
may help to share personal information when appropri-
ate, such as about your own children or pets. Evaluate 
welfare department, the juvenile court or the local police 
or sheriﬀ ’s department. It may be made verbally, but it 
should also be put in writing as soon as possible after the 
initial verbal report is made. Some states have special 
forms for child abuse cases. Th ese forms are sent to a cen-
tral location, thereby helping prevent child abusers from 
taking the child to diﬀ erent doctors or hospitals for treat-
ment and thus avoiding the suspicion that would accom-
pany multiple incidents involving the same child.
Child neglect and abuse reports should contain the 
name, age and address of the child victim; the name and 
address of the child’s parents or others responsible for 
the child’s care; the name and address of the person sus-
pected of the abuse; the nature and extent of the neglect 
or abuse; and any evidence of this or previous neglect or 
abuse. Th ese reports are conﬁ dential.
In most states, action must be taken on a report within 
a speciﬁ ed time, frequently 3 days. If in the judgment of 
the person receiving the report it is necessary to remove 
the child from present custody, this is discussed with the 
responsible agency, such as the welfare department or 
the juvenile court. If the situation is deemed life-threat-
ening, the police may temporarily remove the child. No 
matter who receives the report or whether the child must 
be removed from the situation, it is the responsibility of 
the law enforcement agency to investigate the charge.
THE POLICE RESPONSE
As noted, traditionally, as with domestic vio-
lence, child abuse and neglect was viewed as a 
family matter—a social issue regulated by child protec-
tion agencies. It was not a crime. Currently, child abuse is 
viewed as a crime and within the jurisdiction of the crimi-
nal justice system. Th erefore, it needs to be investigated 
by trained criminal investigators.
Th e investigator must talk with people who know the 
child and obtain background information about the child. 
For example, does the child have behavior problems? Is 
the child generally truthful?
If interviews are conducted with the parents, every 
attempt should be made to conduct the interviews in pri-
vate. Explain why the interview is necessary. Be direct, 
honest, understanding and professional. Do not accuse, 
demand, give personal opinions about the situation, request 
information from the parents unrelated to the matter 
under discussion, make judgments, place blame or reveal 
the source of your information. If the parents are suspects, 
provide them the due process rights granted by the Fourth 
and Fifth Amendments, including the Miranda warning.

352 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
It is extremely important not to put words into a 
child’s mouth. When the child answers your questions, be 
certain you understand the meaning of his or her words. 
A child may think “sex” is kissing or hugging or touching. 
If the child uses a word, learn what the word really means 
to the child to get to the truth and avoid later embarrass-
ment in court.
In the case of sexual abuse of young children, it may 
be helpful to use drawings or anatomical dolls to assist 
the children in describing exactly what happened and the 
positions of the child and the abuser when the oﬀ ense 
took place. Controversy exists, however, about whether 
such dolls help or hinder interview progress.
To assess the credibility and competence of children 
in sexual abuse cases, consider the following criteria, cour-
tesy of the Sexual Assault Center, Seattle, Washington:
• • Does the child describe acts or experiences to which a 
child of his or her age would not normally have been 
exposed? Th e average child is not familiar with erec-
tion or ejaculation until adolescence.
• • Does the child describe circumstances and char-
acteristics typical of a sexual assault situation? “He 
told me that it was our secret”; “He said I couldn’t 
go out if I didn’t do it”; “She told me it was sex 
education.”
• • How and under what circumstances did the child tell? 
What were the child’s exact words?
• • How many times has the child given the history, and 
how consistent is it regarding the basic facts of the 
the child’s cognitive level by asking if he or she can read, 
write, count or tell time. Does the child know his or her 
birth date? Can the child recount past events (yesterday, 
holidays)? Does the child know about various body parts 
and their functions? Assess the child’s maturity level by 
asking about his or her responsibilities—making his or 
her own breakfast, walking the dog and so on. Does the 
child enjoy any privileges (staying home alone, going 
places on his or her own)?
Make the child feel comfortable, and keep in mind that 
questioning children is apt to be more of a sharing experi-
ence than a formal interview. Because young children have 
a short attention span, fact-ﬁ nding interviews should last 
no more than 15 or 20 minutes. Questions should pertain 
to what happened, who did it, when it happened, where it 
happened and whether force, threats or enticements were 
involved. Ask simple, direct, open-ended questions. Avoid 
asking “why” questions, because they tend to sound accu-
satory. To alleviate the anxiety, fear or reluctance found 
in children who have been instructed or threatened not to 
tell by the oﬀ ender (especially if a parent), try statements 
such as, “It’s not bad to tell what happened,” “You won’t 
get in trouble,” “You can help your dad/mom/friend by 
telling what happened,” and “It wasn’t your fault.” Never 
threaten or try to force a reluctant child to talk because 
such pressure will likely lead a child to “clam up” and may 
cause further trauma.
To obtain the most thorough and accurate account of 
the abuse possible, investigators should be proﬁ cient in 
cognitive interview techniques, discussed in Chapter 6.

clothes investigator in a child-friendly

the abuse event(s). (© Michael Newman/

with an eye toward the child’s developmental age and a 
compassion for the victim’s reluctance to talk.”
One ﬁ nal note: Exact notes are critical in interviews 
of child sexual abuse victims because such cases are an 
exception to the hearsay rule, meaning an oﬃ  cer may 
testify in court about the victim’s statements. Th erefore, 
oﬃ  cers should be meticulous in recording all statements 
verbatim. Th e child may not be able to repeat the state-
ments because of fear or anxiety. For this reason, as well 
as others mentioned earlier, interviews should be video-
taped whenever possible.
SAMPLE PROTOCOL
Th e following excerpt from the Boulder City (Nevada) 
Police Department’s protocol for investigating reports of 
sexual and physical abuse of children is typical.
It is the policy to team investigate all abuse allegations.
 
When a report comes in, a juvenile oﬃ  cer is imme-
diately assigned all abuse cases. Th is oﬃ  cer is respon-
sible for maintaining a 72-hour time frame. Contact is 
made as soon as possible.
 
Th e investigative process includes the following:
•  Th e investigator contacts Nevada Welfare, and 
together they contact the victim at a location where 
the victim can be interviewed brieﬂ y, and not in the 
presence of the alleged perpetrator of the crime.
•  During the initial interview the juvenile oﬃ  cer tries 
to determine if the report is a substantiated abuse, 
unsubstantiated or unfounded.
•  If the report is substantiated, the juvenile oﬃ  cer or 
Nevada State Welfare removes the child from the 
home and books the child into protective custody. If 
the juvenile oﬃ  cer and Nevada State Welfare inves-
tigator determine the child is not in danger of any 
abuse, the child can be allowed to remain in his/her 
home environment.
assault (times, dates, circumstances, sequence of 
events, etc.)?
• • How much spontaneous information does the child 
provide? How much prompting is required?
• • Can the child deﬁ ne the diﬀ erence between the truth 
and a lie? (Th is question is not actually very useful 
with young children because they learn these terms by 
rote and may not truly understand the concepts.)
During the interview, do not try to extract promises 
from the child regarding testifying in court, because an 
undue emphasis on a trial will have little meaning and 
may frighten the child, causing nightmares and apprehen-
sion. Investigators should avoid asking leading questions, 
repeated interviews and confusing questions.
After the interview is completed, give the parents 
simple, straightforward information about what will hap-
pen next in the criminal justice system and approximately 
when, the likelihood of trial and so on. Enlist their cooper-
ation. Let them know who to contact for status reports or 
in an emergency; express appreciation and understanding 
for the eﬀ orts they are making by reporting and following 
through on the process. Answer any questions the child 
or parents have.
A program called “Finding Words” trains oﬃ  cers in 
conducting child interviews and speciﬁ cally teaches rap-
port, anatomy identiﬁ cation, touch inquiry, abuse sce-
narios and closure protocols (RATAC) (Stevens, 2008, 
pp.31–36). Building rapport is the critical ﬁ rst step in inter-
viewing children. Sitting on the ﬂ oor at eye-level with the 
child is one eﬀ ective means to build rapport. Another way 
with younger children is to draw a picture of their face fol-
lowed by family circles. Information can then be elicited 
about each face in the picture.
Anatomical identiﬁ cation then follows, using anatomi-
cally correct dolls to establish the names a child victim 
uses for various body parts. Investigators must be aware 
that children do not understand things as adults do. 
Good touch, bad touch can be done with the dolls. Begin 
with the good touches: “Tell me about the touches you like. 
Show me where they are.” Next, the child is asked, “Are 
there touches you do not like? Where are they?” Any yes or 
no answer should be followed with “Tell me about that.”
Th e abuse scenario gives trainees a ﬁ ctitious abuse report 
and asks them to construct a plan to interview the victim. 
Stevens (2008, p.35) cautions, “Law enforcement profes-
sionals are trained to avoid leading questions, but according 
to Finding Words, it’s more important to avoid misleading 
or tag questions. For instance, asking, ‘Your dad touched 
your butt, didn’t he?’ is both a statement and a question, 
leading the child to say things he might not mean.”
In ﬁ nding closure, Stevens (2008, p.36) stresses, “Inter-
viewing a child about abuse must be sensitively handled 
Anatomical dolls are sometimes used to diagnose and treat sexual 
abuse victims. The dolls enable victims (generally children) to better 
express thoughts and actions by “acting out” their trauma. These 
adolescent dolls feature a male or female sex organ, breasts, ears, 
mouth, navel, jointed legs, and individual ﬁ ngers. (© Cynthia Harnest,

354 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
children’s injuries heal quickly and home conditions 
can be changed rapidly. Pictures in both color and 
black-and-white should be taken, showing bruises, 
burns, cuts or any injury requiring medical treatment. 
These photographs should be witnessed by people who 
can later testify about the location and extent of the 
injuries, including medical personnel who examined 
the child. Explain the need for the pictures to the child 
to avoid further fear or excitement. All procedures for 
photography at a crime scene (discussed in Chapter 2) 
should be followed.
Additional types of evidence that may be obtained 
in sexual assault cases include photographs, torn cloth-
ing, ropes or tapes and trace evidence such as the hair 
of the offender and the victim and, in some instances, 
semen.
•  If the report is unsubstantiated, the child is left in 
the home.
•  If the report is unfounded, the reason for the 
false report is also investigated to identify other 
problems.
•  If the case is substantiated abuse, the victim 
is housed at Child Haven, and there is a detention 
hearing at 9:00 A.M. the following working day.
 
An in-depth interview is conducted with the 
victim by the juvenile oﬃ  cer and the Nevada State 
Welfare investigator. Several aids are used, depending 
on the child’s age and mental abilities: structured and 
unstructured play therapy, picture drawings, and use of 
 anatomical dolls.
 
Th e juvenile oﬃ  cer also contacts the accused 
 person and interviews him/her about the speciﬁ c 
 allegations, makes a report or statement relevant to the 
interview, and makes these reports available to Nevada 
State Welfare and/or Clark County Juvenile Court. 
Nevada State Welfare is encouraged to attend these 
interviews, and a team approach is used during this 
phase of the investigation also.
 
Th e juvenile oﬃ  cer also interviews other people, 
including witnesses or victims—anyone who might 
have information about the case. Th e oﬃ  cer prepares 
an aﬃ  davit and presents the case to the district 
 attorney’s oﬃ  ce to determine whether the case is 
suitable for prosecution. If so, a complaint is issued, 
and a warrant or summons is issued for the accused. 
Once a warrant is obtained, the investigating oﬃ  cer 
locates and arrests or causes the accused person to be 
arrested.
Investigators must know their own state laws, as well as 
federal statutes and the possibility of dual prosecution. 
EVIDENCE
All the investigator’s observations pertaining to 
the victim’s physical and emotional condition 
must be recorded in detail.
Evidence in child neglect or abuse cases includes the 
surroundings, the home conditions, clothing, bruises or 
other body injuries, the medical examination report and 
other observations.
Photographs may be the best way to document 
child abuse and neglect where it is necessary to show 
injury to the child or the home environment condi-
tions. Pictures should be taken immediately because 
Injuries caused by abuse are best documented through 
photographs. Some of this girl’s injuries will heal quite rapidly; thus, 
the severity of the battering will become less evident over time and 
must be captured as soon after the assault as possible. Note the 
scrapes and bruises on the girl’s hand. Be sure to photograph all 
injuries. (© Hill Creek Pictures/Index Stock Imagery)

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 355
SEXUAL ABUSE INDICATORS
Physical indicators of sexual abuse include diﬃ  culty urinat-
ing and irritation, bruising or tearing around the genital 
or rectal areas. Venereal disease and pregnancy, especially 
in preteens, are also indicators.
Behavioral indicators of sexual abuse may include 
unwillingness to change clothes for or to participate 
in physical education classes; withdrawal, fantasy or 
infantile behavior; bizarre sexual behavior, sexual 
sophistication beyond the child’s age or unusual behav-
ior or knowledge of sex; poor peer relationships; delin-
quency or running away; and reports of being sexually 
assaulted.
Parental indicators may include jealousy and overpro-
tectiveness of a child. Incest incidents are insidious, com-
monly beginning with the parent fondling and caressing 
the child between the ages of 3 and 6 months and then 
progressing over a long period, increasing in intensity of 
contact until the child is capable of full participation, usu-
ally between the ages of 8 and 10. A parent may hesitate 
to report a spouse who is sexually abusing their child for 
fear of destroying the marriage or for fear of retaliation. 
Intrafamily sex may be viewed as preferable to extramari-
tal sex.
THE SUSPECT
A major concern in these types of cases involves 
the frequency with which children are abused 
by people they know. Although many parents stress to 
their children the importance of staying away from strang-
ers, the sad truth is that most sexual abuse is committed 
by persons known to the child. Th e report by the National 
Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information 
(Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2006) states that 
nearly 80 percent of perpetrators in 2006 were parents, 
and another 6.7 percent were other relatives of the 
victim.
Women comprised a larger percentage of all perpetra-
tors than men, 57.9 percent compared with 42.1 percent. 
More than 75 percent (77.5 percent) of all perpetrators 
were younger than age 40. 
• • Of the perpetrators who maltreated children, less 
than 10 percent (7.0 percent) committed sexual abuse, 
while 60.4 percent committed neglect. 
• • Of the perpetrators who were parents, more than 90 
percent (91.5 percent) were the biological parent of 
the victim. 
Indicators of neglect or abuse may be physical or 
 behavioral or both.
Caution: Th e lists of indicators in this section are not 
exhaustive; many other indicators exist. In addition, the 
presence of one or more of these indicators does not prove 
that neglect or abuse exists. All factors and conditions of each 
speciﬁ c case must be considered before you make a decision.
NEGLECT INDICATORS
Th e physical indicators of child neglect may include fre-
quent hunger, poor hygiene, inappropriate dress, consis-
tent lack of supervision (especially in dangerous activities 
or for long periods), unattended physical problems or 
medical needs and abandonment. Such indicators often 
appear in families where the parents are drug addicts. Th e 
behavioral indicators may include begging, stealing (e.g., 
food), extending school days by arriving early or leav-
ing late, constant fatigue, listlessness or falling asleep in 
school, poor performance in school, truancy, alcohol or 
drug abuse, aggressive behavior, delinquency and stating 
that no one is at home to care for them.
EMOTIONAL ABUSE INDICATORS
Physical indicators of emotional abuse may include speech 
disorders, lags in physical development and general fail-
ure to thrive.
Behavioral indicators may include habit disorders 
such as sucking, biting and rocking back and forth and 
conduct disorders such as antisocial, destructive behavior. 
Other possible symptoms are sleep disorders, inhibitions 
in play, obsessions, compulsions, phobias, hypochondria, 
behavioral extremes and attempted suicide.
PHYSICAL ABUSE INDICATORS
Physical indicators of physical abuse include unexplained 
bruises or welts, burns, fractures, lacerations and abra-
sions. Th ese may be in various stages of healing. One obvi-
ous and important indicator of physical abuse is bruising.
Behavioral indicators include being wary of adults, 
being apprehensive when other children cry, extreme 
aggressiveness or extreme withdrawal, being frightened 
of parents and being afraid to go home.
Parental indicators may include contradictory explana-
tions for a child’s injury; attempts to conceal a child’s injury 
or to protect the identity of the person responsible; routine 
use of harsh, unreasonable discipline inappropriate to the 
child’s age or transgressions and poor impulse control.

356 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
when the investigation becomes known to the parent. 
MSBP should be considered as a possible motive in any 
questionable or unexplained death of a child.
Investigators assigned to work child abuse cases 
should investigate cases of MSBP as they do similar cases 
of abuse. In general, however, when confronted with pos-
sible cases of MSBP, investigators should
• • Review the victim’s medical records.
• • Determine from contact with medical personnel the 
reporting parent’s concerns and reactions to the 
child’s medical treatment.
• • Compile a complete family history.
• • Interview family members, neighbors and babysitters.
• • Consider using video surveillance in the hospital.
• • Use a search warrant for the family’s residence when 
collecting evidence.
People who have normal behavior patterns in all other 
areas of life may have very abnormal sexual behavior pat-
terns. Child sexual abusers may commit only one oﬀ ense 
in their lifetime, or they may commit hundreds. Surveys 
indicate that 35 to 50 percent of oﬀ enders know their vic-
tims. Some studies indicate an even higher percentage. 
Th erefore, the investigator of a child sexual crime may not 
be looking for an unknown suspect or stranger.
THE PARENT AS SUSPECT
Sexual abuse of one or more children in a family is one of 
the most common child sexual abuse problems, but it is 
not often reported. Because of the diﬃ  culties in detecting 
it, it is the least known to the public. Th e harm to the child 
from continued, close sexual relationships with a fam-
ily member may be accompanied by shame, fear or even 
guilt. Additional conﬂ ict may be created by admonitions 
of secrecy.
Although girls are more frequently victims, if a girl is 
sexually abused by a family member, a boy in the same 
family may also be a victim. Incest usually involves chil-
dren under age 11 and becomes a repeated activity, esca-
lating both in severity and frequency.
Courts have ruled that the spousal immunity rules do 
not apply to child sexual abuse cases. One spouse may be 
forced to testify against the other in court.
Investigators must be aware of unusual situations 
involving psychiatric or medical conditions that may lead 
to injuries in children and, consequently, cast suspicion 
on parents or caregivers as having been abusive.
Munchausen Syndrome and Munchausen Syndrome 
by Proxy Munchausen syndrome involves self-
induced or self-inﬂ icted injuries. If a child’s injuries appear 
to be self-induced or self-inﬂ icted, the child may be seek-
ing attention or sympathy or may be avoiding something. 
Parents—usually the mother—may inﬂ ict injuries on their 
children for basically the same reasons. Munchausen 
syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a form of child abuse in 
which a parent or adult caregiver deliberately provides 
false medical histories, manufactures evidence and causes 
medical distress in a child. MSBP is usually done so the 
child will be treated by a physician and the abuser may gain 
the attention or sympathy of family, friends and others.
MSBP allegations frequently come from an anony-
mous source or a health-care professional. An unknown 
percentage of the anonymous calls come from health-
care professionals concerned with liability issues. One of 
the most logical ﬁ rst steps is to contact the primary-care 
physician. Early contact should be made with a child care 
agency to coordinate issues regarding the child’s safety 
At her Coral Springs, Florida, home, Jennifer Bush applies medicine 
from a syringe as treatment for a rare disease. She has been 
hospitalized more than 200 times, undergone 40 operations, and 
accumulated $3 million in medical expenses. Jennifer has been 
placed under state care and her mother jailed for allegedly causing 
her illnesses as a result of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare 
form of child abuse in which an adult intentionally makes a child ill 
to get attention. (AP/Wide World Photos)

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 357
determine whether the suspected abuse case is actually 
OI? First, a medical professional experienced in diagnos-
ing OI should evaluate the child. Genetic counseling may 
also reveal a previously unrecognized family history of 
mild OI. Investigators should also look for inconsisten-
cies between the explanation for the injury given by the 
child or parent and the diagnosis provided by the treat-
ing physicians and other medical personnel. Parents may 
also try to conceal child abuse by frequently changing doc-
tors or hospitals, thus avoiding a buildup of incriminating 
records at any one oﬃ  ce or facility. Keep in mind also that 
the presence of OI does not automatically preclude the 
existence of child abuse.
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome  Another tragic con-
dition that takes the lives of young victims and for which 
parents may become suspected of child abuse is sudden 
infant death syndrome (SIDS), brieﬂ y introduced in 
Chapter 8.
SIDS is a diagnosis by exclusion and is the most fre-
quently determined cause of sudden unexplained infant 
death (SUID). Because examination of the death scene is 
a critical factor in determining SIDS, oﬃ  cers responding 
to a call of an “infant not breathing” must observe several 
elements, including the infant’s position when found, the 
condition of the crib and surrounding area, the presence 
of objects in the crib, any unusual or dangerous items in 
the room, any medications being given to the baby, room 
temperature and air quality. Recent studies by British 
and Australian researchers suggest two common bacte-
ria might also play a role in SIDS, a discovery that may 
inﬂ uence what additional tests are conducted during the 
autopsies of these young victims. 
Oﬃ  cers may also observe certain bodily appearances 
in the victim that typically occur in SIDS cases resulting 
from the death process, including discoloration of the 
skin, frothy drainage from the mouth or nose and cooling 
rigor mortis that takes place quickly, usually in about 3 
hours in infants.
Table 11.1 compares the characteristic features of 
SIDS with child abuse, and Table 11.2 (see p. 359) sum-
marizes the characteristics of MSBP, OI, and SIDS.
Investigating Child Fatalities Investigating the death 
of a child can be one of the most diﬃ  cult tasks an inves-
tigator ever encounters. Tough questions must be asked 
to grieving parents or caregivers so the investigator may 
determine whether the fatality resulted from an unknown 
medical condition, an accident or a criminal act. Many child 
fatalities are ﬁ rst reported as natural deaths or accidents 
(Walsh, 2005, p.25). Th e following checklists of poten-
tial witnesses and other information sources will assist 
Oﬀ enders often have a medical background or have been 
around the medical profession in some way.
Whereas MSBP is a disorder that clearly results in a 
form of child abuse, another disorder whose symptoms 
closely resemble child abuse and for which parents are often 
mistakenly accused of abuse, is osteogenesis imperfecta.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta 
(OI), or brittle bone disease, is a genetic disorder char-
acterized by bones that break easily, often from little or 
no apparent cause. However, child abuse may also result 
in broken bones. Consequently, improper diagnosis of OI 
can lead to the parents of children with the disease being 
wrongly accused of child abuse. Th e U.S. Osteogenesis 
Imperfecta Foundation (OIF) states, “A minor accident 
may result in a fracture; some fractures may occur while a 
child is being diapered, lifted, or dressed.” Th e most rou-
tine child care activities, performed by the most careful 
and loving parents, can easily and spontaneously break 
the bones of a child with OI and, in some severe cases, the 
condition may be lethal. Th e OIF reports, “False accusa-
tions of child abuse may occur in families with children 
who have milder forms of OI and/or in whom OI has 
not previously been diagnosed. Types of fractures that 
are typically observed in both child abuse and OI include 
fractures in multiple stages of healing, rib fractures, spi-
ral fractures and fractures for which there is no adequate 
explanation of trauma.”
During the 1940s, advances in diagnostic X-ray tech-
nology allowed physicians to detect patterns of healed 
fractures in their young patients. In 1946, Dr. John 
Caﬀ ey, a pediatric radiologist, suggested that multiple 
fractures in the long bones of infants had “traumatic ori-
gin,” perhaps willfully inﬂ icted by parents. Two decades 
later, Dr. C. H. Kempe and his associates coined the 
phrase battered child syndrome based on clinical evidence 
of maltreatment: “In the typical case, the victim was 
younger than 3 years old and suﬀ ered traumatic injuries 
to the head and to limbs; and the caretakers claimed that 
the wounds were caused by an accident and not a beat-
ing” (Karmen, 2007, p.190). In 1964, individual states 
began enacting mandatory child abuse laws using Dr. 
Kempe’s deﬁ nition of a battered child, and by 1966, all 
50 states had enacted such legislation.
Th e similarities between OI and child abuse symp-
toms can easily confuse investigators and anger parents 
wrongly accused of abuse. For example, in addition to 
displaying diﬀ erent types of fractures in various stages of 
healing, a child with OI often bruises easily. Furthermore, 
many children with OI are of shorter stature than average, 
a condition often mistaken as indicative of neglect (OIF).
When these symptoms are detected, how do investigators 

358 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
If the child’s family or suspect has previously lived in 
another community, check there for potential witnesses 
and other agency records that may document a history of 
abuse or neglect.
Walsh (2005, p.25) provides the following tips and 
reminders for investigators working possible child fatal-
ity cases:
• • An unreasonable delay in seeking medical attention 
is often a “red ﬂ ag” that the child’s injuries may have 
been caused by abuse.
• • 911 call records often contain important information 
about how a child’s injuries were initially reported.
• • Treat cases involving severe injury as potential child 
fatalities because it is not uncommon for severely injured 
children to die days or weeks after the original injury.
• • Delayed deaths often involve more than one crime 
scene. Examine the place where the injury occurred, 
the hospital where the child died and any private 
vehicle used to transport the child to the hospital.
• • Th ere is no substitute for a timely, professional crime-
scene search, including evidence collection, documen-
tation and photo-documentation.
• • Coordinate and communicate with CPS investigators 
in child fatality cases. Th ey have a legitimate role in 
the investigation and can often provide important 
information about the child and family involved.
Successful child fatality investigations hinge on three 
factors: eﬀ ectively conducted, well-documented inter-
views of witnesses; thorough background checks on every 
witness and suspect involved in the case; and competent 
interrogation of the suspect(s) (Walsh, 2005, p.25). A ﬁ nal 
word of caution: Do not automatically exclude children as 
potential suspects. Children have been known to inﬂ ict 
severe injuries on other children.

people. Th e pedophile frequently selects children who 
stand apart from other children, who are runaways or 
who crave attention and love. Although some pedophiles 
are child rapists, most rarely use force, relying instead 
on befriending the victims and gaining their conﬁ dence 
and friendship. Pedophiles may become involved in 
activities or programs that interest the type of victims 
they want to attract and that provide them with easy 
access to these children. Pedophiles may also use drugs 
or alcohol as a means of seduction, reducing the child’s 
inhibitions.
Pedophiles may obtain, collect and maintain photo-
graphs of the children with whom they are or have been 
involved. Many pedophiles maintain diaries of their 
sexual encounters with children. Pedophiles may collect 
books, magazines, newspapers and other writings on 
the subject of sexual activities with children. Th ey may 
also collect addresses, phone numbers or lists of people 
who have similar sexual interests. Pedophiles also locate 
and attract victims through the computer, as discussed 
shortly. In addition, many pedophiles are members of 
sex rings.
CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE RINGS
Adults (at least 10 to 15 years older than the victims) are 
usually the dominant leaders, organizers and operators 
of sex rings. Th e adult leader selectively gathers young 
people together for sexual purposes. Th e involvement 
varies, with the longest periods occurring when prepu-
bescent children are involved. Most cases involve male 
ringleaders, but some involve a female as well, usually a 
husband-wife pair.
Many ringleaders use their occupation as the major 
access route to the child victims. Th e adult has a legiti-
mate role as an authority ﬁ gure in the lives of the children 
SEX CRIMES BY OTHER CHILDREN
Although seldom discussed, an increasing number of child 
sex crimes are being committed by other children. Many 
people think such crimes cannot occur because they often 
view children as not being sexually capable. Some child 
sex abusers were molested themselves. When investiga-
tors receive reports of children committing sex crimes 
against other children, they must not automatically dis-
miss them as fantasy and must thoroughly investigate all 
such reports.
THE NONPARENT SUSPECT
Perpetrators other than parents have included babysit-
ters, camp counselors, school personnel, clergy and 
others. Habitual child sex abusers, whether they operate as 
loners or as part of a sex ring, have been classiﬁ ed into three 
types. First is the misoped, the person who hates children, 
has sex with them and then brutally destroys them. Th e 
second type is the hebephile, a person who selects high 
school–age youths as his or her sex victims. Th e third and 
most common habitual child sex abuser is the pedophile, 
sometimes referred to as a chicken hawk, an adult who has 
either heterosexual or homosexual preferences for young 
boys or girls of a speciﬁ c, limited age range. Although pedo-
philes are typically male, this is not always the case. Women 
are also involved in the sexual abuse of children. 
THE PEDOPHILE
Pedophilia is a sex oﬀ ense in all states. Rarely 
deviating from the preferred age range, the 
pedophile is an expert in selecting and enticing young

sexual abuse, they become a problem for law enforcement. 
Crimes associated with cults are discussed in Chapter 19. 
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, allegations of 
ritualistic abuse by satanic cults caused much controversy. 
As Karmen (2007, pp.201–202) explains,
Th e maximalist position was that thousands of people 
disappeared each year because they were dispatched by 
secret cults. Believers in the existence of a satanic con-
spiracy circulated frightening accounts about bizarre 
“wedding” ceremonies in which covens of witches and 
devil worshipers chanted, wore costumes, took drugs, 
sacriﬁ ced animals, and even mutilated, tortured, and 
murdered newborn infants or kidnapped children. . . . 
Th e people who came forward and said that they sur-
vived ritual abuse were often young women who made 
these claims after undergoing psychotherapy.
 
Th e minimalist position pointed out that the scare 
developed after bizarre charges about teachers practic-
ing witchcraft at a California preschool generated one 
of the longest and costliest trials in American history 
(but no convictions). . . .Th e minimalist view attributed 
the panic to sensationalism by the tabloid press and 
irresponsible talk shows that fed a climate of rumors 
and fears. . . . Although many people claimed to have 
witnessed, participated in and survived these devilish 
activities, minimalist skeptics conclude that the cred-
ibility of these individuals was just as questionable as 
the truthfulness of hundreds of people who swore they 
had been abducted by aliens from outer space or who 
said they remembered events from their “past lives” as 
diﬀ erent people.
VICTIMOLOGY
People involved in intervening, investigating or pros-
ecuting child pornography and sex ring cases must rec-
ognize that a bond often develops between the oﬀ ender 
and the victims. Many victims ﬁ nd themselves willing 
to trade sex for attention, aﬀ ection and other beneﬁ ts. 
Pedophile ring operators are, by deﬁ nition, skilled at 
gaining the continued cooperation and control of their 
victims through well-planned seduction. Th ese opera-
tors are skilled at recognizing and then temporarily ﬁ lling 
the emotional and physical needs of children. Th ey know 
how to listen to children—an ability many parents lack. 
Th ey are willing to spend all the time it takes to seduce 
a child.
Th is positive oﬀ ender-victim bond must not be mis-
interpreted as consent, complicity or guilt. In one case, 
a prosecutor announced to television reporters that the 
victims were as guilty as—if not more guilty than—the 
oﬀ enders. Police investigators, in particular, must be sen-
sitive to this problem.
selected for the ring or is able to survey vulnerable chil-
dren through access to family records or history.
Sometimes rings are formed by an adult targeting a 
speciﬁ c child, who then uses his or her associations and 
peer pressure to bring other children into the group. Th e 
initial child may be a relative or previously unknown. One 
common technique is to post a notice on a store bulletin 
board requesting girls to help with housework.
Th e adult’s status in the neighborhood sometimes 
helps legitimize his or her presence with the children and 
their parents and permits unquestioned movement of 
young people into the oﬀ ender’s home. Such an oﬀ ender 
often is well liked by his neighbors.
Investigators should be aware of three types of sex rings: 
solo, transition and syndicated. Certain cults are also 
involved in the sexual abuse of children.
Solo Sex Rings Th e organization of solo sex rings is pri-
marily by the age of the child—for example, toddlers (ages 
2 to 5), prepubescent (6 to 12) or pubescent (13 to 17). 
Th is type of oﬀ ender prefers to have multiple children 
as sex objects, in contrast to the oﬀ ender who seeks one 
child at a time.
Transition Sex Rings Pedophiles have a strong need to 
communicate with others about their interest in children. 
In transition sex rings, experiences are exchanged, whereas 
in solo rings, the pedophile keeps his or her activities and 
photographs totally secret. In transition rings, photo-
graphs of children as well as sexual services may be traded 
and sold.
Th e trading of pornography appears to be the ﬁ rst 
move of the victim into the “possession” of other pedo-
philes. Th e photographs are traded, and victims may be 
tested by other oﬀ enders and eventually traded for their 
sexual services.
Syndicated Sex Rings Th e third type of ring is the 
syndicated sex ring, a well-structured organization that 
recruits children, produces pornography, delivers direct 
sexual services and establishes an extensive network of 
customers. Syndicated rings have involved a Boy Scout 
troop, a boys’ farm operated by a minister and a national 
boy prostitution ring.
RITUALISTIC ABUSE BY SATANIC CULTS
Cults are groups that use rituals or ceremonial acts to 
draw their members together into a certain belief system. 
When the rituals of a group involve crimes, including child 

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 361
At the federal level, child abuse statutes pertain mainly to 
exploitation, but they also set forth important deﬁ nitions 
that apply to any type of child abuse. Public Law 95–225 
(1978) deﬁ nes sexual exploitation as follows: “Any per-
son who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or 
coerces any minor to engage or assist in engaging in any 
sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any 
visual or print medium, knowing that such visual or print 
medium will be transported interstate or in foreign com-
merce or mailed, is guilty of sexual exploitation. Further, 
any parent or legal guardian who knowingly permits such 
conduct, having control and custody of the child, is also 
subject to prosecution.”
Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) 
is “sexual abuse of a minor for economic gain. It involves 
physical abuse, pornography, prostitution, and the smug-
gling of children for unlawful purposes” (Albanese, 2007, 
p.1). Th e Justice Department reports that this type of 
crime is increasing at an alarming rate, with the number 
of federal cases nearly quadrupling between 1996 and 
2006 (“Federal Child Exploitation Cases,” 2008, p.6).
PORNOGRAPHY
According to the Child Protection Act of 1984, child 
pornography is highly developed into an organized, 
multimillion-dollar industry producing and distributing 
pornographic materials nationally, exploiting thousands 
of children, including runaways and homeless youths. It 
states that such exploitation is harmful to the physiologi-
cal, emotional and mental health of the individual and to 
society. Many states have passed similarly worded stat-
utes and have increased penalties for sexual abuse and 
the production and distribution of child-pornographic 
materials. 
The Child Protection Act (1984) prohibits child pornogra-
phy and greatly increases the penalties for adults who 
engage in it.
Although adult pornography has always been objec-
tionable to many people, it has not resulted in the aggres-
sive public and legislative action that child pornography 
has received. In 1977, Congress passed the Protection of 
Children against Sexual Exploitation Act. Th is and other 
federal and state laws have prohibited commercial and 
noncommercial distribution of pornographic materials 
and more recently have made it a violation of law to 
possess such materials. 
Th e basis for these laws has been the acceptance of 
a relationship between child-pornographic materials and 
child sexual abuse oﬀ enders and oﬀ enses. In many cases, 
OFFENDER REACTIONS
When a child pornography and sex ring is discovered, cer-
tain reactions by the pedophile oﬀ enders are fairly pre-
dictable. Th e intensity of these reactions may depend on 
how much the oﬀ enders have to lose by their identiﬁ ca-
tion and conviction.
Usually a pedophile’s ﬁ rst reaction to discovery is com-
plete denial. Th e oﬀ enders may act shocked, surprised or 
even indignant about an allegation of sexual activity with 
children. Th is denial frequently is aided by their friends, 
neighbors, relatives and coworkers, who insist that such 
upstanding people could not have done what is alleged.
If the evidence rules out total denial, oﬀ enders may 
switch to a slightly diﬀ erent tactic, attempting to minimize 
what they have done in both quantity and quality. Pedo-
philes are often knowledgeable about the law and might 
admit to acts that are lesser oﬀ enses or misdemeanors.
Either as part of the eﬀ ort to minimize or as a sepa-
rate reaction, pedophiles typically attempt to justify their 
behavior. Th ey might claim that they care for these chil-
dren more than their parents do and that what the pedo-
philes do is beneﬁ cial to the children. Th ey may claim to 
have been under tremendous stress, to have a drinking 
problem or not to have known how young a certain victim 
was. Th e eﬀ orts to justify their behavior often center on 
blaming the victim. Oﬀ enders may claim that they were 
seduced by the victims, that the victims initiated the sex-
ual activity or that the victims were promiscuous or even 
prostitutes. When various reactions do not result in ter-
mination of the investigation or prosecution, pedophiles 
may claim to be sick and unable to control themselves.
Pedophiles’ reactions to being discovered usually begin 
with complete denial and then progress to minimizing 
the acts, justifying the acts and blaming the victims. If all 
else fails, they may claim to be sick. 
Pedophiles are commonly involved in child pornogra-
phy, either as a “hobby” or for commercial gain, although 
they are not the only individuals who participate in such 
child exploitation.
COMMERCIAL SEXUAL 
EXPLOITATION
Exploitation refers to taking unfair advantage 
of children or using them illegally. Th is 
includes using children in pornography and prostitution. 

362 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
Internet, Senator Biden (D-DE) contends, “Th e bottom 
line is that the Internet has facilitated an exploding, multi-
billion dollar market for child pornography, with 20,000 
new images posted every week. Th is is a market that can 
only be supplied by the continued sexual assault and exploi-
tation of more children, and the research shows that vic-
tims are getting younger and younger and they are being 
exposed to sadistic abuse” (“Internet Child Pornography 
Targeted,” 2007, p.7). 
In addition to child pornography, the Internet facili-
tates child sexual abuse in other ways (Wortley and Small-
bone, 2006, p.21). It may be used to
• • Allow networking among child abuse perpetrators.
• • Seek and groom victims.
• • Cyberstalk.
• • Promote child sexual tourism.
• • Traﬃ  c children.
Th e challenge of controlling sexual abuse of children 
via the Internet rests on multiple factors, including the 
structure of the Internet (a decentralized network of net-
works), volume of Internet activity, expertise of oﬀ enders, 
uncertainties regarding jurisdiction, lack of regulation and 
diﬀ erences in legislation (Wortley and Smallbone, 2006, 
pp.26–27). An additional challenge to investigators lies 
in the nontraditional skills often required to sift through 
the technical evidence involved in cybercrimes, including 
the need to identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address and 
where it is located. IP tracing technologies can provide 
valuable tools to identify the source of Internet commu-
nications. Helpful clues to the location of a suspect can 
be found by analyzing e-mail header information, which 
reveals the IP address of the system the e-mail came from. 
Once the IP address is obtained, investigators can easily 
identify the location with an IP tracing tool. Investigating 
cybercrime and other crimes that use the computer is the 
topic of Chapter 17.
Th e Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punish-
ment Act, passed in 1998, imposes tougher penalties for 
sex crimes against children, particularly those facilitated 
by the use of the Internet. Th e act prohibits contacting 
a minor via the Internet to engage in illegal sexual activ-
ity and punishes those who knowingly send obscenity to 
children.
Several initiatives are aimed at protecting children 
in cyberspace. Th e Oﬃ  ce of Juvenile Justice and Delin-
quency Prevention (OJJDP) of the U.S. Department of 
Justice funds the Internet Crimes against Children (ICAC) 
Task Force, which seeks to protect children online. Th is 
program helps state and local law enforcement agencies 
develop eﬀ ective responses to online enticement and 
arrested pedophiles have had in their possession child-
pornographic literature used to lower their selected vic-
tims’ inhibitions. It is often necessary to obtain search 
warrants for the suspect’s premises to obtain these mate-
rials. It is necessary in the investigation to gain as much 
evidence as possible, because the problems of child testi-
mony in court are well established. 
INTERNET SEX CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN
Advances in computer technology and the expansion of 
the Internet have created an entirely new global forum 
in which sex oﬀ enders can access potential victims and 
distribute or trade child pornography: “Th e Internet 
provides a child predator with access to children on a 
scale that makes the world his local playground. It is a 
medium through which digital images and movies docu-
menting the most horriﬁ c crimes against children are 
distributed to a worldwide audience” (Geraghty, 2007, 
p.30). All of the services the Internet provides—e-mail, 
the World Wide Web, instant messaging—can be used 
to facilitate crimes against children. Collins (2007, p.40) 
provides examples of how this occurs:
A fourth-grade student was frequently pulled out of 
lunch by her teacher, who sexually abused her in the 
class coatroom and took explicit photographs to memo-
rialize the moment. He demanded her silence by threat-
ening to ﬂ unk her and post the pictures on the Internet 
if she told anyone. Another child, a prepubescent boy, 
was violently sexually assaulted for several years by a 
man who acted as his live-in babysitter. While the boy 
never disclosed his abuse to anyone, thousands of pho-
tographs depicting his horriﬁ c abuse were circulated 
around the globe. In another location, a man with no 
previous criminal record ﬁ lmed himself sodomizing 
his 10-month-old granddaughter. He did not need to 
convince the child to keep the secret; in fact, he said he 
selected that particular victim because she was preverbal.
Internet sex crimes against minors can be categorized 
in three mutually exclusive groups: (1) Internet crimes 
against identiﬁ ed victims involving Internet-related sex-
ual assaults and other sex crimes, such as the production of 
child pornography committed against identiﬁ ed victims; 
(2) Internet solicitations unknowingly to undercover law 
enforcement oﬃ  cers posing as minors that involved no 
identiﬁ ed victims; and (3) the possession, distribution or 
trading of Internet child pornography by oﬀ enders who 
did not use the Internet to sexually exploit identiﬁ ed vic-
tims or unknowingly solicit undercover investigators. Fig-
ure 11.1 illustrates the categories.
Noting law enforcement’s awareness of more than 
400,000 people traﬃ  cking in child pornography on the 

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 363
arrests have been made in the past 7 years. In addition, 
the FBI made 1,648 arrests in 2005 as part of its Innocent 
Images National Initiative. 
MODELS TO COMBAT CHILD SEXUAL 
EXPLOITATION
Three law enforcement approaches have emerged as 
models to combat child sexual exploitation: special task 
forces, strike forces and law enforcement networks.
Special task forces are useful in jurisdictions with a 
steady load of child sexual exploitation cases. In addi-
tion to a steady caseload, the model includes a centralized 
child pornography cases, including community education, 
forensic, investigative and victim service components. 
Th e National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 
(NCMEC) has a congressionally mandated Cyberline, a 
reporting mechanism for child sexual exploitation. It 
has handled more than 440,000 leads and serves as the 
national clearinghouse for child pornography cases across 
the country (Collins, 2007, p.40).
Project Safe Childhood (PSC) was designed and spon-
sored by the U.S. Department of Justice to empower fed-
eral, state and local law enforcement oﬃ  cers with tools 
needed to investigate cybercrimes against children. Forty-
six federally funded ICAC task forces, consisting of more 
than 1,000 aﬃ  liated state and local organizations, have 
been created across the country since 1998 (McNulty, 
2007, p.36). As a result of task force investigations, 7,328

364 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
The Innocent Images National Initiative Th e Inno-
cent Images National Initiative (IINI), part of the FBI’s 
Cyber Crimes Program, is an “intelligence driven, proac-
tive, multi-agency investigative initiative to combat the 
proliferation of child pornography/child sexual exploita-
tion (CP/CSE) facilitated by an online computer” (Inno-
cent Images, 2007). Th e program provides a coordinated 
FBI response to this nationwide problem by collating and 
analyzing information and images obtained from numer-
ous sources, avoiding duplication of eﬀ ort by all FBI ﬁ eld 
oﬃ  ces. Between ﬁ scal years 1996 and 2007, this initiative 
accomplished the following: 
• • 20,134 cases opened (2062 percent increase—from 
113 in 1996 to 2,433 in 2007) 
• • 6,844 informations/indictments (1003 percent 
increase—from 99 in 1996 to 1,092 in 2007)
• • 9,469 arrests/locates/summons (2501 percent 
increase—from 68 in 1996 to 1,023 in 2007)
• • 6,863 convictions/pretrial diversions (1404 percent 
increase—from 68 in 1996 to 1,023 in 2007) 
IINI undercover operations are being conducted in 
several FBI ﬁ eld oﬃ  ces by task forces that combine the 
resources of the FBI with other federal, state and local law 
enforcement agencies. International investigations are 
coordinated through the FBI’s Legal Attaché program as 
well as with the ICAC task forces, discussed next. FBI agents 
and task force oﬃ  cers go online undercover into predi-
cated locations using ﬁ ctitious screen names and engage in 
real-time chat or e-mail conversations to obtain evidence 
location, a standing team of experts, specialized staﬃ  ng, 
victim services and a multijurisdictional (federal, state, 
local) approach. In a strike force model, no core is dedi-
cated exclusively to the problem. Rather, team members 
come together from individual agencies in response to a 
particular case. Under a law enforcement network model, 
law enforcement oﬃ  cers, prosecutors, victims’ services 
providers, social service agents and others come together 
proactively to focus on education, recruitment, building 
resources and establishing personal contacts. Th is model 
has no dedicated resources and, over time, may evolve 
into a task force or strike force if needed. 
FEDERAL AGENCIES WORKING AGAINST CHILD 
PORNOGRAPHY
Several federal agencies are involved in combating child 
pornography. Th e FBI’s Crimes against Children (CAC) 
unit provides quick, eﬀ ective responses to all incidents of 
sexual exploitation of children.
Th e U.S. Customs Service targets the illegal importa-
tion and traﬃ  cking of child pornography and ﬁ ghts child 
sex tourism. Th e Customs CyberSmuggling Center (C3) is 
a front line of defense against smuggling over continental 
borders as well as through the Internet.
Th e U.S. Postal Inspection Service is responsible for 
investigating crimes involving the U.S. mails, includ-
ing child pornography and child sexual abuse oﬀ enses. 
It is the lead agency in the federal government’s eﬀ orts 
to eliminate the production and distribution of such 
material.
Pedophiles lurk in cyberspace, waiting 
to lure unsuspecting children into 
ongoing online “friendships” and hoping 
to persuade the child to eventually meet

or intangibles such as approval or care. It is an age old 
and global problem that has existed for centuries” (Child 
Prostitution, 2008).
Th e prostitution of juveniles occurs in a variety of con-
texts. Both international rings and interstate crime opera-
tions traﬃ  c young girls to faraway places, promising them 
employment and money. Runaway and homeless youths 
are recruited by pimps or engage in “survival sex.” Drug 
dealers get youths addicted and then force them to pros-
titute themselves to receive drugs or have a place to stay. 
Some parents have advertised and prostituted their chil-
dren over the Internet. Th e big question becomes, are these 
young prostitutes oﬀ enders or victims? Albanese urges,
When child-victims of commercial sexual exploitation 
come to the attention of authorities, the public often 
regards them as teenage prostitutes, but this is not 
an accurate description. Rather, when a minor with 
few visible choices sells sex at the hands of an exploi-
tive adult, it is generally a means of survival. Th e term 
“teenage prostitution” also overlooks the legal status 
of minors who have greater legal protections regarding 
sexual conduct because of their emotional and physi-
cal immaturity and the need to protect them from 
exploitative adults. Th erefore, it is important that vic-
tims of child sexual exploitation are not mistaken for 
oﬀ enders.
Often the traﬃ  cking of children precedes their 
involvement in prostitution.
TRAFFICKING OF CHILDREN 
Human traﬃ  cking often involves school-age children, par-
ticularly those not living with their parents, who are vul-
nerable to coerced labor exploitation, domestic servitude 
or commercial sexual exploitation. Sex traﬃ  ckers target 
young children because they are vulnerable, gullible and 
in demand. Th e average age of entry into prostitution is 
12 to 14 years of age (Human Traﬃ  cking of Children, 2007). 
Human traﬃ  cking was discussed in Chapter 10.
MISSING CHILDREN: 
RUNAWAY OR ABDUCTED?
Another major challenge facing law enforcement 
involves cases of missing children.
A special challenge in cases where a child is reported 
missing is to determine whether the child has run away 
or been abducted.
of criminal activity. Investigating speciﬁ c online locations 
is initiated through a citizen complaint, a complaint by an 
ISP or a referral from a law enforcement agency.
Another approach to combating online sex crimes 
against children is to establish an ICAC task force.
Internet Crimes against Children Task Forces In 
September 1998, the OJJDP began a national program to 
counter the growing threat of oﬀ enders using the Internet 
to sexually exploit children by making 10 awards to state 
and local law enforcement agencies across the country. 
CyberTipline Th e NCMEC CyberTipline (www.cybertipline.
com) maintains a 24-hour-a-day number (1-800-843-
5678) that receives leads in ﬁ ve basic areas: (1) posses-
sion, manufacture and distribution of child pornography, 
(2) online enticement of children for sexual acts, (3) child 
prostitution, (4) child sex tourism and (5) child sexual 
molestation outside the family.
INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES
In 1996, the First World Congress against Commercial 
Exploitation of Children convened in Stockholm, Swe-
den. Th is congress adopted a Declaration and Agenda for 
Action calling upon states to, among other things:
• • Accord high priority to action against the commer-
cial exploitation of children and allocate adequate 
resources to the eﬀ ort
• • Promote stronger cooperation between states and all 
sectors of society and strengthen the role of families
• • Criminalize the commercial sexual exploitation of 
children
• • Condemn and penalize the oﬀ enders while ensuring 
that child victims are not penalized
• • Review and revise laws, policies, programs and 
practices
• • Enforce laws, policies and programs
Interpol has established a Standing Working Party 
(SWP) on Oﬀ enses against Minors that seeks to improve 
international cooperation in preventing and combating 
child pornography and other forms of child sexual exploi-
tation. Th e group meets twice a year to produce best-
practices reports. Yet another challenge for investigators 
involved in crimes against children is that of prostitution.
PROSTITUTION OF JUVENILES
“Child prostitution encompasses the exchange of sexual 
services for remuneration or other forms of consideration, 
including food, housing, drugs, or other commodities 

366 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
RUNAWAY CHILDREN
Many runaways are insecure, depressed, unhappy and 
impulsive with low self-esteem. Typical runaways report 
conﬂ ict with and alienation from parents, rejection and 
hostile control and lack of warmth, aﬀ ection and parental 
support. Running away may compound their problems. 
Many runaways become streetwise and turn to drugs, 
crime, prostitution or other illegal activities.
For 21 percent of the 1.7 million runaway/thrown-
away youths, their episode involved physical or sexual 
abuse at home before leaving or fear of such abuse upon 
their return (Juvenile Oﬀ enders and Victims, 2006, p.45). 
Other problems reported included parental drug or alco-
hol abuse, mental health problems within the family and 
domestic violence between the parents.
Very few runaways are homeless and living on the 
street, and most do not go far: “Survival and safety issues 
are fairly minimal for the large majority of juveniles who 
stay with friends or relatives. However a minority face 
serious risks, such as exploitation by predatory adults, 
involvement in criminal activity, drug abuse or unsafe 
sex; health problems stemming from exposure to the ele-
ments, poor nutrition and other eﬀ ects of living on the 
street and a higher risk of depression and suicide” (Dedel, 
2006, p.3).
Considerations about whether youths are missing 
voluntarily include resources available to them to satisfy 
basic needs, such as food and shelter, access to money or 
credit cards, skills to get a job and access to a vehicle or 
public transportation. Another indicator that the absence 
is voluntary is that items such as clothing and treasured 
personal possessions are missing. Sometimes information 
can be obtained by examining the teenager’s computer 
e-mails.
Sometimes a note is left conﬁ rming that the youth 
has indeed run away, but often there is no note. In other 
cases, evidence indicates that the child has not run away 
but, rather, has been abducted.
ABDUCTED CHILDREN
Abducted children are often kidnapped. Kidnapping is 
taking someone away by force, often for ransom. Child 
kidnapping is especially traumatic for the parents and 
for those called upon to investigate. A highly publicized 
child kidnapping case in 1989 involved the abduction of 
11-year-old Jacob Wetterling, who was taken at gunpoint 
from near his home in Minnesota by a masked man. No 
ransom was demanded, and despite national publicity and 
a nationwide search, Jacob remains missing.
Some child kidnappings are committed by a parent 
who has lost custody of the child in divorce proceedings. 
NCMEC is a private, nonproﬁ t organization estab-
lished in 1984 to spearhead national eﬀ orts to locate and 
recover missing children and raise public awareness about 
ways to prevent child abduction, molestation and sexual 
exploitation. Th rough March 2005, NCMEC played a role 
in recovering more than 92,090 children, worked on more 
than 106,000 missing child cases and handled more than 
1.8 million phone calls through its nationwide, toll-free 
hotline 1-800-THE-LOST. 
According to the NCMEC, approximately 2,000 chil-
dren across the country are reported as missing every 
day. FBI ﬁ gures indicate more than 63,000 active juve-
nile missing person cases in the FBI’s National Crime 
Information Center (NCIC) database (Mills-Senn, 2006, 
p.10). Data from the Juvenile Oﬀ enders and Victims: 2006 
National Report indicates
• • Annually about 19 in 1,000 children younger than age 
18 are missing from caretakers. Only a small fraction 
of missing children were abducted (about 10 in 100), 
most by family members (8 in 10). Runaway youth 
account for nearly half of all missing children (p.43).
• • Teens ages 15 to 17 accounted for 68 percent of the 
estimated 1.7 million youths who were gone from 
their homes either because they had run away or 
because their caretakers threw them out. Fewer than 
4 in 10 of all runaway/thrownaway youths are truly 
missing—their parents knew where they were staying. 
Most youths who ran away or were thrown out of their 
homes were gone less than a week (77 percent) (p.45).
Th e Missing Children’s Act was passed in 1982 and the 
Missing Children’s Assistance Act in 1984. Th e Missing 
Children’s Assistance Act of 1984 deﬁ nes a missing child as 
“Any individual, less than 18 years of age, whose where-
abouts are unknown to such individual’s legal custodi-
an—if the circumstances surrounding the disappearance 
indicate that (the child) may possibly have been removed 
by another person from the control of his/her legal cus-
todian without the custodian’s consent; or the circum-
stances of the case strongly indicate that (the child) is 
likely to be abused or sexually exploited.”
Th is act requires the Oﬃ  ce of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention to conduct periodic national inci-
dence studies to determine the actual number of children 
reported missing. 
Th e second National Incident Studies of Missing, 
Abducted, Runaway and Th rownaway Children (NISMART-2) 
(Hammer, Finkelhor, Sedlak and Porcellini, 2004, p.2) 
considers three categories: runaways; family abductions; 
and lost, injured or otherwise missing children. Each of 
the categories is subdivided into broad scope—all cases 
in the category—and policy focal—cases considered to be 
more serious.

Also prepare a ﬂ yer or bulletin with the child’s photograph 
and descriptive information and distribute it in appropri-
ate geographic regions. Secure the child’s latest medical 
and dental records. Establish a telephone hotline for tips 
and leads. Although the initial steps in the response are 
extensive, time-consuming and labor intensive, the pre-
liminary investigation should be commenced as soon as 
possible after the original missing child report is received 
(Steidel, 2000, p.32).
If the preliminary investigation does not resolve 
the situation, a follow-up investigation must be con-
ducted. Responsibilities of the investigative officer are 
many:
• • Obtain a brieﬁ ng from the ﬁ rst responding oﬃ  cer and 
other on-scene personnel.
• • Verify all information developed during the prelimi-
nary investigation.
• • Obtain a brief, recent history of family dynamics.
• • Correct and investigate the reasons for any conﬂ icting 
information oﬀ ered by witnesses and others submit-
ting information.
• • Develop an investigation plan for follow up.
Runaways  If it is determined—either through a note 
or other evidence—that the child has run away, investiga-
tors (in addition to doing the investigative steps already 
described) should initially check agency records for recent 
contact with the child (arrests, other activities) (Steidel, 
p.85). Review school records and interview teachers, other 
school personnel and classmates and check the contents 
of the school locker.
Investigators should also consider the following crite-
ria to determine whether the runaway child is endangered 
(Steidel, 2000, p.90):
• • Is the missing child younger than 13 years of age?
• • Is the missing child believed to be out of the physi-
cal or geographic zone of safety for his or her age and 
developmental stage?
• • Is the missing child mentally incapacitated?
• • Is the missing child drug dependent—on a prescribed 
medication or an illegal substance—and is the depen-
dency life-threatening?
• • Was the missing child absent from home for more 
than 24 hours before being reported to police?
• • Is the missing child believed to be in a life-threatening 
situation?
• • Is the missing child believed to be in the company of 
adults who could endanger his or her welfare?
In such cases, ransom is not demanded. Rather, the parent 
committing the kidnapping may take on a new identity 
and move to another part of the country. Parental abduc-
tion is discussed later in this chapter. Childless couples 
have also been known to kidnap babies or young children 
to raise as their own.
The most frequent type of child abduction is parental 
abduction.
In some cases, parents are simply poorly educated 
about the law, not knowing it to be a crime to abscond 
with their children. Other risk factors or warning signs 
of a possible parental abduction include prior threats of 
abduction or a history of hiding the child or withholding 
visitation; a parent’s lack of emotional or ﬁ nancial ties to 
the area where the child is living; signs that a parent has 
liquidated assets, borrowed money or made maximum 
withdrawals of funds against credit cards; and various 
forms of mental illness in a parent.
Regardless of whether the investigator knows whether 
the child is a runaway or has been abducted, speciﬁ c inves-
tigative steps should be taken.
INVESTIGATING A MISSING CHILD REPORT
Th e ﬁ rst responder conducts the preliminary investiga-
tion. Interview the parent(s) or person who made the 
initial report, verify that the child is in fact missing and 
verify the child’s custody status. Conduct a search to 
include all surrounding areas, including vehicles and other 
places of concealment, treating the area as a crime scene. 
Based on the circumstances of the child’s disappearance, 
oﬃ  cers should consider using canine units, using forced 
entry into abandoned cars, sealing oﬀ  any apartment 
complex where the child was last seen and considering 
use of search-and-rescue organizations, ﬁ re departments, 
military units, and scout groups and other volunteers for 
a large-scale search (Steidel, 2000, p.36).
Oﬃ  cers should evaluate the contents and appear-
ance of the child’s room and determine whether any 
of the child’s personal items are missing. Obtain pho-
tographs and videotapes of the missing child. Prepare 
reports. Enter the missing child into the NCIC Missing 
Persons File and report it to NCMEC. Interview other 
family members and friends and associates of the child 
and of the family to determine when each last saw the 
child and what he or she thinks happened to the child. 
Ensure that everyone at the scene is identiﬁ ed and inter-
viewed separately.
As time permits, prepare and update bulletins for 
local law enforcement agencies, state missing children’s

or her residence. Rapid action is necessary because after a 
child has been in another country for one year, the treaty 
is no longer binding. One helpful resource in such circum-
stances is A Family Resource Guide on International Parental 
Kidnapping (2007).
Because of the seriousness of missing child cases and 
the critical need for a prompt response, investigators 
are strongly advised to seek the assistance of national 
resources and specialized services. One such resource 
used in all 50 states is the AMBER Alert plan.
THE AMBER ALERT PLAN
America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response 
(AMBER) Alert is a voluntary partnership between law 
enforcement and broadcasters to activate an urgent bulle-
tin in the most serious child abduction cases. Th e AMBER 
Alert was created in the Dallas–Fort Worth region in 1996 
in response to the death of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman, 
who was abducted while riding her bicycle in Arlington, 
Texas, and then brutally murdered. AMBER Alerts are 
emergency messages broadcast when a law enforcement 
agency determines that a child has been abducted and is 
in imminent danger. Th e broadcasts include information 
that could assist in the child’s recovery, including a physi-
cal description of the child and abductor. All 50 states 
now have statewide AMBER Alert plans (“Department of 
Justice Marks 11th Anniversary,” 2007, p.1). Th ese alerts 
may be put on television and radio stations, electronic 
message systems on highways and other media. In most 
departments, the public information oﬃ  cer (PIO) is the 
communication cornerstone of this network: “Th e public 
information oﬃ  cer (PIO) should be the primary point of 
contact for the media. Th is means that the PIO should be 
responsible for conveying all information from the law 
enforcement agency to the public via the media and for 
ﬁ elding inquiries from journalists and the public” (AMBER 
Alert, 2006, p.1).
The National AMBER Alert Network Act of 2002 encour-
aged development of a nationwide alert system for 
abducted children. The Prosecutorial Remedies and 
Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today 
(PROTECT) Act of 2003 provided $25 million to support 
state AMBER Alert plans.
According to AMBER Alert’s home page, the program 
is a proven success and has helped rescue more than 230 
children nationwide. Th e AMBER Alert system is being 
expanded to cell phone customers in Florida. Subscrib-
ers with phones capable of receiving text messages can 
register through their participating carriers’ Web sites. 
• • Is the child’s absence inconsistent with his or her 
established patterns of behavior and the deviation not 
readily explained?
• • Are there other circumstances involved in the disap-
pearance that would cause a reasonable person to con-
clude that the child should be considered at risk?
Any child who ﬁ ts any of these criteria should be cat-
egorized as an endangered runaway, and eﬀ orts to locate 
the child should be immediately put into eﬀ ect.
Abductions For oﬃ  cers considering criminal charges 
against a parent who has abducted his or her child, the 
following questions are pertinent (Steidel, 2000, p.76):
• • Is there suﬃ  cient documentation to demonstrate par-
entage and the individual’s right to physical custody 
or access?
• • Can the suspect-parent actually be identiﬁ ed as the 
abductor?
• • A vacation or change of address is not necessarily 
illegal. Can it be clearly established that the intent 
of the move was to unlawfully deny access to the 
complainant?
• • If removal from the state is an element of the oﬀ ense, 
can it be proven that the child has been physically 
taken across the state line?
• • Can it be demonstrated that the suspect-parent is 
responsible for the removal?
• • Have mitigating factors (such as domestic violence 
and abuse) been evaluated that, by statute, could 
undermine the ﬁ ling of a charge?
• • If an accomplice was involved, can it be proven that he 
or she had suﬃ  cient personal knowledge of the legal 
custody issues to form criminal intent?
• • If the accomplice was the abductor, can the suspect-
parent’s complicity be demonstrated? How can he or 
she be directly implicated?
If the situation warrants, oﬃ  cers should use the fed-
eral Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution (UFAP) statute 
(Steidel, 2000, p.75). Although UFAP warrants are not 
required for out-of-state arrests, they can be very helpful.
Th e investigation becomes exponentially more com-
plicated when the suspect-parent leaves the country with 
the child: “As soon as it has been determined that a child 
may have been taken to a foreign country, the left-behind 
parent should immediately contact the U.S. Department 
of State to discuss ﬁ ling an application invoking the 
Hague Convention” (Steidel, 2000, p.78). Th e Hague Con-
vention is an international treaty calling for the prompt 
return of an abducted child, usually to the country of his 

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children  | 369
BEYOND AMBER ALERTS
Law enforcement agencies should consider technologies 
to supplement the AMBER Alert program, such as e-mails 
to law enforcement agencies, a call to a cell phone, a fax 
blast, an Internet pop-up window or the A Child Is Miss-
ing system. Whatever system is used, however, it must be 
able to be implemented and accessed quickly, as time is 
of the essence in such cases. Remember: “When a child is 
going to be murdered during an abduction, 74 percent of 
the time, it happens within the ﬁ rst three hours” (White-
head, 2008, p.85). Departments should consider estab-
lishing a child abduction response team. 
A Child Abduction Response Team (CART)  Swager 
(2007, p.137) cites several reasons for having a CART: 
“Most abductions are short term and involve sexual 
assault; 44 percent of abducted children who are killed are 
killed in less than one hour of being abducted; 75 percent 
are killed within 3 hours of being abducted; 91 percent are 
killed within 24 hours of being abducted; 99 percent of 
those murdered are killed within 7 days of being abducted.” 
Because of the time-sensitive nature of child abductions, 
the mission of a CART is to bring expert resources to child 
abduction cases quickly. Such a team typically consists of 
seasoned, experienced oﬃ  cers from around the region, 
each with a preplanned response related to that oﬃ  cer’s 
ﬁ eld of expertise. Such teams might also include mounted 
patrol, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), helicopters and K-9s—
whatever resources are readily available.
Th e program is also being expanded to include tribal law 
enforcement agencies. 
As AMBER Alert describes itself: “Th e goal of AMBER 
Alert is to recover abducted children before they meet 
physical harm. Statistics show that time itself is the enemy 
of an abducted child, because most children who are kid-
napped and later found murdered die within the ﬁ rst 3 
hours after being taken. AMBER Alert aims to turn that 
statistic around. Studies show that when ordinary citizens 
become the eyes and ears of law enforcement, precious lives 
can be saved” (Bringing Abducted Children Home, 2008).
A law enforcement agency can activate an AMBER 
Alert only if the circumstances surrounding a child’s dis-
appearance meet local or state criteria. Th e AMBER Alert 
criteria recommended by the U.S. Department of Justice 
are as follows:
 1. Law enforcement oﬃ  cials must have a reasonable 
belief that an abduction of a child age 17 or younger 
has occurred.
 2. Law enforcement oﬃ  cials must believe that the child is 
in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death.
 3. Enough descriptive information must exist about the 
victim and the abductor for law enforcement to issue 
an AMBER Alert.
 4. Th e child’s name and other critical data elements—
including the child abduction (CA) and AMBER Alert 
(AA) ﬂ ags—must have been entered into the NCIC 
system.
An AMBER Alert highway advisory sign 
over Interstate 80 in Nebraska engages 
the driving public as vital partners to 
law enforcement in the search for 
abducted children. Such advisories 
have met with considerable success in 
retrieving children alive.

370 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
• • To reduce the number of times the child must face the 
accused, the courts are allowing testimony concern-
ing observations of the child by another person who is 
not a witness, allowing the child to remain in another 
room during the trial or using a videotape of the 
child’s testimony as evidence.
• • Some courts remove the accused from the courtroom 
during the child’s testimony.
Many of these changes in rules and procedures are 
being challenged. Sixth Amendment issues arise concern-
ing the right to confront witnesses. In Coy v. Iowa (1988), 
the Supreme Court ruled that a protective screen vio-
lated the Sixth Amendment, but Justice O’Connor opined 
that the Coy decision did not rule out using videotapes 
or closed-circuit television (CCTV). In Maryland v. Craig 
(1990), the Supreme Court carved out an exception to 
the Sixth Amendment by stating that alleged child abuse 
victims could testify by CCTV if the court was satisﬁ ed 
through testimony that face-to-face confrontation would 
traumatize the victim.
Despite some courts’ stance that children should be 
made to testify in court as any other victim or witness, 
some studies have provided evidence that courtroom 
testimony is not always the best way to elicit accurate 
information from children. If children will be testifying 
in court, several courtroom preparation techniques might 
improve their testimony and place them more at ease, such 
as giving them a tour of the courtroom, making coloring 
or activity books depicting courtrooms and trials available 
or showing them videotapes about the court process.
PREVENTING CRIMES AGAINST 
CHILDREN
Child abusers can be of any race, age or occupa-
tion; they can be someone close or a complete 
stranger. When given adequate information, children can 
avoid dangerous situations and better protect themselves 
against such predators.
Crimes against children may be prevented by educating 
them about potential danger and by keeping the channels 
of communication open.
Th e following speciﬁ c suggestions should assist in 
preventing crimes against children. Although the sugges-
tions refer to parents, they apply equally to guardians or 
other individuals who care for children:
A CART may also include a family coordinator, a media 
coordinator, a crime scene coordinator, a street patrol coor-
dinator, an interview team coordinator, a research coor-
dinator, a search coordinator and a coordinator of other 
agencies involved (Moore, 2006, p.130). 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE
One valuable resource in missing children cases is the 
Missing and Exploited Children’s Program. Th is program 
provides direct services through NCMEC, the Associa-
tion of Missing and Exploited Children’s Organizations 
(AMECO) and Health Opportunities for People Every-
where (Project HOPE). Th e program also provides train-
ing and technical assistance to law enforcement, and it 
conducts research.
Th e Help Oﬀ ering Parents Empowerment (Team 
HOPE) project, established in 1998, helps families of 
missing children handle the day-to-day issues of coping. 
Team HOPE links victim-parents with experienced and 
trained parent volunteers who have gone through the 
experience of having a missing child. Because they speak 
from ﬁ rsthand experience, these volunteers provide com-
passion, counsel and support in ways no other community 
agency can.
Having looked at the various incidents involving chil-
dren as victims of crime, consider next their role in pre-
senting a case in court. Th is discussion will be expanded 
on in Chapter 21.
CHILDREN AS WITNESSES IN 
COURT
With the increase in criminal cases involving 
physical and sexual abuse of children, the 
problems associated with children providing testimony in 
court have increased proportionately. Court procedures 
and legal practices that beneﬁ t the child witness may not 
be balanced with the rights of the accused, and vice versa. 
To resolve some of these problems, the courts have 
changed a number of rules and procedures:
• • Some courts give preference to these cases by placing 
them ahead of other cases on the docket.
• • Some courts permit videotaping child interviews and 
then providing access to the tapes to numerous indi-
viduals to spare the child the added trauma of mul-
tiple interviews.
• • Courts are limiting privileges for repeated medical and 
psychological examinations of children.

CHAPTER 11 | Crimes Against Children | 371
• • Parents should help children plan safe routes to and 
from school and their friends’ homes. Children should 
then travel these routes. “Block parent” programs can 
provide places where children can stop if in danger, 
or the parents should tell their children what houses 
they can stop at where family friends live. Children 
should be taught to play in groups; to avoid vacant 
buildings, alleys and restrooms; and to walk with 
friends when possible.
• • Babysitters should be selected carefully. Parents 
should always request and check references.
A guidebook, Personal Safety for Children: A Guide for 
Parents, is designed to help parents take speciﬁ c steps to 
improve their children’s safety. It is available at http://
www.missingkids.com. 
Digital technology is allowing police to become more 
eﬀ ective in preventing and handling crimes against chil-
dren. For example, some law enforcement departments 
are teaming up with schools and the community to create 
digital ﬁ les of local children in a step toward discouraging 
child abduction. Such ﬁ les contain digitized photographs, 
ﬁ ngerprints and other personal information of area stu-
dents and, because of their digital nature, can be dis-
patched within minutes to any law enforcement agency, 
business or other organization involved in the search for 
a missing child.
• • Parents should teach their children about sexual 
abuse, what forms it may take and what to do about 
it. Children should learn to discuss sex questions with 
their parents. Th ey should know what sexual abuse is, 
including anyone touching their anus, penis, vagina or 
breasts. Th ey should learn to tell their parents if they 
encounter any abnormal sexual behavior from adults.
• • Parents should listen to their children. Children may 
drop subtle hints such as “Uncle Charlie was not very 
nice to me today.” An appropriate response may be 
“Oh? How was he not nice?” Such a response may 
elicit a statement such as, “He asked me to take down 
my pants when I was in the car.”
• • Children should be instructed to tell their parents 
when someone tells them, “Don’t tell anyone.” Usually 
if someone says not to tell, it is about something that 
is wrong.
• • Parents should understand that children do not usu-
ally tell tales about sexual abuse. Experience has 
taught parents and police that the vast majority of 
sexual abuse incidents that children tell of are true. 
Th erefore, if a child tells a parent about being sexu-
ally abused, the parents should report it to the police 
immediately.
• • Older children should be taught to tell their parents 
where they are going, with whom and approximately 
when they expect to return. Th ey should learn to call 
home if plans change.
• • Children should be taught to stay with the group when 
they are at events away from home and that if they 
become lost, they are to go to an area where people are 
present and seek help.
• • Children should be taught that when they are home 
alone they should lock the doors and windows and 
never let strangers in. Parents should see that doors 
and windows are locked before they leave the child 
alone. Th ey should also give proper instructions for 
leaving the home in case of ﬁ re.
• • Children should be taught that sometimes it is all 
right to tell a lie. For example, if a child is home alone 
and receives a phone call for one of the parents, it is 
all right to say the parents are home but cannot come 
to the phone because they are resting or in the shower 
or some other excuse.
Technology Innovations
Mousetrap: Protecting America’s Children from 
Online Predators is an interactive CD-ROM guide for 
parents, educators and children about the dangers 
online. Its three goals are to (1) educate adults on the 
basics of online activities, such as chat rooms and 
instant messaging, (2) raise awareness of adults on 
the tactics used by Internet predators and (3) provide 
adults with tools to prevent and detect possible 
exploitation. The program was developed by the 
Virginia Community Policing Institute and Blue Ridge 
Thunder, a group of cybercops who patrol the Inter-
net for molesters and child pornographers.

372 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
 
A special challenge in cases where a child is reported 
missing is to determine whether the child has run away or 
been abducted. Th e most frequent type of child abduction 
is parental abduction. Th e National AMBER Alert Network 
Act of 2002 encouraged development of a nationwide alert 
system for abducted children. Th e PROTECT Act of 2003 
provided $25 million to support state AMBER Alert plans.
 
Crimes against children may be prevented by educat-
ing them about potential danger and by keeping the chan-
nels of communication open.

ing sexual abuse of a 10-year-old white female. Th e caller 
states that the abusers are the father and brother of the 
CHECKLIST
APPLICATION
Crimes against children include maltreatment (neglect 
and abuse), sexual exploitation (pornography and pros-
titution), traﬃ  cking and abduction. Th e four common 
types of maltreatment are neglect, physical abuse, emo-
tional abuse and sexual abuse. Neglect is the most com-
mon form of child maltreatment and may be fatal. Child 
abuse has been identiﬁ ed as the biggest single cause of 
death of young children. 
 
Child abuse and neglect can result in serious and per-
manent physical, mental and emotional damage, as well 
as in future criminal behavior. Th e two leading causes 
of child abuse are thought to be poverty and violence 
between husbands and wives.
 
Typically child abuse and neglect laws have three 
components: (1) criminal deﬁ nitions and penalties, (2) 
a mandate to report suspected cases and (3) civil process 
for removing the child from the abusive or neglectful 
environment.
 
Challenges in investigating crimes against children 
include the need to protect the child from further harm, 
the possibility of parental involvement, the need to col-
laborate with other agencies, the diﬃ  culty of interview-
ing children and credibility concerns. If the possibility of 
present or continued danger to the child exists, the child 
must be removed into protective custody. When inter-
viewing children, oﬃ  cers should consider the child’s age, 
ability to describe what happened and the potential for 
retaliation by the suspect against a child who “tells.” In 
most child abuse cases, children tell the truth to the best 
of their ability.
 
Most reports of child neglect or abuse are made by third 
parties such as teachers, physicians, neighbors, siblings or 
parents. Seldom does the victim report the oﬀ ense.
 
Evidence in child neglect or abuse cases includes the 
surroundings, the home conditions, clothing, bruises or 
other body injuries, the medical examination report and 
other observations. Indicators of neglect or abuse may be 
physical or behavioral or both.
 
Investigators should be aware of three types of sex 
rings: solo, transition and syndicated. Certain cults are 
also involved in the sexual abuse of children.
 
Pedophiles’ reactions to being discovered usually 
begin with complete denial and then progress to minimiz-
ing the acts, justifying the acts and blaming the victims. If 
all else fails, they may claim to be sick. 
 
Th e Child Protection Act (1984) prohibits child por-
nography and greatly increases the penalties for adults 
who engage in it. Th ree law enforcement approaches have 
emerged as models to combat child sexual exploitation: 
special task forces, strike forces and law enforcement 
networks.

area visiting their father. Th e sons told her that the father 
goes into the bathroom and bedroom with his lover’s 
8-year-old daughter and closes the door. Th ey also have 
seen the father making suggestive advances to the girl and 
taking her into the shower with him. Th e girl has told the 
woman’s sons that the father does “naughty” things to 
her. Th e woman’s sons are currently at home with her, but 
she is worried about the little girl.
Questions
 1. Should an investigation be initiated based on this 
thirdhand information?
 2. If the report is founded, what type of crime is being 
committed?
 3. Who has jurisdiction to investigate?
 4. What actions would be necessary in the noninitiating 
state?
 5. Where should the initial contact with the alleged vic-
tim be made?
D. A reliable informant has told police that a man has 
been molesting children in his garage. Police establish a 
surveillance of the suspect and see him invite a juvenile 
into his car. Th ey follow the car and see it pull into the 
driveway of the man’s residence. Th e man and the boy 
then go into the house. Th e oﬃ  cers follow and knock on 
the front door but receive no answer. Th ey knock again 
and loudly state their purpose. Continuing to receive no 
answer, they enter the house through the unlocked front 
door, talk to the boy and based on what he says, arrest the 
suspect.
Questions
 1. Did the oﬃ  cers violate the suspect’s right to privacy 
and domestic security?
 2. Does the emergency doctrine apply?
 3. What should be done with the victim?
 4. Was the arrest legal?
Note: In each of the preceding cases, the information is 
initially received not from the victim but from third par-
ties. Th is is usually the case in child abuse oﬀ enses.
 1. At what age does a child cease to be a minor in your 
state? 
 2. What is the child sexual abuse problem in your com-
munity? How many oﬀ enses were charged during the 
past year? Is there any method of estimating how 
many unreported oﬀ enses occurred?

girl and provides all three names and their address. When 
the oﬃ  cer requests more details, the caller hangs up. You 
are assigned the case and initiate the investigation by con-
tacting the alleged victim at school. She is reluctant to talk 
to you at ﬁ rst but eventually admits that both her father 
and brother have been having sex with her for almost a 
year. You then question the suspects and obtain written 
statements in which they admit the sexual abuse.
Questions
 1. Should the investigation have been initiated on the 
basis of the anonymous caller?
 2. What type of crime has been committed?
 3. Was it appropriate to make the initial contact with 
the victim at her school?
 4. Who should be present at the victim’s initial 
interview?
 5. What should be done with the victim after obtaining 
the facts?
 6. What would be the basis for an aﬃ  davit for an arrest 
warrant?
B. A police oﬃ  cer receives an anonymous phone call 
stating that a child is being sexually assaulted at a speciﬁ c 
address. Th e oﬃ  cer goes to the address—an apartment—
and through an open door sees a child lying on the ﬂ oor, 
apparently unconscious. Th e oﬃ  cer enters the apartment 
and, while checking the child for injuries, notices blood on 
the child’s face and clothing. Th e child regains conscious-
ness, and the oﬃ  cer asks, “Did your dad do this?” Th e child 
answers, “Yes.” Th e oﬃ  cer then goes into another room 
and ﬁ nds the father in bed, intoxicated. Th e oﬃ  cer rouses 
the father and places him under arrest.
Questions
 1. Was the oﬃ  cer authorized to enter the apartment on 
the basis of the initial information?
 2. Was the oﬃ  cer authorized to enter without a 
warrant?
 3. Should the oﬃ  cer have asked whether the father had 
injured the child? If not, how should the question 
have been phrased?
 4. Was an arrest of the father justiﬁ ed without a 
warrant?
 5. What should be done with the victim?
C. A woman living in another state telephones the 
police department and identiﬁ es herself as the ex-wife of 
a man she believes is performing illegal sexual acts with 
the daughter of his present lover. Th e man resides in the

obbery has plagued the human race throughout history. During the 1930s, 
John Dillinger, America’s number-one desperado, captured the attention of 
citizens and law enforcement oﬃ  cers alike. Th is notorious bank robber’s tools of the 
trade were a Th ompson submachine gun and a revolver. Although admired by many 
for his daring and cast as a folk hero, Dillinger gunned down 10 men. “Pretty Boy” 
Floyd began his criminal career by robbing a local post oﬃ  ce of $350 in pennies. 
Like Dillinger, he also killed 10 people. Who has not heard of Bonnie Parker and 
Clyde Barrow’s murder and robbery spree through Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma?
R

More recently, two Los Angeles police oﬃ  cers on 
patrol drove by the Bank of America and saw what turned 
out to be two armed robbers dressed like Ninja Turtles 
enter the bank. Th e oﬃ  cers called for backup and within 
5 minutes, the bank was surrounded. Th e bank robbers 
emerged with ﬁ ve fully automatic reﬂ ex riﬂ es, a semiau-
tomatic pistol and a Molotov cocktail. Th e ensuing gun 
battle ended in injuries to 11 oﬃ  cers and 7 civilians and 
the deaths of both suspects.
 
Th e preceding are vivid examples of the violent nature 
of many robberies. Robbery is one of the three most violent 
crimes against the person. Only homicide and rape are con-
sidered more traumatic to a victim. According to the FBI’s 
Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), there were an estimated 
417,122 robberies in the nation in 2006, a 7.2 percent 
increase from the 2005 estimate. However, the estimated 
number of oﬀ enses declined 20.3 percent in comparison 
with the data from 10 years ago. Data from the National 
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) report a much higher 
incidence of robberies—711,570 in 2006, at a rate of 2.9 
per 1,000 households (Rand and Catalano, 2007). Such dif-
ferences underscore the need to recognize how crime data 
are gathered and to view such statistics with caution.
 
Robbery accounted for 29.9 percent of all violent 
crimes in 2006. Th e clearance rate for robbery was 25.2 
percent in 2006 (Crime in the United States, 2006). Other 
facts about robbery reported in Crime in the United States 
2006 include
• • By location type, most robberies (44.5 percent) were 
committed on streets or highways (see Figure 12.1).
• • Th e average dollar value of property stolen per robbery 
oﬀ ense was $1,268. By location type, bank robbery 
had the highest average dollar value taken—$4,330 
per oﬀ ense.
• • Losses estimated at $583 million were attributed to 
robberies during 2006.
• • Firearms were used in 42.2 percent of robberies for 
which the UCR program received data.
 
Th is crime poses a deﬁ nite hazard to law enforcement 
oﬃ  cers: “According to the FBI, the number one reason 
why oﬃ  cers are killed and or assaulted while oﬀ  duty is 
intervening in or being the victim of a robbery or robbery 
attempt” (Rayburn, 2007, p.56).

ROBBERY: AN OVERVIEW
Robbery takes many forms, from the daring 
  exploits of criminals such as Dillinger to purse 
snatching and muggings. Whatever the form, the poten-
tial for violence exists.
Robbery is the felonious taking of another’s property, 
either directly from the person or in that person’s 
presence, through force or intimidation.
Most robbers carry a weapon or other threatening 
item or indicate to the victim that they are armed to com-
pel compliance from the victim. Th erefore, little direct 

CHAPTER 12 | Robbery | 379
personal contact occurs between the robber and the 
victim, which reduces the probability of physical evidence 
remaining at the crime scene. Despite the inherent dan-
ger to the victim during a robbery, most robberies do not 
result in personal injury. Sometimes, however, a violent 
physical act is performed against the victim early in the 
robbery, either by original intent or because of unex-
pected circumstances or resistance. Such cases involve 
additional charges of aggravated assault or, in the case of 
death, murder.
According to the UCR, the use of violence during rob-
beries has increased during the past 10 years, but such vio-
lence is not nearly as frequent as the public might expect. 
One theory about the low rates of injury and death during 
robberies is that the threat of force, the use of force or the 
presence of a weapon reduces the likelihood of the victim 
resisting.
Confronted with threatening statements, a threaten-
ing note or a visible weapon, most robbery victims obey 
the robber’s demands.
However, the behavior of an armed robber is unpre-
dictable. In some cases when the victim resists, the rob-
ber may ﬂ ee without completing the robbery. In one case, 
a man armed with a shotgun demanded and obtained 
$10,000 from a bank teller. Instead of leaving, he talked 
to the teller for 15 minutes, telling her that he was drunk 
and considering suicide. Th en he handed the money back 
to the teller and walked out of the bank. In another case, 
a robber handed a bank teller a note that said, “Please put 
the money in this bag and no one will get hurt. Th ank you 
very much.” Th e teller called a bank guard and handed 
him the note. Th e guard read the note and told the rob-
ber, “Get out, you bum, or I’ll blow your brains out.” Th e 
robber quickly left the bank. In other instances, however, 
resisting victims have been injured or killed.
Violence against the victim also occurs in muggings 
and purse snatchings in which the victim is struck with a 
weapon, club or the ﬁ sts or is knocked down. Older people 
are often injured by the fall resulting from such violent 
acts. Any such violent contact increases the probability of 
hair, ﬁ bers, scratches or other evidence being found on 
the victim or the suspect.
Most robbers are visibly armed with a weapon or dan-
gerous device and make an oral demand for the desired 
money or property. For example, a robber uses a gun to 
obtain money from an attendant inside a service station. 
Either the gun is visible or the robber’s hands are in a coat 
or jacket pocket in such a way as to indicate possession of 
a weapon.
Some robbers present a note rather than speaking. Th e 
robber may or may not ask for the note to be returned. It 
is important evidence if left behind.
Hostages are held in some robberies. In one case, a 
bank’s head cashier, his wife and their child were held cap-
tive by a robber for 5 hours one Saturday. Th e cashier was 
ordered to go to the bank and get money. Th e wife and 
child were tied up but left unharmed. In another case, a 
woman was taken from her home and forced to drive two 
men to a bank in her car. Th ey forced her to accompany 
them into the bank, robbed it, left her there and used her 
car for their getaway. Bank robberies and hostage situa-
tions are discussed later in this chapter.
Robbers use various ruses to get themselves into posi-
tion for the crime. Th ey may loiter, pose as salespeople 
or feign business, watching for an opportune moment 
to make their demands. Once the opportunity presents 
itself, robbers act quickly and decisively. Sometimes, how-
ever, their actions before the robbery give them away. One 
such case involved a robber who was captured by two FBI 
agents just as the teller was handing over the money. Th e 
robber was unaware that the FBI agents had been watch-
ing him since he’d entered the bank. His nervous actions 
had attracted their attention, even though they were in 
the bank on other business at the time.
Stolen jewelry or cash usually cannot be recovered 
unless an arrest is made immediately after the crime. Sto-
len purses and wallets are usually discarded within min-
utes of the robbery.
Most robberies are committed by men. Robbers are 
usually serial criminals and may commit 15 to 25 robber-
ies before being apprehended. People who commit rob-
beries are often egotistical braggarts, prone to boasting 
of their crimes. Because of this, informants can provide 
excellent leads in robbery cases.
Th e most frequent victims of robberies are drug 
houses, liquor stores, fast-food places, jewelry stores, 
convenience stores, motels, gambling houses and private 
residences. Th e elderly are frequently robbery victims of 
purse snatchings and snatches of packages committed by 
amateurs or juveniles.
Consider the following characteristics typical of 
robberies:
• • Th ey are committed by strangers rather than 
acquaintances.
• • Th ey are committed with the use of stolen cars, stolen 
motor-vehicle license plates or both.
• • Th ey are committed by two or more people working 
together.
• • Th e oﬀ ender lives within 100 miles of the robbery.
• • Robberies committed by a lone perpetrator tend to 
involve lone victims and are apt to be crimes of oppor-
tunity (spur of the moment).

380 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
Home invaders know that many Asian families dis-
trust banks and keep large amounts of cash and jewelry 
in their homes. Home-invading robberies are increasing 
in rural areas.
COMMERCIAL ROBBERIES
Convenience stores, loan companies, jewelry stores, liquor 
stores, gasoline or service stations and bars are especially 
susceptible to robbery. Drugstores are apt to be targets of 
robberies to obtain narcotics as well as cash.
Commercial robberies occur most frequently toward 
the end of the week between 6 P.M. and 4 A.M. Stores with 
poor visibility from the street and few employees on duty 
are the most likely targets. Many stores now keep only a 
limited amount of cash on hand during high-risk times. 
Stores also attempt to deter robbers by using surveillance 
cameras, alarm systems, guards and guard dogs.
Many commercial robberies are committed by indi-
viduals with criminal records; therefore, their modus 
operandis (MOs) should be compared with those of past 
robberies. Because of the oﬀ enders’ experience, commer-
cial robberies are usually better planned than street or 
vehicle-driver robberies.
Many robbers of convenience stores are on drugs or rob 
to pay for drugs. Convenience stores that are robbed once 
are likely to be robbed again. In fact, about 8 percent of con-
venience stores account for more than 50 percent of these 
robberies. Th e Occupational Health and Safety Adminis-
tration (OSHA) lists these recommendations for deterring 
workplace violence in late-night retail establishments:
• • Keep the cash-register cash balance low.
• • Provide good lighting outside and inside the store.
• • Elevate the cash-register area so the clerk has better 
viewing ability and is in sight of passersby.
• • Remove outdoor pay phones from the premises 
(Recommendations for Workplace Violence Prevention 
Programs, 1998). 
Th is resource also provides suggestions for post-inci-
dent response. 
STREET ROBBERIES
Street robberies are most frequently committed on public 
streets and sidewalks and in alleys and parking lots: “Street 
robberies are frequently committed at night and in dimly lit 
areas. Typical scenarios include a purse snatching, a strong-
arm attack at an ATM and an armed robber demanding 
cash from a person in the parking lot. Th e crime is often 
characterized by its quickness and a motive to obtain cash 
to pay for drugs” (Jetmore, 2006, p.24). Most are commit-
ted with a weapon, but some are strong-arm robberies, in 
• • Youths committing robberies tend to operate in 
groups and to use strong-arm tactics more frequently 
than do adults.
• • Less physical evidence is normally found after robber-
ies than in other violent crimes.
• • Th ey take much less time than other crimes.
• • Middle-aged and older people tend to be the victims.
In confrontational robberies, regardless of the oﬀ end-
er’s weapon, victims who defend themselves in some way 
are less likely to lose property than are victims who take 
no actions. However, victims who defend themselves 
against armed oﬀ enders are more likely to be injured than 
are those who take no actions during the crime.
CLASSIFICATION
Robberies are classiﬁ ed into four categories, 
 each committed by diﬀ erent types of people 
using diﬀ erent techniques.
Robberies are classiﬁ ed as residential, commercial, 
street or vehicle driver.
RESIDENTIAL ROBBERIES
Residential robberies include those that occur in hotel and 
motel rooms, garages, elevators and private homes. Th ese rob-
beries are less frequent than the other types but are dangerous 
and traumatic because they tend to involve entire families.
Entrance is frequently gained by knocking on the door 
and then forcing entrance when the occupant appears. 
Most residential robberies occur in the early evening when 
people are apt to be home. Victims are frequently bound 
and gagged or even tortured as the robber attempts to 
learn the location of valuables. In some cases, people are 
robbed because they arrive home to discover a burglary in 
progress. Th e burglar is thus “forced” to become a robber.
Hotel, motel, garage or elevator robberies are carried 
out rapidly and frequently involve injury. Information 
from employees that a person has a large amount of jew-
elry or money determines the victim for some robberies.
A type of residential robber challenging police depart-
ments across the country is the home invader. Home 
invaders usually target a resident, not a residence—often 
women, senior citizens or drug dealers.
Home invaders are typically young Asian gang members 
who travel across the country robbing Asian families, 
especially Asian business owners.

CHAPTER 12 | Robbery | 381
taxi companies have taken preventive steps such as plac-
ing protective shields between the passenger and driver 
and reducing the amount of cash that drivers carry. 
To reduce the amount of cash in the driver’s possession, 
buses in many cities require passengers to have the exact 
change or to purchase tokens or passes at a central hub or sat-
ellite transit stations. Delivery vehicle drivers may be robbed 
of their merchandise as they arrive for a delivery, or the rob-
bers may wait until after the delivery and take the cash.
Armored-car robberies are of special concern because 
they are usually well planned by professional, well-armed 
robbers and involve large amounts of money. According 
to the FBI, in 2006, there were 37 armored carrier inci-
dents with $4,158,127 in loot taken, most in the form of 
cash. Th irty-ﬁ ve percent of the loot was recovered (Bank 
Crime Statistics, 2006). One approach to this problem is 
to develop an intelligence network between the police 
department and the armored-car industry.
Drivers of personal cars are often approached in 
parking lots or while stopped at red lights in less-traveled 
areas. Th ese robberies are generally committed by teen-
agers. Drivers who pick up hitchhikers leave themselves 
open to robbery to assault and auto theft. Some robbers 
force people oﬀ  roads or set up fake accidents or injuries 
to lure motorists into stopping. A combination of street 
and vehicle-driver robbery that has increased drastically 
over the past few years is carjacking.
CARJACKING
Th is category of robbery appeared late in 1990 and has 
increased substantially: “Th ere are approximately 49,900 
which physical force is the weapon. Both the victim and the 
robber are usually on foot.
Speed and surprise typify street robberies, which are 
often crimes of opportunity with little or no advance plan-
ning. Because such robberies happen so fast, the victim is 
often unable to identify the robber. Sometimes the victim 
is approached from behind and never sees the attacker. 
Because most street robberies yield little money, the rob-
ber often commits several robberies in one night.
In areas with large inﬂ uxes of diverse groups of immi-
grants, especially undocumented ones, special problems 
occur. In Yonkers, New York, for example, numerous illegal 
immigrants from Mexico, Central America and South Amer-
ica are preyed upon by robbers. Because of their illegal status, 
few of these immigrants have Social Security numbers. With-
out these, they are unable to open bank accounts or be paid 
by check. Th erefore, they tend to carry large amounts of cash, 
sometimes their entire savings. Compounding the problem 
are the language barrier, fear and mistrust of police, fear of 
deportation and lack of understanding of the justice system.
VEHICLE-DRIVER ROBBERIES
Drivers of taxis, buses, trucks, delivery and messenger 
vehicles, armored trucks and personal cars are frequent 
targets of robbers. Indeed, “Driving a taxi is one of the 
most dangerous professions” (Petrocelli, 2007a, p.22). 
Taxi drivers are vulnerable because they are often alone 
while cruising for fares, work early mornings and late 
nights when fewer witnesses are likely to be present to 
assist or identify attackers, are dispatched to addresses 
in high-crime locations and may carry a lot of cash. Some 
Sometimes a robber will stage an 
auto accident or other incident to 
gain access to a victim. Here, a man 
rear-ended a car stopped at a red light 
and used the incident as an excuse 
to approach the car and engage 
its occupants. Her guard down, the 
passenger allows the attacker to get 
close enough to carry out a brutal 
assault before taking her purse and 
other valuables. Occasionally, this 
tactic is used by carjackers to gain 
possession of their targeted vehicle.

stolen vehicle is then used as in the conventional crime of 
vehicle theft: for resale, resale of parts, joyriding or use in 
committing another crime.
Th e motivation for carjacking is not clear because the 
vehicles are taken under so many diﬀ erent circumstances 
and for so many diﬀ erent reasons. One theory for the sud-
den increase is that the increased use of alarms and pro-
tective devices on vehicles, especially on more expensive 
ones, makes it more diﬃ  cult to steal a vehicle by tradi-
tional means. Car operators are easy prey compared with 
convenience stores or other commercial establishments 
that may have surveillance cameras and other security 
measures in eﬀ ect. Another theory suggests that status is 
involved: A criminal who carjacks a vehicle achieves higher 
status in the criminal subculture than does one who steals 
it in the conventional manner. And some police oﬃ  cers 
believe that the crime is becoming a fad among certain 
groups of young people as a way to enhance their image 
with their cohorts.
Carjackings have become a serious problem for police, 
who investigate them in the same way as other armed rob-
beries. Publication of prevention techniques has become 
standard policy for police agencies in an eﬀ ort to prevent 
property losses, injuries and deaths. Some agencies use 
decoys in an eﬀ ort to apprehend carjackers.
In October 1992, Congress passed, and President 
George H. W. Bush signed, the Anti-Car Th eft Act, mak-
ing armed carjacking a federal oﬀ ense. Under this law, 
automakers must engrave a 17-digit vehicle identiﬁ cation 
number on 24 parts of every new car.
In addition to knowing how robberies are generally 
classiﬁ ed, investigators must be familiar with the elements 
of the crime of robbery in their particular jurisdictions.
carjackings each year, with 8 out of 10 involving a weapon, 
usually a gun” (Jetmore, 2006, p.26). Carjackings often 
occur at gas stations, automatic teller machines (ATMs), 
car washes, parking lots, shopping centers, convenience 
stores, restaurants, train stations and parting control sig-
nals (Jetmore).
Carjacking, a category of robbery, is the taking of a 
motor vehicle by force or threat of force. The FBI may 
investigate the crime.
Th e force may consist of use of a handgun, simulated 
handgun, club, machete, axe, knife or ﬁ sts. Th e federal car-
jacking statute provides that a person possessing a ﬁ rearm 
who takes a motor vehicle from the person or presence of 
another by force and violence or by intimidation shall (1) 
be imprisoned not more than 15 years; (2) if serious bodily 
injury results, be imprisoned not more than 25 years; and 
(3) if death results, be imprisoned for any number of years 
up to life.
Nearly every major city has experienced armed car-
jacking oﬀ enses in suﬃ  ciently substantial numbers 
that the UCR may soon be required to use carjacking as 
a designation rather than report these crimes without 
uniformity as armed robbery, auto theft or some other 
oﬀ ense.
Carjackers use many ruses to engage a victim. Some 
stage accidents. Others wait for their victims at workplace 
parking lots or residential driveways.
Carjackings have resulted in car thefts, injuries and 
deaths. Initially, the more expensive vehicles were involved, 
but this trend now covers all types of motor vehicles. Th e

CHAPTER 12 | Robbery | 383
Because of the large sums of money involved, bank 
robberies are committed by rank amateurs as well as by 
habitual criminals. Amateurs are usually more dangerous 
because they are not as familiar with weapons and often 
are nervous and fearful. Weisel (2007, p.14) points out, 
To a great extent, robbers can be classiﬁ ed as amateur 
or professional based on known characteristics of the 
robbery—the number of oﬀ enders, use of weapons 
and disguises, eﬀ orts to defeat security, timing of the 
robbery, target selection, and means of getaway.
 
Bank robberies by amateurs are less successful: 
nearly one-third of all bank robberies by unarmed 
solitary oﬀ enders fail. Takeover robberies—those 
involving multiple armed oﬀ enders—are less common 
but more lucrative: losses in takeover robberies are 
10 times greater than average. . . .
 
Amateur bank robbers seek diﬀ erent targets from 
professionals and commit their oﬀ enses at diﬀ erent 
times. Solitary oﬀ enders tend to rob banks around mid-
day, when branches are full of customers; profession-
als, on the other hand, prefer to operate when there 
are fewer customers, such as at opening time, which 
increases their control of the crime scene. 
Table 12.1 summarizes the diﬀ erences between the ama-
teur and the professional bank robber.
Bank robbers often act alone inside the bank, but most 
have a getaway car with lookouts posted nearby. Th ese 
individuals pose additional problems for the approaching 
police. Th e robbery car often has stolen plates or is itself 
stolen. Robbers use this “hot” car to leave the robbery scene 
and to transport them and their loot to a “cold” car left a 
distance from the robbery. Even if only one robber has been 
reported at the scene, an armed accomplice may be nearby.
Th e number of bank robberies has increased with the 
number of branch banks, many of which are housed in 
storefront oﬃ  ces and outlying shopping centers, thus pro-
viding quick entrance to and exit from the robbery scene.
Adding clerks is not necessarily a deterrent because 
a person with a gun has the advantage regardless of the 
number of clerks. Adding bulletproof glass around the 
cashier may increase the incidence of hostage taking. Th is 
problem has been reduced in some banks by enclosing and 
securing the bank’s administrative areas.
Other deterrents to bank robberies involve the use 
of bait money and dye packs, required by federal bank-
ing regulations for federally insured ﬁ nancial institutions. 
Bait money is U.S. currency with recorded serial num-
bers placed at each teller position. A dye pack is a bundle 
of currency containing a colored dye and tear gas. Taken 
during a robbery, it is activated when the robber crosses 
an electromagnetic ﬁ eld at the facility’s exit, releasing the 
brightly colored dye that stains the money and emits a 
cloud of colored smoke.
BANK ROBBERY
“Bank robbery!” Th e call could mean a possible shootout 
or a hostage situation. Bank robbery is both a federal and 
a state oﬀ ense. U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2113, deﬁ nes 
the elements of the federal crime of bank robbery. Th is 
statute applies to robbery, burglary or larceny from any 
member bank of the Federal Reserve system, any bank 
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC), any bank organized and operated under the laws 
of the United States, any federal savings and loan associa-
tion or any federal credit union.
Bank robberies are within the jurisdictions of the FBI, 
the state and the community in which the crime occurred 
and are jointly investigated.
Most banks have surveillance cameras that might 
catch a robbery on tape. 
Technology Innovations
Hudson (2007, p.115) describes how searchable 
video surveillance helps catch robbers.
While surveillance systems have traditionally 
just recorded and stored footage—requiring 
investigators to sift through hour after hour of 
real-time video to ﬁ nd the event or suspect—new 
products have incorporated analytical tools like 
facial recognition and advanced video searching 
capabilities. Using technology similar to what 
made millions of Internet pages searchable, these 
systems make thousands of hours of video from 
geographically distributed locations searchable in 
minutes. . . .
In an example of using searchable surveil-
lance to investigate a crime, a bank robber pro-
duces a demand note. The robber, like 80 percent 
of all bank robbers, is low-key preferring to blend 
in as a typical customer. The bank’s cameras cap-
ture an image of his face. As soon as the bank’s 
investigator is notiﬁ ed of the robbery, he can pull 
up the video remotely in seconds and e-mail it to 
the FBI and local law enforcement agency. He 
can query all branches for the same suspect and 
discover that the suspect has been casing another 
branch several times in a nearby town.

384 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
4 A.M. Most involve robbing people of cash after they 
have made a withdrawal. Robberies are somewhat more 
likely to occur at walk-up ATMs than at drive-through 
ATMs. About 15 percent of victims are injured. Th e aver-
age loss is between $100 and $200” (Scott, p.4). Scott 
(pp.15–19) suggests the following responses to reduce 
ATM robberies:
• • Ensuring adequate lighting at and around ATMs
• • Ensuring that the landscaping around ATMs allows 
for good visibility
• • Installing rearview mirrors on ATMs
• • Installing ATMs where there is a lot of natural 
surveillance
• • Installing ATMs in police stations
Robberies at ATM Machines Bank robberies at ATMs 
are also of concern. Since their introduction in the United 
States during the late 1960s, ATMs have become a staple 
of the banking industry, facilitating billions of dollars in 
transactions every year (Petrocelli, 2007b, p.22). Brazen 
robbers wait nearby for people either on foot or in their 
vehicles to approach the ATM for a withdrawal. Th ese 
types of robberies tend to occur after dark in poorly lit 
areas but can occur any time of the day. 
Scott (2006, p.2) reports, “Th e best one can conclude 
is that the overall rate of ATM-related crime is some-
where between one per 1 million and one per 2.5 mil-
lion transactions, suggesting that such crime is relatively 
rare.” Th e most common ATM robbery pattern involves a 
lone, armed oﬀ ender against a lone victim: “Most occur 
at night, with the highest risk between midnight and

CHAPTER 12 | Robbery | 385
the case, however, because the victim may be locked in a 
separate room. For example, robbers often take victims to 
a separate room such as a restroom or a bank vault while 
they search for the desired items or cash. Such actions do 
not remove the crime “from the presence of the person” 
as long as the separation from the property is the direct 
result of force or threats of force used by the robber.
AGAINST THE PERSON’S WILL BY USE 
OF FORCE OR THREAT OF FORCE
Th is essential element clearly separates robbery from bur-
glary and larceny. As noted, most robberies are committed 
with a weapon or other dangerous device or by indicating 
that one is present. Th e force or threat is generally suf-
ﬁ cient to deter resistance. It can be immediate or threat-
ened in the future. It can be directed at the victim, the 
victim’s family or a person who is with the victim.
RESPONDING TO A ROBBERY 
IN PROGRESS CALL
“Acall blasts over the radio or comes across your
 mobile data terminal: ‘Robbery in progress!’ 
And as adrenaline shoots through your veins, tactics ﬂ y 
out the window” (Grossi, 2007, p.24). Grossi suggests 
that oﬃ  cers anticipate the unexpected and assume the 
worst. He also suggests considering using silent response 
and invisible deployment tactics. Th e possibility exists 
that the robbers have ﬂ ed the scene, in which case it is 
important to notice vehicle traﬃ  c moving away from the 
scene. 
SPECIAL CHALLENGES 
IN INVESTIGATION
Jetmore (2008, p.28) notes, “Th e work required 
  to put a robbery case together is very time 
consuming.” As a violent crime, robbery introduces chal-
lenges that require special attention from the dispatcher, 
patrol oﬃ  cers, investigators and police administrators. 
Th ree major problems occur in dealing with robberies: 
(1) Th ey are usually not reported until the oﬀ enders have 
left the scene, (2) it is diﬃ  cult to obtain good descriptions 
or positive identiﬁ cation from victims and (3) the items 
taken, usually currency, are diﬃ  cult to identify.
• • Relocating, closing or limiting the hours of operation 
of ATMs at high-risk sites
• • Providing ATM users with safety tips
• • Installing and monitoring surveillance cameras at and 
around ATMs
• • Installing devices to allow victims to summon police 
during a robbery
Having looked at the various forms of robbery, consider 
now the elements that must be present and proven in any 
type of robbery.
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME: 
ROBBERY
State statutes deﬁ ne robbery precisely. Although 
 the general public tends to use the term rob-
bery interchangeably with burglary, larceny and theft, the 
speciﬁ c elements of robbery clearly distinguish it from 
these oﬀ enses. A businessman might say that his store 
was robbed when, in fact, it was burglarized. A woman 
may have money taken from her purse at work while she 
is busy waiting on customers and say that she was robbed 
when, legally, the crime was larceny. Such thefts are not 
robbery because the necessary elements are not present.
Some states have only one degree of robbery. Others 
have both simple and aggravated robbery. Still others have 
robbery in the ﬁ rst, second and third degree. However, in 
most state statutes common elements exist.
The elements of the crime of robbery are
• • the wrongful taking of personal property,
• • from the person or in the person’s presence,
• • against the person’s will by force or threat of force.
WRONGFUL TAKING OF PERSONAL PROPERTY
Various statutes use phrases such as unlawful taking, felo-
nious taking and knowing he is not entitled thereto. Intent 
is an element of the crime in some, but not all, states. To 
take “wrongfully,” the robber must have no legal right to 
the property. Moreover, property must be personal prop-
erty, as distinguished from real property.
FROM THE PERSON OR IN THE PRESENCE 
OF THE PERSON
In most cases, in the presence of a person means that the 
victim sees the robber take the property. Th is is not always 

386 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
Oﬃ  cers should observe all vehicles as they approach 
a robbery scene. Whether to use red lights and sirens 
depends on the information received from dispatch. It is 
often best to arrive quietly to prevent the taking of hos-
tages. If shooting is occurring, using lights and siren may 
cause the robber to leave before police arrive.
If police could check every license plate within the 
containment circle to see whether it was on a stolen car, 
and then accumulate that information, they might iden-
tify serial robbers. 
When responding to a robbery-in-progress call,
• • Proceed as rapidly as possible, but use extreme 
caution.
• • Assume that the robber is at the scene, unless 
otherwise advised.
• • Be prepared for gunﬁ re.
• • Look for and immobilize any getaway vehicle you 
discover.
• • Avoid a hostage situation if possible.
• • Make an immediate arrest if the suspect is at the 
scene.
Oﬃ  cers should guard against the dangers inherent in 
stereotyping when responding to robberies in progress. 
For example, an oﬃ  cer responding to a robbery alarm at a 
convenience store, expecting to see a young male running 
from the scene, sees a young female walking calmly from 
the store, and after she passes the oﬃ  cer (who is ignor-
ing her), she shoots him in the back because she was the 
robber. (Th is scenario could apply to an elderly person, a 
disabled person or other assumed nonsuspect.)
Upon arrival at a robbery scene, attempt to locate any 
vehicle that the suspects might use, even if you have no 
description of it. It will probably be within a block of the 
crime scene, and its engine may be running. It generally 
has a person in it (the “wheelman,” or lookout) waiting for 
the robber to return. If the vehicle is identiﬁ ed through 
prior information and is empty, immobilize it by remov-
ing the distributor cap or letting the air out of a tire. If a 
cohort is waiting in the car, arrest the person and then 
immobilize the vehicle.
Decide whether to enter the robbery location immedi-
ately or to wait until suﬃ  cient personnel are in position. 
Department policy determines whether it is an immedi-
ate or a timed response. Too early an entry increases the 
chances of a hostage situation or of having to use weap-
ons. Th e general rule is to avoid a confrontation if it will 
create a worse situation than the robbery itself.
If you arrive at the robbery scene and ﬁ nd a suspect 
there with the victim, surround the building and order the 
suspect to come out. Get other people in the area to leave 
The speed of a robbery, its potential for violence and the 
taking of hostages and the usual lack of evidence at the 
scene pose special challenges for investigators.
Police response time can be reduced if the robbed 
business or residence has an alarm system connected to 
the police department or a private alarm agency. Silent 
alarms can provide an early response, and audible alarms 
sometimes prevent a robbery. Th e “lag-time”—that is, the 
elapsed time between the commission of a robbery and 
the time the police are notiﬁ ed—is usually much longer 
than the actual police response time.
A robbery-in-progress call involves an all-units 
response, with units close to the scene going there directly 
while other units cover the area near the scene, looking for 
a possible getaway vehicle. Other cars go to checkpoints 
such as bridges, converging highways, freeway entry and 
exit ramps, dead-end streets and alleys.
Technology Innovations
Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) can 
be of great assistance in identifying a stolen vehicle 
that might be serving as a getaway car (Molnar, 2007, 
pp.20–23).
While the technology may sound like something 
out of Star Wars, the reality is that automatic 
license plate recognition (ALPR) is already a 
reality in patrol cars across the country, and it’s 
proving very effective in apprehending all types 
of criminals.
According to PlateScan [a leader in ALPR], 
ALPR technology was developed in response to a 
number of high-proﬁ le terrorist attacks in the UK in 
the early 1990s. The system was designed to detect 
use of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices 
before they reached their intended targets. . . 
The result was a virtual ring of steel around cit-
ies like London, with many criminals detected and 
apprehended.
As the system reads a license plate, it com-
pares the plate to the database. If it makes a hit, 
it alerts the operator. . . . The addition of a sepa-
rate color camera allows the capture of vehicle 
description, make, model, color, damage, unique 
characteristics, etc. to the data base. In other 
words, you get the complete picture of the vehicle, 
not just the plate.

CHAPTER 12 | Robbery | 387
negotiation: “Are SWAT guys with big guns out there?” 
the subject may be very anxious to know. Assure the sub-
ject, “Sure, but they do what I tell them.”
Th e need for negotiation is based on the principle 
that the main priority is to preserve life—that of the hos-
tages or the hostage takers, as well as of police or inno-
cent bystanders. SWAT teams or expert sharpshooters 
are often at or near the scene but do not participate in 
negotiations and in some cases are not visible except as 
a last resort. Figure 12.2 illustrates the typical emotions 
hostage takers experience during negotiations.
Usually you do not need to rush into the scene immedi-
ately and proceed with direct contact. In a few cases, it may 
be better not to do anything, but to let the hostage taker 
resolve the situation. To its advantage, passage of time can
• • Provide the opportunity for face-to-face contact with 
the hostage taker.
• • Allow the negotiator to attempt to establish a trustful 
rapport.
• • Permit mental, emotional and physical fatigue to 
operate against the hostage taker.
• • Increase the hostage taker’s needs for food, water, 
sleep and elimination.
• • Increase the possibility of the hostage taker’s reducing 
demands to reasonable compliance levels.
• • Allow hostage-escape possibilities to occur.
• • Provide for more rational thinking, in contrast to the 
emotionalism usually present during the initial stage 
of the crime.
• • Lessen the hostage taker’s anxiety and reduce 
his or her adrenalin ﬂ ow, allowing more rational 
negotiations.
because of possible gunﬁ re. Know the operational limita-
tions imposed by the number of oﬃ  cers and the amount 
of equipment available at the scene. Take advantage of 
vehicles and buildings in the area for cover.
Because the robber is committing a violent crime and 
is usually armed, expect that the robber may use a weapon 
against the police and that a hostage may be taken.
HOSTAGE SITUATIONS
Massock (2008, p.66) explains, “Crisis negotiation is a 
complex discipline. Negotiating with an armed barricaded 
person holding hostages can be a prolonged and stress-
ful event.” Th e priorities in a hostage situation are to (1) 
preserve life, (2) apprehend the hostage taker and (3) 
recover or protect property. Accomplishing these priori-
ties requires specialized training in hostage situations. It 
also requires that the media be dealt with eﬀ ectively.
In general, direct assault should be considered only if 
there has already been a killing or if further negotiations 
would be useless. Hostage situations may last for less than 
an hour or for more than 40 hours; the average length is 
approximately 12 hours.
However, this approach may result in conﬂ ict within 
the department between special weapons and tactics 
(SWAT) teams and crisis negotiation teams (CNTs). 
SWATs are action oriented, whereas CNTs are communi-
cation-oriented. Both types of team have a common goal 
but use a diﬀ erent approach. In reality, to successfully 
resolve a hostage situation, both teams must often work 
together. A successful hostage-incident outcome is not 
possible without a well-coordinated strategy.
Negotiators’ biggest task is to convince subjects that 
no harm will come to them if they cooperate with the

388 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
Most instances involving negotiations lend them-
selves to general guidelines but are also unique. Decisions 
have to be made based on the immediate factors involved. 
In the vast majority of cases, eﬀ ectively handled negotia-
tions can resolve the situation without injury or death.
If a robber emerges on request or is already outside 
the building, he or she should be immediately arrested. 
Th e victim and any witnesses should make a ﬁ eld iden-
tiﬁ cation, and then the suspect should be removed from 
the scene.
A wounded suspect presents an especially dangerous 
situation. Oﬃ  cers should be alert to the possibility that a 
suspect is feigning more serious injury than exists to draw 
them oﬀ  guard and get them close enough to be shot. 
Suspects should be covered at all times and immobilized 
with handcuﬀ s as soon as possible. If a suspect is seriously 
injured, an armed escort should accompany the robber in 
the ambulance and take a dying declaration if necessary. 
If the suspect is killed, the coroner or medical examiner is 
notiﬁ ed.
In a successfully resolved hostage situation, the rob-
ber is apprehended and the case is closed. In most robber-
ies, however, an investigation is required.
THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
Frequently, oﬃ  cers arriving at the scene of a 
  robbery ﬁ nd that the robber has just ﬂ ed. After 
taking care of emergencies, broadcast initial information 
about the suspect, the getaway vehicle and the direction 
of travel. Follow-up vehicles dispatched to the general 
area of the robbery can then attempt to apprehend the 
escaping robbers. Early information helps determine how 
far the suspect may have traveled and the most likely 
escape routes.
Robbery usually leaves victims and witnesses feeling 
vulnerable and fearful, making it diﬃ  cult for them to give 
accurate descriptions and details of what occurred. Be 
patient.
Witnesses to a robbery suﬀ er varying degrees of 
trauma even though they have not lost any property. Th ey 
may have had to lie on the ﬂ oor or been placed in a locked 
room or a bank vault, possibly fearing that the robber 
would return and kill them. Th eir ability to recall precise 
details is further impaired by the suddenness of the crime. 
Victims and witnesses may be asked to complete a form 
such as the one in Figures 12.3A and 12.3B.
• • Allow for important intelligence gathering concerning 
the hostage taker, hostages, layout, protection barri-
ers and needed police reinforcement.
A disadvantage of the passage of time is that it could 
possibly foster the Stockholm syndrome, by which hostages 
begin to identify with their captors and sympathize with 
them. Th e Stockholm syndrome occurs when hostages 
report that they have no ill feelings toward the hostage 
takers and, further, that they feared the police more than 
they feared their captors.
Th e negotiator should have street knowledge and 
experience with hostage incidents. Sometimes the ﬁ rst 
oﬃ  cers at the scene have established rapport with the 
hostage taker, and the negotiator only advises. In some 
cases, a trained clinical psychologist may be called to the 
scene, not as a negotiator but as a consultant regarding 
possible behavioral deviations of the hostage taker.
Face-to-face negotiations are ideal because they pro-
vide the best opportunity for gathering knowledge about 
and personally observing the hostage taker’s reactions. 
Such contact should be undertaken only if circumstances 
indicate that the negotiator will not be in danger. An alter-
native is telephone contact, allowing for personal conver-
sation and establishing rapport without the dangers of 
face-to-face contact. Use of a bullhorn is not the personal 
type of communication desired—nonetheless, it may be 
the only available method of communication.
Negotiable items may include food and drink (but 
not liquor, unless it is known that liquor would lessen 
the hostage taker’s anxieties rather than increase them), 
money, media access and reduced penalties. Transporta-
tion is generally not negotiable because of the diﬃ  culty in 
monitoring and controlling the situation. Police depart-
ments should establish policies regarding hostage nego-
tiations in advance. In general, nothing should be granted 
to a hostage taker unless something is received in return. 
Complicating the situation may be that the hostage taker 
is alcohol or drug impaired.
When criminals caught in the act of robbery take hos-
tages, it is usually a spontaneous reaction to being cor-
nered, and they know what to expect from the police. Th ey 
generally desire media attention or want to escape safely 
from the crime scene. Th ey may ask for more money to 
prove they are serious. Law enforcement response will 
invariably ensure safe apprehension of the criminal in 
return for release of the hostages. Th ere are other types 
of hostage situations—for instance, involving terrorists, 
mentally disturbed persons, prisoners and the like—but 
the motives of the hostage taker and guidelines for action 
require handling consistent with the characteristics of 
those situations.

away from the lawful owner or possessor to permanently 
deprive the owner of the property. Prove that the robber 
had no legal right to the property taken.
Determine the legal owner of the property taken. 
Describe completely the property and its value.
Who is the legal owner? Take statements from the vic-
tim to show legal possession and control of the property 
before and during the robbery.
Was property taken or intended to be taken? Obtain 
a complete description of the property and its value, 
PROVING THE ELEMENTS OF 
THE OFFENSE
Know the elements of robbery in your jurisdiction 
  so you can determine whether a robbery has in 
fact been committed. Each element must be proven sepa-
rately. Proving only some of the elements is not suﬃ  cient.

Was Property Taken from the Person or in the 
Person’s Presence? From the person or in the presence 
of the person necessitates proving that the property was 
under the victim’s control before the robbery and was 
removed from the victim’s control by the robber’s direct 
actions.
Record the exact words, gestures, motions or actions the 
robber used to gain control of the property.
Answer such questions as these: Where was the prop-
erty before it was taken? Where was the victim?
including marks, serial numbers, operation identiﬁ cation 
number (if available), color, size and any other identifying 
characteristics.
Obtain proof of what was lost and its value. In a bank 
robbery, the bank manager or auditor can give an accu-
rate accounting of the money taken. In a store robbery, 
any responsible employee can help determine the loss. 
Cash-register receipts, sales receipts, quotations of retail 
and wholesale prices, reasonable estimates by people in 
the same business or the estimate of an independent 
appraiser can help determine the amount of the loss. In 
robberies of the person, the victim determines the loss. 
Some robbery victims claim to have lost more or less than 
was actually taken, thus complicating the case.

CHAPTER 12 | Robbery | 391
Prepare your report carefully and thoroughly and 
circulate it to any oﬃ  cers who may assist. Even if you do 
not apprehend your suspect, the suspect may be appre-
hended during a future robbery, and his or her MO and 
other evidence may implicate him or her in the robbery 
you investigated.
IDENTIFYING THE SUSPECT
Th e various techniques used in suspect identiﬁ cation 
 (discussed in Chapter 7) are relevant at this point.
Obtain information about the suspect’s general 
appearance, clothing, disguises, weapon and vehicle.
If the suspect is apprehended within a short time (20 
minutes or so), he or she may be taken back to the scene 
for identiﬁ cation by the victim. Alternatively, the victim 
may be taken to where the suspect is being held. Several 
people should be in the area of the suspect to witness that 
the victim makes any identiﬁ cation without assistance 
from the police. Photo lineups may be used if no suspect 
is arrested at or near the scene of the crime. Photo lineups 
should include ﬁ ve other people in addition to the sus-
pect. A person who has been arrested does not have the 
right to refuse to have a photo taken.
Eyewitness identiﬁ cation is aﬀ ected by many factors: 
the distance between the witness and the suspect at the 
time of the robbery, the time of day and lighting condi-
tions, the amount of violence involved, whether the wit-
ness had ever seen or knew the suspect and the time it 
took for the crime to be committed.
Disguises To conceal their identities, many robbers 
use ski masks, nylon stockings pulled over their heads or 
paper sacks with eyeholes. Other disguises include wigs, 
dyed hair, sideburns, scarves, various types of false noses 
or ears and makeup to alter appearance. Gauze is some-
times used to distort the shape of the cheeks or mouth 
and tape is used to simulate cuts or to cover scars.
Clothing also can serve as a disguise. Collars can be 
pulled up and hats pulled down. False heels and soles can 
increase height. Various types of uniforms that ﬁ t in with 
the area of the robbery scene, such as delivery uniforms or 
work clothes, have been used.
Clothing and disguises may be discarded by the rob-
ber upon leaving the scene and are valuable evidence if 
discovered because they may provide DNA evidence.
Weapons Pistols, revolvers and automatic weapons are 
frequently used in robberies. Sawed-oﬀ  shotguns, riﬂ es, 
Against the Person’s Will by Force or the Threat of 
Force? By force or the threat of force may be the most 
diﬃ  cult element to establish. If the victim perceived a 
threat, it is real.
Obtain a complete description of the robber’s words, 
actions and any weapon used or threatened to be used.
If nothing was said, ﬁ nd out what gestures, motions 
or other actions compelled the victim to give up the 
property.
Th e force need not be directly against the robbery 
victim. For example, a woman may receive a call at work, 
telling her that her husband is a hostage and will be 
killed unless she brings money to a certain location, or 
the robber may grab a friend of the victim or a customer 
in a store and direct the victim to hand over money to 
protect the person being held from harm.
Describe any injuries to the victim or witnesses. 
Photograph them, if possible, and have them examined 
by a doctor, emergency room personnel or ambulance 
paramedics.
THE COMPLETE 
INVESTIGATION
Most robberies are solved through prompt 
  actions by the victim, witnesses and the police 
patrolling the immediate area or by police at checkpoints. 
In many cases, however, a robbery investigation takes 
weeks or even months. Begin your investigation with an 
immediate canvass of the neighborhood because the sus-
pect may be hiding in a parked car, in a gas station rest-
room or on the roof of a building. Check motels and hotels 
in the area. If another city is nearby, check the motels 
there. Look for discarded property such as the weapon, a 
wallet, money bag or other items taken from victims. 
Check car rental agencies if no vehicle was reported sto-
len. Check airports, bus and train stations and taxi com-
panies for possible links.
Recheck all information and physical descriptions. 
Have a sketch of the suspect prepared and circulate it. Alert 
your informants to listen for word of the robbery. Check 
known “fences.” Check MO ﬁ les. Where applicable, check 
police ﬁ eld-interview/contact forms and communications 
records relating to recent citizen calls complaining about 
suspicious people or vehicles in the area of the robbery.

392 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
 surveillance camera is operating. Th e ﬁ lm can be processed 
immediately and used as evidence.
Physical evidence that can connect a suspect with a 
robbery includes ﬁ ngerprints, shoe prints, tire prints, 
restraining devices, discarded garments, ﬁ bers and hairs, 
a note and the stolen property.
Fingerprints may be found at the scene if the suspect 
handled any objects, on the holdup note if one was left 
behind, on the getaway car or on recovered property. Th ey 
might also be found on pieces of tape used as restraints, 
which in themselves are valuable as evidence.
In one residential robbery, the criminal forced entrance 
into a home, bound and gagged the residents, stole several 
items of value and then left. As he backed up to turn his 
car around, he inadvertently left the impression of the 
vehicle’s license plate clearly imprinted on a snow bank. 
He was apprehended within hours of the robbery.
MAPPING ROBBERY
Because robbery is inherently serial, mapping it has proven 
successful. Th e Charlotte-Mecklenburg (North Carolina) 
Police Department used mapping to address an increase 
in robbery victimization among Charlotte’s growing His-
panic population.
Oﬃ  cers used the Global Information Software (GIS) 
mapping capabilities in the department’s Crime Analysis 
Unit to map all robbery incidents with Hispanic victims 
citywide. Overlaying the maps revealed a close correla-
tion between Hispanic robbery incidents and areas of 
high concentrations of Hispanic residents. Mapping nar-
rowed the problem to robberies of Hispanic victims in the 
apartment complexes where they lived. It then identiﬁ ed 
a particular complex, the Park Apartments, that was a 
hot spot for the robberies. Th is complex consisted of 51 
buildings with approximately 2,000 residents. Hispanics 
constituted 49 percent of the complex population but 64 
percent of its robbery victims. Th e analysis then identi-
ﬁ ed a number of factors that increased the risk of robbery, 
including the fact that victims often carried large sums of 
money instead of using banks, that poor lighting and poor 
security made robberies easy to commit and that partly 
because of language barriers the police had done little 
community outreach.
In cooperation with complex managers, police oﬃ  -
cers addressed the identiﬁ ed physical factors. In addi-
tion to improving lighting, they restricted access to the 
apartment grounds and to the high-risk laundry area. An 
enforcement component with the department’s robbery 
air guns, various types of imitation guns, knives, razors 
and other cutting and stabbing instruments, explosives, 
tear gas, and various acids have also been used. Such 
weapons and devices are often found on or near the sus-
pect when arrested, but many are hidden in the vehicle 
used or are thrown away during the escape. Robbery vic-
tims are the most likely of all victims of violent crime to 
face an armed oﬀ ender.
Vehicles Most vehicles used in robberies are incon-
spicuous, popular makes that attract no attention and 
are stolen just before the robbery. Some robbers leave the 
scene on foot and then take buses or taxis or commandeer 
vehicles, sometimes at gunpoint.
ESTABLISHING THE MODUS OPERANDI
Even if the suspect is apprehended at the scene, the MO 
can help link the suspect with other robberies.
Important MO information includes
• • Type of robbery
• • Time (day and hour)
• • Method of attack (real or threatened)
• • Weapon
• • Number of robbers
• • Voice and words
• • Vehicle used
• • Peculiarities
• • Object sought
Finding that an MO matches a previous robbery does 
not necessarily mean that the same robber committed the 
crime. For example, in one instance three masked gun-
men robbed a midwestern bank of more than $45,000 and 
escaped in a stolen car. Th e MO matched a similar robbery 
in the same town a few weeks earlier in which $30,000 was 
obtained. Th e three gunmen were identiﬁ ed and arrested 
the next day, and more than $41,000 of the loot was recov-
ered. One gunman told the FBI agent that he planned the 
robbery after reading about the successful bank robbery 
that three other masked gunmen had pulled oﬀ . Th e FBI 
agent smiled and informed the robber that the perpetra-
tors had been arrested shortly after the robbery. Aghast, 
the copycat robber bemoaned the fact that he had seen no 
publicity on the arrest.
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Physical evidence at a robbery scene is usually mini-
mal. Sometimes, however, the robbery occurs where a 

CHAPTER 12 | Robbery | 393
• • An unusual delay in reporting the oﬀ ense
• • An amount of the loss not ﬁ tting the victim’s appar-
ent ﬁ nancial status
• • A lack of correspondence with the physical evidence
• • Improbable events
• • An exceptionally detailed or exceptionally vague 
description of oﬀ ender
• • A lack of cooperation
unit worked to arrest several suspects. Oﬃ  cers also built 
relationships with the residents to increase their willing-
ness to report crime.
FALSE ROBBERY REPORTS
Investigators need to rule out the probability 
  that a robbery report is false. Among the indi-
cators of a false robbery report are

394 | SECTION 3 | Investigating Violent Crimes
• • Was the place that was robbed protected by an alarm? 
Was the alarm working?
• • Was the place that was robbed protected by a surveil-
lance camera? Was the camera working? Was the ﬁ lm 
immediately removed and processed?
• • What procedure did police use in responding to the 
call? Did they enter directly? To avoid a hostage 
situation, did they wait until the robber had left?
• • Did police interview separately everyone in the robbed 
place? Did they obtain written statements from each?
• • Are all elements of the crime of robbery present?
• • How was the robber dressed? Was a disguise used?
• • What were the robber’s exact words and actions?
• • What type of weapon or threat did the robber use?
• • Was anybody injured or killed?
• • Was there a getaway car? description? direction of 
travel? a second person in the car?
• • Was a general description of people and vehicles 
involved quickly broadcast to other police agencies?
• • Did police secure and photograph the scene?
• • What property was taken in the robbery? What was its 
value?
• • Who is the legal owner?
• • If a bank was robbed, were the FBI and state oﬃ  cials 
notiﬁ ed?
• • If the suspect was arrested, how was identiﬁ cation 
made?
• • If money or property was recovered, was it properly 
processed?
Read the following account of an actual robbery investi-
gation. As you read, list the steps the investigators took. 
Review the list and determine whether they took all nec-
essary steps. (Adapted from a report by Captain Raymond 
J. Eagan, New Haven, Connecticut.)
On December 16, close to midnight, a woman looked 
in the window of the grocery store owned by Eﬁ my 
Romanow at 187 Ashmun Street, New Haven, Con-
necticut, and saw Romanow lying behind the counter 
with the telephone receiver clutched in his right hand. 
Th inking Romanow was sick, the woman notiﬁ ed a 
neighbor, Th omas Kelly, who went to the store and 
then called an ambulance. Romanow was pronounced 
dead on arrival at the hospital.
 
Autopsy revealed he had been shot near the heart. 
Th e bullet was removed and turned over to detectives, 
who immediately began an investigation. Oﬃ  cers pro-
tected the crime scene and made a thorough search for 
possible prints and other evidence. Th ey found a small 
amount of money in the cash register. At the hospital, 
APPLICATION
Robbery is the felonious taking of another’s property from 
his or her person or in his or her presence through force or 
intimidation. Robberies are classiﬁ ed as either residential, 
commercial, street or vehicle driver. 
 
A relatively new type of residential robber is the home 
invader. Home invaders are typically young Asian gang mem-
bers who travel across the country robbing Asian families, 
especially Asian business owners. Th e FBI and state and local 
law enforcement personnel jointly investigate bank robberies. 
Another category is carjacking—the taking of a motor vehicle 
by force or threat of force. Th e FBI may investigate carjacking.
 
Bank robberies are within the jurisdictions of the FBI, 
the state and the community in which the crime occurred 
and are jointly investigated. Th e elements of robbery are 
(1) the wrongful taking of personal property, (2) from the 
person or in the person’s presence, (3) against the per-
son’s will by force or threat of force.
 
Th e rapidity of a robbery, its potential for violence 
and the taking of hostages and the usual lack of evidence 
at the scene pose special challenges. When responding to 
a robbery-in-progress call, proceed as rapidly as possible 
but use extreme caution. Assume that the robber is at the 
scene unless otherwise advised, and be prepared for gun-
ﬁ re. Look for and immobilize any getaway vehicle you dis-
cover. Avoid a hostage situation if possible, and make an 
immediate arrest if the situation warrants.
 
Prove each element of robbery separately. To prove 
that personal property was wrongfully taken, determine the 
legal owner of the property and describe the property and its 
value completely. To prove that it was taken from the person 
or in the person’s presence, record the exact words, gestures, 
motions or actions the robber used to gain control of the 
property. To prove that the removal was against the victim’s 
will by force or threat of force, obtain a complete description 
of the robber’s words, actions and any weapon the robber 
used or threatened to use. Obtain information about the sus-
pect’s general appearance, clothing, disguises and vehicle.
 
Important MO information includes type of robbery, 
time (day and hour), method of attack (real or threatened), 
weapon, object sought, number of robbers, voice and words, 
vehicle, any peculiarities and object sought. Physical evidence 
that can connect the suspect with a robbery includes ﬁ nger-
prints, shoe prints, tire prints, restraining devices, discarded 
garments, ﬁ bers and hairs, a note and the stolen property.

SUMMARY
CHECKLIST

CHAPTER 12 | Robbery | 395
Romanow. He explained that they had to shoot 
Romanow because he refused to give up his money and 
placed himself between them and the door. In order to 
get out, he shot Romanow. Both stated that they had 
no car and that no one else was involved.
 
A preliminary examination of the bullet taken from 
Romanow’s body did not satisfy the detectives that the 
bullet had been ﬁ red from the gun in their possession, 
even though it had been identiﬁ ed by both Almeda and 
Scott as the one used.
 
A detective took the gun and bullet to the FBI 
Technical Laboratory in Washington, DC, where a 
ballistics comparison established that the gun fur-
nished for examination was not the gun that ﬁ red the 
fatal bullet. A search of the Technical Laboratory ﬁ les 
revealed that the gun matched a bullet furnished by the 
same department as evidence in a holdup of Levine’s 
Liquor Store on December 1 of that year. One shot 
had been ﬁ red, striking a chair and deﬂ ecting into a 
pile of rubbish in the rear of the store. Th e bullet had 
been recovered by detectives after sifting through the 
rubbish.
 
When confronted with this information, Scott and 
Almeda admitted that they had committed this holdup 
and shooting while masked. Th ey also admitted that 
they had stolen an automobile to use that night and 
that they had burglarized Harrell’s home in November, 
when they took the gun.
 
Th e detectives conducted an extensive search for 
the gun used in killing Romanow. Th ey cut a hole in the 
bottom of the ﬂ ue leading from the room occupied by 
Scott and Almeda and even had the sewer department 
clean out 15 sewer catch basins in the area of the crime, 
but no weapon was discovered.
 
Both Almeda and Scott were indicted by the grand 
jury for ﬁ rst-degree murder. Th ey were scheduled for 
trial February 13. Th e night before the trial was to 
begin, they told their lawyers that a third man had fur-
nished the gun and driven the getaway car. In a confer-
ence with the state attorney and detectives, the lawyers 
identiﬁ ed the third man as William Sutton. Within half 
an hour, Sutton was apprehended and brought to the 
state attorney’s oﬃ  ce where, in the presence of Scott 
and Almeda, their statements were read to Sutton. He 
admitted participating in the crime.
 
Th is new turn in the case also revealed that the gun 
used in the killing was loaned to Sutton by John Foy. 
Th e morning after the shooting, Sutton brought the 
gun back to Foy and left it with him. A short time later 
Sutton returned and asked for the gun. He had decided 
he should get rid of it because it was hot. Sutton then 
took the cylinder from the gun while Foy broke the rest 
of it into small parts, which he threw in various places. 
Foy, who admitted he knew the gun was to be used in a 
holdup, was charged with conspiracy.
 
Sutton, Almeda, and Scott pled guilty to second-de-
gree murder and received life sentences in the Connect-
icut State Prison. Foy received a one-year jail sentence.
$15.50 was found in Romanow’s pockets, and $313 in 
bills was found in his right shoe. A thorough check of 
neighborhood homes was made without result. One 
report received was that two white men were seen leav-
ing the store before Romanow’s body was discovered.
 
About 7 A.M., December 17, Mrs. Marion Lang, 
who lived directly opposite the store but was not home 
when the oﬃ  cers ﬁ rst went there, was contacted. She 
stated that at about 11:10 P.M. she had heard loud talk-
ing in the street, including the remark, “Damn it, he is 
shot, let’s get out of here.” She had not looked out the 
window, so she was unable to describe the people she 
had heard talking.
 
Th e investigation continued without any tangible 
clues until 9:25 P.M., December 17, when a phone call 
was received from George M. Proctor, owner of a drug-
store on a street parallel to Ashmun Street and one 
block away. He had just overheard a woman talking in 
the phone booth in his store say, “I will not stand for 
her taking my fellow away. I know who shot the store-
keeper on Ashmun. It was Scotty and Almeda at 17 
Dixwell.” Mr. Proctor did not know the woman he had 
overheard.
 
Two detectives were assigned to this lead, and 
they began a search. A few hours later, they learned 
that Scotty and Almeda were in a room at 55 Dixwell 
Avenue. Arriving with several uniformed oﬃ  cers, they 
entered and found Francis Scott and Henry Almeda in 
bed with their clothes on. Both had previous records 
and were well known to the local police. Th e detectives 
took the two men to headquarters for questioning and 
then returned to the room. Th eir search revealed ﬁ ve 
.32 caliber bullets at the top of a window casing where 
plaster had been broken up.
 
Th ey also received information that Scott and 
Almeda had earlier visited Julia Redmond, who had 
a room in the same house. Th ey asked Ms. Redmond 
if Scott and Almeda had left anything there. She 
responded, “Th ey put something under the mattress.” 
Turning over the mattress, the detectives found a .32 
caliber Harrington and Richardson revolver, serial 
number 430-087. Ms. Redmond said, “Th at belongs to 
Scott and Almeda.”
 
Th e detectives returned to headquarters and 
searched the stolen gun ﬁ les. Th ey discovered that this 
gun had been reported stolen in a burglary at the home 
of Geoﬀ rey Harrell, 46 Webster Street, in November. 
Both suspects were questioned during the night and 
denied any part in the shooting.
 
Th e questioning resumed on the morning of 
December 18 at 9:00 A.M. At 3:45 P.M. that day, 
Almeda broke and made a confession in which he 
involved Scott. Almeda’s statement was read to Scott 
with Almeda present. When Almeda identiﬁ ed the con-
fession and stated it was true, Scott also admitted his 
part in the shooting.
 
When Almeda was shown the .32 caliber H&R 
revolver, he identiﬁ ed it as the gun used in shooting

ost of the crimes discussed in this section 
do not involve the use of force or violence 
against people and therefore are often not consid-
ered as serious as assault, robbery, rape or murder. 
However, according to various ofﬁ cial reports, crimes 
against property occur much more frequently than do 
crimes against persons. FBI statistics (Crime in the 
United States, 2006) report an estimated 9,983,568 
property crimes in the nation during 2006. The 2- and 
10-year trends showed that the number of property 
crimes declined 1.9 percent from 2005 and 13.6 percent 
from 1997. (See Table IV.1.)
 
The rate of property offenses in 2006 was 3,334.5 per 
100,000 inhabitants. Two thirds of all property crimes 
were larceny/theft (the focus of Chapter 14). Property 
crimes accounted for an estimated $17.6 billion in 
losses in 2006.
 
In 2006, according to the FBI, a crime against prop-
erty occurred every 3.0 seconds in the United States:
• • One larceny/theft every 4.8 seconds
• • One burglary every 14.4 seconds
• • One motor vehicle theft every 26.4 seconds
M
 
Figures from the National Crime Victimization Sur-
vey (NCVS) are much higher, showing 138,520 personal 
thefts and 12 million property crimes (Rand and 
Catalano, 2007). The property crime rate was 159.1 per 
1,000 households. Property crime rates in urban and 
suburban areas were stable between 2005 and 2006. 
According to the NCVS, only 38 percent of property 
crimes are reported to police.
 
Many property crimes are difﬁ cult to investigate 
because there is little evidence and there are usually 
no eyewitnesses. Physical evidence in property crimes 
is often similar to that found in violent crimes: ﬁ nger-
prints, footprints, tire impressions, hair, ﬁ bers, broken 
glass and personal objects left at the crime scene. 
Other important evidence in crimes against property 
includes tools, tool fragments, tool marks, safe insu-
lation, disturbance of paint and evidence of forcible 
entry. The modus operandi of a property crime often 
takes on added importance because there are no other 
signiﬁ cant leads. In addition, crimes against property 
tend to occur in series, so solving one crime may lead 
to solving an entire series of similar crimes.

n a western city, police oﬃ  cers noticed what they believed was safe 
insulation on the steps of a cabin occupied by a known burglar. Th ey 
obtained a warrant and searched the premises for evidence of a burglary. Th e 
substance found on the steps and some burglary tools found inside the home were 
mailed to a laboratory, where the substance was conﬁ rmed as safe insulation. Th e 
suspect was arrested and convicted of burglary. On appeal, the courts held that 
such knowledge by the oﬃ  cers was in eﬀ ect an extension of the laboratory and was 
therefore probable cause even without the laboratory examination. Th e veriﬁ cation

(Crime in the United States, 2006). However, the 10-year 
trend shows a decrease of 11.2 percent from 1997. Sullivan 
(2008) cites several reasons for the overall 30-year decline 
in burglaries. First, burglars need buyers, and now most 
 people have what they need. Most people who want them 
have digital cameras, iPods and pirated DVDs. Another rea-
son is the 1 million private police and security guards at work 
in residential communities. Since residents have started 
paying for private security, crime has dropped 70 percent. 
In addition, burglar alarms and locks are vastly improved.
 
Burglary oﬀ enses made up 21.9 percent of all prop-
erty crimes reported in 2006. Of these, law enforcement 
cleared 12.6 percent by arrest or exceptional means (Crime 
in the United States, 2006). Burglary oﬀ enses cost victims 
an estimated $4 billion in lost property, with the average 
dollar loss per burglary being $1,834.
 
Th e public regards burglary as a major crime problem. 
Many people fear arriving home or at work and confront-
ing a burglar, a situation that can develop into an assault 
and robbery. Moreover, it is traumatic for people to real-
ize they have been doubly victimized when someone has 
invaded the privacy of their home or business and stolen 
their possessions. Although the items taken may be cov-
ered by insurance, some may be irreplaceable because of 
their sentimental value.
by the laboratory only strengthened the probable cause, 
and the charge of burglary was sustained.
 
Th e word burglar comes from the German words burg,
meaning “house,” and laron, meaning “thief”; thus the 
meaning “house thief.” Th e FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports 
(UCR) deﬁ nes burglary as “the unlawful entry of a struc-
ture to commit a felony or theft, even though no force 
was used to gain entry.” All such attempts also count as 
burglaries. Th e common-law deﬁ nition of burglary (origi-
nating in 16th-century England) required that the break-
ing and entering be committed during the nighttime or 
“between sunset and sunrise.” Many changes have been 
made in burglary statutes since that time, including elimi-
nating the requirement that it occur at night.
Burglary is the unlawful entry of a structure to commit 
a crime.
 
Burglary is reported by frequency and by the value of 
the property stolen and recovered. Th is is because many 
 burglaries yield low losses, although a single burglary 
can yield a high loss. According to the FBI, an estimated 
2,183,746 burglary oﬀ enses occurred throughout the 
nation during 2006, an increase of 1.3 percent from 2005 
BURGLARY VERSUS ROBBERY
Aburglar seeks to avoid contact with people near 
the scene or on the premises.
Burglary differs from robbery in that burglars are covert, 
seeking to remain unseen, whereas robbers confront 
their victims directly. Burglary is a crime against 
property; robbery is a crime against a person.
Most burglaries occur in unoccupied homes and busi-
nesses; therefore, few witnesses exist, and few alarms are 
given to provide advance notice to the police. Th e best 
chances of apprehending a burglar in the act are when a 
silent alarm is tripped, a surveillance camera records the 
crime, a witness hears or sees suspicious activities and 
reports them immediately to the police or alert patrol 
oﬃ  cers observe a burglary in progress. However, most 
burglaries are not solved at the crime scene but through 
subsequent investigation.
CLASSIFICATION
Burglaries are classiﬁ ed as residential or commercial.
RESIDENTIAL BURGLARIES
A residential burglary occurs in buildings, structures or 
attachments that are used as or are suitable for dwellings, 
even though they may be unoccupied at the time of the bur-
glary. Residential units include private homes, tenements, 
mobile homes, cabins, apartments, rooms within a house 
leased by a renter, houseboats used as dwellings and any 
other structure suitable for and used as a dwelling. About 

CHAPTER 13 | Burglary | 403
two-thirds of all burglaries are residential burglaries (66.2 
percent in 2006 according to the FBI). Of these, 63.1 per-
cent took place during the day. Th e FBI’s 2007 “Crime Clock” 
estimates that a home is burglarized every 14.5 seconds.
Residential burglaries are often committed by one or 
more juveniles or young adults who live in the same com-
munity. Th e targets are cash, items to convert to personal 
use or items to “fence” or sell, such as televisions, radios, 
computers, guns, jewelry, tools and other small household 
goods. Residential burglaries typically occur during week-
days when most people are away from their homes, either 
at work or at school.
Whereas the study of burglary and related crime rates 
has historically focused on the oﬀ ender, new theories 
shift the focus toward the victims and particular times 
and places. For example, the routine-activity theory 
proposes that crime results from the simultaneous exis-
tence of three elements: (1) the presence of likely or moti-
vated oﬀ enders, (2) the presence of suitable targets and 
(3) an absence of guardians to prevent the crime. Th is 
theory acknowledges the role, however indirect, of vic-
tims in their own victimization and suggests that certain 
locations may be more susceptible to burglary at certain 
times because of the routine absence of residents. Filbert 
(2008) suggests, “Routine activity theory and related the-
ories point to crime opportunities as the principal cause 
of crime. Rather than concentrations of oﬀ enders or the 
absence of social controls, opportunity theories suggest 
that analysts should look for concentrations of crime tar-
gets.” She gives as an example a suburban subdivision with 
dual-income families that have few people at home during 
weekdays. Because the property is unprotected, the neigh-
borhood can become an area burglary hot spot.
BURGLARY AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE 
CONSTRUCTION SITES 
Th e two primary reasons for burglary at single-family 
house construction sites is the high cost of construction 
materials and lax builder practices (Boba and Santos, 
2006). Amateur opportunists and professional thieves 
alike take advantage of unprotected construction sites. 
Th e primary responsibility for preventing such losses 
is with the builder. However, the police response might 
Burglars often ransack rooms looking 
for valuables, making it difﬁ cult for the 
victim to know what is missing. Often 
there are no leads and, therefore, 
little hope of apprehending the burglar 
or recovering the stolen property.

404 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
include enhancing natural surveillance and disrupting the 
stolen goods market. Responses that have met with lim-
ited success include patrolling construction sites, surveil-
lance and “baiting” thieves and sting operations.
COMMERCIAL BURGLARIES
A commercial burglary is one that involves churches, 
schools, barns, public buildings, shops, oﬃ  ces, stores, fac-
tories, warehouses, stables, ships or railroad cars. Most 
commercial burglaries are committed in service stations, 
stores, schools, manufacturing plants, warehouses and 
oﬃ  ce buildings. Burglars often specialize in one type of 
facility. Businesses located in out-of-the-way places are 
more susceptible to burglary because of a lack of police 
coverage and street lighting and because there are usually 
few witnesses to observe wrongdoing and notify the police. 
Businesses in high-poverty, rundown neighborhoods are 
also at high risk of burglary. In contrast to residential bur-
glaries, most commercial burglaries take place after-hours, 
either at night (58.7 percent at night according to the FBI) 
or on weekends, whenever the establishment is closed.
Commercial burglaries are often committed by two or 
more people, depending on the type of premises, size, loca-
tion and the planned burglary attack. Sometimes a look-
out is used who acts like a drunk, works on a stalled car or 
walks an animal near the location. Th e building is “cased” 
in advance to learn about security devices, opening and 
closing times, employee habits, people in the neighbor-
hood and the presence of a private security oﬃ  cer. Casing 
is also done by obtaining information from an employee 
or by posing as a worker, repairperson or salesperson to 
gain ostensibly legitimate entrance.
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME: 
BURGLARY
Although burglary laws vary from state to state, 
statutes of all states include three key elements.
Elements of the crime of burglary include
• • Entering a structure,
• • without the consent of the person in possession,
• • with the intent to commit a crime therein.
ENTERING A STRUCTURE
Paths of entry may be through an open door, window or 
transom; a ventilation shaft; a hole in a wall; or a tunnel. 
Means of entry can be by jimmying a door or window, 
reaching through an open door or window with a long stick 
or pole, using a celluloid strip to open a door lock, climbing 
a ladder or stairs outside a building, descending through a 
skylight, hiding in an entryway or breaking a window and 
taking items from the window display (called smash and 
grab). Entry also includes remaining in a store until after 
closing time and then committing a burglary.
Some state laws include vehicles, trailers and railroad 
cars as structures.
WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE PERSON 
IN POSSESSION
To constitute burglary, the entry must be illegal and must 
be eﬀ ected without permission of a person with lawful 
authority, that is, the property owner, the legal agent of 
such person or the person in physical control of the prop-
erty, such as a renter or part-owner.
Shoeprints indicate the burglar may have tried kicking the door to 
gain entry. In the end, the doorknob was broken off. (© 911 Pictures)

CHAPTER 13 | Burglary | 405
Entering a public place is done with consent unless 
consent has been expressly withdrawn. Th e hours for 
legal entry usually are posted on public buildings; for 
example, “Open Weekdays 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.” Entrance at 
any other time is without consent. If a speciﬁ c individual 
is restricted from entering a public place during its open 
hours, that individual must be notiﬁ ed orally or in writing 
that consent has been withdrawn.
WITH INTENT TO COMMIT A CRIME
Regardless of whether the burglary is planned well in 
advance or committed on the spur of the moment, intent 
must be shown. When the ﬁ rst two elements are present, 
the third is often presumed present; that is, if a person 
enters a structure without the owner’s consent, the pre-
sumption is that it is to commit a crime, usually larceny 
or a sex oﬀ ense.
ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS
Th ree additional elements are found in the laws of some 
states.
Elements of burglary can also include breaking into the 
dwelling of another during the nighttime.
Breaking Into Actual “breaking” is a matter of interpre-
tation. Any force used during a burglary to enter or leave 
the structure, even if a door or window is partly opened 
or closed, constitutes breaking. Entrance through trick or 
ruse or through threats to or collusion with any person 
residing in the building is also considered breaking.
Breaking and entering is strong presumptive evidence 
that a crime is intended; that is, it provides a reasonable basis 
for belief. Some laws include such wording as this: “Every per-
son who shall unlawfully break and enter a building or dwell-
ing or other structure shall be deemed to have broken and 
entered or entered the same with intent to commit grand or 
petit larceny or a felony therein, unless such unlawful break-
ing and entering shall be explained by testimony satisfactory 
to the jury to have been made without criminal intent.”
Th is, in eﬀ ect, places the burden of proof on the 
defendant.
The Dwelling of Another Some states still require that 
the structure broken into be a dwelling, that is, a structure 
suitable for sheltering people. Th is remnant from com-
mon law restricts burglary to residential burglaries.
During the Nighttime Common law also speciﬁ ed that 
burglary occur under the cover of darkness, an element 
still retained in some state statutes. Nighttime is deﬁ ned 
as the period from sunset to sunrise as speciﬁ ed by oﬃ  cial 
weather charts.
ESTABLISHING THE SEVERITY 
OF THE BURGLARY
Most burglary laws increase the crime’s severity 
if the burglar possesses a weapon or an explo-
sive. Obtain the weapon and connect it with the burglar if 
possible. Check with the National Crime Information 
Center (NCIC). If the weapon is stolen, a separate felony 
charge of theft or illegal possession of a weapon can be 
made.
A burglary’s severity is determined by (a) the presence of 
dangerous devices in the burglar’s possession or (b) the 
value of the property stolen.
If other crimes are committed along with the burglary 
or if the burglary is for the purpose of committing another 
crime such as rape, the additional crime is separate and 
must be proven separately.
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME: 
POSSESSION OF BURGLARY 
TOOLS
A companion crime to burglary is possession of 
burglary tools, an oﬀ ense separate from bur-
glary. Th e charge of possession of burglary tools can be 
made even if a burglary has not been committed if circum-
stances indicate that the tools were intended for use in a 
burglary.
Elements of the crime of possessing burglary tools 
include:
• • Possessing any device, explosive or other 
instrumentality,
• • with intent to use or permit their use to commit 
burglary.
Burglary tools include nitroglycerin or other explo-
sives and any engine, machine, tool, implement, chemical 

406 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
or substance designed for the cutting or burning open of 
buildings or protective containers.
A person with a large number of automobile keys 
probably intends to use them to open varied makes and 
models of vehicle doors. Portable key cutters, codes and 
key blanks such as those used in hardware stores and key-
making shops are also classiﬁ ed as burglary tools, as are 
slam pullers, devices that look like oversized screwdrivers 
and are inserted in car locks to force them open.
Many other tools used in burglaries are commonly 
obtained in hardware stores. Th ese include pry bars, screw-
drivers, bolt cutters, extension cords, pipe wrenches, chan-
nel locks and tire irons. Lock picks and tension wrenches, 
lever-type wrenches, warded pass keys, pick guns, cylin-
der drill jigs and various types of metal blades to open car 
doors can also be used as burglary tools.
Because many people, especially mechanics and car-
penters, have tools that might be used in a burglary in their 
car or on their person, circumstances must clearly show 
intent to use or allow their use in committing a crime.
THE BURGLAR
The burglar is often portrayed as a masked per-
son with a bag over his shoulder loaded with 
silverware and candlesticks. In reality, burglars ﬁ t no set 
image; they are of all sizes, ages, races and occupations. 
Th ey are either amateurs or longtime professionals whose 
sole income is derived from burglaries. Most amateur bur-
glars are between the ages of 15 and 25; most profession-
als are 25 to 55. Th e amateur is usually an unskilled, 
“infancy-level” burglar who steals radios, televisions, cash 
and other portable property and who learns through trial 
and error. In contrast, the professional burglar usually 
steals furs, jewelry and more valuable items and has been 
carefully trained by other professional burglars.
Even though amateurs gain experience in burglar-
ies, they are apt to make a mistake eventually and be 
observed by the police while committing a burglary. If 
caught and sentenced to prison, amateur burglars gain 
the opportunity to learn more about the “trade” from the 
professionals.
Professional burglars may have lookouts who are in 
communication through two-way radios. A getaway vehi-
cle is usually close to the burglary site and the lookout 
monitors police radio frequencies.
Although most burglars’ motives are monetary or 
drug related, sometimes the excitement of committing 
burglary and evading detection is equally or more impor-
tant. One burglar said it was a “thrill” not to know what 
was waiting for him and whether he would get away with 
the crime.
RESPONDING TO A 
BURGLARY CALL
On the way to the burglary scene, watch for any-
one ﬂ eeing the area, suspicious-looking people 
still at the scene and suspicious automobiles. Do not use a 
siren on the way to the scene. Cut your ﬂ ashing lights 
some distance from the scene and do not use a spotlight 
or ﬂ ashlight to determine the address. Park several doors 
away from the address of the call, turn the radio down and 
close car doors quietly. Approach the immediate area with 
low-tone conversation and avoid jangling keys or coins or 
ﬂ ashing lights.
Proceed to a burglary scene quietly. Be observant and 
cautious at the scene.
Th e ﬁ rst two oﬃ  cers arriving place themselves at 
diagonally opposed corners of the building. Th is places 
them out of the other’s line of ﬁ re but in position to pro-
tect each other.
Search the premises inside and outside for the burglar.
Use maximum cover and caution in going around cor-
ners. In a dark room, use a ﬂ ashlight rather than room lights 
to prevent silhouettes. Hold the ﬂ ashlight in front of you at 
a 45-degree angle. Have your gun drawn but not cocked.
Be alert for the possible presence of explosives at a 
burglary scene. If a bomb threat is connected with a bur-
glary, notify the FBI. If explosives are actually detonated, 
notify the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 
Division of the Department of Homeland Security. To 
dispose of explosives at the scene or in the suspect’s pos-
session, call the bomb squad of the nearest large metro-
politan area or the explosives ordnance unit of the closest 
military installation. If an explosion has already occurred 
at the burglary scene, intentionally or accidentally, it may 
leave behind potentially valuable evidence. Collecting and 
handling such evidence is discussed shortly.
FALSE BURGLAR ALARMS
False burglar alarms from personal residential and com-
mercial security systems are a huge problem for law 

CHAPTER 13 | Burglary | 407
enforcement agencies. Data from the U.S. Justice Depart-
ment indicates that 96 percent of all burglar alarm acti-
vations are false (Careless, 2007b, p.32). False alarms are 
typically caused by user error, although occasionally they 
occur because of faulty equipment.
Th e growing problem of false alarms has led many 
departments to implement policies on how to handle such 
nuisance calls. Some law enforcement agencies have imple-
mented a veriﬁ ed response policy, meaning that they 
will not respond to a burglary alarm unless criminal activity 
is ﬁ rst conﬁ rmed through either an onsite security oﬃ  cer 
or some method of electronic surveillance, such as closed-
circuit television. An aggressive form of veriﬁ ed response 
is Enhanced Call Veriﬁ cation (ECV), which requires that 
a minimum of two phone calls be made from the alarm 
monitoring center, to assess whether user error activated 
the alarm. Only then will a law enforcement response be 
activated: “Th ose departments who have adopted veriﬁ ed 
response policies have seen their police dispatch rates drop 
an average of 72 percent, freeing oﬃ  cers’ time for higher 
priority duties” (Careless, 2007b, p.34).
Another approach that departments are taking is to 
use an escalating series of ﬁ nes and fees for police dis-
patch when the alarm turns out to be false. For chronic 
abusers, alarm response by police is suspended entirely. 
False alarms are a waste of time for responding oﬃ  cers, 
and, more important, they may cause oﬃ  cers to be caught 
oﬀ  guard when a genuine alarm occurs.
THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
Although burglary is a very basic crime to inves-
tigate, many investigators cut corners or sim-
ply skip the necessary steps of a preliminary investigation 
because, with a national clearance rate of less than 13 per-
cent, such cases are perceived as being high-time invest-
ments for low-result rewards. Yet, for this very reason, 
the preliminary investigation is of utmost importance.
If no suspect is found at the scene of a burglary, 
conduct the preliminary investigation as described in 
Chapter 1. Obtain detailed information about the type 
of structure burglarized, the means of entry, the time 
and date, the whereabouts of the owner, other persons 
recently on the premises, the property taken and the 
modus operandi (MO).
Determine who the occupants are and where they 
were at the time of the burglary. Were they on the prem-
ises? If not, when did they leave? Were the doors and win-
dows locked? Who had keys? What visitors had recently 
been there? Obtain descriptions of salespeople, agents, 
service installers or maintenance workers on the premises 
recently. Was the burglar familiar with the premises? Could 
the location of the stolen items be known only to a person 
who worked on the premises; that is, was it an inside job?
Obtain a complete list of the property taken and an 
estimate of the value from the victim. Find out where the 
property was obtained and where it was stored. Where 
and when did the owner last see it? What type of property 
was not stolen?
Interview witnesses. In many burglaries, there is a con-
nection between the victim and the suspect. Th e suspect may 
have recently performed work, made a delivery or attended 
a party in the home. Conduct a neighborhood canvass to see 
whether anyone saw anything and to alert neighbors. An 
important point to keep in mind is that concern should be 
shown for the victim. Surveys indicate that victims’ impres-
sions of the police are related to how professionally investi-
gators conduct the crime scene investigation. If oﬃ  cers are 
thorough, courteous, considerate, concerned and conscien-
tious about keeping the victims informed of the progress 
of the investigation, victims generally express favorable 
opinions of the investigators. Solving the crime is the ﬁ rst 
priority for the police, but the victims’ feelings must be con-
sidered as well. Th ey may feel devastated, violated, angry or 
completely dejected. Investigators must keep these feelings 
in mind as they conduct interviews with victims.
Search for physical evidence, including latent ﬁ nger-
prints, items left on the premises by the burglar or tool 
marks on doors or windows. Without physical evidence, 
there is little chance of charging anyone. It is especially 
important to search for prints at the scene and to obtain 
elimination prints of those with normal access to it.
Check pawnshops where stolen items may have been 
left. Log articles with serial numbers into NCIC.
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF 
RESIDENTIAL BURGLARIES
Th e preliminary investigation of a residential burglary 
should include the following steps as a minimum:
• • Contact the resident(s).
• • Establish points and methods of entry and exit.
• • Collect and preserve evidence.
• • Determine the type and amount of loss, with complete 
descriptions.

DETERMINING ENTRY INTO 
STRUCTURES
Burglary is a crime of opportunity and conceal-
ment. Entry is made in areas of a structure not 
normally observed, under the cover of darkness, in cov-
ered entryways, through windows screened by shrubbery 
or trees or through ruse and trickery. Sometimes, how-
ever, the burglar breaks a shop window, removes some 
items on display and rapidly escapes by jumping into a 
nearby vehicle driven by an accomplice.
Jimmying is the most common method of entry to 
commit burglary.
Almost every means imaginable has been used by bur-
glars to gain entry, including tunneling; chopping holes 
in walls, ﬂ oors and ceilings; and using ﬁ re escapes. Tool 
marks, disturbed paint, footprints and ﬁ ngerprints, bro-
ken glass or forced locks help determine how the burglar 
gained entry.
Some burglars have keys made. For example, some 
people leave their car at a repair shop along with their 
full set of keys—an open invitation to make a duplicate 
house or oﬃ  ce key. At other times, burglars hide inside a 
building until after closing. In such cases, they often leave 
behind evidence such as matches, cigarette butts or candy 
wrappers because their wait is often lengthy.
Th e hit-and-run burglary, also called “smash and 
grab,” in which the burglar smashes a window to steal 
merchandise, is most frequently committed by younger, 
inexperienced burglars. Jewelry and furs are the most 
common targets.
In recent years, enterprising burglars have taken 
advantage of the prevalence of electric garage door open-
ers. Using “code grabbers,” burglars can record and rep-
licate the electronic signal emitted from an automatic 
garage door opener. When a person leaves the house and 
activates the garage door opener, the burglar is able to 
capture the signal from up to several hundred yards away 
and reopen the door once the resident is safely out of 
sight. Some burglars are bold enough to back their own 
car into the garage, load it up with stolen items and drive 
away, leaving no sign of forced entry. To combat the code-
grabbing technique to gain entrance into homes, a device 
called a “code rotator” is available. Each time an automatic 
Interviews of burglars have revealed that they  prefer 
middle- to upper-class homes and corner homes that 
allow them to see people approaching from a maximum 
of directions. Th ey may knock on doors before entering 
to determine whether a dog is inside, and they may call in 
advance to see if anyone is home. Th e advent of caller ID 
may bring about some change in this technique.
When processing the crime scene in a residential 
burglary, process the exit as well as the entry area. When 
looking for ﬁ ngerprints, check the inside of drawers that 
have been ransacked, smooth glass objects, papers strewn 
on the ﬂ oor, countertops and clocks. Th e same procedures 
are followed if the burglary has occurred in a multiple-
dwelling or a commercial-lodging establishment such as 
an apartment building or a hotel.
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF 
COMMERCIAL BURGLARIES
Preliminary investigation of a commercial burglary (of, 
for example, a market, shop, oﬃ  ce, liquor store) should 
minimally include the following steps:
• • Contact the owner.
• • Protect the scene from intrusion by the owner, the 
public and others.
• • Establish the point and method of entry and exit.
• • Locate, collect and preserve possible evidence.
• • Narrow the time frame of the crime.
• • Determine the type and amount of loss.
• • Determine who closed the establishment, who was 
present at the time of the crime, and who had keys to 
the establishment.
• • Describe the MO.
• • Identify employees’ friends, maintenance people and 
any possible disgruntled employees or customers.
• • Rule out a faked or staged burglary for insurance 
purposes.
FAKE BURGLARIES
Do not overlook the possibility of faked burglaries, espe-
cially in commercial burglaries where the owner appears 
to be in ﬁ nancial diﬃ  culty. Check the owner’s ﬁ nancial 
status.
So-called combination safe jobs, in which the safe is 
opened by the combination without the use of external 
force, are usually the result of the combination being 
found on the premises, the safe being carelessly left 
open or improperly locked, a dishonest present or for-
mer employee using the combination or selling it to the 

CHAPTER 13 | Burglary | 409
combination lock. Both safes and vaults are common 
targets of burglars.
Safes and vaults are entered illegally by punching, peel-
ing, chopping, pulling, blowing and burning. Sometimes 
burglars simply haul the safes away.
In punching, the dial is sheared from the safe door 
by a downward blow with a sledge or by holding a chisel 
to the dial and using a sledge to knock it oﬀ , exposing 
the safe mechanism spindle. Sometimes tire inner tube, 
or similar material, will be placed over the safe’s dial to 
deaden the noise. Punching is most successful in attack-
ing older-model ﬁ re-resistant safes and is less successful 
on newer models that have tapered spindles that will jam 
when someone attempts to punch them.
In peeling, the burglar drills a hole in a corner of the safe 
and then makes this hole successively larger by using other 
drills until the narrow end of a jimmy can be inserted in the 
hole to pry the door partially open. Th e burglar then uses the 
larger end of the jimmy to complete the job. Although slow, 
this method is less noisy than others.
In chopping, the burglar uses a sledge and chisels or 
a heavy chopping instrument, such as an axe, to chop a 
hole in the bottom of the safe large enough to remove the 
contents. Also called a rip or peel, all three terms are used 
to describe the opening by physical force of a hole, which 
is expanded until it is big enough to ﬁ t a hand inside the 
safe. A chop/rip/peel is commonly used on ﬁ re-resistant 
safes (sometimes after an unsuccessful punch).
In pulling, also called dragging, the burglar inserts 
a V plate over the dial, with the V in place behind the dial. 
Th e burglar then tightens the screw bolts one at a time 
until the dial and the spindle are pulled out. Th is method, 
the opposite of punching, works on many older safes but 
not on newer ones.
In blowing, the burglar drills a hole in the safe near 
the locking bar area or pushes cotton into an area of the 
safe door crack and puts nitroglycerin on the cotton. Th e 
burglar then places a primer cap against the cotton, tapes 
it in place and runs a wire to a protected area. Mattresses 
and blankets are often used to soften the blast. Th e bur-
glar ignites the nitroglycerin, which blows the safe open. 
Th is dangerous, noisy method requires experience and is 
rarely used.
Th e process of burning often uses a “burning bar,” 
a portable safecracking tool that burns a hole into the 
safe to gain entry. Th is hole may be burned near the safe’s 
locking mechanism, or the safe may be tipped over and 
the hole burned through the bottom. An arc-air burning 
tool can punch a hole completely through a 1-inch steel 
plate in about 10 seconds.
door opener is used, the internal code rotates to a new 
one, rendering a code grabber useless.
DETERMINING ENTRY INTO 
SAFES AND VAULTS
Safes are usually considered a good way to pro-
tect valuables, but most older safes provide 
little more than ﬁ re protection. Unless they are carried 
away or demolished by a burglar or lost in a ﬁ re, safes last 
many years; therefore, many old safes are still in use.
A safe is a semiportable strongbox with a combi-
nation lock. Th e size of the safe or lock does not neces-
sarily correlate with its security. A vault is a stationary 
room of reinforced concrete, often steel lined, with a 
Some burglars use a rock or brick to smash a display window and 
then steal valuable merchandise. Such smash-and-grab burglaries 
often set off an alarm. (© Joel Gordon)

410 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
Th e preceding methods are used on older safes still 
found in many smaller stores. Often the safe can be 
entered in less than 15 minutes. Modern safes, however, 
do not have spindles and cannot be punched, peeled or 
pulled. Safes of newer steel alloys are highly resistant to 
burning and drilling.
OBTAINING PHYSICAL 
EVIDENCE
Most burglars are convicted on circumstantial 
evidence. Any physical evidence at the bur-
glary scene is of utmost importance.
Physical evidence at a burglary scene includes ﬁ nger-
prints, footprints, tire prints, tools, tool marks, broken 
glass, paint chips, safe insulation, explosives residue 
and personal possessions.
Th e competent, professional burglar will wear gloves 
to avoid leaving ﬁ ngerprints and palm prints. However, 
an oﬀ ender’s inexperience and haste could result in 
such prints being scattered throughout the crime scene. 
Th erefore, process the scene for prints, particularly at the 
entry point.
Shoe impressions and footprints may be visible inside 
or outside the structure and should be cast following the 
guidelines in Chapter 5. Similarly, any tire impressions 
located around the burglary scene should be cast as pos-
sible evidence.
Tools and tool marks are especially important items 
of evidence. Pry bars, augers, picks and screwdrivers are 
Some burglars prefer a site of their own choosing at 
which to employ one or more of these methods. So, they 
steal the entire safe, haul it away in a truck and open it 
when they get there.
Safes are a frequent target of burglars. (© James Shaffer)
Burglars often seek items such as wrist 
watches, which are easy to transport 
and convert into cash and difﬁ cult 
to trace and identify. (© SEBASTIAN

public safety beneﬁ ts (Zedlewski and Murphy, 2006): 
“Th ree NIJ pilot projects have demonstrated that ana-
lyzing DNA from property crimes can be extraordinarily 
useful . . . Th e beneﬁ ts stem from the recognition that 
property oﬀ enders—burglars in particular—pose a sig-
niﬁ cant threat not just to those whose property they 
steal, but to the community at large. . . . Th e potential 
that burglars will commit more serious, violent crimes 
is perhaps the greatest danger posed by property crime 
oﬀ enders.”
For investigators who consider collecting DNA evi-
dence at burglary scenes to be “overkill” for such rela-
tively minor crimes, Garrett (2006, p.122) notes, “DNA 
evidence puts law enforcement hot on the perpetrator’s 
trail in high-volume serial crimes.” She suggests, “Sneak 
thieves and cat burglars once covered their tracks by don-
ning a pair of gloves—but no more. Th eir DNA can act as 
the smoking gun that leads to their capture.” Touch or 
trace DNA can be obtained from surfaces at the scene, 
such as when a nervous and perspiring suspect presses 
his or her face against a window, or a burglar with a cold 
sneezes on a counter. Th ese types of actions, and the trace 
evidence they leave behind, are now receiving recognition 
among investigators and helping solve some diﬃ  cult bur-
glary cases.
Critics argue that DNA analysis, which typically costs 
around $2000, is too expensive to use in an attempt to 
solve a burglary that, on average, involves a loss amount 
less than that. However, research from the United King-
dom shows that for every DNA conviction obtained, eight 
future crimes are prevented: “If the UK’s statistics are 
accurate and you can prevent crimes by solving one crime, 
then the $400 burglary, which cost us $2,000 to solve is 
priceless” (Garrett, 2006, p.122). 
MODUS OPERANDI FACTORS
Eﬀ ective MO ﬁ les are essential in investigating 
burglaries because most burglars commit a 
series of burglaries. Look for patterns in the location, day 
of week, time of day, type of property stolen and method 
of entry and exit. Th e burglar may commit vandalism, ran-
sack, write with lipstick on mirrors, take only cash or jew-
elry, drink liquor from the scene or eat from the 
refrigerator. Such peculiarities can tie several burglaries 
to one suspect.
Important MO factors include the time, type of victim, 
type of premises, point and means of entry, type of 
property taken and any peculiarities of the offense.
commonly used to commit burglary. Locksmith tools 
can also be used and are illegal to possess unless one is a 
licensed locksmith. Burglars often have a “tool of choice” 
to gain entry, and this same tool, used over and over at 
diﬀ erent crime scenes, will leave behind characteristic 
striation marks that can connect one burglary to another. 
Tools used to pry open a door or window always leave a 
mark behind (recall Locard’s principle of exchange [Chap-
ter 1]). If the frame is made of wood, striation marks may 
be visible and can be cast. Before casting an impression in 
wood, however, spray the surface with a silicone oil-based 
release agent to ensure that the silicone casting material, 
once cured, does not stick to the wood and pull out wood 
ﬁ bers when the cast is removed.
Be alert to the variety of containers used to carry 
burglary tools—handbags, suitcases, musical-instrument 
cases and packages that appear to contain merchandise. 
Tools can also be concealed under coats, inside pant legs 
or under car seats. Tools found on the premises are some-
times left there by the burglar to avoid being caught with 
burglary tools in possession and to thwart eﬀ orts to link 
multiple burglaries to one oﬀ ender.
Broken glass and paint chips are common items of 
evidence at burglary scenes. An oﬀ ender who smashes a 
window to gain entry to a building may unwittingly carry 
away tiny fragments of glass on his clothing or the soles 
of his shoes. Samples of glass or chipped paint collected 
at the scene can be matched to glass and paint fragments 
detected on the suspect, helping to establish his presence 
at the crime scene.
Evidence at the scene of a safe burglary may also 
include safe insulation. As with glass and paint fragments, 
the burglar often has some of this insulation on his or her 
clothing, either in pants, coat or jacket pockets or in the 
nail holes of shoes. Take comparison standards of safe 
insulation to be matched with particles found on the sus-
pect, on tools the suspect used or in the vehicle used dur-
ing the crime. In some cases, safe insulation can also be 
matched with a series of burglaries.
Sometimes explosives are encountered at a burglary 
scene. Use extreme caution in handling and preserving 
such evidence. If an explosion has already occurred at the 
burglary scene, intentionally or accidentally, identify and 
preserve fragments from the explosive device and send 
them to a crime laboratory.
DNA is also becoming important in burglary investi-
gations. If a burglar gets cut breaking into a structure, he 
or she may leave blood behind that can be analyzed for 
DNA, perhaps linking the burglary to others. Noting the 
high recidivism rates of property crime oﬀ enders, that 
their crimes and violence often escalate and that many 
property crime cases go unsolved, the National Institute 
of Justice (NIJ) has advocated collecting DNA evidence 
in “minor” crime investigations as a way to yield major 

412 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
RECOVERING STOLEN 
PROPERTY
Stolen property is disposed of in several 
ways. Because many people are looking for a 
bargain, thieves can often sell the property on the 
streets, thus avoiding a record of the sale but also risk-
ing being reported to the police by someone who sees 
the transaction.
In the case of property being sold to pawnshops or 
secondhand stores or left at a store on consignment for 
sale, most states and communities have statutes or ordi-
nances requiring a permanent record of the transaction. 
Th e seller must be given a receipt describing the property 
purchased and the amount paid, with the seller’s name 
and address. A copy of the transaction is often sent to the 
police department of the community listed as the seller’s 
home address. If the property is identiﬁ ed as stolen, the 
police contact the shop owner and, upon proof that the 
property is stolen, can recover it. Shop records are open to 
police inspection at all times. Information in these records 
can lead to the arrest of the seller as the person who com-
mitted the burglary.
Informants can often locate stolen property because 
they usually know who is active in the area. Surveillance of 
pawnshops also is often productive. Circulate a list of the 
stolen property to all establishments that might deal in 
such merchandise in your own community and surround-
ing communities. If the property is extremely valuable, 
enter it into the FBI’s NCIC ﬁ les.
Check with pawnshops, secondhand stores, ﬂ ea markets 
and informants for leads in recovering stolen property.
As with so many other types of crimes and evidence, 
national database and tracking tools are being imple-
mented to help law enforcement ﬁ nd and recover stolen 
goods. 
When you recover stolen property, record the date on 
which the property was recovered, where it was recovered, 
who turned it in and the circumstances surrounding the 
recovery. List the names and addresses of anyone present 
at the time of recovery. Mark the property as evidence and 
take it into custody. In some states, it is legal to return 
the property as long as its identiﬁ cation is recorded and a 
photograph is taken. Th ere is no reason the original prop-
erty must be produced in court unless it was an instru-
ment that caused death or serious injury.
Suspects often commit burglaries on only a cer-
tain day of the week, perhaps related to their day off 
from a regular job. The time of the burglary should be 
as accurate as possible, but when victims are gone on 
vacation, this is not easy to determine. Knowing the 
time also helps in checking alibis, interviewing wit-
nesses and, in some states, determining the degree of 
the burglary.
Determine any peculiarities of the oﬀ ense, including 
oddities of the suspect. What method of search was used? 
Was anything else done besides committing the burglary? 
Did the burglar telephone ﬁ rst to ensure that no one was 
home or pose as a delivery person? Did neighbors see such 
activities? Determine any trademarks of the burglar. Some 
burglars take such pride in their professionalism that they 
leave a calling card of some type to let the police know 
whose work it is.
Check the MO with local ﬁ les. Talk to other oﬃ  cers, 
inquire at other agencies within a 100-mile radius and dis-
cuss the case at area investigation meetings. Other oﬃ  -
cers may have encountered a similar MO.
EFFECTIVE CASE 
MANAGEMENT
Because burglary is predominantly a serial 
crime, the serial burglar should be the pri-
mary target of the burglary unit. Th is requires eﬀ ective 
case management, including an eﬀ ective system for pri-
oritizing cases. Proﬁ ling and mapping may be of consid-
erable help.
Using the computer’s search capabilities, informa-
tion retrieval is fast and simple and investigations can 
proceed on information that in the past would have taken 
hundreds of hours to retrieve if indeed it could have been 
retrieved at all.
Eﬀ ective case management also recognizes the mobil-
ity of burglars and makes assignments on the MO rather 
than on the geographic area—for example, burglaries 
involving forcible entry, daytime burglaries involving no 
force and nighttime residential burglaries. All information 
should be shared with the drug enforcement unit because 
many burglaries are drug related.
Th e rise in narcotics and other prescription drug thefts 
from pharmacies has led to the creation of a new national 
database called Rx Pattern Analysis Tracking Robberies 
and Other Losses (RxPATROL). 

CHAPTER 13 | Burglary | 413
Receiving stolen property for resale is a crime, as is 
concealing stolen property, even though not purchased. A 
burglar does not have to personally sell goods to a fence. 
An “innocent” third party can sell the property for the 
burglar, but it is still an oﬀ ense if the buyer knows the 
property was stolen.
It is diﬃ  cult to prove that a buyer knew the purchased 
goods were stolen. Th e property must be found in the 
receiver’s possession and identiﬁ ed as the stolen property 
by the owner’s testimony, marks, serial numbers or other 
positive identiﬁ cation. Knowing can then be proved by 
the very low price paid for the goods in comparison with 
the true value.
Usually evidence of the sale is provided through an 
informant who either made the sale or knows who did. 
Th e property may have been resold, and the person buy-
ing the item may be the informant who identiﬁ es the 
receiver of stolen goods. Th is person assists the police in 
making another sale or identifying property in the receiv-
er’s possession.
Th e receiver of stolen goods is often discovered when 
the person who stole the property is arrested and identi-
ﬁ es the receiver. It is necessary to show that the receiver 
could not legitimately own the item unless he or she had 
bought it from a thief. Show that it was not purchased 
through a normal business transaction. Th e character of 
the person selling the property or any indication that the 
property was being concealed is evidence. Evidence that 
markings or serial numbers have been altered or removed 
indicates concealment and intent to deprive the rightful 
owner of the property. Th e seller can testify to conversa-
tions with the receiver about the property and the fact 
that it was stolen. Th e receiver’s records may not show the 
transaction, which would be evidence of intent to conceal. 
Th e charge of receiving stolen goods can be used when 
possession of stolen items can be shown but there is not 
suﬃ  cient evidence to prove theft.
One indicator of fencing activity is an operation that 
makes merchandise available to retailers at extremely low 
wholesale prices provided they pay cash. Another possible 
indicator is a small local outlet that oﬀ ers signiﬁ cant sav-
ings to customers, conducts a large volume of business over 
a short period and then closes suddenly. Sales from fenced 
goods amount to tens of billions of dollars annually.
STING OPERATIONS
Many cities have established sting operations, in which 
the police legally establish a fencing operation. A suitable 
shop is set up as a front for the operation. Normally, sec-
ondhand stores, repair shops, salvage dealers, appliance 
Recovering stolen property and returning it to the 
rightful owner is aided by Operation Identiﬁ cation pro-
grams. In such programs, homeowners mark all easily sto-
len property with a personal identiﬁ cation number (PIN). 
Th e numbers are recorded and placed in a secure location.
THE OFFENSE OF RECEIVING 
STOLEN GOODS
A go-between who receives stolen goods for 
resale is referred to as a fence.
The elements of the offense of receiving stolen goods are
• • Receiving, buying or concealing stolen or illegally 
obtained goods,
• • knowing them to be stolen or otherwise illegally 
obtained.
Technology Innovations
Careless (2007a, pp.100–101) describes JustSto-
len.net, a Web site that can assist in the recovery of 
stolen property:
JustStolen.net is a Web site where people can regis-
ter the name, model, serial number, photos and other 
details of their valued property. Should it be stolen, 
the victim can refer to this data when he ﬁ les a police 
report. When police anywhere subsequently recover 
this property, all they have to do is log onto to JustSto-
len.net’s law enforcement database (which cannot be 
accessed by the public) and enter any of the proper-
ty’s description, name, model or serial number into the 
site’s search engine. If this property has been rereg-
istered in the system, either before or after the theft 
took place, JustStolen.net provides the ofﬁ cer with an 
e-mail link that can be used to alert the owner.
JustStolen.net is entirely free to the public and 
the police.
Would-be thieves should realize that JustSto-
len.net has closed a major gap in law enforcement 
cases—linking stolen property and the culprits 
who commit home burglary and other property 
crimes to their rightful owners, so a successful 
prosecution can take place.

doors from the home to the garage are other ways bur-
glars gain entry.
Oﬃ  cers can also assist their jurisdiction in reducing 
burglaries by having input into building codes that would 
require adequate locks, lighting and other security mea-
sures to deter burglaries.
Measures that deter burglaries include
• • Installing adequate locks, striker plates and 
doorframes.
• • Installing adequate indoor and outdoor lighting.
• • Providing clearly visible addresses.
• • Eliminating bushes or other obstructions to 
windows.
• • Securing any skylights or air vents larger than 96 
square inches.
• • Installing burglarproof sidelight window glass 
beside doors.
• • Installing a burglar alarm.
IACP/CHOICE POINT AWARD 
FOR EXCELLENCE IN CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION 
First place for the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police IACP/Choice Point Award for 
Excellence in Criminal Investigation (2007, p.15) was 
received by the Irvine (California) Police department.
For two decades, Irvine experienced a high number of 
residential burglaries in middle-class and upscale com-
munities. Police believed most were the work of the 
same serial oﬀ ender. Police had established several task 
forces to identify the oﬀ ender but none had uncovered 
any ﬁ ngerprints, DNA, identiﬁ able vehicles, or other 
physical evidence.
 
In 2005 the Special Investigative Unit of the Irvine 
Police Department, assisted by a new crime analyst 
speciﬁ cally trained in the analysis of serial crimes and 
geographic proﬁ ling, attempted again to identify the 
person or persons responsible for the ongoing serial 
burglaries. Th ey employed intelligence-led policing, geo-
graphic proﬁ ling, crime forecasting, and new technol-
ogy in DNA collection.
 
Within months the investigative team and the ana-
lyst had developed important clues about how, where, 
and when future burglaries would likely occur. Th ey 
were also able to develop trace amounts of the same 
DNA at four diﬀ erent burglaries . . .
dealers or pawnshops make good front operations. Th e 
store is stocked with items to support the type of busi-
ness selected.
Word is spread through informants and the under-
world that the business will “buy anything.” Attractive 
prices are paid to get the business started. All transac-
tions between the fence and the seller of stolen goods are 
recorded by closed-circuit television. Th e camera is usually 
focused on an area in which a calendar and clock are clearly 
visible to establish the date and time of each transaction. 
A parking lot surveillance camera shows the vehicle used 
to transport the property and its license number.
When an item is presented at the counter, the seller, 
the amount paid for the property and the buyer are 
recorded. Th e property is then dusted for ﬁ ngerprints to 
further prove the seller’s possession. Th e stolen goods are 
checked through normal police channels to determine 
where they were stolen.
Th e shop is run for 2 to 3 months and then discontin-
ued. Arrest warrants are then issued for those implicated 
during the store’s operation.
PREVENTING BURGLARY
Research shows that premises that are burglar-
ized are likely to be burglarized again. Th e 
National Burglar and Fire Alarm Association (NBTAA) 
states on its Web site (http://www.alarm.org): “Homes 
without security systems are about 3 times more likely to 
be broken into than homes with security systems. (Actual 
statistic ranges from 2.2 times to 3.1 times, depending on 
the value of the home.) Businesses without alarm systems 
are 4.5 times more likely to be burglarized than commer-
cial locations with electronic security in place. Losses due 
to burglary average $400 less in residences with security 
systems than for a residence without security systems.”
Oﬃ  cers who work with burglary victims can help 
them avoid future burglaries by conducting a security 
check of the premises and “hardening” the target. Tar-
get hardening, also called crime prevention through 
environmental design (CPTED), involves altering 
physical characteristics of the property to make it less 
attractive to criminals. CPTED measures include remov-
ing dense shrubbery next to windows and doors because 
this provides concealment to burglars and increases the 
attractiveness of the target. High privacy fences around 
homes also give cover to people attempting to break in. 
Inadequate lighting increases the attractiveness of a 
property to burglars. Open garages and unlocked  service

matched DNA evidence found at the previous crime 
scenes.
Police arrested him and a search of his residence 
revealed rare coins and jewelry worth more than 
$500,000. Investigators determined that Lopez was 
likely responsible for 139 burglaries in the city between 
January 2003 and June 2005 and more than 500 in the 
previous 20 years.
 
In 2005 a police surveillance team observed a suspi-
cious vehicle near a crime target at the speciﬁ c time devel-
oped in the geographic proﬁ ling. A check of the license 
plate revealed that it was a rented vehicle and that the 
operator was Raymond Lopez, an ex-convict. Follow-up 
investigation revealed that Lopez had been renting vehi-
cles from the same company each week for 20 years.

in diﬀ erent areas and claimed they knew nothing of 
a crime being committed. Inside, the one janitor was 
tied up in the kitchen, unharmed. Th e safe had been 
punched open. A substance believed to be safe insula-
tion, along with paint chips, was found in the trouser 
cuﬀ s and shoes of both suspects. Both janitors made a 
positive ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation of the two suspects. Labora-
tory analysis of the substance found in the suspects’ 
clothing and shoes matched a comparison sample of 
the safe insulation, and the paint chips matched the top 
two layers of paint on the safe. Th e men were charged 
with burglary.
Questions
 1. Was it legal to take the men into custody?
 2. Was ﬁ eld identiﬁ cation appropriate?
APPLICATION
Burglary is the unlawful entry of a structure to commit a 
crime. It diﬀ ers from robbery in that burglars are covert, 
seeking to remain unseen, whereas robbers confront their 
victims directly. Burglary is a crime against property; rob-
bery is a crime against a person.
 
Burglaries are classiﬁ ed as residential or commercial. 
Th e primary elements of the crime of burglary are (1) enter-
ing a structure (2) without the consent of the person in 
possession (3) with the intent to commit a crime therein. 
Additional elements of burglary that may be required 
include (1) breaking into (2) the dwelling of another (3) dur-
ing the nighttime. A burglary’s severity is determined by the 
presence of dangerous devices in the burglar’s possession or 
by the value of the stolen property. Attempted burglary and 
possession of burglary tools are also felonies. Th e elements 
of the crime of possessing burglary tools include (1) possess-
ing any device, explosive or other instrumentality (2) with 
intent to use or permit its use to commit burglary.
 
When responding to a burglary call, proceed to the 
scene quietly. Be observant and cautious. Search the 
premises inside and outside for the burglar. Determine 
the entry point, keeping in mind that jimmying is the 
most common method to enter a structure to commit 
burglary. Attacks on safes and vaults include punching, 
peeling, chopping, pulling or dragging, blowing, burning 
and, for safes, hauling them away.
 
Physical evidence at a burglary scene often includes ﬁ nger-
prints, footprints, tire prints, tools, tool marks, broken glass, 
paint chips, safe insulation, explosives residue and personal 
possessions. Important MO factors include the time, the type 
of victim, the types of premises, point and means of entry, 
type of property taken, and any peculiarities of the oﬀ ense.
 
Check with pawnshops, secondhand stores, ﬂ ea markets 
and informants for leads in recovering stolen property.
 
Th e elements of the oﬀ ense of receiving stolen goods 
are (1) receiving, buying or concealing stolen or illegally 
obtained goods (2) knowing them to be stolen or other-
wise illegally obtained.
 
Measures to deter burglaries include installing ade-
quate locks, striker plates and door frames; installing 
adequate indoor and outdoor lighting; providing clearly 
visible addresses; eliminating bushes or other obstructions 
to windows; securing any skylights or air vents larger than 
96 square inches; installing burglar-proof sidelight win-
dow glass beside doors; and installing a burglar alarm.

arceny/theft is one of the eight Index crimes reported in the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) . Although 
fraud, white-collar crime and environmental crime are not index crimes, they 
are so closely related to larceny/theft that they are included in this chapter. 
Furthermore, they all have elements in common and are investigated in 
similar ways.
L

420 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
 
Some states eliminate the distinctions between larceny, 
fraud and white-collar crimes, combining them into the 
single crime of theft. However, because many states have 
separate oﬀ enses, this chapter discusses them separately. 
Th e distinction may be unimportant in your jurisdiction.
 
Reported larceny/thefts exceed the combined total 
of all other Index crimes. Data from the FBI (Crime in the 
United States, 2006) indicates that two-thirds of all prop-
erty crimes in 2006 were larceny/thefts. An estimated 6.6 
million thefts occurred nationwide, a 2.6 percent decrease 
from 2005 and a 14.7 percent decrease from 1997. Th e 
Oﬃ  ce for Victims of Crime’s “Crime Clock” (2008) reports 
that one home is victimized by theft every 2.3 sec-
onds. Th e National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 
reported 174,160 personal thefts (pickpocketing, purse 
snatching) in 2006, at a rate of 0.7 per 1,000 households, 
and 14,275,150 other thefts, at a rate of 121.0 per 1,000 
households (Rand and Catalano, 2007, p.3). Th e average 
value of property stolen was $855 per oﬀ ense, for an esti-
mated $5.8 billion in lost property in 2006. Nationwide, 
law enforcement cleared 17.4 percent of all reported 
larceny/thefts in 2006 (Crime in the United States, 2006).
 
Investigators may ﬁ nd themselves working a case with 
the FBI if the matter involves fraud, theft or embezzlement 
within or against the national or international ﬁ nancial 
community. Th e FBI notes, “Th ese crimes are character-
ized by deceit, concealment, or violation of trust, and are 
not dependent upon the application or threat of physical 
force or violence” (Financial Crimes, 2007, p.A1). Th e pri-
ority problem areas of this category of crime identiﬁ ed by 
the FBI’s Financial Crimes Section (FCS) include corporate 
fraud, health care fraud, mortgage fraud, identity theft, 
insurance fraud and money laundering. One unit of the 
FCS, the Economic Crimes Unit, investigates signiﬁ cant 
frauds targeted against individuals, businesses and indus-
tries such as corporate fraud, securities and commodities 
fraud, telemarketing fraud, insurance fraud not related 
to health care, Ponzi schemes, advance fee schemes and 
pyramid schemes. A Ponzi scheme, named after Charles 
Ponzi, whose pyramid-type fraud scheme during the 1920s 
led to a major federal investigation, involves using capital 
from new investors to pay oﬀ  earlier investors. Th is scheme 
requires an ever-expanding base of new investors to sup-
port the ﬁ nancial obligations to the existing “higher ups”—
hence the pyramidal shape used to depict such structures.
 
Typically, there must be either interstate involvement or 
a loss exceeding a minimum ﬁ nancial threshold of $250,000 
for federal investigators to take the case. Although these 
crimes may be investigated and prosecuted at the federal 
level, the victims typically call the local police ﬁ rst. 
LARCENY/THEFT: AN 
OVERVIEW
Larceny/theft is the unlawful taking, carrying,
 leading or driving away of property from the 
possession of another. Larceny is committed through the 
cunning, skill and criminal design of the professional thief 
or as a crime of opportunity committed by the rank ama-
teur. Th e adage that “there is a little larceny in everyone” 
has considerable truth. Although some thefts result from 
revenge or spite, the motive for most larcenies is 
the same for the professional and the amateur thief—
monetary gain: either actual cash or articles that can be 
converted to cash or personal use.
Both larceny and burglary are crimes against property, 
but larceny, unlike burglary, does not involve illegally 
entering a structure. Larceny differs from robbery in that 
no force or threat of force is involved.
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME
The crime of larceny/theft takes many forms,
 but the basic elements of the oﬀ ense are simi-
lar in the statutes of every state.
The elements of the crime of larceny/theft are
• • The felonious stealing, taking, carrying, leading or 
driving away,
• • of another’s personal goods or property,
• • valued above (grand) or below (petty) a speciﬁ ed 
amount,
• • with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of 
the property or goods.
Felonious Stealing, Taking, Carrying, Leading or 
Driving Away Th is element requires an unlawful, 
wrongful or felonious removal of the property; that is, the 
property is removed by any manner of stealing. Taking 

CHAPTER 14 | Larceny/Theft, Fraud and White-Collar Crime | 421
items such as fuel and electricity is also included in this 
element. Withholding property is a form of larceny by a 
failure to ever return, or properly account for, the prop-
erty or to deliver the property to the rightful owner when 
it is due. Failure to pay a debt is not larceny, even though 
there is a failure to pay. Civil remedies are sought for this 
type of theft.
The Personal Goods or Property of Another  Goods 
or property refers to all forms of tangible property, real 
or personal. It includes valuable documents; electricity, 
gas, water and heat supplied by municipalities or pub-
lic utility companies; and domestic animals such as cats, 
dogs and livestock. It also includes property in which the 
accused has a co-ownership, lien, pledge, bailment, lease 
or other subordinate interest. Larceny laws also cover 
cases in which the property of a partnership is converted 
to one partner’s personal use adverse to the other part-
ner’s rights, except when the accused and the victim are 
husband and wife.
In the deﬁ nition of larceny/theft, another refers to 
an individual, a government, a corporation or an organi-
zation. Th is element refers to the true owner or the one 
authorized to control the property. Care assignment, per-
sonal custody, or some degree of legal control is evidence 
of possession. In numerous cases, ownership has been 
questioned. Ownership usually designates the true owner 
or the person who has superior rights at the time of the 
theft. Th e owner must support the charge of larceny; oth-
erwise, there is no prosecution.
Of a Value Above or Below a Specified Amount  Value 
determines whether the oﬀ ense is grand or petty larceny. 
Value refers to the market value at the time of the theft. 
Value is determined by replacement cost, legitimate mar-
ket value, value listed in government property catalogs, 
fair market value or reasonable estimates.
If the property is restored to the owner, value means 
the cost-equivalent of the property’s use or the damage 
it sustained, whichever is greater, during the time the 
owner was deprived of its possession. However, this can-
not exceed the original value declared.
If several items are stolen in a single crime, the value 
of all items combined determines the value of the loss, 
even if the property belonged to more than one owner. 
Identical items stolen from diﬀ erent larceny locations are 
not combined but are treated as separate oﬀ enses.
With the Intent to Permanently Deprive the Owner of 
the Property or Goods Intent either exists at the time 
the property was taken or is formed afterward. Th e person 
may have intended only to borrow the property but then 
decided to keep it permanently. Intent is usually the most 
diﬃ  cult element to prove. Establish ownership through 
documents of purchase, statements describing how the 
property was possessed, the length of time of possession 
and details of the delegation of care and control to another 
by the true owner.
Because of its frequency, much police time is devoted 
to larceny, and individual merchants and private security 
forces are also involved. Millions of dollars in losses go 
unreported each month. Th ose that are reported are usu-
ally for collecting insurance rather than in the hope of 
recovering the property or clearing the case.
CLASSIFICATION OF 
LARCENY/THEFT
Most statutes have two major categories of
  larceny/theft based on the total value of the 
property stolen.
The categories of larceny/theft are grand larceny, a 
felony; and petty larceny, a misdemeanor. Which 
category the crime falls under is based on the value 
of the property stolen.
In many states, the amount of theft that predicates 
grand larceny is $100 or more; any lesser amount is petty 
(petit) larceny. Check the laws in your jurisdiction for the 
dollar value that distinguishes petty and grand larceny. It 
is important to know whether the crime is a misdemeanor 
or a felony before proceeding with the investigation.
FOUND PROPERTY
Keeping or selling property lost by the owner is a
 form of theft.
In most states, taking found property with the intent to 
keep or sell it is a crime.
Although the ﬁ nder has possession of the property, it 
is not legal possession. Th ieves apprehended with stolen 
property often claim to have found it—an invalid excuse. 
A reasonable eﬀ ort must be made to ﬁ nd the owner of the 
property—for example, by making inquiries or advertis-
ing in a newspaper. Th e owner, if located, must pay the 
cost of such inquiries before the property is returned.

422 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
If the owner is not located after reasonable attempts 
are made to do so and after a time speciﬁ ed by law, the 
ﬁ nder of the property can legally retain possession of it.
THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
nvestigating larceny/theft is similar to
 investigating a burglary, except that in a lar-
ceny/theft, even less physical evidence is available because 
no illegal or forcible entry occurred. Physical evidence 
might include empty cartons or containers, empty hang-
ers, objects left at the scene, footprints and ﬁ ngerprints.
Do not give the complainant or victim the impression 
that the investigation of the reported theft is unimport-
ant. If there is little hope of recovering the property or 
ﬁ nding the thief, inform the complainant of this, but only 
after you obtain all the facts.
TYPES OF LARCENY/THEFT
he Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) for 2006
 indicates the relative frequency of each type 
of larceny (Figure 14.1). Th e growing problem of identity 
theft is discussed later in the chapter.
To help prevent theft, a security guard

details. Keep careful records of pickpockets and purse 
snatchers, as often they are caught.
BICYCLE THEFT
As bicycles have increased in popularity, so has bicycle 
theft. According to the Web site of the National Bike Reg-
istry (www.nationalbikeregistry.com), more than 1.5 mil-
lion bicycles, worth an estimated $200 million, are stolen 
each year in the United States. Experienced thieves can 
steal a locked bike in less than 20 seconds. And although 
nearly 50 percent of all stolen bicycles are recovered every 
year by law enforcement, only 5 percent are returned to 
their owners, because most bikes are unregistered.
Bicycles are most frequently stolen from schoolyards, 
college campuses, sidewalk parking racks, driveways and 
residential yards. Juveniles are responsible for most thefts, 
although some professional bike theft rings operate inter-
state, even exporting stolen bicycles out of the country. 
Stolen bikes are used for transportation; are sold on the 
street, at ﬂ ea markets or to bike stores; and are disposed of 
through fences. On the street, the value of a stolen bicycle 
is approximately 5 to 10 percent of the bicycle’s original 
retail value, with an inverse relationship between value 
and percentage worth on the street (“Crime and No Pun-
ishment”). In other words, less expensive bikes are resold 
for a higher percentage of their original price than are top-
of-the-line bikes. In some bicycle thefts, the crime is grand 
larceny because of the high value of the stolen bike.
Th e professional thief, often using a van or covered 
truck, steals several expensive bikes at one time, takes 
them to a garage and repaints them or dismantles them 
for parts. Bicycles are easy to disguise by painting over or 
removing identiﬁ cation (ID) tags. Many are immediately 
disassembled and sold for parts and are easily taken from 
one location to another by simply riding them or placing 
them in a vehicle trunk, van or truck.
A single bike theft is best investigated by the patrol 
force. Determine the bicycle’s value and have the owner sign 
a complaint. A juvenile apprehended for a single theft can be 
prosecuted, especially with a prior record of similar or other 
oﬀ enses. Restitution for damage and an informal proba-
tion are usually initiated. If multiple thefts have occurred, 
the oﬀ ender usually goes to juvenile court. Adults are pros-
ecuted by the same procedures used for other larcenies.
Th e investigative division compiles a list of bike com-
plaints organized by make of bike, serial number and color. 
Bike thefts are also entered into the police computer sys-
tem. Patrol oﬃ  cers are given a bike “hot sheet” similar to 
that for stolen vehicles and periodically check bike racks 
at parks, schools and business areas against this sheet.
Bikes are sometimes reported stolen to defraud insur-
ance companies. Even if the bike is recovered, the owner 
Common types of larceny are purse snatching, pocket 
picking, bicycle theft, theft from motor vehicles, theft of 
motor vehicle accessories, mail theft, theft from coin ma-
chines, theft from buildings, shoplifting and jewelry theft.
PICKPOCKETS AND PURSE SNATCHERS
Pickpockets are diﬃ  cult to apprehend because the victim 
must identify the thief. Th is proves challenging, if not 
impossible, unless the thief is observed by someone else or 
is caught in the act. Th e purse opener and purse snatcher 
are modern versions of the pickpocket. Th ese thieves use 
force if necessary but generally rely instead on their skills 
of deviousness and stealth to avoid the use of force and 
evade identiﬁ cation. Th ese types of thefts are sometimes 
called distraction thefts because of how the oﬀ ender gains 
access to the victim’s property. Th e two necessary elements 
of this crime are a distraction followed by an extraction, 
the actual theft. Lost wallets and purses, often the work 
of the pickpocket, are often not reported as thefts because 
the victims do not realize that theft has occurred. 
 Sporting events, New Year’s Eve parties, parades, rock 
concerts, fairs and festivals, public transportation and com-
muter trains present ideal situations for the pickpocket, 
full of potential victims in tight, distracted crowds. 
Behavior that may indicate a pickpocket at work is 
“looping,” in which a suspect exits at one train or bus door 
and reboards at another. Another common tactic is for pick-
pockets to immerse themselves in a crowd getting onto a 
bus or train and take advantage of the jostling body contact 
that almost always occurs during a boarding rush. Watch 
for “passengers” who join the crowd rushing toward the 
vehicle doorway but then, at the last minute, fail to board.
Purse snatching may be a larceny/theft or a robbery 
depending on whether force is used. Th ere are two distinct 
types of purse snatches. One type occurs when a victim is 
seated at a bus stop, outdoor restaurant, gambling casino 
or similar public place and sets a purse, bag, or like item on 
the seat or ﬂ oor next to her and a thief grabs the property 
and runs oﬀ  with it. Because this act lacks the element of use 
of force, it qualiﬁ es as a larceny/theft. Th e other type occurs 
when a victim is clutching a bag or purse tightly, has a purse 
strap over her shoulder or has used some similar means of 
securing the property and force is used by the thief to seize it, 
qualifying the act as a robbery. As a general rule, investigators 
should determine whether the victim experienced any sensa-
tion of force being used, since any force, no matter how slight, 
would satisfy the element of robbery. Th e statement of the 
victim on this point will be a critical factor for the prosecutor 
to determine whether to charge robbery or larceny/theft.
Obtain from the victim a description of what was 
stolen and its value. Ask if the victim recalls being jostled 
or distracted momentarily, and, if so, obtain complete

source and for another amount.
RETAIL SHRINKAGE: EMPLOYEE THEFT, 
SHOPLIFTING AND ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME
Shrinkage refers to the unexplained or unauthorized 
loss of inventory, merchandise, cash or any other asset 
from a retail establishment employee theft, shoplifting, 
organized retail crime, administrative errors and ven-
dor fraud. According to the 2006 National Retail Security 
Survey, retail losses were $41.6 billion or 1.61 percent of 
sales, nearly unchanged from 1.60 in 2005 (Hollinger, 
2007). Th e survey, in its 15th year, is a collaborative eﬀ ort 
between the National Retail Federation (NRF) and the 
University of Florida.
According to the survey, most retail shrinkage—an esti-
mated $19.5 billion—was caused by employee theft, repre-
senting almost half of the losses (47 percent). Shoplifting 
accounted for $13.3 billion of shrinkage, almost one-third 
of losses (32 percent). Other losses were from administra-
tive errors ($5.5 billion and 14 percent of shrinkage) and 
vendor fraud ($1.7 billion and 4 percent of shrinkage). Th e 
survey also found that organized retail crime (ORC) was 
gaining more awareness within the retail industry.
Product categories that experienced the highest 
degrees of shrinkage were cards, gifts and novelties; spe-
cialty accessories; crafts and hobbies; and supermarket 
and grocery items. Th e survey also found that retailers 
have invested in technology to deter, detect and convict 
criminals. Most retailers’ loss prevention systems include 
burglar alarms (95.7 percent), visible closed-circuit tele-
visions (87.1 percent) and digital video (84.9 percent). 
Retailers also conduct check screening (60.4 percent), 
use armored cars (69.8 percent), operate point-of-sale 
(POS) data mining software (69.1 percent) and use hid-
den closed-circuit televisions (57.6 percent).
Davis (2006, p.94) suggests, 
Retailers interested in reducing shrink should take into 
account the lifecycle of the product, which includes 
purchasing the product from suppliers, packaging it 
for shipment, receiving it, and merchandising it on the 
shelf. An item is at risk for shrink from the moment a 
retailer selects to purchase it.
 
Products, such as fragrances and cosmetics, that 
are at a high risk for damage or theft when on the shelf 
are equally or more at risk earlier in the lifecycle, as 
they move from the supplier to the warehouse to the 
store and to the point of sale.
A report from the Loss Prevention Research Council 
states that only 10 percent of retailers characterized their 
shrink as high when compared with their competitors. 
has already collected its value, and there will seldom be a 
prosecution. Large numbers of thefts in a short time may 
indicate an interstate ring has moved into the commu-
nity. Th ese rings use covered trucks to transport bicycles 
from the area, making recovery almost impossible. How-
ever, when interstate or international bicycle theft rings 
attempt to dispose of their stolen inventory, their activity 
may become identiﬁ able. For example, customs oﬃ  cials at 
a port in New Jersey have, at various times, noticed spikes 
in the number of shipments of both bicycles and bicycle 
parts (“Crime and No Punishment,” 2008).
Identiﬁ cation of bicycles is diﬃ  cult because of failure 
to have a registration system or to use one that exists, the 
complex method of providing serial numbers and the fact 
that stolen bikes are often altered, dismantled, repainted, 
and resold.
THEFT FROM MOTOR VEHICLES
“Th eft from parked cars is one of the most common com-
plaints received by police departments. Th ough largely 
unreported, these thefts still account for at least one-third 
of all larcenies reported to police. Th efts from cars usually 
involve a small amount of property value, but put a large 
strain on police resources. Th ese thefts increase citizens’ 
fear of crime and diminish the public conﬁ dence in their 
police” (Petrocelli, 2008b, p.18). Th eft of motor vehicles 
themselves is the topic of Chapter 15.
MAIL THEFT
In the quest for new and easier ways to steal money, 
thieves may target sites used daily as repositories for 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, sites often left unsu-
pervised for hours—mailboxes. On certain days of the 
month, with tremendous predictability, many households 
receive government assistance checks. Other mailboxes 
hold numerous applications for credit cards or the actual 
cards themselves.
Mailboxes are used to receive money as well as to sub-
mit payments. Millions of people leave their bills, accom-
panied by checks, for pickup in their mailboxes. Th ieves 
known as ﬂ aggers go around neighborhoods targeting 
mailboxes with their ﬂ ags up, searching for envelopes 
containing checks and other forms of payment. Th ieves 
may also raid the large blue mailboxes used by people who 
may not trust leaving their own ﬂ ag up.
Once thieves have a check, they may call the bank 
posing as a legitimate business to conﬁ rm that the funds 
are available, or they may simply go ahead and alter the 
check, assuming it will clear. Th e thieves protect the check 
signer’s signature using a “liquid skin” coating and then 
use another solution to strip oﬀ  the remaining ink, thus 

CHAPTER 14 | Larceny/Theft, Fraud and White-Collar Crime | 425
Closed-circuit television (CCTV) has become a stan-
dard security tool to curb shoplifting and help in the 
apprehension and prosecution processes. Despite advanc-
ing technology, the apprehension rate for shoplifters 
remains extremely low compared with the total number 
of shoplifting oﬀ enses committed. 
Most apprehensions are by private security forces 
working for department stores and shopping centers or by 
ﬂ oorwalkers or supervisory personnel. Stores that detect 
and apprehend shoplifters often do not prosecute because 
it is relatively expensive when compared with the value of 
the item(s) shoplifted. Other reasons for not prosecuting 
are fear of facing a false arrest suit, the hope that a rep-
rimand will cure the problem or the belief that notifying 
a juvenile shoplifter’s parents will control the situation. 
Managers sometimes call the police for the chastening 
eﬀ ect it will have on the shoplifter, but if the property is 
recovered, they often decline to sign a formal complaint.
If a charge is made by a merchant or merchant’s 
employee, oﬃ  cers may arrest a suspected shoplifter without 
a warrant if reasonable cause exists for believing that the 
person has attempted or actually committed shoplifting. In 
some states store personnel themselves are encouraged to 
interview the suspect because they are not police oﬃ  cers 
and thus do not have to warn suspects of their rights.
Elements of Larceny by Shoplifting Th e elements of 
shoplifting are very similar to those required for general 
larceny:
• • Intentionally taking or carrying away, transferring, 
stealing, concealing or retaining possession of mer-
chandise or altering the price of the merchandise,
• • without the consent of the merchant,
• • with intent to permanently deprive the merchant of 
possession or of the full purchase price.
Altering the price of an item is considered larceny. It is 
usually not required that the person leave the premises 
with the stolen item before apprehension.
Early laws required that a shoplifter leave a store 
before an apprehension could be made. However, many 
laws have been changed to permit apprehension after the 
suspect has passed the last cashier’s counter in the store 
for the particular level or department. Th e farther the sus-
pect is from the normal place of payment, the greater the 
degree of intent shown to permanently deprive the mer-
chant of the item. After being told why, the suspect may 
be detained for a reasonable time and then delivered to a 
police oﬃ  cer, parent or guardian.
Another 66 percent said their shrink was average. In 
eﬀ ect, the report says retailers inaccurately believe their 
shrink rate is better than their competitors (Daniels, 
2007b, p.14).
Employee Theft Although many assume that most of 
a retail company’s shrinkage is the result of shoplifting, 
more thefts and losses from stores are internal, commit-
ted by employees. In a Spherion Workplace Snapshot sur-
vey, nearly one in ﬁ ve (19 percent) of workers admitted 
taking oﬃ  ce supplies for personal use (“Nearly 20 Percent 
of Workers,” 2007). Of those who admitted stealing oﬃ  ce 
supplies, only 21 percent felt guilty or regretted doing so. 
Th e primary reason given for stealing oﬃ  ce supplies was a 
need for them (41 percent). Nearly one-third (32 percent) 
said their manager told them they could do so, and 15 per-
cent said the company would never miss the supplies.
One recommendation for reducing employee theft 
is to keep the more expensive items under security lock 
and to have frank discussions with employees regarding 
the problem. Employees who are aware of management’s 
policy regarding employee theft are less likely to steal. 
Some companies attempt to eliminate potential employee 
thieves by informing job applicants that a drug test is 
required, even if it is not. Th is announcement alone may 
weed out applicants who have a drug habit and therefore 
are more prone to steal to support it. 
Shoplifting Shoplifting, also known as boosting, involves 
taking items from retail stores without paying for them. It 
is usually committed by potential customers in the store 
during normal business hours. It does not include thefts 
from warehouses, factories or other retail outlets or thefts 
by employees.
Shoplifting has increased with modern merchan-
dising techniques that display goods for sale, remove 
barriers between customers and merchandise and per-
mit potential buyers to pick up and handle goods. Most 
items shoplifted are taken from the main ﬂ oor, where it 
is easier to leave the store. Shoplifting is rising at many 
retail chains, and the prime cause is the sputtering econ-
omy: “Wages aren’t keeping up with inﬂ ation, especially 
the price of food and energy” (Dugas, 2008). In the past, 
much of shoplifting was done to support a drug habit, but 
in the current economy, everyday items, such as grocer-
ies, are being stolen.
Security technology is being employed to limit losses 
caused by shoplifting. For example, electronic article sur-
veillance (EAS) uses small security tags applied to high-
theft merchandise that alert retailers when shoplifters 
try to take stolen items through electronic sensors at 
exit doors. Systems using radio frequency identiﬁ cation 
(RFID) are also becoming more popular among retailers.

426 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
If a store manager wants to prosecute, review the 
store’s reports to determine whether a crime has been 
committed. If it has, take the shoplifter to the police 
station and book and search him or her for additional 
 property. Th e store personnel making the arrest must 
sign a complaint. Most shoplifters never reach the stage 
of arrest and release to the police. When it does occur, 
encourage store cooperation because good arrests by store 
personnel aid convictions and can deter shoplifting in the 
particular store.
Overcrowded courts have become a problem to retail-
ers who want to prosecute for shoplifting. Prosecutors have 
diﬃ  culty obtaining convictions. Many states have passed 
statutes providing for civil ﬁ nes instead of or in combina-
tion with criminal penalties. Retailers are dissatisﬁ ed with 
criminal prosecution because of the delays, low conviction 
rate and lack of restitution for the lost property. Th e civil 
approach permits the retailer to sue in small claims court, 
even in cases in which the oﬀ ender is not convicted of a 
crime. Penalties under civil action range from $50 to $500, 
or in some cases actual damages plus ﬁ ve times the value.
In addition to contributing to the trade in and abuse 
of drugs, shoplifting has been recognized as a way for ter-
rorist and organized crime groups to generate revenue.
Organized Retail Crime (ORC) Th e 2008 Organized Retail 
Crime Survey (p.3) explains,
Organized retail crime (ORC) refers to groups, gangs 
and sometimes individuals who are engaged in illegally 
obtaining retail merchandise through both theft and 
fraud in substantial quantities as part of a commer-
cial enterprise. Th ese crime rings generally consist of 
Because intent is absent, it is not a crime for a person 
to walk out of a store after simply forgetting to pay for an 
item. Th is is a common problem for individuals who suﬀ er 
from Alzheimer’s disease and some other types of men-
tal impairment. Such people may forget that they have 
picked up an item, may forget to pay for it or may honestly 
believe that they have paid for it when they have not. Such 
incidents require oﬃ  cers to exhibit patience and excellent 
communication skills in resolving the situation.
Because shoplifting can be either petty or grand lar-
ceny, a misdemeanor or a felony, the value of the prop-
erty must be established. If the shoplifter is placed under 
arrest, the stolen item should be recovered and retained as 
evidence. Whether the individual is prosecuted depends 
on the individual’s attitude, the policy of the store and 
the police department, the value of the property taken 
and how many of the legal requirements for prosecution 
are fulﬁ lled. Evidence to support shoplifting or altering a 
price requires an eyewitness or proof that the item could 
not have been removed except by the person charged. 
Th e property must be carried away or removed but not 
necessarily to outside the store. Th e manager or clerk 
should identify the property and show proof of the store’s 
ownership.
Proving the intent to permanently deprive is the 
most diﬃ  cult problem in investigating shoplifting. Th is 
intent is shown by the shoplifter’s actions from the time 
the item was stolen until the arrest was made. Stores are 
legally within their rights to recover items taken from a 
store if there is no proof of purchase. Th is does not mean 
the person is guilty of shoplifting. It may be impossible to 
prove intent to steal.

videotape, a woman and her daughter,

JEWELRY THEFT
According to the FBI, the jewelry industry loses more than 
$100 million each year to jewelry and gem theft. Most 
often stolen by sophisticated professional thieves, jewelry 
is also the target of armed robbers and burglars. Jewel 
thieves know the value of jewels, that they are extremely 
diﬃ  cult to identify once removed from their settings and 
that the rewards are higher for the amount of risk involved 
than in other types of larceny. Th ey also have ready out-
lets for disposition.
Most jewelry thefts are from vehicles owned by jew-
elry salespeople, who typically carry thousands of dollars 
in jewels, and from private individuals known to be care-
less about the security of their jewelry. Jewel thieves also 
operate in stores, distracting the salesperson and then 
substituting a cheap facsimile for expensive jewelry. Jewel 
thieves tend to operate interstate and to use locally known 
fences. Th ey have many ingenious methods to steal and 
hide jewelry.
Th e Jeweler’s Security Alliance (JSA) published an alert 
in July 2005 to inform retail jewelry shop owners of a new 
trend in jewel theft—burglars entering a store overnight 
via the roof with the intention of carrying out an armed 
robbery when employees arrive at work the next morning.
Because jewel thieves operate interstate, the FBI 
becomes involved. Th e local FBI oﬃ  ce maintains ﬁ les of 
known jewel thieves and their last known operations; their 
pictures, descriptions and modus operandis (MOs); and 
information about whether they are in or out of prison.
Always inform the FBI of jewel thefts, even without 
immediate evidence of interstate operation.
Since 1992, the FBI’s Jewelry and Gem (JAG) Program 
has helped local law enforcement investigators by provid-
ing a sophisticated and multijurisdictional response to 
these types of thefts (“Jewelry and Gem,” 2008). FBI juris-
diction is attained under Title 18, Sections 2314 and 2315. 
Section 2314 gives the FBI jurisdiction when the value 
exceeds $5,000 and the items are transported interstate 
or in foreign commerce and when the criminal knows the 
goods to be stolen, converted to personal use or obtained 
fraudulently. Section 2315 gives the FBI jurisdiction when 
buyers of the goods know they are stolen, that they have 
been transported interstate or by foreign commerce and 
that they are worth more than $5,000. Mailing packages 
“boosters” who methodically steal merchandise from 
retail stores and fence operators who convert the prod-
uct to cash or drugs as part of the criminal enterprise.
 
Some of the more sophisticated criminals engage 
in changing the UPC bar code on merchandise so they 
ring up diﬀ erently at checkout; this is commonly called 
“ticket switching.” Others use stolen or cloned credit 
cards to obtain merchandise or produce ﬁ ctitious 
receipts to return products back to retail outlets.
According to this survey, the fourth such survey con-
ducted by the NRF, 85 percent of companies reported being 
victims of organized retail crime activity in 2008, compared 
with 79 percent in 2007. Sixty-three percent reported an 
increase in e-fencing activity in the past 12 months—that 
is, the sale of stolen products or gift cards using online 
auction sites and marketplaces. Th e FBI has estimated U.S. 
retailers lose $30 billion annually to ORC (Daniels, 2008a, 
p.13). Furthermore: “ORC is quickly becoming a bigger 
problem because of its scope and that it is often coupled 
with other criminal acts” (Daniels, 2008b, p.13). 
ORC is a relatively low-risk, high-reward crime con-
ducted by fairly sophisticated and skilled groups of crimi-
nals (Maestri, 2008). Th e thefts usually involve speciﬁ c 
small, high-priced items that have a high resale value 
on the black market, such as baby formula, coﬀ ee, steaks, 
cigarettes, smoking cessation products, eyeglass frames, 
over-the-counter health products, razor blades, fra-
grances, batteries, electronic goods, printer ink cartridges, 
power tools and athletic apparel.
Daniels (2007a, p.16) notes, “Although increased 
media attention and legislative action has been directed at 
organized retail crime, new research shows that additional 
action is needed to reduce the dollar amounts retailers 
lose to ORC gangs.” Beyond the cost issue, an additional 
concern is that these groups are funneling money to ter-
rorists. A case in point: the arrest of nine members of a 
Dearborn-based smuggling operation accused of taking 
part in a global scheme involving bootlegged cigarettes, 
infant formula, phony Viagra and counterfeit tax stamps 
and sending a cut of their illicit proﬁ ts to Hezbollah 
(Th uermer, 2007, p.54).
A Web-based national database called the Law 
Enforcement Retail Partnership Network, or LERPnet, is 
a public-private partnership between the NRF, the Retail 
Industry Leaders Association and the FBI. Joseph LaRocca, 
vice president of loss prevention for NRF, contends that 
LERPnet puts the industry’s “eﬀ orts in combating ORC 
into overdrive” (Daniels, 2007c, p.1). LERPnet will be used 
to analyze, track and prevent activities by these criminal 
networks. Retailers will pay $1,200 a year to participate, 
helping arm law enforcement with information from mul-
tiple stores to investigate illegal activity such as ORC, bur-
glaries, robberies, counterfeiting and e-fencing (Daniels). 

428 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
Th efts of valuable art should be reported to the FBI and 
to the International Criminal Police Organization (INTER
POL), which also has an international stolen art ﬁ le.
Few police oﬃ  cers have training in identifying art, so 
they should conduct only the normal burglary, theft or 
fraud investigation. Th en an authenticity check of the art 
object should be conducted by the FBI and national art 
dealers. People who own art objects rarely have adequate 
descriptions or photos of each piece and the pieces rarely 
have identiﬁ cation numbers. Investigators should submit 
to the FBI all known information concerning the theft 
and a photograph of the art if available.
Th e FBI’s specialized art crime team consists of eight 
agents working in major art markets around the country, 
including New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia; two 
assistant U.S. attorneys; and several FBI analysts. Th e ﬁ eld 
agents are art savvy and can tell a Monet from a Manet; 
know the dealers, appraisers, collectors, curators and auc-
tion houses; are well versed in the art markets; and are 
knowledgeable about the unique laws that apply. Art theft 
cases the FBI has handled in recent years include
• • January 2004: the return of a Civil War sword stolen 
from the U.S. Naval Academy museum in 1931.
• • March 2004: the arrest of a Manhattan art dealer and 
gallery owner, later convicted on federal mail fraud 
charges for an international art forgery operation that 
spanned nearly two decades.
• • February 2005: the return of eight ancient stone seals 
looted from Iraq during the aftermath of Saddam 
 Hussein’s fall.
NUMISMATIC THEFT: COINS, METALS 
AND PAPER MONEY
Coin collections are typically stolen during commercial 
and residential burglaries. Obtain the exact description of 
the coins, the condition, any defects, scratches, dye breaks, 
how they were jacketed and any other identifying infor-
mation. Th e condition of coins determines their value; a 
coin in mint condition may be worth twice the value of 
a coin in poor condition. Stolen coins may be taken from 
one coast to the other for disposition. Large coin shows 
are held throughout the year in larger cities, usually at 
convention centers or hotels. If interstate transportation 
is suspected, notify the FBI.
Metals such as gold, copper, silver and aluminum are 
valuable. Copper is obtained from electrical and telephone 
lines or from storage yards of these companies. Th ieves 
have been known to cut down telephone lines and to strip 
electrical lines in remote areas. A weekly check of scrap 
yards may be advisable in some jurisdictions.
that contain illegally obtained jewels to another state also 
constitutes interstate operation.
Investigating jewelry theft is the same as for any other 
larceny. To obtain physical evidence, search the crime 
scene as you would in a burglary. Obtain the names of 
people in neighboring rooms at motels and hotels. Inter-
view employees and other possible witnesses.
Review the victim’s account of the theft. Obtain a 
complete description of the jewelry, the value of each item 
and the amount of insurance carried. Contact informants 
and have them be on the alert for information about the 
thieves and the location of the stolen items.
ART THEFT
Th e FBI reports, “Art and cultural property crime—which 
includes theft, fraud, looting and traﬃ  cking across state 
and international lines—is a looming criminal enter-
prise with estimated losses running as high as $6 billion 
annually” (“Art Th eft,” 2008). Th is oﬀ ense usually comes 
to the attention of law enforcement through an art gal-
lery’s report of a burglary or theft. In other instances, art 
objects are recovered during the investigation of another 
crime, or the theft is reported by another police agency. 
Th e stolen objects are frequently held for a long time and 
are then sold or moved coast-to-coast or internationally 
for disposition.
Art theft is an international problem. To cope with 
the problems resulting from the interstate and interna-
tional nature of these thefts, the FBI created the National 
Stolen Art File (NSAF) in 1979. Administered through the 
FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, Violent Crimes and 
Major Oﬀ enders Section, Major Th eft/Transportation 
Crimes Unit, the NSAF provides a computerized index of 
stolen art and cultural property as reported to the FBI by 
law enforcement agencies throughout the United States 
and internationally. For an object to be eligible for entry 
into the NSAF, it must meet the following criteria:
• • Th e object must be of artistic or historical signiﬁ cance; 
this includes ﬁ ne arts, decorative arts, antiquities, 
Asian art, Islamic art, ethnographic objects (Native 
American, African, Aboriginal), archaeological 
material, textiles, books and manuscripts, clocks and 
watches, coins, stamps, musical instruments and 
scientiﬁ c instruments.
• • Th e object must be valued at $2,000 or more, or less if 
associated with a major crime.
• • Th e request must come through a law enforcement 
agency accompanied by a physical description of the 
object, a photograph of the object, if available and a 
copy of any police reports or other information rel-
evant to the investigation.

CHAPTER 14 | Larceny/Theft, Fraud and White-Collar Crime | 429
residue from tools and equipment used to harvest the 
plants. Soil and sand samples from the crime scene may 
be linked to a particular vehicle used by the thieves or 
with transplanted cactuses at residences or commercial 
businesses.
Livestock Just as in the days of the Wild West, cattle 
rustlers are still around, stealing millions of dollars worth 
of cattle annually and showing no signs of stopping. Most 
livestock is stolen from the open range and consequently 
may go undetected for weeks or even months. Cattle are 
usually stolen at night and are fairly easy to lure away 
because they are herd animals—once rustlers get one 
animal to come, the rest soon follow. Cattle rustlers are 
almost always armed because they often slaughter the 
animals on the spot, butcher them and load them into 
refrigerated trucks. Investigators may need the help of 
stock auctioneers, slaughterhouses, feedlot operators and 
livestock associations when looking into these crimes.
Evidence in such cases again includes shoe and tire 
impressions, soil samples, broken fences and perhaps 
forged bills of sale. Livestock branding, a practice dat-
ing back to 2700 bc, can also provide valuable evidence 
in cattle thefts. Brands, both hot irons and freeze brands, 
are unique identifying symbols placed on each animal of 
a speciﬁ c ranch’s herd. Brands are registered through a 
state’s brand inspection oﬃ  ce, which is generally under 
the jurisdiction of the state’s department of agriculture. 
To the experienced livestock person, brands are a read-
able language, read from left to right, top to bottom and 
outside to inside (Figure 14.2).
In addition to branding, cattle are also ear marked 
and wattle marked, commonly with a knife, according 
to branding protocol. Th ese cuts are further means of 
identiﬁ cation.
Horse rustling is another problem, with more than 
50,000 horses stolen annually. Like cattle, horses are herd 
animals and are fairly easy to steal once rustlers have lured 
one animal away. Sometimes after the desired horses are 
loaded onto a truck, the rustlers break down the fence and 
scatter the remaining horses. Owners may then think the 
horses broke out themselves, and those not recovered are 
simply lost. Most stolen horses are slaughtered, and the 
meat is sold in Europe and Japan. Th e United States is 
the world’s leading exporter of horsemeat, which in many 
countries is considered better than our best steaks.
As with cattle, horses are branded, with various 
breeds being marked in speciﬁ c locations. In addition, 
thoroughbreds have registration numbers tattooed under 
the upper lip.
Brand altering is a common method used by livestock 
thieves to disguise the stolen animals, although with well-
chosen and -designed brands, such alterations are very 
Th e increasing demand for copper and rising resale 
market prices have fueled copper thefts that cost indus-
tries across the country nearly $1 billion in 2006 and 
increased the cost of each new home by about $3,000 
(Johnson, 2007). Copper thieves have posed as utility 
workers, outﬁ tted in hard hats and reﬂ ective vests as they 
strip spools of wire from light poles. Th ieves may also take 
advantage of natural disaster sites. For example, follow-
ing Hurricane Katrina, an Energy Department inspection 
reported that the tons of scrap copper that should have 
been found throughout the wreckage of buildings and 
fallen power lines across Louisiana and other aﬀ ected 
areas of the Gulf Coast had “simply vanished” (Johnson).
AGRICULTURAL THEFT
In certain areas of the country, agricultural theft is an 
increasing problem that requires investigation. Agricul-
tural theft rings are targeting a variety of items, includ-
ing ginseng in Michigan, irrigation valves in Washington, 
anhydrous ammonia fertilizer in Minnesota and Ohio, 
Japanese radishes in Hawaii, and nuts and citrus in Cali-
fornia. Such crimes have also targeted timber, cactus, live-
stock, farm equipment and chemicals.
Timber Theft Th e U.S. Forestry Service estimates $100 
million in lumber is stolen annually through illegal log-
ging. Tree “rustlers” harvest burls, the large gnarly root at 
the base of walnut trees. Burls can weigh as much as 2,000 
pounds and are used to make ﬁ ne woodwork. Tree “tip-
pers” harvest the tips of pine trees to make into wreaths. 
A timber theft crime scene will usually contain trace-
able evidence, such as tire tracks, stumps and other items 
the thief may have discarded or accidentally left behind. 
As part of a stolen timber investigation, investigators 
should know how the timber might be used. For example, 
Douglas ﬁ r is harvested for ﬁ rewood, cedar for shake shin-
gles and fence posts. Investigators can then contact area 
mills and timber buyers to obtain information that might 
help them apprehend the thief.
Cactus As communities have cropped up in the desert 
Southwest, the demand for landscape cactus has soared 
and poachers have found a lucrative business in stealing 
these prickly plants. Th e theft of cactus has become such a 
problem in some areas of Arizona, Texas, and other West-
ern states that special police units have been formed to 
crack down on the crime. Some jurisdictions, such as Lake 
Mead, Nevada, have gone so far as to implant computer 
ID chips in certain species of cactus to be able to track 
them if they go missing.
As with a timber theft, a cactus theft crime scene 
will likely contain tire tracks, shoe imprints and perhaps 

430 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
and vehicle stops to check limits are two means of detect-
ing poachers.
Game wardens may be of help in investigating ﬁ sh 
and wildlife theft. Wardens know the hunting and wild-
life laws, and they may be familiar with many of the local 
hunters and poachers and of certain poachers’ MOs. War-
dens can also help gather evidence.
A powerful computerized database, Green Parrot, has 
about 3,300 images and textual data for some 7,000 ani-
mal and 15,000 plant species. Th is database should enable 
police and customs authorities worldwide to more eﬀ ec-
tively investigate wildlife theft.
CARGO THEFT
Nearly everything we wear, eat and use at home or work 
has, at some point, been on the back of a truck. Th e amount 
of cargo crisscrossing our country is mind-boggling and 
critical to daily life. Th e increasing popularity of cargo 
theft is the result of two primary features: It is low risk 
(few thieves are apprehended, prosecuted or incarcerated), 
and it is extremely proﬁ table. Th e FBI reports, “Cargo theft 
is estimated to cost the U.S. $15–30 billion a year, though 
the true measure may be even higher” (“Cargo Th eft’s High 
Cost,” 2006). Th e FBI Web site explains,
Th e issue is much broader than a criminal stealing a TV 
oﬀ  a truck. In the past few years, investigations have 
revealed more and more sophisticated operations with 
well-organized hierarchies. Th e typical “criminal enter-
prise” has a leader who runs a regional or national oper-
ation. Beneath him are cells of thieves and brokers or 
fences, who unload the stolen goods on the black mar-
ket. “Lumpers” physically move the goods along with 
drivers. And there’s usually a specialist who is expert 
at foiling the anti-theft locks on truck trailers.
 
Cargo thieves heist whole truck loads of 
merchandise—the average freight on a trailer is 
valued between $12,000 and $3 million. Th e hotspots 
are where you might expect—truck yards, hubs for 
commercial freight carriers, and port cities.
Th e illegal or unauthorized removal of cargo from the 
supply chain is called leakage, a concept similar to that of 
shrinkage. Cargo theft can occur from an 18-wheel trailer, 
a shipping container left on a dock or placed on a railway or 
a warehouse. Although some cargo thieves will take what-
ever commodity crosses their path, many groups steal to 
order. Common commodities targeted include consumer 
electronics, designer clothing and fragrances, alcohol and 
tobacco (Kennedy, 2005).
Methods used to steal cargo vary, and such crimes are 
generally extremely diﬃ  cult to detect after they occur. In 
some cases, thieves break the locking mechanism oﬀ  the 
back door of a trailer or container or drill out a rivet holding 
diﬃ  cult to make appear original. To foil brand-altering 
rustlers, DNA analysis is now being used to identify  stolen 
cattle. 
Farm Equipment and Chemicals Farm equipment and 
chemicals are also targets for thieves. Because of their 
expense, pesticides and herbicides are especially attrac-
tive. Farmers themselves may be the thieves, or they may 
buy their chemicals and equipment at ridiculously low 
prices from such thieves. Evidence of this crime may be 
uncovered by examining purchasing records.
FISH AND WILDLIFE THEFT
Poaching is illegally taking or possessing ﬁ sh, game or 
other wildlife, including deer, elk, bear, pheasant, ducks, 
wild turkeys and grouse. Th is crime may be committed by 
the amateur—the usually law-abiding hunter who is faced 
with an unexpected opportunity to poach, such as com-
ing across an animal not in season to hunt while hunt-
ing another animal that is in season—or the professional 
poacher, who, in contrast, sets out to hunt prey illegally, 
often as a “trophy hunter.” Hunting-license veriﬁ cations

code speciﬁ cally for cargo theft and requiring the estab-
lishment of a national cargo theft database. 
Another investigative challenge centers on the mobile 
nature of the crime. Numerous jurisdictions around the 
country, particularly those close to major seaports and 
cargo distribution hubs, have developed cargo theft task 
forces to increase their eﬀ ectiveness in conducting inves-
tigations. Th e success of these units has demonstrated 
that the surveillance and investigative abilities of a multi-
jurisdictional team surpass those of any single agency. 
In the absence of a task force, experts recommend 
that an investigator work a cargo theft case backward, 
from the point of recovery to the initial loading of the 
product (Kennedy, 2005). Contact the container or trailer 
carrier for information on where the load should be. If the 
theft was from a refrigerated container, known as a reefer, 
collect the temperature chart as evidence. Th is chart will 
reveal a spike in temperature whenever the container 
was opened and will, presumably, indicate when the theft 
occurred (Kennedy).
Having looked at the various types of larceny/theft, 
consider next how the crimes can be proved.
PROVING THE ELEMENTS OF 
THE CRIME
To prove the felonious stealing, taking, carrying,
 leading or driving away of property, you must 
gather enough evidence to prove that the property is 
missing—not simply misplaced. Obtain proof of owner-
ship through bills of sale or receipts or through evidence 
that the owner had custody or possession of or responsi-
bility for the item. Determine the item’s value by ascer-
taining its replacement cost or legitimate market value or 
by obtaining reasonable estimates. Th e owner can testify 
to the actual value if he or she is familiar with the speciﬁ c 
item and its quality and condition at the time of the theft. 
People with business knowledge of similar items can help 
determine value. If certain items obviously exceed the 
petty larceny limitation, it is not necessary to know their 
exact value. Take statements from the owner regarding 
where the property was located and what security was 
provided. Also obtain evidence that the owner no longer 
possesses the property.
Intent to permanently deprive the owner of the prop-
erty is shown by the suspect’s selling, concealing, hiding 
or pawning the property or converting it to personal use. 
Intent is proven by a motive of revenge, possession under 
circumstances of concealment, denial of possession where 
possession is proven or ﬂ ight from normal residence.
the door in place, empty the cargo and then shut the door 
again, sometimes taking the time to replace the rivet or 
otherwise visually disguise the theft so that nothing looks 
amiss to a passing security guard. Other times, the driver 
is hijacked en route. Th ese “driver give-ups” typically hap-
pen close to major interstate corridors (Bibb, 2005).
A large portion of cargo theft occurs from commercial 
truck stops. Th ieves know that truck drivers usually can-
not oﬄ  oad their cargo over a weekend; thus, drivers who 
stop on a Friday evening are likely to drop their trailer 
and take only the tractor for transportation until Mon-
day morning. During that time, the unsupervised trailer 
is extremely vulnerable to theft (Bibb, 2005). Other times, 
thieves wait at truck stops and, knowing that many driv-
ers simply leave their truck running for the few minutes 
it takes them to grab some food or use a restroom, get in 
and drive the entire rig away.
Not uncommon are drivers who are part of the theft 
crew itself. For example, South American crews operat-
ing along the East Coast, primarily in New York and New 
 Jersey, commit “leakage theft,” where one member works 
as a truck driver, picks up a legitimate load from a marine 
terminal or distribution center, and then diverts the cargo 
before delivery. Th e thieves enter the container or trailer, 
leaving the manifested seal intact, take out a portion of 
the load and then close the container. When the load is 
delivered, it appears to be short-shipped (Kennedy, 2005), 
that is, that the mistake was made by the shipper.
Although arresting thieves is still a goal, many agen-
cies, including the FBI, are now focusing on ﬁ nding the 
source—the organized crime (OC) groups and their front 
businesses. Approximately half of all domestic cargo thefts 
are the result of OC, and law enforcement is now using 
criminal statutes that target money laundering to shut 
down cargo theft. Kennedy notes the existence of certain 
nontraditional OC groups who engage in cargo theft. Cuban 
and South American (Ecuadorian, Peruvian, etc.) groups 
operate nationwide and are fairly sophisticated. Th ese 
groups typically work in cells or crews of three or four, 
occasionally more, and lack the typical hierarchy found in 
more traditional OC groups, such as La Cosa Nostra. Th e 
MOs do not vary much by group, except for the Asian and 
street gangs in Southern California who tend to be quite 
violent and will use guns to conduct armed hijackings.
Numerous challenges face cargo theft investigators, 
not the least of which is the lack of respect or seriousness 
historically given to the issue: “Cargo theft has long been 
the Rodney Dangerﬁ eld of crimes in the United States. . . . 
For purposes of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting system, 
cargo theft could be coded as any number of categories, 
such as theft or grand larceny” (Gips, 2006, p.28). However, 
a provision in the law reauthorizing the USA PATRIOT Act 
may help overcome this challenge by designating a UCR

to fall through or the proﬁ ts to be divided among more 
people. Th e game may require the victim to do something 
dishonest or unethical, thus making the victim less apt 
to report the swindle to the police. It is often conducted 
away from the victim’s hometown so the victim cannot 
obtain advice from friends.
A particular type of person is needed to make the con 
game work. Con artists develop cunning, guile and skills 
through their own systems of learning and education. 
Th ey are taught by older people in the “trade,” usually 
starting as the “number two” or “straight man.” As they 
gain experience, they work their way up until they are 
the “number one” in a swindle of their own. Con artists 
understand human nature, are extremely convincing, lack 
conscience, have an uncanny ability to select the right vic-
tim and have no mercy for their victims, often extracting 
the life savings of elderly people.
Two basic approaches are used in con games: the short 
con and the long con. Short-con games take the victims 
for whatever money they have with them at the time of 
the action. For example, three-card monte, similar to the 
old shell game, entices victims to bet on whether they can 
select one card from among three. “Huge Duke” involves 
betting on a stacked poker hand, with the victim dealing 
the ﬁ nal hand. “Th e Wipe” involves tying money into a 
handkerchief for safekeeping and then switching it with 
one containing newspaper bits. Long-con games are usu-
ally for higher stakes. For example, in “Th e Wire,” the orig-
inal long-con game, the victim is enticed to bet on horse 
races, convinced through an elaborate telegraph oﬃ  ce 
setup that the manager can beat the bookmaker by delay-
ing the results of the race long enough to let the victim 
and other cohorts in the scheme make bets. After allowing 
the victim to win a few games at low stakes, the “big bet” is 
made in which the victim may lose thousands of dollars.
When investigating con-game fraud, obtain a com-
plete description of the conﬁ dence artists and the type of 
fraud, trick or false pretense they used, as well as the exact 
amount of money involved.
Because the victim usually sees and talks with the con 
artists, it is often easy to identify them, but unless the 
police are notiﬁ ed quickly, the suspects will be gone from 
the area. Obtain descriptions of the perpetrators and their 
MO. Keep this information on ﬁ le for future reference.
Th e FBI maintains a conﬁ dence artist ﬁ le to assist 
in locating such suspects, as well as a general appear-
ance ﬁ le of con artists (even though photographs are not 
available). Th e FBI assists in investigating violations that 
occur on interstate conveyances such as planes, boats and 
trains. It also assists if there is evidence that radio, televi-
sion or telegraph was used in committing the crime or if a 
money order was sent to a person in another state. If the 
swindle exceeds $5,000, the FBI has jurisdiction under the 
FRAUD
Fraud is a general term used for deceit, trickery
 and cheating as well as to describe the activity 
of individuals who pretend to be what they are not. Legally, 
however, fraud has a narrower meaning.
Fraud is an intentional deception to cause a person to 
give up property or some lawful right. It differs from theft 
in that fraud uses deceit rather than stealth to obtain 
goods illegally.
Advances in technology and, in particular, the pro-
liferation of electronic commerce have given innovative 
criminals yet another way to commit fraud. Use of com-
puters to commit fraud is discussed in Chapter 17.
Fraud victims are in a good position to provide infor-
mation regarding suspects because they have had ﬁ rst-
hand dealings with the suspects.
Fraud includes conﬁ dence games, real estate fraud, 
insurance fraud, health care fraud, mass marketing fraud 
and fraud committed through counterfeiting or the use of 
checks or debit/credit cards. An increasingly serious and 
pervasive type of fraud is identity theft.
Because fraud often involves use of interstate commu-
nications devices (e.g., phones, computers), the mail system 
or ﬁ nancial and banking institutions, many, if not most, 
types of fraud fall under the jurisdiction of the FBI. How-
ever, if the value amount involved does not meet or exceed 
a minimum monetary threshold, the federal government 
may opt not to become involved in the case, leaving local 
jurisdictions to deal with many of these types of crimes.
CONFIDENCE GAMES
Conﬁ dence games have separated people from their 
money for centuries; in fact, con games were known as 
early as 100 bc. Changing times require changing tech-
niques, but four basic elements are always present: (1) 
locating a mark from whom to obtain money, (2) selecting 
the game, (3) conducting it and then (4) leaving the area 
as rapidly as possible.
A conﬁ dence game obtains money or property by 
a trick, device or swindle that takes advantage of a vic-
tim’s trust in the swindler. Th e conﬁ dence game purports 
to oﬀ er a get-rich-quick scheme. Th e victim is sworn to 
secrecy and told that telling anyone could cause the deal 

CHAPTER 14 | Larceny/Theft, Fraud and White-Collar Crime | 433
REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE FRAUD
In many areas of the country, real estate scams, such as 
phantom down payments and “ﬂ ipping,” are costing lend-
ers and homebuyers tremendous amounts of money. Th e 
FBI states, “People want to believe their homes are worth 
more than they are, and throughout the U.S., there are 
people who try to capitalize on the situation and make an 
easy proﬁ t” (Financial Crimes, 2007, p.D11).
According to the FBI, “Each mortgage fraud scheme 
contains some type of ‘material misstatement, misrepre-
sentation, or omission relied upon by an underwriter or 
lender to fund, purchase or insure a loan’” (Financial Crimes 
Report, 2007). Common mortgage fraud schemes include 
equity skimming, property ﬂ ipping, air loans, foreclosure 
schemes, inﬂ ated appraisals, nominee loans/straw buyers 
and silent seconds. 
Common equity skimming schemes involve use of cor-
porate shell companies, corporate identity theft and use of 
bankruptcy/foreclosure to dupe homeowners and inves-
tors. In property ﬂ ipping, the oﬀ ender buys a property 
near its estimated market value, artiﬁ cially inﬂ ates the 
property value through a false appraisal and then resells 
(ﬂ ips) the property, often within days of the original pur-
chase, for a greatly increased price. Th is process can be 
repeated several times with a single property through the 
help of the ﬂ ipper’s associates, ultimately leading to fore-
closure by the victim lenders. Many deals rely on fraudu-
lent appraisals inﬂ ating the property’s value. Although 
ﬂ ipping per se is not illegal, it often involves mortgage 
fraud, which is illegal.
Air loans involve a nonexistent property loan where 
there is usually no collateral. For example, a broker invents 
borrowers and properties, establishes accounts for pay-
ments and maintains custodial accounts for escrows. 
Foreclosure schemes involve perpetrators identifying 
homeowners at risk of foreclosure or already in foreclo-
sure and misleading them into believing they can save 
their homes in exchange for a transfer of the deed and up-
front fees. Th e perpetrator then either remortgages the 
property or pockets the fees.
Inﬂ ated appraisals, as the name suggests, involves 
an appraiser acting in collusion with a borrower and 
providing a misleading appraisal report to the lender. 
Nominee loans or straw buyers conceal the identity of 
the borrower through use of a nominee who allows the 
borrower to use the nominee’s name and credit history 
to apply for a loan. In the silent second, the buyer of 
a property borrows the down payment from the seller 
through the issuance of a nondisclosed second mortgage. 
Th e primary lender believes the borrower has invested 
his own money as the down payment, when in fact, it is 
borrowed.
Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act. (Many 
con games exceed this amount.) Postal authorities may 
assist investigators in cases in which con artists use the 
mails to execute their crimes.
Most states include con games in statutes relating to 
larceny by trick and to obtaining money under false pre-
tenses. Check the statutes in your jurisdiction for the spe-
ciﬁ c elements that must be proven.
Other Scams Online auction sites are becoming used 
more frequently to perpetuate scams. In referring to 
Craigslist, a free online bazaar used by about 30 million 
people each month, Pulkkinen (2008) reports, “Th e site 
is increasingly a spot to court victims, sell sex and pass 
stolen goods.” He deﬁ nes the site as a “digital haven for 
hucksters.” In addition, armed robbers are alleged to have 
used Craigslist to lure victims by posting ads online that 
oﬀ ered discounted iPhones. When the victims showed up 
to purchase the phones, they were robbed at gunpoint. 
New York police arrested four men, ages 18 to 20, who 
were charged with conspiracy, robbery and possession of 
weapons.
Other scams that investigators may be summoned to 
examine include
• • Easy-credit scams. Con artists target people who seek 
to repair damaged credit ratings by oﬀ ering credit 
cards in exchange for advanced payments or deposits.
• • Bogus prize oﬀ ers. Mail or phone announcements pro-
claim, “You’re a big winner!” Th e winner is instructed 
to wire money to cover taxes or fees to receive the 
“grand prize.”
• • Phony home repairs. Workmen knock on a door and 
explain that they are ﬁ nishing several jobs (rooﬁ ng, 
siding, driveways) in the neighborhood. Th ey have 
leftover material and can oﬀ er to ﬁ x anything at a 
great discount. Th ey may take a deposit or the entire 
payment and never return to complete the job, or they 
may begin the work and then claim the job is more 
involved than they had thought and state they will 
need additional payment to ﬁ nish the job.
• • Travel scams. Victims are promised an exciting, free 
vacation in an exotic location but must ﬁ rst provide a 
credit card number for “veriﬁ cation.”
• • Cyber-scams. Th e Internet oﬀ ers numerous sites to 
sell or trade merchandise, and con artists are taking 
advantage of this lucrative virtual swap shop to sell 
defective or nonexistent products.
Although it may be hard to believe that people would 
fall for some of these scams, con artists are extremely well 
versed and tend to target more typically vulnerable and 
trusting victims, such as the elderly.

434 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
nonproﬁ t group that addresses insurance-related ﬁ nancial 
crimes on a global basis (Financial Crimes Report, 2007).
Insurance fraud investigations often require the col-
laborative eﬀ orts of the FBI, NAIC, IAIFA, state fraud 
bureaus and state insurance regulators. In addition to 
traditional investigation methods, the FBI uses covert 
undercover investigations to apprehend fraudsters.
HEALTH CARE FRAUD
As with insurance fraud, health care fraud adds billions of 
dollars each year to U.S. health care costs. Noting that Medi-
care and Medicaid are the most visible programs aﬀ ected 
by such fraud, the FBI reports, “Estimates of fraudulent 
billings to health care programs, both public and private, 
are . . . between 3 and 10 percent of total health care expen-
ditures. Th e fraud schemes are not speciﬁ c to any general 
area, but are found throughout the entire country” (Finan-
cial Crimes Report, 2007). Th e FBI expects health care fraud 
to continue rising as people live longer. One of the most 
serious trends observed involves the increased number of 
medical professionals willing to risk patient harm in their 
fraud schemes, which can include unnecessary surgeries, 
dilution of cancer and other lifesaving drugs and fraudu-
lent lab tests (p.C3).
MASS MARKETING FRAUD
Th e FBI states, “Mass marketing fraud is a general term for 
frauds that exploit mass-communication media, such as 
telemarketing, mass mailings, and the Internet” (Financial 
Crimes Report, 2007). Although these fraud schemes take 
a variety of forms, they have in common use of false or 
deceptive representations to induce potential victims to 
make advance fee-type payments to fraud perpetrators.
One such fraud that has been around for decades is the 
Nigerian letter fraud, referred to as 4-1-9 Fraud by INTER
POL. Victims are contacted regarding substantial sums 
of money held in foreign accounts and are asked for their 
“assistance” in paying various fees to secure the funds trans-
fer to the United States in exchange for a portion of the total 
proceeds. Alternatively, victims are asked to act as a U.S. 
agent in securing the release of such funds and are provided 
with counterfeit instruments that are to be cashed to pay 
any required fees, only to discover they must reimburse their 
ﬁ nancial institution for cashing a counterfeit instrument.
Telemarketing fraud and other types of fraud using 
the telephone have proliferated, and the victims are pre-
dominantly the elderly. In one such scam, a “represen-
tative” informs potential victims that they have won a 
sweepstakes prize and that the company needs their name, 
address and Social Security number to process the award. 
Th e company then uses the Social Security number for 
INSURANCE FRAUD
Insurance is one of the largest industries in the United 
States, comprising more than 7,000 companies collect-
ing more than $1 trillion in annual premiums (Financial 
Crimes, 2007, p.F1). Insurance fraud aﬀ ects every policy-
holder in the form of higher premiums. According to the 
FBI, insurance fraud (not including health care insurance) 
costs the average American family $400 to $700 every year, 
for a total cost in excess of $40 billion.
Th e most prevalent type of insurance fraud involves 
premium diversion by insurance agents and brokers, where 
customers’ payments are pocketed for personal gain instead 
of being sent to the policy underwriter (Financial Crimes, 
2007, p.F1). Scams run by unauthorized, unregistered and 
unlicensed agents are also common and involve collecting 
premiums for nonexistent policies. Th e scam lasts as long 
as customers have no claims. Once claims start to be ﬁ led, 
the fraudster closes up shop and relocates. Th ese fraudu-
lent operations take advantage of individuals who seek 
high-risk lines of insurance for which few legitimate pro-
viders exist.
Another type of insurance fraud involves worker’s 
compensation, in which the con operator collects a pre-
mium without providing any legitimate protection against 
claims. Th is type of fraud can leave injured victims and 
families of deceased victims with little or no coverage to 
pay their medical bills.
Insurance companies are duty-bound to hold cus-
tomer premiums secure until a claim is made. However, 
when the economy takes a downturn and ﬁ nances become 
strained, some insurance executives fraudulently dip into 
this premium pool to cover their own company’s operat-
ing expenses. Th is illegal act leads to further illegal acts 
because accounting documents and ﬁ nancial statements 
must be doctored to cover up the misuse of customer pre-
miums (Financial Crimes Report, 2007).
Th e FBI has investigated and shut down several highly 
proﬁ table insurance fraud schemes. For example, in ﬁ scal 
year 2007, the agency handled more than 200 insurance 
fraud cases, with investigations leading to 39 indictments, 
47 convictions and the recovery of more than $27 million 
in restitution (Simpson, 2008). 
Insurance businesses are regulated primarily by the 
states in which they operate. Th e National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is a nonproﬁ t associa-
tion of state oﬃ  cials who help state insurance regulators 
achieve fundamental industry goals and serve the public 
interest. Th e NAIC assists the FBI in insurance fraud inves-
tigations, helping to identify those perpetrating fraud 
as well as the most commonly used schemes to commit 
insurance fraud. Th e FBI is also a member of the Interna-
tional Association of Insurance Fraud Agencies (IAIFA), a

• • Cramming involves billing consumers for unauthor-
ized, misleading or deceptive charges, such as a per-
sonal 800 number, paging and voice mail. Th e vendor 
levies the charge against a phone number, and the 
phone company is required by law to pass the charges 
on to the customer. Because the amounts are typically 
quite small, many customers never even notice they 
have been scammed.
• • Gouging refers to companies charging undisclosed 
fees when calls are made from pay phones or hotel 
rooms.
• • Sliding occurs when an unauthorized carrier switches 
a speciﬁ c call from the long-distance carrier.
• • Jamming refers to setting up roadblocks to make it 
diﬃ  cult to switch in-state long distance.
• • Fluﬃ  ng occurs when rates are increased without 
notiﬁ cation.
Caller ID can both enhance and hinder fraud investiga-
tions. It can identify perpetrators of fraud, but it can also 
pose a danger to oﬃ  cers who work undercover. Th ey may 
be exposed by having their phone numbers revealed to the 
criminals they call.
MAIL FRAUD
Mail fraud involves perpetuating scams through the 
mail—for example, bogus sweepstakes entries and notices. 
If mail fraud is suspected, police oﬃ  cers should contact 
the postal inspector through their local post oﬃ  ce. Postal 
authorities can assist in investigating if the scheme uses 
fraudulent purposes. Other scams simply involve inform-
ing the “winner,” aka victim, that he or she must ﬁ rst 
pay a service fee or tax for their prize and that once the 
payment has been received, the prize will be shipped. Of 
course, it never is. According to the FBI, “Telemarketing 
fraud, predominantly emanating from Canada, is a ﬂ our-
ishing crime problem with estimated losses to U.S. elderly 
citizens exceeding $500 million per year. In the past, it has 
been diﬃ  cult to prosecute Canadian telemarketers due to 
a variety of factors. However, substantial strides have been 
made to address these issues through the cross-border ini-
tiative, Canadian Eagle” (Financial Crimes Report, 2007).
A federal and state crackdown against telemarketing 
scams that have bilked thousands of consumers, many of 
them elderly, out of tens of millions of dollars was dubbed 
“Operation Tele-PHONEY.” Coordinated by the Federal 
Trade Commission, it was the largest such operation the 
FTC had ever coordinated. Th e sweep resulted in 180 
cases, including new civil charges against 13 telemarket-
ers that defrauded more than 500,000 consumers out of 
$100 million (Rugaber, 2008).
Frauds involving cell phones and personal communi-
cation services (PCS) are growing problems. One preva-
lent form of high-tech fraud is cloning, or “grabbing.” 
Individuals obtain legitimate account information by 
theft from an owner carrier or by on-the-air interception. 
Th e thief then programs the account number into a cell 
or PCS phone, creating a clone of the legitimate phone. 
Other telephone scams include:
• • Slamming is the unauthorized switch of a long-
distance carrier. 
While talking on a cell phone, a 
person is vulnerable to having the 
phone number “grabbed” and used 
by someone illegally.

counterfeiting, however, where products are sold far below 
the retail value of their legitimate counterparts, pirated 
music or movies impose much steeper prices on the con-
sumer. Th e FBI reports that movie pirating, estimated to 
have cost the major studios more than $6 billion world-
wide in 2005 (“Real Movie Pirate,” 2006), is an industry 
largely dominated by global criminal networks. However, 
individual movie pirates can also cause harm and make a 
signiﬁ cant amount of money through illegally recording 
and distributing motion pictures.
A case in point: Johnny Ray Gasca, 35, also known to 
law enforcement as “the prince of pirates.” Gasca would go 
to Hollywood theaters showing advanced movie screen-
ings, talk his way in as a movie industry insider and pro-
ceed to covertly record the ﬁ lm with high-end equipment 
he had smuggled in. Afterward, he’d rush home to mass-
produce copies and sell them online before the ﬁ lms began 
showing nationwide, claiming in his diary to clear as much 
as $4,500 a week. Fortunately, as the FBI stated in an 
account of the case (made as the result of an investigation 
by the cyber crimes division of the FBI in Los Angeles), 
Gasca had a habit of getting caught, betrayed repeatedly 
by the green glow coming from his camera bag:
Burbank police arrested him when he was caught at a 
screening of Th e Core. Th en at Anger Management. Th en

COUNTERFEITING
Counterfeiting of money generally comes to the attention 
of the police through a retailer or a bank. Th e U.S. Secret 
Service publishes pamphlets on identifying counterfeit 
money. Th e most common denominations of counterfeit 
money are $10, $20 and $50. Th e paper of authentic bills 
has red and blue ﬁ bers embedded in it, and the bills have 
intaglio (incised) printing. Th e portrait is detailed and life-
like; the Treasury seal is clear and distinct on sawtooth 
points; the borders are clear and unbroken; and serial 
numbers are distinct, evenly spaced, and the same color 
as the Treasury seal. INTERPOL’s Counterfeits and Secu-
rity Documents Branch (CSDB) has established programs 
that provide forensic support, operational assistance and 
technical databases to help federal and local investigators 
in counterfeit currency cases.
If a bill is suspect, give a receipt to the retailer or bank 
and turn the bill over to the nearest Secret Service oﬃ  ce 
to determine its authenticity. Obtain details of how the 
bill came into the complainant’s possession as well as an 
accurate description of the bill passer.
A felt-tip marker can instantly detect even the ﬁ nest-
quality counterfeit money with a single stroke. With the 
felt-tip marker, a dot or short line is made on the sus-
pected bill. If the “ink” remains gold, the bill is authentic. 
If the “ink” turns black, the bill needs scrutiny.
Counterfeit Identification Documents It is fairly easy 
for a perpetrator to make fake identiﬁ cation documents, 
a crime that can yield a large proﬁ t. Consider, for exam-
ple a Mexican man who entered the country illegally and 
quickly bought a fake green card and a Social Security card 
for $200. Within a few weeks, he had rented an apart-
ment in Philadelphia and was running his own document 
fraud business, making about $3,000 to $5,000 a week, 
more than the average start up cost of $2,000 and $3,000 
 (Poulos, 2007, p.106). 
Commercial Counterfeiting Currency is not the only 
item targeted for counterfeiting. Commercial counter-
feiting includes trademark counterfeiting and copyright 
pirating. Trademark counterfeiting is the illegal produc-
tion of cheap “knock-oﬀ s” of well-known pricier products, 
such as Rolex watches, Gucci handbags or Mont Blanc 
fountain pens. Copyright pirating is making—for trade 
or sale— unauthorized copies of copyrighted material, 
including print and sound media. In contrast to trademark

Th e insuﬃ  cient- or nonsuﬃ  cient-fund check falls into 
one of two categories: (1) accidental, in which people care-
lessly overdraw their checking account and are generally 
not prosecuted unless they do so habitually or (2) inten-
tional, in which professionals open a checking account with 
a small deposit, planning to write checks well in excess of 
the amount deposited. Th is is intent to defraud—a pros-
ecutable oﬀ ense.
Most bad checks are not written with intent to 
defraud. Th ey may have been mistakenly drawn against 
the wrong bank, the account balance may have been less 
than the writer thought, two or more people may have 
used the same account without knowing the actual bal-
ance or the bank may have made an error.
Issuing a worthless check occurs when the issuer does 
not intend the check to be paid. Proof of intent is shown 
if the issuer has no account or has insuﬃ  cient funds or 
credit or both. A worthless check is normally prosecuted 
the same as one for insuﬃ  cient funds. Obtain the check as 
well as statements from the person who accepted it, any 
other witnesses and bank representatives. Also obtain a 
signed complaint.
Forgery is signing someone else’s name to a docu-
ment with the intent to defraud. Th is includes actually 
signing the name and using a rubber stamp or a check 
writing machine. To prosecute, obtain the forged check 
or document, statements from the person whose name 
is forged, any witnesses to the transaction and the testi-
mony of a handwriting expert if necessary. Blank checks 
are often obtained through burglaries or oﬃ  ce thefts 
committed by professionals. Th e check is authentic and 
therefore easier to cash once the endorsement is forged.
It is also forgery to alter the amount on a check or to 
change the name of the payee. Th e person who initially 
draws the check must testify as to the authorized amount 
and payee. It is also forgery to change a name on a charge 
account slip.
Investigating bad or fraudulent checks requires pre-
cise details about the check and the entire transaction. 
Th e check itself is the main evidence. Carefully examine 
the front and back of the check and note peculiarities. 
Describe the check: type, ﬁ rm name and whether it is per-
sonal, payroll, federal or state. Was it written in pencil or 
ink or typed? Were any special stamps used? Was any-
thing altered: the payee, the date, the amount? Was the 
signature forged? Were there erasures or misspellings? 
Were local names and addresses used? Put the check in a 
protective polyethylene envelope or plastic container so it 
can also be processed for ﬁ ngerprints.
Where was the check passed? Who took it? Were there 
other witnesses? If so, obtain their names and addresses. 
8 Mile. Our law enforcement partners called us in to 
search Gasca’s apartment and there it all was: things 
like two video camcorders, a micro-camera built onto a 
trouser belt, two DVD recorders, the 11 linked VCRs, a 
stolen Social Security card, and his two diaries, which 
happily chronicled all the bad things he’d been doing.
 
Gasca later threatened to sell up to 20 more unre-
leased movies online and “laugh all the way to jail” 
unless the Motion Picture Association of America 
(MPAA) helped him get his equipment back. He was 
charged in April 2003 (the ﬁ rst person ever indicted 
on federal charges of movie piracy) . . . and was placed 
in his lawyer’s custody to discuss legal strategy . . . at 
which point he disappeared without a trace. Two years 
passed before U.S. Marshals got a tip and chased him 
down at a motel in Kissimmee, Florida. What was he 
doing? Illegally copying movies. Of course.
 
Gasca was tried in Los Angeles and found guilty on 
eight criminal counts. (“Pirates of Hollywood,” 2005)
In 2006, he was sentenced to 7 years in a federal prison 
(Tyler, 2006).
It is also a felony in most states to pirate sound record-
ings, and nearly every state has some type of law related 
to pirated recordings. Despite the illegalities of this busi-
ness, the practice continues, particularly on the Internet, 
as discussed in Chapter 17.
CHECK FRAUD
Losses from bad-check operations cannot be determined 
exactly because no single clearinghouse gathers statistics 
on this oﬀ ense. Estimates range from $815 million to $5 
to $10 billion annually.
Checks used to defraud include personal, business, 
counter, draft and universal checks, as well as money orders. 
Fraudulent checks are made to appear genuine in many ways. 
Th e check blank can be similar to the one normally used 
and diﬃ  cult to detect. In fact, many fraudulent and forged 
checks are written on stolen check blanks. Handwriting is 
practiced to look authentic. Various stamps, check writers, 
date stamps and cancellation stamps are placed on the front 
and back of the check to give it a genuine appearance.
In some cases, the checks are not stolen but handed 
over willingly to thieves—for a price. Th e checking account 
owner beneﬁ ts by being paid more money than is actually 
in the account, while the thief is allowed to cash checks or 
purchase merchandise for a few days before the bank is 
notiﬁ ed of the check “theft.”
Common types of check fraud are issuing insufﬁ cient-
fund or worthless checks and committing forgery.

438 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
purchases. Fraudulent orders are placed, and if the victims 
do not review their bills, the fraud can go completely unde-
tected: “Th e biggest problem that police face in dealing with 
this crime is that victims seldom report credit fraud. Most 
credit fraud is reported directly to the credit card compa-
nies, who in turn rarely hold the card member responsible 
for the losses” (Petrocelli, 2008a, p.16). 
Most people involved in credit card fraud are also 
involved in other types of crimes. Th e credit cards are 
obtained principally by muggers, robbers, burglars, pick-
pockets, purse snatchers, thieves and prostitutes. Th ey 
can also be obtained through fraudulent application or by 
manufacturing counterfeit cards.
Credit cards can be stolen by mailbox thieves who may 
have been tipped oﬀ  by a postal employee, by someone at 
apartment boxes or by dishonest employees of the card 
manufacturer. Cards from the manufacturer are desirable 
because they are unsigned. Criminals can sign their hold-
er’s name in their own handwriting. Th ese cards also pro-
vide more time for use before the theft is discovered. For 
the same reasons, these cards are more valuable for resale 
to other fraudulent users. To take maximum advantage 
without being detected, the criminal obtains the card by 
fraud, theft or reproduction, uses it for a short time and 
then disposes of it.
The elements of the crime of larceny by debit or credit 
card include
• • Possessing a credit card obtained by theft or fraud,
• • by which services or goods are obtained,
• • through unauthorized signing of the cardholder’s 
name.
To use another person’s debit or credit card illegally, 
the criminal must either forge the cardholder’s signature 
on sales slips or alter the signature on the card. Th e lat-
ter is made diﬃ  cult by colored or symbol undertones that 
indicate when erasures and alterations are attempted.
Th e criminal must also operate under the ﬂ oor-release 
limit to avoid having a clerk check the card’s validity. Th e 
ﬂ oor-release limit is the maximum dollar amount that 
may be paid with a charge card without getting authoriza-
tion from the central oﬃ  ce unless the business assumes 
liability for any loss. Th e limit is set by each company and 
is subject to change. It can be $50 or $100; in some gas 
stations, it is only $10. Zero ﬂ oor release means that 
all credit card transactions must be checked. A suspicious 
merchant usually runs a check regardless of the amount 
of credit requested. Often, the criminal is asked for addi-
tional identiﬁ cation, which is diﬃ  cult to produce unless 
other identiﬁ cation was also obtained in the theft.
If currency was given, what were the denominations? 
Obtain an exact description of the check passer. Was the 
suspect known to the person taking the check? Had he 
or she ever done business with the store before? What 
identiﬁ cation was used: driver’s license, Social Security 
card, bank identiﬁ cation card, credit card? Was the sus-
pect alone? If with others, what did they look like? What 
approach was used? What words were spoken? If the check 
passer used a car, did anyone notice what it looked like or 
the license number?
The National Fraudulent Check File Professional check 
passers who write several checks in a city in a short time and 
then move to another city or state often use the same tech-
nique. Th e FBI’s National Fraudulent Check File helps iden-
tify such people and often shows a pattern of travel. Th e FBI 
maintains other ﬁ les that assist in tracing bad-check writ-
ers. Th ese include ﬁ les on check-writer standards, water-
marks, conﬁ dence operators, safety paper standards, rubber 
stamps, anonymous letters and typewriter standards.
DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD FRAUD
A debit card, sometimes called a check card, refers to a card 
presented to a merchant exactly as a credit card would be, 
with the amount instantly credited before veriﬁ cation of 
the existence of funds is established. A credit card refers to 
any credit plate, charge plate, courtesy card or other iden-
tiﬁ cation card or device used to obtain a cash advance, a 
loan or credit or to purchase or lease property or services 
on the issuer’s credit or that of the holder. Th e holder is 
the person to whom such a card is issued and who agrees 
to pay obligations arising from its use.
Use of debit and credit cards, referred to by the Depart-
ment of Justice as access devices, has become a way of life in 
the United States. Th e cards have opened a new avenue for 
criminals to obtain goods and services by theft and fraud. 
Losses from debit and credit card fraud are in the billions 
annually, with U.S. businesses absorbing $3.2 billion in 
losses in 2007 from online credit card fraud alone, a ﬁ gure 
that excludes fraudulent purchases made from retail stores 
(Petrocelli, 2008a, p.16). Despite such losses, these cards, 
like checks, reduce cash thefts from individuals and reduce 
the amount of cash-on-hand in places such as ﬁ lling sta-
tions, as well as the amount of cash transferred to banks 
from businesses. Use of these cards also aids in identifying 
criminals who have the cards in their possession, more so 
than does cash, which is not as easily identiﬁ able.
Because credit card fraud is often spread through-
out several jurisdictions, many police departments place 
low priority on this type of oﬀ ense. Further complicat-
ing this crime, many businesses accept credit card phone 

CHAPTER 14 | Larceny/Theft, Fraud and White-Collar Crime | 439
Examine credit cards for alteration of the signature 
panel; the numbers or name can be shortened by using 
a razor blade to shave them oﬀ . New numbers can be 
entered to defeat the “hot card” list. Merchandise on sales 
slips found in the criminal’s possession can provide fur-
ther proof of illegal use. If the service obtained is a motel 
room, telephone calls can be traced to pinpoint accom-
plices. Clerks who handle the transactions often initial the 
sales slip, which enables the company or store to furnish 
the name of a witness.
As serious as credit card fraud is, it can have an even 
graver consequence—identity theft.
IDENTITY THEFT
A type of theft that can wreak enormous havoc on a 
person’s credit and ﬁ nancial security is identity theft. 
Identity theft, currently the fastest growing crime in the 
country, has become perhaps the deﬁ ning crime of the 
information age, with an estimated 9 million or more inci-
dents each year (Identity Th eft, 2007). Approximately one 
in four people in the United States will fall victim to iden-
tity theft at some point in their lives (Barton and  Higgins, 
2008, p.14). 
Identity theft became a federal crime in the United 
States in 1998 with the passage of the Identity Th eft and 
Assumption Deterrence Act. Before this act, no nationally 
accepted deﬁ nition of identity theft existed, a factor that 
complicated the investigation and prosecution of these 
oﬀ enses. However, this act deﬁ nes identity theft broadly, 
making it easier for prosecutors to conduct their cases. 
Most states have passed identity theft legislation, but the 
laws vary from state to state. Th e National Crime Victim-
ization Survey (NCVS) deﬁ nes identity theft as including 
three behaviors (Baum, 2006, p.1):
 1. Unauthorized use or attempted use of existing credit 
cards
 2. Unauthorized use or attempted use of other existing 
accounts such as checking accounts
 3. Misuse of personal information to obtain new 
accounts or loans, or to commit other crimes
One diﬃ  culty in deﬁ ning identity theft has been 
the considerable number of diﬀ erent crimes that it may 
involve, including check fraud, credit cards, check cards, 
immigration fraud, counterfeiting, forgery, terrorism 
using false or stolen identities, theft of various kinds 
(pickpocketing, robbery, burglary or mugging) and postal 
fraud. Each month, on average, the Federal Trade Commis-
sion (FTC) enters 21,000 identity theft complaints into 
its Identity Th eft Clearinghouse (Crane and Leach, 2007, 
Credit cards are attractive to criminals who operate 
interstate. Such criminals know that few companies will 
pay the witness fees for out-of-state prosecutions and 
that extradition is diﬃ  cult to obtain unless the losses are 
great.
Many laws cover larceny or fraudulent use of credit 
cards. Possessing a forged credit card or one signed by a 
person other than the cardholder is the basis for a charge 
of possession of a forged instrument. Possessing two such 
cards is the basis for presuming intent to defraud. Illegally 
making or embossing a credit card or changing the expi-
ration date or account number also subjects the person 
to a charge of intent to defraud. In most jurisdictions, it 
is not necessary to prove that the person possessing the 
card signed it. People who have machinery or devices to 
counterfeit or forge credit cards can be charged with pos-
session of forgery devices.
It is larceny to fail to return a found credit card or to 
keep one sent by mistake if the ﬁ nder or recipient uses the 
card. Airline tickets bought with a stolen or forged credit 
card are also stolen property. Th e degree of larceny, petty or 
grand, is determined by the ticket’s value. It is also larceny 
to misrepresent credit information or identity to obtain a 
credit card. If a person sells his or her credit card to some-
one who uses it and the original cardholder then refuses to 
pay, the cardholder can be charged with larceny.
Some merchants and businesspeople commit credit 
card fraud themselves. For example, a merchant may 
direct an employee to make more than one authorized 
record of charge per sale and then forward the charges 
for payment or raise the amount on the credit card charge 
slip. Th is is larceny, with the degree determined by the 
diﬀ erence between the actual charge and that forwarded 
for payment. It is also forgery because a document was 
altered. It is an attempt to commit larceny if such actions 
are not completed because of intervening circumstances 
such as the cardholder becoming suspicious.
Most large credit card issuers assign personnel to 
work with local police in cases of credit card larceny. Th ese 
people can be contacted for help or for information on the 
system used to manufacture and issue the cards.
When investigating credit card fraud, obtain samples 
of handwriting from sales slips signed by the suspect. If a 
card is obtained by false credit application, handwriting 
is available on the credit application form. If the card is 
used for a car rental, other information about the rented 
vehicle is available. Gas stations often record the state and 
license number of vehicles they service. Driver’s licenses 
are used for identiﬁ cation. If a suspect is arrested, obtain 
a warrant to search the suspect’s vehicle and residence for 
copies of sales slips or tickets obtained with the card, even 
though it has been discarded or sold.

other, in South Africa, was named Executive Outcomes 
Inc. (with a plural Outcomes). Th e crime began in late 2001 
when a British debt collector called the Michigan-based 
company asking if they, Executive Outcome, wanted help 
collecting $23 million owed by the government of Sierra 
Leone for military equipment, security and training. Th e 
debt was legitimate but was actually owed to the other 
ﬁ rm, Executive Outcomes, a half a world away. Seeing an 
opportunity to make some money oﬀ  a confusing situa-
tion, the American company set about forging documents 
to claim their interest in this debt. When the South African 
company found out what was happening, a legal skirmish 
followed, and the conﬂ ict turned malicious. A representa-
tive of the South African company called the police and 
a special FBI agent assigned as a legal attaché in London 
took over the case. With a search warrant, they searched 
the American company and found evidence of forged doc-
uments. Th e perpetrators both pled guilty to conspiracy, 
wire fraud and other charges and received prison time and 
p.18). In fact, identity theft topped the list of consumer 
complaints made to the FTC in 2006, aﬀ ecting more than 
8 million Americans and totaling nearly $50 billion in 
losses  (Spadanuta, 2007, p.18).
Identity theft tops the list of fraud-related complaints 
ﬁ led with the FTC.
When President George W. Bush signed the Identity 
Th eft Penalty Enhancement Act in 2004, he stressed, “Th e 
crime of identity theft undermines the basic trust on 
which our economy depends. When a person takes out an 
insurance policy, or makes an online purchase, or opens a 
savings account, he or she must have conﬁ dence that per-
sonal ﬁ nancial information will be protected and treated 
with care. Identity theft harms not only its direct victims, 
but also many businesses and customers whose conﬁ -
dence is shaken. Like other forms of stealing, identity 
theft leaves the victim poor and feeling terribly violated.”
Identity theft is especially prevalent on college cam-
puses. Identity thieves know this and hang around cam-
pus post oﬃ  ce boxes to gain access to applications and ﬁ ll 
them in themselves. Complicating the problem is the fact 
that there are more than 200 valid forms of ID or driver’s 
licenses issued in the United States.
Identity theft has proliferated as use of the Internet 
has grown. Th e FTC notes that thieves steal identities 
through dumpster diving, skimming (using a special stor-
age device when processing a card), completing a change of 
address form to divert billing statements to another loca-
tion, “old-fashioned” stealing and phishing (About Identity 
Th eft, 2008). Phishing involves tricking consumers into 
replying to an e-mail or accessing a Web site that appears 
to be associated with a legitimate business but is actually 
a carefully concocted hoax intended to strip consumers 
of personal identifying information that can be used for 
criminal purposes, such as identity theft and fraud (Fig-
ure 14.3). A Gartner survey showed that phishing attacks 
escalated in 2007 with more than $3 billion lost to these 
attacks. Debit cards were the ﬁ nancial instruments tar-
geted most often by fraudsters (“Gartner Survey Shows,” 
2007). Figure 14.4 shows the four types of identity theft, 
based on the combinations of commitment and motive.
Th e FBI says that identity theft went to a new level 
when one company tried to steal $23 million by pretending 
to be another company (“Corporate Takeover,” 2007). Th e 
scam was made possible by a remarkable coincidence: two 
private security companies with nearly identical names. 
One, based in Michigan, was named Executive Outcome 
Inc. (note the singular form of the word Outcome). Th e

a police report proving that he has suﬀ ered a theft of iden-
tity, the lengthy, diﬃ  cult process of repairing the victim’s 
damaged credit becomes somewhat easier through use of 
certain privileges not available to other consumers, such 
as blocking fraudulent trade lines on credit reports and 
obtaining the suspect’s credit application. 
Databases that investigators should search include 
the Financial Crimes Database, which includes informa-
tion on stolen U.S. mail as well as stolen and fraudulently 
used checks and credit, ATM and debit cards. Th e FTC’s 
Identity Th eft Data Clearinghouse is a national identity 
theft database containing more than 815,000 victim com-
plaints, allowing investigators to search for information 
on identity theft victims and suspects across the coun-
try. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) 
is another valuable resource for investigators because it 
links approximately three dozen independent databases 
in three main areas: law enforcement, ﬁ nance and com-
merce. Yet another valuable database is the FBI’s National 
Crime Information Center (NCIC) Identity Th eft File, 
which became operational in April 2005 and is designed 
to aid both police oﬃ  cers and crime victims (Keenan and 
O’Neal, 2007, p.32).
With authorization from the victim, an investigator 
can get the victim’s identity theft–related transaction 
records from creditors without ﬁ rst obtaining a subpoena, 
under the 2003 amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act, section 609(e).
In addition to victim interviews, investigators should 
also seek information from informants. Other possible 
sources of informants include peripheral players in the 
identity theft, such as store employees who sold to sus-
pects they knew were using stolen identities.
Identity theft is unique in that it is a crime in itself 
and is an MO to commit other crimes. A challenge for 
investigators, therefore, may be deciding what oﬀ ense to 
accuse a suspect of involvement in. 
Investigators should recognize the tools of the iden-
tity thief’s trade, including blank checks, laminating 
machines, laptop computers, typewriters, color scanners 
and copiers and skimming devices, through which a user 
can swipe a credit card and retrieve information from the 
card’s magnetic strip. McQuiggin (2008, p.18) points out, 
“A surprising amount of information may be gleaned from 
forensic examination of recovered electronic devices. Th is 
is obvious when seizing computers, cellular telephones, 
and similar devices. . . . What is not generally known, how-
ever, is that seized ATM skimmers, modiﬁ ed POS termi-
nals, hidden cameras, and similar devices may also yield 
valuable forensic clues for investigators if the technical 
details of their construction are properly evaluated.”
paid $51,000 to the South African representative they 
threatened. 
An eﬀ ective police response to and investigation of 
identity theft will very likely require a multijurisdictional 
approach. Th e investigation begins with the victim report-
ing the theft to police per the provisions of the 2004 Fair 
and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act). Th is 
federal law provides new rights and remedies to identity 
theft victims, but with a catch—the victim must ﬁ rst ﬁ le 
a police report. Although this would appear to be common 
sense on the part of the victim, the act was intended pri-
marily to serve as an impetus to law enforcement in devel-
oping identity theft prevention and investigation policies 
and protocols. To comply with the FACT Act, agencies 
must now have personnel trained in completing identity 
theft crime reports; investigating identity theft crimes, 
including the collection of evidence; and preparing iden-
tity theft cases for possible prosecution. Once a victim has

cases, perpetrators of white-collar crime do not “look like” 
criminals—they are often highly educated, socially 
accepted people who hold high-level positions of trust 
within a company. Because of such positions, high-level 
company executives are able to commit crimes involving 
millions of dollars.
White-collar crime makes headlines: the frauds and 
crooked accounting involved in the Enron and WorldCom 
bankruptcies, the scandals involving Tyco International 
and Adelphia Communications, and the ImClone stock 
debacle that sent the all-things-domestic guru Martha 
Stewart to prison for 5 months. With CEOs pocketing 
Because the average American possesses 20 IDs in 
various forms—credit cards, bank accounts, personal 
identiﬁ cation numbers (PINs), Social Security numbers, 
driver’s licenses, username/password combinations—the 
key to stopping identity theft may be biometrics, which 
relies on unique biological properties to positively identify 
an individual. Biometric identiﬁ ers include ﬁ ngerprints, 
voiceprints, retinal scans and facial recognition—IDs that 
are extremely diﬃ  cult to steal or forge.
Th e Identity Th eft and Assumption Deterrence Act 
allows prison sentences as long as 25 years for those con-
victed of the oﬀ ense and also enables victims to seek res-
titution for identiﬁ able losses and for expenses related to 
restoring their credit rating.
Collaborative Efforts In May 2006, the President’s 
Task Force on Identity Th eft was established, co-chaired 
by the attorney general and the chair of the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC). Its mission is to provide a coordinated 
approach among government agencies to combat identity 
theft (Identity Th eft Is a Crime, 2008). It is also beneﬁ cial 
for law enforcement to form partnerships with the FTC, 
the National White Collar Crime Commission (NW3C), 
the Postal Inspection Service, the Secret Service and the 
FBI (Berger, 2008, p.14).
A three-year “trial” partnership has been formed 
between Bank of America and the International Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police (IACP) (Green, 2007, p.14): “Four 
working groups composed of law enforcement leaders, 
bankers, prosecutors, and government oﬃ  cials have been 
busy developing resources for consumers, victims, the law 
enforcement community, and the banking industry. . . . Th e 
project’s ﬁ rst accomplishment was the launch of a compre-
hensive Web site, www.idsafety.org. Th e site—a ﬁ rst for the 
banking industry and the law enforcement community—
was named ‘Best in Class’ by the Interactive Media Awards, 
its highest award.”
Just as identity theft can overlap with and include 
other crimes such as credit card fraud and counterfeiting, 
identity theft can also be classiﬁ ed as white-collar crime.
WHITE-COLLAR CRIME
White-collar crime, also called economic or
 corporate crime, involves illegal acts charac-
terized by fraud, concealment or a violation of trust and 
does not depend on the actual or threatened use of physi-
cal force or violence. Many instances of larceny/theft and 
fraud can also be classiﬁ ed as white-collar crime. In some

information from a variety of types of credit and debit cards.

low-level employees’ crimes consist of pilferage. Many 
employees do not see taking oﬃ  ce supplies or placing per-
sonal long-distance phone calls from a work phone as dis-
honest. However, they would not think of doing the same 
thing in a place where they did not work. Over time, the 
losses from pilferage are often much more than what a 
high-level employee might embezzle.
Few law enforcement agencies are equipped to inves-
tigate white-collar crime, encouraging such investigations 
to be conducted internally by in-house or contracted pri-
vate investigators. Th e NW3C links criminal justice agen-
cies across international borders and bridges the gap 
between local and state criminal justice agencies. Th is 
millions, even billions, of dollars, investors and pension-
ers lost everything. Th is is probably the ultimate white-
collar crime, perhaps better termed corporate terrorism. 
Th e American Society of Industrial Security (ASIS) Stand-
ing Committee on White-Collar Crime has changed its 
name to the Economic Crime Committee.
Much white-collar crime is never reported because 
it involves top-level executives of organizations that do 
not want their reputations damaged. White-collar crimes 
may be committed by individuals against other individu-
als such as family members, lawyers, real estate agents, 
insurance agents and physicians. Th ey may be committed 
against organizations by insiders such as business part-
ners, oﬃ  ce managers, computer programmers and senior 
executives. White-collar crimes may also be committed 
by individuals with no relationship to the victim, such as 
corporate spies, forgers, counterfeiters, computer hack-
ers and information pirates. Diﬀ erences exist in how to 
deﬁ ne white-collar crime and what types of other crimes 
should fall within this classiﬁ cation.
White-collar or economic crime includes (1) securities 
and commodities fraud; (2) insurance fraud; (3) health 
care and medical fraud; (4) telemarketing fraud; (5) credit 
card and check fraud; (6) consumer fraud, illegal com-
petition and deceptive practices; (7) bankruptcy fraud; 
(8) computer-related fraud; (9) bank fraud, embezzle-
ment and pilferage; (10) bribes, kickbacks and payoffs; 
(11) money laundering; (12) election law violations; (13) 
corruption of public ofﬁ cials; (14) copyright violations; 
(15) computer crimes; (16) environmental crimes; and (17) 
receiving stolen property.
Although traditionally law enforcement and the gen-
eral public have focused on street crimes rather than white-
collar crime, two recent studies show that this is no longer 
the case. Piquero, Carmichael and Piquero (2008, p.306) 
report that two-thirds of their sample believed that the 
resources allocated to deal with white-collar crime should 
be at least as much as—if not more than—that which is 
spent on street crime. Unnever, Benson and Cullen (2008,

tough on corporate illegality.
Investigate these crimes as you would any larceny or 
fraud case. Whether they are felonies or misdemeanors 
depends on the value involved.
White-collar crimes can be committed by any 
employee within a business or organization. However, 
low-level employees usually do not have the opportunity 
to steal large amounts from their employers. Most often,

and ﬁ led the largest bankruptcy action in U.S. history. Ebbers was 
convicted of nine felonies that carried a maximum prison term of 85

securities fraud and other illegal accounting practices. 
Th ese types of corporate fraud are generally discovered 
during routine auditing procedures and are often jointly 
investigated by the SEC and the FBI. In the WorldCom 
case, the company and its executives have also been inves-
tigated by two congressional committees.
MONEY LAUNDERING
Money laundering is converting illegally earned (dirty) 
cash to one or more alternative (clean) forms to conceal 
its illegal origin and true ownership. Drug traﬃ  ckers and 
other racketeers who accumulate large cash inventories 
face serious risks of conﬁ scation and punishment if con-
siderable, unexplained cash hoards are discovered. For 
these criminals to fully beneﬁ t from their illicit activities, 
they must ﬁ rst convert those cash proceeds to an alterna-
tive medium—one that is both easier than cash to use in 
everyday commerce and avoids pointing, even indirectly, 
to the illegal activity that generated it.
Federal laws that drive the need for money launder-
ing include the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970, the ﬁ rst 
major piece of legislation to address the problem and 
require the reporting of certain cash transactions. Speciﬁ c 
sections of this act include
• • 31 U.S.C. § 5313: requires U.S. banks and other ﬁ nan-
cial institutions to report cash transactions exceeding 
$10,000.
• • 31 U.S.C. § 5324: prohibits intentionally dividing cash 
sums exceeding $10,000 into smaller amounts so as 
to evade detection by ducking in under the required 
reporting threshold.
Other federal laws pertaining to money laundering 
include
• • 18 U.S.C. § 982: allows the seizure of all property or 
money associated with a money-laundering scheme 
and the forfeiture of such assets to the federal 
government.
• • 18 U.S.C. § 1951: the Hobbs Act; addresses govern-
ment corruption and makes illegal the act of extortion, 
through the actual or threatened use of violence or 
fear, exercised by someone in a position of authority 
or oﬃ  cial capacity, for the purpose of personal gain.
• • 26 U.S.C. § 7201 and § 7206(1): prohibits the ﬁ ling of 
a false federal income tax return or the commission of 
tax evasion through failure to report income.
• • 26 U.S.C. § 60501: requires all entities (individuals or 
organizations) engaged in commerce to report all cash 
transactions exceeding $10,000.
center provides assistance in preventing, investigating 
and prosecuting economic crime.
CORPORATE FRAUD
Corporate fraud has gained national attention in recent 
years. Despite all the media coverage and heightened scru-
tiny of business practices in corporations nationwide, the 
FBI anticipates no reduction in the number of such cases 
in the foreseeable future. As noted in the Financial Crimes 
Report to the Public (2007), corporate fraud remains the top 
priority of the FBI’s Financial Crimes Section. FBI investiga-
tions show that corporate fraud involves such activities as 
falsiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial information (“cooking the books”); 
self-dealing by corporate insiders, including insider trading 
and kickbacks; fraud in connection with an otherwise legit-
imately operated mutual or hedge fund; and obstruction of 
justice designed to conceal criminal conduct Many cases of 
corporate fraud involve securities and commodities. Th e 
FBI’s Economic Crimes Unit Web site helps put into per-
spective the serious consequences of such illegal activities:
Th e economic stability of the United States and the 
soundness of the nation’s ﬁ nancial markets are directly 
related to the integrity of the securities and commodi-
ties markets. Th e trading volume in the United States’ 
securities and commodities markets has grown dra-
matically over the last decade. Th is growth has led to an 
increase in fraud and misconduct by investors, execu-
tives, shareholders, and other market participants. 
Securities regulators and other prominent groups have 
estimated that securities and commodities fraud totals 
approximately $40 billion per year. Th e fraudulent 
schemes perpetrated in the securities and commodities 
markets can ultimately have a devastating impact on 
the viability and operation of those very markets.
Th e highly publicized Enron scandal involved 
numerous illegal practices committed over several years 
by high-ranking company executives who sought to hide 
Enron’s growing debt and keep perceived stock market 
value high. Th e deception and fraud began to receive 
notice when, in October 2001, the company made public 
the fact that it was actually worth $1.2 billion less than 
previously reported. Th is announcement set oﬀ  an inves-
tigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC), which uncovered a tangled conspiracy between 
Enron executives, investment banking partners and 
members of Enron’s accounting ﬁ rm to commit securi-
ties fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering and 
insider trading.
Other notable corporate fraud cases have included 
WorldCom and ImClone, companies both charged with 

CHAPTER 14 | Larceny/Theft, Fraud and White-Collar Crime | 445
The FBI’s proactive, two-pronged approach to investigat-
ing money laundering includes
• • Prong 1: Investigating the underlying criminal 
activity. If there is no criminal activity, or speciﬁ ed 
unlawful activity that generates illicit proceeds, 
then there can be no money laundering.
• • Prong 2: A parallel ﬁ nancial investigation to 
uncover the ﬁ nancial infrastructure of the criminal 
organization. This involves following the money and 
discerning how it ﬂ ows through an organization and 
what steps are taken to conceal, disguise or hide 
the proceeds (Financial Crimes Report, 2007).
Investigators should routinely monitor the anti–
money laundering initiatives of other countries. Th e 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an international 
assembly of member countries deemed to have strong 
anti–money laundering controls. Although FATF has no 
enforcement authority, its value lies in information shar-
ing and promoting cooperation among nations. FATF’s 
member-country Web sites are resources for information 
on current methods and trends in money laundering and 
the investigative techniques used to uncover them.
Investigators should carefully scrutinize the busi-
ness activity of the suspected launderer, paying particu-
lar attention to cash-intensive businesses like restaurants 
and bars, import/export companies and diamond and ﬁ ne 
jewelry businesses. Furthermore, know your community 
and the surrounding area.
EMBEZZLEMENT
Embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of prop-
erty by a person to whom it has been entrusted. Th e prop-
erty is then used by the embezzler or another person 
contrary to the terms of the trust. Th e owner retains title 
to the property during the trust period. Th e property so 
entrusted may be real or personal property. Even though 
the title remains with the owner, the embezzler usually 
has control through appointment as agent, servant,  bailee 
or trustee. Because of the relationship between owner 
and embezzler, the embezzler has custody of the prop-
erty. Most embezzlements involve employees. Most bank 
losses are from embezzlement, often involving large sums 
of money.
Businesses, industries and other ﬁ nancial institu-
tions besides banks are also victims of embezzlement. 
Embezzlement includes committing petty theft over 
time, “kiting” accounts receivable, overextending credit 
and cash returns, falsifying accounts payable records 
• • Th e Money Laundering Control Act of 1986.
• • Th e Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
• • Th e 2001 USA PATRIOT (Providing Appropriate Tools 
Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism) 
Act, which created a new money laundering statute, 
18 U.S.C. § 5316, to deal with bulk cash smuggling.
Th e basic process of laundering money begins with 
placement of the funds into the legitimate U.S. market. 
Common methods of placement include creating shell cor-
porations or fake cash-intensive businesses and smurf-
ing, more technically known as structuring, whereby 
large amounts of cash are broken into increments less 
than $10,000, to avoid federal reporting requirements, 
and deposited into various bank accounts.
Th e second step in the laundering process is layer-
ing, where the money is cleaned by moving it around 
through a series of elaborate transactions, often involv-
ing oﬀ shore bank accounts and international business 
companies (IBCs). Th ese multiple, complex transactions 
aim to obscure the connection between the money and 
the criminal group and to continue until the organization 
feels conﬁ dent the money is adequately clean.
Th e third and ﬁ nal step in the money laundering cycle 
is integration, where criminals repatriate their money 
through seemingly legitimate business transactions. For 
example, the launderer creates a bogus export company 
in a free trade zone and a bogus import company owned 
through an IBC in a diﬀ erent country. A trading relation-
ship is established where the exporter sends nonexistent 
goods or goods invoiced at greatly inﬂ ated prices to the 
importer, who pays the exporter in cleaned money, thus 
completing the laundry cycle.
A variety of businesses are used in laundering 
money. Th e amount of money laundered through these 
types of businesses and ﬁ nancial institutions across the 
country has been estimated at hundreds of billions of 
dollars and, despite eﬀ orts to curb such criminal prac-
tices, many expect money laundering to continue to 
increase with both domestic and international enforce-
ment challenges given the ever-expanding potential of 
the Internet.
As part of the Money Laundering Strategy Act of 
1998, High Intensity Financial Crimes Areas (HIFCA) 
were designated to help focus law enforcement eﬀ orts in 
those parts of the country where money laundering and 
related ﬁ nancial crimes were most prevalent. 
Investigating money laundering usually uses white-
collar-crime investigative techniques such as ﬁ nancial 
auditing and accounting, undercover operations (perhaps 
through sting operations) and electronic surveillance. 

446 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
pervasive, and its consequences are often hidden for years 
or even decades.
INTERPOL entered the ﬁ ght against environmental 
crime in 1992 when its general assembly adopted a resolu-
tion authorizing the creation of the Environmental Crimes 
Committee, with an initial participation of approximately 
40 countries from all regions of the world. INTERPOL 
states on its Web site:
Environmental crime is a serious and growing interna-
tional problem, with criminals violating national and 
international laws put in place to protect the environ-
ment. Th ese criminals are polluting the air, water and 
land. Th ey are pushing commercially valuable wildlife 
species closer to extinction and are signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ect-
ing the biological integrity of the planet.
 
Across the world, environmental crime takes on a 
number of forms which include: poaching, traﬃ  cking 
in ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), traﬃ  cking and 
use of illegal pesticides, illegal diversion of rivers, traf-
ﬁ cking in endangered species, and illegal dumping of 
hazardous waste onto land or in water. Environmental 
criminals, including those associated with organized 
crime, regularly cause permanent and extensive dam-
age to ecosystems, which may result in serious human 
health problems. Th e incentives to carry out environ-
mental crimes are ﬁ nancial, coupled with a perception, 
on the part of criminals, that they are unlikely to be 
caught and face severe penalties. Examples of envi-
ronmental crimes which have become more common 
and lucrative are the trade of collectible species and 
illegal disposal of waste in an eﬀ ort to avoid legitimate 
disposal costs, which results in an unfair competitive 
advantage for the criminals over legitimate, law-abiding 
businesses. (“Environmental Crime,” 2008)
Th e most common environmental crimes prosecuted 
in the United States involve illegal waste disposal or dump-
ing (Mertens, 2006, p.106). Hazardous wastes are the most 
frequently involved substances in such oﬀ enses. Other 
substances often involved include used tires and waste oil. 
Collecting and processing evidence in these cases often 
require special training and equipment. Many law enforce-
ment oﬃ  cers lack the scientiﬁ c background needed to put 
together an environmental pollution case or to deal safely 
with the illegal disposal of hazardous waste. Indeed, walk-
ing into a hazardous waste site without proper protective 
gear or skills for handling the material may be just as deadly 
as facing an armed robber in a dark alley.
Furthermore, most oﬃ  cers have little or no idea of the 
existence of the complex array of environmental control 
laws with all their exceptions, changes and omissions. For 
example, Congress and administrative agencies are con-
tinuously amending environmental laws and regulations 
and falsifying information put into computers—a highly 
sophisticated crime. (Computer-related crimes are dis-
cussed in Chapter 17.)
Bank embezzlements often start small and gradually 
increase. Surprisingly, many embezzlements are com-
mitted not for the embezzler’s beneﬁ t but as provi-
sion of unauthorized credit extensions to customers. As 
the amount increases, the employee is afraid to make 
the error known to the employer and attempts to cover 
the losses. In other cases, the employee uses funds to start 
other businesses, fully intending to replace the borrowed 
funds, but the businesses often fail. Other motives for 
embezzlement are to cover gambling debts, to support a 
drug habit, to make home improvements, to meet heavy 
medical expenses or to get even with the employer for real 
or imagined grievances.
Embezzlement losses may be discovered by accident, 
by careful audit, by inspection of records or property, by 
the embezzler’s abnormal behavior, by a sudden increase 
in the embezzler’s standard of living or by the embezzler’s 
disappearance from employment. Bank embezzlement is 
jointly investigated by the local police and the FBI. How-
ever, the prosecution rate is low because of adverse pub-
licity for both the individual and the company. Often the 
employee has been trusted for many years, and sympathy 
overrules justice.
Because police training rarely includes accounting 
courses, investigating embezzlement cases often requires 
help from professional accountants. In embezzlement 
cases, prove fraudulent intent to convert property con-
trary to the terms of a trust by establishing how and 
when the property was converted, what the exact amount 
was and who did the converting. Establish that a ﬁ nan-
cial loss did in fact occur. Determine the amount of the 
loss. Describe the property accurately if it is not money. 
Describe and prove the method of obtaining the property. 
Establish the nature of the trust. Seize all relevant books 
and ﬁ nancial records as evidence. It is necessary to deter-
mine the motive to prove fraudulent intent.
ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME
Our environment—air, land and water—has become a 
casualty in the battle among companies. Investigating 
environmental crime is a new area of specialization that 
mixes elements of law, public health and science. Envi-
ronmental crime is considered within the larger realm 
of white-collar crime because the motive behind these 
oﬀ enses is almost always an economic one. And con-
trary to what many believe, environmental crime is not 
victimless—the victims are our children and our chil-
dren’s children. Environmental crime is far-reaching and 

CHAPTER 14 | Larceny/Theft, Fraud and White-Collar Crime | 447
The main problems in investigating environmental crimes 
are understanding the numerous laws regarding what 
constitutes environmental crime, the fact that it is often 
considered a civil matter and collaborating with civil 
regulatory agencies.
Civil regulatory agencies are knowledgeable in these 
laws and have the resources to document evidence of 
a violation. For these reasons, in addition to the safety 
issues, many investigators ﬁ nd it beneﬁ cial to seek assis-
tance from an environmental regulatory agency. Collabo-
ration with specially equipped environmental labs, rather 
than crime labs, may also be necessary.
Some jurisdictions have designated specially trained 
law enforcement oﬃ  cers to investigate environmen-
tal crimes. Although many such oﬃ  cers are derisively 
being called “the garbage police,” some agencies’ sanita-
tion police are gaining respect and recognition for their 
eﬀ orts in keeping the city clean and free of environmen-
tal wrongdoings. Massachusetts is one of several states 
that have created an environmental crimes strike force, 
an interagency law enforcement initiative that com-
bines the technical, investigative and legal resources 
necessary to detect, investigate and prosecute environ-
mental crimes.
Environmental hazards once common in industry, in 
America and abroad, include lead, asbestos and chloroﬂ u-
orocarbons (CFCs)—all of which have become regulated 
under various environmental laws. For example, when 
Freon, a brand name the public generally equates with 
the broader class of CFCs, was shown to contribute to the 
global problem of ozone depletion, countries from around 
the world gathered to ﬁ nd a solution. Th rough an inter-
national agreement signed by more than 160 countries at 
the 1987 Montreal Convention, the United States agreed 
to completely phase out CFC production by the year 2000. 
However, as the FBI found, continued demand for CFCs 
and dwindling supplies created an enormous black mar-
ket, second only to the black market for narcotics. Th e FBI 
(“Criminal Fraud,” 2008) notes, “To date, cooperative law 
enforcement eﬀ orts have resulted in the seizure of 1.5 
million pounds of illegally imported CFCs with a ‘street’ 
value of $18 million.”
Many of the problems associated with investigating 
environmental crime are similar to investigating other 
crimes that have become more prevalent in the 21st cen-
tury. Deﬁ nitions of environmental crimes vary from state 
to state. Statistics are not uniformly compiled. Th e sus-
pects are often otherwise upstanding businesspeople who 
often do not feel they are committing crimes.
Premeditation or malice is not required to prove an 
environmental crime. All that must be proved is that an act 
to increase punishments for environmental criminal 
oﬀ enses, in many cases making them felonies rather than 
misdemeanors. Acts that have been amended to convert 
misdemeanor oﬀ enses into felonies include the
• • Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensa-
tion and Liability Act (CERCLA)
• • Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
• • Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA)
• • Clean Air Act (CAA)
In 1990, the Pollution Prosecution Act was enacted, 
making enforcement of environmental crimes a new con-
cern for law enforcement. Violations of various environ-
mental crime acts call for penalties of as much as $25,000 
per day for noncompliance or imprisonment for as long 
as 10 years.
Signs of Possible Environmental Violations Th e 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides some 
signs of possible environmental violations, including 
(“Signs of Environmental Violations,” 2008)
• • Containers or drums that appear to be abandoned, 
especially if they are corroded or leaking
• • Dead ﬁ sh in streams or waterways, especially if the 
water appears to contain foreign substances (such as 
detergent, bleach, or chemicals) or has a strange color
• • Dead animals alongside a riverbank or in a ﬁ eld
• • Discolored or stressed, dying plant life
• • Foul-smelling or oddly colored substance discharged 
onto the ground or into a stream or waterway
• • Visible sheens on the ground or in the water
• • Foul-smelling or strange-looking emissions into the air
• • Stains around drains, sinks, toilets or other wastewa-
ter outlets
Th e EPA also recommends that investigators be aware 
of “odd activities” such as a truck dumping materials into 
a manhole or sewer drain or unloading drums at odd 
hours or in odd places. Also suspicious is a person burying 
drums on business or residential property. If any of the 
preceding is observed, law enforcement oﬃ  cers should 
investigate.
Investigating Possible Environmental Crimes  Local 
law enforcement plays an important role in protecting the 
environment. Convictions and harsh penalties for crimes 
against the environment send a message to companies and 
individuals that local police actively monitor and enforce 
compliance with environmental laws (Johnson and Coy, 
2007, p.24).

448 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
violate local, state and federal laws. Investigators must be 
aware that even though a crime may fall under federal 
jurisdiction, such as a theft of federally insured monies, 
that fact alone does not dictate whether another agency 
will assume responsibility for the investigation. Other 
factors, including the monetary value of the loss, will 
play a role in determining who is assigned the case. Th e 
amounts of these thresholds vary with the crime. For 
example, the monetary threshold for jewelry theft or con 
games is $5,000, whereas the threshold for art theft is 
$2,000. Th e monetary threshold for the crime of traﬃ  ck-
ing counterfeit or unauthorized credit cards is $1,000 
over a one-year period. Some crimes have no monetary 
threshold that must be exceeded before the federal gov-
ernment gains jurisdiction. Th e FBI’s Web site (http://
www.fbi.gov/hq.htm) lists the FBI’s national security and 
criminal priorities, many of which were covered in this 
that violated the law was done knowingly rather than by 
mistake. For example, the owner of a company makes a con-
scious decision to dump hazardous materials into a water-
way or unload a truck full of construction and demolition 
(C & D) debris in a remote location oﬀ  a desolate road under 
cover of darkness. Evidence of “knowing” may include tire 
tracks in remote locations and documented “after hours” 
activities, for it may be concluded that such “detours” are 
made to illegally dump and are not accidental.
As in any other crime, there must be a victim. Oﬃ  cers 
should determine who owns the property. Most judges 
do not like to see State of X v. X unless the state actually 
owns the property. In addition, oﬃ  cers should conduct a 
standard administrative interview, obtaining such infor-
mation as name, date of birth, address and whatever 
information is routinely asked before giving the Miranda 
warning if an interrogation is to take place.
Of special concern in environmental crime investiga-
tions is the search warrant. Investigators must know what 
substances they may seek and how they should collect 
such samples to avoid becoming contaminated. Again, 
regulatory personnel may provide assistance.
Th rough criminal prosecution of environmental 
crimes, local prosecutors have a crucial function and can 
assume the role of protector of the public health. Often, 
such prosecution is most successful using parallel pro-
ceedings, that is, pursuing civil and criminal sanctions at 
the same time.
Trafficking in Wildlife and Organized Crime An 
often overlooked environmental crime is the international 
wildlife trade, estimated to be worth billions of dollars 
per year, including hundreds of millions of plant and ani-
mal specimens (Sellar, 2007, p.26). Investigating wildlife 
crime may result in apprehending organized crime rings: 
“Th ere is ample evidence to show a strong link between 
organized crime and wildlife crime” (Sellar). Th e following 
list of indicators may reveal the involvement of organized 
crime in illicit wildlife traﬃ  cking: detailed planning, sig-
niﬁ cant ﬁ nancial support, use or threat of violence, inter-
national management of shipments, sophisticated forgery 
and alteration of permits and certiﬁ cations, well-armed 
participants with the latest weapons and the opportunity 
for massive proﬁ ts (Sellar).

types of theft and fraud. Sometimes a single crime will

investigating money laundering involves (1) the inves-

terms, if there is no criminal activity, or “speciﬁ ed unlaw-
ful activity” that generates illicit proceeds, then there 
can be no money laundering), and (2) a parallel ﬁ nancial

Larceny
• • What are the name, address and phone number of the 
complainant or the person reporting the crime?
• • What are the name, address and phone number of the 
victim if diﬀ erent from the complainant?
• • Has the victim made previous theft complaints? If so, 
obtain all details.
• • What were the date and time the crime was reported 
and the date and time the crime was committed if 
known?
• • Who owns the property or has title to it or right of 
possession?
• • Will the owner or person in control or possession sign 
the complaint?
• • Who discovered the loss? Was this the logical person 
to discover it?
• • Where was the item at the time of the theft? Was this 
the usual place for the item, or had it been recently 
transferred there?
• • When was the item last seen?
• • Has the area been searched to determine whether the 
property might have been misplaced?
• • What security precautions had been taken? Were 
these normal?
• • Exactly what property was taken? Obtain a complete 
description of each item, including number, color, 
size, serial numbers and other identifying marks.
CHECKLIST
Larceny/theft is the unlawful taking, carrying, leading or 
driving away of property from another’s possession. Lar-
ceny is synonymous with theft. Both larceny and burglary 
are crimes against property, but larceny, unlike burglary, 
does not involve illegally entering a structure. Larceny 
also diﬀ ers from robbery in that no force or threat of force 
is involved.
 
Th e elements of the crime of larceny/theft are (1) the 
felonious stealing, taking, carrying, leading or driving away 
of (2) another’s personal goods or property (3) valued 
above or below a speciﬁ ed amount (4) with the intent to 
permanently deprive the owner of the property or goods. 
Th e two major categories of larceny/theft are grand lar-
ceny, a felony based on a value of stolen property usually 
more than $100, and petty larceny, a misdemeanor based 
on a value of stolen property usually less than $100. In 
most states, taking found property with the intent to 
keep or sell it is also a crime.
 
Among the common types of larceny are purse snatch-
ing, pocket picking, bicycle theft, theft from motor vehi-
cles, theft of motor vehicle accessories, mail theft, theft 
from coin machines, theft from buildings, shoplifting and 
jewelry theft.
 
When dealing with shoplifters, remember that alter-
ing the price of an item is considered larceny. It is not 
usually required that a shoplifter leave the premises with 
the stolen item before apprehension. When investigating 
jewelry theft, inform the FBI of the theft even if there is 
no immediate evidence of interstate operations. 
 
Fraud is intentional deception to cause a person to 
give up property or some lawful right. It diﬀ ers from theft 
in that fraud uses deceit rather than stealth to obtain 
goods illegally. Fraud is committed in many ways, includ-
ing conﬁ dence games, real estate fraud, insurance fraud, 
health care fraud, mass marketing fraud and fraud com-
mitted through counterfeiting or the use of checks or 
debit/credit cards. An increasingly serious and pervasive 
type of fraud is identity theft.
 
Elements of the crime of larceny by debit and credit 
card include (1) possessing such cards obtained by theft or
fraud (2) by which services or goods are obtained (3) through 
unauthorized signing of the cardholder’s name.
 
White-collar, or economic, crime includes (1) securi-
ties and commodities fraud; (2) insurance fraud; (3) health 
care and medical fraud; (4) telemarketing fraud; (5) credit 
card and check fraud; (6) consumer fraud, illegal com-
petition and deceptive practices; (7) bankruptcy fraud; 
(8) computer-related fraud; (9) bank fraud, embezzlement 
and pilferage; (10) bribes, kickbacks and payoﬀ s; (11) money 
laundering; (12) election law violations; (13) corruption of 
public oﬃ  cials; (14) copyright violations; (15) computer

MEDIA EXPLORATIONS
• • What was the value of the items? How was the value 
determined: estimated original price, replacement 
price or estimated market value?
• • How easily could the items be sold? Are there likely 
markets or buyers?
• • Were there any witnesses to the theft or people who 
might provide leads?
• • Who had access to the property before and during the 
time of the theft?
• • Who were absentee employees?
• • Who are possible suspects and why? What might be 
the motive?
A cash box was left on top of a desk at a university oﬃ  ce. 
Some students had registered early that day, so there was 
about $600 in the box. Th e box was closed but not locked. 
Th e oﬃ  ce manager went to lunch, leaving a college stu-
dent in charge. Th e student took a phone call in the dean’s 
oﬃ  ce, and the box was out of her sight for about 5 min-
utes. Later she heard a noise in the hallway outside the 
oﬃ  ce. She went out to see what had happened and discov-
ered that a student had been accidentally pushed through 
a glass door across the hallway from the main oﬃ  ce. She 
observed the scene in the hallway for about 5 minutes and 
then went back to the registration oﬃ  ce, where she did 
not notice anything out of order.
 
After a half hour, the oﬃ  ce manager returned from 
lunch and helped register two students at the front coun-
ter. When she went to the cash box to make change, she 
found that the $600 was missing. She immediately noti-
ﬁ ed the administrator’s oﬃ  ce, and a controller was sent 
over to the registration oﬃ  ce. Th e controller conducted 
a brief investigation and then notiﬁ ed the police. You are 
the investigator arriving at the registration oﬃ  ce.

Outline
t is not unusual for an American family to ﬁ nance or own more than $30,000 
in motor vehicles. Yet the motor vehicle, even though highly vulnerable, is the 
least protected of all property subject to theft. Th e vehicle, its accessories and the 
property inside are all targets for thieves.
 
Most people use motor vehicles to travel to work and for pleasure. Th ousands 
of recreational vehicles are also targets for theft and burglary. Aircraft and 
watercraft thefts add to the problems facing police investigators.

456 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
 
A car is stolen every 26.4 seconds in the United States 
according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) 
(“Hot Wheels,” 2007). Th e FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports 
estimates 1.2 million motor vehicles were stolen in 2006, at 
a theft rate of about 398.4 motor vehicles stolen for every 
100,000 inhabitants (Crime in the United States, 2006). 
Motor vehicle theft is on a downward trend, decreasing 
by 3.5 percent from 2005. According to preliminary data, 
auto theft in 2007 has declined for the fourth consecutive 
year, down 7.4 percent compared with 2006 and 11 per-
cent since 2000 (“National and Rocky Mountain Region,” 
2008). Th e estimated cost of motor vehicle theft in 2006 
was $7.9 billion, with the average value of a stolen vehicle 
placed at $6,649. Automobiles represented 73.5 percent 
of all motor vehicles stolen. Only 12.6 percent of thefts 
were cleared by arrest, with 30 percent of the vehicles 
never recovered. Table 15.1 lists the most commonly sto-
len vehicles in the United States.
Th e FBI also reports that an estimated 93.5 percent 
of the nation’s motor vehicle thefts occurred in metro-
politan statistical areas in 2006. According to the Rocky 
Mountain Insurance Information Association (“National 
and Rocky Mountain Region,” 2008), the top 10 hot spot 
states ranked by number of auto thefts are (1) Califor-
nia, (2) Texas, (3) Florida, (4) Arizona, (5) Michigan, (6) 
Washington, (7) Georgia, (8) Illinois, (9) Ohio and (10) 
New York. Th e RMIIA also ranked the top 10 metro areas 
with the highest auto theft rates in 2007: (1) Modesto, 
CA; (2) Las Vegas/Paradise, NV; (3) San Diego/Carlsbad/
San Marcos, CA; (4) Stockton, CA; (5) San Francisco/
Oakland/Fremont, CA; (6) Laredo, TX; (7) Albuquerque, 
NM; (8) Phoenix/Mesa/Scottsdale, AZ; (9) Yakima, WA; 
and (10) Tucson, AZ.
Researchers Walsh and Taylor (2007, p.64) studied 
motor vehicle theft (MVT) and community demographics 
and noted that MTV rates went up in communities more 
racially mixed and in those surrounded by initially higher 
MVT rates, suggesting extant community structure and 
surrounding crime generate higher MVT rates. Walsh and 
Taylor’s work also suggested the presence of young males 
is a contributing factor in MVT (p.80).
MOTOR VEHICLE 
IDENTIFICATION
Given the millions of motor vehicles operating 
on our roads, an identiﬁ cation system is 
imperative. Th e most important means of vehicle identiﬁ -
cation is the vehicle identiﬁ cation number (VIN).
The VIN is the primary nonduplicated, serialized number 
assigned by a manufacturer to each vehicle made. This 
number—critical in motor vehicle theft investigation—
identiﬁ es the speciﬁ c vehicle in question.
VINs for vehicles manufactured between 1958 and 
1970 may have 11 numbers and letters or fewer, whereas 
all automobiles manufactured in North America since 
1971 contain a series of 17 numbers and letters (Steck-
Flynn, 2008, p.92).
Th e Motor Vehicle Th eft Law Enforcement Act of 
1984 requires manufacturers to place the 17-digit VIN on 
14 speciﬁ ed component parts including the engine, the 
transmission, both front fenders, the hood, both front 
doors, both bumpers, both rear quarter panels, both rear 
doors and the deck, lid, tailgate or hatchback. In most late-
model cars, the VIN is located on the left instrumentation 
or dash plate by the window, on the driver’s door or post 
or on the ﬁ rewall.
A ﬁ ctional example of a VIN would be “1F1CY6-
2X1YK555888,” where

Th e VIN of a vehicle is the automotive equivalent of 
human DNA; no two VINs are identical. Th e VIN allows 
investigators to trace a vehicle from the factory to the 
scrap yard. Some manufacturers position the label in plain 
view; others hide it. Car thieves frequently attempt to 
change or replace VINs to conceal vehicles’ true identities. 
Decoding VINs can aid in investigating auto theft, cloning 
and chop shop operations, to be discussed shortly.
Manufacturers also use numbers to identify engines 
and various vehicle components.
CLASSIFICATION OF MOTOR 
VEHICLE THEFT
Motor vehicle thefts are often classiﬁ ed by the 
thief ’s motive or purpose, but it may be impos-
sible to determine the motive for thefts that end in the 
vehicle’s being abandoned.
Classiﬁ cations of motor vehicle theft based on the 
offenders’ motive include
• • Joyriding.
• • Transportation.
• • Commission of another crime.
• • Stripping for parts and accessories.
• • Reselling for proﬁ t.
JOYRIDING
Th e joyrider and the person stealing for transportation 
are sometimes grouped together, but there is an impor-
tant distinction between them. Th e joyrider is generally a 
younger person who steals for thrills and excitement.
Joyriders look for cars with keys in the ignition that 
can be started and driven away rapidly. Th e vehicle is taken 
for a comparatively short time and then abandoned near 
the location of the theft or near the joyrider’s destination. A 
vehicle taken to another community is generally left there, 
and another vehicle is then stolen for the return trip.
Stolen vehicles are often found where young people 
congregate: fast-food places, malls and athletic events. Sev-
eral vehicle thefts within a short time may follow a pattern, 
providing clues for investigators. For example, most cars 
stolen by the same individual or group in a short period are 
the same make, entered in the same manner and stolen and 
dropped oﬀ  in the same general area. Juvenile informants 
can be extremely helpful in investigating such auto thefts.
Motor vehicle thefts by juveniles are often not 
regarded seriously by the courts, even though they account 
for most vehicle thefts and can cause injury or death to 
others. It is not unusual for juveniles to be involved in as 
many as a hundred car thefts before apprehension.
Vehicle theft by juveniles is a serious problem, and in 
some states, joyriding is a separate oﬀ ense.
TRANSPORTATION
Th eft of a motor vehicle for transportation can involve a 
joyrider but is more apt to involve a transient, a hitchhiker

the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. 
This critical piece of evidence was used in the trial against 
the suspected terrorists—the number stamped in the metal is 
the vehicle identiﬁ cation number, which was instrumental in 
tracking down the suspects. This embassy and another in Nairobi, 
Kenya, were bombed almost simultaneously on August 7, 1998.

458 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
contributing to this high accident rate include operating 
the vehicle on unfamiliar streets and roads, driving at 
high speeds in an attempt to escape police pursuit, testing 
the vehicle’s speed, unfamiliarity with the vehicle and use 
of drugs.
A criminal apprehended with a stolen vehicle after 
committing another crime is usually prosecuted for only 
the major crime, not the auto theft.
STRIPPING FOR PARTS AND ACCESSORIES
Many vehicles are stolen by juveniles and young adults who 
strip them for parts and accessories to sell: transmissions, 
rear ends, motors and wheels. Batteries, radiators, and 
heaters are sold to wrecking yards, used car lots and auto 
repair shops. Expensive accessories such as car phones, 
stereo tape decks, radios, CB radios and CD players also are 
removed for resale. Th e stripped vehicle is often crushed 
for scrap metal. Th e proﬁ t is extremely high.
Sometimes thieves steal speciﬁ c items for friends, 
other vehicle owners or themselves. Th ese are often parts 
that are impossible to buy or are very expensive.
Airbag Theft Th e National Insurance Crime Bureau 
(“Airbag Th eft,” 2008) reports that airbags are a primary 
accessory on the black market for stolen vehicle parts. A 
new airbag retails for approximately $1,000. Unscrupu-
lous collision repair shops may replace a deployed airbag 
with a stolen one and charge the customer or the cus-
tomer’s insurer the full price (which constitutes insur-
ance fraud). Insurance statistics show that approximately 
50,000 airbags are stolen each year, resulting in an annual 
loss of more than $50 million to vehicle owners and their 
insurers (“Airbag Th eft,” 2008). 
Stealing for Chop Shops A chop shop is a business, 
usually a body shop, that disassembles stolen autos and 
sells the parts. Th e chop shop deals with car thieves who 
steal the cars speciﬁ cally for them, often on demand, steal-
ing the exact make, model and color. Th e vehicle may tri-
ple in value when sold for parts. Th ere is no waiting period 
and no tax to the customer. Th e cars are dismantled, and 
the parts are cataloged. In some cities, this business is so 
big that organized crime has been heavily involved and 
network organizations dispose of the stolen parts. Auto 
parts are also sought outside the United States.
Th e chop shop may also deal directly with the owner 
of a vehicle who wants to dispose of it for insurance pur-
poses because of dissatisfaction with its performance. Th e 
owner leaves the vehicle registration with the chop shop. 
Th e shop returns the registration to the owner after the 
vehicle is dismantled and crushed. Th e insurance com-
pany has no chance of recovery.
or a runaway. Th e objective is to travel from one point to 
another at no cost. Th ese oﬀ enders are generally older 
than joyriders. Late fall and winter are peak periods for 
this type of theft.
A vehicle stolen for transportation is kept longer than 
one stolen for joyriding. Frequently it is operated until it 
runs out of gas or stops running. It is then abandoned 
(often to avoid suspicion) and another vehicle is stolen. 
Th e license plates may be changed, or a plate may be sto-
len and put on the rear of the vehicle.
COMMISSION OF ANOTHER CRIME
Automobiles are used in most serious crimes. Robberies 
of banks, bank messengers, payroll oﬃ  ces, businesses and 
service stations, as well as criminal escapes, almost always 
involve a getaway in a stolen vehicle. Vehicles provide both 
rapid transportation and a means to transport the loot. 
Other crimes frequently committed while using stolen 
vehicles include rapes, kidnappings, burglaries, larcenies 
to obtain gas and assaults of police oﬃ  cers attempting to 
apprehend a suspect. Records indicate that many habitual 
criminals have stolen at least one car in their criminal 
careers. Some began as car thieves.
Stolen cars are used in committing other crimes to 
escape detection at the crime scene and to avoid being 
identiﬁ ed by witnesses. Th erefore, the criminal normally 
uses the stolen vehicle only brieﬂ y. In fact, a stolen vehicle 
report may not yet have been made when the crime is com-
mitted. Stolen plates are often used to cause confusion in 
identiﬁ cation. Th e vehicle used in committing the crime—
the “hot” car—is usually soon abandoned for a “cold” car—a 
vehicle used to escape from the crime scene vicinity.
Stolen vehicles played a major role in the search for 
serial killer Andrew Cunanan. Authorities were able to re-
create the route taken by Cunanan in his cross-country 
killing spree by locating one victim’s vehicle in the vicinity 
of the next victim’s body. Cunanan’s homicidal rampage 
began in late April 1997 in Minnesota with the killing of 
two men. Cunanan then stole the Jeep Grand Cherokee of 
one of the victims, and police later discovered this vehicle 
near the home of a third victim in Chicago. Th e Chicago 
victim’s Lexus was reported missing and was later found 
in New Jersey at the murder scene of Cunanan’s fourth 
victim. In continuing the pattern, the fourth victim’s 
pickup truck was stolen and later turned up in a Miami 
Beach parking ramp, several blocks from where fashion 
designer Gianni Versace was murdered in front of his 
home by Cunanan, who then killed himself.
A stolen motor vehicle driven by a criminal is 150 to 
200 times more likely to be in an accident than is a vehicle 
driven by a noncriminal; therefore, regard as suspicious 
any damaged abandoned vehicles you observe. Conditions

the change undetectable. If the VIN is not located on the 
dash, the car thief has a much more diﬃ  cult time. In some 
cases, the VIN plate itself is removed and carefully altered, 
or the car thief can make embossed tape with a handheld 
tape-numbering device and place it over the regular VIN 
plate. Unless the inside of the car is investigated, a false 
VIN plate is not usually detected.
After all number changes on the motor and the VIN 
plate are completed, the vehicle is prepared for resale 
with stolen or forged titles, ﬁ ctitious bills of sale or titles 
received with salvage vehicles bought by the thieves. 
When the mechanical alterations and paperwork are 
completed, the vehicle is registered through the Depart-
ment of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and resold, usually at 
a public car auction, to a used car dealer or a private 
individual.
Many stolen cars are exported for resale in other 
countries, the most common destinations being Central 
and South America. According to the NICB, 200,000 vehi-
cles are illegally exported each year. One international car 
theft ring was indicted by a federal grand jury for illegally 
obtaining vehicles from Reno, Nevada, car dealers and 
transporting them to the Port of Long Beach in California, 
where the cars were loaded onto freighters and shipped 
to China to be sold at three to four times their original 
price. Th e ring members then reported the cars stolen 
to police and insurance companies for reimbursement 
of their losses. Charges against ring members included 
RESELLING
Auto thefts are also committed by professional thieves 
who take an unattended vehicle, with or without the keys, 
and simply drive it away. Or they may go to a used car 
lot, posing as a buyer, and drive the vehicle away on a no-
return test drive. Another method is to answer an ad in the 
paper for a particular car, try it out and then never return 
it. Th is gives the thief time to escape because the owner 
gave permission to take the vehicle—which makes the 
case one of embezzlement. Cars are also stolen by using 
bad checks. Recovering a vehicle stolen by professionals 
requires a specialized knowledge of investigative tech-
niques and often depends on a reliable informant to get 
started. Moreover, such thieves are diﬃ  cult to detect and 
prosecute. As specialists in automobiles, the thieves know 
how to steal cars and how to alter them or the documents 
needed to make them eligible for resale. Th e professional 
is rarely the actual thief; rather, the professional hires 
others to steal cars and bring them to a speciﬁ ed location, 
usually a garage, for making the necessary alterations.
Alterations include repainting, changing seat covers, 
repairing existing damage and altering the engine number. 
Th e car is also completely searched to eliminate any items 
that connect it with the former owner. Th e VIN is almost 
always altered or replaced. Th e most common method of 
changing the VIN is to buy a similar vehicle from a salvage 
lot and then remove and replace the entire dash, making

dealership, or when it is owned by a private person, com-
pany or corporation. Owner and true owner are not nec-
essarily the same. For example, the true owner can be a 
lending agency that retains title until the loan is paid.
Usually the owner or the owner’s authorized agent 
reports the theft. Th us, it can be determined immediately 
whether consent was given. Previous consent is not a 
defense, although it may be considered.
If you stop a suspicious vehicle and the driver does 
not have proof of ownership, check the registration with 
the state DMV to determine who the legal owner is. If 
that person is not the driver, check with the legal owner 
to determine whether the driver has permission to use the 
vehicle.
MOTOR VEHICLE 
EMBEZZLEMENT
This most frequently occurs when a new or used-
car agency permits a prospective buyer to try 
out a vehicle for a speciﬁ c time. Th e person decides to con-
vert the vehicle to personal use and does not return it. 
Th is is fraudulent appropriation of property. Motor vehi-
cle embezzlement can also occur under rental or lease 
agreements or when private persons let someone test-
drive a vehicle that is for sale.
Motor vehicle embezzlement exists if the person who 
took the vehicle initially had consent and then exceeded 
the terms of that consent. 
INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION
In 1919, the need for federal control of motor vehicle 
theft was recognized, and Congress approved the National 
Motor Vehicle Th eft Act, commonly known as the
Dyer Act.
The Dyer Act made interstate transportation of a stolen 
motor vehicle a federal crime and allowed for federal 
help in prosecuting such cases.
Th e act was amended in 1945 to include aircraft and 
is now called the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor 
Vehicles Act. Since the Dyer Act was passed, more than 
300,000 vehicles have been recovered and more than 100,000 
criminals have been convicted in interstate car theft cases.
making false statements on loan and credit applica-
tions, mail fraud, interstate and foreign transportation 
of stolen property, aiding and abetting and attempting 
to evade ﬁ nancial reporting requirements. Th e FBI esti-
mated that the scheme involved total losses of as much as 
$6 million.
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME
UNAUTHORIZED USE OF A MOTOR VEHICLE
Most car thieves are prosecuted not for auto theft but 
for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Prosecution for 
auto theft requires proof that the thief intended to per-
manently deprive the owner of the vehicle, which is often 
diﬃ  cult or impossible to establish.
The elements of the crime of unauthorized use of a motor 
vehicle are
• • Intentionally taking or driving
• • a motor vehicle
• • without the consent of the owner or the owner’s 
authorized agent.
Intentionally Taking or Driving Intent is often described 
in state laws as “with intent to permanently or temporarily 
deprive the owner of title or possession” or “with intent to 
steal.” Intent can be inferred from the act of taking or driv-
ing, being observed taking or driving or being apprehended 
while taking or driving. Laws often include as culpable 
any person who voluntarily rides in a vehicle knowing it is 
stolen.
A Motor Vehicle Motor vehicle is not restricted to 
automobiles. It includes any self-propelled device for mov-
ing people or property or pulling implements, whether 
operated on land, on water or in the air.
Motor vehicles include automobiles, trucks, buses, 
motorcycles, motor scooters, mopeds, snowmobiles, 
vans, self-propelled watercraft and aircraft.
Homemade motor vehicles are also included.
Without the Consent of the Owner or the Owner’s 
Authorized Agent Legitimate ownership of motor 
vehicles exists when the vehicle is in the factory being 
manufactured, when it is being sold by an authorized 

CHAPTER 15 | Motor Vehicle Theft | 461
It is also possible that the vehicle has been re-claimed 
by a loan company—a civil matter.
A preliminary description is provided to patrol oﬃ  -
cers, who are told that the theft has not been veriﬁ ed; 
therefore, no all-points bulletin is issued. During this 
time, patrol oﬃ  cers are alerted, but they make no move 
if they see the stolen vehicle because the report has not 
been validated. Th e oﬃ  cer in the ﬁ eld obtains informa-
tion to determine the validity of the theft charge: the cir-
cumstances surrounding the alleged theft, identiﬁ cation 
of characteristics of the stolen vehicle, any details of items 
in the car and any possible suspects. Interviews with wit-
nesses are another crucial aspect of the preliminary inves-
tigation. Frequent false reports impair cooperation from 
other agencies, especially when the errors should have 
been detected by the investigating oﬃ  cers.
Recovered vehicles must be examined for usable 
latent prints and other physical evidence. If a vehicle is 
found with accident damage, it is necessary to determine 
whether the damage occurred before or after the report. 
Vehicles involved in a hit-and-run incident are some-
times abandoned by the driver and then reported as sto-
len. Younger people sometimes report a car stolen if they 
crash and are afraid to tell their parents.
Computerized police ﬁ les can assist in searching for 
suspects. Investigators can enter data concerning past 
suspects and other individuals in vehicles, types of vehi-
cles stolen, the manner in which vehicles were entered 
or stolen, the types of locations from which they were 
stolen (apartment complexes, private residences or com-
mercial parking lots, for example), where vehicles were 
abandoned and where vehicles were if the suspects were 
arrested in them.
COMMON TOOLS AND METHODS
Investigators must be familiar with the tools and meth-
ods commonly used to commit vehicle theft, including car 
openers, rake and pick guns, tryout keys, impact tools, 
keyway decoders, modiﬁ ed vise grips, tubular pick locks, 
modiﬁ ed screwdrivers and hot wiring. Be familiar with 
these items and techniques and know what evidence to 
collect to prove their use.
INSURANCE FRAUD
Vehicle insurance fraud is a major economic 
crime that aﬀ ects every premium payer 
through increased insurance rates. According to the NICB, 
insurance criminals cost $30 billion annually.
Th e elements of the crime of interstate transporta-
tion of a motor vehicle are
• • Th e motor vehicle was stolen.
• • It was transported in interstate or foreign commerce.
• • Th e person transporting or causing it to be trans-
ported knew it was stolen.
• • Th e person receiving, concealing, selling or bartering it 
knew it was stolen.
Th e vehicle thief may be prosecuted in any state 
through which the stolen vehicle passed. Prosecution 
is normally in the state in which the vehicle was stolen, 
but sometimes it is in the state in which the person was 
arrested.
Intent is not required. Th e stolen vehicle could acci-
dentally be driven over the state line or forced to detour 
into another state. If the vehicle is transported by train or 
truck through another state, prosecution is also possible.
Th e Anti-Car Th eft Act of 1992 provides tougher leg-
islation against auto theft, previously a low-proﬁ le crime. 
Th e penalty for importing or exporting stolen vehicles was 
increased from 5 to 10 years, as was the penalty for inter-
state transportation of stolen vehicles. Th e act empowers 
U.S. Customs with new authority in checking for stolen 
vehicles and provides funds to states that participate in 
the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System. It 
also made armed carjacking a federal oﬀ ense.
THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
When a motor vehicle theft is reported, initial 
information obtained by police includes the 
time, date and location of the theft; the make, model and 
color of the vehicle; the state of issue of the license plate; 
license plate number; direction of travel; description of 
any suspect; and the complainant’s present location.
Th e complainant is asked to remain at his or her pres-
ent location, and a police oﬃ  cer is dispatched to obtain 
further information and to complete the proper com-
plaint form.
False motor vehicle theft reports are often ﬁ led when a 
car has been taken by a family member or misplaced in a 
parking lot, when the driver wants to cover up for an ac-
cident or crime committed with the vehicle, or when the 
driver wants to provide an alibi for being late for some 
commitment.

462 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
among the models most widely reported by local detec-
tives (“Vehicle Identiﬁ cation Cloning,” 2008). Table 15.2 
lists the most popular cloned vehicles uncovered during 
recent NICB investigations.
Th e NICB notes, “Vehicle cloning is a relatively easy 
crime to commit, especially by organized rings of profes-
sional vehicle thieves and fraud artists enticed by its allure 
of huge proﬁ ts” (Doing a Double-Take, 2004, p.2). According 
to this source, conservative vehicle cloning proﬁ ts in the 
United States are estimated to exceed $12 million annually, 
with an average net of $30,000 per cloned vehicle (p.2).
Compounding the cloning problem is the fact that 
many cloned vehicles are used for illegal operations: “Law 
enforcement agencies across the country have been warned 
to be alert for vehicles that have been made to look like 
commercial or law enforcement vehicles, but in actuality 
are ‘clones’ being used for illegal activities” (Lopez, 2008). 
Ross (2008) reports, “Savvy criminals are using some of the 
country’s most credible logos, including FedEx, Wal-Mart, 
Direct TV and the U.S. Border Patrol to create fake trucks 
for smuggling drugs, money, and illegal aliens.” He gives as 
examples a routine traﬃ  c stop by the Texas Department 
of Public Safety of a Wal-Mart truck, driven by a man in a 
Wal-Mart uniform, which was found to be carrying 3,058 
pounds of marijuana and 204 kilograms of cocaine in a 
fake truck trailer. A U.S. Border Patrol van was found to be 
carrying 31 illegal aliens in Casa Grande, Arizona.
COOPERATING AGENCIES IN 
MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT
Police most frequently use state DMVs to check 
owners’ registrations. Th ey also use them to 
compare the driver of a vehicle with the registered owner. 
When vehicle registration and driver’s registration checks 
are completed, further checks can be made in the FBI’s 
National Crime Information Center (NCIC) ﬁ les to

Many police departments facilitate insurance fraud 
by allowing car theft reports to be phoned in or by tak-
ing them “over the counter” at the police station and then 
never investigating the reports. Th e primary reason the 
auto theft is reported is often for insurance purposes. 
To avoid this situation law enforcement agencies should 
investigate all auto theft reports and should not discount 
the possibility that the “victim” is actually committing 
insurance fraud.
For example, a luxury car stolen from a suburban 
mall parking lot was found 4 days later on ﬁ re on a rural 
road. Th e case seemed routine until a detective began an 
investigation to eliminate the car’s reported owner. Th e 
detective found that there were three pending lawsuits 
against the “victim,” who had ﬁ led for bankruptcy shortly 
after the lawsuits and months before the car was stolen. 
He had ﬁ led an aﬃ  davit claiming he no longer owned the 
car because he had sold it six months before. Investiga-
tion revealed that the buyer was a friend who let the car 
be transferred into his name so it would not be involved 
in the bankruptcy proceedings.
Th is was a clear case of ﬁ ling false information with 
the police. Further, after a ﬁ re investigator and a mechanic 
inspected the car, they reported that the lab tests showed 
ongoing engine failure. Th e victim wanted the insurance 
company to pay for a replacement vehicle—an obvious 
case of fraud. 
VEHICLE CLONING
Th e NICB describes vehicle cloning as a crime in which sto-
len vehicles assume the identity of legally owned, or “non-
stolen,” vehicles of a similar make and model. Criminals 
apply counterfeit labels, plates, stickers and titles to these 
stolen cars, making them appear legitimate. Th e nonsto-
len vehicles can be actively registered or titled in another 
state or country, resulting in multiple vehicles having the 
same VIN being simultaneously registered or titled—but, 
of course, only the nonstolen vehicles are legitimate. Th e 
rest are fakes, or clones.
Th e ﬁ rst step in the cloning process is to copy a 
VIN from a legally owned car. Th en the criminal steals a 
vehicle similar to the one from which the VIN had been 
lifted. Th e stolen vehicle’s legitimate VIN is replaced 
with a counterfeit one, making the stolen vehicle a clone 
of the legally owned original vehicle. Th e criminal then 
creates counterfeit ownership documents and sells the 
stolen vehicle to an innocent buyer (“It’s Not a Feat,” 
2008). 
High-end luxury cars are the usual targets of cloning. 
Cadillac Escalades, Lexus RX 300s, and BMW 5 Series are 

CHAPTER 15 | Motor Vehicle Theft | 463
RECOGNIZING A STOLEN 
MOTOR VEHICLE OR AN 
UNAUTHORIZED DRIVER
“Alert patrol oﬃ  cers can help recover stolen vehicles 
and take dirtbag thieves oﬀ  the streets” (Scoville, 
2007, p.26). As with other crimes, a suspicious nature and an 
alert mind help an oﬃ  cer detect motor vehicle thefts. Detec-
tion is sometimes improved by an instinct developed through 
training, observation and experience. Police oﬃ  cers develop 
individual techniques for recognizing stolen cars. No absolute, 
single peculiarity identiﬁ es a stolen car or its driver, but either 
one can draw the attention of an observant oﬃ  cer. 
To improve your ability to recognize stolen vehicles,
• • Keep a list of stolen vehicles, or a “hot sheet,” in 
your car.
• • Develop a checking system to rapidly determine 
whether a suspicious vehicle is stolen.
• • Learn the common characteristics of stolen vehicles 
and car thieves.
• • Take time to check suspicious persons and vehicles.
• • Learn how to question suspicious drivers and 
occupants.
A potential car thief on foot usually appears nervous. 
He or she may be looking into cars on the street or in park-
ing lots, trying door handles and carrying some sort of 
entry tool. Observe such an individual from a distance 
until an overt act is committed.
Characteristics of a driver of a stolen vehicle include making 
sudden jerks or stops, driving without lights or excessively 
fast or slow, wearing gloves in hot weather and attempting 
to avoid or outrun a squad car. Any unusual or inappropri-
ate driving behavior may be suspicious. In addition, “Car 
theft has become a gateway crime, the point where juvenile 
delinquents graduate from Hot Wheels to hot cars. Juve-
niles account for some 16 percent of stolen vehicles, so it 
makes sense to take a second glance at stature and youthful 
appearances of drivers” (Scoville, 2007, p.27).
Characteristics of a stolen vehicle include having one 
license plate when two are required, or two when one is 
required. Double or triple plates with one on top of the 
other can indicate lack of time to take oﬀ  the original 
plates. A set of old plates with new screws, wired-on plates, 
altered numbers, dirty plates on a clean car or clean plates 
on a dirty car, diﬀ ering front and rear plate numbers, 
determine whether the vehicle is stolen and whether the 
driver has a criminal record.
The FBI and the NICB provide valuable help in 
investigating motor vehicle thefts.
THE FBI
Th e FBI assists local and state authorities who notify the 
bureau that a stolen motor vehicle or aircraft has been 
transported interstate—which places it within the pro-
visions of the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor 
Vehicles Act. Th e FBI works with local authorities to ﬁ nd the 
vehicle and the person who stole it. Th e FBI can also exam-
ine suspicious documents relating to false sales or registra-
tions. Th e Bureau’s NCIC contains information on stolen 
vehicles and stolen auto accessories. Its National Automo-
bile Altered Numbers File is an additional resource.
THE NATIONAL INSURANCE CRIME BUREAU
In 1992, the National Auto Th eft Bureau was incorporated 
into the NICB, a nonproﬁ t organization supported and 
maintained by hundreds of automobile insurance com-
panies. Th e organization helps law enforcement agencies 
reduce and prevent auto thefts and investigate question-
able or fraudulent vehicle ﬁ res and thefts.
Th e NICB also disseminates reports on stolen vehicles 
to law enforcement agencies and serves as a clearing-
house for information on stolen vehicles. Computer ﬁ les 
are maintained for several million wanted or stolen cars, 
listed by make, engine number, VIN and component part 
number. Th is information is available free upon request 
to law enforcement agencies. Th e bureau can also trace 
cars from the factory to the owner. Its staﬀ  of specialists 
and technicians are experts in identifying stolen cars and 
restoring mutilated, changed or defaced numbers. Th ey 
also restore altered or obliterated VINs.
Th e NICB publishes and distributes to police agencies 
its Manual for the Identiﬁ cation of Automobiles. Th is publi-
cation describes the location of identifying numbers, gives 
license plate reproductions and provides a short legal 
digest of each state’s motor vehicle laws. In an emergency, 
call the bureau collect. Otherwise, send a letter requesting 
speciﬁ c assistance.
Also of assistance is the National Vehicle Identiﬁ ca-
tion Program (NVIP). Th is program promotes use of vehi-
cle identiﬁ cation technology and provides a $1,000 reward 
for information leading to recovery of an NVIP-registered 
vehicle and the arrest and conviction of the auto thief.

464 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
RECOVERING AN ABANDONED 
OR STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE
Most motor vehicle thefts are local problems 
involving a locally stolen and recovered vehi-
cle. Th e majority of stolen vehicles are recovered, most of 
them within 48 hours, especially those stolen by juveniles. 
Stolen vehicles are recovered when patrol oﬃ  cers observe 
a vehicle on a hot sheet, a suspicious vehicle or driver or 
an apparently abandoned vehicle or when private citizens 
report an abandoned vehicle.
Although patrol units are responsible for most of the 
stolen vehicles recovered, investigative personnel play a 
major role in furnishing information to the uniformed 
patrol in all areas of motor vehicle theft.
Th e initial patrol oﬃ  cer at the scene examines recov-
ered and abandoned vehicles unless there is reason to 
believe the vehicle was involved in a serious crime. Inves-
tigators assigned to such a crime may want to look for 
speciﬁ c items in the vehicle that might not be known to 
the patrol oﬃ  cers. In these cases, the vehicle is protected 
until the specialists arrive.
Once recovery and impound reports have been com-
pleted, the car is removed from the hot sheet and the 
owner is notiﬁ ed of the recovery. A vehicle recovery report 
should be completed and ﬁ led.
If a crime has recently been committed in the area 
or if the vehicle’s position and location suggest that the 
suspect may return, drive by and arrange for a stakeout. 
If the car is locked and the keys are gone, if heavy rain or 
fog exists and the windshield-wiper marks indicate they 
were recently used or if no dry spot appears under the 
car, the vehicle was probably used recently and the driver 
may return. Round rain spots on the vehicle mean that 
it has been parked for a longer period than if there are 
elongated raindrops, which indicate recent movement. 
A quick check of heat remaining on the hood, radiator or 
exhaust pipe also indicates whether the car was recently 
parked. Consider attempting to apprehend the criminal 
on return to the vehicle.
However, if a car has a ﬂ at tire or is up on blocks, 
it is probably abandoned and can be immediately pro-
cessed at the scene, the police station or a storage loca-
tion. Consider the possibility that the vehicle was used 
in committing another crime such as robbery, burglary, 
murder, hijacking or abduction or kidnapping. Search the 
vehicle’s exterior ﬁ rst and then the interior as described 
in Chapter 4. Many car thieves have been located through 
items left in a vehicle.
plates bent to conceal a number, upside-down or hanging 
plates and homemade cardboard plates are all suspicious. 
Observe whether the trunk lid has been pried or whether 
side windows or door locks are broken. Look for evidence 
of a broken steering column or of tampering with the igni-
tion switch. Abandoned vehicles are also suspicious.
When questioning drivers and any occupants of cars you 
have stopped on suspicion of motor vehicle theft, observe 
their behavior. Watch for signs of nervousness, hesitancy 
in answers, overpoliteness and indications that the driver 
does not know the vehicle. Request the driver’s license 
and the vehicle registration papers for identiﬁ cation. 
Examine the driver’s license and ask for the driver’s birth 
date. Th e driver will probably not know the correct date 
unless it is his or her license. Compare the description on 
the license with the person. Compare the state of issuance 
of the license with the car’s license plates. Ask the driver 
to sign his or her name and compare the signature with 
that on the driver’s license.
Ask the driver the year, make and model of the car and 
compare the answers with the registration papers. Ask the 
mileage. Th e driver of a stolen car rarely knows the mile-
age, whereas the owner or regular driver knows within a 
reasonable number of miles. Ask the driver to describe the 
contents of the car’s trunk and glove compartment.
Check inside the vehicle for an extra set of license 
plates, bullet holes or other damage, bloodstains and ser-
vice stickers showing where and when the car was last 
serviced. Inspect the VIN plate for alterations. A roll of 
adhesive tape can indicate it was used to tape windows 
before breaking them. Wire or coat hangers bent straight 
to open doors, rubber gloves, jumper cables or tools for 
breaking into a car are also alerting signals.
Parked cars may have been stolen if debris under the 
car indicates it has been in the same place for a long time. 
Check with neighbors to determine how long the vehicle 
has been parked there. Th e neighborhood canvass is one of 
the most eﬀ ective techniques in investigating abandoned 
cars. Check for illegal entrance, for open car windows in 
inclement weather and for dirty vehicles indicating lack 
of care. A citation under the wiper can indicate when the 
car was abandoned. Keys left in the ignition and lack of 
license plates are also grounds for checking.
A warm or running motor and ﬁ rearms or valuables 
left in the car may indicate that the thief has temporar-
ily parked the car and intends to return. Stake out sto-
len vehicles (identiﬁ ed by license number or description) 
because the thief may return. Consider partially immobi-
lizing the vehicle to prevent an attempted escape.
Scoville (2007, p.28) oﬀ ers one last consideration: “Fri-
days and Saturdays are hands down the busiest car theft 
days, giving ‘weekend getaway’ a whole new meaning.”

CHAPTER 15 | Motor Vehicle Theft | 465
To combat auto theft in Atlanta, the Auto Th eft Task 
Force (ATTF) was initiated to target high-risk areas at 
high-risk times. Th e approach involved high-visibility uni-
formed patrol, members’ making frequent traﬃ  c stops 
and heavy reliance on ﬁ eld investigative interviews. Th e 
eﬀ orts of the task force paid oﬀ , with the seven ATTF oﬃ  -
cers making 2,500 arrests in the ﬁ rst year and recovering 
more than 400 vehicles.
To combat the rising auto theft rate at Newark Inter-
national Airport in New Jersey, airport police took several 
steps, including
• • Increasing the candlepower of parking lot lights
• • Conducting weekly inspections of the lot perimeter to 
locate access points for thieves (e.g., broken or cut fences)
• • Oﬀ ering monetary rewards to the public for informa-
tion leading to the arrest of car thieves
• • Securing unused remote entrances
• • Touring the lots with marked and unmarked patrol cars
In areas where police have made special eﬀ orts to edu-
cate the public and to assign extra squads to patrol high-
auto-theft areas, auto theft has signiﬁ cantly decreased.
New York City has instituted the Combat Auto Th eft 
(CAT) program, which has been highly successful. Partici-
pating car owners sign a form indicating that they do not 
normally operate their automobiles between 1 A.M. and 
5 A.M., the peak auto-theft hours. Th ey also sign a consent 
form that authorizes the police to stop their vehicle dur-
ing these hours without probable cause. Owners are given 
a CAT program decal to aﬃ  x prominently on the inside of 
the car’s rear window. Oﬃ  cers may stop any car having 
the decal, without probable cause, if they see it traveling 
on city streets between 1 A.M. and 5 A.M.
Minnesota’s Help Eliminate Auto Th eft (HEAT) pro-
gram oﬀ ers as much as $5,000 for information leading to 
the arrest and trial of suspected auto-theft-ring members 
or chop shop operators. Th e program’s toll-free number is 
answered by the Minnesota Highway Patrol.
Th e increased use of alarms and protective devices 
may partly account for the rise in armed carjackings, as 
explained in Chapter 12. Unwilling to give up their lucra-
tive “trade,” car thieves may use force against a vehicle 
operator to gain control of the vehicle rather than risk 
being thwarted by antitheft devices. Whereas carjacking 
is treated as quite a severe crime, regular unarmed auto 
theft remains a relatively minor oﬀ ense and, from a crimi-
nal perspective, a safe crime to commit.
LICENSE PLATES
As Mills-Senn (2006, p.16) notes, “License plates are a real 
Achilles Heel for bad guys. Unless criminals want to hoof 
or bike it to their various crimes, constantly switch plates 
If you suspect the vehicle was used in another crime, 
take it to a garage or lock and seal it with evidence tape; 
then notify the proper authorities. After processing, 
notify the rightful owner.
Technology is facilitating the recovery of stolen vehi-
cles. LoJack, a Massachusetts company, has developed a 
system that places a homing device in an obscure place 
on a vehicle. If the vehicle is reported stolen, the device is 
activated and a tracker picks up a signal that is displayed 
on a lighted compass. An illuminated strength meter tells 
operators when they are nearing the stolen vehicle. Th e 
display also shows the model and color of the car. Th e 
LoJack Web site reports that the radio frequency–based 
system is used in 20 countries by 2.4 million customers. It 
has helped recover 50,000 vehicles worth nearly $1 billion 
and has a consistently high 90 percent recovery rate.
Th e system is not without its drawbacks, however. 
First, unless police departments across the country install 
tracking devices in their squad cars, the devices are inef-
fective. Second, the lag time between a car theft and its 
report may be hours or even days. Th ird, there are some 
dead spots—locations where transmitted radio signals 
will not be detected. Fourth, some departments hesitate 
to become a partner with a private company. Finally, some 
departments worry that the public will perceive them to 
be focused on preventing car theft from the more aﬄ  u-
ent members of the community, those who can aﬀ ord the 
$600 auto recovery system.
Other systems also are available, some of which activate 
automatically. If someone drives oﬀ  in the car without deac-
tivating the system, an alarm is sent to the tracking center. 
Such systems might, however, result in false alarms and 
pose as great a problem as false burglar alarms. Other sys-
tems provide a personal alert service that allows motorists to 
signal authorities in case of emergencies. One system allows 
controllers to shut oﬀ  a stolen car’s engine by remote control 
if police tracking the car believe it would be safe to do so.
COMBATING MOTOR 
VEHICLE THEFT
Police departments are using several strategies 
to combat rising auto theft levels:
• • Setting up sting operations—for example, a body shop 
that buys stolen vehicles
• • Providing oﬃ  cers with auto theft training
• • Coordinating eﬀ orts across jurisdictional lines
• • Instituting anti–car theft campaigns
• • Increasing penalties for stealing vehicles

466 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
Bait Cars Th e basic idea of a bait car is simple. A model 
of vehicle with a high theft rate is selected and placed in a 
high crime area. Oﬃ  cers then simply sit back and wait for 
the vehicle to be stolen: “Aside from being a high-tech way 
to nab thieves, bait cars provide a rare look at the initial 
moments of a common crime. Most of the time, it’s not 
that exciting, oﬃ  cers said, because most interceptions 
take place within about two minutes and most arrests 
within four” (Stockwell, 2006, p.A01). 
Th e Los Angeles Sheriﬀ ’s Department’s Taskforce for 
Regional Autotheft Prevention (TRAP) uses a traditional, 
watch-and-wait method of bait vehicles. In Modesto, Cali-
fornia, the nation’s “car-theft capital,” bait cars are used 
extensively. However, a car thief can be gone in 60 seconds, 
in jail within 20 minutes but back on the street in 4 months 
(Robinson, 2006, p.141). In California, car theft is classiﬁ ed 
as a nonviolent felony, typically earning the perpetrator 
just 120 to 150 days in jail, and it isn’t subject to California’s 
three-strikes rule (p.142). Most of the oﬀ enders arrested 
have prior histories and consider jail time to be like going 
away to school to catch up on the latest techniques from 
colleagues. 
Bait cars can be enhanced using telematic technol-
ogy, which transfers data between a remote vehicle and a 
host computer. Th e data are transferred using the Inter-
net and wireless technology as well as a global positioning 
system (GPS). A small radio transceiver called a vehicle 
locator unit (VLU) is hidden in the bait vehicle. Th e VLU 
transmits a silent homing signal, revealing the vehicle’s 
location to an oﬃ  cer’s remote control unit (RCU), a hand-
held two-way radio equipped with a keypad from which 
commands are entered, activating the tracking transmit-
ter and controlling the bait vehicle’s engine, door locks, 
ﬂ ashers and horn. Th e car is tracked by satellite and 
located. Mapping software can display the location, direc-
tion and speed of the vehicle. When an oﬃ  cer catches up 
with the thief, he or she can remotely kill the stolen car’s 
engine and lock the car’s door.
BORDER AREA AUTO THEFT
According to the NICB, many of the top metropolitan 
areas for vehicle theft are in or near ports or the Mexi-
can or Canadian borders. In fact, there is no international 
border for this highly mobile crime. Particularly hard hit 
by auto theft are California, Nevada, Texas, New Mexico, 
Arizona and Washington, which the NICB ranks as the 
leading car theft states in the nation. 
Th e Arizona law enforcement community has created 
programs to encourage binational cooperation. At the cen-
ter of this eﬀ ort is Policia Internacional Sonora y Arizona 
(PISA), a cross-border networking group that began 
20 years ago when a few Arizona and Sonora (Mexico) oﬃ  -
cers gathered informally over breakfast. Th e group now 
has hundreds of members throughout the border region. 
or remove them altogether (an obvious giant red ﬂ ag), the 
lowly license plate can be their undoing, leading to their 
identiﬁ cation and capture. For example, the DC sniper 
was caught by an alert truck driver who recognized the 
shooter’s plate after it was broadcast.” 
Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) is being 
used in patrol cars across the country, with one of leaders 
in ALPR being PlateScan (Molnar, 2007, p.20).
ROUTINE ACTIVITIES AND MOTOR 
VEHICLE THEFT
Th e routine-activity approach to crime suggests that 
the daily, routine activities of populations inﬂ uence the 
availability of targets of crime. Th e existence of poten-
tial oﬀ enders, suitable targets and lack of guardianship 
explains variation in the rate of motor vehicle theft. 
Research indicates that city blocks with bars have almost 
twice as many auto thefts as do city blocks without bars 
and that blocks adjacent to high schools have higher levels 
of auto theft than do blocks that are not near high schools. 
In addition, parking lots with attendants have lower rates 
of auto theft than similar lots with no attendants on duty. 
Such ﬁ ndings might be used in designing auto theft pre-
vention programs such as using bait cars.
Technology Innovations
PlateScan is unique in that it uses technology 
known as neural networks, which basically means it 
uses sophisticated algorithms to identify character-
istics on plates. As the system reads a license plate, 
it compares the plate to the database. If it makes a 
hit, it alerts the operator. If not, it stores the plate 
information in the computer, as well as the time and 
location of the read via GPS integration. According to 
PlateScan, testing of its systems indicated an accu-
racy rate of approximately 95.8 percent.
Interestingly, PlateScan can also generate hits 
off of partial plates. . . . Using the system, 170,000 
stored plates were analyzed in approximately ﬁ ve 
minutes time, with an analysis of possible plate 
matches based on characters, time stamps, and GPS. 
The result? Six images in full color of a vehicle sus-
pected in or involvement in [a series of rapes]. . . . The 
addition of a separate color camera allows the cap-
ture of vehicle description, make, model, color, dam-
age, unique characteristics, etc. to the database. In 
other words, you get a complete picture of the vehi-
cle, not just the plate. The PlateScan system can read 
and process four cameras simultaneously, which 
allows for multi-directional, real-time analysis.

CHAPTER 15 | Motor Vehicle Theft | 467
with the motor running is also extremely inviting. Many 
juveniles take cars under such conditions and then boast 
of their ability to steal.
Numerous motor vehicle thefts can be prevented by 
effective educational campaigns and by installing 
antitheft devices in vehicles during manufacture.
Educate motor vehicle owners about the importance 
of removing their keys from the ignition and locking their 
vehicles when parked. Public education campaigns might 
include distributing dashboard stickers with the reminder 
“Have you removed your keys from the ignition?” or 
“Don’t forget to take your keys and lock your car.”
To deter theft, some automakers have developed igni-
tion systems and keys that use microchips with electronic 
codes embedded in them. However, car thieves have been 
able to duplicate these antitheft keys by using code grab-
bers similar to the devices used to duplicate codes that 
open garage doors. In response, as with garage door mak-
ers, some auto manufacturers are now using rolling codes 
and encrypted systems that use randomly generated codes 
to defeat thieves. Th ey have also developed a buzzer system 
that warns the driver that the keys are still in the vehicle. 
Keyless entry and ignition systems are additional technolo-
gies designed to make it harder for thieves to break into 
vehicles to steal them. Immobilizer systems, in which the 
engine recognizes only the preprogrammed key(s) assigned 
to the car, are a further safety device to prevent auto theft.
Th e NICB Web site suggests a four-layered approach 
to combat auto theft: 
 1. Common sense. Remove keys, close windows and lock 
doors. Park in well-lit areas.
 2. Visible and audible warning devices. Use steering wheel 
locks, wheel locks, theft deterrent decals, identiﬁ ca-
tion markers such as the VIN etched in the window 
and audible alarms.
 3. Immobilizing devices. Use cut-oﬀ  switches, kill switches, 
smart keys and fuel disablers.
 4. Tracing devices. Give police the vehicle location.
THEFTS OF TRUCKS, 
CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES, 
AIRCRAFT AND OTHER 
MOTORIZED VEHICLES
Investigating thefts of trucks and trailers, con-
struction vehicles and equipment, recreational 
vehicles, motorized boats, snowmobiles, motorcycles, 
Relationships established at these conferences create per-
sonal connections that could not be made any other way.
In 2003, Arizona established a Border Auto Th eft Infor-
mation Center (BATIC), a toll-free, long-distance telephone 
line that Sonoran police can use to seek and share informa-
tion about vehicles recovered in or stolen from Mexico. Th e 
program averages about 50 calls a day from Mexican law
enforcement oﬃ  cers. Just as border area auto theft pre-
sents unique challenges, so does the theft of police vehicles.
THEFT OF PATROL CARS
Police vehicles are also vulnerable to thieves: “Stolen police 
vehicles present a serious liability and ﬁ nancial burden for 
agencies and communities, and thefts occur more often 
than most law police administrators realize” (Post, 2006, 
p.19). About the only police vehicle that appears to be 
immune from theft is a K-9 vehicle. A stolen unit driven by 
a ﬂ eeing felon might run down civilians, practically guar-
anteeing that the department will be sued. In addition, 
police cars grant the drivers access to high-security areas, 
so terrorists would jump at the chance to obtain one.
Most reports of stolen police vehicles involve sus-
pects who get into a unit an oﬃ  cer has left unattended, 
usually to take a report or chase a suspect. In fact, many 
oﬃ  cers need to keep their vehicles running almost non-
stop through a shift. Turning the engine oﬀ  drains the 
car’s battery quickly because of the power demands of 
emergency lights, communications systems, laptops and 
other devices. Turning oﬀ  the engine also powers down 
those instruments, requiring inconvenient rebooting.
Technology oﬀ ers some answers here. One solution 
is a brake-light kill switch. With the brake lights cut oﬀ , 
the car will not come out of park even when running. Th is 
solution works only with later-model vehicles that require 
the driver to step on the brake before the transmission 
can shift out of park.
Another solution is a secure-idle system in which an oﬃ  -
cer presses a button, places the transmission in park, turns 
the key to the normal oﬀ  position and removes the key. Th e 
engine keeps running and all accessories remain on. However, 
any unauthorized attempt to step on the brake or move the 
shift lever out of park cuts all electrical power. It can also trig-
ger an optional alarm. Th e system is deactivated by putting the 
key back into the ignition and turning it to the on position.
PREVENTING AUTO THEFT
Eﬀ ective preventive measures could eliminate 
many motor vehicle thefts. Vehicle theft 
requires both desire and opportunity, and it is often diﬃ  -
cult to know which comes ﬁ rst. An unlocked automobile 
with keys in the ignition is a temptation. A parked vehicle

equipment shopping lists. Many of the rings are interna-
tional, ﬁ lling equipment needs in underdeveloped coun-
tries (“Heavy Equipment,” 2008).
National surveys suggest that the total cost of heavy 
equipment theft could be as much as $1 billion each year in 
the United States alone. More worrisome is that less than 
20 percent of stolen heavy equipment is ever recovered. 
Adding to the problem is the fact that product identiﬁ -
cation numbers (PIN) are nonstandard, vary dramatically 
in format among manufacturers and may be located in 
numerous, often hard-to-ﬁ nd locations.
Th e NICB Web site notes that rubber-tired equipment 
is most likely to be stolen because it can be driven away 
under its own power. Th e most popular targets are skid 
steers, backhoes and dump trucks. Most vulnerable are 
less-secure construction sites on weekends. Th e stolen 
vehicles usually stay intact.
In 2002, the National Equipment Register (NER) was 
launched, a signiﬁ cant step toward reducing this ongo-
ing problem. According to the NER, heavy equipment is 
stolen because the reward for the thief far outweighs the 
risk. Heavy equipment has little physical machine or site 
security, is valuable and is easy to sell. In addition, the 
theft often is not discovered for hours, even days, after it 
is committed (“Problem of Heavy,” 2008).
Th e NER has registered more than 70,000 theft reports 
and provides access to more than 12 million equipment 
ownership records. Th e NER provides law enforcement 
oﬃ  cers with expert, free assistance in investigating and 
prosecuting equipment theft, including
• • 24/7 access to specialist NER operators who will oﬀ er 
expert advice on equipment identiﬁ cation, PIN loca-
tions and other identiﬁ cation techniques.
• • 24/7 searches of the NER database online via a toll-
free number (866-FIND-PIN).
• • 24/7 access to millions of ownership records through 
NER operators.
• • Additional online investigation tools such as PIN 
location information.
• • Local and national training programs.
Many construction companies have formed protec-
tion programs, have identiﬁ ed their equipment with spe-
cial markings and have oﬀ ered rewards for information 
about thefts. Local construction ﬁ rms can also provide 
information about possible outlets for stolen parts.
Th e NER recommends that site security be enhanced 
by posting “no trespassing” signs and using fencing, gates, 
locks and good lighting. Vehicle security can be enhanced 
by marking, anchoring, and immobilizing equipment. 
Equipment not being used should be arranged in a way so 
that a missing unit would be obvious. Equipment should 
not be left on a trailer unattended.
motor scooters, mopeds and aircraft is similar to investi-
gating auto thefts.
TRUCKS AND TRAILERS
Usually trucks and trailers are stolen by professional 
thieves, although they are also stolen for parts. A “ﬁ nger-
man” often provides information to the thief. In most 
cases, the ﬁ ngerman is an employee of the company that 
owns the truck. A “spotter” locates the truck after getting 
information from the ﬁ ngerman and then follows the 
truck to the point where it is to be stolen. A driver experi-
enced in operating the targeted vehicle then commits the 
actual theft.
Truck trailers are usually stolen by simply backing up 
a tractor to the trailer and hauling it away. Th e trailer’s 
cargo is generally the target.
Stolen trucks and trailers are identiﬁ ed much as passen-
ger vehicles are—by the manufacturer or through the Com-
mercial Vehicle Identiﬁ cation Manual published by the NICB.
CONSTRUCTION VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT
Th e NICB Web site notes that heavy equipment theft is a 
growing problem, with approximately 5,500 heavy equip-
ment thefts reported to the NCIC in 2001, including 
backhoes, bulldozers and dump trucks. Th e recovery rate 
was only 9 to 18 percent. Most of the thefts were com-
mitted by organized crime rings, which often had targeted 
Determined car thieves have found a way to cut through steering 
wheels and circumvent antitheft devices such as The Club. Pedals 
are virtually unbreakable, so the Pedal Jack antitheft device has 
become an attractive security option for many vehicle owners. The 
heavy duty, electrically heat-treated tempered steel is saw-proof, 
drill-proof and cannot be fractured by Freon gas. Furthermore, the 
device is fully adjustable to ﬁ t virtually all automatic transmission-
equipped cars, SUVs, vans and light trucks. (Courtesy Unelko Security 
Systems, www.unelko.com)

CHAPTER 15 | Motor Vehicle Theft | 469
RECREATIONAL VEHICLES
More than 450 makes and models of recreational vehicles 
(RVs) are marketed in the United States. Because there 
are so many makes and models, contact the manufacturer 
for any special numbers not readily visible. Recreational 
vehicles are also targets for vehicle burglaries because 
many contain CB radios, televisions, DVDs and appli-
ances. Many false theft claims are made because of the 
high cost of operating these vehicles.
MOTORIZED BOATS AND JET SKIS
Since 1972, many states have required licensing boats, 
including an identiﬁ cation number on the boat’s hull. 
Most such identiﬁ cation numbers are 10 to 13 digits. Th e 
ﬁ rst several digits are the manufacturer’s number. Th is is 
followed by four or ﬁ ve identiﬁ cation digits and several 
certiﬁ cation digits.
Boat Watch USA oﬀ ers these suggestions to prevent 
boat theft: Mark the vessel by etching your driver’s license 
number in several inconspicuous places and aﬃ  xing a 
Boat Watch USA decal in a prominent location. Record 
the speciﬁ cs and eﬀ ects of the boat by inventorying all 
electronics and other gear, as well as the boat and trailer. 
Photograph the boat. Secure it using the best locks you 
can buy (“Boaters Watching Out,” 2008). Other options 
include arming the vessel with an alarm system and insur-
ing it. Th e same precautions apply to Jet Skis.
Because boats also are the objects of many fraudulent 
insurance claims, investigators should determine whether 
the theft claim is legitimate.
SNOWMOBILES
Snowmobiles are easy to steal because they can be trans-
ported inside vans and trucks. Most major snowmobile 
manufacturers use chassis and engine numbers that aid 
in identiﬁ cation.
A popular snowmobile resort in Lanaudiere, Quebec, 
reduced snowmobile theft by more than 50 percent through 
the joint eﬀ orts of tourism operators and law enforcement. 
Tourism operators invested heavily in video surveillance and 
alarm equipment at restaurants, lodges, hotels, motels and 
other tourist-oriented businesses. Police involvement was 
stepped up as well, with local law enforcement waging a delib-
erate war on snowmobile thieves, making the region known 
as a bad place to steal snowmobiles, trucks and trailers.
MOTORCYCLES, MOTOR SCOOTERS AND 
MOPEDS
“Just because motorcycles have half the wheels as most 
vehicles does not mean they are not tempting targets for 
Th e NER has a pocket-sized reference, Law Enforce-
ment Identiﬁ cation Guide for Construction and Agricultural 
Equipment, which includes theft indicators, commonly 
stolen equipment, location of PIN numbers and other use-
ful items for investigators. Th e NER oﬀ ers the following 
“red ﬂ ags” as theft indicators, cautioning that legitimate 
explanations might exist for any of the indicators.
Transport
• • Equipment being transported late at night or on week-
ends or holidays. Equipment theft most often hap-
pens at those times.
• • Hauled equipment that is being moved in a hurry and 
therefore lacks the proper tie-downs, over-width/
over-weight signs or lights.
• • Equipment being hauled on trucks not designed to 
haul such equipment.
• • Equipment being hauled with buckets in the up posi-
tion or booms not lowered.
• • New equipment on old transport.
• • Th e labels/markings on a piece of equipment do not 
match those of the unit carrying or hauling it.
Use and Location
• • Equipment in an unsecured location that has not been 
moved for some time—either by repeat observation or 
the age of the tracks leading to the equipment.
• • Th e type of equipment does not suit the location or 
use—such as construction equipment on a farm or in 
a residential area with no building activity.
Equipment and Markings
• • Equipment with missing PIN plates. Manufactur-
ers generally use mounting techniques that make it 
unlikely for a PIN plate to fall oﬀ  during normal use.
• • Equipment that has been entirely repainted or that 
has decals removed or painted over.
• • Manufacturer decals or model number stickers do 
not match the piece of equipment to which they are 
aﬃ  xed.
• • A commercially manufactured trailer with registration 
plates reﬂ ecting a homemade trailer (certain states only).
Price
• • Equipment that is being oﬀ ered, or has been pur-
chased, at a price well below market value.
When looking for “red ﬂ ags,” focus on the 10 most 
commonly stolen pieces of equipment, which account for 
90 percent of all stolen equipment reported to the NER.

According to the brief, GA aircraft are incapable of causing 
signiﬁ cant damage. Th e typical GA aircraft—for example, 
a Cessna 172—weighs less than a Honda Civic and carries 
even less cargo. 
Th e AOPA sponsors an Airport Watch, similar to a com-
munity’s Neighborhood Watch, with America’s pilots and 
aircraft owners banding together to protect our small air-
ports. Everyone is encouraged to get to know one another 
and to report anything that appears to be suspicious. Greet 
strangers. Have a cell phone, a camera or pen and paper 
handy to record any suspicious activity, including
• • Pilots who appear under the control of someone else.
• • Anyone trying to access an aircraft through force.
• • Anyone who seems unfamiliar with aviation 
procedures.
• • Anyone who misuses aviation lingo—or seems too 
eager to use the lingo.
• • People or groups who seem determined to keep to 
themselves.
• • Anyone who appears to be just loitering.
• • Any out-of-the-ordinary videotaping of aircraft or 
hangars.
• • Dangerous cargo or loads.
• • Anything that strikes you as wrong.
Th e AOPA urges its members to use common sense. 
Any of the preceding could have a logical explanation. 
However, when in doubt it should be checked out (“AOPA’s 
Airport Watch,” 2008, p.11). Chapter 20 discusses in 
depth the investigation of terrorist activity.
thieves and insurance fraud scams. Like cars, sport utility 
vehicles and trucks, stolen motorcycles oﬀ er criminals a 
full-throttle avenue to huge proﬁ ts” (“Motorcycle Vehicle 
Th eft,” 2008).
Th e NICB states that many motorcycles cost $20,000 
or more. It also notes that in 2001, 44,000 motorcycle 
thefts were reported to the NCIC, with a low recovery rate 
of 25 to 30 percent (“Motorcycles Oﬀ er,” 2008). Motorcy-
cles, motor scooters and mopeds are easy to steal because 
they lack security devices and are often left unprotected. 
Th e lock number is easily identiﬁ ed, and substitute keys 
can be made. Th ese cycles can be driven away or loaded 
onto trailers or into vans and transported, perhaps sev-
eral at a time. A professional thief takes only 20 seconds 
to steal a motorcycle.
Identifying motorcycles is diﬃ  cult because of the 
many types and the fact that parts are not readily identi-
ﬁ able. However, identiﬁ cation numbers can often be ob -
tained through the NICB, local dealers and manufacturers.
Th e NICB oﬀ ers the following prevention suggestions: 
Lock your motorcycle, even when it is stored in a garage; 
be wary of used cycles titled or registered as an “assem-
bled vehicle”; be wary of cloned motorcycles; and obtain 
an expert appraisal or insurance policy pre-inspection 
before purchasing and insuring a used cycle.
AIRCRAFT
Yet another area of motor vehicle theft that may be inves-
tigated, although relatively rare, is theft of aircraft: “Th efts 
of single-engine propeller-driven planes are rare; typically 
fewer than ten occur each year” (Straw, 2007, p.30). Air-
craft theft, although infrequent, is a high-value theft. Such 
thefts are jointly investigated by the FBI and the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA). Many stolen aircraft are 
used in narcotics smuggling, so that the plane can be sac-
riﬁ ced at no cost if there is danger of apprehension.
Aircraft identiﬁ cation consists of a highly visible 
N identiﬁ cation number painted on the fuselage. Many air-
craft parts, including the engine, radio equipment, landing 
gear and tires, also have individual serial numbers. Aircraft 
identiﬁ cation can be veriﬁ ed through the manufacturer.
After the September 11, 2001, attack on the World 
Trade Center and the Pentagon, security of aircraft has 
become more of a priority. However, a security brief 
by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) 
stressed, “General aviation (GA) aircraft do not pose a sig-
niﬁ cant terrorist threat to the United States. In fact, there 
has been no terrorist attack anywhere in the world using 
a general aviation aircraft (“General Aviation,” 2008). 
Technology Innovations
Brecken (2005) describes Secure Start 1000, an 
antiterrorist security device certiﬁ ed on most King 
Air, Diamond, Beechjet and Cessna Caravan models. 
The system was developed to provide proven theft 
deterrence that disables the engine’s start circuits to 
unauthorized users. It is operated by a double access 
code keyboard. The keyboard also indicates prior 
tampering by unauthorized users, signifying to the 
authorized ﬂ ight crew that there has been a security 
breach. The system can be installed during routine 
maintenance or during an inspection.

Motor vehicle thefts take much investigative time, but 
they can provide important information on other crimes 
under investigation. Th e VIN, critical in motor vehicle 
theft investigations, identiﬁ es the speciﬁ c vehicle in ques-
tion. Th is number is the primary nonduplicated, serialized 
number assigned by the manufacturer to each vehicle.
 
Categories of motor vehicle theft based on the oﬀ end-
er’s motive include (1) joyriding, (2) transportation, (3) 
commission of another crime, (4) stripping for parts and 
accessories and (5) reselling for proﬁ t.
 
Although referred to as “motor vehicle theft,” most of 
these crimes are prosecuted as “unauthorized use of a motor 
vehicle” because a charge of theft requires proof that the 
thief intended to deprive the owner of the vehicle perma-
nently, which is often diﬃ  cult or impossible to establish.
 
Th e elements of the crime of unauthorized use of a 
motor vehicle are (1) intentionally taking or driving (2) a 
motor vehicle (3) without the consent of the owner or the 
owner’s authorized agent. Motor vehicles include automo-
biles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, motor scooters, mopeds, 
snowmobiles, vans, self-propelled watercraft and aircraft. 
Embezzlement of a motor vehicle occurs if the person who 
took the vehicle had consent initially and then exceeded 
the terms of that consent. 
 
Th e Dyer Act made interstate transportation of a sto-
len motor vehicle a federal crime and allowed for federal 
help in prosecuting such cases. False reports of motor 
vehicle theft are often ﬁ led because a car has been taken 
by a family member or misplaced in a parking lot, to cover 
up for a crash or a crime committed with the vehicle or 
to provide an alibi for being late to some commitment 
deemed important enough to ﬁ le a false police report 
over. Th e FBI and the NICB provide valuable help in inves-
tigating motor vehicle theft.
 
To improve your ability to recognize stolen vehicles, keep 
a hot sheet in your car, develop a checking system for rapidly 
determining whether a suspicious vehicle is stolen, learn the 
common characteristics of stolen vehicles and car thieves, 
take time to check suspicious persons and vehicles and learn 
how to question suspicious drivers and occupants.
 
Numerous motor vehicle thefts can be prevented by 
eﬀ ective educational campaigns and by manufacturer-
installed security devices.

MEDIA EXPLORATIONS
A. On July 2, an internist ﬁ nished his shift at a Veterans 
Administration hospital and went to the hospital park-
ing lot to ﬁ nd that his Triumph TR4A was missing. He 
called the local police, but they refused to come, saying 
that because the theft occurred on federal property, it was 
the FBI’s problem. Th e doctor called the FBI, which ﬁ rst 
said it would not investigate a car theft unless the car was 
transported out of the state. Th e doctor’s insurance com-
pany ﬁ nally convinced the FBI to investigate the theft, 
which it did. Two days later, local police in a town 529 
miles away discovered the TR4A abandoned in the park-
ing lot at a racetrack. Because the car had been hot-wired, 
they assumed it was stolen and made inquiries to the state 
DMV about its ownership. Th e car was towed to a local 
storage garage. When it was learned who owned the TR4A, 
local police contacted the police in the doctor’s city.
 
Because that police department had no record of a 
stolen TR4A, oﬃ  cers there assumed that the message was 
in error. It was a holiday weekend, they were busy and 
the matter was dropped. Eight months later, the storage 
garage called the doctor to ask him when he was coming to 
get his car.
Questions
 1. What mistakes were made in this incident?
 2. Who is primarily to blame for the eight-month delay 
in returning the car to the owner?
B. Samuel Paris parked his 1999 Corvette in front of 
his home shortly after midnight when he and his wife 
returned from a party. He locked the car and took the keys 
with him. He discovered the vehicle missing the following 
morning at about 7:45 when he was leaving for work. He 
immediately called the police to report an auto theft.
Questions
 1. Were his actions correct?
 2. What should the police department do upon receiving 
the call?
 3. What should the oﬃ  cer who is assigned to the case 
do?
 1. How do you identify a stolen vehicle so you can prove 
in court it was in fact stolen?
 2. What evidence do you need to charge a suspect with 
unauthorized use of a motor vehicle? Embezzlement 
of a vehicle?

Outline
rson, the malicious, willful burning of a building or property, is one of the
 oldest crimes known. It has probably been practiced since soon after ﬁ re was 
discovered. Arson is a combination crime against persons and property, threatening 
life and causing immense property losses. In October 1978, Congress mandated that 
the FBI reclassify arson as a Part One Index crime in its Uniform Crime Reporting 
Program, eﬀ ective March 1979.
A

476 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
 
Arson is diﬃ  cult to prove because in many ﬁ res the 
evidence is consumed and there are few witnesses. Few 
police oﬃ  cers or investigators have extensive training in 
investigating arson, and they are often confused by the 
complications involved in securing evidence and cooper-
ating with other agencies.
 
Many sources gather statistics on ﬁ res, including the 
FBI, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), 
insurance companies, state ﬁ re marshal’s oﬃ  ces, state 
crime bureaus, sheriﬀ ’s oﬃ  ces and local police and ﬁ re 
departments. Th e FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) 
show 69,055 arson oﬀ enses were reported in 2006, an 
increase of 21 percent from 2005, with an average dam-
age of $13,325 (Crime in the United States, 2006). Of these 
arson oﬀ enses, 42.3 percent were structure ﬁ res with an 
average damage valued at $21,276.
 
Th e NFPA presents somewhat diﬀ erent statistics, 
describing all ﬁ res reported during 2006, many of which 
needed to be investigated to rule out arson (Karter, 2007). 
Some 1,642,500 ﬁ res were reported, up 3 percent from 
2005, with 3,245 civilian ﬁ re deaths, 16,400 civilian ﬁ re 
injuries, $11.3 billion in property damage and 89 ﬁ re-
ﬁ ghter deaths (not necessarily restricted to ﬁ res). Of all 
ﬁ res reported in 2006, 524,000 were structure ﬁ res, up 
3 percent, with 2,705 civilian ﬁ re deaths, 14,350 civilian 
ﬁ re injuries and $9.6  billion in property damage. Vehicle 
ﬁ res numbered 278,000, down 4 percent, with 490 civil-
ian ﬁ re deaths, 1,200 civilian ﬁ re injuries and $1.3 billing 
in property damage (Karter).
 
Th e NFPA “Fire Loss Clock” reports ﬁ re departments 
responded to a ﬁ re every 19 seconds, one structure ﬁ re was 
reported every 60 seconds, one home structure ﬁ re was 
reported every 80 seconds, one vehicle ﬁ re was reported 
every 113 seconds, one civilian ﬁ re injury was reported 
every 32 minutes, and one civilian ﬁ re death occurred every 
2 hours and 42 minutes (Karter, 2007).
CLASSIFICATION OF FIRES
Fires are classiﬁ ed as natural, accidental, criminal 
(arson), suspicious or of unknown origin.
A natural ﬁ re is one set intentionally to destroy 
refuse, weeds or waste products in industrial 
processes or to provide warmth. It is easy to determine 
that such ﬁ res are natural.
An accidental ﬁ re, as the name implies, is not inten-
tional. Fires can be accidentally ignited by the heat of the 
sun’s rays, lightning, faulty wiring, leaking gas, a carelessly 
tossed cigarette, overheated Christmas tree lights, chil-
dren playing with matches and many other causes. Arson-
ists usually try to make their ﬁ res appear accidental.
A criminal ﬁ re (arson) is ignited intentionally and 
maliciously to destroy property or buildings. Proof must 
be obtained that the ﬁ re was not natural or accidental.
A suspicious ﬁ re is one suspected as arson even though 
proof is lacking.
A ﬁ re of unknown origin is one in which there is no evi-
dence to indicate whether the ﬁ re was natural, accidental 
or criminal. Th e cause is simply not known.
Fires are presumed natural or accidental unless proven 
otherwise.
Th e prosecution has the burden of proving that a ﬁ re 
is not accidental or natural. Because arson cases are hard to 
prove and require a great deal of work, they are unattractive 
to prosecutors. Moreover, a prosecutor may feel uneasy with 
the large amount of expert scientiﬁ c testimony required.
Exercise caution in investigating ﬁ res. Most are not 
the result of arson. Do not unduly suspect property own-
ers who have already been subjected to ﬁ re losses.
ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME
Under common law, the crime of arson was 
deﬁ ned as the malicious, willful burning of 
another’s house or outbuilding. It was considered such a 
serious oﬀ ense that the penalty was death. Laws have now 
extended arson to cover other buildings, personal prop-
erty, crops and the burning of one’s own property. As in 
other crimes, arson laws vary from state to state but share 
some common elements.
The elements of the crime of arson include
• • Willful, malicious burning of a building or property,
• • of another or of one’s own to defraud,
• • or causing to be burned, or aiding, counseling or 
procuring such burning.
Attempted arson is also a crime in most states.

CHAPTER 16 | Arson, Bombs and Explosives | 477
WILLFUL, MALICIOUS BURNING OF A 
BUILDING OR PROPERTY
Willful means “intentional.” If a motive is determined, 
intent can be proven; therefore, when possible, show 
motive even if it is not required by law. Merchandise or 
household goods moved in or out immediately before the 
ﬁ re help to establish motive and intent.
Malicious denotes a “spiteful, vindictive desire to 
harm others.” Malice is shown by circumstantial evidence 
such as statements of ill will, threats against persons or 
property, a recent increase in insurance coverage or past 
property burned.
Burning is the prime element in the corpus delicti. Th ere 
must be more than an exposure to heat, although ﬂ ames 
need not have been visible nor the property destroyed. 
Heating to the ignition point is suﬃ  cient even if the ﬁ re 
extinguishes itself.
OF ANOTHER OR OF ONE’S OWN TO DEFRAUD
Th e motive for burning another’s property can range from 
revenge to economic gain. Th e burning of one’s own prop-
erty, however, is almost always to defraud. Prove that 
the property was insured and show a motive for desiring 
the insurance money. Copies of the insurance policies 
obtained from the victim after serving proper notice show 
whether an excessive amount of insurance was taken 
out, whether recent additions or changes were made in 
the policy or whether the insurance was soon to expire. 
Businesses are sometimes burned because they are failing 
ﬁ nancially, which can be established by business records 
or employee statements.
CAUSING TO BE BURNED, OR AIDING, 
COUNSELING OR PROCURING THE BURNING
A person who hires a professional (a “torch”) to commit 
arson is also guilty of the crime. Seek evidence connecting 
this person with the actual arsonist.
CLASSIFICATION OF ARSON
States vary in how they classify arson and related 
crimes.
AGGRAVATED AND SIMPLE ARSON
Some laws categorize arson as either aggravated or 
simple.
Aggravated arson is intentionally destroying or damag-
ing a dwelling or other property by means of ﬁ re or 
explosives or other infernal device—creating an 
imminent danger to life or great bodily harm, which 
risk was known or reasonably foreseeable to the 
suspect. Simple arson is an intentional destruction by 
ﬁ re or explosives that does not create imminent 
danger to life or risk of great bodily harm.
Fire does not require visible burning or an actual 
ﬂ ame, but it must involve some extent of burning. Explo-
sives include any device, apparatus or equipment that 
causes damage by combustion or explosion, such as time 
bombs, Molotov cocktails, missiles, plastic explosives, 
grenades and dynamite. Destruction or damage does not 
require total destruction or consummation. Damage 
that aﬀ ects the value or usefulness of the property is 
suﬃ  cient.
Creating an imminent danger to life or risk of great 
bodily harm is assumed whenever the burned structure 
is a dwelling or is likely to have people within it. Peo-
ple need not be there at the time. If the danger or risk 
was known or reasonably foreseeable means that even 
if the suspect did not intend to harm anyone, the risk 
should have been known or reasonably anticipated. If 
a person dies in a fire set by an arsonist, the death 
is first-degree murder, an additional offense to be 
prosecuted.
ATTEMPTED ARSON
Th e elements of attempted arson are the intent to set a 
ﬁ re and some preparation to commit the crime. Th e intent 
is normally speciﬁ c, and the act must be overt. It must be 
shown that the ﬁ re would have occurred except for some 
intervention. Attempted arson also includes placing any 
combustible or explosive material or device in or near any 
property with the intent to set ﬁ re, to destroy or to oth-
erwise damage property. Putting materials together at a 
location where they could not cause a ﬁ re does not consti-
tute attempted arson.
SETTING NEGLIGENT FIRES
Setting a negligent ﬁ re is deﬁ ned as causing a ﬁ re to burn 
or to get out of control through culpable negligence, creat-
ing an unreasonable risk and the likelihood of damage or 
injury to persons or property. Th is charge is often brought 
against people who leave smoldering campﬁ res that cause 
forest ﬁ res.

478 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
accounting for 85 of every 100 lives lost” (Putnam and 
Kirkpatrick, 2005, p.1). A review of the literature reveals 
a distinction between fireplay and firesetting behavior. 
Fireplay conveys a low level of intent to inflict harm 
and an absence of malice; rather, it involves curiosity 
and fascination. Firesetting is “decidedly different” 
and involves malice and intent to inflict harm (Putnam 
and Kirkpatrick).
Juvenile ﬁ resetters are often divided into four catego-
ries: curiosity/experimental, troubled/crisis, delinquent/
criminal and pathological/emotionally disturbed (Juvenile 
Firesetting, 2006, p.1). Th e curiosity ﬁ resetters are mainly 
children between ages 2 and 10 who experiment with 
or cause accidental ﬁ res. Th e troubled/crisis ﬁ resetters 
are mostly boys of any age whose ﬁ resetting represents 
“underlying psychosocial conﬂ icts.” Delinquent/criminal 
ﬁ resetters are adolescents between ages 13 and 18 with 
a long history of undetected ﬁ resetting who start ﬁ res as 
acts of vandalism or malicious mischief, but always with 
an intent to destroy. Pathological/emotionally disturbed 
ﬁ resetters’ actions result from psychosocial conﬂ ict and 
may be random, ritualized or with speciﬁ c intent to 
destroy property. Th ese ﬁ resetters can be boys or girls of 
any age and typically display a chronic history of behav-
ioral and social problems.
In arson, unlike other crimes, the victim is often 
the prime suspect. Motivation, although it need not be 
proved, has great signiﬁ cance in arson investigations.
MOTIVATION
Common motives include revenge, spite or jealousy; van-
dalism and malicious mischief; crime concealment and 
diversionary tactics; proﬁ t and insurance fraud; intimida-
tion, extortion and sabotage; and psychiatric aﬄ  ictions, 
pyromania, alcoholism and mental retardation.
Revenge, spite, and jealousy motivate jilted lovers, feud-
ing neighbors, disgruntled employees, quarreling spouses, 
people who feel cheated or abused and those who feel 
racial or religious hostility. In rural areas, disagreements 
often result in the burning of homes or barns.
Vandalism and malicious mischief are frequent motives 
for juveniles who burn property merely to relieve bore-
dom or as a general protest against authority. Many ﬁ res 
in schools, abandoned autos, vacant buildings and trash 
containers are caused by this type of arsonist.
Crime concealment and diversionary tactics motivate 
criminals to set ﬁ res to destroy evidence of a crime or 
evidence connecting them to the crime. In murder cases 
arson can be used to attempt to make it impossible 
to identify a victim. In other cases, people set ﬁ res to 
destroy records containing evidence of embezzlement, 
forgery or fraud. Arson is also used to divert attention 
THE MODEL ARSON LAW
The Model Arson Law was written and pro-
moted in the 1920s by the NFPA. Th e latest 
revision is included in Th e Fire Almanac, published annu-
ally by the same organization. Many states do not clas-
sify ﬁ res as aggravated or simple but instead have adopted 
the Model Arson Law, which speciﬁ es four degrees of 
arson.
The Model Arson Law divides arson into the following 
degrees:
• • First-degree: burning of dwellings
• • Second-degree: burning of buildings other than 
dwellings
• • Third-degree: burning of other property
• • Fourth-degree: attempting to burn buildings or 
property
Th e Model Arson Law includes within each degree not 
only the actual act but also anyone who aids, counsels or 
procures the act.
THE ARSONIST
According to the FBI’s UCR, most of those 
arrested for arson are white males and more 
than half are under age 18, a higher rate of juvenile 
involvement than any other Index crime. Th e typical adult 
male arsonist has been reared in a broken or unstable 
home, has an extensive criminal history, is below average 
intelligence, lacks marital ties, is socially maladjusted or a 
loner, is unemployed or working in an unskilled position 
and is intoxicated at the time he sets the ﬁ re.
Female arsonists usually burn their own property, 
rarely that of an employer, neighbor or associate. Th ey are 
often self-destructive, mentally defective, older, lonely, 
and unhappy and often have some psychotic problems, 
primarily schizophrenia.
JUVENILE FIRESETTING
Juvenile firesetting can have tragic, costly conse-
quences: “In a typical year, fires set by children and 
youths claim the lives of approximately 300 people and 
destroy more than $300 million worth of property. 
Children are the predominant victims of these fires, 

CHAPTER 16 | Arson, Bombs and Explosives | 479
The professional torch—the arsonist for hire—is 
extremely difficult to identify because such individu-
als have no apparent link to the fire. However, the 
victim is also under suspicion in many instances. A 
guilty victim typically has an ironclad alibi. Also to 
be considered is the unintentional firesetter, that is, 
the individual who accidentally sets a fire and then is 
too embarrassed to admit it or who fears that insur-
ance may not cover the loss if the accident is made 
known.
Computer software can play a pivotal role in identify-
ing serial arsonists by allowing investigators to eﬃ  ciently 
organize and manage tips, evidence and other information 
about related ﬁ res. Such case management can shorten 
investigations by months.
POLICE AND FIRE 
DEPARTMENT COOPERATION
Arson is investigated by many agencies with 
joint jurisdiction: state ﬁ re marshals, state 
police, county sheriﬀ s and local police and ﬁ re depart-
ments. In addition, insurance investigators often become 
involved.
Lack of trained personnel to investigate arson is 
a major problem in both police and fire departments, 
except in large cities that have their own arson inves-
tigation squads. Although arson is a crime, police tend 
to give it low priority, believing that the fire depart-
ment should investigate. However, many firefighters 
are volunteers who are not trained in arson inves-
tigation. Many full-time departments do not train 
their personnel to investigate arson. Rural areas and 
cities of as many as 75,000 in population rely heavily 
on the state fire marshal’s office, which usually does 
not have enough staff to conduct full investigations 
throughout the state. State fire marshal’s offices can 
help local police and fire agencies by providing advice, 
coordinating activities and supplying information on 
suspect profiles. They cannot, however, assume full 
responsibility for the investigation. Even fire depart-
ments that provide training in arson detection seldom 
include training on the criminal procedures followed in 
prosecuting arson.
Attitudes about the responsibility for investigat-
ing arson vary. Some fire departments feel that arson 
investigation and prosecution are their responsibil-
ity; others feel just as strongly that arson is a police 
matter.
while criminals commit another crime or cover their 
escape.
Proﬁ t and insurance fraud are frequent motives for 
arson. A businessperson may wind up in ﬁ nancial straits 
and decide that the easiest way out is to burn the business 
and collect the insurance. Some people over-insure prop-
erty and then burn it, collecting far more than the prop-
erty was worth. For example, a St. Louis property owner 
received more than $415,000 in insurance payments for 
54 ﬁ res occurring within a 2-year period. In large cities, 
professional arson rings defraud insurance companies of 
millions of dollars.
Other methods of obtaining proﬁ t have used arson 
to stimulate business, to eliminate business rivals or to 
secure employment—for example, a security guard, ﬁ re-
ﬁ ghter, or police oﬃ  cer might set ﬁ res to obtain a job. In 
South Carolina, ﬁ ve ﬁ reﬁ ghters were charged with arson 
believed to be motivated not by proﬁ t but by a desire to 
practice ﬁ ghting ﬁ res. In other cases, ﬁ reﬁ ghters have set 
ﬁ res and then responded to the alarm, receiving atten-
tion and praise at having “played the hero.” Th ese “vanity” 
arsonists are called strikers.
Fireﬁ ghters aren’t the only ones who seek to become 
heroes. In December 1999, a male nurse set a ﬁ re that 
killed billionaire banker Edmond Safra, stating he hoped 
to emerge as the hero who saved his employer’s life. Safra 
was terriﬁ ed that assailants were after him and locked 
himself in his Monaco penthouse bathroom, refusing to 
leave even when police and ﬁ reﬁ ghters arrived. He died of 
asphyxiation.
Intimidation, extortion and sabotage are motives of 
striking workers and employers to apply pressure during a 
strike. Criminals, especially mobsters, use arson to intimi-
date witnesses and to extort money. Protesters have also 
used arson as a way of sending a message. For example, an 
environmental group claimed responsibility for a series of 
ﬁ res that caused $12 million in damage in protest of Vail 
Associates moving forward with its controversial 885-acre 
ski resort expansion.
Psychiatric aﬄ  ictions, pyromania, alcoholism and men-
tal retardation account for many other ﬁ res. Pyromani-
acs start ﬁ res because of an irresistible urge or passion 
for ﬁ re. Some derive sexual satisfaction from watching 
ﬁ res. Others become arsonists to show power over their 
environment or because they believe they are acting with 
divine guidance.
Several studies reveal revenge as the most common 
motive. Nonetheless, many arson investigators believe 
that insurance fraud is the most prevalent motive for 
arson. It may be that arson intended to defraud is often 
hired out to a professional who is less likely to get caught 
and, if apprehended, is more likely to have better legal 
counsel.

480 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
in an area where arson ﬁ res are being set. Specialized tech-
niques such as interviewing witnesses and interrogating 
suspects are normal police operations. Moreover, police 
have contacts with informants and arrest power.
COORDINATING EFFORTS
Regardless of the actual agency assigned to an arson inves-
tigation, someone must coordinate the eﬀ orts of every-
one involved. A full-time arson squad has the potential 
for conducting the best arson investigation. Th e next best 
arrangement is to have a well-trained arson investigator 
from local jurisdictions or the state ﬁ re marshal’s oﬃ  ce. 
However, police personnel trained in criminal investiga-
tion working with ﬁ re personnel trained in arson detec-
tion can do an eﬀ ective job if they mutually agree about 
who is in charge. Cross-training is one way to help police 
and ﬁ reﬁ ghters understand each other’s roles.
OTHER SOURCES 
OF ASSISTANCE IN 
INVESTIGATING ARSON
Other sources of assistance in investigating 
arson are the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the news media, insur-
ance companies and arson task forces.
THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, 
FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES
On January 24, 2003, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms became part of the Department of Justice under 
the Homeland Security bill and had its name expanded to 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 
to reﬂ ect the new focus on explosives-related crime and 
terrorism. Th e ATF has extensive resources for investigat-
ing arsons, including the ATF National Response Team, 
ready to investigate within 24 hours of receiving a call. 
For example, in January 2007, the team was called in to 
assist in the investigation of the fatal ﬁ re at the land-
mark Mizpah residential hotel at the request of the Reno 
(Nevada) Fire and Police Departments, the 620th activa-
tion since the program began (“ATF National Response 
Team Activated in Mizpah,” 2007). In May 2008, the team 
joined with special agents from the Los Angeles Field Divi-
sion to help the Los Angeles Fire Department investigate 
the Basque Night Club ﬁ re in Hollywood because of the 
size and complexity of the ﬁ re scene and the historical 
Logic suggests that the ﬁ re department should work to 
detect arson and determine the ﬁ re’s point of origin and 
probable cause, whereas the police department should 
investigate arson and prepare the case for prosecution.
FIRE DEPARTMENT EXPERTISE
Recognizing factors concerning smoke and ﬁ re conditions, 
detecting arson evidence and determining the cause of a 
ﬁ re are speciﬁ c areas of expertise for the ﬁ re department, 
which investigates many accidental and natural ﬁ res. To 
delegate this responsibility to the police department would 
be an unnecessary duplication of skill, especially because 
only a small number of ﬁ res are the result of arson.
Trained ﬁ re personnel know about buildings, how 
ﬁ res are started and the various components necessary 
for ignition. Fire marshals also have extralegal powers 
to summon witnesses, subpoena records and take state-
ments under oath that police oﬃ  cers do not have.
Moreover, ﬁ re personnel may enter buildings after a 
ﬁ re without a warrant, a beneﬁ t to criminal investigations. 
Th ey also work closely with insurance companies and are 
apt to recognize people frequently present at ﬁ res.
Th e ﬁ re department’s basic role is ﬁ re investigation 
and arson detection, rather than arson investigation. Once 
the cause of the ﬁ re is determined to be arson, the police 
are notiﬁ ed and the process becomes a joint investigation.
POLICE DEPARTMENT EXPERTISE
Police on patrol duty and investigators, through intel-
ligence ﬁ les, are likely to know possible arson suspects. 
Field-interview cards can include names of people present

by these bureaus as well. Most states provide lim-
ited civil immunity to insurance companies that pro-
vide information to law enforcement agencies in their 
investigations.
ARSON TASK FORCES
To coordinate existing forces and create new sources for 
combating arson and related problems in any community, 
county or state, arson task forces should be developed 
comprising ﬁ re and police department personnel; com-
munity leaders; insurance representatives; city, county 
and district attorneys; federal agency personnel; and oth-
ers. Arson has the lowest clearance by arrest of the major 
crimes, primarily because of inadequate training of ﬁ re 
and police department personnel, the diﬃ  culty of locat-
ing and preserving evidence and a lack of coordination of 
personnel of the various organizations involved.
Th e Web site of the Oﬃ  ce of the Illinois State Fire Mar-
shal describes its Juvenile Firesetters Task Force (www.
state.il.us/osfm/jfs/jfs.htm), whose goal is “to develop 
and coordinate a comprehensive statewide program to 
identify, intervene with and counsel juveniles. Th e goal of 
the task force is, “To develop and coordinate a compre-
hensive statewide program to identify, intervene with, 
and counsel juveniles to reduce ﬁ re deaths, injuries, and 
property damage from criminal and non-criminal ﬁ res.” 
Other task force approaches can accomplish at least 
three goals:
 1. Detecting arson, including seeking ways to improve 
detection of, as well as to properly investigate and 
successfully prosecute the crime
 2. Reducing the number of arsons and deliberately set 
ﬁ res, in turn reducing property damage, physical inju-
ries and deaths
 3. Developing a preventive program aimed at educating 
and developing a working relationship with the peo-
ple the task force serves
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DISPATCHER
Local emergency dispatchers can play an important role 
in arson cases: “Today’s highly trained emergency dis-
patchers . . . are often a ﬁ re investigator’s ﬁ rst link to 
solving what may turn out to be a diﬃ  cult ﬁ re investiga-
tion. Often and without realizing it, the person answer-
ing the 9-1-1 call for help may be speaking to the person 
responsible for starting the ﬁ re. At the very least, per-
sons dialing 9-1-1 are early witnesses to the ﬁ re and may 
hold valuable information that no one else has” (Acker, 
2007, p.22).
signiﬁ cance of the structure (“ATF National Response 
Team Joins  Hollywood,” 2008). In June 2008, the team 
was called in to help the Texas State Fire Marshals Oﬃ  ce 
and the Texas Department of Public Safety investigate a 
ﬁ re that occurred at the Texas State Governor’s Mansion 
(“ATF National Response Team Activated to Texas,” 2008).
Other ATF resources include arson proﬁ lers; national 
laboratories in Georgia, Maryland and California; the 
Explosives Incidents Systems (EXIS) database, an intel-
ligence division; ﬁ nancial auditors; accelerant- detecting 
canines; photograph examiners; and Certiﬁ ed Fire 
Investigators.
NEWS MEDIA
One source of assistance frequently overlooked is the 
news media, which can publish proﬁ les of arsonists and 
seek the public’s help in identifying them. Th ey may also 
have photographs or videotapes of in-progress ﬁ res that 
can be extremely useful in investigations.
INSURANCE COMPANIES
Insurance companies can be very helpful in an arson inves-
tigation. Insurance companies usually request the insured 
to sign a release authorizing the company to obtain pri-
vate records such as income tax returns, ﬁ nancial audits, 
bank accounts, credit reports, telephone records and util-
ity company records. Without this release, obtaining such 
records is a long, complex process.
Private insurance company investigators can assist 
ﬁ re and police eﬀ orts in investigating ﬁ re losses. Many 
insurance companies have full-time ﬁ re loss investigators, 
whereas many smaller ﬁ re and police agencies do not. Th e 
objective is the same for both—obtaining the truth. For 
ﬁ re and police authorities, the goal is to locate the sus-
pect. If the suspect in a ﬁ re-for-proﬁ t act is arrested, ﬁ re 
loss problems for the insurance company are resolved.
Th e property owner must work with the ﬁ re and police 
departments and insurance company to collect the insur-
ance money. Consequently, interviewing and interrogat-
ing eﬀ orts are much enhanced. Background checks, bank 
and credit inquiries and ﬁ nancial status are also easier to 
verify.
Insurance investigators have the additional advan-
tage of being able to enter the ﬁ re scene without a warrant 
in their eﬀ orts to examine the damage and to determine 
the cause of the ﬁ re.
Further, several index bureaus gather insurance-
claim information in attempting to determine whether 
the same claim is being made to more than one company 
or whether a pattern of claims exists. Law enforcement 
investigators can beneﬁ t from information gathered 

482 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
The ﬁ re department usually receives the initial 
ﬁ re call unless the departments have a joint 
dispatcher or are merged into a public safety department. 
Fire personnel make out the reports and forward them to 
the state ﬁ re marshal. Insurance companies are also rep-
resented, and their eﬀ orts are coordinated with those of 
ﬁ re and police personnel.
Th e scene of a ﬁ re is dirty, messy and complicated, 
making it diﬃ  cult to obtain evidence of possible arson. 
An arson scene may be the most contaminated crime 
scene you will ever encounter. Piles of smoldering, black-
ened debris, often coated in foam or soaked with water, 
are diﬃ  cult environments in which to locate evidence. In 
addition, structural damage caused by the ﬁ re may make 
searching for such evidence even more hazardous. 
Although the ﬁ re department is responsible for estab-
lishing that arson has occurred, investigators must verify 
those ﬁ ndings by understanding what distinguishes an 
accidental ﬁ re from arson and by knowing what evidence 
and information are available for proving the elements of 
the crime.
THE FIRE TRIANGLE
Th e ﬁ re triangle is a basic concept critical to an arson 
investigation.
The ﬁ re triangle consists of three elements necessary 
for a substance to burn: air, fuel and heat. In arson, one 
or more of these elements is usually present in abnormal 
amounts for the structure.
Extra amounts of air or oxygen can result from opened 
windows or doors, pried-open vents or holes knocked in 
walls. Because ﬁ reﬁ ghters often chop holes in structures, 
determine whether any such openings were made by the 
ﬁ reﬁ ghters or by someone else. Fuel can be added by piling 
up newspapers, excelsior or other combustible materials 
found at or brought to the scene. Gasoline, kerosene and 
other accelerants add suﬃ  cient heat to the ﬁ re to cause 
the desired destruction after it has been ignited. 
ARSON INDICATORS
Several factors can alert investigators that the ﬁ re was 
probably the result of arson.
SPECIAL CHALLENGES IN 
INVESTIGATION
Special challenges in investigating arson include
• • Coordinating efforts with the ﬁ re department and 
others.
• • Determining whether a crime has been committed.
• • Finding physical evidence, most of which is 
destroyed by the ﬁ re.
• • Finding witnesses.
• • Determining whether the victim is a suspect.
Investigating arson often requires even more 
persistence, thoroughness and attention to 
minute details than do other crimes. Arson is a diﬃ  cult 
crime to investigate because there are seldom witnesses 
and the evidence needed to prove that a crime has been 
committed is usually consumed in the ﬁ re. Moreover, arson 
is an easy crime to write oﬀ  without being publicly criti-
cized because the victim and the suspect are often the same 
person. However, the innocent victim of arson is frequently 
frustrated by the lack of evidence and witnesses and by the 
police’s inability to prove that a crime was committed.
RESPONDING TO THE SCENE
While approaching a ﬁ re scene, ﬁ rst responders 
should observe, mentally note and, when time 
permits, record in notes (Fire and Arson, 2000, pp.13–14):
• • Th e presence, location and conditions of victims and 
witnesses
• • Vehicles leaving the scene, bystanders or unusual 
activities near the scene
• • Flame and smoke conditions (e.g., the volume of 
ﬂ ames and smoke; the color, height and location of 
ﬂ ames; the direction in which the ﬂ ames and smoke 
are moving)
• • Th e type of occupancy, use and condition of the 
structure
• • Conditions surrounding the scene
• • Weather conditions
• • Fire-suppression techniques used, including ventila-
tion, forcible entry and utility shutoﬀ  measures
• • Status of ﬁ re alarms, security alarms and sprinklers

CHAPTER 16 | Arson, Bombs and Explosives | 483
Common igniters include matches; candles; cigars; 
cigarettes; cigarette lighters; electrical, mechanical and 
chemical devices; and explosives.
Electrical devices left on, kerosene-soaked papers in 
waste baskets, time fuses, shorted light switches, mag-
nifying glasses, matches tied around a lighted cigarette 
and numerous other igniters have been used to commit 
arson.
Candles are often used in arsons because they give the 
suspect time to leave the scene. Th e average candle burns 
about 30 to 45 minutes per inch, depending on its size, 
shape, composition and the amount of air in the room. 
Tapered candles burn faster at the top and slower toward 
the base. Th e arsonist may control the length of time by 
cutting oﬀ  part of the candle before lighting it. Th e candle 
can be set in a material that will ignite once the candle 
burns down or the hot wax may be allowed to drip onto a 
surface to start a ﬁ re. Th e candle’s ﬂ ame can also be used 
to ignite other materials in the room.
Regardless of whether arsonists use direct or delayed 
ignition, they usually plan for the ﬁ re to consume the 
igniter; however, this often does not happen. Moreover, 
in their haste to leave the scene, arsonists may drop parts 
of the igniter in an area unaﬀ ected by the ﬁ re. Any igniter 
not normally present at the location is evidence.
Burn Indicators Burn indicators are visible evidence of 
the eﬀ ects of heating or partial burning. Th ey indicate vari-
ous aspects of a ﬁ re such as rate of development, tempera-
ture, duration, time of occurrence, presence of ﬂ ammable 
liquids and points of origin. Interpreting burn indicators is 
a primary means of determining the causes of ﬁ res.
Common burn indicators include alligatoring, crazing, 
the depth of char, lines of demarcation, sagged furniture 
springs and spalling.
Alligatoring is the checking of charred wood that 
gives it the appearance of alligator skin. Large, rolling 
blisters indicate rapid, intense heat. Small, ﬂ at alligator-
ing indicates slow, less intense heat.
Crazing is the formation of irregular cracks in 
glass due to rapid, intense heat, possibly caused by a ﬁ re 
accelerant.
Th e depth of char, or how deeply wood is burned, 
indicates the length of burn and the ﬁ re’s point of origin. 
Use a ruler to measure depth of char.
A line of demarcation is a boundary between 
charred and uncharred material. A puddle-shaped line of 
Accelerants
Evidence of accelerants, substances that promote com-
bustion, especially gasoline, is a primary form of physical 
evidence at an arson scene.
Most arson cases involve a ﬂ ammable liquid, and in 
80 percent of these cases, it is gasoline. Perhaps this is 
because gasoline is easily obtained and widely known to 
arsonists or because gasoline’s familiar odor makes it eas-
ier for investigators to detect. Other common accelerants 
are kerosene, charcoal lighter, paint thinner and lacquer 
solvent.
Look for residues of liquid ﬁ re accelerants on ﬂ oors, 
carpets and soil because the liquid accelerants run to the 
lowest level. In addition, these areas often have the low-
est temperatures during the ﬁ re and may not have enough 
oxygen to support complete combustion of the accelerant. 
Accelerants may seep through porous or cracked ﬂ oors to 
underlying soil that has excellent retention properties for 
ﬂ ammable liquids. Accelerants can also be found on the 
clothes and shoes of the suspect if apprehended. You can 
also identify ﬁ re accelerants at the scene either by your 
own sense of smell or by using portable equipment that 
detects residues of ﬂ ammable liquids.
Olfactory detection, the sensitivity of the human 
nose to gasoline vapor, is ineffective if the odor is 
masked by another strong odor, such as that of burned 
debris. Moreover, it is often inconvenient or impossible 
to sniff for accelerant odors along floors or in recessed 
areas.
Catalytic combustion detectors are the most common 
type of ﬂ ammable vapor detector used by arson investi-
gators. Commonly known as a sniﬀ er, a combustible gas 
indicator, an explosimeter or a vapor detector, this detector 
is portable, moderately priced and fairly simple to oper-
ate. Basically, vapor samples are pumped over a heated, 
platinum-plated wire coil that causes any combustible gas 
present to oxidize. Th e heat from the oxidation raises the 
coil’s electrical resistance, and this change is measured 
electrically.
Although ﬁ re accelerants are the most frequent 
type of evidence submitted to laboratories for analysis 
(80 percent), explosives (13 percent) and incendiary 
devices (4 percent) are also frequently submitted.
Igniters Igniters are substances or devices used to 
start ﬁ res. Th e most common igniters are matches. To be 
carrying matches is not damaging evidence unless some 
have been removed from the book or box and those found 
at an arson scene match those found in the suspect’s 
possession.

484 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
Given adequate ventilation, a ﬁ re will burn upward. If a 
door or window is open, it will be drawn toward that opening.
If the arsonist places a path of ﬂ ammable liquid, the 
ﬁ re will follow that path, known as a trailer. Trailers can 
be made of paper, hay, ﬂ ammable compounds or any sub-
stance that burns readily and they result in an abnormal 
pattern. Th e char marks will follow the trailer’s path.
Areas of uneven burning can also indicate the pres-
ence of an incendiary or that a great amount of ﬂ ammable 
material was already at the scene.
Appearance of Collapsed Walls Notice how walls seem 
to have collapsed, especially if you smell gas. Lighter gases 
demarcation on ﬂ oors or rugs can indicate use of a liquid 
ﬁ re accelerant. In a cross section of wood, a sharp, distinct 
line of demarcation indicates a rapid, intense ﬁ re.
Sagged furniture springs usually occur when a ﬁ re 
originates inside the cushions of upholstered furniture (as 
from a lighted cigarette rolling behind a cushion) or when 
a ﬁ re is intensiﬁ ed by an accelerant.
Spalling is the breaking oﬀ  of surface pieces of 
concrete or brick because of intense heat. Brown stains 
around the spall indicate use of an accelerant.
Point of Origin Knowing the ﬁ re’s point of origin helps 
to establish how the ﬁ re spread and whether it followed a 
normal burning pattern. Th e more extensive the destruc-
tion, the more diﬃ  cult it is to determine the ﬁ re’s point 
of origin.
The point of origin is established by ﬁ nding the area with 
the deepest char, alligatoring and usually the greatest 
destruction. More than one point of origin indicates 
arson.
Incendiary (igniter) evidence might be discovered at 
the point of origin. In addition, information from witnesses 
who saw the ﬁ re can establish where the ﬂ ames began.
Burning Pattern
Fires normally burn upward, not outward. They are drawn 
toward ventilation and follow fuel paths.
Varying degrees of alligatoring and 
charring are observed on the ﬂ oor joists 
of this single-family home that burned in 
Paciﬁ ca, California. This photo depicts 
intense heat from left to right and at the 
base of the ﬂ ooring. (© Robert Pinto)
A photograph of a line of demarcation, seen in this carpet, is 
important evidence in an arson investigation. A puddle-shaped line

accelerant. (© James Shaffer)

CHAPTER 16 | Arson, Bombs and Explosives | 485
Professional arsonists use a variety of methods to ignite 
ﬁ res, including
• • Connecting magnesium rods to timed detonators and 
placing them in a building’s electrical system. Th e rods 
burn with extreme intensity and cause a ﬁ re that looks 
as though it was caused by faulty wiring.
• • Connecting a timed explosive charge on one or more 
barrels of gasoline or other highly ﬂ ammable liquid. 
Th is method is often used when large areas such as 
warehouses are to be burned.
• • Pouring acid on key support points in steel-structured 
buildings to make certain the building will collapse 
during the ﬁ re.
PHOTOGRAPHING AND VIDEOTAPING AN 
ARSON FIRE
Pictures of a ﬁ re in progress show the smoke’s color and its 
origination as well as the size of the ﬁ re at diﬀ erent points 
and times. Pictures are especially useful if there appears to 
be acceleration of the ﬁ re at a speciﬁ c time that would indi-
cate arson or the presence of highly combustible substances. 
Many ﬁ re departments take such in-progress photographs. 
Smaller departments may seek help from television or 
newspaper photographers who may take pictures that can 
be of immense help. Photographs or videotapes of the ﬁ re 
scene are also ideal to show the judge and jury.
Pictures taken of people at the ﬁ re scene might reveal 
the presence of a known arsonist or show a person who 
repeatedly appears in photos taken at ﬁ res and is there-
fore an arson suspect.
tend to explode walls out from the top of the room; heavier 
gases explode walls out from the bottom of the room. Fast-
exploding gases such as hydrogen, acetylene or butane give 
the appearance of the walls caving in. If odors or the walls’ 
appearance suggests gas as the igniter or accelerator, deter-
mine whether the gas is normally on the premises.
Smoke Color Generally, blue smoke results from burn-
ing alcohol; white smoke from burning vegetable com-
pounds, hay or phosphorous; yellow or brownish yellow 
smoke from ﬁ lm, nitric acid, sulfur, hydrochloric acid or 
smokeless gunpowder; and black smoke from petroleum 
or petroleum products.
Notice the smoke’s color if the ﬁ re is still in progress. 
If it has been put out when you arrive, ask the ﬁ reﬁ ght-
ers or witnesses what color the smoke was. Determine 
whether substances likely to produce smoke of that color 
were on the premises before the ﬁ re.
SUMMARY OF ARSON INDICATORS
Arson is likely in ﬁ res that
• • Have more than one point of origin.
• • Deviate from normal burning patterns.
• • Show evidence of trailers.
• • Show evidence of having been accelerated.
• • Produce odors or smoke of a color associated with 
substances not normally present at the scene.
• • Indicate that an abnormal amount of air, fuel or heat 
was present.
• • Reveal evidence of incendiary igniters at the point 
of origin.
The black smoke in this ﬁ re indicates 
the involvement of petroleum or 
petroleum products. If these are not 
normally on the premises, arson is 
probable. (© 911 Pictures)

486 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
Th ese papers may provide a motive for the arson. If the 
paper is not destroyed, a laboratory may be able to recover 
any messages on it.
Do not overlook computer data, even if the computer 
has been involved in an intense ﬁ re. Th e hard drive may 
survive extreme heat and sometimes even direct ﬂ ames. It 
may also survive the water and steam encountered during 
suppression eﬀ orts.
An important step in an arson investigation is iden-
tifying potential accelerants at a ﬁ re scene. Th e accepted 
method is to use gas chromatography with a ﬂ ame ioniza-
tion detector (GC-FID), which can make identiﬁ cation in 
95 percent of the cases.
USING K-9S IN ARSON INVESTIGATIONS
Dogs can be of great assistance in arson investigation. Con-
necticut’s K-9 accelerant-detection program, for example, is 
the result of collaboration among the ATF, the New Haven 
County state’s attorney’s oﬃ  ce, the State Police Science 
Laboratory, the Emergency Services Division Canine Unit 
and the Bureau of the State Fire Marshal. Th eir ﬁ rst dog, 
Mattie, was trained to detect extremely small quantities of 
highly diluted ﬂ ammable and combustible liquids, includ-
ing paint remover and thinner, lacquer thinner, charcoal 
lighter ﬂ uid, kerosene, naphtha, acetone, dry gas, heptone, 
gasoline, number 2 fuel, diesel fuel, gum turpentine, Heri-
tage lamp oil, transmission ﬂ uid, octane and Jet-A-Fuel.
A lab-certiﬁ ed accelerant-detection canine can detect 
accelerants at ﬁ re scenes and can also search a crowd for 
possible suspects, search a suspect’s clothing and vehicle 
for the presence of accelerants and search areas for accel-
erant containers.
After the ﬁ re, take enough pictures to show the entire 
scene in detail. Start with the outside of the structure, 
showing all entries and exits. Also show any obstructions 
that were placed in front of windows to prevent seeing 
inside the building. People familiar with the structure can 
review the pictures for anything out of the ordinary.
Take inside pictures to show the extent of burning. 
Th ese will prove the corpus delicti. Take close-up pictures 
of extra papers, rags, gas cans or other suspicious sub-
stances, as well as examples of alligatoring and deep char-
ring. Take pictures at each stage of the search to show the 
point of origin, the nature of the burning and the direc-
tion and speed of the ﬁ re’s spread.
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Preserving evidence is a major problem because much 
of the evidence is very fragile. Follow carefully the pro-
cedures described in Chapter 5. Use disposable cellulose 
sponges to sop up accelerants for transfer to a container. 
Use hypodermic or cooking syringes to suck up acceler-
ants between boards or crevices. Sift ashes to detect small 
objects such as the timing device from an igniter.
Incendiary evidence at the point of origin can be part 
of a candle, an empty ﬂ ammable liquid container, exces-
sive amounts of unburned newspaper folded together or a 
number of unburned matches.
Paper exposed to high temperatures and suﬃ  cient 
air burns with little ash to examine. However, with a lim-
ited supply of air, only partial combustion occurs, leaving 
charred paper evidence that can be collected for laboratory 
examination. Paper in a ﬁ replace or stove may be only par-
tially burned, even if the building was totally consumed. 
Cars burn during a massive wildﬁ re

The Witch Fire, which started outside 
of Ramona, California, has burned 
hundreds of structures and forced 
thousands of evacuations as ﬁ res burn 
across Southern California. Although 
such wildﬁ res may be caused by 
natural forces such as lightning storms, 
others have been the result of arson.

CHAPTER 16 | Arson, Bombs and Explosives | 487
origin determination and a criminal warrant when evi-
dence of a crime is discovered. Both require probable cause 
for issuance.
An administrative warrant is issued when it is neces-
sary for a government agent to search the premises to 
determine the ﬁ re’s cause and origin. A criminal warrant 
is issued on probable cause when the premises yield 
evidence of a crime.
Both require an aﬃ  davit in support of the warrant that 
states the location and legal description of the property, 
the purpose (to determine the ﬁ re’s cause and origin), the 
area and time of the search, the use of the building and 
the measures taken to secure the structure or area of the 
ﬁ re. Searches are limited to the items speciﬁ ed in the war-
rant. Found evidence may be seized, but once the oﬃ  cers 
leave after ﬁ nding the evidence, they must have a criminal 
warrant to return to the premises for a further search.
Administrative warrants allow civil inspections of 
private property to determine compliance with city ordi-
nances such as ﬁ re codes. Th e Court has established guide-
lines for arson investigators. In Michigan v. Cliﬀ ord (1984), 
the Court held, “If a warrant is necessary, the object of 
the search determines the type of warrant required. If the 
primary object is to determine the cause and origin of a 
ﬁ re, an administrative warrant will suﬃ  ce. . . and if the 
primary object is to gather evidence of criminal activity, a 
criminal search warrant may be obtained only on a show-
ing of probable cause to believe that relevant evidence will 
be found in the place to be searched.”
In Coolidge v. New Hampshire (1971), the Court held 
that evidence of criminal activity discovered during a 
search with a valid administrative warrant may be seized 
under the plain-view doctrine. Any evidence so seized may 
be used to establish the probable cause needed to obtain a 
criminal search warrant.
Entry to ﬁ ght a ﬁ re requires no warrant. Once in the 
building, ﬁ re ofﬁ cials may remain a reasonable time 
to investigate the cause of the blaze. After this time, 
an administrative warrant is needed, as established in 
Michigan v. Tyler (1978).
Guidelines on the current legal status of searches con-
ducted during ﬁ re investigations include the following: 
• • Warrants are not required when an authorized indi-
vidual consents to the search. Th e consent must be 
written and must specify the areas to be searched and 
the purpose of the search. Th is consent can be revoked 
at any time.
EVIDENCE ON A SUSPECT, AT A RESIDENCE 
OR IN A VEHICLE
If you have a suspect, look for any burns he or she may 
have received while setting the ﬁ re. Th e suspect may have 
scorched hair, torn clothing, stains, cuts and other inju-
ries, or his or her clothing or shoes may have traces of 
accelerants. Th e suspect’s residence or vehicle may contain 
clothes noticed at the ﬁ re by a witness, objects removed 
from the scene of the ﬁ re or incendiary devices. You may 
also ﬁ nd insurance documents or business or ﬁ nancial 
records that provide a motive.
OBSERVING UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
Suspicious circumstances implying arson include sud-
denly emptied premises, the presence of materials not 
normally part of the business, holes in wall plaster or 
drywall that expose the wood, disconnected sprinkler sys-
tems, blocked-open interior doors, nailed-open ﬁ re doors 
and other alterations that would provide more air, heat or 
fuel to the area.
INTERVIEWING THE VICTIM, WITNESSES AND 
FIREFIGHTERS
Ask questions such as, How was the ﬁ re discovered? Who 
discovered it? Who were witnesses? What did they see? 
What color was the smoke, and where was it coming 
from? What direction was the wind? Did the ﬁ re appear 
to suddenly accelerate? Did anything out of the ordinary 
occur before the ﬁ re? Were there unusual odors? Were 
the shades up or down? Did obstructions prevent seeing 
into the building? Were suspicious persons or vehicles 
observed at the scene before, during or after the ﬁ re?
Also try to learn who had an opportunity to set the 
ﬁ re and who might beneﬁ t from it. Determine who had 
keys and how the property was normally guarded or pro-
tected. Check the victim’s ﬁ nancial status and ﬁ nd out 
how much insurance was carried on the property. Inter-
view the ﬁ reﬁ ghters assigned to the ﬁ re and obtain copies 
of their reports.
SEARCH WARRANTS AND FIRE 
INVESTIGATIONS
The U.S. Supreme Court requires a two-step war-
rant process for investigating ﬁ res involving 
crimes. Th e initial search may require an administrative

PROSECUTING ARSONISTS
Some studies indicate that considerably more than 
90 percent of arsonists go unpunished, probably 
because arson is most often committed without the beneﬁ t 
of witnesses. According to the International Association of 
Arson Investigators, approximately 25 percent of all ﬁ res in 
the United States—about 500,000 per year—result from 
arson, but only about 2 percent of all arsonists are ever 
arrested and convicted for their crimes.
Th e diﬃ  culty of investigating arson has been discussed, as 
has the need for cooperation between law enforcement inves-
tigators and ﬁ reﬁ ghters. Equally diﬃ  cult is prosecution. Th ere 
is a big diﬀ erence between proving a ﬁ re as arson and proving 
arson in court. Cooperative investigation and prosecution are 
required if the losses from arson are to be stemmed.
Many prosecutors fail to bring charges because all 
they have is circumstantial evidence. However, circum-
stantial evidence can be used to successfully prosecute a 
case. Look for evidence of planning, such as increasing 
insurance coverage, removing items or making oﬀ hand 
remarks or unusual changes. Also look for evidence of dis-
abled or turned-oﬀ  alarms or sprinkler systems and doors 
left open. Finally, look for evidence of motive.
PREVENTING ARSON
To prevent arson, various properties at risk of 
being set on ﬁ re might be identiﬁ ed by com-
puter mapping. In some instances, crime analysis has deter-
mined that most properties that had experienced arson 
were either abandoned or vacant properties located near or 
adjacent to notably high crime locations. In one instance, 
six key factors were merged into one master map: (1) aban-
doned properties, (2) negative-equity properties, (3) prop-
erties whose gas or electric utilities were shut oﬀ , (4) sites 
of prior-year ﬁ res, (5) gang locales and (6) known drug hot 
spot locations. With accurate predictions, oﬃ  cers can be 
stationed close to and be more observant of targeted zones.
INVESTIGATING BOMBINGS 
AND EXPLOSIONS
It seems hardly a week passes that the media 
doesn’t report on a bombing incident having 
occurred somewhere around the globe, often with 
• • Warrants are not required when investigators enter 
under “exigent circumstances,” that is, if investiga-
tors enter the premises while ﬁ reﬁ ghters are extin-
guishing the blaze or conducting overhaul. Th e scope 
of the search must be limited to determining the 
cause and origin. If evidence of a crime is discov-
ered, a criminal warrant is required to continue the 
search.
• • Without consent or an exigency, warrants are required 
if the premises are subject to a “reasonable expecta-
tion of privacy.” Th is includes commercial businesses 
as well as private residences. Exceptions would be 
premises that are so utterly devastated by the ﬁ re that 
no expectation of privacy is reasonable and property 
that has been abandoned.
• • Evidence of a crime discovered during an administra-
tive search may be seized if in plain view.
• • Once evidence of arson is discovered, the ﬁ re’s cause 
and origin are assumed to be known. Th e scope of the 
administrative warrant has been exhausted. A crimi-
nal warrant is required to continue the search.
When in doubt, obtain a warrant.
INVESTIGATING VEHICLE 
ARSON
Although vehicle ﬁ res can be caused by accident, 
vehicles usually do not burn readily. Acceler-
ants are used on many vehicles to accomplish arson. A 
quart to a half-gallon of ﬂ ammable liquid is required to 
cause a major vehicle ﬁ re.
When investigating vehicle ﬁ res, look for evidence of 
accelerants and determine whether the vehicle was 
insured. It is seldom arson if there was no insurance.
Motives for vehicle arson include the desire to col-
lect insurance, inability to make needed repairs after an 
unreported accident, desire to eliminate a loan on the 
vehicle, desire to cover up another crime committed in or 
with the vehicle, general dissatisfaction with the vehicle’s 
performance and desire to resolve arguments over the 
vehicle’s use.
A close correlation exists between insurance cover-
age and vehicle arson. Obtain proof that the vehicle was 
insured against ﬁ re, that the ﬁ re was willfully set, that 
damage resulted and that there was intent to defraud.

CHAPTER 16 | Arson, Bombs and Explosives | 489
Terrorists have long used cellular phones to trigger 
IEDs. Cell phones have just the right power, have time 
synchronization capabilities, have an accurate alarm clock 
function, include a vibration circuit, allow for worldwide 
usage and are extremely diﬃ  cult if not impossible to track, 
especially if they’re disposable (Miller, 2006, p.88). 
A homemade explosive known as “TATP”—triacetone 
triperoxide—is the explosive that Richard Reid, the “shoe 
bomber” carried aboard American Airlines Flight 63 from 
Paris to Miami in 2001. TATP is composed of acetone, 
hydrogen peroxide and an acid, even a can of Coke. Th e 
ingredients can easily be bought for about $17 at any hard-
ware or home improvement store or online. Th e explosive 
concoction is virtually undetectable and quite easy to get 
past security, although new restrictions on carry-on liq-
uids may make it more diﬃ  cult to get the requisite mate-
rials through security checkpoints (Moore, 2007, p.210).
Th e threat of liquid explosives is of great concern, 
especially to airlines, as the aircraft environment requires 
very little explosive force because of the already pressur-
ized cabin. Th us, law enforcement should be familiar with 
several types of liquid and gel explosives, some of which 
are very volatile (Morgenstern, 2007). Even picking up 
a bottle of nitroglycerine and shaking it could cause an 
explosion.
Bombers sometimes take their explosives one step 
further, creating a weapon known as the vehicle-born 
improvised explosive device (VBIED), or the “car bomb”: 
“Bad guys have transformed all types of wheeled convey-
ances from pushcarts and bicycles to cement trucks and 
tractor-trailers, into bombs” (Gundy and Linett, 2007, 
p.38). Furthermore, “Th ere has been a distinct increase 
in the use of creative and sophisticated attack methods, 
such as multiple VBIEDs, combined attacks (assault teams 
used in conjunction with VBIEDs), secondary devices, and 
deceptive delivery tactics” (p.40).
Numerous Web sites give detailed instructions on how 
to make bombs, especially pipe bombs. For example, the 
Linkbase Web site oﬀ ers the following links: homemade 
explosives, high explosives, how to make a detonator, how 
to make a pipe bomb, how to make a smoke bomb, how to 
make a grenade, how to make a time bomb and the like. 
Th e instructions are only two pages long, and all the mate-
rials needed are readily available.
Bombs, more than any other weapon, make people feel 
vulnerable. Unlike a gun, a bomb does not have to be aimed. 
Unlike poison, it does not have to be administered. Bombs 
are weapons of chance. Victims are simply in the wrong 
place at the wrong time. For example, the 1993 World Trade 
 Center bombing in New York resulted in six dead, more than 
a thousand injured and millions of dollars in property dam-
age. Th e 1995 bombing at the Murrah Federal Building in 
Oklahoma City claimed 169 lives, caused nearly 500 injuries 
signiﬁ cant casualties. Bombs have become a high-proﬁ le, 
almost routine, weapon of mass destruction. Bombs gen-
erate substantial media attention and provide an imper-
sonal means of causing considerable damage, while either 
allowing bombers to be a safe distance away when detona-
tion occurs or enabling suicide bombers to achieve martyr-
dom and incite other holy warriors to follow in their path. 
As noted, this emphasis on explosives was reﬂ ected in the 
addition of “and explosives” to the ATF’s name in 2003.
Too often oﬃ  cers respond to these calls with a blasé 
approach—one that could get them killed: “It is a routine 
call for a street cop to be dispatched to a suspect pack-
age, unattended bag or suspicious item. . . . Th ese calls are 
some of the most routine, yet potentially lethal, a patrol 
oﬃ  cer can ever deal with” (Dowle, 2006, p.28).
Most explosive incidents in this country fall into one 
of ﬁ ve classes (Laska, 2008, p.40):
 1. Juvenile/experimentation
 2. Recovered military ordnance or commercial explosives
 3. Emotionally disturbed persons
 4. Criminal actions
 5. Terrorist or extremist activity
Motives for bombings include vandalism, revenge 
and protest. Bombs are relatively easy to build from direc-
tions that can be found on the Internet. Th e following are 
common types of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or 
homemade bombs:
• • Dry ice. Combines dry ice and some water in a 2-liter 
plastic soda bottle. Depending on the condition of the 
bottle, the amount of ice and the weather, the device 
will explode in 3 to 7 minutes, causing a dangerous, 
loud explosion.
• • Mailbox bomb. Combines a bit of sugar and some water 
in a 2-liter bottle of chlorine. Th e explosion can launch 
an average mailbox 20 feet into the air.
• • Car bomb. A fuse is wrapped around a car’s exhaust 
manifold. Th e fuse is ignited by the heat of the mani-
fold, detonating the explosion.
• • Nail bomb. An explosive device packed with nails 
to increase destructive power when detonated in 
crowded places. Th e July 7, 2005, explosion in London 
atop a double-decker bus near Shoreditch was thought 
to be this type of bomb.
• • Pipe bomb. Consists of pipe, end caps and smokeless 
powder, detonated by a spark or some heat source. 
Common containers are pipes, bottles, cans, boxes, 
pressurized cartridges and grenade hulls. A pipe bomb 
laced with nails and other hardware to increase frag-
mentation caused two deaths in Atlanta’s Centennial 
Park bombing.

490 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
Management should assist ﬁ rst responders in devising 
a thorough search of the building using employees to help 
in the search because employees will know if anything is 
out of place and “doesn’t ﬁ t.” Management will also decide 
if the building is to be evacuated after the search.
Searchers pay attention to unattended bags, boxes or 
briefcases as well as areas with suspended ceilings with 
panels that are easily pushed up to hide an IED. Other 
items to pay attention to are trash cans, ashtrays and 
ﬂ owerpots. In addition, any incoming mail or packages 
should be carefully screened. 
If a bomb is found, the most important rule in han-
dling suspect packages is to NOT TOUCH the package. 
Th e area should be cleared to a 300-foot radius. Emer-
gency personnel (ﬁ re and emergency medical personnel) 
should be alerted. All radios should be turned oﬀ . If there 
has been an explosion, investigators should
• • Ensure that a search for secondary explosive devices 
has been conducted.
• • Ensure that the scene has been secured, that a perim-
eter and staging areas for the investigation have been 
established and that all personnel have been advised 
of the need to prevent contaminating the scene.
• • Ensure that the chain of custody is initiated for evi-
dence that may have been previously collected.
• • Establish procedures to document personnel entering 
and exiting the scene.
• • Establish and document procedures for evidence col-
lection, control and chain of custody. Th roughout the 
investigation, safety should be of prime concern 
(A Guide for Explosion, 2000, pp.19–21).
USING K-9S IN DETECTING EXPLOSIVES
As with arson investigations, dogs have become increasingly 
useful in bomb detection and in searches for evidence follow-
ing explosions: “Field deployable electronic sensors or instru-
ments can’t top dogs, which have been increasingly in demand 
since 9/11. Canines are still our best detection technology” 
(Kanable, 2007, p.68). Following the precaution of not han-
dling the explosive, bomb dogs are trained to alert the handler 
by sitting near a suspect package without touching it. 
USING STATIONARY TECHNOLOGY IN 
DETECTING EXPLOSIVES
Airports and cargo terminals use X-ray and computed 
axial tomography (CAT) equipment to scan large numbers 
of items and people. Such methods require highly trained 
operators, are stationary and cannot readily be used on 
vehicles or individuals or to investigate where bomb-making 
and resulted in losses of $651 million. Bomber Timothy 
McVeigh was found guilty of the crime and executed. And, 
the explosions in 2001 at the World Trade Center and the 
Pentagon resulted in thousands of deaths. Terrorist acts are 
discussed in Chapter 20.
National attention also focused on the Unabomber 
case. Th eodore Kaczynski, a Montana hermit who hated our 
technological society, expressed his social criticism through 
a campaign of bombing between 1978 and 1995. During 
this interval, his 16 separate bombs killed 3 people and 
injured 23 others. After 18 years of investigation, Kaczyn-
ski was arrested, found guilty and sentenced to life in prison 
without possibility of release. Evidence found in Kaczynski’s 
cabin included scrap metal and wood, batteries and electric 
wire, 10 three-ring binders ﬁ lled with writings and dia-
grams about constructing and concealing explosive devices 
and two manual typewriters that investigators believe 
 Kaczynski used to type his “Unabomber Manifesto.”
In the late 1990s, Eric Rudolph used nail-laden bombs 
during the Atlanta summer Olympics as well as at abor-
tion clinics and at nightclubs catering to a mostly gay and 
lesbian clientele. His 11-page statement was devoid of 
remorse but rife with anti-abortion and anti-gay rhetoric. 
Th e attack at the Olympics was meant to embarrass the 
government for legalizing abortion.
In 2002, Luke Helder, age 21 at the time, left a trail 
of 18 pipe bombs in rural mailboxes in Illinois, Iowa, 
Nebraska, Texas and Colorado. Th e bombs were accom-
panied by typewritten notes in clear plastic bags indicat-
ing the bomber wanted to get people’s attention. Six of 
the bombs exploded, injuring four letter carriers and two 
residents, but no one was killed. Law enforcement pulled 
Helder over three times during the course of his 1,500-mile 
journey in which he attempted to create a “smiley face” pat-
tern of mailbox bombings. He was stopped in Nebraska 
and given a speeding ticket. He was stopped in Oklahoma 
for driving without a seatbelt. And he was stopped in Colo-
rado for speeding. Within 48 hours of these three encoun-
ters, Helder was arrested on bombing charges after his 
cell-phone calls were traced. Th e FBI was the lead agency in 
investigating these bombings and in apprehending Helder.
RESPONDING TO A BOMB 
THREAT
Special safety precautions must be taken when 
responding to a bomb threat. Th e International 
Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) has developed detailed 
bomb threat instructions to be kept near telephones where 
such a threat might be received (Figure 16.1).

CHAPTER 16 | Arson, Bombs and Explosives | 491
activities are ongoing or have taken place. Because of this, 
law enforcement must rely on what is referred to as “sniﬀ er” 
technology: “A sniﬀ er detection device is an instrument 
that takes in a sample of air, processes it through a detector 
and then identiﬁ es and calculates the approximate quanti-
ties of explosive material in the air sample.”

located three blocks from the blast site, so the scene 
parameters were approximately four and a half blocks in 
all directions.
RAISING AWARENESS
Awareness training programs should teach employees 
to notice individuals wearing clothes unsuitable for the 
time of year, people trying to blend into a group that he 
or she clearly doesn’t belong to or an object protruding 
from a person’s clothing. Other behaviors to watch for are 
people acting very nervous or perspiring profusely, some-
one obviously staying clear of security personnel, a person 
of an explosive to make it safe (Cox, 2004, p.106). Other 
features of bomb robots include portable X-ray machines 
and devices to remotely cut open a car door. 
INVESTIGATING BOMB 
EXPLOSIONS
When investigating explosions and bombings, pay special 
attention to fragments of the explosive device as well as 
to powder present at the scene. Determine motive.
Bomb-scene investigations must progress logi-
cally. Th e ﬁ rst step is to determine the scene’s 
parameters. In general, once the farthest piece of recog-
nizable evidence is located, a radius 50 percent wider is 
established. For example, in the Oklahoma City bombing, 
the rear axle of the truck carrying the explosives was 
Technology Innovations
Ashley (2008, p.32) describes the latest genera-
tion of robots being used by law enforcement:
The basic idea of a robot is to use a piece of 
technology—an automated capability—in an 
arena that might be dangerous or inhospitable to 
a person. Enhanced surveillance capability is yet 
another service robots can provide, particularly in 
areas that are unsafe or difﬁ cult to reach. Through 
the use of cameras and microphones, as well as 
wireless communications, critical intelligence can 
be gathered without exposing ofﬁ cers.
Another robot, the Negotiator Tactical 
Surveillance Robot, can be controlled wirelessly or 
by tether (Kozlowski, 2007, pp.124–129).
The plug-and-play architecture connects virtually 
any peripheral device (sensors, detectors, external 
devices, etc.) through a port located in the robot’s 
cargo area, then transmits that peripheral’s data 
to the operator control unit (OCU). The 8-pound, 
handheld OCU can be substituted for a wearable 
heads-up-display (HUD). With the HUD, the opera-
tor is able to view what the Negotiator’s cameras 
see through a goggled view instead of on the OCU’s 
screen.
The Negotiator robot’s single joystick and 
push-button operation is another intuitive aspect of 
the package. The Negotiator’s controlling joystick 
is directionally related to the direction of the robot. 
The robot’s speed is directly proportional in that 
the throw of the joystick determines how fast or 
slow the robot will move.
Technology Innovations
Page (2007, p.130) describes a stand-off bomb 
detection device being developed at Kansas State 
University (KSU):
The KSU device uses pulses of both gamma and 
neutron radiation that penetrate into the target. The 
return signal, to a large extent, is determined by 
what is inside.
Rather than try to completely identify the 
contents of a random target or to create a detailed 
image, we are simply trying to see if the contents 
emit “signatures” that are typical of explosives. 
In the amount of time it requires to take a breath, 
this technology can sniff the surface of a piece 
of luggage and determine whether a hazardous 
substance is likely to be inside. A yes/no result is 
displayed within 1 to 10 seconds—considerably 
faster than bomb dogs, long the standard of mili-
tary and law enforcement. It takes bomb dogs 
about 5 minutes to work a vehicle, snifﬁ ng tires, 
doors, trunks and hoods. The device would make 
it possible to screen 100 percent of passengers for 
explosives, instead of the random samples TSA 
screeners now obtain.

killed the driver of a vehicle to which a bomb had been 
attached. Th e Rialto Police Department, the San Bernar-
dino Sheriﬀ ’s Oﬃ  ce and the ATF combined their eﬀ orts. 
Th ey investigated and forwarded evidence from the scene 
to the ATF laboratory for examination. Chemists identi-
ﬁ ed the type and brand of powder used in the bomb by 
examining intact powder particles found in the bomb’s 
end caps. A subsequent search at the suspect’s home 
uncovered a can of smokeless powder identical to the 
identiﬁ ed powder. Additional evidence obtained during 
the search provided further links between the suspect 
and the bombing. Th e suspect was arrested and charged 
with murder.
Investigators with technical questions about commer-
cial explosives can receive assistance from the Institute of 
Makers of Explosives (IME) in Washington, DC. Th is non-
proﬁ t safety organization has 31 member companies and 
more than 80 subsidiaries and aﬃ  liates, which together 
produce more than 85 percent of the commercial explo-
sives used in the United States. Also of help is the ATF 
National Response Team (NRT), which can be deployed in 
the most urgent, diﬃ  cult bomb cases.

IMPORTANCE OF THE TEAM APPROACH
Th e teamwork of ﬁ eld investigators and laboratory spe-
cialists in investigating bombings is critical. Such team-
work followed a California pipe-bombing incident that 
Using a remote-controlled robot to approach and analyze suspected 
bombs has the advantage of not risking lives. (© 911 Pictures)

494 | SECTION 4 | Investigating Crimes against Property
Fires normally burn upward and are drawn toward venti-
lation and follow fuel. Arson is likely in ﬁ res that
• • Have more than one point of origin.
• • Deviate from normal burning patterns.
• • Show evidence of trailers.
• • Show evidence of having been accelerated.
• • Produce odors or smoke of a color associated with 
substances not normally present at the scene.
• • Indicate that an abnormal amount of air, fuel or heat 
was present.
• • Reveal evidence of incendiary igniters at the point of 
origin.
 
An administrative warrant is issued when it is necessary 
for a government agent to search the premises to determine 
the ﬁ re’s cause and origin. A criminal warrant is issued on 
probable cause when the premises yield evidence of a crime. 
Entry to ﬁ ght a ﬁ re requires no warrant. Once in the build-
ing, ﬁ re oﬃ  cials may remain a reasonable time to investigate 
the cause of the blaze. After this time, an administrative 
warrant is needed, as established in Michigan v. Tyler.
 
When investigating vehicle ﬁ res, look for evidence 
of accelerants and determine whether the vehicle was 
insured. It is seldom arson if there is no insurance. When 
investigating explosions and bombings, pay special atten-
tion to fragments of the explosive device as well as to 
powder present at the scene. Determine motive.
CHECKLIST
Arson
• • Who ﬁ rst noticed the ﬁ re?
• • Who notiﬁ ed authorities?
• • Who responded from the ﬁ re department?
• • Did the ﬁ re department record the color of the 
smoke? the color of the ﬂ ame?
• • What was the ﬁ re’s point of origin? Was there more 
than one point of origin?
• • What material was used to ignite the ﬁ re?
• • Was there an explosion before the ﬁ re? during the 
ﬁ re? after the ﬁ re?
• • How did the building explode: inward or outward?
• • Was the ﬁ re’s burn time normal? Did it appear to be 
accelerated?
• • Were any accelerants (newspapers, rags or gasoline) 
found at the scene?
• • What was the weather: dry, windy, snowy?
• • What property was destroyed that was unusual for the 
premises?
Fires are classiﬁ ed as natural, accidental, criminal (arson), 
suspicious or of unknown origin. Th ey are presumed to be 
natural or accidental unless proven otherwise.
 
Th e elements of the crime of arson include (1) the 
willful, malicious burning of a building or property (2) of 
another or of one’s own to defraud (3) or causing to be 
burned, or aiding, counseling or procuring such burning. 
Attempted arson is also a crime. Some states categorize 
arson as either aggravated or simple. Aggravated arson is 
intentionally destroying or damaging a dwelling or other 
property by means of ﬁ re or explosives, creating an immi-
nent danger to life or great bodily harm, which risk was 
known or reasonably foreseeable to the suspect.
 
Simple arson is intentional destruction by ﬁ re or 
explosives that does not create imminent danger to life 
or risk of great bodily harm. Other states use the Model 
Arson Law, which divides arson into four degrees: First-
degree involves the burning of dwellings; second-degree 
involves the burning of buildings other than dwellings; 
third-degree involves the burning of other property; and 
fourth-degree involves attempts to burn buildings or 
property.
 
Logic suggests that ﬁ re departments should detect 
arson and determine the point of origin and probable 
cause, whereas police departments should investigate 
arson and prepare cases for prosecution.
 
Special challenges in investigating arson include 
coordinating eﬀ orts with the ﬁ re department and others, 
determining whether a crime has been committed, ﬁ nding 
physical evidence and witnesses and determining whether 
the victim is a suspect.
 
Although the ﬁ re department is responsible for 
establishing whether arson has occurred, law enforce-
ment investigators must be able to verify such ﬁ ndings. 
To do so requires understanding the distinction between 
an accidental ﬁ re and arson. Basic to this understand-
ing is the concept of the ﬁ re triangle, which consists of 
three elements necessary for a substance to burn: air, 
fuel and heat. In arson, at least one of these elements 
is usually present in abnormal amounts for the struc-
ture. Evidence of accelerants at an arson scene is a pri-
mary form of evidence. Th e most common accelerant is 
gasoline. Also important as evidence are igniters, which 
include matches; candles; cigars and cigarettes; cigarette 
lighters; electrical, mechanical and chemical devices; and 
explosives.
 
Burn indicators that provide important information 
include alligatoring, crazing, depth of char, lines of demar-
cation, sagged furniture springs and spalling. Th e point of 
origin is established by ﬁ nding the area with the deepest 
char, alligatoring and (usually) the greatest destruction. 
SUMMARY

CHAPTER 16 | Arson, Bombs and Explosives | 495
minutes later at a small, one-story frame house and pulled 
in behind the ﬁ rst ﬁ re rig. Orange ﬂ ames were shooting 
from every window of the house.
 
While the ﬁ reﬁ ghters fought the blaze, McNeil and 
Joyce walked among the bystanders, asking if anyone 
had seen anything suspicious before the ﬁ re, but no 
one had. When the ﬁ re was out and the smoke cleared, 
ﬂ oodlights illuminated the house and McNeil and Joyce 
started their investigation. Beginning in the small 
front room, they noticed extensive burning and win-
dows totally blackened from the ﬁ re. Th ey proceeded 
through a small alcove, where the top portion had been 
destroyed, and then entered the kitchen. Th e glass in a 
window over the kitchen sink had broken and melted, 
with a series of intricate cracks running through each 
fragment. After shoveling out layers of debris and drag-
ging in a ﬁ re hose to wash the ﬂ oor, McNeil and Joyce 
noticed that the ﬂ oor was deeply charred and spongy 
with water. Inspection of the wooden cabinets around 
the sink revealed large, rolling blisters. Th e investiga-
tors also discovered that the electricity to the structure 
had been disconnected. Th en they began to photograph 
the ﬁ re scene.
 
Shortly afterward, the owner and his wife arrived. 
Th e owner calmly answered questions, informing the 
investigators that he had been letting a carpenter live in 
the house in exchange for ﬁ xing up the place. But when 
the tenant failed to make the repairs and instead stole 
the construction materials, much of the furniture and 
many appliances, the owner kicked him out. Th e carpen-
ter threatened to “make him sorry.” Th e owner had no 
ﬁ re insurance because he had intended not to live in the 
house but to use it as an investment property.
 
After ﬁ ling their report, McNeil and Joyce returned 
to the property at 4 A.M. A heavy rain the day before had 
soaked the ground, and the mud in the backyard was criss-
crossed with footprints. Joyce noticed some boot prints 
leading from the back door and took a plaster cast of 
them. Just then, a neighbor stopped over to say he had 
seen a green pickup parked behind the house with the 
motor running just before the ﬁ re. McNeil photographed 
all the tire tracks in the dirt alley where the pickup was 
reportedly parked. Th e next morning the investigators 
learned that the carpenter, now their prime suspect, had 
been in jail when the ﬁ re broke out. Th e green pickup was 
registered to a friend of his, a man who had been previ-
ously arrested for arson.
 
Th ey obtained a search warrant and executed it later 
that morning. Th e tires of the carpenter’s friend’s truck 
and his boot soles resembled the impressions found at the 
ﬁ re scene, but the impressions were so spongy that it was 
diﬃ  cult to match them exactly. Th e investigators found 
• • Were there any unusual circumstances?
• • Was anyone injured or killed? Was an autopsy done to 
determine whether there were other causes for death 
than ﬁ re? Were carbon monoxide tests made of the 
victim to determine when death occurred—whether 
before or during the ﬁ re?
• • Were regular informants checked to determine pos-
sible suspects?
• • Who had access to the building?
• • What appeared to be the motive for the ﬁ re? Who 
would beneﬁ t?
• • Who owns the property destroyed? For how long?
• • Was there insurance and, if so, how much?
• • Who was the insurance payable to?
• • What is the name of the insurance company? Obtain a 
copy of the company’s report.
• • Does the owner have any record of other property 
destroyed by ﬁ re?
• • Does the owner have a criminal record for this or 
other types of crimes?
• • Were any suspicious people or vehicles observed at the 
scene before, during or after the ﬁ re?
• • Was the state ﬁ re marshal’s oﬃ  ce notiﬁ ed? Did it send 
an investigator? If so, obtain a copy of the investiga-
tor’s report.
• • Were photographs or videos taken? Are they 
available?
APPLICATION
A. It is mid-afternoon on a Sunday. Th e ﬁ re department 
has just received a call to proceed to the Methodist Church 
on St. Anthony Boulevard. Smoke has been reported com-
ing out of the church’s windows by a nearby resident. 
When the ﬁ re department arrives, the church is engulfed 
in ﬂ ames. By the time the ﬁ re is brought under control, 
the church is gutted, with damage estimated at $320,000. 
Suspecting arson, the ﬁ re department asks for help from 
the local police department.
Questions
 1. Was the request for assistance justiﬁ ed at this point?
 2. What are the responsibilities of the investigator 
assigned to respond to the call?
B. Investigators Ron McNeil and Brett Joyce worked 
together as part of Boston’s special arson task force. Just 
before midnight, they received a call from the dispatcher 
and were told to proceed to a certain address. Th ey arrived

Questions
1. Where did the ﬁ re probably originate? What factors 
indicate this?
 2. What indicated that the ﬁ re was probably arson?
 3. Did the investigators have probable cause to arrest 
the carpenter’s friend? Would the owner also be a 
possible suspect? Why or why not?
 4. What aspects of this case illustrate an eﬀ ective arson 
investigation?
 1. Do you agree that investigating arson cases is the 
joint responsibility of police and ﬁ re departments? 
Which department should be in charge?
 2. What are the respective roles of the police and ﬁ re 
departments in your community during an arson 
investigation?
 3. Arson has a low conviction rate. What factors make 
an arson investigation diﬃ  cult? What factors make

of arson? Where do you ﬁ nd such evidence at a ﬁ re 
scene? How do you collect it? Where do you send it 
for examination in your area?
 6. What are common motives for arson? How do these 
motives help an investigator locate suspects?
 7. Arson was added to the Part One Index crimes in the 
Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Is arson serious 
enough to be in this category along with murder and

he two preceding sections discussed inves-
tigating violent crimes and crimes against 
property. Many crimes do not fall neatly into one of the 
eight Index crimes reported in the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) but involve 
a combination of illegal acts related to both people and 
property. Unique investigative challenges are presented 
by investigating computers and cybercrime (Chapter 
17), drug-related and organized crime (Chapter 18), the 
criminal activities of gangs and other dangerous groups 
(Chapter 19) and the war against terrorism and ﬁ ght for 
homeland security (Chapter 20). Investigating the ille-
gal activities related to these groups is more difﬁ cult 
because the elements of the crimes are not neatly 
spelled out and statistics are not available as they are 
for the UCR crimes. A ﬁ nal and critical challenge is pre-
paring for and presenting cases in court (Chapter 21).
 
Cybercrime is relatively new, but organized crime, 
drug- and gang-related crime, bias and hate crime and 
ritualistic crime have existed in one form or another for 
centuries. Not until recently, however, have they had 
such an impact on law enforcement, straining already 
limited resources. A further complication is that the 
areas commonly overlap; people involved in organized 
T
OTHER CHALLENGES TO THE 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR

crime, drugs and gangs are often the same people—
but not necessarily. Terrorists fund their activities 
through drug sales and various types of fraud, including 
cybertheft. Although each type of crime is discussed 
separately, always keep this overlap in mind. Further-
more, moral and ethical issues are raised by the activi-
ties of these organizations that are not raised by the 
activities of, say, bank robbers, rapists and murderers. 
Stealing, raping and murdering are clearly wrong in our 
society. This is not necessarily true for gambling, wor-
shiping Satan or smoking pot.
 
Among the greatest challenges are the “wars” 
America finds itself in, not only against drugs but 
now also against terrorism. Homeland defense has 
become a priority for law enforcement agencies 
at all levels. Other great challenges for investiga-
tors are preparing final reports the prosecutor can 
use to bring criminal cases to trial and presenting 
effective testimony to bring these cases to success-
ful resolution. Without these skills, the best investi-
gations are futile.

took to discover the embezzlement. Ironically, rather than 
being dismissed, the two embezzlers were promoted and 
placed in charge of computer security.
 
In another instance, a New York bank hired an outside 
consultant to work with its computer technicians on trans-
ferring funds electronically. During his work, the consultant 
observed the access code being used to transfer the funds. He 
later used this access code to transfer a large sum of money 
to his own bank account. When the loss was ﬁ nally discov-
ered, management insisted that everyone in the section take 
a polygraph test, including the consultant. All except the 
consultant complied, and all passed. Although management 
was convinced the consultant had stolen the money, they 
did not prosecute. Th ey simply changed their access code.
 
Th ese cases illustrate two key characteristics of com-
puter crimes.
• • Computer crimes are relatively easy to commit and 
difﬁ cult to detect.
• • Most computer crimes are not prosecuted.
 
Computers are pervasive in the home, workplace and 
school. At the end of 2006, CTIA–Th e Wireless Association 
reported 233 million U.S. wireless subscribers, more than 
76 percent of the total U.S. population (Kanable, 2007, 
p.16). Before the mid-1990s, computer crime was almost 
nonexistent. Computer crime typically involved actions 
performed on a single machine or on a small self-contained 
network of machines, such as stealing data oﬀ  a hard drive 
or planting a malicious code within the software of a com-
pany’s internal computer network. Whatever the speciﬁ cs 
of the crime, the criminal had to come in close physical 
contact with the computer(s) and the crime scene.
 
In the last decade, however, crimes involving com-
puters have become much more sophisticated, and 
investigating such crimes considerably more complicated. 
What makes cybercrime the tremendous problem it is 
today is that most computers on the planet are connected 
via the Internet, allowing a criminal thousands of miles 
away from a crime scene—whether at a computer in a pri-
vate residence or at an extensive database within a major 
corporation’s mainframe—to carry out theft, fraud, van-
dalism or any other number of crimes without ever setting 
foot in the same city, state, country or even continent as 
the victim. Th e Internet also provides a medium through 
which pedophiles access and exchange child pornography, 
stalkers harass and threaten their targets and terrorists 
around the globe communicate with each other. Keep-
ing up with these techno-savvy criminals has pushed law 
enforcement to develop a new breed of detective—the 
cybercrime investigator.
THE SCOPE AND COST 
OF THE PROBLEM
The current hot crime tool is a personal com-
puter linked to the Internet. Th is online ele-
ment has led to a fundamental change in how many law 
enforcement agencies refer to such oﬀ enses—from com-
puter crime to cybercrime. It should come as no surprise 
that criminals are capitalizing on this technology. 
Numerous online communication options are available, 
such as e-mail, chat rooms and Web pages.
 
Th e Internet’s capacity for global interconnectivity has 
made the scope of the cybercrime problem transnational, 
the extent of which, confess most experts, is not yet fully 
understood. Adding to the uncertainty of the extent of the 
problem is that a large percentage of police departments 
do not yet know how to address this threat and do not keep 
accurate records involving such incidents. What is known, 
however, is that cybercrime has touched countless individ-
uals and businesses throughout the United States and has 
the potential to cause a national disaster: “Cybercrime has

signiﬁ cant economic impacts and threatens U.S. national 
security interests. Various studies and experts estimate 
the direct economic impact from cybercrime to be in the 
billions of dollars annually” (“Cybercrime,” 2007).
 
Individuals can be victimized by a variety of diﬀ erent 
cybercrimes. For example, data from the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) show that each year nearly 9 million 
people are victims of identity theft, many of whom had 
information stolen from cyberspace. Internet scams con-
tinue to strip unsuspecting consumers of millions of dol-
lars every year, along with their faith in the security of 
doing business online. Th ree other sources of information 
on the scope and cost of computer crime are the Internet 
Crime Complaint Center, the E-Crime Watch Survey and 
the CSI Computer Crime and Security Survey.
THE IC3 2007 INTERNET CRIME REPORT
Th e Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), formerly 
called the Internet Fraud Complaint Center, is a partner-
ship between the FBI and the National White Collar Crime 
Center (NW3C) designed to serve as a clearinghouse for 
cybercrime data for law enforcement and regulatory agen-
cies at the federal, state and local levels. Th e IC3 receives 
a broad spectrum of complaints including online fraud, 
computer intrusions (hacking), breaches of intellectual 
property rights (IPR), online extortion, international 
money laundering, economic espionage (theft of trade 
secrets) and, of course, identity theft. Th e proliferation of 
child pornography on the Internet has also become a seri-
ous concern, as thousands of young individuals are vic-
timized every year by this type of exploitation.
 
According to the 2007 Internet Crime Report (2008), 
the IC3 received 206,884 complaints in 2007, leading to 
a reported dollar loss of nearly $240 million, an all-time 
high. More than 90,000 were referred to law enforcement. 
Among the 2007 top ten complaint categories, Internet 
auction fraud was by far the most reported oﬀ ense, com-
prising 35.7 percent of referred crime complaints. In addi-
tion, nondelivery of merchandise or payment represented 
24.9 percent of complaints. Conﬁ dence fraud made up an 
additional 6.7 percent. Credit and debit card fraud, check 
fraud and computer fraud complaints represented 17.6 
percent of all referred complaints. Other complaint cat-
egories such as identity theft, ﬁ nancial institutions fraud, 
threats and Nigerian letter fraud complaints together rep-
resented less than 8.3 percent of all complaints. Th e report 
also identiﬁ ed the top scams of 2007: scams involving 
pets, checks, spam and online dating sites. Of the top ten 
countries reporting, the United States ranked ﬁ rst at 63.2 
percent, followed by the United Kingdom at 15.3 percent.
 
Most perpetrators contacted their victims by e-mail 
(32.7 percent) followed by Web page (18.0 percent), 
telephone (11.5 percent) and Instant Messenger (10.1 
percent). Less common contact methods included physi-
cal mail, wire, bulletin board, fax, chat rooms, in person 
and newsgroups. Th e report concludes with best practices 
to prevent Internet crime, discussed later in the chapter.
THE 2007 E-CRIME WATCH SURVEY
Th e E-Crime Watch Survey is conducted jointly by the 
U.S. Secret Service, Carnegie Mellon University Software 
Engineering Institute’s CERT® Program and Microsoft 
Corporation. Th e fourth annual survey (2007) reported 
that 57 percent of participants said they are increasingly 
concerned about the potential eﬀ ects of e-crime, and 
49 percent reported experiencing an increase in e-crime 
during 2006 compared with the prior year.
 
Th e survey found no major changes in e-crimes being 
perpetrated by outsiders, although there were marked jumps 
in the illegal generation of spam e-mail (53 percent in 2006 
vs. 40 percent in 2005) and phishing attacks (46 percent vs. 
31 percent). Th e top e-crimes reported were virus, worms or 
other malicious code (experienced by 74 percent of respon-
dents); unauthorized access to/use of information, systems 
or networks (experienced by 55 percent); illegal generation 
of spam e-mail (experienced by 53 percent); spyware (not 
including adware—experienced by 52 percent); denial of 
service attacks (experienced by 49 percent); fraud (expe-
rienced by 46 percent); and phishing (also experienced by 
46 percent). 
 
Th e survey found that the most eﬀ ective technologies 
were stateful ﬁ rewalls (maintaining its position as #1 at 
82 percent), access controls (79 percent), electronic access 
controls (78 percent), application layer ﬁ rewalls (72 per-
cent) and host-based antivirus (70 percent). Th e least 
eﬀ ective technologies were manual patch management, 
surveillance, password complexity, badging and real-time 
blackhole list (RBL)–based spam ﬁ ltering. Table 17.1 
presents a breakdown of the types of electronic crimes 
reported in the 2007 E-Crime Watch Survey.
THE 2007 CSI COMPUTER CRIME AND 
SECURITY SURVEY
Since 1995, the Computer Security Institute (CSI), with 
the help of the FBI, has conducted annual surveys of com-
puter security practitioners in corporations, ﬁ nancial 
and medical institutions, universities and government 
agencies throughout the nation to analyze and assess the 
current state of computer network security. Richardson 
(2007, p.1) notes, “For the past ﬁ ve years, this survey—
perhaps the most widely quoted set of statistics in the 
industry—has shown a drop in average estimated losses 
due to cybercrime. Th is year, however, the tide has turned 

504 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
and respondents have reported a signiﬁ cant upswing.” 
Key ﬁ ndings of this survey include
• • Th e average annual loss shot up to $350,424, from 
$168,000 the previous year. Not since the 2004 report 
have average losses been this high.
• • Almost one-ﬁ fth (18 percent) of those respondents 
who suﬀ ered one or more kinds of security incident 
further said they’d suﬀ ered a “targeted attack,” 
deﬁ ned as a malware attack aimed exclusively at their 
organization or at organizations within a small subset 
of the general population.

• • Financial fraud overtook virus attacks as the source of 
the greatest ﬁ nancial losses. Virus losses, which had 
been the leading cause of loss for 7 straight years, fell 
to second place. Another signiﬁ cant cause of loss was 
system penetration by outsiders.
• • Insider abuse of network access or e-mail (such as traf-
ﬁ cking in pornography or pirated software) edged out 
virus incidents as the most prevalent security prob-
lem, with 59 and 52 percent of respondents reporting 
each respectively.
• • When asked generally whether they’d suﬀ ered a 
security incident, 46 percent said yes, down from 
53 percent last year and 56 percent the year before.
• • Th e percentage of organizations reporting computer 
intrusions to law enforcement continued upward after 
reversing a multiyear decline over the past 2 years, 
standing now at 29 percent as compared with 
25 percent in last year’s report.
 To fully understand and eﬀ ectively investigate computer 
crime, oﬃ  cers need a working knowledge of relevant ter-
minology, how documents are stored and retrieved and 
how access to the Internet (and others’ ﬁ les) is obtained.
TERMINOLOGY AND 
DEFINITIONS
The FBI previously deﬁ ned computer crime as 
“that which involves the addition, deletion, 
change or theft of information.” However, as the Internet 
has become an increasingly common element among crimes 
committed via the computer, the FBI has refocused its eﬀ orts 
and created the Cyber Investigations unit. Cybercrime, as 
part of the larger category of computer crime, has been a 
challenge to deﬁ ne. Many crimes that involve computers 
could just as easily be committed using other methods.
 
During the past decade, reﬁ nements have occurred 
in how cybercrime is deﬁ ned. Although a single deﬁ ni-
tion has yet to be agreed on, an acceptable deﬁ nition is 
that cybercrime is part of the larger category of computer 
crime, a criminal act that is carried out using cybertech-
nology and takes place in cyberspace. Cybertechnology 
is the spectrum of computing and information/commu-
nication technologies, from individual computers to com-
puter networks to the Internet. Th e cyberrealm is more 
commonly called cyberspace, an intangible, virtual world 
existing in the network connections between two or more 
computers. Cybercrime has also been referred to as elec-
tronic crime, or e-crime, in describing any criminal viola-
tion in which a computer or electronic form of media is 
used. Also being used by experts in the ﬁ eld is the term 
e-crime.
 
Regardless of whether an agency calls such oﬀ enses 
computer crimes, cybercrimes or e-crimes, the eﬀ ective 
investigator must be familiar with basic computer termi-
nology as well as with terms speciﬁ cally related to com-
puter crime (additional terms are deﬁ ned throughout this 
chapter):
• • Adware. A type of spyware used by advertisers to 
gather consumer and marketing information.
• • Browser. A computer program that accesses and dis-
plays data from the World Wide Web, such as Internet 
Explorer.
• • Byte. Th e amount of space needed to store one charac-
ter of information.
• • Digital evidence. Information stored or transmitted in 
binary form that may be relied on in court.
• • Disk drive. Physical location of disks on a computer 
(internal hard drives are usually labeled as C drive; 
ﬂ oppy drives are generally identiﬁ ed as A or B drives). 
• • Electronic device. A device that operates on principles 
governing the behavior of electrons.
• • Electronic evidence. Information and data of inves-
tigative value that are stored in or transmitted by an 
electronic device.
• • Encryption. Any procedure used in cryptography to 
convert plain text into cipher-text to prevent anyone 
but the intended recipient from reading the data.
• • Firewall. A software or hardware protective measure 
that blocks ports of access to a computer or network 
to prevent unauthorized access and stop malicious 
programs from entering.
• • Floppy disk. Magnetic media capable of storing large 
amounts of information (a 3 1/2” disk can hold as 
much information as 470 sheets of paper). 
• • Gigabyte (GB). One billion bytes.
• • Hacktivism. Using cyberspace to harass or sabotage 
sites that conduct activities or advocate philosophies 
that “hacktivists” ﬁ nd unacceptable.
• • Imaging. Making a byte-by-byte copy of everything 
on the hard drive.
• • Keystroke logging. A diagnostic technique that cap-
tures a user’s keystrokes. Used in espionage to bypass 
security measures and obtain passwords or encryption 
keys. Also called keylogging.
• • Kilobyte (KB). One thousand bytes.
• • Logic bomb. Secretly attaches another program in a 
company’s computer system. Th e attached program 
monitors the input data and waits for an error to

THE NET VERSUS THE WEB
Confusion exists among many computer users regarding 
the diﬀ erences between the Internet (aka “the Net”) and 
the World Wide Web (aka “the Web”). Tim Berners-Lee 
(2005), creator of the Web, explains,
Th e Internet (’Net) is a network of networks. Basically 
it is made from computers and cables. . . . [It] sends 
around little “packets” of information. . . . A packet is 
a bit like a postcard with a simple address on it. If you 
put the right address on a packet, and gave it to any 
computer which is connected as part of the Net, each 
computer would ﬁ gure out which cable to send it down 
next so that it would get to its destination. Th at’s what 
the Internet does. It delivers packets—anywhere in the 
world, normally well under a second. . . .
 
Th e Web is an abstract (imaginary) space of infor-
mation. On the Net, you ﬁ nd computers—on the Web, 
you ﬁ nd document, sounds, videos . . . information. On 
the Net, the connections are cables between comput-
ers; on the Web, connections are hypertext links. Th e 
Web exists because of programs which communicate 
between computers on the Net. Th e Web could not be 
without the Net. Th e Web made the Net useful because 
people are really interested in information (not to 
mention knowledge and wisdom!) and don’t really 
want to . . . know about computers and cables.
 
A basic understanding of the Internet helps investiga-
tors trace suspected criminal activity and its perpetrators. 
To access the Internet, a user must have an Internet 
Protocol (IP) address, which is a unique number, analogous 
to a phone number (see Figure 17.1). Typically, there is only 
one IP address per network connection: “Just as every house 
has an address, every computer connected to the Internet has 
an address” (Investigations Involving the, 2007, p.5). A common 
analogy is to compare an IP address to an apartment address. 
IP addressing uses four decimal-separated numbers.
 
Th e IP address is commonly issued by a user’s Inter-
net Service Provider (ISP), a company that oﬀ ers access 
to the Internet for a fee, such as America Online (AOL), 
EarthLink, and NetZero. Th e details of IP address distri-
bution and registration are complex and not necessary to 
go into for a general understanding of cybercrime inves-
tigation. Th e importance lies in recognizing that an IP 
address and ISP, if known, can lead to a speciﬁ c computer 
and, by extension, a speciﬁ c user.
Deciphering E-mail and Web Addresses It is useful 
for investigators to understand the parts of an e-mail or 
Web address and to accurately refer to the individual ele-
ments of each. E-mail addresses typically have two parts: 
the e-mail name or ID and the e-mail domain, separated 
by @ (for example, janedoe@abc123.com).
occur. When this happens, the new program exploits 
the weakness to steal money or company secrets or to 
sabotage the system. For example, if a speciﬁ c name 
fails to appear in the payroll system, the logic bomb 
would delete the entire payroll database.
• • Malware. A contraction of “malicious software.” Soft-
ware developed to cause harm.
• • Megabyte (MB). One million bytes (a typical 240 MB 
hard drive could hold as much as 27 four-drawer ﬁ ling 
cabinets of information).
• • Network. A group of computers connected to one 
another to share information and resources.
• • Phreaking. Exploiting the telephone system’s vulner-
abilities to acquire free access and usage in a dial-up 
Internet provider system. Considered a type of 
electronic hacking.
• • Piracy. Copying and using computer programs in vio-
lation of copyrights and trade secret laws.
• • Port scanning. Looking for access (open “doors”) 
into a computer.
• • Script. A text ﬁ le containing a sequence of computer 
commands.
• • Sniﬃ  ng. Monitoring data traveling along a network.
• • Spyware. Malicious, covert (diﬃ  cult to detect) soft-
ware that infects a computer in a manner similar to 
viruses, collecting information or executing other pro-
grams without the user’s knowledge. Some programs 
can track which Web sites a user visits; some can track 
and capture personal user information.
• • Trashing. To scavenge through a business’s garbage 
looking for useful information. Also called dumpster 
diving.
• • Trojan horse. A malicious program hidden inside an 
apparently harmless, legitimate program, intended to 
carry out unauthorized or illegal functions. For exam-
ple, a program controlling a computer log-on process 
could log on a user (legitimate) but also record the 
user’s password (unauthorized, illegal).
• • URL. Universal Resource Locator. A string of charac-
ters representing an Internet resource.
• • Virtual reality. An artiﬁ cial, interactive world cre-
ated by computer technology (usually involving some 
kind of immersion system, such as a headset).
• • Zombie. A computer that has been taken over by 
another computer, typically through infection with 
hidden software (virus) that allows the zombie 
machine to be accessed and controlled remotely, often 
with the intention of perpetrating attacks on other 
computers.

and is easier to remember than a string of numbers. A 
domain name is not the same as a Web address, although 
many people incorrectly refer to it as such. A Web address, 
or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), has several more ele-
ments. For example,
URL: http://www.amz456.com 
Scheme name: http (https typically denotes a secure 
Web site)—this part simply means an http request is 
being made to the host server
Domain name: amz456.com
Subdomain: www
Domain: amz456
Top level domain: com
Common top-level domains include the following:

LIVE CHAT AND INSTANT MESSAGING
Many ISPs provide chat rooms and oﬀ er instant messag-
ing (IM) to their subscribers, features that allow two or 
more people to “talk” online in real time. Such conversa-
tions can involve criminal activity, including child pornog-
raphy. Because of its popularity, AOL is fairly well policed,

 3. Computer as incidental to an oﬀ ense. Signiﬁ cant for law 
enforcement because of the role the computer played 
in facilitating or executing a crime. For example, com-
puters may be used by pedophiles to store child por-
nography, by drug traﬃ  ckers to store business contact 
information and by prostitution rings to manage pay-
roll and customer accounts.
Computer-related crimes may be categorized as 
computer as target, computer as tool or computer 
as incidental to the offense.
 
However one chooses to categorize the various types 
of computer-related crimes, investigators should be aware 
of the ever-expanding ways in which computers are used 
for criminal endeavors.
THE COMPUTER AS TARGET
Some cybercrimes involve the infection or inﬁ ltration of a 
computer system’s software by a malware that, when exe-
cuted, removes a degree of control of the machine from 
the authorized user and places it in the hands of an out-
sider. Th ese crimes can involve viruses, worms and DoS 
attacks and almost invariably involve hacking.
Hacking Th eterms hacking and cracking are alternately 
used by law enforcement agencies to refer to the act of 
gaining unauthorized access to a computer system. How-
ever, among the people who perform these actions, a 
clear distinction is made between those who intrude for 
the challenge and status (hackers) and those who intrude 
to commit a crime (crackers). A hacker is not necessar-
ily a negative term. A cracker, on the other hand, is a 
hacker in the negative sense, someone who cracks soft-
ware protection and removes it. Crackers deliberately, 
maliciously intrude into a computer or network to cause 
damage. Many investigative agencies refer to these people 
simply as “intruders” or “attackers” instead of hackers or 
crackers.
Viruses A computer virus is a program that attacks, 
attaches itself to and becomes part of another executable 
program. Th e purpose may be to replace or destroy data 
on the computer’s hard drive or to simply leave a back 
door open for later entry.
 
Viruses can be transmitted through communication 
lines or by an infected disk or other removable media 
and can infect any PC. Just as human viruses are spread 
from one person to another, so computer viruses are 
spread from program to program. Viruses can be acciden-
tally introduced into a system by infected media carried 
with the names of chat rooms being carefully monitored. 
Th e Internet Relay Chat (IRC) environment is similar to 
AOL but oﬀ ers worldwide communication. Unlike AOL, 
IRC chat rooms are not monitored; therefore, it is com-
mon to see names such as #teensex or #newidentities (all 
IRC channel names begin with #). Both AOL and IRC ser-
vices allow “chatters” to leave a group room and have a 
private conversation over a more secure connection using 
Direct Channel Chat (DCC).
 
Investigators should also be familiar with the types of 
crimes that may involve computers.
CLASSIFICATION AND TYPES 
OF COMPUTER CRIMES
The crimes committed with computers range 
from students changing school records and 
grades to thieves embezzling millions of dollars from large 
corporations to pedophiles luring unsuspecting children 
into child pornography. Th e International Association of 
Chiefs of Police (IACP) points out, “Th e computer may be 
contraband, fruits of the crime, a tool of the oﬀ ense, or a 
storage container holding evidence of the oﬀ ense” (Best 
Practices, 2006, p.3).
 
Th e U.S. Secret Service’s Electronic Crimes Branch 
(ECB) of its Financial Crimes Division has investigated 
matters involving credit card fraud, unauthorized com-
puter access, cellular and land line telephone service tam-
pering, the production of false identiﬁ cation, counterfeit 
currency, threats made against the president, narcotics, 
illegal ﬁ rearms traﬃ  cking and even homicides. Some even 
contend there will come a point when cybercrime laws 
become unnecessary because most crimes will involve 
computers in some way.
 
As computer crime evolves and speciﬁ c oﬀ enses 
emerge, diﬀ erent categories are being identiﬁ ed. Th e U.S. 
Department of Justice has delineated three basic ways 
computers are being used criminally:
 1. Computer as target. A computer or network’s conﬁ den-
tiality, integrity or availability is attacked, resulting in 
the theft of services or information or the damaging 
of victim computers. Denial of service (DoS) attacks 
and the release of malware (viruses and worms) are 
examples of this type of computer crime.
 2. Computer as tool. Includes crimes that have migrated 
from the physical world into cyberspace, such as child 
pornography, fraud, intellectual property violations, 
gambling, harassment and the online sale of illegal 
substances and goods.

CHAPTER 17 | Computer Crime | 509
on a machine connected to the Internet. And, unlike a 
virus, a worm need not become part of another program 
to propagate itself.
Denial-of-Service Attacks A denial of service 
(DoS) attack disrupts or degrades a computer or net-
work’s Internet connection or e-mail service, thus 
interrupting the regular ﬂ ow of data. Using multiple 
agents to create a widespread interruption is a distrib-
uted DoS, or DDoS. When a target company’s Web site is 
ﬂ ooded with requests for information or by some other 
onslaught of incoming data, the system is eventually 
overloaded and the site shuts down. At this time the 
company’s cost clock starts ticking: Either the company 
submits to extortion by its attackers or it is forced to 
incur millions of dollars in lost revenue as a result of its 
Web site being down. 
Extortion Cybercriminals may attempt to extort thou-
sands, even millions, of dollars from companies by threat-
ening to or actually damaging the company’s computers, 
network or Web presence. Extortion can be achieved via 
DoS attacks or threats to expose a company’s Web vulner-
abilities, making the oﬀ ense ﬁ t both categories of com-
puter as target and as tool. 
THE COMPUTER AS TOOL
A computer connected to the Internet has become the tool 
of choice for many criminals, as they have taken the tra-
ditional methods of committing their illegalities and ele-
vated them to high-tech levels. Many of the theft oﬀ enses 
described later overlap or are commonly committed 
between home and work or passed among students or col-
leagues (Figure 17.2). Th e publicity surrounding recent 
mass virus attacks has raised the public’s and corporate 
America’s awareness of their computer systems’ vulner-
abilities and led many to install protective devices, such 
as antivirus or virus detection programs, downloadable 
software patches and ﬁ rewalls. Nonetheless, vast num-
bers of machines remain unprotected, and many consum-
ers neglect to keep their virus detection subscriptions 
current.
Worms Although the general computing public fears 
exposure to computer viruses, many are unaware that 
worms are actually more powerful and destructive. A 
worm is a self-contained program that travels from 
machine to machine across network connections, often 
clogging networks and information systems as it spreads. 
Whereas viruses require some action by the computer 
user (clicking or downloading), worms do not. Th ey sim-
ply come in through an “open door” or unprotected port 
Hacking has evolved signiﬁ cantly over the past three decades and 
is often, although not necessarily, a negative term used to refer to 
cybercriminals. Credited as the original hacker, John Draper (aka 
“Captain Crunch”) is the creator of the infamous Blue Box, a device 
that hacked telephone systems in the early 1970s by mimicking the 
tones that control phone switches, allowing hackers to make free 
long distance calls, bill calls to someone else’s phone number, and 
so forth.
With this ﬁ rst form of hacking, coined phone phreaking by 
Draper, began the custom of “ph” spellings used in many hacker 
pseudonyms and organizations.
Phishing, ﬁ rst referenced in hacker literature in 1996, was a 
term given to the act of “ﬁ shing” in the sea of Internet users for 
sensitive information (passwords, ﬁ nancial data, etc.) hackers 
could use for personal beneﬁ t. First applied to stealing AOL user 
information, phishing has grown increasingly widespread and 
malicious, targeting major ﬁ nancial institutions and e-commerce 
sites. (© Getty Images)

Th e FBI, through IC3, has investigated numerous 
reshipper schemes throughout the United States and 
abroad. IC3 has also formed a public-private alliance with 
the Merchants Risk Council (MRC) in an eﬀ ort to shut 
down such Internet fraud through use of real-time data 
sharing between law enforcement and private industry. 
Spam Spam is unsolicited bulk e-mail messages, simi-
lar to junk mail and commonly commercial. Lesser known 
by its formal designation as unsolicited commercial e-mail 
(UCE), spam is most often perceived by recipients as an 
annoyance and nothing more. Granted, it is a widespread, 
persistent annoyance. Chain letter spam is an example 
of the type of unsolicited e-mail that clogs the Internet 
and ﬁ lls people’s inboxes but falls well short of criminal 
conduct. Sometimes, however, spam is distributed on 
such a massive scale, with such malicious or contentious 
content or with intent to defraud, that the spamming 
becomes criminal. For example, chain letters calling for 
a payment to participate may be construed as pyramid 
schemes, which are illegal in most states. Investment or 
business opportunity spam, which entices people with the 
promise of eﬀ ortless income and ﬁ nancial freedom for the 
small price of an upfront “investment,” commonly results 
in only the spammer getting rich, while victims ﬁ le com-
plaints alleging theft or online fraud.
 
Spam that leaves no question as to its illegality is that 
intended to phish, commit identity theft or otherwise 
extract sensitive information from a computer user with 
the ultimate goal of using such information to engage in 
criminal activity. Identity theft and phishing were dis-
cussed in Chapter 14. 
Spoofing Spooﬁ ng, often considered synonymous 
with phishing, is acquiring unauthorized access to a com-
puter or network through a message using an IP address 
that appears to be from a trusted host, in an attempt to 
commit identity theft.
Pharming Pharming is a cybercrime that is catching 
even the most cautious, experienced Internet users oﬀ  
guard. Pharming involves hijacking a domain name to 
redirect online traﬃ  c away from a legitimate Web site 
toward a fake site, such as a bogus bank Web site. Even 
if a computer user types in the correct domain name of a 
legitimate site, if that site has been pharmed, the user will 
be unknowingly taken to the fraudulent site, where they 
may unwittingly reveal account numbers, passwords and 
other sensitive personal information that can be used for 
identity theft or other criminal endeavors.
Theft of Intellectual Property Th is oﬀ ense involves 
the pirating of proprietary information and copyrighted 
together and thus may be investigated from a variety of 
angles and prosecuted under numerous laws.
Fraud Internet fraud can involve several other oﬀ enses 
singled out in this section, such as phishing, spamming 
and identity theft. Th e types of fraud committed online 
span a wide range of businesses and topics. 
Reshipper Schemes In this age of telecommuting 
and rising gas prices, the appeal of working from home 
has never been greater. Preying oﬀ  this interest are scam 
artists who lure unsuspecting job seekers into reship-
ping schemes, transforming these citizens into “mules” 
who unwittingly help their “employers” commit interna-
tional crime. To top it oﬀ , prospective employees must 
usually complete an application, on which they disclose 
such information as their birth date and social security 
number—harmless enough in the hands of a legitimate 
employer, but money in the pocket for identity thieves 
and others with a criminal bent.
 
Victims are attracted to the scheme through ads 
posted on popular employment Web sites seeking “cor-
respondence managers,” “freight-forwarding coordi-
nators,” or other respectable-sounding titles and are 
guaranteed to earn money by working from home with-
out even quitting their current jobs. After applicants are 
informed they have been hired—and nearly everyone 
who applies is hired—they begin receiving parcels at 
home with instructions on how to forward this merchan-
dise to the company’s home oﬃ  ce abroad. Th e reship-
pers are compensated well, with one correspondence 
manager earning $24 for every package he reshipped. 
Th us, employee complaints, at this stage, are few. What 
employees do not know, however, is that the products 
they are reshipping are actually goods ordered online, 
purchased with fraudulent credit cards and sent overseas 
to be sold on the black market, or that they (the mules) 
have become part of a high-end fencing operation that 
converts stolen personal and ﬁ nancial data into tangible 
goods and cash.
 
Oﬀ enders also lure victims into their scheme by estab-
lishing relationships with them in online chat rooms. Over 
time, oﬀ enders weave a tale of how, because of various 
legal restrictions, they are unable to direct business ship-
ments from the United States into their home countries. 
Th ey play up the injustice of these laws and how their gov-
ernment uses such restrictions to keep its citizens in pov-
erty. Eventually, the scam artist gains the victim’s trust, 
through either befriending or seduction. Oﬀ enders may 
even send small gifts to their victims as tokens of their 
aﬀ ection. Whatever ploy is used, victims ultimately agree 
to have packages sent to their home, which they will then 
reship to their “friend” in another country.

CHAPTER 17 | Computer Crime | 511
 
Cyberterrorism, however, does not merely equate to 
terrorists communicating through cyberspace. It is the 
actual use of computers and Internet technology to cause 
intimidation and destruction. Cyberterrorists can target a 
speciﬁ c business or industry, or they can wreak electronic 
havoc indiscriminately across giant segments of the Inter-
net. In recent years, intense concern has developed about 
the threat of a possible terrorist attack on the computer 
networks that link to critical parts of the U.S. infrastruc-
ture, such as those dedicated to public health and the dis-
tribution of emergency services, government and defense 
operations, energy and utility services and elements that 
keep our economy in motion, such as shipping and cargo 
distribution. Terrorism is the focus of Chapter 20.
SPECIAL CHALLENGES IN 
INVESTIGATION
Any type of criminal investigation carries poten-
tial challenges, and those involving computer 
crime are no exception.
Special challenges in investigating computer crime 
include victims’ reluctance or failure to report such 
crimes, the investigator’s lack of training and the lack of 
understanding of computer crimes by others within the 
justice system, the need for specialists and teamwork, 
the fragility of the evidence and jurisdictional issues.
NONREPORTING OF COMPUTER CRIMES
For the police to deter cybercrimes, the crimes must be 
reported, thoroughly investigated and, when the evidence 
is suﬃ  cient, prosecuted. Law enforcement’s ability to 
identify coordinated threats is directly tied to the amount 
of reporting that takes place (CIO Cyberthreat Response, 
2008). Too often, however, victims of computer-related 
crimes either are unaware that a crime has been com-
mitted or have a reason for not reporting the crime to 
authorities. Th e 2007 E-Crime Watch Survey found that 
most e-crimes are handled internally without involving 
legal action or law enforcement (67 percent for insid-
ers, 66 percent for outsiders). When asked why they had 
not referred these e-crimes for legal action, respondents 
echoed last year’s ﬁ nding that either the damage level was 
insuﬃ  cient to warrant prosecution (40 percent), there 
was a lack of evidence (34 percent) or they could not iden-
tify the individuals responsible (28 percent).
material. Illegal online piracy is rampant, with criminals 
around the globe cashing in on the lucrative black market of 
illegally copied and distributed software, movies, music and 
video and computer games, as discussed in Chapter 14. 
 
Because successful criminal prosecution of intellectual 
property theft requires reliable investigative resources, 
the FBI’s Cyber Division and Intellectual Property Rights 
Division were created to investigate intellectual property 
theft and fraud. 
Online Child Pornography and Child Sexual Abuse An 
increasingly persistent, pervasive cyber problem for law 
enforcement is the ﬂ ow of child pornography. Pedophiles 
and other sex oﬀ enders around the world have discovered 
how quickly and surreptitiously they can exchange ille-
gal images online. Th e Internet also provides a forum in 
which pedophiles can “meet” potential victims, in hopes 
of arranging a face-to-face meeting at some point. In one 
case involving a missing child, detectives asked the family 
about the child’s hobbies and were told he spent a great 
deal of time on the computer. By examining the computer 
ﬁ les, detectives learned that the child had been contacted 
by a pedophile and had unwittingly arranged a meeting. 
When investigators went to the meeting site, they found 
the child with the pedophile.
 
Th e development of software now enables more com-
puter-savvy pornographers to create virtual child pornog-
raphy in which an image of an actual child is manipulated, 
or “morphed,” into an image no longer identiﬁ able as that 
particular child. Some programs allow entirely computer-
generated children to be depicted in a variety of sexual 
situations. As these programs become more reﬁ ned, it is 
getting more diﬃ  cult to distinguish between real children 
and virtual children. Such software presents considerable 
legal implications and challenges involving how a jurisdic-
tion deﬁ nes child pornography and how investigators pro-
ceed with child pornography cases.
 
Investigating crimes against children was discussed 
in Chapter 11.
Cyberterrorism Terrorism—traditionally deﬁ ned as 
the actual or threatened use of force or violence, moti-
vated by political or religious ideals or grievances and 
exacted for the purposes of intimidation, coercion or 
ransom—has evolved into cyberterrorism courtesy of the 
Internet. Cyberterrorism is the premeditated, politically 
motivated attack against information, computer systems, 
computer programs and data that results in violence 
against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or 
clandestine agents. It also refers using a computer system 
as a conduit for causing terror. Terrorists use this global 
interconnectivity to communicate with each other and to 
commit crimes to fund their other nefarious activities.

equipment to do the job. Enlisting the aid of specialists is 
extremely critical considering the fragile nature of much 
computer crime evidence. Specialized cybercrime investi-
gative teams are examined later in the chapter.
FRAGILITY AND SENSITIVITY OF EVIDENCE IN 
COMPUTER CRIME
Th e biggest diﬀ erence between traditional evidence and 
computer evidence is the fragility of the latter. As stressed 
in Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence: A Guide for Law 
Enforcement (2004), “Digital evidence, by its very nature, 
is fragile and can be altered, damaged, or destroyed by 
improper handling or examination. For these reasons spe-
cial precautions should be taken to preserve this type of 
evidence. Failure to do so may render it unusable or lead 
to an inaccurate conclusion.” Much the same way an oﬃ  -
cer responding to a more traditional crime may contami-
nate the scene by inadvertently altering the environment, 
an oﬃ  cer responding to a computer crime may destroy 
digital evidence simply by turning a computer or other 
device on or oﬀ  at the wrong time. Recommended tech-
niques and processes for collecting computer evidence are 
presented shortly.
JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES
Th e global reach of the Internet poses another challenge in 
computer crime cases by introducing jurisdictional com-
plications on top of an already complex area of criminal 
investigation. Diﬃ  culties exist in determining jurisdiction 
when the equipment being employed criminally is located 
in one community and the computer that is illegally 
entered electronically is in another state or even another 
country. For example, a 28-year-old in St. Petersburg, 
Russia, hacked into Citibank’s cash-management system 
in New York City and stole millions of dollars. Where did 
the crime take place—St. Petersburg or New York City? 
Who has jurisdiction?
 
Th e traditional concept of jurisdiction focuses almost 
exclusively on the territorial aspect of “where did the 
act take place?” However, traditional territorial bound-
aries are often complicated in cybercrime cases because 
the location of the acts must take into account the loca-
tion of the defendant and where the material originated 
(was uploaded from), any servers this information passed 
through, the location of computers where material was 
downloaded and the location of any eﬀ ects this material 
may have set in motion.
 
In cases of international scope, it is necessary to 
determine whether the act is illegal in all of the countries 
 
Th e CSI Survey (Richardson, 2007) reports that the 
most common reason for not reporting e-crimes to law 
enforcement was a fear that negative publicity would hurt 
the organization’s stock or image (26 percent), followed 
by a belief that law enforcement would be unable to help 
(22 percent), competitors would use the incident to their 
advantage (14 percent), a civil remedy was sought (7 per-
cent), the victim company was unaware of a law enforce-
ment interest (5 percent) and other reasons (2 percent).
 
To help companies more eﬀ ectively address cyberthreats 
and cybercrimes, the FBI, Secret Service and CIO Magazine 
have collaborated to create a Cyberthreat Report form out-
lining the basic information needed by law enforcement 
when responding to an initial call of a suspected computer 
crime (Figure 17.3).
LACK OF INVESTIGATOR TRAINING
Another challenge facing investigators assigned to com-
puter crimes is that often they have not been adequately 
trained or equipped to investigate these felonies. Cyber-
criminals are usually more technologically sophisticated 
and have more resources, more access to the newest tech-
nology and more time to devote than do the investigators 
assigned to the cases. Th e technological disadvantage of 
many law enforcement agencies is painfully obvious.
 
Law enforcement at all levels needs additional train-
ing in the following areas: the unique requirements of 
computer crimes; digital evidence; identifying, marking 
and storing this evidence; the capabilities of present pri-
vate and state agencies to analyze this evidence; and the 
procedures for developing teams to conduct investiga-
tions of computer-related crimes.
NEED FOR SPECIALISTS AND TEAMWORK
Computer-related crimes may be relatively low tech, but 
for cybercrimes of a highly technical nature in which frag-
ile digital evidence must be extracted from extensive data-
base systems with equipment that is unfamiliar to police 
oﬃ  cers, the proactive law enforcement department has 
already devised a response protocol and assembled an 
investigative team of qualiﬁ ed specialists.
 
Departments may be intimidated by the prospect of 
forming a cybercrime unit. However, “In many ways the 
process of creating a high-tech investigative response 
team is similar to creating any other specialized response 
team” (Sheetz, 2004, p.14). Th e areas to focus on are 
selecting the right personnel, establishing a speciﬁ c pro-
tocol to guide investigators, providing the proper training 
for team members and acquiring the necessary tools and

because of the commerce clause and what is commonly 
referred to as the nexus requirement. Disagreement exists 
between the various courts regarding when a nexus, or 
link, exists regarding the interstate commerce clause to 
justify federal jurisdiction. Some courts have ruled that 
cybercrime automatically comes under federal jurisdiction 
because the Internet falls under the commerce clause as an 
instrumentality of interstate commerce, just as do com-
mon carriers, phone services, and so forth (United States 
v. Sutcliﬀ e, 2007). Other courts, however, have held that 
digital content does not automatically come under fed-
eral jurisdiction simply because it was transmitted across 
the Internet and that judicial notice is required, similar to 
showing that a gun traveled in interstate commerce, for 
the case to elevate to federal jurisdiction (United States 
v. Schaefer, 2007). Th is area of law is still suﬀ ering from 
growing pains, as courts struggle to deﬁ ne jurisdiction 
with regard to computer crime. For this reason, we sug-
gest investigators keep close dialogue with prosecutors on 
the evolving nature of jurisdiction in cybercrime cases. 
 
Other major challenges in investigating computer 
crimes include determining the exact nature of the crime 
and gathering evidence to not disrupt an organization’s 
regular operation. 
 
As with any other crime, once a report of a cybercrime 
or cyberthreat has been received, the department gener-
ally conducts a preliminary investigation.
THE PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
Cybercrime investigations share many of the 
same characteristics of other felony cases: “A 
computer crime investigation requires a consistent, 
repeatable and documented investigative methodology” 
(Spohn, 2006, p.58). However, because of the highly tech-
nical nature of computer crimes and the fragile nature of 
the evidence, oﬃ  cers must receive “ﬁ rst responder” train-
ing and have extensive knowledge of computers or seek 
the assistance of a computer expert.
 
When a police department receives a report of a pos-
sible computer crime, the departmental report procedure 
is followed for the initial information. Th e oﬃ  cer assigned 
to the case interviews the reporting person to obtain the 
information necessary to determine whether a crime has 
been committed.
 
Th is ﬁ rst responder has a critical role in preserving 
the crime scene to protect the integrity of the evidence 
because this is the point where such digital evidence is 
most vulnerable. 
involved. For example, the Love Bug virus that spread 
across the globe in 2 hours in May 2000, aﬀ ecting more 
than 45 million users in more than 20 countries, was 
developed in and distributed from the Philippines, where 
the act of virus dissemination was not illegal at the time. 
Th e location of the defendant in such a country meant he 
could not be extradited to the United States, where his 
acts were considered illegal, because of a treaty-established 
requirement of double criminality in cases involving 
international jurisdiction, meaning the act would have 
needed to be criminal in both countries. Th is requirement 
of double criminality presents numerous problems for 
law enforcement and prosecutors trying to stem the ris-
ing tide of international cybercrime. For example, in cases 
of child pornography,
• • Th e age of majority (or consent) varies from country 
to country.
• • In some countries, such as Germany, the age of con-
sent is as low as 14.
• • Virtual child pornography is legal in some countries 
and illegal in others.
 
Virtual child pornography, illegal in Canada and the 
European Union, was also declared illegal in the United 
States under the Child Pornography Prevention Act 
(CPPA) of 1996. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 
Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002) that the portion 
of the CPPA prohibiting the production or distribution of 
such virtual pornography was overly broad and an uncon-
stitutional infringement on the First Amendment right to 
freedom of speech.
 
Recognizing the need for a more uniﬁ ed global 
approach to handling cybercrime, the Council of Europe 
formed a Convention on Cybercrime on November 23, 
2001, in Budapest. Th e convention set forth a frame-
work for investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes and 
required that signers pass laws in their countries making 
speciﬁ c acts, such as hacking, copyright infringement and 
child pornography, illegal.
 
A computer crime investigation may also involve 
domestic jurisdictional issues, between state and federal 
levels of jurisdiction as well as between states. Complicat-
ing the matter is the fact that states, like nations, have 
varying deﬁ nitions of cybercrime. Some states take a very 
broad approach to the issue, relying on statutes deﬁ ning 
general criminal jurisdiction to establish jurisdiction in 
cybercrime cases, but other states have more speciﬁ c stat-
utes delineating the elements constituting the crime and 
its accompanying jurisdiction (Brenner and Koops, 2004, 
p.11). Another piece of the jurisdiction puzzle—one the 
courts have yet to reach consensus on—centers on whether 
cybercrime necessarily falls under federal jurisdiction 

CHAPTER 17 | Computer Crime | 515
 
Before any evidence is touched, it must be properly 
documented (a later stage, discussed shortly). However, 
before identifying and documenting evidence, prelimi-
nary interviews must be conducted.
Preliminary Interviews If a crime is suspected or 
determined, further interviewing of the complainant and 
witnesses should continue. Information must be obtained 
as soon as possible because evidence is easily destroyed. 
Preliminary interviews are conducted before collecting 
evidence because these interviews help determine the 
nature of the crime and develop suspects. If the crime 
involves a computer user in a private residence or other 
type of singular victim, ask how the user became aware of 
the crime and who his or her ISP is. Th e victim will need to 
provide his or her username(s) and password(s) because 
such information is typically required to access the sys-
tem. Ask about security devices or programs installed on 
the machine and obtain as much documentation as pos-
sible regarding the victim computer’s hardware and soft-
ware conﬁ gurations.
 
If the victim is a business or other organization, inter-
view employees and staﬀ  because they are a good source of 
information unless they are suspected of collusion. Inter-
nal reporting of this type of crime is the same as for any 
other crime within an organization, normally beginning 
at the lowest level and reporting upward to the supervi-
sor and then to management. However, supervisory or 
management personnel are conceivably part of the collu-
sion, so care must be used in the initial stages to eliminate 
those capable of being involved. Th ose with security clear-
ance to access sensitive data or areas within a company’s 
network must also be interviewed and evaluated as pos-
sible suspects. If a computer has been stolen, determine 
if it is protected by CompuTrace, computer security and 
tracking software that helps deter theft and recover sto-
len machines.
 
Th e National Institute of Justice (NIJ) (Electronic 
Crime Scene Investigation, 2008, pp.17–18) recommends 
the following information be obtained in the preliminary 
interviews:
• • Names of all users of the computers and devices
• • All computer and Internet user information
• • All log-in names and user account names
• • Purpose and uses of computers and devices
• • All passwords
• • Any automated applications in use
• • Types of Internet access
• • Any oﬀ site storage
• • Internet service provider
• • Installed software documentation
A common protocol for processing a crime scene 
involving electronic evidence is as follows:
• • Secure and evaluate the crime scene
• • Obtain a search warrant
• • Recognize and identify the evidence
• • Document the crime scene
• • Collect and preserve evidence
• • Package, transport and store evidence
• • Document the investigation in an incident report.
SECURING AND EVALUATING THE SCENE
As with any other crime scene, the ﬁ rst responder’s ini-
tial priority is to ensure the safety of everyone at the 
scene and to protect the integrity of evidence, both con-
ventional (physical) and electronic. Next, the responding 
oﬃ  cer should restrict access to any computers, visually 
identify potential evidence (do not touch anything yet), 
determine whether such evidence is perishable and for-
mulate a search plan. Th e recommended steps for secur-
ing and evaluating the crime scene are
• • Remove all individuals from the immediate area from 
which evidence is to be collected.
• • At this point in the investigation, do not alter the 
condition of any electronic device: If it is on, leave it 
on. If it is oﬀ , leave it oﬀ .
• • Protect perishable data on pagers, caller ID boxes, 
cell phones, and so on, physically and electronically, 
always keeping in mind that devices containing 
perishable data should be immediately secured and 
documented (photographed).
• • Identify any communications lines (telephone, 
LAN/Ethernet connections) attached to devices such 
as modems and caller ID boxes. Document, label and 
disconnect each line from the wall rather than the 
device, if possible. Communication via such lines must 
be severed to prevent remote access to data on the 
computers.
• • Do not touch the keyboard, mouse, diskettes, CDs or 
any other computer equipment or electronic devices 
(evidence) at this stage. (Electronic Crime Scene Investi-
gation, 2008)
Figure 17.4 presents a ﬂ ow chart for the process of collect-
ing digital evidence.
A basic tenet for ﬁ rst responders at computer crime 
scenes is to observe the ON/OFF rule: If it’s on, leave it 
on. If it’s off, leave it off.

CHAPTER 17 | Computer Crime | 517
RECOGNIZING EVIDENCE—TRADITIONAL 
AND DIGITAL
Computer crimes commonly involve both conventional 
evidence (ﬁ ngerprints, documents, computer hard drive, 
etc.) and digital evidence (electronic computer ﬁ les, 
e-mails, etc.). For physical evidence, search techniques 
and patterns described in Chapter 4 apply. Seal the area 
and search it according to the type and location of the evi-
dence necessary for prosecution. Avoid pressures to speed 
up the search because of a desire for continued use of the 
system, but return the equipment as soon as possible and 
be sensitive to the company’s need to get back to “busi-
ness as usual” as quickly as possible.
 
Th e NIJ has deﬁ ned electronic evidence as “informa-
tion and data that is of value to an investigation that is 
stored on, received or transmitted by an electronic device” 
(Electronic Crime Scene Investigation, 2008, p.ix). Th e NIJ 
also explains that electronic evidence
• • Is latent like ﬁ ngerprints or DNA evidence.
• • Crosses jurisdictional borders quickly and easily.
• • Is easily altered, damaged or destroyed.
• • Can be time sensitive.
 
It is usually not diﬃ  cult for an investigator to recognize 
obvious evidence such as a computer, keyboard or mouse, 
but digital evidence may also exist among a host of other 
electronic devices too often overlooked (Table 17.2). Some 
of these devices contain perishable data and thus must be 
immediately secured and documented. Remember: Do not 
alter a device’s condition at this point. If it is oﬀ , leave it oﬀ .
 
Figure 17.5 summarizes the nature of information and 
types of evidence commonly encountered during a com-
puter crime scene search as they relate to speciﬁ c crimes.
 
For certain crimes—such as child pornography, iden-
tity theft and computer attacks—CDs, DVDs, diskettes 
and tapes are likely to hold an abundance of evidence. 
Because criminals often keep “trophies” or collections to 
document their activities, investigators should search the 
work area around computers as well as CD and DVD stor-
age units throughout the premises. Some wily oﬀ enders 
try to hide incriminating CDs and DVDs among legitimate 
ones or insert illicit data into a disk that contains other-
wise aboveboard content.
 
Investigators should remember that digital evidence 
may also contain physical evidence such as DNA, ﬁ nger-
prints or serology.
DOCUMENTING DIGITAL EVIDENCE
As with other crime scenes, thorough notes, sketches and 
photographs are necessary to create a permanent record of 
normally comprehensible message, or steganography, 
which is Greek for “hidden writing” and aims to keep 
everyone except the intended recipient of a message 
oblivious to its very existence (Forensic Examination, p.8). 
A steganographic message often appears as some type of 
“cover” message—a shopping list, a picture, and so forth. 
Steganography should not be confused with stenography 
(shorthand).
 
Before evidence can be collected, it must be recognized 
and documented. First, however, it may be necessary to 
obtain a warrant because having a search warrant gener-
ally decreases the amount of resistance investigators face 
at the scene and increases the odds of successful prosecu-
tion should the case go to court (Best Practices, 2006).
OBTAINING A SEARCH WARRANT
Searches may be conducted by consent. However, if the 
suspect is unknown, this is not desirable because it could 
alert the person who committed the crime. In such cases, 
a search warrant must be obtained. 
 
Privacy issues surrounding some or all the informa-
tion contained in the digital evidence desired may pose a 
legal technicality. If the organization involved is the vic-
tim of the crime, its management normally grants permis-
sion. If it is not the victim, it may be necessary to obtain 
permission from individuals named in the evidentiary 
ﬁ le, which could be an enormous task. It may be better to 
take the evidence to a court and obtain court permission 
if possible.
 
Investigators may have both a consent search form 
and a search warrant, thus avoiding the possibility of 
destruction of evidence. Consent is better than a search 
warrant in that it avoids the usual attack by the defense in 
search warrant cases.
Request the consent initially, and if that fails, use the 
search warrant. 
 
If the order is reversed, the consent is bastardized 
because the search warrant was used as a threat in obtain-
ing voluntary consent. Th e areas of search and the sought 
items must be speciﬁ ed in the warrant. Determine the 
computer system used and the types of physical evidence 
available from this system. Include this information in 
the search warrant application. A person connected with 
the computer operation in question should assist with the 
search warrant to provide information to the investiga-
tors, and this person should accompany the investigators 
with the aﬃ  davit for warrant in case the judge requires 
technical explanations that the investigators cannot pro-
vide regarding the equipment and the evidence desired.

518 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
relative to each other (e.g., a mouse to the left of the 
keyboard may indicate a left-handed user).
• • Document the condition and location of the 
 computer system, noting the computer’s power 
 status (on, oﬀ , sleep mode). Check the power status 
light if no other obvious indication exists. An “oﬀ ” 
machine that still feels warm was most likely just 
recently turned oﬀ .
• • Identify and document related electronic components 
that will not be collected.
• • Photograph the entire scene with 360-degree cover-
age, if possible.
• • Photograph the front and back of the computer, the 
monitor screen and other peripheral components 
connected to the computer. An active program may 
require videotaping or more extensive documentation 
of screen activity.
 
Th e preceding guidelines are generally suﬃ  cient for 
most stand-alone computers. However, in a business 
environment, multiple computers may be connected to 
each other or to a central server: “Securing and process-
ing a crime scene where the computer systems are net-
worked poses special problems, as improper shutdown 
may destroy data. Th is can result in loss of evidence and 
potential severe civil liability” (Electronic Crime Scene 
Investigation, 2008, p.32). Indicators of a computer 
network include
• • Th e presence of multiple computer systems.
• • Th e presence of cables and connectors running 
between computers or central devices such as hubs.
• • Information provided by those on the scene or by 
informants.
COLLECTING PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL 
EVIDENCE
Investigators assigned to cybercrimes or other computer-
related crimes must have ready certain tools and equip-
ment commonly required in cases involving electronic 
evidence: 
In most cases, items or devices containing digital evi-
dence can be collected using standard seizure tools 
and materials. First responders must . . . avoid using 
any tools or materials that may produce or emit static 
electricity or a magnetic ﬁ eld as they may damage or 
destroy the evidence. . . .
 
In addition to tools for processing crime scenes 
in general, ﬁ rst responders should have the following 
items in their digital evidence collection toolkit: cameras

First responders should also have radio frequency-
shielding material such as faraday isolation bags or 
aluminum foil to wrap cell phones, smart phones, and 
other mobile communication devices after they have 
been seized. [Th is] . . . prevents the phones from

tigation, 2008, p.6) strongly cautions, “Without having

attempt to explore the contents or recover data from a 
computer (e.g., do not touch the keyboard or click the

clearly identiﬁ ed and matched with the software they 
represent.
 
In more complex cases, the volume of evidence is 
significant because large amounts of information can 
be stored on a single disk, CD or DVD. In most felony 
investigations, the amount of evidence is not a major 
problem, but in the case of computer crimes, the evi-
dence may involve hundreds of disks, CDs or DVDs. 
Copying this amount of evidence can be costly and 
time-consuming. In addition, taking equipment into 
evidence can be a major problem because some equip-
ment is heavy and bulky.
 
In a very few cases, the evidence is the computer 
equipment. Also, it may be necessary to keep the 
equipment operating to continue business. Investiga-
tors must work with management to determine how to 
best accomplish this. If the evidence cannot be moved 
from the premises, management may have to provide 
on-premises security with their own guards or with 
temporarily hired security until the evidence can be 
copied or otherwise secured by court order or by police 
security.
 
Other nonelectronic evidence that may prove valuable 
to the investigation includes material found in the vicin-
ity of the suspect computer system, such as handwritten 
notes, Post-It notes with passwords written on them, 
blank pads of paper with the indentations from previous 
pages torn oﬀ , hardware and software manuals, calendars 
and photographs.
 
Any evidence collected and removed from the prem-
ises must be entered onto an evidence log, thus creat-
ing a chain of custody that must be maintained from this 
point forward throughout the investigation. Two chains 
of custody are involved in digital evidence: the physical 
items themselves and their associated data (Digital Evi-
dence in the Courtroom, 2007). Investigators should be 
aware that the chain-of-custody issues regarding data are 
additional to the chain-of-custody issues regarding the 
physical item.
Collecting Evidence from Cyberspace Most, if not 
all, cybercrimes leave some type of cyber trail or “e-print” 
as evidence because ISPs maintain records of everything a 
subscriber does online, at least for a while. If an investiga-
tor knows a suspect user’s screen name, it can be linked 
to an identiﬁ able IP address. Th e IP address(es) associated 
with suspect pieces of data transmitted via the Internet 
will help track down the user’s ISP. However, no law yet 
requires maintaining online activity data, and the stor-
age policies of ISPs can vary tremendously. For example, 
cause it to self-destruct. Check for a hardware disabler, 
a device designed to ensure a self-destruct sequence of 
any potential evidence. It may be present on or around 
a computer, with a remote power switch being the most 
prevalent of the disabler hardware devices. If found, a 
disabler switch should be taped in the position in which 
it was found.
 
Evidence in computer cases is also unique in that 
it is not as readily discernible as is evidence in most 
other criminal cases. Computer disks, for example, 
although visible in the physical sense, contain “invisible” 
information.
Digital evidence is often contained on disks, CDs or 
hard drives, or on any number of peripheral electronic 
devices; is not readily discernible; and is highly sus-
ceptible to destruction. Other computer crime evidence 
may exist in the form of data reports, logs, programming 
or other printed information run from information in the 
computer. Latent prints may be found on the keyboard, 
mouse, power button or any other peripheral equipment 
near the computer.
 
Because chemicals used in processing ﬁ ngerprints 
can damage electronic equipment and data, latent prints 
should be collected after electronic evidence recovery is 
complete.
 
A backup of the hard disk contents should be made as 
quickly as possible. A portable hard drive duplication tool 
is available that lets investigators quickly create a mir-
ror image of one or more hard drives in the ﬁ eld without 
removing the original to a remote site.
 
Investigators must reproduce the material within the 
rules of evidence. Identiﬁ cation should include the case 
number, date, time and initials of the person taking the 
evidence into custody. To mark a metal container, use a 
carbide metal scribe such as that used in marking items 
in the Operation Identiﬁ cation program. Use a perma-
nent black-ink marker or felt-tip pen to identify disks. If 
the evidence is in a container, both the container and the 
inside disks should be identiﬁ ed in the same way. Marking 
both identically avoids interchangeability and retains the 
credibility of the item as evidence. Use normal evidence 
tape to mark containers and to seal them.
Avoid contact with the recording surfaces of computer 
tapes and disks. Never write on disk labels with a 
ballpoint pen or pencil or use paper clips or rubber 
bands with disks. To do so may destroy the data they 
contain.

522 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
large ISPs commonly maintain data for as long as 30 days, 
whereas others dump these records every 30 minutes. Data 
storage is a major expense for ISPs, and many try to save 
money by purging their ﬁ les fairly quickly. Th erefore, if a 
crime has involved Internet use, investigators should pro-
ceed quickly to subpoena the ISP for stored records. If the 
subpoena will take several days or longer to obtain, send 
a letter to the ISP requesting that they preserve the data 
until a subpoena, warrant or court order can be obtained.
 
Th ese records, once obtained, will provide such infor-
mation as the suspect’s billing address and log-in records, 
which can in turn lead to the location of the computer used, 
such as in a private residence, a public library or an Internet 
cafe. Although the billing information and credit card num-
bers associated with a user’s account can be falsiﬁ ed, this 
information may still be of value to the investigation. Once 
the suspect’s location is known, the investigation typically 
expands to involve another jurisdiction because the perpe-
trators of cybercrimes can be thousands of miles away from 
their victims and the investigation’s point of origin.
 
After the desired target information is culled from the 
general ISP data records, the investigator needs a search 
warrant to delve further into a particular user’s account 
information. Th ese ﬁ les are likely to include e-mails, Web 
site data, images, spreadsheets and other digital log ﬁ les 
that can help assess what activity the account is being 
used for.
 
Other tools available to cybersleuths are the Inter-
net pen register and Internet Title III Intercept, the 
use of which also requires court approval. Internet pen 
registers track transactions originating at the target’s 
computer and can reveal Web surﬁ ng habits and sites 
commonly visited, the types of applications being used 
and the e-mail addresses of those being communicated 
with. Title III Intercepts are similar in function to the 
Internet pen but trap more comprehensive data, allow-
ing investigators to see where the target is surﬁ ng, with 
whom the target communicates, and what the target 
sees, as well as to read the content of the target’s e-mail 
and chat messages.
 
Understanding how to decipher e-mail headers is 
a necessary skill for cyberinvestigators. Th e following 
guidelines are provided for tracing an Internet e-mail 
(Best Practices, 2006):
• • When an Internet e-mail message is sent, the user 
typically controls only the recipient line(s) (To, Cc and 
Bcc) and the Subject line.
• • Mail software adds the rest of the header information 
during processing.
• • Line (1) tells other computers who really sent the 
message and where to send error messages (bounces 
and warning).

“courtesy copy” recipients of the message. There 
may be “Bcc:” recipients as well; these “blind car-

headers.
Mobile Evidence Th e electronic memory devices within 
cell phones that store digital data have become an impor-
tant source of evidence for criminal investigators. Cell 
phone use may factor into an investigation involving any 
of the crimes discussed in this text.
 
Evidence on a mobile or cell phone system may be 
found on the communication equipment (the phone 
itself), the subscriber identity module (SIM), a ﬁ xed base 

CHAPTER 17 | Computer Crime | 523
and magnetic sources. Thus, investigators must use 
due diligence when packaging, transporting and stor-
ing the evidence. Furthermore, documenting these 
procedures is necessary for maintaining the chain of 
custody.
 
Before electronic evidence it is packaged, it must be 
properly documented, labeled, marked, photographed, 
video recorded or sketched and inventoried. All connec-
tions and connected devices should be labeled for easy 
reconﬁ guration of the system later. All digital evidence 
should be packed in antistatic packaging and in a way 
that will prevent it from being bent, scratched or oth-
erwise deformed. Only paper bags and envelopes, card-
board boxes and antistatic containers should be used. 
Plastic materials should not be used because plastic can 
produce or convey static electricity and allow humid-
ity and condensation to develop, which may damage or 
destroy the evidence. All containers should be clearly 
labeled. Cellular, mobile or smart phone(s) should be 
left in the power state (on or oﬀ ) in which they were 
found.
 
When transporting computer evidence, investiga-
tors should keep digital evidence away from magnetic 
ﬁ elds such as those produced by radio transmitters, 
speaker magnets and magnetic mount emergency lights. 
Store disks in the manufacturers’ containers, and store 
all computer evidence in areas away from strong sources 
of light. 
Store electronic evidence in a secure area away from 
temperature and humidity extremes and protected from 
magnetic sources, moisture, dust and other harmful 
particles or contaminants. Do not use plastic bags.
 
Also be aware of the time-sensitive nature of perish-
able data evidence. Potential evidence such as dates, times 
and system conﬁ gurations may be lost due to prolonged 
storage or the depletion of a device’s battery. Th erefore, 
when submitting such evidence for examination, notify 
the appropriate personnel that a device powered by bat-
teries needs immediate attention.
CRIME-SPECIFIC INVESTIGATIONS 
Several NIJ documents provide in-depth coverage of 
speciﬁ c computer crime investigations. Investigations 
Involving the Internet and Computer Networks (2007) 
provides in-depth explanations of investigations involv-
ing e-mail; Web sites; instant message services and chat 
rooms; ﬁ le sharing networks, network intrusion or 
denial of service; and bulletin boards, message boards 
and newsgroups. Electronic Crime Scene Investigation 
station, switching network, the operation and mainte-
nance system for the network and the customer manage-
ment system. It may also be possible to retrieve deleted 
items. Call data records (CDRs) obtained from the net-
work service provider are also very valuable as evidence, 
for they can reveal the location of the mobile phone user 
every time a call is sent or received.
 
Because of its digital nature, mobile evidence must 
be handled carefully, yet few standards have been widely 
implemented regarding how best to collect such evidence. 
Th e following guidelines are oﬀ ered for investigators col-
lecting wireless phones and electronic paging devices as 
evidence (Best Practices, 2006):
• • Wireless Telephones 
• Observe the On/Oﬀ  Rule
• If it is ON, leave it ON—turning oﬀ  a device that 
is on could activate a lockout feature.
• Write down the information on the display and 
photograph if possible.
• Power down the device before transport and take 
any power supply cords present. 
• If it is OFF, leave it OFF—turning it on could alter 
evidence on the device.
• Following seizure, get the device to an expert 
as soon as possible or contact the local service 
provider.
• If an expert is not available, use a diﬀ erent telephone 
and call 1-800-LAWBUST, a 24/7 service provided 
by the cellular phone industry.
• Attempt to locate any instruction manuals or other 
documents pertaining to the device.
• • Electronic Paging Devices
• Once the pager is no longer in proximity to the sus-
pect, turn it oﬀ .
• Continued access to electronic communication 
over a pager without proper authorization can be 
construed as unlawful interception of electronic 
communication.
• A search of the stored contents of the pager is 
allowed:
• Incidental to an arrest.
• With probable cause plus exception.
• With consent.
PACKAGING, TRANSPORTING AND STORING 
DIGITAL AND OTHER COMPUTER CRIME 
EVIDENCE
Computer evidence—electronic devices and the data 
contained within them—is fragile and sensitive to tem-
perature, humidity, physical shock, static electricity 

524 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
DATA ANALYSIS AND RECOVERY
In an ideal case, digital data on a seized computer’s hard drive 
or contained on other media such as diskettes, CDs or tapes 
is intact, unencrypted and has not been “deleted.” In these 
scenarios, the digital forensic examiner can simply retrieve 
the data and print it. Another place to look for evidence is 
in the computer’s recycle bin, as some less computer-savvy 
criminals might equate putting a ﬁ le in “the trash” with delet-
ing it. In many cases, however, the suspect has taken steps 
to hide evidence of criminal activity, such as through data 
encryption or steganography, installing booby traps or other 
destructive programs to keep outsiders from gaining access 
or by deleting ﬁ les. Sometimes computer evidence is dam-
aged through exposure to ﬁ re, water or physical impact.
 
Data recovery is a computer forensic technique that 
requires an extensive knowledge of computer technology and 
storage devices and an understanding of the laws of search 
and seizure and the rules of evidence, to be discussed shortly. 
Software programs can help investigators restore data on 
damaged hard drives or other computer media or recover 
information that has been deleted, or so the suspect thought.
 
 Modern operating systems often leave copies of 
“deleted” ﬁ les scattered about, in temporary directories, 
unallocated sectors and swap ﬁ les. 
Although deleted ﬁ les remain on the hard drive in a non-
viewable format, their existence hidden from most com-
puter users, the computer forensic expert knows where 
to look and how to make such ﬁ les viewable again.
 
Data remanence refers to the residual physical rep-
resentation of data that have been erased. In addition to 
recovering deleted material, a qualiﬁ ed computer forensic 
analyst may be able to recover evidence of the copying of 
documents, whether to another computer on the network 
or to some removable storage device such as a diskette; 
the printing of documents; the dates and times speciﬁ c 
documents were created, accessed or modiﬁ ed; the type 
and amount of use a particular computer has had; Inter-
net searches run from a computer; and more.
LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS IN 
COLLECTING AND ANALYZING 
COMPUTER EVIDENCE
Throughout the entire evidence collection and 
analysis processes, investigators and forensic 
technicians must adhere to strict standards if the evidence 
(2008) contains detailed discussions of electronic crime 
and digital evidence considerations by crime  category: 
child abuse or exploitation; computer intrusion; coun-
terfeiting; death investigation; domestic violence, 
threats and extortion; e-mail threats, harassment and 
stalking; gaming; identity theft; narcotics; online or 
economic fraud; prostitution; software piracy or tele-
communication fraud; and terrorism. For those inter-
ested in these in-depth discussions, search the Internet 
by their titles.
FORENSIC EXAMINATION OF 
COMPUTER EVIDENCE
Computer forensics carries the potential to 
beneﬁ t nearly every type of criminal investi-
gation: “In the last decade, computer forensics has qui-
etly resolved cases that would otherwise have gone 
unsolved. Considering that computers and digital devices 
capable of retaining data are ubiquitous in modern soci-
ety, and that criminals are using these devices with 
greater frequency, it shouldn’t be a surprise that com-
puter forensics is being used in more investigations. 
Computer forensics can provide evidence of motivation, 
a chronology of events, insight into an oﬀ ender’s inter-
ests and activities and links among multiple oﬀ enders” 
(Olien, 2007, p.24).
 
Crime laboratories, either public or private, have 
much of the equipment necessary to examine computer 
evidence. Computer hardware has individual character-
istics, much the same as other items of evidence, such 
as tools. Th e hardware might also contain ﬁ ngerprints, 
but frequently the perpetrator’s ﬁ ngerprints are not 
unusual because he or she has legal access to the hard-
ware. Printers have individual characteristics, much 
the same as typewriters. Document examinations of 
printouts can be made, and these printouts can be ana-
lyzed for ﬁ ngerprints. Fragments of software may be 
compared. And, as discussed, the entire ﬁ le content of 
a computer’s hard drive may be analyzed for incriminat-
ing text or images.
 
Because the skills required for some of today’s com-
plex digital and electronic forensic evidence examina-
tion are very technical and usually fall outside the realm 
of what is expected of the typical criminal investigator, 
this discussion will not delve too deeply into speciﬁ c tech-
niques required during such examinations but, rather, 
presents an overview of what happens to evidence once it 
is submitted to the lab.

CHAPTER 17 | Computer Crime | 525
should identify the problem and the crime or crimes 
committed. A suspect must be developed, as must other 
peripheral parties to the crime. Determine the areas 
involved in the crime, equipment used, internal and 
external staﬃ  ng needs, approximate length of time 
required for the investigation, a method of handling and 
storing evidence and the assignment of personnel. When 
developing a suspect, ascertain motive, opportunity, 
means of commission, the type of security system 
bypassed and known bypass techniques. It may be neces-
sary to conduct covert operations as part of the investi-
gation. In such cases, an oﬃ  cer with expert-level 
knowledge in cybercrime is a critical factor in achieving a 
successful resolution. It is also necessary to determine 
which federal, state or local laws apply to the speciﬁ c 
type of computer crime committed.
DEVELOPING SUSPECTS
A few decades ago, computer crime was the exclusive 
domain of a relatively small group of electronic geniuses 
whose incredibly specialized knowledge and programming 
skills aﬀ orded them unique opportunities to pry into indi-
viduals’ and corporations’ computers and steal money, 
trade secrets or other information of value. Today, how-
ever, cybercrooks are not such an elite bunch. Today’s 
global population of twenty-somethings and younger are 
often as proﬁ cient on the computer as they are with using 
a TV or cell phone.
 
A signiﬁ cant change from previous editions of this 
text is in the number of crimes committed by insiders ver-
sus outsiders. It used to be that most computer-related 
crimes against businesses and other organizations were 
committed by insiders because these people had the best 
access to the devices. With the expansion of the Internet, 
however, outsiders have gained increasing levels of access, 
to the extent that today most (80 percent) of electronic 
crimes are perpetrated by outsiders.
Most cybercrimes against businesses are committed by 
“outsiders.”
 
Th e 2007 E-Crime Watch Survey (2005) reports that of 
the 74 percent of businesses that were victims of virus, 
worms or other malicious code, 46 percent were inﬁ l-
trated by outsiders compared with 18 percent victim-
ized by insiders (in the remaining cases, the source of the 
attack was reported unknown). Of the 55 percent who 
reported being victims of unauthorized access to or use 
of information, systems or networks, 30 percent fell vic-
tim to outsiders compared with 25 percent victimization 
is to be of value in the courtroom. Individuals must testify 
in court to the authenticity of the disks, CDs or printouts. 
Th e materials must be proven to be either the originals or 
valid substitutes in accordance with the best-evidence 
rule. Th is evidence must be tied to its source by a person 
qualiﬁ ed to testify about it.
 
Besides adhering to authenticity standards, inves-
tigators must be alert to situations where the Privacy 
Protection Act (PPA) may be implicated. Under this 
act, with certain exceptions, it is considered unlawful 
for a government agent to search for or seize materi-
als possessed by a person reasonably believed to have 
a legitimate purpose for disseminating information to 
the public. For example, seizure of First Amendment 
materials such as drafts of newsletters or web pages may 
implicate the Privacy Protection Act (Electronic Crime 
Scene Investigations, 2008, p.7). Th e PPA’s prohibition 
on use of a search warrant does not apply in the follow-
ing circumstances (Investigations Involving the Internet, 
2007):
• • Materials searched for or seized are contraband, fruits 
or instrumentalities of the crime.
• • Th ere is reason to believe that the immediate seizure 
of such materials is necessary to prevent death or seri-
ous bodily injury.
• • Probable cause exists to believe that the person pos-
sessing the materials has committed or is committing 
a criminal oﬀ ense to which the materials relate.
 
Th e NIJ also cautions ﬁ rst responders seizing elec-
tronic devices that improper access of data stored within 
may violate provisions of certain federal laws, including 
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Th e recom-
mended course of action, should this be a concern, is to 
consult the local prosecutor before accessing stored data 
on an electronic device (Electronic Crime Scene Investiga-
tion, 2008, p.7).
 
An evolving area of legal wrangling concerns copy-
right laws and investigative agencies that seize computers 
that have an operating system installed on them, as most 
do. Operating systems, which are copyright protected, 
may not be copied without the author’s, or in this case the 
software company’s, expressed permission. 
FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION
Once the initial report has been completed and 
the general information has been obtained, a 
plan is made for the remaining investigation. Th e plan 

526 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
• Most computer criminals, although commonly 
active in a social underground, commit their crimi-
nal acts alone.
• A smaller percentage of cybercriminals will exist 
in organized groups, such as corporate spies and 
organized crime groups.
Three general categories of cybercriminals are 
crackers, vandals and criminals. Motivations vary, 
from the cracker’s need for an intellectual challenge, 
to the vandal’s urge to cause damage, to the criminal’s 
desire for ﬁ nancial or other personal gain.
 
Th e 2007 Internet Crime Report (2008) found that per-
petrators were predominantly male (75.8 percent) and half 
resided in one of the following states: California, Florida, 
New York, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Georgia. 
Most reported perpetrators were from the United States. 
However, a signiﬁ cant number of perpetrators also were 
located in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, Canada, Roma-
nia and Italy. Most perpetrators were in contact with 
the complainant through either e-mail or via the Web. 
Th ese statistics highlight the anonymous nature of the 
Internet.
 
Normal or special audit procedures may have 
brought a computer crime to the attention of the proper 
persons, as in embezzlement cases. Because computer 
operations require contact with other employees in col-
lecting computer-input information, suspicion develops 
when employees appear to withdraw from other normal 
relationships.
 
Overloading of the computer system or a lack of 
accessibility to records that the system was designed for 
may indicate illegal use of the computer, a crime that 
occurs more frequently in small computer operations, 
where greater opportunity exists. However, this makes an 
investigator’s task easier because the number of suspects 
is reduced.
 
Th e suspect may act alone or in collusion in commit-
ting the crime. In cases of internal abuse, commission 
normally occurs during authorized use or during peri-
ods of overtime when the employee is working alone. 
Developing a suspect’s work history assists in locat-
ing past opportunities for committing the oﬀ ense. Th e 
suspect’s training will provide information about his or 
her knowledge of computers and computer languages. 
Comparisons of these factors with the equipment at the 
crime scene will help determine whether the suspect was 
capable of the crime.
 
A complete review of everyone within the organiza-
tion who has access, their type of access and their technical 
by insiders. Of the 53 percent of businesses victimized by 
illegal generation of spam, 38 percent of the cases were 
committed by outsiders compared with 6 percent by 
insiders. Th e only crimes committed more frequently by 
insiders than by outsiders were theft of proprietary infor-
mation including customer records, ﬁ nancial records, and 
so forth; theft of intellectual property; and intentional 
exposure of private or sensitive information. 
 
Although anyone with the requisite know-how can 
take up a life of cybercrime, the FBI and other organiza-
tions that have been compiling records on the perpetra-
tors of cybercrime have developed a sort of cybercriminal 
proﬁ le of characteristics these individuals are likely to 
exhibit:
• • A cybercriminal will likely fall into one of three 
categories:
• Crackers (hackers): motivated by achieving prohib-
ited access; inspired by boredom and the desire for 
intellectual challenge; no real damage done
• Vandals: motivated to cause damage and as much 
harm as possible; are often disgruntled, either at 
their employer or at life and society in general
• Criminals: motivated by economic gain; use espio-
nage and fraud, among other tactics, to accomplish 
their goals
• • Cybercriminals can generally be classiﬁ ed by organiza-
tion level
Gary McKinnon, 39, of North London enters the Bow Street 
Magistrates Court on July 27, 2005, for an extradition hearing. He is 
wanted by the U.S. government for illegally accessing and making 
unauthorized modiﬁ cations to 53 computers belonging to NASA, the 
Pentagon, the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and the Department of 
Defense, causing $1 million worth of damage. McKinnon is believed 
to be the world’s biggest military computer hacker. As of October 
13, 2008, he had lost every appeal extended against extradition and 
was expected to be turned over to United States judicial authorities 
soon. (© Getty Images)

CHAPTER 17 | Computer Crime | 527
and surveillance. Many law enforcement agencies have 
found success in applying to cybercrime the same tac-
tics used in the 1980s to crush organized crime—infor-
mants and the cyberspace equivalent of wiretaps (Grow, 
2005).
UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATION AND 
SURVEILLANCE
Sometimes it is necessary to develop an undercover 
operation to further the investigation. This operation 
must be headed by a computer expert and coordinated 
with the nonsuspects. Lists must be prepared of all 
individuals to be used in the case and the evidence to be 
obtained. Undercover work can be used in nearly every 
aspect of cybercrime. As with undercover work in the 
real world, investigators must be sensitive to entrap-
ment issues and to undercover involvement with crimi-
nal activity.
 
Covert investigation including ongoing surveil-
lance operations is a method being used to gather evi-
dence against cybercrime gangs. Undercover tactics are 
also commonly used in cases of online child pornogra-
phy and sexual exploitation. An officer will go online, 
undercover, into predicated locations and, using a 
fictitious screen name and profile, pose as a child or 
teenager and engage in real-time chat or e-mail con-
versations with subjects to obtain evidence of criminal 
activity. Investigations of specific Internet locations 
can be initiated through a citizen complaint, a com-
plaint by an ISP or a referral from another law enforce-
ment agency (“Innocent Images,” 2003).
SECURITY OF THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT’S COMPUTERS
When considering computer crime, law enforce-
ment oﬃ  cers should not overlook the possi-
bility that their own computers may be accessed by 
criminals. Any computer attached to a phone line is 
accessible by unauthorized people outside the depart-
ment, even thousands of miles away on a diﬀ erent con-
tinent. Considering the critical nature of law enforcement 
data and communications, such as systems that control 
computer-aided dispatch, records management applica-
tions and oﬀ ender databases, ensuring the security of 
an agency’s network should be a top priority. Law 
enforcement departments cannot aﬀ ord to have their 
capability or opportunity greatly assists the investigation 
if the crime is internal. Check for employees who have a 
history of computer crimes.
 
Investigators will often ﬁ nd that computer-related 
thefts originate from agencies that already have highly 
trained computer personnel on staﬀ . If the theft is inter-
nal, the investigator may conﬁ dentially involve per-
sonnel of that agency who are not suspect. In internal 
crimes of this nature, the number of suspects will neces-
sarily be limited, compared with a crime such as a resi-
dential burglary, in which the suspect could be a local or 
an outsider. In computer crimes for theft, supervisory 
and management personnel may use computers to hide 
their oﬀ enses and then misdirect the investigative team 
toward subordinate staﬀ  who have committed relatively 
minor transgressions.
 
Internal auditing procedures are normally started 
with the security director involved. If an employee is sus-
pected at this point, management must decide whether to 
handle the matter internally or proceed with prosecution. 
If the decision is to handle the matter internally, then the 
case is closed. If not, the investigation continues, often 
involving state or private investigators. Such individuals 
may have the expertise and anonymity not available to 
local police departments.
ORGANIZED CYBERCRIME GROUPS 
Most cybercriminals work alone. However, on occasion 
these individuals may come together for a common crim-
inal endeavor. Th ey generally are not Maﬁ a-style organi-
zations and usually lack any real loyalty to one another. 
Th e transitional nature of these cybercrime rings makes 
prosecution an eﬀ ective tool against such groups and 
sends a message of deterrence to other online criminals, 
who, because of the anonymity involved with Internet 
communications, often do not know who they are really 
dealing with.
 
Although cybercriminal rings have not historically 
been formally structured like traditional organized 
crime, a few hacker groups have been observed to have 
a Maﬁ a-like hierarchy, with virtual godfathers map-
ping strategy, capos issuing orders and soldiers carrying 
out the dirty work. Some cybergangs have evolved into 
highly organized criminal enterprises whose member-
ship and illegal activities span the globe. Particularly 
challenging are cases involving cybergangs that operate 
in countries with weak hacking laws and lax enforce-
ment, such as Russia, Eastern European countries and 
China. 
 
An eﬀ ective tactic being used to apprehend orga-
nized cybercrime networks is undercover investigation

an abducted 14-year-old girl to her family. Th e PATRIOT 
Act was reauthorized in 2006 for 5 more years.
 
Other federal statutes relevant to computer-related 
crimes include patent laws, espionage and sabotage laws, 
trade secret laws, the Copyright Act of 1976 and the 
Financial Privacy Act of 1978. In 1998, the Child Pro-
tection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act was passed 
after members of Congress cited horror stories involving 
sexual predators making initial contact with young chil-
dren through the Internet.
 
In the past decade, all 50 states have enacted tough 
computer crime control laws. States address computer 
crime either by modifying existing statutes such as those 
pertaining to theft or by adding computer crime chapters 
to their criminal codes. For example, to address the grow-
ing problem of cyberstalking, some states have amended 
their traditional stalking laws to include threats transmit-
ted via the Internet. Phishing schemes are likely to vio-
late various existing state statutes on fraud and identity 
theft and several federal criminal laws. Th ose who phish 
may be committing identity theft (18 U.S.C. §1028(a)(7)), 
wire fraud (18 U.S.C. §1343), credit card or “access-device” 
fraud (18 U.S.C. §1029), bank fraud (18 U.S.C. §1344), 
computer fraud (18 U.S.C. §1030(a)(4)) and the newly 
enacted criminal oﬀ enses delineated in the CAN-SPAM 
(Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography 
and Marketing) Act (18 U.S.C. §1037). Transmission of 
computer viruses and worms may be prosecuted under the 
federal provisions of the computer fraud and abuse stat-
ute relating to damage to computer systems and ﬁ les (18 
U.S.C. §1028(a)(5)). Th ese federal criminal oﬀ enses can 
carry substantial penalties and ﬁ nes, with convictions for 
wire fraud and bank fraud earning the oﬀ ender as many 
as 30 years in prison and the possibility of ﬁ nes as high as 
$250,000, plus forfeiture of the defendant’s property.
 
Well-deﬁ ned statutes are critical to investigating 
and prosecuting computer crimes successfully, and the 
area of cyber law is rapidly evolving. Lawmakers are chal-
lenged, however, by the complex nature of the technol-
ogy and nontraditional jurisdictional concerns, elements 
that complicate the eﬀ ort to deﬁ ne cybercrime and cyber-
crooks. Th rough it all, cybercrime investigators must stay 
on top of the ever-changing body of state and federal law 
regarding electronic crimes.
THE INVESTIGATIVE TEAM
Criminals around the world have their sticky ﬁ n-
gers poised at the keyboard, prepared to click 
their way into places they don’t belong and steal. Th e 
evidence logs hacked or have reports and other valuable 
data hijacked in a system takeover following a virus 
attack.
LEGISLATION
With the proliferation of online child pornogra-
phy, phishing and other crimes involving the 
computer, legislation has necessarily been developed to 
address the problem. For example, in 1986, President 
Reagan signed a bill to modernize the federal wiretap law 
to protect the privacy of high-tech communications. Th is 
bill makes it illegal to eavesdrop on electronic mail, video 
conference calls, conversations on cellular car phones and 
computer-to-computer transmissions.
 
However, following the September 11, 2001, trag-
edy and the realization that the terrorists had used the 
Internet and other electronic means to communicate and 
coordinate their plans, the government took measures to 
allow law enforcement greater latitude in its surveilling of 
electronic communication if there is a reasonable suspi-
cion that such activity involves terrorism. On October 26, 
2001, President George W. Bush signed the USA PATRIOT 
Act (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing 
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct 
Terrorism), a major piece of legislation consisting of 
more than 150 sections, many of which pertain to elec-
tronic communications and other areas of cybercrime 
investigation.
 
Th e act made several amendments to the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978, such as 
granting “roving” authority to FBI and other law enforce-
ment agents to more eﬃ  ciently serve orders on commu-
nications carriers and thus meet the challenges posed by 
individuals who rapidly switch telephone carriers, cell 
phones or Internet accounts as a way of evading detection 
and thwarting surveillance.
 
Th e PATRIOT Act also changed key features of exist-
ing National Security Letter (NSL) protocol. NSLs are a 
type of subpoena issued in foreign counterintelligence 
and international terrorism investigations to obtain 
records under the statutory authority of the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act (telephone and ISP records), 
the Right to Financial Privacy Act (ﬁ nancial institution 
records) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (records from 
credit bureaus). Th e act expanded signature authority for 
NSLs to increase the eﬃ  ciency and eﬀ ectiveness of pro-
cessing such subpoenas. Recently, the “Emergency Disclo-
sure of E-Mail and Records by ISPs” provision of the act 
helped law enforcement to quickly track down and restore

network intrusion, I.D. theft, forgery/fraud, gangs, 
counterterrorism and oﬃ  cer-involved shootings,” 
says Auturo Montes, a detective working computer 
crimes detail for the Long Beach (California) Police 
Department. . . . “I think we’ll see more agencies creat-
ing their own forensic units in the future, but budgets 
are a problem. . . . Th ese units make all the diﬀ erence in 
the world to law enforcement,” Montes says. “Without 
us, evidence would go uncovered. I think a unit like 
ours is completely necessary to any agency. Without 
one, you have your hands tied behind your backs. 
Having a dedicated computer crimes unit is not cheap, 
but it will deﬁ nitely be invaluable to the department, 
investigators, and the D.A.” 
 
An article by the New York State Police (2007, p.54) 
provides an example of how investigators from the com-
puter crime unit found digital evidence in a felony investi-
gation that seemingly had nothing to do with computers:
Local police investigating a homicide in Upstate New 
York during 2005 found a weird combination of evi-
dence in the home of the chief suspect: an old, war-relic 
hatchet, a note written in Italian, and a personal com-
puter. Investigators from the New York State Police 
(NYSP) Computer Crimes Unit (CCU) were called in 
to see if they could shed any light on the puzzle. Th eir 
analysis of the PC showed the online search engines 
Google and Ask had been used to research methods of 
committing a homicide. A review of the Web sites the 
suspect had visited disclosed several that featured 
Italian-Maﬁ a axe murders with letters left behind. 
Combining this information and a timeline of the 
searches, CCU members were able to provide evidence 
supporting premeditation, invalidating several spuri-
ous defense theories, and leading to a conviction for 
second-degree murder.
 
Th e Illinois State Police’s Internet Crimes Unit (ICU) 
has helped address the growing need for law enforce-
ment to eﬀ ectively respond to and investigate computer 
crime: “Anyone in the law enforcement ﬁ eld knows how 
diﬃ  cult it can be to investigate these crimes, not to 
mention the additional resources and personnel needed. 
To address these needs, the Illinois State Police estab-
lished one of the nation’s largest state teams dedicated 
to Internet crime. Th e unit consists of 10 oﬃ  cers, eight 
crime analysts, and seven computer forensic investiga-
tors” (Gordon, 2008, p.89). Gordon adds, “Contrary 
to typical crimes where jurisdictions are usually clear, 
online investigations could have more than one ongo-
ing investigation with each agency unaware of the other. 
Th e ICU will not be reactive in nature, but will actively 
search the Web for criminal activity. Th e unit will also 
perform the needed forensics to assist in the successful 
prosecution of Internet crimes, from identity theft, to 
rising tide of Internet activity has washed ashore an 
increasing variety of old crimes in new bottles and shows 
no signs of ebbing. To handle this challenge, many depart-
ments have formed cybercrime investigative teams com-
prising various specialists, similar to the approach taken 
in cases involving complex art thefts, bank embezzle-
ments, narcotics traﬃ  cking or other types of crime in 
which a generalist investigator has little expertise. 
Investigating computer crime often requires a team 
approach.
 
Th e investigative team is responsible for assigning 
all team personnel according to their specialties, includ-
ing securing outside specialists if necessary; securing the 
crime scene area; obtaining search warrant applications; 
determining the speciﬁ c hardware and software involved; 
searching for, obtaining, marking, preserving and stor-
ing evidence; obtaining necessary disks, printouts and 
other records; and preparing information for investigative 
reports. In most computer-related crimes, investigators 
seek assistance from the victim who owns the equipment, 
database processing technicians, auditors, highly trained 
computer experts or programmers and others. If neces-
sary, the team should contact the manufacturer of the 
equipment, the consulting services of a private computer 
crime investigative agency, or the technology resources 
found at local universities and other institutions of higher 
learning.
 
Mills-Senn (2006, p.17) describes the evolution of 
computer crimes units:
Law enforcement agencies and private nonproﬁ ts like 
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 
(NCMEC) are increasingly relying on computer crimes 
units (or as some are called, high-tech or E-crimes 
units) and experts to answer questions and to assist 
with investigations that run the gamut from fraud to 
murder to child exploitation/pornography. . . .
 
Th ese units are relatively new to law enforcement—
probably the longest established have been around 10 
years at the most. But they’ve matured pretty rapidly.
 
Over the course of around seven or eight years, 
they’ve gone from one to two people working on eco-
nomic-based crimes—this was the only target element 
at the time because it was typically only business people 
who had computers, they were not commonly found in 
people’s homes—to what they are today.
 
High-tech crimes units may have started out inves-
tigating economic crimes, but they’ve moved deep into 
other investigative territories. Consider the following 
comment from an investigator within these units:
 
“I have assisted on homicides, burglaries, robber-
ies, sex crimes, threatening/harassing e-mail, stalking, 

530 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
 
One mandate of the USA PATRIOT Act was that the 
Secret Service establish a nationwide network of Elec-
tronic Crimes Task Forces (ECTFs). Th e ECTF network 
brings together federal, state and local law enforcement, 
as well as prosecutors, private industry and academia. 
Th e common purpose is the prevention, detection, miti-
gation and aggressive investigation of attacks on the 
nation’s ﬁ nancial and critical infrastructures (U.S. Secret 
Service, 2008). Th e U.S. Secret Service oﬀ ers numerous 
services to its ﬁ eld agents, including technical assistance 
in developing cybercrime cases, help in preparing search 
warrants involving electronic storage devices, labora-
tory analysis of and courtroom testimony regarding 
the evidentiary contents of electronic storage devices 
and educational seminars for law enforcement oﬃ  cers 
nationwide.
 
Th e Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Sec-
tion of the DOJ maintains a Web resource for law enforce-
ment (www.cybercrime.gov) and is a one-stop resource for 
everything related to computer crime. Th e site oﬀ ers a col-
lection of documents and links to other sites and agencies 
that may help prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute 
cybercrime.
 
Other resources include the Computer Crime Research 
Center and the Electronic Evidence Information Center.
PERVERTED JUSTICE—CITIZEN SLEUTHS
Perverted Justice is an Internet-based organization whose 
volunteers pose as young kids, then trawl the Internet 
for predators (Garrett, 2007, p.12). Founded in 2002 by 
Xavier Von Erck, Perverted Justice has the resources to 
spend hundreds of hours on a single case, with volunteers 
able to chat all hours of the day and night. Volunteers 
undergo an in-depth background check and are exten-
sively trained in setting up a proﬁ le, charting online steg-
anography, Web cam transmission and documentation, 
sending audio ﬁ les, building evidence packets, submitting 
evidence to law enforcement, audio authentication, mak-
ing police statements and the like. Perverted Justice vol-
unteers have worked with police to collar more than 157 
criminals (Garrett, p.17).
CYBERANGELS
The CyberAngels Cyber Crime Unit (CCU) is devoted 
to assisting victims of cybercrime: “The CCU is not a 
group of vigilantes or law enforcement wannabes. 
It is not going to track down, hack or engage any of 
the alleged perpetrators. Nor does it conduct stings in 
chat rooms. The fundamental role of the CCU team is 
to help victims help themselves. If a crime has been 
fraud, to exploitation from sexual predators and every-
thing in between.”
 
To assist in combating increasing computer crimes, 
government and private businesses are developing com-
puter crime teams similar to the FBI’s kidnapping crime 
teams and the arson investigation specialist teams of the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
Th e FBI’s Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) 
helps state and local law enforcement as well as federal 
agents. CART helps write and execute search warrants, 
seize and catalog evidence and perform routine exami-
nations of digital evidence. 
 
In addition to CART, investigators working cyber-
crime cases may seek assistance from a growing pool of 
resources, both domestic and international.
RESOURCES AVAILABLE
Police agencies in many states are forming 
cooperative groups and providing training 
seminars on investigating computer crimes. Such 
groups are especially helpful for small departments, 
which are less likely to have the needed expertise in-
house. For example, Florida’s law enforcement agen-
cies can submit computer evidence to the Computer 
Evidence Recovery (CER) program, which also trains 
the state’s law enforcement agencies to prepare war-
rants to search computers and to follow specific proce-
dures when seizing computer crime evidence.
 
Training in computer crimes investigation is also 
available from other sources. Working in partnership 
with state, local, federal and international law enforce-
ment agencies, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) 
has developed the National Cybercrime Training Part-
nership (NCTP) to develop and promote a long-range 
strategy for high-tech police work, including interagency 
and interjurisdictional cooperation, information net-
working and technical training; to garner public and 
political understanding of the problem and generate 
support for solutions; and to serve as a proactive force 
to focus the momentum of the entire law enforcement 
community to ensure that proposed solutions are fully 
implemented. Th e NCTP is open to any law enforcement 
agency involved in electronic crime investigation, pros-
ecution or training.
 
Another resource to help law enforcement han-
dle computer crimes is the IC3. Th e IC3 provides to 
cybercrime victims a convenient, user-friendly report-
ing mechanism that notiﬁ es authorities of suspected 
violations.

CHAPTER 17 | Computer Crime | 531
• • Evidence can consist of tape backups and printouts. 
Th ese should be initialed by the person obtaining the 
evidence. Evidence should be retained in a locked cabi-
net with access limited to one person.
• • Keep a record of resources used to reestablish the 
system and locate the perpetrator.
 
One of the most important, yet most frequently over-
looked, security measures is to use a paper shredder for 
all sensitive documents once they are no longer needed. 
Another technique gaining momentum in the eﬀ ort to 
increase computer security is biometrics, using physical

to the appropriate law enforcement authority” (Schef-
fler, 2006, p.34).
PREVENTING COMPUTER 
CRIME
Although computers and related technologies 
have added immeasurable beneﬁ ts and value 
to our quality of life, this technology has opened up new 
avenues of crime and exploitation. One reason computer 
crime has proliferated among businesses in the private 
sector is that many managers are unprepared to deal with 
it. Th ey may be ignorant, indiﬀ erent or both. Th ey also 
frequently lack control over their information. Without 
standards to violate, there is no violation.
Computer crimes can be prevented by educating top 
management and employees and by instituting internal 
security precautions. Top management must make a 
commitment to defend against computer crime.
 
Management must institute organization-wide 
policies to safeguard its databases and must educate 
employees in these policies and any security measures 
implemented. Management should also take internal 
security precautions: Firewalls and virus protection are 
two safeguards for computers. Data disks and CDs should 
have backup copies and be kept in locked ﬁ les. Th e FBI’s 
National Computer Crime Squad suggests the following 
procedures for computer users to institute, both before 
becoming a computer crime victim and after a violation 
has occurred:
• • Place a log-in banner to ensure that unauthor-
ized users are warned that they may be subject to 
monitoring.
• • Turn audit trails on.
• • Consider keystroke-level monitoring if the adequate 
banner is displayed.
• • Request trap and tracing from your local telephone 
company.
• • Consider installing caller identiﬁ cation.
• • Make backups of damaged or altered ﬁ les.
• • Maintain old backups to show the status of the 
original.
• • Designate one person to secure potential evidence.
Technology Innovations
The National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children, the Internet Crimes against Children Task 
Force and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America have 
created an Internet safety and awareness program 
called NetSmartz:
The concept was developed to help parents, 
educators, and law enforcement ofﬁ cers teach 
children from an early age how to avoid dangers 
online. The NetSmartz program strongly advocates 
open communication and sharing in the family 
setting while providing an understanding of poten-
tial troubles that exist in the online world. The 
NetSmartz program consists of four PowerPoint 
presentations that have been created as educa-
tional tools for law enforcement and educators. 
Substantial research and testing went into devel-
opment to ensure they are all age appropriate. The 
program uses a multimedia approach combining 
talking points and videos of real-life children shar-
ing stories of the situations they found themselves 
in as a result of risky online activity. . . .
To complement its presentations, the 
 NetSmartzkids.org Web site has been developed 
for the youngest Internet users. It’s a safe Web 
site for kids to play and learn on. NetSmartzkids.
org features games, puzzles, songs, activity cards, 
and videos designed to teach kids how to be safer 
online. The children absorb the message while 
having fun.
In addition to the NetSmartzkids.org Web 
site, there is another site, NetSmartz.org for teens, 
parents, educators, and law enforcement. All of the 
NetSmartz resources are available free to the 
public. (Kerlikowske and Wilson, 2007, p.52)

attackers from penetrating a system’s perimeter defenses 
and reaching a target’s internal database. If a hack is 
detected, CIDDAC is notiﬁ ed immediately and begins 
analyzing the incident. Th ey can track the origin of the 
attack and notify the target, in real time, that an intru-
sion is being attempted. 
NATIONAL STRATEGY TO SECURE 
CYBERSPACE 
Besides individuals and companies, the entire U.S. popula-
tion faces risk of victimization by cybercriminals because 
of our increasing reliance on information technology and 
the role computers play in many aspects of our daily lives: 
“Th e United States is increasingly vulnerable to cyberat-
tacks that could have catastrophic eﬀ ects on critical phys-
ical infrastructure, and severely damage the country’s 
economic, military, and strategic interests” (Bain, 2008).
Our nation’s critical infrastructures are composed of 
public and private institutions in the sectors of agri-
culture, food, water, public health, emergency services, 
government, defense industrial base, information and 
telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking 
and ﬁ nance, chemicals and hazardous materials, and 
postal and shipping. Cyberspace is their nervous 
system—the control system of our country. Cyberspace 
is composed of hundreds of thousands of intercon-
nected computers, servers, routers, switches, and ﬁ ber 
optic cables that allow the critical infrastructures to 
work. Th us the healthy functioning of cyberspace is 
essential to the United States economy and national 
security. (National Strategy, 2003)
 
Cyberattacks on any part of this infrastructure could 
lead to tremendous loss of revenue and intellectual prop-
erty and to loss of life. For these reasons, the scope of 
cybercrime, even if undetermined, has the potential to 
cause extreme damage.
characteristics the user cannot lose or give away, includ-
ing facial, voice and ﬁ ngerprint recognition.
 
Computer crimes also plague and persist among pri-
vate American citizens because, like corporate managers, 
they remain uninformed about how to protect them-
selves. One of the most common ways home users become 
victims of cybercrime is through phishing or other scams 
devised to get computer users to relinquish sensitive 
information.
 
In addition to eﬀ orts such as the preceding, McGruﬀ , 
the Crime Dog, has joined the ﬁ ght against cybercrime. 
Th e National Crime Prevention Council and others have 
joined forces to bring together one of the largest and most 
inﬂ uential coalitions of private and public companies, the 
primary goal of which is to teach millions of consumers 
how to identify, report and protect themselves against 
cybercrime (“Take a Byte,” 2006). 
 
In addition, individuals learning how to protect 
against computer crime victimization, businesses need 
to become more proactive. CIO Magazine, the FBI and the 
U.S. Secret Service have collaborated to produce guide-
lines for how businesses should plan for and respond to 
attacks on information systems, including viruses, hacks 
and other breaches. Th e guidelines suggest that chief 
information oﬃ  cers (CIOs) and business leaders establish 
a relationship with law enforcement now, before the next 
attack occurs.
 
Finally, the U.S. Secret Service contends that 
law enforcement must take a proactive approach to 
cyberthreats and that prevention coupled with aggressive 
proactive investigations deliver the best outcome in 
the ﬁ ght against cybercrime. Th e Cyber Incident Detec-
tion and Data Analysis Center (CIDDAC) is one initia-
tive helping law enforcement protect the private-sector 
networks that control 85 percent of the country’s tech-
nological infrastructure. CIDDAC uses real-time cyber-
attack detection sensors, or RCADS, to prevent outside

the vandal’s urge to cause damage, to the criminal’s desire 
for ﬁ nancial or other personal gain.
 
Investigating such crimes often requires a team 
approach. Computer crimes can be prevented by educat-
ing top management and employees and by instituting 
internal security precautions.

CHECKLIST
Computer crimes are relatively easy to commit and diﬃ  cult 
to detect, and most are not prosecuted. Computer-related 
crimes may be categorized as computer as target, com-
puter as tool or computer as incidental to the oﬀ ense.
 
Special challenges in investigating computer crime 
include victims’ reluctance or failure to report such 
crimes, the investigator’s lack of training and the lack of 
understanding of computer crimes by others within the 
justice system, the need for specialists and teamwork, the 
fragility of the evidence and jurisdictional questions.
 
A common protocol for processing a crime scene 
involving electronic evidence is as follows:
 1. Secure and evaluate the crime scene.
 2. Obtain a search warrant. 
 3. Recognize and identify the evidence.
 4. Document the crime scene.
 5. Collect and preserve evidence.
 6. Package, transport and store evidence.
 7. Document the investigation in an incident report.
 
A basic tenet for ﬁ rst responders at computer crime 
scenes is to observe the ON/OFF rule: If it’s on, leave it 
on. If it’s oﬀ , leave it oﬀ . If investigators possess a search 
warrant and want to conduct a search, they should ﬁ rst 
request permission for the search. If consent is given, the 
search can proceed right away. If it is not given, then the 
warrant can be served and the search conducted.
 
Digital evidence is often contained on disks, CDs or hard 
drives, or on any number of peripheral electronic devices; is 
not readily discernible; and is highly susceptible to destruc-
tion. Other computer crime evidence may exist in the form 
of data reports, logs, programming or other printed infor-
mation run from information in the computer. Latent 
prints may be found on the keyboard, mouse, power button 
or any other peripheral equipment near the computer.
 
Investigators who handle computer disks should 
avoid contact with the recording surfaces. Never write on 
computer disk labels with a ballpoint pen or pencil, and 
never use paper clips on or rubber bands around com-
puter disks, for to do so may destroy the data they con-
tain. Store electronic evidence in a secure area away from 
temperature and humidity extremes and protected from 
magnetic sources, moisture, dust and other harmful par-
ticles or contaminants. Do not use plastic bags.
 
Although deleted ﬁ les remain on the hard drive in a 
nonviewable format, their existence hidden from most 
computer users, the computer forensic expert knows where 
to look and how to make such ﬁ les viewable again.
 
Most cybercrimes against businesses are committed 
by “outsiders.” Th ree general categories of cybercriminals 
are crackers, vandals and criminals. Motivations vary, 
from the cracker’s need for an intellectual challenge, to

A. (From “Marijuana Buyers Club Sets Up Site on Inter-
net,” Las Vegas Review Journal, November 14, 1996, p.14E.)
 
After voters in one state approved a proposition legal-
izing marijuana use “for medicinal purposes,” an Internet 
site began oﬀ ering marijuana to severely ill or disabled 
people who need it, requiring proof of a doctor’s recom-
mendation to use marijuana. Th e site’s director states, “I 
don’t want people trying to order marijuana without the 
proper authorization. I’m really trying to do this in keep-
ing with the proper spirit of [the proposition].”
 
A police sergeant from the jurisdiction from which 
the marijuana is being shipped contends the operation is 
clearly illegal. “Along with supplying and selling marijuana, 
which are felonies, I imagine you could cook up something 
extra for using the Internet,” he said. Th e site is receiving 
orders from all over the state, as well as from people out-
side the state who are using in-state mailing addresses.
Questions
 1. What crime is being committed, if any?
 2. Who has jurisdiction?
 3. What steps would you take to conduct this 
investigation?
 4. How would you prepare a search warrant?
 5. What types of evidence would you look for?
B. A local ﬁ rm contacts your police department con-
cerning theft of customer credit card and Social Security 
numbers from their computer records. Th is operation and 
theft are suspected to be internal, so present and past 
employees are the prime suspects.

538 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
 
Organized crime is heavily involved in the drug trade, 
and many drug cartels, particularly Latino ones, are struc-
tured and operated much like other crime syndicates. 
Th us, these two investigative challenges are discussed in 
this chapter. Keep in mind, however, that the two topics, 
while overlapping, are also separate. Organized crime is 
involved in many more activities than just drug traﬃ  ck-
ing, and drug-related crimes, though sometimes linked to 
organized crime, are usually committed by other groups 
and individuals with no mob associations. Another facet 
of these two crime problems to be aware of is the response 
and involvement of diﬀ erent jurisdictional levels. Federal 
law enforcement has devoted substantial investigative 
resources to both the illegal drug trade and organized 
crime. In most cases, however, local law enforcement ﬁ rst 
detects these problems and opens the cases.
he violence inspired by drug-related and orga-
nized crime activities translates into mur-
ders, arsons, drive-by shootings, car bombs and other 
acts that threaten and terrorize communities across the 
country. Drug gangs have turned many communities 
into virtual war zones. Sometimes these acts are gang 
reprisals or witness intimidation; others are designed 
simply to frighten innocent citizens enough to ensure 
that they refrain from calling the police. Similarly, orga-
nized crime groups have inﬁ ltrated some communities 
to the point where the people looked upon as leaders and 
role models, or as guardians of the law, have become cor-
rupt themselves.
T
THE THREAT OF DRUGS
American history is ﬁ lled with drug use, includ-
ing alcohol and tobacco. As the early settlers 
moved west, one of the ﬁ rst buildings in each frontier 
town was a saloon. Cocaine use was also common by the 
1880s. At the beginning of the 20th century, cocaine was 
the drug of choice, said to cure everything from indiges-
tion to toothaches. It was added to ﬂ avor soft drinks such 
as Coca-Cola.
 
In 1909, a presidential commission reported to Presi-
dent Th eodore Roosevelt that cocaine was a hazard, lead-
ing to loss of livelihoods and lives. As the public became 
increasingly aware of the hazards posed by cocaine and 
other drugs, it pressed for legislation against use of such 
drugs.
In 1914, the federal government passed the Harrison 
Narcotics Act, which made the sale or use of certain 
drugs illegal.
 
In 1920, every state required its students to learn 
about narcotics’ eﬀ ects. In 1937, under President Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt, marijuana became the last drug to 
be banned. For a quarter of a century, the drug problem 
lay dormant.
 
Th en came the 1960s, a time of youthful rebellion, of 
Haight Ashbury and the ﬂ ower children, a time to protest 
the Vietnam War. A whole culture had as its theme, tune 
in, turn on and drop out—often through marijuana and 
LSD. By the 1970s, marijuana had been tried by an esti-
mated 40 percent of 18- to 21-year-olds and was being 
used by many soldiers ﬁ ghting in Vietnam. Many other 
soldiers turned to heroin. At the same time, an estimated 
half million Americans began using heroin back in the 
States.
 
Th e United States became the most drug-pervaded 
nation in the world, with marijuana leading the way. Th e 
1980s saw a turnaround in drug use, with celebrities 
advocating, “It’s not cool to do drugs,” and “Just say no 
to drugs.” At the same time, however, other advertise-
ments suggested that alcohol and smoking are where the 
“fun is.” 
SERIOUSNESS AND EXTENT OF 
THE DRUG PROBLEM
An estimated 19.1 million Americans age 12 years 
and older currently use illicit drugs. Drug addic-
tion and the crime it engenders weigh heavily on American 
society and pose a formidable challenge for law enforce-
ment: “Th e traﬃ  cking and abuse of illicit drugs are a great 
burden on citizens, private businesses, ﬁ nancial institu-
tions, public health systems, and law enforcement agencies 
in the United States. Th ese burdens are manifested and 
measured in many ways; however, the most striking evidence 

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 539
of the impact of drug traﬃ  cking and abuse on U.S. society is 
the thousands of drug-related deaths (overdoses, homicides, 
accidents, or other fatal incidents) that occur each year” 
(National Drug Th reat Assessment, 2007).
 
An increasing threat is posed by drug traﬃ  cking orga-
nizations (DTOs), complex entities with highly deﬁ ned 
command-and-control structures that produce, trans-
port and distribute large quantities of one or more illicit 
drugs: “Mexican DTOs are the most pervasive organiza-
tional threat to the United States. Th ey are active in every 
region of the country and dominate the illicit drug trade 
in every area except the Northeast. Other Mexican DTOs 
are gaining a foothold in northeastern drug markets, 
where they previously had little inﬂ uence” (National Drug 
Th reat Assessment, 2007). Other ﬁ ndings reported in the 
National Drug Th reat Assessment include
• • Asian DTOs and criminal groups based in Canada 
have emerged as signiﬁ cant producers, transporters 
and distributors of high-potency marijuana and 
3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA) 
to drug markets in the United States.
• • Columbian, Dominican, Cuban and Jamaican DTOs 
serve as major transporters and distributors of illicit 
drugs in the United States.
 
Especially disturbing is the violence connected with 
the Mexican drug cartels, with drug violence from Mexico 
spilling into the United States, the brutality giving rise to 
formidable new problems for both countries (Roig-Franzia, 
2008a, p.A20). Conﬂ ict between rival cartels and the fed-
eral government has taken more than 7,000 lives in the 
past two and a half years (Roig-Franzia, 2008b, p.A09). 
In addition, Mexico’s drug cartels have taken a barbarous 
turn—targeting bystanders.
 
Although the drug problem remains a serious issue, 
encouraging data are found in Monitoring the Future 2007 
(MTF), a report by the University of Michigan’s Institute 
for Social Research that summarizes the ﬁ ndings of annual 
surveys of 8th-, 10th- and 12th-grade students through-
out the United States: “Eighth, tenth and twelfth grad-
ers across the country are continuing to show a gradual 
decline in the proportions reporting use of illicit drugs” 
(Johnston et al., 2007). According to MTF, from 2001 to 
2007,
• • Use of any illicit drug has dropped 24 percent.
• • Marijuana use has decreased 25 percent.
• • Steroid use has dropped by a third.
• • Ecstasy use is less than half of what it was in 2001 (54 
percent decline).
• • Use of methamphetamine has plummeted a stagger-
ing 64 percent.
• • Th ere are 860,000 fewer young people using drugs 
today than in 2001.
• • Use of alcohol, including binge drinking and ciga-
rette smoking have decreased by 15 and 33 percent 
respectively.
 
In the 2007 World Drug Report, the United Nations 
Oﬃ  ce on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) found that U.S. 
production of and markets for illicit drugs continue to 
decrease, reﬂ ecting both increased law enforcement 
eﬀ orts and a large shift of drug production from South 
America to Mexico.
 LEGAL DEFINITIONS
Most narcotics laws prohibit possessing, trans-
porting, selling, furnishing or giving away nar-
cotics. Possession of controlled substances is probably the 
most frequent charge in narcotics arrests. Actual or con-
structive possession and knowledge by a suspect that a drug 
was illegal must be shown. If the evidence is not on the per-
son, it must be shown to be under the suspect’s control. 
 
Th e legal deﬁ nitions of narcotics and controlled sub-
stances as stated in local, state and federal laws are lengthy 
and technical. Th e laws deﬁ ne the terms that describe the 
drugs, the various categories and the agencies responsible 
for enforcement.
 
Laws generally categorize drugs into ﬁ ve schedules 
of controlled substances, arranged by the degree of dan-
ger associated with the drug, with Schedule I drugs being 
the most dangerous (see Table 18.1). Th e ﬁ ve schedules 
contain the oﬃ  cial, common, usual, trade and chemical 
names of the drugs. Th e laws also establish prohibited 
acts concerning the controlled substances and assign pen-
alties in ratio to the drug’s danger. Basically, these laws 
state that no person, ﬁ rm or corporation may manufac-
ture, sell, give away, barter or deliver, exchange, distribute 
or possess these substances with intent to do any of the 
prohibited acts. 
It is illegal to possess or use narcotics or dangerous 
drugs without a prescription and to sell or distribute them 
without a license.
 
Speciﬁ c laws vary by state. For example, possessing 
a small amount of marijuana is a felony in some states, 
a misdemeanor in others and not a crime at all in a few 
states. Laws also deﬁ ne the type of activity drug traﬃ  ck-
ers are involved in and can be used to impose criminal 
sanctions even when the intended act is unsuccessful.

instant access to concise monographs about thousands of 
commonly prescribed drugs.
 
A reference considered by many in law enforcement to 
be easier and faster to use than the PDR is the Drug Iden-
tiﬁ cation Bible. Th e revised, expanded 2004/2005 edition 
contains more than 1,100 full-color actual-size photos 
of prescription drugs scheduled by the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration (DEA); tablet and capsule imprints 
for more than 14,000 prescription and over-the-counter 
(OTC) drugs; hundreds of photos of drug packaging and 
paraphernalia; sources, methods of use, purity levels and 
street prices for all major illicit drugs; and updated street 
slang to help oﬃ  cers understand the language of the drug 
culture. For example, “A” is a street name for LSD. “Abe” 
means $5 worth of a drug.
IDENTIFICATION AND 
CLASSIFICATION OF 
CONTROLLED DRUGS
The sale of prescription drugs, the fastest-growing 
category of drugs being abused, has skyrocketed 
since 1990. Consequently, a major challenge for law enforce-
ment oﬃ  cers is to recognize and identify drugs found in a 
suspect’s possession. Because of the countless diﬀ erent 
types, colors, sizes, trade names and strengths of commercial 
drugs, many oﬃ  cers rely on a pharmaceutical reference book, 
the Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR), used widely by health 
care providers. It is the basis for mobile PDRTM software

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 541
 
Stimulants and depressants are controlled under the 
Drug Abuse Control Amendments to the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (U.S. Code Title 21).
The most commonly observed drugs on the street, in 
possession of users and seized in drug raids are cocaine, 
codeine, crack, heroin, marijuana, morphine and opium. 
Arrest for possession or use of marijuana is the most 
frequent drug arrest.
 
Figure 18.1 provides a threat matrix for ﬁ ve com-
monly encountered drugs including the source and tran-
sit countries, primary entry points into the United States 
and domestic wholesale and retail price ranges.
POWDER COCAINE AND CRACK
Cocaine and its derivative, crack, are major problems for 
law enforcement oﬃ  cers, with crack consistently being 
ranked as the drug with the most serious consequences 
(Pulse Check, 2004, p.9). Crack, also called rock or crack 
rock, is produced by mixing cocaine with baking soda 
and water, heating the solution in a pan and then dry-
ing and splitting the substance into pellet-size bits or 
chunks. Crack is generally less expensive than powder 
cocaine.
 
Crack is most often smoked in a glass pipe and has 
ten times the impact of cocaine. It is described as “cocaine 
intensiﬁ ed or ampliﬁ ed” in its eﬀ ects on the human body. 
Th e intense high produced by crack is usually followed 
by a severe depression, or “crash,” and a deep craving for 
more of the drug. It is more addictive than cocaine, at a 
much earlier stage of use, sometimes after the ﬁ rst use. 
Some users “space-base” the drug; that is, they lace it with 
PCP or other drugs. PCP causes out-of-control behavior, 
an added hazard to the already dangerous eﬀ ects of crack 
itself.
 
For the past two decades, the cocaine supply in the 
United States has been controlled by the Colombian 
Medellin and Cali maﬁ as. Th e U.S.–Mexico border is the 
primary point of entry for cocaine into the United States, 
with an estimated 77 percent of the national supply arriv-
ing via the Mexico–Central America corridor.
HEROIN
Heroin, a commonly abused narcotic, is synthesized from 
morphine and is as much as 10 times more powerful in 
its eﬀ ects. It is physically addictive and relatively expen-
sive. Heroin can be injected, smoked or snorted, with 
intravenous injection producing the greatest intensity 
 
In the absence of a printed ﬁ eld guide or reference 
book, street drugs can be identiﬁ ed with a narcotic ﬁ eld-
test kit. Identiﬁ cation via ﬁ eld testing, however, can be 
tricky: “Most of [these drugs] are pills or powders that 
could be pure, uncut dope or baking soda, marijuana or 
oregano, and the people that market them aren’t widely 
known for their reverence of truth in labeling” (Dees, 2008, 
p.74). Several brands of self-contained, single-use test kits 
are available that reduce the likelihood of user error and 
require very small samples: “Between the variations of sim-
ilar-looking drugs and the quantity of fake or ‘bunk’ drugs 
found by street oﬃ  cers, it’s unwise to rely solely on appear-
ance or packaging to form probable cause for an arrest. 
Th ese tests are reliable and inexpensive” (Dees, p.79). Oﬃ  -
cers must understand, however, that ﬁ eld testing cannot be 
used to establish probable cause, only conﬁ rm it. Probable 
cause, through observation and evaluation of other factors, 
must already exist before a substance can be ﬁ eld-tested. 
For example, an undercover oﬃ  cer who buys a small bag of 
white powder from a suspected cocaine dealer has estab-
lished probable cause and may run a substance-speciﬁ c ﬁ eld 
test for cocaine. Oﬃ  cers must be properly trained in how to 
use these ﬁ eld-testing kits to ensure accurate results and to 
avoid sample contamination or waste and reduce liability 
concerns associated with false arrests based on faulty test-
ing procedures.
 
Knowing the street terms for various drugs, drug par-
aphernalia and drug-related activity is also beneﬁ cial to 
the drug investigator. Th e Oﬃ  ce of National Drug Control 
Policy (ONDCP) maintains a street-term database with 
more than 2,300 entries referencing current street slang 
for drug types, the drug trade, drug cost and quantities 
and drug use.
 
Drugs are commonly classiﬁ ed as belonging in one of 
the following groups:
• • Central nervous system depressants (alcohol, 
barbiturates, tranquilizers)
• • Central nervous system stimulants (cocaine, 
amphetamines, methamphetamine)
• • Narcotic analgesics (heroin, codeine, methadone, 
meperidine [Demerol], OxyContin)
• • Hallucinogens (LSD, PCP [angel dust], peyote, 
psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, AMT, DXM and Foxy)
• • Cannabis (marijuana, hashish, hash oil)
• • Inhalants (hobby model glue, cleaning solvents, 
lighter ﬂ uid, aerosols)
Drugs can be classiﬁ ed as depressants, stimulants, 
 narcotics, hallucinogens, cannabis or inhalants.

Overall Key Findings 
• Mexican criminal groups exert more influence over drug trafficking in the United States than any other group. Mexican criminal groups smuggle most of the cocaine available in domestic drug    
  markets into the country. Moreover, Mexican criminal groups produce and subsequently smuggle into the country much of the heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine available in the U.S. 
  drug markets. 
• Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) appear to be gaining control of a larger percentage of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. The estimated percentage of cocaine smuggled  
  into the United States via the Mexico–Central America corridor increased sharply from 72 percent in 2002 to 77 percent in 2003, and preliminary data indicate that the percentage may be higher  
  than 90 percent for 2004. 
• Domestic drug markets appear to be increasingly supplied with methamphetamine produced in methamphetamine superlabs in Mexico.
• Production and distribution of ice methamphetamine—a higher purity, more addictive form of methamphetamine—by Mexican criminal groups has increased sharply over the past 2 years in  
  many drug markets. 
• Colombian DTOs are increasingly relying on Mexican DTOs and criminal groups to transport South American heroin to the United States much as they rely on Mexican DTOs to transport cocaine. 
• The threat posed to the United States by the illegal diversion and abuse of prescription drugs has increased sharply since the mid-1990s and is now among the leading drug threats to the country. 
• Law enforcement reporting indicates that transportation of bulk currency out of the United States—primarily overland across the U.S.–Mexico border—is the principal form of money laundering  
  by DTOs.

variously classiﬁ ed as a narcotic,1 a depressant,2 and a

joint, herb, Mary Jane, mj, reefer and weed. Th e Federal 
Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 outlawed its use. 
 
Marijuana is the most controversial of the illicit drugs, 
and a wide spectrum of opinion exists regarding its harm-
fulness. Some feel it should be legalized; others think it 
and most rapid onset of euphoria, usually within 7 or 
8 seconds. Heroin that is sniﬀ ed or smoked takes longer 
to enter the bloodstream (10 to 15 minutes), but these 
methods have increased in popularity because of the 
availability of high-purity heroin and the growing fear of 
sharing needles.
MARIJUANA
Marijuana is the most widely available and most com-
monly used illicit drug in the United States, with 14.6 
million current users (6.2 percent of the population). It is 
1Narcotic: a drug that is physically and psychologically addicting; examples 
include heroin, morphine, codeine and cocaine.
2Depressant: a drug that reduces restlessness and emotional tension and 
induces sleep; most common are the barbiturates.
3Hallucinogen: a mind-expanding drug.

is a very dangerous drug. Many opponents of legalizing 
marijuana contend that it is a “gateway” drug, exposing 
new and curious experimenters to a fairly benign drug 
that will eventually lead them to explore other, “harder” 
chemical substances. Whether marijuana users progress 
to hard narcotics or other controlled substances has not 
been thoroughly researched. Most hard-narcotics users 
once used marijuana, but how many marijuana users pro-
ceed to hard drugs is unknown.
 
In the never-ending quest to enhance their high, some 
users lace marijuana with other substances, including 
PCP, cocaine, and even embalming ﬂ uid, or formaldehyde, 
stolen from funeral homes or university labs. Marijuana 
laced with PCP or embalming ﬂ uid, called “wet” marijuana, 
will likely cause hallucinations, euphoria and, sometimes, 
panic or violence.
 
Mexican commercial-grade marijuana is the most 
common variety, but “BC Bud,” marijuana from British 
Columbia, generally has a higher concentration of the 
active substance tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and thus 
greater potency, and has become more sought after (Pulse 
Check, 2004, p.9). According to the National Drug Th reat 
Assessment (2008), domestic production of marijuana has 
increased, partly because more U.S.–based Mexican crimi-
nal groups are setting up large-scale cultivation operations, 
principally in the Paciﬁ c and Appalachian states.
 
Large quantities of marijuana are being grown 
hydroponically indoors, often in abandoned barns or 
other buildings in rural areas. Such controlled cultiva-
tion increases marijuana potency by 3 to 10 times, which 
increases its value and thus the growers’ proﬁ ts. Known as 
sinsemilla, homegrown marijuana has become extremely 
popular, and indoor marijuana-growing operations have 
proliferated, domestically and abroad. 
METHAMPHETAMINE
Methamphetamine is now ﬁ rmly entrenched as a major 
U.S. drug problem that is only getting bigger. Metham-
phetamine is a highly addictive synthetic stimulant that 
looks like cocaine but is made from toxic chemicals, such 
as drain cleaner, paint thinner and other easily obtained 
OTC products, including cold medications containing 
pseudoephedrine.
 
Concocting crank, a street name for methamphet-
amine, is relatively simple and inexpensive. Typical meth 
users are high school and college students and working-class 
white men and women. A tweaker is a methamphetamine 
addict; a meth cook is someone who produces the drug.
 
Th e most common form is powder meth, which is usu-
ally injected or snorted but can also be ingested orally or 
smoked. Other forms include ice meth, which resembles 
shards of ice, is usually smoked and is highly pure and very 
addictive; and methamphetamine tablets, commonly the 
size of a pencil eraser, which are typically ingested orally 
or smoked, but can also be crushed and snorted or mixed 
with water and injected.
 
Many sources report the particularly devastating 
eﬀ ect meth is having on America’s rural communities, 
where much of the production and abuse occurs and where 
law enforcement and public health oﬃ  cials lack adequate 
resources to eﬀ ectively address the growing problems.
 
A chemical additive, GloTell, can identify those who 
handle anhydrous ammonia fertilizer, a common ingredi-
ent in producing methamphetamine. GloTell leaves bright 
pink stains on the skin and clothes of anyone who comes 
in contact with the fertilizer and is detectable with black 
light as long as 72 hours after exposure. Th e additive also 
impedes the production process of meth by making the 
drug very diﬃ  cult to dry. 
Once a person is addicted, it can be extremely difﬁ cult for him or 
her to quit using drugs without special intervention and treatment.

through a hypodermic needle. (© Arthur Turner / Alamy)

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 545
it became used as a way to facilitate sexual assault, hence 
the tag “date-rape drug.” Once it was learned that Rohyp-
nol was being slipped into unwary victims’ drinks as an 
aid for committing sexual assault, the manufacturer of 
the drug reformulated it to increase its detectability in 
clear ﬂ uid and to retard its dissolution rate. 
GHB Another drug used to commit sexual assault is 
gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, a colorless, odor-
less, slightly salty liquid or white powder. It is taken 
orally and costs $5 to $20 per dose (capful or ounce). 
Investigating cases involving GHB may be very challeng-
ing, and investigators have started referring to it as a 
“stealth drug” because of the diﬃ  culty in detecting its 
use. Because GHB causes unconsciousness, victims may 
be unable to provide much useful information to inves-
tigators regarding any attack that may have occurred fol-
lowing ingestion of the drug.
Ketamine A prescription general anesthetic primar-
ily marketed for veterinary use, ketamine or “special 
K,” is sold as both a liquid and a powder. In humans, it 
causes some physical eﬀ ects similar to PCP and visual 
eﬀ ects like LSD. At low dosage, ketamine impairs atten-
tion, learning ability and memory. At higher doses, it 
can produce delirium, impaired motor function, high 
blood pressure, depression and potentially fatal respira-
tory problems (Community Drug Alert Bulletin, 2004). Its 
amnesiac eﬀ ects have reportedly led to its use as a date-
rape drug.
CLUB DRUGS
Club drugs are those drugs commonly found at raves, 
dance parties that feature fast-paced, repetitive electronic 
music and light shows. Rave culture also uses a range of 
licit and illicit drugs. Although tobacco and alcohol are the 
most common substances found at the club scene, other 
substances such as Ecstasy, Rohypnol, GHB and LSD have 
gained popularity with young people. Methamphetamine 
has also been increasingly used at raves.
Ecstasy 
3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine 
(MDMA), known more commonly as Ecstasy or XTC, is a 
powerful stimulant derivative of amphetamine, or speed. 
MDMA is considered a moderate threat in the United 
States, with reported levels of availability and abuse 
trending downward. Increased interdiction eﬀ orts and 
the dismantling of large MDMA traﬃ  cking organizations 
are credited as the major reasons for decreased use and 
availability.
Rohypnol A second club drug that has made news in 
the past is the “date-rape” drug, Rohypnol, also known 
as “rooﬁ es.” Available by prescription outside the United 
States, Rohypnol is a central nervous system depressant 
10 times more potent than Valium. Th e drug by itself 
can produce extreme lethargy and signiﬁ cant reduction 
in the brain’s recall ability. Combined with alcohol, it 
causes memory loss, blackouts and disinhibition. Because 
Rohypnol was originally colorless, odorless, and tasteless, 
Two jars of methamphetamine in the beginning stages of 
production. The jar with the cloudy solution has not been treated 
with GloTell. The pink one has been treated with GloTell, a 
compound that renders the ﬁ nished product known as “Meth” into 
a gooey unusable substance.

This image shows how the treated methamphetamine glows pink 
under a black light, revealing why GloTell is so named. Anyone or 
anything that has come in contact with the GloTell-treated meth 
will also glow pink when exposed to black light.

546 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
LSD LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), a Schedule I Con-
trolled Substance with severe penalties for possession and 
use, is a potent hallucinogen derived from lysergic acid, a 
fungus that grows on rye and other grains. Often referred 
to as acid on the club scene, it is clandestinely manufac-
tured in relatively professional laboratory settings because 
some chemistry background and a working knowledge of 
laboratory control are generally necessary to safely and 
successfully synthesize the drug. Th e initial synthesis pro-
duces a crystalline powder, which is then reduced to a liq-
uid and placed onto blotting paper. LSD can also be sold in 
tablet or capsule form.
2C-B or Nexus An emerging drug threat is 2C-B, also 
known as Nexus, an illicit, synthetic Schedule I hallucino-
gen. Th e eﬀ ects of the drug vary based on dosage, with a 
small increase in dose capable of producing a radically diﬀ er-
ent and unpredictable, potentially violent, reaction. In low 
doses (4 mg), the eﬀ ects resemble those of MDMA; higher 
doses (20–30+ mg) produce extremely frightening, LSD-
type hallucinations and morbid delusions (2C-B Reappears, 
p.4). Some users combine 2C-B with other club drugs, with 
a 2C-B + MDMA combination referred to as a “party pack,” 
and 2C-B mixed with LSD called a “banana split.”
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
Prescription drug abuse has become a nationwide epi-
demic. Pain relievers, such as Vicodin, Percodan, Percocet 
and OxyContin, top the list of abused prescription drugs. 
Other commonly abused prescription drugs include tran-
quilizers such as Xanax and Valium, stimulants and Via-
gra. Marijuana, the illicit drug which has previously and 
pervasively been the most popular drug with teen, has 
lately taken a backseat to the nonmedical use of pain 
relievers, with surveys showing more initiates (ﬁ rst-time 
users) in recent years of these pain relievers than mari-
juana (Wethal, 2008, p.88).
 
Prescription drug diversion occurs by faking, forg-
ing or altering a prescription; obtaining bogus prescrip-
tions from criminal medical practitioners; or buying drugs 
diverted from health care facilities by personnel. Phar-
macy thefts are increasing nationwide to feed the growing 
demand for prescription drugs. Th e rising cost of prescrip-
tion drugs has also enticed senior citizens to join in the 
diversion and sell their prescriptions. Prescription drugs 
are also obtained through a practice called doctor shopping. 
A doctor shopper will visit multiple health care providers 
as a “new patient” or “visiting from out of town,” and will 
exaggerate or feign medical problems to obtain prescrip-
tive medications.
 
Garrett (2006a, p.72) observes, “Rising to meet the 
demands of the growing number of addicts are rogue 
online pharmacies, where individuals can buy anything 
and everything from prescription pain medications and 
analgesics to stimulants—without a prescription.” She 
(2006b, p.66) stresses, “When investigating online pre-
scription drug diversion cases, the old saying, ‘It’s not 
what you know, but who you know’ rings true. Networking 
with other local, state and federal law enforcement agen-
cies and health oﬃ  cials can make or break a big case.”
 
Frequently involved in prescription fraud are narcot-
ics, stimulants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tranquil-
izers and other psychoactive substances manufactured 
for use in legitimate medical treatment. Law enforcement 
oﬃ  cers spend a signiﬁ cant amount of time investigating 
cases involving prescription fraud, many of which also 
involve insurance, Medicare or Medicaid fraud.
OxyContin OxyContin is a pain medication derived 
from opium with heroin-like eﬀ ects and is used in treat-
ing pain related to cancer and other debilitating diseases. 
OxyContin is intended to be swallowed whole, providing 
a long-acting, time-release formula for pain relief, the 
subtlety of which is not popular among abusers. Instead, 
abusers chew it, melt it to inject intravenously or crush 
the tablet and snort it.
INHALANTS
Although many drugs have shown steady or declining 
numbers of users during the past few years, inhalant use 
has increased. More than 1,000 household and commer-
cial products can be inhaled to produce a high: adhesives, 
aerosols, anesthetics, cleaning agents, gases and solvents. 
Methods used to inhale include sniﬃ  ng or snorting the 
inhalant directly from the container, huﬃ  ng the chemical 
from a saturated piece of cloth held ﬁ rmly to the nose and 
mouth and bagging the inhalant by spraying or pouring it 
into a plastic or paper bag and holding the opening over 
the nose and mouth.
KHAT
Khat (pronounced “cot”), a natural narcotic whose primary 
psychoactive ingredients are chemically similar to amphet-
amines, is a relative newcomer to the U.S. drug scene but 
is well known in eastern African and southern Middle 
Eastern countries, some of which consider it a legitimate 
and quite proﬁ table export (Crenshaw and Burke, 2004, 
p.10). Th e drug is harvested from the leaves of the khat 
tree. Users either chew the leaves or smoke the powder 
obtained from dried leaves. Cathinone, one of the main 
chemicals in khat, is a Schedule I narcotic in the United 
States and is regulated by law. Observers note that the ris-
ing use of khat in the United States appears to coincide

with the increased numbers of immigrants coming from 
eastern African and Middle Eastern countries. It is legal in 
some of those nations, and many immigrants are unaware 
of khat’s illegal status in this country (Crenshaw and 
Burke, p.12).
OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DRUGS
Some teens are turning to legal OTC drugs for their 
highs, mistakenly assuming that if something is legal 
and readily available, it can’t be dangerous, or at least 
not deadly. Youths have their own language to describe 
the methods used to get these “legal highs.” Drink-
ing bottles of cough syrup, such as Robitussin DM, to 
get high is called robotripping. Skittling, so named 
because the pills resemble small, red pieces of Skittles 
candy, is ingesting high doses of Coricidin Cough and 
Cold (“Triple C”) tablets. Perhaps the riskiest and most 
hazardous practice of all is pharming—riﬂ ing through 
the family medicine cabinet for pills, both OTC and pre-
scription, combining everything in a bowl, scooping out 
and ingesting a handful and waiting to see what happens. 
When groups of youth get together and combine their 
respective medicinal booty, it is called a pharm party.
 
OTC drugs taken in excessive quantities for their 
psychoactive eﬀ ects fall into three general categories: 
uppers, downers and all-arounders. Th e most popular 
upper is pseudoephedrine, a main ingredient in nasal 
decongestants such as Sudafed. Benadryl Allergy formula 
is the top downer choice. Th e biggest all-arounder is 
dextromethorphan, also called DXM or Dex, a primary 
ingredient in cough and cold medicines. DXM, often pur-
chased over the Internet, has been linked to numerous 
overdose deaths.
 
Because these drugs are legal, law enforcement 
requires a more proactive approach to the problem, such 
as educating youths and their parents and networking 
with professional organizations such as the American 
Pharmacists Association, public health departments and

OTHER NARCOTICS AND DRUGS
Designer drugs are created by adding to or omitting 
something from an existing drug. In many instances, the 
primary drug is not illegal. Th e illicit drugs are called ana-
logs of the drug from which they are created—for exam-
ple, meperidine analog or mescaline analog. Th ese drugs 
may cause the muscles to stiﬀ en and give the appearance 
of someone suﬀ ering from Parkinson’s disease. Because 
designer drugs are diﬃ  cult for amateurs to manufacture, 
they are high-proﬁ t drugs for dealers. Because of their 
complex natures, these drugs must be submitted to a 
laboratory for analysis.
 
Table 18.2 summarizes the various narcotics and dan-
gerous drugs. Pay special attention to each drug’s eﬀ ects.

alcohol, especially if they are driving. Th ey are not always 
so able to recognize drug-impaired individuals. However, 
Drug Evaluation Classiﬁ cation (DEC) programs, more 
commonly known as Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) 
programs, have demonstrated international success in 
detecting and deterring drug-impaired driving. Th e Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) sets DRE 
program guidelines, and the National Highway Traﬃ  c 
Safety Administration (NHTSA) supports the program’s 
operation.
 
If an oﬃ  cer suspects a driver is impaired, the oﬃ  cer 
begins his or her assessment by using the standard ﬁ eld 
sobriety tests. If impairment is noticeable, the subject is 
given a breath test. If the blood alcohol reading is incon-
sistent with the perceived impairment, a DRE evaluates 
the individual’s appearance, performance on psychologi-
cal tests, eyes and vital signs.
 
Th e initial interview includes questions about the sub-
ject’s behavior; response to being stopped; attitude and 
demeanor; speech patterns; and possible injury, sickness 
or physical problems. Physical evidence such as smok-
ing paraphernalia, injection-related material and needle 
marks on the subject is sought.
 
Th e physical examination includes an eye examination, 
an improved walk-and-turn test, the Rhomberg Stand-
ing Balance test and the one-leg stand test, as well as the 
ﬁ nger-to-nose test. Also tested are vital signs (blood pres-
sure, pulse rate and temperature) and muscle rigidity. If 
warranted, a toxicological examination is also conducted.
 
A pupilometer allows oﬃ  cers to inexpensively conduct 
sobriety checks in the ﬁ eld. Th is lightweight, handheld bin-
ocular-type instrument measures absolute pupil dynamics 
to presumptively detect alcohol, drugs, inhalants or fatigue 
in a suspect. If the pass/fail indicators show green, the per-
son is not under the inﬂ uence of any substances. Yellow 
suggests the person may be under the inﬂ uence and that 
further testing is warranted. Red indicates the person is 
deﬁ nitely under the inﬂ uence. Th e name of the potential 
substance appears next to the pass/fail indicator along 
with the percentage probability level.
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF POSSESSION OR USE 
OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
Th e suspect’s clothing may conceal drugs, which have 
been found in neckties, shirt collars, coat and pants lin-
ings and seams, shoe tongues, soles of shoes or slippers, 
hat or cap bands and, naturally, pockets. Suspects are usu-
ally strip-searched because drugs can be concealed in any 
body opening including the rectum or vagina, in the hair, 
behind the ears and between the toes. Drugs can also be 
attached to the body with tape.
INVESTIGATING ILLEGAL 
POSSESSION OR USE OF 
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
If you observe someone using a narcotic or 
other dangerous drug, you may arrest the per-
son and seize the drugs as evidence. Th e arrested person 
may be searched incidental to the arrest. If a vehicle is 
involved but the suspect was not in the vehicle, post a 
guard at the vehicle or impound it. Drugs found on a per-
son during a legally conducted search for other crimes 
may also be seized, and additional charges may be made.
 
Take the suspect into custody quickly. Th en make 
sure the suspect does not dispose of the drugs by swal-
lowing them, putting them between car seat cushions or 
placing them in other convenient hiding places. While in 
custody, the suspect may experience withdrawal pains 
and other bodily ills that can create special problems for 
the arresting oﬃ  cers.
 
In drug crimes, the victims are implicated; thus, 
they usually avoid contact with the police, conspiring 
with the sellers to remain undetected. If apprehended 
and faced with charges, however, the drug addict may 
be willing to work with the police. Th erefore, many drug 
investigations involve identifying those who buy drugs 
illegally and who can thus provide information about 
sources of supply.
RECOGNIZING THE DRUG ADDICT: 
DRUG-RECOGNITION EXPERTS
Congress has deﬁ ned a drug addict as “any person who 
habitually uses any habit-forming narcotic drug so as to 
endanger the public morals, health, safety or welfare, or 
who is or has been so far addicted to the use of habit-
forming narcotic drugs as to have lost the power of self-
control with reference to the addiction.” Drug addiction is 
a progressive disease. Th e victim uses increased amounts 
of the same drug or harder drugs. Each increase in habit 
has a corresponding cost increase—thus the frequent 
necessity for committing crime. In addition, as the addic-
tion increases, the ability to control the habit decreases. 
Drug addicts become unﬁ t for employment as their 
mental, emotional and physical condition deteriorates. 
Because addicts often help each other obtain drugs, exer-
cise extreme caution when addicts are in jail, to prevent 
visitors from getting drugs to them.
 
Police oﬃ  cers are adept at recognizing and legally 
charging individuals who are under the inﬂ uence of 

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 551
 
Objects in the suspect’s possession can also contain 
drugs, depending on the suspect’s ingenuity. Cigarette cases, 
lighters, holders and packages, as well as chewing-gum wrap-
pers, fountain pens, jewelry, eyeglass cases, lockets, pencil 
erasers and many other objects can conceal illegal drugs.
 
Vehicles have innumerable hiding places, including 
under seat covers; behind cushions or seats; in heater 
pipes, hubcaps or glove compartments; under ﬂ oor 
mats; in false auto batteries and oil ﬁ lters; and in secret 
compartments devised for great amounts of smug-
gled drugs. Put the vehicle on a hoist and examine the 
undercarriage.
 
In a residence or building, do not give the suspect a 
chance to ﬂ ush the toilet or turn on the water in a sink 
to destroy evidence. Look for drugs in drawer bottoms, in 
fuse boxes, in bedposts, behind pictures, in tissue boxes, 
in overhead light ﬁ xtures, under rugs and carpets, in and 
under furniture and in holes in walls. If you ﬁ nd evidence, 
attempt to locate the property owner and inform him or 
her of the arrest. Gather all correspondence addressed to 
the person arrested if it is not in a mailbox. Obtain rent 
receipts, utility bills and other evidence that establishes 
that the suspect resides at that location.
 
One initial problem is identifying the suspected sub-
stance. As noted earlier, pharmaceutical manuals and 
physicians’ desk manuals provide information needed 
to identify various drugs. Field tests can be conducted 
to serve as the basis for a search warrant, but such tests 
must always be veriﬁ ed by laboratory examination. A

residue-detection swab can be used to test surfaces for 
traces of cocaine. Investigators simply wipe the swab 
across the area to be tested, and if cocaine residue is pres-
ent, the swab instantly turns color. Individually wrapped 
in foil packaging, these swabs are easy to carry and to use 
and have a relatively long shelf life.
 
If evidence of narcotics or other dangerous drugs is 
found on an arrested suspect, as a result of a search of 
the premises or even by accident, immediately place it in a 
container, label it and send it to a laboratory. If it is already 
in a container, leave it there and process the container for 
ﬁ ngerprints. Package uncontained drug evidence care-
fully to avoid a challenge to its integrity as evidence. Use 
special precautions to avoid contaminating or altering the 
drugs by exposure to humidity, light or chemicals.
Physical evidence of possession or use of controlled
substances includes the actual drugs, apparatus 
 associated with their use, the suspect’s appearance 
and behavior and urine and blood tests.
 
Often found along with drugs are various types of pipes, 
syringes, cotton, spoons, medicine droppers, safety pins, 
razor blades, hypodermic needles and the like—common 
components of a drug addict’s “outﬁ t.”

few minutes in this lethal condition can lead to cardiac 
arrest and sudden in-custody death (Ho, 2005, p.50).
 
Occasionally, a suspect in a drug case will attempt 
to hide or destroy evidence by ingesting it, which could 
lead to an in-custody overdose death. In an eﬀ ort to avoid 
arrest, subjects have also been known to swallow entire 
packages or bags containing drugs, which results in their 
suﬀ ocating or choking to death. Using restrictive restraint 
devices and procedures, such as handcuﬃ  ng subjects 
behind their back and placing them facedown, can lead to 
positional asphyxia. According to one study, 53 percent of 
the people who die suddenly while in police custody have 
used illicit substances proximal to their collapse.
INVESTIGATING ILLEGAL 
SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
Because addiction depends on drug availability, 
drug control must be directed toward the sup-
plier. Th is is often a joint eﬀ ort among law enforcement 
agencies at all levels. Drug users and sellers know the local 
police, so it is diﬃ  cult to mount undercover or surveillance 
profuse perspiration provide additional evidence of drug 
use. Table 18.3 lists indicators.
 
To establish that an arrested person is under the inﬂ u-
ence of drugs, urine and blood tests, a medical examina-
tion and a report of personal observations are used along 
with an alcoholic or drug-inﬂ uence test form.
IN-CUSTODY DEATHS
Hundreds of people die each year in the United States 
while in police custody, often without any obvious reason 
or explanation. Sometimes the cause is a medical condi-
tion; other times, it is a consequence of drug use. Most of 
the time, it is a combination of factors.
 
One serious problem that may be encountered in 
dealing with drug users is excited delirium, which may 
occur in people under the inﬂ uence of an illicit stimulant 
substance such as cocaine or in people with a history of 
mental illness who are not taking their medications. Th e 
person may exhibit extremely agitated and noncoherent 
behavior, elevated temperature and excessive endurance 
without fatigue. People in this mental state do not per-
ceive or respond to the brain’s signals to calm down before 
the body collapses. Th ey continue to push past the point of 
exhaustion, by running, ﬁ ghting with oﬃ  cers or resisting 
against restraints, until their body reaches a potentially 
fatal medical condition called metabolic acidosis. Only a

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 553
The actual transfer of drugs from the seller to the buyer is 
the major legal evidence in prosecuting drug-sale cases.
 
A patrol oﬃ  cer may see a drug transfer by chance or 
observe it after long surveillance or when an undercover 
oﬃ  cer makes a planned buy. Some transfers are quite intri-
cate. In one case, a drug seller put drugs on a dog’s back, 
and the dog brought them to the buyer and then returned 
to the seller with the payment. Even though the seller did 
not personally hand the drugs to the seller, there was a 
sale. In other cases, the seller leaves drugs at a predeter-
mined location and picks up payment at another location. 
Such subterfuge is countered by personal testimony.
 
If either the buyer or seller throws the drugs away to 
avoid being caught with them in possession, the drugs can 
be recovered as abandoned property and taken into cus-
tody. If the suspect was seen discarding the drugs, they 
can be used as evidence.
 
Narcotics cases begin with a report of suspicious 
drug activity, a search warrant obtained on information 
from a reliable informant or an on-sight observation 
of a drug buy. Undercover oﬃ  cers and informants then 
become central ﬁ gures in obtaining evidence: “Conﬁ -
dential informants are crucial to many law enforcement 
investigations and are especially essential in the ﬁ eld of 
narcotics investigations. Informants can provide spe-
ciﬁ c information that is simply not available from other 
sources. However, the informants are often criminals 
themselves; if not properly managed, they can render a 
law enforcement investigation useless, destroy an agen-
cy’s credibility and even endanger oﬃ  cers’ lives” (Lieber-
man, 2007, p.62). Informants are often vital to making 
on-sight arrests. 
ON-SIGHT ARRESTS
Patrol oﬃ  cers witnessing a suspected drug buy should 
obtain as complete a description as possible of the persons 
and vehicles involved. Th ere is usually no urgency in mak-
ing a drug arrest because the seller and buyer continue to 
meet over time.
If you observe what appears to be a drug buy, you can 
make a warrantless arrest if you have probable cause. 
Often, however, it is better to simply observe and gather 
information.
 
Probable cause is established through knowledge of 
the suspect’s criminal record, by observing other people 
making contact with the suspect and ﬁ nding drugs on 
operations locally. Outsiders are frequently brought in by 
the police to make buys and arrests. However, local patrol 
oﬃ  cers are still responsible for investigating drug oﬀ enses 
because they see the users and sometimes observe drug 
sales. Actions these oﬃ  cers take against users can put 
pressure on sellers because their market is hurt when users 
are arrested and jailed.
 
Drug users often become sellers to support their hab-
its. Many such individuals, called mules, sell or transport 
drugs for a regular dealer in return for being assured of 
a personal drug supply. Whereas some remain in small 
operations suﬃ  cient to support their needs, others see 
the proﬁ t they can make in large operations and go into 
business on a larger scale. Further, many drug pushers 
become users—an occupational hazard. Th is sometimes 
occurs accidentally as the result of testing the quality of 
the merchandise over an extended period.
 
Investigating the illegal sale and distribution of 
drugs requires all the basic techniques used for other 
crimes, plus special investigative skills related to the 
behavior of drug users and sellers, both of whom can be 
dangerous and unpredictable. An increasing challenge 
to narcotics investigators is the evolving use of technol-
ogy by drug traﬃ  ckers and street dealers. Law enforce-
ment agencies have encountered all types of devices 
used by drug sellers, ranging from two-way radios and 
cellular phones to robot planes. One seller of two-way 
radios stated that drug dealers were his biggest cus-
tomers. If a radio was conﬁ scated in an arrest, another 
was immediately purchased. Drug dealers use personal 
computers, sophisticated encryption systems that even 
federal agencies have diﬃ  culty deciphering, night-vision 
equipment, police frequency jamming equipment, scan-
ners and networking systems. Th e main advantages drug 
dealers have over government in using technology are 
the availability of almost unlimited funds and a lack of 
bureaucratic approval systems.
 
Other challenges concern the wide variety of drugs, 
the difficulty faced when trying to identify them under 
street conditions and the special types of searches 
often required to locate minute amounts of drugs that 
may be hidden ingeniously. Investigators also encoun-
ter special problems in finding drugs smuggled across 
national borders in a variety of ways and in identifying 
those who transport and distribute them. It takes much 
time and expense to develop informants and to make 
a purchase or otherwise discover and confiscate drugs 
while ensuring that the evidence will stand up in court. 
In the past few years, international drug lords have 
benefited from lowered political and economic barriers 
as well as easy access to sophisticated communications 
technology that can be frequently changed to evade law 
enforcement.

554 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
the location of the buy can then be put under surveillance, 
an especially important technique in narcotics investiga-
tions. Surveillance can provide protection for planned 
buys, protect the buy money, provide credibility for the 
buyer, provide information regarding the seller’s contacts 
and provide information to establish probable cause for 
an arrest or search warrant. It is not necessary to make 
an arrest on the ﬁ rst surveillance. Actually, it is gener-
ally advisable to make several surveillances to gather 
evidence.
 
Surveillance oﬃ  cers must have patience because 
many planned drug buys necessitate a long period of 
surveillance before the actual sale, or bust, is made. Th e 
drug dealer is concentrating on making the sale. No sale, 
no proﬁ t. At the same time, the dealer is trying to avoid 
being “busted.” It is essentially a cat-and-mouse game. 
Drug dealers often feel they are being observed when 
they are not, and surveillance oﬃ  cers often feel they have 
been “burned” when they have not. Prearranged signals 
and communications between surveillance oﬃ  cers and 
undercover oﬃ  cers are essential to prevent untimely drug 
busts. A detailed plan of action is mandatory. Th e surveil-
lance team must be prepared with adequate equipment, 
food and drink for the estimated surveillance period. 
Surveillance oﬃ  cers should have specialized training and 
detailed brieﬁ ng before actual assignment.
UNDERCOVER ASSIGNMENTS
According to Logue (2008, pp.94–95), “U/C [undercover 
work] has changed dramatically over the past 10 to 20 
years. Th e days of the Lone Ranger going out with a pock-
etful of money and being a bad guy are over for the most 
part. Advances in technology, increased liability and bud-
get constraints have caused many smaller agencies to steer 
them, by knowing of the suspect’s past relationships with 
other drug users or sellers and through observing actions 
of the suspect that indicate a drug buy. Th e courts usu-
ally give weight to oﬃ  cers’ experience and to their infor-
mation about the suspect and the circumstances of the 
arrest, including actions by the suspect before the arrest 
commonly associated with drug selling.
 
If probable cause is based on information supplied by 
an informant, check the information for accuracy against 
intelligence ﬁ les. If no prior intelligence information exists, 
add the facts provided to the ﬁ le. Check the informant’s 
reliability by asking about other suspects in drug cases. 
Are these suspects already in the ﬁ les? Has the informant 
helped before? How many arrests or convictions were 
based on the information? You might ask the informant 
to obtain a small amount of the drug if possible.
SURVEILLANCE
Neighborhood residents often know where the drug deal-
ers live or which houses are the crack houses. Th ey are, 
however, usually reluctant to provide such information 
to police for fear of retributive consequences. Th erefore, 
it may be necessary to surveil a property to develop evi-
dence of drug dealing activity. Some common indicators 
of residential drug traﬃ  cking are
• • A high volume of foot or vehicle traﬃ  c to and from a 
residence at late or unusual hours.
• • Periodic visitors who stay at the residence for very 
brief periods.
• • Altered property to maximize privacy.
 
It is frequently best simply to watch and obtain infor-
mation if you witness a drug buy. Th e suspected seller or 
Drugs are commonly bought and sold at raves 
and other events where young people congregate.

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 555
 
If working undercover, be thoroughly conversant with 
the language of the user and the seller, know the street 
prices of drugs and have a tight cover. Talk little and lis-
ten much. Observe without being noticed. Also devise an 
excuse to avoid using the drugs. Work within the seller’s 
system. Drug pushers, like other criminals, tend to develop 
certain methods for making their sales.
 
Asking them to change their method can cause sus-
picion, whereas going along with the system establishes 
your credibility for subsequent buys. Avoid dangerous 
situations by insisting you do not want to get into a situa-
tion where you could be ripped oﬀ , injured or killed.
Undercover drug buys are carefully planned, witnessed 
and conducted so that no charge of entrapment can be 
made.
 
Make careful plans before a drug buy. Select a surveil-
lance group and fully brief group members on the signals 
to use and their speciﬁ c assignments. Small transmitters 
are important communications devices for surveillance 
team members. Have alternative plans in case the original 
plan fails.
 
Careful preparation includes searching the buyer 
immediately before the transaction to avoid the defense 
that drugs were planted on the suspect. Any items on the 
buyer other than the money are retained at the police sta-
tion or with other police oﬃ  cers until after the buy.
 
Prepare the buy money in advance. It must be marked, 
identiﬁ ed, counted and recorded by serial number, date, 
time, and denomination. Have this procedure witnessed 
by one or more people. Th e money is not given to the 
buyer until immediately before the buy. Fluorescent pow-
ders can be used, but some drug sellers check money 
for these powders before making a transaction. All buys 
should be observed from a location where the movements 
of both the seller and buyer can be seen by the surveil-
lance team.
 
At the meeting, record the seller’s description, the 
vehicles used, telephone numbers called to set up the buy 
and observations about the seller’s personal statements 
and habits. If the informant and the undercover oﬃ  cer 
are both present, the oﬃ  cer makes the buy to protect the 
informant’s identity if an arrest is planned. If no arrest is 
planned, both the undercover oﬃ  cer and the informant 
make buys, providing additional evidence.
 
If several buys are made from the same seller over a 
period of time, the seller may relax security and include 
others higher in the organization. Even if this is not the 
case, the seller usually visits his or her drug source fre-
quently. Th e route to or the actual location of the supplier 
can then be put under surveillance. Such an opportunity 
away from U/C operations and, in turn, these causes have 
put a once common practice on the endangered species 
list. . . . Th e old Playstation II slogan “Live in your world, 
play in ours” adequately sums up the life of the U/C opera-
tive. It is American policing at its best but no one ever said 
being the best would be easy.”
 
Undercover investigations are used more routinely 
in drug cases than perhaps any other type of criminal 
investigation. Th e downside to this common tactic is that 
drug dealers also know it is routinely used, and they have 
become fairly adept at sniﬃ  ng out a “narc.” Street dealers 
are also aware of the restrictions imposed on undercover 
agents, such as the fact that law enforcement cannot 
smoke marijuana legally. As a result, undercover narcotics 
oﬃ  cers have had to develop more convincing ways to ﬁ t 
into the drug culture.
 
An undercover agent might dress a certain way, use 
certain slang and talk with an accent or even gargle with 
beer or hard liquor just before meeting with a dealer. But 
several new products by Narc-Scent Incorporated are help-
ing undercover oﬃ  cers gain street credibility by giving 
them the right smell. For example, an incense stick that 
produces a similar odor to that of smoked marijuana can 
be burned inside an oﬃ  cer’s vehicle. Th e scent can also 
permeate the undercover operative’s clothing, leading the 
dealer to believe the buyer is a doper. A loose weed version 
of the stick can be rolled into an imitation marijuana ciga-
rette and used as if it were real marijuana (Haﬀ ner, 2005, 
pp.325–326).
Planned Buys Planned buys usually involve working an 
undercover agent into a group selling or buying drugs or 
having an informant make the buy. Before using an infor-
mant to buy drugs, determine why the person is involved 
and keep a strict log of his or her activities. Use care in 
working with drug users as buyers because they are known 
by the courts to be chronic liars.
 
Th e enormous number of drug buys by undercover 
agents and informants have made drug sellers wary of 
new customers. Informants typically introduce the under-
cover oﬃ  cer. Informants are often involved in criminal 
narcotics as users or sellers and are “turned” by the police 
for providing information in exchange for lesser charges. 
Th e prosecutor’s oﬃ  ce usually makes the decision to use 
an informant in this way. Most people arrested for dealing 
drugs who are given the option of either going to jail or 
becoming an informant choose the latter. Police depart-
ments should have written policies on using informants.
 
Undercover agents are usually police oﬃ  cers of the 
investigating agency (in large cities) or of cooperative 
agencies on the same level of government in an exchange 
operation or a mutual-aid agreement that provides an 
exchange of narcotics oﬃ  cers.

556 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
 
In a sting called Operation Impunity, federal and local 
drug enforcement oﬃ  cers arrested 93 suspects in an eﬀ ort 
to dismantle the operations of drug traﬃ  cker Amado Car-
illo Fuentes. Fuentes was considered Mexico’s number-
one drug lord until he died in July 1997 while recovering 
from plastic surgery meant to help him evade law enforce-
ment. Th e two-year investigation, which ended in the fall 
of 1999, had the cooperation of the Mexican government 
and targeted alleged “cell heads” running the drug opera-
tions after Fuentes’ death.
NARCOTICS RAIDS
Raids are another method used to apprehend narcotics deal-
ers. Surveillance frequently provides enough information 
for obtaining a no-knock search or arrest warrant. Success-
ful narcotics raids are rarely spontaneous; they are planned 
on the basis of information obtained during an extended 
period. Th ey can be designed to occur in two, three or more 
places simultaneously, not only in the same community 
but also in other communities and even in other states. Th e 
raid itself must be carried out forcefully and swiftly because 
drugs can easily be destroyed in seconds.
 
Narcotics raids are often dangerous; therefore, before 
the raid, gather information about the people involved and 
the premises where the drugs are located. Also determine 
how many oﬃ  cers are needed, the types of weapons needed 
and the location of evidence, as discussed in Chapter 7. 
DRUG PARAPHERNALIA STORES
Another avenue available to investigators concerns para-
phernalia shops and their clientele. Such stores fall into 
two broad categories. “Head shops” sell products that help 
the end user ingest drugs, such as pipes, syringes, and 
so on. “Cut or vial stores,” in contrast, sell adulterants, 
diluents and other “oﬃ  ce supplies” used by drug organi-
zations in measuring, separating, chemically altering and 
packaging mass quantities of drugs. Th e trail of drug para-
phernalia may help investigators track down drug gangs 
and other major drug distributors.
ONLINE DRUG DEALERS
One challenge for 21st-century narcotics investigators 
involves a move from the street corner into cyberspace. 
Club drugs, prescription narcotics and ultra-pure forms of 
DXM, an ingredient found in OTC cough medication, can 
all be purchased online and shipped directly to the user’s 
home—transactions that are extremely diﬃ  cult for law 
enforcement to detect. Online drug dealers commonly try 
to disguise their activities by posting their available prod-
ucts as some type of legitimate substance.
seldom arises on the ﬁ rst contact because sellers usually 
devise very clever ruses to cover their tracks.
 
Th e three things valued by dealers are the drugs, the 
money the drugs can bring and their freedom to do busi-
ness. In the middle of the triangle is the oﬃ  cer. When 
both the money—that is, the ﬂ ashroll—and the drugs 
are present at the same time, the undercover oﬃ  cer faces 
the greatest danger.
 
Th e ability to negotiate is essential for an undercover 
oﬃ  cer. Almost everything is negotiable in a drug deal. 
Remaining cool and collected during the actual buy is 
absolutely necessary. If the situation does not look right 
or appears to be too dangerous, walk away from the deal; 
there is always another time and place. Because of the 
prevalence of weapons in drug traﬃ  cking, undercover 
oﬃ  cers can be in extreme danger, usually alone.
 
If the buy is successful, an arrest can be made imme-
diately, or a search warrant can be obtained on the basis 
of the buyer’s observation of other drugs on the premises. 
After the buy, the buyer is searched again and the exact 
amount of money and drugs on the buyer recorded.
Make two or more buys to avoid the charge of 
entrapment.
 
Although police are responsible for investigating nar-
cotics oﬀ enses and arresting violators, they are equally 
responsible for making every reasonable eﬀ ort to avoid 
arresting an innocent person. Th e illegal act involved in 
the sale should be voluntary, without special urging or 
persuasion. An agent who knows that a seller is in busi-
ness and merely asks for, pays for and receives drugs 
is not using entrapment. But continued requests for 
drugs from a person who does not ordinarily sell them is 
entrapment. If there has been more than one voluntary 
drug transaction, no basis for a defense of entrapment 
exists.
Stings A sting, or reverse buy, is a complex opera-
tion organized and implemented by undercover agents 
to apprehend drug dealers and buyers and to deter other 
users from making drug purchases at a certain location. 
As with other planned buys, reverse buys are labor inten-
sive, complex and require oﬃ  cers to be well trained. In a 
typical reverse buy, a team of oﬃ  cers conducts a street 
sweep to clear an area of drug dealers, and a second under-
cover team moves in posing as dealers. A third group of 
oﬃ  cers is stationed nearby conducting surveillance on the 
operation, videotaping transactions and providing backup 
should a deal go awry. A fourth group of uniformed oﬃ  -
cers waits just outside the perimeter of the reverse buy, to 
arrest those who have just purchased drugs.

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 557
and the ﬁ gures continued to rise in 2005, the peak of the 
meth problem. Th ese laboratories pose serious hazards 
to law enforcement agencies conducting raids on the 
premises, including booby traps and assaults from attack 
dogs or violent drug “cooks” under the inﬂ uence of their 
products. In addition, many of the substances, often 
unidentiﬁ ed or misidentiﬁ ed, are explosive and extremely 
ﬂ ammable. Irritants and corrosives, asphyxiants and 
nerve toxins also may be encountered. Figure 18.2 lists 
the toxic, explosive and hazardous chemicals commonly 
found in clandestine drug labs.
CLANDESTINE DRUG 
LABORATORIES
An increase in clandestine drug laboratories 
has occurred as more emphasis has been 
placed on reducing illegal foreign drug imports into the 
United States. For example, the number of clandestine 
methamphetamine labs seized nationwide by the DEA 
increased by more than 500 percent from 1994 to 2000,

public safety. An estimated 20 percent of meth labs come to 
the attention of law enforcement because of ﬁ re or explo-
sion. Meth labs run out of homes can have a particularly 
devastating impact on the health of children living there.
 
Table 18.4 outlines the methamphetamine produc-
tion process and identiﬁ es the various hazards generated 
at each stage. 
IDENTIFYING A CLANDESTINE LAB
Drug labs can be set up almost anywhere. Smaller opera-
tions are more portable and easily moved, making detec-
tion more diﬃ  cult. Clandestine or “clan” labs tend to 
share some common characteristics, however, and know-
ing what to watch for can help investigators uncover 
these dangerous, unlawful operations. From the outside 
of a structure, investigators may observe blacked out or 
boarded up windows, hoses sticking out through windows 
and doors, dead vegetation from dumped chemical wastes 
Clandestine drug laboratories present physical, chemical 
and toxic hazards to law enforcement ofﬁ cers engaged 
in raids on the premises.
 
Most clandestine labs produce one or more types 
of amphetamine, but a few produce club drugs such as 
Ecstasy and LSD. Th e most serious challenge is posed by 
covert drug labs involved in the manufacture of meth-
amphetamine, the most widely used and clandestinely 
produced synthetic drug in the United States. Meth labs 
are found across the country, in cities and rural areas and 
have been found in private residences, motel rooms, stor-
age units, garages, barns and vehicles.
 
Th e production of meth involves ingredients such as 
strong acids and bases, ﬂ ammable solvents and very explo-
sive and poisonous chemicals (Street, 2006, p.44). Because 
of their volatility, these labs present a signiﬁ cant threat to

transferred to a separatory vessel, most often 
a 55-gallon drum with a spigot at its base.

The Freon will drag the D-meth to the bottom 
of the vessel, and the clandestine lab cook 
will drain it off. If another solvent is used, the 
D-meth base ﬂ oats to the top because this 
solvent is lighter than water.

chemicals. Still, the entry team wears the least protec-
tion because the gear limits mobility, dexterity, vision and 
voice communications. 
 
Once entry has been successful, the assessment 
team—an agent and a chemist—enter the site to deal 
with immediate hazards, to ventilate the site and to 
segregate incompatible chemicals to halt reactions. 
Assessment team members wear ﬁ re-protective, chem-
ical-resistant suits, gloves and boots. Th ey also use self-
contained breathing devices for respiratory protection. 
Th is team determines what safety equipment and cloth-
ing the processing team will need. Th e processing team 
then enters and identiﬁ es and collects evidence. Th ey 
photograph and videotape the site and collect samples 
of the various chemicals. Th e ﬁ nal step involves remov-
ing and disposing of hazardous materials and decon-
taminating and posting the site.
 
Training involves 40 hours of classroom instruction 
followed by a 24-hour in-service training course at the 
and strong chemical odors, all of which may indicate a 
clan lab is operating inside. Inside a structure, indicators 
of a clan lab include coﬀ ee grinders with white residue; 
coﬀ ee ﬁ lters with red stains; large quantities of acetone, 
antifreeze, camping fuel, drain cleaner, lithium batteries, 
matches, plastic baggies, cold tablets or cough syrup con-
taining the ingredient pseudoephedrine; an abundance 
of mixing containers such as Pyrex glassware, crock pots 
and other large pots; strips of bed linen or cloth for ﬁ lter-
ing liquid drug mixtures; and general clutter, disarray and 
ﬁ lthy living conditions (Hanson, 2005, pp.10–14).
 
Because hotel rooms are commonly used for those 
setting up “clan” labs, some law enforcement agencies 
are training hotel managers and employees on the dan-
gers such labs pose and ways to identify suspected “meth 
cooks.” DEA agents proﬁ le a typical meth cook as white, 
trashy looking, with rotting teeth (the meth cook look) 
and poor-quality tattoos and with a local address on his 
identiﬁ cation. Because the chemicals, such as Drano, used 
in the production are corrosive and the cooks usually do 
not get all of them out before using the drug, they suﬀ er 
corrosion on their teeth and skin.
ENTERING A CLANDESTINE DRUG LAB
When encountering a drug lab or its components, do not 
use matches, lighters or items that could ignite fumes. 
Do not turn switches on or oﬀ , because the electric con-
nection could produce sparks and cause an explosion. Do 
not taste, smell or touch any substance, and do check for 
booby traps before moving or touching containers.
 
Th e various health and safety hazards encountered 
at a clandestine drug lab necessitate that only properly 
trained and equipped personnel proceed onto the site. A 
safety program developed by the DEA and the California 
Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement following recommenda-
tions by the Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health has four basic elements: policies and procedures, 
equipment and protective clothing, training, and medical 
monitoring. 
 
Policies and procedures are aimed at ensuring oﬃ  cer 
safety through a certiﬁ cation process. Only certiﬁ ed indi-
viduals are allowed to seize, process and dispose of clan-
destine laboratories. Th eir procedure for conducting a raid 
has ﬁ ve stages: planning, entry, assessment, processing and 
exit. 
 
During the planning stage, certiﬁ ed agents and chem-
ists identify the chemicals that may be present and arrange 
for the proper safety equipment and protective cloth-
ing. Entry has the most potential for danger. Th e entry 
team faces the possibility of armed resistance by owners 
and operators, booby traps and exposure to hazardous 
Technology Innovations
Weiss (2007, pp.66–73) describes how autono-
mous robotics can enhance ofﬁ cers’ safety in inves-
tigating a suspected meth lab and be an important 
force multiplier.
Imagine if “thinking” robots made the ﬁ rst entry 
into these hazardous surroundings [meth labs], 
while responding ofﬁ cers watched their activities 
from a safe distance away.
By using autonomous robots, law enforcement 
could gather intelligence in a stakeout and have 
the robots enter the area before sending in a SWAT 
team . . . .
As robots enter a lab’s vicinity, they use sensor 
arrays to determine if any humans are present, and 
whether the individuals are armed or extremely 
agitated, and potentially dangerous. The robots 
also can determine whether chemical or dry 
cooking is taking place, and if poisonous gases 
are present in the air. The robots use efﬁ cient 
algorithms to search each room—having a plan 
for every type of contingency. In some situations 
they would be programmed to alert and acquire the 
assistance of ofﬁ cers. . . .
Arming autonomous robots with lethal or 
less-lethal weapons, allowing them to use force or 
be allowed to move at-will could help protect the 
ofﬁ cer.

560 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
through exposure to the vapors produced during the drug 
manufacturing process. Such trash requires special han-
dling and disposal, often at great expense. Th e Compre-
hensive Methamphetamine Control Act (MCA) of 1996 
allows the courts to order a defendant convicted of manu-
facturing methamphetamine to pay the cost of cleanup of 
the lab site. Despite eﬀ orts to detect and shut them down, 
clan labs continue to proliferate. 
INDOOR MARIJUANA GROWING 
OPERATIONS
Another type of clandestinely produced drug is 
sinsemilla, a potent form of marijuana culti-
vated indoors. One good indication of indoor marijuana 
growing operations is excessive use of electricity needed to 
run the lighting system, and a residence that pulls a great 
deal more electricity than the average home in a particular 
location may warrant a closer look. If such a residence is 
identiﬁ ed, police may observe the type and amount of traf-
ﬁ c to and from the house and, based on the combination of 
information involving electricity use and traﬃ  c, obtain a 
search warrant. Th is approach has been used many times to 
break up large marijuana-growing operations.
 
Many grow operations steal electricity by diverting 
power from a main supply line. In addition to tampered-with 
electric meters and supply lines, other signs of an indoor grow 
operation include water lines or electrical cords running to a 
basement or outbuilding, an outbuilding with air condition-
ers, an unusual number of roof vents, excessive condensa-
tion around windows and unusual security measures.
 
Inherent dangers associated with the high-energy 
needs of these indoor grow operations include the risk 
of electrocution from exposing and tampering with high-
wattage wires, explosion and ﬁ re risks because of the 
presence and prevalence of chemicals stored inside and 
upper respiratory infections caused by mold that thrives 
in these high-humidity environments.
INVESTIGATIVE AIDS
One tool to help federal, state and local law 
enforcement agencies investigate drug traf-
ﬁ cking is the DEA’s National Drug Pointer Index (NDPIX), 
a nationwide database that became operational across the 
United States in 1997. Th e NDPIX is intended to enhance 
agent and oﬃ  cer safety, eliminate duplication, increase 
information sharing and coordination and minimize costs 
ﬁ eld level. Medical monitoring has two stages: medical 
screening of potential team members and annual moni-
toring to learn whether any team members have devel-
oped adverse health eﬀ ects as a result of working with 
hazardous chemicals. Guidelines and training for clandes-
tine drug laboratory investigations are available through 
the National Sheriﬀ s Association.
 
Clan labs pose a danger to oﬃ  cers and the public, as 
well as generating an enormous amount of waste and can 
be very expensive to clean up.
CLEANUP OF CLANDESTINE DRUG LABS
Estimates suggest that for every pound of meth produced, 
as much as ﬁ ve pounds of waste are created, includ-
ing empty chemical containers, contaminated cooking 
equipment and other items that have become hazardous 
Assessment team members investigating clandestine drug 
laboratories wear ﬁ re- and chemical-resistant suits, gloves, and 
boots and use self-contained breathing devices for protection. 
The team determines what safety equipment and clothing the 
processing team (who will identify and collect evidence) will 
need. Here, a member of the Southwest Virginia Clandestine Lab 
Team piles up methamphetamine-making ingredients and cooking 
devices on the lawn of a Damascus, Virginia, home. Seizures 
of methamphetamine labs such as this have been on the rise 
throughout the country, reﬂ ecting a growing drug problem and an 
increased effort to combat it. (© AP/Wide World Photos)

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 561
AGENCY COOPERATION
Investigating illegal drug activities requires the 
cooperation of all law enforcement agencies, 
including the exchange of suspect car lists and descriptions 
of sellers and buyers. Local police assist state and federal 
narcotics investigators by sharing their knowledge of drug 
users and sellers in their community. In addition, many nar-
cotics oﬃ  cers exchange vehicles and personnel with other 
agencies to have less identiﬁ able operators and equipment.
 
Th e federal government has mobilized an all-out attack 
on illegal drug activities. Before 1973, several federal agen-
cies separately investigated illegal drug activities. In 1973, 
these agencies were merged into the Federal Drug Enforce-
ment Administration (FDEA), often called simply the DEA.
The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration (FDEA) pro-
vides uniﬁ ed leadership in attacking narcotics trafﬁ cking 
and drug abuse. Its emphasis is on the source and distri-
bution of illicit drugs rather than on arresting abusers.
 
Th e DEA emphasis is on stopping the ﬂ ow of drugs at 
their foreign sources, disrupting illicit domestic commerce 
at the highest levels of distribution and helping state and 
local police prevent the entry of illegal drugs into their 
communities. Th e DEA’s Mobile Enforcement Team (MET), 
established in 1995, consists of more than 200 agents 
deployed across the nation to help ﬁ ght the drug war. Th e 
National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) also plays a vital 
role in providing police administrators and oﬃ  cers with the 
latest information on drug distribution patterns.
 
U.S. agencies must cooperate with law enforcement in 
other countries because much of the U.S. domestic drug 
problem originates across national borders. To overcome 
interjurisdictional competition and minimize duplication 
of eﬀ ort, multijurisdictional drug task forces have been 
implemented across the country. Sometimes task forces and 
programs are created because of a need to eliminate dissen-
tion, rather than from a desire to cooperate. One beneﬁ t of 
working with a task force is shared forfeiture revenues.
DRUG ASSET FORFEITURES
Asset forfeiture is a tool that allows agencies 
investigating various types of crimes, including 
drug traﬃ  cking, to seize items used in or acquired through 
committing that crime. Th e Federal Comprehensive Crime 
Control Act of 1984 initiated procedures for asset 
by using existing technology and 24-hour access to infor-
mation through an eﬀ ective, secure law enforcement tele-
communications system.
 
Some investigative aids are not so high-tech. For exam-
ple, using dogs to detect drugs has been common for decades 
because their keen sense of smell enables them to detect 
minute traces of illicit drugs. Canines are eﬀ ective force 
multipliers (Smith, 2006, p.53). Law enforcement agencies 
depend on their K-9s and handlers for many tasks essen-
tial to police work, with drug detection topping the list—90 
percent of surveyed agencies reporting they use dogs for 
this purpose (“Almost 50% of Agencies,” 2008, p.14). For 
example, in one investigation, the Middlesex (Massachu-
setts) Sheriﬀ ’s Department’s K-9 unit seized 8,000 grams 
of cocaine, 2,000 grams of heroin, 80 pounds of marijuana 
and $2.5 million in drug-smeared cash (Redmond, 2008).
 
Th e Supreme Court has ruled that a canine sniﬀ  in a 
public area or during a lawful traﬃ  c stop is not a Fourth 
Amendment “search.” However, use of a narcotics-detec-
tion dog to sniﬀ  at the door of an apartment or a home 
has been ruled a search within the meaning of the Fourth 
Amendment and therefore requires a warrant.
 
Another assist for investigators is a special high-ac-
curacy laser rangeﬁ nder developed for the U.S. Customs 
Service that can ﬁ nd secret compartments that might 
contain drugs. Investigators use the unit to measure the 
interior dimensions of cargo containers in their search for 
hidden compartments in which drugs may be smuggled. 
Th e small laser beam allows measurements of loaded con-
tainers in which physical access to the rear wall is limited. 
Th e handheld, battery-operated laser rangeﬁ nder mea-
sures distances from 6 to 85 feet to an accuracy of 1 inch.
Technology Innovations
Flying drones are being used by the U.S. 
Forest Service to battle pot growers operating 
in remote California woodlands. The pilotless, 
camera-equipped aircraft allows law enforcement 
to pinpoint marijuana ﬁ elds and size up potential 
dangers before agents attempt arrests. The SkySeer 
drones are lighter than most other drones, less than 
ﬁ ve pounds and can ﬂ y for only about an hour. The 
battery-powered SkySeer can ﬂ y at under 30 miles 
per hour, has a 2-mile range and is operated by a 
two-person crew on the ground. More than 2.3 mil-
lion marijuana plants were eradicated from Forest 
Service lands nationwide in 2007. In California’s 18 
national forests, an estimated 6 million plants have 
been removed since 2000 (Brown, 2008).

562 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
drug czar serves at the direction of the president, and 
many states appoint people to similar positions to direct 
state and local eﬀ orts. Federal funding is available through 
state agencies. Federal, state and local agencies with roles 
in the drug war coordinate their eﬀ orts. Any successful 
eﬀ ort to address drug-related crime and drug addiction 
must also necessarily involve partnerships with the com-
munity. Businesses, schools, public health departments 
and individual citizens are invaluable components of an 
eﬀ ective response.
 
Th ousands of volunteers, groups and agencies have 
joined the ﬁ ght against illegal drugs. For example, Opera-
tion Weed and Seed is a national initiative for marshaling 
the resources of a number of federal agencies to strengthen 
law enforcement and revitalize communities. It is a com-
prehensive, coordinated approach to controlling drugs and 
crime in targeted high-crime neighborhoods. Th e Weed and 
Seed program links community policing and concentrated 
law enforcement eﬀ orts to identify, arrest and prosecute 
violent oﬀ enders, drug traﬃ  ckers, and other criminals 
(weeding) with human services such as after-school, week-
end and summer youth activities; adult literacy classes; 
parental counseling; and neighborhood revitalization 
eﬀ orts to prevent and deter further crime (seeding).
 
But crime control is only one of several drug-control 
strategies that individual communities and the nation 
as a whole have available. Figure 18.3 depicts the multi-
faceted drug-control strategies competing for funds and 
support.
 
Some communities are developing speciﬁ c programs 
to address the drug problem and are recognizing the need 
for innovative approaches. For example, in jurisdictions 
facing high incidence of youths abusing OTC drugs, law 
enforcement can take steps to educate business owners 
and operators who sell these products about the risks 
involved. Clerks can be trained to recognize common 
signs of drug abuse and to understand why they should 
not sell a dozen packages of Coricidin Cough and Cold 
medicine to a group of teenagers. Some businesses may 
voluntarily move the drugs behind the counter, limit the 
number of packages a customer may purchase at one time 
or require customers to be over age 18. Law enforcement 
cannot force retailers to restrict OTC drugs. States have 
passed legislation banning OTC sales of certain products 
deemed threats to public safety. 
 
A summary of the ﬁ ndings from all rigorous aca-
demic studies evaluating a range of street-level drug law 
enforcement interventions found that strategic crime-
control partnerships with a range of third parties are 
more eﬀ ective at disrupting drug problems than are 
law-enforcement-only approaches (Mazerolle, Soole and 
Rombouts, 2007). Addressing the drug problem has been 
a priority for the past quarter century.
forfeitures as a result of drug arrests. Th e U.S. Congress gave 
ﬁ nal approval to the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 
2000, which lowered the burden of proof from “clear and 
convincing” to “a preponderance of the evidence.” Th e act 
also reduced the statute of limitations from 11 years to 5 
years for a property owner to make a claim on the property.
 
Conﬁ scating drug dealers’ cash and property has 
been eﬀ ective in reducing drug traﬃ  cking and is pro-
viding local, state and federal law enforcement agencies 
with assets they need for their ﬁ ght against drugs. Asset 
forfeiture laws provide for the conﬁ scation of cash and 
other property in possession of a drug dealer at the time 
of the arrest. Seized vehicles, boats or airplanes may be 
used directly by the agency or sold at auction to generate 
funds. Monetary assets may be used to purchase police 
equipment, to hire additional law enforcement personnel 
or to provide training in drug investigation.
 
Currency seizures pose special challenges to law 
enforcement because there is no law against possessing a 
large quantity of cash, and many currency seizures occur 
in the absence of narcotics, making it diﬃ  cult to link the 
money to criminal activity. Th e investigator must establish 
the ownership of the currency (was it inherited? won at the 
track? what does the person do for a living?), the origin of 
the currency, and the packaging and transportation meth-
ods used with the currency. An attempt to disguise or oth-
erwise hide the currency suggests criminal involvement.
 
Precise recording of all proceedings is necessary to avoid 
allegations of abuse or misuse of these funds. Because of 
the required legal and judicial proceedings regarding these 
conﬁ scations, often 6 months or more often pass after an 
arrest before the assets are available for police agency use.
 
A common defense to asset seizure is the Innocent 
Owner Defense. If an owner can prove that he or she had 
no knowledge of the prohibited activity, the property is 
not subject to forfeiture.
 
Th e forfeiture program has not been without prob-
lems and misunderstandings. Th e conﬁ scated funds may 
be used only for police department eﬀ orts to increase 
their ﬁ ght against drugs. Police budgets cannot be reduced 
because of the availability of the asset-forfeiture funds.
PREVENTING PROBLEMS WITH 
ILLEGAL DRUGS: COMMUNITY 
PARTNERSHIPS
Tremendous national, state and local eﬀ orts 
are being directed to meeting the challenges 
of drug use and abuse in the United States. A national

 1. Stop drug use before it starts: education and community 
action. In homes, schools, places of worship, the work-
place, and civic and social organizations, Americans must 
set norms that reaﬃ  rm the values of responsibility and 
good citizenship while dismissing the notion that drug 
use is consistent with individual freedom. Th e National 
Drug Control Strategy ties national leadership with com-
munity-level action to help recreate the formula that 
helped America succeed against drugs in the past.
 2. Heal America’s drug users: getting treatment resources 
where they are needed. Getting people into treatment will 
require the creation of a new climate of “compassionate 
coercion,” which begins with family, friends, employers 
and the community. Compassionate coercion also uses 
the criminal justice system to get people into treatment.
 3. Disrupt the market: attacking the economic basis of the 
drug trade. Domestically, attacking the economic basis 
of the drug trade involves the cooperative, combined 
eﬀ orts of federal, state and local law enforcement.
 
Th e Bush administration’s Synthetic Drug Control 
Strategy is a companion to the national strategy focus-
ing on methamphetamine and prescription drug abuse. 
THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL 
STRATEGY
In 1973, President Richard M. Nixon declared 
“war” on drugs. Since then, federal spending 
on this war against drug smugglers, users and sellers has 
increased 30-fold—from $420 million in 1973 to $12.7 
billion (Katel, 2006). Drug arrests have nearly tripled 
since 1980, when the federal drug policy shifted to arrest-
ing and incarcerating users. Approximately 1.7 million 
people were arrested on drug charges in 2004, about 
700,000 of them for marijuana use (Katel).
The key to reducing drug abuse is prevention coupled 
with treatment.
 
When President George W. Bush took oﬃ  ce in 2001, 
he endorsed a three-pronged approach, repeated in the 
National Drug Control Strategy 2007:

564 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
 
Th e FBI deﬁ nes organized crime as any group hav-
ing some manner of a formalized structure and whose 
primary objective is to obtain money through illegal 
activities. Organized crime groups achieve and retain 
their status through the use of actual or threatened 
violence, corruption of public oﬃ  cials and other coer-
cive tactics. A criminal enterprise, by FBI deﬁ nition, 
is a group of individuals with an identiﬁ ed hierarchy, or 
comparable structure, engaged in signiﬁ cant criminal 
activity. Although organized crime and criminal enterprise 
are often equated and used interchangeably, several fed-
eral statutes speciﬁ cally delineate the elements of an 
enterprise that must be proven to convict individuals 
or groups under those statutes. For example, the Rack-
eteering Inﬂ uenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) 
Act, or Title 18 U.S.C. 1961(4), passed in 1970, deﬁ nes 
an enterprise as “any individual, partnership, corpora-
tion, association, or other legal entity, and any union or 
group of individuals associated in fact although not a 
legal entity.”
 
Albanese (2008, pp.263–264) provides a deﬁ ni-
tion based on the consensus of a review of deﬁ nitions of 
organized crime in the literature: “Organized crime is a 
continuing criminal enterprise that rationally works to 
proﬁ t from illegal activities that are often in great public 
demand. Its continuing existence is maintained through 
the use of force, threats, monopoly control, and/or the 
corruption of public oﬃ  cials.”
 
Several characteristics distinguish organized crime 
from crimes committed by individuals or unorganized 
groups.
CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIZED CRIME
Distinctive characteristics of organized crime include
• • Deﬁ nite organization and control.
• • High-proﬁ t and continued-proﬁ t crimes.
• • Singular control through force and threats.
• • Protection through corruption.
 
Other characteristics not as frequently mentioned in 
deﬁ nitions of organized crime include restricted member-
ship, being nonideological, specialization and a code of 
secrecy.
 
The organization provides direct control, leadership 
and discipline. The leaders are isolated from the gen-
eral operations through field or area leaders, who in 
turn control the everyday activities that bring in the 
profits. Organized crime deals primarily in high-profit 
crimes that are susceptible to organizational control 
It follows the main principles set out in the National 
Strategy: that supply and demand are the ultimate 
drivers in all illicit drug markets and that a balanced 
approach incorporating prevention, treatment and mar-
ket disruption initiatives is the best way to reduce the 
supply of, and demand for, illicit drugs (Synthetic Drug 
Control Strategy, 2006).
 
In addition to presenting a major challenge to law 
enforcement in itself, the illegal drug trade is an essential 
source of revenue for organized crime.
ORGANIZED CRIME: 
AN OVERVIEW
Organized crime is a global scourge, entangl-
ing communities around the world in its web 
of corruption and violence. Organized crime under-
mines legitimate commerce, manipulates stock markets, 
steals merchandise, distributes drugs, controls labor 
unions and enslaves innocent women and children. 
Th ese criminal enterprises have developed an online 
presence, with organized crime groups actively and 
increasingly engaged in Internet fraud and identity 
theft. Bratton (2007, p.22) describes the evolution of 
organized crime:
In the “old days,” organized crime was exclusively 
 synonymous with La Cosa Nostra, and organized-crime 
ﬁ gures focused their energies on prostitution and 
gambling. Back then, violence was present but predict-
able, and narcotics traﬃ  cking was frowned upon as 
“bad business” because of the great risks and potential 
penalties involved. At some point between the old 
days and today, organized criminal groups entered the 
illicit drug-traﬃ  cking trade. Today, however, through 
advances in technology the illicit trade market has 
grown exponentially—not only geographically due to 
decreasing transportation costs, but also in terms of 
diversiﬁ cation, by making illicit trade possible in a wide 
range of goods, beyond drugs, that ever existed before. 
With the dismantling of Communism and the globaliza-
tion of the world’s economies as a result of technology 
and trade agreements between nations, a new and chal-
lenging concern for the world’s law enforcement com-
munity has evolved. . . .
 
Today, organized-crime entities have morphed 
from the traditional ﬁ xed hierarchies with control-
ling leaders or families to more decentralized, loosely 
linked, multiple networks that come together and 
cooperate only on an opportunistic basis and then 
separate. . . .

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 565
APPLICABLE LAWS AGAINST 
ORGANIZED CRIME
In addition to various state laws, two other dis-
tinct groups of laws seek to control organized 
crime: criminal laws that attack the criminal act itself and 
laws that make violations a criminal conspiracy. Charges 
have also been brought against some types of organized 
crime through prosecution under the Internal Revenue 
laws and initiation of civil lawsuits.
 
Th e major federal acts speciﬁ cally directed against 
organized crime are the 1946 Hobbs Anti-Racketeering 
Act, the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act, the RICO Act of 1970 and the Organized Crime Con-
trol Act of 1970. Th ese acts make it permissible to use 
circumstantial rather than direct evidence to enforce 
conspiracy violations. Th ey also prohibit the use of funds 
derived from illegal sources to enter into legitimate enter-
prises (commonly known as laundering money). Title 18 
U.S. Code, Section 1962, deﬁ nes three areas that can be 
prosecuted.
It is a prosecutable conspiracy to
• • Acquire any enterprise with money obtained from 
illegal activity
• • Acquire, maintain or control any enterprise by 
illegal means
• • Use any enterprise to conduct illegal activity
MAJOR ACTIVITIES OF 
ORGANIZED CRIME
Organized crime is involved in almost every 
legal and illegal activity that makes large sums 
of money with little risk.
Organized crime is heavily involved in the so-called 
victimless crimes of gambling, drugs, pornography and 
prostitution, as well as fraud, loan-sharking, money laun-
dering and inﬁ ltration of legitimate businesses.
 
Federal crimes prosecutable under the RICO statute 
include bribery, sports bribery, counterfeiting, embez-
zlement of union funds, mail fraud, wire fraud, money 
laundering, obstruction of justice, murder for hire, drug 
and that can be developed into larger operations that 
provide the continued profit necessary for future 
existence.
 
Organized crime functions through many forms of 
corruption and intimidation to create a singular con-
trol over specific goods and services that ultimately 
results in a monopoly. Monopoly provides the oppor-
tunity to set higher prices and profits for that product 
or service.
 
Organized crime flourishes most where protection 
from interference and prosecution exist. The first line 
of immunity is the indifference of the general public 
and their knowing or unknowing use of the services 
or purchase of the goods offered by organized crime. 
Through such activities, citizens provide the financial 
power that gives organized crime immunity from legal 
authorities. Moreover, organized crime uses enforce-
ment tactics to ensure compliance with its decrees. 
Members or paid enforcers intimidate, brutalize and 
even murder those who fail to obey the dictates of orga-
nized crime bosses.
 
In the early 1960s, Joseph Valachi made public for 
the ﬁ rst time the awesome power of organized crime and 
dispelled many misconceptions about it. First, organized 
crime is not a single entity controlled by one superpower. 
Although a large share of organized crime is controlled 
by the Italian Maﬁ a, other organizations throughout the 
United States have sprung up. As America has become 
more diverse, so too have the organized crime groups 
operating within it. Asian and Russian/Eurasian criminal 
groups, for example, have been spreading across the coun-
try in recent years.
 
Second, organized crime does not exist only in metro-
politan areas. Although organized crime operates primarily 
in larger metropolitan areas, it has associate operations in 
many smaller cities, towns and rural areas.
 
Th ird, organized crime does not involve only activi-
ties such as narcotics, prostitution, racketeering and 
gambling. Rather, organized crime is involved in virtually 
every area where proﬁ ts are to be made, including legiti-
mate businesses.
 
Fourth, citizens are not isolated from orga-
nized crime. They are directly affected by it through 
increased prices of consumer goods controlled by 
behind-the-scenes activities of organized crime. In 
addition, citizens who buy items on the black market, 
solicit prostitutes, purchase pornography, bet through 
a bookie, take chances on punch boards or participate 
in other innocent betting operations directly contrib-
ute to the financial success of organized crime. Millions 
of citizens support organized crime by knowingly or 
unknowingly taking advantage of the goods and ser-
vices it provides.

566 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
gambling is the backbone of its activities and its largest 
source of income. Bookmaking—soliciting and accepting 
bets on any type of sporting event—is the most prevalent 
gambling operation. Furthermore, various forms of num-
bers/policy and other lottery games net substantial portions 
of the ﬁ nancial gain to organized crime from gambling.
LOAN-SHARKING
Loan-sharking—lending money at exorbitant interest 
rates—is supported initially by the proﬁ ts from gambling 
operations. Th e upper hierarchy lends money to lower-
echelon members of the organization, charging them 1 to 
2 percent interest on large sums. Th ese members in turn 
lend the money to customers at rates of 20 to 30 percent 
or more. Th e most likely customers are people who cannot 
obtain loans through legitimate sources, often to pay oﬀ  
illegal gambling debts.
MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE INFILTRATION 
OF LEGITIMATE BUSINESS
In recent years, organized crime has become increasingly 
involved in legitimate business. Th e vast proﬁ ts from 
illegal activities are given legitimacy by being invested in 
legal business. Th is is another way of turning dirty money 
into clean money, or “laundering” it. (Money launder-
ing was discussed in depth in Chapter 14.) For example, 
a medium-sized company experiences a lack of business 
and is unable to get credit. Convinced that an infusion of 
capital will turn the business around, the president turns 
to a loan shark and borrows at an interest rate of 50 per-
cent per week. Within months, organized crime has taken 
over the company. Th e crime boss keeps the president as 
a ﬁ gurehead and uses his reputation to order goods worth 
thousands of dollars, never intending to pay for them. 
After a few months, the company ﬁ les for bankruptcy.
 
Investigators must be aware that some criminal groups 
are more involved than others are in particular activities. 
Familiarity with a crime group’s “specialties” or crimes of 
preference will greatly assist in investigations and will help 
identify the presence of new organized crime factions.
THE THREAT OF SPECIFIC 
ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS
Whereas Italian crime syndicates such as La 
Cosa Nostra (LCN) may have predominated in 
the early days of organized crime in the United States, 
groups from other parts of the world are now cashing in 
traﬃ  cking, prostitution, sexual exploitation of children, 
alien smuggling, traﬃ  cking in counterfeit goods, theft from 
interstate shipment and interstate transportation of stolen 
property. State crimes chargeable under RICO include mur-
der, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extor-
tion and drug oﬀ enses. Th us, investigating organized crime 
eﬀ ectively means investigating any of these other types of 
criminal activity in which the organization is involved.
 
Although the history of organized crime is ﬁ lled with 
bloodshed, violence and corruption, organized crime bosses 
no longer wield power through a Th ompson submachine 
gun. Th ey manipulate the business economy to their beneﬁ t. 
Such crimes as labor racketeering, unwelcome inﬁ ltration of 
unions, fencing stolen property, gambling, loan-sharking, 
drug traﬃ  cking, employment of illegal aliens and white-
collar crimes of all types can signal syndicate involvement.
VICTIMLESS CRIMES
A victimless crime is an illegal activity in which all 
involved are willing participants. Among the crimes cat-
egorized as “victimless” are gambling, drug use, pornog-
raphy and prostitution. Because there is no complainant, 
these crimes are diﬃ  cult to investigate and to prosecute.
 
Arguments for legalizing so-called victimless crimes 
have been made periodically over the years but without suc-
cess. Proponents argue that it is not the government’s func-
tion to regulate morality, that the laws are ineﬀ ective as well 
as hypocritical and unenforceable. Further, the laws have 
created a whole class of “criminals” who would not otherwise 
be considered such. Perhaps most important, the laws create 
the conditions under which organized crime can thrive.
 
Opponents of legalizing these activities argue that it 
is the government’s proper function to regulate morality 
and to protect individuals from themselves. As long as 
the activities are illegal, law enforcement is obligated to 
enforce the laws. Among the most diﬃ  cult laws to enforce 
are those making gambling illegal in some instances.
 
Gambling is regarded by some as a vice, a sinful activ-
ity that corrupts society; others see gambling as simply 
a harmless form of entertainment. Within the gambling 
industry, the term gambling is being replaced with the 
term gaming, giving it the appearance of respectability. 
Legal “gaming” has greatly expanded throughout the 
country in the form of state lotteries, pari-mutuel betting 
on horses and greyhounds, bingo, slot machines and casi-
nos. Th e Internet has hundreds of gambling-related sites, 
many of which have set up operations oﬀ shore. Some con-
tend that when casino gambling comes to a city, robber-
ies, check and credit card fraud, property crimes, domestic 
abuse and alcohol-related violations increase.
 
In addition to the problems associated with legal gam-
bling, most reports on organized crime indicate that illegal 

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 567
family has roughly the same organizational structure. 
Th e boss controls the family and makes executive deci-
sions. Th e underboss is second in command, and the 
consigliere serves as a senior adviser or counselor. Sur-
rounding the boss are captains (“capos”) who supervise 
crews of “soldiers.” Th e soldiers and their associates 
carry out the actual crimes, the proceeds from which go 
to the capos and those of higher rank. LCN was origi-
nally grounded on standards of conduct borrowed from 
southern Italian tradition, particularly loyalty to the 
family. In the Maﬁ a, however, this meant that loyalty to 
the crime family took precedence over loyalty to one’s 
own blood family. Th is loyalty began to unravel with the 
1992 testimony of an underboss, Salvatore “Sammy the 
Bull” Gravano, of the Gambino family, against his boss, 
John Gotti, which sent Gotti to prison for life and set the 
precedent for other turncoat mobsters to rat out their 
crime bosses in exchange for reduced prison sentences. 
Th e federal racketeering and kidnapping trial of John 
A. Gotti, who took over as street boss for the Gambino 
family after his father went to prison, and who alleg-
edly continued ordering crimes after his own impris-
onment for a racketeering conviction in 1997, has thus 
far included testimony from ﬁ ve Gambino crime family 
defectors (Preston, 2005). In 2005, Joseph Massino, the 
once highly respected “last don” of the Bonanno family, 
became the ﬁ rst LCN boss to “ﬂ ip,” or turn states’ evi-
dence, testifying about other crime family members in 
exchange for leniency by the court. 
ASIAN ORGANIZED CRIME
Asian organized crime (AOC) groups, referred to as 
Asian Criminal Enterprises by the FBI, are involved in 
murder, kidnapping, extortion, prostitution, pornogra-
phy, loan-sharking, gambling, money laundering, alien 
smuggling, traﬃ  cking in heroin and methamphetamine, 
counterfeiting of computer and clothing products and 
various protection schemes. AOC is often well run and 
hard to crack, using very ﬂ uid, mobile global networks 
of criminal associates. Asian criminal enterprises are 
classiﬁ ed as either traditional, such as the Yakuza and 
Triads, or nontraditional, such as ethnic Asian street 
gangs. 
 
Japanese organized crime is sometimes known as 
Boryokudan but is more commonly known as the Yakuza. 
A gyangu (Japanese gangster) is a member of the Yakuza 
(organized crime family) and is aﬃ  liated with the Yama-
guchi-gumi (Japan’s largest organized crime family) as a 
boryokudan (used primarily for muscle). Triads are the 
oldest of the Chinese organized crime (COC) groups. 
Th e Triads engage in a wide range of criminal activities, 
including money laundering, drug traﬃ  cking, gambling, 
on America’s reputation as the “land of opportunity.” Th e 
rise of Asian, Latino, African and Russian gangs requires 
the government to redesign the ﬁ ght against organized 
crime. Nonetheless, Italian criminal groups persist as the 
stereotypical organized crime threat to American society 
and are indeed the most organized criminal presence in 
America.
ITALIAN ORGANIZED CRIME
Although most Americans lump all organized crime 
ﬁ gures of Italian descent into one general group called 
the Maﬁ a, Italian organized crime (IOC) in the United 
States actually comprises four separate groups: the Sicil-
ian Maﬁ a; the Neapolitan Camorra; the ’Ndrangheta, 
or Calabrian Maﬁ a; and Sacra Corona Unita, or “United 
Sacred Crown.” Th ese four IOCs have thousands of mem-
bers and aﬃ  liates throughout the United States, but the 
largest percentage of them operate out of New York, 
New Jersey and Philadelphia. IOC groups are heavily 
involved in drug traﬃ  cking and money laundering, as 
well as illegal gambling, political corruption, extortion, 
fraud, counterfeiting, weapons traﬃ  cking, inﬁ ltration 
of legitimate businesses, bombings, kidnappings and 
murders.
 
LCN is a nationwide alliance of criminals with both 
familial and conspiratorial connections. Although rooted 
in Italian organized crime, LCN is an Americanized ver-
sion of the “old school” maﬁ as from Italy, separate and 
distinct from the other IOC groups. LCN is, in fact, what 
most people are referring to when they speak of the Maﬁ a 
or IOC. LCN is involved in many of the same activities as 
other IOC groups, as well as labor racketeering, prostitu-
tion, pornography, tax fraud schemes and stock manip-
ulation schemes. One distinguishing feature of LCN, 
compared with all other criminal organizations in the 
United States, is how it has operated as a bridge between 
the upperworld and the underworld (Finckenauer, no 
date, p.1).
 
 Th e estimated membership of the LCN is 1,100 
nationwide, with the vast majority (roughly 80 percent) 
operating in the New York metropolitan area. Finck-
enauer (no date, p.1) explains, “Becoming a made mem-
ber of LCN requires serving an apprenticeship and then 
being proposed by a Boss. Th is is followed by gaining 
approval for membership from all the other families. 
Once approved, there is a secret, ritualized induction 
ceremony. Made membership means both honor and 
increased income.”
 
Five crime families make up New York City’s LCN: 
the Bonanno, Colombo, Genovese, Gambino and Luc-
chese families. Beside the made members, roughly 
10,000 associate members work for the families. Each 

568 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
have proliferated in the United States since the 1980s. 
Although some groups comprise members originating in 
Ghana and Liberia, by far the predominant nationality 
in African organized crime is Nigerian. According to the 
FBI, Nigerian criminal enterprises in the United States 
are most prevalent in Atlanta; Baltimore; Washington, 
DC; Chicago; Milwaukee; Dallas; Houston; New York; and 
Newark, New Jersey. Financial frauds and advance fee 
schemes, often perpetrated over the Internet, are common 
methods used by Nigerian organized crime groups. Known 
as “4-1-9 scams,” after Section 4-1-9 of the Nigerian Penal 
Code relating to fraudulent schemes, these scams prey on 
victims’ sympathy, naïveté and, often, greed, promising a 
handsome monetary reward in exchange for help making 
extortion, prostitution, loan-sharking, pornography, alien 
smuggling and numerous protection schemes.
 
Vietnamese organized crime is generally one of two 
kinds: roving or local. As the name suggests, roving bands 
travel from community to community, have a propensity 
for violence and have no permanent leaders or group loy-
alty. Th ey lack language and job skills and have no family 
in the United States. Local groups, in contrast, tend to 
band together in a certain area of a speciﬁ c community 
and have a charismatic leader. Th ey also have a propen-
sity for violence and tend to engage in extortion, illegal 
gambling and robbery.
 
AOC investigations present some unique challenges, 
primarily because of cultural and social diﬀ erences. Many 
Asians are suspicious of the police and the U.S. criminal 
justice system. Asian criminals exploit this distrust by 
preying on other Asians, secure in the knowledge that 
their crimes will most likely go unreported. Another 
challenge is that many Asian groups are very mobile 
and have associates or family scattered throughout the 
United States.
LATINO ORGANIZED CRIME
Latino organized crime groups within the United 
States include Cubans, Colombians, Mexicans and 
Dominicans. These criminal enterprises are heavily 
involved in drug trafficking, typically bringing their 
criminal organization into this country along with 
the drugs they sell. For example, most of the world’s 
cocaine market is controlled by Colombian cartels. In 
the United States, cartel representatives serve as bro-
kers to coordinate cocaine deliveries to various drug 
networks (Figure 18.4).
 
Because of Mexico’s proximity to the United States, its 
organized crime groups are becoming an increasing threat to 
the United States and are among the fastest growing gangs 
in the country. Mexican drug traﬃ  cking has had an enor-
mous impact on the United States, as organizations smug-
gle heroin, cocaine, marijuana and, most recently, meth. Th e 
Mexican Maﬁ a is a prison-based gang that has been growing 
within the U.S. correctional system for nearly 50 years and 
is found in several state prison systems. Th e Mexican Maﬁ a 
also has links to Hispanic street gangs and controls, to vary-
ing degrees, their drug traﬃ  cking activities.
AFRICAN ORGANIZED CRIME
African criminal enterprises, an emerging criminal 
threat facing law enforcement agencies worldwide and 
known to be operating in at least 80 other countries, 
Indra Lim, 20, an alleged member of the Oriental Lazyboys, a 
Chinatown street gang, appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom 
during opening statements for the murder of Oscar-winning actor 
Haing Ngor, Monday, February 23, 1998. Lim, along with alleged 
gang members Tak Sun Tan and Jason Chan, was convicted of 
killing Ngor outside his Los Angeles home and received a sentence 
of 26 years to life in prison. (© AP/Wide World Photos)

a ﬁ nancial transaction. Usually received via e-mail or fax, 
these frauds are often riddled with misspellings, improper 
grammar and other potential “tip-oﬀ s” that the corre-
spondence is less than legitimate.
RUSSIAN ORGANIZED CRIME
Russia has a 400-year history of dealing with organized 
crime groups, which for the most part kept their illegal 
activities inside the border. However, in the wake of the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian organized crime has 
gone international and poses a great threat to and chal-
lenge for U.S. justice. Th e FBI refers to these groups as Eur-
asian Organized Crime (EOC). Former FBI director Louis 
Freeh has called the Russian Maﬁ a the fastest-growing 
criminal organization in the United States.
 
Unlike members of organized crime groups originat-
ing from economically and educationally disadvantaged 
areas, EOC members tend to be well educated. EOC has 
had little to no involvement in some of the more tradi-
tional organized crime activities, such as drug traﬃ  cking, 
loan-sharking and gambling, choosing instead to focus 
on a wide range of frauds and scams, including insur-
ance scams, securities and investment fraud and fuel oil 
scams. In the United States, EOC has become the primary 
purveyor of credit card scams. Contract murders, kidnap-
pings and business arson are also common. In addition to 
transnational money laundering, Russian organized crime 
is known to traﬃ  c in women and children.
 
They also traffic in such hazardous commodities 
as weapons and nuclear material smuggled out of their

homeland. This removal of otherwise legal raw mate-
rials is a major concern to the Russian government 
because it deprives the country of export income and 
diminishes the global market value of these goods. The 
large-scale removal of funds or capital from a country is 
called capital flight. Do not confuse money laundering 
and capital flight, which are not interchangeable terms. 
Money laundering is capital flight, but not all capital 
flight is money laundering. Money laundering is illegal; 
capital flight is not.
 
U.S. money laundering laws recognize only three 
oﬀ enses committed outside the United States as predicate 
for a charge of money laundering: drug violations, ter-
rorism and bank fraud. Any funds resulting from a theft 
from the Russian government, evasion of Russian taxes 
or bribes received by Russian oﬃ  cials can legally be pro-
cessed through U.S. banks. Such activities do not qualify 
as money laundering.
 
Investigating Russian organized crime is challenged 
by several factors. First, the EOC consists of hundreds of 
groups, all acting independently. Russian crime groups 
in the United States are loosely structured, lacking any 
formal hierarchy. Th ey tend to be ﬂ uid with membership 
ﬂ uctuating between 5 and 20 people, depending on the 
operation. Most members are already hardened crimi-
nals, have military experience and are highly educated. 
As with cases involving other immigrant organized 
crime groups, language barriers present a challenge to 
investigators. Another problem lies in the cooperation 
among and pooling of resources between Russian and 
other organized crime groups.

is a direct relationship between what officers do on 
assignment and investigation of organized crime activ-
ities. Local law enforcement officers are the first line 
of defense in controlling all crime, and organized crime 
is no exception. Because of the highly structured 
nature of many organized crime groups, law enforce-
ment officers can seldom break into these hierarchies, 
but they can remain the “eyes” and “ears” of the infor-
mation and intelligence system essential to combat 
organized crime.
The daily observations of local law enforcement ofﬁ cers 
provide vital information for investigating organized 
crime. Report all suspicious activities and persons pos-
sibly associated with organized crime to the appropriate 
person or agency.
 
Because organized crime is involved in a great num-
ber of activities, information can arise from many sources. 
Th us, your street-level observations can be critical. Every 
day you observe many conditions related to crime and 
deal with individuals who are part of the community’s 
activities. Seemingly unimportant details can ﬁ t into an 
overall picture that an intelligence unit is putting together 
(Figure 18.5).
 
Ways to become aware of people and conditions that 
suggest organized crime activity are provided by the Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Police:
ORGANIZED CRIME AND 
CORRUPTION
One of the greatest threats posed by organized 
crime is the corruption it engenders throughout 
the entire legal system. Although the police are interested in 
any corruption by public oﬃ  cials, they are especially con-
cerned about corruption in their own department. Bribes of 
police oﬃ  cers can take many forms: outright oﬀ ers of money, 
taking care of medical bills or providing free merchandise or 
free vacations. Any police oﬃ  cer who is oﬀ ered a bribe must 
report it immediately to a superior and then attempt to make 
an arrest that will involve the person making the oﬀ er as well 
as those responsible higher in the organization.
 
Some oﬃ  cials repay organized crime ﬁ gures by pro-
viding inside information that can be used to manipulate 
securities or to purchase real estate in areas of future 
development that can be sold for a much higher price.
THE POLICE RESPONSE
It is frequently difficult for local law enforce-
ment officers to understand their role in 
investigating or controlling organized crime. But there 
FIGURE 18.5
The progress and details of an organized crime 
investigation may make perfect sense to those who 
have spent months putting it together, but bringing 
others up to date can be challenging and time 
consuming. Analytical charts like this—made with 
i2 Analyst’s Notebook—can quickly uncover key 
relationships, identify patterns/trends and focus 
on important leads and clues among suspects, 
witnesses, vehicles and events. This brings into 
focus individuals at the center of organized crime 
and fraud, allowing analysts and investigators to 
pinpoint the most signiﬁ cant areas of interest in an 
investigation and aid decision makers in targeting 
their resources. (© i2 Inc.)

AGENCIES COOPERATING IN 
INVESTIGATING ORGANIZED 
CRIME
Under the authority of the 1968 Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act and the 
Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, the U.S. Justice 
Department established the Organized Crime and Racke-
teering Unit. Organized crime strike forces were formed 
throughout the country, mostly in major cities.
Organized-crime strike forces coordinate all federal
organized crime investigation activities and work
closely with state, county and municipal law 
 enforcement agencies.
 
Other agencies that play important roles in inves-
tigating organized crime are the FBI, which often has 
a member on the strike forces; the Postal Inspection 
Service, which is in charge of mail fraud, embezzle-
ments and other crimes involving material distrib-
uted through the mails; the U.S. Secret Service, which 
investigates government checks and bonds as well as 
foreign securities; the Department of Labor, which 
investigates organized crime activities related to 
labor practices and pension funds; the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, which investigates organized 
crime activities in the purchase of securities; and the 
Internal Revenue Service, which investigates viola-
tions of income tax laws. In addition to these agen-
cies, the state attorney general’s office and the district 
attorney’s office can assist police in building a case 
against organized crime figures who violate local and 
state laws.
METHODS TO COMBAT 
ORGANIZED CRIME
Because organized crime groups often have abun-
dant resources and international connections 
to help protect their interests, law enforcement must 
deploy a wide variety of tactics to conquer the threat. Pro-
active community policing and problem-solving approaches 
hold much promise in combating organized crime. Intra-
agency cooperation is also needed because most organized 
A retail establishment seems to be doing a brisk 
business—many customers coming and going. But the 
customers do not remain in the store very long and 
do not leave with packages or other evidence that pur-
chases were made. Th e store may have a meager selec-
tion of merchandise, which raises the question of how 
it can attract so many customers day after day. Th is 
could indicate the presence of a policy operation at the 
writer level or the place of business of a bookmaker’s 
commission man.
 
At about the same time each day, a package is deliv-
ered to a newsstand, bar, or other location. Later the 
package is picked up by another individual. Th e loca-
tion could be a policy drop—the place to which a policy 
writer sends his slips and/or day’s receipts.
 
You are called to investigate a beating in a bar or at 
a location near a factory or other place of employment. 
Th e incident may occur on a payday or within a couple 
of days thereafter. Th e beating may have resulted from 
the impatience of a loan shark who has not been paid 
on schedule.
 
Merchants complain about another price rise by 
the cartage company that removes their garbage or 
trash. Th ey also mention that there is either no com-
petitor to deal with or if there is one, it will not accept 
their business. Frequently, this indicates that an orga-
nized crime group is trying to monopolize the cart-
age business or limit competition through territorial 
agreements.
 
A rash of vandalism strikes a number of establish-
ments engaged in the same type of business—such as 
dry cleaning. Racketeers may be trying to coerce reluc-
tant owners into joining an association or into doing 
business with mob-controlled vendors. (Reprinted 
from Criminal Intelligence, Training Key #223, with 
 permission of the International Association of Chiefs 
of Police)
 
Make a habit of checking out new businesses in your 
area. If the enterprise requires a license, such as a bar, 
ask to see it if for no other reason than to observe who 
the owners are, ascertain the identity of the company 
that distributes or services the jukeboxes, and so forth. 
If, for example, the jukebox or vending machine distrib-
utor is a company controlled by the organized under-
world, so also might be the bar in which the equipment 
is located.
 
Report in writing all information pertaining to such 
activities, either immediately, if the activity involves an 
imminent meeting, or when time permits. Report as 
nearly as possible exact conversations with assault vic-
tims suspected of associating with organized crime mem-
bers. Th ese conversations can include names of people or 
organizations responsible for violence and crime in the 
community.

572 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
avoid direct involvement in criminal acts by planning and 
coordinating criminal activity over the phone or the Inter-
net. Consequently, electronic surveillance can be used to 
build an eﬀ ective case based on a criminal’s own words 
while avoiding the risks associated with using informants 
or undercover agents.
 
Pen registers also are important in investigating 
sophisticated criminal networks. Pen registers record 
the numbers dialed from a telephone by monitoring 
the electrical impulses of the numbers dialed. In Smith 
v. Maryland (1979), the Supreme Court held that using 
a pen register does not constitute a search within the 
meaning of the Fourth Amendment, so neither prob-
able cause nor a warrant is required to use the device. 
Several state courts, however, have held that using a 
pen register is a search under the respective state stat-
utes and that a warrant supported by probable cause 
is needed. Investigators must be familiar with their 
state’s statutes in this area. The same situation exists 
for trap-and-trace devices, which reveal the telephone 
number of the source of all incoming calls to a particular 
number. Their use may or may not require a warrant, 
depending on the specific state. Caller ID and phone 
numbers stored in speed dialers, fax machines and 
computer files can also be of assistance, as discussed in 
Chapter 17. 
 
Th e Regional Information Sharing System (RISS), 
a multijurisdictional intelligence sharing system com-
prising nearly 5,000 local, state and federal agencies, is 
another tool to help investigators identify, target, and 
remove criminal conspiracies and activities that reach 
across jurisdictional boundaries.
ASSET FORFEITURE
An eﬀ ective weapon against organized crime, as with drug 
crimes, is the asset-forfeiture program, which allows law 
enforcement agencies to seize funds and property associ-
ated with criminal activity and eﬀ ectively subjects crimi-
nals to 100 percent tax on their earnings. Asset forfeiture 
was presented in detail earlier in the section on drug-re-
lated criminal investigations.
THE DECLINE OF ORGANIZED 
CRIME?
Certainly one hopes that tougher legislation, 
improved investigative techniques and incre-
ased use of tools such as asset forfeiture have brought about 
crime activities cross jurisdictions. Surveillance and under-
cover operations are also sometimes indicated.
 
Another resource for combating organized crime is 
the local citizenry. However, victims, witnesses and oth-
ers with knowledge about organized crime activities are 
usually, and understandably, reluctant to come forth 
with information. Consequently, the government is often 
prepared to provide federal protection to those whose 
testimony is deemed crucial in building a case against 
organized crime.
 
Th e enterprise theory of investigation (ETI) is a com-
bined organized crime and drug strategy the FBI uses to 
focus investigations and prosecutions on entire criminal 
enterprises rather than on individuals. ETI is a proactive 
approach to attack a criminal organization’s structure 
and, when combined with appropriate federal and state 
laws, can enable law enforcement to eﬀ ectively target and 
terminate a criminal enterprise with a single criminal 
indictment. ETI, as with other FBI initiatives, focuses on 
major regional, national, and international crime groups 
that control large segments of organized crime’s illegal 
activities.

Electronic surveillance of suspects is essential in inves-
tigating organized crime. Organized crime leaders often 
Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano, right, appeared in Bergen 
Superior Court June 2, 2005, in Hackensack, N.J., with his attorney, 
on a murder charge stemming from the 1980 killing of a New York 
City police detective. After the prosecution’s star witness, Richard 
“The Iceman” Kuklinski, died unexpectedly shortly before he was 
scheduled to testify against Gravano, prosecutors were forced to 
drop the murder charges against Gravano. Nonetheless, Gravano is 
serving time in prison following a conviction for running an Ecstasy 
distribution ring in Arizona. (© AP/Wide World Photos)

have been redirected toward counterterrorism eﬀ orts, 
allowing a resurgence in organized crime activity through-
out the country.
 
It is sometimes diﬃ  cult to determine whether crimi-
nal events are the work of organized crime or of gangs. 
Many deﬁ ning characteristics of organized crime groups 
are strikingly similar to those of better-organized gangs, 
and prison gangs often have direct ties to organized crime 
groups. Gangs are the focus of Chapter 19.

have forced a decline in the threat of traditional organized 
crime, the vacancies left by recent LCN associates and 
Gambino crime family members will easily be ﬁ lled by any 
number of new criminal enterprises ﬁ nding their way onto 
American soil.
 
Furthermore, in the wake of the September 11, 2001, 
terrorist attacks, many  of the law enforcement resources 
previously allocated to organized crime investigations

CHECKLISTS
In 1914, the federal government passed the Harrison 
Narcotics Act, which made the sale or use of certain drugs 
illegal. It is illegal to possess or use narcotics or other dan-
gerous drugs without a prescription; it is illegal to sell or 
distribute them without a license. Drugs can be classiﬁ ed 
as depressants, stimulants, narcotics, hallucinogens, can-
nabis or inhalants. Th e most common drugs on the street, 
in possession of users and seized in drug raids are cocaine, 
codeine, crack, heroin, marijuana, morphine and opium. 
Arrest for possession or use of marijuana is the most fre-
quent drug arrest.
 
Physical evidence of possession or use of controlled 
substances includes the actual drugs, apparatus associated 
with their use, the suspect’s appearance and behavior and 
urine and blood tests. Th e actual transfer of drugs from the 
seller to the buyer is the major legal evidence required for 
prosecuting drug sale cases. If you observe what appears 
to be a drug buy, you can make a warrantless arrest if you 
have probable cause. Often, however, it is better simply to 
observe and gather information. Undercover drug buys 
are carefully planned, witnessed and conducted so that no 
charge of entrapment can be made. Two or more buys are 
made to avoid the charge of entrapment. Clandestine drug 
laboratories present physical, chemical and toxic hazards to 
law enforcement oﬃ  cers who raid them.
 
Th e Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) pro-
vides uniﬁ ed leadership in attacking narcotics traﬃ  cking 
and drug abuse. Th e DEA’s emphasis is on the source and 
distribution of illicit drugs rather than on arresting abus-
ers. Th e key to reducing drug abuse is prevention coupled 
with treatment. 
 
Distinctive characteristics of organized crime include 
deﬁ nite organization and control, high-proﬁ t and con-
tinued-proﬁ t crimes, singular control through force and 
threats and protection through corruption. It is a pros-
ecutable conspiracy to acquire any enterprise with money 
obtained from illegal activity; to acquire, maintain or con-
trol any enterprise by illegal means; or to use any enter-
prise to conduct illegal activity.
 
Organized crime is continuously attempting to do all 
of the preceding with money obtained through its heavy 
involvement in gambling, drugs, pornography, prostitu-
tion, fraud, loan-sharking, money laundering and inﬁ ltra-
tion of legitimate businesses. Th e daily observations of 
local law enforcement oﬃ  cers provide vital information 
for investigating organized crime. All suspicious activi-
ties and persons possibly associated with organized crime 
must be reported to the appropriate person or agency. 
Organized crime strike forces coordinate all federal orga-
nized crime activities and work closely with state, county 
and municipal law enforcement agencies.
SUMMARY

CHAPTER 18 | A Dual Threat: Drug-Related Crime and Organized Crime | 575
in this little town was ordering chemicals often used to 
make illegal substances. No. 2 came under suspicion when 
he told a local deputy sheriﬀ  he would be paid $2,000 if he 
notiﬁ ed him of any narcotics investigations.
 
Th e two men have been under surveillance for several 
weeks. One agent has even been inside the house by tak-
ing a shipment of chemicals from the Connecticut ﬁ rm and 
making a “controlled delivery”—that is, he pretended to be 
the mailman and hauled the heavy boxes inside the house.
 
Th e agents have noticed a pattern. On Wednesdays, 
No. 1’s wife goes into town and No. 2 stops by. It is Wednes-
day night. Th e plan is to watch No. 2 enter and leave the 
house and arrest him before he reaches his car. Assuming 
he is carrying illegal drugs, the agents will arrest No. 1 as 
well, search his home and seize the contents of the lab. 
Both men are known to be armed.
 
By 7 P.M., surveillance has begun in earnest. Th e eight 
agents are waiting for something to happen. Two agents 
sit in an unmarked car along the highway leading to the 
house. Two others are in the woods, within view of the 
house. Th e other four are in the camper, parked just oﬀ  
the highway. Even from inside, the camper looks nor-
mal. But its cabinets contain an array of radios, cameras, 
lenses, ﬁ rearms and other gear. From the camper’s bath-
room, one agent takes out a telephoto lens the size of a 
small wastebasket and attaches it to a “night scope.”
 
At about 7:15, the woman leaves.
 
Each of the three groups of agents has a radio. How-
ever, No. 1 is believed to have a police scanner, which 
would allow him to monitor their conversation. So they 
speak in a rough sort of code, as though they were squad 
cars checking for speeders. “401,” for example, will mean 
that No. 2 has arrived.
 
Hours pass. None of the agents has eaten since noon. 
Th ey pass around a bag of Halloween-sized Snickers bars 
and start telling narc stories.
 
At 10, a sober, low voice over the radio says, “You may 
have three visitors shortly.” A few minutes later, three 
agents climb into the camper, shivering. One agent, who 
has been watching No. 1 through his kitchen window with 
binoculars, says, “He’s busy in there. He’s pouring stuﬀ , 
and he’s running something, like a tableting machine.”
 
Th e agents know that if they could just bust into that 
house, they’d ﬁ nd a guilty man surrounded by evidence. 
No. 2 doesn’t show. Another night wasted?
Questions
 1. Do the agents have probable cause to conduct a raid at 
this time?
 2. Could they seize the materials No. 1 is working with 
as plain-view evidence? Why or why not?
• • Are goods being received at a store that do not ﬁ t with 
merchandise sold there?
• • Has a discount store suddenly appeared without a 
clear indication of true ownership?
• • Has arson suddenly increased?
• • Do non-employees hang around manufacturing plants 
or nonstudents hang around a school? (Th is could 
indicate a bookie operation or drug sales.)
• • Is the same person using a pay telephone at the same 
time each day?
• • Is evidence of betting operations being left in public 
wastebaskets or trash containers on the streets?
• • When assaults occur, what are the motives? Could they 
be a result of gambling debts owed to a loan shark?
• • Are people seen going into and out of certain busi-
nesses with which they are not ordinarily associated?
• • Are known gamblers or persons with other criminal 
records repeatedly seen in a speciﬁ c location?
Th e Stakeout (Adapted from an account of an actual nar-
cotics investigation written by David Peterson): It is dark 
as the ﬁ ve men emerge from the plane. Th ey haul out their 
luggage and walk to the parking lot of the tiny, one-strip 
airport. Th e pilot enters a white shack that is trimmed 
in red. When the pilot leaves, the others gather around a 
young man who has driven out to meet them. His name is 
Bruce Preece, and he looks like an outdoorsman. Bearded, 
he wears a suede hat and red plaid jacket.
 
Moments later, a camper occupied by two more men 
pulls into the parking lot, and most of the group pile into 
the back. Seated along foam-rubber benches, they are dim in 
the shadows as the camper moves through the empty town.
 
“Th at guy sure was an inquisitive one,” the pilot remarks, 
referring to the man in the shack. “He knew we were here 
last week, and he wanted to know what we were up to.”
 
“Tourists,” someone else replies, his head silhouetted 
against a window. Everyone looks like a visitor—a hunter, 
perhaps, or a ﬁ sherman. Th ey carry small bags and wear 
down jackets and jeans. Th e clothing is deceptive.
 
Four narcotics agents, or narcs, and four agents from 
the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration are staked 
out in a camper outside the home of a man who works for 
a chemical ﬁ rm. Th ey suspect that at home he is manufac-
turing illegal drugs in a clandestine laboratory. Th e agents 
call him “No. 1.”
 
Th ey suspect that another man is getting illegal drugs 
and distributing them in nearby towns. Th ey call him “No. 2.”
 
No. 1 came under suspicion when a chemical supply 
company in Connecticut notiﬁ ed the feds that someone

n Minneapolis, a 12-year-old boy and an 18-year-old
 man, both with ties to a local gang, are shot to death 
while sitting in a car parked behind an apartment building, 
allegedly by a reputed member of a rival gang. In Denver, 
a 16-year-old girl tries to break free from gang life and is 
stabbed to death a month later by a rival gang member.
 
In Jasper, Texas, a Black man is chained by his ankles 
to a pickup truck and dragged to his death, his head and

THE THREAT OF GANGS: 
AN OVERVIEW
Gangs have been of interest and concern for centu-
ries. Street gangs have existed in the United 
States for most of the country’s history and have been studied 
since the 1920s. Th e 1900s saw street gangs ﬂ ourishing, inﬂ u-
enced by such mobsters as Al Capone. And gangs continue to 
pose a problem for law enforcement in the 21st century.
Belonging to a gang is not illegal in this country; 
however, many activities that gangs engage in are illegal. 
Gangs traﬃ  c in drugs; commit shootings, assaults, rob-
bery, extortion and other felonies; and terrorize neigh-
borhoods. Previously loose-knit groups of juveniles and 
young adults who engaged in petty crimes have, over time, 
become powerful, organized gangs, representing a form 
of domestic terrorism. Gang wars, drive-by shootings and 
disregard for innocent bystanders have a chilling eﬀ ect. 
Gangs now exist in almost every community.
To investigate gang-related crimes eﬀ ectively, law 
enforcement personnel must understand the makeup of 
these organizations, what types of crimes to expect, how 
to identify their members and how to deal with the special 
challenges of investigating such crimes.
GANGS DEFINED
Though no single deﬁ nition exists to describe a 
gang, every deﬁ nition available includes some 
mention of the word group (Delaney, 2006, p.6). Some 
deﬁ nitions emphasize criminal activity whereas others stress 
territoriality. One commonly accepted deﬁ nition is that a 
gang is a group of individuals with a recognized name and 
symbols who form an allegiance for a common purpose and 
engage in continuous unlawful activity. A deﬁ nition com-
monly accepted by law enforcement is that a gang is any 
group gathering continuously to commit antisocial behavior. 
A broadly applicable deﬁ nition of street gangs has 
evolved from several years’ worth of intense discussions 
among working groups of American and European gang 
researchers in an assembly that has come to be known as 
the Eurogang program. Th e Eurogang consensus nominal 
deﬁ nition of a street gang is “any durable, street- oriented 
youth group whose own identity includes involvement in 
illegal activity” (Klein, 2007, p.18).
EXTENT OF GANGS
The last quarter of the 20th century saw signiﬁ -
cant growth in gang problems across the coun-
try. In the 1970s, less than half the states reported youth 
gang problems, but by the late 1990s, every state and the 
District of Columbia reported gang activity. During that 
same period, the number of cities reporting youth gang 
problems mushroomed nearly tenfold.
Gangs range in size from small groups of 3 to 5 to as 
many as several thousand. Nationally known gangs such 
as the Crips number around 50,000 and the Bloods num-
ber about 20,000 to 30,000. Large gangs are normally bro-
ken down into smaller groups but are known collectively 
under one name. More than 90 percent of gangs have 
between 3 and 100 members, and only 4 percent have 

CHAPTER 19 | Criminal Activities of Gangs and Other Dangerous Groups | 581
more than 100 members. Th e number of gangs in large 
cities ranges from 1,200 to 1,500.
From 1999 to 2001, an estimated 731,500 gang mem-
bers and more than 21,500 gangs were active in the United 
States, posing a signiﬁ cant problem, especially in large cit-
ies (250,000 people or more) (Egley, Howell and Major, 
2006). Th e raw numbers have increased since then. Th ere 
are now more than 30,000 gangs in communities through-
out the country, with an estimated 800,000 gang mem-
bers (Pistole, 2008). Th e FBI Web site also reports these 
ﬁ gures and states that many gangs are sophisticated and 
well organized; all use violence to control neighborhoods 
and boost their illegal money-making activities, which 
include drug traﬃ  cking, robbery, theft, fraud, extortion, 
prostitution rings and gun traﬃ  cking.
According to the National Youth Gang Survey (NYGS), 
published by the Oﬃ  ce of Juvenile Justice and Delin-
quency Prevention (OJJDP), the percentage of law 
enforcement agencies reporting gang problems in 2006 
was 14.9 percent in rural counties, 32.6 percent in smaller 
cities, 51.0 percent in suburban counties and 86.4 percent 
in larger cities, with an overall percentage of 33.3 percent 
(Egley and O’Donnell, 2008). Th ese percentages represent 
a decrease in reported gang problem from 2002 to 2006 
because at the beginning of 2002, the overall percentage 
of law enforcement agencies reporting gang problems 
was 47.3 percent: 27.4 percent of rural counties reported 
a gang problem, smaller cities, 48.3 percent, suburban 
counties, 61.5 percent, and larger cities, 90.5 percent. 
The number of gangs and gang members has decreased 
over the last few years, but gang-related crime is still a 
major concern to law enforcement. 
Delaney (2006, p.65) contends, “Gangs are so preva-
lent today that they have reached institutional status. . . . 
By the end of the twentieth century, gangs had proliferated 
in nearly all geographic areas of the United States. Gangs 
can be found in the suburbs, in small cities, and on Native 
American reservations. Today, their numbers continue to 
grow, and street gangs will remain as a major social prob-
lem in American society for some time to come.”
According to the NYGS, more than half of the respond-
ing law enforcement agencies reported that intergang 
conﬂ ict and drug-related factors directly aﬀ ected levels 
of gang-related violence. Activities somewhat frequently 
reported were gang-member migration across U.S. juris-
dictions, the emergence of new gangs and the return of 
gang members from secure conﬁ nement.
GANG MIGRATION
Th e gang problem is not restricted to metropolitan areas. 
As society in general has become more mobile, gangs and 
gang members have also increased their mobility, contrib-
uting to gang migration: “Like a cancer, gangs are spread-
ing to communities across America. Gang violence has 
become a part of the daily lives of teachers and taxi drivers, 
police oﬃ  cers and pastors, parents and children” (Pistole, 
2008). Whereas early gangs tended to exist primarily in 
large cities near the country’s borders (Los Angeles, New 
York, Miami, Chicago), gangs are now sending members 
across the country and into the nation’s heartland to take 
advantage of new territory, diminished competition from 
other gangs and law enforcement agencies with less expe-
rience in dealing with gang activity. 
WHY PEOPLE JOIN GANGS
Gangs provide acceptance and protection to 
inner-city youth. Gangs oﬀ er a sense of belong-
ing and importance to their members that society and 
family do not provide. Gang members gradually dissociate 
from social conformity and become responsible only to 
themselves and their group activities. Oft-cited reasons 
for joining a gang are material reasons, recreation, a place 
of refuge and camouﬂ age, physical protection, resistance 
against parents or society and a lack of commitment to 
community (Shelden, Tracy and Brown, 2004, pp.77–78). 
According to Delaney (2006, p.101), “Gang researchers 
and social policymakers have identiﬁ ed and discussed a 
number of traditional socioeconomic factors that impact 
on an individual’s decision to join a gang. Th ese factors are 
the shifting labor market, the development of an under-
class (a nontraditional explanation, as the term underclass 
is a relatively new concept, but the conditions that led to 
the development of an underclass have traditional roots), 
poverty and the feminization of poverty, the breakdown 
of the nuclear family, lack of a quality education, and the 
gang’s oﬀ ering of acceptance, protection, and survival.” 
TYPES OF GANGS
Klein and colleagues have identiﬁ ed ﬁ ve types of 
gangs. Klein (2007, pp.54–55) notes,
Th ere is no one form of street gang. Gangs can be large 
or small, long term or short term, more or less territo-
rial, more or less criminally involved, and so on. If one 
treats all gangs as being the same, then the treatment 
will often be wrong, perhaps even making things 
worse. . . . It is the fact of gang diversity itself that 
should make us cautious about generalizing too quickly 
about their nature.

582 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
inner cities; engage in rather petty crimes but some-
times violence, often just for fun; members have 
no greater bond than their impulsiveness and need 
to belong; lack goals and are low achievers; often 
 illiterate with poor school performance.
• • Serious delinquent gangs —heavy involvement 
in both serious and minor crimes, but much lower 
involvement in drug use and drug sales than party 
gangs.
• • Territorial gangs—associated with a speciﬁ c area 
or turf and, as a result, get involved in conﬂ icts with 
other gangs over their respective turfs.
• • Organized/corporate gangs —heavy involvement 
in all kinds of crime, heavy use and sale of drugs; may 
resemble major corporations, with separate divisions 
handling sales, marketing, discipline and so on; disci-
pline is strict, and promotion is based on merit.
• • Drug gangs—smaller than other gangs; much more 
cohesive; focused on the drug business; strong, 
 centralized leadership with market-deﬁ ned roles. 
(Th e link between gangs and drugs is discussed later 
in the chapter.)
Criminologists have classiﬁ ed gangs as cultural or 
instrumental.
Cultural gangs are neighborhood centered and exist 
independently of criminal activity. Instrumental gangs 
are formed for the express purpose of criminal activity, 
primarily drug trafﬁ cking.
Criminal activity, however, is one of the distinguish-
ing characteristics of a gang. Table 19.1 summarizes sev-
eral types of criminal organizations, most of which are 
gangs, listing their names and the types of criminal activ-
ity they engage in.
GIRL GANGS
Although the number of female gangs is increasing, gangs 
are still predominately male. Th ree types of female gang 
involvement are (1) membership in an independent gang, 
(2) membership in a male gang as a coed and (3) member-
ship in a female auxiliary of a male gang (Shelden et al., 
2004, p.142). Most girls are found within the third type: 
“Female gangs have been around for nearly as long as 
male gangs. Despite the growing evidence for indepen-
dent female gangs, most of them remain auxiliary to male 
gangs. Most researchers believe that 10 percent of all gang 
members are females. Female gang members are very 
capable of committing violent criminal acts but not in the 
same proportion as males” (Delaney, 2006, p.227).
 
We have shown “traditional” and “nontraditional” 
gangs to be the largest, longest-enduring, and most 
crime-producing gangs. Th ey are not the most common 
form, but they best ﬁ t the media stereotype of large 
inner-city gangs with strong intergang rivalries and 
 violent tendencies.
 
“Compressed” gangs, primarily adolescent groups 
of 50 to 100 members and less then ten years’ duration, 
are the most common, found in both large and small 
cities. Least common are “collective” gangs, rather 
amorphous, but large collections with little internal 
structure, sometimes held together by loose neighbor-
hood ties and extensive drug dealing. Th e smallest in 
size of our ﬁ ve types, but the most tightly structured, 
is the “specialty” gang, which is not versatile like the 
other four types, but rather manifests a narrow pattern 
of criminal behavior. Drug gangs, robbery or burglary 
gangs, car theft gangs and skinheads are common 
examples.
Gangs can be diﬀ erentiated in many ways: “Distinc-
tions can be made based on such variables as age (e.g., a 
baby, posse or veteranos), race and ethnicity (Hispanic, 
African American, Native American, or, in rare cases, 
mixed), gender composition (all males, all females or 
mixed), setting (e.g., streets, prison or motorcycle), type of 
activity (e.g., drug sales protection, violence, turf defense, 
etc.), degree of criminality (e.g., minor or serious), and so 
on” (Delaney, 2006, p.133).
Shelden et al. (2004, pp.42–43) oﬀ er another way 
of classifying gangs, describing the major types of gangs 
identiﬁ ed by various studies and diﬀ erent researchers 
nationwide:
• • Hedonistic/social gangs—only moderate drug 
use and oﬀ ending, involved mainly in using drugs 
and having a good time; little involvement in crime, 
 especially violent crime
• • Party gangs—commonly called “party crews”; rela-
tively high use and sale of drugs, but only one major 
form of delinquency—vandalism; may contain both 
genders or may be one gender; many have no speciﬁ c 
dress style, but some dress in stylized clothing worn 
by street gang members, such as baseball caps and 
oversize clothing; some have tattoos and use hand 
signs; their ﬂ exible turf is called the “party scene”; 
crews compete over who throws the biggest party, 
with alcohol, marijuana, nitrous oxide, sex and music 
critical party elements.
• • Predatory gangs—heavily involved in serious crimes 
(robberies, muggings) and the abuse of addictive drugs 
such as crack cocaine; may engage in selling drugs but 
not in organized fashion.
• • Scavenger gangs—loosely organized groups 
described as “urban survivors”; prey on the weak in

problem. Most female gang members have children, and 
since the fathers generally refuse to take family responsi-
bility, the ﬁ scal burden is often shifted onto society in the 
form of welfare programs. As gang children age, they inev-
itably become active in gangbanging themselves. Th us, 
another generation of gang members is guaranteed and 
their numbers will continue to increase for some time.”
ETHNIC GANGS
Much has been written about the various ethnic gangs 
in the United States. Among the most well known are 
Th e 2005 National Gang Th reat Assessment notes that 
young women continue to take active roles in gangs, assist-
ing in the movement of drugs and weapons and gathering 
intelligence from other gangs (p.v). A female gang may 
have a name aﬃ  liated with its male counterpart, such as 
the Vice Ladies (from the Vice Lords). Th ese auxiliaries 
usually consist of sisters and girlfriends of the male gang 
members. Th e females often assist the male gang, serving 
as decoys for rival gang members, as lookouts during the 
commission of crimes or as carriers of weapons when a 
gang war is impending. Th ey may also carry information 
in and out of prison and provide sexual favors (they are 
often drug dependent and physically abused). 
A general consensus exists in the research literature 
that girls join gang life for the same reasons as their male 
counterparts—to meet basic human needs such as belong-
ing or being a member of a family, self-esteem and protec-
tion (2005 National Gang Th reat Assessment, p.175). “Some 
girls readily admit that they join because they are bored and 
look to gangs for a social life; they are looking for fun and 
excitement, and a means to ﬁ nd parties and boys” (Eghigian 
and Kirby, 2006, p.49). A review of research on girl gangs 
shows that some young women ﬁ nd themselves trapped 
in horrible social conditions “characterized by widespread 
poverty and racism” (Shelden et al., 2004, p.174).
Delaney (2006, p.227) points out, “Th e single fact 
that so many female gang members come from abusive 
and sexually exploitive environments is a strong reason 
for considering female gang membership a serious social

Note: Although nationality and ethnicity are often unifying characteristics of criminal organizations and used to identify them, this view is overly narrow and promotes ethnic 
stereotypes. The organization of criminal groups by nationality and ethnicity in this table is not intended to suggest that criminal behavior is characteristic of any group; 
ethnicity, however, is often a marker to police.

National Gang Task Force, spearheaded by the FBI, whose 
goal is to decimate MS-13. Th e FBI has also established the 
Transnational Anti-Gang (TAG) initiative with partners in 
El Salvador’s Policia Nacional Civil (PNC). Th e TAG allows 
the FBI and PNC to share valuable intelligence, a partner-
ship that has proven successful. Th e ﬁ rst joint operation 
conducted in late September 2007 resulted in the arrests 
of 10 violent MS-13 gang members, the seizure of ﬁ re-
arms and the recovery of a 3-year-old child missing since 
his mother’s death.
Native American Gangs Gang activity in Indian Coun-
try is a relatively new phenomenon, and scant research has 
examined the extent and nature of such gangs. However, 
several studies have found that gangs are posing an increas-
ing threat to tribal reservations: “Indian Country is fertile 
ground for the proliferation of youth gangs, for many 
young Indians have come to believe that traditional values 
are irrelevant to their lives” (Bell and Lim, 2005, p.626). 
Some of the reasons Native teens join gangs are simi-
lar to those of youth joining gangs in mainstream society: 
fragmented and dysfunctional families, poverty, substance 
abuse and the search to ﬁ t in and belong to a peer group. 
For youths in Indian Country, “Reservation gangs ﬁ ll a cul-
tural void by providing a sense of belonging and initiations 
similar to tribal rights of passage” (Peterson, 2008). Other 
factors contributing to the proliferation and spread of 
Native American gangs include the frequency with which 
families move oﬀ  and onto the reservation, the develop-
ment of cluster housing as opposed to traditional single-
family housing, and a diminished connection of Indian 
youth to Native American culture and traditional kinship 
ties (Major et al., 2004, p.5). And, similar to the increasing 
involvement of girls in gangs in the broader society, Native 
girls have demonstrated higher levels of gang involvement 
in recent years (Peterson, 2008). Indian gangs are a sig-
niﬁ cant problem in Minneapolis, Minnesota; throughout 
Arizona; and in the Pine Ridge area of South Dakota.
HYBRID GANGS
A new breed of increasingly violent street gangs appearing 
throughout the country is hybrid gangs, in which several 
small groups, some of them rivals, band together into one 
larger gang (Ortega and Calderoni, 2007). Members of 
hybrid gangs are generally young and particularly proﬁ t 
driven. Th ey thrive in areas with relatively new gang prob-
lems and often include gangbangers who have migrated 
from larger cities. Th ese gangs represent a “sea of change 
in gang culture” and bear little resemblance to traditional 
gangs. Unlike older gangs based on race or neighborhood 
loyalty, this new generation is singularly focused on mak-
ing money from drugs, robbery and prostitution.
African American gangs (Bloods, Crips, Vice Lords), 
Hispanic gangs (Latin Kings and Mara Salvatrucha 13), 
Asian gangs (Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Hmong) and 
Indian Country gangs. An in-depth discussion of ethnic 
gangs is beyond the scope of this text. However, the fol-
lowing trends are noted in the most recent available 2005 
National Gang Th reat Assessment (p.v):
• • Hispanic gang membership is on the rise. Th ese 
gangs are migrating and expanding their jurisdictions 
throughout the country. Identiﬁ cation and diﬀ er-
entiation of these gangs pose new obstacles for law 
enforcement, especially in rural communities.
• • Migration of California-style gang culture remains 
a particular threat. Th e migration spreads the reach 
of gangs into new neighborhoods and promotes a 
ﬂ ourishing gang subculture.
• • Indian Country is increasingly reporting escalating 
levels of gang activity and gang-related crime and drug 
traﬃ  cking. Th e remote nature of many reservations 
and a thriving gang subculture make youths in these 
environments particularly vulnerable to gangs.
Th e literature on ethnic gangs is abundant, and the 
trends remain in evidence. However, two of the preceding 
trends deserve expansion.
Mara Salvatrucha 13 (MS-13) Th e Mara Salvatrucha 13 
(MS-13) is considered by many gang experts to be America’s 
most dangerous gang and is currently spreading from El Sal-
vador to Los Angeles and across the United States. MS-13 
targets middle- and high-school students and is estimated 
to have 10,000 members operating in 42 states, with the 
largest clusters living in Los Angeles; Washington, DC; and 
the Mid-Atlantic region: “Th e gang’s terrifying reputation 
includes a callous disregard for life and a willingness to use 
extreme violence with weapons ranging from machetes to 
semi-automatic riﬂ es. Machetes, decapitations, and sexual 
violence against victims are common tools of intimidation” 
(McLemore, 2006). MS-13 is active in smuggling people, 
drugs and guns across the border. 
Delaney (2006, p.177) explains that the number 
13 is signiﬁ cant as the letter “M” is the thirteenth let-
ter of the alphabet. Th e “S” stands for both Salvador and 
Sureno, Spanish for “Southerner.” Th e colors of MS-13 are 
the same as most of the Central American national ﬂ ags: 
blue, gray, white and black. Females are allowed to join 
MS-13 but must endure the same initiation ceremony as 
males, a violation ritual where several gang members beat 
the recruit to test his or her ability to take a beating. If a 
recruit fails the initiation rite of passage, he or she is mur-
dered for lack of courage and spirit (Delaney).
Th e urgency of dealing with MS-13 is illustrated by the 
formation of a major national gang task force, the MS-13

any type of terrorist organization appears to be highest 
in prison.
GANG CULTURE, MEMBERSHIP 
AND ORGANIZATION
Some gang experts talk about the three R’s of the 
gang culture: reputation, respect and revenge. 
Reputation is of prime concern to gang members, both 
individually and collectively. Th ey expect, indeed demand, 
respect. And they are required to show disrespect for rival 
gang members, called a “diss” in gang slang: “Without 
question, the subcultural value that carries the highest 
value for all gang members is respect. Any sign of disre-
spect shown toward a gang or gang member, will result in 
retaliation with extreme prejudice” (Delaney, 2006, 
p.150). Disrespect inevitably leads to the third R—re-
venge. Every challenge must be answered, often in the 
form of a drive-by shooting.
Most gangs are of limited numbers suﬃ  cient for the 
entire group to meet and discuss things in person. Inci-
dents that happen to them or that are expressly initiated 
by them cause them to identify as a group. Sometimes 
gang members are multigenerational—that is, father and 
son may have been members of the same gang. Most gang 
members are unemployed or work at part-time jobs. Many 
are most active at night and sleep during the day. Some 
stay with their gangs into adulthood, and others may go 
back to school or gain full-time employment, usually in 
jobs with very low pay.
Most gang members are weak academically because 
they lack good study habits, although they are mentally 
capable. Th is is an important factor because gangs are 
essentially self-operated and self-governed. Some operate 
by consensus, but most have leaders and a subgoverning 
structure. Leadership may be single or dual. Status is gen-
erally obtained by joining the gang, but equal status within 
the gang once joined is not automatically guaranteed.
Gang members have diﬀ ering levels of commitment 
and involvement in gang activities. Most gang members 
are either hard-core, associate or peripheral members. 
Th e hard-core members are those most dedicated to the 
gang. Knowing how a gang is organized and what level 
of involvement a member has can be of great assistance 
to investigators. Th e hard-core member is least likely to 
cooperate with the police; the peripheral members are 
most likely to be cooperative.
A gang’s degree of organization inﬂ uences the behav-
ior observed among its members, with even low levels of 
organization having important implications regarding 
OUTLAW MOTORCYCLE GANGS
Th e major outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMGs) are the Hell’s 
Angels, Bandidos, Outlaws and Pagans. Th ese gangs’ pri-
mary source of income is drug traﬃ  cking, but they are 
also involved in murder, assault, kidnapping, prostitution, 
money laundering, weapons traﬃ  cking, intimidation, extor-
tion, arson and smuggling. Th e 2005 National Gang Th reat 
Assessment (p.v) reports that OMGs are expanding their 
territory and forming new clubs, as reﬂ ected in increased 
violence among them as they battle for territories.
PRISON GANGS
Although prison gangs would seem to be more of a prob-
lem for corrections, the 2005 National Gang Th reat Assess-
ment (p.v) notes, “Prison gangs pose a unique threat to 
law enforcement and communities. Incarceration of gang 
members often does little to disrupt their activities. High-
ranking gang members are often able to exert their inﬂ u-
ence on the street from within prison.” In fact, prison 
provides a prime recruiting opportunity for some gangs.
Delaney (2006, p.27) notes, “Violence and angry con-
frontations directed against rivals on the street continue 
in prison. . . . Some prison gangs are very powerful and 
command respect among inmates and street gangsters 
alike. Prison gang leaders keep in contact with outside 
gangbangers in a number of ways, including through indi-
viduals who visit gang leaders in prison and receive com-
mands; correctional oﬃ  cers and other staﬀ  members who 
have been bribed, coerced or extorted; and direct contact 
with street gangsters via phone calls from prison gang 
leaders behind bars.”
GANGS, ORGANIZED CRIME 
AND TERRORISM
The 2005 National Gang Th reat Assessment (p.v) 
reports that gangs are associating with orga-
nized crime entities, such as Mexican drug organizations, 
Asian criminal groups and Russian organized crime 
groups. Th ese groups often turn to gangs to conduct low-
level criminal activity, protect territories and facilitate 
drug-traﬃ  cking activities. Th e primary goal of any associ-
ation between these groups is ﬁ nancial gain.
A more hopeful ﬁ nding is that few gangs have been 
found to associate with domestic terrorist organizations. 
Of the domestic terrorist groups identiﬁ ed, most were 
White supremacist groups (2005 National Gang Th reat 
Assessment, p.v). Th e susceptibility of gang members to 

CHAPTER 19 | Criminal Activities of Gangs and Other Dangerous Groups | 587
have the most graﬃ  ti. It may name members of the gang, 
often in order of authority, listed in neat rows under the 
gang’s logo. Reading graﬃ  ti is discussed later in the chap-
ter. Unchallenged graﬃ  ti aﬃ  rms the gang’s control. With 
the increasing mobility of society, graﬃ  ti no longer has to 
necessarily remain within a gang’s turf.
Hispanic graﬃ  ti is highly artistic and very detailed. 
It frequently refers to group or gang power. In contrast, 
graﬃ  ti of Black gangs shows less ﬂ air and attention to 
detail and often is ﬁ lled with profanity as well as expres-
sions of individual power. Th e symbolism is more obvious 
and often includes weapons. Figure 19.1 shows some typi-
cal symbols used by various gangs in their graﬃ  ti.
TATTOOS
Tattoos are also used by some gangs, particularly outlaw 
motorcycle gangs and Hispanic gangs. Gang tattoos are 
meant to intimidate, show gang aﬃ  liation and indicate 
rant, and they are a gang member’s permanent record, 
telling who he is, what he believes, what he’s done, where 
he’s been, where he did time and for how many years and 
how many people he’s killed. An oﬃ  cer trained to read 
gang tattoos can discern a suspect’s history: “If gang graf-
ﬁ ti is the newspaper of the street, then gang tattoos are 
the ‘signposts to the soul’” (Valdemar, 2006, p.30).
GANG ACTIVITIES
Many gang activities are similar to those of other 
segments of society and are not illegal. Gangs 
gather informally on streets and street corners, in parks, 
homes, abandoned buildings, vehicles, vacant lots or recre-
ational areas and buildings. Indeed, many of the deﬁ ning 
characteristics of a gang could apply to any other organiza-
tion in society, with the exception of the purpose, which is 
to engage in antisocial or criminal behavior. Not all gangs 
engage in criminal behavior, however. Some “gangs” form 
out of normal relationships in a neighborhood or a school. 
If they do not engage in antisocial behavior, nothing ever 
happens that causes them to feel a need to “band together” 
to protect their group from outside activity or threats. Th e 
gang remains a social group or club.
However, when a gang forms for social reasons and 
then outside activities occur that endanger one or more of 
the members, the group may “close ranks” and act as a group 
in their defense. For example, the group may be having a 
meeting in the park and an outside group beats up a few of 
the members. Group members may report this to the police 
or may decide to take matters into their own hands and 
criminality: “Indeed, even incremental increases in gang 
organization are related to increased involvement in 
oﬀ ending and victimization” (Decker, Katz and Webb, 
2008, p.153).
SYMBOLS
Gang symbols are common. Clothing, hand signals, graf-
ﬁ ti and tattoos are all used as symbolic representations 
of a person’s aﬃ  liation with a speciﬁ c gang. Clothing can 
distinguish a particular gang. Sometimes “colors” are used 
to distinguish a gang. Gang members also use jerseys, 
T-shirts and jackets with emblems, athletic team logos 
or designer crests. However, some gangs, such as Asian 
gangs, don’t have a particular dress code, making identiﬁ -
cation diﬃ  cult. Another form of symbolic communication 
typical of gang members is hand signals. Certain signs are 
ﬂ ashed to indicate membership in a speciﬁ c gang. Sym-
bols are often displayed in graﬃ  ti to mark a gang’s turf.
TURF AND GRAFFITI
Many gangs establish a turf, the geographic area of domina-
tion that gang members will defend to the death. Th e turf 
includes the schools, businesses, residential areas, streets 
and alleys in the area, all controlled through fear, intimida-
tion, and violence. In the past, turf wars took the form of 
gang ﬁ ghts. Today, however, they often take the form of 
drive-by shootings from a moving vehicle, many of which 
have killed innocent citizens as well as rival gang members.
Gangs identify their turf through graﬃ  ti, called 
“throwing a placa.” Other gangs may challenge the turf 
claim by writing over or crossing out the graﬃ  ti and 
replacing it with their own. Such cross-outs are usually 
found at the edge of a gang’s territory. Gang members 
caught in the act of crossing out graﬃ  ti in a rival’s terri-
tory may be killed, or a turf war can result. Gang graﬃ  ti 
is a source of frustration and expense to property owners 
and local governments.
In the Broken Windows crime model, graﬃ  ti is a foot-
hold crime leading to a neighborhood’s decay: “Neigh-
borhoods plagued with graﬃ  ti often become breeding 
grounds for loitering, littering, loud music, and public 
urination. . . . As ‘good’ citizens begin to avoid ‘that side 
of town,’ the criminal element becomes more comfort-
able and these small public disorder crimes snowball 
into more serious criminal behaviors. When these more 
serious crimes ﬂ ourish, it becomes diﬃ  cult to assess the 
true cost of the graﬃ  ti oﬀ ense: expenses mount in terms 
of prevention, arrests, incarceration, and lost revenue” 
(Petrocelli, 2008, p.18).
Police oﬃ  cers who deal with gangs can learn much by 
understanding wall graﬃ  ti. Th e center of a gang’s turf will

seek revenge. Other gangs form for the express purpose of 
committing antisocial behavior or criminal activities, start-
ing with the manner of initiation into the group, which may 
require shoplifting or a more serious illegal activity.
Street gang members engage in a wide variety of ille-
gal activities, from underage drinking and vandalism, to 
drug use and drug selling, petty theft, auto theft, assault, 
robbery and homicide. And although most gang crime con-
sists of relatively minor oﬀ enses, such as property dam-
age, theft and the like, the more serious, albeit infrequent, 
crimes, such as robbery, assault and murder, garner more 
publicity: “It is these more serious oﬀ enses that capture 
media attention, create fear in some communities, and 
end up receiving the most concentrated attention of the 
police and the courts” (Klein, 2007, p.37).
Tita and Ridgeway (2007, p.208) report, “Research 
has demonstrated that even after controlling for indi-
vidual level attributes, individuals who join gangs commit 
more crimes than do nongang members. Furthermore, 
the oﬀ ending level of gang members is higher when they 
report being active members of the gang. Th erefore, 
gang membership clearly facilitates oﬀ ending above and 
beyond individual level characteristics.” Table 19.2 com-
pares gang and nongang criminal behavior.
Although gang crime often involves only a few mem-
bers at a time, occasionally the entire gang, or a large por-
tion of it, participates in the illegal activity. For example, a 
surveillance video from a Las Vegas mini-market showed 
more than 40 teenagers ﬂ ooding into the tiny store. Th ree 
youths jumped the counter and robbed the cashier at gun-
point while the others ﬂ ocked to coolers. Teens clogged 
the doorways as they rushed out, carrying cases of beer 
and handfuls of food. Th e whole incident took less than 
90 seconds. Police call this technique swarming.
In addition to drug dealing, gang members often engage 
in vandalism, arson, auto theft, shoplifting, shootings, 
stabbings, intimidation and other forms of violence.
GANGS AND DRUGS
Until the early 1980s, when crack, or rock cocaine, hit the 
market, gangs engaged primarily in burglary, robbery, 
extortion and car theft. Although drug traﬃ  cking existed, 
it was nowhere near current levels. Th e reason: enormous 
proﬁ t. Economic gain is often the reason youths join 
gangs. It is hard to convince a youth that $7.50 an hour 
for busing tables is preferable to making $400 for 2 hours’ 
work as a drug courier. Th us, today, gangs remain the pri-
mary distributors of drugs throughout the United States 
(2005 National Gang Th reat Assessment, p.v). 
Some caution that drug traﬃ  cking by gangs is not 
as rampant as others might claim. Shelden et al. (2004, 

590 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
dramatically increases a gang’s ability to thrive and 
develop a power base. Th e 2005 National Gang Th reat 
Assessment (p.v) reports that about 31 percent of survey 
respondents indicated that their communities refused to 
acknowledge a local gang problem. Several communities 
began to address gang issues only when high-proﬁ le gang-
related incidents occurred.
The ﬁ rst step in dealing with a gang problem is to 
recognize it.
WARNING SIGNS OF A GANG PROBLEM
Identifying gangs is diﬃ  cult, but law enforcement, a 
school or a community can be aware of warning signs of a 
gang problem: graﬃ  ti, obvious colors of clothing, tattoos, 
initiations, hand signals or handshakes, uncommon terms 
or phrases and a sudden change in behavior. Table 19.4 
summarizes some criteria used by some jurisdictions to 
identify gangs. Additional criteria include the use of graf-
ﬁ ti and hand signals.
IDENTIFYING GANG MEMBERS
After a gang problem has been recognized, the 
next step is to identify the gang members.
Gang members may be identiﬁ ed by their names, 
symbols (clothing and tattoos) and communication 
styles, including grafﬁ ti and sign language.
Th e Crips, for example, are associated with blue 
or purple bandannas, scarves or rags. Th e Bloods are 
p.123) state, “Th ere is little question that drug usage and 
violent crime are closely related. What is still in doubt, 
however, is the relationship between drugs (both usage 
and sales) and gangs. Research on this issue has produced 
conﬂ icting ﬁ ndings. . . . Gang members are about twice as 
likely as nongang members to use drugs and to use them 
more often.” Aside from expert opinions that most gangs 
lack the discipline, leadership and crime skills necessary 
to sustain a successful drug operation, those gangs that 
are successful are serious forces to be reckoned with. 
Law enforcement oﬃ  cers must maintain objectivity and 
refrain from stereotyping gang members and drug users and 
pushers, keeping in mind that not all gangs deal with drugs 
and not all who use drugs commit other crimes. Table 19.3 
compares characteristics of street gangs and drug gangs.
Gangs often purposely exploit the diﬀ erence between 
juvenile and adult law in their drug dealing, using younger 
gang members whenever possible to avoid adult sanc-
tions. Most states will not allow youths under age 15 to be 
certiﬁ ed as adults and have statutory restrictions on plac-
ing youths under age 18 into adult correctional facilities.

CHAPTER 19 | Criminal Activities of Gangs and Other Dangerous Groups | 591
RECORDS TO KEEP
Th e most common way to gather information about gangs 
is internal contacts with patrol oﬃ  cers and detectives, fol-
lowed by internal departmental records and computerized 
ﬁ les and then by review of oﬀ ense reports.
Information is an essential tool for law enforcement, 
and an eﬀ ective records system is critical in dealing with 
any gang problem. A gang ﬁ le should be maintained with 
the following information: type of gang (street, motor-
cycle, etc.), ethnic composition, number of active and 
associate members, territory, hideouts, types of crimes 
usually committed, method of operation, choice of tar-
gets or victims, leadership and members known to be vio-
lent. Included within the record system should be a gang 
member pointer ﬁ le that cross-references the names of 
suspected gang members with the gang ﬁ le. Th is may be a 
Cardex or computerized ﬁ le.
A moniker ﬁ le connects suspected gang members’ 
street names with their legal names. A moniker, or nick-
name, is the name gang members use among their peers 
and often during the commission of crimes. Although no 
two members of the same gang will have the same moni-
ker, several gangs may have members with the same mon-
iker. Th erefore, one card should have on it the moniker 
and all gang members who use it.
A photograph ﬁ le is of great help in conducting pho-
tographic identiﬁ cation sessions. A gang vehicle ﬁ le can 
be maintained, arranged alphabetically by vehicle make. 
Include color, year, body type, license number, distin-
guishing features, known drivers and usual parking spots. 
An illegal activities ﬁ le can also be maintained, arranged 
alphabetically, listing the gangs known to engage in the 
activities.
Maintain records on gangs, gang members, monikers, 
photographs, vehicles and illegal activities. Cross-
 reference the records.
A gang information system can provide current crime 
incident data that can be linked to gang members and 
used to enhance police and other agency interventions. 
Table 19.6 shows the methods used for gathering infor-
mation on gangs.
Departments can use improving technology by com-
bining the eﬀ orts of sworn oﬃ  cers and the capabilities of 
the information technology (IT) staﬀ  with its computer-
aided dispatch (CAD) and records management system 
(RMS) to deliver accurate, timely information on gang 
activity directly to patrol oﬃ  cers who need it, thus maxi-
mizing their eﬀ ectiveness when dealing with known gang 
members (Posey (2008, p.39).
identiﬁ ed by red or green colors. Mexican gangs often 
wear brown bandannas as a symbol of ethnic pride. 
Some gangs wear jackets and caps identiﬁ ed with pro-
fessional sports teams, posing a problem for those 
youths who wear them because of actual loyalty to the 
particular team. Gang members may also be identiﬁ ed 
by the hand signals they use. Tattoos (sometimes called 
body art) are another means of identifying gang mem-
bers. Th e most respected tattoos are those earned by 
serving a prison sentence.
Often, the stylized dress and haircuts, tattoos, 
graffiti, slang, hand signs and jewelry used by other 
street gangs are also used by Southeast Asian gangs. 
Another characteristic of Southeast Asian street 
gangs is that they do not claim turf but, rather, are 
very mobile, with informal networks throughout the 
United States.
Police also need to identify the gang leaders and the 
“tough guys.” Reducing the eﬀ ectiveness of the leaders is 
important but is often diﬃ  cult and can be accomplished 
only by having suﬃ  cient evidence to convict the leader of 
a crime that results in a prison sentence. Table 19.5 sum-
marizes warning signs that an individual may be involved 
in a gang.

the community and become familiar with their size, the 
names of as many members as possible and each gang’s 
identifying symbols, colors, and graﬃ  ti.
Some disenchanted gang members may become police 
informants. Children know what is going on among their 
peers even though they may not be gang members them-
selves. Teachers and school counselors are other sources 
of information on acceptable and unacceptable youth 
activities. In addition, recreation department personnel 
know what is going on in the youth community and are 
therefore good sources of information. Valdemar (2007, 
pp.52–53) points out, “Anyone can be an ‘unoﬃ  cial infor-
mant’ and ‘cooperative witness.’ Every person you contact 
is a potential gang informant. Kids, moms, girlfriends, the 
local letter carrier and especially the nosey old lady down 
the street have all witnessed gang crimes in progress. 
Th ey hold the solution to many crimes. Treat them that 
way. But whatever you do, don’t ask them for information 
about gangs in public. Protect their identities, protect 
their lives. And above all, always keep your word.”
Obtaining information from gang members is diﬃ  cult 
because of the gang’s unity. Th e same techniques police use 
to obtain information about organized crime and other seri-
ous criminal activity can produce information about gang 
activity. Obtaining witness information from nongang mem-
bers is diﬃ  cult because they feel threatened by the gang and 
have obvious concerns about their personal safety.
Th e immediate area in which a crime occurs may yield 
much information. Any graﬃ  ti present indicates which

CHAPTER 19 | Criminal Activities of Gangs and Other Dangerous Groups | 593
CHALLENGES IN INVESTIGATING ILLEGAL 
GANG ACTIVITIES
Illegal activities of gangs usually involve multiple suspects, 
which makes investigation much more diﬃ  cult. Evidence 
may link only a few of the suspects with the crime, and, 
as with organized crime ﬁ gures, gang members maintain 
ﬁ erce loyalty to each other.
A further diﬃ  culty is that many “witnesses” may actu-
ally be gang members or people who at least sympathize 
with the gang, so their information is highly suspect. In addi-
tion, others within the neighborhood may have information 
but may be afraid to become involved. Because they live in 
the neighborhood with the gang and may fear for their lives, 
they may provide information and then later deny it. For 
this reason, tape-record or videotape all such interviews.
Special challenges in investigating the illegal 
activities of gangs include the multitude of suspects 
and the unreliability or fear of witnesses.
APPROACHES TO THE GANG 
PROBLEM
Four general strategies are being used to deal with gang 
problems: (1) suppression or law-enforcement efforts, 
(2) social intervention, (3) opportunities provision and 
(4) community organization.
The most eﬀ ective approach is probably a combi-
nation of prevention, intervention and suppres-
sion strategies. More speciﬁ c strategies might include not 
tolerating graﬃ  ti, targeting hard-core gang leaders and con-
solidating major gang-control functions. Table 19.7 shows 
the law enforcement strategies being used, with what fre-
quency and with what perceived eﬀ ectiveness if used.
Although in-state information exchange was the most 
used strategy, it was also among those judged least eﬀ ec-
tive. Street sweeps and other suppression tactics were 
used by less than half the departments, but their eﬀ ec-
tiveness was judged high.
SUPPRESSION
As might be expected, law enforcement agencies view the 
following, in this order, as most eﬀ ective in preventing and 
controlling gang crime: suppression tactics, such as street 
sweeps, intensiﬁ ed surveillance and hot-spot targeting; 
gang controls the territory. Keep in mind that gang mem-
bers do not like to be on foot in a strange area, especially 
one dominated by their enemies; therefore, commando-
type raids on foot are very rare.
If a neighborhood canvass is conducted and informa-
tion is received, it is important that the canvass not stop at 
that point. Th is would implicate the house or business at 
which the canvass was terminated as the source of infor-
mation. In addition, more information might be available 
from a source not yet contacted during the canvass.
Crime scenes that involve gangs are unique. Often 
the crime scene is part of a chain of events. When a gang 
assault occurs, for example, often a chase precedes and 
follows the assault, considerably widening the crime 
scene. If vehicles are involved, the assault is probably by 
a rival gang. If no vehicles appear to have been involved, 
the suspects are probably local, perhaps even members of 
the same gang as the victim. Th is frequently occurs when 
narcotics, girlfriends or family disputes are involved.
Evidence obtained in gang-related criminal investiga-
tions is processed in the same way as evidence related to 
any other crime. Photograph graﬃ  ti for later identiﬁ ca-
tion. File ﬁ eld-interview cards on members, vehicles, ter-
ritory, locations, crimes committed, drug activities and 
any other information. Gang members may usually be 
located within their territory even after they commit a 
crime—because this is their “home.”
A helpful source of information on gangs is the Inter-
net. Th ousands of gang-related sites have been posted. 
In addition, investigators can learn much about gangs in 
their jurisdiction by paying attention to graﬃ  ti.
READING AND RESPONDING TO GRAFFITI
Gangs use graﬃ  ti to send the following types of messages:
• • To mark the gang’s turf (territory).
• • To disrespect a rival gang or gang member.
• • To memorialize a deceased gang member.
• • To make a statement.
• • To send a message.
• • To conduct business.
To document graﬃ  ti evidence, take the following steps:
• • Photograph it whole and in sections.
• • Analyze it while it is intact.
• • Remove it (paint over it, sandblast it, etc.).
• • Archive the photo.
• • Record the colors used.
• • Record the gang “Tag” names.
• • Record indicators of “beef” or violence.
• • Create an anti-graﬃ  ti program to cover over all graﬃ  ti.

stopped. Th e YVSF decided to take this approach, called 
pulling levers, telling gang members, “‘We’re here because 
of the shooting. We’re not going to leave until it stops. And 
until it does, nobody is going to so much as jaywalk, nor 
make any money, nor have any fun.’ Th e plan involved pull-
ing every legal lever the police could, which was not diﬃ  cult 
as many gang members were on probation, selling drugs 
or otherwise chronically oﬀ ending” (Kennedy et al., 2001, 
p.28). Other levers police can use include property (vehicle, 
housing) ownership, vehicle licensure, child support pay-
ments, children’s truancy, asset forfeiture and warrants.
Federal agents are using immigration violations to 
arrest and deport scores of gang members across the 
country (Leinwand, 2007). Gang member arrests have 
increased 73 percent since 2006. 
GANG UNITS
Many departments have established gang units, which use 
a combination of prevention, suppression and interven-
tion. Th e suppression component involves collaboration 
among police, probation, and prosecution, targeting the 
most active gang members and leaders.
Loudoun County, Virginia, formed a gang unit of ﬁ ve 
full-time investigators after an alert from a neighboring 
county that MS-13 was becoming active in the area (Collins, 
2004, pp.11–12). According to the county sheriﬀ , “We got 
very aggressive at going out and identifying gang members, 
ﬁ nding the hotspots where they were hanging out and doing 
business. Th is was important to us because we started gath-
ering statistics and could see where we stood, what was going 
on throughout the county.”
CIVIL GANG INJUNCTIONS AND ORDINANCES
Civil gang injunctions (CGIs) and ordinances are legal tools 
used with urban gangs that focus on individuals and the 
locations of their routine activities. Th ese neighborhood-
level intervention strategies target speciﬁ c individuals 
who intimidate residents and cause other public nuisance 
issues and restricts these gang members’ activities within 
a speciﬁ c geographic area.
However, injunctions and ordinances may be chal-
lenged as unconstitutional violations of the freedom of 
speech, the right of association and due process rights if 
they do not clearly delineate how oﬃ  cers may apply such 
orders. For example, Chicago passed a gang congregation 
ordinance to combat the problems created by the city’s 
street gangs. During the 3 years following passage of the 
ordinance, Chicago police oﬃ  cers issued more than 89,000 
dispersal orders and arrested more than 42,000 people. 
But in Chicago v. Morales (1999), the Supreme Court 
struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional because 
its vague wording failed to provide adequate standards to 
crime prevention activities; and community collaboration: 
“In response to the surge in violent crime, and the public’s 
demand for quick, impressive action, many police depart-
ments have moved away from community policing, relying 
instead on traditional law enforcement strategies to ﬁ ght 
crime. Tactical enforcement teams, ‘stop and frisk’ initiatives, 
neighborhood sweeps, gang injunctions, and public housing 
‘bar out’ (a ‘no-trespass’ policy used by public housing author-
ities to reduce drug activity and other crimes) have been used 
to target and reduce violent crime” (Straub, 2008, p.1).
A Youth Violence Strike Force (YVSF) reviewed what 
had been done in the past and found one program men-
tioned repeatedly: the Wendover Street operation. In that 
operation, police disrupted gang violence by cracking down 
on any type of criminal activity and by telling gang mem-
bers that the crackdown would continue until the violence

CHAPTER 19 | Criminal Activities of Gangs and Other Dangerous Groups | 595
PROSECUTING GANG-RELATED 
CRIMES
Throughout the investigation of illegal gang 
activities, be aware of the most common 
defenses gang members use in court.
The two most often used defense strategies are pleas of 
diminished capacity and self-defense.
Although some states have eliminated “diminished 
capacity” as a defense, many have not. Th erefore, document 
whether the suspect was under the inﬂ uence of alcohol or 
other drugs at the time of the crime. Likewise, document 
whether the suspect was threatened by the victim and could 
possibly have been acting in self-defense. Table 19.8 sum-
marizes diﬃ  culties in prosecuting gang-related crimes. In 
both large and small jurisdictions, obtaining cooperation 
of victims and witnesses and intimidation of victims and 
witnesses present the most problems.
FEDERAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT 
THE GANG PROBLEM
In January 2004, a Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment-FBI collaboration, including federal 
indictments of 15 gang members, was at the “leading edge 
of a quiet sea change inside the FBI.” According to FBI 
Director Robert Mueller, the FBI is obligated to respond 
to the growing “barbarity and the willingness to utilize 
homicide, torture and assaults in furtherance of violent 
gang activities” (Swecker, 2005). 
Th e Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) bureau has established 
a federal program that trains oﬃ  cers to enforce immi-
gration laws and allows them to tap into an immigration 
database. Th ose who are trained can use their new knowl-
edge and skills in any special criminal investigation they 
are conducting, including gang investigations. Th e train-
ing teaches oﬃ  cers how to use federal immigration laws 
to go after criminals in the same way they used tax laws to 
go after organized crime ﬁ gures.
Th e National Youth Gang Center (NYGC) in Tallahas-
see, Florida, is a “one-stop shop for information about 
gangs and eﬀ ective responses to them.” Th e center is 
funded by the OJJDP. Established in 1995, the NYGC 
analyzes state and local gang legislation and local antigang 
guide police discretion. Th e lesson here is that any civil 
injunctions a city passes must be clear in what oﬃ  cers can 
and cannot do when they observe what they believe to be 
gang members congregating in public places.
Another gang ordinance passed in Sunnyside, Wash-
ington, allows police to aggressively pursue individuals who 
engage in peripheral gang activities. Th e ordinance makes 
joining a gang illegal and prohibits hand signals, wearing 
gang-related clothes and other typical gang activities. Th is 
ordinance, however, is being opposed by the Washington 
ACLU, which claims that it could lead to racial proﬁ ling, a 
ﬁ nding many gang experts ﬁ nd “baﬄ  ing” given that race 
is paramount in gang activity (Moore, 2007a, p.98).
Tougher legislation is also being used as a gang con-
trol approach. Because some gangs use their younger 
members to commit serious crimes, relying on the more 
lenient juvenile sentencing laws, some jurisdictions have 
allowed courts to raise the penalties for teenagers con-
victed of gang-related oﬀ enses.
COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS: 
GANG TASK FORCES
Collaboration among law enforcement agencies 
can greatly enhance eﬀ orts to cope with the 
gang problem: “Fighting gang-related crime with tradi-
tional methods is a lot like putting out a forest ﬁ re with a 
measuring cup—something’s being done, but in the long 
run it’s a futile gesture” (Moore, 2007b, p.52). Multiagency 
task forces bring together diﬀ ering perspectives and focus 
human labor eﬀ orts and resources on a common goal, pro-
viding a more eﬀ ective response to the issue of gangs 
(2005 National Gang Th reat Assessment, p.v). Even though 
law enforcement unquestionably plays a major role in 
eﬀ ectively combating the gang problem, partnerships with 
the community, parents and schools signiﬁ cantly increase 
the likelihood of a successful response.
Th e OJJDP’s Comprehensive Gang Model for a gang 
reduction program (GRP) is based on years of experi-
mentation and research on gang prevention. Th e model’s 
key distinguishing feature is a strategic planning process 
that empowers communities to assess their own gang 
problems and fashion a complement of antigang strate-
gies and program activities. Th e report, Best Practices to 
Address Community Gang Problems (no date), presents the 
best practices for the Comprehensive Gang Model and 
highlights results of a National Youth Gang Center Survey 
and a meeting of practitioners regarding their experiences 
in implementing the model. Another valuable resource 
available to all communities is the National Gang Crime 
Research Center Web site (http://www.ngcrc.com).

596 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
(IACP) says, “A hate crime is a criminal oﬀ ense committed 
against persons, property or society that is motivated, in 
whole or in part, by an oﬀ ender’s bias against an individual’s 
or a group’s race, religion, ethnic/national origin, gender, 
age, disability or sexual orientation” (Turner, 1999, p.3). 
Crimes range from verbal intimidation and harassment to 
destruction of property, physical violence and murder.
Hate crime is not a new development in our country. It 
has probably existed in America for more than 300 years; 
however, only recently has it become recognized as a vio-
lation of the law. According to the latest annual count by 
the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the number of 
hate groups operating in America rose to 888 in 2007, up 
5 percent from 844 groups in 2006, capping an increase 
of 48 percent since 2000: “Th e end of 2007 brought to a 
close another year marked by staggering levels of racist 
hate in America” (Holthouse and Potok, 2008). Th e FBI’s 
Uniform Crime Report for 2006 indicates there were 
7,722 hate crime incidents in 2006. Th ey involved 9,076 
oﬀ enses, 9,642 victims and 7,324 oﬀ enders (Crime in the 
United States, 2006).

analyzes data about gangs and identiﬁ es eﬀ ective gang

In addition to youth and street gangs, law enforce-
ment is often confronted with the criminal activities of 
hate groups.
BIAS AND HATE CRIME: 
AN OVERVIEW
Hate is a complex subject that can be divided into 
two general categories: rational and irrational. 
Unjust acts inspire rational hate. Hatred of a person based 
on race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or national 
origin constitutes irrational hate. Generically, a bias crime 
or a hate crime is a criminal act committed because of 
someone’s actual or perceived membership in a particular 
group. Th e International Association of Chiefs of Police

hate crimes (39.6 percent) were crimes against property: 
81.0 percent, destruction/damage/vandalism; 4.0 percent, 
robbery; 7.3 percent, larceny-theft; 4.3 percent, burglary; 
1.1 percent, arson; 0.7 percent, motor vehicle theft; and 
1.6 percent, other (Hate Crime Statistics, 2007).
OFFENDERS
FBI data shows that of the 7,330 known oﬀ enders 
involved in hate crimes during 2006, 58.6 percent were 
White, 20.6 percent were Black, 5.7 percent were groups 
made up of individuals of various races, 1.1 percent were 
Asian/Paciﬁ c Islander, 1.0 percent were American Indian/
Alaskan Native and 12.9 percent were of unknown race 
(Hate Crime Statistics, 2007).
HATE GROUPS
The main hate groups in the United States are 
“skinheads,” Christian Identity groups, the Ku 
Klux Klan (KKK), Black separatists, White supremacists, 
and neo-Nazis. Such hate crime groups terrorize innocent 
civilians and spread fear throughout communities nation-
wide: “From a law enforcement and safety standpoint, 
these are people who are on the most violent edge of the 
extreme right, people whose culture is a violent culture” 
(Phillips, 2007, p.64).
MOTIVATION FOR HATE CRIME
According to the FBI, of the 9,076 single-bias 
hate incidents reported in 2006,
• • 52.2 percent of hate incidents were motivated by a 
bias against a race. 
• • 17.6 percent were motivated by a bias against a 
 religious belief.
• • 15.6 percent were motivated by a bias against a 
 particular sexual orientation.
• • 13.6 percent were motivated by a bias against an 
 ethnicity/national origin.
• • 1.0 percent were motivated by a bias against a 
 disability (Hate Crime Statistics, 2007).
Figure 19.2 illustrates the distribution of hate 
 incidents by bias type.
Bias or hate crimes are motivated by bigotry and hatred 
against a speciﬁ c group of people. Race is usually 
the primary motivation for hate crimes, and African 
Americans are most often the victims.
Th e groups most likely to be victims of hate crime are 
(in alphabetical order) African Americans, Arabs, Asians, 
gay males, Jews, Latinos, lesbians, Native Americans 
and White women in interracial relationships. Given the 
events of September 11, 2001, concern has arisen over 
an increase of hate crimes against young men of Middle 
Eastern descent. In addition, FBI statistics suggest a 35 
percent rise in hate crimes against Latinos between 2003 
and 2006, with experts believing such crimes are typi-
cally carried out by those who think they are attacking 
immigrants.
A group often overlooked in discussions of hate crime 
is the homeless. Homeless people have been run over; hit 
with stun guns, pellet guns, paint guns and pepper balls; set 
on ﬁ re; beaten; robbed; raped; and ﬁ rebombed. Some char-
acteristics typical of hate-motivated violence are relatively 
rare in other crimes of violence, as shown in Table 19.9.
OFFENSES
Of the 9,080 hate crimes reported to the FBI for 2006, 5,449 
(60 percent) were crimes against persons: 31.9 percent 
of these were simple assault; 46.0 percent, intimidation; 
21.6 percent, aggravated assault; 0.2 percent, murder or 
rape; and 0.3 percent, other types of oﬀ enses. A total of 3,593

statements that reﬂ ect bias, including graﬃ  ti or other 
symbols
• • Any diﬀ erences between perpetrator and victim, 
whether actual or perceived by the perpetrator
• • Similar incidents in the same location or 
neighborhood to determine whether a 
pattern exists
• • Whether the victim was engaged in activities promot-

clothing or conduct
• • Whether the incident coincided with a holiday or date 
of particular signiﬁ cance
• • Involvement of organized hate groups or their 
members
• • Absence of any other motive such as economic gain
 Symbols commonly associated with extremist or hate 
groups are shown in Figure 19.3.
Oﬃ  cers must diﬀ erentiate between hate crimes and 
hate incidents: “Hate incidents involve behaviors that, 
though motivated by bias against a victim’s race, reli-
gion, ethnic/national origin, gender, age, disability or 
sexual orientation, are not criminal acts. Hostile or hate-
ful speech or other disrespectful/discriminatory behavior 
may be motivated by bias but is not illegal” (Turner, 1999, 
p.4). Figure 19.4 shows the continuum on which bias-
motivated behavior can fall, going from hate incidents to 
Several watchdog organizations such as the South-
ern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League 
track the size and activities of racist groups and are good 
resources for law enforcement.
THE POLICE RESPONSE
Respond promptly to reports of hate crime, 
attempt to reduce the victims’ fears and deter-
mine the exact type of prejudice involved. Investigators 
should ask the following questions to determine whether 
an incident was hate or bias motivated:
• • Was the victim a member of a targeted class and 
outnumbered?
• • Were the oﬀ enders from a diﬀ erent racial or ethnic 
group than the victim(s)?
• • Did the oﬀ ender use biased language?
Always provide follow-up information to the victims. 
Include in the report the exact words or language used 
reﬂ ecting racial, religious, ethnic or sexual orientation 
bias; the perpetrators’ actions; symbols; colors; dress; or 
any other identifying characteristics or actions.
Th e IACP has outlined key indicators that a hate crime 
may have been committed (Turner, 1999, p.7):
• • Perception of the victim(s) and witnesses about the 
crime

crimes. State statutes will determine where upon this con-
tinuum an act becomes illegal.
REPORTING BIAS AND HATE CRIMES
Th e passage of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 
requires the attorney general to collect data “about 
crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, 
religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.” Th e responsi-
bility for developing the procedures for implementing, 
collecting and managing hate crime data was delegated 
to the director of the FBI, who in turn assigned the 
tasks to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. 
In 2006, the law enforcement agencies that participated 
in the hate crime program represented 85.2 percent of 
the nation’s population and their jurisdictions covered 
49 states, the District of Columbia and outlying areas 
(Guam). Appendix F contains a form for collecting data 
for a bias oﬀ ense report. Such forms can help ensure 
quality ﬁ eld reports properly identifying the crime, the 
elements of the oﬀ ense and the evidence clearly demon-
strating that a hate crime was committed.
Th e FBI has also published manuals concerning the 
types of statistics needed and has established training 
programs in major cities. Nonetheless, it is diﬃ  cult to 
establish hate crime records because some hate crimes 
involve groups rather than individuals. Table 19.10 sum-
marizes the variables that may encourage or discourage 
an agency from reporting hate crimes.
EFFORTS TO COMBAT BIAS 
AND HATE CRIMES
Garrett (2008, p.27) stresses the importance of 
celebrating diversity and not tolerating bigotry 
and suggests that an ideal place to start is within the police 
department itself as well as on college campuses across the 
country: “At the end of the day, actions speak louder than 
words. If you are simply saying all the right things, but it’s 
just lip service, your eﬀ orts will be undermined. Removing 
the tarnish of bigotry doesn’t happen overnight, but 
through hard work agencies can shine the spotlight on tol-
erance and diversity before it spins into hate.”
Regardless of how an agency or individual oﬃ  cer views 
hate crime, it remains a criminal oﬀ ense that requires a law 
enforcement response. Two responses have been taken: 
legislation to expand the scope of the law and increase the 
severity of punishment for hate crimes and more police 
focus on and fully investigating such crimes. Other eﬀ orts 
include community-based programs to increase awareness 
of and oﬀ er solutions to the problem of hate crime.
LEGISLATION
No national consensus exists about whether hate crimes 
should be a separate crime, and those supporting hate 
crime statutes disagree about what should be included. 
Graves scribbled with swastikas 
and other anti-Semitic grafﬁ ti in a

increased awareness of hate crimes is 
the creation of laws that exact higher 
penalties from convicted hate-crime 
offenders. (© Vincent Kessler/Reuters/CORBIS)

his followers moved into Jonestown, a rural commune in 
Guyana, South America, and lived under his absolute rule. 
In 1978, cult leaders killed a U.S. congressman and three 
journalists investigating activities in Jonestown. Jones 
then ordered his followers to commit suicide, resulting in 
the deaths of more than 900 people.
Another well-known group regarded as a cult is the 
International Society for Krishna Consciousness, better 
known as the Hare Krishna movement. Th is cult came 
from India in 1954. Most members wear orange robes, 
and the men shave their heads.
Some scholars refer to cults as “new religious move-
ments,” or NRMs, because most cults are young religious 
movements still in their ﬁ rst generation. As such, these 
authors stress, most NRMs are law abiding. For example, 
the neo-pagan Wicca movement, although it may have 
aspects of a cult, continually disclaims association with 
witchcraft and insists upon its status as a religion.
Moreover, the pervasive eﬀ ect of mass media has 
elevated some superﬁ cial characteristics of cults—such 
as goth/vampire makeup and clothing—to an almost 
 pop-culture status; consequently, the display of such 
 trappings may not be indicative of serious involvement.
A less negative term than cult is new religious 
movement (NRM).
Normally, NRMs have a charismatic leader who devel-
ops an idea that attracts people looking for fulﬁ llment. Th e 
leader is usually self-appointed and claims the right of rule 
because of a supernatural power of appointment. NRM 
membership may include males and females, and there is 
normally no room for democratic participation. Leadership 
is most often exerted through fear and mysticism. Charles 
Manson and Jim Jones are examples of such leaders.
An NRM in Waco, Texas, the “Branch Davidians” 
headed by David Koresh, clashed with federal agents 
attempting a raid in February 1993. Th e raid turned into 
a gun battle in which four federal agents and at least two 
Branch Davidian members were killed. Sixteen agents 
were wounded. Weapons inside the compound included 
at least one tripod-mounted .50-caliber machine gun and 
many semiautomatic weapons. A child released from the 
compound who had lived there for 4 years said she had 
been taught to put a gun into her mouth and told how to 
commit suicide by taking cyanide.
A 51-day standoﬀ  between the federal government 
and Koresh’s armed followers ended in April 1993, when 
ﬁ re engulfed the compound. Th e FBI had sent an armored 
combat vehicle to ram holes into the buildings and pump 
tear gas into them. Th e FBI asserted that Davidians started 
States vary greatly in legislation related to hate crimes. Th e 
most common elements of hate crime legislation include
• • Enhanced penalties.
• • Criminal penalties for vandalism of religious 
institutions.
• • Collection of data.
Legislation must also keep up with the technology used 
to spread messages of hate. Despite such legislation, those 
who propagate messages of bigotry, intolerance and hatred 
claim they have a constitutionally protected right to do so, 
citing free speech, due process and equal protection chal-
lenges. And although state courts have repeatedly upheld 
the constitutionality of legislation that enhances penalties 
for hate-motivated violence, the U.S. Supreme Court struck 
down a Virginia law banning cross burning in 2003, saying 
the statute violated the First Amendment (Virginia v. Black).
Furthermore, research has found minimal public sup-
port for harsher penalties for oﬀ enders who commit hate 
crimes than for oﬀ enders who commit identical crimes 
with no biased motivation.
Sometimes, the hideous nature of hate crimes leaves 
investigators wondering whether the oﬀ ense is truly 
based on bias or whether some type of ritualistic torture 
was involved.
RITUALISTIC CRIME: 
AN OVERVIEW
Ritualistic crimes are most often associated with 
cults or occult groups. 
A cult is a system of religious beliefs and rituals. It also 
refers to those who practice such beliefs.
One informal deﬁ nition of a cult is “any religion other 
than your own.” Th e term is often applied to religious or 
mystical groups that society does not understand. Most 
cults involve some form of worship and followers dedi-
cated to the concepts promoted by the leader.
Cults range in size from a few followers to worldwide 
organizations directed by a complex chain of command. 
According to some estimates, 3,000 cults exist through-
out the world, claiming a total estimated membership of 
more than 3 million people, mostly young adults.
One cult in the late 1970s was the People’s Temple, 
led by Jim Jones, a Protestant clergyman. Hundreds of

THE NATURE OF RITUALISTIC 
CRIMES
Cults and the occult have created great interest 
because of recurring stories from children and 
adults in diﬀ erent areas of the United States concerning 
bizarre satanic rituals and behaviors. Although some may be 
fantasies, there appears to be some truth, especially regard-
ing the danger to children of the members of satanic groups.
A ritualistic crime is an unlawful act committed 
within the context of a ceremony. Investigate the 
crime, not the belief system.
Like gangs, occult groups have three levels of activity: 
dabbling, serious involvement and criminal involvement.
Ritualistic crimes include vandalism, destruction or theft 
of religious artifacts; desecration of cemeteries; the 
maiming, torturing or killing of animals and people; and 
the sexual abuse of children.
Th e “Black Masses” of Satanism often incorporate reli-
gious articles stolen from churches. A Black Mass mocks 
the Christian ritual of communion by substituting blood 
and urine for the wine and feces for the bread. Th e cross 
is usually inverted, and candles and cups may be used in 
sexual acts. “Hymns” either obscene or praising Satan may 
be sung, and heavy-metal music may be played.
Th e Black Mass frequently involves animal mutila-
tion and sacriﬁ ce and sometimes torture and sacriﬁ ce 
of humans, often babies or virgins. Th e sacriﬁ ce often 
incorporates ritualistic incantations. Victims, animal or 
human, are tortured and mutilated because it is believed 
that while the victim struggles, the life forces given oﬀ  can 
be captured and stored for later use. Such sacriﬁ ces may 
be followed by a dance and an orgy.
“Stoner” gangs consist of middle-class youths involved 
in drugs, alcohol and often Satanism. Although stoners are 
not as apt to engage in the violent crimes associated with 
other street gangs, they may mutilate animals, rob graves 
and desecrate churches and human remains. Th eir graf-
ﬁ ti frequently depicts satanic symbolism such as inverted 
crosses and the number 666.
the blaze, an apparent mass suicide that killed at least 80, 
including women and children.
Survivors of the ﬁ re, however, insisted that it was 
caused by the tank’s hitting a barrel of propane and tip-
ping over lit camping lanterns. Th e FBI has been cleared 
of wrongdoing in this incident.
TERMINOLOGY AND SYMBOLS 
OF CULTS
Over the years, a number of terms have been 
associated with cults. Among the terms law 
enforcement oﬃ  cers should be familiar with are
• • Antichrist—the son of Satan
• • Beelzebub—a powerful demon, right under Satan
• • Coven—a group of witches or Satanists
• • Hand of Glory—the left hand of a person who has 
died
• • Incantation—verbal spell
• • Magick—the “glue” that binds occult groups, a 
supernatural act or force that causes a change in the 
environment
• • Occult—secret knowledge of supernormal powers
• • Ritual—prescribed form of religious or mystical 
ceremony
• • Sabbat—a gathering of witches
SYMBOLS
Among the satanic and occult symbols are the circle, which 
symbolizes totality and wholeness and within which cer-
emonies are often performed; the inverted cross, which 
mocks the Christian cross; the goat’s head, symbolizing the 
devil; the heart, symbolizing the center of life; the hexa-
gram (six-pointed star), purported to protect and control 
demons; the pentagram (ﬁ ve-pointed star), representing 
the four elements of the earth surmounted by “the Spirit”; 
and the horned hand, a hand signal of recognition used 
between those members. Th is is similar to the hand sig-
nals used by street gangs. Figure 19.5 illustrates symbols 
commonly associated with satanic and occult groups.
Colors also have signiﬁ cance to many cults:
• • Black—darkness, night, sorrow, evil, the devil
• • Blue—water, tears, sadness
• • Green—vegetation, nature, restfulness
• • Red—blood, physical life, energy, sexuality

most common), and are of a variety of races, nationalities 
and religions. Interestingly, few Jews are involved in 
Satanism, because Judaism does not emphasize the devil. 
A number of factors may lead an individual to occult 
involvement, including family alienation, insecurity and a 
quest for personal power, unfulﬁ lled ambitions, a spiritual 
search for answers, idealism, nonconformity, adolescent 
rebellion, a desire for adventure and excitement, a need 
for attention and recognition and a need to escape reality 
or the circumstances of his or her own birth.
Although the personal appearance of those involved in 
occult activity is often quite normal, some adopt a less main-
stream look. For example, they may dress entirely in black

Apsychological proﬁ le of males and females

be creative, imaginative, curious, daring and thus intelli-
gent and well educated, yet are frequently underachievers. 
Although they are egocentric, they also have low self- 
esteem and have suﬀ ered peer rejection or persecution.

CHAPTER 19 | Criminal Activities of Gangs and Other Dangerous Groups | 605
INVESTIGATING RITUALISTIC 
CRIMES
Occult reports and activities are investigated in 
much the same way as any other crime. Inter-
view the people who report these incidents, and prepare 
reports concerning witnesses or alleged victims of crimi-
nal activity. Take photos, sketch symbols, describe colors 
found and measure objects. Preserve all objects at the 
scene as evidence. Work from the outside perimeter to the 
center or the focus point of the site.
Numerous books on the beliefs and rituals of various 
cults are available. Th e background contained in such books 
is beyond the scope of this book, but investigators should 
be alert to signs that criminal activity may be cult related.
One challenge in investigating ritualistic crime is 
determining that an act is, in fact, motivated by a religious 
belief system, rather than by hate or bias. Some crimes, 
such as arson or vandalism, may not initially present 
clearly as one type of crime or the other, particularly when 
the victim or target has some religious component, such 
as a church or cemetery. Understanding the motivations 
behind these crimes will help investigators distinguish 
whether an act is rooted in hate or ritualism. Most of the 
signs, symbols and other indicators of ritualistic crime dis-
cussed next are rarely found at the scene of a hate crime, 
whereas derogatory or hate-ﬁ lled verbalizations, graﬃ  ti 
or other written evidence are often present in bias crimes. 
Victim statements, if available, can provide valuable 
information regarding possible oﬀ ender motivations. For 
example, did the oﬀ ender(s) use racially charged language 
or other words indicating a hatred for the victim or oth-
ers in the victim’s perceived group (homosexuals, immi-
grants, religious groups, etc.), or did the oﬀ ender’s words 
and actions convey more of a ceremonial tone, mentioning 
sacriﬁ ces or other ritualistic purposes, including prayers or 
incantations. Did the oﬀ enders wear ceremonial-looking 
clothing or use any type of ceremonial or symbolic item, 
or were they brandishing baseball bats and other nonsym-
bolic weapons? Th ese elements help investigators distin-
guish between hate crimes and ritualistic crimes.
SIGNS OF CULT-RELATED ACTIVITY
Th e following items may be important indicators of satanic 
or cult activity. If you suspect ritualistic crime, list these 
items in any search warrant sought:
• • Altars (stone or metal) or a wooden stand for an altar
• • Animal parts (anus, heart, tongue, ears, front teeth, 
front legs, genitals), cages
or other dark clothing; pierce various parts of their bodies; 
grow their hair long and dye it; wear chains as implements of 
conﬁ nement; wear heavy eye shadow and white makeup to 
appear more ashen or deathlike; wear heavy boots; display 
tattoos depicting serpents, skulls or other occult symbols; 
and have scars indicating cuttings, burnings or whippings.
Perlmutter (2003/2004) categorizes perpetrators 
of ritualistic crime as dabblers, true believers and “true 
criminals” and asserts that knowledge of how these vari-
ous groups approach their crimes can help investigators 
focus their eﬀ orts in locating suspects and solving cases. 
Dabblers are intermittently involved in the occult and 
have a strong, curious interest in supernatural belief sys-
tems: “Such perpetrators most often act alone or in small, 
loosely organized groups. Dabblers usually make up their 
own belief system based upon some occult ideology and 
perpetrate criminal activity that conforms to that ideol-
ogy” (Perlmutter). Th e crime scene of a dabbler is gener-
ally disorderly and considered by experts to be “sloppy.”
True believers are committed to their religion and 
commit ritualistic crimes because the acts are required by 
their belief system. According to Perlmutter, true believ-
ers “do not consider their actions criminal although they 
do understand them to be illegal. For [these perpetrators], 
the violent act is a necessary religious ritual.” Conversely, 
true criminals use the occult as an excuse to justify or 
rationalize their crimes: “Th ey are committed not to the 
belief system but to the criminal action” (Perlmutter, 
2003/2004). A well-known example of a true criminal was 
Richard Ramirez, also known as the Night Stalker: 
Self-styled Satanists such as Ramirez are not viewed 
as true believers since their primary interest is usu-
ally the acquisition of personal power, material gain, 
or gratiﬁ cation through criminal activity rather than 
spiritual Satanic worship. Th is does not mean that Rich-
ard Ramirez was not conducting ritualistic crimes; his 
crimes involved obvious ritual activities and contained 
Satanic symbolism, and he clearly identiﬁ es himself 
as a Satanist. Although dabblers, true criminals, and 
true believers can all be identiﬁ ed as Satanists, the dif-
ferences in motivation signiﬁ cantly aﬀ ect the types of 
rituals they conduct—hence the investigation and the 
evidence sought at the crime scene. For example, true 
criminals are not as concerned about the accurate sym-
bolism, place, date, or victim of the rituals and are not 
connected to any organized group or speciﬁ c Satanic 
tradition; consequently the symbolic evidence will be 
unique to that person. Dabblers most often are true 
believers who are emulating a particular tradition or the-
ology but are not yet experienced enough to accurately 
conduct the ritual. Occasionally dabblers are true crimi-
nals who use the occult as a method to gain followers; in 
either case, the crime scene reﬂ ects a lack of knowledge 
or skill in sacred rites. (Perlmutter, 2003/2004)

606 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
If evidence is found to support the commission of a 
crime, submit the case to the prosecuting attorney’s oﬃ  ce, 
as with other crimes. Also as with other crimes, if illegal 
acts are being committed in the presence of an oﬃ  cer who 
arrives at the scene, an immediate arrest may be executed. 
However, many authorities on cult activity warn that no 
one, including a police oﬃ  cer, should ever approach or try 
to stop an occult ritual alone because the oﬃ  cer would

• • Inverted crosses, vandalized Christian artifacts
• • Jewelry such as amulets or medallions with satanic 
symbols
• • Nondiscernible alphabet, satanic symbols painted on

• • Pillows
• • Rooms draped in black or red (or nail holes in walls and 
ceiling indicating that such drapes may have been used)
INDICATORS OF RITUALISTIC CRIMES
Indicators that criminal activity may be cult related 
include symbols, candles, makeshift altars, bones, cult-
related books, swords, daggers and chalices.
Scott Dyleski, 16 at the time of this photo, appears behind a 
protective glass barrier in Judge David Flinn’s courtroom in 
Martinez, California, Thursday, October 27, 2005. Dyleski was 
convicted of ﬁ rst-degree murder as an adult in the death of Pamela 
Vitale, the wife of prominent defense attorney and television 
commentator Daniel Horowitz. The 16-year-old suspect was 
reported to have been involved in some kind of self-styled Satanism 
including the reading of Anton LeVay’s Satanic Bible and use 
of occult symbols at the crime scene. Pamela Vitale was killed 
October 15, 2005, having been hit 39 times with a piece of crown 
molding and stabbed in the abdomen. A Lorraine Cross (a cross 
with two horizontal lines, the lower one larger than the upper one, 
which is associated with Satanism and suggests ﬁ re and brimstone) 
was carved into her back.
Dyleski was a juvenile at the time of the murder and, as such, 
was not eligible for the death penalty. Shortly after his 18th birthday 
on October 30, 2006, he was transferred from the juvenile facility he 
was being held to a state prison, where he will serve his sentence 
of life without parole. (© AP/Wide World Photos)

CHAPTER 19 | Criminal Activities of Gangs and Other Dangerous Groups | 607
Occult murders are usually stabbings or cuttings—
seldom are they gunshot wounds—and many victims are 
cult members or former members. Th e murderer is typi-
cally a White male from a middle- to upper-class family 
with above-average intelligence and using some form of 
drug. Perlmutter asserts, “It takes a high level of experi-
ence to remove blood from a person or animal without 
soiling the scene; a juvenile dabbler will not be able to 
remove blood in the same manner as an experienced high 
priest, who could have the skills of a surgeon. . . . Th e role 
of the sacriﬁ cer is an honored and privileged position and 
will most likely be given to the leader of the group.”
Guard against reacting emotionally when confronted 
with ritualistic crime, for they tend to be emotionally and 
spiritually repulsive. Also bear in mind that unusual crimes 
are also committed by individuals with mental problems 
who are not connected with cults.
During postmortem examination, the stomach con-
tents can be of great importance in determining what 
occurred just before death. In many ritualistic homicides, 
the body is not available because it has been burned, leav-
ing no evidence. Further, most juries disbelieve seemingly 
outlandish charges of Satanism and human sacriﬁ ce, and 
most judges do not regard Satanism as a real problem. 
Hence, most cases are dismissed.
INVESTIGATING SATANIC SERIAL KILLINGS
Serial killings may be linked to satanic-like rituals in the 
murder act itself as well as in the killer’s behavior follow-
ing the murder. Serial killings frequently linked to Satan-
ism include the following:
• • Charles Manson had links with the Process, a satanic 
group. Many of the murders committed by Manson 
and his followers had ritualistic overtones.
• • Th e “Son of Sam” murders involving David Berkowitz 
are claimed by author Maury Terry in Th e Ultimate Evil 
to have been a conspiracy among satanic cult mem-
bers of the Process group.
• • Some brutal, vicious serial killers ﬁ nd Satanism a justi-
ﬁ cation for their bizarre antisocial behavior.
• • “Night Stalker” Richard Ramirez had a pentagram 
on the palm of his hand, wrote satanic graﬃ  ti on the 
walls of some of his victims’ homes and was obsessed 
with AC/DC’s Highway to Hell album featuring the 
song “Night Stalker.” Ramirez shouted “Hail, Satan” as 
he left the courtroom.
INVESTIGATING YOUTH SUICIDES
Increasingly, law enforcement has been faced with satanic 
“overtones” to suicides committed by young people. Lyle 
likely be dealing with mentally deranged people high on 
drugs.
INVESTIGATING ANIMAL DEATHS
Unusual circumstances surrounding animal deaths may 
be important indicators of satanic or cult activity. Th e 
following circumstances connected with dead animals 
should be noted:
• • No blood (the blood has been drained from the animal)
• • An inverted cross carved on the animal’s chest
• • Surgically removed head
• • Intestines or other body organs removed
If a rash of missing-animal reports occurs, gather 
information on the kind of animals they are, when they 
disappeared and from what area. Look for patterns, and 
coordinate eﬀ orts with the local humane society, Ameri-
can Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 
(ASPCA) and veterinarians.
INVESTIGATING HOMICIDES
According to Perlmutter (2003/2004), “Ritual homicides 
committed by true believers reﬂ ect a serious knowledge 
of the particular theology, a high level of skill, and meticu-
lous attention to detail. . . . Th e perpetrator considers the 
murder to be a sacred act and the crime scene will reﬂ ect 
this.” At the scene of a homicide investigation, the follow-
ing may suggest a ritualistic death:
• • Missing body parts—heart, genitals, left hand, 
tongue, index ﬁ nger
• • Scarring between index ﬁ nger and thumb or inside the 
wrist from past rituals involving members’ blood
• • Blood drained from body
• • Ritualistic symbols such as a pentagram associated 
with satanic worshipers carved on the body or sur-
rounding area
• • Tattoos on armpits or the bottom of feet
• • Wax drippings, oils, incense or powders of ritual on 
the body
• • Urine or human or animal feces smeared on body or 
found in body cavities
• • Semen inside, on or near body cavities or smeared on 
the body
• • Victim undressed
• • Body painted or tied up
• • Neck wounds, branding-iron marks or burn marks on 
body
• • Colored strings near the body

SPECIAL CHALLENGES 
IN RITUALISTIC CRIME 
INVESTIGATIONS
Just as law enforcement oﬃ  cers may have diﬃ  -
culty relating to gang members and not react-
ing with scorn toward them because of their gang 
associations, they will almost certainly have diﬃ  culty 
relating to those who engage in ritualistic activity. Th is is 
also true of the general public and the media, which fre-
quently sensationalize cases involving ritualistic or cult-
related crimes, particularly sexual abuse of children and 
homicides.
Special challenges involved in investigating ritualistic 
or cult-related crimes include separating the belief 
system from the illegal acts, the sensationalism that 
frequently accompanies such crimes and the “abnormal” 
personalities of some victims and suspects.
Frequently, the victims of cult-related crimes are for-
mer cult participants. Many have been or are currently 
undergoing psychological counseling, which makes their 
testimony less than credible to some people. Likewise, 
many suspects, the leaders in particular, are beyond the 
pale of what most people would consider to be normal and 
consequently may be treated diﬀ erently because of how 
they look and what they believe rather than because of 
their actions.
Rapacki of Flagstaﬀ , Arizona, has compiled a list of indica-
tors that a youth is involved in cult or occult activities:
• • Withdrawal from family and friends
• • Changing of friends and associates
• • Sudden hostility toward the Christian church and the 
Bible
• • New friends who are loners, academic nonachievers 
and problem cases for school oﬃ  cials
• • Change of dress to darker, more subdued colors; more 
jewelry
• • Increased rebellion, depression or aggressive behavior
• • Negative change in moral behavior; also a change in 
priorities to a more narrowly self-centered pattern
• • Drop in grades, lack of interest in school or lack of 
concentration
• • Interest in occult literature; may start his/her own 
Book of Shadows—a notebook containing personal 
symbols and rituals, often written in code
• • Magazines focusing on death, violence, secrecy and 
sexual acting out
• • Increasing involvement in fantasy role-playing games 
such as Dungeons and Dragons
• • Increased viewing of occult movies and television

CHECKLIST
Belonging to a gang is not illegal in this country; however, 
the activities of gang members frequently are illegal. Th e 
number of gangs and gang members has decreased over 
the last few years, but gang-related crime is still of con-
cern to law enforcement. Cultural gangs are neighborhood 
centered and exist independently of criminal activity. 
Instrumental gangs are formed for the express purpose of 
criminal activity, primarily drug traﬃ  cking.
 
In addition to drug dealing, gang members often 
engage in vandalism, arson, auto theft, shoplifting, shoot-
ings, stabbings, intimidation and other forms of violence. 
Th e ﬁ rst step in dealing with a gang problem is to recog-
nize it. Gang members may be identiﬁ ed by their names, 
symbols (clothing and tattoos) and communication styles, 
including graﬃ  ti and sign language. Maintain records on 
gangs, gang members, monikers, photographs, vehicles 
and illegal activities. Cross-reference the records.
 
Special challenges in investigating the illegal activi-
ties of gangs include the multitude of suspects and the 
unreliability or fear of witnesses. Four general strategies 
are being used to deal with gang problems: (1) suppres-
sion or law enforcement eﬀ orts, (2) social intervention, 
(3) opportunities provision and (4) community orga-
nization. Th e two most often used defense strategies in 
gang-related crime prosecutions are pleas of diminished 
capacity and of self-defense. 
 
Other challenges are investigating bias or hate crimes 
and ritualistic crimes. Bias or hate crimes are acts moti-
vated by bigotry and hatred against a speciﬁ c group of 
people. Race is the most frequent motivation for bias and 
hate crime, and African Americans are the most frequent 
victims.
 
Ritualistic crimes are often associated with the occult. 
A cult is a system of religious beliefs and rituals and those 
who practice them. A less negative way to refer to cults is 
as new religious movements (NRMs). A ritualistic crime is an 
unlawful act committed within the context of a  ceremony. 
Investigate the crime—not the belief system.
 
Ritualistic crimes have included vandalism; destruc-
tion and theft of religious artifacts; desecration of cem-
eteries; the maiming, torturing and killing of animals and 
people; and the sexual abuse of children. Indicators that 
criminal activity may be cult related include symbols, can-
dles, makeshift altars, bones, cult-related books, swords, 
daggers and chalices. Special challenges in investigating 
ritualistic or cult-related crimes include separating the 
belief system from the illegal acts, the sensationalism 
that frequently accompanies such crimes and the “abnor-
mal” personalities sometimes found in both victims and 
suspects.

MEDIA EXPLORATIONS
A. Graﬃ  ti has suddenly appeared in increasing amounts 
in speciﬁ c areas on walls, public buildings, telephone poles 
and streetlights in your community. Some are in blue paint 
and some are in red. Groups in the local park have been 
seen wearing blue bandannas, whereas in another park 
they are wearing red kerchiefs. Some of them have been 
seen ﬂ ashing particular hand signals to each other. Some 
of the graﬃ  ti symbols represent animals and insects. A 
blue word Crips has the letter C crossed out with a red X.
Question

what information should the preceding description give 
to a police oﬃ  cer?
B. While looking for a stolen safe in a wooded area, the police 
discover a circular clearing about 200 feet in diameter with 
candles placed around the circumference. A rough altar has 
been constructed with a cross. A ﬁ re has been burned beneath 
the cross. A ﬁ ve-pointed star is scratched in the dirt, and the

he terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, sounded a wake-up call to 
Americans. Th e 9/11 attacks were a shock, but they should not have been 
a surprise. Islamist extremists had given ample warning that they meant to kill 
Americans. Th e critical failure was not believing the gravity of the threat. According 
to Griﬃ  th (2006a, p.10), 
We’ve been oﬃ  cially under attack by Muslim terrorists for ﬁ ve years. Actually, they’ve 
been trying to kill us for a lot longer; it’s just we decided to take notice when they hit us 
really hard ﬁ ve years ago.
T

We took notice. And then we went back to doing 
what we do. Squabbling with each other over politics, 
spending more money than we have, enjoying the good 
life, and denying that we’re in danger.
 
Th e majority of Americans don’t take this war 
seriously. Part of the problem is that we can’t say who 
we’re ﬁ ghting. In World War II we fought the Germans, 
Japanese, Italians and a number of lesser players 
aligned with the Axis powers. In Korea, we fought the 
North Koreans and the Chinese. Even in Vietnam we 
could say who we were ﬁ ghting.
 
But now we’re ﬁ ghting the Global War on 
Terrorism. 
 
To this day, many Americans fail to understand the 
true message of the 9/11 tragedy: “We were not attacked 
by a small band of zealots with box cutters but by an ide-
ology that still thrives in the world and must be defeated 
before there can be peace” (Griﬃ  th, 2006b, p.12).
 
Th e horriﬁ c events of 9/11 pulled together and uni-
ﬁ ed the American people. Patriotism was immediately 
popular. Th ousands of volunteers helped search for vic-
tims and donated blood and money. Th e American ﬂ ag 
ﬂ ew everywhere. In his speech before Congress, the coun-
try and the world on September 20, 2001, President Bush 
stated, “Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and 
called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger, 
and anger to resolution.” 
 
In addition to galvanizing the nation, the events of 
that tragic day had other ramiﬁ cations, such as changing 
how our nation views its security, with law enforcement 
working to redeﬁ ne its role as traditional crime ﬁ ghters 
while taking on tremendous new counterterrorism activi-
ties. But the threat remains. Th e Justice Department’s top 
priority is to support law enforcement and intelligence 
agencies in the ﬁ ght against terrorism. Stockton (2008, 
p.8) notes,
After Sept. 11, our country entered a new era of polic-
ing. Departments around the country looked at their 
mission diﬀ erently. Th ink back on some of the major 
changes:
• Federal agencies were reorganized.
•  Entirely new agencies were established, including 
the Transportation Security Administration and the 
Department of Homeland Security.
•  A color-coded security system was established to indi-
cate the terrorism threat level.
•  Billions of dollars have been spent in an eﬀ ort to bet-
ter equip and prepare agencies to respond to both 
natural and man-made disasters.
•  Interoperability in communications and data sharing 
has not only become a priority but is also the norm in 
some parts of the country.
 
A study of what eﬀ ect, if any, the 9/11 terrorist 
attacks had on the mission statements of the 50 largest 
police departments in the United States found that, by 
2004, none of the departments had altered their mission 
statements to make any reference to terrorism (DeLone, 
2007, p.218). Surprisingly, by the conclusion of the 
study in 2006, only the Washington, DC, Metro Police 
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, rocked the entire nation. First responders to the World Trade Center crime scene, including law 
enforcement ofﬁ cers and ﬁ reﬁ ghters, were invaluable in saving countless lives but were also among the many casualties of the horriﬁ c event. 
A positive consequence of this tragedy was the galvanization of American patriotism and a resolve of citizens to join law enforcement in the 
daily efforts to protect our freedoms and valued way of life.

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 615
Department had a terrorism reference in its mission 
statement (p.226). Although the emphasis on terrorism 
may not be articulated in writing in most departments’ 
mission statements, the events of 9/11 dramatically 
changed the law enforcement paradigm across the nation: 
“Federal resources were moved from traditional crime 
ﬁ ghting to terrorism, while many state and local police 
agencies expanded their roles from ﬁ ghting crime to 
include the prevention of—and response to—terrorism” 
(Bratton, 2006b, p.2). Despite the necessity to ramp up 
our strategy to address the threat of terrorism, we cannot 
aﬀ ord to neglect the attention and resources devoted to 
traditional crimes: “Th e federal government must recog-
nize that while we are committed to balancing homeland 
security demands with our responsibility to prevent and 
respond to traditional crime, fear and disorder, we still 
need some of the federal resources and assistance that 
helped reduce crime dramatically in the 1990s. Simply 
put, in the 1990s we got it right. We need to re-visit the 
partnerships we forged and the meaningful changes we 
accomplished through that concerted eﬀ ort to drive down 
crime” (Bratton).
 
Many have voiced concern over the increased attention 
and funding given to terrorism: “Th e Department of Home-
land Security announced $1.9 billion in anti-terrorism 
grants yesterday, stirring a growing debate among state 
and local oﬃ  cials nationwide over whether such funds are 
coming at the expense of other law enforcement priori-
ties that some say are more urgent, such as ﬁ ghting drugs, 
gangs, and violent crime” (Hsu, 2008, p.A02). Th e increase 
in violent crime in recent years has led some to dub home-
land security “the monster that ate criminal justice” and 
resulted in louder warnings that local police departments 
cannot be eﬀ ective homeland security partners if they are 
overwhelmed by the responsibilities of their core mission 
(Garrett, 2007, p.10). Th e need for balancing crime ﬁ ght-
ing eﬀ orts with counterterrorism eﬀ orts should be kept in 
mind while reading this chapter, for as Kelling, Eddy and 
Bratton (2007) point out, “For cops crime ﬁ ghting and 
counterterrorism go hand in hand.” 
TERRORISM: AN OVERVIEW
The United States has not been immune from 
terrorist attacks from within and without. 
Consider, for example, the raids of the Ku Klux Klan, the 
mail bombings of the Unabomber, the 1993 attack on the 
World Trade Center and the 1995 bombing of the Alfred 
P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. Most terrorist acts 
result from dissatisfaction with a religious, political or 
social system or policy and an inability to change it 
through acceptable, nonviolent means.
Th e United States paid lip service to ﬁ ghting terror-
ism in 1995 when the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) established a Counterterrorism Center. In 1996, the 
Antiterrorism and Eﬀ ective Death Penalty Act was passed, 
enhancing the federal government’s powers to deny visas 
to individuals belonging to terrorist groups and simplify-
ing the process for deporting aliens convicted of crimes. 
On February 23, 1998, Osama bin Laden called for jihad, 
a holy war, on the United States, calling on every Muslim 
to comply with God’s order to kill Americans and plunder 
their money wherever and whenever they ﬁ nd it.
In 1999, FBI Director Louis Freeh announced, “Our 
number-one priority is the prevention of terrorism.” 
But it took the horrendous attacks of September 11, 
2001, to truly get our attention. Th ose attacks were 
criminal and are still being investigated. It is up to law 
enforcement throughout the country to investigate 
possible terrorist activities. To do so, it is important 
to “know the enemy” and to understand terrorism and 
those who engage in it.
TERRORISM DEFINED
Terrorism is extremely diﬃ  cult to deﬁ ne because, as the 
Terrorism Research Center notes, “One man’s terrorist is 
another’s freedom ﬁ ghter.” Th e center deﬁ nes terrorism 
as “the use of force or violence against persons or prop-
erty in violation of the criminal laws of the United States 
for purposes of intimidation, coercion or ransom.” Th is is 
similar to the FBI’s deﬁ nition: “Terrorism is the unlaw-
ful use of force or violence against persons or property to 
intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian popula-
tion, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political 
or social objectives” (28 Code of Federal Regulations Sec-
tion 0.85). Th e U.S. Code Title 22 deﬁ nes terrorism as the 
“premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated 
against noncombatant targets by subnational groups 
or clandestine agents, usually intended to inﬂ uence an 
audience.”
Most deﬁ nitions of terrorism have commonalities, 
including the systematic use of physical violence, either 
actual or threatened, against noncombatants to create 
a climate of fear to cause some religious, political or 
social change.

616 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM
According to the FBI,
International terrorism involves violent acts or acts 
dangerous to human life that are a violation of the 
criminal laws of the United States or any state, or that 
would be a criminal violation if committed within the 
jurisdiction of the United States or any state. Th ese acts 
appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian 
population, inﬂ uence the policy of a government by 
intimidation or coercion, or aﬀ ect the conduct of a gov-
ernment by assassination or kidnapping. International 
terrorist acts occur outside the United States or tran-
scend national boundaries in terms of the means by 
which they are accomplished, the persons they appear 
intended to coerce or intimidate, or the locale in which 
the perpetrators operate or seek asylum.
International terrorism is foreign based or directed 
by countries or groups outside the United States against 
the United States. Th e FBI divides international ter-
rorism into three categories: (1) foreign state sponsors 
using terrorism as a tool of foreign policy, such as Iraq, 
Libya and Afghanistan; (2) formalized terrorist groups 
such as the Lebanese Hezbollah, the Egyptian al-Gamm’a 
al-Islamiyya, the Palestinian Harakat al-Muqawamah al-
Islamiyyah (HAMAS) and Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda; and 
(3) loosely aﬃ  liated international radical extremists who 
have a variety of identities and travel freely in the United 
States, unknown to law enforcement or the government.
Th ese international terrorist groups are likely to 
engage in what is often referred to as asymmetric war-
fare, combat in which a weaker group attacks a supe-
rior group not head-on but by targeting areas where the 
adversary least expects to be hit, causing great psychologi-
cal shock, along with loss of life among random victims. 
Asymmetric warfare aims to empower the powerless and 
nullify the stronger adversary’s ability to use its conven-
tional weapons. A prime example was the use by the 9/11 
al-Qaeda terrorists of ordinary box cutters to overpower 
ﬂ ight personnel and convert airplanes into weapons of 
mass destruction, costing billions of dollars of losses to 
the U.S. economy and tremendous loss of life (at a total 
estimated cost to the terrorists of $500,000).
Th e FBI’s National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) 
states that of the 64 signiﬁ cant terrorist attacks in 2004 
involving a U.S. citizen or facility, 53 (83 percent) were 
committed in the Near East. Only 3 (5 percent) were com-
mitted in the Western Hemisphere (Figure 20.1). Of the 
651 total terrorist attacks in 2004, 90 percent had no U.S. 
target. In addition, U.S. citizens constituted only 1 per-
cent of all victims of international terrorism in 2004. Th e 
July 7, 2005, bombings in London were evidence of the 
MOTIVATIONS FOR TERRORISM
Most terrorist acts result from dissatisfaction with 
a religious, political or social system or policy and 
frustration resulting from an inability to change it through 
acceptable, nonviolent means.
Religious motives are seen in Islamic extremism. 
Political motives are seen in such elements as the Red 
Army Faction. Social motives are seen in single-issue 
groups such as those against abortion or active in animal-
rights or environmentalist movements. 
Before looking at speciﬁ c terrorist groups, consider 
how they might be classiﬁ ed.
CLASSIFICATION OF 
TERRORIST ACTS
The FBI categorizes terrorism in the United States as 
either domestic or international.
DOMESTIC TERRORISM
Th e FBI deﬁ nes domestic terrorism as “the unlawful 
use, or threatened use, of force or violence by a group 
or individual based and operating entirely within the 
United States or its territories without foreign direc-
tion committed against persons or property to intimi-
date or coerce a government, the civilian population or 
any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social 
objectives.”
Th e bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Build-
ing and the pipe bomb explosions in Centennial Olym-
pic Park during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in 
Atlanta highlight the threat of domestic terrorists. 
Th ese terrorists represent extreme right- or left-wing 
and special-interest beliefs. Many are antigovernment, 
antitaxation and antiabortion, and some engage in sur-
vivalist training to perpetuate a White, Christian nation. 
Domestic terrorist groups are discussed later in the 
chapter.
In October 2002, the Washington, DC, area was 
terrorized by a sniping spree. Th e sniper mastermind, 
John Allen Muhammad, was sentenced to death for the 
shootings that left 10 people dead. His teenage accom-
plice, Lee Boyd Malvo, was sentenced to life without 
parole.

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 617
support and an ample supply of recruits, primarily disaf-
fected, younger, more radical Muslims. Hezbollah’s tactics 
include kidnappings and car bombings directed predomi-
nantly against Westerners. Hezbollah also oﬀ ers a com-
prehensive social services network for its supporters.
Hezbollah participated in the al-Aqsa intifada and 
its international branch “is believed to be the most eﬀ ec-
tive terrorist network in the world” (White, 2006, p.168). 
Although Hezbollah is part of the jihadist network, its ori-
gins are found in the struggle over Palestine and it has 
“reluctantly formed alliances with non-jihadist groups” 
(White, p.140).
HAMAS HAMAS is a militant Palestinian Islamic 
movement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip dedicated 
to destroying Israel and creating an Islamic state in 
Palestine. Founded in 1987, HAMAS opposed the 1993 
Peace Accords between Israel and the PLO. In 1998, 
HAMAS claimed that Palestine was an Islamic homeland 
that could never be surrendered to non-Muslims and 
that waging holy war to wrest control of Palestine from 
Israel was a religious duty for Palestinian Muslims. Th is 
was in direct conﬂ ict with the agenda of the PLO. HAMAS 
is a large organization, but its terrorist wing is relatively 
small (White, 2006, p.169). Frequently allied with Islamic 
Jihad, HAMAS competes with other organizations of the 
Palestinian Liberation Movement, or al-Fatah.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad Palestinian Islamic Jihad 
(PIJ) emerged from Egypt, its founders inﬂ uenced by mil-
itant factions and disillusioned with Egypt’s traditional 
Muslim Brotherhood (White, 2006, p.160). While the 
Brotherhood spoke of education and peaceful change, the 
PIJ founders wanted to create an Islamic state through 
military action. In the late 1970s, they moved into the Gaza 
Strip and eventually went to southern Lebanon. When 
they returned to the occupied territories, they believed 
they could become the vanguard of a local Islamic revolu-
tion and began to create a new terrorist organization. Th e 
group has strong links in the United States, allegedly in 
Florida, and is one of the groups that have mastered sui-
cide bombing (White, p.169).
Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades Th is terrorist group formed 
in refugee camps in the West Bank (White, 2006, p.168). 
Th at some members are motivated by Hezbollah suggests 
that they have Shi’ite elements. Others believe the bri-
gades represent al-Fatah’s attempt to take the intifada’s 
leadership away from HAMAS and the PIJ. Th e brigades 
are organized militarily and became one of the ﬁ rst secu-
lar groups in the Middle East to use suicide bombers. Th eir 
terrorist operations are divided into six geographical areas, 
spread of terrorism to Western societies, particularly the 
staunch allies of the U.S.–led invasion of Iraq and over-
throw of Saddam Hussein’s regime. 
Confusion often exists when the term Islamic jihad is 
used because, according to White (2006, p.353), several 
Middle Eastern groups go by that name. Th ese terrorist 
groups are all parts of the Palestine Liberation Organi-
zation’s (PLO) military branch but have diﬀ erent ideas 
about how to go about their militant actions. Th ey share 
a similar beginning, however, born of the ﬁ rst intifada, 
or uprising, which was a spontaneous Palestinian revolt 
in Gaza and the West Bank against Israeli crackdowns on 
rioting.
Who are these groups and where did they come 
from?
Islamic terrorist groups include Hezbollah, HAMAS, 
Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ 
Brigades and al-Qaeda. 
Hezbollah Hezbollah, literally the Party of God, is a 
militia group and political party that ﬁ rst emerged in 
Lebanon following the Israeli invasion of that country in 
1982. Hezbollah began with a group of Lebanese Shi’ite 
clerics determined to drive Israel from their homeland. 
Th ey found assistance from Iran, which provided logistical

618 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
 
Al-Qa’ida is and will remain the most serious ter-
rorist threat to the Homeland, as its central leadership 
continues to plan high-impact plots, while pushing oth-
ers in extremist Sunni communities to mimic its eﬀ orts 
and to supplement its capabilities. We judge that 
the United States currently is in a heightened threat 
environment.
 
We assess that al-Qa’ida will continue to enhance 
its capabilities to attack the Homeland through greater 
cooperation with regional terrorist groups. Of note, 
we assess that al-Qa’ida will probably seek to lever-
age the contacts and capabilities of al-Qa’ida in Iraq 
(AQI), its most visible and capable aﬃ  liate and the only 
one known to have expressed a desire to attack the 
Homeland. In addition, we assess that its association 
with AQI helps al-Qa’ida to energize the broader Sunni 
extremist community, raise resources, and to recruit 
and indoctrinate operatives, including for Homeland 
attacks.
 
We assess that al-Qa’ida’s Homeland plotting is 
likely to continue to focus on prominent political, eco-
nomic and infrastructure targets with the goal of pro-
ducing mass casualties, visually dramatic destruction, 
signiﬁ cant economic aftershocks, and/or fear among 
the US population. Th e group is proﬁ cient with conven-
tional small arms and improvised explosive devices, and 
is innovative in creating new capabilities and overcom-
ing security obstacles.
 
We assess that al-Qa’ida will continue to try to 
acquire and employ chemical, biological, radiological or 
nuclear material in attacks and would not hesitate to use 
them if it develops what it deems is suﬃ  cient capability.
 
We assess that other, non-Muslim terrorist 
groups—often referred to as “single-issue” groups 
by the FBI—probably will conduct attacks over the next 
three years given their violent histories, but we assess 
this violence is likely to be on a small scale.
Al-Qaeda’s leadership, once on the run, is thought 
to have regrouped and, having found a safe haven in 
Pakistan, may be stronger than ever, retaining its ability 
to organize complex, mass-casualty attacks and inspiring 
others to do the same (Whitelaw, 2007, p.33). However, 
a “perverse ‘competition’ is now in evidence between the 
Arabic-dominated al Qaeda terrorists and the Iranian-
controlled Hezbollah terrorist group” (Jones, 2007, p.36). 
Th ese two groups compete for funding as well as recruits.
DeYoung (2007, p.A01) believes the next terrorist 
assault on the United States is likely to consist of rela-
tively unsophisticated, near simultaneous attacks similar 
to those attempted in Britain in June, 2007, intended 
to cause widespread fear and panic rather than to cause 
major losses. Counterterrorism oﬃ  cials say the attacks in 
England and Scotland coincide with U.S. intelligence indi-
cating increased movement of money and people from 
controlled by division commanders. Th ey do not always fol-
low the wishes of the command council, formerly led by the 
late Yasser Arafat.
Al-Qaeda A very diﬀ erent terrorist group, and perhaps 
the greatest threat to the United States, is al-Qaeda. Al-
Qaeda, meaning “the base,” is a broad-based Islamic mili-
tant organization founded by Osama bin Laden in the late 
1980s. It began as a logistical network to support Muslims 
ﬁ ghting against the Soviet Union during the Afghan War. 
When the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, 
the organization dispersed but continued to oppose what 
its leaders considered corrupt Islamic regimes and foreign 
presence in Islamic lands. Th e group eventually reestab-
lished its headquarters in Afghanistan under the patron-
age of the Taliban militia.
Al-Qaeda merged with other Islamic extremist orga-
nizations, and its leaders declared jihad on the United 
States. Tens of thousands of Muslim militants through-
out the world were trained in military skills, and its agents 
have engaged in numerous terrorist attacks, including 
the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, the 
suicide bomb attack against the USS Cole and the 9/11 
attacks on the United States (“Al Qaeda”). 
THE THREAT AND REALITY OF TERRORISM
Th e events of 9/11 turned the threat of terrorism into a 
reality for U.S. citizens. Just how real this threat is has 
been examined in National Intelligence Estimate: Th e Ter-
rorist Th reat to the US Homeland (2007), a report that uses 
estimative language, that is, language based on analytical 
assessments and judgments rather than on facts or hard 
evidence. Th e report uses terms such as we assess and 
we judge synonymously and outlines the following key 
judgments:
We judge the US Homeland will face a persistent and 
evolving terrorist threat over the next three years. Th e 
main threat comes from Islamic terrorist groups and 
cells, especially al-Qa’ida, driven by their undiminished 
intent to attack the Homeland and a continued eﬀ ort 
by these terrorist groups to adapt and improve their 
capabilities.
 
We assess that greatly increased worldwide coun-
terterrorism eﬀ orts over the past ﬁ ve years have 
constrained the ability of al-Qa’ida to attack the US 
Homeland again and have led terrorist groups to per-
ceive the Homeland as a harder target to strike than on 
9/11. Th ese measures have helped disrupt known plots 
against the United States since 9/11. We are concerned, 
however, that this level of international cooperation 
may wane as 9/11 becomes a more distant memory and 
perceptions of the threat diverge.

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 619
against Whites, and like their 1960s predecessors, see 
cops as the enemy” (Scoville, 2003, p.46).
THE MILITIA MOVEMENT
Most militia groups are heavily armed and place great 
emphasis on practicing sharpshooting skills (White, 2006, 
p.254). Militia members are commonly frustrated, over-
whelmed and socially unable to cope with the rapid pace 
of change in the modern world. Many militia groups pro-
vide the rhetoric for violence.
OTHER RIGHT-WING EXTREMISTS
Th e preceding groups might also be described as right-
wing extremists. White (2006, pp.250–251) cites three 
issues that rejuvenated the extreme right during the 
1980s and have kept it active since then: the Brady Bill and 
the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents. Th e Brady Bill caused 
militia groups to fear federal gun control legislation. Th e 
Ruby Ridge incident involved an attempt to arrest Randy 
Weaver, a White supremacist charged with selling illegal 
ﬁ rearms to undercover agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). A shootout ensued, result-
ing in the death of a U.S. marshal and Weaver’s young son. 
Th e FBI laid siege to Weaver’s Ruby Ridge cabin and killed 
his pregnant wife before Weaver surrendered.
Th e third galvanizing incident occurred with the federal 
siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas: 
“In 1993, ATF agents attempted to serve a search warrant 
on the compound, but they were met with a hail of gunﬁ re. 
Four agents were killed, and several were wounded. After 
a three-month siege, FBI agents moved in with tear gas. 
Unknown to the agents, the compound was laced with gaso-
line. When the FBI moved in, the Branch Davidians burned 
their fortress, killing over 70 people, including several young 
children held inside the compound” (White, 2006, p.251).
Figure 20.2 illustrates American right-wing terrorism 
from 1979 to 1996.
LEFT-WING EXTREMISTS
Left-wing extremists believe in a Pro-Marxist stance that 
the rich must be brought down and the poor elevated. 
Presently, the largest groups of supporters for this cause 
are Anarchists. 
PRO-LIFE EXTREMISTS
Although many pro-life, antiabortion advocates stay 
within the law in promoting their beliefs, some groups 
do not. One such group is an active terrorist organization 
al-Qaeda camps in the ungoverned tribal areas of Pakistan 
near the Afghan border (DeYoung).
THE DUAL THREAT
While the United States seeks to protect itself from inter-
national terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, it must also 
protect its citizens from those among us who would like 
nothing better than to tear the country apart and recast 
it in their own image. America’s police oﬃ  cers are on the 
front lines of both battles. 
TERRORIST GROUPS 
IN THE UNITED STATES
Several groups on the left and right, including 
environmentalist groups, pose speciﬁ c chal-
lenges and threats to law enforcement.
Domestic terrorist groups within the United States 
include White supremacists, Black supremacists, militia 
groups, other right-wing extremists, left-wing extremists, 
pro-life extremists, animal rights extremists and environ-
mental extremists.
Many of these groups were discussed in Chapter 19 as 
hate groups or cults.
WHITE SUPREMACISTS
Th e Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is one of America’s original ter-
rorist organizations: “Formed by Confederate veterans 
following the Civil War, the goal of the original Klan was 
to terrorize freed blacks and exert political inﬂ uence over 
the Reconstruction south. . . . Th e Klan is still out there. 
Members of local and regional Klan groups have been 
blamed for church burnings, intimidation and harassment 
of minorities and minority advocates, and other crimes” 
(Scoville, 2003, p.48). Neo-Nazi groups also espouse 
White supremacy, as do “skinheads.”
BLACK SUPREMACISTS
Th e Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was established 
in 1966 during a time of racial turmoil: “Today, a newly 
reconstituted Black Panther Party for Self-Defense has 
been organized, and it qualiﬁ es as a hate group. Th ese con-
temporary Panthers are heavily armed, advocate violence

of the interrelationships of organisms and their environ-
ment. Ecoterrorism seeks to inﬂ ict economic damage 
on those who proﬁ t from the destruction of the natural 
environment. Th e term ecoterrorism in conjunction with 
saving the environment is controversial because few peo-
ple want to harm animals, and even fewer want to harm 
the planet. However, some cross the line from rhetoric to 
terror. When they cross this line, their violent actions are 
criminal.
One such group is the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), 
which often works with the ALF. Arson is a favorite 
weapon, responsible for tens of millions of dollars of 
property damage, including a U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture building, a U.S. Forest Service ranger station and a 
Colorado ski resort. Th e group has claimed responsibility 
for releasing 5,000 mink from a Michigan fur farm, releas-
ing 600 wild horses from an Oregon corral and burning the 
Michigan State University’s genetic engineering research 
oﬃ  ces.
called the Army of God: “Abortion clinics and their staﬀ s 
are common Army of God targets, with zealots commit-
ting crimes ranging from arson to assault to assassina-
tion” (Scoville, 2003, p.48).
ANIMAL RIGHTS EXTREMISTS
Th e Animal Liberation Front (ALF), a clandestine, decen-
tralized group, is one of the most active domestic terrorist 
assemblages, whose targets have included research labs, meat 
packing plants and furriers (Scoville, 2003, p.46). ALF has 
claimed credit for numerous acts of vandalism, arson and the 
“liberation” of laboratory animals, attacks that have cost mil-
lions of dollars in damages and setbacks in medical research.

terrorists,” with eco being derived from ecology—the study

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 621
Terrorists use arson, explosives and bombs, weapons 
of mass destruction (biological, chemical or nuclear 
agents), or technology.
Law enforcement agencies use the term CBR to include 
all potential terrorist threats that can have consequences for 
the health of large numbers of people. Th ese threats include 
chemical agents (C), biological agents (B) and radiation expo-
sure (R). Figure 20.4 presents the most likely to least likely 
terrorist threats; Figure 20.5 illustrates the relative level of 
impact by weapon used. Although explosives are considered 
the most likely to be used by terrorists, they also carry the 
least amount of impact relative to the other threats.
EXPLOSIVES AND BOMBS
Directions for making pipe bombs and other incendi-
ary devices can be found on the Internet. Dowle (2006a, 
p.17) reports that the prevalence of homemade explosives 
(HMEs) in terrorist improvised explosive devices (IEDs) 
is increasing, citing the example of a Google search for 
homemade explosives that returned 34.5 million hits. 
TERRORISTS AS CRIMINALS
Law enforcement agencies and oﬃ  cers who 
have been trained and equipped to deal with 
traditional crimes are now focusing on apprehending 
individuals operating with diﬀ erent motivations, diﬀ er-
ent objectives and much deadlier weapons than traditional 
criminals use. A critical diﬀ erence in approach exists bet-
ween dealing with a terrorist and a street criminal: When 
ﬁ ghting terrorists, it’s kill or be killed, not capture and 
convict. Th e diﬀ erences between the street criminal and 
the terrorist are summarized in Table 20.1.
Some suggest terrorists and criminals are more dif-
ferent than they are alike: “Criminals have an attitude of 
indiﬀ erence, and their stress levels are lower—even while 
engaged in a crime—because they have accumulated 
experience. Most terrorists . . . show very high stress lev-
els” (Miller, 2006, p.20). Most terrorists are ﬁ rst-timers. 
In addition, terrorists seek wide-scale damage whereas 
criminals seek personal ﬁ nancial or material gain. 
METHODS USED BY 
TERRORISTS
Terrorists have employed a variety of techniques 
in furtherance of their cause. (Th e use of arson 
has already been discussed.) Figure 20.3 illustrates the 
methods used in the signiﬁ cant international terrorist 
attacks involving a U.S. citizen or facility during 2004.

622 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
Incendiary devices and explosives are most likely to be 
used because they are easy to make. Bombing does require a 
certain level of organization, equipment, materials and a place 
to put the bomb together, all aspects that an investigator’s 
knowledge can help detect, helping prevent these crimes.
Suspicious Packages Security oﬃ  cers dispatched to 
a suspicious package, unattended bag or other such items 
must be extremely cautious. If an oﬃ  cer suspects that the 
call involves an actual bomb, the oﬃ  cer should (1) move to 
an area not in direct line of sight of the device, (2) move away 
from glass and parked vehicles, (3) move away from second-
ary hazards such as electricity and gas, (4) move behind hard 
cover and (5) set cordons at 100 yards for items carried by 
hand, 200 yards for suspect cars and small vans and 400 to 
800 yards for suspect large vehicles (Dowle, 2006c, p.13).
Suicide Bombers Hronick (2006) deﬁ nes suicide ter-
rorism as “intentionally killing oneself for the purpose of 
killing others, in the service of a political or ideological 
goal.” As noted in Table 20.1, whereas a typical criminal 
will by no means look to lay down his life for the sake of 
crime, suicide bombers go to their targets knowing that 
they will die there. Most believe the act makes them mar-
tyrs and ensures them a place in their version of heaven. 
Th eir families are usually held in reverence and taken care 
of. Suicide bombers try to kill as many people as possible. 
Morgenstern (2006, p.32) asserts, “Th e suicide terror 
attack is clearly alive and well—and could easily be carried 
out on American soil.” Wexler (2007, p.i) suggests, “Th e 
9/11 hijackers were the ultimate suicide bombers. Th ey used 
commercial aircraft as bombs rather than devices that ﬁ t 
inside a backpack. But at their core, their motivations were 
the same—they believed that political or religious ideology 
justiﬁ ed murdering innocent bystanders and killing them-
selves in the process.” Wexler reports that when experts were 
asked which two types of terrorist attacks are most likely, 
the most common response was “suicide bombing attacks” 
closely followed by “attack on major infrastructure.” 
Th e notion of a suicide terrorist as a young male, 
fundamentalist fanatic is dangerously narrow-minded 
(Morgenstern, 2006, p.36). Potential suicide terrorists may 
come from diﬀ erent backgrounds, diﬀ erent age groups, be 
male or female, educated or uneducated, an upstanding 
citizen or a deviant. Among the warning signs revealing a 
suicide bomber are unseasonable garb; profuse sweating; 
obvious disguises (such as a police uniform with a secu-
rity badge); and a well-dressed, perfumed appearance and 
demeanor ﬁ tting for one who is going to meet his maker.
Priem, Hunter and Polisar (2007, p.35) explain the 
typical phases in a suicide bombing attack:
Th e operational cycle for suicide bombing attacks can 
be viewed as a nine-phase process that begins with 
From 1978 to 1996, Th eodore Kaczynski, the notori-
ous Unabomber, terrorized the country through a string 
of 16 mail bombings that killed three people, apparently 
in a protest against technology. Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, 
found guilty of masterminding the ﬁ rst World Trade Cen-
ter bombing in 1993, declared that he was proud to be a 
terrorist and that terrorism was the only viable response 
to what he saw as a Jewish lobby in Washington. Th e car 
bomb used to shatter the Murrah Federal Building in 
1995 was Timothy McVeigh’s way of protesting the gov-
ernment and its raid on the Branch Davidians at Waco. 
In 2002, Lucas Helder terrorized the Midwest by placing 
18 pipe bombs accompanied by antigovernment letters in 
mailboxes throughout ﬁ ve states. Six exploded, injuring 
four letter carriers and two residents. And the most hor-
riﬁ c act of terrorism against the United States occurred 
on September 11, 2001, when two airplanes were used 
as missiles to explode into the World Trade Center and 
another plane was used as a missile to attack the Penta-
gon. A fourth plane crashed in a rural Pennsylvania ﬁ eld 
before it could reach its intended target.

agents. Because such agents carry the potential to cause 
widespread devastation, they are also referred to as weap-
ons of mass destruction (WMDs). Biological WMDs have 
actually been in use since the 1300s. Th e 20th century 
brought the ﬁ rst use of artiﬁ cially produced WMDs—or 
chemical agents—during World War I. Today, the means 
for developing nuclear, radiological, biological and chemi-
cal weapons are well known.
Some experts suggest that, of these three NBC means, 
bioterrorism is the least likely to occur whereas chemical 
attacks are the most likely because the raw materials are 
easy to get and the devices are simple to assemble and use.
Biological Agents Bioterrorism involves dissemina-
tion of anthrax, botulism and smallpox as WMDs, and is 
a potential reality following the anthrax scare of 2001 on 
the heels of the 9/11 attacks. Especially susceptible to bio-
terrorism are the nation’s food and water supplies, which 
might also be attacked using chemical agents.
Chemical Agents Th e attention of security experts was 
riveted on the potential for chemical terrorism in 1995 
when members of Aum Shinrikyu, a new-age cult, released 
deadly sarin gas into the Tokyo subway system, killing 
12 and sending 5,000 to the hospital. It was what many 
considered their worst nightmare. Unfortunately, anyone 
with Internet access and a Web browser can, in less than 
40 minutes, obtain the chemical formula for the invisible, 
odorless and highly toxic sarin gas.
One chemical agent receiving increased attention 
in security periodicals is chlorine gas. Although a chlo-
rine gas attack requires perfect conditions and a poor 
emergency response to cause heavy casualties, “if prop-
erly released in a well-populated area, chlorine gas has 
the potential to cause tens of thousands of casualties” 
(Harwood, 2007, p.18).
Th e four common types of chemical weapons are 
nerve agents, blood agents, choking agents and blistering 
agents. One agent, ricin toxin, is both a biological and a 
chemical weapon. Ricin is more than 1,000 times more 
poisonous than cyanide and in its purest form, a grain of 
ricin no bigger than a grain of table salt can kill an adult.
“Emergency Procedures for Acts of Terrorism” (2006, 
p.4) suggests the following signs of a chemical release: dif-
ﬁ culty breathing; eye irritation; loss of coordination; nau-
sea; burning sensation in nose, throat and lungs; and the 
presence of dead insects or birds. Th is source recommends 
that, should a chemical attack occur, doors and windows 
should be closed and all ventilation turned oﬀ , includ-
ing furnaces, air conditioners, vents and fans. Th e room 
should be sealed with duct tape and plastic sheeting. After 
a chemical attack, decontamination is needed within min-
utes of exposure to minimize health consequences.
identiﬁ cation and recruitment of bombers; continues 
through their training, target selection, purchase of 
components, fabrication of devices, ﬁ nal preparation, 
and movement to the target; and ends with the detona-
tion of the device. . . . 
 
Interdiction during the last two phases is extremely 
diﬃ  cult. Law enforcement agencies must be proactive, 
taking advantage of opportunities for detection and 
eﬀ ective interdiction during the initial seven stages. . . .
 
Th ere is evidence to suggest that recruiting initia-
tives may be under way in U.S. prison populations and 
among radicalized extremists—including U.S. citizens 
in a number of U.S. communities. . . .
 
Perhaps the best opportunities for detection and 
successful interdiction occur when terrorist organiza-
tions are selecting targets and conducting reconnais-
sance against them as well as when they are purchasing 
explosives components and fabricating explosive 
devices.
Agencies are strongly encouraged to develop suicide 
bomb response protocols, with principles consistent with 
the agency’s use of force policies, procedures and train-
ing (Spahr, Ederheimer and Bilson, 2007, p.13). Th e Police 
Executive Research Forum (PERF) has developed guide-
lines for a patrol-level response to a suicide bomb threat, 
stressing that any protocol should be consistent with the 
agency’s policies and procedures for use of force, active 
shooter situations and bomb threats. 
A suggested tactic for ﬁ rst responders facing a poten-
tial suicide bomber is to issue the unambiguous verbal com-
mand: “Do not move.” Any movement is a violation and 
might trigger the explosives (Chudwin, 2007, pp.62–63). 
Live-ﬁ re shooters should stand ready to make a head shot, 
preferably with a long gun able to deliver a high-velocity 
round or 12-gauge slug. Oﬃ  cers should not let their guard 
down with “presumed compliance.” Oﬃ  cers should estab-
lish a perimeter around the suspected bomber, consider-
ing that the blast radius for explosive devices attached to 
the body can easily cover 100 yards.
Prevention Strategies It’s virtually impossible to 
screen all of the cars and trucks that pass critical build-
ings. Th erefore, authorities commonly use simple tools, 
such as restricting parking and traﬃ  c and putting up 
concrete median barriers and bollards, security check-
points, static physical security [closed circuit television] 
and active detection methods. Beyond these measures, 
vehicle registration and background checks might also be 
considered.
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (WMD)
Much concern centers around potential use of nuclear, 
biological and chemical agents, also referred to as NBC 

624 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
use a computer to monitor the vapors, smells, odors and 
chemistry of the air remotely.
Robotic detection and identiﬁ cation technology can 
warn responders of NBC agents’ presence and strength. 
Global positioning systems (GPS) can be applied to deter-
mine the coordinates of an NBC release relative to the 
position of responders, residential or other civilian cen-
ters or other critical location information. GPS can also 
track vehicles charged with transporting NBC materials 
to and from the site. Finally, weather data, such as wind 
direction and speed, barometric pressure, relative humid-
ity, and so on, is critical to responders at NBC scenes.
A WMD Team Law enforcement agencies should select 
and train oﬃ  cers to form a WMD team to be ready if 
needed. Members of the team must have adequate personal 
protective equipment (PPE). Implementing a PPE program 
protects ﬁ rst responders and eliminates “blue canaries.” 
(Police oﬃ  cers who walk into hazardous situations and die 
are sometimes described as blue canaries—from the prac-
tice of coal miners releasing a canary into a mine shaft to see 
whether the shaft was safe for breathing (if the canary died, 
more ventilation was needed.) Table 20.2 illustrates the 
level of protection, description, type of protection aﬀ orded 
and circumstance for use of each level of equipment.
TECHNOLOGICAL TERRORISM
Technological terrorism includes attacks on our tech-
nology as well as by technology. We rely on energy to 
drive our technology. An attack on the U.S. energy supply 
could be devastating. Likewise, an attack on the com-
puter systems and networks critical to the functioning of 
businesses, health care facilities, educational institutions, 
Th e Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has 
released interim rules to streamline federal security 
regulations for high-risk chemical facilities nationwide 
(Edwards, 2007, p.1). Th e DHS will screen more than 
15,000 chemical facilities and require those with certain 
quantities of speciﬁ ed chemicals complete an assessment 
to determine a risk level. A company found to pose greater 
risk will be required to conduct a vulnerability assessment 
and submit site security plans that meet the DHS perfor-
mance standards (Daniels, 2007, p.8). Failure to comply 
could result in penalties as high as $25,000 per day and an 
order to cease operations.
Th e DHS has developed and implemented the Rapidly 
Deployable Chemical Detection System (RDCDS), capable 
of detecting dozens of chemical agents accurately and 
quickly at fairly low density levels (Elliott, 2006, p.40). Th e 
goal of RDCDS is to provide chemical detection and pro-
tection at public venues large enough to present attractive 
targets to terrorists.
Nuclear Terrorism A survey conducted for the Sage 
Foundation found that the top fear of Americans is nuclear 
terrorism; 74 percent of Americans believe that a successful 
terrorist attack on U.S. soil is likely to happen, with almost 
half (49 percent) believing an attack will include some sort 
of nuclear device (“Survey: Nuclear Terrorism Top Fear of 
Americans,” 2008). Goodwyn (2008, p.48) notes, “Terror-
ists’ attraction to nuclear weapons is due to the destruc-
tive capability of the weapons, the horriﬁ c eﬀ ects it would 
have on life and property, and also the economic impact 
on all U.S. citizens as well as the entire world.” 
Th e U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) esti-
mates that an average of 375 devices of all kinds contain-
ing radioactive material are reported lost or stolen each 
year. Such devices are also called “dirty bombs.” Although 
this may seem another horriﬁ c addition to a terrorist 
arsenal as a weapon of choice, the most destruction and 
disruption from a dirty bomb detonation will be caused by 
public panic, not radiation.
Detecting Radiation and Other Bioterrorism Agents 
Dosimeters are small, lightweight devices that use silicon 
diode technology to instantaneously detect and display 
the accumulated exposure dose and dose rate. Th ey can iden-
tify the speciﬁ c radionuclide(s) involved and let investiga-
tors calculate how long they can safely remain on the scene.
Another advance in detecting hazardous agents is 
the electronic nose. Already used to select fragrant wines 
and diagnose diseases, electronic noses are now “sniﬃ  ng” 
their way into the market for detecting hazardous agents. 
Electronic nose technology is designed to detect all chemi-
cals within an aroma or fragrance and miss nothing. Some 
electronic noses already use wireless technology, allowing 
an investigator more than a mile away from the device to 
Technology Innovations
Faherty (2007) describes a new technology to 
safeguard New York City from nuclear attack: 
The goal of the program is to ban nuclear weap-
ons from the city by creating a 50-mile protective 
perimeter. 
The detectors decipher between deadly radia-
tion in nuclear weapons and harmless radiation 
carried by New Yorkers involved in recent medical 
tests. It tells you precisely what the element is and 
how much radiation exists, which is 90 percent of 
the battle.
The detectors function by differentiating 
between harmful and innocuous isotopes in 
radiation.

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 625
Fraud has become increasingly common among 
terrorists—as a way to generate revenue and as a way to 
gain access to their targets. Fraudulently obtained driver’s 
licenses, passports and other identiﬁ cation documents are 
often found among terrorists’ belongings. No matter how 
terrorist groups are ﬁ nanced, they usually need to hide 
where the money came from.
MONEY LAUNDERING
Money laundering was discussed in Chapter 14. However, 
one tactic is especially important in hiding the money trail of 
terrorist ﬁ nancing—hawala. Hawala is an informal banking 
system based on trust and often bartering, common through-
out the Middle East and used to transfer billions of dollars 
every year. No tax records or paper trails exist. Th is practice 
has been used for many years to move terrorist money with-
out a trace of banking records or currency transaction reports 
(CTR). Hawala allows money launderers to secretly hide and 
send money out of the country without detection.
THE FEDERAL RESPONSE 
TO TERRORISM
On October 19, 1984, President Ronald Reagan 
signed into law the Act to Combat Interna-
tional Terrorism (ACIT), which established a monetary 
reward program for information involving terrorism. In 
1996, the FBI established the National Counterterrorism 
Center. Also in 1996, the Antiterrorism and Eﬀ ective 
the military and all governmental agencies would be 
catastrophic. Cyberterrorism is deﬁ ned by the FBI 
as “terrorism that initiates, or threatens to initiate, the 
exploitation of or attack on information systems.” 
Damage to our critical computer systems can put our 
safety and our national security in jeopardy. Each of the 
preceding types of terrorism poses a threat to our national 
security.
FUNDING TERRORISM
It takes money to carry out terrorism for both 
weapons and general operating expenses. 
Garrett (2008, p.6) stresses, “If you really want to ﬁ ght a 
War on Terror, you need to hit terrorists where it hurts—
their pocketbooks.” Terrorist groups commonly collabo-
rate with organized criminal groups to deal drugs, arms 
and, in some instances, people. Th e concept of narcoterror-
ism refers to the use of terrorist tactics to support drug 
operations or the use of drug trade proﬁ ts to ﬁ nance ter-
rorism (White, 2006, p.76). To ﬁ nance their operations, 
terrorist groups smuggle stolen goods and contraband, 
forge documents, proﬁ t from the diamond trade and 
engage in extortion and protection rackets (White, 
pp.68–79). 
Many terrorist operations are ﬁ nanced by charitable 
groups and wealthy Arabs sympathetic to the group’s 
cause. To investigate local charities, any interested indi-
vidual can access the information by contacting the Better 
Business Bureau or the Wise Giving Alliance.

Goals of the DHS Michael Chertoﬀ , U.S. Secretary of 
Homeland Security, described ﬁ ve goals he saw as priori-
ties for the DHS (“An Interview,” 2007, pp.16–18):
 1. Increase our ability to keep bad people out of the 
country.
 2. Keep bad things out of the country, increasing port 
security.
 3. Protect our infrastructure better.
 4. Continue to build a response capability with modern 
computer tools.
 5. Promote intelligence sharing, not only horizontally 
across the federal government but vertically with the 
local government as well.
THE USA PATRIOT ACT
On October 26, 2001, President Bush signed into law the 
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appro-
priate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism 
(USA PATRIOT) Act, giving police unprecedented ability to 
search, seize, detain and eavesdrop in their pursuit of pos-
sible terrorists. Th e law expands the FBI’s wiretapping and 
electronic surveillance authority and allows nationwide 
jurisdiction for search warrants and electronic surveillance 
devices, including legal expansion of those devices to e-mail 
and the Internet. It includes money laundering provisions, 
sets strong penalties for anyone who harbors or ﬁ nances 
terrorists and establishes new punishments for possessing 
biological weapons. Further, it makes it a federal crime to 
commit an act of terrorism against a mass transit system.
The USA PATRIOT Act signiﬁ cantly improves the nation’s 
counterterrorism efforts by
• • Allowing investigators to use the tools already available 
to investigate organized crime and drug trafﬁ cking.
• • Facilitating information sharing and cooperation 
among government agencies so they can better 
“connect the dots.”
• • Updating the law to reﬂ ect new technologies and 
new threats.
• • Increasing the penalties for those who commit or 
support terrorist crimes.
Th e USA PATRIOT Act was reauthorized in 2006.
Death Penalty Act was passed, including several speciﬁ c 
measures aimed at terrorism. It enhanced the federal gov-
ernment’s power to deny visas to individuals belonging to 
terrorist groups and simpliﬁ ed the process for deporting 
aliens convicted of crimes.
Having announced in 1999 that preventing terrorism 
was its top priority, the FBI added a new Counterterror-
ism Division with four subunits: the International Terror-
ism Section, the Domestic Terrorism Section, the National 
Infrastructure Protection Center and the National Domes-
tic Preparedness Oﬃ  ce. But this was not enough to avert 
the tragic events of 9/11. It took a disaster of that magni-
tude to make the war on terrorism truly the number-one 
priority of the United States. One of the ﬁ rst initiatives 
was establishing a new federal agency at the cabinet level.
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
On October 8, 2001, President George W. Bush signed Exec-
utive Order 13228 establishing the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS) to be headed by then Pennsylvania 
Governor Tom Ridge (who resigned to take the post).
The Department of Homeland Security was established 
as a result of 9/11, reorganizing the departments of the 
federal government.
Homeland security is “a concerted eﬀ ort to prevent 
terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce Amer-
ica’s vulnerability to terrorism and minimize the damage 
and recover from attacks that do occur.” Th e mission of 
the DHS is “to develop and coordinate the implementa-
tion of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the 
United States from terrorist threats or attacks.” Figure 
20.6 shows the organization of the DHS.
Also in September, Attorney General John Ashcroft 
announced that all U.S. attorneys were establishing antiter-
rorism task forces to serve as conduits for information about 
suspected terrorists between federal and local agencies.
At the federal level, the FBI is the lead agency for 
responding to acts of domestic terrorism. The Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the lead 
agency for consequence management (after an attack).
Th e DHS serves in a broad capacity, facilitating col-
laboration between local and federal law enforcement to 
develop a national strategy to detect, prepare for, prevent, 
protect against, respond to and recover from terrorist 
attacks within the United States. Th e DHS has established 
a ﬁ ve-level color-coded threat system used to communicate

628 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
Th is case involved several residents of Lackawanna, who 
traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 to receive training at an 
al Qaeda–aﬃ  liated camp near Kandahar. Th e investiga-
tion of the “Lackawanna Six” began during the summer 
of 2001, when the FBI received an anonymous letter 
indicating that these six individuals and others might be 
involved in criminal activity and associating with foreign 
terrorists. Th e FBI concluded that existing law required 
the creation of two separate investigations in order to 
retain the option of using FISA [the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act]: a criminal investigation of possible 
drug crimes and an intelligence investigation related to 
terrorist threats. Over the ensuing months, two squads 
carried on these two separate investigations simulta-
neously, and there were times when the intelligence 
oﬃ  cers and the law enforcement agents concluded that 
they could not be in the same room during brieﬁ ngs to 
discuss their respective investigations with each other.
 
Th e USA PATRIOT Act, however, took down the 
“wall” separating these two investigations by making 
clear that sharing case-sensitive information between 
these two groups was allowed. As a result of key infor-
mation shared by intelligence investigators, law enforce-
ment agents learned that an individual mentioned in the 
anonymous letter was an al-Qaeda agent. Further infor-
mation shared between intelligence and law enforce-
ment personnel then expedited the investigation of the 
Lackawanna Six and allowed charges to be ﬁ led against 
these individuals. Five of the Lackawanna Six pleaded 
guilty to providing material support to al-Qaeda, and the 
sixth pleaded guilty to conducting transactions unlaw-
fully with al-Qaeda. Th ese individuals were sentenced to 
prison terms ranging from seven to ten years.
 
Before passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, applica-
tions for orders authorizing electronic surveillance or 
physical searches under FISA had to include a certiﬁ -
cation from a high-ranking executive branch oﬃ  cial 
that the purpose of the surveillance or search was to 
gather foreign intelligence information. As interpreted 
by the courts and later the Justice Department, this 
requirement meant that the “primary purpose” of 
the collection had to be to obtain foreign intelligence 
information rather than evidence of a crime. Over the 
years, the prevailing interpretation and implementa-
tion of the “primary purpose” standard had the eﬀ ect 
of limiting coordination and information sharing 
between intelligence and law enforcement personnel. 
Because the courts evaluated the government’s purpose 
for using FISA at least in part by examining the nature 
and extent of such coordination, the more coordina-
tion that occurred, the more likely courts would ﬁ nd 
that law enforcement, rather than foreign intelligence, 
had become the primary purpose of the surveillance or 
search. (Report from the Field, 2004, p.3)
Using Tools Already in Use in the War on Drugs Despite 
their diﬀ erences, terrorism and illicit drug activity have 
several commonalties, making a case for exploring any 
shared lessons such as using sophisticated undercover 
enforcement operations. Both terrorism and drug activ-
ity also have a domestic component, but the threat from 
the organized, international activities is far more devas-
tating. In addition, some evidence suggests that terrorist 
cells and networks have structures similar to those of drug 
cartels. Finally, both counterterror and counterdrug strate-
gies require coordination among various law enforcement 
agencies and strategic cooperation and information shar-
ing with other partner countries. 
Facilitating Information Sharing Th e importance of 
the information-sharing provision of the act can be seen 
in the case of an al-Qaeda cell in Lackawanna, New York, 
and its implications on updating the law to reﬂ ect new 
technologies and new threats:

establishes the process for combining consequence, vul-
nerability and threat information to produce a compre-
hensive, systematic and rational assessment or national 
or sector-speciﬁ c risk that drives CI/KR-protection 
activities.
Th e 17 speciﬁ c sectors included in the plan include 
agriculture and food; banking and ﬁ nance; chemical; 
commercial facilities; communications; dams; defense 
industrial base; drinking water and water treatment 
systems; emergency services; energy; government 
facilities; information technology; national monu-
ments and icons; nuclear reactors, materials and waste; 
postal and shipping; public health and healthcare; and 
transportation.
FUSION CENTERS
An initiative aimed at promoting and facilitating infor-
mation and intelligence sharing among federal and 
local law enforcement agencies is the development of 
fusion centers throughout the country. Straw (2008, 
p.68) notes, “While government is notoriously slow to 
implement change, one post–9/11 reform has bucked 
the trend: the rapidly growing national network of 
state, regional and urban intelligence fusion centers. At 
the centers, teams of analysts crunch data and produce 
reﬁ ned intelligence to help stakeholders address all haz-
ards and all crimes.”
“Fusion refers to the overreaching process of manag-
ing the ﬂ ow of information and intelligence across all lev-
els and sectors of government and private industry. Th e 
fusion process turns information and intelligence into 
actionable knowledge. . . A fusion center is an eﬀ ective 
Controversy over the USA PATRIOT Act Th e PATRIOT 
Act has come under attack from groups across the politi-
cal spectrum. Some members of Congress and civil liber-
ties groups say the act has given federal agents too much 
power to pursue suspected terrorists, threatening the civil 
rights and privacy of Americans.
Th e Justice Department has launched a Web site, 
www.lifeandliberty.gov, devoted to dispelling some myths 
about the PATRIOT Act. Th e intent of the PATRIOT Act 
when passed in 2001 as a response to the 9/11 attacks was 
to provide federal law enforcement with better means to 
defend against terrorism. Several other federal initiatives 
are aimed at preventing terrorist attacks or at least miti-
gating their eﬀ ects.
THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
PROTECTION PLAN (NIPP)
Th e National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) (2006) 
is a comprehensive risk management framework deﬁ n-
ing critical infrastructure protection roles and responsi-
bilities of federal, state, local, tribal and private security 
partners. Th e goal of the NIPP is to “Build a safer, more 
secure and more resilient America by enhancing pro-
tection of the nation’s critical infrastructure and key 
resources (CI/KR) to prevent, deter, neutralize or miti-
gate the eﬀ ects of deliberate eﬀ orts by terrorists to 
destroy, incapacitate or exploit them; and to strengthen 
national preparedness, timely response and rapid recov-
ery in the event of an attack, natural disaster or other 
emergency.”
Th e cornerstone of the NIPP is the risk management 
framework, shown in Figure 20.8. Th is framework

 4. Homeland security strategies must be coordinated 
nationally, not federally.
 5. Bottom-up engineering is important, involving the 
diversity of the state, tribal and local public safety 
communities in noncompetitive collaboration.
Th e 16,000 state and local law enforcement agencies in 
the United States employ more than 700,000 oﬃ  cers who 
patrol the city streets daily and know their communities 
intimately. As Kelling and Bratton (2006, p.2) contend, “Th e 
counterterrorist potential of local police is partly a function 
of numbers. More than 700,000 local law enforcement oﬃ  -
cers work in the continental U.S. compared with just 12,000 
FBI agents. Based on numbers alone, local law enforcement 
personnel are much more likely than feds to cross paths with 
terrorists.” Myers (2006, p.3) advocates putting the “home” 
back in homeland security, asserting, ”Neighborhood-by-
neighborhood, our people expect us to be the front line of 
keeping them safe and secure. . . . Under our American tradi-
tion, the absence of a national police force means that the 
response of better funding and coordination between local, 
regional, state and federal resources holds the most hope.”
The ﬁ rst line of defense against terrorism is the patrol 
ofﬁ cer in the ﬁ eld.
Any law enforcement oﬃ  cer can potentially come in 
contact with a terrorist at any time, whether investigating 
an unrelated crime, conducting routine duties or backing 
up another oﬃ  cer. Many of the 9/11 hijackers had prior 
contact with law enforcement oﬃ  cers in various parts of 
the country. For examples, on September 9, 2001, Ziad 
Jarrah, hijacker of the plane that crashed in Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania, was stopped by police in Maryland for driv-
ing 90 mph in a 65 mph zone. Jarrah was issued a ticket 
and released. Similarly, in August 2001, Hani Hanjour, 
hijack pilot of the plane that crashed into the Pentagon and 
killed 289 persons, was stopped for speeding by police in 
Arlington, Virginia, was issued a ticket and released. Han-
jour paid the ticket to avoid having to show up in court.
INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE 
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES
Investigating possible terrorist activities is facil-
itated by the fact that terrorists also often 
engage in other criminal activities. A documented nexus 
exists between traditional crime and terrorism, involving 
and eﬃ  cient mechanism to exchange information and 
intelligence, maximize resources, streamline operations 
and improve the ability to ﬁ ght crime and terrorism by 
merging data from a variety of sources” (Fusion Center 
Guidelines, 2006, p.3).
Forty-two fusion centers have been established in 37 
states and have begun making some important connections. 
However, general assessment of the centers is that they are 
a costly but largely ineﬀ ective weapon against terrorism 
(Hall, 2007). DHS has given states $380 million to set up 
the centers, but they tend to gravitate to an “all-crimes and 
even broader all-hazards approach” rather than focusing 
on recognizing suspicious activity, patterns and people and 
using the information to prevent terrorist attacks.
HOMETOWN SECURITY AND 
HOMELAND SECURITY
The criticality of local law enforcement has been 
recognized ever since homeland security 
became a focus. Law enforcement personnel have realized 
that, in our post 9/11 society, their duties have expanded 
considerably, and they are no longer looking to federal 
agencies and the military as the source of our county’s 
protection: “With past terrorist assaults and the threat of 
more to come, keeping the (bigger) bad guy at bay is no 
longer the sole domain of the FBI” (Schreiber, 2008, p.49). 
Lovette (2008, p.34) echoes, “On 9/11 cops became a vital 
component of the homeland security mission. And the 
majority of the responsibility for this additional require-
ment came to rest squarely on the shoulders of the uni-
formed patrol oﬃ  cer, America’s ﬁ rst line of defense in the 
war on crime, the war on drugs, the war on gangs, and 
now, the war on terror.”
Th e International Association of Chiefs of Police 
(IACP) report From Hometown Security to Homeland Secu-
rity (2005, p.2), from its “Taking Command” project, 
suggests that our nation’s current homeland security 
strategy “is handicapped by a fundamental ﬂ aw. It does 
not suﬃ  ciently incorporate the advice, expertise or con-
sent of public safety organizations at state, tribal or local 
levels.” Th e IACP has identiﬁ ed ﬁ ve key principles that 
should form the basis for a national homeland security 
strategy:
 1. All terrorism is local.
 2. Prevention is paramount.
 3. Hometown security is homeland security.

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 631
In addition to being aware of potential targets in a 
community, investigators should also make use of the link 
between terrorism and white-collar crime that often exists.
THE LINK BETWEEN TERRORISM 
AND WHITE-COLLAR CRIME
One way to address terrorism is to modify laws that deal 
with white-collar crimes, traditionally nonviolent and 
involving some form of fraud to achieve ﬁ nancial gain. 
Th ese crimes include credit card fraud, insurance fraud, 
identity theft, money laundering, immigration fraud and 
tax evasion.
Th is approach rests on the assumption that terrorist 
activities require funding for weaponry, training, travel 
and living expenses. In addition, terrorists create and use 
false identiﬁ cations to enter the country, gain employ-
ment, acquire equipment and accumulate money. Cases 
involving money laundering should be looked at as not only 
a white-collar crime but also as potentially linked to terror-
ism. Th e investigative techniques described in Chapter 18 
would be applicable in this counterterrorism strategy.
THE TYPICAL STAGES IN A TERRORIST 
ATTACK
Terrorist attacks typically have three stages. Th e ﬁ rst 
stage is research, including surveillance, stakeouts and 
fraudulent identiﬁ cation, traﬃ  cking in illegal merchan-
dise and drug sales as means to terrorists’ ends (Loyka, 
Faggiani and Karchmer, 2005, p.7). Bratton (2006a, 
pp.2–3) points out, “More and more of our organized 
crime investigations lead circuitously back to terrorism 
cases. We know that there is a conﬁ rmed link between 
counterfeit products and terrorism funding . . . Today’s 
organized crime entities have tentacles that extend inter-
nationally. In Los Angeles, we know that individuals 
involved in contraband cigarette traﬃ  cking, controlled 
substance traﬃ  cking, trademark violations, extortion, 
mail fraud, wire fraud, tax fraud, insurance fraud and 
money laundering are also signiﬁ cant fundraisers for 
known terrorist groups, including Hezbollah and 
HAMAS.”
A major challenge in the war on terrorism is ensur-
ing that individual oﬃ  cers remain vigilant (Dowle, 2006b, 
p.22). Law enforcement oﬃ  cers should be aware of ter-
rorist indicators such as negative rhetoric, excessive physi-
cal training, anti-American literature or a disregard for 
U.S. laws. Terrorists and their supporters tend to act alike 
because many have trained in the same camps and share 
the same negative beliefs. 
Investigators should also be knowledgeable of vulner-
able, valuable targets for a terrorist attack, such as any 
high-occupancy structure or any site where a signiﬁ cant 
number of lives are aﬀ ected; a structure containing dan-
gerous substances or articles; any vital, high-use structure 
composing an infrastructure; a site of signiﬁ cant histori-
cal, symbolic, strategic, defensive or functional value to 
the nation, including structures holding highly sensitive, 
rare, historical or irreplaceable artifacts, documents or 
other such content.
The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of 
Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets (2008) lists the fol-
lowing as critical infrastructures: agriculture and food, 
water, public health, emergency services, defense indus-
trial base, telecommunications, energy, transportation, 
banking and ﬁ nance, chemical industry and hazardous 
materials and postal and shipping facilities. Th e follow-
ing are listed as key assets: national monuments and 
icons, nuclear power plants, dams, government facili-
ties and commercial key assets. Th e U.S. Postal Service 
has provided indicators of suspicious mail, shown in 
Table 20.3.
Although focusing on logical targets for terrorist 
attacks, “soft” targets—that is, those that are relatively 
unguarded or diﬃ  cult to guard—should not be overlooked, 
including shopping malls, subways, trains, sporting stadi-
ums, theaters, schools, hospitals, restaurants, entertain-
ment parks, compressed gas and oil storage areas, chemical 
plants, pharmaceutical companies and many others.
TABLE 20.3 | Indicators of Suspicious Mail
What Should Make Me Suspect a Piece of Mail?
It’s unexpected or from someone you don’t know.
It’s addressed to someone no longer at your address.
It’s handwritten and has no return address or bears one that 
you can’t conﬁ rm is legitimate.
It’s lopsided or lumpy in appearance.
It’s sealed with excessive amounts of tape.
It’s mailed with restrictive endorsements such as “Personal” 
or “Conﬁ dential.”
It has excessive postage.
What Should I Do with a Suspicious Piece of Mail?
Don’t handle a letter or package that you suspect is 
contaminated.
Don’t shake it, bump it or sniff it.
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Notify local law enforcement authorities.

632 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
Although admittedly somewhat of a “needle-in-a-hay-
stack approach,” the program, called Operation Nexus, 
has the potential to identify terrorists. Information 
from an al-Qaeda manual for terrorist operatives and 
debrieﬁ ngs of some of the group’s leaders and foot sol-
diers suggest that al-Qaeda has considered using scuba 
divers to blow up bridges, riding in tourist helicopters 
for surveillance, turning trucks and limousines into roll-
ing bombs and using special torches to cut the cables of 
the Brooklyn Bridge.
Terrorists might be hunted down using conﬁ den-
tial informant reward programs established by the 1984 
ACT. Th e PATRIOT Act amended the reward program by 
increasing the amount oﬀ ered to be paid an informant to 
$250,000.
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AS 
INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS
When terrorist attacked London’s transit system in 
2005, four homemade bombs stuﬀ ed into backpacks 
failed to fully explode. Only one person was injured. A 
day later, photographs of four suspects captured on sur-
veillance cameras near the sites of the attempted attacks 
were broadcast on television. Th e remarkable speed of 
that investigation was repeated on July 7, 2007. Brit-
ish investigators, aided by surveillance cameras, tracked 
the suspects to Glasgow, Scotland, and arrested several 
individuals: “Police oﬃ  cials credited the ‘Ring of Steel’—a 
network of thousands of surveillance cameras that line 
London’s intersections and neighborhoods—for pro-
viding license plate numbers, suspects’ image and other 
important clues” (Tanneeru, 2007). New York City, spe-
ciﬁ cally lower Manhattan, the site of the World Trade 
Center attacks, seeks to implement a similar system by 
2010 if the necessary funding can be secured. Th e Lower 
Manhattan Security Initiative will require about $90 mil-
lion to secure the 1.7 square miles, arguably one of the 
most valuable and sensitive pieces of real estate in the 
world (Tanneeru).
INFORMATION GATHERING 
AND INTELLIGENCE SHARING
An important distinction diﬀ erentiates informa-
tion and intelligence, with intelligence broad-
ening to become organized information: “Intelligence has 
come to mean information that has not only been selected 
and collected, but also analyzed, evaluated and distributed 
local inquiries. Local law enforcement oﬃ  cers can best 
serve the counter-terrorism eﬀ ort at this stage because 
the terrorists are out in public, watching us, studying 
our habits, discovering our vulnerabilities and report-
ing back to their handlers with prospective targeting 
data to begin the planning stage. Interestingly, a study 
of terrorist attack sites found that nearly half of the 
attackers lived within 30 miles of their selected target 
(Smith, 2008).
Th e second stage is planning, usually conducted 
behind closed doors. Th e average planning cycle for inter-
national terrorists is 92 days, compared with 14 days for 
environmental terrorists (Smith, 2008). Th e third stage 
is execution, the actual attack and possible escape. Often 
these attacks are carried out by a sleeper cell, a group of 
terrorists who blend into a community.
The three-tiered model of al-Qaeda terrorist attacks 
consists of sleeper cells attacking in conjunction with 
the group’s leaders in Afghanistan, sleeper cells attack-
ing on their own apart from centralized command and 
individuals attacking with support from small cells.
It is crucial that investigators identify members of 
sleeper cells within their community. Proﬁ ling, a useful 
tool in law enforcement for decades, is equally useful in 
these antiterrorism eﬀ orts in that the “typical” al-Qaeda 
terrorist is a young (20 to 30) Middle Eastern–appearing 
male of average height and weight with prominent facial 
hair and a foreign accent. However, the proﬁ le does not 
always ﬁ t, as many cell members are now being instructed 
to westernize their appearance by dressing to ﬁ t into main-
stream American society, shave their beards or otherwise 
disguise or downplay physical traits that may betray their 
true identity. 
Another approach to identifying potential terror-
ists is to use behavior pattern recognition (BPR) observ-
ing irregular behaviors for the environment as well as 
targeted conversations with suspects. Th e Transpor-
tation Security Administration (TSA) has trained 600 
screeners who patrol the three airports in the Washing-
ton area and look for signs of stress, fear and deception 
among airline passengers (Wilber and Nakashima, 2007, 
p.D01). Th ese screeners have referred more than 40,000 
people for extra screening since January 2006. Of those 
passengers, nearly 300 were arrested on charges includ-
ing carrying concealed weapons and drug traﬃ  cking.
Th e New York City Police Department is using a 
diﬀ erent tactic, having detectives visit scuba shops 
and hardware stores, talk to parking garage atten-
dants and plastic surgeons, hotel managers and tool 
rental companies, bulk fuel dealers and trade schools. 

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 633
process is used across all programs—Counterterrorism, 
Counterintelligence, Cyber and Criminal—to counter all 
threats” (Loyka et al., p.36).
Local and state law enforcement agencies are critical 
to the third step in the intelligence cycle and beneﬁ t from 
the sixth step as well. Many day-to-day duties of local 
law enforcement oﬃ  cers bring them into proximity with 
sources of information about terrorism. Patrol operations, 
especially traﬃ  c oﬃ  cers, properly trained in what to look 
for and what questions to ask when interacting with citi-
zens, can be a tremendous source of intelligence for their 
state and federal homeland security counterparts as well 
as for local investigators.
Th e diﬃ  cult tasks of counterterrorism and antiterror-
ism are made even harder by the operational style that per-
vades law enforcement—that of withholding, rather than 
sharing, intelligence. States lack a single point of contact 
for both receiving “downstream” information needs and 
pushing intelligence and other information “upstream.” 
to meet the unique policymaking needs of one particular 
enterprise” (Loyka et al., 2005, p.7). One way to conceptu-
alize the diﬀ erence is to think of information as raw data; 
once that data has been placed through various ﬁ lters, 
sieves and other analytical processes, the more meaning-
ful or useful bits of data that are extracted are referred to 
as intelligence.
Loyka et al. (2005, pp.35–36) describe the intelli-
gence cycle (Figure 20.9). Th e cycle begins with knowing 
the intelligence requirements needed for the investigation. 
What do investigators need to know to eﬀ ectively partici-
pate in homeland security? Th ese requirements are estab-
lished by the director of Central Intelligence under the 
guidance of the president and the national and homeland 
security advisors. Th e second step is planning and direction, 
a function of the FBI. Th e third step is collecting raw infor-
mation from local, state and federal investigations. Fourth 
is processing and exploiting the raw information, that is, 
converting the collected information into a form usable 
for analysis. Fifth is analysis and production, converting 
the raw information into intelligence. Th e ﬁ nal step is dis-
semination, which leads back to reﬁ nement of intelligence 
requirements: “Th e Intelligence Cycle is just that, a continu-
ing cycle, which overlaps and drives each of its functions 
and in turn, drives the investigative mission. Th is cycle or

Technology Innovations
An important information gathering innovation in 
the ﬁ ght against terrorism is known as the Dark Web:
At the end of a long hallway in a gray and cavern-
ous block at the University of Arizona in Tucson 
sits a closet-size room secured by complex access 
codes and bulletproof-glass windows. The room is 
chilled to a steady 60 degrees and crammed with 
rack-mounted monitors, blinking red lights, a squat 
supercomputer and three “spidering machines” 
that crawl through the Internet, quietly spooling 
data from the shadowy digital realm inhabited by 
terrorists, hackers and cybercriminals. Welcome to 
the Dark Web.
These machines store Web data from roughly 
1,500 terrorist and extremist organizations, includ-
ing 500 groups with roots in the Middle East, 
explains University of Arizona computer scientist 
Hsinchun Chen, who designed this digital sleuthing 
tool. Accessible only to those who pass ﬁ ngerprint-
ing and extensive background checks, the Dark 
Web project constitutes the largest collection of 
online terrorist data on the planet and may be key 
to cracking future plots. It is, literally and meta-
phorically, a portal to the underworld. (“The Future 
of Terrorism,” 2006, p.32) 

634 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
criminal activity. By raising cooperation and communica-
tion among local, state and federal partners to an unprec-
edented level, this eﬀ ort will strengthen the abilities 
of the justice community to detect threats and protect 
American lives and liberties.
CRUCIAL COLLABORATIONS 
AND PARTNERSHIPS
The importance of partnerships between law 
enforcement agencies at all levels cannot be 
overstated as it applies to the war on terrorism. Th e issue 
of eﬀ ective partnerships among local, state and federal 
law enforcement agencies has deserved attention for at 
least half a century; it now demands attention.
A key to combating terrorism lies with the local 
police and the intelligence they can provide to federal 
authorities.
Communication should be the number-one priority in 
any terrorist-preparedness plan and is number one in col-
laboration among local, state and federal law enforcement 
agencies. An extremely valuable resource for investigators 
is the Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) pro-
gram, which assists state and local agencies by sharing 
information and intelligence regarding terrorism.
Limitations on information sharing have caused ten-
sions in the past, as often information received by the 
FBI is classiﬁ ed. Rules of federal procedure and grand jury 
classiﬁ ed material are two other limitations to how much 
information can be shared. Since 9/11, more than 6,000 
state and local police oﬃ  cers have been granted access to 
classiﬁ ed material involving terrorist threats. Also to date, 
some 6,011 clearances have been authorized.
INITIATIVES TO ASSIST 
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST 
TERRORISM
Several initiatives have been undertaken to 
help in the ﬁ ght against terrorism. One such 
initiative is production of the FBI Intelligence Bulletin, a 
Gorman (2007) reports that state and local oﬃ  cials are 
protesting eﬀ orts by the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity to exclude them from a new unit designed to share 
information about possible terrorist threats to the coun-
try. According to Gorman, DHS oﬃ  cials are opposed to let-
ting representatives of state and local government serve 
on the unit that would send out the information because 
they believe it would confuse the process: “It is the latest 
example of the government’s failure to heed one of the 
most critical lessons of the Sept. 11 attacks: the inability 
or unwillingness of federal oﬃ  cials to share information 
with those at the state and local level who might be in a 
position to help stave oﬀ  a terrorist attack.” Th e direc-
tor of national intelligence (DNI), John Michael “Mike” 
McConnell, has criticized the DHS approach, saying the 
culture of intelligence agencies must change to appreciate 
the needs of police chiefs and their colleagues around the 
country: “Th is is a diﬀ erent age and a diﬀ erent time. . . . 
Th ere has to be a leap of faith to trust local oﬃ  cials with 
sensitive information” (Gorman, p.1A). A major step in 
improving the sharing of information is the appointment 
of a new assistant secretary in DHS to serve as a liaison 
between state and local law enforcement and DHS policy 
makers—an important position in the policy directorate 
(Bain, 2008).
Local networking modules developed among local, 
state and federal law enforcement agencies are the most 
eﬀ ective way to discuss and share investigative and 
enforcement endeavors to combat terrorism. Th is net-
working module approach avoids compromising exist-
ing investigations or conducting conﬂ icting cases and 
should have a built-in deconﬂ iction protocol, which 
essentially means guidelines to avoid conﬂ ict. Decon-
ﬂ iction can be applied to declassiﬁ ed and conﬁ dential 
investigations.
THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE 
SHARING PLAN
A subtitle of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, called 
the Homeland Security Information Sharing Act, required 
the president to develop new procedures for sharing 
classiﬁ ed information, as well as unclassiﬁ ed but other-
wise sensitive information, with state and local police. 
Th is charge was fulﬁ lled in May 2002 when the IACP, 
the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DHS and other 
representatives of the federal, state, tribal and local law 
enforcement communities endorsed the National Crimi-
nal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP). Th e NCISP unites 
law enforcement agencies of all sizes and geographic 
locations in a national eﬀ ort to prevent terrorism and 

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 635
current physical protection systems are against likely 
threats (Goldsmith, Weiss and Davis, 2004, p.100).
THE NATIONAL MEMORIAL INSTITUTE 
FOR THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM
Th e National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of 
Terrorism (MIPT) grew out of the desire of the survivors 
and families of the Murrah Federal Building bombing to 
have a living memorial in the form of an online, national 
network of best practices and lessons learned. Since 
2000, this nonpartisan, nonproﬁ t organization, located 
in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has amassed the largest 
national open source collection of documents on counter-
terrorism and functions as a terrorism prevention train-
ing center for police oﬃ  cers and other ﬁ rst responders, 
investigators and intelligence analysts from throughout 
the country. 
THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR 
FOOD PROTECTION AND DEFENSE
Th e mission of the National Center for Food Protec-
tion and Defense is to safeguard the security of the food 
system through research and education. Its goals are to 
reduce the vulnerability of the nation’s food system to ter-
rorist attack by contamination with biological, chemical 
weekly online publication containing information 
related to terrorism in the United States. Recipients 
include duly authorized members of all law enforcement 
agencies who have registered with a law enforcement 
network.
Another initiative that indirectly supports the ﬁ ght 
against terrorism is passage of the Community Protec-
tion Act.
The Community Protection Act gives off-duty as well as 
qualiﬁ ed retired police ofﬁ cers the right to carry their 
ﬁ rearms concealed in all 50 states.
Other initiatives include increased security at our 
borders; the Community Vulnerability Assessment Meth-
odology (C-VAM), the National Memorial Institute for the 
Prevention of Terrorism, the Center for Food Protection 
and Defense, the National Incident Management System 
and joint terrorism task forces.
INCREASED BORDER SECURITY
A program of the DHS called U.S. Visitor and Immigrant 
Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT), seeks to enhance 
the security of our citizens and visitors; facilitate legiti-
mate travel and trade; and ensure the integrity of our 
immigration system. Th e program requires visitors to 
submit to inkless ﬁ nger scans and digital photographs, 
allowing Customs and Border Protection (CBP) oﬃ  cers to 
determine whether the person applying for entry is the 
same one who was issued a visa by the State Department. 
Biometric and biographic data are also checked against 
watch lists of suspected foreign terrorists and data-
bases of sexual predators, criminals wanted by the FBI 
and people deported previously from the United States. 
Th e program was implemented in January 2005 and, as 
of January 2008, had been put into use at 116 airports 
and 15 seaports and in the secondary inspection areas of 
154 land ports of entry. 
COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT 
METHODOLOGY
Another tool available to law enforcement agencies across 
the country is C-VAM, a back-to-basics approach that 
identiﬁ es a community’s weaknesses by using a detailed 
and systematic analysis of the facilities and their relation-
ship to each other. Th is initiative examines a community 
as a whole to help departments focus resources and funds 
on the areas needing them most. It uses a performance-
based system to calculate how eﬀ ective a community’s

will keep U.S. borders open to travelers but closed to terrorists and 
other criminals. (© AP/Wide World Photos)

controversial issue leads to discussions about censorship 
in the war on terrorism. 
CONCERNS RELATED TO THE 
WAR ON TERRORISM
Two pressing concerns related to the so-called war on 
terrorism are that civil liberties may be jeopardized and 
that people of Middle Eastern descent may be discrimi-
nated against or become victims of hate crimes.
These two concerns were explored by Getlin 
(2005), who found that some of those he inter-
viewed saw the searches at New York City’s Penn Station as 
an intrusion on personal freedom, whereas other people 
wanted police to be able to openly focus on Muslim com-
muters. One city council member noted, “Th ere is a particu-
lar group who engages in these [terrorist] activities. Th ey’re 
not skinny balding Italian Americans from Staten Island.”
Th e ﬁ rst guiding principle of the DHS is to protect 
civil rights and civil liberties: “We will defend America 
while protecting the freedoms that deﬁ ne America. Our 
strategies and actions will be consistent with the indi-
vidual rights and liberties enshrined by our Constitu-
tion and the Rule of Law. While we seek to improve the 
way we collect and share information about terrorists, 
we will nevertheless be vigilant in respecting the conﬁ -
dentiality and protecting the privacy of our citizens. We 
are committed to securing our nation while protecting 
civil rights and civil liberties” (Securing Our Homeland, no 
date, p.6).
CONCERN FOR CIVIL RIGHTS
Civil libertarians are concerned that valued American 
freedoms will be sacriﬁ ced in the interest of national 
safety. For example, the Justice Department has issued 
a new regulation giving itself the authority to monitor 
inmate-attorney communications if “reasonable sus-
picion” exists that inmates are using such communica-
tions to further or facilitate acts of terrorism. However, 
criminal defense lawyers and members of the American 
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have protested the regu-
lation, saying that it eﬀ ectively eliminates the Sixth 
Amendment right to counsel because, under codes of 
professional responsibility, attorneys cannot commu-
nicate with clients if conﬁ dentiality is not ensured. Th e 
or radiological agents at any point along the food supply 
chain; to strengthen the food system’s preparedness and 
resiliency to threats, disruption and attacks; and to miti-
gate the potentially catastrophic public health and eco-
nomic eﬀ ects of food system attacks (National Center for 
Food Protection and Defense, 2008). Th is eﬀ ort is lead by 
the University of Minnesota.
THE NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM
Th e DHS in October 2003 created the Initial Response 
Plan (INRP), an interim plan designed to help develop 
a uniﬁ ed approach to domestic incident management 
across the nation. On March 1, 2004, Secretary Ridge 
announced the approval of the National Incident Man-
agement System (NIMS), the country’s ﬁ rst standardized 
management approach unifying federal, state and local 
governments for incident response. NIMS establishes 
standardized incident management processes, protocols 
and procedures that all responders—federal, state, tribal 
and local—will use to coordinate and conduct response 
action (“DHS Secretary Ridge,” 2004, p.14).
JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES
Th e FBI has a joint terrorism task force (JTTF) in each 
of its 56 ﬁ eld oﬃ  ces, as well as 10 stand-alone, formal-
ized JTTFs in its largest resident agencies. In an eﬀ ec-
tive JTTF, all investigators, whether FBI agents, other 
federal oﬃ  cers or state or local oﬃ  cers, are equal part-
ners. Every investigator is assigned substantive cases 
and works from established FBI protocols for investigat-
ing terrorism, completing paperwork requirements and 
using data systems.
THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN 
THE WAR ON TERRORISM
The Terrorism Research Center suggests, “Ter-
rorism and the media have a symbiotic rela-
tionship. Without the media, terrorists would receive no 
exposure, their cause would go ignored, and no climate of 
fear would be generated. Terrorism is futile without pub-
licity, and the media generates much of this publicity.” 
White (2006, p.342) raises the question of the contagion 
eﬀ ect; that is, coverage of terrorism inspires more terror-
ism, thus making terrorism, in eﬀ ect, contagious. Th is 

CHAPTER 20 | Terrorism and Homeland Security | 637
have a meaningful opportunity to oﬀ er evidence that he 
was not an enemy combatant.
In Rasul v. Bush (2004), the Supreme Court ruled that 
U.S. courts have jurisdiction to consider challenges to the 
legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured in 
Afghanistan in a military campaign against al-Qaeda and 
the Taliban regime that supported it. Th e petitioners, 
2 Australians and 12 Kuwaitis, were being held at Guan-
tánamo Bay, Cuba, without charges. Th ese and other legal 
issues regarding civil rights will be debated as the country 
seeks to balance the need for security with civil rights.
COMMUNITY POLICING AND 
HOMELAND SECURITY
Community policing is an important concept 
to adopt in eﬀ orts to prepare for and respond 
to acts of terrorism (Scheider, Chapman and Seelman, 
ACLU has vowed to monitor police actions closely to see 
that freedoms protected under the Constitution are not 
jeopardized. 
Th e government must preserve the rights and free-
doms guaranteed by America’s democracy, but, at the 
same time, ensure that the ﬁ ght against terrorism is vig-
orous and eﬀ ective. 
A difﬁ cult challenge facing law enforcement is 
balancing the need to enhance security with the 
need to maintain freedom.
RETALIATION OR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
PEOPLE OF MIDDLE EASTERN DESCENT
Another concern is that some Americans may retaliate 
against innocent people of Middle Eastern descent, many 
of whom were either born in the United States or are nat-
uralized citizens. Henderson et al. (2008) identiﬁ ed four 
signiﬁ cant obstacles to improved relations between police 
and Arab-Americas communities:
• • Distrust between Arab-American communities and 
law enforcement.
• • Lack of cultural awareness among law enforcement 
oﬃ  cers.
• • Language barriers.
• • Concerns about immigration status and fear of 
deportation.
Community policing eﬀ orts can do much to overcome 
these obstacles.
Closely related concerns are the rights of citi-
zens detained as enemy combatants and the rights of 
detained foreign nationals. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004) 
the Supreme Court ruled that a citizen detained in the 
United States as an enemy combatant must be aﬀ orded 
the opportunity to rebut such a designation. Petitioner 
Hamdi was captured in an active combat zone in Afghan-
istan following the September 11, 2001, attacks on 
the United States and surrendered an assault riﬂ e. Th e 
U.S. District Court found that the declaration from the 
Defense Department did not support Hamdi’s deten-
tion and ordered the government to turn over numer-
ous materials for review. Th e U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Fourth Circuit reversed the decision, stressing that 
because it was undisputed that Hamdi was captured in 
an active combat zone, no factual inquiry or evidentiary 
hearing allowing Hamdi to rebut the government’s asser-
tions was necessary. Th e U.S. Supreme Court voted 6 to 
3 to vacate and remand, concluding that Hamdi should

responders’ must see themselves in a more proactive role 
as ‘ﬁ rst preventers’” (Doherty and Hibbard, 2006, p.78). 
Several sources of information in the community include 
Neighborhood Watches, hotels, real estate agents, stor-
age facilities, religious groups, social and civic clubs, col-
leges and universities, print shops, business managers, 
transportation centers and tourist attractions major 
industrial enterprises, schools, oﬃ  ce building custo-
dians, health care providers, bar and liquor stores and 
inspectors and code enforcers (Doherty and Hibbard, 
pp.79–80).
A 2004 New York Times poll shows that although 
Americans are divided on their views of how prepared 
the United States is for another terrorist attack, most 
citizens have done nothing personally to prepare for such 
an attack. Oﬃ  cers engaged in community policing can 
do much to educate citizens in their jurisdictions on pre-
paredness plans, including setting a family meeting place 
in case of a terrorist attack.
no date, p.158). Oﬃ  cers in departments that fully 
embrace community policing will have an advantage in 
recognizing potential terrorist threats and targets in 
their jurisdictions because their daily work requires and 
imparts an intimate familiarity with their regularly 
assigned patrol area (p.160). Such oﬃ  cers interact with 
citizens and can educate them to be alert to suspicious 
activity. Homeland security depends on alert, aware, 
vigilant citizens. Information they provide oﬃ  cers on 
their beat can be invaluable to investigators: “In the 21st 
century, the community policing philosophy is well posi-
tioned to take a central role in preventing and respond-
ing to terrorism and in eﬀ orts to reduce citizen fear” 
(Scheider et al., p.162).
Vernon (2008, p.57) oﬀ ers these guidelines for depart-
ments wishing to mobilize their community in counterter-
rorism eﬀ orts:
 1. Establish a liaison with DHS.
 2. Formulate a policy statement that will guide commu-
nity mobilization eﬀ orts.
 3. Educate community members about the signiﬁ cant 
diﬀ erences between reporting sought-after informa-
tion (proper) and conducting covert investigations or 
other quasi-police actions (improper).

Terrorism
• • What method of attack was used?
• • What was the target of the attack?
• • Who had access to the location?
• • What was the likely motivation?
• • Has any group claimed responsibility?
• • What was the damage?
• • Were there injuries? fatalities?
• • Who notiﬁ ed authorities?
• • Who responded ﬁ rst?
• • Were there any witnesses?
• • Were any suspicious individuals or vehicles observed 
at the location before the attack? during the attack? 
after the attack?
• • Was the scene photographed or videotaped?
• • What evidence was found at the scene?
• • Were there any unusual circumstances?
• • Was a canvass of the area conducted?
Detective Smith has had a young Middle-Eastern appear-
ing male under surveillance as a suspected terrorist. She 
has followed him for several days and has observed him 
buy a newspaper from a machine every morning, walk to 
the state capitol building several times each day and take 
pictures from various angles, enter the building and come 
out shortly. He then returns to an inexpensive motel on 
the edge of town. He has visits from other Middle-Eastern 
appearing young males who bring him packages. He does 
not appear to be employed but wears expensive clothing 
and eats at expensive restaurants.
On this particular day, she sees that the suspect is 
carrying a briefcase, something he has not done before. 
He goes directly to the state capitol building and enters. 
Approximately one hour later, he comes out, but without 
the briefcase.
Questions
 1. Does Detective Smith have reasonable suspicion to 
stop the suspect and question him?
 2. If so, based on what?
 3. What should be the next step?
CHECKLIST
APPLICATION
Th e threat of terrorism has become a reality in America. 
Most deﬁ nitions of terrorism have common elements, 
including the systematic use of physical violence, either 
actual or threatened, against noncombatants to cre-
ate a climate of fear to cause some religious, political or 
social change. Most terrorist acts result from dissatisfac-
tion with a religious, political or social system or policy 
and frustration resulting from an inability to change it 
through acceptable, nonviolent means.
 
Th e FBI classiﬁ es terrorist acts as either domestic or 
international. Islamic terrorist groups include Hezbollah, 
HAMAS, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the al-Aqsa Mar-
tyrs’ Brigades, and al-Qaeda. Domestic terrorist groups 
include White supremacists, Black supremacists, militia 
groups, other right-wing extremists, left-wing extremists, 
pro-life extremists, animal rights extremists and environ-
mental extremists. Terrorists use arson, explosives and 
bombs, weapons of mass destruction (biological, chemical 
or nuclear agents) or technology.
 
Th e DHS was established as a result of 9/11, reorganiz-
ing the departments of the federal government. Th e FBI is 
the lead agency for responding to domestic terrorism. Th e 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the lead 
agency for consequence management (after an attack).
 
Th e USA PATRIOT Act signiﬁ cantly improves the 
nation’s counterterrorism eﬀ orts by
• • Allowing investigators to use the tools already 
available to investigate organized crime and drug 
traﬃ  cking.
• • Facilitating information sharing and cooperation 
among government agencies so they can better “con-
nect the dots.”
• • Updating the law to reﬂ ect new technologies and new 
threats.
• • Increasing the penalties for those who commit or sup-
port terrorist crimes.
 
Th e ﬁ rst line of defense against terrorism is the patrol 
oﬃ  cer in the ﬁ eld.
 
Th e three-tiered model of al-Qaeda terrorist attacks 
consists of sleeper cells attacking in conjunction with 
the group’s leaders in Afghanistan, sleeper cells attack-
ing on their own apart from centralized command and 
individuals attacking with support from small cells. A key 
to combating terrorism lies with the local police and the 
intelligence they can provide to federal authorities. Th e 
Community Protection Act gives oﬀ -duty as well as quali-
ﬁ ed retired police oﬃ  cers the right to carry their ﬁ rearms 
concealed in all 50 states.
 
Two pressing concerns related to the “war on terror-
ism” are that civil liberties may be jeopardized and that

Outline
fter all the leads in a case have been exhausted, all the witnesses 
 interviewed, all the suspects interrogated and all the evidence properly 
collected and stored, if the investigation has been successful, the case will be ready 
for prosecution. Before this can occur, however, a ﬁ nal report on the case must 
be written, establishing the elements of the crime and proving the corpus delicti. 
Oﬃ  cers and prosecutors must ensure that the evidence has not been contaminated, 
that the witnesses have not been corrupted and that the suspect’s constitutional 
rights have not been violated. With these assurances in place, the case can proceed
A

646 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
The most important rule to eradicate fear of testifying in 
court is to always tell the truth.
to court, where the investigator’s testimony is almost always 
critical to a successful outcome. Even the most experienced 
investigator may worry about having to testify, perhaps 
fearing the responsibility.
THE FINAL REPORT
The eﬀ ectiveness of the ﬁ nal report is often the 
determining factor in whether a case is prose-
cuted: “It’s not just skillful investigation that brings the 
bad guy to justice. . . . It’s the investigator’s ability to pre-
pare a report that can withstand minute scrutiny by 
judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, citizens and the 
media. Th e report’s ability to hold up under scrutiny may 
determine whether the guilty go free or justice is rendered 
to the victim” (Jetmore, 2008, p.26). Th e recommenda-
tions and guidelines presented in Chapter 3 apply to the 
ﬁ nal report as well. Th erefore, you might review that 
chapter.
 
Th e ﬁ nal report presents the facts of the case, a crimi-
nal history of the person charged, the types of evidence 
available and the names of those who can support such 
evidence by testimony in court, names of people the pros-
ecutor can talk to for further information and a chronolog-
ical account of the crime and subsequent investigation.
The ﬁ nal report contains (1) the complaint; (2) the prelimi-
nary investigation report; (3) all follow-up and progress 
reports; (4) statements, admissions and confessions; 
(5) laboratory reports; (6) photographs, sketches and 
drawings; and (7) a summary of all negative (exculpatory) 
evidence. The quality of the content and writing of the 
report inﬂ uences its credibility.
 
Prepare the report after a careful review of all infor-
mation. Organize the facts logically.
THE COMPLAINT
Include a copy of the original complaint received by the 
police dispatcher and complaint desk. Th is should include 
the date and time of the complaint, location of the inci-
dent, brief details, times when oﬃ  cers were dispatched 
and the names of the oﬃ  cers assigned to the initial call.
THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REPORT
Th e report of the oﬃ  cer’s initial investigation at the crime 
scene provides essential information about the time of 
arrival, lighting and weather conditions, observations at 
the scene and immediate and subsequent actions taken by 
oﬃ  cers responding to the call.
FOLLOW-UP REPORTS
Assemble each contact and follow-up report in chron-
ological order, presenting the sequence of the inves-
tigation and the pattern used to follow leads. These 
reports contain the essential information gathered in 
proving the elements of the crime and in linking the 
crime to the suspect. The reports can be in the form of 
progress notes.
STATEMENTS, ADMISSIONS 
AND CONFESSIONS
Include the statements of all witnesses interviewed dur-
ing the investigation, as discussed in Chapter 6. If writ-
ten statements were not obtained, report the results of 
oral interviews with witnesses. Assemble all statements, 
admissions or confessions by suspects in a separate part 
of the report. Include the reports of all polygraphs or other 
examinations used to determine the truth of statements, 
admissions or confessions.
LABORATORY REPORTS
Assemble laboratory results in one segment of the ﬁ nal 
report. Make recommendations regarding how these 
results relate to other areas of the report.
PHOTOGRAPHS, SKETCHES AND DRAWINGS
Include photographs, sketches and drawings of the crime 
scene to show conditions when oﬃ  cers arrived and the 
available evidence, as discussed in Chapter 2.

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 647
SUMMARY OF NEGATIVE EVIDENCE
Include a summary of all negative or exculpatory evidence 
developed during the investigation. Statements of wit-
nesses who claim the suspect was elsewhere at the time of 
the crime are sometimes proved false, but the prosecution 
must consider such statements and develop a defense. If 
information exists that the suspect committed the crime 
but did so in self-defense or accidentally, state this in 
the report. Include all recognizable weaknesses in proving 
the corpus delicti or the oﬀ ender’s identity.
 
Write the report clearly and accurately, following the 
guidelines presented in Chapter 3. Th e quality of the ﬁ nal 
report inﬂ uences its credibility. Arrange the material in 
a logical sequence and a convenient format. A binder or 
loose-leaf notebook works well for this because it allows 
the various units of information to be separated, with a 
labeled, tabbed divider for each unit. Although the pros-
ecutor may have been consulted at various stages of the 
investigation, at this point the prosecutor might oﬀ er a 
plea bargain to the defendant based on the strength of the 
case and of the ﬁ nal report. It has been said that some 
cases are, in eﬀ ect, trial by report.
THE ROLE OF THE PROSECUTOR
The prosecutor is the gatekeeper of the court 
system, determining which cases are prose-
cuted and which are not: “Th e prosecutor is of critical 
importance because of the oﬃ  ce’s central position in the 
criminal justice system. Whereas police, defense attor-
neys, judges and probation oﬃ  cers specialize in speciﬁ c 
phases of the criminal justice process, the duties of the 
prosecutor bridge all of these areas. Th is means that on a 
daily basis the prosecutor is the only oﬃ  cial who works 
with all actors of the criminal justice system. As Justice 
Robert Jackson once remarked, ‘Th e prosecutor has more 
control over life, liberty and reputation than any other 
person in America’” (Neubauer, 2005, p.126).
The prosecutor is the most powerful ofﬁ cial in the court 
system.
 
At the county level, the prosecutor, or district attor-
ney (DA), is the chief law enforcement oﬃ  cial. DAs may be 
appointed or elected and are responsible for prosecuting 
felonies and serious misdemeanors in the trial courts of 
general jurisdiction. At the federal level, the prosecutor is 
called the U.S. attorney, a position appointed by the presi-
dent, approved by Congress and conﬁ rmed by the Senate. 
Although prosecutors’ oﬃ  ces at the local level generally 
do not have in-house investigators, federal prosecutors’ 
oﬃ  ces commonly have staﬀ  investigators and are in fre-
quent contact with other federal investigative agencies, 
such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA), Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and U.S. Secret 
Service. Also, unlike local prosecutors, federal prosecutors 
are typically those who initiate a federal criminal investi-
gation, whereas by the time a case comes to a local prose-
cutor or DA, the investigation has already been completed 
by local law enforcement.
 
According to Neubauer (2005, p.126), “A key charac-
teristic of the American prosecutor is broad discretion.” 
The various actors in a trial often have conflicting views 
about how this discretion should be used: “The police 
push for harsher penalties, defense attorneys for giv-
ing their clients a break and judges to clear the docket” 
(Neubauer, p.126). In addition, although the prosecu-
tor tries cases in the court, the office is part of the 
executive branch of government, independent from the 
judiciary. This independence is crucial for the adversary 
system to function because prosecutors often challenge 
judicial decisions. The adversary system is discussed 
later in the chapter.
 
Tensions and conﬂ icts sometimes exist between 
investigators and prosecutors. An investigator may feel 
a case is strong and the suspect should be brought to 
trial, but the prosecutor may disagree. In these cases, 
oﬃ  cers must remain cognizant of the varying stan-
dards of proof at work when considering legal arrests 
and prosecutable oﬀ enses. Crime-charging gaps may 
occur when the prosecutor thinks a reduced charge is 
more likely to obtain a conviction than is the charge the 
defendant was originally arrested on. Although oﬃ  cers 
can arrest based on probable cause, prosecutors are held 
to a much higher standard—proof beyond a reasonable 
doubt—in the courtroom: “Unless it appears that this 
higher burden of proof can be met, criminal proceedings 
cannot ethically be commenced. Sometimes, therefore 
the charging gaps result from the simple fact that the 
quantity and quality of evidence that may be more than 
enough to constitute probable cause nevertheless falls 
short of what would be needed to establish guilt at trial” 
(Rutledge, 2008, p.70).
 
Keep in mind the prosecutor is an investigator’s legal 
adviser throughout the process—during the investiga-
tion, the pretrial conference and the court presentation. 
It is ultimately the prosecutor’s decision. Investigators 
should follow prosecutors’ advice even if they disagree, for 
it is best to work out the issues of cases together. Investi-
gators should listen to and learn from prosecutors. Th ere 
may be valid reasons for not prosecuting a case.

648 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
the issue raised in the motion. Hearings are typically 
less formal and shorter than a full trial. Motions can be 
ﬁ led before, during or after trial, but one type of pretrial 
motion investigators should be aware of is the motion to 
suppress. If the defense ﬁ les such a motion, claiming that 
evidence was illegally obtained or a confession uncon-
stitutionally extracted, and an evidentiary hearing is 
granted by the court, the possibility exists for the case to 
fold before ever going to trial, eﬀ ectively resulting in non-
prosecution. If the court ruling is favorable to the defense 
and the evidence is excluded from trial, the prosecution 
has the option to appeal the court’s decision, generally the 
only point in the judicial process when such an appeal by 
the state is allowed.
 
If no motions have been submitted to court and the 
prosecutor decides to bring the case to trial, the investiga-
tor must thoroughly prepare for testifying in court.
PREPARING A CASE FOR 
PROSECUTION
Once the decision is made to prosecute a case, 
more than “probable cause” is required. Th e 
prosecution must prove the case beyond a reasonable 
doubt—the degree of proof necessary to obtain a convic-
tion. To do so, the prosecution must know what evidence 
it can introduce, what witnesses will testify, the strengths 
and weaknesses of the case and the type of testimony 
police investigators can supply.
To prepare a case for court,
• • Review and evaluate all evidence, positive and 
negative, and the chain of custody.
• • Review all reports on the case, including transcripts 
of any depositions you have given.
• • Prepare witnesses.
• • Write the ﬁ nal report.
• • Hold a pretrial conference with the prosecutor.
REVIEW AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE
Each crime consists of one or more elements that must 
be proven. Th e statutes and ordinances of the particular 
jurisdiction deﬁ ne these elements.
Concentrate on proving the elements of the crime and 
establishing the offender’s identity.
NONPROSECUTION
For many possible reasons, most criminal cases are 
resolved without a trial. An excellent investigation and 
report may cause the defendant to plead guilty, the defen-
dant may desire to plead guilty without going through a 
trial, or the plea-bargaining process may bring about a sat-
isfactory resolution.
Cases are not prosecuted if
• • The complaint is invalid.
• • The prosecutor declines after reviewing the case.
• • The complainant refuses to prosecute.
• • The offender dies.
• • The offender is in prison or out of the country and 
cannot be returned.
• • No evidence or leads exist.
 
Administrative policy sometimes closes cases to fur-
ther investigation. Speciﬁ c criteria are established for 
these decisions. Th e caseload of investigative personnel 
has grown so large that cases with little probability of suc-
cessful prosecution must be closed as a matter of main-
taining priorities.
 
Many police departments have incorporated such 
criteria into their crime report forms. If enough criteria 
are met, the department closes the case to further inves-
tigation and notiﬁ es the complainant. Th is often hap-
pens when complainants ﬁ le reports only because their 
insurance companies require them to report the loss to 
police. Th e loss may have occurred many days before 
the report, or there may be no leads. In some cases, 
there are insuﬃ  cient facts to support the complaint, but 
the victim insists on ﬁ ling a complaint and has the right 
to do so.
 
In other cases, the report is valid but investiga-
tion reveals that witnesses have left the area or that no 
physical evidence remains at the crime scene. Without 
physical evidence, witnesses, identiﬁ able leads or infor-
mation to follow up, it is unwise to pursue the case when 
more pressing cases abound. Such a case is placed in an 
inactive ﬁ le and is reopened only if time is available or 
new information is received. Occasionally, such cases 
are cleared by the admission or confession of a suspect 
arrested for another crime. Cases are exceptionally 
cleared when circumstances outside the investigation 
result in no charges being ﬁ led—for example, the sus-
pect dies. 
Motion Hearings A motion is a request to the court 
for a decision on a speciﬁ c legal issue. A motion can lead 
to a hearing, an appearance before the court to resolve 

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 649
favorable to the accused upon request violates due pro-
cess where the evidence is material either to guilt or to 
punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of 
the prosecution.” As Gardner and Anderson (2004, p.28) 
noted, “Although an accused does not have a right to all 
information available to the prosecutor, he does have the 
right to information as provided by the statutes of the 
state and to information required under the Brady rule.” 
As discussed in Chapter 1, exculpatory evidence, that is, 
evidence that tends to show innocence of the accused, 
must be disclosed. Investigators who are aware of such 
evidence are obligated to bring it to the prosecutor’s 
attention. When oﬃ  cers intentionally withhold exculpa-
tory material from the prosecution, they leave themselves 
open to personal liability for violating a defendant’s due 
process rights.
 
In most states, “missing” evidence or failing to turn 
over evidence violates the Brady rule only if it can be 
shown it was done in bad faith; that is, it was known the 
evidence was exculpatory and was intentionally with-
held (Gardner and Anderson, 2004, p.30). Th e defense 
must prove a “conscious eﬀ ort” to suppress exculpatory 
evidence.
 
Th e Supreme Court has held that due process requires 
the government to disclose information regarding witness 
credibility before trial, extending Brady to impeachment 
material in Giglio v. United States (1972). Defense attor-
neys will try to impeach the testimony of prosecution 
witnesses; that is, they will try to discredit the testimony, 
 
Review physical evidence to ensure that it has been 
properly gathered, identiﬁ ed, transported and safeguarded 
between the time it was obtained and the time of the trial. 
Make sure the evidence is available for the trial and is 
taken to the courtroom and turned over to the prosecut-
ing attorney. Arrange for trained laboratory technicians’ 
testimony if necessary. As discussed in detail in Chapter 5, 
select evidence that is material, relevant and competent 
and that helps establish the corpus delicti: what happened 
and who is responsible. How evidence is moved along in 
the system is shown in Figure 21.1.
 
Th e pretrial discovery process requires the prosecu-
tion and defense to disclose to each other certain evidence 
they intend to use at trial, thus avoiding surprises. Th ere 
is no general constitutional right to discovery in criminal 
trials (Weatherford v. Bursey, 1977). Courts have expressed 
concern that requiring too much prosecutorial disclosure 
might put the prosecution at a disadvantage or that wit-
nesses for the defense might be intimidated (Neubauer, 
2005, p.263). Th e type of information that is discoverable 
varies greatly from state to state, with some states allow-
ing only limited discovery, others taking a middle ground 
and yet others adopting liberal discovery rules. Moore 
(2005, p.78) cautions, “Any evidence not properly docu-
mented and available during discovery can run a risk of 
being excluded when the case goes to trial.”
 
Th e landmark Supreme Court case in the discovery 
process is Brady v. Maryland (1963), in which the Court 
held, “Th e suppression by the prosecution of evidence

via transcript and under oath well before you get to trial.” 
Nyberg (2006, p.20) says about the deposition, “Th is is 
where the defense attorney in a big case starts licking his 
chops, because one of his objectives is to collect sworn 
statements from witnesses—like you—who have not pre-
pared.” Grossi (p.32) refers to depositions as “ﬁ shing expe-
ditions” and cautions oﬃ  cers that the rules of deposition 
diﬀ er from those of trials: “Put simply, you must answer 
just about every question asked of you, regardless of how 
probing, embarrassing or insigniﬁ cant it may seem.” Th e 
defense counsel will likely dig deep into your professional 
background and work history, including formal education 
and law enforcement training, and may venture into your 
personal life. In addition to assessing the content of your 
responses, the plaintiﬀ ’s attorney is seeking to evaluate 
what type of witness you’ll be if the case goes to trial: “Do 
you have a tendency to become argumentative? Are you 
quick to anger? What’s your demeanor? Do you have any 
quirks that might cause a jury to question your truth-
fulness? Do you sweat profusely? . . . If you come across 
during the deposition as a strong, believable and credible 
witness, they’ll probably get you on and oﬀ  the witness 
stand as quickly as possible. On the other hand, if your 
weaknesses outweigh your strengths as a witness, expect 
to be ‘in the box’ a long time” (Grossi, p.34).
REVIEW REPORTS
Review written reports of everything done during the 
investigation. Th is includes the preliminary report, mem-
orandums, summary reports, progress reports, evidence 
records and receipts, photographs and sketches, medical 
examiner’s reports, emergency squad records, laboratory 
test reports on evidence, statements of witnesses (posi-
tive and negative) and any other reports on actions taken 
during the investigation. Th is also includes the transcript 
of your own deposition:
Th e deposition gets typed up and, if you’re like most 
cops, you never read it, though you are entitled to. You 
can bet your next paycheck that the defense attorney 
has not only read it, but has gone through it with a 
ﬁ ne tooth comb, compared it to your report, to witness 
statements, to other oﬃ  cers’ reports, and to case evi-
dence to try to ﬁ nd inconsistencies.
 
Th e defense attorney will no doubt have his copy 
all marked up and ready for attack at the table for 
trial. He’s banking on the high probability that you 
still haven’t suﬃ  ciently studied the deposition and 
that you’ll say something contrary to what you said 
before, which can sometimes be a year or more ago. Do 
yourself and the prosecution a favor by making sure to 
review the deposition so you don’t make any uninten-
tional missteps during the trial. (Nyberg, 2006, p.20)
to challenge the truth or accuracy of what a prosecution 
witness testiﬁ ed to under direct examination. Th is applies 
to police oﬃ  cers and investigators who testify.
 
In 1996, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued 
a policy for all DOJ investigative agencies obligating each 
of their employees to inform prosecutors of potential 
impeachment material as early as possible before pro-
viding a sworn statement or testimony in any criminal 
investigation. Th e DOJ guidelines suggest that the follow-
ing must be disclosed: substantiated allegations; pending 
investigations or allegations; and criminal charges, past or 
pending.
 
Th ere are limits on what the defense is entitled to 
learn about law enforcement witnesses. In Pennsylvania 
v. Ritchie (1987), the Supreme Court held, “Evidence is 
material only if there is a reasonable probability that had 
the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the 
proceeding would have been diﬀ erent. . . . Th e government 
has the obligation to turn over evidence in its possession 
that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt 
or punishment.” Th e issue of credibility also applies to 
witnesses other than those of law enforcement who may 
testify for the prosecution.
 
Review and evaluate witnesses’ statements for cred-
ibility. If a witness claims to have seen a specific act, 
determine whether the light was suﬃ  cient and whether 
the witness has good eyesight and was in a position to 
see the act clearly. Also assess the witness’s relationship 
to the suspect and the victim.
 
Establish the suspect’s identity by eyewitness testi-
mony, transfer evidence and supporting evidence such as 
motive, prior knowledge, opportunity and known modus 
operandi.
 
Videotapes are being used increasingly in court, espe-
cially in child abuse and sex crime cases. Expert witnesses 
with heavy time commitments may be allowed to testify 
by videotape, saving the time and expense of a trip to the 
city where the trial is taking place. Videotapes have also 
been made of witnesses who are severely injured and can-
not appear in court. In addition, videotapes of suspects’ 
confessions and of crime scenes are invaluable.
 
Reviewing every aspect of the case before entering 
the courtroom is excellent preparation for testifying. 
Do not memorize answers to imagined questions, but be 
prepared.
Depositions In many states, oﬃ  cers must provide a 
deposition before trial as part of the discovery. Testifying 
at a “depo” can be particularly stressful for the unprepared 
oﬃ  cer and, consequently, quite damaging to the prosecu-
tion. As Grossi (2007, p.32) asserts, “In some ways depo-
sitions are more critical than the actual trial. Plaintiﬀ ’s 
counsel will try to lock you into your version of the facts 

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 651
PREPARE WITNESSES
Reinterview witnesses to refresh their memories. Read 
their previous statements to them and ask if this is the 
evidence they will present in court. Such a review also 
helps allay any fears witnesses have about testifying. 
Describe trial procedures to witnesses so they understand 
what will occur. Explain that they can testify only to facts 
from their own personal knowledge or from common 
knowledge. Emphasize that they must tell the truth and 
present the facts as they know them. Explain the impor-
tance of remaining calm; having a neat, clean appearance; 
and remaining impartial.
 
By experience, police oﬃ  cers know of the many delays 
in court proceedings and of the waits in the courtroom 
or in the hall outside before they can testify. Th is should 
also be explained to witnesses who may be testifying for 
the ﬁ rst time so they can make ﬂ exible arrangements for 
the day. In addition, complainants should be prepared 
for the possible delays and continuances that may be part 
of the defense’s strategy to wear them down so they will 
drop the charges.
PRETRIAL CONFERENCE
Before testifying in court and after you have made the ﬁ nal 
case preparation, arrange for a pretrial conference with 
the prosecuting attorney. Organize the facts and evidence 
and prepare a summary of the investigation. Include in 
this summary the focal points and main issues of the case, 
an envelope containing copies of all reports and all other 
relevant documents.
At the pretrial conference with the prosecutor,
• • Review all the evidence.
• • Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the case.
• • Discuss the probable line of questioning by the 
prosecutor and the defense.
 
Discuss complicated or detailed information fully to 
avoid misunderstanding. Discuss any legal questions con-
cerning admissibility of evidence or testimony. Th e pros-
ecutor may be able to oﬀ er insights into the style of the 
defense attorney as well as the judge hearing the case.
 
Sometimes witnesses are included in the pretrial con-
ference. If so, listen carefully to what each witness says 
to the prosecuting attorney and to what the prosecuting 
attorney says in response. During the trial, the judge may 
exclude all witnesses from the courtroom except the per-
son testifying. Th erefore, you may have no opportunity 
to hear the testimony of other witnesses or the approach 
used by the prosecuting attorney.
An important step in preparing a case for prosecution is to 
reinterview witnesses to refresh their memories. Ofﬁ cers should 
read the witnesses’ previous statements to them and ask if this is 
the evidence they will present in court. This review helps alleviate 
fears witnesses have about testifying in court.
Victims and witnesses may also have the opportunity to 
speak to the court during the sentencing phase of a trial, should 
a conviction occur. Statements made during this stage are often 
emotionally charged and intended to provide the court with insight 
about the impact of the crime on the victim(s) or witness(es). 
Preparation is also important in making the most of these 
“statement of opinion” opportunities.
Brendan Costin, shown here speaking at the sentencing trial of 
Thomas Junta, the man found guilty of beating Brendan’s father to 
death at the boy’s hockey practice, is noticeably choked up as he 
states, “I can still remember being hysterical, trying to wake him up 
as the blood streamed down his face. Rushed to the hospital in the 
ambulance, my father had stopped breathing and had no pulse and 
his heart stopped beating. After two days in the hospital I realized I 
had just witnessed my dad literally getting beaten to death.”
The 6-foot-1, 270-pound Junta was convicted of involuntary 
manslaughter for beating 160-pound Michael Costin to death at a 
Reading, Massachusetts, ice rink in 2000, after Junta got angry over 
rough play on the ice. Junta testiﬁ ed that he struck Costin only in 
self-defense. Others said Junta was red-faced with rage.
After hearing both sides, the judge determined there were 
aggravating circumstances surrounding Costin’s death, including the 
fact that the beating took place in front of children. (© Reuters/CORBIS)
 
It is also a good idea to review the case with other oﬃ  -
cers who are going to testify. You may not hear their actual 
testimony, and it will help you if you know in advance 
what they are going to say.
FINAL PREPARATIONS
Shortly before the trial, again review your notes and your 
ﬁ nal report. Take with you only those notes you want to 
use in testifying. Be certain the physical evidence is being 

652 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
without special permission. If one is worn, it should not 
be visible. Do not wear dark or deeply tinted glasses. If 
you wear street clothes, dress conservatively. Avoid bright 
colors and large plaids. Do not overdo on accessories, and 
avoid bizarre haircuts. Your personal appearance reﬂ ects 
your attitude and your professionalism and will have a 
deﬁ nite eﬀ ect on the jury.
Be on Time If you are delayed for any reason, phone 
the prosecutor or the court clerk, explain the reason, and 
give an approximate time when you can be expected to 
appear.
THE TRIAL
Trials occur within a construct called the adver-
sary system, which establishes clearly deﬁ ned 
roles for both the prosecution and the defense and sets 
the judge as the neutral party. Th is has important implica-
tions for the investigator, who is on the “side” of the pros-
ecutor in the proceeding, as will be discussed shortly. Th e 
main participants in a trial are the judge, jury, attorneys, 
defendant and witnesses (Figure 21.2).
 
Th e judge, or magistrate, presides over the trial; deter-
mines whether a witness is qualiﬁ ed and competent; 
addresses questions of law, including motions, objections 
and procedures; rules on the admissibility of evidence; 
keeps order; interprets the law for the jurors; and passes 
sentence if the defendant is found guilty.
 
Th e jurors hear and evaluate the testimony of all wit-
nesses. Called fact ﬁ nders, jurors consider many factors 
other than the words spoken. Th e attitude and behavior 
of witnesses, suspects and attorneys are constantly under 
the jury’s scrutiny. Jurors notice how witnesses respond 
to questions and their attitudes toward the prosecution 
and the defense. Jurors reach their verdict based on what 
they see, hear and feel during the trial. Typical jurors will 
have had limited or no experience with the criminal jus-
tice system outside of what they have read in the newspa-
per and seen on television.
 
Legal counsel presents the prosecution and defense 
evidence before the court and jury. Lawyers act as 
checks against each other and present the case as 
required by court procedure and the rulings of the pre-
siding judge.
 
Defendants may or may not take the witness stand. 
Th e Fifth Amendment protects defendants against self-
incrimination. If a defendant chooses not to testify, this 
fact cannot be used against him or her. However, if a 
defendant does choose to testify, waiving the privilege 
taken to the courtroom and will be available for the pros-
ecuting attorney when needed. Also make sure that labo-
ratory technicians are available to appear when necessary. 
Find out which courtroom you will be testifying in and 
look it over before the trial.
 
If you are asked to bring physical evidence with you 
to the trial, use an appropriate container to prevent 
passersby from seeing it: “If you have a bloody shirt or 
a sawed-oﬀ  shotgun across your lap in the waiting area 
or the courthouse snack shop, potential jurors might be 
exposed to it before it’s introduced in evidence. (And if 
the judge excludes the evidence, the prejudice has already 
been created.)” (Rutledge, 2004, p.71).
Know What Is Expected and the Rules of the Court 
When an oﬃ  cer receives a subpoena, an order to appear 
before the court, it may not indicate what kind of hear-
ing it is. It might be a grand jury or a preliminary hear-
ing or a criminal trial. Th e rules of evidence are diﬀ erent, 
as is the burden of proof required. If the subpoena does 
not specify the type of hearing, call the prosecutor or the 
attorney who sent the subpoena to determine the nature 
of the hearing.
 
Th e subpoena will also usually indicate whether the 
oﬃ  cer is to make a personal appearance or be on call, 
meaning the oﬃ  cer need not appear personally unless 
called by the prosecution. On-call oﬃ  cers should provide 
the prosecutor or county clerk with a phone or pager num-
ber where he or she can be reached and should be available 
to receive the call and respond within a relatively short 
time.
 
Witnesses usually are excluded from the courtroom 
during a trial to prevent one witness from hearing 
another witness’s testimony. This is known as the rule 
on witnesses or witness sequestration rule. Find 
out before going into the courtroom whether witnesses 
have been excluded. If they have and an investigator 
goes into the courtroom and sits, the investigator may 
be severely reprimanded or, worse, be the cause for a 
mistrial.
 
Be familiar with any pretrial rulings a judge has issued. 
In some instances, a judge may have issued a motion in 
limine, a motion requesting the judge to issue a protec-
tive order against prejudicial questions or statements. For 
example, a defense attorney may ask a judge to restrict 
any reference to his client’s criminal record during the 
trial. An investigator who is unaware of this motion and 
violates it may cause the judge to order a mistrial.
Dress Appropriately Most police departments have 
regulations regarding attire when oﬃ  cers appear in court. 
Some departments specify that oﬃ  cers should appear in 
uniform. A weapon may not be worn into the courtroom 

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 653
or aﬃ  rmation in the presence of the fact ﬁ nder and the 
accused, subject to cross-examination and subject to pos-
sible perjury charges for failure to tell the truth” (Gardner 
and Anderson, 2004, p.93).
 
Police oﬃ  cers are witnesses for the prosecution. 
Law enforcement witnesses present a challenge to the 
prosecution’s case because the prosecuting attorney 
must establish the burden of proof beyond a reasonable 
doubt.
SEQUENCE OF A CRIMINAL 
TRIAL
A  trial begins with a case being called from the 
court docket. If both the prosecution and the 
defense are ready, the case is presented before the court.
against self-incrimination, that defendant cannot tell 
only a part of the story. If a defendant testiﬁ es, the 
state can ask questions about all the facts surrounding 
the event testiﬁ ed to. In addition, once the defendant 
takes the stand, the state can impeach the defendant’s 
credibility by introducing any prior felony convictions: 
“Th e defense attorney must make the diﬃ  cult decision 
whether to arouse the jury’s suspicion by not letting 
the accused testify or [let] the defendant testify and 
be subjected to possibly damaging cross-examination” 
(Neubauer, 2005, p.329).
 
Witnesses present the facts as they know them: “To 
qualify as a witness, a person must have relevant informa-
tion, must be competent and must declare that he or she 
will testify truthfully. To be competent, a witness must be 
able to remember and tell what happened, must be able 
to distinguish fact from fantasy and must know that he 
or she must tell the truth. . . . Anglo-Saxon law seeks to 
keep witnesses honest by having them testify under oath 
The trial judge: 
    –presides over the courtroom 
    –determines questions of law 
    –if no jury, determines questions of fact 
    –safegaurds “both the rights of accused 
      and the interests of the public . . . ” 
In a trial by jury, the jury: 
    –alone, determines weight to be given to 
      evidence 
    –alone, determines issues of fact including 
      guilt or innocence

The defense lawyer is an adversary

knowledge of how to go about obtaining them. It 
does not occur to most people sitting on juror 
panels that this could be a problem. However, 
jurors sitting on criminal cases where defendants 
are potentially dangerous or retaliatory should 
have some concerns for their families and 
themselves. 
      Trial courts can restrict the disclosure of juror 
information if the court determines that jurors are 
in need of protection. Courts have held that 
factors that could justify restricting jury information 
could include “. . . but are not limited to: (1) the 
defendant’s involvement in organized crime; (2) 
the defendant’s participation in a group with the 
capacity to harm jurors; (3) the defendant’s past 
attempts to interfere with the judicial process; and 
(4) extensive publicity that could enhance the 
possibility that jurors’ names would become public 
and expose them to intimidation or harassment.”

Cir. 1995); United States v. Ross, 33 F3d at 1520.

Th e judge instructs the jury on the laws applicable to 
the case and on how they are to arrive at a decision. Th e 
jury then retires to the jury room to deliberate and arrive 
at a verdict. When the jury reaches a verdict, court is recon-
vened and the verdict is read. If the verdict is for acquittal, 
the defendant is released. If the verdict is guilty, the judge 
passes sentence or sets a time and date for sentencing.
WHILE WAITING TO TESTIFY
Do not discuss the case while waiting in the hall-
way to testify. If a juror or another witness 
hears your statements, you may have created grounds for a 
mistrial. According to Rutledge (2004, p.72), “Perhaps the 
thing that’s most likely to torpedo your case in the middle 
of trial is unauthorized communication with members of 
the jury.” He acknowledges that it is not possible to avoid 
all contact with jurors and that chance contacts—passing 
in the hall or crowded in an elevator—may not be avoid-
able. In such instances, de minimus communication, 
that is, a simple hello or giving of directions, is allowable. It 
is important not to appear aloof or unfriendly.
TESTIFYING UNDER DIRECT 
EXAMINATION
Rutledge (2000, p.15) asserts, “No matter how 
brilliant the investigation, how careful the 
arrest, and how thorough the report, if an oﬃ  cer isn’t just 
as competent on the stand as he is in the ﬁ eld, he is just 
processing bodies.” He (p.12) stresses, “You are on trial, 
too—your credibility, your professionalism, your knowl-
edge, your competence, your judgment, your conduct in 
the ﬁ eld, your use of force, your adherence to oﬃ  cial poli-
cies, your observance of the defendant’s rights—they’re 
all on trial.”
 
As you enter the courtroom, keep in mind your goal. It 
is probably in line with the thinking of Van Brocklin (2005, 
p.48): “Th e goal for oﬃ  cers in their courtroom confronta-
tions is the same as in their street confrontations—win.” 
But, surprisingly, Van Brocklin (p.44) does not mean win 
the case: “Th e ‘win’ for every honest oﬃ  cer in every court-
room confrontation is as simple as it is diﬃ  cult: at the 
end of their testimony, when the last question has been 
answered, the jury must ﬁ nd them credible. Credibility 
is the degree to which the jury believes a witness. Th at’s 
it. Th at’s the only goal, the only win, the only job for the 
testifying oﬃ  cer—to be believed by the jury.”
The sequence in a criminal trial is as follows:
• • Jury selection
• • Opening statements by the prosecution and the 
defense
• • Presentation of the prosecution’s case; cross-
examination by the defense
• • Presentation of the defense’s case; cross-
examination by the prosecution
• • Rebuttal and surrebuttal testimony
• • Closing statements by the prosecution and the 
defense
• • Instructions to the jury
• • Jury deliberation to reach a verdict
• • Reading of the verdict
• • Acquittal or passing of sentence
 
If the trial is before a judge without a jury, called a 
bench trial, the prosecution and the defense make their 
opening statements directly to the judge. Th e opening 
statements are brief summaries of both the prosecution 
and defense attorneys’ plans. In a jury trial, the jury is 
selected and then both counsels make their opening state-
ments before the judge and jury.
 
Th e prosecution presents its case ﬁ rst. Witnesses for 
the prosecution are sworn in, and the prosecuting attor-
ney asks them questions. Th en the defense attorney may 
cross-examine the witnesses. After this cross-examination, 
the prosecuting attorney may redirect-examine, and then 
the defense attorney may re-cross-examine.
 
Direct examination is the initial questioning of 
a witness or defendant by the lawyer who is using the 
person’s testimony to further his or her case. Cross-
examination is questioning by the opposing side to 
assess the validity of the testimony.
 
After the prosecutor has completed direct examination 
of all prosecution witnesses, the defense presents its case. 
After the direct examination of each defense witness, the 
prosecutor may cross-examine, the defense counsel may 
redirect-examine, and the prosecutor may re-cross-examine.
 
After each side has presented its regular witnesses, 
both sides may present rebuttal and surrebuttal witnesses. 
Th e prosecution can call rebuttal witnesses to contradict 
the testimony (or evidence) presented by the defense. 
Th e defense, in turn, can call surrebuttal witnesses to 
contradict the testimony (or evidence) presented by the 
prosecution. When the entire case has been presented, 
prosecution and defense counsel present their clos-
ing arguments. In these arguments, the lawyers review 
the trial evidence of both sides and tell the jury why the 
defendant should be convicted or acquitted. Sometimes 
the lawyers also make recommendations for penalty.

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 655
 
Testify only to what you actually saw, heard or did, not 
what you believe, heard from others, or were told about. 
You can testify to what a defendant told you directly, but 
any other statements must be testiﬁ ed to by the person 
making them.
 
Preparation is the key to being a good witness. After 
a review of your personal notes and all relevant reports, 
you will be familiar with the case and can “tell it like it is.” 
Th is will come across well to the jury and establish your 
credibility.
Guidelines for effective testimony are
• • Speak clearly, ﬁ rmly and with expression.
• • Answer questions directly. Do not  volunteer 
information.
• • Pause brieﬂ y before answering.
• • Refer to your notes if you do not recall exact 
details.
• • Admit calmly when you do not know an answer.
• • Admit any mistakes you make in testifying.
• • Avoid police jargon, sarcasm and humor.
• • Tell the complete truth as you know it.
 
How you speak is often as important as what you 
say. Talk slowly, deliberately and loudly enough to be 
heard by everyone. Never use obscenity or vulgarity 
unless the court requests a suspect’s or victim’s exact 
words. In such cases, inform the court before you 
answer that the answer requested includes obscenity 
or vulgarity.
 
Ignore the courtroom’s atmosphere. Devote your 
entire attention to giving truthful answers to questions. 
Answer all questions directly and politely with “yes” or 
“no” unless asked to relate an action taken, an observation 
made or information told to you directly by the defendant. 
Refer to the judge as “your honor” and to the defendant as 
“the defendant.” Do not volunteer information. Instead, 
let the prosecution decide whether to pursue a particular 
line of questioning.
 
Take a few seconds after hearing the question to form 
your answer. If the counsel or the court objects to a ques-
tion, wait until instructed to proceed. If it takes some 
time for the judge to rule on an objection, ask to have the 
question repeated.
 
Reviewing the case thoroughly before your courtroom 
appearance does not mean that you should memorize 
speciﬁ c dates, addresses or spellings of names and places. 
Memorization can lead to confusion. Instead, use notes to 
help avoid contradictions and inconsistencies. An extem-
poraneous answer is better received by the judge and jury 
than one that sounds rehearsed.
The “win” for an investigator who testiﬁ es is to have 
established credibility.
 
First impressions are critical. Know what you are 
doing when you enter the courtroom. When your name 
is called, answer “Here” or “Present” and move directly 
to the front of the courtroom. Do not walk between the 
prosecutor and the judge; go behind the attorneys. Never 
walk in front of the judge or between the judge and the 
attorneys’ tables. Th is area, called the well, is oﬀ -limits 
and is to be entered only if the judge so directs or permis-
sion is granted. Traditionally, the area is a sword’s length 
and was intended for the judge’s protection.
 
Walk conﬁ dently; the jurors are there to hear the 
facts from you. If your investigation has been thorough 
and properly conducted, the jury will give a great deal of 
weight to your testimony.
 
If you have notes or a report, carry them in a clean 
manila ﬁ le folder in your left hand so your right hand is 
free for taking the oath. Taking the oath in court is basi-
cally the same as taking your oath of oﬃ  ce. Stand straight 
and face the clerk of the court, holding the palm of your 
hand toward the clerk. Use a clear, ﬁ rm voice to answer “I 
do” to the question “Do you promise to tell the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?” 
Do not look at the judge, either legal counsel or the jury.
 
Sit with your back straight but in a comfortable posi-
tion, usually with your hands folded in your lap or held on 
the arms of the chair. Do not move the chair around or ﬁ dget 
because this is distracting. Hold notes and other reports in 
your lap. If the reports are bulky, many experts on testifying 
recommend placing them under the chair until needed.
 
Th e witness chair in all courtrooms is positioned so 
you can face the judge, legal counsel, jury or the audience, 
depending on to whom your answers are directed. In most 
instances, if the judge asks you a question, look directly at 
the judge to answer. If either the prosecutor or defense 
counsel asks you a question, look directly at the jury to 
give your answer. Th e prosecutor will ask you to state your 
name, department and position. As you respond, keep in 
mind the types of statements that are not admissible.
Inadmissible statements include
• • Opinions and conclusions (unless the witness is 
qualiﬁ ed as an expert)
• • Hearsay
• • Privileged communication
• • Statements about character and reputation, 
including the defendant’s criminal record

656 | SECTION 5 | Other Challenges to the Criminal Investigator
Important nonverbal elements include dress, eye contact, 
posture, gestures, mannerisms, rate of speech, tone of 
voice and facial expressions.
 
Make eye contact with the jury often while testifying. 
Be aware of facial expressions that might indicate indif-
ference, disgust, displeasure or arrogance. Avoid actions 
associated with deception such as putting a hand over 
your mouth, rubbing your nose, straightening your hair, 
Refer to your notes if you are uncertain of speciﬁ c facts, 
but do not rely on them excessively.
 
Using notes too much detracts from your testimony, 
weakens your presentation and gives the impression you 
have not adequately prepared for the case. It can also 
lead to having your notes introduced into the record. If, 
as you refer to your notes, you discover you have given 
erroneous testimony such as an incorrect date or time, 
notify the court immediately. Do not try to cover up 
the discrepancy. Everyone makes mistakes. If you admit 
them in a professional manner, little harm results. Do 
not hesitate to admit that you do not know the answer 
to a question or that you do not understand a question. 
Never bluﬀ  or attempt to fake your way through an 
answer.
 
In addition, be aware of certain phrases that may 
leave a negative impression on the jury. Phrases such 
as “I believe” or “to the best of my recollection” will not 
impress a jury. Do not argue or use sarcasm, witticisms 
or “smart” answers. Be direct, ﬁ rm and positive. Be cour-
teous, whether in response to a question from the pros-
ecutor or an objection from the defense or the judge. Do 
not hesitate to give information favorable to the defen-
dant. Your primary responsibility is to state what you 
know about the case.
 
If asked to identify evidence with your personal mark, 
take time to examine the item thoroughly. Make sure 
that all marks are accounted for and that your mark has 
not been altered. A rapid identiﬁ cation may make a bad 
impression on the jury and may lead you into an errone-
ous identiﬁ cation.
NONVERBAL FACTORS
Do not underestimate the power of nonverbal factors as you 
testify. More than 25 years ago, Dr. Albert Mehrabian con-
ducted his famous, often-cited study at UCLA and concluded 
that communication is made up of several components: 
• • What is said—the actual words spoken (7 percent of 
the total message communicated)
• • How it is said—tone of voice, pitch, modulation and 
the like (38 percent of the message)
• • Nonverbal factors—body language, gestures, demeanor 
(55 percent)
 
Th us, the bulk of a message is conveyed not through 
which words are used but in how they are delivered. Never 
overlook the importance of how you present information 
and nonverbal factors when testifying.
Testifying in court is part of working in law enforcement. Ofﬁ cers 
must never underestimate the power of nonverbal communication 
when they testify. Although what is being said (the “facts” to which 
the ofﬁ cer is testifying) is certainly important, the way these facts 
are presented can speak just as loudly, if not louder, to the judge 
and jury. Important nonverbal elements include dress, eye contact, 
posture, gestures, mannerisms, rate of speech, and tone of voice. 
These factors can provide far more insight and depth into an 
ofﬁ cer’s statement of fact and experience, particularly as pertains 
to a brutal or otherwise horriﬁ c crime scene, than can mere words 
recorded onto the court transcript.
Consider the expression of Montgomery County police ofﬁ cer 
Cynthia Martin, the ﬁ rst ofﬁ cer on the scene of the shooting of 
sniper shooting victim Sarah Ramos, as she testiﬁ es during the 
trial of Washington area sniper suspect John Allen Muhammad.

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 657
(2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and 
methods and (3) the witness has applied the principles 
and methods reliably to the facts of the case.”
 
An expert witness is a person who has had special 
training, education or experience. Kruger (2005, p.11) 
explains, “Expert testimony is testimony that seeks 
to explain matters beyond the usual comprehension 
or knowledge of a typical jury. It is based on special-
ized knowledge, training, experience or skills, the 
application of which will help the jury understand the 
evidence.”
 
Daubert v. Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993) 
established standards for the admission of expert testi-
mony in federal courts. Under Daubert, an expert’s testi-
mony must be specialized and relate directly to some fact 
at issue in the case: “Expert testimony which does not 
relate to any issue in the case is not relevant and, ergo, 
non-helpful.” Th e Supreme Court noted that expert tes-
timony must ﬁ t the case. Fitness is determined by exam-
ining how helpful the testimony is. Th is “helpfulness” 
standard requires a valid connection between the expert 
testimony and the inquiry.
 
Oﬃ  cers who qualify as experts in an area are allowed 
to give opinions and conclusions, but the prosecution 
must qualify the oﬃ  cer as an expert on the stand. Th e 
prosecution must establish that the person has special 
knowledge that others of moderate education or expe-
rience in the same ﬁ eld do not possess. To qualify as an 
expert witness, one must have as many of the following 
as possible:
• • Present or prior employment in the speciﬁ c ﬁ eld
• • Active membership in a professional group in the ﬁ eld
• • Research work in the ﬁ eld
• • An educational degree directly related to the ﬁ eld
• • Direct experience with the subject if not employed in 
the ﬁ eld
• • Papers, treatises or books published on the subject or 
teaching experience in it
 
Police oﬃ  cers can become experts on sounds, ﬁ re-
arms, distances, lengths of time, visibility problems and 
so on simply by years of experience in police work. Other 
areas, such as ﬁ rearms identiﬁ cation, ﬁ ngerprint classiﬁ -
cation and handwriting analysis, require specialized train-
ing. Just who qualiﬁ es as an expert is not always clear, 
and diﬀ erent qualiﬁ cations may exist for scientiﬁ c and 
nonscientiﬁ c evidence.
 
It is strongly recommended that oﬃ  cers document 
their training, studies and experience in a format such as 
that shown in Figure 21.3. Take this record to court to 
establish yourself as an expert witness. 
buttoning your coat, picking lint oﬀ  your clothing or tug-
ging at your shirt or a pant leg.
STRATEGIES FOR EXCELLING AS A WITNESS
To excel as a witness, (1) set yourself up, (2) provoke 
the defense into giving you a chance to explain, (3) be 
unconditional and (4) do not stall.
Rutledge (2000) suggests several basic points to en -
hance the chance of success, some of which have been 
discussed:
• • Get into the habit of thinking ahead to the trial while 
you are still out in the ﬁ eld. Ask yourself, “What if 
they ask me this in court?” (p.20).
• • Th e rules of court severely restrict your answers to 
questions. No competent defense attorney is ever going 
to give you a chance to explain anything. So, you need 
to know how to provoke the defense attorney into giv-
ing you a chance to explain. Some of these provokers 
are deﬁ nitely; of course, certainly; certainly not; naturally; 
naturally not; and one that always works: Yes . . . and no 
(pp.24–27).
• • Be unconditional. Some police oﬃ  cers seem to like the 
sound of the conditional word would. When I am pros-
ecuting a case, I cringe at the sound of it because it is 
too indeﬁ nite.
 Example:
 Q: Who was your partner?
 A: Th at would be Oﬃ  cer Hill. (p.72)
• • Do not stall. Do not repeat the attorney’s question.
 Example:
 Q: Were you holding a ﬂ ashlight?
 A: Was I holding a ﬂ ashlight? Yes, I was. (p.75)
 
In some instances, oﬃ  cers may qualify to testify as 
expert witnesses. In such cases, the restrictions on testi-
mony are somewhat more relaxed.
EXPERT TESTIMONY
Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence states, “If scien-
tiﬁ c, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist 
the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to deter-
mine a fact in issue, a witness qualiﬁ ed as an expert by 
knowledge, skill, experience, training or education, may 
testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if 
(1) the testimony is based upon suﬃ  cient facts of data,

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 659
• • Appears relaxed and at ease
• • Is likeable and polite
• • Maintains eye contact with attorney and jury
• • Is not aﬀ ected by interruptions or objections
 
Rutledge (2000, p.60) notes, “You’re not an 
advocate—you’re a witness. Don’t try to help the 
prosecutor. Don’t try to thwart the defense lawyer.” 
Cross-examination is usually the most difficult part of 
testifying. “The defense lawyer’s most important task 
is to destroy your credibility—to make you look like 
you’re either a . . . bungler, a liar, or both. How does he 
do that? He attacks you. He tricks you. He outsmarts 
you. He confuses you. He frustrates you. He annoys 
you. He probes for your most vulnerable characteris-
tics” (Rutledge, p.118). How does this make officers 
feel?
 
Van Brocklin (2005, pp.46–47) suggests that when 
oﬃ  cers are given a word-association test and the words 
defense attorney are given, “Exclamations ﬂ y—snake, 
shark, weasel, slime, dishonest, deceptive, liar, and several 
that need not be printed.” According to Van Brocklin, this 
negative attitude explains why an oﬃ  cer can do a compe-
tent job in the investigation, be truthful and still not be 
believed by the jury. If jurors perceive that an investigator 
is acting defensively, they may think the investigator is 
not testifying truthfully: “Jurors think that only a guilty 
person—a person with something to hide—acts defen-
sively.” Th e key is to recognize this tendency and remain 
professional and objective.
 
Th e defense attorney will attempt to cast doubt on 
your direct testimony in an eﬀ ort to win an acquittal for 
the defendant. Know the methods of attack for cross-
examination to avoid being trapped.
TESTIFYING UNDER 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
Recall the earlier description of the adversary sys-
tem. It is understandable that an investigator 
would consider the defense attorney’s cross-examination 
as an attack on the prosecution’s case. However, also recall 
that according to Van Brocklin (2005, p.46), investigators’ 
attitudes determine their testimony style and their body 
language. During cross-examination, while the defense 
attorney attempts to impeach your testimony or at least 
undermine your credibility, posttrial interviews of jurors 
reveal other body language or behaviors that can weaken a 
witness’s credibility (Van Brocklin, p.48):
• • Uses a defensive or evasive tone of voice
• • Appears ill at ease or nervous
• • Avoids eye contact
• • Crosses arms defensively across chest
• • Quibbles over common terms
• • Sits stiﬄ  y
• • Looks to attorney for assistance during cross-
examination
• • Cracks jokes inappropriately
• • Uses lots of “ah’s” or “uh’s”
 
In contrast, jurors have noted that the following 
behaviors enhance credibility:
• • Displays an even temperament on direct and cross
• • Doesn’t become angry or defensive when pressed

your testimony speak for itself. If the defense criticizes 
your reference to notes, state that you simply want to 
be completely accurate. Be patient. If the defense coun-
sel becomes excessively oﬀ ensive, the prosecutor will 
intervene. Alternatively, the prosecutor may see that the 
defense is hurting its own case by such behavior and will 
allow the defense attorney to continue.
 
Th e defense attorney may further try to force con-
tradictions or inconsistencies by incessantly repeating 
questions using slightly diﬀ erent wording. Repeat your 
previous answer. If the defense claims that your testi-
mony does not agree with that of other oﬃ  cers, do not 
change your testimony. Whether your testimony is like 
theirs or diﬀ erent is irrelevant. Th e defense will attack it 
either way. If it is exactly alike, the defense will allege col-
lusion. If it is slightly diﬀ erent, the defense will exagger-
ate this to convince the jury that the diﬀ erences are so 
great that the oﬃ  cers are not even testifying about the 
same circumstances.
 
A common tactic of defense lawyers to destroy cred-
ibility is to try to get you to commit yourself to something 
and then later have to admit you could be wrong about 
it. Rutledge (2000, p.77) suggests that if either attorney 
asks for any kind of measurement you did not personally 
make, including distance, time, height, weight, speed, 
age and the like, allow yourself some leeway. Either give 
an approximation—for example, “he was approximately 
45 feet away”—or put your answer in brackets. Brackets 
provide a range—for example, “he was 40 to 50 feet away.” 
Nyberg (2006, p.22) states, “You might get a question 
like, ‘How many times did you ask my client if he knew 
where his wife was?’ Th e temptation is to come up with 
a number, to make it sound impressive. Don’t get snared 
into answering something like this. Th e best answer is, 
‘I have no idea. I’ve never even considered counting how 
many times I’ve asked someone something. During an 
interview, I am more tuned in to what the other person is 
saying.’ Show the jury that you are a professional and that 
your goal is to get to the truth.”
 
Another defense tactic is to use an accusatory tone 
in asking whether you talked with others about the case 
and what they told you about how to testify. Such accusa-
tions may make inexperienced oﬃ  cers feel guilty because 
they know they have talked about the case with many 
people. Because the accusing tone implies that this was 
legally incorrect, the oﬃ  cers may reply that they talked 
to no one. Such a response is a mistake because you may 
certainly discuss the case before testifying. Simply state 
that you have discussed the case with several people in an 
oﬃ  cial capacity, but that none of them told you how to 
testify.
 
If defense counsel asks whether you have refreshed 
your memory before testifying, do not hesitate to say 
During cross-examination the defense attorney may
• • Be disarmingly friendly or intimidatingly rude.
• • Attack your credibility and impartiality.
• • Attack your investigative skill.
• • Attempt to force contradictions or inconsistencies.
• • Ask leading questions or deliberately misquote you.
• • Ask for a simple answer to a complex question.
• • Use rapid-ﬁ re questioning.
• • Use the silent treatment.
 
Th e defense attorney can be extremely friendly, hop-
ing to put you oﬀ  guard by making the questioning appear 
to be just a friendly chat. Th e attorney may praise your 
skill in investigation and lead you into boasting or a show 
of self-gloriﬁ cation that will leave a very bad impression 
on the jury. Th e “friendly” defense attorney may also try 
to lead you into testifying about evidence of which you 
have no personal knowledge. Th is error will be immedi-
ately exposed and your testimony tainted, if not com-
pletely discredited.
 
At the opposite extreme is the defense attorney who 
appears outraged by statements you make and goes on 
the attack immediately. Th is kind of attorney appears very 
excited and outraged, as though the trial is a travesty of 
justice. A natural reaction to such an approach is to exag-
gerate your testimony or lose your temper, which is exactly 
what the defense attorney wants. If you show anger, the 
jury may believe you are more interested in obtaining a 
conviction than determining the truth. It is often hard for 
a jury to believe that the well-dressed, meek-appearing 
defendant in court is the person who, armed with a gun, 
robbed a store and assaulted several bystanders. Maintain 
your dignity and impartiality, and show concern for only 
the facts.
 
Th e credibility of your testimony can be undermined 
in many ways. Th e defense may attempt to show that 
you are prejudiced, have poor character or are interested 
only in seeing your arrest “stick.” If asked, “Do you want 
to see the defendant convicted?” reply that you are there 
to present the facts you know and that you will abide by 
the court’s decision. No contemporary case demonstrated 
these cross-examination attacks on police credibility 
more eﬀ ectively than the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Th e 
defense was successful in shifting the focus away from 
the issue of the defendant’s guilt and putting it directly 
on the incompetence of the police investigators.
 
Th e defense may also try to show that your testi-
mony itself is erroneous because you are incompetent, 
lack information, are confused, have forgotten facts or 
could not have had personal knowledge of the facts you 
have testiﬁ ed to. Do not respond to such criticism. Let 

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 661
A key to testifying during cross-examination is to NEVER 
volunteer any information.
 
During cross-examination, the defense attorney can 
ask questions about only subjects raised by the prosecu-
tion during direct examination. If an investigator volun-
teers additional information, he or she may open up areas 
the prosecution did not intend to present and may not be 
prepared for.
HANDLING OBJECTIONS
Th ree general types of objections common during trials 
are
• • Objections to the form of the question, arguing the 
question, as asked, is leading, speculative, argumenta-
tive, misstates facts in evidence, assumes facts not in 
evidence, is vague and ambiguous, repetitive or cumu-
lative or is misleading. 
• • Objections to the substance of the question, arguing 
that the question is irrelevant, immaterial, incompe-
tent, calls for hearsay, has insuﬃ  cient foundation, 
calls for inadmissible opinion or is beyond the scope 
of the direct examination.
• • Objections to the answer in that it is either unrespon-
sive, an inadmissible opinion or an inadmissible hear-
say statement.
 
Rutledge (2000, pp.97–115) gives the following sug-
gestions for handling objections (reprinted by permission 
of the publisher):
Th ere are at least 44 standard trial objections in most 
states. We’re only going to talk about the two that 
account for upwards of 90 percent of the problems a 
testifying oﬃ  cer will have: that your answer is a conclu-
sion, or that it is nonresponsive.
•  How to avoid conclusions. One way is to listen to 
the form of the question. You know the attorney is 
asking you to speculate when he starts his questions 
with these loaded phrases:
 
Would you assume . . . ?
 
Do you suppose . . . ?
 
Don’t you think that . . . ?
 
Couldn’t it be that . . . ?
 
Do you imagine . . . ?
 
Wouldn’t it be fair to presume . . . ?
“yes.” You would be a poor witness if you had not done so. 
Discussions with the prosecution, oﬃ  cers and witnesses 
and a review of notes and reports are entirely proper. Th ey 
help you tell the truth, the main purpose of testimony.
 
Leading questions are another defense tactic. For 
example, defense counsel may ask, “When did you ﬁ rst 
strike the defendant?” Th is implies that you did in fact 
strike the defendant. Defense attorneys also like to 
ask questions that presume you have already testiﬁ ed 
to something when in fact you may not have done so. 
If you are misquoted, call it to the counsel’s attention 
and then repeat the facts you testiﬁ ed to. If you do not 
remember your exact testimony, have it read from the 
court record.
 
In addition, defense counsel may ask complicated 
questions and then say, “Please answer ‘yes’ or ‘no.’” Obvi-
ously, some questions cannot be answered that simply. 
Ask to have the question broken down. No rule requires a 
speciﬁ c answer. If the court does not grant your request, 
answer the question as directed and let the prosecutor 
bring out the information through redirect examination.
 
Rapid-ﬁ re questioning is yet another tactic that 
defense attorneys use to provoke unconsidered answers. 
Do not let the attorney’s pace rush you. Take time to con-
sider your responses.
 
Do not be taken in by the “silent treatment.” Th e 
defense attorney may remain silent for what seems like 
many seconds after you answer a question. If you have 
given a complete answer, wait patiently. Do not attempt 
to ﬁ ll the silence by saying things such as, “At least that’s 
how I remember it,” or “It was something very close to 
that.”
 
Another tactic frequently used by defense attorneys is 
to mispronounce oﬃ  cers’ names intentionally or address 
them by the wrong rank. Th is is an attempt to distract the 
oﬃ  cer.
 
Regardless of how your testimony is attacked, treat 
the defense counsel as respectfully as you do the prosecu-
tor. Do not regard the defense counsel as your enemy. You 
are in court to state the facts and tell the truth. Your tes-
timony should exhibit no personal prejudice or animosity, 
and you should not become excited or provoked at defense 
counsel. Be professional.
 
Few oﬃ  cers are prepared for the rigor of testifying 
in court, even if they have received training in this area. 
Until oﬃ  cers have actually testiﬁ ed in court, they cannot 
understand how diﬃ  cult it is. Because police oﬃ  cers are 
usually the primary and most damaging witnesses in a 
criminal case, defense attorneys know they must attempt 
to confuse, discredit or destroy the oﬃ  cers’ testimony. 
Th e best testimony is accurate, truthful and in accordance 
with the facts. Every word an oﬃ  cer says is recorded and 
may be played back or used by the defense.

activities. To remain gives the impression that you have a 
special interest in the case.
 
If you are in the courtroom at the time of the verdict, 
show neither approval nor disapproval at the outcome. If 
you have been a credible witness and told the truth, win or 
lose in court, you have done your job and should not take 
the outcome personally.
 
Th e complainant should be notiﬁ ed of the disposition 
of the case. A form such as the one shown in Figure 21.4 is 
frequently used.
ADVICE ON TESTIFYING FROM 
A SEASONED, “OFFICER OF 
THE YEAR” INVESTIGATOR
You were introduced to Detective Richard 
Gautsch at the beginning of the text. He 
returns to furnish the book’s conclusion, emphasizing the 
areas to focus on when giving courtroom testimony and 
providing examples of some of his experiences testifying.
 
Although everything in this chapter is important, 
Gautsch emphasizes three major areas:
 1. Preparation. While testifying, an investigator should 
not use his or her report as a crutch or a script. It 
should be a safety net—seldom used. Constantly 
referring to a report gives the jury the impression 
that you do not know the case. Oﬃ  cers should study 
their reports and the reports of fellow oﬃ  cers before 
testifying.
 2. Communication. Understand that words are a small 
part of communicating. Expressions, demeanor, per-
sonality, appearance and more are what jurors use to 
form an opinion. If you remind them of the obstinate 
cop who wrote them a ticket for going two miles over 
the speed limit, they’re going to sympathize with the 
defendant.
 3. Credibility. If jurors question your credibility, the case 
is in big trouble. If you are caught in a lie, an embel-
lishment, or an obvious omission, why should a juror 
believe anything you say? In the O. J. Simpson murder 
trial, a detective lied about whether he had ever used 
racial slurs. Even though it had nothing to do with the 
evidence he was presenting, once he lost his credibil-
ity, his testimony lost its value and, indeed, severely 
damaged the prosecution’s case.
 
Detective Gautsch was nervous the night before his ﬁ rst 
major trial, his mind ﬁ lled with stories of defense attorneys 
ripping cops to shreds during cross-examination—stories 
 
Isn’t it strange that . . . ?
And the one you’re likely to hear most often:
 
Isn’t it possible that . . . ?
•  Another major area of conclusionary testimony is 
what I call mindreading. You can’t get inside some-
one else’s brain. Th at means you don’t know for a 
fact—so you can’t testify—as to what someone else 
sees, hears, feels, thinks or wants; and you don’t 
know for a fact what somebody is trying to do, or is 
able to do, or whether he is nervous, excited, angry, 
scared, happy, upset, disturbed, or in any of the 
other emotional states that can only be labeled with 
a conclusion.
•  How to give “responsive” answers. You have to 
answer just the question you’re asked—no more, no 
less. Th at means you have to pay attention to how 
the question is framed. You answer a yes-or-no ques-
tion with a “yes” or “no.”
 
Q: Did he perform the alphabet test?
 
A: Yes, twice—but he only went to “G.”
Everything after the “yes” is nonresponsive. Th e oﬃ  cer 
anticipated the next three questions and volunteered 
the answers. He should have limited each answer to one 
question:
 
Q: Did he perform the alphabet test?
 
A: Yes.
 
Q: How many times?
 
A: Twice.
 
Q: How far did he go correctly the ﬁ rst time?
 
A: To the letter “G.”
To avoid objections to your testimony, avoid conclusions 
and nonresponsive answers. Answer yes-or-no questions 
with “yes” or “no.”
CONCLUDING YOUR 
TESTIMONY
Do not leave the stand until instructed to do so 
by counsel or the court. As you leave the stand, 
do not pay special attention to the prosecution, defense 
counsel, defendant or jury. Return immediately to your 
seat in the courtroom or leave the room if you have been 
sequestered. If you are told you may be needed for further 
testimony, remain available. If told you are no longer 
needed, leave the courtroom and resume your normal 

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 663
reassuring. He knew all about the detective’s background 
and that he had reached the rank of detective at a very 
young age. Th e attorney’s tone was complimentary, and 
Gautsch’s fear of being ripped to shreds was replaced 
with a sense of importance. He began to enjoy the cross-
examination.
 
Most of the initial questions were general and easy 
to answer. Th e defense attorney asked several questions 
about the defendant’s level of cooperation. He cited 
things that his client had done at their request, includ-
ing having his hands swabbed for gunpowder residue. 
Gautsch acknowledged that the defendant had been 
cooperative. Th e defense attorney asked if his client had 
artfully embellished by fellow cops—and the knowledge 
that a bad day testifying can lose a case. He had good reason 
to be nervous, as the defense attorney assigned to the case 
was infamous for picking apart police reports. He studied 
his reports as if he were taking a ﬁ nal exam and rehearsed 
responses to every dirty trick a defense attorney could 
throw at him. He wasn’t going to be some ill-prepared cop 
referring to his report for the suspect’s name or the loca-
tion of an arrest.
 
He took the stand, scanned the packed courtroom 
and hoped his voice would not crack. Th e direct testimony 
went smoothly, but he knew what was coming. Th e defense 
attorney smiled and greeted him. His voice was calm and

punched the smirk oﬀ  the suspect’s face, satisfying his 
need for retribution, but jeopardizing the entire case.
 
Seasoned detectives interviewed the suspect for sev-
eral hours. He denied any involvement in the murder. Dur-
ing a break in the questioning, the suspect and Detective 
Gautsch were left alone in the interview room. Th ey were 
the same age, and the suspect felt more comfortable talk-
ing to Gautsch. Eventually he confessed to the murder.
 
Gautsch did not include the striking incident in his 
report, but it was ever present in his mind. He was the 
key witness at the trial, and the confession was the most 
important evidence. Th e defense attorney was one of the 
very best. He methodically questioned the detective about 
various aspects of the investigation, then paused and 
switched legal pads. “Detective, did you punch my client 
before he confessed to you?”
 
Gautsch’s heart pounded so loudly he was sure every-
one could hear it. Th e confession, the case and his job were 
all about to be lost. Th e murdering little creep was going 
to get oﬀ  because of Gautsch’s stupidity. Th e courtroom 
was silent. Th e jury, the prosecutor, the judge, the press 
and the victim’s family all stared at him, waiting for his 
answer. For the sake of justice, Gautsch wondered if one 
lie would really hurt. He looked squarely into the defense 
attorney’s eyes and responded, “Yes sir, I did.”
 
For a moment the defense attorney looked per-
plexed. He asked a few more questions and sat down. Th e 
prosecutor was furious that Gautsch had neglected to 
share that damaging information with him. Fortunately, 
the defendants were found guilty and sentenced to life 
in prison. After the trial, the defense attorney asked to 
meet with Gautsch in the prosecutor’s oﬃ  ce. Gautsch 
arrived expecting some type of sanctions. Instead, the 
defense attorney extended his hand and commended 
Gautsch for telling the truth on the stand. Th e attorney 
said he had hoped Gautsch would deny hitting his client. 
If he had, the attorney was prepared to show that the 
detective was lying and ruin his credibility with the jury. 
When Gautsch told the truth, the attorney’s strategy 
failed, and the detective’s credibility with the jury was 
actually enhanced.
 
Th e lesson to be learned is never lie, exaggerate or 
embellish your testimony. It is more obvious to a jury than 
you may realize. Once you lose your credibility, it is nearly 
impossible to recover it. Th e truth can only strengthen a 
good case.
refused any of their requests. Gautsch paused to think, 
and the defense attorney quickly added, “Did you ask 
him to do anything else?”
 
It seemed to Gautsch that the defense attorney was 
helping him remember something in his report without 
making him look stupid. Th en Gautsch remembered, 
“Oh, yes. He agreed to take a polygraph test.” Th e defense 
attorney thanked Gautsch and sat down. Th e prosecutor 
slowly slumped in his chair. Gautsch had been tricked into 
telling the jury that the defendant was willing to take a lie-
detector test—something that wasn’t admissible and that 
the defense could not have presented without the detec-
tive’s help. In fact, the defendant oﬀ ered to take the test, 
but later refused—something the jury would never hear. 
His mistake left the jury with the impression that the 
defendant had passed a polygraph test. Th e jury returned 
a guilty verdict for a lesser charge and left Gautsch won-
dering what role his mistake on the stand had played in its 
decision.
 
Another defense attorney taught Detective Gautsch a 
more positive lesson during his ﬁ rst murder trial—a case 
described at the beginning of the text. Two men robbed 
and murdered a teenage boy working as an attendant at 
a gas station. Th ey netted less than $50, but decided the 
boy had to be killed because he had seen their faces. Th ey 
forced him into their car, bound his hands and drove him 
to secluded woods. Th ey shot him nine times and left him 
to bleed to death. Th e boy was missing for a week before 
his body was found. During that week, Detective Gautsch 
got to know the boy’s family as wonderful people. He 
fought back tears when he brought them the news of their 
son’s death.
 
Experienced detectives do not allow their emotions 
to inﬂ uence their professionalism. At age 24, Gautsch 
was inexperienced and emotional. Th e scene was cha-
otic as the team of detectives raided a house where one 
of the suspects was living. Cops rushed in to secure the 
scene and control a group of suspects. Gautsch grabbed 
the ﬁ rst person he could get his hands on and forced him 
against a wall. He recognized him as one of the murderers. 
As Gautsch held him against the wall, he felt the suspect 
tremble. Gautsch asked why he was shaking, and he said 
they had scared him. Gautsch asked how scared the boy 
had been when they had marched him into the woods. Th e 
suspect smirked and laughed nervously. At that instant 
Gautsch made a stupid, unprofessional mistake—he 

CHAPTER 21 | Preparing for and Presenting Cases in Court | 665
admit calmly when you do not know an answer; admit 
any mistakes you make in testifying; avoid police jar-
gon, sarcasm and humor; and above all, tell the com-
plete truth as you know it. Refer to your notes if you 
are uncertain of specific facts, but do not rely on them 
excessively; this would give the impression that you are 
not prepared for the case and thus weaken your testi-
mony. Important nonverbal elements include dress, eye 
contact, posture, gestures, mannerisms, rate of speech, 
tone of voice and facial expressions. 
 
Strategies for testifying in court include (1) setting 
yourself up, (2) provoking the defense into giving you a 
chance to explain, (3) being unconditional and (4) not 
stalling. Anticipate the tactics commonly used by defense 
attorneys during cross-examination. Th ey may be disarm-
ingly friendly or intimidatingly rude; attack your cred-
ibility and impartiality; attack your investigative skill; 
attempt to force contradictions or inconsistencies; ask 
leading questions or deliberately misquote you; request a 
“yes” or “no” answer to complex questions; use rapid-ﬁ re 
questioning; or use the “silent treatment.” A key to tes-
tifying during cross-examination is to NEVER volunteer 
any information. To avoid objections to your testimony, 
avoid conclusions and nonresponsive answers. Answer 
yes-or-no questions with “yes” or “no.”
 
If you are well prepared, know the facts and present 
them truthfully and professionally, you have done your 
part in furthering the cause of justice. Th e disposition of a 
case should be made known to the complainant. 
Final Report
• • Have I met all the criteria for an eﬀ ective report? (See 
Chapter 3)
• • Have I included all relevant information?
• • Have I included headings?
• • Have I proofread the paper to spot content and com-
position errors?
Preparing to Testify
• • Have all reports been reviewed?
• • Have all reports been organized for presentation to 
the prosecutor?
• • Has all evidence been located and made available for 
court presentation?
• • Has all evidence been examined by competent labo-
ratories and the results obtained? Are copies of the 
reports available?
• • Have all known leads been developed?
CHECKLIST
Th e most important rule to eradicate fear of testifying in 
court is to always tell the truth.
 
Before testifying, the ﬁ nal report must be written 
and presented to the prosecutor. Th e ﬁ nal report contains 
(1) the complaint; (2) the preliminary investigation report; 
(3) all follow-up and progress reports; (4) statements, 
admissions and confessions; (5) laboratory reports; 
(6) photographs, sketches and drawings; and (7) a sum-
mary of all negative (exculpatory) evidence. Th e quality 
of the content and writing of the report inﬂ uences its 
credibility.
 
Th e prosecutor is the most powerful oﬃ  cial in the 
court system. To prosecute or not to prosecute is often 
a question. Some cases are never prosecuted because the 
complaint is invalid, the prosecutor declines after review-
ing the case, the complainant refuses to prosecute, the 
oﬀ ender dies, the oﬀ ender is in prison or out of the coun-
try and cannot be returned or no evidence or leads exist. If 
the decision is made to prosecute, thorough preparation is 
required. To prepare a case for court, (1) review and evalu-
ate all evidence, positive and negative, and the chain of cus-
tody; (2) review all reports on the case, including transcripts 
of any depositions you have given; (3) prepare witnesses; 
(4) write the ﬁ nal report; and (5) hold a pretrial conference 
with the prosecutor. Concentrate on proving the elements 
of the crime and establishing the oﬀ ender’s identity.
 
Before the trial, hold a conference with the prosecu-
tor to review all the evidence and to discuss the strengths 
and weaknesses of the case and the probable line of the 
prosecutor’s and defense attorney’s questioning.
 
A criminal trial begins with the jury selection. When 
court convenes, prosecution and defense make their open-
ing statements. Th e prosecution then presents its case, 
followed by cross-examination by the defense. Th en the 
defense’s case is presented, followed by cross-examination 
by the prosecution. Th en there is rebuttal and surrebuttal 
testimony. After closing statements by the prosecution 
and the defense, the judge instructs the jury, which then 
retires to deliberate its verdict. When a verdict is reached, 
court is reconvened and the verdict read. If the defendant 
is found guilty, the judge passes sentence or sets a sen-
tencing date.
 
The “win” for an investigator who testifies is to 
have established credibility. This includes avoiding 
inadmissible statements, including opinions, conclu-
sions, hearsay, privileged communications and state-
ments about the defendant’s character and reputation. 
To present testimony effectively, speak clearly, firmly 
and with expression; answer questions directly, and do 
not volunteer information; pause briefly before answer-
ing; refer to your notes if you do not recall exact details;

Appendix A
Because there’s so much to do as a crime scene ﬁ rst responder, a checklist can help you ensure that all necessary steps have been taken. 
Th e following checklist is presented as a guideline only. Each agency should develop a list that’s geared to its speciﬁ c requirements.
ARRIVAL AND ASSESSMENT
• Establish perimeter and secure area.
• Render aid to victims and ensure scene is safe for medical personnel.
• Coordinate arriving units.
• Record names and unit numbers of ﬁ re/rescue, medical personnel and LEOs on scene. 
• Remove unnecessary personnel from scene as soon as possible.
• Assign oﬃ  cer to escort or ride with victim to hospital.
 – Secure clothing and evidence.
 – Obtain tape-recorded statement, if possible.
• Initial assessment. Does this appear to be a crime? If so, what type of crime. 
• Assign oﬃ  cer to suspect. 
 – Assess need for immediate suspect arrest. Does probable cause exist? 
 – Is evidence present on the suspect? Collect perishable evidence from suspect if exigency exists.
 – Is it necessary to bag hands, etc?
ESTABLISHING COMMAND
• Designate command. Who’s in charge?
•  Designate common radio channel for all arriving personnel.
STABILIZE AND SECURE SCENE
• Clear crime scene and establish clearly delineated perimeter with crime scene tape.
 – Record time.
 – Make scene bigger than it needs to be.
 – Create one entry/exit point in scene to reduce contamination.
• Assign crime scene security personnel and start detailed crime scene access log.
• Begin initial areas canvass. Assign oﬃ  cers to locate witnesses, separate witnesses, and obtain initial statements from 
witnesses. 
• If required, assign personnel to search immediate area for additional evidence or crime scenes.
• Establish a command post and staging area.
 – Incident command vehicle available?
 – Building or home nearby?
 – Secure area for equipment and evidence?
 – Bathroom facilities?
• Obtain case number. Have number broadcast by communications/dispatch.

• Key witnesses separated, oﬃ  cer assigned, witnesses secured or transported to police department. 
• Obtain voluntary written statements.
• Suspect/s secured, transported.
• Given Miranda warning?
• Record any spontaneous statements/utterances made by suspect—tape record if possible.
• Perishable evidence protected from elements or tampering.
• Photograph overall area of scene.
• Create staging and brieﬁ ng area for media.
TRANSFER OF COMMAND
• Meet and brief detective supervisor and other personnel.
• Help determine need for warrant.
• Help prepare initial statement for press release.
• Direct all patrol personnel to complete detailed reports as soon as possible. 
• Logistics covered.
 – Do you need more equipment, personnel, etc., to respond?
• Meet with crime scene investigators to discuss scene and evidence. 
• Transfer command to detective supervisor.
HELP YOUR INVESTIGATORS
In preparation for writing this article, I polled about a hundred detectives from various law enforcement agencies in my county. 
Th e following summarizes the responses I received regarding what to do and what not to do as a crime scene ﬁ rst responder:
WHAT NOT TO DO
• Don’t smoke in or near the scene. Besides potentially contaminating other physical evidence, it can ruin a K-9’s chance of 
tracking a suspect or locating additional evidence through scent.
• Don’t eat or drink in a scene. If you need to eat or drink, do it in your patrol car, in the incident command vehicle, or at 
some other location outside of the scene. 
• Don’t use the bathroom at a crime scene. I’ve collected toilet paper, fecal material, condoms, and swabs from toilets. 
Th ey can provide useful physical evidence in certain cases. 
• Don’t allow command staﬀ  or other nonessential personnel to walk through the scene. Th is is not appropriate before 
the scene is processed. It’s useful for ﬁ rst responders to snap digital pictures of the scene that can be viewed by other 
nonessential personnel. 
• Don’t laugh or look like you’re having too much fun at a scene. It just looks unprofessional. 
• Don’t forget to think about secondary scenes.
• Don’t prematurely handle evidence within the scene—wait for crime scene personnel.
• Don’t replace evidence if it’s been moved. For example, if medical personnel had to move a table, don’t move the table 
back into position. Simply note that the table was moved and leave it alone. 
• Don’t use the phone within the scene. 
• Don’t use the trash can in the scene as a trash receptacle for your garbage. Trash cans often hold physical evidence. 
PRESERVE THE SCENE
Make the scene much bigger than you think you have to. Remember, you can always shrink a scene but you can never 
make it bigger. 
• Establish one point of entry and exit into the scene to minimize contamination. 
• Limit access to nonessential personnel.
• Keep an accurate and detailed record of your actions and observations. 
• Write a detailed report including accurate times.
• Protect perishable evidence by any means necessary. For example, cover a footwear impression with a plastic container if 
it starts to rain or snow.
