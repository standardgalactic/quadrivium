Dedication
I dedicate this book to my two basset hounds, Max and Dixie, both of whom
have absolutely no need for anger management.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to thank a number of “teammates” who made writing this book
both possible and enjoyable. First, I am indebted — once again — to my
agent, Denise Marcil, and her delightful associate, Maura Kye, for all their
efforts on my behalf. I was well represented!
The folks at John Wiley & Sons, Inc. — in particular, Lindsay Lefevere,
Elizabeth Kuball, and Rebecca Stidham — were fantastic. I deeply appreciate
their professionalism, expertise, encouragement, and, most of all, patience
during both the acquisition and editorial phases of the project. The energy
and passion associated with the For Dummies series is, indeed, infectious.
And, as always, I want to thank my loving family — Catherine, Rebecca, 
and Chris — for yet another show of support for my life’s work. They never
disappoint.
Basically, we are all dummies when it comes to anger management — a field
that remains a work in progress. I learn more every day about ways to har-
ness this complicated and, at times, troublesome emotion, and being able to
share this education with my readers is a pleasure. If this book changes the
life of a single person for the better, then I am satisfied that the hard work
that went into it was worthwhile.

Anger Management For Dummies

Introduction
A
nger is part of life — no less than memory, happiness, and compassion.
No one chooses to be angry. Anger is a reaction that’s built into your
nervous system. In fact, anger is one of the first emotions mothers recognize
in their newborn infants. So, it’s never too early to start anger management.
Anger says more about you — your temperament, how you view the world,
how balanced your life is, and how easily you forgive others — than it does
about other people. You don’t have to be a victim of your own anger — you
can choose how you respond when the world doesn’t treat you the way you
want it to. You have just as much choice about how you express your anger
as you do about what color shirt you wear, what you eat for breakfast, or
what time you go jogging this afternoon. You also have a choice about how
much of yesterday’s anger you carry into the future and how much anger you
are likely to experience tomorrow. If I didn’t believe that, I would have been
doing something very different with my professional life for the past 40 years!
No one is exempt from problematic anger. Anger is a very democratic 
emotion — it causes problems for men and women, kids and the elderly, rich
and poor, educated and uneducated, people of all colors and ethnic back-
grounds, believers and nonbelievers. Tens of millions of human beings need-
lessly suffer from what I call toxic anger — anger that literally poisons your
life — each and every day of their lives.
Anger is not something that can — or should be — cured. But you have to
manage it well — at home, at work, and in your most intimate relationships —
if you want to benefit from it. Anger Management For Dummies tells you how
to manage your anger by focusing on the positive — how to get a good
night’s sleep, how to change your perspective on life, why confession is
better for you than venting, how to transform conflicts into challenges, and
much more. Anger management has moved far beyond the simplistic (albeit
well-intentioned) advice of years past to count to ten or take a couple of deep
breaths every time you get angry — and that’s good news!
About This Book
How do you know when you have too much anger? Do you determine that for
yourself, or do you let other people make that call? If you’re not physically
aggressive — physically hurting other people or poking holes in walls — does

that mean you’re not angry? Does it really help to vent, to get things off your
chest, or are you better off keeping your mouth shut in order to keep the
peace? Can angry people really change or do they have to go through life suf-
fering because that’s just the way they are? And what should you do if you’re
on the wrong end of someone else’s anger? These are all important questions
that Anger Management For Dummies answers for you.
When I wrote Anger Management For Dummies, I had four basic goals in mind:
 I wanted to show you that anger is more than a four-letter word — it’s
an extremely complex emotion that has meaning well beyond the
crude and hurtful words we use to express it. Understanding all that
your anger says about you is the essence of anger management.
 I wanted to illustrate all the various ways that anger can — and 
does — adversely affect your life when it occurs too frequently and 
is too intense.
 I wanted to explain that anger management occurs in three distinct
time frames — yesterday, today, and tomorrow. The strategies I pro-
pose to manage anger will, of course, differ depending on whether
you’re trying to let go of some old anger, deal with the anger you face
today, or prevent (yes, I said prevent!) anger that you’re otherwise des-
tined to experience tomorrow.
 I wanted to show you that managing anger is something that is
entirely within your power — and not something you have to seek
professional help for — if you’re willing to make the necessary
lifestyle changes outlined in this book. It doesn’t matter how old you
are or how long anger has been a part of your life — it’s never too late to
manage your anger.
Anger Management For Dummies is not one of those 12-step books where 
you have to read (and follow the advice) of Step 1 before you can proceed to
Step 2, and so on. It’s a resource book containing all the information I have at
my disposal after four decades of combined clinical practice and scientific
research on anger management. You don’t have to start with Chapter 1 and
read straight through to the end of the book. You can look at the Table of
Contents, find something that interests you, and start there. You may want to
focus on the area in which you’re having the most trouble controlling your
temper — at work, for example. Or you may want to head straight for a chap-
ter on managing stress (one of the most common causes of anger). I’m not
even going to suggest that you read the whole book — that’s up to you. Be
like my bassett hounds and go where your nose (or in this case, your eyes!)
lead you. Trust me, you’ll get where you need to be.

Anger Management For Dummies 

Conventions Used in This Book
I did not want Anger Management For Dummies to be yet another book writ-
ten by psychologists for psychologists. This book is intended to show ordi-
nary people how to lead an anger-free life, so I’ve eliminated all the
professional jargon, and used terms and concepts — as one of my mentors in
graduate school used to say — that “my grandmother can understand.”
I’ve also tried to make reading Anger Management For Dummies an enjoyable
experience. Just because anger is a serious topic doesn’t mean that you need
to approach it with a deadly serious attitude. One of the most memorable
educational experiences of my life, in fact, was one in which the speaker —
the infamous physician Patch Adams — painted all of our noses red before he
began his lecture.
Most important, Anger Management For Dummies is loaded with stories about
human beings, just like you, who have successfully overcome a lifetime of
anger. The people you’ll read about aren’t real — they’re composites of many
relatives, friends, and clients I’ve encountered over the years who’ve taught
me the important lessons about anger management. The quotations and two-
person dialogues that I include in these stories are based on my recollections
of conversations I had.
You don’t have to know psychology to understand this book. But I do use a
couple conventions that you should be aware of:
 When I introduce a new term, I put the word in italics and define it
shortly thereafter (usually in parentheses).
 When I list an e-mail address or Web address, I use a special font called
monofont so you know exactly what to type.
And that’s it!
What You’re Not to Read
Whoever said half a loaf is better than none had the right idea. You don’t
have to read every single word, sentence, part, and/or chapter of Anger
Management For Dummies to get your money’s worth. And just because you
see something marked with a Remember icon doesn’t mean that you’re
expected to remember everything you read. I won’t be giving out any tests at
the end!

Introduction

I include lots of sidebars — the text in gray boxes — which, though not
essential to the overall message offered in this book, are things I thought you
might find interesting in their own right. You can think of them as “side
dishes” to the main course — whether you read them depends on how
hungry (for information) you are. But you can safely skip them without miss-
ing anything critical to the topic at hand.
You can also safely skip the paragraphs marked with Technical Stuff icons (see
“Icons Used in This Book,” later in this Introduction, for more information).
Foolish Assumptions
I made a few assumptions about you when I was writing this book:
 You may or may not have a problem with anger — but if you don’t
have a problem with anger yourself, you know or love someone who
does. If you didn’t buy this book for yourself, you bought it for your 
husband, wife, brother, sister, son, daughter, father, mother, friend, or
co-worker. Or one of those people bought it for you.
 You don’t want to know everything there is to know about anger —
you just want to know what you need to know to manage anger effec-
tively. Scientists have studied anger for years, but you won’t find a
bunch of scientific mumbo-jumbo in these pages. I focus on proven
strategies to help you manage your anger, and that’s it.
How This Book Is Organized
I organized Anger Management For Dummies into 7 parts and 25 chapters.
Here’s what you can find in each part.
Part I: The Basics of Anger
In the first three chapters, I acquaint you with some basic facts about anger
as a universal emotion, the role that emotions like anger play in your life, and
help you decide whether anger is poisoning your health, career, and relation-
ships. Chapter 2 shows you how to quantify your anger and distinguish
between what I call toxic anger and nontoxic anger. I want you to be able to
respond to anger (and the circumstances that provoke it) instead of just
reacting in some predictable, mindless, knee-jerk fashion that almost always
takes you someplace you really don’t want to go.

Anger Management For Dummies 

Part II: Managing Your Anger Today
In this part, I help you tackle the challenge of managing anger in the moment.
Most people get in trouble simply because they don’t know what to do when
they begin to experience anger. In effect, it’s what you don’t know (for exam-
ple, that all emotions are transient) and don’t do (for example, let the other
person have the last word) that leads to anger mismanagement. Chapter 6
offers you a structured, multistep, effective method you can use to keep your
cool.
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow
Chapters 7 through 11 show you ways to deal with anger before it happens.
This is a radical new approach — most anger-management strategies are
designed to work after the fact (which is difficult if not impossible — try
counting to ten when you’re in the middle of a rage!). As far as I’m concerned,
preventing anger is the most exciting aspect of anger management. In this
part, I also talk about “getting your mind right” in terms of what you expect
and will tolerate from the world around you, why it’s imperative that you quit
disguising your anger and just say what you feel (but with civility!), how to
make a private confession of your anger, how to become the type of person
who doesn’t invite so much anger, and — perhaps most important — how
you can use your anger constructively. If you can make anger your ally, you
no longer have to worry about avoiding it.
Part IV: Handling Anger from the Past
If you’re like me, you often find yourself getting much angrier than the situa-
tion you’re in warrants. You’re left with the question: “What in the world got
into me?” Chances are, you just tapped into some old anger that’s rolling
around in your unconscious (Freud was right!) just waiting for an opportunity
to express itself. In Chapter 12, I offer some tips on how not to let today’s
anger become tomorrow’s anger — strategies like saying “Excuse you!” and
the ten-minute rant. In Chapter 13, I get into the mechanics of forgiveness as
applied to anger management. I’m not looking at forgiveness as a spiritual
issue here, but rather as a tool for letting go of anger from the past that has
long since outlived its usefulness.
5
Introduction

Part V: Lifestyle Changes That 
Improve More Than Your Anger
Here’s what I believe: Healthy people rarely get angry. In this part, I show you
that toxic anger is a byproduct of a toxic lifestyle. If you’re on the verge of
stress burnout, if your daily diet consists mainly of caffeine and alcohol (with
some nicotine thrown in for good measure!), if your life is all out of balance
(too much work, too little play), if you never get a good night’s sleep, if you
carry the whole world on your shoulders because you don’t believe in some
sort of higher power, and if you’re depressed as hell, why in the world wouldn’t
you be angry? Change all that and you’ll see some major changes in how
angry you are.
Part VI: Managing Anger 
in Key Relationships
Most of us compartmentalize our day-to-day lives into where we spend the
most time — at work, at home, and in intimate relationships. These three
chapters are designed to address anger-management issues that are situation
specific — what works at work doesn’t necessarily work at home. The benefit
of having one meal a day together as a family, in an effort to reduce family
conflict, may not be achievable in the executive boardroom. What is common
to all three chapters in this section is a set of strategies that are aimed at
turning hostility into harmony.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
If you’re looking for quick ideas about how to raise a non-angry child or
combat road rage, or you just want some easy-to-remember anger-freeing
thoughts, you find them here.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those little pictures in the margins throughout this book, and
they’re there to draw your attention to certain kinds of information:
6
Anger Management For Dummies 

This icon alerts you to important ideas and concepts that you’ll want to
remember and that you can use even when you don’t have Anger
Management For Dummies in hand.
Every once in a while, the scientist in me gets a little chatty, and when I do, 
I mark the paragraph with this icon. You can read these paragraphs if you
want, but the information they contain isn’t essential to your understanding
of the topic at hand.
The Tip icon suggests practical how-to strategies for managing anger.
This icon appears when I think a cautionary note is in order or when you
need to seek professional help.
Where to Go from Here
Each part and chapter in this book is meant to stand alone in its discussion
of anger management. When I was writing, I skipped around, writing chap-
ters in no particular order — when I finished one, I looked at the Table of
Contents to see what interested me next and went with that. Feel free to do
likewise — choose a topic that interests you, and dive in.
If you do read Anger Management For Dummies in its entirety and you still
find that you’re struggling with anger, I suggest you seriously consider getting
the help of a professional. Anger management is a niche market and you need
to find someone who has credentials and expertise in this area. If you’re
interested in a medical remedy for abnormal anger — one that focuses on
prescribed medication — you’ll want to find a psychiatrist who specializes in
this area. If you’re more open to psychotherapeutic strategies (where change
results from an interpersonal relationship between you and a therapist), look
for a licensed clinical psychologist or mental health counselor. Either way, be
sure to get the help you need.

Anger Management For Dummies 

Part I
The Basics
of Anger

In this part . . .
I
talk about why anger is a universal emotion and help
you distinguish between an emotional reaction and an
emotional response. I show you how to quantify just how
angry you are by answering two simple questions: “How
often are you angry?” and “How intense is your anger?”
With the information I provide in this part, you don’t have
to be a rocket scientist to figure out if you suffer from
toxic anger.
Finally, in this part, you can discover the many ways in
which anger can poison your life — robbing you of energy,
affecting your health, derailing your career, and harming
those you love. You may be surprised about what anger
says about your life now and in the future.

Chapter 1
Anger: The Universal Emotion
In This Chapter
 Examining the myths about anger
 Understanding what emotions are
 Getting help when you need it
W
hat do college students, corporate executives, housewives, and prelit-
erate tribesmen in Borneo and New Guinea have in common? They all
recognize an angry face when they see it. Anger — along with joy, fear, sad-
ness, and surprise — is a universal emotion. All cultures around the globe
have anger in their peoples as an integral part of day-to-day life.
Anger is part of the survival mechanism of human beings. When faced with a
threat — not unlike other animals — humans either run away or attack.
Anger is the fuel behind that attack. But anger can also have the opposite
effect and lead to our untimely demise. As Chapter 3 explains, too much
anger can cause heart attacks, precipitate disabling work injuries, and facili-
tate risky sexual behavior. Anger truly is a double-edged sword.
Dispelling Common Anger Myths
Before you can manage your own anger, you need to be aware of what anger
is and isn’t. Unfortunately, myths about anger seem to abound. Here are
some of the myths I want to dispel right from the get-go:
 Males are angrier than females. If by angrier you mean how often
people experience anger, it’s simply not true that men are angrier than
women. Surveys show that women get mad just as frequently as men —
about once or twice a week on average. On the other hand, men tend to
report more intense anger, while women tend to hang on to anger longer.

 Anger is bad. Anger serves a variety of positive purposes when it comes
to coping with stress. It energizes you, improves your communication
with other people, promotes your self-esteem, and defends you against
fear and insecurity. (Jesus, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr., were all
angry men — but they turned that anger into social reform that made
the world a better place.)
 Anger is good. When it leads to domestic violence, property damage,
sexual abuse, drug addiction, ulcers, and self-mutilation, anger is defi-
nitely not good.
 Anger is only a problem when you openly express it. As few as 10 per-
cent of people act out their feelings when they get angry. The other 
90 percent either suppress their anger (“I don’t want to talk about it!”) or
repress their anger (“I’m not angry at all — really!”). People who express
their anger are the squeaky wheels who get everyone’s attention; people
who repress or suppress their anger need anger management just as
much.
 The older you get, the more irritable you are. It’s the other way 
around — as people age, they report fewer negative emotions and
greater emotional control. People — like wine and cheese — do tend to
improve with age.
 Anger is all in the mind. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
Emotions are primarily physical in nature. If anger were only a state of
mind, why would someone say, “I feel like I have a big fist in my chest
when I get that angry”? Believe me, when you get mad, that emotion is
instantly manifested in muscles throughout your entire body, the hairs
on the back of your neck, your blood pressure, your blood sugar levels,
your heart rate, your respiration rate, your gut, even your finger temper-
ature (it warms up!) — long before you’re aware of what’s happening.
 Anger is all about getting even. The most common motive behind anger
has been shown to be a desire to assert authority or independence, or to
improve one’s image — not necessarily to cause harm. Revenge is a sec-
ondary motive. A third motive involves letting off steam over accumu-
lated frustrations — again with no apparent intent to harm anyone else.
 Only certain types of people have a problem with anger. Actually, over
the years I’ve spent helping people with anger management, I’ve worked
with all types of people — truck drivers, college professors, physicians,
housewives, grandmothers, lawyers, policemen, career criminals, poor
people, millionaires, children, the elderly, people of various colors,
nationalities, and religions. Anger is a universal emotion!
 Anger results from human conflict. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. One
of the leading experts on anger has found that people can get angry by
being exposed to foul odors, aches and pains, and hot temperatures —
none of which involve (or can be blamed on) the actions of others.
12
Part I: The Basics of Anger 

Understanding the Role 
of Emotions in Your Life
Emotion is a compound word. The e stands for “energy” and the motion
means exactly what it says — “movement.” Emotions move you to act in ways
that defend you from threat, lead to social attachments and procreation,
cause you to engage in pleasurable pursuits, lead to reattachment after some
type of meaningful loss, and lead you to explore your environment. Without
emotion, life would be at a standstill.
Psychiatrists have a term for people who lack appear to lack emotions —
including anger: It’s alexithymia. Alexithymics tend to:
 Have difficulty identifying different types of feelings
 Appear stiff and wooden in relating to others
 Lack emotional awareness
 Lack enjoyment
 Have trouble distinguishing between emotions and bodily feelings
 Appear overly logical when it comes to decision making
13
Chapter 1: Anger: The Universal Emotion
Putting the focus where it needs to be
For most of my early academic career, like many
other psychologists, I was caught up in the
debate about whether anger was best kept in or
let out. The emphasis of my research at the time
was on how people express their anger and its
impact on health. I was one of the anger-out
proponents (and proud of it!), who was firmly
convinced that venting anger was the right way
to go — better to protest aloud than suffer high
blood pressure or so I thought.
In hindsight, I now see that my colleagues and
I were wrong in our appraisal of what the focus
of anger management should be. What I have
since discovered — more from practice than
science — is that the real culprit when it comes
to anger is how much of it a person experi-
ences. The logic here is simple: If you rarely get
angry; if, when you do, it’s not too intense; and if
it’s over in a minute, it really doesn’t matter
whether you keep it in or let it out. You don’t
have enough of it to cause you, or anyone else,
a problem.
Similarly, if you’re repeatedly angry throughout
the day, your anger is extremely intense, and
you stay that way for the rest of the day or
longer, it doesn’t matter whether you’re an
anger-in or anger-out type — either way you
have a problem. If you keep that much anger in,
you’ll pay a price — in the form of depression,
heart attack, resentment, and so on. If you 
let that much anger out, you’ll pay a different
price — in the form of legal fees, divorce, job
loss, and so on. The mode of expression simply
determines the type of consequences you pay.

 Lack sympathy for others
 Appear perplexed by other people’s emotions
 Be unmoved by art, literature, and music
 Have few, if any, emotional memories (for example, memories of 
childhood)
You want to have emotions but you want to be in control of those emotions.
You want to let anger move you to write a letter to the editor in your local
newspaper about some social injustice. You want your anger to move you to
stand up for yourself when your talents are being exploited in the workplace.
Anger that says to your spouse, “Hey, something is not working here” is 
good for a marriage. But if your anger only moves you to hurt others — or
yourself — then you definitely have a problem. Think of anger as a tool that
can help you throughout life if you know how to use it — and think of Anger
Management For Dummies as a reference on how best to use that tool.
Getting the Help You Need
Everybody needs support — nobody can go through life completely alone.
When you’re embarking on a major change in your life, the help of other
people is especially important. And believe me, managing your anger is a
major life change.
14
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
Habituation: It can be a bitch
The worst thing about bad things — including a
bad temper — is that you get used to them, and
that makes it difficult for you to change.
Overweight people know they need to lose
weight, but they continue eating too much (and
exercising too little) nevertheless. Smokers
know that they’re killing themselves with every
drag on those cigarettes, but very few quit. The
same goes for alcoholics and drug addicts and
people who are addicted to gambling. People
even get accustomed to poverty and illiteracy.
Call it complaisance, inertia, a lack of will
power, or not wanting to leave your comfort
zone — it all amounts to the same thing: a built-
in resistance to change.
I believe in being honest with my angry clients,
so I tell them from the outset that it’s far easier
to stay the same than it is to change. So, if
you’re looking for the easy way out, stay like you
are and live with the consequences. Not chang-
ing requires absolutely no energy, motivation, or
commitment on your part — but change does.
If you think you’re up to it, this book is for you —
and the rewards will be amazing. As a friend of
mine who struggled for years with a bad temper
said, “Since I took control of my anger, I have a
peaceful mind. I don’t have to go to bed every
night wondering what I have to do to get even
with someone.” What a wonderful testimony to
the power of anger management.

Support comes in many forms. To manage your anger effectively, you need all
the following kinds of support:
 Emotional support: You need people who are behind you 100 percent,
people who know about your problems with anger and are cheering you
on as you figure out how to manage it.
 Informational support: You can have the best of intentions, but if you
don’t have the information you need about anger and how to manage it,
you won’t get far. Lucky for you, you hold in your hands all the informa-
tion you need to get a handle on your anger.
 Tangible support: Sometimes you need some hands-on support. An
angry mother who is on the verge of losing her temper and abusing her
child can sure use a neighbor who can step in and become a surrogate
parent while mom goes somewhere and cools off.
 Appraisal support: You need people who are willing to give you honest
feedback about your anger, as well as how much improvement you’ve
made — no matter how small.
Here’s how you can garner all the support you need in order to succeed at
anger management:
 Keep in mind that most people want to be supportive — they’re just
waiting on you to give them an opportunity. Take the initiative and 
ask your closest friends and family members for their support. Support
that goes unrecognized or unused does you no good. Most people have
far more support than they take advantage of. This is no time to think, 
“I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.” Believe me, you’re more of a
burden when you’re angry than when you’re not!
 Be willing to give support to your friends and family in turn. Support
must be reciprocal. In order to receive it, you must give it.
 Keep in mind that no one person can satisfy all your support needs.
One person may be able to offer emotional support, while another may
help out in a more tangible way.
Don’t be too surprised if, at first, you have trouble getting support for your
efforts at anger management. Remember: You’ve probably hurt a lot of
people with your anger over the years — and they may have some lingering
resentment, fear, and uncertainty. That’s natural. But if you’re truly commit-
ted to managing your anger, chances are they’ll eventually rally to your
cause.
15
Chapter 1: Anger: The Universal Emotion

You’ll Know When You’re There
Often, people who have been successful at anger management have a hard time
appreciating just how far they’ve come in their emotional life. I’ve made great
strides in managing my own anger over the past several years — something 
my wife and kids appreciate very much! — but I really didn’t understand how
healthy I was until I recently had a moment of full-blown rage at a social event. 
I found myself so angry I couldn’t speak for fear of what awful things would
come out of my mouth and, as if that wasn’t enough, I experienced mild 
chest pain that took an hour or so to go away.
Believe me, it took all the skills I outline in this book to calm down and regain
some semblance of emotional equilibrium. I had forgotten what that level of
anger felt like and it scared me. But after it subsided and I thought about it, 
I realized that the reason it got my attention and felt so awful was because
this was the first time in years that I’d experienced what, earlier in my life
was, regrettably, an all-too-usual part of my day.
One way you know you’re succeeding in managing your anger is when you
begin to realize that things that used to set you off no longer do. Another 
way you know you’ve changed is when people who know you well begin 
to give you unsolicited positive feedback about your improved temperament.
And you know you’ve succeeded when that angry “fist” you feel in your chest
day after day is no longer there — replaced by an abiding sense of inner
peace.
In many respects, the work of anger management is never done — you’re
always a work in progress. Every day is an opportunity to exercise your
anger-management muscles.

When Is Anger a Problem?
In This Chapter
 Quantifying your anger
 Identifying the three categories of toxic anger
 Finding out if you’re at risk for problematic anger
H
ow do you know when you have an anger problem? Some people would
say that any time you get angry, that’s a problem. Others would dis-
agree, arguing that anger is never a problem as long as it communicates that
something is wrong in your life.
Stan came to see me because his wife (and her therapist) thought he wasn’t
emotional enough. She wanted him to be more in touch with his feelings so
they could experience a deeper level of intimacy in their marriage. Well, she
got her wish. In no time, Stan was talking about all sorts of emotions he’d
kept under wraps for years. Then, one day, his wife asked if she could join us.
Stan agreed, so in she came. Right off the bat, she let me know in no uncer-
tain terms how dissatisfied (read: angry) she was about how Stan’s therapy
was going. “All he does now is tell me how irritated he is with me and I’m sick
of it,” she explained. “But I thought you wanted him to be more emotional,” I
replied. “I did, but I didn’t want to hear about his anger — just the positive
emotions. He can keep his anger to himself. That’s his problem,” she added.
Ellie rarely shows any expression of anger — she’s too nice a person. She has
never cussed anyone out or struck anyone in a moment of rage. On the other
hand, she is often disgusted with herself, distressed about her life in general,
and disillusioned by what is going on at her current job. Ellie definitely has a
problem with anger, but you’d have to be a detective to know it — her anger
is disguised.
In this chapter, I take all the mystery out of trying to decide who does and
does not have too much anger. You can easily quantify your experience with
anger so you can tell if you have a problem that needs managing. All you have
to do is answer a couple of simple questions, do a little math, and — voila! —
you have your answer.

Evaluating How Angry You Are
Everyone gets angry. After all, anger is one of those universal emotions —
along with sadness, joy, and fear — that people throughout the world recog-
nize when they see or hear it. But you and I may not experience anger to the
same degree — and that’s really the crux of what this book is about. What
you need to determine is exactly how angry you are.
To do this, you first have to agree on what anger is and what it isn’t. Anger is
often defined as:
 The emotion you reserve for your enemies
 The emotion that most often accompanies or precedes aggressive
behavior
 The emotion that triggers the fight component of your nervous system’s
fight-or-flight response
 The emotion that is the opposite of fear
 The emotion that expresses itself in revenge
 The emotion that signals that you feel personally threatened
 The emotion that’s associated with blame
 The emotion that’s negative in tone
 The emotion that can be deadly when it comes to your health
 The emotion that gets your blood boiling
18
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
I wish it were simple
As the reader, I know you’d like a simple answer
to the question “Why am I so angry, and what’s
the single most effective thing I can do about
it?” You’re hoping that one chapter in this book
will provide that answer. But, alas, that’s not the
way it works.
Anger is a complex human emotion. By reading
this book, you can come to understand where
your anger is coming from — that is, which and
how many of those factors that are unique to
you are at work here. It may be three things:
youth, poor communication, and substance
abuse, for example. Or it may be half a dozen —
poor coping skills, a life that is sorely out of bal-
ance, a cynical outlook, too few sources of sup-
port, the fact that you’re a guy, and a high-stress
job. The important thing at this point is to find the
right recipe for anger management and to use
the information and resources in this book to
bring your emotional life to a better place.

 The emotion that you’re most afraid of
 The emotion that expresses the combative side of your personality
 The emotion that everyone else around you is most afraid of
 The emotion that always does more harm than good
Anger, on the other hand, is not the same as:
 Hostility: An attitude of ill will synonymous with cynicism, mistrust, and
paranoia
 Aggression or violence: Various types of behavior that are always
intended to inflict harm on others
I also have to distinguish between the experience of anger and the expression
of anger. In this chapter, you only need to focus on evaluating the degree to
which you experience anger — how often you have this feeling and how
strong it is. In other chapters throughout this book, you focus more on how
you express it — what you do with your anger.
How often do you get angry?
Start by answering the following question.
How often during a typical week in the past month did you get irritated,
mad, or angry?
A. Not at all
B. Once or twice a week
C. Three to five times a week
D. One or two times a day
E. Three times a day
F. Four or five times a day
G. Six to ten times a day
H. More than ten times a day
Be honest. And don’t just think of the times you flew into a rage — think of all
the times you felt even the least bit angry.
If you answered A, B, or C, your anger is within a healthy, normal range. If you
answered D, E, F, G, or H, your anger is probably excessive (you’re angrier
than 75 percent of most people I have surveyed).
19
Chapter 2: When Is Anger a Problem?

Most people tend to underestimate the extent to which they feel things. This
is partially due to memory — only the more dramatic episodes of anger come
to mind. Also, anger is one of those emotions everyone wants to forget as
quickly as possible. Make sure that you’re being honest with yourself about
how often you feel angry.
How intense is your anger?
Now you need to evaluate the strength of your anger. Think about how you
feel most of the time when you get angry and answer this question honestly:
On average, how intense is your anger when you get mad? (Circle one)
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Mild
Extreme
If your intensity rating is 6 or below, your anger is within a healthy, normal
range. If your intensity rating is 7 or above, you likely have a problem with
anger.
Of course, your anger may be more intense in some situations than others.
But, by and large, feelings tend to be consistent from one episode of emotion
to the next. We humans, after all, are creatures of habit!
Figuring Out Whether 
Your Anger Is Toxic
I coined the term toxic anger to convey the fact that certain subtypes of anger
can be poisonous, even lethal (see Chapter 3 for an in-depth discussion of
toxic anger). Other forms of anger are benign (nontoxic) and really cannot
hurt you in any appreciable way. The trick is to know which is which.
20
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
Annoyances count
In one study where 50 college students were
asked to keep a weekly diary of how often they
got annoyed or angry, they recorded 1,536
instances of emotion. The average student
reported getting angry seven times a week,
roughly once a day. However, the average 
student also reported feeling annoyed 24 times
a week or approximately 3 times a day. In other
words, their report of anger was four times
greater when they included milder forms of
emotions like annoyance.

First, go to the “How often do you get angry?” section, earlier in this chapter,
where you indicate how frequently you find yourself getting angry during a
typical week. If you selected A, B, or C — “Not at all” up to “Three to five
times a week” — your anger can be considered intermittent or episodic in
nature. If you checked any of the other answers — “One or two times a day”
through “More than ten times a day” — your anger is chronic. Generally
speaking, episodic anger isn’t a problem, but chronic anger is.
Now, go to the “How intense is your anger?” section, where you rate the
intensity of your anger. If your intensity rating was between 1 and 3, I call that
irritability. If your rating was between 4 and 6, I call that anger. And, if you
rated yourself between 7 and 10, I call that rage. Rage is always a problem.
When two or more people admit to being angry, obviously they aren’t talking
about having the exact same emotional experience. Anger is just a word — a
fairly meaningless concept — until you break it down into something that can
be quantified.
Here’s where things get interesting. The final step in evaluating whether you
have a problem with anger is to combine your anger scores in a way that gen-
erates six possible subcategories of anger. These are illustrated in Table 2-1.
Table 2-1

Chronic rage
Which category did you fall into? Does it make the problem more real when
you put these types of labels on it? I find that most people are comfortable
with terms like irritated and angry, but they don’t like the label rage at all.
There’s something equally unsettling about the label chronic. And when you
put the two together, people really jump out of their seats! In the following
sections, I help you see beyond the labels.
Episodic irritation
In a community sample, I found that roughly 25 percent of 284 people sur-
veyed fell into this category. That is, one out of every four people are like
Cathy, a woman in her 60s, who seldom finds herself experiencing even mild
anger. Everyone regards her as upbeat, cheerful, easygoing, and pleasant to
be around. No problem here. If you fall into this category, your anger is not
toxic.
21
Chapter 2: When Is Anger a Problem?

Episodic anger
Slightly more than a third (36 percent) of those sampled acknowledged the
fact that they got angry a couple of times a week. However, like Peter, their
anger never amounted to anything. Sure, Peter gets mad on occasion — like
when his secretary spoils his mood by starting the day off with some nega-
tive remark — but he doesn’t dwell on it and it passes fairly quickly. If you fall
into this category, your anger is not toxic.
Episodic rage
This is our first glimpse at what I call toxic anger. Approximately 15 percent
of the sample readily admitted to getting this angry on occasion, although
not daily. I like to refer to these individuals as sleeping lions or occasional 
hotheads — they’re fine until they get aroused, and then watch out!
Chronic irritation
You may think that chronic irritation is a problem, but it’s really not all that
toxic. People may see you as moody or bitchy, but they still tolerate you
most of the time. Interestingly, only about 2 percent of people fall in this 
category — thank goodness.
Chronic anger
This is the second category of toxic anger. It included 11 percent of those sur-
veyed, people like Nathan, a retired salesman who finds himself getting angry
repeatedly every day about one thing or another. “I get mad when my wife
takes too long shopping, when things break around the house, when gas
prices go up — just about anything that doesn’t suit me,” he says. “But don’t
get me wrong — I don’t go off the deep end and rant and rave.” Like many
people, Nathan thinks he doesn’t have a problem with anger because it never
rises to the level of uncontrollable rage — but he’s wrong. It’s just not healthy
to be angry as frequently as he is.
Chronic rage
This is our worst-case example of toxic anger. I’m sorry to say that 12 percent
of those responding fell into this subgroup. If you find yourself in this group,
your anger is volatile (as in volcano!) and there’s absolutely no question that
anger is poisoning just about every aspect of your life. This type of anger is
dangerous and serves no useful purpose.
22
Part I: The Basics of Anger 

The term anger management is really a misnomer. The vast majority of people
referred for this type of therapy are experiencing rage, not anger. If I could
get them to just get angry when something provokes them, that would be
progress.
Calculating the Risks of Toxic Anger
You can calculate how at risk you are for toxic anger. Review the following
sections and see how many of these factors fit you.
Are you male?
Men and women don’t differ in how often they get angry, but men do tend to
experience anger more intensely than women at all ages. Thus, men are more
likely to experience rage as opposed to irritability or anger.
Are you under 40 years of age?
There really are some benefits to growing older. As Table 2-2 illustrates, the
frequency and intensity of anger both tend to decrease with age — people
actually do mellow over time. Anger is a much bigger problem during the
adolescent and young adult years (ages 13 to 39) and begins to decline
steadily thereafter for most people. It’s not that unusual for children and ado-
lescents to throw temper tantrums, but if you’re still doing that at age 60, you
definitely have a problem.
23
Chapter 2: When Is Anger a Problem?
Students versus teachers
If you want to know why there are so many
problems in public schools these days, consider
this. I surveyed high school teachers and stu-
dents alike and found that only 5 percent of 
the teachers admitted to experiencing rage as 
contrasted with 30 percent of the students.
That’s a lot of rage floating around the school
environment every day — and the teachers are
clearly outmatched.

50–59
1–2 times/week
4 (mildly angry)
60+
1–2 times/week
3 (irritated, annoyed)
Are you temperamental?
Temperament defines inherited, inborn traits that basically describe the tone
or quality of your emotional reactions. The two traits that set people up for
toxic anger are impulsivity (an inability to delay gratification or tolerate frus-
tration when your needs are not immediately satisfied) and excitability (how
easily your emotions are triggered). More good news: Both of these traits
decrease with age.
Do you have too many opportunities 
to get mad?
Common sense tells you that the more provocation you have in life, the more
opportunity you have to be angry. Take, for example, policemen who spend
their days trying to get citizens to obey the law and who put up with a lot of
abuse in the process. What about schoolteachers who have to put up with
defiant, unmotivated children all day? Even pharmacists — I see more angry
people waiting for prescriptions in the local drugstore than almost anywhere
else I go (“What do you mean my doctor didn’t call in my medication?” and 
“I can’t believe drugs are so expensive — do you people think I’m made of
money?”). The same goes for family and intimate relationships — some are
more burdened with problems than others.
Are you looking at life the wrong way?
Anger is in the eye of the beholder. It’s not the things that happen to you that
make you angry as much as it is the way you respond to those things. Here
are four ways of looking at the world that tend to facilitate anger:
24
Part I: The Basics of Anger 

 With cynicism: Do you wake up every morning expecting (and preparing
yourself for) the worst? Do you anticipate that good things are not in
store for you today? Do you mistrust your fellow man — even your loved
ones? Are you constantly on guard in case other people somehow take
advantage of you? If this sounds familiar, you’re ready to react in anger
at a moment’s notice.
 As though everything is a catastrophe: Would you agree that there are
no little stresses in life? A friend was ten minutes late meeting you for
lunch — everything is a big damned deal! What others might regard as a
minor irritant, you see as a major life crisis. If so, the intensity of your
emotions — panic, rage — reflect just how overwhelmed you feel most
of the time.
 With compulsiveness: Do you ascribe to the philosophy that “every-
thing in life is either black or white” and “it’s my way or the highway?”
Do you demand perfection in yourself and everyone around you? Are
you all work and no play? Do you eat, sleep, and breathe one thing: con-
trol? Are you always exhausted and never able to relax? No wonder you
get angry so easily.
 With self-absorption: Is your life really “all about me”? Are you the
center of your own little universe? Are the rest of us just here to serve
your needs? If we do that well, fortune smiles on us, right? But if we
don’t tell you what you want to hear, don’t make you feel “special,” or —
dare I say it — talk about ourselves, there’s hell to pay. If this sounds
familiar, anger is not far away.
Do you have an aggressive personality?
If so, you’ll experience more anger than if you don’t. How can you tell if you
have an aggressive personality? You have an aggressive personality if the fol-
lowing are true:
 You’re competitive.
 You like to dominate others.
 You’re impatient.
 You’re intense.
 You’re demanding.
 You’re confrontational.
 You’re forceful in pursuing goals.
If you’re not sure about this one, ask someone who knows you well what he
thinks — but don’t get angry if he tells you the truth!
25
Chapter 2: When Is Anger a Problem?

Are you taking the wrong kinds of drugs?
Drugs — even legal drugs — alter brain chemistry and can lead to anger.
Here’s a list of some drugs to watch out for:
 Alcohol
 Caffeine
 Nicotine
 Tranquilizers (such as Valium)
 Cocaine
 Chemical inhalants
 Phencyclidine (PCP)
 Hypnotics
 Sedatives
Do you stay irritable?
By irritable, I don’t mean irritated. Irritable is synonymous with a general
feeling of being:
 Grouchy
 Sensitive
26
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
Of course you’re angry — you’re on top
I was asked to consult with a corporation
whose CEO was having difficulty getting his top
executives to curtail their anger in day-to-day
discussions. With considerable exasperation,
he acknowledged that he, in fact, had on more
than one occasion served as a referee between
two angry vice-presidents who were engaged
in a physical confrontation in the men’s room.
His question to me: “I pay these guys a good
salary and they have all the freedom in the
world, so why are they acting like this?” It didn’t
take me long to find the answer. Actually, it 
was quite simple. All of them were extremely
aggressive personalities who had clawed their
way to the top of the organization through a
combination of what I like to call achievement-
driven and combative behavior. And anger was
the fuel — the ammunition, if you will — that got
them to where they were and kept them there.

 Touchy
 Cross
 On edge
 Unsettled
 Uneasy
 Tense
 Ill
 Crabby
 Agitated
 Aggravated
Irritability is a nonspecific state of physical and mental discomfort that is
often the byproduct of life itself — hot weather, insufficient finances, hang-
over, being sick, chronic pain due to arthritis or migraine headaches, bore-
dom, secondhand smoke, memories of past hurts and grievances, being
overweight, and so on. The point I’m making here is that a highly irritable
person is a person waiting to be angry.
Are you suffering from depression?
Mood and emotion go hand in hand. If you’re in a positive, euphoric mood,
you’re apt to feel positive emotions like joy and excitement. If you’re in a neg-
ative, dysphoric mood, the opposite, of course, is true — you’re more dis-
posed to emotions such as sadness and anger. So, it doesn’t take a rocket
scientist to understand why depression and anger are so closely linked. If
you’re suffering from what psychiatrists call agitated depression, you’ll experi-
ence anger often and express it in outrageous ways. If you have what’s called
retarded depression, you’ll retreat into a world of angry silence. Either way,
anger is a big part of your sickness.
Do you communicate poorly?
Do you have a hard time saying what’s on your mind, but have no trouble
whatsoever lashing out emotionally? Do you often find yourself saying things
like “Get off my back, dammit!” or “I’ve had it with you people — you make
me sick!” when what you really should be saying is, “I’m about to lose my job,
I’m scared to death about our future, and I don’t know where to turn”? Anger
communicates all right, but not too effectively.
27
Chapter 2: When Is Anger a Problem?

Do you lack problem-solving skills?
Are you the type of person who wastes a lot of time and energy getting mad
instead of fixing all the things that are wrong with your life? If so, you’re a
member of a very large club. Quite frankly, I’ve never understood how anger
gets the bills paid, repairs a flat tire, or gets a person out of a toxic relation-
ship. Do you? Wouldn’t it be better to save the anger or at least use it con-
structively to figure out a budget, change the tire, and tell your jerk of a
partner to shape up or ship out?
Are you too stressed?
Life is, by its very nature, stressful — but it’s fair to say that some folks have
more stress than others. Actually, it’s the little irritants of life (psychologists
refer to these as hassles) that upset us the most; most people handle the big
stresses (critical life events, in psychobabble) pretty well. And then there are
different types of stress, some more linked to anger than others. Stresses that
persist over time (chronic), that build up over time (cumulative), that are
beyond your control and thus tend to overwhelm you (catastrophic) are the
real killers. Sound familiar?
Are you too judgmental?
Anger, like other emotions, is a judgment. When you get angry, you’re judging
other people (“You treated me badly”) and situations (“This just doesn’t
suit”). Anger is a statement — your statement — about right and wrong. 
The more you judge the world, the more likely you’ll be angry — about 
something.
Are you too much into blame?
Are you quick to assign blame to someone or something every time you
suffer misfortune? Do you earnestly believe that there are no accidents in 
life — that everything is the result of someone else’s intentional desire to
frustrate, mislead, or inflict harm on someone else? Are you forever reading
some sinister motive into what others say and do that ends up hurting some-
one’s feelings? Are you a proponent of the idea that we’re all suffering at the
hand of some kind of conspiracy? Then no wonder you’re always mad — and
preoccupied with thoughts about how to even the score.
28
Part I: The Basics of Anger 

Are you constantly exhausted?
Are you like Pete, the 32-year-old factory worker who referred himself for
anger management because he thought anger was endangering his marriage?
Pete didn’t have a clue as to why he was so irritable all the time and quick to
attack his wife over any little thing. Among other things, I asked him if he
liked the kind of work he did and he said, “It’s okay except for the fact that
we’re working seven days a week, ten hours a day.” And how long had that
schedule been in effect? Five months. The poor guy wasn’t just tired — he
was exhausted! And that, of course, made every other thing in his life a
strain. What was the message behind Pete’s anger? Simple: “I’m dead. I can’t
take any more. I need a break!”
Do you have an inadequate 
support system?
I can only imagine that your life is a struggle — mine is. And in that struggle,
we all need help — help in the form of a kind word now and then, some tangi-
ble assistance (like a ride to the doctor or a loan until payday), some sense of
belonging to a world larger than ourselves, or someone to reassure us at criti-
cal times in our lives that we’re simply okay and that this too shall pass.
But what if you don’t have that support? What if you’re struggling all alone,
out there on a limb by yourself? Wouldn’t you be angry — angry that you
don’t have something (a resource) that other people do, angry that you have
to reach out for help because no one is reaching out to you, angry at God for
allowing your life to come to this end? Sure, you would — and you are.
29
Chapter 2: When Is Anger a Problem?
Blame = anger = pain
For over 40 years now, I have worked with
patients who suffer chronic, often disabling pain
resulting mostly from work injuries. I can attest
to the fact that they are an extremely angry
group of folks. Fifty-two percent of those who
completed my five-week outpatient rehab pro-
gram, for example, admitted to experiencing
either episodic or chronic rage. Why is this 
relevant? Because studies have shown that
work-injured patients who blame someone for
their injury are less likely to remain employed,
more likely to feel they received no benefit from
medical treatment, more likely to suffer from
psychological distress, more likely to anticipate
greater pain and disability in the future, and less
optimistic about further improvement. Those
who had a no-fault view of their injury fared
much better.

Is your life seriously out of balance?
Is your life all yin and no yang? Are there too many downs and not enough
ups? Do you seem to habitually give more than you take? Are you all work
and no play? Is there no room in your life for pleasure, frivolity, or those
moments when you simply enjoy the ridiculous side of life? Do you spend far
more time with clients and customers than you do with friends and loved
ones? Well then, your life is obviously way out of balance. And until you cor-
rect that imbalance, you’re a sitting duck for anger.
30
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
What’d you say?
At the end of every first session I have with a
new client — especially those who’ve come for
help with anger management — I say, “Tell me
what you do for fun.” I invariably get one of the
following four answers:
 “Huh?”
 “What did you say?”
 “I’m paying $85 an hour for this.”
 “Nothing!”
And, therein lies their problem.

A
nger Kills. The title of a book by my colleague, Dr. Redford Williams, and
his wife, Virginia, turned out to be prophetic for Dwayne, who died an
untimely death at age 41. Dwayne injured his back at work 11 years earlier
and had been unemployed and in constant pain ever since. He was also a
very angry man — angry about being hurt, angry that his doctors couldn’t fix
his back, angry about being mistreated by his employer, angry at family and
friends who he felt weren’t sympathetic enough, even angry at God for allow-
ing this whole unfortunate circumstance to occur so early in his life.
Dwayne isolated himself from the world. He stayed home most of the time,
refused to return telephone calls from friends, and ruminated about how
badly his life had turned out. All you had to do was ask him something about
his former life (for example, “Do you still see any of your old friends from
work?”), and Dwayne’s rage was immediately visible. He suddenly had this
contorted look on his face, tears came into his eyes, and his tone of voice ele-
vated almost to a shout as he responded, “Hell no!”
Dwayne had his first heart attack at age 36. He was walking down the street
when he saw one of his “enemies” from his old job, and he instantly fell down
clutching his chest. He was taken by ambulance to the local hospital, where
he told his family physician that he had gotten intensely angry when he 
saw that person and then felt a sharp pain in his chest. The doctor didn’t
believe him.

Dwayne continued his angry ways and had a second heart attack at age 41.
Surrounded in the hospital by his cardiologist, psychologist, minister,
brother, and wife, Dwayne was given an ultimatum: “Let go of all this anger or
you’re going to die. Your heart can’t take it anymore.” Once again, his face
took on that all-too-familiar look, his eyes teared up, and he forecast his own
death by saying, “Never. I’ll never stop being angry. I’ll die first.”
Three weeks later, while shouting angrily into the telephone, Dwayne had his
third and final heart attack. Moments later, his wife found him dead on the
floor, the phone still in his hand.
In this chapter, I show you the many ways in which anger can be toxic. I also
discuss the secondhand effects of toxic anger — they’re as dangerous to your
health as secondhand smoke. If you find yourself feeling like a battery that is
losing its charge, if you can’t seem to lose weight or stop smoking, if you have
headaches all the time, if you’re taking blood-pressure medication, if you’re
concerned about the health of your loved ones, or if your career seems like a
train wreck, you’ll find this chapter especially enlightening.
Robbing Your Energy
Anger and fatigue go hand in hand. Emotions spend energy. The body
requires energy to mobilize itself into an attack posture — heart pounding,
blood pressure up, muscles tense from head to toe. By its very nature, anger
excites you. Your adrenaline flows. And afterward comes the recovery, where
you feel physically drained — exhausted.
Now, imagine that you suffer from chronic anger. You go through this vicious
cycle of excitation and exhaustion several times every day. Consider how
much of your energy is being robbed by this intrusive emotion! It makes me
tired just thinking about it.
If you want the proof, in one study, 67 percent of not-very-angry people woke
up feeling fresh and rested each morning. Among their counterparts, the
angry people, only 33 percent woke up feeling fresh and rested. When asked
if they ever feel like a battery that’s losing its charge, 56 percent of the not-
very-angry people said yes, compared to 78 percent of the angry people.
Steve sat and quietly watched the older man angrily bite the pharmacist’s
head off because he would have to wait a while to have his prescription filled.
“You people don’t know what you’re doing,” “You’re inefficient,” and “I don’t
have time to be sitting here because you can’t do your job right” were just a
few of his heated comments. As the older man sat down next to him, Steve
volunteered, “You feel terrible don’t you? Drained. Worn out by all that emo-
tion. I know. I’ve been there, my friend. But, you know, it’s not worth it — it
really isn’t.” Later, he told his wife, “Guess who I ran into today? My old,
angry self!”

Part I: The Basics of Anger 

Making You Ill
The link between emotion and physical health can be both direct and indirect.
Anger, for example, has an instantaneous effect on your blood pressure —
but that effect is short lived and generally doesn’t cause any immediate
harm. Anger also elevates blood pressure through its link to smoking and
obesity — and, that effect is permanent.
In the following sections, I fill you in on the damage anger may be doing to
your health.
How anger indirectly affects your health
The best example of how anger can indirectly make you sick has to do with
your risk for having a heart attack. People who smoke cigarettes, are over-
weight, have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, or drink alcohol (or
some combination of these) are at greater risk for some type of coronary
episode — chest pain, heart attack, stroke associated with a history of heart
disease. Anger contributes to all these risk factors.
Your risk, of course, is determined not by any one of these factors, but by
how many you have operating in your life at any point. Jot down your
answers to the following questions:
 Have you smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days?
 Do you have two or more alcoholic drinks at one sitting?
 Has a doctor ever told you that you have high blood pressure?
 Are you currently being treated for high blood pressure?
 Has a doctor ever told you that you have high cholesterol?
 Are you currently being treated for high cholesterol?

Vital exhaustion: Vital to avoid
Dutch medical researchers have coined the
term vital exhaustion to describe a pattern of
symptoms — excessive fatigue, increased irri-
tability, and feelings of demoralization — that
often precede a heart attack. They found that
vital exhaustion and chronic anger separately
increase a person’s chances of sudden cardiac
death by 42 percent. But together they increase
it even more — a whopping 69 percent. This
held true even when they considered other risk
factors such as high blood pressure, smoking,
diabetes, and cholesterol.

 Do you consider yourself overweight?
 Do you consider yourself obese?
It may surprise you to know that your answer to all these questions may
reflect how much anger there is in your life. In the following sections, 
I explain.
Smoking
Your risk for being a cigarette smoker, believe it or not, is 65 percent higher if
you typically experience intense anger (rage) than if you typically experience
mild anger (irritation).
Using nicotine reduces the likelihood that you’ll react aggressively when
you’re provoked to anger. That’s the good news. The bad news is that smok-
ing is linked to heart disease (and cancer!). Angry smokers are far less likely
to succeed in their attempts to quit smoking than non-angry smokers. In one
published study, the risk of dropping out of treatment early or continuing to
smoke after treatment was 12 times greater for angry smokers. Finally, anger
is the second leading cause of relapse among ex-smokers — less than
stress/anxiety but greater than depression.
Being hooked on cigarettes may also mean that you’re hooked on anger.
Drinking
Alcohol is a risk factor for heart disease, and alcohol consumption is higher
in people who experience intense anger. Among people with only mild anger,
only 22 percent have two or more alcoholic drinks at a time, whereas 44 per-
cent of their intensely angry counterparts drink that much.
Alcohol is a numbing agent when it comes to emotions. People drink to forget
not only their troubles but also what they’re feeling at the moment — sadness,
anxiety, shame, guilt, and anger. The more you drink, the less connected you are
to those feelings. Most people don’t drink to make themselves feel good — they
drink to feel less bad.
Alice was well into middle age before she finally admitted she had a drinking
problem and got the help she needed to get sober. For years, Alice blamed
her excessive use of alcohol on her domineering mother and her equally
angry, overbearing husband — both of whom provided her with a convenient
excuse to continue drinking. What she failed to realize all along was that the
real driving force behind her drinking was her own aggressive personality —
and abiding anger — which she suppressed by staying intoxicated. Alcohol
allowed Alice to be nice to the very people with whom she was the most
angry. Ironically, all of this came to light only after she began accompanying
her husband to anger-management therapy — something he was now willing
to do since she had gotten sober. A further irony was the fact that, as her
husband began to control his temper, she began to lose hers.
34
Part I: The Basics of Anger 

If you plan to continue to drink alcohol but you’re concerned about anger,
consider the following:
 Contrary to popular belief, alcohol initially acts as a stimulant, lead-
ing to increased arousal and excitation in the person who is drinking.
This increased state of arousal may set the stage for an angry reaction to
some otherwise innocuous event or circumstance.
 Alcohol — even in small quantities — can cause you to misperceive
the motives and actions of others. What might otherwise be viewed as
unintended or accidental is now seen as intended to inflict harm.
 Alcohol has a disinhibitory effect on emotions and behavior. It lowers
the nervous system’s threshold for emotional experiences, allowing you
to feel things you otherwise would not if you were sober. It also trans-
forms behavior and makes you feel you have the “right” to act opposite
to your normal self — the quiet person becomes loud, the submissive
person becomes dominant, the sweet person becomes angry.
 Alcohol affects mood in the aftermath of drinking. That is, if you’re a
heavy drinker, you can expect to feel more depressed after you sober up
than if you use less alcohol.
 If you are what’s called an angry drinker — you get angry when you
drink — you can expect to have a more intense hangover afterward.
Angry drinkers are much more apt to experience headaches, stomach
discomfort, diarrhea, tremors, and nervousness when they sober up.
This is particularly true for men, but then again men are more likely to
fit the angry-drinker profile.
Two drinks a day is considered moderate drinking. Anything more than this
is excessive.
Obesity
Do you head for the refrigerator or the nearest fast-food restaurant when
something pisses you off? If you do, you’re not alone! Food is, unfortunately,
the solution that millions of people choose to satisfy their anger. Obesity is
yet another risk factor for heart disease.
Amy, a nice married woman in her mid-40s, is a self-acknowledged emotional
eater. She currently weighs 100 pounds more than she did when she got mar-
ried 20 years ago. She constantly finds herself stifling her feelings — even
positive ones — because of her husband’s discomfort with any open expres-
sion of emotion. Hiding emotion under a façade of niceness is unnatural for
Amy, who was raised in a family where everyone sat around the dinner table
and shared their thoughts and feelings with each other. She lives in emotional
isolation day after day, self-medicating with food as a means of assuaging her
pent-up anger. “I hold in my anger as long as I can — usually for three to six
months — but then I blow up and let it all out at once,” she says. But then the
cycle begins all over again. Bottom line: “I can’t imagine how many hundreds
of pounds I have put on and taken off because of all this anger, but it’s a lot.”
35
Chapter 3: Is Anger Poisoning Your Life?

People like Amy use food both to comfort themselves when they’re upset
with the world and also as a distraction — in her case, mostly from the anger
she feels toward her husband. In an attempt to hide her anger, Amy is literally
transformed into a larger-than-life person whose health is now at risk. If
you’re like Amy, check out Chapters 5 and 8 in this book, which address the
perils of suppressed anger.
High blood pressure
People who have high blood pressure have a much higher risk for heart dis-
ease. And people who are habitually angry have a much higher risk for high
blood pressure — in fact, three times the risk! (Only 15 percent of not-very-
angry people have high blood pressure, whereas 44 percent of their highly
anger counterparts have high blood pressure.)
The way you respond to anger also affects your blood pressure. If you keep it
in, your odds of having hypertension are 21 percent. If you let it out, your
odds are only 11 percent. Of course, how you let it out can make a difference
too (Chapter 11 talks about how to do this constructively).
High cholesterol
Anger doesn’t cause you to have high cholesterol, which places you at risk
for heart disease. That basically comes from your family history. But there is
no question that anger aggravates the problem. When I asked people to tell
us about how intense their anger was typically and whether or not they had
high cholesterol, only 15 percent of people with low anger had high choles-
terol, compared to 22 percent of the highly angry group.
Plus, medical studies have consistently shown that high levels of anger
among Type A personalities — not their sense of time urgency or overcom-
mitment to work — are related to elevated levels of total cholesterol and LDL
(“bad”) cholesterol.
36
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
Poor health habits
Researchers at the University of Texas Health
Science Center at Houston have concluded that
overweight kids, especially girls, have poor
health habits “including anger expression” that
contribute to a lifetime of obesity. Whereas non-
obese adolescents show greater control over
their anger as they grow up, overweight teens
lag behind. They are able to acknowledge their
angry feelings, but they can’t express those
feelings in an appropriate way. For these kids,
anger management is just as important as diet
and exercise.

When your physician tells you that you need to lose weight and start exercis-
ing to lower your cholesterol levels, you should follow his advice. But you
should also consider the potential benefit of anger management in achieving
the same result.
How anger directly affects your health
Emotions are not only distracting, but they can interfere with reason and
cause you to make decisions or take actions that end up being hazardous to
your health. In the following sections, I cover three of the primary behaviors
that can directly result from uncontrolled anger.
Unsafe sex
Most people are well aware of the hazards associated with unprotected
sexual intercourse, having sex with multiple partners, or having sex while
under the influence of drugs. You know that all these behaviors raise your
odds of becoming HIV-infected and possibly dying of AIDS (not to mention
contracting other sexually transmitted diseases [STDs]).
High-risk sex, it turns out, is often accompanied by anger. When women, for
example, are presented with an opportunity for unsafe sex — and they are
not angry at the time — they typically abstain or take reasonable precautions
such as using a condom. They weigh the consequences and act accordingly.
But if they are mad — for example, at a parent who has forbidden them to
continue a relationship with their boyfriend — all that reason flies out the
window. It’s the old “I’ll show you I can do anything I want with whomever 
I want — so there!” mentality.
On-the-job injuries
You’ll likely spend most of your adult life working. So if you’re injured, it’s
most likely to occur on the job — and that’s true no matter what you do for a
living. So, what does that have to do with anger? As it turns out, a whole lot.
Here’s what we know about on-the-job injuries:
 Up to a third of people who were injured on the job admit that they were
experiencing some level of anger prior to the injury.
 The angrier they were at the time, the more likely they were to be
injured.
 If they were extremely irritated, they were five times more likely to be
injured than if they weren’t irritated at all.
37
Chapter 3: Is Anger Poisoning Your Life?

 If they were extremely angry, they were seven times more likely to be
injured than if they weren’t angry.
 If they were in a rage, they were 12 times more likely to be injured than if
you weren’t in a rage.
 Anger is more likely to lead to injury in men.
 Anger increases the odds of your injuring another employee and inflict-
ing injury on yourself.
 Anger and alcohol use prior to injury are highly linked, and both inde-
pendently increase a person’s odds of being injured on the job.
Road rage
Psychologist Jerry Deffenbacher at Colorado State University has two impor-
tant messages for all of us: Anger is hazardous to driving and if you’re a self-
professed high-anger driver, do yourself a favor and get some help.
The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety estimates — conservatively — that,
between 1990 and 1996, road rage caused 218 traffic fatalities and over 12,000
injuries. Even more alarming is their estimate that this problem is increasing
yearly by somewhere between 5 and 10 percent. Bottom line: You may liter-
ally be putting your life in someone else’s hands every time you get behind
the wheel.
Road rage isn’t about the road (I discuss this more in Chapter 24) — it’s
about rage. According to Dr. Deffenbacher, high-anger drivers have the 
following characteristics:
 They’re highly judgmental of other people’s driving.
 They have contempt for how others drive.
38
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
Are you absent without leave?
I asked a large group of employees about their
anger and about various health issues, includ-
ing one question about absenteeism: In the past
three months, I asked, have you missed work
because of illness?
Interestingly, those who suffered from chronic
anger — one or more episodes of anger every
day — were five-and-a-half times more likely 
to have answered yes to that question than
employees who got angry less often. Similarly,
those who reported intense anger (rage) were
three times more likely to miss work because of
illness than those who were only irritated.
Findings like this lead me to believe that many
employed people go AWOL when they get fed
up with work — and, illness provides them with
a legitimate excuse.

 They have more vengeful thoughts about other drivers.
 They take more risks while driving — speeding, switching lanes, tailgat-
ing, running yellow lights.
 They experience anger on a daily basis (what, in Chapter 2, I call chronic
anger).
 They’re more likely to get in the car already angry.
 They tend to express their anger outwardly — yelling, honking, finger
pointing, tailgating.
 They have less control of their emotions in general.
 They tend to react impulsively when frustrated.
Most of the things in life we call accidents really aren’t accidents. And some
people are really just accidents waiting to happen. Be honest about yourself
about your own road rage — you could not only be saving your life, but also
the lives of everyone else on the road with you.

Part I: The Basics of Anger 
Do you really need a doctor?
Imagine that you’re in a job that you hate, you’re
overdue for a raise, the boss keeps piling more
work on you all the time, your co-workers are
jerks, you can’t remember the last time some-
one told you that you were doing a good job, you
feel absolutely stuck — and you’re pissed about
all of it!
Now, also imagine that it’s 6:45 in the morning
and you just got out of bed and are about to get
ready for work. You didn’t sleep well again last
night, you’re tired, your throat is scratchy, and
your head is beginning to throb.
All of a sudden, a thought pops into your head:
“I can’t go to work today. I’m sick. I’m going to
call the doctor and see if he can find out what’s
causing me to feel so bad. I think I just need
some time to myself to rest and get well.” So,
you call the office to let them know you’re out
sick and aren’t sure when you’ll be back in. You
instantly feel better!
Here’s what I think. I don’t think you’re sick at 
all — certainly not enough to see a doctor.
Instead, I think you’re sick and tired of going to
work. You’re full of anger and resentment and
your body is telling you “I’ve had it. I’ve had
enough. No more. I need a break.”
You need a doctor, all right, just not the kind you
think. Your physician can examine you, run
blood tests, and even do x-rays, but chances
are she won’t find out what’s wrong with you.
She may appease you by saying, “I’m not sure
what’s causing your symptoms — you may just
have a mild case of whatever’s going around.”
She’ll probably tell you to just take aspirin every
couple of hours, get some rest, and maybe stay
home from work for a day or two, and that
should do it. But she’s wrong because “what’s
going around” is your constant state of irritation
while you’re at work eight to ten hours a day.
And aspirin and rest won’t fix that! What you
need is the other kind of doctor — the kind that
specializes in anger management.

 Obsessive-compulsive disorder
 Phobias
 Pruritis (anal itching)
 Psoriasis
 Schizophrenia
 Spastic colitis
 Stroke
 Stuttering or stammering
 Substance abuse
 Teeth grinding 
 Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder
 Ulcers
Sabotaging Your Career
Not only can anger rob you of energy and end up making you sick, it can also
drastically affect your career — and not in the way you want.
I was driving my family home from vacation and found myself listening to a
syndicated talk show that offered career advice. Normally, I’m not interested
in that sort of thing, but it was late, everyone else in the car was asleep, and I
had a hundred miles to go — besides it was the only thing on.
A 35-year-old unemployed man called in telling the host that he needed
advice on how to get a good job. The host asked him about his educational
background — he was a college grad — and inquired about his last job. 
He described what sounded like a pretty good job as a town administrator in
a small community.
“How long did that job last?” the host asked.
“About 18 months and then I quit,” said the fellow.
“Why did you quit?” the host asked.
“They wouldn’t give me the big raise I felt I deserved so I got mad and
resigned,” was the answer.
41
Chapter 3: Is Anger Poisoning Your Life?

“And, what did you do before that?” the host asked.
“Same thing — city administrator for another small community.”
“How long were you at that job?” the host inquired.
“I think about two years, but again they wouldn’t meet all my demands so I
got mad and quit.”
The conversation continued until the caller had described six good jobs
since he graduated from college, all of which he had left in anger.
Finally, the host said, “I get the picture but I think you’re wrong about what
your problem is. Your problem isn’t how to get a good job. You’ve had six.
Your problem is your inability to control your temper whenever your
employer either can’t or won’t give you exactly what you want.”
The man was furious, shouting, “You don’t know what you’re talking about.
I’m not the problem. They are. You’re not giving me any help here.” Then he
hung up. Obviously, what had started out as a highly promising career was
now stalled and heading down the toilet — fast.
In the following sections, I cover some other ways in which anger can sabo-
tage your career.
Getting off track early
In today’s world, more than ever before, if you hope to succeed at work, you
need an education. Without an education, your choices are extremely limited
and you’ll be lucky if you get what amounts to back-breaking, low-paying,
here-today-gone-tomorrow jobs.
What does this have to do with anger? Well, it turns out that men and women
who were ill tempered as children and adolescents drop out of school before
they graduate from high school a lot more often than even-tempered young-
sters. They enter the job market already at a distinct disadvantage and they
never catch up.
Heading in the wrong direction
Most people want to have a better life than their parents and grandparents
had. You want to make more money, have more creature comforts, drive a
bigger car, live in a bigger house, wear more expensive clothes, eat in better
42
Part I: The Basics of Anger 

restaurants, take more elaborate vacations — and those are the incentives
that may spur you to work longer, harder, and smarter year after year.
But not everyone is following that dream. Some people are experiencing just
the opposite — by the time they reach midlife, they’re actually worse off in
terms of job security, job status, and income than their parents. Why? The
answer is anger. It turns out that easily angered people have more jobs over a
lifetime, get fired or quit more often, are forced to take whatever jobs are
available (instead of logically pursuing a career), and have a much more
erratic employment history as compared to those who are slow to anger.
To add insult to injury, many ill-tempered adults seek out jobs that tolerate
their angry outbursts as long as the job gets done. In effect, they’ve found a
niche for their anger. (Unfortunately, most of these jobs are physically dan-
gerous and low paying.)
Asking the wrong question
To paraphrase President John F. Kennedy, “Ask not what your employer can
do for you, but rather what you can do for your employer.” Angry employees
typically are more in tune with their own needs, expectations, needs, wants,
goals, and so on, than those of the company for which they work. If your boss
comes to you late in the day and asks whether you can stay a little longer to
finish up a rush order, you get mad and bark, “Absolutely not! I have plans
already. I’ve done all I’m going to do today” before walking off in a huff. If you
think you’re entitled to a promotion but someone else gets it, you sulk and
proceed to do as little as possible for your employer from that day forward.
You’re always asking the same question over and over: “Why aren’t they
treating me fairly?”
The question you should be asking is: “Why do I get so angry whenever I
don’t get what I want when I want it?” Anger is like a mirror — your own per-
sonal mirror. Look into it and see what comes back at you. Maybe you’re
spoiled or you’re a bit grandiose in what you expect of yourself and others at
work. Maybe they’re not the problem — maybe you are.
Look around at the other people you work with. Are they as angry at work as
you are? If not, and if they’re doing the same work, you should ask yourself
why. Why are you angry and they’re not?
43
Chapter 3: Is Anger Poisoning Your Life?

Engaging in counterproductive 
work behavior
Have you ever engaged in any of the following behaviors while at work lately?
 Come to work late without permission
 Made fun of someone at work
 Found yourself daydreaming rather than doing your job
 Behaved rudely to a client or co-worker
 Refused to assist a colleague at work
 Blamed someone else for a mistake you made
 Tried to look busy while doing nothing
 Taken a longer break than you were entitled to
 Avoided returning a phone call to someone at work
 Intentionally wasted supplies
 Stolen something that belongs to a co-worker
 Hit or pushed someone
 Made an obscene gesture to a co-worker
44
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
Deciding if and when you want to be reemployed
Every once in a while, I run across a piece of
research dealing with anger that really grabs
my attention — like the one by Dr. James
Pennebaker at the University of Texas that
linked emotional confession (see Chapter 9) to
an employee’s likelihood of finding a new job.
The strategy Pennebaker used to assist a small
group of recently laid off workers was amaz-
ingly simple. He had these 25 men spend 30 
minutes a day for a week writing down their
deepest thoughts and feelings about being 
laid off. The main emotion they experienced:
outrage.
Although the men expressed instant relief after
writing each day, the real benefit came from the
fact that they were three to five times more
likely to be reemployed several months later
than a comparable group of employees who
only received the usual types of employer assis-
tance — help in updating their résumés. Dr.
Pennebaker surmised that helping these men
come to terms with the anger they felt over
losing their jobs enabled them to be less defen-
sive and hostile when they were interviewed for
other positions. In effect, they became more
desirable candidates.

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you’ve engaged in what’s
called counterproductive work behavior. Counterproductive work behavior is
any act at work that is clearly intended to hurt the organization you work for
or other employees. And which employees are most likely to engage in such
behavior? The angry ones, of course.
Now, ask yourself this question: If I act this way at work, am I likely to have a
successful career — get a raise, get a promotion, get a pat on the back from
the boss? Probably not.
Counterproductive work behavior is subtle and not always easy to observe.
For that reason alone, it’s likely to persist in an organization. The cost of such
behavior to industry is staggering — approximately $200 billion a year.
Ruining Your Marriage
Angry people are difficult to live with, and anger is powerful enough to kill
any positive feelings that a married couple has for each other. The idea that
“love conquers all” is a myth.
Take Bob, for example, a young man who was married three times before he
reached his 30th birthday. Bob’s explanation was that he simply was unlucky 
in his choice of mates — “I seem to find one bitch after another.” The truth of
the matter, though, was that Bob was a chronic rager, who easily became frus-
trated and violent when he and his wife faced any type of stress or conflict —
problems adhering to a budget, how to discipline the kids, how to satisfy both
sets of parents. This problem was not a new one — Bob’s temper tantrums had
begun when he was a small child and had gradually escalated over the years.
Is Bob unusual? Unfortunately, no. Studies show that the divorce rate for men
and women who were ill tempered as children is twice that of even-tempered
kids. Why divorce? For two reasons:
 Their mates have the good sense to finally put an end to the abusive
anger they suffer in the marriage.
 Anger adversely affects how effectively we do our jobs as spouses and
parents and, thus, reduces the family’s income.
45
Chapter 3: Is Anger Poisoning Your Life?

Affecting the Health of 
Those You Care About
If you’re not all that concerned about the fact that your anger is poisoning
your life, at least be concerned about what it’s doing to those you live with
and love. Living with a habitually angry — sometimes rageful — person is no
different from living with someone who is a heavy smoker. Spouses of heavy
smokers breathe in all that smoke and, as a result, have a 25 percent greater
risk for both heart disease and lung cancer, even though they never smoked
themselves. Well, the same is true of anger — all that anger that you’re spew-
ing out over the years can rob your family of energy, make them ill, and ruin
their careers as well.
46
Part I: The Basics of Anger 
Making the healthy choice
Every day you’re faced with choices. Some of
those choices are simple, like which socks to
wear, whether to have bacon with your eggs,
and whether to drink another cup of coffee.
Other choices are tough choices. Do you let one
of your employees go? Do you confront your
teenager about the drugs you found in his
dresser drawer? Do you hold your temper —
even though you have good reason to lose it?
Obviously, some of your options are healthy;
others are not.
A man was sent to me for court-ordered anger
management after he assaulted his ex-wife. He
wasn’t all that motivated — he honestly felt that
he hadn’t done anything wrong, certainly noth-
ing that should be regarded as a crime. His rea-
soning was: “Basically, I hate conflict. I avoid it
wherever possible, always have. I don’t tell
people — like my ex-wife — when I’m angry,
because I don’t want to hurt their feelings or
make them uncomfortable. So, it builds up. I was
actually trying to avoid a confrontation with 
her — trying to leave rather than argue — but
she stood in the door and blocked my exit. So, 
I pushed her out of the way, and she called the
police.”
I asked him, “If you had to choose between
hurting your ex-wife’s — or your current
fiancée’s — feelings or assaulting one of them
physically, which would you do?”
He tried to avoid the answer, instead saying that
he kept his emotions to himself in order not to
hurt other people’s feelings. I pressed him for an
answer: “I understand that, but I’m asking you
to choose between possibly hurting someone’s
feelings versus hurting her physically.”
Once again, he attempted to avoid the choice.
But after I pressed him a third time, he finally
said, “Well, of course, I guess I’d rather hurt her
feelings.”
“Good,” I replied “ because the last time you
made the unhealthy choice and that’s why
you’re here.”
If you choose to hold in your anger to the point
where you finally explode in rage, the conse-
quences of that rage are the result of the choice
you made. If you want to have fewer negative
consequences, then you’ve got to find how to
make healthier choices. And, that’s what this
book is all about — choosing solutions that
“detoxify” your anger.

Sometimes the repercussions of being the spouse or child of an angry person
are obvious — bruises, broken bones, scars, trips to the emergency room.
Most often, however, they’re more subtle and less visible — but no less dev-
astating or emotionally crippling.
Rhonda’s father was, as she put it, “difficult, always difficult,” which turned
out to mean he was a chronic rager. Growing up, Rhonda and her sister were
used to him yelling, throwing things, and being constantly disgusted by
everything they did. Unlike her sister, who would fight back even as a child,
Rhonda’s way of surviving her father’s angry abuse was to escape by becom-
ing invisible — that is, she found how to behave in ways that escaped notice,
something she still does at age 56. The other legacies of Rhonda’s early 
childhood — common to all victims of angry parenting — included
 Low self-esteem
 A lack of identity
 Suppressed emotions (most especially anger!)
 A feeling of estrangement and discomfort when in the company of
others

Chapter 3: Is Anger Poisoning Your Life?
My father’s choices
Growing up, our family wasn’t poor, but we were
just one step above it. Too many kids, too little
money. My father was at heart a good man,
hardworking, intelligent, and resourceful. But he
had two strikes against him: He was an alco-
holic and he had an awful temper.
My parents always argued about money. My
mother was always on my father’s back to earn
more so that they could keep up with the bills
and do some nice things for us five children
once in a while. My father’s answer most often
was to simply get drunk and then turn violent.
Then one day he got a break. His employer
offered him a white-collar sales job with higher
pay. We were all excited, especially my mother.
But things didn’t go well from the outset. Dad
just wasn’t comfortable wearing a shirt and tie,
working with his head rather than his hands,
and keeping his cool with difficult customers.
His boss eventually took the new position away
from him and demoted him back to his old job in
the warehouse.
And there we were — back to being nearly
poor. My mother was furious with my dad. I
don’t think she ever forgave him for losing that
white-collar job, and I’m sure that had some-
thing to do with their eventual divorce a few
years later.
Strangely enough, though, my father seemed
relieved and happier with himself. He was back
in his element — where he could get angry with
his co-workers whenever he felt like it, stop off
at the tavern on the way home, and end up fight-
ing with his wife all night. I guess you could say
that sabotaging this once-in-a-lifetime opportu-
nity for advancement was a good choice for my
father, but it sure wasn’t for the family. Years
later, my father died angry and broke — just as
he had lived his whole life.

 An insatiable need to please people
 Critical self-judgment
 An inability to experience intimacy in adult relationships
 A defensive orientation toward life (“I’m sorry — it must be my fault!”)
 A lack of assertiveness
 A tendency to underachieve in her choice of occupation
 Frequent bouts of depression
Rhonda did one other thing common to children of angry parents. She mar-
ried a man just like her father, a man she felt subordinate to, a man she was
afraid of, a man who made her want to continue being invisible. So, all the
symptoms and behaviors of her unhappy childhood continued throughout
her adult years. Her father’s anger affected Rhonda on every level — just as
your anger affects those you love on every level.

Managing Your
Anger Today

In this part . . .
I
tell you how emotions, like anger, are supposed to be
transient — they come and go — and why you need to
take immediate, decisive action as soon as you start to
lose your temper in order to prevent anger from taking
hold of your mind and body. In this part, you see why it’s
not always wise to have the last (angry) word and you
find out how to ratchet down the volume of your own
anger.
Anger management is really all about mind over matter.
It’s about giving yourself adequate time to respond to
your feelings, asking the right questions about your anger,
choosing how to respond when you get mad, and deciding
if you’re willing to pay the consequences for outrageous
behavior. Bottom line: Just because you have the right to
be angry doesn’t mean you have to exercise that right!

Taking Immediate Action
In This Chapter
 Creating emotional distance
 Striking while the iron is still warm
 Transporting yourself out of anger
 Correcting old habits
T
he first thing you should do when you feel anger coming on is to take
immediate action. As the saying goes, “He who hesitates is lost” — lost 
as in losing your temper. Sometimes it’s as easy as counting to ten, some-
times not.
Ninety percent of people, unfortunately, don’t act as soon as they start feel-
ing angry — and, all too often, they quickly progress from a petty-annoyance
stage to full-blown rage. This chapter shows you how to keep that from hap-
pening. The idea that emotions need to just run their course is a myth — and
a dangerous one at that. The sooner you take control of your anger, the
better off you are (and that goes doubly for those around you who may end
up on the receiving end of your wrath).
Drawing the Line — the 
Sooner the Better
Anger, by its very nature, is meant to be short lived. It comes and it goes like
a wave hitting the beach. For most people, anger is over within five to ten
minutes. But for some people, it lingers and grows in intensity, accelerating
under its own steam.

To understand this process a bit better, consider a conversation I had
recently with an angry client:
Gentry: You mentioned an incident you had with your girlfriend this past
weekend. Tell me about it.
Client: It was nothing really. We had made some plans for the weekend
and all of a sudden she changed them without letting me know. So, I got
annoyed.
Gentry: On a scale of 1 to 10, how annoyed were you when you first
heard that she had changed the plan?
Client: A 4, I guess.
Gentry: Okay. Actually, a 4 indicates that you weren’t annoyed — you
were angry or mad. What I call mad is between 4 and 6. A rating of 1
through 3 would signify annoyance. Did you tell your girlfriend that you
were mad?
Client: No. I just kept it to myself, like always.
Gentry: Then what happened?
Client: We went out to eat, but we had to wait a long time for the food to
come. And I kept getting madder.
Gentry: What number was your anger then?
Client: It was up to about a 6 or 7, I guess.
Gentry: Well, there’s a difference. A rating of 6 means you were really
mad — a score of 7 would suggest you were in a state of mild rage, but
rage nevertheless.
Client: I guess it was a 6.
Gentry: So, at that point, you were just a tick away from rage. Did you do
anything about your anger at that point?
Client: Not really — just got quiet and headed off to a ballgame with my
girlfriend. And that’s when we got into this big fight in the car. I’m not
sure what set me off, but I got so angry I punched the vent in my car and
damaged it.
Gentry: And how angry were you at that point?
Client: Oh, I was definitely a 9 or 10!
Had my client asserted himself when he first became upset — telling his girl-
friend how unfair he thought it was for her to frequently alter their plans
without consulting him — I seriously doubt the incident in question would
have occurred. But he didn’t and it did!

Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

Settling for Just Being Annoyed
Annoyance is the mildest form of anger. It lies at the opposite end of the 
spectrum from rage. Typically, you don’t have to worry about managing
annoyance.
Annoyance is more commonplace than anger. Roughly half of the people I
surveyed told me that, at best, they got annoyed during the course of a week.
Because annoyance is less intense than anger, people get over being annoyed
quicker than they do being angry. Also, annoyance is more likely to go away
on its own.
In short, being annoyed is usually not a problem — if that’s where it ends.
How do you settle for just being annoyed? The next time someone pushes
your buttons, try the following:
 Don’t think of the incident or situation as more serious than it is. Keep
things in perspective. If someone cuts you off in traffic, that’s annoying,
but it’s not the end of the world.
 Don’t take it personally. That same guy who cut you off doesn’t know
you — he’s probably oblivious to you, and even if he’s acting out his
own little road-rage drama, it’s not about you in particular.
 Don’t blame the other person. When you start blaming someone else,
it’s easy to let your annoyance escalate. Just let it go.
 Don’t think about revenge. Revenge is often the next step after you
start assigning blame. Spend your energy on more useful things than
revenge.
 Keep striving for a non-angry way of coping with the situation. So
you’re annoyed at that other driver. How can you deal with the situation
without getting angry? Maybe you turn on your favorite music or turn
the radio dial to NPR (it’s pretty hard to be angry when you’re listening
to Bob Edwards or Terry Gross).
 Refuse to see yourself as a helpless victim. Take some type of action to
adjust to or correct the annoying situation. It really doesn’t matter what
you do as long as you do something — other than just be angry.
 Don’t let a negative mood — like depression — magnify your emotion.
Anger only intensifies depression. Tell yourself: I’m not going to let this
annoying situation add to what is already a down mood. Ask yourself:
What would I do if I weren’t depressed? And then do that.
53
Chapter 4: Taking Immediate Action

Understanding Why Your 
Fuse Is So Short
Some people have a short fuse, meaning that their anger accelerates so
quickly that they don’t have much of an opportunity to take control of it
before it gets out of hand. The length of your fuse is determined by a number
of factors, such as:
 Your temperament: You came into the world wired differently from your
siblings or your parents or your best friend. And they came into the
world wired differently from you. Some people are impulsive (acting
quickly and without much thought), while others are more deliberate
(taking their time to think things through). You may be more excitable or
reactive, which means that you’ll be physically aroused more than some-
one who is easygoing or laid back. These differences are evident even
before birth and continue from cradle to grave. Impulsive and excitable
people have much shorter fuses than their laid-back counterparts.
 Your role models: Often, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. In other
words, you pick up how to react to stress during childhood — from your
parents and others who raised you. If they’re quick tempered, most
likely you will be, too.
 Your personality: Do you have a combative personality? Are you impa-
tient, impulsive, confrontational, demanding, and domineering in the
way you deal with life? If the answer is yes, you’re apt to have a short
fuse — because you’re always poised to move against the world at a
moment’s notice. (See Chapter 20 for more about how this plays itself
out in the workplace.)
54
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 
Way beyond annoyed
A client of mine and I were reviewing an inci-
dent where he lost his temper. As soon as I
started to ask questions about what actually
provoked his anger, he literally sprang up from
the couch, his face taking on a menacing look.
He looked like a panther ready to strike. I asked
him how he was feeling and he said, “I’m
annoyed just talking about it.” I asked him to
rate the intensity of his emotion on a 10-point
scale and he said he was at a 51⁄2 or 6.
“Well, I have news for you,” I said. “You’re way
beyond being annoyed. A rating of 5 or 6 means
you’re very angry, bordering on rage.” Then I
knew why he had been referred to anger man-
agement. What he labeled as annoyed, most
people call anger. And, what he called anger,
they call rage. This man never just got annoyed.

 Your use of chemicals such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol:
Chemicals that affect your brain affect your emotions. That includes
drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, and tranquilizers, to
name but a few. If you regularly use any of these substances, you’re
more likely to have a shorter fuse.
 Your mood: There’s no question about it: If you suffer from certain types
of mood disorders (such as agitated depression or bipolar disorder), it
won’t take much to make you angry. I’m not sure what percentage of my
anger-management clients suffer from an undiagnosed, untreated mood
disorder, but I know it’s pretty high.
 Your stress level: There’s normal stress and then there’s abnormal,
excessive, over-the-top stress. The farther away from normal stress you
get, the shorter your fuse. Abrupt outbursts of anger are often your ner-
vous system’s way of saying, “Stop! I can’t take any more stress. It’s
killing me! Back off.”
 How much sleep you’re getting: Without adequate sleep (seven to nine
hours per night), life becomes a real strain. Everything seems to take
more effort. Your nerves are frayed. You’re less effective at everything
you do. And, it doesn’t take much to set off your temper. (See Chapter 17
for more on sleep and anger.)
 Whether you have a defensive outlook: If you have a cynical, hostile
view of the world — expecting things not to go your way and thinking of
everyone around you as potential enemies — you’re always on the verge
of lashing out in anger. Any little spark can (and will) set you off.
Lengthening Your Fuse
So how can you lengthen your fuse? Well, you can’t easily change your tem-
perament and you certainly can’t undo your childhood, but you can cut back
on caffeine, drink alcohol only in moderation, get more sleep, get counseling
for depression, employ some stress-management techniques (Chapter 14
shows you how to be a hardy personality), try to have a more optimistic 
55
Chapter 4: Taking Immediate Action
Why not tranquilizers?
Ironically, the drugs that physicians prescribe
to calm you down may, inadvertently, make it
easier for you to lose your temper. For example,
the use of diazepam (Valium) tends to allay anx-
iety, but at the same time can cause people to
lose control and act out aggressively. This begs
the question: Should tranquilizers be used 
in anger management? I would argue not.
Antidepressant drugs, on the other hand,
appear to be both safe and effective in toning
down a person’s potential for anger. (You can
find more on this in Chapter 19.)

outlook, and ask for things instead of being demanding. Those things you 
can do. You can also try some other techniques, ones I cover in the following
sections.
Walking away — but coming back
You have a built-in fight-or-flight mechanism that guides and directs your
behavior whenever you’re faced with some type of threat — regardless of
whether the threat is a physical one or a threat to your self-esteem. This
explains why you probably respond to provocation either with some type of
angry reaction (fight) or simply run the other way and try to avoid the prob-
lem altogether (flight).
The problem is that neither of these extreme options helps you manage
anger. If you decide to stand and fight, you need to remain angry long enough
to overcome the threat — and the intensity of your anger may become accel-
erated in the process. On the other hand, if you retreat from the threat, you
end up taking your angry feelings with you. You can outrun the threat, but
not your own emotions.
The good news? There is a third, viable option — another way to take imme-
diate action. You can disengage (walk away) initially, but return later, after
you’ve calmed down sufficiently to discuss how to resolve the conflict. This
is the most mature way to handle anger-provoking problems, but also the one
most people are least likely to choose.
The choice of how you respond to provocation in large part depends on how
angry you get initially. Table 4-1 shows how a group of ninth-grade high-school
students responded when asked the question: What would you do if another
student got angry with you for no apparent reason? As students got angrier,
the chances that they would walk away and later return to discuss their anger
decreased dramatically. Yet another good reason to settle for just being
annoyed (mildly angry) when things don’t go your way.

Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

Highly aggressive, combative personalities are poised to move against what-
ever is provoking them instead of disengaging and walking away, even if it
means calming down. It just goes against their instinctive nature!
Letting the other person have the last word
People get irritated with things — a leaky faucet, a car that won’t start — but
they get angry with people. So most anger occurs within the context of a social
exchange. Somebody always has the first word — that’s the provocation, the
thing that gets the ball rolling. The question is: Who stops the ball? Who has
the last word?
After you realize that you’re angry, you can decide to let the person who had
the first word also have the last. And the sooner the better — unless you’re
willing to risk things getting out of hand.
Consider the following two conversations between a parent and a teenager
and see which one you think is best. Here’s the first conversation:
Parent: I want you to clean up your room before dinner.
Adolescent: I’m doing something now.
Parent: (irritated) I said I want this room cleaned up.
Adolescent: (angry) Leave me alone.
Parent: (angry) Don’t talk to me that way. Start cleaning up your room —
now!
Adolescent: (throwing book across the room in a rage) I told you to get
out of my room!
Parent: (very angry) Don’t you dare throw that at me. Start cleaning this
room right now and I mean it.
And here’s the second conversation:
Parent: I want you to clean your room before dinner.
Adolescent: (irritated) I’m doing something now.
Parent: (irritated) Yes, I can see that, but I want you to clean your room.
Adolescent: (angry) Leave me alone.
Parent: (irritated but not yet angry) Okay. That’ll give you a chance to get
started on your room.
Adolescent: (angry) I’ll do it when I feel like it.
57
Chapter 4: Taking Immediate Action

Often, people are so eager to have the last word in disagreements with other
people that they totally lose sight of how out of hand things are getting.
Anger management is more about process than it is about outcome. If you
can improve the process by letting the other person have the last word, by
all means do so.
If you insist on having the last word — you just can’t help yourself — then by
all means make it a nondefensive one. My personal favorite is, “Whatever.” If
someone gets mad at me and wants to launch into a tirade about what a jerk I
am, I don’t argue with him (like I used to). I just say, “Whatever” — whatever
you say, whatever you think — and walk away. That way, I don’t have to play
his angry game.
Sometimes It Pays to Feel Guilty
Guilt isn’t necessarily good or bad. It depends on whether you feel guilty
before you act out your anger or after you act out your anger. If guilt keeps
you from harming another person with your anger — verbally or physically —
that’s a good thing. If you wait to feel guilty until after you’ve satisfied your
thirst for revenge, that’s bad.
John gets angry with his wife whenever she hollers, “Look out!” when he’s dri-
ving the car. A couple of times, her nervousness has almost caused him to have
an accident. He feels like yelling at her, “Dammit, don’t do that! You’re going to
get us killed.” But, he doesn’t. He loves his wife — a partner for over 40 years —
and he knows that yelling at her will only hurt her feelings. So, he lets it pass.
John’s brother doesn’t let anything pass. If he gets angry with his wife, she
hears about it immediately and in the harshest terms. Sometimes, he just
hollers; other times, he expresses his anger physically.
The next time you find yourself irritated (or just plain mad), before you act,
consider the consequences of what’s in your mind. If you know for sure it’s
something you’re going to want to apologize for later, don’t do it. Think of a
nonhurtful way of expressing your feelings. In this kind of situation, an ounce
of prevention really is worth a pound of cure!
Distraction Works
You experience whatever captures your brain’s attention. If you get aroused
with anger, your brain turns its attention to that and away from other things.
That’s why anger can be such a disruptive emotion. The stronger the emotion,
the more captivated your brain becomes. You can be irritated and continue to
at least partially attend to other things — but rage, now, that’s a different story.
58
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

Intense emotional experiences — positive or negative — override your
senses. That’s how people end up “blinded” by love or in a state of “blind
rage.” Blind, in this context, simply means your brain is not paying attention
to anything outside of your own emotion.
The good news, however, is that the brain can be distracted — meaning it
can turn its attention elsewhere at any point in time. So, the trick in anger
management is to give your brain something else to attend to besides anger.
Changing your situation
In most people, emotions are situational. Something in the here and now irri-
tates you or makes you mad. The emotion itself is tied to the situation in
which it originates. As long as you remain in that provocative situation,
you’re likely to stay angry. If you leave the situation, the opposite is true —
the emotion begins to fade as soon as you move away from the situation.
Moving away from the situation prevents it from getting a grip on you.
Psychologists often advise clients to get some emotional distance from what-
ever is bothering them. One easy way to do that is to geographically separate
yourself from the source of your anger.
Andy employed this principle in dealing with his irritating boss. Andy had
been referred for anger management after angrily confronting his boss on two
different occasions. The fact that he had good reason for doing so didn’t
matter. He was simply told that the next time he lost it, he would be fired —
immediately. With just a few years left before retirement, Andy was not eager
for that to happen. Besides, his recurrent anger had also affected his blood
pressure and his doctor had warned him of the possibility of some type of
coronary event (like a heart attack).

Chapter 4: Taking Immediate Action
Morality and religion
I’ve been in and around religion most of my life.
By birthright, I’m a Protestant and at one time or
another I’ve been an Episcopalian, Baptist,
Methodist, and Presbyterian. Despite that, I
attended a Catholic school for the first nine
years and, like all other students, was immersed
in catechism. I also have several good friends
who are Jewish.
What I’ve discovered from all this exposure to
different religions is that guilt is an inherent
component of all religions — because religion
and morality go hand in hand. Morality shows
people right from wrong, what constitutes civil
behavior, and where societal boundaries are.
Guilt is what we’re taught to feel when we cross
those boundaries. Some of those boundaries
have to do with anger and violence (for exam-
ple, “Thou shalt not kill”), and these boundaries
are no less important today than they were
thousands of years ago.

Andy and I talked about some practical ways to for him to keep his cool even
in difficult situations — which, unfortunately, occurred on a daily basis on his
job. I asked him to pay more attention to his emotions and, as soon as he felt
himself begin to get tense in an exchange with his boss, make a quick exit and
calm down. Guess what? It worked! Whenever Andy’s boss began to confront
him, and whenever Andy began to feel his blood start to boil, he would
politely say, “Excuse me. Give me a minute. I’ll be right back,” and then step
away. Andy then used some of the techniques I talk about in Chapter 6 to
defuse his emotion, returned to his boss (now more in control of his emo-
tions), and said, “Okay, what was it you wanted to say?” That was several
years ago and he’s still employed.
Stopping the rumination
What is rumination and what does it have to do with anger? Good question.
Rumination is the human equivalent of a cow chewing on the cud — chewing
food already swallowed and then regurgitated. (Gross, I know.) When you
continue to rethink, reconsider, relive, and rehash some incident that pro-
voked your anger well beyond the point where it happened, you’re ruminat-
ing. And rumination invariably intensifies the emotion. At first you may just
be irritated, but the more you think and talk about it, the madder you
become. You can’t let go of the thoughts, so you can’t let go of the feelings —
you’re stuck!
So, how do you get unstuck? Try using the thought-stopping technique. When
you become aware that you’re entering into the realm of repetitive angry
thinking, say aloud to yourself, “Stop!” and shift your attention to something
else. Repeat the word as many times as necessary until you have let go of
what’s irritating you. If you use the technique quickly, before you get too far
down that road of chewing too much on your anger, letting go isn’t difficult.
All you’re trying to do here, really, is interrupt that pattern of unproductive
thinking that can only make a bad situation worse.

Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 
Why employees need breaks
A lot of companies have tightened up on allowing
their employees to take work breaks. Apparently,
every time you leave your workstation, they feel
like they’re losing money. For the most part, I
believe this is a mistake. Employees need work
breaks, if for no other reason than to engage in
some much-needed anger management. That’s
why so many folks take smoke breaks and coffee
breaks — these are legitimate, time-honored
ways of removing themselves from the stress
(and irritation) that surrounds them at work. The
fewer the breaks, the hotter the temperature in
the office!

If the thought-stopping technique doesn’t work, try ruminating about some-
thing other than your anger. You can engage in some positive rumination —
otherwise known as daydreaming. Two of my current favorites are walking
down a long beach on a cloudless day and sitting in a cozy mountain cabin
reading a good book while it snows outside. When I was younger — and more
aggressive — I used to like to ruminate about making jump shots from 50 feet
and hitting nothing but net. Whatever works for you!
Using imagery to transcend anger
There are many parallels between anger management and pain management —
the other area to which I’ve devoted most of my professional life. Anger and
pain can both be intense, chronic experiences — and you can easily find your-
self ruminating about both (see the preceding section for more on rumination).
So, what I found out from one of my pain clients has relevance here. Phillip
was a man in his 50s who owned and operated an orchard. He enjoyed his life
and found real meaning in everything he did — that is, until he was a victim
in a car accident, which left him in intractable back and leg pain. Phillip
needed to continue doing a lot of physical work in his orchard, but that
tended to exacerbate his pain as the day went on. He needed a tool to help
him alleviate the pain when it became intolerable so that he could get back to
work. The tool we chose was imagery.
Phillip found how to relax and imagine his favorite thing — sitting by a pond
fishing, all by himself. It was his version of heaven on earth. At whatever
points in the workday, when his pain got to be too much, he would announce
aloud to his wife and employees, “I’m going fishing!” They all knew what that
meant. Then he would go to the back of the barn, sit down on the ground,
close his eyes, and “go fishing” — in other words, imagine himself fishing.
Phillip was good at imagery, so it was the next best thing to actually being
there. After about ten minutes of this, his pain had lessened to a point where
he could once again bear it. He would open his eyes, stand up, and announce
to everyone, “I’m back. Let’s get to work.” Simple, but effective.
You can do the same thing with anger. Here’s how:
1. Find a quiet setting.
You can’t engage in imagery if you’re distracted. Find a quiet place
where you can be alone for at least ten minutes. If you’re at work, that
could be your office — if you close the door and put a DO NOT DISTURB
sign on your door. Or you can take your break and find sanctuary else-
where — an outside bench, sitting in your car in the parking lot, or, as
one of my more creative clients, did — sitting in a stall in the bathroom.
61
Chapter 4: Taking Immediate Action

2. Rate your preimagery level of anger.
Rate how angry you are at this minute on a scale from 1 (mildly 
irritated) to 10 (extreme rage).
3. Close your eyes.
Imagery is about visualizing. If you’re going to create internal images to
use as an antidote to anger, you first have to stop visualizing what’s in
front of you in the external environment. Closing your eyes is the first
step in letting go — and you may find this difficult. It’s all about trusting
yourself and the world around you.
If you aren’t comfortable closing your eyes in the quiet place you’ve
found, chances are you don’t feel safe there. Try finding someplace else.
4. Release your hold on reality.
Letting go of the real world so that you can enter into the world of
imagery takes more than simply closing your eyes. It also requires a
receptive attitude. You have to grant yourself permission to loosen your
grip on both the circumstances that provoked your anger and the emo-
tion itself. This is no different than loosening your grip on the steering
wheel in order to avoid road rage (see Chapter 24).
5. Imagine something positive.
This is the fun part! You’re free here to conjure up any positive image
you want. What’s your favorite vacation spot, where you’re your most
relaxed, carefree self? A lot of people say the beach or the mountains.
But it could be sitting on the deck in your own backyard. The only
requirement is that it be someplace where you’re never angry.
6. Be specific in your imagination.
This has to do with the who, what, and where of the situation you chose.
Are you alone or with someone else? Where are you and what are you
doing? Lying in a hammock? Sitting on a dock fishing? Working in your
herb garden? Imagine what you’re wearing. Can you see the colors of
your clothes? What kind of day is it — cloudy, windy, warm, rainy, sunny?
The more detailed you are about the image, the more into it you are.
7. Stay with the image for at least five minutes.
This exercise is just for use in derailing anger that may otherwise get out
of hand. It’s not something that you need to do for a long period of time.
You’ll be surprised at how refreshing five minutes of positive imagery
can be and how easy it is to release anger in that short interval.
8. Evaluate your postimagery anger level.
While you’re still relaxed and have your eyes closed, rate your anger on
a 10-point intensity scale again. Is there a difference now? If so, you’ve
obviously succeeded in your attempt to transcend anger for the
62
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

moment. If there’s no change or you actually find yourself more angry
than you were earlier, the exercise didn’t work. Maybe you just need a
few more minutes of positive imagery. Or maybe you’ll find the strategies
offered in other chapters more helpful. Don’t be discouraged, however —
no one solution works for everybody.
9. Linger in the moment.
If the exercise did what you wanted it to, why not linger a bit and enjoy
the change in your mind and body — the lack of tension, the inner
peace. Don’t be in too big a hurry to get back to reality!
10. Open your eyes and move on with your day.
As soon as you open your eyes, you’ll realize that the world didn’t go
anywhere — you did. You took a short, refreshing trip to some imaginary,
anger-free place that you call your own — and, in the process, you left
behind the circumstances that provoked your anger in the first place.
You can use this imagery technique in two other ways:
 Instead of imagining yourself in another positive situation, imagine
yourself in the same situation that caused your anger, but without any
feelings of anger.
 Imagine yourself in the same (or different) situation, but feeling a neg-
ative emotion other than anger (for example, sadness). Emotions com-
pete with one another. Feeling angry and sad at the same time is difficult
(if not impossible). In fact, that’s why many people get angry in the first
place — it’s their way of not feeling sad. For example, imagine feeling
sad (rather than angry) about the fact that the person who was just
yelling at you doesn’t appreciate what a wonderful person you are and
how helpful you can be.

Chapter 4: Taking Immediate Action
How some men handle grief
On more than one occasion, I’ve worked with
men — intelligent, successful men — who
become extremely angry after the death of one
of their children. Almost without exception,
these men resist any effort on my part to tap into
feelings of grief. (Who wouldn’t be sad after
losing a child?) The more I probe, the more
defensive and angry they get. The look on their
faces tells me, “Believe me, you don’t want to
go there!” Translated, this means “I don’t want
to go there!”
One man actually threatened me by saying, “I’m
warning you: If you ask me one more time how
I feel about losing my son, I’m going to hit you. I
mean it.” Some of these men become angry
alcoholics. Some focus their anger on their
spouses and end up divorced. Some alienate
themselves from their other children (and thus
compound their loss). Some take it out at work
and end up unemployed. All in an effort not to
feel sad.

The Life Savers technique
A simple, inexpensive, handy way to take immediate action when you find
yourself getting angry is to suck on a Life Savers — or some other type of
hard candy — until it’s all gone. It only takes five minutes (I’ve timed it!), 
but it short-circuits the natural progression of anger.
So why does it work?
 This technique takes advantage of the link between the sucking reflex
and achieving a state of calm that is evident in all newborn infants.
Any mother knows that giving an infant something to suck on alleviates
the baby’s distress. That’s why pacifiers are so popular — and difficult
for some children to give up as they get older.
 The technique involves the ingestion of something sweet — sugar —
and sweet sensations are associated at the level of the brain with plea-
sure, which is the antithesis of anger. The Life Savers literally sweetens
your disposition!
 It buys you enough time to formulate a response to your initial anger
instead of just reacting to it (see Chapter 6). An angry reaction is imme-
diate, impulsive, thoughtless, predictable, and typically leads to conse-
quences that are later regretted. An angry response, on the other hand,
is more deliberate, engages the mind, takes advantage of past experi-
ence, is not always predictable (what works in one situation may not
work in another), and more often has positive consequences (see
Chapter 11 for pointers on how to use anger constructively).
 Patiently sucking on a Life Savers runs counter to the combative, Type
A behavioral tendencies that characterize many people. Sucking is a
passive response, not an aggressive one. And anger is essential only if
you’re moving against the world after you’re provoked.
 By putting something in your mouth to suck on, you can’t immediately
verbalize your anger in ways that escalate the conflict between you
and others or cause you regret later on. Telling someone “I’m sorry”
after you’ve assaulted her with your angry words and tone of voice is
useless and ineffective — it doesn’t help you and it certainly doesn’t
help the other person.
Don’t bite the Life Savers. It defeats the purpose of the exercise by shorten-
ing the length of time before you act on your anger and, more important, by
indulging your aggressive personality. (Aggressive personalities seem to want
to constantly “bite” life rather than savor it.)

In This Chapter
 Avoiding the temptation to vent
 Finding the right language
 Toning it down
 Keeping your finger on the pulse — literally
 Staying focused
W
hen it comes to emotion, communication is absolutely the key. It’s not
only what you say when you lose your temper; it’s also how you say it.
Take Lisa for example. Lisa is a newly married 26-year-old, who finds herself
constantly raging at her husband, Joe. In some situations, Lisa has even phys-
ically assaulted Joe. There’s no question that Lisa is frustrated by a number
of things about her husband — Joe’s friends spend all their time at their
house, he doesn’t help with even the simplest of household chores, he
spends what little money he makes on drugs, and more. When Lisa tries to
talk to Joe about all this, he either ignores her or puts her off by saying,
“Okay, I’ll get to it later.” Obviously, that’s not the response Lisa is looking for.
When she first entered my anger management program, Lisa expressed her
anger toward her husband with expletives like, “You @#$%head!” instead of
articulating the reasons she was upset. But that’s all changed now. She’s
found how to express her anger in noninflammatory language (for example, “I
find that I’m a lot less angry when you’re considerate and help me out.”),
while at the same time turning down the volume — from rage to just plain
mad. Most important, she’s discovered how to talk rather than hit, which
gives her marriage a chance to succeed.
This chapter is all about finding how to effectively communicate anger and
how effectively communicating anger, in turn, benefits your health. What you
discover in this chapter can save you from a broken heart (literally).

Forget Venting
Have you ever called a friend and said, “I just have to vent”? Venting is airing
out stored-up emotion — that’s the best-case scenario. At worst, it’s like the
dictionary definition of venting, that says it’s an “the discharging of volcanic
products.” And, believe me, rage is one of those volcanic products.
But doesn’t it help to release all that pent-up lava and soot and ash? Is vent-
ing a good thing? Well, I’m here to tell you that, contrary to what most people
think, venting anger doesn’t work. Venting doesn’t provide the emotional relief
you expect, nor does it resolve the real-life problems that trigger your anger
in the first place. What is does do, unfortunately, is just the opposite: It makes
angry people angrier, and aggressive people more aggressive.
Screaming at someone that he’s a “@#$%head!” communicates nothing but
raw anger. It doesn’t tell the person why you’re angry. On the other hand, if
you tell him he’s acting inconsiderately, then he may be forced to examine his
own behavior and see what needs correcting. If you use your anger construc-
tively (see Chapter 11), it can be like holding up a mirror in which the other
person sees a reflection of himself — his behavior — and it’s often a reflec-
tion that’s unbecoming, if not downright ugly. Many of the people you’re
angry at would rather you vent and call them derogatory names than articu-
late your anger, forcing them to take a closer look at themselves. In effect, by
venting, you may be doing the people you’re upset with a big favor — but not
the kind that lasts!
Thirty years ago, Dr. Arthur Bohart at California State University conducted a
series of experiments to determine the effectiveness of catharsis (the psychi-
atric term for venting) in reducing anger. In one of those studies, he had three
groups of distressed subjects do one of three things:
 Sit quietly in a room thinking about their feelings.
 Discharge their angry feelings into a tape recorder.
 Spend 20 minutes talking with a counselor about how they felt.
Dr. Bohart concluded that counseling was the most effective way of reducing
anger because it involved both the sharing and understanding of one’s emo-
tions. He also concluded that being silent (not speaking out) reduced anger
more quickly than venting — simply getting things off your chest and into a
tape recorder.
Bottom line: If you’re feeling chronically angry, your best bet is to talk to a
counselor about your emotions so you can get to the bottom of them and
figure out how to move on. But if you’re experiencing an isolated episode of
anger, you’re better off thinking about them quietly than you are venting to a
friend.

Expressing Your Anger Effectively
If you want to express anger effectively, you would be wise to follow the
advice of psychologist George Bach, a pioneer in the field of anger manage-
ment, who suggested that constructive anger must have what he called infor-
mational impact and not just be an exercise in hostility. You need to use your
anger to educate, inform, and share that part of yourself that is hurt, sad,
frustrated, insecure, and feels attacked with the person who tapped into
these feelings. That’s the message that needs to get out — anger is simply the
vehicle. Following are some strategies that you can use instead of venting.
Talking versus hitting
If you can’t articulate your anger (clearly express how you’re feeling through
language), you’re destined to act it out through some form of physical aggres-
sion. When a guy smashes his fist into a wall or, worse yet, into the face of
another person, what exactly does that communicate other than the obvious
fact that he’s mad as hell? How does that punching benefit him? It doesn’t.
Does that punch improve his relationship with the person he hits? Nope. Is
67
Chapter 5: Speaking Out in Anger
What was Freud thinking anyway?
The noted psychiatrist, Sigmund Freud, believed
in a “hydraulic” model of human emotion. As he
saw it, emotions — including anger — are a
natural byproduct of everyday life, but they tend
to build up over time just like steam does in a
teakettle (or lava does in a volcano). As emo-
tions build up, they create bodily tension that
eventually seeks it own discharge. Freud
thought that people remained healthy as long as
they could freely and openly express their feel-
ings. If you couldn’t express emotion in some
acceptable, adaptive way as you experienced
it, then your health would be adversely affected
by the mounting tension within your body.
Freud’s term for helping clients discharge their
residual anger was catharsis, which actually
means a dramatic freeing up of deep-seated
anger from the past — what I refer to in this
book as yesterday’s anger.
Basically, I think Freud was right — it’s just that
most people (including lots of anger-manage-
ment specialists!) misunderstood his concept of
catharsis — which was intended to be a thera-
pist-guided, structured reexperiencing of anger
that was at the core of our personality — and
instead saw it as something akin to plain old
venting. They’re not the same thing! As far as
I’m aware, Freud never had his patients pound
mattresses with a tennis racket, beat on inflated
lifelike dolls, rip up telephone books, scream to
their hearts’ content, or engage in mortal
combat with bataca bats — all forms of con-
ventional anger-management therapy.

the angry person calm after he’s hauled off and slugged someone (or hit a
wall)? Absolutely not. Expressing anger through physical violence has no
upside — zip, zero, zilch.
So then is it better to yell and scream out your anger than hit something or
someone? If that’s the only choice you give yourself at the time, yes. But then
again, verbal violence really doesn’t get you anywhere either. No one feels
better after she’s given someone a good tongue-lashing, no matter what she
says. And the person on the receiving end of all that yelling and screaming
certainly isn’t a happy camper either.
So, what’s left? Talking — using the gift of language to express your emotions
(in this case, anger) in a constructive way.
Eddie is just finding how to talk about his anger. Ever since he was a child,
he’s always kept a tight lid on his anger — withdrawing into himself as soon
as he starts to get irritated, until he can’t hold in all that anger anymore, and
then, predictably, he erupts with volcanic rage. Just recently that rage caused
Eddie to physically assault his wife, which has understandably left her
shaken and put the future of their marriage in serious doubt. The following
conversation illustrates why Eddie needs anger management:
Gentry: You said there was an incident this past week where you lost
your temper. Tell me about it.
Eddie: Yeah, I got irritated with my wife right before we left the house to
go visit some friends. And when we got to our friends’ house, I ended up
being an ass to everyone the whole time we were there.
Gentry: What did you do between the time you left home and the time
you arrived at your friends’ house?
Eddie: Nothing. I didn’t say anything to my wife. She tried to get me to
talk, but I wouldn’t. She finally gave up, and we were both silent until we
got there.
Gentry: How far a drive is it to your friends’ house?
Eddie: Over an hour.
Gentry: You drove for over an hour without saying a word to your wife?
Eddie: Right.
Gentry: What were you doing instead?
Eddie: I was thinking about how angry I was and all kinds of crazy stuff
about my wife.
Gentry: And did that make you more angry, or less so?
68
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

Eddie: Oh, it definitely made me angrier. By the time we got to their house,
I was really upset — tense and ready to explode. I never did relax the
whole time we were there and I know it ruined the evening for all of us.
Gentry: What do you imagine would have happened if you had talked to
your wife about how you felt during that hour-long drive?
Eddie: It probably would have helped, but I don’t know how to do that —
I don’t know what to say. So, I just stay quiet and it builds and builds. I’ve
always been like that, and I don’t know why.
The next time you get so angry you feel like hitting something (or someone),
follow these steps:
1. Come up with a label to identify the intensity of your anger.
For example, are you annoyed, irritated, mad, irate, or in a rage? Start by
saying, “I feel. . . .” Don’t say, “I think. . . .” What you’re going for here is
your feeling, not your thoughts about how obnoxious the other 
person was.
2. Identify the thing that triggered your anger.
For example, “Every time I come home, his friends are here. We never
have any time to ourselves.” Continue your conversation by saying, “I
feel _______ [insert the word you came up with in Step 1] because. . . .”
3. Ask yourself what it would take to help you return to a non-angry
state.
For example, “I would appreciate it if he would ask his friends to leave
when I get home from work so we can have some one-on-one time.”
When you’re able to go through these three steps inside your head, see if you
can actually have that conversation with the person you’re angry with.
Writing versus speaking
A very nice woman — I’ll call her Jane — came to my office complaining of
feeling emotionally “burned out.” She dreaded getting up in the morning, was
unusually tired, found herself crying for no apparent reason on more than
one occasion, and felt like there was “a big fist in my chest” all the time. She
had decided she was depressed and wanted to know what she could do to
feel better.
After talking to her more, I found out that Jane was caught up in a very
unhappy situation: She had spent most of her energies over the past several
years ministering to one of her grown sons, who suffered from drug addiction,
69
Chapter 5: Speaking Out in Anger

which continued despite all of Jane’s well-intentioned efforts. Because she’d
been so tied up in her son’s problems, she had long since quit devoting any
time to her own needs or wants — she wanted to travel, meet some new
people, do things with her husband. She had, in effect, sacrificed her life for
that of her son.
“Your problem is not depression,” I told her “Your problem is that you have a
ton of anger stuck inside you — anger at the way your life has turned out,
anger at your son for not getting well, and most of all anger at yourself for
being so stupid to let things get this bad. That’s why you feel like you have a
fist in your chest — you’re wanting to hit something, but you can’t.” She
agreed, adding that she had never been able to talk to anyone about how she
felt and instead simply “contained” her feelings behind a façade of niceness.
“Okay,” I said, “let’s start by having you write down your feelings about your
son’s drug problem and everything else that’s not going right in your life.” I
gave her 20 minutes to “write from the heart, not the head” and later came
back and asked her to read what she wrote — just to herself, not aloud —
and circle the emotional terms (for example, angry, disappointed, upset). We
discussed those words that she circled and then I asked her to throw the
sheet of paper into the trash.
Two things were immediately apparent: It was easy for her to write a lot in a
short time because the feelings were just beneath the surface, and she
tended to circle issues more than feelings. That’s how disconnected she was
to the emotional side of her personality.
“This is good,” I concluded “Now go home and do this exercise for 20 
minutes every day until you come back. That’s how we’re going to treat 
your depression.”
Turn to Chapter 9 for a detailed, step-by-step guide to making your own pri-
vate confession about pent-up anger, hostility, and resentment.
Leaving out the four-letter words
Lisa (see the introduction of this chapter) would be far better off and less apt
to end up assaulting her husband if she referred to him as an “empty head” —
a head that apparently doesn’t think about helping around the house or shar-
ing some intimate moments with his wife — rather than a “@#$%head.”
Four-letter words are, by definition, incendiary. They add gasoline to the fire
and only heighten emotions and increase the probability of some type of
physical aggression. They’re meant to hurt, not educate. And, they cause the
70
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

person to whom they’re directed to defend himself — either by withdrawing
(tuning out what you’re saying) or engaging in similar behavior. So now you
have two people swearing at each other, which, to quote Bill Shakespeare,
amounts to “sound and fury signifying nothing.”
Try to distance yourself from anger-laced profanity by starting with the word
I rather than you — “I’m furious” rather than “You’re a damn idiot!” Better
yet, enlarge your emotional vocabulary to include other words that are syn-
onymous with anger, for example: irritated, incensed, exasperated, annoyed,
displeased, enraged, outraged, disgusted, riled, vexed, or piqued.
Put yourself in the other person’s shoes and ask yourself how you would feel
if someone called you a “@#$%head” or worse. If he were angry with you,
what would you want him to say instead?
Stay focused
When you start speaking out in anger, you may lose sight of the issue, prob-
lem, or circumstance that initially provoked you. Your anger heads off on a
tangent, jumping from one grievance to another midstream. What starts out
as “I asked you to stop at the store for me and you forgot” suddenly evolves
into “You never help out around here. You don’t listen to me. You don’t care
about me at all. I don’t know why I married you in the first place!”
You’d be surprised at how many of my anger-management clients describe
some horrific incident involving anger, but then when I ask them what started
the angry exchange they say, “Beats me. All I know is that one minute we
were having a civil conversation and the next minute I was yelling and pound-
ing my fist into the wall.”
The more intense your anger, the more likely the emotion itself will distract
you from the issue at hand. Blind rage (see Chapter 7) is so unfocused that
after you calm down, most likely you won’t remember anything that you said
or did. One way to remain in control of your anger is to stay focused on what
it is you’re angry about. Keep your eye on the ball, and things are less likely
to get out of control.
Keep it short — and breathe
Constructive anger expression should be a give-and-take proposition. You
give out your feelings and let others take in their meaning. The best way to
lose your audience — and ensure that your message is not heard — is to go
71
Chapter 5: Speaking Out in Anger

on and on and on . . . ranting. By all means, speak out in anger, but keep it
short. Neurological sciences tell us that human beings can only digest (and
remember) so much information at a time. That’s why telephone numbers are
limited to seven digits — the human brain can only remember seven units of
information. Speaking out in anger for five minutes is like asking someone to
remember a 50-digit number. It can’t be done! So, no wonder kids never
remember what their parents tell them when the parents are angry — and
you thought they just weren’t listening. My advice is to speak out in anger
one minute at a time. Then take a breath and let the other person respond.
That will also keep the intensity of your anger from accelerating, which is
what you want, right? If the person you’re angry at reacts defensively, let him
have his say — don’t interrupt — and then resume expressing how you feel
for another minute and take another breath.
It’s Not What You Say, 
It’s How You Say It
The louder you speak, the less people hear what you have to say. Your mes-
sage gets lost in your overheated dialogue. Anger can be an effective means
of communication, but if you want to be heard, you have to pay attention to
two aspects of your speech:
 Volume: The power and fullness of your words. The angrier you are, the
louder you sound. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to tell the dif-
ference between a person who is irritated versus someone who is in a
full-blown rage.
 Pace: The speed or velocity with which you speak. As your anger accel-
erates, you find yourself speaking faster and faster. There is a pressured
quality to what you’re saying — as if the angry words can’t get out fast
enough.
Start paying more attention to how you speak when you get angry. If you hear
yourself getting too loud, talking too rapidly, and/or sounding shrill, adjust
your speech accordingly. Think of this as an effort on your part to literally
fine-tune how you speak out in anger.
72

Chapter 5: Speaking Out in Anger
The escalation effect
Professor Aron Wolfe Siegman at the University
of Maryland, Baltimore County, found that when
people speak out in anger, their speech tends to
get louder and faster as they go. Anger arouses
your nervous system and, among other things,
your heart rate begins to increase. As your
heart beats faster, it fuels the intensity of your
vocal response. And the louder and more rapid
your speech, the angrier you get. You’re quickly
caught up in a vicious cycle that begins to feed
on itself. (I wish I had a dollar for every client
who said, “I don’t know what happened — I
was just telling my wife how irritated I was and
the next thing I knew I was ranting and raving
and scaring her half to death.”)
The good news as far as anger management is
concerned is that you can reduce the intensity
of your emotion by ratcheting down the your
speech. You don’t have to necessarily change
what you’re saying (unless it includes four-letter
words!), just how you say it.
Professor Siegman also noted in his experi-
ments that human beings tend to mimic or
match the other person’s vocal style. The louder
you are when you get angry, the louder I am in
response. And so it goes. This type of recipro-
cal exchange also serves to accelerate anger
to the point where it’s often difficult to control.
This vicious cycle of anger-arousal tone can
have dire health consequences over time.
People who engage in this type of outrageous
dialogue are far more at risk for developing
coronary heart disease. So, not only are you
taking the heart (and spirit) out of the person on
the receiving end of your angry tirade, but you
also may slowly but surely be killing yourself!
Whenever you find yourself on the verge of
losing your cool (see Chapter 6), ask yourself
this question: Is this worth raising my blood
pressure, wearing out my cardiovascular
system, and eventually causing a heart attack?
If not, it’s time for some good old-fashioned
anger management.
In my work with angry adolescents, I’m often
confronted verbally by a youngster who is obvi-
ously in an over-aroused state. I respond (not
react!) in a firm, but even-toned fashion. The last
thing the kid needs is for me to help exacerbate
his rage. Initially, he may accelerate on his own,
but I continue to respond to him without any
change in the tone of my voice. Most often, the
next thing that happens is that he begins to tone
his angry rhetoric down — in other words, if I
don’t match his vocalizations (yelling back), then
he matches mine. This is a great way to defuse
someone else’s anger. So next time you’re faced
with someone who’s getting upset, try to remain
calm and defuse the situation.

Keeping Your Cool
In This Chapter
 Monitoring your anger
 Forgoing your initial reaction
 Giving yourself enough time to respond appropriately
 Calming yourself down
 Asking the critical questions
 Choosing the best response
M
ost people react in anger when they’re provoked. You don’t think
about it — you just react. You react instinctively and your reactions
are always the same. You pout; you shout; you ridicule the person who pro-
voked you; you lash out and hit something or someone; or, you just stomp off
in a fury. In other words, you lose your cool!
Losing your cool is easy. That’s why millions of us do it more than we should.
Keeping your cool is the challenge. Basically, it comes down to taking control
of this thing called anger before it takes control of you. Responding to anger
means just that — exerting some mindful control over your emotions rather
than letting your anger play itself out in a mindless sort of way.
The approach I outline in this chapter offers a simple, straightforward set of
strategies for defusing anger at the very moment you begin to experience it.
It’s a set of strategies that only takes 90 seconds to accomplish. The key to
this approach is to focus on your anger and your reactions to your anger, not
the source of your anger (the thing that triggered it). This means turning
your attention inward — on yourself — as a means of controlling how intense
your anger is and how long it lasts. You can’t manage anger if you’re always
trying to manage the circumstances (people, things) that unleashed it.
Letting go of the grievance and asserting some self-control is how you
manage today’s anger.

Choose to Respond Rather Than React
Anger therapists who argue that anger is a choice always amuse me. I’m sure
they mean well, but they’re wrong. The initial feeling of anger is no more the
result of conscious choice than other emotions such as joy, sadness, or fear.
It just happens!
Anger is your nervous system’s intuitive reaction to some perceived threat or
danger. The choice has to do with what comes after you feel angry — that is,
how you act and whether you continue to feel angry.
Ask yourself the following questions:
 For the rest of your life, do you want to simply react to your anger in the
same old mindless, predictable way you always have?
 Do you want to always be a victim of your emotions?
 Do you want to continue to apologize for your angry reactions by telling
those you hurt, “I’m sorry, I don’t know what came over me. I promise I
won’t act that way ever again”?
 Do you want others to begin to judge you by your angry reactions (for
example, “Stay away from that guy, he’s got a bad temper!”)?
I’m betting that your answer to each of these questions is a very clear “No!”
More than likely, you’re ready for a change. So, before you do anything else,
you need to make the decision to respond rather than react to your anger.

Eddie saves his job
One of my clients — I’ll call him Eddie — started
out skeptical, but soon became a believer. His
employer, who made it clear that the next time
Eddie lost his temper he would also lose his job,
referred him for anger management. Eddie
didn’t have the time or patience to examine all
the reasons he found himself angry so much of
the time. Time was short, and the prospect of
losing his job was not appealing. He needed a
solution and he needed it now!
Saying that Eddie was doubtful about the poten-
tial effectiveness of anger management would
be an understatement. But he was willing to
give it a chance. A week after I introduced
Eddie to the strategies in this chapter, he came
in to my office saying enthusiastically, “Man,
you saved my job! My boss got in my face at
work this morning and my first impulse was to
get right back in his. But then I thought about
what you said about responding to anger —
mine versus his — and I handled things in a
whole different way. Not only did I keep my job,
but he ended up calming down and then apolo-
gizing to me for his anger.”

Granted, this strategy is a mental one (as all choices are), but it nevertheless
is a strategy, and a crucial one at that. To begin to understand the basic dif-
ferences between reacting and responding to anger, consider Table 6-1.

What happens, you ask, if I choose to continue reacting as I always have to
my anger? Don’t I have a right to react to my anger any way I want to? Of
course you do, as long as you’re willing to keep paying the same conse-
quences you always have, or worse. You can keep apologizing, trying to undo
the harm your anger has done. You can continue down this path to a point
where anger ends up poisoning your whole life (see Chapter 3). But then
reacting is a conscious choice on your part. You can say loud and proud, “I
choose to lose my cool. That’s just the way I am. So there!” That’s fine. But at
least that decision makes you responsible for the outcome of your reactive
anger, no matter how negative, and you’re no longer a victim of your emotion.
And if you are not ready to take that different path now, maybe you will be
after you’ve read this book.
Breaking your lifelong habits 
of reacting to anger
Reacting to anger may be a habit you’ve formed over a lifetime, so don’t be
discouraged if you have trouble when you first try to avoid the reaction and
focus on the response. The difficulty you’re having may stem from things that
have happened in your past that conditioned you to be a reactive person. Or,
it may reflect an impulsive temperament that you inherited at birth. Either
way, it’s a habit that needs to be broken if you’re going to get control of your
anger.

Chapter 6: Keeping Your Cool

Sam first began to have explosive anger when he was a teenager, defending
himself from bullies in high school. His family moved into a new neighbor-
hood and he was an outsider. “They picked on me and I had to take care of
myself. I had to fight for everything I got,” he explained. Sam’s problem was
that he continued this fight for the rest of his life with his wife, children,
neighbors, and co-workers.
Linda grew up in an abusive, alcoholic family and found out early on to react
in anger as a way of surviving. Unfortunately, at the same time, anger kept
her from accomplishing all the things she wanted to in life. “My anger hurt
me. It kept me from having things that people I grew up with had, like a col-
lege education and a good job,” she now laments.
Chris has always had a problem with outbursts of anger. His fuse is short. His
anger doesn’t build up slowly. It just comes on all of a sudden, as if a switch
is thrown. When he was a child, his mother would tell him, “If people push
you, you need to walk away.” Good advice. But he couldn’t do it then, and he
still can’t do it at age 31.
Think childhood baggage might influence your tendency to be a “hot reactor”
when it comes to handling anger? It probably does if your parents were

 Rigorous

 Unbearable
 High strung
 Highly sensitive
 Nervous
 Excitable
 Easily aroused
 Easily stirred into action
 Tense
 On edge
 Keyed up
The nice thing about habits is that you can change them at any point in your
life. Some of my most successful clients, in fact, have been folks in their 50s
and 60s. Who says old dogs can’t learn new tricks?
Avoiding the company of other angerholics
Your attempts to stop reacting and make the choice to respond to anger may
also be difficult because you’re surrounded by people with excessive anger.
You know what they say about birds of a feather — they tend to flock
together, which means you’ve probably actively sought the companionship of
others with the same temperament. There are three reasons for this:
 Your style of reacting to anger leads you into life circumstances where
your emotional behavior finds a suitable fit. For example, most of the
corporate executives I work with tend to be very angry people. They
pretty much all made it to the top of the organization by using anger to
compete with their peers and control their subordinates. To hear them
tell it, anger works!
 Angry, antisocial people tend to select peers who also engage in outra-
geous behavior. Tantrum-prone men and women, for example, are likely
to date and marry other men and women who too are easily angered. In
effect, you choose what’s familiar.
 By engaging in intense bouts of anger you’re apt to be ostracized by
mainstream society; people who, for the most part, handle anger in
appropriate and mature ways. Unfortunately, this means that you’re
denied an opportunity for corrective feedback that might otherwise
come from friends and loved ones, who instead distance themselves
from your anger. So, you seek out the company of those who will both
tolerate and condone your outbursts.
79
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Cool

What you need are some anger allies, the kind of people who can help you
form new habits of responding effectively to anger. Look for people who:
 Show by personal example how to express anger in a healthy way
 Will actively listen and support your efforts to bring your anger under
control
 Are nonjudgmental
 Have conquered their own anger demons
 Are patient
 Are compassionate, appreciating what a burden excessive anger is
 Don’t assume that what worked for them in bringing their anger under
control will necessarily work for you
 Are willing to be there for you at a time of emotional crisis
 Don’t pretend to have all the answers
 Are willing to help, but are not willing to be responsible for your anger —
that’s your job!
You may have to distance yourself from the flock, whether that represents a
group of angry peers or angry family members. Walking away from your
angry friends takes a good deal of courage and a lot of willpower, but you can
do it — and you’ll see the positive benefits in your own life very soon!
Assessing Your Anger
The first, and most critical, step in managing anger at the moment you experi-
ence it is to assess the intensity of the feeling. I refer to this as the rate-and-
label step.
To assess your own anger, follow these steps:
1. Think of a number between 1 and 10 that best describes the intensity
of your emotion, with 1 being mild and 10 being severe.
A rating of 2, for example, suggests a barely noticeable change in your
emotional state, whereas a rating of 8 signifies strong negative feelings.
Focus especially on the physical side of anger — how tense, aroused, or
agitated you feel.
2. Convert the number rating into a label that aptly defines just how
angry you are at this moment.
80
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

Basically, anger is experienced at three distinct levels. A rating between
1 and 3 suggests that you’re annoyed or irritated. A rating between 4 and
6 is typical of folks who are just plain mad. And, finally, if you rated your-
self somewhere between 7 and 10, like it or not, you’re in a state of rage.
Anger ratings are like golf — the lower the number, the better off you are!
Quantifying anger with numbers gives you useful information:
 Numbers tell you how close you are to losing control. You’re more
likely to lose control when you find yourself extremely mad or at the
point of rage than you are if you’re just irritated.
 Numbers tell you how much of a window of opportunity you have to
retain control of your anger. If you start out with a rating of 4, you obvi-
ously have more time to turn things around than if you begin with a 6,
where you’re only one tick away from rage.
 Numbers provide a baseline from which you can measure progress. If
you start out with feelings of rage and, after employing the strategies I
outline in this chapter, you find yourself only just plain mad, that’s
progress.
Be Patient
Emotions, like anger, are by their very nature transient experiences. Each
episode of anger has a beginning point (onset), a middle phase (where it
peaks and begins to recede), and an end point (resolution). Emotions also
work on the principle of gravity — what goes up must inevitably come down.
Anger always resolves itself and will actually do so without any effort on your
part. The average adult is over his anger within five to ten minutes. You don’t
have to react in an attempt to make anger subside. The relief you’re seeking
from the tension and thoughts that accompany anger will come if you just
give it enough time to pass. In fact, time is your ally. The real paradox here is
that the more time you allow yourself to be angry, the sooner you’ll be free of
this emotion.
In order to give yourself enough time, follow these tips:
 Remind yourself that time is on your side. No one, not the angriest
person alive, stays angry very long.
 Remember that patience is a virtue. No one ever had a heart attack or
died an early death as a result of being too patient.
 Repeat to yourself as many times as necessary, “This too shall pass.”
Sometimes a little wisdom goes a long way.
 Say to yourself repeatedly, “Less is more.” In managing an episode of
anger, it often pays to take a more passive posture.

Chapter 6: Keeping Your Cool

Take a Deep Breath
Anger arouses human beings. Their autonomic nervous system gets excited
and floods the body with adrenaline. Blood pressure, heart rate, muscle ten-
sion, the hairs on the back of your neck — everything goes up! The angry
person is instantly prepared for the attack as a way of defending himself from
impending harm. This is, in essence, the physical side of reacting in anger.
Responding to anger requires that you begin to reverse this process and calm
yourself down. In the following sections, I give you a few options for doing
exactly that.
The relaxation response
Everyone has a natural protective mechanism to override the physical ten-
sion that accompanies anger. This protective mechanism is the relaxation
response. To relax in the moment, all you need to do is pause long enough to
take a few deep breaths. Breathing away the angry tension you’re feeling and
replacing it with a feeling of relaxation is as simple as one, two, three:
1. Take a deep, exaggerated breath in through your nose.
2. Hold the breath for a count of one.
3. Now, exhale in an exaggerated way through your mouth.
Repeat the exercise at least ten times (more if you want, depending on the
intensity of your anger), being fully conscious of your breathing throughout.
Think the word release with each exhale. This is your mind’s command to the
body to let go of this unwanted tension. Your body will follow the command —
it’s just the way the mind and body work!
82
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 
Too angry? Walk away
A group of 115 eighth graders were surveyed as
to how intense their anger was and how they
reacted/responded when they got angry.
Interestingly, kids who reported the most
intense anger and who also tended to react by
venting their anger on others took four times
longer to calm down than did their counterparts
who were just as angry, but who chose to
respond to their emotion by walking away and
letting their anger subside on its own. The
eighth graders who vented, on average, were
still angry 1 to 2 hours later, whereas those who
walked away got over their anger in less than
30 minutes.

The power of quiet
Quiet is the natural state of the body at rest. Venting your anger verbally only
adds more tension, further elevating your heart rate, blood pressure, and so
on. Just by being quiet for a few moments, while you continue to formulate
your response to anger, you’ll begin to calm down. This simple principle
underlies the advice of one leading anger expert, who says the first thing the
angry person should do is to shut up.
Lighten up
If you want to stay angry (or worse yet get even angrier), then by all means
stay serious. Remind yourself that anger is no laughing matter. Don’t even
think about smiling. And, for goodness sake, do not try to find the humor in
whatever situation provoked your temper.
However, if you’re trying to calm yourself down, you need to lighten up. For
example, if you feel compelled to say something to the person at whom
you’re angry, start by saying, “You know it’s funny that. . . .”
Or do what Fred did when another angry person hollered at him to “Go to
hell!” Fred thought for a minute and then said, “Good idea. Except that I’ve
already been there. Spent three years there, in fact, and I don’t want to go
back. It’s called Galveston, Texas.” Fred was laughing and the other man fell
silent. (All kinds of people like Galveston, of course — the point is to think of
something that you find funny when you’re angry, because it’s hard to be
angry while you’re laughing.)
Inoculate yourself
To inoculate yourself against the rising tide of angry tension, you can engage in
positive self-talk by repeating (silently or out loud) phrases such as the following:
 “Easy does it. Don’t get so upset.”
 “That person may not be in control, but I am.”
 “That tension in my forehead is normal given how angry I am. If I just
relax, it’ll go away.”
 “As the saying goes, this too shall pass.”
 “I’m in the eye of the (anger) hurricane. It’s safe here.”

Chapter 6: Keeping Your Cool

Ask Yourself Four Crucial Questions
You can’t manage something that you don’t understand. You have to analyze
your feelings in order to respond to them in a healthy and appropriate way. You
can do this quickly and easily by asking yourself the following four questions.
Who am I really angry at?
The answer to this question may, at first, seem simple: “The person who just
provoked me!” But if you look a little closer, this is often not the case at all.
The truth is that you may carry pent-up, unresolved anger from one situation
or source to another, without realizing it. Then you end up getting angry at
the wrong person and experiencing angry feelings that are stronger than war-
ranted at the time.
Consider the case of an angry youngster who comes to school each day,
already angry at her parents and further irritated by having to deal with her
peers on the bus. When the teacher tells her to take a seat, the kid reacts by
yelling, “Don’t tell me what to do, bitch!” Now, is this child really that angry
first thing in the morning simply because the teacher invited her to sit down?
The reality is, the kid is angry with her parents and the kids on the bus.
So ask yourself: Who am I really angry at?
Is this where I want to be angry?
Unfortunately, you don’t usually get to pick the time and place of your anger.
More often than not, anger finds you at an inopportune moment.
Nancy found herself angry at a co-worker just as she was about to leave work
on Friday afternoon for a long-anticipated fun weekend at the beach with her
friends. Clearly, she had a dilemma. Give in to her anger that afternoon and
risk continuing to be angry and spoiling her weekend, or put her anger on
hold and deal with it when she returns to the office on Monday?
Think about whether this is the right time and place for you to be angry.
Why am I angry?
It is possible that, because anger is often an instinctive, thoughtless reaction,
you may actually not know why you’re angry. You just know that you’re angry,
but you don’t have a clue what the underlying issue is — the thing that
sparked your emotion. The most common triggers for anger are
84
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

 Someone attacking your self-esteem through some type of verbal or
physical abuse.
 Someone or something preventing you from reaching a desired goal.
This is even more anger provoking if you feel you’re entitled to that goal
or it’s something you’re strongly committed to.
 Someone violating your basic moral principles — fairness, equity,
honesty, and responsibility. Again, the more strongly committed you
are to those particular values, the angrier you become.
 A situation where you feel helpless, unable to correct or fix something
that has gone wrong.
Is the intensity of my anger at this
moment consistent with why I’m angry?
Using the earlier example, even if the student is angry at the teacher for
telling her to take a seat, does that justify a feeling of rage? Irritation maybe,
but rage no. This is where most people get into trouble with their anger —
the intensity of their anger is too much for whatever triggers it.
David kissed his wife goodbye and headed out for work one morning. He
stopped to get a glass of orange juice from the refrigerator. Seeing that there
was none there, he immediately flew up the stairs to the bedroom where his
wife was and proceeded to yell at her for ten minutes. When asked whether he
thought his rage was justified, he calmly said, “Absolutely, she knows that I like
my orange juice in the morning. She should make sure that we don’t run out.”
You can often find justification for irritation and anger, but there is never a
justification for rage.
What Are My Options?
You can choose among an infinite number of responses to your anger. Some
of those options are aggressive (yelling at or hitting someone). Others
involve retreating from your anger (just walking away). Still others involve
some type of assertive response on your part (standing your ground and
saying that you’re angry but in a nonaggressive manner). The real question
is, what’s the best way for you to respond in this particular situation? In the
following sections, I fill you in.
85
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Cool

Always give yourself three ways to go
Give yourself a choice of at least three ways to respond to your anger. If you
give yourself only one option (for example, cursing), you really have no
choice about what to do next — choice requires at least two possibilities.
Plus, no single option (even though it may be your favorite) fits every situa-
tion where you find yourself experiencing anger. When you get mad over a
disagreement with a friend, for example, you could say, “Fine, I guess we’ll
just have to agree to disagree” and then walk away; you could snap back
aggressively, saying, “You’re wrong, dead wrong, and I’m tired of listening to
your bitching!”; or you could say, “I think with some more discussion I can
convince you that you’re mistaken in how you see things, but right now I’m
too annoyed to do that. So, if it’s all right, I’ll get back to you later and we can
talk some more.”
There is nothing wrong with having an option that involves some type of
aggressive response. The problem comes when that is your only option!
Consider the consequences 
of each response
When human beings react to their emotions, they never have time to consider
the consequences. When they respond to these same feelings and circum-
stances, they do have time.
After you come up with your three options for responding (see the preceding
section), and when you’re next faced with a situation that makes you angry,
take a minute and ask yourself “What is likely to happen if I choose response
option #1? What about if I try option #2? And what if I choose option #3?”
Each of these options has different consequences, positive and negative,
immediately and later on.
Emotions are transient — they come and go. But you have to live with (and
often pay for) the consequences of your responses long afterward.
Consider what happens when you lose your cool:
 Your blood pressure goes up, in some cases dangerously high.
 You feel like you’re going to burst or explode.
 Your heart pounds.
 You feel a knot in your stomach.
 You feel overwhelmed.
86
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 

 You lose your concentration, focusing only on your anger.
 You feel depressed and unhappy.
 You feel ashamed, embarrassed, and guilty.
 You feel nervous and agitated.
 Other people have hurt feelings because of your anger.
 Other people become defiant.
 Other people become indifferent to you.
 Other people avoid you.
 Other people lose their respect for you.
Now, consider what happens when you keep your cool:
 You calm down quicker.
 Other people maintain their respect for you.
 Other people are more likely to approach you.
 You’re more likely to come up with constructive solutions to problems.
 You minimize future conflict.
 You’re more likely to understand the other person’s point of view.
 You and the other person leave the situation feeling good.
 You’re more empathetic.
 You have lower blood pressure.
 You feel less agitated.
 You leave the situation not holding a grudge.
 You’re a much more agreeable person.
87
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Cool
Motives matter
Given a choice of how to respond to anger,
females will most often act in a way that lets the
person who made them mad know what they’re
feeling and what they’re thinking, whereas
males are much more likely to choose a
response that allows them to blow off steam.
Unfortunately, the pleasure males feel from 
the immediate release of angry tension is far
outweighed by the long-term negative conse-
quences associated with such outbursts. Anger
management is, to a large extent, about delay-
ing the instant gratification of answering anger
with anger so that you can experience the
eventual satisfaction of being in control of your
emotional life.

Don’t always exercise your 
right to be angry
I wish I had a dollar for every time some angry person has said to me,
“Dammit, I have a right to be angry!” My answer is always the same, “Of
course, you do — but that doesn’t mean that you also have the right to
express anger any way you feel like it.”
I believe in freedom of experience, including the freedom to experience emo-
tions. But wisdom sometimes dictates that we hold back on the expression of
that experience. To feel without acting is a choice, a difficult choice some-
times, and a mature, courageous choice, but a choice nonetheless.
Go Ahead and Respond
Eventually, you have to decide how you want to respond to your anger. So,
think about your options, consider the consequences of each, and think
about whether you want to exercise your fundamental right to express anger
in this situation. Then go ahead and respond.
Most likely, you’ll respond in a way that benefits you more than it hurts you.
But if you choose to respond in an aggressive manner (for example, by
yelling), so be it. If you’ve really taken the time to consider the conse-
quences, though, you probably won’t waste your energy yelling. (And if you
do, you’ll see the consequences of your yelling, and next time, you may think
even harder before you respond in that way.)
88
Part II: Managing Your Anger Today 
Advantage females
When 518 adolescents were asked how they
would react/respond to anger from a peer, the
most prevalent response was to answer anger
with anger. Forty-two percent of boys chose this
reactive means of protecting themselves from
the other person’s angry behavior, as compared
to 32 percent of girls. Contrast this with the find-
ing that only 28 percent of the boys chose to
respond in a more mature fashion — by walking
away in order to cool down and then returning
to discuss the problem they had with the other
youngster — whereas more girls (39 percent)
chose this response. Females have a clear
advantage even at this early age in managing
their anger, a trend that appears to continue
throughout life.

Now Reward Yourself
If you decided to respond (not react) to today’s anger in a different way than
you have in the past, feel good about yourself. There is nothing like the feel-
ing of being in charge of your emotions. You need to celebrate the moment by
rewarding yourself for making a healthy choice. That’s how one-time experi-
ences become lifelong habits.
A long-held tradition of the science of psychology is that human beings learn
to behave as a function of consequences. It’s really quite simple: If you do
something and you get a reward, you repeat the same behavior, looking for
the same reward. If you do something and you get no reward or, worse,
you’re punished for what you did, you won’t repeat the behavior. This is the
basis of all rat psychology and, as one leading psychologist once said,
“People are at least as smart as rats!” Rewarding positive behavior is how
habits — patterns of behavior that persist over time and that you do auto-
matically, without any conscious effort on your part — are formed. Repetition
by itself is not enough to build a new habit; it must be followed by reward.
So, whenever you use the anger management strategies outlined in this book,
be sure to do something to reward yourself. Here are some possibilities:
 Reach over and pat yourself on the back and say “Good job!”
 Say to yourself quietly or aloud, “Good for me. Couldn’t happen to a
nicer guy.”
 Sit quietly and reflect on the feeling of accomplishment you feel at
this moment.
 Share your triumph over today’s anger with someone you care about.
 Treat yourself to something special. Buy a book or a CD that you’ve
been wanting, stop for a coffee mocha, or buy a lottery ticket (keeping
your cool may really pay off!).
 Put a dollar bill in a special anger-management jar. When you accumu-
late enough money, use it to indulge yourself. Seeing that jar filling up
will be a pretty strong reward in and of itself.
 Share your triumph over today’s anger with a higher power in a
moment of thankful prayer.
 Think for a minute about all the negative consequences you didn’t
have to pay this time because you kept your cool. Experience the joy of
what didn’t happen!
 Repeat with conviction, “I have control of anger; anger does not have
control over me.”

It’s never too late to figure out how to keep your cool
A client of mine — I’ll call him Frank — had a
terrible temper his whole life. It ruined his
health, caused him to lose most of his friends,
but most of all it led to an estranged relationship
with his only child. Frank had been so angry
during those child-rearing years that he found
himself increasingly distant from his son — both
geographically and emotionally. Frank said that
whenever his son called home and Frank
answered, his son would immediately say, “Let
me speak to mother.” The only things Frank
knew about his son (or his grandchildren) he
found out secondhand from his wife.
But then Frank did a curious (and courageous)
thing at the age of 58: He entered an anger-man-
agement program and figured out how to con-
trol his temper for the first time ever. Now when
his son calls and Frank says “Wait, let me get
your mother,” his son replies “No, I wanted to
talk with you. How are you feeling? What are
you doing?” Frank and his son enjoy a relation-
ship that neither one of them thought would
ever be possible. By learning to keep his cool,
Frank, now 67, gained a son. And he’s a very
happy man!

Preventing Anger
Tomorrow

In this part . . .
I
tell you how to manage anger before it happens. 
That’s right: You can avoid getting angry tomorrow 
by the things you do today. In this part, I show you how 
to create your own recipe for defusing your capacity for
anger. If you don’t want to be a victim of blind rage, you
have to open your eyes to the way life is instead of
dwelling on how you want it to be.
Here you also discover why you need to stop saying you’re
“fine” when you’re not. Hiding anger may be civilized, but
it sure isn’t healthy. In this part, you find out why you’re so
dissatisfied with your life and what you can do to remedy
that. First, you need to make your own private confession
about just how angry you are and why. Then you can quit
all that Type A behavior — competition, obsessing about
time, and a slavish devotion to work — and enjoy yourself
for who, not what, you are. Finally, you can make anger
your ally rather than your enemy — this approach is called
using anger constructively, and it’s a whole new way of deal-
ing with your emotion.

ertain points of view invite anger.
Take Walter, for example. He’s a man in his early 60s, likeable, intelligent, edu-
cated, but always quick to see some evil intent in the actions of others. If he
calls someone and leaves a message asking him to call back right away, and if
that person doesn’t call right back, Walter’s initial thought is, “Damn him —
he has absolutely no respect for me!”
It would never occur to Walter that the person with whom he’s now irritated
has other important things to do as well, or that he’s stuck somewhere in
traffic, or that he’s home sick with a cold. Nope. As far as Walter is con-
cerned, there’s only one possible explanation for his phone not ringing — a
lack of respect — and that’s why Walter is angry.
If this were an isolated situation, it wouldn’t be a problem. But if you’re like
Walter, this is the way you view everything that comes your way throughout
the day. Every time someone cuts in front of you in traffic, every time you
have to wait more than two minutes before a waiter appears at your table in a
restaurant, every time your spouse forgets to pick up your dry cleaning, it’s
just one more example of evil intent — and one more occasion for what you
consider legitimate anger.
This chapter is all about the “mental” side of anger. You really can choose how
you view the actions of others, and you really can determine how the choices
you make affect your emotional life — and in this chapter, I show you how. I
explain why I think provocation is terribly overrated. And I also distinguish
between hostility and anger and explain why the two are inextricably linked.

Anger Is in the Eye of the Beholder
Humans are the only animals I know of who have a choice about how they
view the world. Cats, dogs, squirrels, hamsters, goldfish — they’re all crea-
tures of instinct, which means they respond in predictable ways that are
prewired into their nervous systems. Instincts are universal — scratch a bas-
sett hound’s tummy and he’ll instantly begin shaking his hind leg. All bassett
hounds do it and no one has a choice in the matter.
The miraculous thing about being human is that you are not ruled by instinct.
Not only do you have choices about how you respond to the world around
you (for example, when someone mistreats you), but, even before that, you
also have a choice about how you perceive that person’s actions. Do you
think she did that on purpose? Was it an accident, or did he do it deliber-
ately? Is the mistreatment specifically directed at you alone? Do you view this
as a catastrophe — a life-altering event? Is this something that you think
should not have happened? These questions are all ones your mind con-
siders, albeit unconsciously, before you have a chance to react — or, better
yet, respond to provocation (see Chapter 6 to better understand the differ-
ence between the reacting and responding).
You might say Mike is a born pessimist, but actually that’s not true. Human
beings aren’t born with attitudes — those attitudes come from life experi-
ence. What is true is that Mike is the product of an alcoholic home, where
things could be going well one minute and in complete chaos the next. He
found out as a child not to expect the good times to last and that he and the
rest of his family were always just one beer away from a family crisis. So, for
all of his adult life, Mike has expected that most things will eventually turn
out badly, given enough time. No matter how loving his wife is or how coop-
erative his children are, in the back of his mind he harbors this expectation
that any minute things will change for the worse — and he’s ready to react in
anger when that moment comes. Why will he get angry? It’s Mike’s way of
defending himself against chaos, a way of feeling in control — unlike when he
was a child hiding under the bed while his alcoholic father ranted and raved
well into the night.
Mike is unaware of how his early childhood influenced his view of the world.
Like most children of alcoholics, he figures that because he survived those
unpleasant years (physically at least), he’s okay. He also has no clue why he
loses his temper so easily. Mike may as well be a bassett hound!

Understanding why it’s 
called “blind” rage
The more intense your anger, the more it overpowers your central nervous
system — in other words, your brain. When you’re in a state of rage, you are,
for all intents and purposes, deaf, dumb, and blind to everything that’s going
on around you — something that is not true when you’re merely irritated or
just plain mad (see Chapter 2 for details on how to distinguish these three
levels of emotion). Rageful people only hear and feel their own anger and
they only see the target of their wrath. Ragers often experience emotional
amnesia after they calm down — they can’t even tell you exactly what trig-
gered their outrageous behavior in the first place, nor do they remember any
of what they said and did during their tirade. Ironically, they’re often shocked
by the harm they cause, and they can be genuinely remorseful. Problem is,
because they’re blind to their own dangerous emotions, they have difficulty
benefiting from these experiences.
The only way to effectively manage rage is to prevent it from happening in
the first place — to act before you enter into that state of uncontrollable emo-
tion. That’s why it is important to take immediate action when you first real-
ize you’re getting angry (see Chapter 4) and to follow my advice about how to
keep your cool (see Chapter 6).

Chapter 7: Adopting a New Perspective
The nocturnal rager
I’ve treated quite a few people who experi-
enced nocturnal rage — that is, rage that
occurred while they were sound asleep. One
man called my office quite upset, asking that I
see him right away. Why? Because he had
awakened to his wife’s screams only to find
himself on top of her in the bed with his fist
poised to strike her. She was hysterical and he
was absolutely mortified. This behavior was
unprovoked — they were both asleep at the
time — and it was totally foreign to his charac-
ter. For all his life, he had been a positive, easy-
going, non-angry man, who avoided conflict
wherever he found it. So, why this rage?
After I talked to him and heard his story, I knew
the answer. He had been bottling up all sorts of
stresses over the past year — not talking about
any of his concerns about losing his job, 
supporting his family, losing the new house he
had just bought, having his son leave home —
and the dam had finally burst. I suggested that
he start opening up and talking more with his
wife, who had always been supportive through-
out their long marriage. But he was hesitant to
burden her with his problems. He left my office
thanking me and believing that this would never
happen again.
Three days later, I got a second frantic call —
his screaming wife had awakened him again,
only this time after he had repeatedly punched
her in the head. He was ready to take my advice.
Bottom line: Take the blinders off and start
paying attention to all the things that are stress-
ing you out before the dam breaks and releases
all that pent-up emotion.

Choosing the lesser of two evils
The first few years after I moved to Virginia, I found myself experiencing a lot
of road rage. I had lived in several other states and it seemed to me that
Virginia drivers were “a bunch of idiots who were all out to kill me.” Talk
about being angry! A classic example is when I found myself driving down the
highway with no traffic either behind or in front of me, and up ahead was a
car on my side of the road ready to pull out. You would think the person
would wait until I passed before entering the highway, but no, he pulled out
right in front of me, forcing me to quickly swerve into the other lane in order
to avoid an accident. I thought to myself, “That SOB did that on purpose!”
One day I finally got tired of being angry all the time while I was driving, so I
decided to adopt a different perspective on the driving behavior of
Virginians. From that day to the present, I tell myself, “They’re not out to get
me. They’re not purposely trying to force me to hit my brakes and swerve.
They’re just plain ignorant — they don’t know any better.” Based on my new
perspective, I now always move into the other lane just as soon as I see a car
on my side of the highway no matter how close or far away. That way, the
other person’s ignorance doesn’t become my problem.
To me, my new viewpoint is what I would call choosing the lesser of two
evils: ignorant versus malevolent. I choose ignorant! It doesn’t mean that I
approve of the way these folks drive — only that I don’t get angry anymore.
Think of a situation that has left you feeling irritated, angry, or in a rage
lately. Ask yourself: What did that person do that elicited this emotion? And,
more important, why did he act that way? Now, see if you can come up with
two other alternative explanations for that person’s behavior. Take a piece of
paper and write down all three points of view. Consider how you will feel
based on each of these possibilities. Then pick the one that will produce the
least adverse emotional consequences — in other words, the lesser of three
evils.
For example, let’s say you’re irritated at your dentist for running late for your
scheduled appointment. Your first assumption is: “This guy is so greedy for
money that he’s packed his day with too many patients, and now we all have
to wait!” Okay, maybe that’s the case. But try to come up with two other rea-
sons he could be late. Maybe he had to spend extra time with a patient who
was really afraid of dentists. In order to help that patient through the exam,
the dentist had to take a little more time. How about another possibility?
Maybe the dentist’s mother is sick and he had to take a phone call from her
doctor about her condition. That could be it, too. Now, which of these scenar-
ios would upset you the least? Maybe it’s the sick mother. So now, just for the
sake of your own stress level, assume that his mother is sick. Take it another
96
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

step and try to empathize with him. Wow, it must be hard to have to see
patients and keep up such a cheerful façade when he’s upset about his
mother. Maybe if you’re understanding of him, you’ll help make his day a
little easier. (And if nothing else, you’ll have kept your irritation from turning
into anger and ruining your day.)
Accepting Life for What It Is, 
Not What It Should Be
Boy, wouldn’t it be nice if everything in your world was the way you thought
it should be? You wouldn’t get angry, if:
 The red light turned green when you thought it should.
 Your wife paid as much attention to you as you thought she should.
 Your kids respected you the way they should.
 Your employer compensated you the way it should.
 Your retirement fund increased the way you thought it should.
 Government officials did what they should to control the deficit.
 Tires lasted as long as they should.
 Your pants fit the way they should.
 Your children made the kind of grades they should.
 God answered your prayers the way He should.
 You had all the rain or sunshine you thought you should.
 People laughed at your jokes the way they should.
97
Chapter 7: Adopting a New Perspective
The parent-child dilemma
If you don’t want to be angry off and on for about
20 years running, don’t have children. Most of
the anger I see between family members, espe-
cially parents and children, has to do with dif-
ferences in their perceptions of how things
should be. For instance, parents think their kids
should obey their every command, keep a
respectful tone, and in one form or another
show their gratitude for all they’ve done for
them. Children — certainly adolescents — on
the other hand believe they should be free to do
what they want, should be able to talk to their
parents any way they feel like, and think parents
are only doing what they should be doing for
them, so they shouldn’t need any thanks.
Negotiating around all these shoulds is what
makes or breaks a parent-child relationship

The problem we all face, unfortunately, is that things don’t always work this
way. We’re forced to deal with life the way it actually is, rather than the way
we think it should be.
Begin paying attention to how many times you think or say the word should
in the course of a day. Each time you hear yourself saying “She should . . . ,”
stop and ask yourself the following three questions:
 Who says she shouldn’t act that way? Where is that written down? Is
that a fact or simply your opinion? At what point in life did you start
deciding how other people should act?
 Why shouldn’t she act that way? Isn’t she entitled to the same rights of
free speech and expression as you are? Shouldn’t she act according to
how she sees things? Why does your viewpoint count more than hers?
 Is the fact that she’s not acting as she should worth your getting angry
and perhaps ruining your day?
I used to get mad when my wife wasn’t ready to leave to go to a party when I
thought should be — so I paced around the house, getting more agitated by
the minute, repeatedly hollering up the stairs, “Are you ready yet? Don’t you
see what time it is?” and then pouting in the car as we drove to the party. It
took me half my life to realize two things: (1) That was a really a stupid way
to act and (2) None of that made my wife the least bit more punctual. Now, I
still get ready on time, but I go down into the den and cool my heels — and
my temper — until she appears and says “Okay, let’s go.”
Becoming More Tolerant
Anger is the emotion of intolerance. Intolerance means you don’t accept
another person’s viewpoint or behavior. Anger says that you think you’re
right and the other person is wrong. It can’t be any simpler than that.
Anger defends the listener against any change in his way of thinking. Instead
of accepting the challenge of an honest difference of opinion, the intolerant
person resorts to intimidation, insult, or withdrawal — all fueled by anger —
as a way of rigidly holding on to his beliefs.
The more intolerant a person, the more intense his anger.
98
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

The next time you find yourself getting angry about something another
person says or does, do the following:
 Remind yourself that if you’re secure in your way of thinking, you
have absolutely nothing to defend. Just because someone else thinks
differently from the way you think, doesn’t mean you’re wrong or that
you necessarily have to justify your own beliefs and actions.
 Instead of being defensive (that’s what intolerance is all about!), go on
the offense. Say to the other person, “Tell me more about that. I’d like to
understand how you arrived at that opinion. This is your chance to edu-
cate me.”
 Don’t personalize the conversation. Focus on issues not personalities.
Direct your commentary to the matter in dispute (for example, “I dis-
agree that parents should give birth-control pills to their teenage daugh-
ters”) rather than the person on the other end of the debate (“You’re
stupid for thinking that way!”).
 Look for points of agreement. Parents, for example, who are in a discus-
sion about whether to furnish birth-control pills to their daughters can
begin by agreeing (out loud) that they are, of course, both concerned
about the ultimate safety and well being of their kids.
 Avoid the use of expletives. Swearing and cursing only demeans the
other person and stifles any productive exchange of ideas. You’re better
off saying, “I really don’t know what to say when you act like that” than
saying, “You’re an ass, and you know it!”
 By all means, avoid contempt. Contempt — sighing, rolling your eyes —
not only conveys a sense of intolerance, it tells the other party you think
he (and his ideas) are utterly worthless. It’s just a way of saying, “I’m
better than you!”
Seeking diversity in all things
The good news is that, as far as I know, there is no gene for intolerance. It’s
an attitude that people pick up through life experience. If you grow up in a
family that tolerates differing points of view, you tend to be like that yourself.
The same is true if you’re raised in an intolerant family.
One antidote to intolerance — a black-and-white approach to life — is diver-
sity. Intolerance is one way of trying to simplify what is an ever-changing,
complex world. Diversity helps you expand your horizons and see that the
“sea of ideas, beliefs, and behavior” is vast and endless. There is, in fact, far
more gray than black and white. Truth typically is somewhere between what
“I” think and what “you” believe.
99
Chapter 7: Adopting a New Perspective

Diversity is easier to achieve that you may imagine. Here are some tips on
how to become a more worldly — and thus more tolerant — person:
 Read about religions different from your own. You can find For
Dummies books on the major world religions — and most bookstores are
filled with all kinds of religion titles.
 Buy newspapers from places other than where you live. If you’re from
a small town in the Midwest, subscribe to the New York Times. If you live
in New York City, have your aunt in upstate New York send you her
hometown paper.
 Every other time you go into a restaurant, try something new. This
forces you out of your comfort zone.
 Be adventurous throughout life.
 When you go to a party, look for the person you don’t already know
and start up a conversation. If you only talk to the people you know,
you’re less likely to discover something new.
 Travel as extensively as your pocketbook allows. And try to go to dif-
ferent regions of the country (or the world). When you’re there, spend
some time talking to the locals.
 Make a point of socializing with people from racial and ethnic back-
grounds other than your own.
 Read all editorials in the newspaper every day — not just those you
agree with.
 Visit museums and art galleries.
 Hang around with people of different ages. You’ll be amazed at how
differently folks much younger and older than you are think.
 Attend free lectures by local and out-of-town authorities on various
subjects. Most communities offer lecture series or similar cultural expe-
riences. If you live in a very small town, look to a bigger town nearby
and make a point of traveling there to take advantage of these things.
 Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut. Learn now, debate later.
Avoiding the media like the plague
A free press comes with a price. These days, especially with the advent of cable
news, the media has transformed itself into a polarizing point-counterpoint
expression of extreme viewpoints on virtually any topic you can imagine.
Exchanges between “experts” are purposefully intense, loud, argumentative,
and at times angry. Instead of expanding your intellect, the media foments
uncivil discourse and a climate of intolerance. If you weren’t angry before you
started watching cable news, you will be shortly.
100
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

Although televised media is without doubt more stimulating and entertaining,
it also arouses more passion. If you’re just interested in knowing what’s hap-
pening in the world around you — without all the angry rhetoric — you’re
much better off turning to print media (newspapers, news magazines) or
local radio and television.

Chapter 7: Adopting a New Perspective
Tired of listening to yourself?
For most of my adult life, I was an outspoken,
opinionated person, who — even though I didn’t
realize it at the time — tried to force my view-
point about how the world works on anyone
who would listen. Well, that all changed when I
went through a five-year period of depression
during which I was forced to finally listen to
what others had to say for once.
After I recovered from the depression, I found
that I was tired of always listening to my own
voice and I rather liked being an active listener.
For the first time in my life, I found that I was,
and always had been, surrounded by many
intelligent, interesting people, including my wife
and children, who were eager to share their
own unique takes on life, if allowed. What a
delightful surprise!
Jerry who?
Twenty years ago, back before workshops on
anger management were popular, I was invited
to conduct a seminar at Cape Cod. My daugh-
ter accompanied me, and one afternoon while
we had some free time she and I found our-
selves in a very nice gift shop specializing in
teddy bears. As we entered the shop, an elderly
woman — who turned out to be the owner —
welcomed us and said she would help us as
soon as she finished up with other customers.
She also asked us where we were from. I told
her Virginia, and she asked what city we lived
in. “Lynchburg,” I replied. “You know, the home
of Jerry Falwell.” The woman said, “I’m sorry, I
don’t know who that is.”
When she had finished with the other customer,
she came over and apologized for not knowing
who Reverend Falwell was. “That’s okay,” I said
“I just thought you might make the connection
because he’s on television so much.” She then
went on to tell us a fascinating story about how
when she was a young woman, she had suffered
from depression and had for years tried to get
help from scores of mental health providers —
all to no avail. But, then she came upon a behav-
ioral psychologist who asked her to begin keep-
ing track of situations that seemed to bring her
mood down. The one that mostly came to mind
was when she watched the news on TV. So, he
told her to quit watching it, which she did. And,
according to her, she had not been depressed
for the past 25 years. “Good for you,” I told her
“I think I’ll try that myself!” I believe the same
advice holds for anger.

Rarely does the media offer you “good news” — it’s slanted toward the nega-
tive. If you already have a pessimistic, cynical outlook or you’re in a bad
mood (see Chapter 19), the last thing you need is more negativity — which is
just one more thing that predisposes you to anger.
Figuring Out Where Hostility and
Resentment Come From
Hostility is an attitude — a feeling of ill will — that we attach to people and cir-
cumstances around us. Like resentment, hostility is a perspective that has a
circular relationship with emotions like anger and aggressive behavior. In other
words, hostile people more often find themselves angry, and vice versa —
anger tends to incite hostile thoughts. And, unlike anger, which comes and
goes, hostility can be extremely durable.
So, where do these negative attitudes come from? Two sources really:
 From your family: Like many other things, they are learned early in life.
 From your unexpressed, unresolved anger: Think about a cup that you
use to drink coffee out of every day. Now suppose you never wash out
that cup. What would happen? Each time you drank coffee, there would
be a slight residue left in the cup, which would eventually discolor the
insides of the cup and give the coffee poured into it each day a bitter
taste. That’s exactly what happens when you hide your emotions (see
Chapter 8) or when you have an unforgiving nature (see Chapter 13).
Hostility becomes that bitter taste that you have for life that discolors
how you view and interpret life around you. People generally do not
become hostile and resentful over night; it’s a slow and insidious
process.
Hostility and resentment also come from past experiences that carry over
into the present and future. They illustrate, in fact, exactly how yesterday’s
anger can become today’s anger, and today’s anger becomes tomorrow’s
anger.
To avoid being a hostile and resentful person, use the anger-management
strategies offered throughout this book and do the following:
 Acknowledge your anger as soon as you experience it.
 Use your anger to better understand yourself.
102
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

 Express your anger without venting (see Chapter 5).
 Stop saying you’re “fine” when you’re not.
 Confess your anger on a daily basis.
 Think of anger as your ally rather than your enemy.
 Find healthy ways — like exercise — to let off steam.
 Think of anger as a legitimate emotion just like love and joy.
 Start saying “Excuse you!” to people who treat you badly.
 Let yourself off the hook by forgiving others.
 Live in the present, not the past.
 Turn your resentments over to a higher power.
 Forgo reciprocity — there’s no such thing as getting even.
 Establish healthy boundaries between yourself and those you love the
most.
 Come back and discuss the reasons for your anger after you walk away.
 Be more charismatic.
 Practice stress inoculation.
 Balance out your life with positive experiences to offset the negative
ones.
103
Chapter 7: Adopting a New Perspective
Who’s more hostile — men or women?
Current research by psychologist Wolfgang
Linden and his colleagues at the University 
of British Columbia challenge the long-held
notion that women tend to suppress anger
more than men, which can lead to an increase 
in resentment. On the contrary, Linden found
that women tended to use different anger
coping techniques — for example, seeking
social support from other women with whom
they discuss their feelings — than their male
counterparts, who relied more on overt aggres-
sion (attack the source) as a means of express-
ing their anger. This suggests that women are
more likely to resolve their anger in a timely
fashion and not experience the residual effects
of chronic hostility.

When in Doubt, Be Assertive
If you lack assertiveness and never stand up for yourself, you’re probably 
full of resentment — and understandably so. Why? Because you’re a virtual
storehouse of accumulated frustration and anger. You never let your 
emotions — especially negative ones — see the light of day, so you never 
let go of them.
I’m reminded of the joke about the four old men who had played golf together
for more than three decades. They were always the first group off the tee on
Saturday morning and the first to return to the clubhouse. One morning, a
fellow golfer approached one of the men as they came in from play, asking
how they played that day. “It was rough” was the reply. Someone added, “You
know Harry that plays with us. He had a heart attack on the fourth hole.” “Oh
my God,” said the other man “what did you do?” “There was nothing we
could do,” the man said, “but hit the ball and drag Harry all the way to the
end.” Maybe the Harry you’re dragging around is your own old, unexpressed
anger that has now crystallized into that all-enduring attitude — hostility.
Want to let your Harry rest in peace? Consider asserting yourself in the fol-
lowing ways:
 If you’re not satisfied with the service you get in a restaurant, say some-
thing to the waiter or, better yet, the manager.
 Practice politely saying “no” when people (for example, aggressive sales
clerks) invade your personal space.
 If someone asks you to do something (or, worse yet, demands that you
do it), ask why before you act.
 Get used to returning defective merchandise to stores without feeling
embarrassed or apologetic.
 Don’t be afraid to argue with salespeople — it’s your money after all.
 If someone pushes her way in line ahead of you, say “Excuse you!” and
then nicely ask her to step to the rear.

Saying What You Feel
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of speaking openly
 Appreciating the downside of civility
 Asking yourself, “What am I not thinking (and talking) about?
 Releasing healthy anger
I
was listening to talk radio this morning and a man called in to share his
thoughts about burning the U.S. flag. He sounded like a mature guy, and he
was speaking in a civil tone. At one point, he said, “If people want to burn the
flag, that’s fine.” But then he corrected himself and said, “No, that’s not fine. It
irritates me, but I guess I mean that there’s nothing I can do to stop them.
But, no, it’s not fine.” It sounded like — in that moment — the man had found
his true voice.
How often do you find yourself being politically correct about emotion,
saying things are fine when they’re really not? If you often hide your real feel-
ings, what effect do you think that has on you? Do you find yourself feeling
disappointed, disillusioned, and disinterested with the world around you?
What do you believe would happen if you were more open and honest about
the things that make you angry?
In this chapter, I guide you through answering those questions and show you
how to open the door for some healthy expression. This chapter helps you
say what you feel rather than what other people may want to hear — and the
more you can do that, the better you’ll be able to manage your anger.
Why Hiding Your Emotions Isn’t Healthy
Emotions are, by their very nature, meant to be brief, transient experiences.
Typically, they come and go throughout the day — moving you in various
directions, as evidenced by changes in your behavior. Anger, for example,
triggers a fight-or-flight response that is prewired into your nervous system.
Not acting on an emotion like anger is unnatural and, in some instances, can

be unhealthy. Emotions reflect changes in physiology — elevations in blood
pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, and muscle tension — that are usually
harmless because they’re short lived (that is, if you express them). Emotions
that are not expressed remain trapped within your body, causing a sustained
state of physiological tension — and that can be deadly.
No such thing as unexpressed anger
Suggesting that anger is either expressed or unexpressed is actually untrue.
All anger is expressed — the question is how. You probably think that you’re
expressing your anger when you do so in a way that other people can see,
hear, or feel. Otherwise, you figure, you’re not expressing it. But the reality is
that all anger is expressed — some of it in ways that aren’t observable right
away. For example, you may not look or sound angry, but your anger may be
expressing itself in your cardiovascular system (through high blood pressure
or migraine headaches), your gastrointestinal system (through irritable
bowel syndrome [IBS] or a spastic colon), or your musculoskeletal system
(through TMJ or tension headaches).

The non-injury injury
Over the years, I’ve been impressed with how
many of my clients suffering from back pain
actually never had an injury to their backs. I
remember one man — a really nice guy — who
came in complaining of unremitting pain in his
lower back that he said began when he put his
foot on a shovel to dig a hole in sand, something
he did countless times over the years. That was
the injury that caused him unbearable pain,
resulted in extensive medical treatment, and
caused him to be unemployed.
Upon further investigation, it turned out that this
man had quit this same employer some years
before because he was dissatisfied (angry)
about low pay, lack of benefits, and mistreat-
ment by his foreman. He had taken a much
better job in another state and was quite happy
at work until his new employer unexpectedly
declared bankruptcy. He was then forced to
return to his old job — same low pay, lack of
benefits, and foreman — all the while feeling
both defeated and dejected. His way of coping
was to “grin and bear it,” absorb whatever mis-
treatment came his way, and never — I mean
never — let himself get angry.
Then, one day — like any other day — his back
suddenly went out. The result: He could get paid
without returning to work and also avoid deal-
ing with his boss. I agreed the man had been
injured — but it was his spirit that was injured,
not his back. After he went through my pain
rehabilitation program, where he got insight into
the inner dynamics of his back pain, he found
new employment and his back eventually quit
hurting.

Or anger may express itself in negative attitudes — pessimism, cynicism,
hopelessness, bitterness, and stubbornness — or some form of avoidance
behavior (giving people the silent treatment), oppositional behavior (“I don’t
think so!”), or passive-aggressive behavior (“I’m sorry — did you want some-
thing?”). Anger may also sour your mood and leave you feeling down or
depressed. You suddenly lose the enthusiasm you had previously. (For addi-
tional examples, take a look at the anger-health checklist in Chapter 3.)
Dissatisfaction can be lethal
Being chronically — morning, noon, and night — dissatisfied can be danger-
ous to your health. Dr. Ernest Harburg and his colleagues at the University of
Michigan did a study asking people how satisfied they were with their jobs.
They specifically asked the people how satisfied they were:
 That their job offered an opportunity to earn a higher salary
 That they had an opportunity to work with people who were friendly
and helpful
 With their ability to acquire new skills in their line of work
 With job security (were they not likely to get laid off or fired)
 That they were allowed to do those things they were best at on their
jobs
 That they had an opportunity to get ahead at work (be promoted)
He also asked questions to determine whether they tended to habitually
express or suppress their anger. Interestingly, what I found when I analyzed
these data was that those employees who were highly dissatisfied at work
but who suppressed their anger had, by far, the highest blood-pressure levels
on average — as compared to those who were highly satisfied with their
work or dissatisfied workers who expressed their anger in some way. And the
increase in blood pressure resulting from this combination of chronic dissat-
isfaction and suppressed anger was enough to place them at risk for poten-
tially lethal heart attacks and strokes.
The same, it turned out, was true when they asked similar questions to deter-
mine how satisfied these people were with their home/family situation. Again,
those who were the most dissatisfied but least expressive about their anger
had the highest blood pressure.

Chapter 8: Saying What You Feel

Being Civil Doesn’t Always 
Mean Being Nice
Being civil simply means being a good citizen — someone who operates
within the social rules of a society. It means acting toward others in ways that
show mutual respect. It means not being rude, insensitive, thoughtless, and
purposely antagonistic. On the other hand, it doesn’t mean that you’re
always nice, tolerant, or accepting of whatever mistreatment comes your
way. It doesn’t require that you be passive, someone’s doormat, or the
proverbial pushover. And, it doesn’t mean that you don’t ever experience or
express reasonable levels of anger.
Civil people get irritated and angry, but they express it in constructive ways
(see Chapter 11 for examples). They respond to their angry feelings instead
of reacting in some mindless, shoot-from-the-hip kind of way (see Chapter 6).
And they speak out in ways that inform and educate those within hearing dis-
tance about the issues that underlie their anger (see Chapter 5).

referred Carl for anger management. A man in
his late 50s, who had worked at the same job for
almost 20 years, Carl was now being disciplined
for several recent rather uncharacteristic out-
bursts of anger, directed at his immediate
supervisor. Carl had been given an ultimatum:
Learn to keep your cool or you’re fired! To make
matters worse, recent stresses at work had
suddenly caused Carl to have problems with his
blood pressure and cholesterol levels, even
though he had successfully managed both with
medication for years. The problem, as Carl saw
it, was that his boss was young, inexperienced,
and incompetent — in his words, “an idiot who
doesn’t have a clue about how we do things
around here.”
Clearly, Carl was dissatisfied — not with his
own work, but rather with how his new boss did
his. He had tried for the longest time to let things
ride and keep his dissatisfaction to himself, but
lately he had boiled over with anger. Given his
age, Carl couldn’t afford to lose his job and ben-
efits and he most assuredly didn’t want to
“stroke out” because of his job, but he was at a
loss as to what he could do to resolve his anger.
I suggested that he make a compromise — that
he be content to be satisfied with how he did his
job and let his boss answer to those above him
for his own mistakes. “Do your part as well as
ever, sign off on it, and if your boss screws
things up after that, that’s his problem,” I said.
“Just be responsible for yourself, not for the
whole world.”
It worked. I’m not sure how his boss is doing,
but Carl’s blood pressure and cholesterol levels
are once again stable, he hasn’t had any more
outbursts, and his human resources manager is
delighted with how things turned out. And he’s
still working!

Stop saying “I’m fine” when you’re not
You may have found how to avoid taking responsibility for your anger by
always saying “I’m fine!” even in circumstances where that’s far from the
truth. This response is an example of what politicians call a non-response
response. It’s a polite way of saying, “I’m not going to tell you how I feel.
Maybe I don’t trust whether you’ll accept my feelings. Maybe you’ll get mad
because I’m mad. Or maybe I don’t trust my feelings myself — should I really
feel that irritated?” You’d be surprised how many of my therapy clients, when
I ask them how they are, say, “Fine.” My immediate thought is, “Well, if you’re
fine, why are you sitting on my couch?”
The next time someone asks you how you feel about something, choose an
emotional label that fits the situation — for example, happy, sad, mad, glad.
Being honest about how you’re doing helps reduce your tension and can help
keep you from getting angrier.
Stop apologizing for what others do
When someone bumps into you out in public, don’t say, “Excuse me.” You
haven’t done anything wrong — he has. You’re not the inconsiderate person
here — he is. So, why should you apologize? Apologizing is what people do
when they take ownership for some misdeed. Unless you’re the one who
rammed into someone, you shouldn’t apologize. What you should do instead
is say, “Excuse you!” It’s a civil way of giving the person feedback about his
boorish behavior. (I’m not suggesting that everyone who bumps into you does
it intentionally — you still want to give people the benefit of the doubt — but
don’t apologize unless you were the one who slammed into him.)
If “Excuse you!” feels a bit rude, it’s okay to say “Pardon you” — it still puts
the responsibility where it belongs.

Chapter 8: Saying What You Feel
If you’re going to be Type A, be charismatic
Type A’s who are also charismatic — enthusi-
astic, inspiring, animated, and emotionally
expressive — appear less at risk for coronary
heart disease than Type A’s who lack this qual-
ity. How do you know if someone is charismatic?
They’re the ones who can’t keep still when the
music starts, who laugh outrageously when
they hear something funny, whose emotions
show on their face, and who aren’t shy around
strangers. They release a lot of tension by
expressing their feelings openly and accurately
with no real regard for what others might say or
think. It’s the quiet, stoic, nonexpressive Type A’s
— the ones who keep their hostility close to the
vest — whose health is in danger.

Apologizing for someone else’s behavior is often seen by them as a way of
condoning what they’re doing. If someone bumps into you, what is it that
you’re exuding — the fact that you had the audacity to be in their way? Is
that how you really feel and is that the message you want to send?
Express your anger without worrying 
that you’re being a bitch
Despite the advances women have made worldwide — political, economic,
social — some remnants of the old world order, in which there were different
standards of what constitutes acceptable emotional behavior among men
and women, remain. Even today, women who show signs of anger and who
express themselves in some assertive way are likely to be labeled a “bitch”
for doing so. No such reference is made to men who do exactly the same
thing. Many women are sensitive to this double standard and are hesitant to
be completely honest about their feelings unless those feelings are positive
ones. (The reverse is true when it comes to feelings such as grief, fear, and
depression. Men who openly acknowledge such feelings tend to be viewed —
by themselves and others — as weak and effeminate.)
If being a bitch means you admit it when you’re irritated or even angry, if it
means setting limits on the bad behavior of others, if it means saying “Well,
excuse you!” when it’s deserved, then my advice is to be a bitch. Be a proud
bitch, be an articulate (no profanity please) bitch, be a passionate bitch, be a
self-assured bitch, be a charismatic bitch, and be a hold-your-head-up-high-and-
look-your-adversary-in-the-eye bitch. And then let that be the other person’s
problem.
Stop Having Issues and 
Start Having Feelings
One of the trendy catchphrases used these days to describe people who are
in some type of conflict is, “She’s got issues.” Issues are those problematic sit-
uations that trigger emotions like fear, sadness, and anger. The problem I see,
though, is that many people are so focused on their issues that they lose
sight of what it is they’re actually feeling.
110
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

The following conversation with one of my anger-management clients illus-
trates how difficult it can be to get a person to stop having issues and start
having feelings:
Gentry: How have things been at work this week?
Client: The same. My supervisor is still not including me in things that go
on in the office, like a luncheon that was given for one of our staff mem-
bers who’s leaving. Everybody else, it seems, knew about it but me.
Gentry: And how did that make you feel?
Client: I didn’t think it was fair.
Gentry: That’s what you thought. I want to know how you felt about it.
Client: (Pause) I’m not sure what you want. It’s just another example of
how I’m excluded around the office.
Gentry: I get the part about being excluded. What I want you to tell me is
how you felt when you realized, once again, that you had been left out.
Client: (Exasperated) I told you — I thought it was unfair! I don’t know
what else you want me to say.
Gentry: Try this: When you found that you had been excluded from the
luncheon, did you feel happy, sad, mad, or glad? Choose one.
Client: You keep asking me how I feel about things. I don’t know. None of
those fit. I just thought it was unfair. (Looks perplexed.)
His employer had referred this man to me because he was seen as being
uncooperative with co-workers and insolent toward his boss, both of which
he denied. “I don’t know why they want me to come to anger management,
because I’m not angry,” he said. The problem, as I saw it, was that he was
angry (a natural response to being excluded). But instead of being able to say
how he felt, he acted out his anger through what his superior saw as opposi-
tional behavior. I believed him when he said he wasn’t angry — I don’t think
he realized he was.
Practice what I call feeling-cause language. Start with how you feel (“I am irri-
tated . . .”) and then identify the issue that provoked the feeling (“. . . because
I always seem to be excluded from whatever is going on in the office”). My
research has found that feeling-cause statements serve to reduce hostile
behavior in others and engender empathy — a concern for your welfare — in
the person with whom you have an issue. Would the client I mention earlier
have continued to be excluded by his supervisor if he had simply told him
how he felt and why he felt that way, instead of communicating his feelings
the way he did? Possibly, but you never know.

Chapter 8: Saying What You Feel

Walking Away and Still Having Your Say
If you give people a choice of how to respond to someone else’s anger (or
their own anger at someone else’s behavior), they’ll typically either stand
and fight back or run away. The old fight-or-flight response is built into your
nervous system. Unfortunately, neither of these choices results in an effec-
tive resolution of whatever it is that underlies the emotional response.
My friend Ernest Harburg at the University of Michigan classifies both of
these extreme responses under the heading of resentful anger coping, which
he contrasts with what he calls reflective coping (for example, talking to
someone about your anger after you’ve cooled down). The same distinction, I
believe, holds true when you get mad at someone else. You can express your
anger immediately in some hostile, aggressive manner or you can simply
walk (or stomp!) off without a word. Or you can choose a middle-of-the-road
response — walk off until you cool down and then return later to the source
of your anger and verbalize exactly why you feel the way you do.
Harburg found that people who tended more often to use the reflective anger
coping style had lower blood pressure than those whose primary way of deal-
ing with anger was resentful. He also noted that the tendency to utilize reflec-
tive anger coping was greater among women and middle-class respondents
(those who had more education, higher family incomes, and higher job
status). They appeared to be more immune from the unhealthy effects of
other people’s anger.
Try the following self-role-playing exercise:
1. Think of some recent situation where you felt you were treated
unfairly or unjustly but didn’t say how you felt at the time.
2. Write out the situation on a piece of paper in as much detail as possible.
3. Read what you’ve written down.
112
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 
Having a good cry is not the answer
A study of 177 female college undergraduates
found that crying was a symptom of suppressed
anger, which in turn was associated with a
higher risk for depression and anxiety. Younger
women tended to cry more often than older
women. Having a “good cry” may, in fact, not be
as good for your health as mental health pro-
fessionals once thought.

4. Write down how you felt about the situation — not what you thought
or what you did, but how you felt (your emotions).
It’s okay to list more than one emotion — for example, “I was angry and
hurt.”
5. Write down the cause of your feelings (“She made an unkind remark
about my weight”).
6. Write down what you want to say to the person with whom you were
angry.
Be sure to use feeling-cause language, starting with feeling and then the
cause (see “Stop Having Issues and Start Having Feelings” earlier in this
chapter). Avoid using inflammatory language (swear words).
7. Now, ask yourself how you feel — better, relieved?
8. Reinforce what you’ve done here with a positive self-statement —
“Good for me! Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy!”
Make this a weekly exercise until you get better at expressing your feelings
on a day-to-day basis.

Chapter 8: Saying What You Feel
Emotional maturity: You’re not born with it
You don’t start out life knowing how to manage
your emotions well. You have to discover how
to manage your emotions as you journey
through life — a journey toward emotional
maturity.
In a study of eighth-grade school students, I
found that only one-quarter of the boys and less
than a third of the girls chose the mature way of
dealing with anger from another student —
walk away and come back later to discuss the
problem. The vast majority of people that age,
who by anybody’s definition are immature, was
to fight back — that is, answer anger with
anger. Simply put, they don’t know any better!
What was even worse, however, was the fact
that reflective anger expression seemed to
decrease as children moved through their
middle school years — grades 6 through 8 —
and into high school. That’s right — they
appeared to be getting more emotionally imma-
ture as they got older, clearly moving in the
wrong direction. What we’re still trying to figure
out is how this affects the way these individu-
als will handle anger when they reach adult-
hood.
Remember: If you want to be seen by others as
a mature person, you have to handle your emo-
tions — including anger — in something other
than a childlike manner. Tantrums may be a
normal occurrence for 2-year-olds, but not for
those who have supposedly reached adulthood.

Confessing Your Anger
In This Chapter
 Finding a safe way to speak out
 Understanding how a journal differs from a diary
 Knowing whether you need to confess your anger
I
was teaching an anger seminar at a local college. One evening, I asked stu-
dents to begin class by quietly writing down how they were feeling. They
were told to focus specifically on negative feelings, but the feelings could be
about anything or anyone in their day-to-day lives — classes, grades, relation-
ships, family, finances. . . . Some students began writing immediately, while
others protested, “I don’t have any negative feelings. I’m good! I don’t have
anything to write about.” I encouraged them to proceed anyway.
After a few minutes, the students were writing furiously, filling up page after
page with emotion. At the end of 20 minutes, I told them to stop and asked
them how they felt. One young woman who was reluctant to do the exercise
in the first place spoke up and said, “I feel terrible — like I’m going to
explode! I don’t know where all these feelings came from — about my anger
at my mother and my roommate. I was fine and now I feel awful.” Other stu-
dents reported similar experiences. Some were tearful as they spoke. Many
felt relieved, as though they had unburdened themselves. Mostly they were
amazed at how powerful this simple exercise was in tapping into their hidden
emotional life.
In this chapter, I walk you through an exercise called emotional journaling. It’s
a technique that will allow you to confess — to yourself — what is in your
heart but not necessarily on your mind. Journaling puts you in touch with
emotions — like anger — that you have intentionally tucked away because
they make you feel uncomfortable and you don’t want to deal with them.
Problem is, these emotions build up over time and eventually come back to
haunt you. By not dealing with today’s irritations, you carry them forward
into tomorrow. You end up doing the very thing you’ve been trying so hard
not to do — you get mad.

Confession: It’s Good for What Ails You
Behavioral medicine (the science that connects mind and body) advises that
excessive inhibition of emotions, especially strong emotions like anger, is
unhealthy. That’s right — holding back on emotions can actually make you sick.
It makes sense if you think about it. Holding back on emotions is unnatural for
humans. As babies, we begin life by crying whenever we’re uncomfortable —
hungry, thirsty, lonely, or in pain. But then life gets a hold of us and teaches us
to do just the opposite — to keep our feelings to ourselves and, in effect, cry
inside. Our bodies want to let go, but our minds tell us to hold back.
So, we end up in a state of emotional paralysis, which plays itself out in a
variety of emotional and physical ailments. Some of those ailments include
 High blood pressure
 Insomnia
 Headaches
 Bruxism (grinding your teeth)
 TMJ (pain in the jaw joint)

Tell me what you’re not thinking
A patient of mine — I’ll call him Tom — suffered
from depression. One of Tom’s biggest problems
was that he was unable to sleep. He found him-
self night after night wide awake for hours in
bed or, worse yet, sitting and staring aimlessly
at the television set at 3:00 in the morning.
Repeatedly, I asked Tom, “What was going
through your mind while you were trying to get
to sleep?” His answer was always the same,
“Nothing — I wasn’t thinking about anything.”
Then one day I decided to put a different ques-
tion to him: “Tell me what you weren’t thinking
about as you were lying there awake.” Tom sat
there for a moment and then suddenly burst into
tears, confessing how sad he was about his
best friend’s untimely death several months ear-
lier, how much he missed his father who
recently died of cancer, how worried he was
about losing his job because of a major reorga-
nization within his company, his feeling of
emptiness now that his daughter had left for
college, and more.
Like any good therapist (or priest, rabbi, friend,
spouse, or teacher), I sat quietly and heard his
confession. That was the therapeutic break-
through! Tom’s homework assignment from that
session on was to spend 15 minutes each
evening before he went to bed writing out all his
negative feelings for that day. Tom quickly dis-
covered that the real therapy is not waiting to
make a weekly confession to a professional, but
rather confessing to himself — about his emo-
tional vulnerability. In no time at all, he was
sleeping like a baby and his depression slowly
began to lift.

 Back spasms
 Impaired immune function
 Depression
 Panic attacks
Will confessing your negative feelings on a regular basis result in a decrease in
your need for medical services or in how often you end up being absent from
work because of illness? Current science suggests that the answer is yes.
Who Can Benefit from Confessing
If you’re still somewhat unsure whether you really need this confession exer-
cise in order to control your anger in the days, months, and years ahead, the
following sections fill you in on the types of people who need to (and will
benefit from) keeping an anger journal. If you see yourself in any of these cat-
egories, you can benefit from the experience.
Men in general
There tend to be two distinct types of men:
 Those who all too readily express their emotions as they experience
them
 Those who deny their feelings and act cool
117
Chapter 9: Confessing Your Anger
10,000 Israelis can’t be wrong
A fascinating study of 10,000 Israeli male civil-
service employees looked at a total of 90 med-
ical, social, and psychological factors that might
explain the development of hypertension. Four
of the factors that made a real difference in a
person’s odds of having high blood pressure
were:
 Brooding over being hurt by a co-worker
 Brooding over being hurt by a supervisor
 Restraining from retaliating when being hurt
by a supervisor
 Keeping conflicts with one’s spouse to one-
self
Restraining and repressing emotions were
found to have the same effect on blood pres-
sure as cigarette smoking and obesity do.

The latter group far outnumbers the former, interestingly even when it involves
getting angry. For every man who loses his cool in public, there are nine more
who keep their feelings under control — to the point where they don’t even
realize that they’re angry. A colleague of mine who studies the effect of emo-
tions such as anger, depression, and anxiety on heart disease, made this very
point in titling one of his papers, “Men deny and women cry. . . .”
African-American men
Contrary to accounts in the mainstream media, African-American men are
much more likely to keep their anger bottled up inside than are African-
American women or white men and women. In one public-health survey of
over 1,000 residents of an urban Midwest city, African-American men were
almost twice as likely to deny feeling angry or keep such feelings to them-
selves than white men of comparable age.
Women who cry a lot
Women who engage in more emotional crying are more likely to suppress
angry feelings than those who don’t cry. Crying because you’re slicing onions
or have an allergy doesn’t count!
People who are prone to guilt
Guilt is a real barrier to emotional expression. For example, one study I was
involved in many years ago found that women who felt guilty about express-
ing anger toward their parents had higher blood pressure than women who
weren’t sorry about their outrageous behavior. Many women, I suspect, dis-
cover early in life that it’s easier to bottle up anger than it is to get rid of guilt.
People who are too empathetic
Normally empathy (being in sync with another person’s emotions) is a good
thing. But when you have too much empathy, it can cause you to be hide
your true emotions so that you don’t hurt someone else’s feelings.
118
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

People who are hostile
Hostility is an attitude that all too often leads to anger. The combination of
hostility and anger-suppression tendencies can be lethal when it comes to
things like blood pressure and all the health problems that go along with
that.
People who lack charisma
If you’re charismatic, you have that personal magnetism that allows you to
easily attract and influence others. You don’t need to keep an anger journal
because everyone already knows how you feel about things — good or bad.
Actually, that’s a big part of your appeal!
But for the less charismatic, emotions are not as easily expressed. Here are
some indicators of lacking charisma:
 A subdued laugh
 A neutral facial expression (you’ll make a better poker player!)
 A desire to remain unnoticed in a crowd
Introverts
An introvert is a private person, someone who tends to be shy and timid. His
emotions are not available for public scrutiny. He tends to be serious and
cautious about life, and he plays by the rules imposed by society — usually
without complaint. Introverts are the proverbial nice guys and gals who tend
to say things are fine when they’re really not. Introverts are self-contained
personalities, so emotional journaling should come easy to them.
People who have suffered a lot of trauma
The more that human beings suffer unusual, intense, traumatic experiences —
such as child abuse, rape, death of a child, loss of a spouse — the more likely
they are to spend a lot of energy defending themselves from future hurts. One
way to do this is to ignore your feelings about what goes on in your day-to-day
life, going about your business, smiling, and reassuring everyone that you are
“okay” no matter what. Journaling is a process by which you can heal from
within by both acknowledging and grieving over the damage the trauma
caused in your life.
119
Chapter 9: Confessing Your Anger

People who are chronically ill
People who live with chronic, progressive, and disabling illness — such as
multiple sclerosis, arthritis, fibromyalgia, diabetes, asthma — experience a
whole host of negative emotions in their never-ending struggle to remain
alive. Bottling up emotions like anger and sadness only serves to heighten
their struggle to maintain some quality of life.
Young people
As people grow older, they tend to be more open with their feelings. Maybe it’s
because at their age they believe they have less to lose by being honest about
how they feel about life. Or maybe somewhere along life’s way they achieved a
measure of wisdom about how to deal with emotions in a healthy way. Either
way, they have a distinct advantage over their younger counterparts.
Understanding the Difference between 
a Diary and a Journal
Keeping an anger journal is not the same as keeping a diary. Anger diaries
can be useful in monitoring anger throughout the day. They allow you to 
keep track of how many times you experience anger, how intense the feelings 
are each time, and how long your anger lasts — information that helps you

One breakdown is enough
Someone I know well had a nervous breakdown
at age 45. Basically, he appeared to be fine one
day and then suddenly, without warning,
became a deeply depressed man the next. It
took him five years of therapy and medication to
get back to normal. Once a week year after
year, he drove to a nearby city to make his con-
fession about all the difficulties in his life —
raised in an alcoholic, violent family; seriously
ill as a child; living in public housing during his
adolescent years; scores of personal rejections;
loss of loved ones; and on and on — to a psy-
chiatrist who listened without judgment to his
rage, despair, hopelessness, fear, and abiding
sadness.
It took a while, but he purged himself of all that
stuff, and he’s been unbelievably happy and
healthy for the past decade. Somewhere in 
the middle of all that therapy — after he got
some insight into the perils of storing up bad 
feelings — he vowed to himself that for the
remainder of his life he would laugh more, love
more, cry more, fuss more, and use words like
hurt, sad, and scared more when people asked
him how he was doing. So far, he’s kept his vow.

measure just how angry you are (see Chapter 2 for more). But that’s all an
anger diary does.
An anger journal does much more. Keeping an anger journal requires that you
actually put your feelings into words, not numbers, and that you describe the
context in which your feelings arose. An anger diary might typically read:
“Got angry at 11:30 a.m.; rated as a 5 on 10-point scale; lasted about 20 min-
utes.” An anger journal, on the other hand, might read: “I really got angry at
lunchtime when my friend, Amy, once again failed to show up. I can’t believe
she’s that irresponsible! I would never treat her that way. She obviously has
no respect for me whatsoever. I don’t understand why I let people treat me
that way.”
As you can see, anger journals are more revealing. They tell you something
about yourself more than just the fact that you got angry. In this example, the
writer can begin to appreciate the fact that her anger isn’t the result of her
irresponsible friend (the world is full of those!), but rather her willingness to
let other people treat her badly without standing up for herself. Her real con-
fession here is that: “I don’t respect myself enough to command respect from
others.”
Some people keep anger diaries to see if their anger experience is changing
over time — the diaries provide an opportunity to look back and answer the
question, “Am I becoming a less angry person?” Journals, on the other hand,
are only useful at the time you write them — you write, you read, you learn,
and then you discard them. With journaling, each day is a new day!
Telling Your Story Your Way
Making your confession, in this case about anger and other unpleasant emo-
tions, is about telling a story — your story. How you construct that story,
however, makes the difference between whether or not this exercise is a ther-
apeutic one. Just like there are rules for Catholics who make their confession
to their priest, there are rules about making this type of confession. In the fol-
lowing sections, I cover some of the more important rules that you should
abide by when working on your anger journal.
Make yourself the audience
In confessing the emotions that made up your day, you are both the speaker
and the audience. In effect, you’re entering into a private conversation that is
for your eyes only. You won’t share your confession with anyone and your
confession will end when you complete the exercise. So, there is no need to
construct a story to impress, educate, or make someone else feel better.
121
Chapter 9: Confessing Your Anger

I can’t emphasize this enough: Your anger journal is meant to be a dialogue
between you and yourself, not between you and someone else. In my office
practice, for example, when I ask patients to journal, I make it clear from the
outset that I won’t read what they write, nor do I want them to read their
journals to me after they finish. The exercise is for their benefit, not mine! All
I ask when they finish is that they tell me how they feel and to summarize
what, if anything, they discovered about themselves in that few minutes.
Use the first person
Writing in the first person (using I) may be the most difficult aspect of making
your confession. Most people are so accustomed to defining and understand-
ing their emotional experiences in terms of other people’s actions that they
feel things in the third person. To illustrate this, think about how you and
others you know talk about anger:
“My mother made me so angry.”
“My boss got me so pissed off!”
“If they didn’t push my buttons, I wouldn’t get so mad.”
If you think about your emotions like this and you write this way in your jour-
nal, everything you glean will be about those other people and not about
yourself. Writing in the first person makes you responsible for your emotions:
“I got so angry at my mother.”
“I got pissed off at my boss.”
“I get angry when they push my buttons.”
If you write in the third person about your emotions, you’ll feel more like a
victim — a victim of the other person’s behavior. And, victims end up feeling
more angry when they finish writing, not less. Feeling more upset is exactly
the opposite of what you want to accomplish with this exercise.
Don’t worry about grammar
You don’t have to be an English major to keep an anger journal. What is
important here is putting your true feelings into words that not only gives
you some immediate relief from the physical tension required to hold on to
unexpressed emotion, but also educates you about your own emotional self.
122
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

Grammar, spelling, and punctuation are completely irrelevant. (So you have a
few dangling participles or split infinities? Who cares!) My advice instead is to:
 Write spontaneously.
 Write carelessly.
 Write with abandonment.
 Write continuously.
 Write without a clear sense of purpose.
 Write with your heart, not your head.
 Write with passion, not perspective (perspective will come later).
 Write for no one but yourself.
 Write as if this is the last conversation you will ever have on earth.
 Write just for the hell of it!.
 Write first, read later.
Focus on the negative
There is no medicinal effect to confessing positive emotions. Storing up feel-
ings of joy and satisfaction will not make you sick, whereas storing up emo-
tions such as anger and sadness will. So, the focus of an anger journal must
be on anger and other negative feelings. What you’re trying to do here is to
purge those feelings that can poison your life as time goes by (more about
this in Chapter 3). Think of it this way: Holding on to positive feelings leads to
contentment; holding on to negative emotions ends up in resentment. The
aim of the anger journal is to avoid the latter.
You may confuse feelings with thoughts and actions such that, if asked about
how you feel, you’ll answer, “Well, I thought he was stupid!” or “I just got up
and left after I realized that she forgot about our lunch meeting.” Emotions
are simply statements about how happy, mad, sad, or glad you are, not why
you feel that way or what you’re going to do about those feelings.
You may not be fluent when it comes to emotional terminology. In fact, even if
you aced your SAT vocabulary words, your emotional vocabulary may be lim-
ited to a few general terms like upset, bothered, and nervous. Here is a list of
words people often use to describe the emotion of anger. If you are at a loss for
words to describe your feelings, you may want to choose some from this list.

Establish causal connections
In carrying out this exercise, try to identify the causes of your negative feel-
ings. In other words, as you write in your journal, you need to ask yourself
exactly why you felt angry, sad, or hurt. Although simply acknowledging
uncomfortable emotions through journal writing can purge these feelings
(and the tension that accompanies them) from your mind and body, that
alone will not provide the insight and understanding of why anger plays such
a prominent role in your emotional life. The insight — which is how you even-
tually gain greater control over your anger — comes from giving meaning to
these feelings.
Here are some excerpts from an anger journal kept by Carol, a 22-year-old
single mom, who was trying to understand why she stayed irritated so much
of the time:
“I got really annoyed because the kids wouldn’t stop running through the
house when I told them not to.”
“Why do I always have to get mad before anyone understands that I need
some help getting everything done around here?”
124

“I think I’ll go crazy if one more person tells me that there’s no reason for
me to get so upset — I’ve got plenty of reasons!”
“I realize I need help; I just don’t know where to turn.”
The boldface words help Carol engage in some much needed self-reflection,
which will eventually lead to self-correction. In this case, what Carol is con-
fessing to herself is that she can’t deal with life’s challenges without support.
If she gets the message and acts on it, her situation will become much less
stressful and she’ll have a lot less reason to constantly be on the verge of
becoming angry. If she doesn’t hear her own confession, however, her emo-
tional life will remain unchanged.
Write until time is up
Give yourself sufficient time to do the exercise in a meaningful way. I recom-
mend 15 to 20 minutes. Make it easy on yourself by setting a kitchen timer (or
some other type of timekeeping device) and writing until you hear the bell,
which is your cue to stop what you’re doing immediately. Stop writing even if
you’re in midsentence or haven’t completed your thought.
Grammar and sentence construction are not important. What is important is
that you write until time is up.
If you do run out of things to write about before the end of the allotted time
(not likely when you get started!), go back and read what you’ve already writ-
ten and find something that you can expand on. Trust me: With a little
prompting, you’ll quickly tap back into those emotions that are just waiting
for a chance to be expressed.
Don’t let emotions get in the way
Most likely you’ll feel relieved, content, and far less tense when you finish
with your anger journal for the day. That, after all, is the goal of the exercise.
But sometimes — typically when you first start journaling — you may also
experience negative emotions such as sadness, apprehension, and nervous-
ness. These feelings may be quite strong and can even be overwhelming at
the moment. Look back at the example I gave in the introduction to this chap-
ter about the reactions of my students — some were in tears, others felt like
they would explode. Keep in mind that these feelings are natural — after all,
you’re confronting uncomfortable emotions that you’ve kept hidden away
throughout the day — and they usually go away quickly.
If you become upset while you’re writing in your journal, don’t let the feelings
stop you from completing your work. You can write and cry at the same time,
right?
125
Chapter 9: Confessing Your Anger

If the negative feelings you encounter after journaling are too strong for you
to handle or if the feelings persist and interfere with your day-to-day life, con-
sider stopping the exercise and talk to a therapist. Counseling provides a
safe, structured, and supportive environment in which you can make your
confession. And if you need to talk to someone, it doesn’t mean that you’re
crazy — everyone needs some outside help from time to time.
Suspend judgment
Human beings are, by definition, judgmental creatures. You make literally
thousands of judgments each and every day of your life about one thing or
another: What should you wear today? What should you have for breakfast?
Which freeway should you to take to work? Where should you have lunch?
Which emotions should you express and which ones should you keep to
yourself?
Unfortunately, anger is one of those emotions that people tend to judge
harshly. You may think of anger as one of the “bad” feelings, and you may
assume that no one around you wants to hear about your anger. You proba-
bly think it’s all right to tell another person you feel wonderful, happy, or
blessed if they ask how you are, but I’m betting you won’t be as honest or
candid if the answer is instead “bitchy, pissed off, and mad as hell!”
You’re telling yourself that the world around you doesn’t really want hear the
bad news about your emotional life — they only want the good news. If there
is no good news, then the best course of action is to keep quiet or lie — “I’m
fine.” And, maybe you’re right. But judgments like this cause you to store up
negative feelings like irritation, sadness, and hopelessness — feelings that
need to be confessed later on.
Don’t be judgmental when writing in your journal. Be open, honest, and forth-
right. As the famed sportscaster Howard Cosell used to say, “I tell it like it is.”
Adopt the same motto for your anger journal.
As far as the rest of your world is concerned, you’re writing in your journal
with anonymity. What you write is for your eyes only. No one else is going to
see what you write, so they can’t judge it — and you shouldn’t either. This
may be harder for you to do than you think. You may be so used to critiquing
your emotions as — or before — you experience them in order to be politi-
cally correct that letting the feelings flow freely may be difficult at first. That’s
okay. In fact, that is also part of the goal — helping you become a less emo-
tionally constricted person.
126

Stick to pen and pencil
You’re probably asking yourself, “Can’t I make my confession on the com-
puter? That’s how I communicate with the rest of the world.” Well, of course,
you can. But I encourage you instead to stick to some old-fashioned technol-
ogy for this exercise — pen and pencil. The reasoning behind this is simply
that writing by hand is a much more intimate mode of expression. There’s
something much more personal about hand-written messages than those that
are typed or e-mailed. I remember getting a typed memo once from a friend
telling me off in a very angry way. I found the whole thing so funny that I
threw it away without ever fully appreciating what his grievance was. I would
have much preferred a penned (“Dear Doyle . . .”) note advising me that he
would think of me from that day forth as a “no good son-of-a-bitch!”
If writing is not your thing and you tend to be more fluent (and comfortable)
with the spoken word, then you may want to find a tape recorder and use
that. But don’t change anything else — talk for your ears only, speak in the
first person, continue the conversation for 15 to 20 minutes, suspend judg-
ment, and so forth.
127
Chapter 9: Confessing Your Anger
Keeping a safe distance
Not too long ago, I was invited to apply for a
major administrative position in a large univer-
sity. I was delighted. I sent all my materials
(which everyone agreed were impressive) and
was soon notified that they wanted me and my
wife to come for a visit. We gladly accepted and
ended up spending three enlightening but gru-
eling 16-hour days meeting with countless
people, touring the campus, finding out all about
the history of the school, and looking at real
estate. We left exhausted but optimistic that an
offer would be forthcoming.
When I didn’t hear anything from the university
after ten days (they had said a decision would
be made in five or six days), I e-mailed the head
of the search committee and asked how things
were proceeding. I was shocked by what came
next. He immediately replied via e-mail that I
would be receiving a letter in the next day or
two indicating that in the end I was judged as
“unacceptable” for the position in question. And
that was it!
When I tried to talk to him about what had hap-
pened (because everyone — including him —
had been so positive throughout my time there),
he made it clear — again via e-mail — that he
wasn’t at liberty to talk about it any further. I
subsequently found out what had transpired
behind the scenes and that I was just the latest
of many acceptable candidates who had been
turned away. I think I was more bothered —
angry, in fact — about how I was told about the
decision than the decision itself. They certainly
have a right to choose or not choose anyone
they like. But to do it that impersonally — wow!
All I can think is that they were trying to dis-
tance themselves from their own sense of
shame in the Machiavellian way they had com-
ported themselves.

Find a quite place
You need to find a quite place to write in your anger journal, a place where
you can be alone (and uninterrupted) with your thoughts and feelings.
Journaling is not a community activity. If you can’t allow yourself any per-
sonal time until everyone else’s needs are taken care of and all the chores are
done, then make writing in your journal the last thing you do — after every-
one else has been safely put to bed. Another good time (though sometimes a
bit tricky to engineer) is right after you come home from a day at work but
before you jump headfirst into the demands and challenges of the evening
(or as some put it — the second half of your workday). In fact, if you purge
the unwanted emotions of the day, you’ll most assuredly enjoy better rela-
tionships with your loved ones.
If you have the kind of job where you find yourself more and more fed up as
the day progresses, you may want to use your lunch break to journal. It may
make the rest of the workday go a little smoother and avoid any blowups
along the way.
You probably don’t want to do this over a cup of coffee at Starbucks (that’s
not a good place to access strong emotions and start crying). If there’s a
place of worship (like a church or synagogue) nearby (ah, sanctuary!), that
would be perfect. Even a quiet corner in a library, or a park bench would do
the trick.

Chapter 10
Becoming a Type B
In This Chapter
 Listing your Type B tendencies
 Becoming someone unique
 Doing what doesn’t come naturally
 Finding the right environment for you
O
dds are, you’ve come across Type A people in your everyday life:
 The friend who never lets you finish a sentence, always hurrying you
along with “yeah, right”
 The boss who gets increasingly impatient when it looks like a deadline is
not going to be met
 The person who finishes eating long before everyone else
 The neighbor who works all the time, never spending time with his
family, but who also makes a lot more money than you do
 The colleague whose eyes are constantly scanning the room while
you’re trying to talk to him
 The guy who can’t join any organization without promptly running for an
elective office
 The co-worker who prefers to work alone because she feels like she can
get the job done quicker and more efficiently if she’s not part of a team
 People who always appear a bit too serious about life, who have an
“edge” about them, and who seem to be moving against everyone and
everything that comes their way
These are Type A personalities, and their pattern of behavior implies both an
aggressive approach to life and a heightened potential for anger. If you
express Type A behavior, you probably won’t win very many friends and
admirers. The problem is, if you don’t express your Type A behavior, the
stress can shorten your life.

If you’re a Type A, you may be thinking that you’re in a lose-lose situation.
But fear not: In this chapter, I offer you a way to move beyond being a Type A.
Your goal is to become a Type B — a personality type in which anger is much
less likely to occur in the first place. And I assure you, you really can change —
you just need the tools that this chapter provides.
Moving Beyond Type A
I know, you’re probably thinking, “Change my Type A ways? That can’t be
easy. I’ve been this way most of my life!” My response to that is: It may be
easier than you imagine — and it absolutely is possible to change. The only
question that matters is: Are you willing to work a little at this, in order to
experience peace of mind and a big change of heart? If so, read on!
Focusing on who you are rather 
than what you do
Type A behavior is in large part an adaptation to a culture that seems more
concerned about performance (what you do) than anything else that might
define you as a unique human being.
Typically, what’s the first question a stranger asks you when you meet at a
party? “So what do you do?” People ask questions like this as a way of mea-
suring a person’s social and economic status compared to their own (he’s
more powerful; I’m wealthier; and so on). Another reason people ask this
type of question is because the answer allows them to more quickly judge the
other person without really getting to know them. It’s sort of like the SAT
score which, unfortunately, decides who gets into which college and who ulti-
mately receives a scholarship.
The “So, what do you do?” question allows for quick judgments, but it’s not
exactly an accurate way of finding out who someone is. Think of this question
as being similar to a high-school senior’s SAT score: It’s a lousy predictor of
how well a student will perform, yet colleges weed out applicants based on
that number. It’s the same here: Telling someone that you’re a neurosurgeon
only tells him that you’re well educated and make a lot of money. It doesn’t
necessarily follow, though, that you’re a decent human being, that you’re gen-
erous, that you’re kind, that you’re a good mother, that you’re a loving wife,
that you’re a faithful daughter, that you’re a good neighbor, that you’re curi-
ous or have a good sense of humor. In fact, you may be none of these even
though you’re a talented surgeon.
130
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

You can tell a lot about whether people are Type A or Type B by the kinds of
conversations they have. Here’s my recollection of what transpired between
myself (after I changed my own Type A ways and became a Type B) and a
former colleague when we crossed paths at a medical convention.
Me: It’s good to see you. It’s been a while. How have you been?
Colleague: Fine. I’m busy as ever — work, work, work. What have you
been up to?
Me: Well, you know I’m in private practice now and I’m enjoying that.
Catherine and the kids are all well. Everybody’s healthy. We like where we
live — peaceful, great scenery. We’re all pretty happy.
Colleague: Great. Did I tell you that I got a big five-year research grant?
It’s a really big deal!
Me: No, I didn’t know that. Congratulations! And how is your family?
Colleague: They’re fine. Yeah, this grant means I can pretty much call the
shots at work now. We’re going to be cranking out papers like you wouldn’t
believe.
Me: I’m glad for you. But, how are you — your health good? Enjoying life,
that sort of thing?
Colleague: Couldn’t be better. Just a lot going on, lots to get done. Oh,
and did I tell you that I have a book coming out?
Me: Wow. That’s great — let me know when it’s published and I’ll get a
copy. Be sure and give my regards to Nancy, will you?
Colleague: Absolutely. Well, I need to press on. Sorry I can’t stay and
catch up some more, but I’ve got a whole bunch of meetings to go to
today, make a presentation, that kind of thing. Rush, rush, rush! Good
seeing you, though.
Does this sound familiar? The irony here is that Type A people are terribly
self-absorbed — preoccupied with what they’re doing, what they have, what
they need to do right now — so they dominate the conversation with self-
referencing statements such as “I’m busy as ever,” “I got a five-year research
grant,” “I can pretty much call the shots,” “I have a book coming out,” and “I
need to press on” without actually telling us much about themselves at all.
If you want to move beyond Type A, you can start by sharing with the world
more about who you are than what you do. In the following sections, I cover
three simple exercises you can do to work toward that goal.
131
Chapter 10: Becoming a Type B

Reframe the question
The next time someone starts a conversation with you by asking, “So, what
exactly is it that you do?”, answer by asking the following question in
response: “Are you asking me what I get paid to do or what I’m doing with my
life?”
Don’t be surprised if this strategy results in a bit of an awkward moment for
the other person. If she responds, “By all means, tell me what you’re doing
with your life!,” then great — you’re off to an engaging Type B conversation. If
she comes back with, “I guess I was asking what you get paid to do — your
work,” tell her what you do for a living, and then do one of the following:
 Say, “Now that you know what I do for a living, would you like to know
more?” In effect, you’re giving the person a second chance.
 Exit from the conversation as quickly and gracefully as you can and look
elsewhere for some pleasant Type B company.
Take the tombstone test
No matter how old you are, you can start thinking right now how you want
your tombstone to read. Take a look at all the epitaphs in Table 10-1 and, as
honestly as possible, choose the one that you think the people in your life
say is accurate about you.

After you’ve chosen your epitaph, ask yourself if that’s how you want to be
remembered. If the epitaph that others think is most accurate for you hap-
pens to be in the Type A column, maybe it’s time for a change. For example, if
the epitaph that most accurately describes you is, “Here lies a person who
made a fortune,” you can begin to enrich your life with new friendships —
preferably ones that have no relationship to what you do for a living. If your
Type A epitaph is, “Here lies a person who was feared, but respected,” you
can sign up for a course at the community college, dealing with a subject you
know absolutely nothing about and then people can respect you for what you
know that they don’t, rather than respect you simply because they’re afraid
of you.
Write a life essay
Take out a sheet of paper and write the word I on the first line. Then spend 15
minutes writing an essay about your life up to now; include anything and
everything you think is relevant and important. Stop at the end of 15 minutes
(set a timer, if necessary) and read what you wrote. Try to be as objective as
you can — pretend you’re reading about someone else’s life.
After you’ve finished reading what you just wrote, answer the following 
questions:
 How much of your life essay is about you versus other people?
 How much of your essay has to do with your work?
 How much of your essay has to do with financial successes or failures?
 Does it sound like a life story in which the person is satisfied and 
content?
 Would you say that this essay is about someone who has a sense of pur-
pose or meaning in life?
 How much of the essay is about what you have gotten from life versus
how much you’ve given back?
 If this were, in fact, another person’s life story, would you want to trade
places with that person?
If your essay has a healthy balance between references to yourself versus ref-
erences to others; if work and financial success (or failure) are not the sole
focus; if your essay portrays a reasonably content person, whose life is full of
purpose; if there is balance between getting and giving; and if you would actu-
ally want to live that person’s life, you can be fairly sure that you’re a Type B!
If you answered otherwise, take a long, hard look at yourself and think of
ways that you can change your story. Repeat this exercise once a week for
the next six weeks, each time asking yourself those same questions after-
ward, and see if you’re beginning to move beyond Type A. If you work at
changing the focus of your life, the focus of your essay should change as well.
133
Chapter 10: Becoming a Type B

Looking at your own competitive streak
Competition is at the heart of the Type A personality. It’s not just that Type A
folks are competitive — it’s that their need (some would say obsession) to
compete is insatiable. Type A’s compete over everything — there’s absolutely
nothing that won’t get their competitive juices flowing. And when they’re in
that competitive mode, they take no prisoners.
I remember listening some years ago to a Type A training tape, used by
former colleagues of mine at Duke University Medical Center. The man being
interviewed was asked, “Would you let your child win a game you were play-
ing just to make him feel good or boost his ego?” His immediate reply was,
“Hell no. If he wants to win, he has to beat me. That’s what life is all about.”
Now, that’s a Type A! Better to crush the kid’s spirit than to lose the game.
Type B’s compete, too — they’re just are more selective about it. They don’t
compete unfairly. And they often compete with different goals in mind.
The following is a list of ways in which you can modify your competitive
nature and engage in healthy competition:
 Try playing a round of golf without keeping score. Here’s something
you may not know: Type A golfers not only keep their own score, they
keep the other players’ scores as well — so the other players don’t
cheat. And if the other players make a mistake, you can bet the Type A
will tell them about it.
 Let your children win at family games at least half the time. Let them
win even more often if you want them to love you 40 years from now.
 If you feel like you have to compete with your spouse over ideas and
decisions, be sure to let your spouse win half the time. If you do, you’ll
stay together longer!
 Never ask co-workers how much they get paid, how well their stocks
are doing, or how much “face time” they have with the boss. Just do
your job, make your own investments, and you’ll be fine.
 If you’re going somewhere, don’t try to see how fast you can get
there. Go the speed limit and enjoy the ride. Remember: Life is not
meant to be a race.
 Practice meditation. If you’ve never meditated, or you don’t really know
where to start, pick up Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stephan
Bodian (Wiley). It comes with a CD of guided meditations that you can
use to get started.
 Walk on a track with someone who walks slower than you do and go
at that person’s speed. Walking — without competing against your 
partner — does wonders for your heart.
134
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

 Alternate between competitive activities and noncompetitive activi-
ties. For example, one Saturday afternoon, play tennis with your friend
(and allow yourself to keep score), and the next Saturday, visit a
museum.
 The next time you have sex with your partner, instead of trying to see
how quickly you can reach that moment of climax, see how long you
can stay in that moment of intimacy (closeness). And don’t ask your
partner, “How was it?” That question translates to, “How was I? How did
I perform?” Intimacy shouldn’t be about keeping score.
 The next time a group you belong to holds an election, raise your
hand and nominate someone else. You don’t have to be the head of
every committee — you can trust other people to take charge and follow
their lead for a change.
Come up with other creative ways you can reduce your competitive nature. If
you’re less competitive, you won’t be as likely to get angry, and that’s defi-
nitely a good thing.
Conversing without numbers
Type A’s love to quantify life as a way of measuring how successful they are
in their incessant competition with everything and everyone in the universe.
They’re quick to tell you how much money they make a year (and they’ll try
to find out how much you’re making), how much they made or lost in buying
and selling various properties (homes, stocks, land, cars — you name it),
how well they’re doing at sports (what number they are on the tennis ladder
at the local country club or what their golf handicap is), how many surgeries
they performed last year, how many publications they have, the size and rev-
enue figures for the companies they work for, and so on.
It’s all number-speak and the crazy thing is that Type A’s don’t even hear
themselves doing it. Here’s a typical example:
Max: Glad we could get together for lunch — it’s been a while.
Type A: I know. I’ve just been so darned busy. You know we just added a
new thousand-square-foot addition to our office building. And we also
added six new salesmen. How’s your business doing?
Max: Okay, we’re holding our own — nothing special. The good news is
that lately I have more time to relax and catch up on stuff.
Type A: Boy, I could use some of that, but not likely. We’re 43 percent
ahead of where we were last year at this time. I think there’s a good
chance we may exceed 50 percent before year’s end.
135
Chapter 10: Becoming a Type B

Max: So, other than work, what have you been up to? The family and I are
spending a lot of time lately up at the lake — you know we have a little
place up there. The kids love it.
Type A: Boy, I’d love to be at the lake more. I told you I bought a new
boat last year — paid $60,000 for that sucker and we hardly ever use it.
And we almost never use the place we have up there — five bedrooms,
four baths, two acres of waterfront property just going to waste. I told my
wife we ought to sell it and make a nice profit — with the way the demand
is these days, I bet I could get at least $350,000 easy. What do you think
your place is worth?
To begin conversing without numbers, try the following seven-step exercise:
1. Get a tape recorder.
2. Tape a ten-minute casual conversation about some topic of mutual
interest with a family member or close friend.
3. Go back and listen to the tape and count how many times you refer to
numbers.
4. Tape a second ten-minute conversation with this same person, only
this time make a conscious effort not to engage in number-speak.
5. Do a recount of how many times you referred to numbers the second
time around.
6. Assess whether you improved by comparing the two.
7. Repeat this exercise as often as necessary to build a new habit of Type
B speech.
When you begin to see a change in how you talk in this “experimental” set-
ting, start paying more attention to how you converse with others in every-
day life. Pay attention to how they speak, too — you’ll quickly find out that
you’re not the only Type A in the world. Again, make an effort to get your
message across without all the numbers. It’s fine to simply say, “I’m having a
fantastic day!” You don’t need to add, “I’ve already made $2,300 and it’s only
lunchtime.”
Taking off your watch
Type A’s are obsessed with time as well. “This is taking too much time,”
“Damn it, it’s getting late — I’ll never get finished on time,” “I wish they would
hurry up.”
136
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

Type A’s have an accelerated sense of time. They feel time “slipping away”
more and more as the day goes by. This leads to an increased feeling of time
anxiety or what the originators of the Type A concept (Dr. Meyer Friedman
and Dr. Ray Rosenman) called hurry sickness. And, that explains why Type A’s
get so irritated when circumstances and people slow them down.
The irony, of course, is that this perception that time is passing all too
quickly is false. Time passes at the same rate for Type A’s as it does for Type
B’s. The difference is that Type B’s are more in sync with time — they have a
more accurate perception of how much time has elapsed from one moment
to the next.
To test how aware you are of time, have someone you know pick a time any-
where from 5 to 15 minutes — but tell him not to tell you how many minutes
he picked. Then ask the person to engage you in a conversation for that
length of time. (Oh, by the way, you can’t have a watch on while you’re taking
this test — that’s cheating!). When that set amount of time has passed, try
telling that person how many minutes you think elapsed. If you’re Type A,
you’ll most likely overestimate the actual time. If you’re Type B, you’re more
likely to either be right on the mark or underestimate how much time has
gone by.
One of the best ways to become a Type B is to quit wearing a watch. If you’re
a Type A, I’m sure your first thought as you read that was, “My God, I can’t do
that — how would I know what time it is, how would I stay on my hectic
schedule, how would I get all this stuff done?” The answer is that you wouldn’t —
but, guess what? The world wouldn’t end. On the other hand, the quality of
your work might improve; in fact, people are much more creative in their
thinking and problem solving when they aren’t bound by deadlines.
For a Type A, taking off a watch is like asking a lifetime smoker to hand over
his pack of cigarettes or an alcoholic to get rid of all the liquor in her house.
It’s asking a lot. You may be able to go cold turkey, put your watch away, and
never look back. (I did that one morning on a plane 35 years ago and I haven’t
worn a watch since. That was actually the first step in my Type A recovery
program.) If you’re like most people, however, you’ll have to wean yourself off
your watch slowly.
Here are some helpful hints on how to wean yourself from your watch:
 Think about which part of the day or week would be easier for you to
not wear a watch. Then see if you can take it off for an hour or two
during those times.
 When you’re in your office during the day, put your watch in your
pocket or purse and rely on a desk clock to keep track of time. Only
put on your watch when you leave the office.
137
Chapter 10: Becoming a Type B

 Wear an old-fashioned pocket watch. You still have a way of keeping
time but it’s not as obvious, staring you in the face all the time.
 Set a timer on your watch to let you know when it’s time to move on.
For example, when you’re having lunch with a friend, set the time for
when you need to wrap up the lunch. Then put the watch out of sight.
 See how many new, interesting, nice-looking people you can meet
throughout the course of a day by asking for the time. It’s a great way
to start a conversation!
Resisting what society tells you to do
The A in Type A might as well stand for American. The values that underlie all
the major components of Type A behavior — competitiveness, a sense of
time urgency, overinvolvement with work — typify the extreme of what
America, and other similar Western industrialized countries, is all about.
(Interestingly, people in Belgium and the Netherlands as a rule are Type B,
and those countries have half the number of deaths due to heart disease as
does the United States.)
To become more Type B in how you approach life, you need to counteract
the cultural principles and beliefs that promote and maintain Type A behav-
ior. The following illustrates differences in beliefs that guide and motivate
Type A’s and Type B’s. If you’re a Type A, try adopting some of these Type B
philosophies.
Type A: I must perform to a higher standard than other individuals.
Type B: I should adopt a universal standard for what it reasonably efficient
performance in all aspects of daily life and be satisfied when I reach it.
Type A: Success is achieved only through effort — the more intense the
effort, the greater the success.
Type B: Success has mostly to do with my ability — people with greater
ability will always do better despite their efforts.
Type A: Life is mostly about competing with others for success.
Type B: Cooperation, not competition, is the strategy that will, in the long
term, ensure my success in life.
Type A: Each individual in society bears the burden of her own success —
now and in the future.
Type B: Social cohesion — being connected to and working with others —
lessens the burden each individual carries as they collectively strive
toward group success and survival. Life should be about what we do, and
not just about what I do!

Acquiring Wisdom
My lifelong friend and mentor, Dr. Berton Kaplan at the University of North
Carolina School of Public Health, argues that Type B personalities live longer
and have greater satisfaction (as well as less anger) simply because they’re
wiser when it comes to navigating their way through life’s twists and turns.
He also offers three simple, but effective, prescriptions for acquiring this
wisdom. I fill you in on these strategies in the following sections.
Seeking diversity in relationships
Wisdom is something you acquire from your own life experience, but also
from those around you. For example, I became a wise parent long before I had
children, having found out from my own two parents how not to raise kids.
My children benefited greatly from the mistakes my parents made on me —
and there were many!
Wisdom can just as well be acquired from people younger than you. My son
taught me how to enjoy my weekends instead of spending the entire time
checking things off my Type A list of chores.
In order to acquire wisdom, you should seek new relationships with people
different from yourself (the last thing you need is another Type A friend!),
because with each new relationship comes a new perspective about what is
really important in life, how to cope with adversity, and how to balance the
good with the bad (more about this in Chapter 16).
139
Chapter 10: Becoming a Type B
In a big hurry
One of the more interesting studies I was
involved in was in collaboration with Dutch col-
leagues at the University of Nijmegen. We were
looking at differences in how Type A and Type
B patients behaved while they were hospital-
ized for heart problems. We found that Type A
patients had a much shorter hospital stay than
Type B’s. Why? Because they were in a hurry to
get back out in the world and resume the very
lifestyle that had caused their heart problems in
the first place. As our most typically Type A
patient put it: “I have to make something of my
life in the future. Time is short. The first 30 years
of my life have been for nothing! I have to enjoy
it! I’m in a big hurry to do this.”

Cultivating the arts
I would venture to say that, at the very least, Type A’s are bored with artistic
endeavors — music, painting, sculpture, novels — and at worst they hate
such things. I say this because cultivating the arts is antithetical to the Type
A mentality. Art appreciation, whether sitting through a musical concert or
strolling through an art museum, invokes — no, demands — quiet, an appreci-
ation of past (not future) efforts, a historical perspective on life (not just
what’s going on today), and a stillness of spirit that you can’t find in the
merry-go-round of everyday life. Art challenges you to give your mind a much
needed respite from external pursuits, to reflect on matters that go beyond
the material world, to focus on the beauty of things rather than their utility. It
allows you to transcend mind and body into the subjective world of the
artist. What a wonderful “waste” of time!
Letting curiosity rein
Type A’s lack curiosity. If you’re curious, you tend to be curious about things
that will allow you to be more productive at your job and more dominant in
your social relationships. Healthy curiosity — the kind found in Type B’s —
knows no bounds. Type B’s are curious about life in general. They tend to
gravitate toward a wide variety of new experiences that catch their attention.
Some of their curiosity is satisfied through reading or talking with someone;
in other instances, it comes from hands-on involvement.
To enlarge your sense of curiosity, you might try one or more of the following:
 Once a month, go to your local bookstore and buy a book on some topic
you know absolutely nothing about.
 Check the newspaper each weekend for interesting “happenings” in your
community and then go and find out what they’re all about.
 Join a book club that covers a diversity of topics and has a discussion
component.
 Spend some time now and then with friends who have unique hobbies
and skills. Ask them to educate you about how to do these things.
 Watch educational television. Careful: You might actually learn some-
thing!

Finding the Right Environmental Fit
The next best thing to actually becoming a Type B is to move yourself into a
Type B environment. It turns out that workplaces and companies have dis-
tinct personalities just like people do. Type A’s, as you might expect, tend
most often to seek out places to work that are hard driving, time pressured,
frenetic, competitive, and full of deadlines. But what if you found yourself in a
Type B work situation — one that was more relaxed and easygoing? That
wouldn’t suit you, or would it? Well, if you found yourself in a Type B environ-
ment, you could expect to:
 Experience fewer health complaints (for example, headaches, indiges-
tion, backache, depression)
 Feel much less stressed while at work
 Be more satisfied with your work and that of your co-workers
 Have fewer days when you felt you couldn’t work up to par because you
weren’t feeling well
If you’re willing to work toward becoming a Type B and you seek out a Type B
work situation, you can anticipate further health benefits:
 Fewer stress-related mental health problems
 Feeling less like you’re in “high gear” throughout the workday
 Having less difficulty relaxing outside of work
 Feeling less often that your health in some way affects how much work
you get done
You may be living in a Type A city and, if so, you might consider moving —
yes, I’m serious. Cities differ in terms of their pace of life (for example, how
fast people talk, how fast they walk, how many people wear watches, how
fast business gets transacted) and these differences translate into how likely
you are to die from heart disease. It’s not the size of the city you live in that
determines the pace of your lifestyle, but rather which region of the country
the city is in. The northeast United States (with cities like New York City;
Providence, Rhode Island; and Patterson, New Jersey) is the worst for Type A
living, while the south (Atlanta, Memphis, Knoxville) and west (San Diego,
Salt Lake City, and Fresno) has the most Type B cities.
What does all this have to do with managing anger? Well, it turns out that
fast-paced living provides far more opportunities to lose your cool than the
slow-paced lifestyle. Think of it as the geographic cure!

Using Anger Constructively
In This Chapter
 Understanding the adaptive nature of anger
 Distinguishing between positive and negative anger
 Solving problems rather than seeking revenge
 Remembering that empathy is a two-way street
A
nger has gotten a bad rap! Typically, you associate anger with aggres-
sive behavior or some other type of destructive outcome in your life.
This is true only because no one has shown you how to use anger construc-
tively. In this chapter, I illustrate the positive side of anger — the side that can
be harnessed to resolve problems of everyday life, understand the other
person’s point of view, and minimize future conflict.
Emotions are not inherently good or bad. People have suffered heart attacks
because of a joyful event, like being promoted, and they’ve suffered strokes
when surprised by the unexpected news of a loved one’s death. Does this
mean that you should avoid joy and surprise at all costs? Of course not. And
you shouldn’t try to avoid anger because of some mistaken belief that it can
only cause hurt and harm. It’s what you do with anger — how you express it —
that makes it good or bad.
Making Anger Your Ally
If you choose to use anger constructively, you’ll join the ranks of some pretty
notable folks — George Washington, Martin Luther King, Jr., Jesus Christ,
Gandhi, and Mother Teresa, to name a few. These are just a few people who
admittedly were angry — about poverty, racial injustice, occupation of their
countries by foreign powers — but who channeled their anger into construc-
tive action that changed the world for the better.

Honors schmonors: We all get angry
I asked 20 honors students I was teaching at a well-known college to write down what they did
when they got angry. The following table summarizes their answers:
Positive Expressions
Negative Expressions
Talk about it with a friend
Withdraw from everyone
Go exercise
Get sick to my stomach
Go for a walk and think
Get a migraine headache
Feel depressed
Play the anger over and over in my head
Say things I don’t mean
Be self-critical
Cry
Snap at people
Grind my teeth
Not speak to anyone
Ignore the person I’m angry with
Storm off
Explode
Throw things
Scream
Stomp my feet
Lay awake all night
Complain, complain, complain
Feel guilty
Get into fights
Feel nauseated
Two other personal favorites of mine were “Find a brick wall and kick it ’til I can’t feel my feet” and
“Bite someone.” The ratio of negative-to-positive expressions of anger in this group of academi-
cally outstanding kids was a whopping 13-to-1. No wonder we think of anger as a bad thing!

In the following sections, I cover a few reasons why you should consider
making anger your ally in constructing a new healthier, happier, and more
productive life.
Anger is a built-in resource
We’re born with a capacity for anger. Mothers recognize anger in newborns
as early as 3 months of age. Anger isn’t something that has to be learned or
earned, like money or friendship. It’s yours to experience as the need arises.
Think of it as your birthright.
Ask yourself: Do I want to use this inner resource to reconstruct my life?
Anger is invigorating
The e in emotion stands for “energy.” Anger produces an instantaneous surge
of adrenaline, which causes your pupils to dilate, your heart to race, your
blood pressure to elevate, and your breathing to accelerate. If you’re really
angry, even the hairs on the back of your neck stand up! Your liver responds
by releasing sugar, and blood shifts from your internal organs to your skeletal
muscles, causing a generalized state of tension. You’re energized and ready
for action. Remember, though, that emotions are short lived — they come
and go. So, it’s imperative that you strike while the iron is (literally) hot and
use the angry energy to your benefit before it evaporates.
Ask yourself: Do I want to quit wasting energy on unproductive anger?
145
Chapter 11: Using Anger Constructively
I know I’m alive when . . .
Some years ago, I was conducting a workshop
on anger management for mental health pro-
fessionals. I started off by asking the audience
to define anger. Some folks offered the usual,
easy definitions: “It’s an emotion,” “It’s a feel-
ing,” “It’s something that feels bad.”
But, then, one young woman came up with the
most intriguing definition of all: “Anger is one
way I know I’m alive.” She went on to say how
refreshing emotions are because they disrupt
the otherwise humdrum nature of daily life and
for brief periods leave us feeling energized, full
of vitality, alive.

Anger serves as a catalyst 
for new behavior
The motion part of emotion has to do with motivating behavior. If you’re like
me, there are things you want to change in your life. But you’re afraid, right?
You’re uncertain about what will happen if you let go of the status quo and
move your life in some new direction — maybe a new relationship, a new
career, a new city, or a new, healthier lifestyle (joining a gym, starting a diet,
giving up alcohol). So, you do nothing — that is, until you get mad enough
about the way things are that you spring into action.
Ask yourself: How can I renew my life through constructive anger?
Anger communicates
Anger tells the world just how miserable you are — how unhappy, unfulfilled,
unsatisfied, unexcited, and unloved you feel. Anger speaks the unspeakable!
Think about the last time you verbally expressed anger. Do you remember
what you said? Was it something like, “Get off my back,” “You don’t care
about me,” “I’m tired of living hand to mouth,” or “I give, give, give, and I get
nothing in return.” I’m sure others heard what you said, but did you? Did you
listen to your anger — listen to what it’s telling you about what’s wrong with
your life and what you need to do to begin correcting it.

No you’re not . . . or are you?
Sometimes you just need a kick in the pants.
Charlie was having lunch with a friend and was
telling her about the new, exciting venture he
was planning to begin shortly to turn around his
failing business. “I’m going to start the new
business in about two months and I’m counting
on you sending me some clients,” he said. Her
reply, without a moment’s hesitation, “No,
you’re not.”
Wow! Charlie was stunned and irritated. “Why
do you say that?” he asked. “Because you’ve
been talking about this new business for over a
year now, and every time we have lunch it’s
always going to start sometime in the next few
months — but it never does. I think it’s a won-
derful idea and, sure, I’d send you clients, but
honestly, Charlie, you’re never going to do it. It’s
just talk.”
Now Charlie was mad. He paid the check, mum-
bled some pleasantry, and went back to work.
But the more he thought about it, the more he
realized his friend was right. A year of talk had
not translated into action. Charlie decided right
then and there — while he was still angry —
that he would begin his new business within the
next 30 days, and he did. The rest, as they say,
is history. His new venture got off to a rousing
start, and over the next ten years he made
almost a million dollars working part time — all
thanks to his good friend who made him angry
that day.

The most helpful emotional dialogue you have is the one you have with 
yourself.
Ask yourself: What is my anger telling me about me?
Anger protects you from harm
Anger is a vital part of that built-in “fight-or-flight” response that helps you
adapt to and survive life’s challenges. Anger is the fight component — the
part that moves you to take offensive measures to defend yourself against
actual or perceived threats.
Do you ever get angry enough to stand up for your rights? Do you ever use
anger to set limits on other people’s rude or inconsiderate behavior? Do you
ever get angry and say to someone, “Hey, that’s uncalled for!”, “Just stop
right there — I’m not going to sit here and subject myself any longer to this
abuse,” or “You may bully other people in this office, but you’re not going to
bully me.” I hope so, because, otherwise, you may be well on your way to
becoming a victim!
Ask yourself: How can I use my anger to defend myself in a positive way?
Anger is an antidote to impotence
Impotence — lacking in power and ability — feels lousy. And I’m not just talk-
ing about sexual impotence. I mean being impotent in how you deal with the
world around you — your relationships, your job, your finances, your health,
your weight, the loss of loved ones, and so on. You feel weak and inadequate,
not up to the task at hand.
Then you get angry — and suddenly you’re infused with a sense of empower-
ment, a feeling of strength, confidence, and competence. You’re standing
straight up to the frustrations and conflicts you’ve been avoiding. Anger is a
can-do emotion: “I can fix this problem,” “I can make a difference here,” “I can
be successful if I try.”
Pay attention to your posture the next time you feel down, dejected, and
impotent about some important thing in your life. Then notice how your pos-
ture changes when you get fired up and begin to take charge of the situation. I
promise you’ll be amazed at the difference.
Ask yourself: How often do I succumb to impotent anger?
147
Chapter 11: Using Anger Constructively

Exploring the Motives behind Your Anger
Before you can use anger constructively, you have to examine the motives
behind it. Ask yourself these questions:
 When I get angry, exactly what is it that I want to achieve?
 What is the desired outcome?
 What do I want to happen?
 What am I after?
 What would satisfy me?
Researchers who study anger suggest there are just three motives behind
anger, and I cover each of these motives in the following sections.
148
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 
The secretary’s got it right
I once knew a man who loved to bully his
employees. He had a daily ritual of calling some-
one into his office without warning, usually right
as most people were leaving for the day — I
suspect so there were fewer witnesses. He
would tell his “victim” to have a seat and then
immediately proceed to get red in the face with
rage, come charging across the office, with his
imposing figure standing over his helpless prey,
at which point he would harangue about all
sorts of things he was displeased with for what
seemed like an eternity. Everyone dreaded the
day when their name would be called.
Then one day, while several employees were
preparing to leave, one of the secretaries was
summoned to his office. Everyone felt bad for
her, anticipating what was to come. But, before
even five minutes had passed, she returned
looking unperturbed. “What happened?” they
asked, “Why are you back so soon?”
“Well, it was just like everybody said it would
be. As soon as I sat down, he came charging
across the room and started yelling at me. So, I
stood up and started walking out the door, at
which point he said, ‘Where do you think you’re
going?’ I simply told him that no one had ever
spoken to me like that in my entire life and I
didn’t know how to respond, so I thought it best
to leave until he calmed down. And, here I am.”
Two days later, another person in that same
office was called in and found himself being
confronted by the bully. As soon as he started
hollering, “I got mad but then immediately
thought about the secretary,” the man said. “So,
I got up and started to walk out. He asked me
where I thought I was going and I gave him the
same answer the secretary had. He stopped his
ranting and calmly asked me to sit back down
because he needed to talk with me about some-
thing important. I said, ‘Okay, as long as you
don’t start hollering again.’” The two had a civil
discussion after that.

Dr. James Averill at the University of Massachusetts has found that the most
frequently cited type of anger is constructive anger (63 percent of those sur-
veyed), followed by vengeful anger (57 percent), and finally anger that is
aimed simply at letting off steam (37 percent).
Seeking vengeance
Is anger your way of avenging a wrong that has been done to you? Is the goal
to hurt someone or destroy something — to hurt their feelings, to physically
attack them, or to break something when you’re frustrated? Is your anger
designed to intentionally inflict suffering and do you experience pleasure in
the harm you do to others? If the answer is yes, your anger is, by its very
nature, destructive, not constructive — this kind of anger is called vengeful
anger.
Here’s a real-life example of what I’m talking about: Matt had just about fin-
ished putting in the new kitchen cabinets. He was putting up the molding
around the cabinet tops when he realized he had cut a piece too short. He
flew into a rage and proceeded — much to his wife’s horror — to take a crow-
bar and rip out all the cabinets and throw them one by one into the backyard
until his anger was satisfied. He destroyed months of hard work in a matter of
a few seconds. After he cooled down, he headed off to the local hardware
store to buy materials to rebuild the cabinets. Sadly for Matt, this was but
one of many episodes of vengeful anger throughout his life. He says, “I can’t
tell you how many things I’ve had to rebuild in my life because of my anger.”
Ask yourself: Do I want to go through life like Matt, destroying something
every time I get angry? Am I willing to bear the expense of my vengeful anger?
Bringing about a positive change
Constructive anger is used to assert one’s authority, to achieve independence,
and to get another person to do something that’s good for him. If you’re a
parent, have you ever gotten angry with your child when you were just trying
to show her to behave safely (for example, not riding in a car with friends
who have been drinking or not staying out until 3 o’clock in the morning)?
Probably. At work, have you ever gotten angry with your subordinates and
said “Enough fooling around. We’ve got work to do here, so get busy.” Most
likely. As a young married person, have you ever expressed irritation with
your in-laws because they’re always telling you what’s best for you (“You
need to quit that job.” “That’s too much house for you.” “Don’t you think it’s
time you started a family?”) instead of letting you make your own indepen-
dent decisions? Sure. Well, then you’ve indulged in constructive anger.
Ask yourself: Am I satisfied that I’m using my anger in a way that benefits me
more than it hurts me?
149
Chapter 11: Using Anger Constructively

Letting off steam
Have you ever felt like you were just going to explode — and then you did?
Anger is one way a lot of people — normal people, not crazy or vengeful
people — let off steam. Their anger isn’t tied to any specific issue or person;
it’s sort of generic. It reflects a good bit of pent-up frustration and stress that
seeks relief. Think of a pressure cooker and you get the idea. Even though it
feels good, this type of anger is not constructive. Rather, it’s anger that is “full
of sound and fury, signifying nothing,” as Will Shakespeare would say.
Ask yourself: Is it enough to just “feel good” after I express my anger or would
I rather use anger to benefit my life in some meaningful way?
Using Anger to Understand Yourself
Anger is like a mirror — it doesn’t build character, and it doesn’t destroy it. It
simply reveals character. Anger tells you and the world what kind of person
you are, what you expect from life, what you’re passionate about, how much
alcohol you’ve had to drink, how stressed you are, and much more.
Close your eyes and imagine the last time you got mad at someone. Get that
situation fixed in your mind’s eye for a minute or two and assume the role of
an objective observer. What did you say or do in that moment of anger? Try
to be as specific as possible. Stay with the scene until you feel comfortable
that you can honestly answer the question: What did my anger say about me
in that situation?
Here are some possible answers:
 My anger says that I am a selfish person whose needs always come
before others.
 My anger says that I am a moral person who believes in fair play and 
justice.
 My anger says that I am impatient — my needs have to be met now.
 My anger says that my life is in chaos — nothing is working right.
 My anger says that I care enough about you to get upset when you put
yourself in harm’s way.
 My anger says that I am greedy — I always expect to have more than
others and I get mad when I don’t.
 My anger says that I feel I am not being treated with disrespect.
 My anger says that I need to dominate others in all types of life situations.
150
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

 My anger says that I am a “special” person and thus entitled to always
have my way.
 My anger says that I can feel another person’s pain.
 My anger says that I am a pessimist, always expecting that things won’t
work out and then getting mad when they don’t.
 My anger says that there’s way too much stress in my life — I’m over-
loaded!
 My anger says that it’s high time to make some positive changes in my
life — there has to be a better way to live.
Do you like what you see in the mirror? If not, then it’s time to do some 
reconstruction.
Constructive Anger
Constructive anger involves two things:
 Deciding where it is you want your anger to take you
 Arriving at that destination through a step-by-step process (which I out-
line in this section)
Before you begin, try saying the following statements to yourself — and
believe them. Even if you don’t believe that all these statements are true, pro-
ceed anyway.
 I need to reason through my anger.
 I need to put my anger into perspective.
 I can’t do a thing about what has happened to provoke my anger.
 The situation that made me angry should be rectified.
 I need to find other ways to express my anger.
Step 1: Decide how you want to 
feel after you get angry
How you use anger is a choice — and with that choice, comes consequences.
If you choose to use anger constructively — so that it has a positive outcome —
you’ll generally expect that, after you finish expressing your anger, you will:
151
Chapter 11: Using Anger Constructively

 Have a better understanding of the person with whom you had the
angry exchange.
 Feel better about that other person.
 Feel closer to resolving issues between you and the other person.
 Realize that things were never as bad as you initially thought they were
when you first became angry.
 Feel that both parties came away feeling like something good happened.
 Have less conflict in the future.
Conversely, if you choose to use anger constructively, you will not:
 Continue to hold a grudge against that other person.
 Feel totally justified in continuing to dislike that other person.
 Feel tense and agitated around that person.
 Dwell on your angry feelings.
 Feel compelled to rehash your angry feelings (and the reasons for them)
with anyone and everyone who’ll listen.
 Be defensive in social situations involving the other person.
 Feel that the problem between you and that person cannot ever be
resolved.
 Feel victimized by that other person.
 Feel impotent about how you dealt with the problem that caused your
anger.
 Feel as though you’re going to explode any minute.
On the other hand, if you choose to use your anger destructively, you should
expect the opposite outcomes — more conflict in the future, more tension
between you and the other person, and so on.
Step 2: Acknowledge your anger
A simple statement such as “I don’t know about you, but I find I’m getting irri-
tated about what just happened and I thought you should know that” will suf-
fice. What you want to do is give a heads-up to the other party in the
conversation, letting him know that emotions are in play here and that the
emotion you’re feeling is anger.
152
Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 

It’s not enough just to acknowledge to yourself that you’re angry — you have
to articulate that feeling to the person you’re angry with.
Step 3: Focus your anger on 
the problem, not the person
Taking a line from the movie The Godfather, when you engage in constructive
anger expression, you need to start with the idea that “it’s business — it’s not
personal.” In other words, focus on the issue that triggered your anger, not
the person on the other side of that issue.
Concentrate on the what not the who. When you begin to personalize anger
(for example, saying something like, “That stupid woman . . .”), your anger
will invariably turn vengeful.
Step 4: Identify the source of the problem
This step is an easy one. Why? Because the source of all your anger is you!
Before you slam this book shut and throw it across the room, give me a
chance to explain what I mean.
All your emotions are a reflection of yourself. If you’re angry with one of your
employees when she habitually comes to work late, the source of your anger
lies in the fact that you believe you aren’t getting a fair day’s work for a fair
day’s pay. Similarly, if you’re angry with your husband because he continues
to read the paper while you’re trying to tell him about your day at work, the
source of your anger is your belief that you aren’t getting the attention that
you want from him. If you didn’t have those beliefs, the actions of the other
people would be of no consequence.
Right away, as you internalize the source of your anger (taking responsibility
for how you feel — see Chapter 7 for a complete discussion on this), you
begin to feel more in control of your anger. Now, the question is: Do I alter my
expectations of that other person or do I clarify for them what those expecta-
tions are and what will happen if my expectations aren’t met? (Personally, I
suggest the latter.)
153
Chapter 11: Using Anger Constructively

Step 5: Accept that the 
problem can be solved
Fixing problems is much easier than fixing people. What you have is a prob-
lem situation. Try to remain optimistic that you can solve this problem. Be
open-minded — a closed mind goes nowhere; it just defends itself. Don’t be
afraid to try new solutions when the old ones don’t work.
A client of mine, I’ll call him Ted, called me saying he was in a dilemma. He
started by telling me how angry he was with his son-in-law, who often ver-
bally attacks him when he visits the family. That anger had, on more than one
occasion, led to mutual hostilities, including “saying some things I regretted
later on” as well as some pushing and shoving. Ted’s daughter had called and
invited Ted to his granddaughter’s birthday party. His question was: Should
he or shouldn’t he go and risk further abuse? Ted saw it as a lose-lose situation —
he was damned if he did and damned if he didn’t! He told me that he had
tried talking to his son-in-law, but this only provoked further rage on the son-
in-law’s part. He felt the situation was hopeless. What I recommended was,
first, that Ted not have a general rule about attending family functions involving
his son-in-law — in other words, Ted should decide what to do on a case-by-
case basis. I reminded him that he was under no obligation to attend family
gatherings and that his family was not entitled to have him show up regardless
of the consequences.
I also encouraged Ted not to let his anger at his son-in-law totally foreclose
any possibility of future relationship with his daughter and granddaughter. I
suggested that Ted look for opportunities to visit with his daughter and
granddaughter without the son-in-law present (for example, meet them for
lunch, take his granddaughter for a visit to the zoo, and so on).
I told Ted that he should be prepared to exit gracefully from any family situa-
tion at the very first sign that his son-in-law was intent on verbally attacking
him. The expectation shouldn’t be that “If I go, I have to stay no matter what.”
(In combat, all good generals have an exit strategy.)
I advised Ted to share the responsibility for solving this family problem with
his daughter — after all, it was she who had brought this angry man into the
family. Ask her what she’s prepared to do to make things better, if anything.
These were all things Ted hadn’t considered before and that might work. All
Ted could do was try.
Think about some anger-provoking situation you’ve been involved in that
seems unsolvable. Write down all the things you tried to correct the situa-
tion. Now, think about some things you haven’t tried. If nothing comes to
mind, talk to someone else about it and see what that person suggests. Two
minds are always better than one! After you come up with a new strategy, use
it the next time you’re in this situation.
154

Step 6: Try to see things from 
the other person’s perspective
Anger is so subjective that it’s hard to see past it, to put yourself in the other
person’s shoes. But seeing the situation from the other person’s perspective
is one of the most essential steps in using anger constructively.
The easiest way to understand why the other person thinks, feels, or acts the
way she does is to invite their input. For example, Ted (see the preceding sec-
tion) could say to his hostile son-in-law, “Whenever we get into a discussion, I
feel insulted when you call me names. I may be wrong, but it seems like
you’re really angry with me, and I’d like to talk with you about how you’re
feeling and why.” If you don’t give the other person an opportunity to tell you
where she’s coming from, you’re left to speculate — and odds are, you’ll
guess incorrectly.
Reverse roles. Think of yourself as that the other person and ask yourself:
 How am I feeling right now?
 What am I thinking?
 How would I explain my actions to another person, if asked?
 What could I tell someone that would perhaps make him less upset 
with me?
 What is it that other people don’t know about me that they should?
 Am I giving them the wrong impression of who I really am and what’s 
on my mind?
 Is my behavior justified in my mind and, if so, why?
Step 7: Co-op the other party
Another key step in constructive anger expression is to enlist the coopera-
tion of the person you’re angry with in resolving the problem. The question
here is not “What am I going to do about this problem?” but “What can we do
about finding a solution that works for both of us?” The minute you begin to
share the responsibility (or burden) of resolving an anger-producing prob-
lem, the intensity of your anger decreases.
155
Chapter 11: Using Anger Constructively

Step 8: Keep a civil tone throughout
What you say in anger isn’t what causes problems — it’s the tone in which
you say it. If you can keep a civil tone to your conversation, you’ll find that
actively listening to the person with whom you’re angry is easier — it’s also
easier to get your message across to that person. Lowering your tone will in
turn cause him to lower his. Civility doesn’t require that you stop being angry —
it just helps you use the anger more constructively.
Step 9: Avoid disrespectful behavior
Clearly, there are some things — gestures, behaviors — you need to avoid if
you’re going to use anger constructively. By all means, do not:
 Roll your eyes when the other person is speaking.
 Sigh laudably while she’s talking.
 Engage in finger-pointing.
 Lecture the other person when it’s your turn to speak.
 Use critical language (words like stupid, idiot, crazy, ignorant, or
ridiculous).

Part III: Preventing Anger Tomorrow 
Learning from my mistakes
For several years now, I’ve been conducting
anger-management classes in schools and,
unfortunately, I’ve found out a lot about the
things that don’t work with angry, alienated kids.
What doesn’t work is making them feel bad for
being angry. Another thing that doesn’t work is
assuming they’re all angry for the same rea-
sons. Assuming that they want to quit being so
angry just because the school (and I) want them
to doesn’t work either.
What does work, I’m finding out, is to engage
them in a dialogue that accepts their anger,
doesn’t judge it, and puts it in a big-picture per-
spective that fits their unique life story. In other
words, stop trying so hard to change them and
instead work just as hard to understand their
point of view.
So, instead of telling them how they should feel,
I ask them a lot of questions: What was it about
the teacher asking you to be quiet that made
you mad? What did you hope to accomplish by
punching the other kid on the bus? Do you see
any relationship between your leaving the
house angry with your dad and the fact that you
verbally attacked the teacher as soon as you
came in the classroom? Did you ever think of
any other way of handling that situation without
resorting to violence?
You guessed it: These questions are the kind
you can ask yourself if you want to understand
your anger and deal with it more constructively

 Repeatedly interrupt or talk over the other person.
 Personalize your message (for example, “What a fool you are!”).
Step 10: Don’t be afraid to take a timeout
and resume the discussion later
Don’t be afraid to say to the other person, “I think we’ve gone as far as we
can with this issue right now, but I really think we should continue our dis-
cussion at a later date. Do you agree?” Some issues take longer to solve than
others — just as some destinations are farther away than others.
This strategy only works if you actually do resume the discussion later.
Otherwise, all your constructive efforts were in vain!
Step 11: Make it a two-way conversation
Conflict resolution — which is a big part of anger management — requires a
two-way conversation. The point here is that, when it comes to addressing
your anger in a constructive way, you have to let the other person have a
turn, too. Vengeful anger and simply “letting off steam” don’t involve the
other party except as the object of your wrath. You’re trying to do something
different in this case, right?
Step 12: Acknowledge that 
you’ve made progress
Old bad habits like vengeful anger die hard. So, if you’re trying to begin using
anger more constructively, it’s important to acknowledge when progress is
being made anywhere along the way. Tell the other person, “You know, I feel
good about our discussion. I understand better where you’re coming from,
and I’m not nearly as upset as when we first started talking about this.” Then
ask her, “Do you feel the same way? Do you feel that I heard what you were
saying? Do you feel we’re closer to a resolution now than we were before?”
You hope, of course, that she says yes. But if she says, “No, not at all,” that’s
okay. Maybe she’ll change her mind in the future. (Most important, don’t get
mad just because she doesn’t agree with you!)
157
Chapter 11: Using Anger Constructively

What Goes Around Comes Around
My former professor and mentor, Dr. Charles Spielberger, at the University of
South Florida, once wrote a paper with a title I like: “Rage Boomerangs.” His
message was simple: Humans tend to “respond in kind” when they’re con-
fronted with anger. Anger begets anger, just like kindness begets kindness.
If you engage in vengeful anger toward others, they will most likely respond
with vengeful anger toward you. On the other hand, if you’re constructive in
how you express your anger, they’ll reciprocate in a similar manner.
If you’re caught up in this cycle of mutual anger, this is your chance to break
out. Make your next move based on how you want the person with whom
you’re engaged to respond. If you want him to ratchet down the intensity of
his anger, you start by toning down your end of the conversation. If you want
her to better understand why you’re angry, start by asking her to clarify why
she’s angry with you. If you don’t want him to treat your anger with disre-
spect (see the previous section), then don’t act disrespectful toward him.
Believe it or not, you’ll find that you have more of a positive influence on
“what comes around next” than you imagined.

No wonder I have low blood pressure
Recent studies have shown that adults who
express their anger constructively tend to have
lower resting blood pressure even after other
known risk factors — age, smoking, obesity,
family history — have been accounted for.
Studies have also shown that adults can learn
constructive anger expression and, when they
do, they experience less hostility and decreased
blood pressure. This is an example of when
anger management translates into medical
management.
The most likely response
In a survey of high school students, we asked
kids how they would respond if another student
got angry with them. We gave them three
choices:
 Just walk off.
 Get angry right back.
 Walk away but come back later to discuss
the problem.
Guess what the most popular choice was?
Forty-nine percent of the boys and 42 percent of
the girls selected the second response (answer
anger with anger). Even more enlightening was
the finding that, among the most angry children
in the school, the likelihood of engaging in
mutual anger was a whopping 87 percent!
These kids are caught up in a vicious cycle of
reciprocal anger that dominates all of their peer
relationships.

Part IV
Handling Anger
from the Past

In this part . . .
W
e tackle the toughest challenge of all: managing
anger from your past. I want you to be able to dig
your way out from old anger that lies just below the sur-
face and that can be triggered at any time for any reason.
To begin with, stop trying so hard to forget those old,
unresolved grievances that create so much emotional
harm. Your task is not to forget, but to forgive — and for-
giveness is never easy. In this part, you explore what you
have to do before you can get beyond your emotional
past. My goal in this part is to get you to stop playing the
blame game and realize that the person who benefits the
most from your forgiveness is you.

Chapter 12
Why Is Letting Go So Difficult?
In This Chapter
 Understanding why anger persists
 Examining your fears
 Living without closure
 Deciding when time’s up
A
nger is an emotion, and emotions are meant to be short lived.
Excitement, fear, sadness, surprise, irritation — all are emotions that
pass through you throughout the day. But, for some people, anger persists,
and through its persistence, anger is harmful.
Take, for example, Marilyn, a 55-year-old married woman. She continues to be
angry about the mistreatment she suffered at work over 15 years ago. Marilyn
was injured on the job and, as a result, she not only had to change jobs, but
also endure continuous pain in her lower back. Marilyn found her employer
to be woefully unsympathetic, which only gave her more reason to be angry.
After several years of struggling, she experienced a nervous breakdown and
was terminated by her employer altogether. The resentment that Marilyn has
harbored over the years has all but ruined her health and has taken its toll on
her marriage. She isn’t just a victim in the sense of having been permanently
injured — she’s also the victim of her own unresolved anger.
In this chapter, I discuss some of the reasons why people like Marilyn hang on
to anger. I also offer some solutions for letting go of this troublesome emotion.
Digging Out from Anger
When you get angry, do you have trouble letting go of your anger? When your
anger is triggered, does it tend to consume you, transforming you into an
entirely different human being? When you’re mad, are you deaf, dumb, and
blind to the world around you — listening only to your own hostile thoughts?
Do you have trouble seeing beyond the anger so that you can focus instead

on the issues behind it? Do you stand by helplessly as your mood progresses
from irritation, to anger, and finally to a state of full-blown rage? If your
answer to any of these questions is yes, then you need some tools to dig your
way out from anger.
Resistance equals persistence
Ever try not to think about something? Try not thinking about the word ele-
phant for five minutes and see what happens. The more you resist that
thought, the more it persists — elephant, elephant, elephant!
It’s the same with emotions like anger. The more you tell yourself, “I’m not
mad, I’m not hurt, it doesn’t bother me,” the longer you stay mad. And, after
a while, that feeling begins to fester.
Sarah had recurrent migraine headaches for most of her adult life — that is,
until her husband’s untimely death at the age of 60. Shortly after her husband
died, Sarah’s headaches stopped completely. The reason: Sarah no longer
had to resist expressing the anger she felt toward her husband, a man who
she says, “was angry all the time about almost everything and took it out on
me.” Her husband would explode with verbal rage and five minutes later, 
he was fine. But not Sarah. She held on to her anger for days — sometimes
weeks — expressing it through silence and pain. “When he lashed out at me, 
I couldn’t let it be. Staying angry was my way of telling him, ‘You’re not going
to get away with this!’” But, who was Sarah really hurting by hanging on to
her anger? Herself.
Isn’t it time you stopped resisting both the experience and expression of
anger in your life? If the answer is yes, start letting go by following these
seven steps:
1. Identify the source of your anger.
What person, event, or circumstance provoked your anger? How long
ago was this?
2. Acknowledge your angry feelings.
Say aloud, “I am angry because. . . .” Then decide how angry you are
(what I refer to in Chapter 6 as rate and label). Rate the intensity of your
emotion on a scale of 1 (mild) to 10 (extreme). Ratings of 1 to 3 translate
into irritation, ratings of 4 to 6 suggest that you’re mad or angry, and rat-
ings of 7 to 10 imply a state of rage.
3. Legitimize your anger.
Remind yourself that you have a right to experience anger, just as you
have a right to feel joy or excitement. You don’t really need to justify
your anger — anger is, as one workshop participant I knew noted, “one
way I know I’m alive!”
162
Part IV: Handling Anger from the Past 

4. Give yourself permission to express anger.
Anger has gotten a bad rap because people all too often associate it with
violence, rudeness, and incivility. But, there are lots of healthy, construc-
tive ways to express anger (see Chapter 11 if you want some examples).
Constructively expressing your anger should be your goal.
5. List three ways in which your life is better off by letting go of anger.
For Sarah, letting go of anger — after her husband’s death — ended a
lifetime of headaches, gave her peace of mind “every time I walk through
the front door and don’t have to worry about seeing that angry face star-
ing back at me,” and the freedom to live a life without anger. When last I
checked, Sarah was off on yet another cruise adventure and enjoying life
to the fullest.
6. Decide how best to express anger without hurting yourself or others.
Don’t get me wrong — I’m not proposing that you let go of anger by rant-
ing and raving for the world to hear. That’s neither healthy nor construc-
tive. In anything, venting tends to sustain anger not relieve it. But, you
can talk about your anger more openly (see Chapter 8), use exercise to
drain away your angry feelings, or take pen to hand and “confess” your
anger in writing (see Chapter 9).
7. Proceed accordingly.
It’s time to move forward and implement the decision(s) you made in
Step 6. You’ll be glad you did.
What are you afraid of?
Most people hold on to anger because of fear. Some common fears that may
keep you from letting go of anger include:
 Fear of making another person angry
 Fear of hurting someone else’s feelings
163
Chapter 12: Why Is Letting Go So Difficult?
When your back pain isn’t just back pain
Dr. John Sarno, author of Mind Over Back Pain,
believes that most chronic back pain is not the
result of herniated discs and pinched nerves,
but rather the muscular tension and accompa-
nying inflammation associated with suppressed
anger. Dr. Sarno believes that by releasing this
pent-up anger, patients can eventually relax and
achieve pain relief.
I agree with him — so much so that I’ve incor-
porated an anger-management component into
my chronic-pain rehabilitation program.

 Fear that letting go of anger will mean you forgive the person who made
you angry
 Fear that you’ll lose you reputation as a “nice” person if you express
anger
 Fear that when you start to express anger, you’ll lose control of your
emotions
 Fear of other emotions (for example, sadness) that underlie your anger
 Fear that others will see you as weak or vulnerable
 Fear that if you let go of your anger, you’re letting the other person off
the hook
 Fear that anger will cause you to lose something you value (for example,
a job or a friendship)
 Fear of admitting, once and for all, that you’re only human
What are you afraid of?
Being nice doesn’t mean being powerless
Who says “Nice guys finish last”? Pretty much everyone — because we’ve all
learned to associate niceness with powerlessness. But, as it turns out, one
does not necessarily mean the other.
The dictionary defines a nice person as someone who is pleasant, agreeable,
courteous, considerate, and delightful. It doesn’t say anything about your
being a victim of other people’s bad behavior. It doesn’t mean that you don’t
stand up for yourself. It doesn’t say you don’t deserve to be respected, safe,
and treated fairly by others.
If you see yourself as truly powerless, you’ll tend to store up feelings of anger
instead of letting them go. In an effort to be seen as ultra-nice, you’ll say
you’re “fine” when you’re actually irritated. And those irritations will linger
and — slowly but surely — accumulate into a feeling of anger. How many
times over the years have you read in the newspaper about someone who
went into a public place and started shooting innocent people for no appar-
ent reason? And how many times have his neighbors and friends described
the gunman as a “really quiet, nice person”? Too many.
Mark was one of the nicest clients I’ve ever worked with. He was a man in his
60s, who was raised in the traditions of the Old South, where a gentleman
never showed his temper in public. By day, Mark was a sweet, pleasant,
164
Part IV: Handling Anger from the Past 

charming, and accommodating man. No matter how badly he was treated, he
would simply respond by saying, “That’s fine — don’t worry about it.” But, by
night, he was a raging tiger. While sleeping peacefully, he would ferociously
grind his teeth (on the fresh meat of all those who had wronged him during
the day). On one occasion, he woke up to find his bed sheet covered with
blood from three broken teeth — like a scene from the movie The Godfather.
His dental bills were huge. Despite his calm façade and cordial demeanor,
Mark was a walking time bomb of rage.
Therapy changed all that. Mark found that he could continue to be nice with-
out being powerless. So, when a friend stood him up for a luncheon appoint-
ment that had been planned for weeks, instead of waiting patiently for an
hour and absorbing his irritation, Mark left after 15 minutes, went home, and
called his friend to say that he didn’t appreciate being stood up. The result:
He stopped grinding his teeth at night altogether (much to the chagrin of his
dentist who remarked one day “I don’t know what’s changed in your life, but
it’s been over a year since you’ve been in here with a tooth problem. If you
keep this up, I’ll be broke!”).
If you hang on to anger today, it becomes both yesterday’s and tomorrow’s
anger.

Chapter 12: Why Is Letting Go So Difficult?
Not like my father
I loved my father and I hated my father. I loved
him because he brought me into this world and
he was the only father I had. I hated him
because he drank too much and was always
angry.
As a child, I held back on any anger I had
toward my dad because, quite honestly, I was
afraid he might hurt me physically. As an adult,
I continued to stifle my anger because I didn’t
want to be like him. I wanted to be as easygoing
and stoic as he was volatile. I wanted to be as
approachable as he was remote and distant.
I still remember — 50 years later — the day my
mother, in a moment of anger, yelled at me,
“You’re just like your father!” She might as well
have stabbed me in the heart — it hurt that
much. Did I answer her back in anger, saying,
“No I’m not. I’m not anything like him, and you
know that!”? No — I just lowered my head and
walked away in silence.
In order to avoid one type of anger problem
(outrageousness), I had developed another (“in-
rageousness”). In an understandable effort to
distinguish myself from my father in how I
expressed my anger, I had missed my mother’s
real message — like my father before me, I had
a lot of anger.

Who hangs on and who lets go?
Letting go of anger in a timely manner doesn’t come easy to everyone. It can
be especially difficult if you are
 Young: The younger you are, the harder it is for you to let go of anger. As
people age, they tend to get angry less often and get over it more
quickly. Perhaps they find that staying angry too long takes too much
energy — something that becomes more precious as one ages.
 Female: All across the age spectrum, women tend to hang on to anger
longer than men. Men’s anger tends to be more intense, but they get
over it quicker. Women more often do a “slow burn” when they get mad.
In large part, this may be due to the fact that, generally, women are per-
ceived as nicer than their male counterparts.
 An ethnic minority: Being part of a minority group is characterized,
among other things, by a tendency to suppress anger. In a hierarchical
society, where power tends to be concentrated at the top, anger rarely
flows upward. Those at the bottom tend to complain but otherwise “grin
and bear it.”
 Too angry: Obviously, the more intense your anger, the harder it is to let
go. Letting go of irritations — or even normal anger — is relatively easy.
But rage, that’s a different matter altogether.
 An intellectual: Some folks intellectualize anger — think it to death —
while others just get upset. Don’t get me wrong, intelligence is a wonder-
ful thing — unless it gets in the way of constructive anger expression.
 The child of nice parents: People who hold their anger in, rather than
let it go, tend to have parents they describe as: loving, warm, easygoing,
relaxed. In other words, nice. Those who express their anger openly and
without reservation tend to have the opposite kind of parents — cold,
distant, strict, and excitable. Monkey see, monkey do!
 A certain type personality: Introverts, avoiders, and dependent (or
codependent) personalities all tend to move away from conflict and
166

The myth of the angry black man
The media’s profile of the angry black man is a
myth. A study looking at the link between anger
suppression and high blood pressure examined
the typical anger-coping style of hundreds of
black and white men and women living in a
large metropolitan city. Black males were the
group most likely to keep anger suppressed in
response to provocation — for example, hous-
ing discrimination. Perhaps that explains why
they also tend to have a much higher incidence
of hypertension which, in turn, leads to higher
rates of heart attacks and strokes.

emotional discomfort. Their reluctance to experience or express anger
is motivated by fear — fear of confrontation or the loss of a relationship
on which they depend for their very survival. Ironically, highly aggres-
sive personalities — those who move against the world — also tend to
hang on to anger, but for different reasons. They need to stay angry in
order to satisfy their aggressive, win-at-all-costs style of dealing with the
world around them (and that includes you and me!).
 Suffering from depression: The legendary psychoanalyst, Sigmund
Freud, thought of depression as “anger turned inward.” If you feel
uncomfortable expressing your anger directly at its source, you’re more
likely to either sit on it or turn it on yourself. Expressing anger also takes
energy, and people who suffer from depression often lack energy.
 Emotionally illiterate: You may be surprised by how many adults
cannot find words to adequately or accurately describe what they’re
feeling. If you ask them how they feel about something, they respond by
telling you what they think (“He isn’t being fair”) or what they did (“I just
walked off”). As a therapist, I find myself reminding my clients that emo-
tions are feelings — like happy, sad, mad, glad. Just pick one!
 Guilt ridden: Guilt can be a good thing, but it should be reserved for
those occasions where you’ve done something intentionally wrong,
mean, or harmful. Unfortunately, for some people, guilt is the gift that
keeps on giving, restricting the free flow of normal, healthy emotions —
including anger — in all facets of life.
 A believer: If you’re religious and believe in a higher power — regardless
of doctrine or denomination — you’ve probably been taught to “turn the
other cheek” when faced with hostility and that anger is “the devil’s
work.” With this perspective, expressing anger — even irritation — can
seem like an ungodly act.
167
Chapter 12: Why Is Letting Go So Difficult?
My Jewish mentor
The next best thing to being Jewish is having a
close friend who is. Many years ago, I found
myself in a very stressful, unhappy job situation
with — it seemed to me at the time — no way
out. I had tenure, so the administration couldn’t
fire me, but they did the next best thing and
made my time at work a living hell.
One day, feeling pretty beat up emotionally, I
called a good friend of mine, who happens to be
Jewish, and asked his advice as to what I
should do. At first, he laughed and said, “You
gentiles are all alike — you only read the half of
the Bible that carries the good news. Read the
Old Testament and call me back in a week.”
I took his advice and a week later called and
told him “Now that I see that I’m not the only
one in the world who has struggled with adver-
sity, I feel better.”
“Good,” he said. “Now get a good lawyer and
go after those bastards!”

Trying the ten-minute rant
One of the reasons people have difficulty letting go of anger is that they
express it a little bit here and a little bit there over a period of time, rather
than all at once.
At one of my biweekly adult pain-management groups, I noticed that all the
participants were in miniconversations trashing physicians for not “fixing”
their pain. There was an obvious undercurrent of pent-up anger. So, I
abruptly said, “I’ll tell you what we need to do here: have each one of you
take a turn saying every angry, hateful thing you can think of about surgeons.
Each of you will have ten minutes to get it all off your chest. No one will inter-
rupt you, so go for it!”
The first patient vented his anger about his doctor for about seven minutes
and then began to run out of steam. “Keep going,” I admonished him. “You’ve
still got three more minutes. We want to hear it all.”
One after another, members of the group had their say, pretty much parroting
one another. Interestingly, as we went around the group, each person had
trouble filling up the ten minutes. At the end, about an hour and a half later,
they were all emotionally exhausted. After that exercise, it was rare for
anyone to bring up angry feelings about their doctors — apparently, there
was nothing left to say!
At the end of each day, try giving yourself a ten-minute rant. One of my
clients does it while taking a hot shower. She lives alone and no one is there
to hear her anyway. She finds it quite refreshing. Or, you could confess your
anger in writing (for details, see Chapter 9).
The anger you let go of today doesn’t carry over into tomorrow.

Excuse you!
Are you one of those people who is forever
saying “Excuse me!” when some rude person
bumps into you or engages in some other type
of incivility. If so, you need to stop. Otherwise,
you’ll end up being one of life’s many victims,
whose mantra seems to be “Excuse me for
living!”
Be assertive. The next time some aggressive
person bumps into you or cuts in front of you in
line, say “Excuse you!” instead. You’ll be
amazed at how good that feels and how much
pause it gives other people who are within
earshot.

Maybe you’re the kind of person who holds on to anger until you can resolve
the problem that caused it in the first place. That’s a great approach if you’re
dealing with a solvable problem. But what if the problem can’t be resolved at
all — or at least not completely? What purpose does hanging on to anger
serve then?
You’ll encounter lots of problems, conflicts, and situations in life that, despite
your best efforts, will never have a happy or satisfying outcome. These situa-
tions you have to live with — without resolution. Examples include
 Childhood abuse
 Being raised in an alcoholic home
 Sexual assault
 Birth defects
 Loss of loved ones (through death, divorce, or abandonment)
 Chronic illness
 Natural catastrophes (like floods, hurricanes, or tornadoes)
 War
 Disfigurement
 Disability
 Irreversible loss of income
 Having an addict in the family
The next time you get angry, ask yourself these questions: Can my anger cor-
rect the situation? Can it undo what has been done? Or, is this one of those
times when “after the toothpaste is out of the tube, you can’t put it back!” If
so, then let it go.
Time’s Up: When to Let Go
Here’s the $64,000 (or in today’s economy, $1,000,000) question: How long
should you hang on to anger? How long before it begins to hurt you? How
long is too long?
169
Chapter 12: Why Is Letting Go So Difficult?

My answer is simple: 25 minutes at the most. Why 25 minutes, you ask? As
Table 12-1 illustrates, most people let go of today’s anger in less than half an
hour. (This data is based on responses from 286 ordinary people I surveyed
ranging in age from 13 to 83.) So it’s pretty safe to consider less than half an
hour the norm — thus, anger that lasts longer than 25 minutes is lasting too
long.

Think of this as the 25-minute rule: The next time you find yourself angry,
look at your watch to see what time it is. If you don’t wear a watch, ask the
person you’re angry at for the time. Keep checking the time so that you know
when 25 minutes have passed. If your anger has already subsided, good for
you. But if it’s still there, say aloud “Time’s up!”, let go of the anger, and move
forward with your day. (This book is full of simple, easy, practical exercises
for letting go of today’s anger that you can use during that critical 25-minute
window of opportunity.)

The angry smoker
There is a statistical link between cigarette
smoking and how long people stay angry.
Smokers take longer to let go of anger than non-
smokers. Or, put another way, people who have
trouble letting go of anger are more likely to
smoke cigarettes.
One explanation is that some people self-
medicate anger with nicotine (for more detail,
see Chapter 15). Another possibility is that
smoking, along with the intensity and duration
of a person’s anger, is linked to an impulsive
temperament and may reflect how one is phys-
iologically “wired.”

Chapter 13
Forgiving
In This Chapter
 Understanding that you don’t have to forget to forgive
 Letting yourself off the hook
 Letting go of blame
 Knowing that forgiveness is voluntary
 Conducting a cost-benefit analysis
Jack is in his 50s now. His health is poor. He’s disabled from work. He’s
lonely. And he has little to show for his life. Jack is a broken man. Looking
back, Jack has many regrets. Chief among them is the fact that he alienated
himself from his family years earlier. “I know now I was wrong. My family —
all they were trying to do was help me. I turned them away. I needed their
help, but I turned them all away. And, for that, I feel sorry,” he laments.
The one thing Jack doesn’t regret, however, is his life-long anger at his
mother, who had to put him in an orphanage for a brief time when he was
very young. “She abandoned me — left me with strangers — and I’ll never for-
give her for that!” he explains. Just the mention of that hurtful time elevates
his voice and brings tears to his eyes — 45 years after the fact. His mother —
who is now in her late 80s and suffering from Alzheimer’s — came back to get
him after a year, when she could provide Jack and his brother with a stable
home, and she raised Jack until he graduated from high school and joined the
Army. But none of that mattered to Jack. His mother had committed an
unpardonable crime and he would punish her — and himself — for the
remainder of his life for that one act.
The anger toward his mother that Jack carried all through life, in the end, is
what broke him. He had a good job and friends, and he was surrounded by
people who loved him. But his outrageous temper trumped all that. Anger,
which on more than one occasion resulted in physical violence, cost him two
marriages, a relationship with his only son, his job, and ultimately his health.
And yet, even today, Jack is unforgiving.

This chapter offers strategies for letting go of old feelings of anger and hurt
that are tied to past grievances. It provides you with both a rationale and a
road map for handling yesterday’s anger — which, I believe, is the most diffi-
cult type of anger to manage. As far as I can tell, there is only one antidote to
anger from the past — and that is forgiveness.
Forgiveness Is Never Easy
For reasons none of us can fathom, forgiveness never comes easily to human
beings. Anger, now that comes easy — but forgiveness, no. You were born
with an instinctual capacity for anger, but forgiveness is something you have
to learn. It’s a skill, really — no different from riding a bicycle, playing soccer,
or speaking a foreign language.
You may be one of those lucky people who was raised in a tradition of for-
giveness. You learned to forgive by observing the forgiveness that your par-
ents showed one another. Or you learned it through your participation in
organized religion — in church, synagogue, or temple. If so, forgiveness
comes easier for you than it does for the rest of us.
Some examples of life experiences that are most difficult to forgive are
 Childhood abandonment (by death or divorce)
 Physical abuse
 Emotional abuse
 Sexual abuse
 Rape
 Traumatic workplace injury
 Betrayal by a spouse
 Parental neglect
 Assault
 Death of a child
 Death or injury due to drunk driving
 Unexpected job loss
 Violations of trust or innocence
172
Part IV: Handling Anger from the Past 

It takes time
Forgiveness is a process, not a thing. It’s a journey, really. A magic wand is a
thing — and, when it comes to forgiving those who have wronged you, there
is no magic wand. The longer you’ve been holding on to anger, the more time
you need to reach that point of resolution called forgiveness. Jack, the man I
mention in the introduction to this chapter, has been angry at his mother for
over 40 years. Even if he begins the process of forgiveness today, it will be
some time before he completes it. The good news for him is that time is on
his side. His mother is still alive and, if he can forgive her before she dies, he
will undoubtedly have less guilt and remorse after she’s gone.
Is today the day you’re ready to start this journey — to free yourself from
yesterday’s anger?
It requires support
Nothing worth doing is worth doing alone. Forgiving someone takes strength,
courage, maturity — and, some of that you can draw from those around you.
Who do you know who can serve as your forgiveness ally? Who has already
been encouraging you to let go of anger from the past? Who can serve as a
positive role model — someone who has forgiven some past transgression
and moved on with his life?
It’s true that forgiveness is a voluntary act. No one can (or should) force you
to forgive another person. As a therapist, I’ve never advised a client to forgive
someone. What I do, though, is offer forgiveness as an option that each person
should consider in her efforts to find peace of mind. But the choice is entirely
hers. And, of course, I offer to support her if she makes this healthy choice.
Do you have the support you need to begin this journey?
173
Chapter 13: Forgiving
Support is only support if . . .
Support is only support if you take advantage of
it. Your support network is the number of people
you can count on to help you deal with adver-
sity in life. Support, on the other hand, has to do
with your willingness to avail yourself of that
help. Some of us actually have a small network,
yet we feel a tremendous sense of support as
we struggle our way through life. Others have a
huge network and yet feel isolated and alone.
The irony is that people who are full of anger
and resentment, who need support the most,
are the least likely to accept it.

It demands sacrifice
Now comes the hard part. In order to forgive someone, you have to sacrifice
something. Something has to give. The question is, “What?” Consider the fol-
lowing possibilities:
 You have to give up being a victim.
 You have to give up the myth that “life must always be fair.”
 You have to give up your use of anger to protect yourself from emotional
pain.
 You have to give up reliving the initial grievance day after day.
 You have to give up this hold you’re letting the other person have on
you by keeping him foremost in your thoughts.
 You have to surrender your “right” to revenge.
 You have to give up the notion that by holding on to anger you can
somehow undo the injustice that was done to you.
 You have to give up the idea that you’re entitled to the good life — a life
free of stress, misfortune, pain, and injury.
 You have to give up the belief that everyone — especially those closest
to you — must always approve of you and treat you with consideration.
 You have to give up the idea that forgiveness is a sign of personal 
weakness.
Are you ready to make the necessary sacrifices?
Choosing to Forgive
As the old saying goes, “Timing is everything.” Conditions need to be right
before you can honestly expect to begin a journey of forgiveness.
You have to be safe
Anger does play a protective role in unsafe life circumstances — situations
where mistreatment is ongoing, where you are on guard against the poten-
tially hurtful actions of others, and where you believe your physical or emo-
tional survival is threatened. To ask yourself to forgive someone who is
actively harming you here and now is, I think, too much to ask. You have to
be safe first.
174
Part IV: Handling Anger from the Past 

I didn’t forgive my father for his alcoholic, outrageous behavior until after he
died. In life, he was far too imposing of a figure. And no matter how old I was,
I never stopped being intimidated by the very sight of him. When I visited
him on his deathbed — after years of being estranged — I saw a man who
was sadly defeated by life, shrunken in appearance, and reconciled to his
own death. At that very moment, my heart began to soften, and I think that’s
when I began to forgive him.
My mother was a different story. I forgave her for being less than the ideal
parent — and that’s putting it mildly — while she was still alive. But I could
do so because I was safe. I was a grown man, I had achieved some measure of
success in life, and I lived three states away from her. In other words, I have
managed to separate myself emotionally from her, seeing myself no longer as
her child but rather as her son. And because she could no longer hurt me, I
could afford to love her fully, without recrimination.
Are you safe enough to start a process of forgiveness?
You have to acknowledge the 
frailty of human nature
The thing we mostly need to forgive others for is being human. Humans are
actually very frail creatures, despite all the marvelous advancements in tech-
nology that we find around us each and every day. We make mistakes. We
hurt other people’s feelings — intentionally or not. At times, we’re far too
selfish. We say “no” when we should say “yes.” I could go on and on.
Most people mean well. Most people do the best they can under the circum-
stances. But, often, that’s not good enough. So, people end up blaming each
other for what? For being human.
You probably get angry with people because they don’t do what you expect
of them. But do you expect too much? Nobody has the absolutely perfect
parent, child, boss, spouse, or friend. And if you can’t forgive yourself (“I hate
myself. I’m a loser. I never do anything right.”), is that because you hold your-
self to an unrealistic, all-or-nothing standard of performance?
In the immortal words of humorist Woody Allen, “We are all bozos on the
same bus.” Some of us are poor bozos, some intelligent bozos, some beautiful
bozos, some inconsiderate bozos, some difficult bozos — but, in the end,
we’re still bozos.
Isn’t it time you looked at the person you’ve been unable to forgive simply as
a “bozo” — maybe a big bozo — instead of some evil person who deserves
your vengeance?
175
Chapter 13: Forgiving

Doing a Cost-Benefit Analysis
If you’re going to forgive someone, there definitely has to be something in it
for you. You have to believe that it is in your self-interest to let go of yester-
day’s anger. And, that basically comes down to two questions you need to ask
yourself:
 Who are you letting off the hook?
 Do you deserve to be happy?
Who are you letting off the hook?
I would argue that the primary beneficiary of your forgiveness is you. Forget
about the other person — do it for yourself! Forgiveness should be about your
anger, not her bad behavior. In fact, the thought that you’re doing something
good for a bad person can only serve as an obstacle to starting this journey.
So, let’s see what it’s costing you to hang on to old anger as compared to how
you might benefit if you let go. Here are some of the costs of hanging on:
 You constantly relive the painful past.
 Old anger finds its way into your present and future relationships.
 You feel drained as a result of all that anger.
 You continue to feel like a victim.
 You lose sight of the positives in your life.
 You remain in a constant state of mourning.
 Your health is compromised.
 You have difficulty also forgiving yourself.
176
Part IV: Handling Anger from the Past 
How to ruin a good marriage
Professor John Gottman, a leading expert on
the dynamics of healthy marriages, has con-
cluded that the primary cause of divorce is 
a feeling of utter contempt by one or both 
partners toward each other that expresses 
itself through a variety of demeaning behav-
iors. Contempt implies that one person is 
better — more worthy — than the other, that
one person has fewer (if any) character 
flaws or faults, that one person is indeed supe-
rior to his mate in all respects. Contempt 
leaves no room for equity or parity in intimate
relationships — it’s simply a matter of who is
master and who is slave.

 You remain in a constant state of tension.
 Your unresolved anger turns into bitterness and hostility.
And here are some of the benefits of letting go:
 Your energy is freed up for constructive use.
 Your life is now focused on the present rather than the past.
 You no longer feel so vulnerable.
 Your outlook becomes much more optimistic.
 When you forgive, others tend to forgive you.
 It becomes easier to forgive yourself — for being human.
 Your health improves.
 You experience an inner peace that you haven’t felt before.
 You have a newfound sense of maturity.
 You move beyond the pain of past transgressions.
Isn’t it time to let yourself off the hook?
Do you deserve to be happy?
I would argue that, of course, you deserve to be happy. But the answer to
that question is really something you have to decide for yourself. If you
agree, then you have to let go of the recurrent memories of past wrongs, the
blame you attach to the other person’s behavior, your desire for revenge —
all that baggage. You see, bitterness and happiness are incompatible. If you
keep one, you lose all chance for the other.
Is there some reason you feel you don’t deserve a chance at happiness?
177
Chapter 13: Forgiving
The gift of forgiveness
A good friend of mine got angry with me years
ago and didn’t speak to me for a long time.
Looking back, I can now see that he had good
reason for his anger, but that can’t make up for
all the good times we lost because of it. Hard as
it was, I accepted that our relationship was over
and I grieved both for what was and what might
have been.
And, then one day — completely out of the 
blue — my friend reopened the door and gave
us a second chance. That day continues to 
be one of the happiest of my life and not a day
goes by that I don’t feel grateful for his gift of
forgiveness.

Accepting the Finality of Being Wronged
Another obstacle on the journey of forgiveness has to do with accepting the
finality of being wronged in some way. Have you ever thought in an angry
moment, “I’m going to stay angry until I get justice, until things are set right
again, or until I can somehow even the score”? Well, good luck, because that
day will never come. What in the world can a parent do to truly even the
score when his child dies at the hands of a drunk driver? How does the wife
of an unfaithful man get true justice? How do you set right the fact that your
employer went out of business, causing you to lose the best job you ever
had? How do you make up for parents who neglected or abused you?
When I say that in order to forgive someone you have to accept that he did
you wrong, I’m not suggesting that you overlook what he did — absolutely
not! Nor, am I suggesting that you approve of his hurtful behavior. And I’m
not asking you to pardon him of his sins. No need to. But you do have to
accept what was done and move on.
You don’t have to forget the past
Now that I’m over 60 years old, I find that I try more and more to convince
myself that there must be some blessings associated with late life. And then it
came to me — the one good thing about Alzheimer’s disease is that you
finally forget all the bad things in your life. Short of Alzheimer’s, however, I’m
afraid that forgetting the past just isn’t that easy.
178
Part IV: Handling Anger from the Past 
The age of forgiveness
Forgiveness requires a certain amount of matu-
rity. And maturity, ideally, comes with age.
Young children can be quite unforgiving
because they deal in what Dr. Bernard Golden,
author of Healthy Anger: How to Help Children
and Teens Manage Their Anger, calls “child
logic,” logic that is self-centered, unrealistic,
and dominated by emotion. The same can be
true of adolescents, who for the first time begin
to see that the adult world is complex, imper-
fect, and at times unfair — but still a world in
which we have to live. This, in large part,
accounts for the heightened levels of anger in
these early years (more about this in Chapter 2).
As you grow older, forgiveness is more of an
option. Child logic no longer prevails. You have
a more balanced, realistic view of yourself and
your fellow human beings. You come more and
more to acknowledge and accept the fact that
we’re all frail creatures. The world is not simply
a matter of black and white. We hurt each other,
intentionally or not, as we journey through life.
Forget that it shouldn’t be that way — it is that
way! Maybe the ability to forgive is the real gift
of age.

When clients who have suffered some trauma come to me, often the first
question they ask is “Doctor, when will I get over this?” My honest answer,
one that none of them likes or at first understands, is “Never.” I then explain
that human beings don’t get over bad things; if they’re lucky (or get the right
kind of help), they just get beyond those things. Bottom line: You’ll never
forget whatever it is that you have trouble forgiving. But you don’t have to.
The memory will linger. What you have to do is get to the point where you
can remember without anger. And the only way to do that is forgiveness.
The harder you try to forget something — the more you try not to think
about it — the more you remember it. Try this: Close you eyes and try really
hard not to think about cucumbers for ten minutes. See what happens?
Cucumbers on the brain.
Choose pain over anger
Most people hang on to old anger as a way of avoiding pain. That makes per-
fectly good sense — because anger (particularly rage) is such a strong emo-
tion and it can mask even the most severe physical and emotional pain. But
sooner or later, you’re going to have to deal with the pain anyway. It’s like the
old saying, “You can run but you cannot hide!”
Mandy’s family brought her to see me because they were facing yet another
difficult Christmas after the untimely death of Mandy’s youngest daughter.
Clearly, the woman didn’t want to be sitting in my office, and she did every-
thing she could to appear pleasant, assuring me that she didn’t have any psy-
chological problems. That is until I asked about her daughter, whereupon
Mandy suddenly became visibly angry and snapped, “I don’t want to talk
about my daughter. That’s none of your business. She died and there’s noth-
ing else to say.”
I asked a few more questions about her death — how long ago it happened,
what time of year it was, the cause of her death — and she became increas-
ingly agitated. Then I asked her to verify what her family had said about how,
every Christmas, she brings out all the wrapped presents for her daughter
that were under the tree four years earlier at the time of her death. She
acknowledged that she did that, so I asked her why. She burst out in rage, “So
she’ll have her presents when she comes back!” “What do you mean ‘comes
back’?” I replied. “She’s dead.” The pain on that poor woman’s face was obvi-
ous, as she yelled, “Don’t you say that! Don’t you ever say that! My daughter
is coming back to me. If not this Christmas, then next. And her presents are
going to be there — right where they were when she went away.”
The woman stormed out of my office with her distressed family in tow, and I
never saw them again.
179
Chapter 13: Forgiving

Mandy wasn’t full of forgiveness. She couldn’t forgive the fact that her daugh-
ter was gone forever. She couldn’t forgive God for letting this terrible thing
happen to her and her family. She couldn’t forgive her family for trying to get
her to move on with her life. She couldn’t forgive her husband and remaining
children for not wanting their Christmas ruined. She couldn’t forgive herself
for being a mother who couldn’t protect her child from a life-ending illness.
And she couldn’t forgive me for confronting her with the reality of her tragic
loss. All these things that she couldn’t forgive left her consumed with anger.
The only way Mandy can get beyond the anger is to let herself feel the pain of
losing her daughter — which is what grief counseling is all about.

Lifestyle Changes
That Improve More
Than Your Anger

In this part . . .
I
argue that emotions, like anger, do not occur in a
vacuum. To the contrary, your emotions say a lot about
how you live your life — how much sleep you get, what
kinds of chemicals (like nicotine or caffeine) you ingest
throughout the day, how well you’re handling stress,
whether you have a balanced lifestyle, how spiritual you
are, and your prevailing mood. The techniques I offer in
this part are intended to make you a happier, healthier
person, not just someone who is less angry. You’ll dis-
cover which types of stress are toxic, how to be a more
responsible drinker, how much caffeine is too much, how
to create healthy pleasure, how faith can be a weapon,
how to calculate your positivity ratio, how anger revital-
izes a sluggish brain, and more.

oes your anger sound like this?
“Get off my back, dammit!”
“You’d better back off — I’ve had all I can take!”
“Give me a break for God’s sake! How much crap do you think I can take?”
“I’m not going to tell you again — leave me alone!”
If so, your problem isn’t anger — your problem is stress. You either have too
much stress or the wrong kinds of stress, but either way, you’re stressed.
Anger is just your way of expressing it. Some people withdraw and get quiet
under fire; others lash out. Unfortunately, neither strategy works well and
both strategies end up endangering your health (see how in Chapter 3).
This chapter shows you what to do when your plate gets too full and you see
the warning signs of impending anger. I tell you how to identify those stress
carriers who, if you weren’t feeling irritated before you encountered them,
you will afterward. I tell you how to avoid stress burnout and why it’s the
little hassles of everyday life that do you the most harm. And, most impor-
tant, I show you how to thrive under stress — how to be a hardy personality.
It’s easier than you think!

Distinguishing Stress from Strain
Believe it or not, your great-grandparents didn’t get stressed out. Well, maybe
they felt stress, but they didn’t call it that. Stress and strain are engineering
terms that were first applied to human beings in the 1930s.
Stress is a normal part of daily life. It’s what fuels that built-in fight-or-flight
response that you have for help in defending yourself against things —
people, circumstances, events — that threaten your survival. Stress isn’t a
choice — it’s a gift (even though it doesn’t feel like one!).
Here are some of the changes that occur in your body every time you feel
stressed:
 Your pupils dilate.
 Your blood sugar rises.
 Your blood pressure increases.
 Your blood clots faster.
 The muscles throughout your body tighten.
 You breathe more rapidly.
 Your heart rate increases.
 Your pituitary gland is activated.
 Your hypothalamus gland is activated.
 Adrenaline flows freely.
 Your palms become sweaty.
 Your blood cortisol level rises. (Cortisol is a stress hormone that
enhances and prolongs your body’s fight-or-flight reaction.)
 Fat is released into your bloodstream.
 Your liver converts fat into cholesterol.
Strain, on the other hand, is what happens to your body when you become
overstressed — that is, when you experience too much of a good thing. Think
of a bridge (I told you this comes from engineering!) that has cars constantly
crossing it year after year. Because of their weight, the cars stress the bridge.
The more cars that pass over, the greater the stress. Now, imagine that after a
few years, cracks begin to appear under the bridge — small at first, but larger
as time goes on. These cracks threaten the integrity of the bridge. The cracks
represent the strain that inevitably occurs from too much stress. The bridge
is you — your body, your health.
184
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

Now imagine the bridge creaking and groaning as it begins to show signs of
strain. You can see the role that anger plays in communicating to the world
just how much strain you’re under. Anger is simply your way of creaking
(showing your irritation) and groaning (flying into a rage).
Staying Away from Stress Carriers
Do you know someone who, when he walks into the room, seems to disrupt
everything around him? Before that person arrived, people were in a good
mood, laughing, talking, getting their work done, enjoying life — and this
person changed all that. The laughter stopped, moods changed, and tension
suddenly permeated the air. That lovely person is a stress carrier.
You can tell a stress carrier by the person’s:
 Tone of voice (rapid, pressured, and grating)
 Body posture (it communicates aggression [for example, hands waving]
or defensiveness [for example, arms crossed in front of chest])
 Tense facial expression (clenched jaw, frown, or narrowing around 
the eyes)
 Fist clenching
 Use of obscenities
 Tendency to talk over other people in a conversation
 Jarring laugh
 Fixed, angry opinions
 Rapid eye-blinks
185
Chapter 14: Managing Stress
My fuse is getting shorter
People ask me all the time: “I’ve always had a
short fuse, but it seems to be getting shorter all
the time. Why is that?” In most cases, the
answer is that they’re experiencing more and
more strain as they struggle through life, first
with one thing and then another. As the stresses
accumulate, so does the strain. Life begins 
to weigh heavily on them. Their tolerance
decreases and their reactivity increases, as
indicated by the length of their fuse. Bear in
mind, this doesn’t happen under conditions of
normal stress — only when stress becomes
extreme.

 Sighing
 Dark circles under the eyes
 Head-nodding
 Excessive perspiration
 Finger tapping
 Jerky body movements
 Tendency to walk fast
 Tendency to eat fast
 Tendency to frequently check what time it is
 Tendency to hurry up the speech of others by interjecting comments
such as “Yeah,” “Uh-huh,” “Right,” and “I know.”
 Talking or listening to you while the person’s eyes continually scan the
room
Stay away from stress carriers as much as you can. Their stress is 
contagious — if you’re around them very long, you’ll feel stressed, too. If a
stress carrier’s stress spills over into anger, guess what will happen to you?
You’ll find yourself angry — and you won’t know why.
You may be a stress carrier yourself. Check out the list in this section, and
see if you have any of those stress-carrier characteristics. If you’re really
brave, ask someone who knows you well to examine the list and tell you what
he thinks. You may not be the best judge of your true self.
Identifying the Sources of Your Stress
Stressors — those people, events, and circumstances that cause you stress —
come in all sorts of sizes and shapes. Some are physical (noise, pollution),
some social (noisy neighbors, meddling in-laws), some emotional (death of a
loved one), some legal (divorce), some financial (bankruptcy), and so on.

Limit your exposure
I used to have a business partner who was a
big-time stress carrier. Everywhere he went, he
left a wake of uneasiness, hostility, unhappi-
ness, and worry. The tension finally got to the
point where the other partners and I consulted
with our lawyer about what to do with our busi-
ness. His counsel was simple: Limit your expo-
sure to the guy. “How do we do that,” we
asked? Dissolve the partnership. So, we did.

Some are even positive — getting a new job, getting married, graduating from
college — and they excite your nervous system no less than the negative
experiences do.
Psychologists tend to group stressors into two primary categories: minor irri-
tants (or hassles) and major, critical life events.
Minor day-to-day stressors that you’re likely to experience and that can even-
tually set the stage for anger include the following:
 Hurrying to meet a deadline
 Being interrupted while talking
 Finding that someone has borrowed something without asking your 
permission
 Being disturbed while taking a nap
 Seeing that someone has cut ahead of you in line
 Driving in heavy traffic
 Misplacing something important
 Caring for a sick child
 Having unexpected company
 Having to deal with car repairs
 Developing a cold sore
 Seeing that a bird has unloaded on your brand-new car
 Having an appointment with someone who shows up late
 Hearing a rude remark directed at you
 Having too much time on your hands (You read that right: People with
too much time on their hands get bored. Scientists call it underutiliza-
tion when it occurs in the workplace, and I think the same is true for
teenagers stuck at home. It inevitably causes problems of one kind or
another if it persists.)
Major stressors — which can have a much more significant impact on your
life — include the following:
 Being fired from your job
 Being sentenced to jail
 Having a chronic or life-threatening illness
 Experiencing the death of a close friend
 Having the bank foreclose on your home loan
 Separating from your spouse
187
Chapter 14: Managing Stress

 Getting pregnant
 Your children leaving home
 Moving
 Winning the lottery
 Losing your job
 Starting a new job
 Being promoted at work
Which type of stressors — minor or major — would you guess are the most
unhealthy? If you’re like most people, you said the major ones. But the reality
is that you’re much more likely to be undone by the small things in life. Why?
Precisely because they are small and they occur on a daily basis. People see
minor stressors as so universal (“Hey, that’s just part of life, right?”) that they
don’t take them seriously — and that’s a mistake! The good news about major
stressors — the ones that potentially affect your life in some critical way — is
that they don’t occur that frequently and you tend to marshal all of your
resources to effectively deal with them. In other words, you take the major
stressors more seriously, so they’re far less harmful.
Knowing Which Types of Stress Are Toxic
Each person has a finite carrying capacity for stress — that is, the amount of
stress she can accommodate without showing signs of strain. Even the most
resilient people can find themselves overloaded from time to time. That’s
when you need to take stock of what’s going on around you and work to
restore some semblance of balance in your life (see Chapter 16).

My God, what a score!
There’s a psychological test that measures the
amount of major stress a person has been
under for the past year. It lists 42 different
stresses and gives each one a score or impact
value. The total score, it turns out, is a fairly
good predictor of future illness — everything
from a common cold to a heart attack. The
cutoff score for toxic stress is 300. Anything less
than that is probably not going to compromise
your health. I gave it to a client who came in
saying, “I’m not sure why I’m here, but I just
don’t feel good.” Her score was 2,292 — unbe-
lievable! Oh, and by the way, she was a very
angry woman.

Stress can become an addiction. If you can’t remember the last time you
didn’t feel overwhelmed by the demands of your day; if you enjoy the adrena-
line rush or high that goes along with meeting one challenge after another; 
if you seem to invite and sometimes create stress where there is none; and, if
you find yourself restless and bored when things are too quiet, consider
yourself a stress addict.
If you’re a stress addict, you need to start weaning yourself off stress, with
small steps. You can start by setting aside one otherwise busy evening a
week to just hang out with a close friend who isn’t competitive and who 
doesn’t require a lot of conversation. Try taking off your watch in the
evenings and for portions of your weekend — say, Saturday afternoon from
noon until 6 p.m. (and work up to longer periods over time). Sign up for a
yoga class or spend a few minutes in a Jacuzzi three or four times a week.
Some types of stresses — regardless of their magnitude — are more poiso-
nous to your life than others. I like to refer to these as the Four Deadly C’s.
Cumulative stress
Cumulative stress is stress that — you guessed it! — accumulates over time.
It’s one thing adding to another, and another, and another, until you can’t take
any more.
That’s how Henry feels. Recently retired, Henry thought he was beginning to
live out his golden years. He had a secure income and a paid-for home, and
both he and his wife were in good health — or so it seemed. Now Henry is
concerned. His wife of many years is starting to forget where she puts things,
occasionally gets disoriented, is unable to master simple tasks, and has to
have things repeated over and over so she won’t forget. Henry told her a
week ago, for example, that he would be out one evening at a volunteer meet-
ing. The very next morning, she asked, “When is it that you’ll be out for the
evening?” Henry told her again, giving her the benefit of the doubt. The next
morning, she again asked, “And when is it that you’re going to that meeting?”
Now clearly frustrated , Henry told her for the third time. Same thing again
the next day. Finally, after six consecutive days of having to repeat himself,
Henry finally erupted in a state of rage. He yelled, she ran to her room in
tears, and both were left feeling bad afterward. Henry wasn’t stressed
because his wife asked when his meeting was — he was stressed because she
kept asking over and over. One or two times, fine; six times, no.
Chronic stress
Have you ever found yourself confronted with a stress that just won’t go
away? You wake up to it every morning and go to bed with it every night.
That’s chronic stress — it’s with you all the time. Many of my clients deal with
189
Chapter 14: Managing Stress

chronic stress in the form of enduring back pain. Injured on the job in their
middle years, they’re sentenced to a life of unremitting pain that can’t be fixed
by the medical profession. No wonder they stay in such an irritable state and
are quick to get angry when confronted with any little problem that arises!
Other examples of chronic stress include
 Debt
 Poverty
 Noisy neighbors
 Obesity
 A dead-end job
 Domestic violence
 An unreliable car
 Living in a high-crime area
Catastrophic stress
Events such as terrorist attacks, tsunamis, or hurricanes devastate people —
particularly if you’re one of those most immediately affected. They represent
the most horrific, life-altering kind of stress — catastrophic stress. Some
people never recover from catastrophic stress (for example, Vietnam veter-
ans who almost 50 years later are still reliving that war as part of a Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder); those who do recover from catastrophic stress
usually take a long time to heal.
Control stress
Human beings love to control things. People feel safer, stronger, and more
competent when they have a handle on their lives. Problem is, life doesn’t
always afford us that opportunity.
Take Michelle, for instance. She’s a bright young woman, who had a great head
start on a promising career in marketing before the corporation she worked
for went into major reorganization. Michelle found herself with no immediate
superior, a doubled workload (with no additional compensation), and too few
resources to meet the demands of her job. Worst of all, she no longer had time
to devote to the activities she did best. Normally, Michelle was an energetic,
positive, dynamic personality, but since her company’s reorganization, she
found herself exhausted all the time, dreading going to work, irritable, and suf-
fering from migraine headaches and stomach pains. Michelle’s life was out of
her control, and she was experiencing control stress.

Avoiding Burnout
Burnout is a form of strain that inevitably results from prolonged, intense, and
unresolved stress. The dictionary defines burnout as “the point at which mis-
sile fuel is burned up and the missile enters free flight.” Guess who the mis-
sile is? You. The fuel — that’s your physical and psychological energy. And,
the free flight — that’s all the disorganized, erratic, and inefficient behavior
that you find yourself engaging in lately.
The best way to avoid burnout is to see it coming. How many of the following
symptoms do you have? If the answer is five or more, you’re well on your way
to burnout.
 Chronic fatigue
 Loss of appetite
 Insomnia
 Headaches
 Heartburn, acid stomach, or indigestion
 Anxiety
 Depression
 Cynicism
 Hopelessness
 Feeling bored and unmotivated
 Abusing alcohol
191
Chapter 14: Managing Stress
The love of your life
Not all mental health professionals would
agree, but I believe that the death of the love of
your life is a catastrophic loss, particularly if
you’ve been together for 20 years or more.
Those kinds of strong attachments, once
broken, cause great personal pain.
Grief is not something that always comes
quickly or ends quickly. For example, men wid-
owed after a long and loving marriage are most
vulnerable to stress-related illness (heart
attack) between 6 and 12 months after the loss
of their wives. Women, on the other hand,
appear fine for the first two years, before finally
showing signs of illness that can be traced back
to the death of their husbands.
Grief over the loss of a loved one is one type of
stress where professional counseling or a com-
munity support group can make a big difference
in alleviating suffering. Reach out and get some
help after you suffer such a loss — even if you
don’t feel like you need it.

 Missing work
 Being accident-prone
 Suicidal thoughts
 Hostility and resentment
 Agitation
 Telling sick jokes
 Spontaneously crying
 Feeling up one minute, down the next
 Sudden bursts of temper
 Loss of passion for your work or life in general
 Feeling just as tired on Monday morning as you did on Friday night
 Poor concentration
 Confusion about routine things both at work and at home
Here’s a bit of irony: The people most likely to burn out in any walk of life are
the ones most likely to succeed — people who are most passionate about
their work, are most liked by superiors and co-workers, are seen as being the
friendliest, most energetic, most motivated, most conscientious, most confi-
dent, most assertive.
This book offers several strategies that can help to buffer you from the full
brunt of the stresses you’re currently under, including: shifting to a Type B
personality (Chapter 10); moderating your use of stimulants (Chapter 15);
relying on friends and co-workers for support (Chapter 16); getting enough
sleep (Chapter 17); and participating in spiritual activities (Chapter 18).
But there are other things you can do as well. Find a solution to your chronic
stress. For instance, Michelle (see the “Control stress” section, earlier in this
chapter) needs a new job. She’s fighting a no-win battle. All she can conceiv-
ably do is continue to lose ground, spinning her wheels but getting nowhere.
Taking stress breaks throughout the day also helps. Stress breaks don’t typi-
cally solve the problem, but they do eliminate the chronic aspects of stress.
I’m amazed at how few people I know who steal a few minutes here and there
for themselves just to relax away some of the built-up tension. I can hear the
Type A’s yelling, “But, I don’t have time to relax!” The answer: Make time.
If you want to avoid burnout, try to be more realistic about what you can
expect from the situation you find yourself in as well as your own abilities.
Burnout usually occurs when there’s too big a discrepancy between those
two. Forget how things “should” be and deal with them as they really are. And
quit demanding more of yourself than is reasonable. Believe me, whatever
your job is, it’s not to save the world (or the company you work for) single-
handedly. Try backing off a little and setting some limits to protect yourself.

Discovering How to Be Hardy
My aunt Lillian, bless her heart, was a hardy soul. She grew up in an orphan-
age after her parents both died suddenly in a flu epidemic. Vivacious and ath-
letic, she was almost killed in a head-on collision with a drunk driver in her
early 20s — an accident that left her with a mangled knee and stiff leg for the
remainder of her life. An attractive woman, she had few suitors due to her
injury, and she ended up marrying a much older man. She wanted children
but couldn’t have any, so she became the patron aunt of a host of nieces and
nephews — including myself. She worked full time for all of her adult life,
long before women were liberated from the confines of home. She and her
husband managed a modest living, although money was always a concern.
Following a severe stroke, she spent the last ten years of her life in a nursing
home, paralyzed on one side of her body and strapped to a wheelchair. She
died quietly in her sleep at age 88.
The remarkable thing was that Lillian never complained about life being
unfair or about her physical limitations. She refused to adopt the role of a dis-
abled individual. To my recollection, she never — not once — displayed any
anger toward anyone, even if the person deserved it. Instead, she was leg-
endary for her forbearance, her good humor, her forgiving ways, and her opti-
mistic, anything-is-possible outlook.
Psychologist Salvadore Maddi made a career studying people like my aunt,
who he described as having a hardy personality. According to Maddi, hardi-
ness was an amalgam of three separate traits: control over our own lives,
commitment to the things and people that matter to us, and our ability to
face a challenge with a positive attitude. These traits, when combined, cut a
highly stressed person’s likelihood of becoming physically ill by half — even
more when combined with other healthy behaviors like regular exercise.
193
Chapter 14: Managing Stress
The Dutch experience
I was fortunate to spend a year as a guest pro-
fessor at the University of Nijmegen in the
Netherlands toward the end of my academic
career. One of my favorite Dutch experiences
was a ritual that occurred every single day in
the psychology office where I worked. Midway
through the morning, everyone — and I mean
everyone — put down whatever important
piece of work they were engrossed in and gath-
ered for coffee and sweets in a communal area.
Secretaries, faculty, students, administrators —
everyone was present. We spent about 20 min-
utes talking about anything other than psychol-
ogy. How absolutely civilized — how absolutely
un-American!

Hardy personalities are more likely to utilize transformational coping strategies
(transforming a situation into an opportunity for personal growth and soci-
etal benefit) when faced with stress. They’re also less likely to try to deny,
avoid, or escape the difficulties at hand. In older people, being hardy also
reduces the risk of stress-related illness — colds, flu, headaches, upset stom-
ach, and nervousness.
People who lack hardiness tend to feel alienated from the world around them.
They don’t have the support and feeling of being socially connected that
their hardy counterparts enjoy — that connectedness goes a long way
toward minimizing the impact of stress in their daily lives. Because their lives
are devoid of value and purpose, they have no real incentive to solve their
problems — it’s just easier to be mad.
There appears to be no gene for hardiness — it’s a style of dealing with
stressful life circumstances that is a byproduct of life experience. In other
words, it’s learned — and if you haven’t learned it already, it’s not too late!
Be the master of your own destiny
In order to have the kind of hardy personality that’ll help you cope with
stress, you need to believe in your own ability to deal with adversity. Call it
self-esteem, self-confidence, self-efficacy — call it whatever you want — it
comes down to being the master of your own destiny.
What do you do when you’re on the wrong end of some major stress? Do you
run and hide, avoiding even thinking about the problem or how you can
resolve it? Do you distract yourself with a cigarette, a beer, or some serious
shopping at the local mall? Or, like my Aunt Lillian, do you ask yourself “What
can I do to make things better for myself?” and then act accordingly. If you’re
like Lillian, you have one of the three critical elements of a hardy personality —
a sense of internal control.
Practice thinking like a hardy personality by repeating to yourself statements
such as the following:
 People get the respect they deserve in life.
 Good grades in school are no accident — they’re the result of hard work.
 Luck has little or no effect on how my life turns out.
 Capable people become leaders because they take advantage of oppor-
tunities that come their way.
 What happens to me is my own doing.
 With enough effort, voters can wipe out political corruption.
194
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

 I can fight city hall!
 People only take advantage of me if I let them.
Be a player, not a spectator
Hardy people have a deep sense of involvement and purpose in their lives —
the commitment component of a hardy personality. In the game of life, you
have to decide whether you want to be a player or spectator.
While non-hardy folks are waiting idly by for life to improve (that is, become
less stressful), hardy personalities do the following:
 Vote at all levels of government — local, state, federal
 Join civic groups that have a mission to help people
 Run marathons
 Beautify highways
 Volunteer for community service
 Tackle projects at work that nobody else wants
 Find meaning in the smallest things
 Have a willingness to make mistakes in order to develop new skills
 Assume leadership positions
 Pray actively for themselves and others
 Take classes to better themselves (or just for the fun of it!)
 Become totally involved in family activities
195
Chapter 14: Managing Stress
To choose or not to choose
Maybe you like to choose your own destiny. You
want to decide how best to deal with problems,
conflicts, challenges, and stresses. Good for
you! You are what psychologists call a self-
directed personality. The more options you
allow yourself (or others allow you), the better.
But, believe it or not, not everyone wants
choice. In fact, you might get confused, upset,
or paralyzed with indecision if you’re forced to
decide how best to cope with some major life
stress. You are an other-directed personality —
which means you need help from outside
sources (family, professionals) to decide what
you should do. So, ask!

 Get regular health checkups
 Have strong political opinions
 Seek out new relationships
 Find something interesting in everyone they meet
Transform catastrophes into challenges
Life is forever changing. Sometimes these changes are in your favor; other
times they’re not. Either way, they’re stressful. What matters is whether you
see these changes as catastrophes or challenges. People respond actively to
a challenge, and retreat from catastrophes.
Two people unexpectedly lose their jobs. One thinks of this as the end of the
world as he knows it. He goes home, gets drunk, loses his temper with his
family, and spends the next two weeks sleeping and watching TV. The other
man tells himself, “Great, now I can look for an opportunity in something that
has more security and pays better,” and then he develops a plan (with his
family’s support) for what to do next.
When you’re hit with some major stress in your life, which person are you?
The next time you have to deal with a major stress, and you start thinking it’s
the end of the world and wanting to retreat, try taking these steps:
1. Clearly define the problem.
Did you lose your job? Did your youngest just leave home, leaving you
with an empty nest? Is your spouse gravely ill?
2. Ask yourself: What is the challenge?
If you’ve lost your job, you have to go find another one. If your house is
soon to be empty of children, you’ll have to find other things you’re pas-
sionate about. If a loved one has just been diagnosed with a fatal dis-
ease, you’ll have to prepare to grieve over that loss and to handle life
more on your own in the future.
3. Determine whether you have enough support to meet the challenge.
Support is all-important in dealing with major challenges in life. Figure
out how much support you have on your side. Ask yourself: “Who can I
count on to help?”, “ How can they help — give moral support, lend a
hand, tell me I’m okay?”, “Is their support up close and personal or long-
distance?”, and “Do I need to find new sources of support — for exam-
ple, legal assistance or counseling?”
4. Develop an action plan.
196
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

Ask yourself: “What specific steps do I need to take to meet this chal-
lenge?”, “Where do I start?”, “Where do I want to end up — what’s my
goal?”, “How will I know when I’ve met the challenge?” Set some time-
lines for each of the individual steps. Reward yourself along the way as
you complete each step. Celebrate when you’ve completely met the
challenge — and your life becomes less stressful.
These steps work whether you’ve experienced a true catastrophe (a hurri-
cane has destroyed everything you own, your family has died in a plane
crash) or you’re facing something more common. What matters isn’t whether
the event was a true catastrophe — what matters is that is feels like a cata-
strophe to you, and you can transform the catastrophe into a challenge. The
more traumatic the event, the more help you’ll need in facing the challenge.
But you can get through it, no matter what it is.
Coping with Stress: What 
Works and What Doesn’t
Everything you do to get through the day — every thought, every deed — is
an act of coping with stress. Going to work, getting drunk, paying off debts,
laughing, crying — all are acts of coping. Some ways of coping with stress are
aimed directly at the source of stress; other ways of coping have more to do
with the strain that is produced by this stress.
Here are some examples of coping strategies that feel good and provide some
temporary relief from stress, but that don’t resolve the problems that do you
the most harm:
 Avoiding: Avoidance basically means dealing with stress by not dealing
with it (for example, by eating, smoking, or drinking alcohol).
 Blaming: If you cope with your stress by assigning blame, you either
point the finger at other people, or you beat up on yourself.
197
Chapter 14: Managing Stress
Laughter eases the pain
Before being subjected to pressure-induced
pain in an experimental setting, men and
women were allowed to listen to one of three
audio tapes — one that made them laugh, one
that relaxed them, and one that was on an edu-
cational topic. Pain tolerance, it turns out, was
greatest in those who shared a good laugh. The
next time you’re feeling pained (challenged) by
some stressful event or circumstance, find
someone or something to make you laugh — it’s
good medicine!

 Wishing: Some people sit around and try to imagine their problems away.
 Acting on impulse: When in doubt, some people shoot from the hip.
They don’t think — they just act.
Here are some effective coping strategies for dealing with stress:
 Try to find out more about the situation.
 Talk with a spouse, relative, or friend about what’s bothering you.
 Take things one step at a time.
 Pray for guidance or strength.
 Draw on past experiences of a similar nature.
 Seek professional assistance (from a doctor, lawyer, or clergy member).
 Try to see the positive side.
 Focus on the problem, not your emotional reaction.
 Be patient — don’t look for the quick fix.
 Persist — keep trying no matter how long it takes to reach a solution.
 Accept feelings of uncertainty while you work toward a solution.
 Develop several options for problem solving.
 Keep communication lines open.
 Be willing to compromise.
 Be optimistic.

The happiest time of life
As I write this chapter, I just finished seeing a
70-year-old client who is the happiest he’s ever
been in his life. He told me about a number of
recent stresses he’s dealing with — financial
problems with his son, a meddlesome sister-in-
law, chronic back and leg pain — all without
getting angry.
What is noteworthy here is the fact that this
man spent his entire adolescent and adult life
getting angry at every problem that came his
way. If the cows got out of the fence, he got
angry. If his dog was barking, he got angry. If his
wife wanted him to do something and he was
tired, he got angry. When his kids didn’t always
obey him, he got angry. If there was a problem
at work, he got angry.
But, at age 60, he decided to change all that.
Now, he can see that he doesn’t need anger to
cope with stress — and, he never did! He just
thought he did.

In This Chapter
 Understanding how “legal” substances can affect your anger
 Drawing the line on substance use: how much is too much
 Becoming a more responsible consumer
 Avoiding a hangover
F
or all my angry clients, I have three prescriptions:
 Stop smoking.
 Lay off the caffeine.
 Cut back on alcohol.
Otherwise, you’re only fueling the fire.
In this chapter, I show you how to effectively manage anger by creating a less
anger-friendly internal environment — the environment within your body. I
show you how common chemical substances such as nicotine, caffeine, and
alcohol affect your body (and your anger). And I help you understand the
connection between impulsivity, anger, and substance abuse.
Just Because It’s Legal Doesn’t 
Make It Healthy
Most people — myself included — confuse issues of legality with that of
health. If something is legal, we tell ourselves it can’t harm us. But common
sense tells us otherwise.

For example, cigarettes are legal, but everyone knows that nicotine is an
addictive drug and that smoking leads to the untimely death of millions of
people. Alcohol is legal, but when it’s used in excess, it contributes to every-
thing from domestic abuse and fatal traffic accidents, to heart attacks and
liver disease. And caffeine — perhaps the most popular common-use drug of
all — is certainly legal, but it interferes with brain chemicals that promote
good sleep (see Chapter 17), raises blood pressure, and increases the risk for
miscarriage, stillbirth, and low-birth weight babies in pregnant women.
One big problem, I think, is that most people don’t think of common-use
chemicals as “real” drugs — certainly not in the same way they think of hero-
ine, cocaine, amphetamines, and marijuana. Maybe you consider them “safe”
drugs that have no ill effects on your health and well being. Most people
don’t really know the connection between what I call the “chemistry of every-
day life” and emotions such as anger.
These so-called “harmless” chemicals, as it turns out, can lower your thresh-
old for anger arousal in a number of ways:
 Caffeine and nicotine stimulate the central nervous system, making it
more reactive to environmental provocation. Translation: If your ner-
vous system is ramped up, you’ll have a harder time staying calm when
that guy on the freeway cuts you off.

Raise your hand if you use drugs
Some years ago — when I still had school-age
children — I was asked to address a group of
middle-school parents about why kids take
drugs. To my great surprise, the auditorium was
filled to capacity, full of moms and dads hoping
to hear something that would reassure them
that drugs would never be a problem in their
families.
To start what I hoped would be a lively, back-
and-forth discussion, I asked the parents to
raise their hands if they were drug users.
Needless to say, not one person raised his
hand. In fact, most people had a rather startled
look on their faces.
Then I asked how many had smoked a cigarette
that day. Lots of hands went up. Next, I asked
how many had had a cup of coffee, tea, or some
type of soft drink. Almost everyone’s hand went
up. Lastly, I asked how many had had some
alcohol. Some more hands went up.
I reminded them that caffeine, alcohol, and
nicotine are all drugs — legal drugs but drugs
nevertheless.
Then I asked my original question — How many
of you are drug users? — and every hand in the
auditorium was raised. Why this exercise?
Because illegal drug use among children is
highly influenced by the drug use — legal or 
illegal — of their parents and by the fact that
our culture sanctions the use of drugs as an
integral part of what’s called the “good life.”

 Alcohol, even in small quantities, can cloud or exaggerate a person’s
perceptions, causing an intoxicated person to misread the actions and
intentions of others. Translation: If you’ve had too much to drink, you
may think your girlfriend is flirting with that bartender when she’s really
just asking where the bathroom is.
 Alcohol tends to make a person less inhibited (emotionally and behav-
iorally), allowing a person to feel and act in ways he wouldn’t if he
were sober. Translation: When you’re sloshed, you’re much more likely
to lash out or throw a punch at someone you’re upset with. (Bars have
bouncers for a reason.)
 Caffeine and alcohol, if used excessively, disrupt sleep patterns and
lead to increased irritability (see Chapter 17). Translation: All that
coffee may help you stay up late cramming for a final exam, and the alco-
hol you drink to celebrate when finals are over, may feel good at the
time, but there’s a reason you’re tired the next morning.
 Alcohol can affect a person’s mood, especially in terms of depression,
which in turn affects emotions — such as sadness and anger (more
about this in Chapter 18). Translation: If you’ve ever ended up crying
into your beer stein only moments after you were toasting your friends,
it may be because the alcohol has wreaked havoc with your mood.

Self-medicating anger
Margo, a 43-year-old divorcee, has struggled
with a drinking problem and intermittent depres-
sion for years. Every time she thinks she has
loosened the grip that alcohol has on her life,
something upsets her and she instantly falls off
the proverbial wagon.
“I was doing fine — no alcohol for months —
and then my boyfriend really hurt my feelings
over the weekend. I’m so depressed,” she said
crying. “Now all I can think of now is getting
drunk.”
Margo’s core problem is suppressed anger.
She’s furious at her boyfriend — she says he’s
insensitive, uncaring, and unsupportive — but
she feels hurt instead. Alcohol — her drug of
choice — is her way of medicating the emotional
pain she feels. Its appeal, of course, is its anes-
thetic quality. Where Margo needs help is in
recognizing and dealing with her deep-seated,
unexpressed anger, not only toward her current
boyfriend but also to all those men in her life
(and there have been many!) who have similarly
mistreated her. Until she accomplishes that,
Margo has no chance of remaining sober for
any significant length of time.

How Much Is Too Much?
When it comes to common-use chemicals like caffeine and alcohol, the less
the better. In moderation, these substances have no affect on your emotional
state — but when used to excess they do. The trick is to know when enough
is enough. What’s a safe dose of caffeine? What constitutes responsible drink-
ing? (For more on smoking, see “Eliminating Your Favorite Cigarette,” later in
this chapter — if you figured I would tell you to quit, you’re right.)
On average, adult human beings can tolerate approximately 250 mg of caf-
feine daily without experiencing adverse physical, emotional, and behavioral
consequences. Table 15-1 illustrates some common sources of caffeine and
the concentration levels of each:
Table 15-1
Sources of Caffeine
Source
Amount of Caffeine
Brewed coffee, 8 ounces
85 mg
Instant coffee, 8 ounces
60 mg
Decaffeinated coffee, 8 ounces
3 mg
Brewed tea, 8 ounces
50 mg
Instant tea, 8 ounces
30 mg
Soft drink, 12 ounces
32–65 mg
Cocoa, 8 ounces
6–142 mg
Note: Prescription and over-the-counter medications may contain caffeine as well. Read the label
or check with your pharmacist to find out how much caffeine your medications contain.
The length of time caffeine remains active in the nervous system is between
three and seven hours. Because of its lingering effects, concentrations can
build up to toxic levels throughout the course of the day.
Caffeine should come with a warning label — evidence suggests that it can
become addictive even at low dosages. If you’re a heavy user, you can expect
physical withdrawal symptoms — headaches, fatigue, irritability — when you
lay off the caffeine. If you’re thinking, “Oh come on, how bad can the conse-
quences of too much caffeine really be?”, consider the following list of poten-
tial side effects:
 Tachycardia (an abnormally fast heartbeat)
 Disturbances in cardiac rhythm
202
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

 Elevated blood pressure
 Muscle contractions
 Rapid respiration (breathing rate)
 Drowsiness
 Increased anxiety
 Restlessness
 Tremors
 Flushing
 Insomnia
 Depression
 Irritability
 Lightheadedness
 Headaches
 Stomach pain
 Frequent urination
 Indigestion
 Hives
 Burning feet syndrome (it is what it sounds like — your feet ache and
feel like they’re burning)
The rules of safe, responsible alcohol consumption are simple:
 Don’t have more than two alcoholic drinks per day (one if you’re
female).
 Don’t consume more than four alcoholic drinks at one sitting (three if
you’re female).
Note: By one drink, I mean 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 11⁄2 ounces
of hard liquor.
If you stay within these guidelines, your alcohol consumption shouldn’t have
a negative effect. Responsible drinking does not mean abstinence — in fact,
medical science has suggested that people who consume up to 3 ounces of
alcohol daily enjoy better health over a lifetime and live longer than teeto-
talers, presumably because of its relaxation effects. But drinking in modera-
tion is not always easy — as many people can attest!

Chapter 15: Managing Your Chemistry

Keeping Track of Your Substance Use
There are three good reasons for keeping track of your daily use of chemicals
such as nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol:
 You may not have the faintest idea of precisely how much you ingest on
a regular basis, which means you’re unaware of the potentially influen-
tial role such substances play in your emotional life.
 Simply paying closer attention to your substance use patterns can be an
effective way to cut back. (Psychologists call this the self-monitoring
effect.)
 It helps you begin to appreciate how the substances you take in may be
linked to the likelihood of your losing your temper.
Keep a daily record of your all the cigarettes you smoke, as well as all the caf-
feine and alcohol you consume, for one week. Be sure to include all three. In
addition to noting the time of day you engaged in each type of behavior, also
indicate whether you were irritated, angry, or in a rage before or after you
smoked a cigarette, drank a cup of coffee, or had a beer. Table 15-2 illustrates
a hypothetical record of one person’s daily use:

Type A’s drink more
Individuals with a Type A personality (see
Chapter 10) tend to drink alcohol more fre-
quently than their Type B counterparts. Roughly
half of Type A’s report consuming alcohol
“nearly every day” or “every day.” One possible
explanation for this lies in the fact that Type A’s
have more difficulty relaxing than Type B’s, and
Type A’s use alcohol to help them relax. A
second explanation has to do with the fact that
Type A’s tend to be more extroverted and out-
going and find themselves in social situations
where drinking is not only possible, but
expected. My own theory is that their alcohol
consumption pattern is just another part of their
overall “aggressive” style of interacting with
the environment.

Two things are apparent from this record:
 The person uses caffeine to self-medicate anger — that is, when she’s
angry, she usually has a cigarette, a cup of coffee, or a beer.
 Her approach appears to work. She’s usually less angry or completely
anger-free immediately afterward.
The problem is that appearances can be deceiving. This diary suggests that
self-medicating anger works in the short run, but that doesn’t necessarily
mean that it works in the long run. These substances may provide an immedi-
ate benefit to you when you’re angry, but over time you may find yourself
needing more alcohol, more cigarettes, and more caffeine to have the same
effect. First you’re hooked on anger, and then you become hooked on sub-
stances. In addition, caffeine and nicotine are stimulants that have the capac-
ity to overstimulate your nervous system, thus making it easier for you to get
angry the next time you get frustrated or provoked. In effect, you end up in a
vicious cycle where anger leads to chemicals and chemicals lead to anger.
205
Chapter 15: Managing Your Chemistry
Why do I have a hangover?
How bad your head hurts the next morning may,
to a large extent, be a function of just how angry
you were when you were drinking the night
before. My friend and colleague Dr. Ernest
Harburg at the University of Michigan found that
“angry drinkers” have far more hangover symp-
toms — stomach discomfort, tremors, diarrhea,
anxiety — than “non-angry drinkers” do. The
difference was particularly pronounced for
men, who were twice as likely to fit the profile of
the angry drinker. Even more fascinating was
the fact that the amount of alcohol they con-
sumed made little difference. Bottom line: Anger
and alcohol are not a good mix! If you’re angry,
don’t drink; if you drink, be cool.

Eliminating Your Favorite Cigarette
The best way to stop (or cut back on) smoking is to start by eliminating your
favorite cigarette of the day. For most people, this is the after-dinner ciga-
rette. The second-most-favorite cigarette is the one “first thing in the morn-
ing.” (Interestingly, the latter is more typical of smokers who are nicotine
addicted.)
Smoking is a habit (a predictable behavior that is conditioned to repeat itself
without any conscious, deliberate thought or intent on the part of the
smoker). Smokers light up basically because they have the urge to do so and
that urge is stronger at certain times of the day than others. The logic here is
simple: If you can eliminate the strongest urge in your day, it will make all the
other weaker urges throughout the day easier to overcome.
After you decide which is your favorite cigarette of the day, develop a plan of
action for outlasting the urge. As part of your plan, you may want to:
 Spend the time you normally allocate to smoking a cigarette on some
alternative form of pleasure. Despite its health hazards, there is no
denying that smokers derive pleasure from ingesting nicotine. So, what
you’re looking for here is a substitute.
 Talk yourself through the urge. My favorite mantra is “This too shall
pass.” The stress-inoculation technique in Chapter 22 will come in handy.
 Rely on a higher power to help you find the strength to resist the urge
to smoke. Do you have sufficient faith in yourself to overcome the urge
to smoke?
 Lie back, close your eyes, and engage in some positive imagery. Give you
mind something to do other than focus on smoking a cigarette. Picture
yourself doing something you enjoy where you typically don’t smoke.
 Have a piece of hard candy rather than a cigarette. This strategy
works with anger, why not smoking? (See Chapter 4 for details.)
 Take a minute for some journaling. This is a perfect time to spend a
minute or two — as long as it takes for the urge to pass — to write down
how you’re feeling at the moment. It’s okay to confess that you miss
having a cigarette!
The smokers who are the most successful in quitting (or cutting back) are
those who devise their own self-help program. So, if you’re committed to this
as part of your overall anger-management program, then the odds are in your
favor. Don’t be afraid to be creative! Think outside the box — you never know
what might work.
206
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

Counting Your Caffeine
Controlling caffeine is all about numbers. The human body can absorb and
make use of 250 mg of caffeine a day. All you want to do here is get your con-
sumption — using the numbers in Table 15-1 (earlier in this chapter) — down
to or 250 mg or less. Try the following:
 Switch from coffee to tea as your beverage of choice. (Both have 
caffeine, but tea has less.)
 Alternating between caffeinated and decaf coffee.
 Try drinking “half-and-half” coffee — half caffeine, half decaf.
 Cut back on your use of over-the-counter medications, such as 
Bromo-Seltzer, Excedrin, or NoDoz.
 Rather than soda, order water with lemon in restaurants — it’s trendy!
 Limit yourself to no more than two soft drinks a day.
 Go through the day counting caffeine just like you count calories.
 Limit yourself to two units (cups of coffee, glasses of iced tea, soft drinks)
at one sitting — anything more you can think of as “caffeine bingeing.”
Caffeine has an active half-life of three to seven hours. If you want a good
night’s sleep (see Chapter 17), avoid caffeine four hours before bedtime.
Adopting a New Drinking Style
Unless you have a definite drinking problem, a few common-sense rules
about how to drink responsibly will hold you in good stead. Here’s my 12-step
program:
 Avoid drinking alone. Married people are less likely to smoke, drink,
and drink heavily than unmarried people. As crazy as this may sound,
you’re also less likely to abuse alcohol when you’re in good company
than when you’re by yourself.
 Eat plenty of food before you drink and while you’re drinking.
Food absorbs alcohol and lessens its effect on your nervous system
(especially high-protein foods such as meat and cheese).
 Alternate between alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks. That way, you’ll
cut your alcohol intake by half!
207
Chapter 15: Managing Your Chemistry

 Drink slowly. Aggressive drinkers drink everything faster and, as a
result, end up having more drinks. Try to make each drink last one hour
(the time it takes for your body to eliminate that same drink).
 Volunteer to be the designated driver once in a while. Your friends will
love you and you’ll feel much better than they do in the morning.
 Always let someone else pour. People are far more generous in the
amount of alcohol they use per drink when they make it for themselves.
 When you go out, decide in advance how much money you want to
spend on alcohol. With the price of a drink somewhere between $4 and
$8, it won’t take long to reach the limits of your pocketbook. (Better yet,
pay cash — if you’re like most people, you have less of that than you do
credit!)
208
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 
Letting the impulse pass
Call it an urge, a craving, a hunger — whatever.
You ingest most substances based on impulse.
An impulse is your body’s way of signaling you
that it wants (or needs) something and your job
is to satisfy that impulse. The whole process is
mindless!
Some people have too many impulses to eat —
and they end up obese. Some have too many
urges to consume alcohol — and they end up
alcoholics. Some have too many urges to smoke
cigarettes — and they end up with lung cancer.
Some have too many urges to buy things — and
they end up broke.
The number of urges you have throughout the
day to do something reflects just how much a
part of your life is defined by that want or need.
For example, in Chapter 2 I talk about the differ-
ence between folks who only occasionally get
irritated versus those who fit the profile of a
chronic rager. The same distinction can be
made between a chipper (someone who only
occasionally smokes a cigarette) and a four-
pack-a-day smoker. So, here’s my question: Do
you want your life to be defined by chemicals of
this sort?
The good news about impulses are that they’re
transient — they come and go, passing through
your nervous system if you let them. Each time
you experience the impulse but don’t act in a
way that satisfies it, the strength of the impulse
weakens. If you’re a smoker, think of your
favorite cigarette. Each time you don’t smoke
that cigarette, it becomes a little less important
until one day it’s not your favorite cigarette at all.
The same strategy works when you’re trying to
get sober — each time you intentionally put
yourself in a situation where you always drank
alcohol in the past, and don’t drink, the connec-
tion between that place and alcohol weakens
until you can go there with no urge to have a
drink whatsoever. (That’s why traditional 28-day
sobriety programs generally don’t work. They
isolate you from the real world for a few weeks
until you dry out and then send you right back
out there where the situational urge to drink is
just as strong as ever. You don’t have a chance!)

 Never drink when you’re in a bad mood. Remember: Even though
most people think of alcohol as a stimulant (it loosens us up and gets
the social juices flowing!), it’s actually a depressant. The truth of the
matter is that, after a brief period of euphoria, your mood will take a
downturn. If you’re suffering from clinical depression (see Chapter 19),
you should never — and I emphasize never — drink alcohol!
 Let someone else in your group be the drunk. Competing to see who
can drink the most or get drunk the quickest is a child’s game — and a
dangerous one at that.
 Don’t drink before you drink. Having a drink (or two) before you leave
home, get on the road, and head off to an evening of socializing (and
more drinking!) only adds to the amount you’re drinking.
 Drink like you’re a woman — whether you are or not. Women have a
lower tolerance for alcohol and require fewer drinks to feel intoxicated.
Find some other arena to prove your manhood — like on the golf course
or in the executive boardroom.
 If you do all this and you still drink too much, consider seeking pro-
fessional help.

The blessing of old age
Temperament changes with age. My studies of
community residents, ranging in age from ado-
lescents to folks in their 80s, suggests that as
people age, they tend to be less impulsive, less
emotionally reactive, and more independent
(who would have guessed?). This most likely
also explains why people smoke less and get
less angry in their later years. There’s no known
cure for aging, but at least this information gives
us something to look forward to!

Adding Balance to Your Life
In This Chapter
 Adopting a balance-sheet approach to life
 Identifying the barriers to a balanced lifestyle
 Overcoming extremes
 Figuring out how to be multidimensional
W
ho says anger management can’t be fun? Of course it can and, in this
chapter, I show you how. Basically, it comes down to one simple thing:
adding balance to your life.
Is your personality too one-dimensional — work, work, and more work? Do
you live life mostly at the extremes? Does everything you do have an all-or-
nothing quality to it? Too much socializing, too little solitude? Too much par-
enting, too little canoodling? When’s the last time you experienced some
healthy pleasure — and, do you even know what that is? Are you well con-
nected socially? How uplifted have you been lately?
If you answer these questions the way I think you will (and, unfortunately, the
way most people do), then your lifestyle is definitely out of balance. To fix
this, I show you how adopting a balance-sheet approach to life leaves little
room for anger.
Counterbalancing Stress
Thirty years ago, Dr. Stewart Wolf, a pioneer in the field of stress research,
introduced the concept of “counterbalancing stress” to the world of modern
medicine. Up until that time it was inconceivable that human beings could
protect themselves from stress-induced illness by their own voluntary
actions — for example, by maintaining strong religious beliefs, fostering
family solidarity, and striving for an interdependent (working collaboratively
with others) lifestyle.

No longer did we have to wait for the stresses of everyday life to make us sick
(or angry!) — we could counterbalance that stress and thereby remain
healthy. So, how do you do that? In the following sections, I provide the infor-
mation you need.
Adding uplifts to your life
In Chapter 14, I tell you about the harm that minor irritants (hassles) can have
on both your temperament and your health. What about the flip side of that
stress-illness relationship? Just as you encounter all kinds of small stresses
day to day, you probably also encounter a variety of small positive, uplifting
experiences. Uplifts involve people, events, circumstances, and activities that
create in you a sense of joy, hope, optimism, faith, relief, and release — all
antidotes to stress. Here are some examples of uplifts you may have in your
daily life:
 Engaging in regular exercise
 Spending time with children
 Working on hobbies
 Enjoying a beautiful day
 Reading for pleasure
 Shopping
 Making a new friend
 Hearing some good news
 Enjoying free time
 Meditating
 Giving and receiving love
212
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 
You’re not being serious
You may be surprised at how many people find
the idea of living a balanced lifestyle unthink-
able and unacceptable. One rather obsessive-
compulsive gentleman — always thinking,
always doing — came to me for stress man-
agement and ended up getting quite belligerent
when I suggested that he needed to learn to
“just sit and watch the grass grow.” He said
indignantly, “That’s it? That’s all you have to
offer? I don’t think you’re taking my problem
seriously and that pisses me off!” No matter
how hard I tried to explain that I was just 
suggesting a principle we might pursue — to
balance off his constant striving for accomplish-
ment with some old-fashioned relaxation — it
was to no avail. He left angry.

 Smelling pleasant aromas — vanilla, lavender, the smell of fresh bread
 Being entertained
 Spending time with pets
 Contributing to a charity
 Doing volunteer work
Uplifts affect you in the opposite way that stress does. Stress expends energy
and can lead to a condition known as vital exhaustion (see Chapters 3 and 17),
whereas uplifts create energy and revitalize you physically and mentally.
Stress irritates your nervous system — hence, its connection to anger. Uplifts
have a relaxing effect and release stored-up tension, leaving the door open
for feelings of peace, tranquility, and inner harmony.
The more hassles — as well as major stresses — you have in your life at the
moment, the more you need to be uplifted. But you can’t rely on the chance
that these positive experiences will find you — you have to seek them out,
make them happen, go looking for them. In other words, you have to take the
initiative. Believe me, you’ll be glad you did. Start by making sure you have at
least one uplifting experience each day — no exceptions!
Living an unbalanced life can be painful! For the past 25 years, I have worked
tirelessly to rehabilitate clients suffering from chronic, disabling back pain.
One of the things I find most interesting is that the first thing these folks do
after they’re injured is eliminate all the uplifting social and recreational expe-
riences from their lives. They quickly decide to give up having sex, going to
church, visiting friends, attending their youngsters’ sporting events — all
because of pain. Yet, strangely enough, even with pain, they continue to 
complete domestic chores — vacuum, rake leaves, carry in the groceries. 
No wonder 70 percent of them become clinically depressed. Their lives are
lopsided — all they have left are pain and chores.
213
Chapter 16: Adding Balance to Your Life
Creating a favorable ratio
When my daughter, Rebecca, was in high
school, she had to conduct a project to compete
at the science fair at the local community col-
lege. Being the helpful father I was, I suggested
she study the relationship between daily has-
sles, uplifts, and illness among young people
her age. She loved the idea!
She set about surveying a sizable number of her
peers, asking them to indicate how often they
experienced a wide range of standard hassles
and uplifts within the past month, and also had
them complete a self-report illness measure.
What she found was intriguing: It turned out 
that the best predictor of illness wasn’t either
the hassles or uplifts score alone, but the 
ratio of the two. The more positive the ratio
(uplifts divided by hassles), the fewer health
complaints.

Moving away from the extremes
Are you one of those people who lives life at the extremes? Everything you do
is either all or nothing. You think too much and act too little. Your daily rou-
tine is full of a long list of have to’s (have to go to work, have to pick up the
kids, have to pay the bills, have to mow the grass) with no room left for any
want to’s (want to take a nap, want to sit quietly and drink a glass of wine,
want to listen to some classical music, want to call an old friend and catch
up). Your life seems mostly about others and not about you. (That may get
you into heaven, but it makes for a very stressful time on earth!)
Well, if you want to counteract stress, it’s time you moved to the center. Add
more diversity to your day — mow the grass and then have your glass of
wine! Make that long-distance call to your old friend during your lunch break
at work. Pick up the kids at school and then, while they run off to do their
thing, you do yours — take a bubble bath while listening to your yoga tape.
Basically, what I’m advocating here is that it’s possible to literally have your
cake and eat it, too. Make a concerted effort to engage in at least one “want
to” experience as part of your daily routine. Doesn’t matter what it is or how
little time it takes — just do it!
Creating Healthy Pleasure
One thing is for certain: Human beings are creatures who constantly need
and seek pleasure. Without a sufficient amount of joy and pleasure in our
lives, we inevitably end up feeling irritable, moody, tense, and, worst of all,
dull. Seeking pleasure in everyday life is just as natural for your brain as
avoiding pain. That’s right: The rather large, extremely complex brain you
have operates on what is called the pain-pleasure principle — and, it continu-
ally strives (with or without your help) to strike a favorable balance between
the two.
The brain doesn’t distinguish between healthy and unhealthy pleasure —
from a neurological standpoint, it’s all the same. The good news is you can
achieve the same high from running a marathon as you can from smoking
pot. The former is an example of healthy pleasure (pleasure without adverse
consequences); the latter, not so much. Have you ever known anyone who
lost all her initiative, became uncoordinated, had trouble driving a car, and
developed memory problems from running a marathon? Ever heard anyone
called a “marathon head”? How about with pot?
214
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

I’m going to assume you have a good bit of experience with unhealthy 
pleasures — drinking too much alcohol, taking in too much caffeine, gam-
bling on sporting events, driving way above the speed limit, having unpro-
tected sex, and engaging in shop-’til-you-drop consumerism. But do you often
engage in healthy pleasure? Here is a list of possibilities:
 Attend a jazz festival.
 Savor a cool glass of lemonade.
 Go crabbing in the backwaters of Galveston Bay. (Boy, do I miss that!)
 Walk your dog.
 Watch birds cavort through the trees in the springtime.
 Enjoy an expensive meal.
 Help someone less fortunate.
 Get a new car. (I know they’re expensive, but still. . . .)
 See the Grand Canyon for the first time.
 Ride in a hot air balloon.
 Spend a week on Maui.
 Watch your favorite football team score the winning touchdown in the
last second of the game.
 Look at the horizon and picture God’s handiwork.
Spend some time — it doesn’t have to be much — each day indulging in some
form of healthy pleasure. (Careful, you might get addicted!)
215
Chapter 16: Adding Balance to Your Life
A pleasure a day
For the past seven years, I begin each day —
without fail — by having breakfast at a local
restaurant. I’m there even on the weekends and
holidays, like clockwork. I sit quietly, eat a
modest breakfast, read my paper and then 
my AA devotional, and have that precious 
20 minutes with myself before taking on the
challenges of the day. It’s something I look for-
ward to, much like I used to look forward to a
stiff drink at the end of a tiring day. It took me
most of my adult life to appreciate simple plea-
sures like this and how they set the stage for
whatever comes next.

Go with the Flow
Do you ever get so involved in something that nothing else seems to matter
and you lose track of time? This is the question that Dr. Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi, professor of psychology at the University of Chicago, asks
countless numbers of people in the study of what he calls flow — a state of
consciousness that occurs when you find yourself immersed in one of those
“best moments of my life.” Csikszentmihalyi, interestingly, finds that only 20
percent of people answer yes, that this happens to them on a daily basis.
Fifteen percent say no, that it never happens — and, these, I’m willing to bet,
are the folks most likely to experience toxic anger.
So, how do you get into this healthy state of mind? Actually, it’s not that diffi-
cult. Here are some tips:
 Flow comes from active involvement in some aspect of daily life. Flow
is not some mystical, magical, spiritual state that falls over you — if
you’re lucky — like mist from the heavens above. It only comes when
you’re actively involved in life. Passive activities — watching TV, listen-
ing to music — won’t do the trick. For me, writing books provides a con-
stant state of flow. For you, it may be a hobby — stamp collecting, bird
watching, experimental cooking, gardening, chess, or recreational sports
like golf and tennis.
 Flow requires positive motivation. Flow is a byproduct of a “want to”
activity. If you don’t really want to play golf today, and you’re just doing it
because your boss wants you to, you may shoot a low score, but you
won’t experience flow. Again, using myself as an example, I write because
I want to, not because I have to — and that makes a big difference!
 Flow requires your full attention. Flow requires a full commitment on
your part. Your mind cannot be elsewhere while you are actively
engaged in something that has the potential to produce flow. Mentally
speaking, you and the activity have to be one. A client of mine who has
been suffering from extensive pain throughout his body every minute of
the day for over 20 years puts it this way: “When I can’t stand the pain
anymore — when it’s absolutely killing me — I go up into my computer
room and get into the computer. I don’t get on the computer, I get into it.
I get lost in there, and for a couple of hours, I am completely pain free.”
 Flow activities have to be challenging. Doing something that is easy,
that doesn’t take much in the way of skills, energy, or concentrated effort,
won’t produce flow. Flow comes from activities that are challenging, even
though they may seem effortless when you’re doing them. Repetition
makes us dull! If you start out achieving flow from a particular activity,
over time — if you don’t change the activity in some way to make it more
challenging or complex — it will lose its effect. That’s why, for my entire
40-year career, I have made it a practice never to be redundant in what I
do at workshops or in my writing — I’m trying to stay in the flow.
216
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

 Flow comes from activities that produce immediate reward. You
achieve flow in the process, not in the outcome. It happens while you’re
actively engaged, not later on down the road. Whereas most of the
rewards in life comes from sustained effort — nose to the grindstone —
flow occurs in the here and now. And it begins to subside as soon as you
stop whatever you’re doing to produce it. A lot of people ask if flow
leads to happiness. The answer is yes, but happiness is the end product
of lots of moments of flow that accumulate over time.
 Flow activities don’t always present themselves — sometimes you
have to create them. I hear people say all the time, “I just never seem to
have the time to do the things I really enjoy. I can’t remember the last
time I had an opportunity to sit and play the piano — my favorite thing. I
wish God would just give me a day off.” What I hear less — maybe
because I work with very distressed folks — is something to the effect
of, “I know the dishes need washed and I still haven’t vacuumed the
downstairs, but, what the heck, I’m going to stop and play the piano a
while. I need to get into the flow.” Make time for flow. Make it a priority
in your life. Be one of that top 20 percent of the population that under-
stands what Dr. Csikszentmihalyi is talking about.
 Flow comes from knowing yourself. You experience flow when you
commit yourself to spending time in your favorite activity. So I ask you,
what is your favorite activity? You may not be able to readily answer
that simple question. That’s in part because you don’t know enough
about yourself to actually know what your favorite activity is. Spend
some time experimenting with different activities that appeal to you a
little bit and see which ones you have the most fun with.
Table 16-1 lists examples of activities that do and don’t produce a state of
flow.

What do you want to do Saturday?
One day when I was venting to my therapist,
who was doing all he could to help me out of
this state of intense and prolonged depression,
about all the things that had bugged me lately,
he interrupted and asked me, “Doyle, what is it
that you want to do next Saturday?” Somewhat
startled, I immediately answered, “I have to go
to my son’s Little League game, my wife wants
to go shopping. . . .” He interrupted again and
said, “I didn’t ask you what your son, wife, or
daughter wanted you to do next Saturday — I
asked what you wanted to do.”
I didn’t know what to say, so I sat there quietly
and began to feel angry. I realized in that
moment that at age 45 — having had a highly
successful career and having been a good hus-
band, father, son, son-in-law, friend, brother,
neighbor — I didn’t know anything about
myself, who I was, and what I wanted out of life.
My whole life had been in the service of others
and I was a complete stranger to myself. My life
was totally out of balance! And it was on that
day that I started on the road to recovery.

Maintaining Meaningful Social Ties
Human beings are social animals. Like dogs, we are what are commonly
referred to as pack or companion animals and it isn’t in our nature to live
alone. That isn’t to say that you can’t survive all by yourself; it just means
that you’ll find it much more tedious, burdensome, and difficult to do so —
even more so when life becomes too stressful.
Strive for quality not quantity
Often, people confuse social support with a social network. Support has to do
with the quality of your relationships with those closest to you — family,
spouse, friends, children, neighbors — and, at its best, reflects a state of inti-
macy or emotional connection with others. A network, on the other hand,
simply defines how many such relationships you have (the quantity).
Some people have a rich support network, with only a small number of indi-
viduals. Others have literally a zillion friends and acquaintances, yet are
hard-pressed to name one they can call on in a time of need. Of course, it’s
218
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

okay to have casual acquaintances in your life — people you hang out with
once in a while — as long as you have strong support in other relationships.
It is these more enduring and meaningful relationships that protect and sus-
tain you during hard (more stressful!) times.
Assemble your support team. Here’s how:
1. Make a list of people you think you can call on when life becomes too
stressful.
2. Next to each name, list whether these people are local (within driving
distance) or long-distance (only an e-mail or phone call away).
3. Make a note of how long it’s been since you had contact with each
person — two days, six months, longer than that?
4. If it’s been too long since you last touched base, call or drop each
person a note and reconnect.
5. Decide what type(s) of support you can get from each member of your
team.
Examples include
• Emotional support: A hug, the chance to vent
• Tangible support: Transportation, a loan, fixing something for you
• Informational support: Advice, counsel
• Appraisal feedback: Constructive criticism, praise
Now, you’re prepared for whatever life throws at you.
Support is a two-way street
Support is a give-and-take process. If you only take and never give, you find
fewer people available for support as time goes on. You have to reciprocate —
be there when they need you, be at the ready with some sage advice, lend a
helping hand, and so on.
Reaching out to help is just as important as reaching out for help. Think of it
as an investment in your future. Plus, helping other people is a good way to
balance out your life.
Support is only good if you accept it
If you’re like most people, you have lots of potential support that you never
fully take advantage of. What possible good does the help of other people do
you if you don’t accept it?
219
Chapter 16: Adding Balance to Your Life

A chronic-pain client of mine — I’ll call him Andy — sat in the men’s pain
group week after week, complaining that since he was injured and lost his 
job all of his so-called friends had abandoned him, something that seemed, 
at least to him, to justify his abiding anger. What Andy didn’t want to talk
about — and would get even angrier if I brought it up — was the fact that he
had systematically avoided all overtures by his friends to support him. He
steadfastly refused to return their phone calls, wouldn’t answer the door
when they came to call (or hid in the bedroom and had his wife tell them he
wasn’t at home), and always said no when they invited him to join them in
activities that he used to enjoy. Who had abandoned whom here? The fact
that, yes, they eventually — slowly but surely — quit offering support said
more about Andy than about any of his friends.
Having people who support you isn’t enough — you have to accept that sup-
port when they offer it. If you have trouble asking for and accepting help,
you’ll find it easier if you give to others — when you see that giving feels
good, you’ll have an easier time accepting the same from your friends and
family. Don’t deny them the joy that comes from giving.
Understanding Why Your 
Life Is Unbalanced
In today’s demanding, fast-paced, opportunistic world, it’s easy for life to
become unbalanced. All kinds of factors can contribute to an unbalanced life,
primary among them the ones I cover in the following sections.
Age
As with any skill, you find how to balance out your life by living. As you get
older, you get wiser. Young people have a tendency to be one-dimensional.
They put their energies into one thing or another — relationships, careers.
Older folks are more diversified, more balanced in their use of energy. Life
has taught them the fallacy of an all-or-nothing relationship with the world
around them.
Gender
Women generally tend to be better at balancing their lives than men. Why?
Simple: They have to because of the many, varied demands that culture
places on them. Women no longer have to choose between a domestic life
(being a homemaker, raising children) and having a career — in today’s
220
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

world, they’re expected to do both, as well as tend to elderly parents (and 
in-laws).
Personality
Introverts have a much harder time reaching out for support when they’re
under stress. Type A personalities, because of their overly hostile nature,
tend to alienate others and, as a result, do not enjoy the same level of social
support (and connection to the world around them) as Type B’s do (see
Chapter 10). Hardy individuals, on the other hand, have no difficulty taking
the initiative in keeping their lives balanced and committing themselves
wholeheartedly to activities that keep them in flow. (Turn to Chapter 14 to
discover how to be a hardy personality.)
Time constraint
In my opinion, time management is the single biggest challenge facing human
beings today. The average person has more money than he does time. The
culture has bought into the 24/7 mentality and many people work ten-hour
days, six or seven days a week.
Overemphasis on independence
In most western cultures, there is a strong emphasis on independence.
Society tells you that you should control your own destiny without much, if
any, help from others. To reach out for support is seen as a sign of weakness.
Success comes from individual effort and initiative. Interdependence — doing
with others — has become a lost art. When you’re pressured to be indepen-
dent, you take on too much work yourself, and your life goes out of balance.
A reliance on unhealthy pleasure
Make no mistake — unhealthy pleasure sells! By unhealthy pleasure, I mean
that buzz or jolt you experience with caffeine, that thrill of victory that
accompanies work accomplishments, the high that people get from a friendly
sports bet or compulsive gambling, the eager anticipation that awaits your
next encounter with a fast-food restaurant, and the passion of unsafe sex. 
The problem, unfortunately, with unhealthy pleasure is that it comes with a
cost — gambling throws your bankbook out of balance, too much caffeine
throws your physiology out of balance (Chapter 15 tell you how much is too
much), and unsafe sex leads to disease and pregnancy — which only adds to
the stress in your life.
221
Chapter 16: Adding Balance to Your Life

Stress
Einstein was right about the theory of relativity — everything in life is rela-
tive. By yesterday’s standards, life today is extremely stressful, exhausting,
and unbalanced. But by today’s standards, all of that is normal. People today
don’t know how really stressed they are — so they don’t appreciate the need
to balance out their lives. You’ve probably come to accept that burdensome
feeling of having too much to do in not enough time as normal, usual, and
customary.
Technology
You live in a marvelous technological age. There are more gadgets than ever,
and life has never been more easily managed (from a production standpoint)
than it is today. But, technology is a double-edged sword. Because it makes
life easier, it (in its own seductive way!) makes you want to do more with your
life. Because we have automobiles, we want to go more places. Because we
have computers at our disposal that make information more available, we
expect to accomplish more in a given workday. Because we have cellphones,
we no longer have any real sanctuary from the stressful world around us. If
you’re not calling them, they’re calling you — constantly!
Affordability
People in most corners of the world today are more prosperous than ever
before. Despite our complaints to the contrary, the standard of living and the
amount of disposable income for most people has dramatically increased
over the last century. What this means is that we can literally afford to live an
unbalanced lifestyle. Thanks to the credit card industry and dual-income 
families, you can create mounting levels of personal debt that are burden-
some, to say the least. And to make matters worse, the more you can afford
(or think you can afford), the more you want. So, you spend more hours work-
ing and fewer hours engaging in flow, maintaining meaningful social ties, and
indulging in healthy pleasure.
Too much freedom
No one (except dictators!) would argue that freedom is a bad thing, but too
much of a good thing can be bad. Without doubt, people have more options,
opportunities, and choices to make than ever before in the history of
mankind. Trouble is, I think, most people try to exercise as many of those
222
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

options as they can. By wanting it all, you overload yourself with demands,
commitments, and obligations that you can’t possibly satisfy. (As the cartoon
character Pogo said, “We have met the enemy, and he is us.”)
Lack of perspective
Most people seem to live for today. In your parents’ or grandparents’ day, a
favorite saying was “I’m waiting for my ship to come in,” meaning that you
work hard while looking ahead and hope that one day some good fortune will
come your way. Your parents or grandparents “saved for a rainy day,” waiting
until they could afford to pay cash for something before they bought it — an
idea that by today’s standards seems absolutely abhorrent.
Today, if you want something, you’re supposed to get it now. If something
feels good, do it now. Don’t think about it, don’t weigh the pros and cons,
don’t put things in perspective — go for it now!
How does this lack of perspective lead to imbalance? It creates future
stresses — like debt! — that become burdensome later on. In effect, too
much pleasure today can cause too much pain tomorrow.
Making Self a Priority
Living an unbalanced life can be more about neglecting yourself than it is
about being too selfish. Most people are good, decent, and well meaning —
but they get caught up trying too hard to satisfy the unending needs of the
people they love and the people they work with.
223
Chapter 16: Adding Balance to Your Life
No time for this . . .
The principal of a middle school where I had
conducted an anger survey asked that I make a
presentation of the findings to parents attend-
ing a PTA meeting. She thought they would
want to know just how angry their children
were and my thoughts about how this impacted
their education. I agreed.
So, a few weeks later, I stood up in front of hun-
dreds of parents to share my thoughts and get
their response. I was amazed by what I saw as
I looked out across their faces — blank, expres-
sionless looks and absolutely no energy.
When I finished, the principal asked if there
were any questions or concerns. There 
were none — not a single hand was raised.
These poor families, it was plain to see, were
exhausted from the day’s work and all the
chores that still lay ahead — and, they simply
had no time to find out anything about their kids.

Brenda is a good example. She came into my office one day and instantly
started crying. She had awakened from a nightmare early in the morning and
hadn’t been able to calm herself down ever since. I asked her what the dream
was all about. She replied that it was about a totem pole, which she explained
was something that symbolized all the highpoints in a person’s life after they
were deceased. In her dream, she was reviewing all the elements on her
totem pole from the top down — her husband, daughter, parents, in-laws,

The town of Roseta
Dr. Stewart Wolf and his colleague John Bruhn,
both behavioral scientists working in the field of
medicine, discovered a small Italian community
in eastern Pennsylvania that, they believed,
unlocked the secret to the epidemic of heart
disease that began in the United States in the
early 1900s. What they found unique about
Roseta was the fact that one person had died of
a heart attack over a period of 16 years —
despite the fact that Rosetans smoked ciga-
rettes, had a diet high in animal fat, had elevated
cholesterol levels, and were sedentary and
obese.
So, why were they immune to heart disease?
Wolf and Bruhn found the answer in how
Rosetans lived their lives. They had somehow
maintained the old-world family structure, with
a great deal of intergenerational interdepen-
dence. And, this was also true throughout the
community as a whole. They were an extremely
cohesive people. Everyone literally made it their
business to help everyone else. Social support
was abounding. There was no poverty or crime,
and the elderly were held in high esteem —
they were listened to and respected. Rosetans
were hardy souls. Rosetans emphasized reli-
gious beliefs over materialism. They shared a
group identity and what they accomplished as
individuals mattered less. Each member of the
town knew his place in a highly structured soci-
ety and felt self-satisfied and secure.
Unfortunately, time marches on and Roseta was
the ultimate victim of the new world order. Their
young people began to choose values and behav-
ioral patterns that conflicted with the previous
well-integrated social structure. Instead, they
actively pursued their own individual advance-
ment and status, spent far less time participating
in religious activities, preferred country clubs to
social clubs, and became increasingly dependent
on life outside Roseta — new relationships, new
opportunities.
With these changes came heart disease — not
surprisingly linked to anger. In wonderfully
descriptive clinical cases of two Rosetan men
who died of heart attacks, Wolf and Bruhn
noted that both were volatile individuals who
were under constant stress, had few support-
ive relationships, were Type A personalities,
and were angry most of the time. One man
openly expressed his anger and died at age 39
on a day in which he earlier had a fistfight with
a drunk. The other kept a lifetime of anger — at
his family of origin, his spouse, his unfulfilling
job, his lack of education — suppressed until
the day he died suddenly, at age 41, working
selflessly on a project for his wife, whom he
despised. Characterized as “misfits” in an oth-
erwise balanced society, they had lost their
immunity from this dreaded disease.

siblings — and, as she got to the bottom, she suddenly realized that she was
“nowhere on the pole.” Translation: She had never been a part of her own life,
only a part of other people’s lives. The fact that this revelation came about
when she was almost 60 years old made it all the more disturbing. Brenda
was a truly selfless person, but also a deeply depressed, rather hopeless
woman. The two were linked. For Brenda to become free of depression, she
would, we agreed, have to begin to live for herself and not just others (at
least some of the time) — in other words, achieve some balance in her life.
Challenge yourself by asking some simple, but important questions: Are you
worth it? Do you deserve some relief from stress? Do you deserve to experi-
ence flow some time in your life? Are you worth overcoming all the obstacles
that keep you from living a more balanced life? I hope the answer is yes!

I
’m sure you’ve seen a child, out in public, screaming and thrashing about,
totally at odds with everything going on around him. The child is tired 
and angry. Nothing his parents do suits him. And if he can hold still for one
second, he falls into a deep sleep, hanging on his mother’s arm like a rag doll.
Fast-forward this scenario 20 or 30 years, and you can see countless adults
doing the same thing — acting cranky because they’re exhausted and behind
on their sleep. Poor and inadequate sleep increases irritability, which is a
crucible for impending anger.
In this chapter, I talk about the vital role that rest and proper sleep play in
anger management. I tell you how to maintain good sleep hygiene — and
what that means. You discover how to listen to your body’s signals, telling
you it’s time to give it a rest. With the information in this chapter, you won’t
always find yourself getting up on the wrong side of the bed.
Understanding What Sleep Does for You
Contrary to what you may have always thought, sleep is not a waste of time.
Sleep is an essential tool in the human nervous system’s effort to survive. In
an evolutionary sense, sleep protects you by removing you from an other-
wise harmful environment — your cavemen ancestors were at a distinct dis-
advantage at night compared to the predators of the day. Sleep also plays a
restorative function, both physically and psychologically. It helps you to

recover from the events of the previous day and prepares you to meet tomor-
row’s challenges. Most important, sleep restores lost energy. Finally, sleep
plays a crucial role in physical development, especially in children and 
adolescents — for example, during sleep the pituitary gland releases a
growth hormone.
Perhaps the easiest way for you to appreciate what sleep does for you is to
see what happens when you’re sleep deprived. The following are just a few
symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation:
 Suppression of disease-fighting immune system function (in other
words, you’re more likely to get a cold or the flu)
 Increased irritability
 Impaired creativity
 Difficulty concentrating
 Impaired memory
 Obesity
 High blood pressure
 Reduced problem-solving ability
 Inefficiency at work
 Being prone to accidents
 Driver fatigue
 Road rage
 Pessimism and sadness
 Early signs of diabetes
 Slurred speech
 Lower tolerance for stress
 Impaired coping abilities
 Slower reaction time
 Impaired decision-making abilities
 Rigid thought patterns (not being able to look at a situation in more than
one way)
 Hallucinations
 Emotional outbursts
228
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

 Increased potential for violence
 Reduced muscle strength
 Loss of stamina/endurance
To figure out if you’re suffering from sleep deprivation, ask yourself the fol-
lowing eight questions. If you answer yes to three or more, you’re definitely
behind on your sleep.
 Is it a struggle for you to get out of bed in the morning?
 Do you often fall asleep while watching TV?
 Do you fall asleep in boring meetings at work?
 Do you often fall asleep after eating a heavy meal?
 Do you have dark circles around your eyes?
 Do you typically sleep extra hours on the weekends?
 Do you often feel drowsy while driving or riding in an automobile?
 Do you often need a nap to get through the day?
People who suffer from Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
sleep apnea, alcoholism, or clinical depression, as well as those who do shift
work, are at high risk for sleep deprivation.
Knowing How Much Is Enough
The amount of sleep you need depends in large part on how old you are.
Table 17-1 shows you how much sleep is required, on average, by different
age groups.
229
Chapter 17: Getting a Good Night’s Sleep
Why torture yourself?
The Geneva Convention, the United Nations
Convention on Torture, and Amnesty Inter-
national all consider extended sleep deprivation
a form of torture, which should be outlawed by
all civilized societies. Yet, ironically, millions of
human beings torture themselves willingly day
after day by not getting the proper amount of
sleep. Who is there to protect them — against
themselves?

The need for nighttime sleeping is somewhat less for older adults, but they
tend to make up for it by taking daytime naps. It turns out that the idea that
you require less sleep in late life is a myth.
My uncle Aubrey lived to be 98 years old. And up until his death, he slept
soundly for eight to nine hours a night. He remained physically active —
planting apple trees all by himself — and lived independently to the end. His
mind was sharp, and he always displayed good humor. I never remember
seeing him get the least bit irritated. He was a testimony to what good sleep
can do for you!
Rating the Quality of Your Sleep
Even more important than the number of hours of sleep you get is the quality
of your sleep. Just because you spent eight hours in bed doesn’t necessarily
mean that you got a good night’s sleep. Ask anyone who’s slept off a big night
230
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 
Negative energy and anger
In one study, I asked 68 employees at a local
company two questions about energy:
 Do you feel fresh and rested when you
wake up in the morning?
 Do you ever feel like a battery that has lost
its charge?
I then compared their negative energy scores
(no to the first question, yes to the second.) to
how angry they were. Those who admitted to
“chronic rage” had a negative energy score
more than twice that of employees who
acknowledged getting only “intermittently irri-
tated” (see Chapter 2 for information on these
different types of anger experience).
Does this mean that people who are angry all
the time use up too much of their energy on
emotion, or does it mean that people who are
tired all the time are more apt to go into a rage?
At this point, I can’t say for sure, but I do believe
this link between energy and anger is worth
pursuing.

of drinking if she feels refreshed when she wakes up the next morning. Odds
are, the answer is no!
To determine the quality of your sleep, all you have to do is rate how rested
and refreshed you feel on a 10-point scale, where 1 is not at all and 10 is
extremely rested. Concentrate on how you feel when you first wake up in the
morning (before you even head off to the bathroom!). Do that for a period of
ten days and then figure out your average (add up all ten numbers and divide
by ten). This number will tell you if you’re usually getting a good night’s
sleep. If your average sleep rating is 7 or above, you’re in good shape. If your
average rating is below 7, you’re in trouble.
Sleep quality is directed related to sleep hygiene — maintaining healthy sleep
habits (just like oral hygiene is maintaining healthy habits for your teeth and
gums). Some examples of poor sleep hygiene includes the following:
 Taking daytime naps lasting for two or more hours (with the exception
of those age 60 or older)
 Going to bed and getting up at different times from day to day
 Exercising just prior to bedtime
 Using alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine within four hours of bedtime
 Participating in some kind of stimulating activity (for example, computer
activity) just prior to bedtime
 Going to bed angry, upset, or stressed

Chapter 17: Getting a Good Night’s Sleep
Vital exhaustion
Dutch psychologist Ad Appels and his col-
leagues at the University of Maastricht have
demonstrated a potent link between loss of
physical and psychological vitality (known as
vital exhaustion) and the risk for heart disease,
sudden cardiac death, and stroke. Interestingly,
of the three components that make up vital
exhaustion — excessive fatigue, increased irri-
tability, and demoralization — the one that puts
people at greatest risk is the “tiredness” factor.
Apparently, what those who suffer from exhaus-
tion can’t do is fall asleep easily and remain
asleep throughout the night without repeated
awakening. This leaves them suffering from
chronic sleep deficit — which no doubt explains
their increased irritability and depression.
Ask yourself the following five questions:
 Do you often feel tired?
 Do you feel weak all over?
 Do you lately feel more listless than before?
 Do you sometimes feel that your body is like
a battery that is losing its power?
 Do you ever wake up with a feeling of
exhaustion and fatigue?
The more of these questions you answer yes to,
the more likely it is that you’re suffering from
vital exhaustion.

 Using the bed for things other than sleep and sex (like work or 
watching TV)
 Sleeping in an uncomfortable bed
 Sleeping in an uncomfortable bedroom environment (one that’s too
bright, too warm or cold, too noisy, and so on)
 Actively engaging in important mental activity while in bed (This is not
the time to rehearse the speech you’re going to give at tomorrow morn-
ing’s staff meeting.)
Improving the Quality of Your Sleep
Improving the quality of your sleep is one area where you can definitely 
make a difference. Rather than continuing to be a victim of poor sleep (read:
exhausted and irritated!) — and before considering the use of sleeping pills —
begin practicing some good sleep hygiene. In the following sections, I show
you how.
Listening to your body
Fatigue isn’t a state of mind — it’s physical. Fatigue is your body’s way of
telling you — without words — that it’s low on energy. Just like hunger tells
you that your stomach is empty and thirst tells you that your body is dehy-
drated, fatigue is your body’s way of saying, “Get thee to bed!”
Energy is a fixed commodity. You have a certain amount to use each day to
accomplish whatever you need to. As long as the demands you face are
within the limits of your energy supply, your mind and body don’t show 
signs of strain. (In Chapter 14, I fill you in on the difference between stress
and strain.) Think of fatigue as a warning sign that you’re starting to run 
out of energy. Your body is letting you know it’s time to begin conserving
energy. Exhaustion — the most intense state of fatigue — is a sign that your
tank is near empty. It’s time to stop expending energy and begin a process of
recovery.
Take a few seconds once every hour throughout your day and monitor your
energy level. Rate your present energy level on a scale of 0 to 10 and record the
data in a notebook. At the end of the day, plot the numbers on a piece of graph
paper hour by hour. Do that for a week. Do you see any patterns? For example,
does your energy seem to decrease as the day goes on? At what point in the
day does your energy level drop to a rating of 5 or less (fatigue)? Does it ever
get as low as a rating of 1 or 2 (exhaustion)? Remember: The lower your energy
level, the more likely you’ll begin to feel strained; one common indicator of
strain is irritation, and the next step after irritation is anger.
232
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

Getting physical
Regular physical exercise is an essential part of good sleep hygiene. But, the
benefit of exercise on sleep only comes when you:
 Engage in moderate, nonstrenuous exercise. What you want to do is to
tire the body out and relax it without overstimulating it at the same
time. Any type of prolonged or intense exercise — which makes you
sweat — prior to going to bed will be counterproductive. Consider doing
10 to 15 minutes of light weights, slow walking on a treadmill, slow ped-
aling on an exercise bike, or stretching exercises.
 Exercise in the late afternoon or early evening. The benefits of exercis-
ing early in the day are long since past by the time you’re ready for bed.
But you also don’t want to wait until the last minute — an hour or two
before retiring — because of the overstimulation effect. Late afternoon
or early evening is the optimal time to exercise if you want a good
night’s sleep, because your body will be rebounding (cooling) a few
hours later, which promotes good sleep.
 Adjust your exercise to your age and overall fitness level. If you don’t,
you’ll stress your body and produce a sense of physical restlessness,
which will keep you awake.
 Make exercise part of your pre-sleep routine. Exercise should be but
one step — albeit an important one — in preparing you for optimal
sleep. Most likely, because of timing issues, it will be either the first or
second step, depending on your use of stimulants (see the “Avoiding
stimulants” section).

Chapter 17: Getting a Good Night’s Sleep
When are you most positive?
Research studies demonstrate that positive
mood fluctuates throughout the day and is high-
est during the middle of the day. Human beings
are their least positive selves when they first
wake up in the morning (between 6 and 9 a.m.)
and at the end of the day when they’re prepar-
ing for sleep (9 p.m. to midnight). The good news
is that if you wake up on the wrong side of the
bed, it won’t last. (My theory is that we’re all
more likely to be in a good mood when we’re
engaged in meaningful activity and around
people, which is less the case early and late in
the day.)
You’re also more likely to be hostile early in the
day — between 6 and 9 a.m. — than any other
time. You’re your least hostile self midday —
noon until 3 p.m. And then you begin getting
grouchy again right before bedtime. So next
time you need to have an important (potentially
stressful) conversation with someone, arrange
for a lunch meeting. You’ll be less likely to get
upset than you would if you talked over break-
fast or just before bed.

Avoiding stimulants
The two main stimulants that you should avoid four hours prior to sleep are
caffeine and nicotine. Both activate the central nervous system — your 
brain — and promote alertness, which isn’t what you want to do when you’re
getting ready to go to sleep.
Caffeine
When it comes to caffeine use, there are several things you want to keep in
mind:
 Caffeine is available in many forms — coffee, tea, soft drinks, choco-
late, over-the-counter drugs (for example, cold and allergy medica-
tion). So just because you’re passing up coffee after dinner doesn’t mean
that you’re not getting caffeine in the form of that triple-chocolate cake
you had for dessert.

Why Type A’s never rest
Type A’s — competitive, impatient, hostile —
never rest because they never get tired. Or,
does it just seem that way? Actually, Type A’s
fatigue just like Type B’s do — they just fail to
recognize it. Dr. David Glass, psychologist at the
University of Texas, was the first to note the ten-
dency of Type A personalities to suppress feel-
ings of fatigue while engaged in any sort of
competitive task (which with Type A’s means
most everything they do!). This, more than any-
thing, explains why they can relentlessly pursue
unreasonable deadlines and continue to give
120 percent effort until they reach their goal.
Type A’s have tunnel vision, focusing only on the
end game, with no appreciation whatsoever of
normal bodily sensations having to do with
things like hunger and fatigue. This trait no
doubt also explains why Type A’s also deny the
early signs and symptoms of an impending heart
attack and delay getting necessary medical
treatment.
When I first joined the faculty at Duke University
Medical Center and was the psychologist
assigned to the Coronary Care Unit, a male
patient was admitted, having just experienced
a severe heart attack. I met with his wife, who
was understandably quite upset. She said, “I
just don’t understand how he could just suddenly
have a heart attack and fall over like that in the
middle of the day.” After I talked with her, it
quickly became evident that her husband had
been symptomatic for several days. She now
remembered that he had walked around the
house rubbing his chest and complaining of a
feeling of pressure, which he interestingly (albeit
typically) attributed to having a cold or just
being tired. He also seemed not to have his
usual stamina and complained of shortness of
breath, which again he chalked up to “this thing
that’s going around.” And, last but not least, he
was more irritable than usual. In typical Type A
fashion, he went to work early the day of his
heart attack after arguing with his wife that he
couldn’t stay home sick — there was too much
business to be done!

 The body can only handle about 300 mg of caffeine in a 24-hour
period. Exceeding that amount isn’t difficult — one cup of regular coffee
contains between 100 and 220 mg of caffeine!
 The half-life of caffeine (the time it takes your body to get rid of it)
ranges between three and seven hours. So the cup of coffee you drank
at 8 p.m. can still be actively stimulating your nervous system when you
hit the sack at 11:30 p.m.
 Caffeine affects people differently. If you’re prone to anxiety and ner-
vousness, you only become more so with caffeine use.
 If you’re a heavy caffeine user (by that, I mean you routinely exceed
300 mg/day), caffeine withdrawal may be a problem when you
abstain from caffeine four hours or more before bedtime.
 Evidence shows signs of sleep disturbance even in those folks who
claim that caffeine has no effect on their sleep.
Nicotine
Nicotine, just like caffeine, stimulates the nervous system, leading to increased
heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and generalized muscle tension — hardly
conducive to good sleep. Smokers take longer to get to sleep, on average, and
are much more likely to awaken repeatedly through the night. Interestingly,
many smokers’ first thought when they wake up is to smoke a cigarette.
Smoking researchers attribute this to conditioned nicotine withdrawal — in
other words, your brain wakes you up because it needs a fix.
Try not to let your favorite cigarette of the day — all smokers have one — be
the one after dinner. Unfortunately, 40 percent or more of heavy smokers as
well as so-called chippers (those who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day)
enjoy that after-dinner smoke the most.
235
Chapter 17: Getting a Good Night’s Sleep
A word about alcohol
Although alcohol is considered a depressant
rather than a stimulant as far as its effect on the
nervous system, keep in mind the following:
 Smokers report that the most likely situation
in which they smoke is when they’re also
using alcohol.
 Alcohol has been shown to increase anxiety
and nervousness shortly after it is ingested.
 Alcohol use may lead to emotional out-
bursts (read: anger), which in turn make it
difficult for you to relax into sleep.
Bottom line: Drinking alcohol within four hours
of bedtime is not conducive to good sleep. Avoid
hitting the bottle before hitting the hay.

The stimulant effects of nicotine and caffeine are additive, and they combine
to ensure poor sleep. Bottom line: A little bit of both adds up to a lot when it
comes to activating the nervous system.
Setting up a pre-sleep routine
Your nervous system craves routine. It works best — and to your advantage
when it comes to being healthy — when you carry on day to day in much the
same way. You may find living a routine life boring, but your body loves it!
So, if you’re looking to get a better night’s sleep (and you’re wanting to
manage your anger), you need to have a pre-sleep routine. That routine
should begin four or more hours before you actually try to go to sleep —
when you have your afternoon or early evening workout, stop using caffeine
and drinking alcohol, and eat your last big meal of the day (you want your
body to complete the work of digestion before bedtime!) — and ends only
when you turn out the lights. It’s good not to go to bed on an empty stomach.
An hour or so before you go to bed, have a light snack — some yogurt or a
piece of fruit, not six slices of pizza or an ice cream sundae!
Creating a positive sleep environment
When it comes to creating a sleep environment with reduced stimulation, it’s
not just a matter of what you eat, drink, and smoke that counts. It also
includes the physical environment itself. Ideally, you want a place to sleep
that doesn’t just make getting a good night’s sleep possible, but very likely.
Here are some tips on how to create a positive sleep environment:
 Use curtains and window shades to cut down on intrusive light from
the outside.
 Avoid temperature extremes. The ideal temperature for sleeping is
between 54° F (12°C) and 75°F (24°C).
236
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 
Step away from the cellphone
At the very time I’m writing this chapter, late-
breaking medical news suggests that cell-
phones stimulate the brain by literally heating
up the “stimulation center” of the brain, leading
to increased tension and restlessness. The
researchers who made the finding say talking
on a cellphone is no different from having a cup
of coffee.

 Lower your body temperature by taking a hot bath two hours before
bedtime.
 Use earplugs if the person sleeping next to you has a snoring problem.
 Use background noise — a ceiling fan, a radio on low volume, or your
radio’s white noise or nature settings — to mask more disruptive
sound.
 Spend some money on a good mattress. You want one that fits your
body size (you don’t want your feet hanging off the end of the bed) and
provides adequate support.
Eliminating competing cues
The human brain works on the principle of association — if two things occur
in time and space often enough, your brain makes a connection. When that
connection is made, one part of that association will trigger the other. (That’s
why when you walk into a Mexican restaurant, you immediately think about
having a cold beer — the human version of Pavlov’s dogs!)
Your brain should have only one connection — one thought, one impulse,
one craving — when it comes to the sleep environment and that is: “Hooray,
finally, I can get some sleep!” If you’re saying, “What about sex?”, don’t worry:
Sex is the one other activity that the brain can connect with the bedroom,
but sleep is the primary reason for being there.
You may have a problem getting to sleep in your bedroom simply because
your brain has too many connections to other activities that compete with
sleep. For example, your bedroom may be the place where you:
 Watch television
 Argue with your spouse
 Eat late at night
 Have your last, favorite cigarette of the day
 Consume the last alcohol of the day
 Work
 Listen to loud music
 Study for a class or upcoming test
 Talk with your housemates about what you did today
 Plan for tomorrow
 Roughhouse with your pets
 Have late-night phone conversations
237
Chapter 17: Getting a Good Night’s Sleep

If using your bedroom as a multipurpose room sounds familiar, no wonder you
have trouble sleeping and are tired — and irritable — all the time. These are
all activities that you can — and should — do elsewhere. Where? Anywhere
but where you sleep. Your bedroom should be a place of sanctuary — a place
where your mind and body can rest and recover.
What if you live in a studio (one-room) apartment? Try to separate your
sleeping area from the rest of the room with bookshelves, a screen or room
divider, or something similar. Then vow to keep your non-sleep activities to
the other areas of your space.
Distancing yourself from work
For many people, work has become an all-consuming daily activity (some
argue that it’s an obsession!). If you’re not actually at work, it’s on your mind
and in your home. In fact, the most likely competing cues (see the preceding
section) that interferes with your sleep is work.
When I first started practicing behavioral medicine at Duke University
Medical School in the early 1970s, a man came into our clinic complaining of
chronic insomnia. He had apparently tried everything to solve this problem,
and nothing worked. As I was interviewing him about his sleep environment, I
quickly identified the problem: The man was an artist, and he painted “with a
passion” until it was time for bed. Then he stopped abruptly, turned off the
lights, and fell onto a cot he had sitting next to his easel. He was, in effect,
sleeping in his office — the place where he worked.
To make matters worse, he wasn’t allowing any time between the highly cre-
ative and stimulating activity of painting and trying to go to sleep. His brain
was still very much on when his head hit the pillow. I suggested two changes:
 That he begin to sleep only in his bedroom, a room separate from his
studio
 That he stop painting at least an hour before he retired
During that time, I also recommended he get out of the house and take a
short walk to clear his mind, do some light reading (something that had noth-
ing to do with his chosen profession), and just plain relax. He came back a
week later and, with some amazement, reported that he was sleeping soundly
for the first time in years.
If work is filling your every waking moment, you need sufficient time to dis-
connect or unplug your mind from work activities before you can have any
hope of getting to sleep. I recommend starting to pull away from all things
work related four hours prior to sleep. If four hours seem impossible, at least
give yourself one hour of separation time between work and sleep — but
keep in mind that more is better.
238
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

Uncluttering your mind
Another reason you may have difficulty getting a good night’s sleep is that
your mind is too cluttered with psychological “junk” at bedtime. The instant
things get quiet and the room gets dark, your brain begins to focus on all the
unsolved problems, grievances, anxieties, worries, and frustrations that make
up your psyche.
As part of your pre-sleep routine, you might try writing down things you have
in mind to do the next day. (Keep a notebook handy by your bedside table
just for this purpose.) That way, the list will be there for you in the morning
and you won’t have to toss and turn all night, worrying that you’ll forget.
Considering sleeping pills
Many people — frustrated from days, weeks, months, or years of bad sleep —
think that sleeping pills are a good option.
Using sleeping pills to get a good night’s sleep and reduce fatigue and irri-
tability is not something you should do without consulting your doctor. Many
types of sleeping pills produce negative side effects (daytime drowsiness,
anxiety, rebound insomnia when you stop taking them). Plus, using them may
only reinforce the idea that you’re a victim of a disorder over which you have
no control — which is far from true. No credible evidence says that over-the-
counter sleep aids improve sleep by any objective measure.
The one type of pill that might help you get a good night’s sleep, but without
the usual concerns about addiction and rebound effects, is an antidepres-
sant. Antidepressants can be prescribed at lower dosages to promote sound
sleep. Consult with your physician before deciding whether taking antide-
pressants to help with sleep is appropriate in your case.

Chapter 18
Looking to a Higher Power
In This Chapter
 Exploring the link between spirituality and emotional health
 Viewing faith as an anger-management tool
 Striving to be humble
 Substituting compassion for contempt
T
he peace of mind that comes from a belief in a higher power is an anti-
dote to anger. When you believe in something more powerful than your-
self and act in accordance with that belief, you tend to feel less helpless
about life’s struggles, less hopeless, and more optimistic about your future.
You can relax into your problems because you feel support from above.
In this chapter, I make a case for why I think spirituality — which may or may
not involve regular participation in religious activities — can lead to a more
anger-free life. This chapter is not meant to repeat information provided in
other chapters having to do with confession (Chapter 9), forgiveness
(Chapter 13), and what some might see as “sinful” substances like caffeine,
alcohol, and nicotine (Chapter 15). Instead, it addresses other traditional ele-
ments of spiritual belief such as faith, compassion, gratitude, and humility —
common to all organized religions — that you can also bring to bear in defus-
ing anger.
Reaching Up rather than Out
Support is essential to human survival. And for most of us, that support comes
from other human beings with whom we’re closely connected — your spouse,
family members, friends, children, members of your church or temple.
But what if those usual sources of support aren’t readily available for some
reason? What do you do in situations where you’ve exhausted all the sup-
portive resources at your disposal? What do you do if the people who typi-
cally support you are angry at you? In other words, what do you do when you
can’t reach out for help when you need it the most?

You reach up instead. You turn your thoughts to a higher power. You pray.
You take respite from the burdens of the world by turning your problems
over to that unseen, invisible, spiritual entity in whose hands you now feel
safe and secure. Then you can relax. You no longer need to defend yourself
against adversity — which means you don’t need to carry around all that fear
and anger.
According to the New Testament, even Jesus reached up to his heavenly
father, when faced with the ultimate destiny of his painful crucifixion, by
praying: “Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from
me; nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt” (Mark 14:36).
Don’t be afraid to be enthusiastic. Enthusiasm means “having a godly spirit
within.” Try to remain especially enthusiastic when you’re faced with life’s
many problems.
Using Faith as a Weapon
In my work, I’ve met many people who are incredibly angry because they
suffer from some type of chronic-pain disorder (for example, a back injury).
Believe me, I know they have a lot to be angry about — medical treatments
that haven’t worked, unsympathetic employers and insurance companies,
loss of income and status. What impresses me, though, is the intensity of
their anger and how long they hang on to it. Someone suffering from chronic
pain isn’t just irritated about his life and health situation, he’s extremely
angry — to the point of rage. And he stays that way day after day, year after
year, which only heightens his pain and leads to secondary psychological
242
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 
Showing up — it doesn’t matter where
If you want to minimize the odds that you’ll
suffer from the health problems in which anger
plays a significant role (see Chapter 2), take my
advice and attend a religious service at least
once a week. Medical studies have repeatedly
shown, for example, that churchgoers have
about half the risk for coronary heart disease as
do non-churchgoers. As a group, churchgoers
also have lower blood pressure — regardless
of their age, whether they smoke, their weight,
and their socioeconomic circumstances.
Apparently, participating in religious activities
can be the remedy for what the great psychol-
ogist William James called the “sick soul” of
mankind.
Remember: There is no evidence to suggest that
one religion — Christianity, Judaism, Islam,
Hinduism, Buddhism, and so on — conveys
more health protection than any other, so it
really doesn’t matter where you go — just that
you show up somewhere!

problems, such as depression. Many chronic-pain sufferers are caught up in a
vicious cycle — the more they hurt, the angrier they get, and the angrier they
get, the more they hurt.
Another thing that typifies this group is their loss of faith — in their employ-
ers, insurance companies, physicians, family members, friends, even in them-
selves. And more than a few lose faith in God, because they believe God has
abandoned them. For chronic-pain sufferers, anger seems to be their weapon
of choice. As they see it, anger is the only way they have to fight back against
pain and injustice.
But faith can be a weapon, too — and just as powerful as anger. Faith can be
an antidote to fear, isolation, and depression. Faith can be comforting. And as
long as you have faith in some higher power (no matter how you conceive of
that power), you’re never truly alone.
No one can make you have faith. It isn’t something that you earn. Believing in
something you can’t prove and over which you have no control is simply a per-
sonal choice. For example, you need a lot of faith to believe that an angry, defi-
ant teenager will actually grow up and amount to something in life. You need a
lot of faith to work your way through some unexpected crisis in your life — a
loving spouse who is suddenly diagnosed with cancer, a major hurricane that
destroys everything you’ve worked hard for over your lifetime, the loss of a
child to a drunk driver. Faith is a way of telling yourself that things will get
better even when all objective evidence points to the contrary. Having faith is
what keeps you from despair — and despair can be a breeding ground for anger.
243
Chapter 18: Looking to a Higher Power
Keep the faith
It was 2:30 a.m. and Art sat at his dining room
table contemplating taking his own life. He did
so while his wife of 25 years slept soundly in the
other room. Art had suffered from chronic pain
for almost 15 years, and he was tired of always
hurting, being unemployed, and being severely
limited in his routine, day-to-day activities. He
was angry — not angry because of anything
that had happened in the last day or two, but
angry about the endless struggle with pain that
had been forced on him by a work injury years
before. He felt totally alone with his pain and
suffering; even his wife, who loved him, couldn’t
understand why he couldn’t get well.
The decision he had before him that morning
was whether to end his suffering (he had the
revolver on the table) or to begin a whole new
approach to life that very day. At 54 years of age,
Art’s life was full of nothing but uncertainty — the
only thing he was certain of was that he would
experience pain every minute of the day ahead
of him.
After hours of going back and forth, he finally
decided to stay alive and become a “born-
again” person in terms of how he lived his life.
That was over a decade ago and Art remains in
chronic pain, but he is, by all accounts, a rea-
sonably happy man. He built a new house, trav-
els, works in his yard from time to time, even
plays a little golf — all while in pain. And all it
took to move from that old, tragic life into this
new one was a little faith!

Faith is a weapon that helps you deal with an uncertain future. It’s a means 
to an end — survival, a happier time, the resolution of a problem. Like most
human beings, you probably hate uncertainty because it elicits fear — and
fear, in turn, can lead to anger. Is anger your way of fighting off uncertainty
(“Damn it, why can’t things settle down and go right for a change?”)? If so,
embrace the uncertainty of the situation (see Chapter 14 for tips on how to
become a hardy personality) and transform a crisis into a challenge.
For the most part, anger is about defending yourself from adversity. Faith, on
the other hand, is a coping strategy, which Dr. Avery Weisman, author of The
Coping Capacity, describes as a “strategic effort to master a problem, overcome
a problem . . . that impedes our progress” through life. Anger is reactive — faith
is proactive.
Praying Prayers of Gratitude
There are many forms of prayer. Some people pray for understanding, some
for forgiveness, some pray to God to “fix” things in their lives that have gone
wrong, some for pain relief, some for opportunity, and so on. These all repre-
sent prayers of supplication — you want something! Such prayers always
begin with the word please.
Asking God for something is fine, but if you want to get something out of you
prayer life, it helps to think in terms of thank you. It’s hard to be angry when
you’re giving thanks.
Anger has a lot to do with feeling that you’re not getting what you want (or
what you feel entitled to). You’re not getting recognition at work or making the
money you feel you should. Your kids don’t show you the respect you feel enti-
tled to as a parent. Your dog doesn’t come when you call him. So you get mad.
244
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 
Hardiness and religion
Interestingly, studies show a link between reli-
gious attendance and being a hardy personal-
ity. Hardiness involves a sense of inner control,
an active commitment to life, and the ability to
view adversity as a challenge rather than a cat-
astrophe. Does attending a religious service
make you hardy or does it simply reinforce that
which is already part and parcel of your per-
sonality? Who knows? But because the two
seem inextricably connected, why not give it 
a try?

Gratitude, on the other hand, has to do with being thankful for what has
already been given to you. Some years ago, when I was trying really hard to
overcome a major episode of depression (accompanied by lots of anger), I
decided one morning to no longer ask God for anything for myself. I continued
to ask him to watch over my children as they learned from their successes
and failures, over my wife (the love of my life), over my brothers and their
families, over my friends, over my clients, and even over my bassett hounds.
But I figured that God had already given me more than I ever expected in life.
My thinking was that if God wants to bless me with more good things in the
years I have left, okay. And if not, that’s okay, too. Either way, I’m grateful —
and, I rarely get angry anymore.
Start each day with a prayer of gratitude. Make a mental list of all your 
blessings — people, events, whatever — and recite them to yourself (silently
or out loud) so that God knows that you remember the good things that have
been bestowed on you and you are, indeed, thankful. And then see if you
don’t feel a sense of inner peace as you take on the challenges of the day.
Practicing Compassion
All world religions, regardless of their differences, have one thing in 
common — they teach and preach compassion. When the Bible talks about
doing unto others as you would have them do unto you, it’s not talking about
anger and violence — it’s talking about love of your fellow man and woman
(or, for that matter, your cat!).
Table 18-1 highlights some differences between two opposing ways of treating
other human beings: compassion and revenge.
245
Chapter 18: Looking to a Higher Power
The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree
The difference between revenge and compas-
sion is illustrated by a wonderful story told by
the legendary golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez. Chi Chi
was born into a poor Puerto Rican family. Even
though his father worked hard, he still had diffi-
culty feeding his family.
One night, his father heard someone prowling
around in the backyard. When he went, machete
in hand, to investigate, Chi Chi’s father discovered
his neighbor — also very poor — picking up
bananas off the ground. Instead of getting angry
with his neighbor and attacking him for his theft,
he took the machete and cut off a big stalk of
bananas, handed them to his neighbor, and told
him that if his family needed something to eat he
shouldn’t steal it but instead come and ask him
for help.
That lesson in compassion set a standard for
Chi Chi’s whole life — and no doubt accounts
for his well-deserved reputation of sharing with
those much less fortunate the wealth he has
gained from playing professional golf.

Table 18-1
Revenge versus Compassion
Revenge . . .
Compassion . . .
Is born out of anger or hatred.
Is born out of love.
Has the goal of hurting someone.
Has the goal of helping another person.
Heightens conflict.
Eases conflict.
Is judgmental.
Is nonjudgmental.
Says, “They’re wrong.”
Says, “They need help.”
Says, “I’m against them.”
Says, “I’m for them.”
Is destructive.
Is constructive.
Make a pact with yourself not to let a day go by without finding some way in
which you can show compassion to your fellow man. You might be surprised
at how small acts of compassion — a kind word at exactly the right time —
can salvage someone’s day. Professor Shelly Taylor at UCLA sees such acts as
examples of what she calls “tending and befriending,” a form of positive psy-
chology (more about positive psychology in Chapter 19) that allows everyone
to better survive hard times. (Interestingly, this trait is much more common in
women than it is in men. Maybe this is why women live much longer?)

How are you?
During the five years I struggled my way
through a cloud of clinical depression, I often
found myself despondent and weary. And then
a wonderful thing would happen — the tele-
phone would ring and one of my close friends
would say, “Doyle, I just had a free minute in my
day and I wanted to see how you are.” Often,
my answer was, “Not too well!” My friend
would then spend a couple of additional min-
utes trying to lift my sagging spirits, but most of
all they let me know that somebody out there
cared about me. I honestly think those little
interventions of compassion saved my sanity, 
if not my life. I will go to my grave remember-
ing their calls with a never-ending sense of 
gratitude.
Remember: One way you can manage your own
anger is by helping those around you. Start
paying attention to your friends and family and
how they’re feeling. If you get your focus off of
your anger and onto helping someone else, you
may just find your anger abating.

Being Humble — It Helps
Developing a sense of humility is yet another antidote to toxic anger. Being
humble is the opposite of
 Being arrogant
 Feeling entitled
 Seeing yourself as superior
 Adopting an attitude of contempt toward all those you see as not as
good as you are
All of these opposites of humility tend to incite anger. Have you ever met a
Type A personality who was humble? Probably not! Type B’s, on the other
hand, have a refreshing sense of humility (see Chapter 10).
I remember hearing about the world-renowned stress researcher Dr. Hans Selye
who, when asked why he wasn’t stressed by the infirmities of his advanced age
(hobbling up and down from a stage to lecture about stress) and the fact that
not everyone in the medical profession agreed with the conclusions of his life’s
work, replied simply, “Because I never took myself that seriously.” Talk about
being humble!
Humility is born out of adversity. No one gets humble on the way up the
ladder of life — humility is what you experience on the way down. Being in
the business of human suffering, people ask me all the time, “Why does God
let bad things happen?” Not wanting to speak for God, I instead offer them my
personal theory of why such things happen and that is: “Because, I think,
that’s the only way we learn to be humble — which is God’s plan.” Who
knows if I’m right? But it does seem to ease their suffering a bit.
247

Type A personalities and religion
It turns out that Type A personalities are more
often churchgoers than Type B’s. This little bit of
trivia is intriguing given the observation that
Type A’s are less likely to believe in a loving and
forgiving higher power.
The cynical explanation for the link between
church attendance and Type A behavior is that
being a churchgoer, like having a high income
and occupational status, is a sign that people
have achieved ultimate success. One could cer-
tainly argue, on the other hand, that Type A’s
attend church in an effort to fill the “spiritual
void,” which the originators of the Type A con-
cept — Dr. Meyer Friedman and Dr. Ray
Rosenman — say typifies them.

Each day, look for ways to be humble. Remind yourself of what the comedian
Woody Allen says, “We’re all bozos on the same bus!” You may be the driver
of the bus or just a passenger — either way you’re a bozo. Every time I think
about that, I feel a profound sense of relief — and it makes it so much harder
to get angry throughout the day. Try getting involved in a community task
without being the person in charge. Find some fairly menial ways to make the
world a better place. (Hint: Beautify your community by collecting trash on
the side of the highway. Or spend a day working for Habitat for Humanity.)
Having a Blessed Day
One of my most memorable chronic-pain classes included three women, all of
whom had suffered from agonizing back and neck pain for many years. Unlike
the majority of my pain clients who respond to my cheerful “How are you
doing this morning?” greeting as they walk through the door either with a
silent shrug or a hostile retort — “How do you think I’m doing?” — these
ladies always came back with “I’m blessed — hope you are.” And when they
left four hours later — sometimes after painful, strenuous fitness training —
the last thing they said was, “Have a blessed day!”
At first, I wasn’t sure how to respond to their “blessing.” Not only was it not a
typical response for patients, it almost seemed incongruent with the agenda of
that setting — pain management. But I soon got used to it, began responding
in kind (“I’m blessed — I hope you are.”), and realized that this was why these
three women weren’t as angry, bitter, depressed, and frightened by ongoing
pain as most of my other clients. Rather than dwell on the painful part of their
day-to-day lives, they were able to view pain and injury as only a part of an
otherwise blessed life. They felt blessed to be alive, to have caring friends, to
have supportive families, to still be mobile enough to attend church on
Sunday — in effect, to have what it took to effectively live with their pain.
Start your day by saying to the first ten people you meet, “Have a blessed
day.” Watch how they respond. And see if they don’t answer, “You, too!” every
time. Along the same line, try ending conversations you have with particu-
larly hostile people with a “Have a blessed day!” and see how they respond.
I’m betting it takes some of the steam (and sting) out of their hostility. It’s
hard to be a jerk to someone who just gave you his blessing!

Chapter 18: Looking to a Higher Power
My three black angels
At the end of the five-week chronic-pain class
(see “Having a Blessed Day” in this chapter),
the same three ladies, all of whom are African
American, surprised me with a gift. They
wanted me to know how much they appreciated
all my hard work in helping them find a way to
continue having a meaningful life despite their
endless pain. Their gift was quite unique —
three wooden black angels. “We wanted you to
know that no matter what comes your way in
life — especially hard times — you always have
three black angels looking out for you.”
I couldn’t have been more touched — I did feel
truly blessed. I then mused, “I wonder how
many white guys have three black angels look-
ing over them?” and we all had a good laugh
and hugs all around. I keep those angels promi-
nently displayed in my office as cherished
mementos. And, on days when I’m down or irri-
tated and fully prepared to snap someone’s
head off, I look at them and instantly feel much
better.

A
strong link exists between anger and a bad mood — you can’t be angry
and in a great mood at the same time. But this link goes beyond a bad
mood: If you’re depressed, anger comes all too easily. In this chapter, I cover
the reasons that depression and anger are so closely connected — including an
alteration in brain chemistry, a pessimistic outlook, and loss of meaningful rela-
tionships. Suppressing anger can also lead to depression — for example, when
you fail to speak out in anger (Chapter 5) or harbor old grudges (Chapter 13).
And, finally, just as with substance use or abuse — nicotine, alcohol, caffeine —
anger can be a way of self-medicating a mood disorder.
A participant in one of my anger-management workshops, when asked to
define anger, described it as “one way I know I’m alive.” Given her rather
depressed tone of voice, I surmised that without the energy surges that anger
provided her, she felt otherwise “emotionally dead” — which, to my way of
thinking, is an apt way to define severe depression.
In this chapter, I also suggest the important role that prescription medication —
antidepressants — can play in anger management. Les, a 47-year-old mechanic,
is a good example of what can happen when you combine so-called “happy
pills” with all the other strategies for reducing toxic anger (all the ones I outline
in this book). Les referred himself for treatment following an incident where he
assaulted his wife. This was the first time he had expressed his anger physi-
cally, but his temper had been an ongoing problem since his early childhood —
as had depression. In addition to having difficulty controlling his anger, Les also
reported having trouble concentrating, worrying constantly, experiencing spon-
taneous crying spells, and feeling “blue” most of the time — all of which had
progressively worsened in recent years.

At first, Les was skeptical about taking medication — he thought that his
problem with anger would either correct itself or get “fixed” by talking to a
therapist. What he didn’t count on was just how much better he would feel
when his antidepressant kicked in — approximately four weeks after he
began taking it and sooner than he could derive any lasting benefit from
counseling. As he put it, “I wasn’t ever happy before — I am now. I wouldn’t
talk with my family when I got mad before — I do now. I couldn’t get a good
night’s sleep before — I can now. I was always tense before — I’m not now.”
All these changes had led to a reduction in the frequency of Les’s angry out-
bursts, both at home and at work.
E-lim-inate the Negative: Maintaining 
a Positive Mood
Have you ever noticed how some people always seem to be in a good mood, no
matter what’s going on in their lives? I had an aunt like that. She lost her par-
ents to illness when she was a young child; was raised along with my mother in
an orphanage; was crippled by an injury from a head-on collision when she was
in her early 20s; was never able to have children; struggled financially all her
life; had a massive stroke in her later years, which left her partially paralyzed;
and spent the last ten years of her life in a nursing home — and, the whole
time, she was positive, never complained, never got angry, and had something
good to say about everyone. Her positive spirit was indestructible!
For years, psychologists really haven’t understood people like my aunt. They
were far too busy studying the opposite kind of people — those who seem to
lack whatever qualities my aunt had that allowed her to transcend life’s many
difficulties. But that’s all beginning to change with the advent of what is called
positive psychology, which identifies and strengthens the assets a person has
(things like optimism, resilience, wisdom, hardiness) to thrive in the face of
adversity and achieve optimal success in life.
In the following sections, I tell you about some behaviors that promote and
maintain a positive mood. Then I tell you what you can do to correct a bad
mood — things like laughing, being optimistic, finding benefits, and creating
an emotional climate in which you can flourish.
Laughter: It really is the best medicine
Laughter is (literally) a painkiller. It can kill both physical and emotional pain.
Studies comparing some type of neutral distraction, relaxation, and laughter
found laughter to be most effective in raising a person’s pain threshold.
Bottom line: Laughter reduces pain sensitivity.
252
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

The same is true for anger sensitivity — how touchy you are and how easily
you can be provoked to anger. In other words, you’re less likely to be
annoyed by something if you’re in good humor than if you’re not. Think of
humor as a shield that protects you from the stinging impact of someone
else’s bad behavior.
Some people seem to have been born with a keen sense of humor. They don’t
have to try to be funny or make themselves and other people laugh — it just
comes naturally. Other people have to look outside themselves to find some-
thing to make them laugh. Some years ago, I had a client who spent time each
day cutting out cartoons from the newspaper and magazines and then hand-
ing them out as “gifts” to people she met throughout the day — I always got
one when she came for therapy. She claimed it not only helped her feel less
depressed about her back pain; it actually made her hurt less. Even after I
quit seeing her for treatment, she would come by my office regularly to drop
off a few cartoons and brighten up my day. Here are some other ways you can
bring some laughter into your life:
 If you have a friend with a good sense of humor, spend time with that
person as often as you can.
 Avoid the serious stuff on TV — especially the news! — and watch things
that are lighthearted, even to the point of being silly.
 Find some movies that make you laugh and watch them repeatedly —
think of it as therapy!
 Eat out in places where people tend to be loud, raucous, and having 
fun. (When I’m in a down mood, I always head straight for a Mexican
restaurant!)
 Spend time with pets. When you get to know them, they can be a riot.
 Go to a bookstore and buy a joke book. (In the long run, it might do you
as much good as a book on anger management!)
 Watch late-night TV. It’s all silly and stupid — just what the doctor
ordered at the end of a long, stressful day.
 Involve yourself in activities that provide good-natured fellowship. You
won’t believe how much laughter floats down the stairs when my wife
meets with her bridge group. I can hardly hear the television!
 Keep visual reminders in your home and office of fun times with friends
and family.
 Close your eyes and revisit a situation where you laughed until your
sides burst.
253
Chapter 19: Staying in a Good Mood

Hanging around with optimists
There is a direct link between your attitude about life and your mood.
Optimists — people who believe that things will generally turn out for the
best — tend to be in a more positive mood than pessimists. Pessimists are
always expecting things not to turn out well (just wait, you’ll see!) and, as a
result, they’re more apt to find themselves anxious, worried, and ready to be
angry when their negative expectations are met.
Attitudes like optimism are formed early in life. They may even, as some
people would argue, reflect inherited dispositions handed down from one
generation to the next. Regardless of their origin, however, they remain fairly
stable from cradle to grave. Even when life seems to be conspiring against
you, if you’re an optimist you tend to envision a more hopeful day some-
where in the future.
Attitudes are contagious. If you hang around with people who have a positive
outlook on life, you’re more likely to feel the same way. The reverse is true if
you hang with a bunch of naysayers who see the worst in everything.
This contagion effect was readily apparent in two groups of chronic-pain
clients who participated in my five-week rehabilitation program. The first
group had five participants — four men and a woman. The woman, despite
her painful injury and greatly altered lifestyle, began the program with a very
optimistic outlook. She laughed, was cheerful throughout the morning, and
was eager to involve herself in all aspects of the rehab experience. The men,
on the other hand, were negative from the outset — hostile, reluctant to par-
ticipate “because it won’t do any good as far as my pain goes,” and argumen-
tative. Unfortunately, by the end of the five weeks, the female patient had
caught the men’s negativity — she no longer laughed, was quiet much of the
time, and less energetic in her participation. They had, in effect, won her over
to their all-negative way of thinking!
254

My gift to the world
It’s ironic that, while I rarely laugh myself (I’m
too serious for my own good!), I’ve always been
able to make other people laugh. When I was a
kid, I learned to use this “gift” as a way to make
friends and deal with my enemies. I was one of
those skinny, weak geeks whom the rest of the
boys liked to bully, and I quickly learned that as
long as I made them laugh, they left me alone.
Even today, when I have a few free minutes in
my day, I often go visit a colleague or call a
friend long-distance and lighten up their day.
They laugh, and that makes me feel good — not
a bad trade-off!

In the second group — three women and a man — the reverse was true. The
women were all positive, and the poor negative guy didn’t have a chance —
by the third week, he was beginning to smile, laugh, and actually look forward
to the classes. He had been converted to a more positive outlook, not just on
pain but on life itself.
I’ve seen this pattern repeated time and time again, and I’m convinced that
one requisite to staying in a good mood is to surround yourself as much as
possible with positive thinking people. It’s the next best thing to being a natu-
rally optimistic person yourself!
Finding the good in the bad
Psychologists have a new name for finding something good in a bad 
situation — it’s called benefit-finding. Studies of patients with a variety of 
catastrophic, disabling illnesses — heart disease, breast cancer, rheumatoid
arthritis, multiple sclerosis — suggest that most people can identify at least
one benefit they derive from being ill. The possibilities include
 An enhanced sense of spirituality (see Chapter 18)
 A greater appreciation for what life offers
 Deeper, more meaningful interpersonal relationships
 A heightened sense of compassion
 Greater introspection — examining one’s inner self
 Greater willingness to openly express emotion
 Improved mood
 Less tension, anxiety, and anger
 Greater sense of mastery in dealing with day-to-day stress
 Increased vigor and activity
 Reduced fatigue-inertia
 Better future health
Being able to find the silver lining was a key to Ann’s ability to endure chronic
neck and back pain. Ann, a divorced mother of three, was only 36 when she
was permanently injured while employed as a nurse. Asked one day during
group therapy by another pain client why she continued to be so upbeat
despite intense pain, she said, “Hey, had I not been injured, I would just be
another working mom who rarely got to spend time with her kids. At least now
I can be part of their lives in a more meaningful way. And that’s a good thing.”
255
Chapter 19: Staying in a Good Mood

Calculating your positivity ratio
Proponents of positive psychology point out the critical role that emotions
like joy, love, and contentment play in helping human beings flourish in the
course of everyday life. Flourishing is the opposite of languishing, which sug-
gests that someone is in a rut, going nowhere, and feeling bad. Languishing is
something I see in all the kids in my school-based anger-management classes.
These are kids who, in addition to being terribly angry and aggressive, aren’t
taking advantage of the positive activities available to them — scholarship,
sports, and organizations requiring cooperative behavior with schoolmates.
I’m not sure they appreciate it when I tell them, “No wonder you’re all so
angry — you’re not part of the good stuff!”
According to Dr. Barbara Fredrickson (of the University of Michigan) and her
colleagues, there is a critical positivity ratio of roughly 3-to-1 (positive emo-
tions over negative ones) that is necessary if you’re to flourish at any point in
your life. Think of it like a recipe — three parts joy/love/surprise to one part
irritation. Anything less than that and it’s a recipe for languishing.
Once a week, take a 24-hour sampling of your emotions — both positive and
negative. Find a quiet time and circumstance, preferably at the end of the day
to review Table 19-1. Circle any feelings or emotions you experienced that
day. Now, count up the positive feelings and divide by the number of negative
ones. This is how you derive you positivity ratio. If the value is below 2.9,
you’re in trouble! If it’s 2.9 or above, you’re more than okay.

Find benefit now — find relief later
In a study of 96 women undergoing treatment
for breast cancer — including radiation,
chemotherapy, and reconstructive surgery —
those who could identify a potential benefit 
of their cancer experience were much less 
anxious, angry, and depressed when reassessed
seven years later. This is yet another good
example of how what you do today may affect
tomorrow’s anger.

or social situation that can make you feel more appreciated, valued, and
excited — and then go for it!
When Your Mood Becomes a Problem
Mood becomes a problem when it is negative, when it persists, and when it is
severe enough to adversely affect your life. All three elements must be present.
No one comes to a mental-health counselor complaining of a persistent, dis-
abling case of joy or happiness. You don’t seek professional help, nor is your
life changed significantly, because of one bad-hair day. And it’s unlikely that
your lifestyle will be greatly altered by one or two mood-related symptoms —
sleepless night, low energy level.
But, if you’re like Lisa, mood is a problem. In her wildest dreams, Lisa would
never have pictured herself feeling the way she does when she wakes up every
morning. “I just dread getting up. I wake up tired even after sleeping all night,
and all I want to do is go back to sleep,” she says. “I just want to run away, go
somewhere where no one can find me. I just hate my life!” Describing how she
feels is enough to make Lisa cry — which she does quite often lately. Lisa eats,
but she has no appetite. And she can’t relax — “I feel like there’s a clenched fist
in my chest all the time.”
257
Chapter 19: Staying in a Good Mood

Lisa is suffering — and I do mean suffering! — from clinical depression, a con-
dition so prevalent that some have called it the “common cold of mental ill-
ness.” To determine if you’re depressed, think about how you’ve felt the past
two weeks and answer the following questions:
 Do you feel sad at times?
 Do you not enjoy things the way you used to?
 Are you discouraged about your future?
 Do you find yourself less interested in other people than you used to be?
 Do you cry for no apparent reason?
 Do you wake up early and have trouble getting back to sleep?
 Have you lost your appetite?
 Are you more irritated than usual?
 Does it take extra effort for you to get started doing something?
 Do you feel tired or exhausted most of the time?
 Do you ever think about harming yourself?
 Are you less interested in sex than you used to be?
If you answer yes to at least four of these questions, you may be suffering from
a mood disorder. Consult with a physician or mental-health professional to see
if this is something for which you need treatment.

Looking for the last time you felt good
You can tell how long a person has been
depressed by asking a simple question: When
is the last time you really felt good — positive,
happy, relaxed, satisfied — for a sustained
period of time (say, one month)? If you answer
with statements like “I don’t know — it’s been
so long,” “Oh, at least a year or more,” or
“Before my father died, five years ago,” that’s
how long you’ve suffered from depression.
In the normal course of life, moods vary quite a
bit, ranging from brief periods of exhilaration
and joy to episodes of momentary despair and
gloom. In between these extremes, you can also
experience the everyday blues, mild excite-
ment, or a feeling of neutrality — neither posi-
tive nor negative. If you visit all these different
mood states on a fairly regular basis, the people
who know, love, and work with you probably
describe you as “moody.” And — as you may
have guessed — moody people are more prone
to anger.

The Anger-Depression Link
Psychiatrist John Ratey and colleague Catherine Johnson, in their book
Shadow Syndromes, say, “Most people would rather be angry than terribly
sad.” They go on to describe how anger can unwittingly be used to wake up a
“sluggish brain.” In short, angry outbursts can be a way of self-medicating a
mood disorder.
I find this true much more for men than for women, basically for two reasons:
 It is more acceptable for men to display anger openly (it’s often regarded
as a sign of strength) than to appear sad or depressed (perceived as a
sign of weakness).
 Just the opposite is true for women — being depressed seems quite nat-
ural for women (by virtue of its association with childbirth, the so-called
empty-nest syndrome, and menopause) whereas public displays of anger
are seen as unusual and unladylike.
Grief — a feeling of deep, intense sorrow or mourning over the loss of a signif-
icant attachment — is a normal emotion. It can mimic depression, but it isn’t
the same thing. If you suffer the loss of a loved one, you should grieve. It
means you loved that person and you miss him — your life will take some
readjusting because your loved one is gone. In fact, if you didn’t grieve over
someone you loved or were attached to, that would be curious.
When my sister died at age 40, after years of poor and declining health, I was
fine (or so I thought!) for a few months until suddenly, out of the blue, I found
myself crying uncontrollably, raging uncontrollably, drinking uncontrollably,
unable to sleep, with my head full of strange, foreboding thoughts. I wrote in
my diary at the time,
I’m calm for the moment, but probably that will change any time. Woke
up this morning feeling not rested and felt shaky inside — agitated.
Quickly got upset and on the defensive with family this morning even
though things started off well. As the morning progressed, my emotions
began to bounce all over the place, even to the point of tears a couple of
times. I’m crying for help and no one hears me!
My condition worsened and progressed over a period of years. People don’t
grieve over the loss of a loved one for five years, no matter how much they
loved the person. But as I found out (the hard way!) normal grief can quickly
transition into a state of clinical depression, which, unfortunately, in some
cases can last forever — or at least seem to.
The most dramatic illustration of how long a mood problem can persist comes
from a client — a very nice woman in her mid-50s — who came to me for help
some years ago. When she sat on my couch, I asked her “How are you today?”
She began to sob uncontrollably and did so nonstop for the next 20 minutes.
259
Chapter 19: Staying in a Good Mood

My second question to her was, “How long have you felt this bad?” She
replied, “Sixteen years!” and began to cry again. When she once again
stopped, I asked her, “Why in the world did you wait so long to get some
help?” With the saddest look on her face that I think I’ve ever seen, she said, “I
just kept telling myself that it would get better — but it never did.”
The more depressed you are, the more negative your view of the world. In
fact, in extreme states of depression, people can become paranoid — harbor-
ing a fixed belief that everyone, even those closest to them, is out to cause
them harm. Depressed folks are more apt to read malicious intent into the
actions of others (“You did that on purpose!”). And, because of lack of sleep,
decreased energy, and an increasingly self-critical attitude — all symptoms of
depression — they struggle more in keeping up with the demands of their
day and, thus, are more easily frustrated. It’s amazing how, when you’re no
longer depressed, the things that used to set you off into a tirade now, at
best, only annoy you.
Psychologist James Averill at the University of Massachusetts has noted that
only about 10 percent of people act out their anger publicly (for example, by
yelling at, pushing, hitting, and smashing things and people). These are the
so-called outrageous people. The remaining 90 percent do just the opposite —
they keep their anger in. These folks I call “in-rageous.”
Keeping anger inside may sound like good news to you — that is, until you
find out just how toxic anger turned inward can be. The anger-health check-
list in Chapter 3 provides a host of examples of how anger literally makes
people ill to the point of shortening their lives. As noted in this same chapter,
in-rageousness can also:
 Rob you of your energy
 Contribute to poor health habits like overeating, smoking, and abusing
alcohol
 Increase the likelihood that you’ll engage in risky sexual behavior
 Adversely affect your career
 Precede road rage
 Lead to divorce
 Take all the joy out of life
 Poison the health of all those around you
Anger and depression share a common chemical pathway in the brain — a
neurotransmitter called serotonin. My former colleague at Duke University
Medical Center, Dr. Redford Williams, has researched this chemical connec-
tion and in his excellent book Anger Kills (coauthored with his wife, Virginia)
he argues that what he has called the Hostility Syndrome — high levels of
anger and aggressive behavior — could, in fact, be a “serotonin deficiency
disorder.” A wealth of psychiatric research shows that a chemical imbalance
260
Part V: Lifestyle Changes That Improve More Than Your Anger 

involving a shortfall in serotonin is similarly a root cause of depression. Finally,
a shortage of this important brain chemical is also associated with smoking,
increased appetite and weight gain, and alcohol consumption — which are
symptoms of both toxic anger and depression. These commonalities should
make you consider the possibility that rageful tantrums (anger out) and
depression (anger in) are basically two sides of the same chemical coin.
Fixing the Problem
So, what do you do if you find yourself in a depressed mood? Simple: You get
help. The good news is that psychiatrists probably know more about how to
treat depression than they do any other mental-health problem. (For a com-
plete and comprehensive discussion of depression and its treatment, turn to
Depression For Dummies by Laura L. Smith, PhD, and Charles H. Elliott, PhD
[published by Wiley].)
No single method has been proven most effective in providing relief from
depression. I suggest a range of therapies that, when used alone or in combi-
nation, enhance your mood — and, thus reduce your anger. The more intense
your depression, the more necessary it is to combine treatment strategies —
for example, when I see folks who are moderately to severely depressed, I
always recommend a course of psychotherapy along with antidepressant
medication. My years of clinical experience have taught me that when clients
are that depressed, counseling or drugs alone will most often prove ineffec-
tive. Finally, there is no magic wand when it comes to treating depression —
believe me, I wish there were! — so therapists, patients, and their families all
have to find how to be patient with the process.
Despite what some well-meaning mental-health researchers suggest, I don’t
believe that most human beings spontaneously recover from episodes of clini-
cal depression. What I have found to be true, however, is that depression is a
progressive illness and the longer you go without appropriate treatment, the
worse you feel. Bottom line: The sooner a depressed person seeks help, the
less that person suffers in the long run.
Taking the “happy pill”: Antidepressants
More people rely on antidepressant drugs to “fix” their mood than any of the
other forms of therapy available. In part, this is because we live in a world
where we have a pill for everything and society tells us that pills can fix any-
thing — cheaply and quickly.

You could see how much better Polly felt by her increased sense of humor.
When she first came for treatment, she was so depressed that she basically
spent the counseling hour mostly crying and talking negatively about herself.
But three months later, she was one funny lady. I remember commenting on
how nice she looked one day by saying, “That’s a pretty dress — you look
nice today.” Her instant reply was, “Prozac — the Prozac made me buy it!”
And then we both laughed. Another time, I commented on how unique her
earrings were — again she responded, “Prozac — the Prozac made me buy
them!” Another good laugh. Polly would be the first to tell you that counsel-
ing helped her get her life back together and put an end to her suffering, but
at the same time she acknowledged the important role that medication
played in her recovery.
Depressed patients make two big mistakes when they take antidepressant
drugs:
 They don’t take the medication long enough to achieve the desired phar-
macological benefit. Typically, it takes four weeks before you begin to
notice any type of sustained improvement in your mood and six months
before you obtain the full, lasting relief you hope for.
 As soon as they feel the least bit better, they quit taking the pills — and
then all too soon they’re back to square one.
Tyler was a businessman, which meant that he was used to achieving results
quickly. When I told him I thought he was sufficiently depressed to warrant a
trial of medication, he was skeptical but went along anyway. He came in a
week after he started the medication and the first thing he said was “I don’t
think the pills are helping me at all.” I reminded him that antidepressants typ-
ically take two to four weeks before you begin to notice any difference in your
mood. The second week, he came in saying the same thing — “They’re not
working!” Third week, same thing — and so on. Until the eighth week, when
Tyler came in looking very upbeat and said, “Doc, I don’t know what hap-
pened, but all of a sudden I feel a whole lot better than I have in months. I’m
sleeping better, laughing more, have more energy, you name it.” All of a

I’ve been waiting for your call
When I experienced my first bout of depression,
I quickly sought help from a psychiatrist I knew
from my days at Duke University Medical
Center. As it turned out, I wasn’t that depressed
so after three or four visits I felt much better.
Sensing my “flight into health,” my therapist told
me I needed to make a decision — whether to
stop now and hope the symptoms didn’t return
or continue on with therapy to better under-
stand why I had gotten depressed in the first
place and prevent it from occurring again. I took
the low road and quit going. Less than a year
later, when all the emotional wheels fell off at
the same time, I called him frantically asking for
help. I’ll never forget what he said over the
phone — “I’ve been waiting for your call.”

sudden, he was a believer. The good news is that he hung in there all those
weeks and gave the medication a chance to work.
Because antidepressants act as sedatives, they can have a more pronounced
effect on people who are 50 years old and up. Physicians specializing in
geropsychiatry are best able to manage antidepressant medications in the
over-50 crowd.
All medication — even aspirin — has side effects. If you’re taking medication
for depression, be sure to ask your physician (or your pharmacist) what to
expect — dry mouth, weight gain, hypersensitivity to the sun — when you
take the drug. And don’t be afraid to call the doctor if you think you’re having
some unusual side effect — that’s what doctors are there for!
Antidepressant medication only works if you follow your doctor’s orders
about when and how to take the pills. Following instructions assures maxi-
mum effectiveness. Antidepressants aren’t like most other types of medica-
tion — they aren’t designed to be taken “as needed.” To restore a healthy and
balanced brain chemistry, you have to take the pills every day — regardless
of how you feel. Otherwise, they don’t have a chance to build up in your
brain to the point where they do you some good.
The talking cure: Psychotherapy
Therapy works! I don’t say that simply because that’s how I’ve made my
living for the past decades — I say it because I’ve been on the receiving end
of the so-called talking cure. Psychotherapy is a process that not only saved
my life, it changed my life for the better. In essence, I got much more benefit
than I ever bargained for.
When most people think about counseling, they conjure up this Freudian
image of lying on someone’s couch and regressing back to childhood in order
to relive all the painful experiences of the past (see the discussion on cathar-
sis in Chapter 5). In today’s world, nothing could be farther from the truth.
Counseling is primarily about helping people who suffer from depression —
and too much anger — gain insight into all those things that helped them get
sick in the first place and then eliminating as many of those things as possible
so that they can get well. Much of the information in this book would — and
should — be part of what counselors and clients talk about. The emphasis
should be on what you’re doing today that is keeping you in a bad mood — not
what you were thinking, feeling, or doing 30 years ago.
Cognitive therapy (examining how you think about life and how that in turn
affects your mood) is one of the more popular strategies for defeating depres-
sion. Thoughts like “I have to be perfect in everything I do or else people
won’t love me” and “It’s wrong to ask people for help — that only lets them
know that you’re weak and incompetent” can slowly, but surely, lead you into
a mood disorder.

Chapter 19: Staying in a Good Mood

By all means, if you’re in a funk or having the proverbial bad-hair day, reach
out to friends and loved ones for support and comfort. But if you’re suffering
from clinical depression, you need more than what friends can provide.
Healing through exercise
A plethora of scientific evidence supports the fact that regular physical exer-
cise improves mood in non-depressed people and, more important, can facili-
tate recovery in someone who is clinically depressed. What is also clear is that:
 It doesn’t matter what type of exercise you choose. I heard someone
ask a friend of mine who owns and operates a gym, “What’s the best
kind of exercise?” His response was, “The kind you’ll agree to do!”
 It doesn’t have to be strenuous to be effective. The key seems to be that
you incorporate it into your lifestyle so that it’s not just an add-on —
doing it only when you have time or feel like it.
When it comes to using exercise to enhance mood, the best regimen seems to
be a combination of:
 Aerobic exercise, such as walking or jogging, for endurance
 Weight-lifting for strength
 Stretching exercises for flexibility
If you’re depressed and you choose to exercise regularly (three times a
week), you can expect to:
 Be better able to concentrate
 Sleep better
 Show a greater interest in sex
 Have more energy

A shrinking network
Recent surveys indicate that the typical size of
our social support network — those folks who
can serve as confidantes, whose advice we
trust, and who love us no matter what — has
shrunk drastically. For example, in 1985,
Americans reported having an average of three
close friends. By 2006, the number had dropped
to two. Even more troubling is the fact that 25
percent of those surveyed indicated that they
had no one — not one living soul — whom they
could turn to in a time of need. All of this has
transpired at the same time that rates of depres-
sion have skyrocketed. Coincidence? I don’t
think so.

 Be less tense
 Enjoy life more in general
 Feel less alienated from those around you
 Make decisions easier
 Be more optimistic
 Complain less about minor physical ailments
 Be less self-absorbed
 Think more clearly
 Be less obsessive
 Be more active
 Be less irritable
Ironically, people who need to exercise because they’re depressed are the ones
most likely to quit sooner rather than later. One thing about depression is that
it keeps people from being disciplined and persistent — sticking with things.
Here’s where having an exercise buddy — someone who understands where
you are emotionally — comes in handy; that person’s job is to keep you going.
Depressed people tend to be more isolated and spend far too much time alone,
which only makes their negative mood persist. For that reason alone, I recom-
mend that you do your exercise in a fitness facility (such as a gym or your local
YMCA) where you’re in contact with lots of people. Even if you don’t talk to
anyone, just being around other human beings will make you feel better.

Type A’s and exercise
A former student of mine, Dr. James
Blumenthal, who has since become a prominent
figure in the field of health psychology, con-
ducted a study at Duke University Medical
Center, in which he recruited Type A’s and Type
B’s who were free of coronary heart disease to
enroll in a supervised ten-week exercise pro-
gram consisting of a combination of stretching
exercises and continuous walking/jogging.
He and his colleagues found that exercise led
to a significant reduction in Type A behavior —
including a 36 percent reduction in hostile/com-
petitive behavior — which was comparable to
that achieved with more conventional psycho-
logical therapy. Exercise didn’t affect the Type
B folks, but then they were more relaxed and
easygoing to begin with.

Re-placement therapy
Depression is often described as the emotion of meaningful loss. Freud called
it melancholia — a feeling of loss expressed through sadness. The more
meaningful the loss — such as the death of a loved one, a child leaving home
to go to college or get married, the loss of the best job you ever had — the
more severe and persistent the resulting depression. One strategy for coping
with this type of unwanted, negative change in life circumstances is what I
like to call re-placement therapy. I’m not suggesting that you replace that
which you’ve lost (you probably can’t — otherwise, you would). What I’m
suggesting is that you re-place the energy, sense of commitment, and feeling
of emotional connection you had in that past relationship, job, or role as
parent into something else that has a future. Otherwise, you’ll spend each
day mourning — as well as being angry over — what’s not in your life rather
than appreciating what is.
I was once asked to help a young woman who had lost her 8-year-old daugh-
ter to illness. The girl had died just before the Christmas holidays three years
earlier, and each year after her death, the woman ruined the family holiday
by dragging out the gifts that she had under the tree at the time the little girl
died. It made her other children terribly sad, and her husband spent most of
his time drinking as a way of not dealing with the whole thing. I suggested
that she think about finding a new home for those gifts (in effect, re-placing
them)— for example, as gifts for underprivileged kids. Talk about anger —
she came close to physically assaulting me, all the while shouting, “Those are
my daughter’s gifts and they’re going to be under that tree when she comes
back!” She was fully intent on continuing to deny the reality of her child’s
death and was perfectly willing to remain severely depressed as a result.

Honey, you need a dog
I love animals, particularly bassett hounds, and
I found myself quite distraught some years ago
after one of our hounds got hit by a car and died.
For weeks, I moped around the house, staying
to myself, and talking myself into the idea of
never ever having another dog — it’s just too
painful when you lose them.
One evening, my wife came home to find me sit-
ting and staring at the television set. She
announced, “Honey, we need to get you
another dog.” The tone of her voice suggested
that she wasn’t asking me if that’s what I
wanted to do, but telling me that that’s what we
were going to do — and, we did. Given my his-
tory of depression and the fact that our children
had long since left home, that was a pretty
smart move on her part. She prevented what
could easily have become another bout of
depression. Just one more reason I’m glad I
married her!

Another client’s story had a more positive outcome. Like the other woman,
Fred lost his teenage son to a tragic illness. He had progressed from grief to a
full-blown episode of depression by the time he finally took his family and
friends’ advice to get some professional help. Interestingly, one of the things
he decided to do — after medication gave him more energy — was to use his
skills as a photographer to take pictures of all the youngsters who were in his
son’s high-school class. He did this free — as a gift to those young people
who were healthy and had outlived his son. He felt connected again in a small
way to his son, which helped reduce his feelings of loss. Fred knew he could
never replace his son, but he came to learn — through therapy — that he
could re-place his love in other young people and make a difference in both
his life and theirs.

Managing Anger
in Key
Relationships

In this part . . .
You’ll see the effects of toxic anger on three types of
key relationships: career, family, and loved ones. Is
your workplace a battleground? Are you a loser when it
comes to effective parenting? Are you locked into a loving,
but angry relationship? If so, this part of the book will pro-
vide you with everything you need to know to avoid coun-
terproductive work behavior, improve your negotiating
skills, create an anger-free family atmosphere, adapt to
the changing role of a parent, avoid ending up being an
angry couple, inoculate yourself from abusive anger, and
keep your cool when loved ones are losing theirs. In
effect, this part is a guide to turning hostility into har-
mony with all the key players in your life.

Chapter 20
At Work
In This Chapter
 Realizing that it’s not all about you
 Seeking win-win solutions
 Competing without confrontation
 Getting beyond impasse
I
n this chapter, I highlight the role that anger management plays at work —
the place where most people spend the majority of their time. But before
diving in, consider these questions:
 While you’re at work, do you often find yourself daydreaming rather
than doing your job?
 Have you ever come to work late without permission?
 Have you ever made fun of a co-worker’s personal life?
 Have you ever told someone outside work what a lousy employer 
you have?
 Have you ever done something at work to make a fellow employee 
look bad?
If you answered yes to any of these questions — and, don’t worry, these situ-
ations are common — you’re engaging in what occupational psychologists
call counterproductive work behavior (CWB). CWB is any behavior by an
employee that is intended to harm the organization or its members; it ranges
from idle workplace gossip to acts of physical violence. The cost of CWB to
industry: a whopping $200 billion in direct costs (such as theft) as well as
untold billions in indirect costs (having to do with employee inefficiency).
The number-one cause of CWB? You guessed it: anger!
In this chapter, I tell you how CWB plays itself out in the workplace, which
types of personalities are most prone to CWB, how you can be competitive at
work without being counterproductive, and how you can be more civil in
your dealings with co-workers — by being an anger-free employee.

Recognizing Counterproductive 
Work Behavior
Recognizing counterproductive work behavior — in yourself and in others —
can be tough. In part, that’s because we think of much of it as “normal” at-
work behavior — coming to work late or taking a longer break than you’re
allowed to. In addition, the majority of CWB is passive and nonviolent in
nature. Here are some typical examples:
 Failing to report a problem and allowing it to get worse
 Ignoring someone at work
 Withholding needed information from a colleague
 Staying home and saying you’re sick when you aren’t
 Trying to look busy when you aren’t
 Refusing to help a co-worker
 Intentionally coming late to a meeting
 Working slowly when things need to be done fast
 Refusing to accept an assignment
 Leaving work earlier than you’re allowed to
 Avoiding returning a phone call to someone you should
 Purposely failing to follow instructions

Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships
Am I late? Sorry
Edith, a 51-year-old senior vice-president of an
ad agency, knew that all employees — espe-
cially the executive staff — were supposed to
attend the midday meeting, where the new CEO
would be introduced. But Edith was angry —
and she had been since the news of a major
reorganization had been announced some
weeks earlier and, along with the others, she
was told that she would have a new boss. Edith
had been trying not to let her anger show. But
here she was coming into the packed audito-
rium 15 minutes late, distracting everyone from
the CEO’s opening remarks as she made her
way down front. It was quite a show! There was
no mistaking the message Edith was conveying
— “Screw you all!” No one made any mention
of her tardiness that day, but no one was sur-
prised when she submitted her resignation
(after being asked to) three weeks later.

Less often, CWB constitutes more active destructive or injurious behaviors
such as:
 Purposely damaging a piece of equipment
 Stealing something belonging to your employer
 Insulting a co-worker’s work performance
 Starting an argument with a co-worker
 Making an obscene gesture to a co-worker
 Threatening another employee with violence
 Hitting or pushing someone at work
 Purposely wasting supplies/materials
 Intentionally doing your work incorrectly
 Starting a harmful rumor about another employee
 Playing a mean prank on someone at work
 Acting nasty or rude to a customer or client
273
Chapter 20: At Work
Sound familiar?
In a survey of 74 employees at one worksite, the
following question was posed: How often have
you observed each of the following behaviors
on your present job? Here are their top 15
responses, starting with the most common:
 Complaining about insignificant things at
work
 Coming to work late without permission
 Taking longer breaks than allowed
 Ignoring someone at work
 Being nasty/rude to a client or co-worker
 Daydreaming rather than doing work
 Leaving work early without permission
 Trying to look busy when they aren’t
 Blaming colleagues for errors that they
made
 Telling people outside work what a lousy
place they work at
 Insulting fellow employees about their job
performance
 Refusing to help out at work
 Avoiding returning phone calls that are
important
 Making fun of people at work
 Verbally abusing a co-worker
Interestingly, I find almost the identical same list
(and rankings) every time I conduct a survey of
CWB, regardless of the type of work involved.

Look at the lists of counterproductive work behaviors and make note of
which ones you’ve engaged in lately — say, the last three weeks. Do you
engage in any of these behaviors on a fairly regular basis — once or twice a
week? Pick one of these and tell yourself, “I’m not going to express my anger
this way anymore.” Then use some of the anger-management strategies out-
lined later in this chapter instead.
Avoidance versus aggression
CWB is an employee coping strategy. It’s one of the ways you deal with work
stress. The motivation behind CWB is always retaliation — which makes
sense because the number-one cause of this kind of behavior is anger. When
someone makes you mad at work, CWB is your way of leveling the playing
field. And each time you make someone else angry, you’re giving that person
a reason to engage in CWB.
Most CWB is the result of interpersonal conflict — between co-workers and
between supervisors and employees. The more conflict there is, the more
counterproductive behavior you can expect. Conflict resolution and CWB go
hand in hand.
Employees typically adopt one of two response styles when they engage in
CWB: avoidance or aggression. Avoidance means you disengage in a variety of
ways from getting the job done — coming in late or ignoring someone.
Aggression means you attack the source of your anger — bullying a subordi-
nate or insulting a customer. It’s that old fight-or-flight pattern I talk about
throughout this book (see Chapter 4, for example).
Person versus organization
Employees also differ in terms of where they direct their CWB. About 50 per-
cent of the time, people are apt to retaliate against a person — insulting a
fellow worker about their performance. The other 50 percent of the time,
people take their anger out on the organization — destroying property. Either
way, it disrupts the workplace and takes away from the bottom line.
Aggressive employees are three times more likely to retaliate against people
with whom they work, whereas avoidant employees are more likely to satisfy
their anger by engaging in CWB directed toward their place of employment.
274
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships

Which of these profiles do you fit? Do some self-examination and ask yourself
why — “Why do I always attack my team members when I get frustrated or
irritated?” or “Why do I always run away from my anger and the issues that
underlie it?” Avoidance usually results from fear. What are you afraid of —
losing your job, losing control of your temper after you get started, what?
Attack typically implies that you are dealing with an enemy. Are your co-
workers really your enemies? Is this work or is it war? Is it because you have
a combative personality and, thus, everything inevitably becomes a war?
275
Chapter 20: At Work
Understanding the aggressive personality at work
Some people have more of an aggressive style
of interacting with the world than other people
do. By aggressive, I don’t necessarily mean that
you intentionally attack or seek to harm others,
just that you seem to move against the world as
opposed to going with the flow. Whether this is
good or bad depends on which type of aggres-
sive personality you are.
Katherine, a 34-year-old, up-and-coming junior
executive in a nonprofit organization, is a clas-
sic example of what I call an achievement-
driven personality. She goes well beyond just
being achievement oriented. She’s driven — all
her energies work toward achieving success in
her career. Katherine is extremely task oriented,
has a really competitive nature, and is forceful
when it comes to pursuing goals. She is direct in
her communications — including how she
expresses anger — leaving little doubt as to
where she stands on issues. Those who work
with her admire her determined spirit. She’s not
a talker — she’s a doer! The only time she gets
angry is when she becomes frustrated by obsta-
cles that slow her down in her efforts to be effi-
cient and get the job done. If you can keep up
with her, she’s your best friend and easy to work
with and for.
Kelly, on the other hand, is more combative in
how she approaches work. She, too, is highly
competitive, but she tends to come across more
confrontational in her dealings with others. If
something goes wrong, she’s in your face in a
heartbeat! She’s impatient, intense, and she can
be quite demanding of those she works with —
“Get that report to me by the end of the day and
no excuses!” Ask anyone in the office and he’ll
tell you what a dominant personality she has.
She’s the type who has the first — and last —
word on every subject. And, yes, she’s angry a
lot. But, her anger — unlike Katherine’s — is not
linked to frustration; rather, it simply serves as
fuel for satisfying her combative personality.
Kelly reminds me of a legendary football coach
who was once described as “a guy who could
walk into an empty locker room and start a fight!”
Both styles of aggressiveness are linked to the
Type A behavior pattern, which typifies a pre-
ponderance of employees in western industrial-
ized countries (like the United States). The good
news, however, is that the link is strongest for the
achievement-driven, rather than the combative,
style. This possibly explains why the vast major-
ity (84 percent) of Type A’s don’t succumb to early
coronary heart disease and other stress-related
illnesses. On the other hand, if you’re one of
those combative, angry Type A’s, you may be a
health accident waiting to happen! (To prevent
this, consider the advice offered in Chapter 10 on
how to become a Type B.)

Knowing Where to Look
Not everyone is susceptible to counterproductive work behavior. Clearly, if
you’re experiencing toxic anger — that is, intense anger than occurs on a
daily basis (see Chapter 2) — you’re a prime candidate. I estimate that some-
where between 25 and 40 percent of the work population fit this profile — a
significant problem!
The disgruntled employee
Employees likely to engage in CWB often exhibit one or more of the following
signs of disguised anger:
 They seem disinterested in their work.
 They’re generally disagreeable at work.
 They show clear signs of distress.
 They’re discouraged about how their careers are progressing.
 They keep their distance from other team members.
 They’re highly distrustful of their superiors.
 They frequently appear distracted while completing a task.
 They show disrespect to those higher up in the organization.
 They’re disenchanted about the mission of the organization.
 They verbalize disappointment about issues of salary and promotion.
 They’re pretty much disgruntled, disgusted, and disheartened by every-
thing that goes on during the workday.
As I suggest in my earlier book ANGER-FREE: Ten Basic Steps to Managing 
Your Anger (Quill, 2000), most people don’t go around telling everyone within
earshot that they’re angry, pissed, or even annoyed. Most people express
their anger in more subtle, politically correct terminology — but it’s anger
nevertheless.
Aaron, a 58-year-old urban planner, was definitely a disgruntled employee —
and he made no bones about it. For 22 years, he had worked at a job he thor-
oughly enjoyed and that consistently rewarded him for his efforts. Then he
decided to accept a preretirement package. For a long time, Aaron had
wanted to move his family to a warmer climate and phase himself into full
retirement. At first, his plan seemed to be working . He moved south and took
276
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships

a job with a salary comparable to what he had previously. But then, after two
years, the company unexpectedly reorganized and laid off a large number of
employees — including Aaron. Despite all efforts, the only job he could find
in that location that fit his résumé paid him much less than he felt he was
worth. He took the job, hoping that if he worked hard and gave his employer
his usual 120 percent, he would eventually receive a substantial increase in
compensation. But, as it turned out, that wasn’t in the cards, because his
educational background — an associate’s degree — prevented him from
moving up in pay grade. He was at odds with company policy. Given his age,
he couldn’t afford to just quit, and he didn’t want to move his family again.
Aaron was stuck! All he could do was spend his time complaining of just
about everything — no matter how insignificant. His complaining, as you can
imagine, did not sit well with his employer, who finally advised him to either
stop complaining or leave.
Aaron was at a crossroads. He needed help immediately — not five years of
on-the-couch therapy. So, I suggested he do the following to manage his anger
(and you can do the same in your life):
 Accept the reality of the situation. To a large extent, Aaron was disgrun-
tled because he refused to accept that he was dealing with an “immov-
able” object — company policy. Complaining was his way of trying to pry
his employer loose from that policy — to make an exception in his case.
 Stop personalizing the situation. Aaron was angry because he believed
the policy was directed at him. I asked him, “Do all the other employees
have to abide by this policy?” His answer, without hesitation, was yes.
So, I reminded him, “This really isn’t about you at all. It’s just the way
they do business.” He agreed.
 Write down your feelings. To defuse some of the anger that Aaron was
carrying around — which was leaking out in the form of complaints — I
recommended that he take 20 minutes a day and write out his anger (see
Chapter 9).
 Pull back on your efforts. Aaron needed to stop giving 120 percent to
his employer — working overtime without pay. His only rationale for
this was that it was a means to an end — the end being a pay raise. I
reminded him that his employer wasn’t exploiting him, he was exploiting
himself — and, that’s not healthy!
 Engage in some positive thinking. Aaron’s anger was also the result of
the fact that this whole situation was constantly on his mind. The psy-
chological term for that process is rumination. Because Aaron admitted
he had little success in distracting himself from this problem, I sug-
gested instead that he simply find something else — something positive
and something that he had some control over — to ruminate about.
(Chapter 4 offers some possibilities.)
277
Chapter 20: At Work

 Find some benefit in what you do. I advised Aaron to think about his
current job and come up with something positive. In other words, “What
are you not complaining about? Salary aside, what works for you?”
Aaron needed a more balanced view of his employment situation to ease
away some of his angry feelings.
 Get some exercise. Regular exercise is a good way of “exorcising” not
only physical toxins in the body but also emotional toxins like anger.
Forty-five minutes in a gym three day a week can do wonders for your
disposition.
 Forgive, forgive, forgive. Aaron was carrying around what I call yester-
day’s anger, and it was becoming burdensome both to him and his
employer. The only way I know to unload this burden is forgiveness (see
Chapter 13). Aaron needed to forgive himself for taking early retirement
only to find himself in this mess, and he needed to forgive his employer
for having what he considered an archaic promotion policy.
By following these suggestions, Aaron got “unstuck,” not from the financial real-
ities of his job, but from the negative emotion — anger — that accompanied it.
He still had to watch his pennies, but he was no longer a disgruntled man.
The self-centered employee
Some years ago, I had the distinct pleasure of meeting a delightful, energetic
psychologist, Dr. Lisa Penny at the University of South Florida, who educated
me about the relationship between big egos (the technical term for this is
narcissism), anger, and counterproductive work behavior. As it turns out, the
bigger your ego (that is, the more self-centered you are), the more easily
angered you are at work and, in turn, the more likely you are to engage in
CWB. Although no one likes to be constrained at work — interrupted by
others, inadequately trained, lacking the resources you need to complete the
job satisfactorily — self-centered employees take these constraints person-
ally (Why are you doing this to me?) and react with anger.
How do you know if you fall into this category? Here are some clues:
 You tend to be self-absorbed in what you’re doing and unaware of
(and unconcerned about) what your colleagues are doing. You aren’t a
team player.
 You tend to have a clear sense of entitlement. For example, you might
say things like, “You owe me respect” and “I have a right to that raise or
promotion.”
278
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships

 You can’t put yourself in the other guy’s shoes whenever there’s a 
conflict of some sort or difference of opinion. You just keep reiterating
what you want, how you see things, and why your solution is the right one.
 You tend to be grandiose — feeling as though you’re somehow special
when it comes to working with others or completing a project. You
expect your co-workers to defer to you because of your power, brilliant
ideas, and charismatic personality.
 You tend to exploit others at work — that is, always use others to meet
your agenda regardless of the cost to your fellow employees. And, to
add insult to injury, you get angry if your co-workers don’t appreciate
the fact that you chose them to exploit!
 You tend to self-reference a lot. The words I, me, and mine seem to per-
meate your speech no matter what the topic.
What if you’re tired of being so self-centered? What do you do to change?
Here are a couple of strategies:
 When you find yourself thinking like a self-centered employee (“Why are
these people in my way?”), counteract that by thinking instead, “I’m sure
these folks have important things to do, just like I do. The problem is
we’re both trying to do them at the exact same time. Maybe if I help
them, they’ll help me.”
 Stop demanding that your co-workers do what you want — this goes
along with a sense of entitlement — and instead request that they do what
you want. You’ll be surprised at how much more receptive they are!
 Spend more time trying to look at things from other people’s perspec-
tive. Become more attuned to the people around you — to what they’re
thinking and feeling.
 Remember that life is a two-way street. The more understanding and
sympathetic you are to those you work with, the more they respond that
way to you. Not a bad deal, huh?
 Just as your mother taught you, always say “please” and “thank you” with
every exchange during the workday. It’s the glue of a civilized workforce.
279
Chapter 20: At Work
Where do these people come from?
Self-centered employees are more likely to be
first-born or only children. They’re more likely to
be male. They’re more likely to have fathers who
encouraged them to be independent while
growing up. Their fathers were also more likely
to use monetary rewards to get them to comply
as children. Who wouldn’t feel special if she
actually got paid for doing the very same things
other kids do without being compensated.

Improving Your Negotiating Skills
Most of what you do when you get to work each day involves some type of
negotiating. Negotiation is nothing more than an effort between two or more
employees aimed at resolving a conflict of interests. I’m always amused when
I’m consulted by companies to coach managers and executives to make sure
“everyone is on the same page.” Companies seem to think that it’s normal for
their employees to be like-minded and are always surprised (and sometimes
downright angry) when this isn’t the case.
Negotiations always involve emotions — because the negotiators are human
beings. But that’s only a problem if the emotions in play are negative. If nego-
tiators are in a positive emotional state — excited, optimistic — they tend to
be cooperative and conciliatory. This more often leads to a win-win solution,
where both parties come away feeling like they’ve gotten something they
wanted. If either or both negotiators, however, are in a negative emotional
state — angry, pessimistic — things tend to be much more competitive and
neither party is comfortable making concessions. If no one concedes, you’re
at an impasse. No one walks away a winner!
Negotiators respond to their opponent’s emotions. The best way to ensure a
positive outcome is to start with a smile. That, believe it or not, sets the tone
for everything that follows. Start with a look of irritation on your face and
you’ll have a hard row to hoe. Begin by emphasizing some point of possible
agreement (hard to do if you’re angry — but worth the effort); doing so sets a
positive tone before getting down to differences of opinion. Remind yourself
that, even though the other parties are your opponents, they are not the
enemy (one of the ten anger-freeing thoughts listed in Chapter 25). And, last,
if you must be angry when you enter into some type of negotiation, try to
express your anger constructively (details in Chapter 11).
Creating a Positive Work Environment
Anger at work is not isolated to one particular employee, one specific
exchange or circumstance, or one identifiable issue — for example, work
overload. Individual emotions originate within the general context of the
overall work environment. And that context (or climate) varies considerably
from one work setting to another. Walk into any work situation — from a fac-
tory floor to a corporate boardroom — and after about five minutes observ-
ing people at work, you can tell whether the climate is hostile (people at each
280

other’s throats), sad (too many lost opportunities, too much turnover in per-
sonnel), tense (lots of uncertainty), or cordial (We love it here!). You don’t
have to be a rocket scientist — it’s that easy.
Dr. Barbara Fredrickson at the University of Michigan and her colleague Dr.
Marcial Losada of the Universidade Catholica de Brasilia, Brazil, have come
up with a fascinating theory about how workplace emotions affect employee
productivity. Instead of concentrating on one specific emotion — anger —
they look at the positive and negative nature of emotions and, much more
important, the relationship between the two, which they refer to as the posi-
tivity ratio. So far, they have found that:
 For employees to flourish in their work, the ratio of emotions expressed
in the workforce overall must be approximately 3-to-1 in favor of positive
feelings.
 If that 3-to-1 ratio isn’t reached, workers tend to flounder — describing
their work lives as empty and unsatisfying.
 Too much positivity, on the other hand, can also be a problem — a 
minimal amount of negativity is necessary to avoid work patterns 
from becoming inflexible, stagnant, boring, and overly routine (which 
in turn can lead to irritability among employees). But having enough
negativity isn’t something that most companies need to worry about!
 The negativity must be appropriate — that is, employees may not
express contempt for one another or act out in rage — in order for it 
to be beneficial (see Chapter 11 and find out how to use anger construc-
tively).
 The expression of positive emotions must be genuine rather than forced.
(Memo to all employees: From now on, every one of you will have a
smile on your face at all times!)
In the following table, I list a number of emotions that you may have
observed where you work. Circle ten of those that you feel best and most
accurately describe the emotional climate of your work situation in the past
week. It doesn’t matter which column you circle from — you choose ten emo-
tions total. Then calculate the positivity ratio by dividing the number of posi-
tive emotions by the number of negative emotions (for example, if you have
three words circled in the Positive column and seven words circled in the
Negative column, you do this simple calculation: 3 ÷ 7 = 0.43). Is your positiv-
ity ratio above or below 2.9? If the ratio is 2.9 or below, you — and everyone
else you work with — is much more likely to get angry at work. If the ratio is
at least 3.0 (but less than 11.0 — this is an example of too much positivity),
your workplace has a healthier environment.

If you’re an employer, here some tips on how to create a more positive work
setting:
 Recognize an “Employee of the Month” based not on productivity, but
rather on how positive the person relates to customers, clients, and co-
workers.
 Offer small rewards for displaying a positive attitude at work — tickets
for the family to attend a theme park, a gift certificate to a restaurant, or
tickets to a local comedy club.
 Celebrate every employee’s birthday, and have the birthday guy or gal
bring sweets for the entire office staff.
 Instead of observing dress-down Friday, have “lighten-up” Fridays where
everyone at work is on their most positive behavior.
282
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships

If you’re an employee, try to the following to make your work environment
more positive:
 Begin each workday by greeting your fellow employees by saying, “Have
a great day!”
 Interject some humor into the workplace dialogue. Laughter communi-
cates to your co-workers that you mean no harm.
 Always apologize when you do something that you know offends a fellow
employee. Not only will you feel better but, as it turns out, saying you’re
sorry also defuses the tension in the other person and makes it harder
for her to hold a grudge.
 Make a friend at work. Surveys show that having a friend at work — par-
ticularly if it’s your best friend — greatly increases the odds that you’ll
enjoy going to work and be more satisfied with what goes on there.
Making Civility the Norm
At work, niceness counts. Treating your fellow employees in a civil manner —
fair, respectful, courteous, pleasant — virtually assures that you’ll be treated
with civility yourself. The reverse is also true — be rude and hostile to others
and they will, in turn, act that way to you (or go out of their way to avoid you!).
Anger is often the byproduct of being on the receiving end of incivility. And
incivility typically leads to some form of counterproductive work behavior.
283
Chapter 20: At Work
The Dutch have it right
I spent a year working in the Netherlands and
was fascinated by the many differences between
U.S. culture and theirs. For example, a Dutchman
takes the initiative for making sure his birthday
is a huge, continuous celebration. All day long,
he tells everyone with whom he comes into
contact “It’s my birthday today!” And, at work,
he brings cake and assorted sweets for the
entire office staff. The more he likes himself and
the more reason he has to celebrate his birth-
day, the bigger the cake! Unlike Americans,
who wait for others to remember their birthday
and take responsibility for whatever celebration
comes their way — and then get depressed
when no one acknowledges it — the Dutch
leave nothing to chance. What a sensible and
civilized tradition!

How big a problem is workplace incivility? Huge! Approximately 90 percent of
all working people believe a lack of civility at work is a serious problem —
even though it doesn’t rise to the level of workplace (physical) violence.
Incivility is a major reason for turnover, with approximately half of the
employees who have been targeted for uncivil treatment contemplating look-
ing for another job and one in eight actually quitting.
If you’re an employer and you want to ensure that civility is the norm, follow
these suggestions:
 Make it clear — from the top down — that uncivil behavior will not be
tolerated (no matter what was allowed in the past) and that no excep-
tions will be made in terms of job status.
 Introduce training in civility as an integral part of recruitment and 
orientation.
 Have written policies on what constitutes civil and uncivil behavior and
what consequences are attached to the latter. Invite input from all
employees.
 Make civility counseling a vital part of the human resources program.
 Survey employees periodically on the status of civility in your workplace.
 Institute a peer-review system for recognizing and sanctioning uncivil
behavior.
 Emphasize constructive criticism, constructive anger expression, and con-
structive competition.
If you’re an employee and you want to make civility the norm where you
work, do the following:
 Make “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you” your per-
sonal mantra at work.
 Be constructive in your criticism of fellow employees — tell them how to
do what they do better!
 If you think your workplace is too uncivil, initiate some positive change —
don’t wait on the other guy.
 Make it clear to all those you work with that you expect to be treated in
a civil manner at all times and don’t be afraid to provide corrective feed-
back when it’s called for.
 Remind yourself and others at work that civility isn’t about who’s in
charge or who’s right — it’s about mutual respect.
284
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships

 Always allow your fellow employee to save face by addressing any prob-
lems or criticisms in private. It’s less intimidating and leaves him less
embarrassed.
 Be optimistic and always assume the best when it comes to the efforts of
those with whom you work. Give them the benefit of the doubt until you
have proof to the contrary.
 If you have to be critical of a fellow employee, show her the courtesy of
saying what you have to say face to face — and if you can’t say it to her
face, don’t say it at all!
Speaking Up, Not Out
Anger always speaks out — if not in actual words, then through efforts on
your part to “act out” what you’re feeling. Acting out feelings is what counter-
productive work behavior is all about.
Better than speaking out is speaking up — saying what’s on your mind and 
in your heart. Psychologists refer to this as assertiveness. The assertive
employee provides face-to-face, one-on-one feedback that affirms his needs
(“I need to be treated with more civility around here”), authenticates his 
emotions (“Yes, I’m angry and I think I have a right to be”), acknowledges the
positives as well as the negatives of the situation (“You know I like working
here, but . . .”), and assumes a positive outcome — all without being in the
least bit aggressive.
Assertiveness is more about action than attitude. On the contrary, if you 
don’t often stand up for yourself, you end up being perceived by those you
work with and for as weak (a pushover, the proverbial doormat) and someone
not to be respected or taken seriously — which invites others to treat you
badly. Rarely do you hear someone at work say, “Boy, I really admire her —
she’s such a mouse!”
So how exactly are you supposed to speak out in an assertive manner? Follow
these tips (and head to Chapters 4, 5, 8, and 11 for even more info):
 Take ownership — always start with the word I. For example: “I need
to talk to you about something that is bothering me.” “I need to give you
some personal feedback about this morning’s meeting.” “I’m not sure
you understand where I’m coming from.”
 Open with a positive statement. For example: “I think you know how
much I like working here, but. . . .” “I think it’s fair to say that you’ve
always been fair with me in the past, but. . . .”
285
Chapter 20: At Work

 Stop bobbing and weaving and get to the point. Be specific about 
what it is that is bothering you — making you angry. Don’t just say 
“I’m angry!” Tell the other person exactly why.
 Appeal to the other person’s empathy. For example: “I’m not sure you
appreciate the impact your words earlier had on me.” “I want to think you
weren’t intentionally trying to make me mad, but. . . .” “If I were to talk to
you rudely, I’m not sure how you would feel, but it really upsets me.”
 Avoid four-letter words. No one likes to be cussed at, not even the
person who cussed at you. Besides, the message gets lost when sur-
rounded by expletives.
 Be persistent. Don’t expect one assertive act on your part to change the
world. Change the dialogue first and the world will follow. Trust me.

C
an families have conflict without combat? Absolutely. In this chapter, I
tell you what a healthy family does to minimize destructive anger — the
kind that, all too often, ends up in domestic violence. Don’t worry . . . it can
be as simple as sitting down together at dinner every night.
Take the Smiths as an example. Mother, father, and teenage daughter —
they’re a family in trouble. Anger is at the center of almost every interaction
the Smiths have throughout the day. They fuss, they yell, and they use force
to get whatever they need from each other. They feel hopelessness about
their future as a family. The mother continues to seek a peaceful solution to
family conflict, but the father has given up. He spends most of his time away
from home and loses his temper when he’s there. The daughter battles with
both parents over almost everything.
Long ago, the Smiths decided their daughter’s anger was the problem that
needed to be fixed. They’ve taken her to one mental health professional after
another, all to no avail. What the family hasn’t done is examine their own
dynamics — the style with which they communicate and deal with one
another. What this family needs is what I call “anger management times
three.”
Anger within families involves power struggles; it’s the antithesis of coopera-
tion. It wastes family resources — energy, time, money — and can leave a
residue of hostility and resentment. Family members become so concerned
about winning battles that they lose sight of the fact that, together, they’re

losing the war. Relationships become fragmented — every man for himself.
They can no longer trust or count on each other for support. They’ve
become a family in name only.
In this chapter, I give you some practical tips on how not to end up like the
Smiths. I talk about how families can use anger constructively (see Chapter
11) to form more intimate, loving relationships (see Chapter 22). And I show
you how to minimize anger through effective parenting.
It Takes Two to Tango: Avoiding 
Angry Dialogues
When an angry family member confronts you, the easiest thing to do is
respond in kind — answer anger with anger. What ensues is what psycholo-
gist and author Harriett Lerner calls the “dance of anger” (in her best-selling
book by the same name). I liken it to the tango — a dance characterized by
its drama and passion.
If you don’t want to dance the anger dance, you have two options:
 You can simply opt out — in effect saying, “Thanks, but I’ll pass.”
Teenagers, for example, often initiate an angry exchange with parents as
a means of releasing pent-up tension, mostly relating to difficulties
they’re having with their peers. And what do most parents do? They
jump right in with both feet — first, by telling their kid, “You shouldn’t
feel like that” and, when that doesn’t work, by getting angry themselves.
The best course of action: Be sympathetic but don’t engage with the
other person’s anger. Let his anger be his anger — don’t make it yours.
It’ll die down quicker that way.
 You can engage in another type of dance, one with less drama — you
can begin by validating the person’s emotion and then give him a
chance to work through it. Consider the following example:
Parent: Hi. How was school?
Teenager: Leave me alone. God, every time I walk in the door, you’re
always asking me how I feel!
Parent: You sound like you’re angry.
Teenager: I am. But I don’t want to talk about it, okay?
Parent: That’s fine. But if you do, I’m here. I feel that way myself 
sometimes — just want to work things out myself.
Teenager: (voice louder) Well, I’m not you! Besides, you wouldn’t 
understand. You never do.
288
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 

Parent: (not raising voice) Of course, you’re not me — I wasn’t suggest-
ing that you were. You have your own way of dealing with your anger. I
was just being sympathetic.
Teenager: It’s that stupid Jen — she thinks she’s so much better than me.
I could just kill her; she makes me so mad.
Parent: So you’re angry with Jen. What did she do this time?
Now, the two are engaged in a dialogue about anger rather than an angry
dialogue.
Managing Anger from the Top Down
Family members — parents and children alike — learn by example. If a child
sees his parents rant and rave, cuss, and hit one another in anger, he’ll learn
to handle anger poorly himself. Similarly, if parents allow their child to throw
an angry tantrum every time she doesn’t get her way, they in turn act the
same way — they’ve learned to act like their child.
Parents are the ones who set the tone for the home environment, and they
need to take primary responsibility for ensuring that anger is expressed in a
civil and constructive way. (You may be able to hold your kids responsible
for cleaning their rooms, but you can’t hold them responsible for the anger in
your household.)
Unfortunately, my parents were poor role models for reasonable anger — my
mother was a yeller and my father was a hitter, and neither one could keep
from bringing out the worst in the other. Not wanting to be like either of
them, I ended up going to the other extreme and became instead a pouter
and a sulker. (Now you know where my fascination with anger comes from.)
289
Chapter 21: At Home
Never laugh at an angry loved one
Some people have a hard time expressing their
anger out loud, so the last thing you want to do
is laugh when she does find the courage to say
“I found that annoying.” When you laugh at
someone who’s expressing her feelings, you’re
being dismissive and showing contempt. This is
the most destructive type of communication
between family members. Having someone
listen to you when you’re angry is not only
important, it’s essential to good family relation-
ships. If we listened to each other more when
we’re annoyed, maybe we wouldn’t have to
listen so much when we’re in a full-blown rage.

The home environment is a learning laboratory, a classroom where all the
important lessons of life, and survival, are taught. Chief among these is the
lesson on how to survive —and even benefit from — conflict between family
members. Conflict is inherent in all families simply because its members have
different interests, personalities, temperaments, values, wants, likes, dislikes,
anxieties — all of which have to be negotiated if the family is to operate in
relative harmony. The major distinction between healthy and unhealthy fami-
lies is how they choose to resolve these conflicts — not whether they have
the conflicts in the first place.
So if you’re the parent, how do you set a healthy tone for your family’s 
conflicts? Here are some tips for managing the anger that results from 
family conflict:
 Be accepting of conflict and anger. Don’t disapprove of or dismiss con-
flicts between family members or try to distract people’s attention away
from problems. Remember: Anger is a signal that something is wrong
and needs to be resolved. You want those signals — if you didn’t have
them, or didn’t heed them, the anger would only grow.
 Talk about anger comfortably. Don’t make anger a taboo topic that
becomes yet one more “elephant in the living room” — something every-
one knows is there but no one talks about.
 Distinguish between different levels of anger and conflict. You want to
help your family differentiate between being irritated, being “just plain
mad,” and being in a rage (check out Chapter 2). The first two are okay —
the third is not.
 Keep your cool. You don’t help children keep their cool by losing yours!
You’re the adult — even if you don’t feel like you have much ability to
keep your cool, you can bet that you’re better able to keep your cool
than your kids are able to keep theirs.
290
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 
Won’t somebody listen?
One of the most effective methods of defusing
toxic anger in adolescents, I’ve found, is just
getting them to talk about their feelings and
being a good listener. That’s why in my anger-
management classes in schools, I don’t come in
with an overly structured curriculum. Instead, I
start by going around the circle, asking each
kid, “How are you? How has your anger been
since I saw you last?” and then going from
there. After the kids begin to trust me, they open
up and tell me all sorts of things they never tell
anyone else. Try to be that kind of listener for
your own kids — you may be surprised by what
they share with you.

 View anger and conflict as an opportunity for new learning. Step back,
look at each other, and find out something about the other person — the
result is a greater sense of intimacy (sharing of one’s real self!).
 Don’t punish — instead, problem-solve. Instead of fussing at each other
for being angry, ask each other two simple questions:
• What are you angry about?
• What would you like to do about it?
The first question defines the problem; the second question defines the
solution. If the other person knows what the problem is, but doesn’t
have a solution, help him find one — and one that doesn’t involve acting
out his anger is some hateful and vengeful way.
 Seek win-win solutions. No one likes to lose — certainly not someone
who’s already angry. She just gets angrier! What you want is to find a
solution to family anger that leaves everyone feeling that they got some-
thing positive out of the exchange — if only the fact that they were actu-
ally heard for a change. Here’s where a nonaggressive approach works
best — an approach that is not competitive (“I win, you lose!”) or con-
frontational and where one person in the family doesn’t try to dominate
the others.
Choosing the Unfamiliar: Changing 
Your Family’s Patterns
Albert Einstein said, “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and
expecting different results.” Human beings are creatures of habit, and so are
family units. Over time, families develop certain predictable patterns of
behaviors — family dynamics — that have a life of their own. Families have
decision-making patterns, problem-solving patterns, patterns that define how
we react to major changes in life circumstances, and patterns in how we react
to each other emotionally.
After these patterns are established, families tend to act them out reflexively,
mindlessly — even if they don’t work. Families tend to do today exactly what
they did yesterday — even if it’s not necessarily effective. In fact, I think that
at least part of the anger that family members feel is because they’re aware
that their patterns don’t work.
So, why not choose the unfamiliar for a change? Here’s an example: When my
kids still lived at home and we took long driving vacations, it was inevitable —
predictable — that my son would get angry because we were playing music
291
Chapter 21: At Home

my daughter liked on the radio, my daughter would get angry because we
were playing music my son liked, and I would get irritated because the two 
of them were bickering back and forth constantly. Nothing my wife or I did
seemed to satisfy the kids — we were stuck! Then one day — somewhere
between Virginia and Florida — I got a brilliant idea: This family would do
something it had never done before. We would each — all four of us — get 
to choose what we all listened to for 30 minutes at a time and continue rotat-
ing that until we arrived at our destination. Guess what? No one objected.
From that point forward, there were no more hostilities about the radio —
everybody was a winner. It may sound like a little thing, but believe me it
made a big difference in the emotional climate within the car.
Make a list of your own family’s situations where anger is most likely to
occur. Think about how each member of your family reacts in that particular
situation. Now, think what you can do to change how you react. The next
time that situation occurs, take the initiative to choose the unfamiliar. Don’t
be afraid to be creative. Surprise the rest of the family by doing something
unpredictable, and then watch how they respond — sometimes all it takes 
is one person changing the routine, and everyone else follows suit. Pretend
you’re a scientist conducting an experiment on how to create family har-
mony. If one thing doesn’t work, try something else — keep experimenting
until you find what you’re looking for.
This isn’t just something that parents can do. As a kid (especially a teenager),
you know the dynamics of your family, you know what sets them off. Why not
take the initiative, try something different, and see what happens?
Looking at Your Parenting Style
You have your own style of dressing or decorating your house or signing your
name — and you have your own style of child rearing. How you raise your
kids doesn’t just affect the intensity of conflict in your family — it affects
their emotions, their grades in school, whether they start smoking, whether
they engage in risky sexual behavior, among other things.
There are four main styles of parenting. See if you can find yourself in one of
these styles (and keep in mind that you may be a mix of more than one):
 Authoritative style: If you’re an authoritative parent, you’re highly
involved in your children’s lives and you’re not afraid to exert reason-
able control over their behavior. You’re fully aware of what your kids are
doing and who they’re doing it with. You have a physical presence in
their lives and you engage them in activities that generate a sense of
belonging and togetherness. Above all, you foster a sense of autonomy
(the ability and freedom to self-govern), which increases with age, and
292
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 

you present a clear message that with freedom comes responsibility. You
rarely, if ever, use punishment — threats, arguments, ultimatums — to
keep your kids in line.
What can you expect from your children? They’ll be cooperative, in a
positive mood, do well in school, have high self-esteem, evidence self-
control, and persist at tasks.
 Permissive style: If you’re a permissive parent, there’s no question that
you love your children. There’s also no question that you want to be
their best friend. To ensure that, you put few demands on them, impose
few limits on their social and emotional behavior, and essentially leave
the parenting up to them. You give them a lot of freedom and allow them
to be autonomous in areas where they’re incapable of succeeding. You
don’t set curfews for your teenagers — you feel that they know when it’s
time to come home.
Permissiveness sounds good on paper, but kids raised in permissive
homes tend to be impulsive, temperamental, defiant, rebellious, and
antisocial, and they show little evidence of self-control. Their relation-
ships with parents tend to be hostile/dependent — they can be highly
dependent one minute and terribly demanding the next.
 Autocratic style: Autocratic parents tend to be angry themselves. If
you’re autocratic, you make a lot of demands on your children and yell,
criticize, and punish them when they fail to live up to your expectations.
When it comes to talking with your children, there is no give-and-take
between your ideas/needs and theirs — your basic philosophy is “It’s
my way or the highway!” You’re definitely not a good listener. And auton-
omy is out of the question.
Your kids live in fear and tend to suppress or act out their negative emo-
tions. Whether you realize it or not, they view you as harsh, cold, and
rejecting. Like you, they often resort to force — aggression — to get
their way. Boys, especially, evidence high levels of anger outside the
home — at school and with peers.
 Unengaged style: Unengaged parents are parents in name only. If this is
your parenting style, when asked where your children are and what
they’re doing, you immediate response is, “I don’t know. I’m not sure.”
And that’s the sad truth of it. You tend to be unaccepting of your chil-
dren, unaware of what’s going on in their lives, unavailable to them day
and night, uninvolved — whatever they’re doing, they’re doing with
people other than you.
Children raised by unengaged parents are extremely alienated — from
adults and peers alike. They frequently use anger to keep others at a dis-
tance. They’re emotionally volatile — prone to rage. And they have very
limited social and problem-solving skills. Bottom line: Children who
raise themselves without love do a poor job of it.
293
Chapter 21: At Home

When it comes to minimizing anger in the home — both yours and that of
your children — the best parenting style to employ is the authoritative one.
Take Ross and his wife, Jane, for example. They have two children, both
teenagers. They encourage their kids to be involved in all sorts of activities —
school and community sports, choir, band, synagogue — and they’re there to
support them in every instance. Each evening at the dinner table, the topic of
conversation involves everything from world events to “Who are you spend-
ing time with these days?” Ross and Jane invite their children to talk about
their feelings, their problems, even difficult topics such as the recent suicide
of a kid at their high school. Ross and Jane argue with their kids at times, but
they’re always respectful of their kids, and their kids are respectful of them in
turn. As often as possible, decisions about family life are made as a family —
even though Ross and Jane have the final say. Apparently, their kids like and
are comfortable in their home environment — they’re always bringing friends
home and including them in family activities. Do Ross and Jane ever get
angry with their kids? Sure. Do their kids ever get mad at them? Of course.
But these times are few and far between and the anger never leads to disrup-
tion, disrespect, or violence.
Josh, a friend of Ross and Jane’s son, has a much different relationship with
his parents. Josh’s parents have always been hard on him, demanding that he
do well in school, fighting with him constantly over who his friends are,
insisting that he participate in activities that interest them, and restricting his
movements as much as possible. (In other words, they’re autocratic.) Josh
ends up emotionally conflicted — he both loves and hates his parents. That’s
why he stays away from home as much as he can, but at the same time con-
stantly talks to anyone who will listen about his unreasonable parents. Josh
is an intelligent kid, but he does poorly in school — to get back at his par-
ents. He smokes, drinks, and has wrecked his car on more than one occasion.
He and his parents are caught up in a vicious cycle of anger with no end in
sight.
Is the autocratic style the worst-case scenario when it comes to parenting? In
a sense yes, but actually it’s no worse than the other two (permissive and
unengaged).
294
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 
Can’t you understand why I’m so angry?
I surveyed the kids in my high school anger-
management classes as to how they were
being raised. Sadly, but not surprisingly, only 18
percent saw their parents as having an author-
itative style. The vast majority instead described
their parents as unengaged (32 percent), auto-
cratic (32 percent), or permissive (18 percent).
And, everyone — including their parents —
want to know “Why are these kids so angry?”

Parenting isn’t a static process. Early on, of course, children need a lot of
direct control, if for no other reason that to keep them safe. One of my neigh-
bors told me how he had a “discussion” with his 2-year-old son about the
harm that could befall him if he stuck his finger in an electrical socket. He
said that he had explained to his son the difference between AC and DC cur-
rent so that he would appreciate how electricity worked. He then asked me
what I would do if my son, Chris, went to stick his finger in the wall socket.
“Oh, that’s easy,” I said. “I would just smack his hand and say no!”
Later on, as kids grow up and can watch out for themselves a bit, it makes
sense for you to loosen up — exerting more indirect control or influence over
they way they think, feel, and behave. Teenagers, for example, should be part
of the family discussion about curfews, sex, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, the dif-
ference between right and wrong, and so on. As a parent, you want to encour-
age them to have an opinion about what goes on in the world around them and
what part they want to play in that world. Progressively allow them to make
important decisions or they’ll be indecisive or make poor decisions the rest of
their lives. (I often see this in kids — smart kids — who go away to college after
being raised by autocratic parents. They spend most of their first year doing all
the things they were never allowed to do — or even talk about — while they
were at home; sometimes with disastrous results.)
Of course, after your children become adults, it makes sense to become a
more permissive parent. After all, where do you get off telling your 33-year-
old how to live his life? Continue to be interested in their welfare, but be
available as a consultant or counselor, and supportive of their efforts to suc-
ceed in life. When it comes to telling them what to do — forget about it!
The most effective parents are the ones who know when and how to transi-
tion from one parenting style to another as their kids grow up.

Chapter 21: At Home
Video games and anger
One thing families can do to minimize angry,
aggressive behavior in their children is to restrict
the amount of time their kids are exposed to
video games, especially violent ones. A study of
227 college students at a large Midwestern uni-
versity found that aggressiveness — a person’s
overall tendency to act in a hostile way toward
others — was highly correlated with the
amount of time he spent playing both violent and
nonviolent video games. Exposure to video
games was also linked to delinquent behavior
such as purposely damaging property and
attacking someone with the idea of seriously
hurting him. These relationships were strongest
for males, in large part, because they tend to
spend more time playing video games than
females do.

Have a family meeting and review the various parenting styles. Ask each
family member to write down the style they believe fits each parent. Is there
consensus or a diversity of opinion? Let each person give examples of why
she rated each parent the way she did. Don’t comment until everyone has
had his say, and then open the floor for general discussion. Remember not to
get defensive — that will defeat the whole purpose of the exercise. You may
be surprised by what you discover.
The Power of One
Dr. Robert Maurer’s book One Small Step Can Change Your Life has a simple,
yet profound message: When you want to make important changes in your
life, think small. My translation of that is what I call the “power of one.”
Beginning today, commit yourself to doing one — and only one — thing to
create an anger-free environment at home. It really doesn’t matter what that
one thing is, as long as it has some potential for creating family cohesion and
harmony and you’re willing to stick with it long enough to realize some
change. In the following sections, I give you some places to start.
One meal a day
Psychologists repeatedly find that families who share one meal a day
together get along better than families who don’t. Granted, getting everyone
in the family together in one spot, at one time, for one purpose can be a
daunting task in today’s stressful world — but there’s no mistaking the fact
that it’s a key to family unity and a feeling of connectedness between family
members.
296
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 
Our time together . . .
My father didn’t get too many things right as a
parent, but one thing he did that was good was
insist that our family spend the whole day
together working in the yard every Sunday. My
older brother hated it (which made me happy!),
but he had no choice — so he worked side by
side with the rest of us edging the driveway,
mowing, pruning shrubs, all in the hot Florida sun.
I always thought it was a special day — a time
for just the Gentrys. It was one of the few times
we got to see my father when he wasn’t tired,
fighting with my mother, or angry. We worked
together and, afterward, played and ate together.
It was a good time all around!

Sharing a meal together is not about food — it’s about community. It’s a time
when the family members can:
 Revisit their biological roots
 Share a positive moment
 Express ideas and emotions
 Negotiate changes in family rules
 Get things off their chest (see Chapters 5 and 8)
 Reinforce each other for individual achievements
 Plan future events
 Have spiritual time together
 Talk about current events
 Learn about family history
 Learn to see things from the other person’s perspective
Family members won’t be likely to drift away and become isolated — and
thus become literal strangers — when they interact with one another in this
intimate for-members-only way on a daily basis. And there’s less likelihood of
toxic anger occurring in a situation where people know one another in the
way that daily meal sharing allows.
One evening a week
Try sharing one evening a week with your family. You can accomplish the
same things you do by eating one meal a day together — only in more depth.
You can use this time to address unresolved family tensions — or just to
enjoy each other’s company.
Rudy, a middle-aged man who is being seen for anger management involving
domestic abuse, has started having family meetings once a week to talk
about his anger and its impact on everyone else in his family. These evenings
are difficult for Rudy because, for many years, he denied that he had a prob-
lem with anger. It’s also tough on him because he has inflicted so much emo-
tional harm on his wife and kids. Rudy began the first family meeting by
acknowledging to everyone that he has a problem with anger and by sharing
what he’s learning about himself in treatment. His teenage son opened up
about how afraid he has been of Rudy his whole life and how that has forced
him to connect only with his mother. He went on to say how he and his sister
are constantly vigilant whenever Rudy is around and how tense and fright-
ened they become when they realize their dad will be coming home soon.
297
Chapter 21: At Home

Finally, his wife shared how she has hidden things from her husband all of
their married life — important things, personal things — for fear that he
would erupt in rage. After two hours of intense family discussion, Rudy was
reduced to tears and had a profound sense of remorse. “Good,” I tell him.
“You should feel bad about using your anger all these years to hurt the people
you love — and that’s your incentive to stick with the anger-management pro-
gram.” Facing up to his problem and allowing his family to speak out is proba-
bly the greatest gift Rudy has ever given his family — or himself.
One day a month
Spending one day a month together as a family is hardly a big investment of
time in order to create a healthy emotional climate — it’s only 3 percent of
the year! This day can be the time when the family gets out of the box and
ventures off into some new area of interest or experience — for example,
river rafting, visiting a local museum, hiking, taking a 20-mile bicycling trip, or
attending a sporting event. Rotate the responsibility for deciding this month’s
agenda among family members so that everyone has an equal opportunity to
involve the whole family in something that interests and excites them.
Enjoy the time together — because joy is the emotional antithesis of anger!
One week a year
Families who vacation together stay together. It’s amazing what one week a
year together can do to revive family ties, cement relationships, reconnect
you to your biological roots, and remind you of all the many good times
you’ve had over the years. It’s a time of family revitalization! It reminds you
that, no matter how busy your life throughout the remainder of the year,
you’re never really alone — your family is there to support you. One week a
year is a time for family healing and rehealing — of replenishing positive emo-
tions and letting go of grievances from the past (see Chapters 12 and 13). It’s a
time when the past, present, and future come together as one, offering you an
opportunity to appreciate the coherence that family has brought to your life.
Recently, I met a man who, at age 62, still gets together every year with his
entire family — children and grandchildren — for a family vacation. He said
they used to do this at their house, but they found that there were too many
distractions — everyone was running off somewhere, meeting other people.
So they decided to begin vacationing at some new site — Montana, Hawaii,
Florida — each year so they would be forced to spend all their time together.

The lessons of Roseta
Over 40 years ago, Professor Steward Wolf and
his colleagues became intrigued by the absence
of heart disease in a small Italian-American com-
munity in eastern Pennsylvania — Roseta.
Rosetans had a death rate from heart disease
that was less than half that of nearby communi-
ties and the United States as a whole. Ironically,
people in Roseta appeared to have the same
amount of heart disease as their neighbors —
they just didn’t die from it. Even more ironic was
the fact that Rosetans, as a group, tended to be
overweight, smoke heavily, and have high cho-
lesterol levels, as well as being sedentary — all
classic risk factors for fatal heart attacks. So,
what was their secret?
The secret was that they — the entire commu-
nity — were, in effect, one big happy family, dis-
tinguished by their close family ties, mutual
support, strong religious beliefs, a feeling of rev-
erence for the elderly, and social interdepen-
dence (everyone depending on each other in
healthy and meaningful ways). Rosetans were a
cohesive group with a strong group identity,
strong group allegiances, and a common set of
values that ultimately led, to quote Dr. Wolf, to
an “unshaken feeling of personal security and
continuity” both of life and purpose.
Sadly, Dr. Wolf lived long enough to witness the
decline and fall of Roseta’s old-world traditions
and sense of family. Individual achievements
took the place of community activities; material
gains became more important than spiritual and
moral values; and residents became much less
connected in their day-to-day lives. Guess what
happened? In no time at all, Rosetans began to
catch up with the rest of the country in terms of
fatal heart attacks. They had clearly lost their
advantage!
“New-world” relationships in Roseta involved
very angry people. Maybe their real secret was
not the cohesive family structure within the
community, but the freedom from anger they all
enjoyed as a result. Because anger is a major
risk factor for heart disease (see Chapter 3), it
seems likely.
How many old-world behaviors typify your
family? For example, does your family:
 Work together on collaborative projects?
 Attend religious services together regu-
larly?
 Value family unity over material success?
 Show respect for the elderly?
 See each member as an integral compo-
nent to the overall health and well being of
the family?
 Work to protect each other from unhealthy
outside influences?
 Support each other in times of unusual
stress?
 Support each other during times of family
conflict?
 See anger as an impediment to family cohe-
sion?
 Feel responsible for the emotional health of
other family members?
Wouldn’t this make a great topic of discussion
when your family shares its one meal together
each day or at one of your evenings together
each week? Give it a try.

M
illions of people live with, love, and suffer at the hands of an intimate
relationship with an angry spouse, child, parent, sibling, or close friend.
Becky’s teenage daughter can be cooperative and charming at times, but then
again she can fly into an uncontrollable, violent rage. On more than one occa-
sions, Becky has had to call the police for help — a difficult thing for her to
do, because she loves her daughter deeply. Becky is afraid of her child’s
temper, and for good reason. Becky clearly has been the victim of what I call
a “loving-but-angry relationship” — her love, her daughter’s anger.
Elaine has a similar relationship with her second husband. On the one hand,
she’s quick to defend him by suggesting that “he’s not violent or anything like
that.” But, then, she goes on to describe how irascible he is and how often he
hurts her feelings when he yells at her and says things that make her feel
stupid. “He’s not dumb, you know,” she protests. “He just has a bad temper.”
Like Becky, Elaine is a victim — and a depressed one at that.
This chapter addresses issues of anger management within a variety of inti-
mate relationships. Here you discover how to avoid becoming part of an
angry couple. You see how to set healthy boundaries, how to communicate
anger without being contemptuous, and how to think your way into healthier
relationships. This chapter also exposes the mental traps that keep you in
harm’s way while dealing with those you love the most. Most of all, this chap-
ter helps you realize that abusive anger is one thing, but being a victim is
another.

The Loving-but-Angry Relationship
When you think of domestic violence, what comes to mind? If you’re like
most people, you immediately conjure up an image of a husband and wife
engaged in an angry, violent exchange. But what if you’re having that same
exchange with your elderly father, who has belittled and berated you your
entire life? Would you call that domestic violence? I would. And, what if you
had the same kind of exchange with your sister or close friend? Would you
regard that as domestic violence? I would.
My point is that, as a society, we need to broaden our definition of domestic
violence to any type of close, intimate relationship that is based on love with
some angry person. These relationships are the most difficult ones in which
to manage anger because you can’t walk away from them (at least not easily)
and because you probably have a different standard for what is acceptable
behavior for loved ones versus strangers (in other words, you’ll tolerate
more from your loved ones than you will from strangers).
Intimate partner violence
The term intimate-partner violence (IPV) is relatively new. It is used to charac-
terize any act that results in a person being hurt physically, emotionally, or
sexually by someone the person is dating; victims of IPV can be men as well
as women.
IPV is presumably motivated by anger. Large-scale studies of IPV suggest that
it’s an all-too-common experience among high-school-age girls, affecting one in
five. Hardly what you’d expect to encounter within the context of your first love.
How does IPV affect people? Victims of IPV are more at risk for a variety of
self-destructive behaviors, including:
 Heavy smoking
 Binge drinking
 Drunk driving
 Cocaine use
 Unhealthy weight control (diet pills, laxative use)
 Early-onset sexual behavior (under age 15)
 Unsafe sex (multiple partners, nonuse of condoms)
 Unplanned pregnancy
 Suicide
Not a pretty picture.

Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 

The angry marriage
Marriage is perhaps the most intimate relationship of all. Ideally, it is one 
that is based on trust, mutual respect, complementary interests, shared
values, and abiding love. Many marriages, however, are far from ideal. A
couple who began as blissful newlyweds ends up in an angry marriage.
By “angry marriage,” I don’t mean a couple who occasionally shares an angry
moment. What married couple doesn’t? An angry marriage is one in which
anger defines both the emotional tone of the relationship as well as the
couple’s primary style of interacting with one another.
To test whether you and your spouse qualify as an angry couple, ask yourself
the following questions:
 Do you and/or your spouse get angry at least once a day?
 Would you rate the intensity of your anger (or that of your spouse’s
anger) a 7 or higher on a 10-point scale, ranging from 1 (very mild) to 10
(very intense)?
303
Chapter 22: In Intimate Relationships
No one is exempt
My wife chairs the local America’s Junior Miss
program, which offers the highest caliber of
high school senior girls an opportunity to com-
pete for college scholarships. These girls are
truly exceptional in terms of intelligence, talent,
poise, physical fitness, and their ability to com-
municate effectively with adults — not the sort
of young women you’d expect to have been
exposed to intimate-partner violence.
Yet, when I asked them about their experience
with IPV, I found that:
 Forty percent had already been involved in
a loving-but-angry relationship.
 Twenty-five percent were in a current rela-
tionship with someone who had a bad temper.
 Twenty-seven percent had been physically
abused (hit, shoved, or slapped) by some-
one they were dating.
 Over 50 percent had been subjected to sig-
nificant verbal abuse.
 Almost 60 percent knew a peer who had
also been the victim of IPV.
And, these were the girls who came from
“good” homes, who were the best and the
brightest, and who were most likely to succeed
in life. If you had any doubts about the preva-
lence of IPV among teenagers, these numbers
should provide all the proof you need.

 Once provoked, does your anger (or your spouse’s) last for more than a
half-hour?
 Have either you or your spouse ever pushed, shoved, or hit one another
when you were angry?
 Has your anger (or your spouse’s) ever left you (or your spouse) feeling
anxious or depressed?
 Would you say that you (or your spouse) have become a much angrier
person since you got married?
 Do you or your spouse find yourselves worrying about each other’s
temper?
 Do you frequently use inflammatory language (cursing) to communicate
with your spouse (or does your spouse frequently use such language to
communicate with you)?
 Have you or your spouse ever treated each other with contempt — 
belittling, demeaning, or devaluing each other?
 Are you (or is your spouse) beginning to question whether you love
your partner?
 Do you (or your spouse) find yourselves answering anger with anger
most of the time?
 Do you (or your spouse) feel unsafe in your marriage?
 Do you or your spouse always have to have the last word in a 
disagreement?
 Do you and your spouse demand a lot of each other?
 Do you or your spouse feel entitled to certain things in your marriage?
 Would you (or your spouse) describe your marriage as competitive?
 Would you describe yourself or your spouse as an impulsive person?
 Do you or your spouse tend to dominate one another in conversations?
 Do you or your spouse engage in road rage?
 Have you or your spouse ever thought about or actually sought counsel-
ing for problems arising out of anger?
If you answered yes to three of more of these questions, you should consider
you and your spouse an angry couple. How do you change this? Take advan-
tage of the solutions offered in the remainder of this chapter, as well as
throughout the book.

Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 

Parent-child anger
Parent-child relationships provide a natural venue for anger. As a parent,
your job is to shape your child into becoming a decent, civilized adult (see
Chapter 21) — an awesome task at best! Among other things, this means that
you have to place limitations and restrictions on your child’s behavior, which
may frustrate your kid and make him angry. The kid’s job — at least as some
kids see it — is to fight the parent every step of the way, which makes the
parent angry. And so it goes around and around for about 20 years in normal
families.
In some cases, however, this interaction between parents and children
(called the socialization process) gets out of hand. The anger between the
parent and the child becomes too intense, lasts too long, and is expressed in
hurtful ways.
The entire time I was growing up, my father was an angry man — the type I
describe in Chapter 2 as suffering from episodic rage. One minute we were
engaging in family fun, and the next minute he was ranting and raving in a
threatening manner. All along — even into my adult years — I kept wondering
what I was doing that made him so mad. And then one day, long after he had
died, my mother gave me the answer I had been waiting for: “You know, your
father never wanted children,” she said. “But I did.” Why was my father so
angry all those years? Because we were here — not because we did anything
to provoke him, simply because we were born.
Parents are not the only ones who have anger fits. Many parents are on the
receiving end of child anger and abuse. One mother brought her teenage son
to see me for anger management. She described the impact of his behavior
this way: “You have the whole spectrum of emotions. You become very angry
yourself; you get hysterical; you feel absolutely devastated at times; and you
have enormous feelings of guilt. I find myself asking over and over, ‘What
have I done to create this?’”
305
Chapter 22: In Intimate Relationships
Mature is as mature does
In a healthy, seasoned, mature marriage, each
partner exercises self-control. This is the key to
marital stability. The husband doesn’t leave it up
to his wife to set limits on his unreasonable
anger and vice versa. In immature marriages,
partners proceed full-speed ahead with their
emotions and end up doing a lot of damage to
the relationship. This may explain why mar-
riages today last only about five years on aver-
age — a sad but compelling statistic.

Sibling anger
Anger between siblings goes all the way back to the days when Cain and Abel
had the whole world to themselves. As the story goes, Cain got angry and
killed Abel in a fit of jealousy — Cain thought Abel was God’s favorite (as
older siblings are prone to think when it comes to their younger siblings).
How often is that same family dynamic played out in families today? Too often.
In recent years, a lot of attention has been directed at bullying and the harm it
causes those who are its victim — low self-esteem, depression, substance
abuse, poor school performance. Most of the emphasis seems to be on bully-
ing in the context of peer relationships outside the family — particularly at
school.
But bullying doesn’t begin there — it starts in the home and moves into the
schools and onto the streets later on. One young man in my seventh-grade
anger-management class proudly acknowledged week after week how he
angrily beat his younger brother to a pulp over the smallest disagreement. 
He openly admitted that he got pleasure out of hurting his brother and felt 
no remorse whatsoever over the damage he caused. What became of this
young man? He ended up in my high school anger-management class three
years later, this time on a court order for assault behavior. And, guess who
the victim was? His brother!
If You’re the Angry Loved One
All the various anger-management strategies outlined in this book apply to
you. What’s different about anger in intimate relationships is the fact that
you’re dealing with loved ones rather than strangers or casual acquain-
tances. The fact that you’re angry with the people you love can actually be an
incentive — you have more to lose than you do if you’re too angry at work. At
work, you can get fired, but if you’re angry with your loved ones, you can lose
the most important people in your life.
In the following sections, I let you know what may happen if you let your
anger continue, and I give you some tips if you’re the angry one in your inti-
mate relationships.
You may become the person 
you fear and hate
People are changed by intimate relationships — sometimes for the better,
sometimes for the worse. Regrettably, in a loving-but-angry relationship, you
306
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 

can — and often do — end up acting just like the person you fear and hate.
You may not start out the relationship being an angry person, but over time,
you develop into one in an effort to defend yourself and level the playing
field. This transformation doesn’t happen overnight, but it does happen.
Amanda, a young married woman in her late 20s, found herself experiencing
fits of rage every few days. Her husband, whom she had assaulted more than
once, was afraid of her. Her family urged her to get help. Finally, she did. In
one of our early sessions, I asked Amanda about her parents — what kind of
people were they? Instantly she replied, “My mom, she has a worse temper
than I do.” She recounted how her mother had always been overly critical
and how she would get very angry when Amanda didn’t do things perfectly.
“You mean she acted just like you do with your husband,” I observed.
Amanda appeared stunned by what I said — it was obviously something 
she had never thought of before. Without realizing it, Amanda had become
the person she loved (but also feared) the most — her mother. And she 
had transferred what she had learned in one intimate relationship (mother-
daughter) to another (husband-wife). By making this observation, I had 
given Amanda a choice: Repeat the cycle of intimate-partner violence, or
make a change.
Two wrongs never make a right
In an intimate relationship, one angry person can be a problem — but two is
a disaster! I know you think you’ll feel better if you answer anger with anger,
but you’re wrong. As Dr. James Averill, a psychologist at the University of
Massachusetts, has noted, less than 20 percent of folks report feeling “tri-
umphant” after expressing anger, as contrasted with 60 percent or more who
are left feeling hostile or depressed. An exchange between two angry people
is definitely a no-win situation.
I can’t tell you how many men I’ve counseled who ended up in legal trouble
because they reacted to an angry wife (or ex-wife) in anger. The following
conversation typifies what I’m talking about:
Client: I messed up again. I got arrested and charged with assault and
battery. I can’t believe I was so stupid.
Me: How did that happen?
Client: It was weird. I was having an enjoyable dinner with some friends
when my wife [they were separated] called and wanted me to come pick
up the kids right then. She sounded upset.
Me: So, what did you do?
307
Chapter 22: In Intimate Relationships

Client: I excused myself and left the restaurant, even though my friends
urged me not to. I went to the cemetery where my wife wanted to meet
me.
Me: Cemetery? Why there?
Client: I have no idea, but I went there anyway. As soon as I got there, my
wife charged at me angry, yelling, and screaming. I told her to back off,
but she just got more agitated. I took the kids and was putting them in the
car, when my wife got in my face — and I just got angry and pushed her
away. Then I got in my car and drove off.
Me: Then what happened?
Client: When I got home, the police were waiting for me. They’d gotten a
complaint from my wife that I had just assaulted her. So, they took me in
and booked me.
Me: So, what’s the lesson learned here? About anger, that is.
Client: First of all, I should have stayed at the restaurant and finished my
dinner with my friends. Second, I should never have agreed to meet her
in a place where there are no other people around — no witnesses. Plus, I
should have kept my cool even though my wife had obviously lost hers.
Then I wouldn’t be in all this trouble.
Me: Right!
Establishing healthy boundaries
Boundaries are limits. They tell you when you’ve gone too far. They also tell
you when your anger is out of bounds. One way to think about rage is that it’s
anger that has crossed the line — the point beyond which you cannot control
it. Emotional, physical, and sexual violence should also be considered as out
of bounds. The difference between my father and me is not that he had a bad
temper and I don’t — it’s that when he got angry, he hit my mother, whereas
(I can proudly say after 40 years of marriage!), no matter how angry I’ve
gotten, I’ve never laid a hand on my wife.
Here are some examples of what I mean by establishing healthy boundaries
on anger:
 When your anger gets too intense, stop whatever you’re doing and
walk away. The easiest way I know to gauge this is to rate your anger 
on a 10-point scale. If you’re a 7 or above, that should be your cue to
walk away.
308
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 

 Commit yourself to the idea that physical violence is never accept-
able. I made this commitment when I was a small child, watching my
parents hurt each other in anger day after day.
 Set a limit on how much anger you’re willing to express toward a
loved one. When you feel like you’re progressing from anger into rage,
stop! From that point on, what’s more important is what you don’t do
than what you do. This is a perfect time to go for a long walk, exorcise
your anger at the gym, or practice the tips in Chapter 6 on how to keep
your cool.
 Demand that others respect you as much as you respect them. If you
can restrain your anger toward your loved ones, insist that they do like-
wise — or leave the situation immediately! As I point out in Chapter 21,
it takes two to tango. You can avoid an escalating angry dialogue by dis-
engaging at just the right time.
 Tone it down. Remember: No matter what you’re trying to communi-
cate to a loved one when you get angry (which may be something that
person needs to hear!), the message gets lost when the volume goes up.
(See how yelling also affects your health in Chapter 5.)
 If you’re getting too angry, let your loved one have the last word,
which effectively puts an end to your anger and his. This is one thing
that is definitely under your control.
 Don’t be afraid to call a timeout when you’re getting too angry. Say
something like, “Okay, this is as far as I want to go with this. I think we’re
getting beyond the point where my anger is constructive. But, I’d like to
come back and discuss this more later on.”

Chapter 22: In Intimate Relationships
Forgoing reciprocity
We live in a tit-for-tat world. If someone close to
you hurts you, it’s only natural to want to hurt him
back. You push my buttons and I’ll push yours!
Unfortunately, that is exactly how exchanges
that begin with one or both parties getting irri-
tated end up in domestic violence. This need for
this emotional reciprocity accelerates the
process of toxic anger. It adds fuel to the fire.
Responding in kind when someone gets angry
with you is a reaction — and a reaction is any
behavior that is highly predictable, mindless,
impulsive, and typically leads to negative con-
sequences. What you want to do is respond to
your loved one’s anger, not react to it (see
Chapter 6).

If You’re on the Receiving End 
of a Loved One’s Anger
If you’re on the receiving end of the anger, the most important thing you can
do is to stay out of harm’s way. Your job isn’t to fix your loved one’s anger —
that’s your loved one’s job (see the preceding section).
Most people who are on the wrong end of a loving-but-angry relationship
think they have only three options:
 Hope and pray that the angry partner will change.
 Seek professional help to undo some of the damage done by the abusive
anger.
 Terminate the relationship altogether.
I’m offering you a fourth viable option: You can start acting in ways that don’t
lead to victimization. In the following sections, I show you how.
Eliminate the mental traps
If you’re in a loving-but-angry relationship, you probably got stuck there
through a series of mental traps. What kind of traps? They’re traps that have 
to do with two equally strong emotions: love and anger. What’s in your mind —
firmly held beliefs about love and anger — keeps you from achieving what mat-
ters most: a relationship that is both intimate and safe.
To counteract the mental traps in the following sections, you need to practice
what psychologists call cognitive restructuring. That is, rewire your thinking
about the relationship between love and anger. Start by challenging any of
the false beliefs listed in the following sections. For instance, if your mind
tells you, “If my husband loves me enough, he’ll stop being so angry,” restruc-
ture that thought by saying to yourself, “My husband definitely has an anger
problem. He needs help. I can’t be the one to fix him — he needs to be
responsible for that. Whatever is causing his anger, it’s not me. The answer 
to his anger is inside him. And loving me can’t make all that right.”
The belief that you can eliminate someone else’s anger
In my experience, the most pervasive mental trap of all is the idea that a
loving relationship will make the person you love less angry. Nothing could
be farther from the truth. You can’t do anything to make your loved one less
310
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 

angry — it’s what your loved one does that counts! And if you’re the angry
one, believe me, the other person can’t rid you of your anger — it’s all up 
to you.
Tina fell into this trap for years, trying to fix her female partner’s intermit-
tent-rage disorder with love and support. As Tina said, “Living with her was
like living on top of a volcano — you never knew when she was going to erupt
next.” In the end, all Tina got for her efforts was a trip to the emergency
room, a fractured skull, a ton of medical bills, and a restraining order against
her lover.
The belief that anger is fleeting but love is forever
A second mental trap has to do with the belief that anger comes and goes,
but love is forever. No way. For a large — and perhaps growing — segment of
the population, anger is anything but fleeting (for some statistics, see Chapter
2). Anger is a chronic condition — and a toxic one at that. Trust me, anger
will be around long after the love is gone.
The belief that if he loves you, he’ll change
Another myth about anger and love is that if the angry person loves you
enough, he’ll change. Not really. Although love for another person can be an
incentive for becoming anger free, by itself it isn’t enough motivation to alter
long-standing, complex emotional patterns that have a life of their own. As I
argue throughout this book, there are many facets to effective anger manage-
ment and no one simple solution.
Don’t make the other person’s anger the test of how much he loves you.
Assume that he loves you — he just doesn’t know how to control his temper.
The belief that all you need is love
The Beatles may try to convince you otherwise, but you need a lot more than
love. Many people believe that as long as two people love each other, nothing
else matters. Some people still believe that even after they’re released from
an emergency room after being assaulted by the person they love.
Tina, the young woman I mention earlier, took a while to get her mind right.
The fractured skull wasn’t the first significant injury she had sustained at the
hands of a loved one — but it was the last. This loving-but-angry relationship
wasn’t the first Tina had — but it was the last.
Lots of things should matter in your life in addition to love — energy, health,
your career. (See how anger poisons your life in Chapter 3.)
311
Chapter 22: In Intimate Relationships

The belief that anger is just a sign of caring
The last mental trap is the one that tells you, if someone you love is angry
with you, it means she actually cares. I love it when I hear stories about par-
ents or spouses who engage in outrageous behavior (including violence)
toward someone they supposedly love, all the while saying, “I’m doing this
for your own good.” Rubbish! Angry people care about themselves — what
they want, what they expect, what they demand, what they think — not you.
They’re expressing anger for their own good — to let off some steam, to
relieve tension, to protest what they regard as unfair treatment. If they actu-
ally cared about you — your welfare, your safety, your sanity — they would
take whatever immediate action was necessary to short-circuit their anger
(see Chapter 4).
Stop being part of the problem
If you can’t be the solution to your loved one’s anger, don’t be part of the
problem. Relationships are two-way streets. Your loved one’s anger affects
you, and your behavior in turn affects his anger. What you don’t want to be is
an anger facilitator (the person who makes it easier for the other person to
move ahead with his anger beyond the point of no return).
When someone who is obviously in a state of rage says, “I’m warning you —
don’t say another word!,” take her at her word and shut up. If a person who is
well on his way to losing his cool says, “Get out of my way — I’ve got to get
out of here!,” move aside or you’ll very likely get hurt. It doesn’t pay to push
someone who’s already angry.
Here are some other ways you can stop being part of the problem:
312
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 
I’m off to play the violin
One of my favorite anger-management clients, a
downtrodden woman in her mid-40s, spent most
of her time, when she wasn’t working, at home
taking angry abuse from her husband. She had
come to dread weekends, because she would be
exposed to 48 hours of relentless, angry criti-
cism.
At one point, I reminded her of the joy she used
to experience in playing the violin and suggested
she take lessons again as part of her anger-man-
agement program. She did and that has become
her sanctuary — a few hours away from her
husband’s anger. She’s also started going out
with friends from work, riding her horse again,
and going back to church, all of which takes time
away from her husband’s anger. He’s not too
happy with all this, but she is — and so am I!

 Don’t apologize for someone else’s anger. That’s just another way of
helping him not take responsibility for his own emotions. Instead of
saying, “I’m sorry I made you mad,” tell him, “I can see you’re angry
about something. Do you want to talk about it?”
 Don’t keep silent about someone else’s bad behavior. People who
exhibit unreasonable anger need corrective feedback. They need to hear
when they’re getting too loud or acting in ways that make others afraid.
If you’re quiet and you let things slide, the other person may think her
behavior is just fine and dandy.
 Don’t minimize the problem. When one of my clients is relating an inci-
dent where she became angry and rates the intensity of her feeling at
that moment as an 8 on a 10-point scale, I simply say, “Okay, you weren’t
angry. You were way beyond anger — you were in a rage.” My clients
don’t like being told they were in a rage, and suddenly they want to
argue with me that they were only angry. It’s their way of pretending that
what they were feeling was normal. But I don’t let them off the hook.
 Get a life of your own. Too many people make their loved one’s anger
the centerpiece of their lives. You put everything else on hold while you
try to fix the other person’s anger. Instead, follow your own interests. If
you have buddies you play basketball with or friends who meet to chat
about the latest Oprah book, you’ll have someplace to go, something to
do, when your loved one flies off the hook.
 Don’t help the other person save face. People who have too much
anger need to face up to their problem. Stop coming up with excuses for
the other person’s outrage.
 Stop being your partner’s excuse. Virtually all of my anger-management
clients begin by describing all the other people who “make me angry.” I
ask them, “Why did you get angry in that situation?” and they answer,
“My wife did. . . .” I always say, “I didn’t ask about your wife — I asked
why you got angry in that situation.” Inevitably, they repeat, “I told you,
my wife. . . .” I don’t let them off the hook. I keep repeating my question
until they quit using other people to excuse (take responsibility for)
their anger. Nothing much can happen until they take responsibility for
themselves.
 Pretend your loved one is a stranger. I asked one mother who had suf-
fered repeated physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her teenage
son, “If this were a youngster from down the block, would you let him
hurt you like this?” “Absolutely not,” she replied without hesitation.
“There’s no one else on this earth that I would stay around for more
than a minute or two if they treated me like my son does.” So, I sug-
gested that, from that point on, she think of her son as a stranger — 
and behave accordingly. That was the beginning of her recovery.
313
Chapter 22: In Intimate Relationships

 Stop paying the bill. I’m a firm believer that mature, responsible people
pay the consequences of their behavior. I never have quite figured out
why some parents I know paid all the speeding tickets their teenage 
kids got any more than I understand why they bear the cost of replacing
broken doors, smashed telephones, wrecked cars, all destroyed by these
“loving” children. The logic here is simple: If you pay, you’re the respon-
sible party. If they pay, they are. That’s the message you want to send,
right?
Inoculate yourself
Psychologist Donald Meichenbaum at the University of Waterloo pioneered 
a technique called stress inoculation training (SIT) that has real promise for
people who find themselves stuck in a loving-but-angry relationship.
Although Meichenbaum was primarily interested in helping clients cope
effectively with overpowering anxiety, you can use it to protect you from
your loved one’s anger. Think of this as an alternative to answering anger
with anger.
As with other types of inoculation — polio, smallpox, flu — stress inoculation
training will increase your resistance to the stress (and potential harm) of
being on the receiving end of someone else’s anger. SIT is a proactive tech-
nique, which includes three basic steps:
1. Become more aware of how you typically react to your loved 
one’s anger.
Nancy, for example, would be relaxed until she heard her husband’s 
car turn into the driveway. Immediately, she would tense up and brace
herself for his inevitable anger. She would think to herself, “Please, 
Lord, don’t let him get mad at me today.” And she was already pre-
pared to take the blame for his irritation (“I just can’t seem to do 
anything right.”).
2. Cope with the arousal — the fight-or-flight response — that accompa-
nies angry encounters with your loved one.
To reduce her anticipatory tension, Nancy tells herself:
I can handle this — it’s not like I haven’t been up against his anger before.
Easy does it. Don’t panic.
I’m not going to take this personally. His anger is about him, not me.
I just need to relax, relax, relax.
314
Part VI: Managing Anger in Key Relationships 

3. Generate a situation-specific solution.
Here’s where Nancy has to consider her options. Should she react as
usual (by getting tense when his car pulls in the driveway)? Or is there
some other coping strategy that would be more effective when her hus-
band begins to lose his temper? For example, she might simply acknowl-
edge his anger (“I can see you’re angry again today.”). Or she could
question his anger (“It must be awfully uncomfortable being that angry.
Is it?”). She could set some limits on his anger (“I don’t think I want to
stay around and listen to this.”). She could attempt to elicit some empa-
thy from her husband (“Have you any idea whatsoever how your anger
affects me?”). Or she could offer her husband a Life Saver to both get his
attention (so he can practice some anger management) and to sweeten
his disposition (see Chapter 4).
Refuse to play the role of the victim
I was struck recently by the story of a man who had risen from the ranks 
of the homeless to that of a wealthy, successful businessman in a relatively
short period of time. At one point, he and his son had slept in a subway 
bathroom night after night because they had nowhere else to go. When 
asked during a television interview how difficult it was for him to regain 
his integrity after living in such horrendous conditions, he replied, “I think
you misunderstood me — I said I was homeless, not hopeless. My son and 
I never lost hope or our integrity. We always knew we’d eventually find a
place to live.”
315
Chapter 22: In Intimate Relationships
When in doubt, try humor
I remember once being in a social situation
where another man was doing all he could to
hassle me. He directed one hostile, sarcastic
remark after another toward me, hoping I would
react in kind. He was one of those folks who just
love a good fight.
At first, I was quiet and tried to just ignore what
he was saying. But he just kept on until I could
feel myself getting angry. And then I resorted to
the one thing that has helped me deal with
adversity my whole life: humor. I began making
jokes about the situation we were in and every-
one around me (except him) started to laugh.
The more he fussed, the more I joked. It wasn’t
long before he got quiet and basically retreated
from the conversation. Not long after that, he up
and left the situation altogether. Humor had won
the day!

And so it is (or should be) when you’re confronted by a loved one’s anger.
Clearly, the anger is a major problem — but it isn’t a reason to become a
victim. To keep from being a victim, try the following:
 Hang on to your sense of hope. When you’re faced with an angry loved
one, it’s easy to fall into a trap of hopelessness. To keep hope intact, try
spending some time with a supportive friend who can remind you that
you’re not a worthless person.
 Do something, anything, to avoid feeling a sense of helplessness. For
example, practice the stress inoculation technique I described earlier in
this chapter.
 Use the support resources at your disposal to keep yourself safe. If you
need a “safe house,” this is not the time to be bashful — call a friend and
ask for sanctuary. Call a lawyer and ask for advice. Call the police, if nec-
essary, and ask for protection.
 Be assertive. Find your voice and speak up for yourself. Remind yourself
that you have a right to be treated with respect and restraint — and the
last thing you need is to be someone else’s verbal or physical punching
bag! There’s a big difference between telling your angry loved one, “I
can’t stand it when you treat me like this!” and saying, “I won’t stand for
that kind of behavior anymore.” Can’t has to do with ability; won’t indi-
cates a sense of will.
 Be honest with yourself — admit you have a problem. As long as you
deny the reality of a loving-but-angry relationship, you’re stuck. You
have to acknowledge a problem before you can hope to solve it. This
book is about solving problems associated with anger — yours and the
other person’s — but you can’t make any progress until you face up to
the truth.
If reading this chapter (or the book as a whole) does nothing more than keep
you from being a victim of another person’s anger, then it’s worth the price of
admission!

Ten Ways to Raise 
a Non-Angry Child

 Becoming an effective parent
 Teaching children to share the world
 Understanding tough love
B
eing a parent is no easy job, especially when it comes to your child’s emo-
tional development. All children start out life angry. If you’re a parent, you
know all too well the angry cry that your baby lets out when she’s hungry,
lonely, or in pain. Anger is her way of telling you, without using words, “I need
something!” The louder the cry, obviously, the stronger and more urgent the
need. Your job — at least as your baby sees it — is to satisfy that need, what-
ever it is. You are — like it or not — the key to managing your baby’s anger.
But, if you try the techniques in this chapter, that won’t always be the case.
In this chapter, I show you ten ways to shift that responsibility for managing
anger to your child — much the same as you teach her to ride a bike, play
soccer, or read. You discover how to be her emotional coach — showing her
the rules for appropriately expressing her anger and teaching her the skills
she needs to achieve success in this important area of her life. Think of it this
way: If you help your child manage her anger while she’s still a kid, she won’t
need this book when she’s a grown-up!
Being an Emotional Coach
You love your child, you care about his well being, and you want him to be 
successful in life — unless your name is Miss Hannigan and your kid is named
Annie, I can make these assumptions about you. Unfortunately, just because you
love your child doesn’t mean you’re prepared to be an emotional coach. Fear
not: You can be a great coach for your kid. Just keep the following tips in mind:

 Make raising a non-angry (or at least reasonably angry) child, who
will eventually develop into an emotionally mature adult, a primary
goal. Most parents have goals for their kids — but these goals tend to
have more to do with education, sports, and being popular than they do
with personal traits or emotions. Many parents assume the latter will
come naturally — unfortunately, they’re wrong. Make raising a non-
angry child a formal part of your job description as a parent from day
one and keep it in mind at all times — even when you’re frustrated and
ready to tear your hair out!
 Be active and hands-on when you’re interacting with your child. Can
you imagine a baseball coach who sits quietly in the dugout and lets his
players figure out how to play the game all by themselves without any
instruction or practice? Of course, you can’t. So, how in the world can
your kid learn to manage complex emotions like anger on his own? He
can’t — and he won’t! Coaching requires active involvement on your
part. Your kid needs your support, your guidance, your wisdom, your
knowledge, your patience, your acceptance, and your skills. Coaching is
not about being permissive (overindulgent and inattentive) or indiffer-
ent (emotionally detached).
Talk openly with your child about your feelings — including anger —
and help him understand that emotions are a normal part of being
human. Use the information in Chapter 2 to help your child appreciate
the distinction between different levels of anger (for example, anger
versus rage). Find ways to illustrate for your child the difference
between being hurt (an emotion) and doing hurt or harm (a behavior) to
himself or others. And then make it absolutely clear that the former is
acceptable, but the latter is not.
 Be proactive. Typically, parents wait for children to misbehave — for
example, throwing a temper tantrum in a grocery store — and then they
punish them after the fact. This style of parenting is reactive parenting
at its best (or worst, depending on how you look at it): “You were terri-
ble in the store, so you go to your room for the rest of the day.”
Coaching is proactive. For example, when you’re about to enter a store,
you remind your child, “We’re about to go into the grocery store.
Remember the rules we’ve talked about? Make sure Mommy can always
see where you are, don’t run off, and if Mommy says you can’t have
something and you get upset, tell Mommy how you feel instead of kick-
ing and screaming. If you don’t follow the rules, we’ll go straight home.
But if you behave yourself, we’ll stop by the park afterwards and play on
the swings! Okay?” That’s being proactive.
 Accentuate the positive. I know an anger-management specialist whose
approach makes good sense. He not only tells his clients what not to do
when they become angry — interrupt, point, threaten, curse, break
things — he offers them a list of positive behaviors that involve self-
restraint. That’s coaching!
320
Part VII: The Part of Tens

Reward your child — with praise, not cookies — when she asks for
something rather than demands it. Teach her how to be considerate of
others and then reward her when she shows you that she’s learned that
lesson. Emphasize the importance of apologizing when you’ve acted
badly — teaching your child to say “I’m sorry” is teaching her to take
responsibility for her own behavior.
 Focus on solutions rather than problems. I’m afraid most children (cer-
tainly most teenagers), if asked, would agree with the statement
“Parents preach — coaches teach.” Kids don’t need adults to tell them
they have problems; what they need (and desperately want) is for some-
one to tell them what to do about those problems. Saying to an angry
kid, “Stop yelling — you’re upsetting everybody,” doesn’t address his
problem (whatever occasioned the outburst). Telling him to stop yelling
also doesn’t provide him with a solution that goes beyond simply vent-
ing his rage.
Instead, say to your son, “I can tell by how angry you are that you’re
having a problem. It would help if you could tone it down a little so I can
understand what the problem is — then maybe I can help you. I’m sure
it’s something that we can work out if we can just get past your anger.
Now, what were you trying to tell me?”
321
Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Raise a Non-Angry Child
A win-win solution
For years, Frank and his daughter would get into
angry exchanges as soon as he walked in the
house after a long day. He would ask, “How are
you?” She would reply with an angry tone. He
would respond in kind. And, they were off to the
races in something that always ended badly.
One day, Frank decided he didn’t want to play
this game anymore, so — as the parent — he
took responsibility for finding a way out of this
no-win situation. He realized that he and his
daughter were both trying to achieve the same
end — to have the last word. Because of her
youth, he knew she had more energy to fight her
way to the finish but less wisdom and willing-
ness to change than he did.
From that day forward, Frank always let his
daughter have the last word (win), but he
reserved the right to decide when that was
(win). As soon as he saw the conversation
heading down the wrong road, he immediately
signaled a timeout and disengaged. She fol-
lowed suit, and they no longer escalated into
fights.
In calmer moments, Frank made sure his daugh-
ter got the coaching lesson: Anger only begets
anger, and cooler heads prevail whenever
there’s a conflict. Sounds like a win-win solution
to me.

Children who start out life noticeably impulsive and excitable are difficult to
coach, and they require more parental effort (read: tough love) than those
whose temperaments are more thoughtful and calm. You may have several
children, each with a different temperament.
Starting Early and Talking Back
It’s never too early to begin raising a non-angry child. The emotional dialogue
between parents and children begins when children are around 3 months of
age, when infants start “speaking out” through emotions about what they
want. That’s when you need to start talking back. Children are smarter than
you think — they respond to comforting words, “You’re upset I know, but it’s
okay,” and a comforting tone before they even learn to talk. (See Chapter 5
for a discussion of the importance of “toning it down.”)
Your soothing words and calm tone tell your child that you’re comfortable
with emotion — yours and hers. The last thing you want to teach her is that
you’re afraid of her anger. That will either cause her to suppress her feelings
(in an effort to not upset you), or worse yet, empower her to misuse anger as
a means of controlling you and everyone else around her. These are not the
lessons that will lead to emotional maturity.
When a colleague of mine who treats emotionally disturbed kids heard I was
writing this book, he told me, “Be sure and tell your readers that you can take
the most disturbed 7-year-old child and, with enough professional help, turn
him completely around. But, it takes three times more effort and skill to see
improvement in a minimally disturbed teenager. Those first few years are a
window of opportunity — and they’re so important.”
Creating Teachable Moments
Don’t wait for situations to come up that anger your child. Take the initiative
and create opportunities so that he can learn to cope with negative feelings —
I call these teachable moments. Here are some possibilities — choose one and
give it a try:
 Play a game with your child and purposely don’t let him win.
Afterwards, ask him, How do you feel when you lose? Are you angry?
How do you think other people feel when they lose? Are they angry?
What do you think we should do about your angry feelings? What do you
322
Part VII: The Part of Tens

think we should do about other people’s angry feelings? There are no
right or wrong answers here. The point is just to get a conversation
going between you and your child so that you can both start thinking
about anger and how to manage it when it happens.
 Present a situation to your child that involves the violation of some
moral principle — fair play or honesty. Ask him how he thinks the
person who is being treated unfairly or lied to feels. Does he think that
person would get mad? Does he think the anger the other person is feel-
ing is justified? Ask the child what he thinks should be done about these
feelings. For example, what if other kids refused to let your child join in a
game they were playing or what if your child’s older brother took some-
thing of hers and then lied and said he didn’t take it?
 Ask your child to pretend that he’s angry and then pretend to hurt
someone else’s feelings. What would he say to the other person to 
hurt her? Ask your child, How do you think your angry words would
make that person feel? How would you feel after you said those angry
words? Are you sure you want to hurt someone just because she made
you angry?
Children’s books about anger are great teaching aides. Typically, they contain
one or two lessons about how to manage anger (for example, you’ll get over
being angry when you find something to enjoy or you’ll stop being angry
when you find something to do that parents can say yes to rather than no).
Some of my favorites include: I Was So Mad, by Mercer Mayer; When I Feel
Angry, by Cornelia Maude Spelman; When Emily Woke Up Angry, by Riana
Duncan; and Poems About Anger by American Children, edited by Jacqueline
Sweeney.
Being a Positive Role Model
A colleague of mine who has a lot of experience working with troubled 
children heard I was working with angry adolescents. He advised me to 
pose the following question to these angry, delinquent youngsters when I
first met them: “Who else in your family is as angry as you are?” Without 
fail, the children immediately identify one or both of their parents — most
often the father.
You can’t teach what you can’t do! If you can’t control your own temper, 
how can you expect you child to? Like it or not, you’re your kid’s primary
role model, good or bad, during his formative years. So, when it comes to
coaching, you have to start with yourself.
323
Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Raise a Non-Angry Child

If you’re unsure whether you’re a good emotional role model, ask yourself the
following questions:
 Do you get irritated or angry at least once a day?
 Would you rate the intensity of your anger 7 or above on a 10-point scale?
 When you’re angry, do you stay that way for more than 30 minutes?
 Have you ever pushed, shoved, or hit someone in anger?
 Have you ever threatened or cursed someone in anger?
 Would you say you are angrier than many people you know?
 Do your loved ones seem to worry about your temper?
 Have you ever lost a job because of your temper?
 Have you ever lost a friend because of your temper?
 Have you ever spent money repairing something because of your temper?
If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may not be the best
role model for how to handle anger well. But look at the positive side:
Managing anger can be a learning experience for both you and your child.
You can learn as you teach.

Some years ago, I was asked to make a commu-
nity presentation called, “Dealing with the Angry
Child,” as part of a larger program aimed at help-
ing parents cope with their kids’ attention deficit-
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drug use, and
academic failure. To my surprise, the room was
packed with distressed looking parents, all of
whom seemed eager to hear what I had to say.
As I spoke, I paid particular attention to one man
who stared at me continuously throughout my
presentation with what I would call a serious and
somewhat hostile expression on his face.
Afterwards, as parents stopped to thank me for
my remarks, he passed by without comment, his
expression unchanged.
Several days later, I was gassing up my car
alongside three other men when one of them —
the man I’d seen at the presentation — loudly
exclaimed, “Doc, I heard what you said — you
know, about angry children having angry parents
and how we should look at ourselves as well as
our children. I went home and thought about that
and decided you’re right. I have to work on my
anger before I can help my son with his. Thanks.”
Wow. Who would have thought he got the 
message?

Adults who do not have a bad temper tend to remember their parents as
being loving, warm, close, easygoing, calm, and relaxed. If you want your kid
to grow up to be an adult without a bad temper, try to be all these things, and
you’re on the right path.
Putting the “I” in Emotion
Always correct your child when she says something like, “He made me
angry.” Instead, teach her to say, “I got angry when he. . . .” This is what self-
control is all about — taking responsibility for our own feelings. Until your
daughter learns that no one else can make her angry, she won’t achieve emo-
tional maturity. Children need to understand as early as possible that no one
has the power to make them feel anything — not fear, not anger, not sadness,
not pride, not even joy — that power resides solely in themselves.
As your kid’s coach, try to express your emotions the same way: “I get frus-
trated when you don’t obey me.”
Labeling Feelings Appropriately
Before your child can express his feelings in an appropriate and constructive
way, he needs an emotional vocabulary. You need to teach him to describe —
as clearly as possible — how he feels and then help him find the right label to
fit that emotion.
Young children are often unable to differentiate emotions except to say, “I feel
bad” or, “I feel good.” Your job is to help your kid fine-tune those feelings so
he can better appreciate his unique reaction to the world around him.
Consider the following conversation between a mother and her 5-year-old son:
Mother: Honey, is something wrong?
5-year-old: I don’t feel good.
Mother: Do you mean you’re sick? Or are you upset about something?
5-year-old: I’m upset.
Mother: Okay, tell Mommy how you’re feeling. What does your upset 
feel like?
325
Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Raise a Non-Angry Child

5-year-old: I don’t like this stupid puzzle. I can’t make the pieces go
together.
Mother: So, you’re angry. You feel angry because you can’t figure it out.
5-year-old: Yeah, I’m mad. I hate that stupid puzzle.
Mother: I understand. Sometimes people get angry when they can’t make
something work. Sometimes I feel the same way you do.
5-year-old: You do? You get upset, too?
Mother: Yes, I get angry just like you.
As your child gets a little older, you need to teach him to distinguish between
different levels of anger — mild, moderate, and severe. An easy way to do this
is have him rate the intensity of his feelings on a scale from 1 to 10 (more
about this in Chapters 2 and 6). A rating of 1 to 3 equals irritation; 4 to 6
equals mad; and, 7 and above equals rage. If your son rates his anger as a 7,
your response should be, “Honey, you’re not just angry, you’re in rage. Why
are you that angry?”
Identifying Causes
Don’t be satisfied by having your child identify what she’s feeling; ask her
why she’s feeling that way. At first, identifying the cause of their anger can 
be difficult for children — it’s difficult even for adults — because they aren’t
used to tying their emotional reactions to what’s going on around them at 
the time.
326
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Don’t tell me how I feel
Thirteen-year-old Jennifer was in a bad mood
as she sat in the kitchen watching her mother
fix dinner. Trying to help, her mother said, “You
don’t have to be so irritable. I know you’re tired
and hungry. Supper will be ready shortly.”
Jennifer exploded, “Don’t tell me how I feel!
These are my feelings. I know how I feel — you
don’t!” Was she right? Absolutely. Did her
mother mean well? Absolutely. But her mother
still should’ve asked if Jennifer was upset, and
if Jennifer said yes, her mother should’ve asked
why. Then she should’ve left the rest of the con-
versation — or lack thereof — up to Jennifer.
As it turned out, Jennifer wasn’t tired or hungry
— she was upset (angry) about something
another girl had said to her that morning at
school. Who knew?

Your child may feel anger because
 Someone (or something) has hurt her self-esteem. Youngsters are 
apt to become angry when someone criticizes, demeans, or otherwise
attacks their self-esteem. If someone — including you — calls your child
“stupid” or “an idiot,” she’ll probably feel angry. She may also feel angry
when she fails at something (for example, she fails a spelling test in
school); she may say something like, “The teacher thinks I’m dumb!”
 She’s gone through some kind of physical abuse. Children get angry
when they’re physically attacked — hit, shoved, pushed — or even when
they’re threatened by the possibility of being harmed in some way. (Who
can blame them?) Remember: Physical abuse can come in the form of
the bully on the playground — it doesn’t have to be an adult harming
your child for it to be abuse.
 She’s not getting something she wants. All kids want things in life, and
when they’re prevented from achieving or obtaining those things, they
become frustrated and then angry. Anger is their way of protesting, their
way of saying, “I’m not getting what I want!” Your child’s anger can be
especially intense if she feels entitled to the thing in question or if she’s
the type of child who has difficulty in delaying gratification (“I want what
I want now!”).
 Her moral principles (yes, she does have them) have been violated.
Just like adults, children have values and beliefs about how the world
should work — the world should be fair, people should tell the truth,
people should be kind to someone who’s hurt. If circumstances violate
those values, they often get mad — “That’s not fair!,” “You’re lying!,” or
“Leave her alone — can’t you see she’s not feeling well?”
 She feels helpless. One of the main reasons children get angry has to do
with situations in which they feel out of control, helpless, frightened,
and vulnerable. Kids may, for example, get angry when their parents
fight a lot because they’re afraid that one parent will hurt the other or
the family will break up. Adolescents may become very angry when a
fellow student commits suicide or dies of cancer — things over which
they have absolutely no control.
You may often think you know why your child is angry or upset, but most of
the time you’re wrong. Don’t assume. Ask.
Teaching Problem Solving
Children have trouble coping with emotion. Coping is a skill that your child
has to learn — and you can be a huge help to your child when it comes to
teaching coping skills.
327
Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Raise a Non-Angry Child

Your child needs help dealing with the feelings themselves (anger) as well 
as the causes (frustration). You can begin by asking your child, “What do 
you think we should do about your anger?” or, “What is it that you’re angry
about?”
If you start by focusing on the feeling itself, you can try to help him choose
from a number of strategies that work:
 Distracting himself (shifting his focus onto something else, preferably
something positive)
 Creating some distance from the angry situation (going for a walk or
drive)
 Relaxing away the tension he feels (taking ten deep breaths)
 Changing his emotional tone (laughing)
 Using his imagination to find a safe place in his mind to escape his anger
If you decide to focus on what caused his anger, have him consider strategies
such as:
 Confronting the person with whom he is angry (in a nonaggressive way)
 Sharing his concern about that other person with a neutral party
 Resigning himself to the fact that some things just can’t be changed
 Changing how he looks at the other person’s behavior
 Giving in to his anger and doing what the other person asks (I call this
the “whatever” response)
 Asking for help in dealing with the problem
Teaching your child to vent his anger by yelling or hitting something like 
a punching bag or a pillow might provide some temporary relief, but in 
the long run it only leads to more anger and ultimately to an increase in
aggressive behavior.
Choosing the Third Alternative
Human nature is such that we all start out life — as children — reacting to
our own anger by either fleeing or fighting. The fight-or-flight response is part
of our animal heritage. Flight means simply that a child runs away from the
source of his anger (and the anger itself) and chooses not to deal with it — 
to let it pass. Fight means exactly that — the child attacks the source of her
328
Part VII: The Part of Tens

anger directly, either physically or verbally. In a study of eighth graders, 
for example, I found that 26 percent of children would just “walk away” 
when confronted with another child’s anger and try to avoid the situation
altogether. Forty-five percent fought back — answering anger with anger. 
And 29 percent indicated they would “walk away initially, but return later to
discuss the problem” — that’s the third alternative, the one that I recommend.
Learning the Difference between
Wanting and Getting
It’s normal — in fact, it’s downright healthy — to want things in life. But, 
children need to be taught as early as possible the difference between want-
ing something and getting it. This important distinction is especially hard for
young children to grasp and that’s where you — the parent — come in.
Spoiling a child basically means that you teach the child “what he wants, he
gets, always.” Spoiled children have a fierce sense of entitlement (“I’m spe-
cial, I’m all powerful, and no one can tell me no”), which quickly leads to
anger when their wants are not immediately satisfied.
I was having lunch in a fast-food restaurant once, when in came a father,
mother, and two kids. While the father and son ordered the food, the mother
and daughter went to get a table. The daughter went straight to a table by the
window, but the mother said, “Let’s sit over here. The sun’s too bright there.”
The daughter exploded, angrily shouting, “I’m sitting here. I want to be in the
sun. You can sit where you want!” Without a word, the mother — head down
with a look of defeat on her face — moved to the table by the window. When
the father came with the food, he asked his wife, “Why are you sitting here?
There’s too much sun.” The mother replied — head still down — “Just sit
here. Let’s not have an incident.”
Do your child a big favor — say no once in a while. Eventually, your kid will
hear no from someone, and she needs to know how to respond when she
doesn’t get her way.

Ten Ways to Combat Road Rage
In This Chapter
 Sharing the road
 Loosening your grip
 Realizing that the other driver could be you
 Enjoying the journey
I
f you’re one of those road warriors who drive with vengeance and anger in
their hearts, you’re in luck: This chapter gives you ten helpful ideas to use
to combat road rage. With the tools in this chapter, all you’ll need to do next
time you get behind the wheel is fasten your seat belt, check your mirrors,
put your hands at the 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock positions, and go!
Don’t Rush
When I was young, my Uncle Aubrey used to take a bunch of us kids on trips
to see interesting sights and expand our horizons. He was a great guy, but
boy did he drive slowly. We were always saying, “Aubrey, hurry up — we
want to get there!” His answer was always the same: “Boys, if you’re in a
hurry, you need to leave a half-hour earlier.” And he was right.
If you’re driving aggressively and getting impatient with everyone else on the
road, chances are you feel that you’re in a rush. Much like the Mad Hatter in
Alice in Wonderland, you’re thinking to yourself, “I’m late, I’m late, I’m late, for
a very important date!” You didn’t allow yourself enough time and now time
is your enemy.
When your mind gets in a rush, your body follows suit. Everything increases —
blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension. You’re poised for action and ready
to jump on whomever gets in your way. And you use anger to clear the way!

Stop rushing and start relaxing. Calculate how long it will take you to drive
somewhere and add an extra 10 minutes for every 15 to 30 minutes of driving
time. Or see if you can drive without looking at the time — before you put
your key in the ignition, put your watch in your pocket, and stick a piece of
masking tape over your car’s clock. (And don’t cheat by listening to a radio
station that tells you what time it is.)
Loosen Your Grip
How hard do you hold the wheel when you drive? If you’re an aggressive
driver, you’re probably using the “death grip.”
Loosen your grip and you’ll be amazed at how much more relaxed you feel
while driving. Hold the steering wheel like you would hold a soft-boiled egg 
or a child’s hand — gently. The change in physical tension is instantaneous.
The relaxation you experience in your hands travels up your arms into your
shoulders and neck, and down into your lower back — throughout your
entire body, just like that. Give it a try.

That’s why I took the job
My wife and I had just left New York after a
three-day visit with a large health organization
that was recruiting me to join their research
faculty. Because of mechanical failure in our
plane, we were forced to land at an airport 45
miles away from our destination. When we
arrived at the other airport, we had to rent a car
to get back home. I was exhausted after days of
negotiating and power lunches and in no mood
for hassles like this.
I flew into a rage in the airport and drove out of
the rental lot with a vengeance.
But, then, as we drove through the rural coun-
tryside and saw the Blue Ridge Mountains,
something miraculous happened: I began to
relax and my rage quickly subsided. What a
peaceful, serene journey that was!
Years later, when someone asked me why I
decided to turn down the New York job —
where I would have commuted to and from the
city by subway every day — and instead moved
to Virginia to start a private practice, I thought
a minute and said, “Actually, I think it was that
unexpected drive from the airport — what a
transforming experience.”
Twenty-five years later, I still enjoy that drive.

Focus on the Journey rather 
than the Destination
Aggressive drivers have tunnel vision. They’re focused on only one thing —
where they’re going, the destination. If you’re an aggressive driver, if any-
body gets between you and your destination, there’s hell to pay. You’re 
staring straight ahead. Your mind is way out front, down the road, around 
the next turn before you get there. You’re on a mission!
If this sounds familiar, you’re missing the big picture: the journey. And life —
even driving your kids to school or running to the grocery store — is all
about the journey. Destinations come and go, but the journey is continuous.
Relax into the journey — look around at the people, scenery, and events that
you’re passing, and you’ll probably be a whole lot less angry.
Be the Other Driver
Are you the person who roars past the little old man driving under the speed
limit, shaking your fist and screaming for all the world to hear, “They shouldn’t
let old farts like you drive!” and “Get out of the way, you old fool!”?
Well, consider this for a second: One day, if you’re lucky and your road rage
doesn’t kill you first, you’ll be that old guy. That’s right — that will be you,
slumped down in the seat, white hair hardly visible above the wheel, staring
straight ahead, oblivious to everything around you, and driving 35 in a 55-
mph zone. Try to visualize yourself as the other driver. Put yourself in his
shoes. And then ask yourself, “How would I want other drivers to act toward
me?” Not with rage, I’m guessing.
Here are some anger-freeing ways to think about slow drivers:
 “Wow, that’s great that he can still drive at his age.”
 “I hope I’m still that independent and able to get around on my own
when I’m that old.”
 “Maybe that’s the secret to growing old gracefully — driving slow.”
 “I bet he feels a whole lot more relaxed right now than I do.”
 “He doesn’t look angry — maybe there’s a lesson here.”
333
Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Combat Road Rage

Take the “I” out of Driver
To paraphrase that great American philosopher, Woody Allen, “We’re all bozos
on the same freeway.” Driving should be about us, right? Not just about you?
Of course, road-ragers would disagree: “Get out of my way, damn it!” “You’re
holding me up — I’m going to be late for my appointment.” “I hate drivers like
you.” “You’re not going to pass me — no way.”
Make driving more about the other guy:
 “I’ll slide over and let him pass. He’s in more of a hurry than I am.”
 “The way she’s driving, she must really be enjoying her day.”
 “Wow, what an angry fellow — I wouldn’t want to be in his shoes.”
 “I used to drive like she does, but thank God I don’t any more.”
 “I’m sure they have somewhere important to go, too.”
Drive with humility. Be ordinary — don’t think of yourself as someone who’s
entitled to special consideration out there on the highway. Avoid stereotyp-
ing your fellow travelers — women drivers, old drivers, teenage drivers,
Yankee drivers, redneck drivers, truckers. Don’t set yourself apart from the
pack. Just be one of the bozos and relax.
Look on the Bright Side
Every problem has a silver lining. If someone ahead of you in traffic slows
you down, you end up feeling less rushed. That’s good. If you tend to speed a
lot and suddenly find yourself stuck behind a slower driver with no opportu-
nity to pass, maybe he’s keeping you from getting your next speeding ticket.
That’s good. If you see another driver doing something that you regard as
“just plain ignorant,” that makes you a smarter driver, right? That’s good. If it
takes you longer to get somewhere than you had planned, you end up having
more time to relax and enjoy your own private thoughts along the way. That’s
good. You can use this kind of logic with just about every situation.
The next time you feel yourself on the verge of rage, ask yourself: “What 
good can possibly come from this?” When you come up with an answer, 
you can relax.
334
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Repeat after Me: They Are 
Not the Enemy
Rage is an emotion that people reserve for their true enemies. Enemies are
those folks that you believe mean to harm you deliberately and intentionally.
“That S.O.B. tried to hit me just now!” He’s out to get you — plain and simple.
So, you protect yourself with rage.
Problem is, those other drivers aren’t your enemies. They don’t even know
you — they’re strangers. Truth is they’re not thinking at all about you —
they’re thinking about themselves. There’s no grand conspiracy operating
here! Granted, they may be a nuisance sometimes, but your enemy? Nah.
Here’s the litmus test: You’re driving down a stretch of highway with no cars
anywhere around you. Up ahead, you see a truck on the side of the road,
waiting to enter the lane of traffic. Just as you get to where the truck is, the
driver suddenly and without warning pulls out in front of you, causing you to
hit your brakes and veer into the left lane.
Why did he endanger you (and himself) by doing that rather than waiting
until you passed? Did he do that on purpose? Was he waiting for the right
moment to whip out in front of you, hoping to startle you and maybe cause
you to crash? Or is it just that he just doesn’t know any better — he doesn’t
have a clue about safe driving? If you choose the first answer, I guarantee
you’ll experience road rage. If you choose the second answer, you won’t.
The choice about how to respond to a situation is always yours!
335
Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Combat Road Rage
I’m just ordinary
A middle-aged client of mine, who was referred
to me for anger management, recently came to
a startling conclusion about himself that, he
said, greatly reduced his day-to-day anger —
on the road, at work, at home. Here’s what he
said: “It suddenly dawned on me — I’m just an
ordinary guy who lives on a cul-de-sac like a lot
of other guys. Yeah, I have a good job and a
management title, but I’m still just an ordinary
guy. All this time — years — I thought I was
someone special and I got angry when other
people didn’t treat me that way. No more.”

Stop Catastrophizing
So the woman in front of you is slowing you down — it’s not the end of the
world. So that guy is stuck in the passing lane, holding everybody else up —
it’s not the end of the world. So the person in front of you doesn’t move as
soon as the light changes to green — it’s not the end of the world. Or is it?
Is your world that fragile and tenuous? Do you actually view the everyday
hassles of driving as a series of unending catastrophes — sudden, unex-
pected events that cause great harm? Are they on par with finding out that
you have cancer? That you just lost most of your retirement money because
of a major correction in the stock market? That your lovely daughter wants to
marry a drug dealer? Now, I grant you — those are catastrophes!
Richard found out the hard way about the perils of catastrophizing. He was
stopped at an intersection when a young woman pulled up from behind and
tapped Richard’s new car on the bumper. It wasn’t much of a tap, but she did
make contact. He jumped out of his car, ran to where she was sitting in her
car, and launched into a tirade of threats and cussing. The police arrived soon
after, and, much to Richard’s surprise, arrested him for assault in public. It
turned out the girl called the police not only to report the accident but also to
report Richard’s angry behavior. He had to go to court, retain an attorney, and
was found guilty. He ended up in anger management, rather perplexed, still
rationalizing his rageful behavior “because she hit me, damn it!”
The next time you find yourself getting outraged while driving, ask yourself
the following ten questions:
 Is this worse than a terrorist attack?
 Is this as bad as a category-5 hurricane?
 Is this the hill you want to die on?
 Is this really worth ruining your day by losing your cool?
336
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
His wife says . . .
I’d been working with an angry man and his wife
for about a year, and things were steadily improv-
ing. “We’re good, things are good,” they both
agreed. “And what do you attribute that to?” I
asked. The wife spoke up immediately and said,
“It’s that card you gave my husband — the one
that says, ‘They are not the enemy.’ He carries it
with him all the time. I think he’s beginning to real-
ize that, while he may have problems with our
daughters and me, we really aren’t his enemies.”

 Is this worth having a heart attack over?
 Is this worth all the energy it will take to be rageful?
 Has this happened to you before and did you survive it?
 On a scale of 1 to 10, is this really a 100?
 Are you bigger than this — or, is this bigger than you?
 Is this a sign that the end of the world is at hand?
If the answer to these questions is a resounding yes, then by all means rage
on. If not, you can relax.
Stop Being So Rational
I can hear you now. “What in the world is he thinking, pulling out in front of
that other car? He should know better than that. God, that’s dangerous.” Or,
that old frustration: “Why can’t she pull over and get in the non-passing lane
if she’s only going to go the speed limit? She’s not supposed to be in this lane.
What an idiot!”
The mistake here — which leads to your anger — is that you’re trying to
understand why other people drive the way they do. My advice: Stop trying
and just accept things as they are, not how you want them to be or think they
should be. Driving behavior in humans is no more rational than any other
aspect of life. Why do people vote the way they do? Why do people eat the
way they do? Why do people do drugs?
All you’re doing is (literally) driving yourself crazy. Expect less and relax more.
Settle for Just Being Irritated
Anger occurs at three different levels of intensity. As I cover in Chapter 2,
these levels include
 Irritated: Ratings of 1 to 3 on a 10-point intensity scale. Other adjectives
you can replace for irritated include annoyed, bothered, or fretted.
 Mad or angry: Ratings of 4 to 6 on a 10-point scale. You can also think of
this as infuriated, incensed, or exasperated.
 Rage: Ratings of 7 to 10 on a 10-point scale. Synonyms include furious,
berserk, and irate.
337
Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Combat Road Rage

No one is asking you to feel nothing when you get frustrated while driving.
The problem isn’t that you get angry; the problem is that you get too angry
(experiencing rage). Why not settle for just being irritated or even mad? That
way you’re still in control of your actions even though you’re obviously not a
happy camper. After all, no one ever gets arrested for “road irritation,” or
we’d probably all be in jail.
Everything is a matter of degree, and anger is no different. Why not tone it
down and relax?

Absolute rubbish
Some years ago, I attended a workshop on road
rage sponsored by an auto club. A panel of so-
called experts — all engineers — concluded
that the two main reasons people experience
rage are: (1) There are simply too many cars on
the highways, and (2) The entry and exit ramps
on major roadways are too steep.
This, of course, assumes that all drivers are
normal people who have complete control over
their emotions. I can hear the defense lawyers
now, “Your honor, my client is not guilty — the
road make him do it.” Absolute rubbish! The
reason people experience road rage is because
they don’t know how to manage their anger.

Chapter 25
Ten Anger-Freeing Thoughts
In This Chapter
 Keeping a healthy perspective
 Achieving inner peace
 Taking the steam out of anger
 Helping anger on its way
A
nger management is a case of mind over matter. What you have in your
mind matters — it spells the difference between being full of anger
versus anger-free. In this chapter, I offer you ten thoughts that will help you
manage anger — yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
No One — Absolutely No One — 
Can Make You Angry without 
Your Consent
Every time I hear (and I hear it a lot!) someone say “He or she made me mad,”
I want to run up and tell that person how absolutely wrong this is. When
people say that, it’s just their way of trying to make other people responsible
for their emotions. No circumstance, person, or event has that power over
you. You aren’t a car that can be started by another person’s key — and you
should be glad about that!
What is true is that external events can (and do) provide you with oppor-
tunities to become angry. The unfortunate part is that people embrace this
opportunity all too readily. You can, if you want, choose not to lose your
temper. Either way, the choice is entirely yours.
The next time — and there will be a next time — you find yourself facing an
opportunity to become angry, remember this comforting thought: No one can
make you angry — no matter how hard he tries — unless you decide to let him.

Anger Boomerangs — And So Does Love
You’ve probably heard numerous sayings like “What goes around comes
around” and “You reap what you sow” — most of them coming out of the
mouth of one of your parents. Annoying as those sayings may be, they do
serve a purpose: They remind you that life is, by and large, a two-way street.
There is a certain reciprocity to human emotion; in other words, anger begets
anger, fear engenders fear, and one act of kindness is often followed by
another. People respond in kind to whatever you throw out there. Throw out
anger and you get back anger. Throw out love and you get back love.
Emotions work just like a boomerang.
If you want others to treat you positively, begin each day by asking yourself
the following questions:
 Who can I care about today?
 Who needs my understanding, not my judgment?
 How many kind remarks do I want to offer others today?
 To whom can I be sympathetic?
 How many people can I hug before the sun goes down?
 How often can I say please and thank you?
 How happy are people when they see my smiling face?
Then see how difficult it is for you to get angry.
It’s Only Money
The whole world is one giant, global economy. In the end, whether you real-
ize it or not, most things come down to money — money gained and money
lost. Far too often, you may find yourself upset — angry — because some-
thing goes wrong and it has a monetary consequence. If the cost is minimal,
you get irritated. If the cost is more than you can (or want to) bear, you fly
into a rage.
What you need to consider, however, is that it’s only money. It’s not the end
of the world or civilization as we know it. It doesn’t mean that your life is
ruined forever. It’s only money.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Years ago, when I was not as good at managing anger as I am now, I used to
get mad when one of my kids called to say she had been involved in an auto-
mobile accident. My first thought — I’m sorry to say — was, “How much is
that going to cost?” And, my first question to my kid was, “How’s the car?
How much damage was there? Is it drivable?” (Interestingly, this is exactly
how my father used to react when one of his kids had an accident.) Then one
day it hit me: The more important question — the one I should be asking — 
is “Are you okay? Are you hurt? How are you?” The rest is only a matter of
money and metal!
It’s all about priorities. What I discovered was that my love and concern for
my children was far more important than the “cost” of anything.
Other People Are Not the Enemy
From an evolutionary standpoint, anger serves a purpose. It is a means to an
end — survival. Emotions were built into your nervous system to help you
adapt to life so that you can live long and well. Anger has a single purpose —
to protect you from your enemies, those who threaten your very existence.
But who are these enemies and how many do you have?
If your kid comes home with a D on his report card, is he your enemy? If your
wife isn’t as interested in sex as you’d like her to be, is she your enemy? If
someone ahead of you in the express-checkout line at the grocery store has
11 items rather than 10, is she your enemy? Is everyone who gets in your
way, inconveniences you, or beats you at poker your enemy? If so, then
you’re going to be angry a lot!
Reserve the status of “enemy” for those people who truly threaten your phys-
ical safety. Think of the rest of them as people — son, daughter, spouse,
person who doesn’t see fit to obey the rules in the checkout line — not ene-
mies. Unless the lady in the checkout line pulls out a gun and asks you for
your wallet, she’s just an annoying person, not an enemy — and not worth
getting angry over.
Life Isn’t Fair — Not Even at the Top
Sometimes humans are funny creatures. When life goes the way you want it
to, you call that fair. When it doesn’t, you call that unfair. You decide what’s
fair and what’s unfair. In other words, you’re the ultimate judge. How you
think about what happens to you is what determines how angry you get.
Every time you think “unfair,” there’s the anger!

Chapter 25: Ten Anger-Freeing Thoughts

I ask you the question I asked myself one night when I went to check on my
son and found him sleeping soundly with a look of contentment on his face:
“Is it fair that I have two beautiful, healthy children, while my sister had a son
who died at 13 from cancer?” My argument: Having healthy children is no
more fair than having unhealthy children. The difference is in our minds. And
no one ever gets angry because life is fair in a way that favors him.
So, maybe the answer is to stop thinking about whether what comes your
way today is fair or unfair and just deal with it as best you can — without
being judgmental, which is where the anger comes in. Try it.
Also, remember to be grateful even when life doesn’t go the way you want 
it to.
Energy Is a Terrible Thing to Waste
Have you ever heard that old saying that “Energy is wasted on the young”?
The same can be said of anger. It takes energy for you to be angry, it takes
energy for you to stay angry, and it takes energy for you to do all the things
you do to express or relieve anger. Too much anger can leave you utterly
exhausted.
Are you sure you want to devote so much energy to one emotion — or, for
that matter, to emotions in general? You don’t have an unending supply of
energy — you can use it up like any other resource. Where you spend your
energy pretty much defines your day. If you put most of it into tasks, at the
end of the day you feel productive. If you put most of it into anger, at the end
of the day you feel angry, defeated, exhausted, and unproductive.
As long as you’re alive, you’re spending energy on something. The question
is: “What are you spending it on?” Is your energy working to benefit you — 
to improve your lot in life — or it is simply wasted? You get to choose.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Maintaining vitality in old age
Research shows that as people age, they con-
sistently report fewer episodes of anger, less
intense anger, and that they get over anger
more quickly. Maybe that’s because the angry
people die off early. Or maybe it’s because those
who survive have discovered one of the great
lessons of life: It takes energy to preserve life.
And you have a lot less energy at your disposal
in the second half of your life as you do in the
first half. So, people are forced to become good
stewards of energy as a way of ensuring vitality.

Don’t Kid Yourself: We’re All Bozos
Woody Allen was right — we’re all bozos. The minute you forget that, you’re in
trouble. Thinking of yourself as superior to other people is an open invitation
to anger. Anger tends to flow downhill toward those you regard as inferior — as
sillier, stupider, and less contentious than you are. You tell yourself: “They —
the lesser people — deserve what they get when they make me mad.”
Besides anger, the second major cause of counterproductive behavior in the
workplace — malicious gossip, refusing to help a co-worker, outright theft —
is what psychiatrists call narcissism (more about this in Chapter 20). The 
narcissistic employee is one who has a grandiose view of herself — she sees
herself as a “special” bozo, a bozo whose opinions should carry more weight
than others, and a bozo who feels that all the other employees are just there
to cater to her needs. In other words, the queen bozo!
The same is true in marriage. According to marriage expert Dr. John Gottman,
as soon as contempt enters the relationship, the marriage is doomed.
Contempt goes along with a feeling of superiority and it goes way beyond
ordinary criticism of your partner — the intent behind it is to demean, insult,
and psychologically harm your so-called loved one.
Settle for just being an ordinary — nothing-special — bozo. Then you can relax.
This Isn’t the Hill You Want to Die On
Just as in war, as you struggle your way through life, you must invariably
decide which objectives — hills, goals, or issues — are worth dying for and
which ones matter less. The more things matter — the more of an emotional
investment you have in something — the angrier you get when things don’t
go your way. And, as my former colleague Dr. Redford Williams at Duke
University so poignantly put it, “Anger kills!” So, it pays to be selective in the
battles you choose to fight.
Reserve the right to fight just one major battle a day, and live to fight 
another day!
There’s Nothing You Can Achieve in Anger
That You Can’t Achieve without It
Anger can be used constructively in some instances (see Chapter 11), but
anything you want to achieve in life can be yours without anger.
343
Chapter 25: Ten Anger-Freeing Thoughts

Somewhere along the line, people forged an association between getting mad
and getting things done. And now the anger comes automatically when we’re
faced with obstacles, challenges, and problems. It’s what experimental psy-
chologists call superstitious reinforcement — in other words, we think anger is
vital to our day-to-day survival when it’s really not.
Try to remember the last time you got angry. What was the problem that led
to your getting mad? Could you have dealt with this problem in any other
way without needing to be angry? Be honest. Did your anger help or hinder
your ability to resolve the problem? I’m willing to bet it was a hindrance.
At some time in the history of mankind, anger no doubt served a purpose —
mainly through its connection with physical survival. But in today’s world,
anger has nearly outlived its usefulness. Too often, anger is nothing more
than a bad habit that is passed down from one generation to the next.
When You’re Dealing with People, You’re
Not Entitled to a Damn Thing!
If you discover one thing from reading this book that will help you manage
anger better, I hope it’s this: You’re not entitled to anything. I believe that a
sense of entitlement is the root cause of much of the anger in today’s fast-
moving, complex world.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
How I stopped hating insurance companies
In my experience, insurance companies hate to
pay mental-health providers. They would rather
pay thousands of dollars for a major back oper-
ation than a few hundred bucks for our efforts to
teach a client how to live successfully with pain.
Over the years, I’ve had many angry conversa-
tions with claims agents who balked at paying
my bill. And, although I won all these battles, I
found myself getting mad just thinking about
making one of those calls.
What I’ve discovered in recent years, however, is
that things go much better — the conversations
are shorter and more pleasant, and I get paid
quicker — when I don’t lead (or jump in) with an
angry, defensive attitude. Now, when the insur-
ance rep says, “I can’t pay this bill,” instead of
hollering into the phone I simply reply, “Oh, I’m
sure you can. You work for a big company and I
bet you can do just about anything you set your
mind to. What I need from you is to tell me how I
can help you pay my bill. I know your time is valu-
able, and I don’t want you to spend any more of
it on my problem that need be. So, what can I do
to help?” Believe it or not, this strategy works!
And I no longer hate insurance companies.

According to the dictionary, an entitlement is anything you have legal claim 
to — like the title to a piece of property. Historically, it was something that
English kings granted noblemen for their loyal service. And yet today, if
you’re like me, you apply the concept to just about every facet of your 
everyday life.
Here are some common examples of things people have a false sense of 
entitlement to:
 A spouse who always agrees with them
 Children who always obey them
 Consideration from everyone, all the time
 Continuous employment
 Peace of mind
 A world where everything is fair
 Cheap gasoline
 Prosperity
 The respect of their peers
 A stable economy
 Freedom from oppression
 Having their ideas, beliefs, and opinions valued by everyone
 A good night’s sleep
 A promotion at work
 A car that always starts first thing in the morning
The problem with a sense of entitlement is that it conveys a sense of obliga-
tion, certainty, and predictability — for example, your adolescent kids will,
without question, always do what you ask of them because they owe you that
courtesy for bringing them into this world. And what happens if they don’t
see it that way? You get angry.
Forget the entitlements and instead negotiate successfully for what you want
(not demand) out of life — a raise, a promotion, respect, love, and recogni-
tion. It makes life flow a whole lot easier.
