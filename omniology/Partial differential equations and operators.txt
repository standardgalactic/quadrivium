Operators in Hilbert space
CHAPTER 5
Operators in Hilbert space
1. Some results in Banach algebras
In this section pA, }¨}q stands for a complex Banach algebra. A complex Banach
algebra is a Banach space over the complex number ﬁeld C with a multiplication
px, yq ÞÑ xy which is jointly continuous. Moreover we will assume that there is
an identity e.
This multiplication has the following properties: xpyzq “ pxyqz,
px ` yq z “ xz ` yz, x py ` zq “ xy ` xz, αpxyq “ pαxqy “ xpαyq for all x, y, z P A,
and for all α P C. The identity element e satisﬁes ex “ xe “ x for all x P A.
Moreover, the norm satisﬁes the multiplicative property }xy} ď }x} }y} for all x, y P
A. In addition, }e} “ 1. An element x P A is called invertible if there exists an
element y P A such that yx “ xy “ e. The group of invertible elements of A is
denoted by GpAq. It is known that GpAq is an open subset of A, and that the
application x ÞÑ x´1 is a homeomorphism from GpAq onto GpAq. If x P A is such
that }e ´ x} ă 1, then x belongs to GpAq. Its inverse is given by y “ lim
nÑ8

j“0
pe ´ xqj.
Observe that |λ| ą }x} implies that λe´x “ λ pe ´ λ´1xq belongs to GpAq. A linear
functional φ : A Ñ C which is multiplicative in the sense that φ pxyq “ φpxqφpyq
for all x, y P A, is called a complex homomorphism. Most of the time it is assumed
that φpeq ‰ 0, and so φpeq “ 1. Let φ be a non-zero complex homomorphism.
Notice that 1 “ φpeq “ φpxqφ px´1q, x P GpAq, and so φpxq ‰ 0, Consequently, for
x P A arbitrary and |λ| ą }x}, we see that φpxq ‰ λ. In other words |φpxq| ď }x}.
Whence a complex homomorphism is automatically continuous. We also need the
following lemma.
5.1. Lemma. Let pxnqn be a sequence in GpAq which converges to x P A. Suppose
that M :“ supn }x´1
n } ă 8. Then x P GpAq.
Proof. We estimate
››e ´ x´1
n x
›› ď
››x´1
n pxn ´ xq
›› ď
››x´1
n
›› }xn ´ x} ď M }xn ´ x} ă 1,
for n large enough. It follows that x´1
n x belongs to GpAq for n large enough. But
then px´1
n xq´1 xn “ x´1. This completes the proof of Lemma 5.1.
□
5.2. Definition. Let pA, }¨}q be a complex Banach algebra.
The symbol GpAq
stands for the group of invertible elements. Then GpAq is an open subset of A and
the application x ÞÑ x´1 is a homeomorphism from GpAq to GpAq. Let x P A. A
complex number λ belongs to the spectrum of x, denoted by σpxq, if λe ´ x does

not belong to GpAq. It follows that σpxq is a closed subset of C, and that σpxq is
contained in the disc of radius }x}. It can be proved that σpxq ‰ H. It follows that
σpxq is a compact subset of C contained in the disc tλ P C : |λ| ď }x}u, which is non-
empty. The spectral radius ρpxq of x P A is deﬁned by ρpxq “ sup t|λ| : λ P σpxqu.
Without a complete proof we mention the following theorem, which is Theorem
10.12 in Rudin [113].
5.3. Theorem. Let x be an element of a Banach algebra. Then σpxq is a non-empty
compact subset of C, and the spectral radius ρpxq satisﬁes
ρpxq “ lim
nÑ8 }xn}1{n “ inf
nPN }xn}1{n .
(5.1)
Outline of a proof. Let 0 ‰ x P A. The fact that σpxq ‰ H follows from
the observation that the function f : λ ÞÑ pλe ´ xq´1 is a holomorphic A-valued map
on Czσpxq. If σpxq were empty, then this function would be a bounded holomorphic
function. By Liouville’s theorem it would be constant, and so fpλq ” 0. So that
x “ xe “ xfpλq pλe ´ xq “ 0, which is a contradiction. The equalities
ρpxq “ lim sup
nÑ8 }xn}1{n “ inf
n }xn}1{n
(5.2)
follow from the following considerations. If λ belongs to σpxq, then it is easy to see
that λn belongs to σ pxnq, and so |λ| ď }xn}1{n. Hence
ρpxq ď inf
n }xn}1{n .
(5.3)
As above, put fpλq “ pλe ´ xq´1, and let Γr be the contour Γrpϑq “ reiϑ, ´π ď φ ď
π. Then, for r ą ρpxq,
xn “

Γr
λnfpλq dλ,

(5.4)
From (5.4) it follows that
}xn} ď rn`1 sup t}fpλq} : |λ| “ ru ,
and hence lim sup
nÑ8 }xn}1{n ď r. Since r ą ρpxq is arbitrary we infer that
lim sup
nÑ8 }xn}1{n ď ρpxq.
This in combination with (5.3) yields the inequalities in (5.2) and completes an
outline of the proof of Theorem 5.3.
□
5.4. Remark. The second equality in (5.3) can be shown without an appeal to the
spectral radius ρpxq. Deﬁne the number ρ as ρ “ infn }xn}1{n, ﬁx ε ą 0 and choose
m P N in such a way that }xm} ď pρ ` εqm. Then, for ℓě 1, ℓP N, and 0 ď j ď m,
we have
››xℓm`j›› ď }xm}ℓ››xj›› ď pρ ` εqℓm }xj} .

(5.6)
Since ε ą 0 is arbitrary, the inequality in (5.6) shows the inequality lim sup
nÑ8 }xn}1{n ď
inf
n }xn}1{n, and therefore
lim sup
nÑ8 }xn}1{n “ inf
n }xn}1{n .
The following theorem says that a complex Banach algebra which is also a division
algebra is isometrically isomorphic with the complex number ﬁeld.
5.5. Theorem (Theorem of Gelfand-Mazur). Let A be a Banach algebra in which
every non-zero element is invertible. Then there exists an algebra isomorphism λ :
A Ñ C which identiﬁes A and C as algebras.
Proof of Theorem 5.5. Let x P A, and choose λ P σpxq. If λ1 ‰ λ, then
λ1e ´ x is non-zero, and so λ1e ´ x is invertible. In other words σpxq is a singleton,
tλpxqu say. Then x ´ λpxqe “ 0, and the mapping x ÞÑ λpxq identiﬁes A with C as
algebras. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.5.
□
5.6. Corollary. Let M be a proper maximal ideal in a commutative Banach algebra
A. Then there exists a complex homomorphism h : A Ñ C such that M “ Nphq “

Operators in Hilbert space
Proof of Corollary 5.6. Consider the space AM :“ A{M with the stan-
dard multiplication and standard norm }x ` M} “ inf t}x ` y} : y P Mu. Observe
that }e ` M} “ 1. Then AM is a division algebra. For assume that x R M, then
since M is a maximal proper ideal there exists y P A such that xy ` M “ e ` M.
It follows that, in the Banach algebra AM, px ` Mq py ` Mq “ xy ` M “ e ` M.
Consequently, A{M is a division algebra. By Theorem 5.5 there exists an algebra
isomorphism λ : A{M Ñ C. Let π : A Ñ A{M be the mapping x ÞÑ x`M. Finally
put hpxq “ λ pπpxqq, x P A. Since λ pe ` Mq “ 1, it follows that h is a complex
homomorphism with hpeq “ 1 and with Nphq “ M. This completes the proof of
Corollary 5.6.
□
Proposition 5.7 is a slight improvement of Lemma 10.16 in [113]. It is applied there
with V and W being groups of invertible elements in a complex Banach algebra, or
with V and W being the resolvent sets of elements of a Banach algebra.
5.7. Proposition. Let V and W be open subsets of a locally connected topological
Hausdorﬀspace. Assume that V Ď W. The following assertions are equivalent (by
a component of W a connected component of W is meant):
(i) The boundary of V is a subset of the boundary of W, i.e. boundarypV q Ď
boundarypWq;
(ii) V “ Ť tcomponent of W : component pWq X V ­“ Hu.
Proof. (i) ñ (ii).
Let x be an element of V and let Wx be the connected
component of W that contains x. Let y P WxzV . Then it follows that y P WxzV ,
because assume that y belongs to V . Then y belongs to V zV “ boundary pV q.
Assertion (i) then implies that y belongs to the boundary of W. Since W is open it
then follows that y does not belong to W. This is a contradiction. As a consequence
the inclusion y P WxzV certainly holds. But then it is obvious that Wx “ pWx X V qY
`
WxzV
˘
. However, Wx is open and connected, and so since x belongs to Wx X V
and since Wx X V is open we get Wx “ Wx X V , and hence Wx Ď V . This proves
(ii).
(ii) ñ (i). Let x P V zV . Assume that x belongs to W. Let Wx be the connected
component of W that contains x. Then there are two possibilities:
Wx X V “ H
or
Wx X V ­“ H.
If Wx X V “ H, then it follows that Wx X V “ H and thus x R V .
But, by
hypothesis, x P V zV “ boundary pV q. Consequently, Wx X V ­“ H. But from (ii)
it then follows that V Ě Wx and so x P V zV “ H. This is a contradiction. From
x P V zV it apparently follows that x P V zW Ď WzW. Whence
boundarypV q “ V zV Ď WzW “ boundarypWq,
and so the proof of Proposition 5.7 is complete.

5.8. Proposition. Let A and B be complex Banach algebras. Let eB be the identity
of B, and suppose that eB P A and that A Ď B. Then the inclusions GpAq Ď
A X GpBq and boundaryApGpAqq Ď boundaryA pA X GpBqq hold.
Proof. Let x be an element of GpAq. Then there exists z P A with the property
that xz “ zx “ e. So there exists z P B with xz “ zx “ e. Whence it follows that
GpAq Ď GpBq X A.
Let x be an element in the A-boundary of GpAq. Then x R GpAq and there exists a
sequence pxnq Ď GpAq with the property that limnÑ8 xn “ x. By Lemma 5.1 (see
also Lemma 10.17 in [113]) we see supn }x´1
n }A “ 8. Assume now that x does not
belong to the A-boundary of the set pA X GpBqq. Then we get either x P A X GpBq
or x R A X GpBq. But x in the A-boundary of GpAq implies x P GpAq Ď A X GpBq.
Hence, if x does not belong to the A-boundary of A X GpBq, then we have x P
A X GpBq. But then, since xn Ñ x, we obtain that x´1
n
Ñ x´1 in GpBq. But then
it follows that supn }x´1
n } ă 8. This is a contradiction.
This completes the proof of Proposition 5.8.
□
5.9. Proposition. Again A and B are Banach algebras with A Ď B and with
e “ eB P A. Let x P A. Then the following inclusions hold: σApxq Ě σBpxq and
boundary pσApxqq Ă boundary pσBpxqq.
Proof. Since we have
CzσApxq “ tλ P C : λe ´ x P GpAqu
Ď tλ P C : λe ´ x P GpBqu “ CzσBpxq,
it follows that σApxq Ě σBpxq. Next let λ be in boundary pσApxqq. Then it follows
that λ P boundary pCzσApxqq. Consequently, there exists a sequence pλnq in CzσApxq
such that λn Ñ λ, and such that λe ´ x R GpAq. But then we get λne ´ x P GpAq Ď
AX GpBq, with λn Ñ λ and with λe´x R GpAq. Since supn
››pλne ´ xq´1›› “ 8 it is
impossible that λe ´ x belongs to GpBq, and hence λ belongs to boundary pσBpxqq.
This completes the proof of Proposition 5.9.
□
The following theorem says that if elements x and y in a Banach algebra are close,
the their spectra are also close.
5.10. Theorem. Let Ωbe an open subset of C, and let x P A be such that σpxq Ă Ω.
Then there exists a δ ą 0 such that }y} ă δ implies σ px ` yq Ă Ω.
Proof. The function λ ÞÑ
››pλe ´ xq´1›› is continuous on the set CzΩ. In addi-
tion, it tends to 0 when |λ| Ñ 8. It follows that
M “ sup
␣››pλe ´ xq´1›› : λ P CzΩ

If y P A is such that }y} ă 1{M, then we have
››pλe ´ xq´1 y
›› ă 1, and consequently,
for λ P CzΩwe have that the element
λe ´ px ` yq “ pλe ´ xq

e ´ pλe ´ xq´1 y

is invertible. This proves 5.10 with δ “ 1{M.
□
1.1. Symbolic calculus. Let K be compact subset of an open subset Ωin
C. Then there exists a concatenation of oriented curves Γ “ γ1 ˚ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˚ γn, where
γj : rαj, βjs Ñ Ω, 1 ď j ď n, are continuous diﬀerentiable curves, which surrounds
K in the sense that

fpζq “

(5.8)
holds. We say that the contour Γ surrounds K in Ω. If Ωis an open subset of C, the
we write AΩ“ tx P A : σpxq Ă Ωu. Theorem 5.10 says that AΩis an open subset
of A. The mapping f ÞÑ rf, f P Hol pΩq where
rfpxq “

Γ
fpλq pλe ´ xq´1 dλ,
x P AΩ,
(5.9)
is what people call a symbolic calculus. Here Γ surrounds σpxq in Ω. Let Ą
Hol pAΩq
be the collection of all functions x ÞÑ rfpxq, x P AΩ, as given by (5.9). It is noticed
that, by Cauchy’s theorem, the value of rfpxq does not depend on the choice of Γ
as long as Γ surrounds σpxq in Ω. Some properties are collected in the following
theorem.
5.11. Theorem. Let Hol pΩq and Ą
Hol pAΩq be as above. The mapping f ÞÑ rf is
a linear multiplicative isomorphism from Hol pΩq onto Ą
Hol pAΩq, which is jointly
continuous in the following sense. If pxnqn Ă AΩis a sequence which converges to
x P AΩ, and if pfnqn Ă Hol pΩq which converges uniformly on compact subsets of
Ωto f P Hol pΩq, then rfpxq “ lim
nÑ8 fn pxnq. Moreover, if pnpλq “ λn, λ P C, then
rpnpxq “ xn, n P N.
For the convenience of the reader we insert a proof.
Proof. We begin with the multiplication property, i.e.
Ă
fgpxq “ rfpxqrgpxq,
x P AΩ, whenever f and g belong to Hol pΩq. To this end we pick x P AΩ, and
choose concatenations Γ1 and Γ2 which surround σpxq in Ω, but Γ2 is also chosen
in such a way that it surrounds the set Ω1 :“ tλ P Ω: IndΓ1pλq “ 1u. Since Γ1
surrounds σpxq we know that σpxq Ă Ω1. Then we have, for f, g P Hol pΩq,

This proves the multiplication property. Next let pxnqn Ă AΩwhich converges in
A to x P AΩ, and let pfnqn be a sequence of holomorphic functions on Ωwhich
converges, uniformly on compact subsets of Ωto a function f. Then, from complex
analysis it follows that f belongs to Hol pΩq. Since the sequence pxnqn converges to
x P AΩ, it follows that the set K deﬁned by K “ Ť8
n“1 σ pxnqYσpxq is compact. This
can be seen as follows. Let pαnqn be a sequence in K. We have to show that some
subsequence pαnkqk converges in K. If there exists k P N such that σ pxkq contains
inﬁnitely many members of the sequence pαnqn, then we are done, because σ pxkq is
compact, and so some subsequence of the sequence pαnqn converges (in σ pxkq Ă K).
If, on the other hand, for every k the spectrum σ pxkq contains at most ﬁnitely
members of the sequence pxnqn, then without loss of generality we may assume that
αn P σ pxnq. Then we choose a decreasing sequence of open subset pUkqk with the
following properties σpxq Ă Uk Ă Uk Ă Ω, Uk is compact, and σ pxq “ Ş
k Uk.
Then by Theorem 5.10 the subsets AUk “ ty P A : σpyq Ă Uku, k P N, are open.
It follows that for nk large enough αnk belongs to Uk. Since, e.g., U1 is compact,
the subsequence pαnkqk Ă U1 has a further subsequence which converges to α in
U1. Since αnk belongs to Uk, and σpxq “ Ş
k Uk, it follows that α is a member of
σpxq Ă K. This proves that the subset K is sequentially compact. But for subsets
of C this is the same as compact. Next let Γ be a concatenation of curves which
surrounds K in Ω. Then we have

Let Γ˚ be the image of Γ in C. Then Γ˚ is a compact subset of ΩzK. Since taking

follows that

the proof of Theorem 5.11.

For an alternative proof, using Runge’s theorem, we refer the reader to the literature;
for example Theorem 10.27 in Rudin [113] is a good source. This is also true for
the following theorem.

Then rfpxq is invertible in A if and only if fpλq ‰ 0 for all λ P σpxq. Moreover,

Proof. If f P Hol pΩq is such that fpλq ‰ 0 for all λ P σpxq, the there exists
an open subset Ω1 of Ωwhich contains σpxq such that fpλqgpλq “ 1 for some
holomorphic function g deﬁned on Ω1. By Theorem 5.11 with Ω1 in place of Ω,
we see that rfpxqrgpxq “ e “ rgpxq rfpxq. Hence, rfpxq is invertible. Next suppose
that fpαq “ 0 for some α P σpxq. Then there exists a holomorphic h function on
Ωsuch that fpλq “ pλ ´ αq hpλq, λ P Ω. It follows that rfpxq “ px ´ αeqrhpxq “
rhpxq px ´ αeq. Hence, since α belongs to σpxq, rfpxq is not invertible. This proves
the ﬁrst part of the theorem.
Next ﬁx β P C. Then, by deﬁnition, β belongs to σ

if and only if rfpxq ´ βe
is not invertible in A. By the ﬁrst part, applied to f ´ β, this is the case if and only
if f ´ β has a zero in σpxq, that is, if and only β P f pσpxqq.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.12.

If x “ x˚, then y “ y˚, and λ P σpyq if and only if λ P σpyq. The element

This proves assertion (a) of Theorem 5.14.
(b) Next, we proceed with proving the uniqueness of “taking square roots” with
spectrum in the closed right half plane. Let y P A be such that y2 “ x and suppose
that y satisﬁes the assumptions made in assertion (b).
We will prove that y is
represented as in (5.15). First we observe that
σpyq Ă tλ P C : ℜλ ą 0u Y t0u .
(5.18)
This is because y2 “ x and σpxq X p´8, 0q “ H, so that by the spectral map-
ping theorem σpyq X iR Ă t0u.
Since, by assumption σpyq is contained in the
closed right half plane, the claim in (5.18) follows.
Let, for r ą 0, the semi-
circle tλ P C : ℜλ ě 0, |λ| “ ru be parameterized by Γrpϑq “ reiϑ, ´ 1

1.3. On C˚-algebras. We need the following property of positive elements in
a C˚-algebra A. A C˚-algebra is a Banach algebra with an involution which has
the following property }x}2 “ }x˚x}, x P A. An element u P A is called positive if
u “ u˚ and if σpuq Ă r0, 8q. If u P A is positive, then the same is true for }u} e ´ u.
5.15. Proposition. If u and v are positive elements in a C˚-algebra A, then u ` v
is also positive.
Proof. Put α “ }u}, β “ }v}, and γ “ α ` β. We know that σpαe ´ uq Ă r0, αs
and σpβe ´ vq Ă r0, βs. Then it follows that }γe ´ w} ď γ. Since σ pγe ´ u ´ vq is
real it follows that σ pγe ´ u ´ vq Ă r´γ, γs, and consequently, σpu ` vq Ă r0, γs.
This completes the proof of Proposition 5.15.

5.16. Proposition. Let y be an element of a C˚-algebra A. Let A0 be the algebra

From Proposition 5.15 it follows that w˚w ` ww˚ “ 2u2 ` 2v2 is positive in the
sense that w˚w ` ww˚ is self-adjoint and has its spectrum in the closed positive
half-axis.
On the other hand, by (5.33) we see that w˚w ` ww˚ is negative in
the sense that its spectrum is contained in p´8, 0s and that w˚w ` ww˚ is self-
adjoint. But elements whisk are positive as well as negative are 0. Consequently,
w˚w ` ww˚ “ 0. Proposition 5.17 below shows that the spectrum of w˚w coincides,
except for possibly the complex number 0, with the spectrum of ww˚. Hence, w˚w
is positive as well as negative; its spectrum is just t0u. Thus,
}w}2 “ }w˚}2 “ }w˚w} “ ρ pw˚wq “ 0.
Here ρ pw˚wq denotes the spectral radius of w˚w. However, if w “ 0, then we get
p|yy˚| ´ yy˚q yy˚ “ 0,
and hence,
p|yy˚| ´ yy˚q2 “ 2 pyy˚ ´ |yy˚|q yy˚ “ 0.
Consequently, yy˚ “ |yy˚| is positive. The representation in (5.29) then follows from
(5.30).
This completes the proof of Proposition 5.16.

Next we apply Theorem 5.14 and Proposition 5.16 to obtain the polar decomposi-
tions of elements in a C˚-algebra.
5.19. Theorem. Let y be an element of a C˚-algebra A with identity e. Deﬁne the
following elements:

|y˚| “ 2

yy˚ `
t2e ` yy˚˘´1 dt,
(5.34)
Then the following assertions hold true:
(1) The elements |y| and |y˚| are positive and satisfy the following equalities:
|y|2 “ y˚y, |y˚|2 “ yy˚. They are the only positive elements in A which
satisfy these equalities.
(2) The element u˚
ε is given by
u˚
ε “ 2

(5.35)
(3) The following equalities hold:
lim
εÓ0 uε |y| “ y
and
lim
εÓ0 u˚
ε |y˚| “ y˚.
(5.36)
(4) The following equalities hold:
lim
εÓ0 u˚
εuε |y| “ |y|
and
lim
εÓ0 uεu˚
ε |y˚| “ |y˚| .
(5.37)
5.20. Remark. Since by Proposition 5.16 elements of the form yy˚, and so also
of the form y˚y, are positive, we see that |y| is positive. It is called the (positive)
square root of the element y˚y, and often written as |y| “ ?y˚y. Heuristically, the
equalities in (3) are written as y “ u |y| (polar decomposition of the element y) and
y˚ “ u˚ |y˚| (polar decomposition of the element y˚). The equalities in (4) suggest
to write u˚u |y| “ |y| and uu˚ |y˚| “ |y˚| respectively. These equalities say that u
and u˚ are partial isometries on the range of (the multiplication operators) |y| and
|y˚|. In the context of bounded or closed linear operators with, domain and range
in a Hilbert space, these notions will be justiﬁed in the sense that |T| is the unique
positive operator S with S2 “ T ˚T, that Ux “ 2

is a so-called partial isometry, i.e. }Ux} “ }x} for x in the closure of the range of
|T|, and that U ˚U is an orthogonal projection on the closure of the range of |T|.
Also notice that the closure of the range of |T| coincides with the closure of the
range of T ˚T. A similar observation goes for the operator T ˚.

Proof of Theorem 5.19. (1) From Proposition 5.16 it follows that the ele-
ment y˚y is positive. From assertion (b) in Theorem 5.14 it follows that |y|2 “ y˚y.
A similar argument applies to yy˚. The assertion about the uniqueness follows from
assertion (b) in Theorem 5.14.
(2) This assertion follows from the fact that taking an adjoint is a continuous oper-
ation, and from the observe that for t ą 0 the equality
`

Operators in Hilbert space
1.4. On Gelfand transforms. Let A be a commutative Banach algebra with
identity e. In the following theorem ∆A stands for the collection of all non-zero
complex homomorphisms. Let h P ∆A. Then we know that |hpxq| ď }x}, x P A: see
the beginning of Section 1. In other words ∆A is a weak˚-closed subset of the closed
dual unit ball. Equipped with the relative weak˚-topology the set ∆A is a compact
Hausdorﬀspace. To every x P A we can assign a continuous function px : ∆A Ñ C
such that
pxphq “ hpxq,
h P ∆A.
(5.50)
Again, let h P ∆A. It also follows that
|h pxq|n “ |h pxnq| ď }xn} ,
and so |hpxq| ď ρpxq, x P A. In other words
sup
hP∆A
|pxphq| “ sup
hP∆A
|hpxq| ď ρpxq.
Next let x P A, and let λ P σpxq.
Then the ideal pλe ´ xq A is contained in a
proper maximal ideal M. From Corollary 5.6 it follows that there exists a complex
homomorphism h : A Ñ C such that hpyq “ 0 for all y P M. Then λ “ hpxq.
Conversely, if x P A, and if h P ∆A, then hpxqe ´ x belongs to null-space of h, and
hence hpx| P σpxq.
5.21. Definition. The space ∆A equipped with the (relative) weak˚-topology is
called the maximal ideal space of the commutative Banach algebra A. The transform
x ÞÑ px is called the Gelfand transform of x P A.
Some of the results of in the following theorem follow from the previous discussions.
5.22. Theorem. Let ∆A be the maximal ideal space of a Banach algebra A. Then
the following assertions hold true.
(a) ∆A is a compact Hausdorﬀspace.
(b) The Gelfand transform is an algebra homomorphism of A onto a subalgebra
pA of C p∆Aq. Its kernel is RadpAq, the radical of A, i.e. the intersection of
all its maximal ideals.
(c) For each x P A, the range of px is the spectrum σpxq. Hence }px}8 “ ρpxq ď
}x}.
Proof. The Banach-Alaoglu theorem implies that the closed unit ball of A˚
viewed as a complex Banach space is weak˚-compact. Since it is not so diﬃcult to
prove that ∆A is weak˚-closed, it follows that ∆A is compact for the weak‹-topology.
The remarks preceding Deﬁnition 5.21 then essentially prove Theorem 5.22.
□
The following theorem shows that a commutative C˚-algebra A is ˚-isometric with
C p∆Aq as C˚-algebra (with complex conjugation as involution).

5.23. Theorem (Theorem of Gelfand-Naimark). Let A e a commutative C˚-algebra
with maximal ideal space ∆A. The Gelfand transform is then an isometric isomor-
phism of A onto C p∆Aq, with the additional property that
x
x˚phq “ pxphq “ hpxq,
x P A, h P ∆A.
(5.51)
In addition, if u P A is positive, then pu ě 0.
Proof. Let h P ∆A and u “ u˚ P A. Let hpuq “ α ` iβ with α, β P R. Then,
since hpeq “ }h} “ 1, we have,
α2 ` pβ ` tq2 “ |h pu ` iteq|2 ď }u ` ite}2 “
››u2 ` t2e
›› ď
››u2›› ` t2.
(5.52)
From (5.52) it follows that α2 ` β2 ` 2βt ď }u2}, t P R, and hence β “ 0. Hence we
have hpuq “ α P R. If x P A is arbitrary, then we write x “ u ` iv with u “ u˚ and
v “ v˚. Then h px˚q “ h pu ´ ivq “ hpuq´ihpvq “ hpuq ` ihpvq “ h pu ` ivq “ hpxq.
This proves the equalities in (5.51). Next we will show that the Gelfand transform
is isometric. To this end we pick x P A and consider

(5.53)
The equalities in (5.53) show }px}8 “ }x}, x P A. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem
entails that the space pA :“ tpx : x P Au is dense in C p∆Aq. Let f P C p∆Aq. Then
there exists a sequence pxnqn Ă A such that lim
nÑ8 }f ´ pxn}8 “ 0. Since }xn ´ xm} “
}pxn ´ pxm}8, it follows that pxnqn is a Cauchy sequence in A. The algebra A being
complete implies that there exists x P A such that x “ lim
nÑ8 xn. It is the easy to see
that f “ px.
From assertion (c) of Theorem 5.22 it follows that the range of pu coincides with σpuq.
Since, by hypothesis, σpuq is contained in r0, 8q, the ﬁnal conclusion in Theorem
5.23 follows.
□
5.24. Proposition. Let A be a C˚-algebra generated by x and x˚ and the iden-
tity.
Suppose that x and x˚ commute; i.e.
xx˚ “ x˚x.
Deﬁne the mapping

Ψpfqphq “ f phpxqq, h P △A. If f is holomorphic
on a neighborhood Ωof σpxq, then Ψpfq “ rfpxq.
Proof. Let Γ be a closed curve which surrounds σpxq in Ω. If h belongs to △A,
then by Cauchy’s theorem we have

and hence the Gelfand transform of the element Ψpfq ´ rfpxq is identically 0. The
mapping y ÞÑ py is a C˚-algebra isomorphism from A onto C p△q, and consequently
Ψpfq ´ rfpxq “ 0. The proof of Proposition 5.24 is now complete.

let y be an arbitrary element in Γ. Then the subset

Since G1 is open and
connected it follows that G1 “ Γ. This completes the proof of Proposition 5.24.
□
5.26. Corollary. Let x belong to GpAq, and let x1, . . . , xn be elements in A. Since
the curve t ÞÑ x exp ptx1q ¨ ¨ ¨ exp ptxnq x´1, 0 ď t ď 1, connects the element e with
x exp px1q ¨ ¨ ¨ exp pxnq x´1, it follows that x exp px1q ¨ ¨ ¨ exp pxnq x´1 belongs to G1 “

1.5. Resolution of the identity. The following deﬁnition will be employed

the reader to the concept of resolution of the identity. In case the resolution of the

Consequently, α does not belong to the spectrum of fpTq. This shows that the com-
plement of the ET-essential range is contained in the complement of the spectrum of
fpTq. In other words, the spectrum of fpTq is contained in the ET-essential range of

Proof. The ﬁrst part of the proof follows in exactly the same manner as in the

Operators in Hilbert space
A densely deﬁned closed linear operator T is called normal if D pTq “ D pT ˚q and
if T ˚T “ TT ˚. The following theorem establishes a spectral decomposition for a
normal operator T with domain and range in the Hilbert space H.
5.33. Theorem. Let T be a normal operator with domain and range in the Hilbert
space H. Then there exists a resolution of the identity ETp¨q pertaining to T such
that T “
ş
C λ dETpλq. In fact a vector x P H belongs to DpTq “ D pT ˚q if and only
if
ş
C |λ|2 d ⟨ETpλqx, x⟩ă 8.
Outline of a proof. The operator T admits a polar decomposition of the
form T “ U |T|. Here we may assume that U is unitary, that |T| ě 0, and that U
and |T| commute: U |T| “ |T| U. The polar decomposition is explained in Theorem
5.41. In fact the operator U in Theorem 5.41 is only a partial isometry. However,
in case T is normal we have N pT ˚q “ N pTq, and we may assume that Uy “ y
if Ty “ T ˚y “ 0. In addition, the closure of the range of T ˚ is the same as the
closure of the range of T. It follows that the partial isometry U which possesses the
property that U ˚U is the orthogonal projection on the closure of the range of T ˚
can be considered as a unitary operator. For details see Corollary 5.42. From the
construction of U it follows that it commutes with |T|. The operator U admits a
resolution of the identity EUp¨q: see (5.60). So we have U “
şπ
´π eiϑ dEUpϑq. The
operator |T| is self-adjoint and positive. So by Theorem 5.31 there exists a resolution
of the identity E|T|p¨q such that |T| “
ş8
0 t dE|T|ptq. The resolutions of the identities
EUp¨q and E|T|p¨q commute in the sense that EU pB1q E|T| pB2q “ E|T| pB2q EU pB1q,
whenever B1 is a Borel subset of the interval r´π, πs, and B2 is a Borel subset of
r0, 8q. For the latter see Lemma 5.34. Deﬁne the resolution of the identity ETp¨q
on the Borel ﬁeld of C by
ETpBq “ EU b E|T|

.
Then T “
ş
C λ dETpλqptq, and x P DpTq if and only if
ş
C |λ|2 d ⟨ETpλqx, x⟩ă 8.
This completes an outline of the proof of Theorem 5.33.
□
5.34. Lemma. Let T be a densely deﬁned normal operator on a Hilbert space H.
Let T “ U |T| be its polar decomposition where the operator U is supposed to be
unitary.
Let EUp¨q be the resolution of the identity corresponding to U, and let
E|T|p¨q be the resolution of the identity corresponding to |T|.
Let B1 be a Borel
subset of the interval r´π, πs, and let B2 be a Borel subset of r0, 8q.
Then the
equality EU pB1q E|T| pB2q “ E|T| pB2q EU pB1q. In other words the resolutions of the
identity EUp¨q and E|T|p¨q commute.
Proof. From the constructions of U and |T| it follows that U |T| “ |T| U: see
the proof of Theorem 5.41. Then it also follows that U ˚ |T| “ |T| U ˚: see Corollary
5.42. The operator |T| is closed, and has dense domain. Let µ P C be such that
ℜµ ě 0, and let λ ą 0. Then R pλI ` µ |T|q “ H, and the following inequality holds
for all x P D p|T|q:

From the Lumer-Phillips theorem it follows that ´µ |T| generates a contraction

: see Theorem 6.13. Moreover, from the way Theorem
6.13 is proved we infer that the operators U and e´tµ|T|, t ě 0, commute, and that
the same is true for U ˚ and e´tµ|T|, t ě 0. Since µ is arbitrary in the closed right-half

where f is any continuous function on the unit circle in C, and where g is any

form gptq “
ş
R e´iξtφpξq dξ where φ is an arbitrary function in L1 pRq. By another
limiting procedure the equality in (5.66) also holds if f and g are indicator functions
of open and compact subsets of the unit circle and the positive half-axis respectively.
But then it is also true for indicator functions of Borel subsets. However, the latter
is the same as saying that the resolutions of the identity EUp¨q and E|T|p¨q commute.
This completes the proof of Lemma 5.34.

Then the spectrum of fpTq “

σpTq fpλq dETpλq is contained in the ET-essential
range of f. If f : σpTq Ñ C is continuous, then σ pfpTqq is contained in the closure
of f pσpTqq.
The proof of Theorem 5.35 follows exactly the same pattern as that of Theorem
5.32. Therefore it is omitted.

As a corollary to the previous theorem we see that spectral decompositions cor-

that Etau is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace consisting of those vectors

it follows that S0S “ SS0 for all S P A. Then Theorem 12.22 in Rudin’s book [113]

The theorem of Fuglede-Putnam-Rosenblum can be formulated as follows. Recall
that an operator M is called normal whenever M ˚M “ MM ˚. If an operator M
is normal, then the operator U :“ eM˚e´M “ eM˚´M is unitary in the sense that
U ˚U “ UU ˚ “ I, and so }U}2 “ }U ˚U} “ 1.
5.38. Theorem. Let M and N be bounded normal operators on a Hilbert space H.
Let T : H Ñ H be a bounded linear operator with the intertwining property, i.e.
MT “ TN. Then M ˚T “ TN ˚.
Proof. Consider the operator valued analytic function
f : λ ÞÑ eλM˚Te´λN˚ “ eλM˚e´λMTeλNe´λN˚ “ eλM˚´λMTeλN´λN˚
(5.68)
where in the ﬁrst equality we used the intertwining property of the operator T, and
in the second one the normality of the operators M and N. As observed above the
operators eλM˚´λM and eλN˚´λN, λ P C, are unitary. By (5.68) it follows that the
operator norm of the function f can be estimated as follows:
}fpλq} ď
›››eλM˚´λM››› }T}
›››eλN˚´λN››› “ }T} .
(5.69)
From (5.69) we see that the everywhere deﬁned analytic function λ ÞÑ fpλq is
bounded.
Liouville’s theorem then implies that fpλq “ fp0q “ T, and hence
eλM˚T “ TeλN, λ P C. Consequently, by taking derivatives we obtain M ˚T “ TN ˚.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.38.

2. Closed linear operators
Throughout this section H stands for a complex Hilbert space with inner-product
⟨¨, ¨⟩, and norm }x}2 “ ⟨x, x⟩. Let T : H Ñ H be a closed linear operator withe dense
domain DpTq Ă H and range RpTq Ă H. Its graph GpTq is a closed linear subspace
of the product Hilbert space H ˆ H, i.e. GpTq “ tpx, Txq : x P DpTqu. Its adjoint
T ˚ is a linear operator with domain D pT ˚q and range R pT ˚q in H. Its domain
D pT ˚q consists of those vectors y P H for which the linear functional x ÞÑ ⟨Tx, y⟩,
x P DpTq, is a continuous linear function on H. By the Riesz-Fischer representation
theorem there exists, for a given vector y P D pT ˚q a vector z “ T ˚y P H such that
⟨Tx, y⟩“ ⟨x, z⟩“ ⟨x, T ˚y⟩,
for all x P DpTq.

Operators in Hilbert space
Since DpTq is dense the vector z is unique, and therefore we are entitled to write
z “ T ˚y. Moreover, the mapping y ÞÑ T ˚y, y P D pT ˚q, is linear. Its graph G pT ˚q “
tpy, T ˚yq : y P D pT ˚qu is a closed linear subspace of H ˆ H.
Let the operator
V : H ˆ H Ñ H ˆ H by the (unitary) anti-ﬂip operator: V px, yq “ p´y, xq, px, yq P
H ˆ H. In addition write Q “ I ` T ˚T, so that DpQq “ tx P DpTq : Tx P D pT ˚qu.
A densely deﬁned operator T is called symmetric if T Ă T ˚. The latter means
that for all x, y P DpTq the equality ⟨Tx, y⟩“ ⟨x, Ty⟩holds. It also means that
GpTq Ă G pT ˚q. If T “ T ˚, then T is called self-adjoint. A linear operator T with
domain and range in H is called positive, denoted by T ě 0, if ⟨Tx, x⟩ě 0 for all
x P DpTq. If T is positive, then ⟨x, Tx⟩“ ⟨Tx, x⟩, x P DpTq. By the polarization
formula we see ⟨Tx, y⟩“ ⟨x, Ty⟩, x, y P DpTq. Consequently, such operators are
symmetric. If, in addition, DpTq is dense in H and closed, then T ˚ exists, and
T “ T ˚˚ Ă T ˚. The equality T “ T ˚˚ follows from assertion (2) and (4) in Theorem
5.39 below.
In the following theorem we collect some properties of closed densely deﬁned oper-
ators.
5.39. Theorem. Let T be a closed densely deﬁned linear operator with domain and
range in the Hilbert space H. The following assertions hold true.
(1) The space H admits the orthogonal decomposition: H “ N pT ˚q ‘ R pTq.
(2) The space H ˆH with its natural Hilbert space structure admits the orthogo-
nal decomposition: HˆH “ V GpTq‘G pT ˚q, and hence G pT ˚q “ V GpTqK.
(3) Let the vectors a and b belong to H. Then the system of equations ´Tx`y “
a, x ` T ˚y “ b has a unique solution with x P DpTq and y P D pT ˚q.
(4) The domain of T ˚ is dense, T ˚˚ exists and coincides with T;
(5) The operator Q is a one-to-one mapping from DpQq onto H, it satisﬁes
Q ě I, and there are bounded linear operators B and C that satisfy }B} ď 1,
}C} ď 1, C “ TB, and
B pI ` T ˚Tq Ă pI ` T ˚Tq B “ I.
Moreover, B ě 0, and T ˚T is densely deﬁned and self-adjoint.
(6) If T 1 is the restriction of T to D pT ˚Tq, then the closure of G pT 1q in H ˆH
coincides with GpTq. In other words D pT ˚Tq is a core for T.
5.40. Proposition. If T “ T ˚ and T ě 0, then σpTq Ă r0, 8q.
Proof. Let λ P C be such that ℑλ ‰ 0. Then, from the equalities
}λx ` Tx}2 “ |λ|2 ` 2ℜλ ⟨Tx, x⟩` }Tx}2 “ pℑλq2 }x}2 ` }ℜλx ` Tx}2 ,
it follows that
}λx ` Tx} ě |ℑλ| }x} , λ P C, and }λx ` Tx} ě ℜλ }x} , ℜλ ą 0, x P DpTq.
(5.70)
From (5.70) it follows that the range of the operator λI ` T is closed whenever
ℑλ ‰ 0 or ℜλ ą 0. For the same range of values of λ it also follows from (5.70)

that the null-space of λI ` T is the singleton t0u. By assertion (1) and the fact
the T “ T ˚ we infer that R pλI ´ Tq “ H and N pλI ´ Tq “ t0u for ℑλ ‰ 0.
Consequently, ℑλ ‰ 0 implies λ Ă CzσpTq. It also follows that R pλI ` Tq “ H
and N pλI ` Tq “ t0u for ℜλ ą 0. So that ℜλ ą 0 implies ´λ PĂ CzσpTq. This
leads to the conclusion that σpTq Ă r0, 8q, and completes the proof of Proposition
5.40.
□
An operator T is called essentially self-adjoint if the closure of its graph is again the
graph of an operator T, and if this closure is self-adjoint. Since a densely operator T
is closed if and only if T “ T ˚˚, T is essentially self-adjoint if and only if T ˚˚ “ T ˚.
Proof Theorem 5.39. (1) It is clear that N pT ˚q “ R pTqK. Then it follows
that the subspace N pT ˚q` R pTq is closed in H. We shall prove that it is dense. So
let a P H be such that ⟨x, a⟩“ 0 for all x P N pT ˚q, and also such that ⟨Ty, a⟩“ 0
for all y P DpTq. Then a belongs to D pT ˚q and T ˚a “ 0. So a belongs to N pT ˚q.
But then we choose x “ a to obtain that ⟨a, a⟩“ 0, and so a “ 0. This proves
assertion (1) of Theorem 5.39.
(2) Let px1, y1q and px2, y2q be members of H ˆ H. Then their inner-product, or
scalar product, ⟨px1, y1q , px2, y2q⟩is deﬁned by
⟨px1, y1q , px2, y2q⟩“ ⟨x1, x2⟩` ⟨y1, y2⟩.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

So it is easy to see that V GpTq and G pT ˚q are orthogonal subspaces in H ˆH. It is
also easy to see that G pT ˚q is closed in H ˆ H, and the same is obvious for V GpTq.
It follows that the space V GpTq ` G pT ˚q is closed in H ˆ H. We shall prove that
it is dense. Let the pair pa, bq P H ˆ H be orthogonal to both subspaces V pGpTqq
and G pT ˚q. It follows that
´ ⟨Tx, a⟩` ⟨x, b⟩“ ⟨p´Tx, xq , pa, bq⟩“ 0 for all x P DpTq, and
⟨y, a⟩` ⟨T ˚y, b⟩“ ⟨py, T ˚yq , pa, bq⟩“ 0 for all y P DpTq.
(5.71)
From the ﬁrst equality in (5.71) it follows that a belongs to D pT ˚q and that b “
T ˚a.
Plugging this into the second equality in (5.71) and putting y “ a shows
⟨a, a⟩` ⟨T ˚a, T ˚a⟩“ 0, and hence a “ 0. Since b “ T ˚a we see that b “ 0 as well.
This proves assertion (2) of Theorem 5.39.
(3) This assertion easily follows from the decomposition in assertion (2).
(4) If the vector a P H is orthogonal to D pT ˚q, then the vector pa, 0q is orthogonal
to the graph G pT ˚q, and so pa, 0q belongs to V GpTq. That is a “ ´T0 “ 0. Whence
the ﬁrst part of assertion (4) has been proved. Since D pT ˚q is dense its adjoint T ˚˚
exists. It readily follows that T Ă T ˚˚. By the decomposition in assertion (2) it
follows that T “ T ˚˚. This proves assertion (4) of Theorem 5.39.
(5) Fix h P H and choose operators vectors f P DpTq and g P D pT ˚q such that
p0, hq “ p´Tf, fq ` pg, T ˚gq
(5.72)
in the space H ˆ H. The mappings h ÞÑ f and h ÞÑ g are linear; call them B
respectively C.
Then TBh “ Ch and h “ Bh ` T ˚Ch “ Bh ` T ˚TBh.
In
other words h “ pI ` T ˚Tq Bh. This means that the operator B is a right inverse of
I`T ˚T. Since, for any h P H, Bh belongs to D pT ˚Tq, we also have, for g P D pT ˚Tq,
pI ` T ˚Tq pg ´ B pI ` T ˚Tq gq “ pI ` T ˚Tq g ´ pI ` T ˚Tq B pI ` T ˚Tq g
“ pI ` T ˚Tq g ´ pI ` T ˚Tq g “ 0,
we infer that the vector g ´ B pI ` T ˚Tq g belongs to the null-space of the operator
Q “ I ` T ˚T.
Since ⟨Qf, f⟩ě ⟨f, f⟩, f P DpQq “ D pT ˚Tq, it follows that
g “ B pI ` T ˚Tq g. In other words the operator B is also a left-inverse of I ` T ˚T.
Since the operator B is everywhere deﬁned and symmetric, it is self-adjoint, and
since NpBq “ t0u it has dense range R pI ` T ˚Tq´1 “ D pT ˚Tq. It follows that its
inverse is I ` T ˚T is self-adjoint, and that the same is true for T ˚T. From (5.72)
and the deﬁnitions of the operators B and C it follows that B “ pI ` T ˚Tq´1 and
C “ T pI ` T ˚Tq´1, and
p0, hq “ p´Tf, fq ` pg, T ˚q “ p´TBh, Bhq ` pCh, T ˚Chq ,

Insert x “ a into (5.75) results in a “ 0. Consequently, G pT 1q is dense in GpTq
which is assertion (6).
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.39.

The following theorem has its analogue in the context of C˚-algebras. The main
result is that a closed linear operator in a Hilbert space can be written in the form
T “ U |T|, where U ˚U is an orthogonal projection on the closure of the range of
T ˚T. The theorem is patterned after Theorem 5.19.

as T and T ˚ respectively, and satisfy the following equalities: |T|2 “ T ˚T,
|T ˚|2 “ TT ˚. These operators are the only self-adjoint positive operators
with these properties.

(4) The operators U ˚U and UU ˚ are orthogonal projection on the closures of the
ranges R pT ˚Tq and R pTT ˚q respectively. In fact the following equalities
hold:
U ˚U |T| pxq “ |T| pxq, x P DpTq, and UU ˚ |T ˚| pxq “ |T ˚| pxq, x P D pT ˚q . (5.79)

of the equalities in assertions (3) and (4). The proof of the equality |T|2 pxq “ T ˚Tx,

Similar arguments and conclusions apply to the operator TT ˚ and T ˚.

and hence pTxnqn is a Cauchy sequence in H. It follows that y “ limnÑ8 Txn exists.

Finally, let x P DpTq. Then there exists a sequence pxnqn Ă D pT ˚Tq such that
limnÑ8 xn “ x and limnÑ8 xn “ x.
By the equalities in (5.88) it follows that
p|T| pxnqqn Ă H is a Cauchy sequence, and therefore its limit y :“ limnÑ8 |T| pxnq
exists. Since |T| is a closed operator it follows that x belongs to D p|T|q, and that
y “ |T| pxq. All this implies that D pTq “ D p|T|q and that }|T| pxq} “ }Tx} for
x P DpTq. The same argumentation shows that }|T ˚| pxq} “ }T ˚x} for x P D pT ˚q.

closed subspace, we deduce that L “ H. Therefore the operator U is well deﬁned.
By the expression for U ˚

that U is well-deﬁned, that U ˚ is well-deﬁned as well, and that U ˚ is given by (5.77).

Like in the proof of assertion (3) the second limit in (5.95) vanishes. The ﬁst limit

In addition, we have
››T ˚T pεI ` T ˚Tq´1›› ď 1,
and so U ˚U is the orthogonal projection on the closure of R pT ˚Tq. In particular it
follows that U ˚U |T| “ |T|. The same argument shows that UU ˚ is an orthogonal
projection on the closure of R pTT ˚q. In particular it follows that UU ˚ |T ˚| “ |T ˚|.
This completes the proof of assertion (4).
Altogether this wraps up the proof of Theorem 5.41.
□
5.42. Corollary. Let T be a densely deﬁned normal operator. This means that T
is closed and densely deﬁned, that D pT ˚q “ D pTq, and that T ˚T “ TT ˚. Then
there exists a unitary operator U and a positive operator |T| such that T “ U |T|.
Moreover, U |T| “ |T| U.
Proof. On the range of |T| deﬁne U as in Theorem 5.41. On the null space
N p|T|q deﬁne U as the identity operator. Notice that, since T is normal, |T| “ |T ˚|,
and that N p|T|q “ N pTq “ N pT ˚q. Then from Theorem 5.41 it also follows that
|T| U “ U |T|. This completes the proof of Corollary 5.42.

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
CHAPTER 6
Operator semigroups and Markov processes
We will discuss a number of aspects related to one-parameter operator semigroups.
We will present some general theory, give some examples, include a result on initial
value problems, and make a link with Markov processes, and give some details
on Feynman-Kac semigroups. Unfortunately, not all aspects of this theory can be
discussed. In particular, this is true for applications of (generators of) semigroup
theory, for semigroups related to population dynamics, and for delay equations. In
Chapter 7 we will discuss analytic semigroups and certain aspects of the Crank-
Nicolson iteration scheme.
1. Generalities on semigroups
Let pX, }¨}q be a Banach space and let tSptq : t ě 0u be a family of bounded linear
operators from X to X. This family is called strongly continuous if it possesses the
following properties:
(i) Sp0q “ I, Sps ` tq “ Spsq ˝ Sptq, for all s, t ě 0;
(ii) limtÓ0 }Sptqf ´ f} “ 0 for all f P X.
6.1. Remark. Suppose that the family tSptq : t ě 0u possesses property (i). Then
it possesses property (ii) if and only if
(ii1) limtÓ0 ⟨Sptqf, f ˚⟩“ ⟨f, f ˚⟩for all f P X and for all f ˚ P X˚.
Property (i) is called the semigroup property, property (ii) is the strong continuity
at t “ 0, and (ii˚) is the weak continuity at t “ 0.
6.2. Remark. Often a strongly continuous semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u is written in the
form Sptq “ exp ptAq or Sptq “ exp p´tHq. For symbolic manipulation this notation
is very convenient. For example, for λ ą 0 large enough,
ż 8
0
e´λtSptq dt “
ż 8
0
e´tpλI´Aqdt “ pλI ´ Aq´1 .
Indeed it can be proved that the collection tRpλq : λ ą ωu is a resolvent family,
where each operator Rpλq, λ ą ω, is of the form Rpλq “ pλI ´ Aq´1, for some
closed, densely deﬁned linear operator A with domain and range in X. the number
ω is chosen in such a way that }Sptq} ď M exp pωtq, t ě 0.
Such a number ω
exists. If pX, }¨}q is a Hilbert space, and if each operator Sptq is self-adjoint (i.e.
Sptq “ Sptq˚), then M may be taken the constant 1.

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
6.4. Proposition. Let tSptq : t ě 0u be a weakly continuous semigroup in LpXq.
Then the following assertions are true:
(i) There exist real constants M and ω such that
}Sptq} ď M exp pωtq ,
t ě 0.
Moreover, for λ ą ω and for f P X the integral
ş8
0 e´λtSptqf dt can be
interpreted as an element of X. Upon writing Rpλqf “
ş8
0 e´λtSptqf dt for
λ ą ω the resolvent identity follows:
R pλ1q f ´ R pλ2q f “ pλ2 ´ λ1q R pλ2q R pλ1q f, λ1, λ2 ą ω, f P X.
Integrals of the form
ş8
0 φptqSptqf dt, where the functions φ are Borel mea-
surable and satisfy
ş8
0 |φptq| eωt dt ă 8, are elements of X as well.
(ii) limtÑs, tě0 }Sptqf ´ Spsqf} “ 0, f P X;
(iii) Let M and ω be as in (i) and put
}f}ω “ sup texp p´ωtq }Sptqf} : t ě 0u .
Then
(a) }f} ď }f}ω ď M }f}, for f P X;
(b) }expp´ωsqSpsqf}ω ď }Spsqf}ω for f P X.
6.5. Remark. The topology induced by }¨} coincides with that of }¨}ω, the geometric
properties are lost. The semigroup texp p´ωsq Spsq : s ě 0u consists of contractive
operators in the space pX, }¨}q. The assertion in (ii) says that a weakly continuous
semigroup is in fact strongly continuous.
6.6. Remark. Fix f P X. From the proof of the assertions in (i) it follows that the
following conditions on the Borel measurable φ : r0, 8q Ñ C suﬃce to guarantee
that the integral
ş8
0 φptqSptqf dt belongs to X:
(a) For every f ˚ P X˚ the integral
ş8
0 |φptq ⟨Sptqf, f ˚⟩| dt is ﬁnite;
(b) The collection functions
tt ÞÑ Φφ,f,f˚ptq :“ φptq ⟨Sptqf, f ˚⟩: f ˚ P X˚, }f ˚} ď 1u
is uniformly integrable in the sense that for every ε ą 0 there exists 0 ď
gε P L1 pr0, 8qq such that, for all f ˚ P X˚, }f ˚} ď 1, the following inequality
holds:
ż
|Φφ,f,f˚|ěgε
|Φφ,f,f˚ptq| dt ď ε.
The assumption in (a) implies that the integral
ş8
0 φptqSptqf dt belongs to X˚˚. A
consequence of (b) together with Theorem 8.30 is that the latter integral belongs to
X.
Proof of Proposition 6.4. The ﬁrst part of assertion (i) follows from the
Banach-Steinhaus theorem.
First it is shown that, for some δ ą 0, the supre-
mum sup t}Sptq} : 0 ď δu is ﬁnite.
If this were not the case, then there would

exist a sequence ptn : n P Nu of strictly positive real numbers such that tn Ó 0
and }S ptnq} Ò 8, if n tends to 8.
However, by assumption (ii1) we know that
for every f P X and every f ˚ P X˚, limnÑ8 ⟨S ptnq f, f ˚⟩´ ⟨f, f ˚⟩“ 0. Hence
supnPN |⟨S ptnq f, f ˚⟩| ă 8 for all f P X and for all f ˚ P X˚.
Consider, for
f P X ﬁxed, the sequence of continuous linear functions Λn : X˚ Ñ C, deﬁned
by Λn pf ˚q “ ⟨S ptnq f, f ˚⟩. Then supn |Λn pf ˚q| ă 8. But the Banach-Steinhaus
theorem then says that supnPN }S ptnq f} ă 8. Since f P X is arbitrary, another ap-
plication of the uniform boundedness principle (or the Banach-Steinhaus theorem)
then implies supn }S ptnq} ă 8. This is a contradiction. As a consequence we infer
that, for some δ ą 0, sup0ďtďδ }Sptq} ă 8. Next we have Sptq “ SpδqnSpt ´ nδq,
where nδ ď t ă pn ` 1qδ. Thus
}Sptq} ď sup
0ďsďδ }Spsq}n`1 ď sup
0ďsďδ }Spsq}1`t{δ ď M exp pωtq ,
where M “ sup t}Spsq} : 0 ď s ď δu, and where ω “ 1
δ log M.
Next we want to show that for λ ą ω and f P X the integral
ş8
0 e´λtSptqf dt can be
interpreted as a member of X. We ﬁrst observe that, for f P X ﬁxed the subspace
Xf which, by deﬁnition, is the smallest closed subspace of X which contains all
vectors of the form Sptqf, t ě 0, is separable. From the right-continuity of the
functions t ÞÑ ⟨Sptqf, f ˚⟩, f ˚ P X˚, it follows that the space Xf is separable for the
weak topology. But then it is also separable for the norm-topology. By considering
the functional
Λf : f ˚ ÞÑ

e´λt ⟨Sptqf, f ˚⟩dt,
f ˚ P X˚,
we see by the Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem that limnÑ8 Λf pf ˚
nq “ 0
whenever tf ˚
nu8
n“1 is a sequence in X˚ which converges to 0 for the weak˚-topology.
By the Banach-Steinhaus theorem such a sequence is automatically bounded. Also
recall that, by the Hahn-Banach extension theorem, continuous linear functionals
on Xf have an extension to all of X while preserving their norm. From Theorem
8.30 it follows that there exists a vector g P Xf such that
Λf pf ˚q “

The vector g is written as

Let the Borel measurable φ : r0, 8q Ñ C and f P X be such that

every f ˚ P X˚ there exists t ą 0 such that f ˚ P tBf.
In other words Bf is a
barrel in the Banach space X˚. Consequently, Bf is a neighborhood of the origin,
and so there exists δ ą 0 such that the ball of radius δ, i.e., tf ˚ P X˚ : }f} ď δu is
contained in Bf. Then it follows that

(6.2)
Then, by (6.1) it follows that Λφ,f is a member of X˚˚, and hence the integral
ş8

Since, by hypothesis,
the integral

Assertion (ii) follows from the assertions in (i) together with strong continuity at
t “ 0. The strong continuity at t “ 0 of the semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u can be proved
as follows. Consider the subspace L Ă X deﬁned by
L “

Then, by (i), L is a closed subspace of X. In addition, since, for λ ą ω and f P X,

follows
R pλ1q ´ R pλ2q “ pλ2 ´ λ1q R pλ1q R pλ2q ,
λ1, λ ą ω,
we deduce that the subspaces λRpλqX do not depend on λ ą ω. Let f P X. Then

proves assertion (ii).
Assertion (iii) follows from the ﬁrst. This completes the proof of Proposition 6.4.

6.8. Remark. Theorem 6.7 says that a semigroup is uniquely determined by its
generator. More information on linear operator semigroup theory can be found in,
e.g. [33, 47, 48, 97, 139]; for non-linear semigroup theory the reader is referred
to e.g. [12].
6.9. Remark. An alternative proof of Theorem 6.7 reads as follows. Fix x0 P D pA0q.
Choose λ0 ą ω0, and λ1 ą ω1. (We suppose that }Sjptq} ď Mj exp pωjtq, j “ 0, 1.)
Then pλ0I ´ A0q x0 “ pλ0I ´ A1q x, for some x P D pA1q. Since A0 extends A1, we
get pλ0I ´ A0q x0 “ pλ0I ´ A1q x “ pλ0I ´ A0q x. Hence pλ0I ´ A1q px0 ´ xq “ 0.
So that x0 “ x. Consequently, x0 “ x P D pAq. Whence D pA0q Ď DpAq and thus
G pA0q Ď GpAq. So we see A “ A0.
A detailed account of the following theorem can be found in Engel and Nagel [48].

The property in assertion (ii) of Theorem 6.12 is called the dissipativity property.
For applications the following somewhat stronger version of Theorem 6.12 is often
useful.
Proof. (i) ùñ (ii) This implication is not so diﬃcult.

range of pλI ´ Aq coincides with X for all λ ą 0, and that Rpλqf belongs to DpAq
for all λ ą 0. Moreover, by the strong continuity of the semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u we

(6.8)
From the dissipativity property in (ii) it follows that λ0 }R pλ0q} ď 1. Therefore,
the series in (6.8) converges for |λ ´ λ0| ă λ0, or what amounts to the same for
0 ă λ ă 2λ0. The equalities
pλI ´ Aq Rpλqf “ f,
f P X, and Rpλ pλI ´ Aq f “ f,
f P DpAq,
(6.9)
easily follow for 0 ă λ ă 2λ0. In other words, Rpλq “ pλI ´ Lq´1, 0 ă λ ă 2λ0. This
procedure can be repeated for any 0 ă λ ă 2λ0 instead of λ0. The result will be that
the inverse operator Rpλq :“ pλI ´ Aq´1 exists for every 0 ă λ ă 4λ0 and that for
such λ the inequality λ }Rpλq} ď 1 holds. Again repeating these arguments yields
the existence of Rpλq :“ pλI ´ Aq´1 for 0 ă λ ă 8λ0. Again we have λ }Rpλq} ď 1,
0 ă λ ă 8λ0. By repeating these arguments often enough we obtain a resolvent
family Rpλq “ pλI ´ Aq´1, λ ą 0, such that λ }Rpλq} ď 1 for λ ą 0. We still need
to construct a semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u with generator A. To this end we introduce
the operators A pλq, λ ą 0, by
A pλq “ λ2R pλq ´ λI “ λARpλq.

We consider the subspace L1 deﬁned by

Since λ }Rpλq} ď 1 the space L1 is closed in X. Let λ0 ą 0 be as in (ii), and pick

pλRpλq ´ Iq R pλ0q g “

(6.13)
From (6.13) we get

(6.14)
Since DpAq “ R pλ0q X, from (6.14) it follows that the space L1 contains the sub-
space DpAq. Since the subspace L1 is closed, it contains the closure of DpAq. By
assumption DpAq is dense, and thus L1 “ X.

Since
››etApλq›› ď 1, t ě 0, λ ą 0, it follows that the space L2 is closed. Since the space
L1 coincides with X, the inequality in (6.12) implies that L2 contains the subspace
DpAq. The subspace DpAq being dense implies that the subspace L2 coincides with
X. Put Sptqf “ limλÑ8 etApλqf, f P X. Since the subspace L2 coincides with X, it

A is an extension of A0. Let f belong to DpAq and ﬁx λ ą 0. Then the operator

equalities hold:
pλI ´ Aq f “ pλI ´ A0q f0 “ pλI ´ Aq f0.
(6.18)
From (6.18) we see that the vector f ´ f0 belongs to the zero space of λI ´ A. Since
the operator A is dissipative we infer f “ f0, and hence a vector in DpAq belongs
to D pA0q. However, all this implies that the operators A and A0 are the same. So
that A is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup.
The proof of Theorem 6.12 is complete now.

6.13. Theorem (Lumer-Phillips). Let A be linear a operator with domain DpAq and
range RpAq in a Banach space X. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) The operator A is closable and its closure generates a strongly continuous
semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u for which }Sptq} ď 1, t ě 0;
(ii) The domain DpAq of A is dense, }λf ´ Af} ě λ }f}, for all λ ą 0, and for
all f P DpAq, and there exists λ0 ą 0 for which R pλ0I ´ Aq is dense in X.
6.14. Remark. Usually the range property is the diﬃcult part to verify. Assertion
(i) in Theorem 6.13 says that the subspace DpAq is a core for A, the closure of the
operator A. If the operator A satisﬁes the equivalent conditions in Theorem 6.13,
then its closure A satisﬁes the equivalent conditions in Theorem 6.12.

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
Proof of Theorem 6.13. (i) ùñ (ii) From assertion (a) in Proposition 6.17
it follows that the operator A is closable. Let A be the closure of A. Then by (i) A
generates a strongly continuous semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u consisting of contraction
operators, and so DpAq is dense. Since }Sptq} ď 1, t ě 0, it follows that λ }Rpλq} ď

But then it easily follows that A is dissipative: see Deﬁnition 6.15 below. Since

dense in X.
(ii) ùñ (i) From assertion (a) in Proposition 6.17 below we see that, under the
assumptions in (ii) the operator A is closable. Let A be its closure. Then, as is readily
veriﬁed, the operator A possesses the properties described in (ii) of Theorem 6.12.
An application of Theorem 6.12 then shows that A generates a strongly continuous
semigroup consisting of contraction operators.
The proof of Theorem 6.13 is now complete.
□
6.15. Definition. Some deﬁnitions follow.
(a) As mentioned earlier an operator A with domain DpAq and range RpAq in
the Banach space pX, }¨}q is called dissipative if
}λf ´ Af} ě λ }f} ,
λ ą 0,
f P DpAq.
(b) Let E be second countable locally compact Hausdorﬀspace. If in (a) the
symbol X denotes the space C0pEq, supplied with the supremum norm,
then A is said to satisfy the maximum principle if, for every f P DpAq,
for which sup
xPE ℜfpxq ą 0, there exists x0 P E for which sup
xPE ℜfpxq “ ℜfpx0q
and for which ℜAfpx0q ď 0.
(c) If in (b) the space E is compact, then the maximum principle is phrased as
follows. For every f P DpAq, there exists x0 P E with sup
xPE ℜfpxq “ ℜfpx0q
for which ℜAfpx0q ď 0.
6.16. Remark. An operator A that satisﬁes the maximum principle can be consid-
ered as kind of a generalized second order diﬀerential operator. Often this kind of
operator is a pseudo-diﬀerential operator of order between 0 and 2.
Next we specialize to X “ C0pEq, equipped with the supremum norm: }f}8 “
supxPE |fpxq|, f P C0pEq. The space E is supposed to be a second countable (i.e.
it is a topological space with a countable base for its topology) locally compact
Hausdorﬀspace (in particular it is a Polish space).
A second-countable locally-
compact Hausdorﬀspace is Polish. Let pUiqi be a countable basis of open subsets
with compact closures, choose for each i P N, yi P Ui, together with a continuous

Since a locally compact Hausdorﬀspace is completely regular this choice is possible.

x, y P E.
This metric gives the same topology, and it is not too diﬃcult to verify its complete-
ness. For this notice that the sequence pfiqi separates the points of E, and therefore
the algebraic span (i.e. the linear span of the ﬁnite products of the functions fi) is
dense in C0pEq for the topology of uniform convergence. A proof of the fact that
a locally compact space is completely regular can be found in Willard [154] Theo-
rem 19.3. The connection with Urysohn’s metrization theorem is also explained. A
related construction can be found in Garrett [53]: see Dixmier [39] Appendix V as
well.
6.17. Proposition. The following assertions are true.
(a) Suppose that the operator A is dissipative and that its range is contained in
the closure of its domain. Then the operator A is closable.
(b) If the operator A satisﬁes the maximum principle, then A is dissipative.
Proof. (a) Let pfnq Ă DpAq be any sequence with the following properties:
lim
nÑ8 fn “ 0,
and
g “ lim
nÑ8 Afn
exists in C0pEq. Then we consider
››pλfn ` gmq ´ λ´1A pλfn ` gmq

where pgmq Ă DpAq converges to g. First we let n tend to inﬁnity, then λ, and
ﬁnally m. The result will be limmÑ8 }gm ´ g}8 ě limmÑ8 }gm}8 “ }g}8. Hence
g “ 0.
(b) Let f ‰ 0 belong to DpAq, choose α P R and x0 P E in such a way that 0 ă
}f}8 “ ℜexppiαqfpx0q “ supxPE ℜexppiαqfpxq, and that ℜA pexppiαqfq px0q ď 0.
Then
}λf ´ Af}8 ě ℜpexppiαq pλf ´ Afq px0qq
“ λℜpexppiαqfpx0qq ´ ℜpexppiαqAfq px0q ě λ }f}8 .
This completes the proof of Proposition 6.17.
□
6.18. Definition. A strongly continuous semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u in C0pEq is called
a Feller semigroup or Feller-Dynkin semigroup if it possesses the following positivity
property: for all f P C0pEq, for which 0 ď f ď 1, and for all t ě 0, the inequality
0 ď Sptqf ď 1 is true. Often a Feller semigroup is called a Feller-Dynkin semigroup,
because it leaves the space C0pEq invariant.
6.19. Remark. From the complex linearity and the assumption that 0 ď f ď 1,
f P C0pEq, implies 0 ď Sptqf ď 1, it follows that }Sptqf}8 ď }f}8, f P C0pEq.

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
6.20. Remark. It often happens that a semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u is deﬁned on a
larger space than C0pEq, e.g. on the space of bounded Borel measurable functions.
We say that tSptq : t ě 0u is a Feller semigroup, or Feller-Dynkin semigroup if it
leaves the space C0pEq invariant (i.e. if Sptqf belongs to C0pEq whenever f does so
and whenever t ě 0), and if 0 ď f ď 1, f P C0pEq, implies 0 ď Sptqf ď 1, t ě 0.
6.21. Remark. There exists a close relationship between Feller semigroups, strong
Markov processes, and well-posed martingale problems: see Theorem 6.36 in Section
3.
6.22. Remark. Let tSptq : t ě 0u be a semigroup of linear operators on C0pEq with
the following property: 0 ď f ď 1, f P C0pEq, implies Sptqf P C0pEq and 0 ď
Sptqf ď 1, for all t ě 0. Then the semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u is strongly continuous
if and only if, for all f in a subset of C0pEq with a dense linear span, and for all
x P E, the equality
lim
tÓ0 Sptqfpxq “ fpxq
(6.19)
holds. It suﬃces to prove, starting from (6.19), that limtÓ0 }Sptqf ´ f}8 “ 0 for
f P C0pEq, 0 ď f ď 1. From (6.19) together with Lebesgue’s dominated convergence
theorem it follows that
lim

ż
fpxq dµpxq,
(6.20)
for all Borel measures µ on E of bounded variation and for all functions f P C0pEq,
0 ď f ď 1.
Since, by the Riesz representation theorem, every member of the
dual space of C0pEq can be represented by a complex Borel measure of bounded
variation, from (6.20) we may deduce that w- limtÓ0 Sptqf “ f. So from (6.19) it
follows that Sptqf converges in the weak sense to f, if t decreases to 0. But a weakly
continuous semigroup is strongly continuous. Hence (6.19) implies strong continuity.
The converse statement is trivial.
6.23. Proposition. Suppose that the operator A with domain and range in C0pEq
is such that its range is contained in the closure of its domain. Then the following
assertions are true:
(1) The operator A satisﬁes the maximum principle.
(2) If f P DpAq, and λ ą 0, then the following inequalities hold:
inf

constant function 1 belongs to the domain of A and that A1 “ 0.
Proof of Proposition 6.23. Assume that E is locally compact but not com-
pact. When E is compact the proof follows the same lines, and is left to the reader.
(1) ùñ (2) Let f P DpAq be such that infxPE ℜfpxq ă 0. Then, by assertion (1)
there exists x0 P E such that ℜf px0q “ infxPE ℜfpxq ă 0, and ℜAf px0q ě 0. It

The inequality obtained in (6.23) proves the ﬁrst inequality in (6.21) in case f P
DpAq is such that infxPE ℜfpxq ă 0. If infxPE ℜfpxq ě 0, then the ﬁrst inequality
in (6.21) is automatically satisﬁed because the function λf ´ Af belongs to C0pEq,
and hence it vanishes at “8”. The second inequality in (6.21) is trivial, and the
third one follows by applying the previous arguments to the function ´f instead of
f.

operator A is dissipative. By assertion (a) in Proposition 6.17 it is closable. Let f

that

(6.24)
Since each function fn satisﬁes inequalities as in (6.21), the inequalities in (6.22)
follow by applying (6.24). Consequently, assertion (4) is proved now.
(4) ùñ (3) Let f P D
`
A
˘
be such that supxPE ℜfpxq ą 0. Then we have to show
that there exists x0 P E such that supxPE ℜfpxq “ ℜf px0q and ℜAf px0q ď 0. From
the third inequality in (6.22) it follows that there exist points xλ P E such that
λℜf pxλq ´ ℜAf pxλq ě λ sup
xPE ℜfpxq.
(6.25)
Since E is locally compact there exists a point x8 in E Y 8 which is an adherence
point of all families txλ : λ ě nu, n P N.
Upon dividing the left-hand side and
right-hand side of (6.25) by λ ą 0, and letting λ tend to 8, it follows that
ℜf px8q “ sup
xPE ℜfpxq ą 0,
(6.26)
and, consequently, x8 belongs to E. From (6.25) it also follows that
´ℜAf pxλq ě λ

sup

(6.27)
From (6.26) and by letting λ tend to 8 in (6.27) it follows that the point x8 P E
is such that not only (6.26) is satisﬁed, but that we also have ℜAf px8q ď 0. This
proves the implication (4) ùñ (3).
The implication (3) ùñ (1) being trivial this completes the proof of Proposition
6.23.
□
6.25. Theorem (Lumer-Phillips for Feller semigroups). The following assertions
are equivalent:
(i) The operator A is closable and its closure generates a Feller semigroup;
(ii) The operator A has dense domain, it veriﬁes the maximum principle, and
there exists λ ą 0 such that the range of λI ´ A is dense in C0pEq.
If A is closable and if A veriﬁes the maximum principle, then so does its closure:
see Proposition 6.23.
Proof of Theorem 6.25. We prove the theorem if E is locally compact, and
not compact. The compact case is left as an exercise for the reader.
(i) ùñ (ii) Let tSptq : t ě 0u be the Feller semigroup generated by A the closure of
A. Then the domain of A is dense, and so is the domain of A. Let f P DpAq be such

that supxPE ℜfpxq ą 0, and choose x0 in such a way that ℜf px0q “ supxPE ℜfpxq.
Then
ℜpSptqf px0q ´ f px0qq “ Sptqℜf px0q ´ ℜf px0q
ď sup
xPE ℜfpxq ´ ℜf px0q ď 0.
(6.28)
In (6.28) we divide by t ą 0 and let t tend to 0 to obtain ℜAf px0q ď 0. In other
words the operator A satisﬁes the maximum principle. In addition, R
`
λI ´ A
˘
“ X,
λ ą 0, and consequently, the operators λI ´ A have dense range. So that assertion
(ii) follows from (i).
(ii) ùñ (i) The operator A satisﬁes the maximum principle. But then, by assertion
(b) in Proposition 6.17, it follows that the operator A is dissipative. By assertion (a)
in Proposition 6.17 it follows that the operator A is closable. By Theorem 6.13 we
deduce that the operator A generates a strongly continuous semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u
consisting of operators Sptq which are contractions: }Sptqf}8 ď }f}8, f P C0pEq.
We still need to show that this semigroup has the Feller property, i.e., that 0 ď f ď 1
implies 0 ď Sptqf ď 1. Since the operator A satisﬁes the maximum principle, its
closure does so as well: see Proposition 6.23. Fix λ ą 0, and let f P D
`
A
˘
be such
that
`
λI ´ A
˘
f ě 0. Then, by assertion (4) in Proposition 6.17 it follows that
0 ď inf
xPE ℜ
`
λI ´ A
˘
pifq pxq ď λ inf
xPE ℜpifq pxq.
So that ´ℑfpxq ě 0 for all x P E. So we have ℑfpxq ď 0 for all x P E. The same
argument applied to ´if instead of if yields ℑfpxq ě 0 for all x P E. Consequently,
ℑfpxq “ 0 for all x P E. In other words the function f is real valued. Another
appeal to assertion (4) in Proposition 6.17 then yields
0 ď inf
xPE pλI ´ Aq fpxq ď λ inf
xPE fpxq,
and so fpxq ě 0 for all x P E. As a result we have that
`
λI ´ A
˘
f ě 0 implies
f ě 0. Put Rpλq “
`
λI ´ A
˘´1. In other words g ě 0 implies Rpλqg ě 0. Hence
the resolvent operators Rpλq, λ ą 0, are positivity preserving. Since

it follows that the operators Sptq are positivity preserving.
Hence, 0 ď f ď 1,
f P C0pEq, implies Sptqf ě 0, and since Sptq is a contraction, it also follows that
Sptqf ď 1.
This completes the proof of Theorem 6.25.

(iv) ñ (i). Put
Φpt, x, x˚q “ d
dt ⟨wxptq, x˚⟩´ d
dt ⟨w0ptq, x˚⟩.
(6.32)
Then prove that there exists a family tSptq : t ě 0u of continuous linear operators
such that
⟨Sptqx, x˚⟩“ Φpt, x, x˚q “ d
dt ⟨wxptq, x˚⟩´ d
dt ⟨w0ptq, x˚⟩.
(6.33)
Finally prove that the family tSptq : t ě 0u is a strongly continuous semigroup with
generator A. All this can be achieved as follows. From our assumptions and deﬁni-
tions, it follows that
⟨Sptqx, x˚⟩´ ⟨x, x˚⟩“
⟨ż t

Spsqxds, A˚x˚

.
(6.34)
From (6.34) we see that the element
şt

A

The semigroup property is a consequence of the identity

xpt1 ` t2q ´ w1
0pt1 ` t2q “ w1
w1xpt1q´w1
0pt1qpt2q ´ w1
0pt2q.
(6.35)
Equality (6.35) can be seen by considering two solutions to the equation in (iv):
w1,xptq “ wxps ` tq ´ wxpsq ´ w0ps ` tq ` w0psq;
w2,xptq “ ww1xpsq´w1
0psqptq ´ w0ptq.
Put wptq “ w2,xptq ´ w1,xptq. Then w1ptq “ Awptq, and wp0q “ 0. Next consider the
following two equations:
w1
xptq “ x ` Awxptq `

fpsq ds,
wp0q “ 0;
pw ` wxq1 ptq “ x ` A pw ` wxq ptq `
ż t

fpsq ds,
pw ` wxq p0q “ 0.
From the uniqueness in (iv) we get w ` wx “ wx and hence w “ 0. From the latter
we infer v2,xptq “ v1,xptq.
As a consequence we obtain the semigroup property:
Sps ` tq “ SpsqSptq. Since Sptqx ´ x “ w1
xptq ´ w1
0ptq ´ x converges weakly to
w1
xp0q ´ w1
0p0q ´ x “ A pwxp0q ´ w0p0qq “ A0 “ 0. It follows that the semigroup

As a consequence A is an extension of rA. Let x be a member of DpAq. Pick λ0

Since the function wx0ptq possesses the same property as the function w0ptq ` w1ptq,
we infer from (vi) the equality w0ptq ` w1ptq “ wx0ptq and hence
eλ0t ´ 1
λ0
x0 “ wx0ptq ´ w0ptq

From (6.36) we obtain, via diﬀerentiating with respect to t, Sptqx0 “ exp pλ0tq x0,

now.

2. Examples
In this section we present several (interesting) examples of operator semigroups.
2.1. Uniformly continuous semigroups. Let A be a bounded linear oper-
ator, and put Sptq “

k! . The family tSptq : t ě 0u is a strongly continuous
semigroup. In fact limtÓ0 }Sptq ´ I} “ 0. From the closed graph theorem it fol-
lows that a strongly continuous semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u is uniformly continuous
(i.e. limtÓ0 }Sptq ´ I} “ 0) if and only if Sptq “ exp ptAq, t ě 0, for some bounded
linear operator A. The suﬃciency is easy to establish. The necessity follows from
the closed graph theorem. If limtÓ0 }Sptq ´ I} “ 0, then limλÑ8 }I ´ λRpλq} “ 0.
Hence, for λ ą 0 suﬃciently large we get }I ´ λRpλq} ă 1. But then the operator

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
λRpλq possesses an everywhere deﬁned inverse. As a consequence the generator A
of tSptq : t ě 0u, which has a closed graph, is everywhere deﬁned. Therefore it is
bounded and hence Sptq “ exp ptAq.
2.2. Self-adjoint semigroups. Let H “ H˚ “
ş8
´ω ξEpdξq be a self-adjoint
linear operator in a Hilbert space H, with lower bound ´ω. Such an operator H gen-
erates the semigroup texp p´tHq : t ě 0u, where exp p´tHq “
ş8
´ω exp p´tξq Epdξq.
If the operator H possesses a discrete spectrum tλj : j P Nu, then exp p´tHq “
ř8
k“1 exp p´tλjq E tλju. The operators E tλju are the orthogonal projections on the
eigenspaces N pλjI ´ Hq. The semigroup t ÞÑ exp p´tHq, t ě 0, can be extended to
z Ñ exp p´zHq, ℜz ě 0. Hence the semigroup texp p´tHq : t ě 0u extends to an
analytic semigroup on tz P C : ℜz ą 0u. Of course the mappings s ÞÑ exp p´isHq,
s P R, are unitary groups on H.
2.3. Translation group. Let A be the operator A “ d
dx in C0pRq or in LppRq,
1 ď p ă 8. The corresponding semigroup is given by exp ptAq fpxq “ fpx ` tq,
x P R, t ě 0.
This semigroup extends to a group in any of the above spaces.
It is not strongly continuous in the space L8pRq.
In fact, a result due to Lotz
(see [1]) says that a semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u is strongly continuous in L8pRq if
and only if its generator is an everywhere deﬁned bounded linear operator (such
semigroups are necessarily uniformly continuous: see Example 2.1). The space R
may be replaced with any locally compact second countable Hausdorﬀspace. Upon
replacing the above mentioned spaces with other spaces on which there exists a
(semi)group action, the translation (semi)groups serve as a source of examples and
counter-examples (compare with the one-sided and two-sided shift in the discrete
setting).
2.4. Gaussian semigroup. Let H0 “ ´ 1
2∆in C0 pRνq, or in Lp pRνq, 1 ď p ă
8. Put
p0,νpt, x, yq “

(This function is the so-called heat or Gaussian kernel.) Then ´H0 generates the
semigroup texp p´tH0q : t ě 0u given by
exp p´tH0q fpxq “
ż
p0,νpt, x, yqfpyq dy.
The semigroup property is clear from the equality

Hence texp ptAq : t ě 0u extends to a unitary group on the Hilbert space H.
2.6. Adjoint semigroups. If A is the generator of the strongly continuous
semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u in the reﬂexive Banach space X, then its adjoint A˚ gener-
ates the strongly continuous semigroup tSptq˚ : t ě 0u in the Banach space X˚. If
X is not reﬂexive, then then tSptq˚ : t ě 0u need not be strongly continuous, even if
tSptq : t ě 0u is. Many semigroups, that are strongly continuous in L1 pRνq, possess
adjoints in L8 pRνq, which are not strongly continuous. (By Lotz’ result, generators
of strongly continuous semigroups in L8pRνq have to be bounded: see [5].)
2.7. Dyson-Phillips expansion. If the operator A generates the semigroup
tSptq : t ě 0u ,

Then there exists a continuous negative deﬁnite function ψ on Rν (Rν and its dual
group are identiﬁed) such that

on C0 pRrνq. Every operator Sptq, t ě 0, commutes with translations on Rν: τx ˝

are respectively ψpξq “

semigroup).
2.10. Semigroups acting on operators. This is a non-commutative version
of the example in Subsection 2.9. Again let tµt : t ě 0u be a vaguely continuous
convolution semigroup of Borel probability measures on R. Let H0 and H1 be self-
adjoint Hamiltonians in the Hilbert spaces H0 respectively H1.
Deﬁne for T P
L pH1, H0q, the operator exp p´tAq T via the equality:
exp p´tAq T “
ż
exp p´iτH0q T exp piτH1q dµtpτq.
On appropriate spaces of linear operators (Hilbert-Schmidt operators, trace class op-
erators, compact operators) the family texp p´tAq : t ě 0u is a strongly semigroup.
If the spaces H0 and H1 are inﬁnite dimensional, it is not strongly continuous on the
space of bounded linear operators L pH1, H0q. This example is related to quantum
stochastic processes. In general the operators exp p´tAq is not completely positive.
Only semigroups consisting of completely positive operators correspond to quantum
stochastic processes.

2.11. Quantum dynamical semigroups. A C˚-algebra M is called a W ˚-
algebra (or von Neumann algebra) if it is a dual space as a Banach space, i.e. if
there exists a Banach space M˚ such that pM˚q˚ “ M. A Banach space M˚ whose
dual is M is called a predual.
Let H be a Hilbert space. Then L pHq, the space
of al bounded linear operators on H is a W ˚-algebra. Its predual L pHq˚ consists
of those linear functionals f : L pHq Ñ C for which there exist two sequences pxnqn

i.e., suppose that Φ pλxq “ λΦpxq, Φ px ` yq “ Φpxq ` Φpyq, Φ pxyq “ ΦpxqΦpyq, for
λ P C, x, y P A1. The homomorphism Φ is called a ˚-homomorphism, if, in addition,
it satisﬁes Φ px˚q “ Φpxq˚, x P A1.
6.27. Definition. Let M1 and M2 be W ˚-algebras with preduals M1˚ and M2˚
respectively, and let Φ : M1 Ñ M2 be ˚-homomorphism. Then Φ is called a W ˚-
homomorphism provided that it is continuous if M1 is endowed with the topology
σ pM1, M1˚q, and if M2 is endowed with the topology σ pM2, M2˚q.
6.28. Proposition. Let M1 and M2 be W ˚-algebras with preduals M1˚ and M2˚
respectively, and let Φ : M1 Ñ M2 be W ˚-homomorphism. Then the image Φ pM1q

6.29. Definition. Let A be a C˚-algebra. A C˚-representation of A is a ˚-homo-
morphism π of A in L pHq for some Hilbert space H. This C˚-representation is
denoted by pπ, Hq.
An important representation theorem for C˚-algebras reads as follows.

adjoint subalgebra of L pHq for some Hilbert space H. Denote this C˚-representation
by pπ, Hq. Then }πpaq} “ }a}, a P A.
6.31. Definition. Let M be a W ˚-algebra. A W ˚-representation of M is a W ˚-
homomorphism π of A in L pHq for some Hilbert space H. This W ˚-representation
is denoted by pπ, Hq.
A representation theorem for W ˚-algebras reads as follows.
6.32. Theorem. Let M be a W ˚-algebra. Then M has a faithful W ˚-representation
tπ, Hu; i.e. the representation π is such that πpaq “ 0 if and only if a “ 0. Therefore
M is W ˚-isomorphic to a weakly closed self-adjoint subalgebra of L pHq for some
Hilbert space H. The image π pMq is then a W ˚-algebra embedded in L pHq, and
π pMq is W ˚-isomorphic to M.

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
The σ-weak continuity is deﬁned via the predual of the W ˚-algebra M. Realize
the von Neumann algebra M via the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction as a C˚-
algebra of operators acting on a Hilbert space H. Let A be its pre-dual under the
duality map:
pa, xq ÞÑ trace px˚aq ,
a P A,

The trace of a trace class operator T : H Ñ H is deﬁned by

j“1
⟨Tξj, ξj⟩,
(6.38)
where the sequence pξj : j P Nq is any complete orthonormal sequence of vectors in
H. For trace class operators the sum in (6.38) does not depend on the particular
choice of the complete orthonormal sequence pξj : j Pq in H. The operator T is
called a trace class operator if its trace norm }T}trace, deﬁned by
}T}trace “ trace p|T|q
is ﬁnite. Here |T| “

T ˚T is the square root of the operator T ˚T: see Theorem
5.41. More details on quantum diﬀusions can be found in: [16, 67, 92, 96]. Another
book of interest is Alicki and Lendi [4].
6.33. Remark. Property (ii) is not shared by Cauchy semigroups. Indeed it should
be thought of Cauchy semigroups as an image under a Cauchy (or Poisson) trans-
form. The interesting fact is that this transform associates a generator with the
resulting semigroup. As far as we know, the ideas of Poisson and Weierstrass trans-
forms have been studied for the ﬁrst time by Hille in 1935, but they still enjoy
interesting unexplored properties!
6.34. Remark. There are situations, where instead of the logistical law Cauchy
processes might be more appropriate:

so-called double Stieltjes operator integrals and so do the authors of [55] on page

2.12. Semigroups for system theory. Let A0 be the generator of the semi-
group tS0ptq : t ě 0u in the Banach space X0 and let A1 be the generator of the
semigroup tS1ptq : t ě 0u in the Banach space X1. For an operator B P L pX1, X0q

of continuous linear operators on the space H0 ˆ H1. Its generator is given by the

Remark 6.86 as well. For more details see e.g. [30, 31, 32].
2.13. Semigroups and pseudo-diﬀerential operators. A great number of
(elliptic) pseudo-diﬀerential operators generate strongly continuous semigroups.
Some lower order (ď 2) pseudo-diﬀerential operators generate Feller semigroups. In
fact, let ψ be a non-negative deﬁnite function, like ψpξq “ |ξ|α, ξ P Rν, 0 ă α ď 2
ﬁxed. Then the corresponding pseudo-diﬀerential operator may be deﬁned by

Then, some closure of A generates a L´evy process. If the symbol ψ also depends on
the position x, then the situations becomes much more complicated: see Jacob [29].

2.14. Quadratic forms and semigroups. There exist a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the family of lower bounded, closed quadratic forms and strongly
continuous semigroups that consist of form positive operators. Certain quadratic
forms (closed Dirichlet forms) yield strongly continuous semigroups, consisting of
contraction operators, which are form positive and preserve the positivity in a space
like L2pE, mq, where m is a Radon measure on the topological space E. With such
quadratic one may associate strong Markov processes. In our approach we will start
with (generators of) Feller semigroups instead of Dirichlet forms. See Subsection
5.2 for some information on symmetric quadratic forms.
2.15. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. Let W be a separable Banach space,
supplied with its Borel ﬁeld BpWq. A probability measure µ on pW, BpWqq is called
a Gaussian measure if it possesses the following property:
For every n P N, and for every ﬁnite choice ℓ1, . . . , ℓn P W ˚ (the topological

In other words the vector pℓ1, . . . , ℓnq P pW ˚qn is a Gaussian vector on the probability
space pW, BpWqq. We also suppose that the support of µ coincides with W. Suppose
m “ 0 (for all choices ℓ1, . . . , ℓn in W ˚). Then there exists a unique Hilbert space
pH, ⟨¨, ¨⟩Hq, with H Ă W, such that
(i) The embedding j : H ãÑ W is continuous and j pHq is dense in W;

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
Let pW, H, µq be a Wiener space and let pS, BpSqq be a measurable space. A mea-
surable mapping F : W Ñ S is called an S-valued Wiener functional. The Wiener
functional F is called p-integrable, 1 ď p ă 8, if S is a Banach space and if the
mapping w ÞÑ }Fpwq}S belongs to LppW, µq. A Winer functional F : W Ñ R is
called a polynomial if the following holds true:
for every n P N, there exists a polynomial p “ ppx1, . . . , xnq in n variables
and there exist ℓ1, . . . , ℓn P W ˚,
such that
Fpwq “ p pℓ1pwq, . . . , ℓnpwqq , for all w P W.
The degree of p is that of F.
We may always suppose that the functionals ℓj,
1 ď j ď n, are orthogonal in H: ⟨ℓj, ℓk⟩H “ δj,k. The collection of polynomials of
degree ď n is a closed subspace of L2pW, µq. The collection of all polynomials is
dense in L2pW, µq. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup plays a fundamental role in
Malliavin calculus (or stochastic calculus of variations): [11, 21, 22, 84, 82, 83,
89, 90, 135, 152, 157]. For a relatively simple introduction see e.g. Friz [52].
2.16. Evolutions and semigroups. Let tV pr, sq : r ď su be an evolutionary
system on a Banach space X. Basically this means that V pr, rq “ I, V pr, sqV ps, tq “
V pr, tq, r ď s ď t (algebraic properties). We also assume the following continuity
properties:
s- lim
tÓs V pt, sq “ V ps, sq “ I “ lim
rÒs V ps, rq.
This system, which is not necessarily time homogeneous, can be made homogeneous
in time on spaces like C0 pR, Xq. Deﬁne the semigroup tSptq : t ě 0u as follows:
rSptqfs prq “ V pr, r ` tqfpr ` tq,
f P C0pR, Xq.
3. Markov processes
We begin with a theorem. Some more explanation will follow later.
6.36. Theorem. The following assertion hold true:
(a) (Blumenthal and Getoor [37]) Let tSptq : t ě 0u be a Feller semigroup in
C0pEq. Then there exists a strong Markov process (in fact a Hunt process)
tpΩ, F, Pxq , pXptq, t ě 0q , pϑt, t ě 0q , pE, Equ , such that
rSptqfs pxq “ Ex rfpXptqqs ,
f P C0pEq,
t ě 0.
Moreover this Markov process is normal ( i.e. Px rXp0q “ xs “ 1), is right
continuous ( i.e. limtÓs Xptq “ Xpsq, Px-almost surely), possesses left limits
in E on its life time ( i.e. limtÒs Xptq exists in E, whenever ζ ą s), and is
quasi left continuous ( i.e. if pTn : n P Nq is an increasing sequence of pFtq-
stopping times, XpTnq converges Px-almost surely to XpTq on the event
tT ă 8u, where T “ supnPN Tn).

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
(d) Conversely, let A be a densely deﬁned linear operator with domain DpAq
and range RpAq in C0pEq. Let pPx : x P Eq be a unique family of probability
measures, on an appropriate measurable space (path space) pΩ, Fq with an
appropriate ﬁltration pFtqtě0, such that, for all x P E, Px rXp0q “ xs “ 1,
and such that for all f P DpAq the process
t ÞÑ fpXptqq ´ fpXp0qq ´
ż t
0
AfpXpsqq ds
is a Px-martingale with respect to the ﬁltration pFtqtě0. Then the opera-
tor A possesses a unique extension A0, which generates a Feller semigroup
in C0pEq, provided that Px rXptq P E, Xpsq P Es “ Px rXptq P Es for all
x P E, and all 0 ď s ă t. Next, suppose that the path space Ωis the Sko-
rohod space D
`
r0, 8q, E△˘
which consists of right-continuous paths, with
left limits ω with values in E△with the property that Xptqpωq P E, and
0 ď s ă t implies Xpsqpωq P E. In addition, suppose that the state variables
and translation operators are given by: Xptqpωq “ ωptq, ω P D
`
r0, 8q, E△˘
,
and ϑtpωqpsq “ ωps ` tq. The process
tpΩ, F, Pxq , pXptq, t ě 0q , pϑt, t ě 0q , pE, EquxPE
is then a strong Markov process.
(e) Suppose that the densely deﬁned linear operator A (with domain and range
in C0pEq) possesses the Korovkin property, and suppose that A extends to a
generator of a Feller semigroup. Then the martingale problem is well posed
for the operator A, and A possesses a unique extension A0, which generates
a Feller semigroup. Moreover the Markov process associated with A0 solves
the martingale problem uniquely for A.
6.37. Definition.
(a) The martingale problem is said to be well posed for the
operator A (or the martingale problem is said to uniquely solvable for the
operator A), if for every x P E there exists a unique probability measure
Px on the Skorohod space Ω“ D
`
r0, 8s, E△˘
(cadlag sample paths), such
that for every f P DpAq the process

is Px-martingale for the ﬁltration pFtqtě0 :“

, and such
that Px rXp0q “ xs “ 1.
(b) The operator A (with domain and range in C0pEq) is said to possess the
Korovkin property, if there exists λ0 ą 0 such that fore every x0 P E, the

coincides with C0pEq, then such a subspace D could be called a Korovkin
subspace of C0pEq.
6.38. Remark. For Ωwe may take the Skorohod space Ω“ D
`
r0, 8s, E△˘
. So a
sample ω belongs to Ωif it possesses the following properties:
(i) ω is a mapping from r0, 8s to E△“ E Y t△u; ωp0q P E.
(ii) ω is right continuous and possesses left limits in E on the stochastic interval
r0, ζpωqq, in the sense that limtÒs ωpsq exists in E for
s ă ζpωq :“ inf tt ą 0 : ωptq “ △u .
Moreover, if ωpsq “ △and if t ě s, then ωptq “ △.
(iii) The set E△is the one-point compactiﬁcation of E, or, if E is compact, △
is an isolated point of E△“ E Y t△u.
6.39. Remark. The collection tFt : t ě 0u is a ﬁltration: if s ă t, then Fs Ă Ft. Ev-
ery σ-ﬁeld Ft is an appropriate completion (extension) of the σ-ﬁeld σ pXpuq : u ď tq.
The family tFt : t ě 0u is continuous from the right: Ft “ Ş
sąt Fs. Since we con-
sider more or less the internal history tFt : t ě 0u, t ě 0, we suppress the notation
Ft, t ě 0, in our symbolism of our Markov process:
tpΩ, F, Pxq , pXptq, t ě 0q , pϑt, t ě 0q , pE, Equ .
Authors often write things like
␣
pPxqxPE , pXptqqtě0
(
, when the other items are clear
from the context.
6.40. Remark. The mappings Xptq : ΩÑ E△are called state variables; E is
referred to as the state space (sometimes stochastic state space). Put
ζ “ inf ts ą 0 : Xpsq “ △u .
Then ζ is called the life time of the process tXptq : t ě 0u.
The motion tXptq : t ě 0u is Px-almost surely right continuous and possesses left
limits in E on its life time:
(i) limsÓt Xpsq “ Xptq, (right continuity);
(ii) s ě t, Xptq “ △, implies Xpsq “ △, (△is cemetery);
(iii) limsÒt Xpsq “ Xpt´q P E, t ă ζ, (left limits in E on its life time).
These assertions hold Px-almost surely for all x P E. The probability P△may be
deﬁned by P△pAq “ δω△pAq, where ω△psq “ △, s ą 0.

6.41. Remark. The shift or translation operators ϑs : ΩÑ Ω, s ě 0, possess the
property that Xptq ˝ ϑs “ Xpt ` sq, Px-almost surely, for all x P E and for all s
and t ě 0. This is an extremely important property. For example fpXptqq ˝ ϑs “
fpXpt ` sqq, f P C0pEq, s, t ě 0. If Ωis the Skorohod space Ω“ D

r0, 8s, E△˘
,
then Xptqpωq “ ωptq “ Xpt, ωq “ ωptq, ϑtpωqpsq “ ωps ` tq, ω P Ω.
6.42. Remark. For every x P E, the measure Px is a probability measure on F with
the property that Px rXp0q “ xs “ 1. So the process starts at Xp0q “ x, Px-almost
surely, at t “ 0. This is the normality property.
6.43. Remark. The Markov property can be expressed as follows:

sion E

‰
denotes conditional expectation. The meaning of Ft is explained in
Remark 6.39. Let Y : ΩÑ C be a bounded random variable. This means that Y
is measurable with respect to the ﬁeld generated by tXpuq : u ě 0u. The Markov
property is then equivalent to
Ex
“
Y ˝ ϑs
ˇˇ Fs
‰
“ EXpsq rY s ,
(6.42)
Px-almost surely for all random variables Y and for all s ě 0. Notice that, in-
tuitively speaking, Fs is the information from the past, σ pXpsqq is the informa-
tion at the present, and Y ˝ ϑs is measurable with respect to some completion of
σ tXpuq : u ě su, the information from the future.

Markov process. Let S : ΩÑ 8 be a stopping time meaning that for every t ě 0 the
event tS ď tu belongs to Ft. This is the same as saying that the process t ÞÑ 1rSďts
is adapted. Let FS be the natural σ-ﬁeld associated with the stopping time S, i.e.

as follows:

is easy: put Y “ fpXptqq and Spωq “ s, ω P Ω. The other way around is much
more intricate and uses the cadlag property of the process tXptq : t ě 0u. In this
procedure the stopping time S is approximated by a decreasing sequence of discrete
stopping times pSn “ 2´nr2nSs : n P Nq. The equality
Ex rY ˝ ϑSn|FSns “ EXpSnq rY s , Px-almost surely,
(6.45)
is a consequence of (6.42) for a ﬁxed time.
Let n tend to inﬁnity in (6.45) to
obtain (6.44). The ”strong Markov property” can be extended to the ”strong time
dependent Markov property”:

random variable. The cartesian product r0, 8qˆΩis supplied with the product ﬁeld
B b F; B is the Borel ﬁeld of r0, 8q and F is (some extension of) σ pXpuq : u ě 0q.

where U is some open (or Borel) subset of E△. This kind of stopping times have the
extra advantage of being terminal stopping times, i.e. t`S˝ϑt “ S Px-almost surely
on the event tS ą tu. A similar statement holds for the hitting time T. The time
S is called the penetration time of EzU. Let p : E Ñ r0, 8q be a Borel measurable

As a consequence operators of the form Spξqfpxq :“ Ex rf pX pSξqqs, f a bounded
Borel function, possess the semigroup property. Also notice that S0 “ 0, provided
that the function p is strictly positive.

motion. Let E be the space Rν and let Ω:“ C pr0, 8q, Rνq, equipped with the

continuous there; it is only weak˚ continuous. The corresponding Markov process is
called ν-dimensional Brownian motion. A nice classical application of ν-dimensional
Brownian motion is its use in potential theory. A speciﬁc example is a description

From Blumenthal’s zero-one law, it follows that Pb rT “ 0s “ 0 or 1. It equals 1 if b

polar) subset of RνzU. In particular if the boundary of U is C1, then every point of
Rν is regular. We say that 1

The family tXptq : t ě 0u is said to be P-Markovian, if, for all s ě 0, and for all

Notice that Exr1s “ 1. By the time homogeneity and since the σ-ﬁeld
σ tXpuq, u ě 0u is countably determined, the expression Ex rY s is well-deﬁned (i.e.
independent of s ą 0, and as a function of x Borel measurable). If the state space E
is countable, so that the probability measure B ÞÑ P rXpsq P Bs is a discrete measure
(a combination of multiples of Dirac measures), then this Radon-Nykodim derivative
is an ordinary quotient and we enter the theory of discrete Markov processes. We
assume, in the Feller semigroup context, that x ÞÑ Ex rfpXptqqs belongs to C0pEq,
whenever f does so and whenever t ě 0.
6.49. Remark. Starting from Feller semigroups one may construct the correspond-
ing strong Markov processes. In this construction one ﬁrst replaces the semigroup
tSptq : t ě 0u with a family of (sub-)Markov transition functions tPpt, x, Bq:t ě 0u.
Here B ÞÑ Ppt, x, Bq is a (sub-)probability measure on E, with the property that

where now B is a Borel subset of E△. Put Ω1 “

where the functions fj, 1 ď j ď n are bounded Borel functions on E△. The hard
part is proving that the Skorohod space has full Px-measure (in fact its outer Px-
measure equals 1). The extension of Px to the product ﬁeld of Ω1 is a consequence
of the Kolmogorov extension theorem.
6.50. Remark. The fact that the σ-ﬁelds Ft, t ě 0, may be replaced with larger
ﬁelds, while still retaining the Markov property (or, more accurately, the strong
Markov property) is a consequence of the cadlag, continue `a droite, limit´ee `a gauche
property together with Choquet’s theorem on capacitable sets. These larger σ-ﬁelds
are certain completions of the σ-ﬁeld generated by the collection tXpuq : 0 ď u ď tu:
see assertion (c) of Theorem 6.36.
6.51. Remark. Since a Feller semigroup possesses a generator, A say, one also says
that A generates the associated strong Markov process. For example 1
2∆generates
Brownian motion. This concept yields a direct relation between certain (lower order)
pseudo-diﬀerential operators and probability theory. The order has to be less than

or equal to 2. This follows from the theory of L´evy processes and the L´evy-Khinchin
formula, which decomposes a continuous negative-deﬁnite function into a linear term
(probabilistically this corresponds to a deterministic drift), a quadratic term (this
corresponds to a diﬀusion: a continuous Brownian motion-like process), and a term
that corresponds to the jumps of the process (compound Poisson process, L´evy
measure). Quite a number of problems in classical analysis can be reformulated
in probabilistic terms. For instance for certain Dirichlet boundary value problems
hitting times are appropriate, for certain initial value problems Markov process
theory is relevant.
For other problems the martingale approach is more to the
point. For example there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the following
concepts:
(i) Unique (weak) solutions of stochastic diﬀerential equations in Rν:
(ii) Unique solutions to the corresponding martingale problem;
(iii) Markovian diﬀusion semigroups in Rν;
(iv) Feller semigroups generated by certain second order diﬀerential operators
of elliptic type.
(Regular) ﬁrst order perturbations of second order elliptic diﬀerential operators can
be studied using the Cameron-Martin-Girsanov transformation. Perturbations of
order zero are treated via the Feynman-Kac formula.

Operator semigroup and Markov processes
6.52. Remark. In our discussion we started with (generators of) Feller semigroups
or, even better, Feller-Dynkin semigroups. Another approach would be to begin
with symmetric Dirichlet forms (quadratic form theory) in L2pE, mq, where m is a
Radon measure on the Borel ﬁeld E of E. (By deﬁnition a Radon measure assigns
ﬁnite values to compact subsets and it is inner and outer regular.) The reader may
consult the books by Bouleau and Hirsch [6], by Fukushima, Oshima and Takeda
11], or by Z. Ma and M. R¨ockner [15]. In the latter reference Ma and R¨ockner
somewhat more general Dirichlet forms are treated. These Dirichlet need not be
symmetric, but they obey a certain cone type inequality:
|Epf, gq|2 ď KEpf, fqEpg, gq,
f,
g P D pEq .
Again one says that the Markov process is generated by (or associated to the Dirich-
let form E or to the corresponding closed linear operator: Epf, gq “ ´ ⟨Af, g⟩,
f P DpAq, g P D pEq.
(Notice that only regular Dirichlet forms correspond to
Markov processes.) We have taken the approach via C0pEq instead of L2pE, mq.
6.53. Remark. Examples of (Feller) semigroups can be manufactured by taking a
continuous function φ : r0, 8q ˆ E Ñ E with the property that
φ ps ` t, xq “ φ pt, φ ps, xqq ,
for all s, t ě 0 and x P E.
Then the mappings f ÞÑ Pptqf, with Pptqfpxq “
f pφ pt, xqq deﬁnes a semigroup.
It is a Feller semigroup, or Feller-Dynkin semi-
group, if limxÑ△φ pt, xq “ △. An explicit example of such a function, which does
not provide a Feller-Dynkin semigroup on C0 pRq is given by φpt, xq “

(example due to V. Kolokoltsov [36]). Here the process Xptq is in fact determin-
istic: Xptq “ φpt, Xp0qq. Put upt, xq “ Pptqfpxq “ f pφpt, xqq. Then Bu
Bt pt, xq “
´x3

Bxpt, xq. In fact this (counter-)example shows that solutions to the martin-
gale problem do not necessarily give rise to Feller-Dynkin semigroups . These are
semigroups which preserve not only the continuity, but also the fact that functions
which tend to zero at △are mapped to functions with the same property. How-
ever, for Feller semigroups we only require that continuous functions with values
in r0, 1s are mapped to continuous functions with the same properties. For every
ps, t, xq P r0, Ts2 ˆ E, 0 ă s ă t, the equality
Px rXptq P Es “ Px rXptq P E, Xpsq P Es
holds. On the other hand this hypothesis is implicitly assumed, if as sample path
space we take the Skorohod space D
`
r0, 8q , E△˘
. If Xptq P E, then 0 ď s ă t
implies Xpsq P E.
The main result, Theorem 2.5, as stated in Van Casteren [140] is not correct. That
is solutions to the martingale problem can, after having visited △, still be alive.
Compare this with Remark 2.12 in Van Casteren [145].

is symmetric (i.e. p0pt, x, yq “ p0pt, y, xq, x, y P E) and continuous on p0, 8qˆEˆE.
6.55. Remark. If E “ Rν with Lebesgue measure and if K0 “ H0 “ ´ 1

can be normalized through dividing it by the density ppt, x, yq.

is long and tedious, and requires stopping time arguments, and the fact that sets of
the form BzBr, where B is a Borel subset of E, and Br is the collection of regular
points of B, are polar sets. For details and for the proof of assertion (c) the reader
is referred to [36], Chapter 2, 3, and Appendix D. A hint that assertion (a) is true
can be seen as follows. Let the function f P C0pEq belong to the intersection of the
domains of K0 and V . Suppose that the function u : p0, 8q ˆ E Ñ C satisﬁes
Bu
Bt pt, xq “ ´ pK0 ` V q upt, xq,
lim
tÓ0 upt, xq “ fpxq.
(6.52)
Then the function upt, xq is given by the Feynman-Kac formula:

f pXptqq

(6.53)
A proof of the equality in (6.53) runs as follows. For t ą 0 and x P E deﬁne the
function vt,x : r0, tq Ñ C by

In the ﬁnal step in (6.55) we employed the ﬁrst part of (6.52). Consequently, the

The equality in (6.56) shows the claim we made above. Put

Then the Markov property implies that the family tSptq :, t ě 0u has the semi-
group property.
By the right-continuity of paths it also follows that this semi-
group is weakly contiuous, when viewed as a semigroup in C0pEq.
But then it
turns out to be weakly continuous in L2 pE, mq.
For this part to be true one
employs Khas’minskii’s lemma (see Theorem 6.65) and the density of the space
C0pEq X L2pE, mq in L2pE, mq. Let ´
`
K0 9`V
˘
be the generator of this semigroup.
Then K0 9`V extends K0 ` V . Let f belong to D

X DpV q. Then by Leibniz’
rule and the properties of the operator K0 we have

(6.57)
From (6.57) and the deﬁnition of generator we see that Sptqf belongs to D
`

and that
`
K0 9`V

Sptqf “ Sptq pK0 ` V q f.
(6.58)
By taking t “ 0 in (6.58) we infer
`
K0 9`V

f “ Sptq pK0 ` V q. As a consequence
we see that
`
K0 9`V

extends K0 ` V .
This completes a too brief outline of a proof of Theorem 6.56.

6.58. Remark. From our basic assumption it follows that the function V belongs
to L1

A problem we consider is the following. Let V and W be Kato-Feller potentials.
Give reasonable conditions on V and W in order that the diﬀerences Dptq :“

we obtained reads as follows. For the existence and properties of the resolution of
the identity, see Theorem 5.31 and Deﬁnition 5.27.
6.59. Theorem. Let tE0pξq : ξ P Ru be the spectral decomposition, or resolution of

sition (resolution of the identity) corresponding to K0 9`W. Let

The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) For every bounded interval A the operator E0pAqpW ´V qE1pAq is compact;
(ii) For some t ą 0 (for all t ą 0) the operator
exp
`
´t
`

(iii) For some t ą 0 (for all t ą 0), the operator Dptq is compact.

(6.60)
This is a consequence of the Markov property.
6.61. Remark. An equality like (6.50) can probably be used for ﬁrst order perturba-
tions, where the Cameron-Martin formula is applicable. In such a case we probably
have to deal with stochastic integrals instead of the process
t ÞÑ
ż t

pWpXpuqq ´ V pXpuqqq du.
6.62. Remark. Theorem 6.59 is probably not known, even in case we consider
K0 “ H0 “ ´ 1
2∆. So the corresponding process is Brownian motion.
6.63. Remark. We introduced Brownian motion as a Markov process with a certain
transition function. It can also be introduced as a Gaussian process tXptq : t ě 0u
(assume ν “ 1) such that E rXptqXpsqs “ minps, tq, or as a L`evy process with
negative deﬁnite function ξ ÞÑ
1
2 |ξ|2, or as a martingale with variation process
t ÞÑ t. It can also be seen as a weak limit of symmetric random walks: see, e.g.,
Bhattacharya and Waymire [15].

This proves the implication (ii) ñ (iii) in the presence of
(6.59). In the other situation, where we assume that, for some t0 ą 0, the function

For the convenience of the reader we insert a proof of the Stein and the Riesz-Thorin
interpolation theorems. The ﬁrst theorem is the same as Theorem 4.12.
6.66. Theorem (Theorem of Riesz-Thorin). Let pE0, A0, m0q and pE1, A1, m1q be
σ-ﬁnite measure spaces, and let
T : Lp0 pE0, A0, m0q ` Lp1 pE0, A0, m0q Ñ Lq0 pE1, A1, m1q ` Lq1 pE1, A1, m1q
be a linear operator such that
T P L pLp0 pE0, A0, m0q , Lq0 pE1, A1, m1qq X L pLp1 pE0, A0, m0q , Lq1 pE1, A1, m1qq .
Deﬁne, for 0 ă t ă 1, pt and qt by

(6.64)
Then T P L pLpt pE0, A0, m0q , Lqt pE1, A1, m1qq, and setting Mi “ }T}qi,pi, i “ 0, 1,
then }T}qt,pt ď M 1´t

Recall that the set of the simple functions (= ﬁnite linear combinations of indi-
cator functions of measurable sets with ﬁnite measure) a : E0 Ñ C is dense in
Lp pE0, A0, m0q or 1 ď p ă 8, and, for the same reason, the set of the simple func-
tions b : E1 Ñ C is dense in Lq pE1, A1, m1q, for every q P r0, 8q. Moreover, for

where the supremum is taken over all simple function b. Here q1 is the conjugate
exponent of q: 1
q ` 1
q1 “ 1. For a concise formulation of the Stein interpolation
theorem we introduce the notion of a holomorphic, or analytic, family of operators.
6.67. Definition. Let S “ t0 ď ℜz ď 1u be the closed unit strip in the complex
plane, and let z ÞÑ Tpzq be family of linear operators deﬁned on the space of simple
functions on pE0, A0, m0q. This operator family is called analytic (or holomorphic) if
for every pair of simple functions a : E0 Ñ C and b : E1 Ñ C, the product rTpzqas¨b
is m1-integrable and the function z ÞÑ
ş
E1 rTpzqas pxqbpxq dm1pxq is continuous and
bounded in S, and holomorphic in the interior of S.
Now we formulate the Stein interpolation theorem.
6.68. Theorem (Stein interpolation theorem). Assume that for every z P S, Tpzq is
a linear operator deﬁned in the set of the simple functions on E0, with values in the
measurable functions on E1, such that the function z ÞÑ Tpzq is holomorphic in the
sense of Deﬁnition 6.67. Moreover, assume that for some pj, qj P r1, 8s, j “ 0, 1,
the inequalities
}Tpitqa}Lq0 ď M0 }a}Lp0 ,
and
}Tp1 ` itqa}Lq1 ď M1 }a}Lp1 ,
t P R
(6.65)
hold for every simple function a, and for some ﬁnite constants M0 and M1. Then
for each t P p0, 1q, Tptq may be extended to a bounded linear operator, still called
Tptq), from Lpt pE0, A0, m0q to Lqt pE1, A1, m1q, with pt and qt deﬁned as in (6.64),

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Of course, if Tpzq “ T, then, essentially speaking, Theorem 6.68 reduces to Theorem
6.66. A proof of the Stein interpolation theorem may be based on the three line
lemma in complex analysis. This lemma reeds as follows. As above, S denotes the
closed strip t0 ď ℜz ď 1u.
6.69. Proposition (Three line lemma). Let F : S Ñ C be a bounded and continu-
ous on S, and let F be analytic on the interior of S. For 0 ď t ď 1, put
Mt “ sup t|F pt ` iyq| : y P Ru .
Then the inequality Mt ď M 1´t
0
M t
1 holds for all 0 ď t ď 1.
Proof. The three line lemma follows by applying the maximum modulus the-
orem to the holomorphic function Fεpzq, ε ą 0, deﬁned by
Fεpzq “ Fpzq
1 ` εz
1
α1´zβz ,
z P S,
where α ą M0, β ą M1. Then |Fεpzq| ď 1, and hence |Fpzq| ď a1´ℜzβℜz. By letting
α tend to M0 and β to M1 we obtain the desired result.

As noticed earlier, if Tpzq ” T in Theorem 6.68, then we get the Riesz-Thorin
interpolation theorem 6.66. For a proof of this result the reader is referred to Reed
and Simon [106], Theorem IX.21 page 40. Other sources of information are Lunardi
[87, 88]. The paper by Stein [131] is the origin of “Stein” interpolation.
6.70. Proposition. Let T : L1pE, mq Ñ L1pE, mq be a continuous linear map, with
norm }T}1,1. Let it also be a continuous linear map from L8pE, mq to L8pE, mq,
with norm }T}8,8. Then T is a continuous linear map from LppE, mq to LppE, mq
for which }T}p,p ď }T}1{p

6.71. Proposition. Let T : L1pE, mq Ñ L1pE, mq be a continuous linear map, with
norm }T}1,1. Let it also be a continuous linear map from L8pE, mq to L8pE, mq,
with norm }T}8,8. In addition, suppose that it maps L1pE, mq to L8pE, mq, with
norm }T}8,1. Then T is a continuous linear mapping from LppE, mq to LqpE, mq,
where 1 ď p ď q ď 8. Its norm }T}q,p obeys:
}T}q,p ď }T}1{q

6.72. Corollary. Let T : L1pE, mq Ñ L1pE, mq be a continuous linear map, with

with norm }T}8,8. In addition, suppose that it maps L1pE, mq to L8pE, mq, with
norm }T}8,1. Then T is a continuous linear mapping from LppE, mq to LqpE, mq,
where 1 ď p ď q ď 8. Moreover suppose that T “ S2, where S “ S˚. Its norm
}T}q,p obeys:
}T}q,p ď }T}1´p1{p´1{qq

Proof. Since T “ SS˚, it follows that

From this inequality, together with

Proof. Assertion (1) is a consequence of Proposition 6.70.
(2) In order to prove this assertion we apply Theorem 6.68 (Stein interpolation) to
the holomorphic function Spzq. For ξ P R the norm }Spiξq}1,1 coincides with
››V´ paI ` K0q´1››
1,1 “
››paI ` K0q´1 V´

Theorem 6.68 with p0 “ q0 “ 1, p1 “ q1 “ 8, and t “ 1 ´ 1{p, yields the desired
result.
(3) In order to prove this assertion we specialize assertion (2) to p “ 2. Since

the conclusion in assertion (3) follows.

sense.

2. This proves A´1 ď I. Hence T ´1 ď S´1, and so the
proof of Lemma 6.74 is complete now.

These integrals and derivatives have to be taken in strong sense.
6.76. Lemma. Let W and V be Kato-Feller potentials on E.
Suppose W ě V
(pointwise). Then
`
aI ` K0 9`V
˘´1 ě
`
aI ` K0 9`W
˘´1 .
This inequality is true in form sense as well as in the sense that f ě 0 implies
`
aI ` K0 9`V
˘´1 f ě
`
aI ` K0 9`W
˘´1 f,
pointwise.
Proof. Suppose W and V to be bounded. Otherwise replace W and V with
respectively Wn,m “ max pmin pW, mq , ´nq and Vn,m “ max pmin pV, mq , ´nq, and
let m and n tend to 8. Since W and are V bounded, we see that in form sense
aI`K0 9`W “ aI`K0`W ě aI`K0`V “ aI`K0 9`V . Hence, by virtue of Lemma
6.74, we get
`
aI ` K0 9`V
˘´1 ě
`
aI ` K0 9`W
˘´1. For the pointwise inequality, one
may use the Feynman-Kac representation.
This completes the proof of Lemma 6.76.
□
6.77. Definition. (General facts) As above the generator K0 is perturbed in two
ways. The ﬁrst is a “regular” perturbation, being a multiplication operator V . That
kind of operator was studied in Theorem 6.56. The other kind of perturbation is
the “singular” one, i.e. a perturbation by a potential barrier on a closed subset
Γ of E.
These singular perturbations will be treated presently.
Put Σ :“ EzΓ
and introduce the restriction operator J “ JΣ as follows: Jf “ fæΣ. Then its
adjoint J˚ : L2pΣ, mq Ñ L2pE, mq is given by the canonical extension: J˚fpxq “
fpxq for x P Σ and J˚fpxq “ 0 for x P Γ.
Moreover, we have J˚J “ 1Σ and
JJ˚ is the identity in L2pΣ, mq.

leaves the space C8pΣq invariant: see e.g.
Doob [41], Chapter 1.VIII. For V “ 0, this is shown in Demuth and Van Casteren
[36] Appendix D, Theorem D.21. A function in LppE, mq can be approximated by
functions in C0pEq in the Lp-norm. So that in the presence of L1-L8-smoothing,
the Lp-spaces LppΣ, mq, 1 ď p ă 8, are mapped into C0pΣq by the Feynman-Kac
semigroups “killed” on Γ. Their canonical extensions then belong to C0pEq: for
these results one has to mimic the corresponding proofs of Theorem 2.5 for the
singular case. The proof of this theorem was discussed in Chapter 3 of [32]. From
formula (2.51) in Corollary 2.32 item (b) of Demuth and Van Casteren [36] we see
that the operator

K0 9`V

that (6.71) has a meaning for functions f P D

the domain of the generalized Schr¨odinger form. In Chapter 2 of [36] the relation

In the proof double Stieltjes operator integrals are employed. The interested reader
is referred to the literature on this subject: Birman and Solomyak [17, 18, 19].
Some information on this topic can be found in Yafaev [155] as well. It is not very
clear under what circumstances these double Stieltjes operator integrals are well
deﬁned.
Proof. We will employ double Stieltjes operator integrals. The main formula
in (6.72) is almost trivial from the point of view of double Stieltjes operator integrals
(and if one takes the validity of Fubini’s theorem for such integrals for granted). Put

A proof without double operator integrals will be based on Cauchy’s theorem from
complex analysis, and on operator valued functions on a horizontal strip in the
complex plane. In fact it follows from assertion (iv) of Theorem 6.87 in Section 5

The random variables Uj, j “ 2, 3, . . ., are independent copies of the logistically
distributed variable U1, U0 ” 0: see Evans, Hastings, and Peacock [50]. For a proof
of Theorem 6.83 the reader is referred to Proposition 6.88. It is taken from [142].
6.84. Remark. Put, for T : H1 Ñ H0 a (bounded) linear operator,
Qpt0qT “ Elogistic rV0 piU1t0q TV1 p´iU1t0qs .
Then the formula in (6.72) is the same as saying that

The question which poses itself is the following. Let S : H1 Ñ H0 be a bounded
linear operator for which the Schatten class norm }S}p, 1 ď p ď 8 is ﬁnite. Does
it follow that limnÑ8
››pI ´ Qpt0qqn`1 S
››
p “ 0? If p “ 2 (Hilbert-Schmidt situation),
then this result is correct. An argument for this statement runs as follows. First
approximate the operator S in Hilbert-Schmidt by an operator-valued integral of the
form Sφ :“
ş
φpσqV0piσt0qSV1p´iσt0q dσ, where φ is a rapidly decreasing function
on R. Since limnÑ8

››pI ´ Qpt0qqn`1 S

we obtain the desired result. In [143] this question is answered in more or less full
generality. In the proof of Theorem 12 of [143] it is shown that

This formula follows by virtue of the following observation. The function at the right
hand side of Formula (6.75) is harmonic on the strip R ˆ

and it possesses
boundary values

The left hand side is harmonic on the same strip (in fact it is holomorphic there),
and has the same boundary values. The uniqueness part on the existence of solutions
to the classical Dirichlet problem on a strip, yields the formula in (6.75). For some
more details about the KMS-formula see Remark 6.85 below. Upon integrating the

vpτ, sq ds “ V0 piτt0q Dpt0qTV1 p´iτt0q .
If we read the above function vpτ, sq instead of upτ, sq, the identities in assertion (iv)
of the next theorem yield the basic formula in (6.72) in Theorem 6.82 of Section 4.
The author wonders whether there is some relationship between the Stein interpo-
lation theorem, i.e. Theorem 6.68, and the results on harmonic functions, including
the KMS-function, on the a strip. In fact in both cases (bounded) holomorphic
functions are involved.
6.87. Theorem. Let pX, }¨}q be a Banach space, and let f1, and f2 : R Ñ X be
continuous functions with the property that, for every τ P R, the following quantity

where U is a logistically distributed random variable.
Proof of Theorem 6.87. (i) This is a standard result in harmonic analysis
about the existence of harmonic functions on a strip with given boundary conditions.

(iii) Assertion (iii) follows from (ii) and Fubini’s theorem.
(iv) This equality is somewhat more involved. The second equality is a direct con-
sequence of the fact that the random variable U is supposed to be logistically dis-
tributed. In order to prove the ﬁrst equality we notice the following identities:

Holomorphic semigroups
CHAPTER 7
Holomorphic semigroups
In this chapter we will discuss certain aspects of holomorphic semigroups. In The-
orem 7.3 (generators of) exponentially bounded holomorphic semigroups are de-
scribed.
This is done via so-called sectorial operators.
In Section 3 the same
is done for (generators of) bounded holomorphic semigroups.
These semigroups
tPptq : t ě 0u are not only bounded, but, for some 0 ă α ď 1
2π, they also have an
analytic extension in some sector Vα “ tz P C : |arg z| ă αu which is bounded in
the sense that sup t}Pptq} : t P Vαu ă 8. In section 4 we discuss the relationship
between the Crank-Nicolson iteration scheme and generators of bounded analytic
semigroups. A certain functional calculus is developed which encompasses the rel-
evant operators; see Theorem 7.13 and its Corollary 7.14, Corollary 7.17. Finally
Section 5 is devoted to a discussion on the stability of the Crank-Nicolson iteration
scheme.
The author is indebted to Sergey Piskarev, University of Moscow, for interesting
discussions on the subject and for some relevant references.
1. Introduction
In this section holomorphic semigroups and their generators are characterized. For
a concise formulation for the results we introduce the following notation. Let 0 ă
α ď π and put Vα “ tz P C : |arg z| ă αu. Let tPptq : t ě 0u be a semigroup
of continuous linear operators in a Banach space X.
This semigroup is said to
be holomorphic or analytic if there exists 0 ă α ď
1
2π and a holomorphic map
rP : Vα Ñ LpXq such that rPptq “ Pptq for t ą 0. Instead of rPptq we usually write
Pptq for this extension. Again we have Ppz1 ` z2q “ Ppz1q ˝ Ppz2q for z1 and z2 in
Vα. We begin with a couple of deﬁnitions.
7.1. Definition. The semigroup tPpzq : z P Vαu is said to be exponentially bounded
if for each 0 ă φ ă α, there exists constants M “ Mφ and ω “ ωφ such that
}Ppzq} ď M exp pω |z|q for all z P Vφ.
7.2. Definition. Let tPptq : t ě 0u be a strongly continuous semigroup of operators
on a Banach space X. This semigroup is called (uniformly) bounded if
sup t}Pptq} : t ě 0u ă 8.
It is called a (uniformly) bounded analytic semigroup provided that it is (uniformly)
bounded and extends to a (uniformly) bounded analytic semigroup on a sector Vα

Holomorphic semigroups
where 0 ă α ď π{2. This means that, for some 0 ă α ď π{2,
sup t}Pptq} : t P Vαu ă 8.
Usually the adverb “uniformly” is omitted. In Theorem 7.9 below we give a char-
acterization of generators of bounded analytic semigroups in terms of sectorial op-
erators: see Deﬁnition 7.5. We also notice that part of this material comes from
Chapter 5 in [139].
2. Exponentially bounded analytic semigroups
In what follows we collect some of the characterizations of exponentially bounded
analytic semigroups.
7.3. Theorem. Let tPptq : t ě 0u be a strongly continuous semigroup in LpXq with
generator A and with resolvent family tRpλq : λ P ρpAqu. The following assertions
are equivalent:
(i) The semigroup tPptq : t ě 0u is analytic and has an exponentially bounded
extension.
(ii) There exists a complex number ζ, |ζ| “ 1, such that
lim sup

}x} “ 1u ą 0.
(iii) There exists π ą α ą 1
2π such that ρpAq Ą a ` V α for some a ą 0 and such
that
|λ| }Rpλq} ď C,
λ P a ` Vα
for an appropriate constant C.
(iv) There exists a constant C and a positive real number b such that ρpAq Ą
tλ P C : ℜλ “ 0,
|ℑλ| ą bu and such that
|λ| }Rpλq} ď C,
ℜλ “ 0,
|λ| ą b.
(v) lim suptÓ0 sup tt }APptqx} : x P DpAq,
}x} ď 1u ă 8.
(vi) The operator

7.4. Remark. Let A be the generator of a bounded semigroup tPptq : t ě 0u. If
in assertion (i) “bounded analytic” replaces “exponentially bounded analytic”, in
assertion (v) we assume

in assertion (vi) the operator

Theorem 7.9 follows.

Partial differential equations and operators
284 
Holomorphic semigroups
7.5. Definition. Operators A which satisfy (iii) in Theorem 7.3 are called sectorial
operators.
For more details on sectorial operators see, e.g., Lunardi [85] and also Haase [60].
The equivalency of (i), (ii) and (iv) is due to Kato: see Kato [75, 76, 77]. A proof
of the equivalency of (i), (iii), (iv) and (v) can be found in Pazy [97], pp. 61-64. In
Yosida [156], pp. 254–255 the equivalency of (i), (iii) and (v) is proved too. The
equivalency of (v), (vi) and (vii) can be found in Crandall, Pazy and Tartar [28]. In
[14] Beurling proves the equivalency of (i), (ix) and (x). The implication (viii) ñ
(ix) is easy. Let q be a polynomial for which the strict inequality in (ix) holds. For
appropriately chosen m and n in N the polynomial q0pzq :“ qpzqnzmn satisﬁes (viii).
In many textbooks on diﬀerential equations applications of analytic semigroup the-
ory can be found. In [132, 133] Stewart gives a number of interesting application of
the use of analytic semigroups. In [128] Sinclair applies holomorphic semigroups to
Banach algebra theory. In [99] and [100] Pisier uses Beurling’s characterization of
holomorphic semigroups to prove some geometric properties of Banach spaces. Here
the following fact is used. If Q1, . . . , Qn are commuting projections in a Banach
space, then the mapping t ÞÑ śn
k“1 tpI ´ Qkq ` e´tQku, t ě 0, is a holomorphic
semigroup. In [34] de Graaf has yet another application of holomorphic semigroups.
In [35] Delaubenfels introduces the notion of exponentially bounded holomorphic
integrated semigroup. He also gives some examples. For regularity properties of
solutions of initial value problems, in which sectorial operators play a fundamental
role see, e.g., Pr¨uss [103], Pr¨uss and Simonett [104], Lunardi [85] and others.
Before we prove Theorem 7.3 we insert the following proposition. It reﬁnes some of
its statements. Moreover it yields the equivalence of the assertions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)
and (v) of Theorem 7.3.
7.6. Proposition. Let A be the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup tPptq :
t ě 0u in LpXq. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) The semigroup tPptq : t ě 0u has an exponentially bounded holomorphic
extension in some angle Vα with 0 ă α ď 1
2π.
(ii) For every ζ P C, |ζ| “ 1, ζ ‰ 1, the inverses pζI ´ Pptqq´1 exist, as ev-
erywhere deﬁned bounded linear operators, for all suﬃciently small positive
real numbers t.
(iii) There exists ζ P C, |ζ| “ 1, ζ ‰ 1, such that the expression
lim inf
tÓ0
inf t}ζx ´ Pptqx} : x P X, }x} “ 1u
is strictly positive.
(iv) There are constants M ě 0, a P R and b ě 0 such that
M }pa ` iτqx ´ Ax} ě |τ| }x}
for all x P DpAq and for all τ P R with |τ| ě b.

(v) There exist constants a P R and 1
2π ă φ ă π such that the resolvent set of
A contains a ` Vφ and such that
sup t|λ| }Rpλq} : λ P a ` Vφu
is ﬁnite.
(vi) The expression
lim sup
tÓ0
sup tt }APptqx} : x P DpAq, }x} ď 1u
is ﬁnite.
Here, as always, Rpλq denotes the operator Rpλq “ pλI ´ Aq´1, whenever it exists
as a bounded linear operator which is everywhere deﬁned. Sometimes we will use
symbolic calculus utilizing operator valued integrals in the complex plane.
The
contour Γpa, φq, a P R, 0 ă φ ă π, denotes then the boundary of a ` Vφ oriented in
such a way that a ` Vφ is lying at the right-hand side.
7.7. Remark. Let A be the generator of a bounded semigroup tPptq : t ě 0u. If in
Proposition 7.6 assertion (i) we replace “exponentially bounded” with “bounded”,
in (iv) we take a “ 0, b “ 0, in (v) we take a “ 0, and in (vi) we assume
sup tt }APptqx} : t ą 0, }x} ď 1, x P DpAqu ă 8,
then part of Theorem 7.9 follows from the argumentation in the proof just below.
Proof of Proposition 7.6. (i) ñ (v) Suppose }Pptq} ď M exppωtq, for t P

for ℜλ ą ω. So the holomorphic map λ ÞÑ Rpλq, ℜλ ą a1, extends to an operator

This extension is again
denoted by Rpλq and in fact

for ℜµ ą 0 and x P X together with the uniqueness of Laplace transforms. Since A

for x P X and t ą 0 the vector Pptqx belongs to DpAq and that

Consequently, since DpAq is dense in X, the operators APptq, t ą 0, can be extended
to all of X. These extensions will be denoted by Cptq, t ą 0. Moreover (7.9) implies

|τ| }x} ď M2 }piτ ` aqx ´ Ax} ,
(7.17)

Let ω be the type of the semigroup

(7.26)
Deﬁne the polynomial r by the equality qpζq ´ qpzq “ pζ ´ zqrpzq, z P C, and put

Then, because of (7.26),

(v) ñ (vi) Let δ ą 0 and C ą 0 be such that t }APptqx} ď C }x} for all x P DpAq
and for all 0 ă t ă δ. As in the proof implication (vi) ñ (i) of Proposition 7.6 (see
(7.9) and (7.10)) there are constants M and ω such that
t }Cptq} ď M exppωtq,

(7.27)
where Cptq is the canonical extension of APptq to all of X. Then the map

deﬁnes a strongly continuous semigroup on X ˆ X with generator

(vi) ñ (v) Suppose that the map px, yq ÞÑ pAx, Ax ` Ayq, x, y P DpAq, generates a

Sptqpx, yq “ pPptqx, tAPptqx ` Pptqyq ,

(7.28)
The latter can be seen as follows. Put Bpx, yq “ pAx, Ax ` Ayq for x, y P DpAq
and put Dpx, yq “ pAx, Ayq for x, y P DpAq. Then D generates the semigroup

We conclude this chapter with the following corollary. It follows from an examination
of the proof of the implication (x) ñ (i) of Theorem 7.3.
7.8. Corollary. Suppose that the operator A is the generator of a strongly contin-
uous semigroup tPptq : t ě 0u. Then tPptq : t ě 0u has an exponentially bounded
holomorphic extension if and only if

The following theorem characterizes generators of bounded analytic semigroups as
sectorial operators whose resolvent sets contain the right half-plane tλ P C : ℜλ ą 0u.

lowing assertions are equivalent:

Proof of Theorem 7.9. The reason that the assertions in (iv), (v) and (vi)
are equivalent to the assertions in (i), (ii) and (iii) can be found in repeating the
proofs of the implications (v) ðñ (vi), (v) ðñ (vii) of Theorem 7.3, and also by
repeating the arguments in the implications (i) ùñ (v) ùñ (vi) ùñ (i) of Proposition
7.6. Proofs of the other implications run as follows.
(i) ùñ (ii) Let 0 ă α ă π{2 be such that A generates the bounded analytic
semigroup tPptq : t P Vαu. From (i) it follows that the sector Vα is such that the
constant Cα :“ sup t}Pptq} : t P Vαu is ﬁnite. Choose 0 ă δ ă min pα, π{2 ´ αq,
and put α0 “ π{2 ` α ´ δ.
Let λ P Vα0.
Then λ “ |λ| eiφ with |φ| ď α0.

In the ﬁnal step of (7.38) we employed the fact that the operator A is the generator
of the semigroup tPptq : t ě 0u. From (7.38) it follows that Qptqx “ Pptqx for t ě 0.
We still have to prove that t ÞÑ Pptqx, t ą 0, extends to an analytic semigroup which
is bounded on sector Vα with 0 ă α ă π{2. To achieve this we apply integration by

(7.46)
Fix t0 ą 0, and choose t P C such that 2 |t ´ t0| eC2 pC ` 1q ă t0. Then we deﬁne

From (7.48) it follows that t ÞÑ

1 ą δ ą 0 such that |t ´ t0| eC2 pC ` 1q ď t0 p1 ´ δq. Next we observe that the
operator rPptq does not really depend on t0 ą 0 in the sense that if t1, t2 ą 0, and if
t P C is such that |t ´ tj| eC2 pC ` 1q ă tj for j “ 1, 2, then

This can be achieved by diﬀerentiating the functions

and so the deﬁnition of rPptq does not really depend on t0. In particular, by taking
t0 “ t, it follows that rPptqx “ Pptqx whenever t ą 0. Also notice that for t0 we may
choose |t|. Consequently, the operators rPptq are deﬁned in the sector determined by
the inequality
|t ´ |t|| eC2 pC ` 1q ă |t| , t P C.

In other words the family

Altogether this completes the proof of Theorem 7.9.
□
Theorem 7.9 can be strengthened somewhat. The idea is that a densely deﬁned
closed linear operator A which satisﬁes (iii) in Theorem 7.9 is in fact the generator
of bounded analytic semigroup.
7.10. Theorem. Let A be a closed linear operator with a domain which is dense in
a Banach space X. The following assertions are equivalent:
(i) The operator A generates a bounded analytic semigroup.
(ii) There exists 1

7.11. Lemma. Let the family tQptq : t ě 0u be a uniformly bounded family of lin-
ear operator with the property that for every x P X the mapping t ÞÑ Qptqx is
Borel measurable. Put Rpλqx “
ş8
0 e´λtQptqx dt. Then the following assertions are
equivalent:
(i) The family tQptq : t ě 0u has the semigroup property, i.e. for all x P X the
equality Q ps ` tq x “ QpsqQptqx holds for almost all ps, tq P p0, 8qˆp0, 8q.
(ii) The family tRpλq : λ ą 0u has the resolvent property, i.e.,
pµ ´ λq RpλqRpµq “ Rpλq ´ Rpµq
for all pλ, µq P p0, 8q ˆ p0, 8q.

The implication (i) ùñ (ii) follows from (7.56) and (7.57). The other implication, (ii)
ùñ (i) also follows from these identities in conjunction with uniqueness of Laplace
transforms.
The proof of Lemma 7.11 is complete now.
□
Proof of Theorem 7.10. The proofs of the implications (i) ùñ (ii) and (ii)
ùñ (iii) are exactly the same as in the proof of Theorem 7.9.
In the proof of
the implication (iii) ùñ (i) we have to show that (iii) implies that the operator A
generates a strongly continuous semigroup. The proof of this implication in Theorem
7.9 supplies us with a candidate semigroup tQptq : t ą 0u determined by the equality

It remains to show that the semigroup tQptq : t ě 0u, with Qp0q “ I, is strongly
continuous. Because, once we have established this strong continuity, the proof of
the implication (iii) ùñ (i) can then be ﬁnished in the same way as we proved this
implication in Theorem 7.9. In order to prove the strong continuity we invoke the
equality of the ultimate expressions in (7.58). This equality applies to the eﬀect
that

x P X, we have
lim
tÓ0
`
λ pλI ´ tAq´1 x ´ x
˘
“ lim
tÓ0 tA pλI ´ tAq´1 x “ 0.
(7.62)
First this equality is proved for x P DpAq, and then the equality in (7.62) extends
to all x P X because DpAq is dense in X and the function t ÞÑ pλI ´ tAq´1 x, t ą 0,
is bounded. The fact that limtÓ0 Qptqx “ x then follows from (7.61) together with
Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem.
Altogether this completes the proof of Theorem 7.10.

4. Bounded analytic semigroups and the Crank-Nicolson iteration
scheme
In the present section we discuss the (implicit) Crank-Nicolson iteration scheme in
which a generator A of a bounded analytic semigroup plays a central role. The
present material is partly taken from [146] and [144]. Let pτjqjPN be a sequence
of strictly positive real numbers, and let A be the generator of a bounded analytic
semigroup in a Banach space X. Fix x0 P DpAq, and deﬁne the sequence pxnqnPN Ă
DpAq by the (implicit) Crank-Nicolson scheme:

Then the sequence pxnqnPN Ă X de-
termined by the Crank-Nicolson scheme is given by xn “ Anx0. In this paper it
is investigated under what conditions on x0 and the sequence of step-sizes pτjqjPN
the Crank-Nicolson scheme is stable in the sense that supnPN }Anx0} ă 8.

7.12. Theorem. The Crank-Nicolson scheme is stable provided one of the following
conditions is satisﬁed: (a) supk I2k ă 8 and x P X is arbitrary; (b) ř8
j“1 τj ă 8
and x belongs to DpAq, the domain of A; (c) ř8
j“1 τ ´1
j
ă 8 and x belongs to RpAq,
the range of A; (d) the sequence of positive step-sizes pτjqjPN is arbitrary, and x
belongs to the intersection DpAq X RpAq.
Suppose that the operator A is the generator of a bounded analytic semigroup in a
complex Banach space X. As is well-known this is the case if and only if DpAq is
dense and there exists a constant C such that
|λ| }Rpλq} ď C,
ℜλ ą 0.
(7.63)
Here Rpλq “ pλI ´ Aq´1. For more details see theorems 7.9 and 7.10. Let Ω“
tz P C : ℜz ă 0u be the open left half-plane in C, and let f : ΩÑ C be a bounded
holomorphic function which has a continuous extension up to the boundary which
we call again f. Then we have the following result.
7.13. Theorem. Let A be the generator of a bounded analytic semigroup on the
Banach space pX, }¨}q, and let f : ΩÑ C be a bounded continuous function on Ω
which is holomorphic on Ω. In addition, let the ﬁnite constant C be as in (7.63).
Then the operator fpAq has the following representations (x P X):

The equality in (7.72) is a direct consequence of the identity in (7.83). The equalities
in (7.81) and (7.82) apply to the eﬀect that the the two equalities in (7.64) and (7.65)
hold true. The third equality, i.e. (7.66), follows easily from the second one, i.e.
(7.65). The equalities in (7.67) through (7.69) are consequences of the equality in
(7.64). The equality in (7.70) is an easy consequence of (7.69) and (7.71) follows
from (7.70). The inequality in (7.75) is obtained from the equality in (7.73), the one
in (7.76) follows from the equality in (7.69), and the one in (7.77) follows from the
equality in (7.66). The constant C is as in (7.63).
This completes the proof of Theorem 7.13.

The equalities in (7.90) follow from (7.86) in Corollary 7.14.
Since sets of the
form t1 ´ cos fk ě ℓ2´n`1u X rδ, Rs, ℓě 1, 0 ă δ ă R ă 8, are compact the ﬁrst
assertion in Proposition 7.15 follows. Let the constant C be as in (7.63), let K be
a compact subset of the open interval p0, 8q, and pick x P X. The second assertion
in Proposition 7.15 is a consequence of the following observations:
(1) The inequality
›››A
`
ξ2I ` A2˘´1 x
››› ď 2C

implies that νpKqx is a vector in X indeed;
(2) The inequality

yields the claim that νpKqx belongs to DpAq.

The assertions in (1), (2) and (3) imply the second statement in Theorem 7.15, and
complete its proof.

From Corollary 7.14 in conjunction with the theory of vector measures we infer the
result in Theorem 7.16. The Orlicz-Pettis theorem says that a weakly-continuous
X-valued measure, deﬁned on a σ-ﬁeld F, is in fact an X-valued bounded vector
measure ν: see e.g. Diestel and Uhl [37]. A result by Bartle, Dunford and Schwartz
says that a bounded countably additive vector measure on a σ-ﬁeld possesses a
relatively weakly compact range: see [37] and also Section 1.2 in [147]. For some
proofs see, e.g., [71] and also [38]. As a consequence it follows that the collection

is contained in the closed convex hull of tνpBq : B P Fu. The measure λ has to be
such that, for every x˚ P X˚, the complex measure B ÞÑ ⟨νpBqx, x˚⟩is absolutely
continuous relative to the measure λ. Rybakov’s theorem says that λ can be taken of
the form B ÞÑ ⟨νpBqx, x˚
0⟩for some x˚
0 P X˚: see [114]. For closely related material
see, e.g., [73]. Because of the nature of νpBqx, in our case for λ we may choose the
Lebesgue mesure on R`. Let X˚˚ be the topological bi-dual of the Banach space X.
7.16. Theorem. Let pτjqjPN be a sequence of strictly positive real numbers. Let A
be the generator of a bounded analytic semigroup in the Banach space X, and let
x P X be such that the mapping

belongs to the closed convex hull of the set t2νpKqx : K Ă p0, 8q, K compactu, which
is bounded in X, and hence the Crank-Nicolson scheme is stable for such x P X.
Notice that the assumption (7.87) in Theorem 7.16 is equivalent to the fact that
x P X is such that for every x˚ P X˚ the integral

7.17. Corollary. Let the notation and hypotheses be as in Theorem 7.16.
In
particular, let pτjqjPN be any sequence of strictly positive real numbers. Then the
Crank-Nicolson iteration scheme with step sizes τj, j P N, is stable provided the
initial vector x belongs to DpAq X RpAq.
Proof. Let x “ Ay P RpAq be a member of DpAq. Then the mapping B ÞÑ
νpBqx, B P R`, represents a bounded vector measure indeed. The result in Corollary
7.17 then follows from Theorem 7.16.
□
For a concise formulation of the main result of this paper we introduce the following
deﬁnition.
7.18. Definition. Let A be the generator of a bounded analytic semigroup, let
pτjqjPN be a sequence of strictly positive real numbers, and let x P X. The Crank-
Nicolson iteration scheme is said to be stable for x and the step-sizes pτjqjPN if the

(d) The Crank-Nicolson scheme is stable for all x P DpAq X RpAq and all se-
quences of strictly positive step sizes pτjqjPN.
7.20. Definition. Let x P X and let pτjqjPN. The Crank-Nicolson scheme is called
consistent for x and pτjqjPN, provided that the limit

In Theorem 7.24 we shall prove that in assertion (b) and (c) of Theorem 7.19 the con-
clusion may be strengthened to “consistent” and “two step consistent” respectively
instead of just “stable”.

in assertion (a).

Proof. The second equality in (7.110) is a consequence of equality (7.85) in
Corollary 7.14. The ﬁrst equality in (7.110) and the ﬁrst two equalities in (7.111)

Products over a void index set are to be interpreted as I: e.g., ś0

ﬁnal equality in (7.111) then follows from (7.85) in Corollary 7.14. The equality of
the expression in (7.111) and the one in (7.112) follows from integration by parts.
The equality of (7.112) and (7.114) is a consequence of the following identity

for ξ ą 0 and x P X. The equality in (7.116) yields the equality of (7.112) and
(7.114). The equality of (7.113) and (7.114) follows from the equality

sin f2kpξqf 1

In order to ﬁnish the proof of Lemma 7.22 we still need to show the identity in
(7.109). This equality is a consequence of the equalities in (7.110). If the operator
A is invertible, then this implication is immediate, otherwise we replace A with
A ´ ωI, ω ą 0, and let ω Ó 0.
This concludes the proof of Lemma 7.22.
□
From the equalities in Lemma 7.22 we obtain the following abstract results in nu-
merical analysis.

Proof. The equalities in Lemma 7.22 also hold for complex numbers A with
negative real part. By putting A “ 0 in (7.109) we get the ﬁrst equality in (7.117).
Taking A a negative real number, and multiplying the equalities in (7.111) by A,
and letting A tend to ´8 shows the second equality in (7.117).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

(7.127)
In (7.126) and (7.127) the suprema are taken over all compact subsets K of p0, 8q.
Proof. The fact that the two spaces mentioned in (7.125) coincide is a standard
result in complex measure theory. The theorem of Hahn-Banach shows that the
inequalities in (7.127) follow from those in (7.126). The ﬁrst inequality in (7.126) is
trivial. The second one can be proved as follows. Fix x P X and x˚ P X˚. Deﬁne,
for j “ 1, 2, 3, 4 the open subsets Bx,x˚,j of p0, 8q as follows:

The second inequality in (7.126) readily follows from (7.128). In order to complete
the proof of Theorem 7.25 it suﬃces to prove that, if a vector x P X belongs to
Xν,weak, then supK }νpKqx} ă 8. To this end we consider the following subset of
X˚:
Bx,ν :“ tx˚ P X˚ : |⟨νpKqx, x˚⟩| ď 1 for all compact subsets K of p0, 8q.u
(7.129)
Then the subset Bx,ν is a closed, absolutely convex and absorbing subset of the
Banach space X˚. In other words it is a barrel in X˚. Since barrels in Banach
spaces contain neighborhoods of the origin, it follows that there exists δpxq ą 0 such
that the ball of radius δpxq is contained in Bx,ν. That is to say, if }x˚} ď δpxq, then
|⟨νpKqx, x˚⟩| ď 1. Or in other words: for all compact subsets K Ă p0, 8q we have
}x˚} ď 1 ùñ |⟨νpKqx, x˚⟩| ď
1
δpxq.
And hence another application of the theorem of Hahn-Banach shows }νpKqx} ď
δpxq´1. This concludes the proof of Theorem 7.25.

The equalities in (7.133) can be understood by applying Fubini’s theorem to the
ﬁnal double integral together with some simple manipulations. The equalities in
(7.132) follow by ﬁrst applying (7.133) to an operator of the form A ´ ωI instead of
A, and then letting ω tend to 0.
7.27. Theorem. The following assertions hold true:
(i) The operator PRpAq is a projection operator from X0 onto RpAq, the closure
of RpAq.
(ii) X0 “ NpAq ` PRpAqX0 “ NpAq ` RpAq.
(iii)
››PRpAqx

(iv) If the space X is reﬂexive, then X0 “ X.
7.28. Remark. Theorem 7.25 shows that it is useful to investigate the following
subspace XA of X:
XA “ tx P X : sup t}νpKqx} : K compact subset of p0, 8qu ă 8u .
(7.134)
As observed earlier the space XA contains the subspace NpAq ` RpAq X DpAq. If
XA is a closed subspace, then XA contains the closure of NpAq ` RpAq X DpAq.
If, in addition, X is reﬂexive, then X “ NpAq ` RpAq, and X is the closure of
NpAq ` RpAq X DpAq. The space XA coincides with the space

The coincidence of the spaces mentioned in (7.135) is closely related to the theory of
vector-valued Pettis integrals and Gelfand integrals: see, e.g., Diestel and Uhl [37],
and also [94]. Pettis’ theorem says that a set function µ on a σ-ﬁeld F with values
in a Banach space X and has the property that B ÞÑ ⟨µpBq, x˚⟩for all x˚ P X is in
fact an X-valued measure in the sense that if B “ Y8

where the supremum is taken over all ﬁnite number of pairs pαj, βjqn
j“1 such that
0 ă α1 ă β1 ă α2 ă β2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă αn ă βn. In fact (7.137) says that the compact
subsets in the deﬁnition of the space Xν (see (7.134)) may be taken of the form
K “ Yn
j“1 rαj, βjs where 0 ă αj ă βj, 1 ď j ď n.

(7.138)
Here the space L8 pR`q consists of all bounded complex-valued Borel-measurable
functions f deﬁned on R` “ p0, 8q, and Hol pΩq consists of all holomorphic complex-
valued function on the open subset Ωof C. The subset Vα Ă C, 0 ă α ă π, is deﬁned
as the sector Vα “ tµ P C : |argpzq| ă αu. If |fpηq| ď 1, η ą 0, then |Tfpµq| ď

provided that µ P ´Vα. The latter inequality is a consequence of the fact that

In fact for f we may choose indicator functions f “ 1B of Borel subsets B of p0, 8q.
Then the mapping B ÞÑ T1Bpµq yields a Hol p´V0q-valued measure. These functions
have upper-bound

□
The following result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 7.32 and Lemma 7.33.
7.34. Theorem. Let the notation and hypotheses be as in Theorem 7.32 and Lemma
(7.33). Then the following inequality holds:

(7.165)
From Theorem 7.34 we see that that for all x P X the Crank-Nicolson iteration
scheme is stable provided that the sequence of functions η ÞÑ b2kpηq, k P N, is
uniformly bounded. Also notice that, by the inequality
›››››

with C as in (7.63), the one-step Crank-Nicolson scheme is stable if and only if the
two-step Nicolson iteration scheme is stable.
7.35. Theorem. Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(1) There exists a constant C1 such that

In fact, if C1 is such that (7.166) holds, then C2 “ πC1 ` 2 satisﬁes (7.166).
Conversely, if C2 is a constant for which (7.167) holds, then (7.166) is true with
C1 “ 2C2

Proof. The proof of Theorem 7.35 is essentially speaking contained in the proof
of Proposition 7.38.

In order to further investigate conditions imposed on the step size pτjqjPN we insert
the following proposition, which has also some relevance on its own.
7.37. Corollary. Let the sequence of positive real numbers tτj : j P Nu satisfy
(7.168) in Theorem 7.36, and let A be the generator of a bounded analytic semigroup
in a Banach space pX, }¨}q with domain DpAq. Then the Crank-Nicolson iteration
scheme

I ` 1

˙
xn,
x0 P DpAq,

is stable in the sense that supnPN }xn} ă 8.
Proof. Corollary 7.37 is a consequence of Theorem 7.36 in conjunction with
Theorem 7.34.

where the minimum is taken over all η with the property that

Then the Crank-Nicolson iteration scheme is stable.
Proof. This result follows from Corollary 7.39 by applying it to the functions

in which η is replaced with 2{η. In addition, the elementary
equality arctan η ` arctan p1{ηq “ 1

are used to see that Corollary 7.40 is a consequence of Corollary 7.39.

The following corollary is a consequence of Theorem 7.34) of Corollary 7.39 and of
Corollary 7.40. It shows that the Crank-Nicolson iteration scheme is stable provided
that the quantity M

7.41. Corollary. Let the sequence of positive real numbers tτj : j P Nu satisfy
p7.178q in Corollary 7.40, and let A be the generator of a bounded analytic semigroup
in a Banach space pX, }¨}q with domain DpAq. Then the Crank-Nicolson iteration
scheme in (7.170) is stable in the sense of Corollary 7.37.
7.42. Corollary. Let the sequence τj, j P N, be such that 0 ă infj τj ď supj τj ă 8.
Then Crank-Nicolson iteration scheme, as described in Corollary 7.37 is stable.
Proof. It is not so diﬃcult to see that

and hence, the conclusion in Corollary 7.42 follows from Corollary 7.41.
□
7.43. Corollary. Let τj “ Rpjq ą 0, where the function η ÞÑ Rpηq is a rational
function taking its values in p0, 8q. Then the Crank-Nicolson iteration scheme, as
described in Corollary 7.37, is stable.
Proof. A rational function possesses either one of the following properties:
(1) it ultimately decreases to 0;
(2) it ultimately increases to 8;
(3) it possesses a strictly positive ﬁnite limit.
If limjÑ8 Rpjq exists and is ﬁnite and strictly positive, then the result in Corollary
7.43 follows from Corollary 7.42.
Since M

, it suﬃces to
consider the situation that, ultimately, Rpξq increases to 8. Since stability is only
aﬀected for j large, without loss of generality we may assume that the function
ξ ÞÑ Rpξq is increasing for ξ ě τ1. In fact we let the Crank-Nicolson scheme start
after m steps, and replace τm with τ1. Then we write η “ Rpξq, τj “ Rpjq, to obtain:

Elements of functional analysis
CHAPTER 8
Elements of functional analysis
In this chapter we discuss and prove some results which are useful to understand the
main part of the book. Among other things the reader will ﬁnd formulations of the
Banach-Steinhaus theorem for Fr´echet spaces, the closed graph theorem and results
related the Hahn-Banach theorem like Mazur’s theorem. The results and proofs are
taken from Rudin [113], Gohberg and Goldberg [56], and from Waelbroeck [150].
For elementary proofs of the uniform boundedness principle in Banach spaces, not
using a Baire category argument, but kind of a gliding hump technique, see e.g.
Hennefeld [61] or Sokal [129].
1. Theorem of Hahn-Banach
Let X be a real or complex vector space. A functional p : X Ñ R is called sub-
additive if ppx ` yq ď ppxq ` ppyq for all x, y P X. It is called positive homogeneous
provided p pλxq “ λppxq for all λ ě 0 and for all x P X. The functional p is called a
semi-norm, if it attains its values in r0, 8q, is sub-additive, and if p pλxq “ |λ| ppxq
for all λ P R, or λ P C, and x P X.
8.1. Theorem (Hahn-Banach, analytic version in a real vector space). Let X be a
vector over R, let p : X Ñ R be a sub-additive, positive homogeneous functional on
X, let M be a real linear subspace of X, and let f : M Ñ R be a real-valued linear
functional on M with the property that fpxq ď ppxq for all x P M. Then there exists
a linear functional f0 : X Ñ R which extends f, i.e. f0pxq “ fpxq, x P M, and
which is such that ´pp´xq ď fpxq ď ppxq for all x P X.
Proof. Suppose M ‰ X, and choose x1 R M. Put M1 “ M ` Rx1. Then M1
is a vector subspace of X which contains M, and
fpxq ´ p px ´ x1q ď p py ` x1q ´ fpyq,
x, y P M.
(8.1)
Choose α P R in such a way that
sup
xPM tfpxq ´ p px ´ x1qu ď α ď inf
yPM tpy ` x1q ´ fpyqu .
By (8.1) such a choice is possible. Deﬁne the functional f1 : M1 Ñ R by
f1 px ` tx1q “ fpxq ` tα, x P M, t P R.
Then f1pxq “ fpxq, x P M. Moreover, ´pp´yq ď f1pyq ď ppyq, y P M1. Let P be the
collection of all ordered pairs pM 1, f 1q with the following properties: M 1 is a linear

Elements of functional analysis
subspace of X containing M, and f 1 is a linear functional on M 1 which extends
f, and which is such that f 1pyq ď ppyq, y P M 1. Partially order this collection by
declaring pM 1, f 1q ď pM 2, f 2q to mean that M 1 Ă M 2 and f 1pyq “ f 2pyq, y P M 1.
By Hausdorﬀ’s maximality theorem there exists a maximal totally ordered sub-
collection Ωof P.
Put Ă
M “ Y tM 1 : pM 1, f 1q P Ωu, and deﬁne rf : Ă
M Ñ R by
rfpyq “ f 1pyq if y P M 1. Then rf is well-deﬁned, and rfpyq ď ppyq, y P Ă
M. By the ﬁrst
part of he proof it follows that Ă
M “ X. It also follows that rf can be taken as f in
the theorem. This completes the proof of Theorem 8.1.
□
8.2. Theorem (Hahn-Banach, analytic version in a complex vector space). Let X
be a vector over C, let p : X Ñ r0, 8q be a semi-norm on X, let M be a linear
subspace of X, and let f : M Ñ C be a complex-valued linear functional on M with
the property that ℜfpxq ď ppxq for all x P M. Then there exists a linear functional
f0 : X Ñ C which extends f, i.e. f0pxq “ fpxq, x P M, and which is such that
|fpxq| ď ppxq for all x P X.
Proof. The proof of the complex version can be recovered from the real version
of the Hahn-Banach theorem, by putting upxq “ ℜfpxq, x P M. Then the real-
valued functional u satisﬁes the conditions of the (real) Hahn-Banach theorem. Here
f : M Ñ C is as in the theorem. Let u0 : X Ñ R be the real extension of u to all
of X which is such that u0pxq ď ppxq, x P M. The mapping f0pxq “ u0pxq´iu0pixq,
x P X, then has the required properties. The proof of Theorem 8.2 is complete
now.
□
8.3. Theorem (Hahn-Banach, geometric version). Let A and B be disjoint convex
subsets of a locally convex vector space X.
(a) If B open is (and A X B “ H), then there exists a real number γ and a
contiunuous linear functional Λ : X Ñ C with the property that, for all
vectors b P B and for all vectors a P A, the following inequality is true:
ℜΛpbq ă γ ď ℜΛpaq.
(b) If B is closed and if A is compact (and as above A X B “ H), then there
exist real numbers γ1 and γ2 and a continuous linear functional Λ : X Ñ C
with the property that, for all vectors b P B and for all vectors a P A, the
following inequality is true:
ℜΛpbq ď γ1 ă γ2 ď ℜΛpaq.
Proof. (a) Fix a vector a0 P A and ﬁx a vector b0 P B and consider the
neighborhood of the zero-vector V deﬁned by V “ B ´ A ` a0 ´ b0. Let pV be
its Minkowski functional. Since the vector a0 ´ b0 does not belong to V , it follows
that pV pa0 ´ b0q ě 1. Deﬁne the real linear functional f : Rpa0 ´ b0q Ñ R by
f pλpb0 ´ a0qq “ λpV pa0´b0q, λ P R. Then we have fpyq ď ppyq for all y P Rpa0´b0q.
By virtue of the analytic version of the Hahn-Banach theorem there exists a real
linear functional u : X Ñ R with the properties that upxq ď pV pxq for all x P X

Elements of functional analysis
that upa0 ´ b0q “ pV pa0 ´ b0q ě 1. Put Λpxq “ upxq ´ iupixq, x P X, and notice
that Λpλxq “ λΛpxq for λ P C and x P X. Note that the functional Λ is continuous.
Because, let V0 be an absolutely convex closed neighborhood of the origin contained
in V , and let pV0 be its Minkowski functional. Then |Λpxq| ď pV0pxq for all x P X. If
b belongs to B and if a belongs to A, then ℜΛ ppb ´ a ` a0 ´ b0q ă 1 ď ℜΛpa0 ´ b0q.
Deﬁne the constant γ by γ “ inf tℜΛpaq : a P Au. This constant γ then veriﬁes the
required conditions.
(b) Select an open absolutely convex neighborhood of the origin U in such a way
that A X pB ` Uq “ H. Since A is a compact set and X is locally convex such a
neighborhood of the origin exists. Deﬁne the zero-neighborhood V by V “ B ´ A `
U ` a0 ´ b0, where a0 is chosen in A and where b0 is chosen in B. The vector a0 ´ b0
does not belong to V and hence pV pa0 ´ b0q ě 1. Again there exists a functional
Λ : X Ñ C with the property that ℜΛpa0 ´ b0q “ pV pa0 ´ b0q ě 1 and for which
ℜΛpxq ď pV pxq for all x P X. Deﬁne γ1 by γ1 “ supbPB ℜΛpbq and deﬁne γ2 via the
formula γ2 “ infaPA ℜΛpaq. The inequality ℜΛpyq ď ℜΛpaq ´ ℜΛpbq follows for all
y P U, for all a P A for all b P B. Consequently
γ2 ´ γ1 ě sup
yPU ℜΛpyq “ sup
yPU |Λpyq| ą 0
and also
ℜΛpbq ď γ1 ă γ2 ď ℜΛpaq.
This completes the proof of Theorem 8.3.

The analytic version of the Hahn-Banach theorem can also be deduced from the
geometric version. Putting it diﬀerently, let p : X Ñ R be positive homogeneous
and sub-additive continuous linear functional, deﬁned on a locally convex space
X and let f : M Ñ C be a linear functional, deﬁned on the linear subspace M
and that veriﬁes ℜfpxq ď ppxq for all x P M and that possesses the property
that ℜfpx0q “ ppx0q “ 1 for some x0 P M. Prove that there exists a functional
f0 : X Ñ C with the following properties:
(a) f0pxq “ fpxq for x P M en
(b) ℜf0pxq ď ppxq for x P X.
For a proof we consider the following two convex subsets of X that are disjoint:
U :“ tx P X : ppxq ă 1u and C :“ tx P M : ℜfpxq ě 1u. We notice that the vector
x0 belongs to C and hence C is non-empty.
From the geometric version of the
Hahn-Banach theorem it follows that there exists a complex linear functional Λ and
a constant γ such that the following inequalities are satisﬁed:
ℜΛpuq ă γ ď ℜΛpvq
for all vectors u P U and for all vectors v for which ℜfpvq ě 1. Since the zero-vector
belongs to U, it follows that γ ą 0. So we may consider f0 :“ Λ
γ . Then ℜf0pxq ă 1
if ppxq ă 1 and if x P M is such that ℜfpxq ě 1, then ℜf0pxq ě 1. It follows that
ℜf0pxq ď ppxq for all x P X and the following assertion follows as well. If x P M is
such that ℜfpxq ě η, then ℜf0pxq ě η and this is true for any η ą 0. Consequently
we see that ℜf0pxq ě ℜfpxq for all x P M. Since M is a linear subspace, it follows
ℜfpxq “ ℜf0pxq for all x P M. This proves the statement.
8.4. Corollary. Let X be a locally convex vector space and let V be a convex neigh-
borhood of the origin. Let pV pxq :“ inf tt ą 0 : x P tV u, x P X, be its Minkowski
functional, and let
V 0 “
č
xPV
tx˚ P X˚ : ℜ⟨x, x˚⟩ď 1u
be its polar set. Then pV pxq “ sup tℜ⟨x, x˚⟩: x˚ P V 0u for all x P X. In fact, the
proof will show that, for x P X given, there exists a continuous linear functional
x˚ P V 0 such that pV pxq “ ℜ⟨x, x˚⟩.
Proof. Fix x0 P X and deﬁne f : Rx0 Ñ R by fpλx0q “ λpV px0q. Then fpyq ď
pV pyq for all y in the real subspace spanned by x0. By the Hahn-Banach extension
theorem there exists a real linear functional f0 : X Ñ R such that f0pxq ď pV pxq,
x P X, and such that fpyq “ f0pyq for all y P Rx0. Deﬁne the complex linear
functional x˚
0 by ⟨x, x˚
0⟩“ f0pxq ´ if0pixq, for x P X. It follows that ℜ⟨x, x˚
0⟩“
f0pxq ď pV pxq for all x P X. If x belongs to V , then pV pxq ď 1 and so, for such
x, ℜ⟨x, x˚
0⟩ď 1. Consequently x˚
0 belongs to V 0 and since ℜ⟨x0, x˚
0⟩“ pV px0q, we
infer that pV px0q “ ℜ⟨x0, x˚
0⟩, with x˚
0 P V 0. This proves the claim in Corollary
8.4.

The following result implies that a convex subset of a locally convex topological
vector space pX, Tq is T-closed if and only if it is weakly closed. This is Mazur’s
theorem.
8.5. Proposition. Let C be a closed convex subset of a locally convex topological
vector space pX, Tq. Then
C “

Proof. Pick
x0 P
č
tℜΛ ď α : C Ď tℜΛ ď αuu
(8.2)
and assume that x0 does not belong to the T-closed convex subset C. From the geo-
metric version of the Hahn-Banach theorem, it follows that there exists a continuous
linear functional Λ : X Ñ C and a constant γ, such that ℜΛpx0q ą γ ě ℜΛpxq for
all x P C. This contradicts (8.2). Whence
č
tℜΛ ď α : C Ď tℜΛ ď αuu Ď C.
The other inclusion being trivial, this proves Proposition 8.5.

8.7. Theorem (Alaoglu-Bourbaki). Let E˚ be the topological dual space of a locally
convex topological vector space E, and let B be an equi-continuous family of linear
functionals in E˚. Then B is relatively compact for the weak˚ topology. In particular
it follows that the polar set U ˝ of a zero-neighborhood U is σpE˚, Eq-compact.
Proof. Let pW be the Minkowski-functional of the convex zero-neighborhood
W.
Since B is equi-continuous there exists an absolutely convex, closed zero-
neighborhood V with the property that

It follows that V ˝ can be identiﬁed with the closed subset p˚q of the compact set

1.1. Baire category. In Theorem 8.10 we need the notion of Baire category.
The precise deﬁnition reads as follows.
8.8. Definition. Let pS, Tq be a topological space. A subset E Ă S is said to be
nowhere dense in S if its closure has empty interior. The sets of ﬁrst category in S
are those that are countable unions of nowhere dense subsets. Any subset of S that
is not of the ﬁrst category is said to be of the second category in S.
Sometimes subsets of the ﬁrst category are called meager, and subsets of the second
category non-meager. Let pS1, T1q and pS2, T2q be topological Hausdorﬀspaces, and
let h : S1 Ñ S2 be a surjective homeomorphism. Let E be a subset of S1. Then E
and h pE1q are of the same category in pS1, T1q respectively pS2, T2q. Subsets of sets
of the ﬁrst category are of the ﬁrst category. Countable unions of sets of the ﬁrst
category are of the ﬁrst category. Closed subsets with empty interior are of the ﬁrst
category. The following theorem implies that complete metric spaces, and locally
compact Hausdorﬀspaces are of the second category in themselves.

8.9. Theorem. If S is either
(a) a complete metric space, or
(b) a locally compact Hausdorﬀspace,
then every countable intersection of dense open subsets of S is dense in S.
Although this result is well-known, we include a proof for completeness.
Proof. Suppose that pVjqjPN is a sequence of dense open subsets of S, and
let B0 be an arbitrary nonempty open subset of S. If n ě 1 and an open subset
Bn´1 ‰ H has been chosen, then, because Vn is dense in S, there exists an open
subset Bn ‰ H with Bn Ă Vn X Bn´1. In case (a), Bn may be taken to be ball
of radius ă 1{n; in case (b) this choice is made in such a way that Bn is compact.
Put K “ Ş
nPN Bn. In case (a) the centers of the nested balls Bn form a Cauchy
sequence which converge to some point of K, and so K ‰ H. In case (b), K ‰ H by
compactness. The construction shows that K Ă B0 and K Ă Vn for each n. Hence
B0 intersects Ş
nPN Vn. This completes the proof of Theorem 8.9.
□
8.10. Theorem. Let B be a weakly bounded subset of a locally convex topological
vector space pE, Tq. Then B is T-bounded.
Proof. Let V be an arbitrary closed T-zero neighborhood, which is absolutely
convex. It suﬃces to prove that the set B is contained in a certain scalar multiple
of V . Put
K “ V ˝ “

tx˚ P E˚ : |x˚pxq| ď 1u .
Then it follows that
V “

Assume that x0 does not belong to V . By the Hahn-Banach theorem there exists a
linear functional x˚
0 P E˚ in such a way that Re x˚
0px0q ą 1 ě |x˚
0pxq| for all x P V .
Hence, x0 is not a member of Ş

Elements of functional analysis
The open mapping theorem for Banach spaces reads as follows: see Theorem 8.24
as well.
8.14. Theorem (Open mapping theorem). Let X be a Banach space and let Y be
a normed linear space. Suppose that T : X Ñ Y is a continuous linear operator
that is surjective.
So TpXq “ Y .
Let BX be the open unit ball of X: BX “
tx P X :} x }ă 1u. Then TBX is an open subset of Y and Y is also a Banach space.
The following result says that the foregoing theorems (for Banach spaces X and Y )
are equivalent. Theorem 8.19 below characterizes those locally convex topological
vector spaces X for which an adapted version of the Banach-Steinhaus result holds.
For the same spaces the closed graph theorem is valid. The uniform boundedness
in Theorem 8.12 is replaced with the equi-continuity of a family of continuous op-
erators. It turns out that the class of spaces X for which the closed graph theorem
or the Banach-Steinhaus theorem hold for all Banach spaces Y coincides with the
class of the so-called barreled spaces: see Deﬁnitions 8.16 and 8.20. Corollary 8.22
shows that Fr´echet spaces are barreled.
8.15. Theorem. The following assertions are equivalent for arbitrary Banach spaces
X and Y .
(a) Let F be a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear operators from X
to Y . Then sup
TPF
}T} ă 8. In other words, every pointwise bounded family
of continuous linear operators from X to Y is uniformly bounded.
(b) Every everywhere deﬁned closed linear operator T : X Ñ Y is continuous.
(c) Every surjective continuous linear operator T : X Ñ Y is an open mapping.
Proof. (c) ñ (b). Deﬁne the projection Π : X ˆ Y Ñ X by Πpx, Txq “ x.
The restriction of Π to GpTq is surjective (and injective). Let ΠG be this restriction.
From the open mapping theorem it follows that there exists a δ ą 0 with the property
that the subset:
ΠG
´
GpTq
č
tpx, yq P X ˆ Y : }x} ď 1, }y} ă 1u

contains the ball tx P X : }x} ď δu. Consequently: }x} ď δ ñ }Tx} ď 1. For x
arbitrary, x ­“ 0, we obtain
››››T
ˆ
δ x
}x}
˙›››› ď 1.
Hence }Tx} ď 1
δ }x}. This means that T is continuous.
(b) ñ (a). Suppose that Y is complete (this can always be achieved by taking the
completion of Y instead of Y itself. Let B pF, Y q be the vector space of all functions
f : F Ñ Y with the property that }f} :“ sup t}fpTq} : T P Fu ă 8. Deﬁne the
linear operator A : X Ñ B pF, Y q by rAxs pTq “ Tx, x P X. The operator A is
linear, its graph is closed in X ˆ B pF, Y q. The operator A is everywhere deﬁned.

Hence, by the closed graph theorem, A is continuous. This is the same as saying
that there exists a ﬁnite constant c with the property that
sup
TPF
}rAxs pTq} ď c }x}
for all x P X. Hence }Tx} ď c }x}, x P X. Whence }T} ď c, T P F.
(b) ñ (c). Consider the mapping S : Y Ñ X{NpTq, deﬁned by S : Tx ÞÑ x`NpTq,
x P X. The operator S is everywhere deﬁned on the Banach space Y . Moreover
S has a closed graph. This is so because we have the following. Let pxn : n P Nq
be a sequence in X with the property that, in the cartesian product Y ˆ X{NpTq,
pTxn, STxnq converges to py, x ` NpTqq. Then limnÑ8 xn ` NpTq “ x ` NpTq and
limnÑ8 Txn “ y. This means that there exists a sequence pznq in the zero-space of
T such that limnÑ8 }xn ´ x ` zn} “ 0 and such that limnÑ8 }Tpxn ` znq ´ y} “ 0.
Since T is continuous it follows that y “ Tx and so T is closed. Consequently the
operator S is closed. So, by the closed graph theorem, it is continuous. Hence there
exists a constant c with the property that
inf t}x ` z} : Tz “ 0u ď c }Tx} ,
for x P X. But the we have
T t}x} ă 1u Ě 1
c ty P Y : }y} ă 1u .
An easy exercise then shows that T is an open mapping in the sense that open
subsets of X are mapped onto open subsets of Y .
Altogether this completes the proof of Theorem 8.15, except that the implication
(a) ñ (b) has not been established yet. This is part of Theorem 8.19.
□
The fact that the Banach-Steinhaus theorem implies the closed graph theorem is part
of the following result. However for a concise formulation we need two deﬁnitions.
8.16. Definition. Let X be locally convex topological vector space. A subset W
of X is said to be a barrel if it is closed, balanced, convex and absorbing.
8.17. Definition. Let X and Y be topological vector spaces. A linear operator
T : X Ñ Y is said to be almost continuous if for every zero-neighborhood V in Y
the closure of T ´1V contains a zero-neighborhood in X.
8.18. Lemma. Let tpXU, }¨}q : U P Uu be a family of normed spaces.
The space
ℓ8pXU : U P Uq, deﬁned by
ℓ8pXU : U P Uq “
#
pxUqUPU P

UPU
XU : sup

}xU}U ă 8
+
,
is a normed vector space. If every space pXU, }¨}Uq, U P U is a Banach space, then
so is ℓ8 pXU, U P Uq.
Proof. The proof of this lemma is elementary. It is left to the reader as an
exercise.

8.19. Theorem. Let X be a locally convex vector space. The following assertions
are equivalent:
(a) Every barrel in X is a zero-neighborhood.
(b) A pointwise bounded family of continuous linear operators from X to any
locally convex topological vector space is equicontinuous.
(c) An everywhere deﬁned operator T deﬁned on all of X with values in a locally
convex topological vector space is almost continuous.
(d) A closed linear operator, that is everywhere deﬁned on X and with values
in a Fr´echet space, is continuous.
(e) A pointwise bounded family of continuous linear operators deﬁned on X
with values in a Banach-space is equicontinuous.
Proof. (a) ñ (b). Let Y be any locally convex space and let F be a pointwise
bounded family of continuous linear operators deﬁned on X and with values in Y .
Let V be a closed absolutely convex (= balanced and convex) neighborhood of the
origin in Y . Put W “ Ş
TPF T ´1V . The subset W is closed and absolutely convex.
Since the family F is pointwise bounded, W is also absorbing. So, by deﬁnition, W
is a barrel in X. So by (a) W is a neighborhood of the origin in X. This means
that the family F is equicontinuous.

Let Y be any locally convex vector space and let T : X Ñ Y be
an everywhere deﬁned linear operator. Let V be a absolutely convex closed zero-
neighborhood in Y and let W be the closure of T ´1V .
Then W is a barrel in
X. Denote by UXp0q the collection of all absolutely convex closed neighborhoods
of the origin in X.
Fix U P UXp0q and let GpU ` Wq be the largest subspace
contained in the set U ` W.
So that GpU ` Wq “ Ş8

Deﬁne
the vector space XU`W as follows: XU`W “ tλx : λ ě 0, x P U ` Wu {GpU ` Wq.
The space XU`W is equipped with the Minkowski functional of the union of cosets
U ` W ` GpU ` Wq “ Ť

}x ` GpU ` Wq}U`W “ inf tλ ą 0 : x P λpU ` Wqu .
This functional renders XU`W into a normed linear space. (Verify this precisely.)
Then let XU`W be the vector space deﬁned by

So a vector xU`W “ pxU ` GpU ` WqqUPUXp0q belongs to XU`W if and only if there
exists a natural number m with the property that xU belongs to m pU ` Wq for for
all U P UXp0q. It is a matter of routine to verify that XU`W is a vector space and
that the norm }xU`W}U`W, deﬁned by
}xU`W}U`W “ inf tλ ą 0 : xU P λ pU ` Wq , U P UXp0qu
turns
`
XU`W, }¨}U`W

into a normed vector space. Here, as above,
xU`W “ ppxU ` GpU ` WqqqUPUXp0q
is supposed to be a member of XU`W. In fact the normed space
`
XU`W, }¨}U`W

coincides with the ℓ8-sum of the spaces

U P UXp0q.
To be precise:

Deﬁne for U P UXp0q the operator TU : X Ñ XU`W as follows:
TUpxq “ p. . . , 0, . . . , 0, x ` GpU ` Wq, 0, . . . , 0, . . .q ,
x P X.
So only “site U is occupied” by the vector x ` GpU ` Wq. Since the unit ball of
XU`W is given by BXU`W “ ś
UPUXp0q pU ` W ` GpU ` Wqq, it follows that the set
T ´1
U BXU`W contains the set U. So every operator TU is continuous. Next ﬁx x P X.
Since the operator T is everywhere deﬁned, there exists a strictly positive number
λ “ λpxq ą 0 with the property that the vector Tx belongs to λV . Hence the vector
x belongs to λT ´1V Ď λW. Consequently the vectors TUpxq, U P UXp0q, belong
to λBXU`W . This means that the family tTU : U P UXp0qu is pointwise bounded.

From (b) it follows that the family tTU : U P UXp0qu is equicontinuous. This means
that the intersection

tx P X : x P U ` Wu “ W
belongs to UXp0q. This proves (c).
(c) ñ (d). Let Y be a Fr´echet space and let T : X Ñ Y be an almost continuous
linear operator with a closed graph. Let pVk : k “ 0, 1, 2, . . .q be a sequence of open
absolutely convex neighborhoods of 0 in Y with the property that Vk`1 ` Vk`1 is
contained in Vk, k “ 0, 1, 2, . . .. Also suppose that the sequence pVk : k P Nq consti-
tutes a local basis. We shall prove that the closure of T ´1V1 is contained in T ´1V0.
Since, by (c), the operator T is almost continuous, this shows that the set T ´1V0
contains the zero-neighborhood T ´1V1. Hence it will follow that T is continuous.
Pick x in the closure of T ´1V1. Since the operator T is almost continuous, it follows
that the closure of T ´1V1 is contained in T ´1V1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ` T ´1Vℓ` T ´1Vℓ`1. So, for
every ℓP N there exist vectors xj, 1 ď j ď ℓ` 1, such that Txj belongs to Vj,
1 ď j ď ℓ, and such that x ´ řℓ`1
j“1 xj belongs to the closure of T ´1Vℓ`1. It also
follows that the sequence of partial sums
´řℓ

is a Cauchy sequence.
Let y be its limit: y “ ř8
j“1 Txj. Next let U be any neighborhood in UXp0q. Then
the vector x ´ řℓ`1
j“1 xj belongs to T ´1Vℓ`1 ` U. Choose u P U with the property
that x ` u ´ řℓ`1
j`1 xj belongs to T ´1Vℓ`1. It readily follows that the vector

´ px, yq P U ˆ pVℓ`1 ` Vℓ`1q Ď U ˆ Vℓ.
This proves that the vector px, yq belongs to the closure of the graph of T. By
assumption the operator T is closed and hence the vector px, yq belongs to the
graph of T. So that y “ Tx. Since y belongs to V0, this proves that x belongs to
T ´1V0. Whence T ´1V1 Ď T ´1V0. Another application of the fact that the operator
T is almost continuous proves that the set T ´1V0 contains a neighborhood of the
origin in X. Since V0 was an arbitrary absolutely convex neighborhood in Y , this
proves that the operator T is continuous.
(d) ñ (e). Let Y be a Banach space and let F be pointwise bounded family of
continuous linear operators T deﬁned in X with taking values in Y . Let BpF, Y q
be the vector space of all functions f : F Ñ Y with the property that its norm }f},
deﬁned by }f}B “ supTPF }fpTq}, is ﬁnite. Supplied with this norm the vector space
BpF, Y q becomes a Banach space. Deﬁne the operator A : X Ñ BpF, Y q by AxpTq “
Tx, x P X, T P F. The operator A is a closed linear operator from X to BpF, Y q.
Its domain is all of X, because F is pointwise bounded. Assertion (d) implies that
the operator A is continuous. This means that there exists a neighborhood of the

}Tx} ď 1. This proves the implication (d) ñ (e).
(e) ñ (a). Let W be a barrel in X and construct the normed linear space XU`W as
in the proof of the implication (b) ñ (c). Also construct the family of continuous
linear operators tTU : U P UXp0qu as in the proof above. This family is pointwise
bounded and so by (e) it follows that it is equicontinuous. As in the proof of the
implication (b) ñ (c) it follows that W is a neighborhood of the origin in X. This
proves assertion (a).
This completes the proof of Theorem 8.19.
□
8.20. Definition. A locally convex vector space with the property that every barrel
in it is a neighborhood of the origin is called a barreled space.
From the previous theorem it follows that in a barreled space the closed graph
theorem holds and also that the Banach-Steinhaus theorem is valid. Next we are
going to prove that Fr´echet spaces are barreled. The result will be based on the
following proposition.

8.21. Proposition. Let X be a Fr´echet space and let F be a pointwise bounded
family of continuous linear operators from X to a topological vector space Y . Let
pxn : n P Nq be sequence in X that converges to 0. Then the collection
tTxn : T P F, n P Nu
is a bounded subset of Y .
Proof. Assume, to arrive at a contradiction, that the set
tTxn : T P F, n P Nu
is not bounded in Y . Then there exists a balanced neighborhood V of zero in Y
such that for every k P N there exists T P F together with nk P N with the property
that
Txnk R kV.
(8.3)
Put J “ tnk : k P Nu. Since, for every n P N, the set tTxn : T P Fu is bounded, the
set J is an inﬁnite subset of N. Since X is a Fr´echet space, there exists an inﬁnite
subset J1 of J with the property that the sum ř
jPJ2 xj “ limnÑ8
ř
jPJ2Xr1,ns xj
converges for every subset J2 of J1. This can be achieved in the following fashion.
The sequence tnk : k P Nu is inﬁnite and so the sequence pxnk : k P Nq contains a
subsequence that converges to 0. This is so because the original sequence pxn : n P Nq
converges to 0.
Since X is a Fr´echet space there exists a countable local basis
pUk : k P Nq with the property that Uk`1`Uk`1 Ď Uk. Choose a further subsequence
´
xnkj : j P N
¯
with the property that xnkj belongs to Uj. The set J1 “
␣
nkj : j P N
(
possesses the required property. Since the set V is balanced, it follows from (8.3)
that for each t P p0, 8q there exists T P F and n P J1 with the property that
Txn R tV.
(8.4)
From these observations we shall derive a contradiction. First choose a balanced
open zero-neighborhood V0 in Y with the property that
V0 ` V0 ` V0 Ď V.
(8.5)
Let rx0 be the zero-vector in X, put m0 “ 0, put ϵ0 “ 1 and let T0 : X Ñ Y be the
zero-map. We shall construct a sequence of positive real numbers pϵn : n P Nq, with
0 ă ϵn ď 1
n, n P N, a sequence of vectors prxn : n P Nq in X, a strictly increasing
sequence of indexes pmn : n P Nq Ď J1 together with a sequence pTn : n Pq in FYt0u,
such that for n ě 1 the following conditions are veriﬁed:
ϵnTn prxn´1q P V0,
piq
ϵkTk prxn ´ rxkq P V0,
0 ď k ď n ´ 1,
piiq

ϵnTn prxn ´ rxn´1q R V.
pivq
First we consider the case n “ 1. Since rx0 “ 0 and T0 “ 0, (i) and (ii) are always
satisﬁed. By (8.4) there exists an operator T1 P F and there exists m1 P J1 such

that T1 pxm1q R V . With rx1 “ xm1 and with ϵ1 “ 1 we have
ϵ1T1 prx1 ´ rx0q “ T1 pxm1q R V.
So the construction of ϵ1, rx1, m1 and T1 has been carried out. Next suppose that
pϵ1, . . . , ϵnq, px1, . . . , xnq, pm1, . . . , mnq and pT1, . . . , Tnq have been chosen in such a
way that (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are satisﬁed. Then we choose 0 ă ϵn`1 ď
1
n ` 1 in
such a way that
ϵn`1T prxnq P V0,
T P F.
(8.6)
Since the family F is pointwise bounded such a choice of ϵn`1 is possible. From (ii)
it follows that the set
nč
k“1
pV0 ´ ϵkTk prxn ´ rxkqq
is a zero-neighborhood in Y . Since limjÑ8,jPJ1 xj “ 0 and since each operator Tk,
1 ď k ď n, is continuous, it follows that there m1

n P N, with the property
that
ϵkTk pxmq P V0 ´ ϵkTk prxn ´ rxkq ,
m ě m1
n,
m P J1,
1 ď k ď n.
(8.7)
By (8.4) there exists a number mn`1 ě m1
n, mn`1 P J1, and Tn`1 P F such that
ϵn`1Tn`1

xmn`1

R V.
(8.8)
For assume that ϵn`1Tn`1 pxmq belongs to V for all m ě m1
n, m P J1, and let
tm P p0, 8q, 1 ď m ď m1
n ´ 1, m P J1, be such that Txm belongs to tmV for every
T P F. With
t “ max
ˆ 1
ϵn`1

␣
tm : 1 ď m ď m1
n´1, m P J1(˙
,
it follows that the set tTxm : T P F, m P J1u is a subset of tV . This contradicts
(8.4). Finally put
rxn`1 “ xmn`1 ` rxn.
(8.9)
Since mn`1 ě m1
n it follows from (8.7) that
ϵkTk prxn`1 ´ rxnq belongs to V0 ´ ϵkTk prxn ´ rxkq , for 1 ď k ď n.
So
ϵkTk prxn`1 ´ rxkq belongs to V0, for 1 ď k ď n.
(8.10)
From (8.6), (8.9), (8.8) and (8.10) it follows that the pn ` 1q-tuples pϵ1, . . . , ϵn`1q,
px1, . . . , xn`1q, pm1, . . . , mn`1q and pT1, . . . , Tn`1q satisfy (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) with
n replaced with n ` 1. From (iii) we see that rxn “ řn
k“1 xmk. Since pmk : k P Nq is
a subset of J1 we conclude that the vector rx :“ lim
nÑ8 rxn exists, because the space X
is complete. From (ii) together with the continuity of each operator Tk, k P N, it
follows that
ϵkTk prx ´ rxkq
belongs to V0,
k P N.
(8.11)
Since V0 “ ´V0 and since

we conclude from (i) and (8.11) that
ϵnTn prxn ´ rxn´1q
belongs to ϵnTn prxq ` V0 ` V0,
n P N.
(8.12)
Since the sequence pTn prxq : n P Nq is bounded and since limnÑ8 ϵn “ 0, it follows
from (8.12) that the vector ϵnTn prxn ´ rxn´1q belongs to V0 `V0 `V0 for n suﬃciently
large. Hence, by (8.5),
ϵnTn prxn ´ rxn´1q
belongs to V
(8.13)
for n suﬃciently large. However (8.13) contradicts (iv). Consequently the assump-
tion that the set tTxn : T P F, n P Nu be not bounded is false. This proves Propo-
sition 8.21.
□
The following corollary shows that a Fr´echet space is barreled. Consequently, the
Banach-Steinhaus theorem holds in Fr´echet spaces.
8.22. Corollary. A Fr´echet space is barreled.
Proof. Let X be Fr´echet space and let pUn : n P Nq be a local basis of zero-
neighborhoods. Let F be a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear operators
deﬁned on X and attaining values in a locally convex space Y . We have to prove
that the family F is equicontinuous. Suppose not. Then there exists a balanced
convex neighborhood V of the origin in Y with the property that for no n P N the
inclusion TUn Ď V is valid for all T P F. So for every n P N there exists an operator
Tn P F and a vector xn P Un such that the vector Tnxn does not belong to nV . Then
limnÑ8 xn “ 0 and so by the previous proposition the set tTxn : T P F, n P Nu is
bounded in Y . Hence there exists t ą 0 such that the following inclusion is valid:
tTxn : T P F, n P Nu Ď tV.
Since the set V is balanced we have, for n ą t, Tnxn P tV Ă nV . But on the other
hand Tnxn does not belong to nV . This is a contradiction. So our assumption that
the family F is not equicontinuous is false. Consequently a pointwise bounded family
of continuous linear operators deﬁned on a Fr´echet space and attaining values in a
locally convex space is equi-continuous. From the main theorem, Theorem 8.19, it
then follows that a Fr´echet space is barreled.
□
8.23. Example. Next we will give an example of a locally convex topological vector
space which is barreled, but which is not a Fr´echet space. Let Ωbe an open subset
of Rn, and let D pΩq be the space of all C8-functions whose support is a compact
subset of Ω. Let K Ă Ωbe a compact. As in the Chapters 1 and 4 we let DK
be space of all C8-functions in Ωwhose support is contained in K. Deﬁne the
semi-norms pm,K : DK Ñ r0, 8q, m P N, by

turns DK into a complete metric space. Let TK be the corresponding compatible
locally convex topology. That is to say the topological space pDK, TKq is a complete
metrizable locally convex Hausdorﬀspace. In other words it is a Fr¨echet space. A
subset W of D pΩq is called TΩ-open if W X DK is TK-open for all compact subsets
K of Ω. This topology TΩrenders D pΩq into a locally convex topological space in
which a sequence pφkqkPN Ă D pΩq converges to φ P D pΩq if and only this sequence
is contained in DK for some compact subset K of Ω, and converges in DK to φ.
Then the space pD pΩq , TΩq is barreled. However, it is not complete metrizable.
In fact the topology TΩis the strongest locally convex topology T on D pΩq with
the property that all inclusions pDK, TKq ãÑ pD pΩq , Tq, K Ă Ω, K compact, are
continuous.
Instead of taking all compact subsets K of Ω, it suﬃces to take a
sequence of compact subsets Km, m P N, such that Km is contained in the interior
of Km`1, and such that Ω“ YmKm.
The corresponding topology is called the
(strict) inductive limit of the family pDK, TKq. It is often denoted by

8.24. Theorem. Suppose
(a) X is a complete metrizable topological vector space;
(b) Y is a topological vector space;
(c) u : X Ñ Y is a continuous linear mapping;
(d) upXq is of the second category in Y .
Then the following assertions hold:
(i) upXq “ Y ;
(ii) upUq is open for every open subset U of X;
(iii) Y is complete metrizable.
The same conclusion holds provided that:
(a1) X is a complete metrizable locally convex topological vector space (i.e. a
Fr´echet space);
(b1) Y is a barreled locally convex topological vector space;
(c1) u : X Ñ Y is a continuous linear mapping;
(d1) upXq “ Y .
Proof. (ii) ñ (i). The open linear subspace upXq coincides with the whole
space.
(ii) ñ (iii). Put r
X “ X{Kerpuq; i.e.
r
X is the quotient space of X modulo the
zero space of u: Kerpuq “ tx P X : upxq “ 0u. The quotient space is also a complete
metrizable space and the mapping ru : r
X Ñ Y , deﬁned by ru px ` Kerpuqq “ upxq is
surjective and open. Consequently, it is a homeomorphism. If yn “ upxnq, n P N, is a
Cauchy sequence in Y , then xn`Kerpuq, n P N, is a Cauchy sequence in r
X. However,
the quotient space r
X inherits its completeness from X. Thus limnÑ xn ` Kerpuq
converges to x ` Kerpuq for some x P X. It follows that upynq “ ru pxn ` Kerpuqq
converges to y “ upxq. Consequently Y is complete. Let d be a translation invariant
distance on X, then dY py1, y2q :“ infzPKerpuq d px1 ` z, x2q, with y1 “ upx1q, y2 “
upx2q, deﬁnes a distance on Y . This distance is compatible with the topology.
(ii) Let V be a neighborhood of the origin in X. (If X is a Fr´echet space we may
and do assume that V is absolutely convex and closed.) We still have to prove
that upV q contains a neighborhood of the origin in Y . Let d be an invariant metric
on X, and choose r ą 0 so small that V0 deﬁned by V0 “ tx P X : dpx, 0q ă ru is
contained in V . Put Vn “ tx P X : dpx, 0q ă 2´nru. Since upXq “ Ť8
k“1 ku pVnq,
n P N, and since upXq is of the second category in Y it follows that the closure of
u pVnq is a neighborhood of the origin. In case upXq “ Y and Y is barreled the
closure of u pVnq contains a barrel, because Vn contains the closure of an absolutely
convex neighborhood of the origin in X. Consequently, u pVnq is a neighborhood of
the origin. We will show that there exists a neighborhood W of the origin in Y such

that
W Ď u pV1q Ď u pV0q Ď u pV q .
(8.14)
First we have
u pV1q Ě u pV2q ´ u pV2q Ě u pV2q ´ u pV2q Ě W,
where W is a neighborhood of the origin, because u pV2q has non-empty interior. This
proves the ﬁrst inclusion in (8.14). In order to prove the second inclusion we pick
y1 P u pV1q. Then y1´u pV2q is a neighborhood of y1. Consequently, it has non-empty
intersection with u pV1q, because y1 belongs to the closure of u pV1q. Hence, there
exists x1 P V1 such that upx1q P y1 ´ u pV2q. Put y2 “ y1 ´ upx1q. Then y2 P u pV2q.
By induction we ﬁnd yn P u pVnq and xn P Vn such that yn`1 :“ yn´u pxnq P u pVn`1q.
The latter is true because yn´u pVn`1q is a neighborhood of yn and yn belongs to the
closure of u pVnq. Thus yn ´ u pVn`1q has non-empty intersection with u pVnq. Then
the sequence of partial sums řn
j“1 xj, n P N, is a Cauchy sequence in X. It converges
to x say. Then, since d px1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ` xn, 0q ď řn
j“1 d pxj, 0q ă řn
j“1 2´jr ď r, we see
that dpx, 0q “ limnÑ8 d

V0 Ď V . Moreover,

(8.15)
Since yn belongs to the closure of u pVnq, and since u is continuous and the sequence
Vn, n P N, is a basis of neighborhoods of the origin in X, we see that yn`1 converges
to 0 in Y . (Let U be a closed neighborhood of the origin in Y . Choose n so large
that u pVnq Ď U. Since U is closed, the closure of u pVnq is also contained in U.) It
follows that
y1 “ lim

So the proof of Theorem 8.24 is complete now.

2.2. Krein-Smulian and the Eberlein-Smulian theorem. In this subsec-
tion we will discuss two interesting results in Banach space theory. Similar results
also exist for Frecehet spaces and even for locally convex spaces, e.g., see Schae-
fer. We next go over the proofs of two fundamental results in Banach space theory,
elucidating the weak˚-topology and the weak topology, respectively. We follow Sec-
tion 1.2, Some facts from functional analysis, in [1]. The text of Aaserub in turn
is based on parts from Conway’s book [27], and on Robert Whitley’s paper [153].
We will also quote some results from [118]. We begin with the result of Krein-
Smulian, the proof of which requires the use of the following two lemmas.
We
will use the notation B˝ “ tx˚ P X˚ : |⟨b, x˚⟩| ď 1 for all b P Bu, for B Ă X, and
Xs “ tx P X : }x} ď su “ sX1, for s ą 0, with pX˚qs deﬁned similarly. Here B˝ is
called the polar of B.

If x˚ P Ez pX˚qr, then |⟨x, x˚⟩| ą r for some x P X with }x} “ 1 so that

Put Q “ pX˚qn`1 X Şn´1
k“0 F ˝
k X A. As Q is clearly weak˚-closed and is contained
in the weak˚-compact set pn ` 1q pX˚q1, Q is weak˚-compact.
Suppose now for
contradiction that Q X F ˝ ‰ H for all ﬁnite sets F Ă X1{n. Note that the collection
tQ X F ˝ : F P Fnu consists of non-empty weak˚-closed sets. We claim that it has
the ﬁnite intersection property, i.e., that any ﬁnite subcollection has non-empty
intersection. Indeed, if we take Q X G˝

that

As Q is weak˚-compact, it follows that H ‰ Ş

Thus we can take a ﬁnite set Fn Ă X1{n such that Q X F ˝

n“1 Fn
is a countable set, which we enumerate as txnu8
n“1. It is immediate from (i) that
xn Ñ 0 in norm when n Ñ 8. Thus we may deﬁne a linear map T : X˚ Ñ c0
by x˚ ÞÑ p⟨xn, x˚⟩q8
n“1, where c0 is the Banach space of complex sequences that
converge to 0, equipped with the supremum-norm.
Note next that A X Ş8

contradicting (ii). Thus }T px˚q} “ supn |⟨xn, x˚⟩| ą 1 for all x˚ P A. It follows that
the convex sets TpAq and D, the open unit ball of c0, are disjoint. Thus the Hahn-
Banach separation theorem implies that there is some f P ℓ1 “ pc0q˚ and α P R
such that ℜfpφq ă α ď ℜf pT px˚qq for all x˚ P A and all φ P D. Without loss of
generality, we may assume that }f}1 “ 1. If φ P D, then |fpφq| “ ℜf pωφq ď α

now.

We have now essentially proved the Krein-Smulian theorem in Banach spaces.
8.27. Theorem. (Krein-Smulian) Let X be a Banach space and A Ă X˚ a convex
set such that A X pX˚qr is weak˚-closed for every r ą 0. Then A is weak˚-closed.
Proof. An analogue of the theorem for norm-closure is trivially true (as every
norm-convergent sequence is bounded). In particular, A is norm-closed. We will
show that X˚zA Ă X˚zB, where B is the weak˚-closure of A. Let x˚
0 P X˚zA be
given. As A is norm-closed, we can ﬁnd r ą 0 such that Br px˚
0q X A “ H. Thus
p1{rq pA ´ x˚
0qXpX˚q1 “ H, because translations and dilations are bijections of X˚.
By the previous lemma, there exists x P X such that p1{rq ℜpx˚ ´ x˚
0q pxq ě 1 for
all x˚ P A. Thus x˚
0 is not in the weak˚-closure of A, which completes the proof of
Theorem 8.27.

Proof. It is clear that d is a metric on X. Let K be weakly compact. Then,
as each f P X˚ is weakly continuous, supxPK |fpxq| ă 8 for each f P X˚ by the
compactness of K.
Thus the Uniform Boundedness Principle implies that C “
supxPK }x} ă 8, i.e., that K is norm-bounded. We claim that the identity map on
K is continuous when the domain is equipped with the weak topology and the range
is equipped with the topology generated by d. If this is true, the identity map is
automatically a homeomorphism, which proves what we want. Let xα Ñ x weakly

The following theorem is a consequence of Theorem 8.27. The theorem of Krein-
Smulian (see Theorem 6.4 Corollary in [119]), or Grothendieck (see Corollary 2
to Theorem 6.2 in [119]) plays a dominant role in the proof of Theorem 8.30.
Let pX, }¨}q be Banach space. By deﬁnition a sequence px˚
nqnPN Ă X˚ belongs to
c0 pN, X˚q if limnÑ8 ⟨x, x˚
n⟩“ 0 for every x P X.
8.30. Theorem. Let X be a separable Banach space, and let f : X˚ Ñ C be a linear
functional. Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(a) There exists x P X such that f px˚q “ ⟨x, x˚⟩for all x˚ P X˚;
(b) For every sequence px˚
nqnPN P c0 pN, X˚q the following inequalities hold:
0 ď sup
nPN ℜf px˚
nq ă 8.

Elements of functional analysis
(c) For every sequence px˚
nqnPN P c0 pN, X˚q the following inequalities hold:
0 ď lim sup
nÑ8 ℜf px˚
nq ă 8.
Proof of Theorem 8.30. (a) ùñ (b) A sequence in c0 pN, X˚q is bounded
with respect to the norm in X˚; this is a consequence of e.g. the Banach-Steinhaus
theorem. It is also a consequence of a Baire-category argument applied to the dual
unit ball. Hence assertion (b) follows from (a).
(b) ùñ (c) Let px˚
nqnPN be any sequence in c0 pN, X˚q. Then px˚
kqkPN,kěn is a sequence
in c0 pN, X˚q, and so, by (b), 0 ď sup
kěn ℜf px˚
kq ă 8, from which assertion (c) readily
follows.
(c) ùñ (a) In this implication we will employ the Krein-Smulian theorem, or
Grothendieck’s completeness result.
So suppose that (c) holds, and let py˚
nqnPN
be any sequence in X˚ which converges in weak˚-sense to y˚ P X˚. By (c) we see
0 ď lim supnÑ8 ℜf py˚
n ´ y˚q ă 8, and hence
ℜf py˚q ď lim sup
nÑ8 ℜf py˚
nq ă 8.
(8.16)
From (8.16) it follows that for every M P N and every α P R the subset
tx˚ P X˚ : }x˚} ď M, ℜf px˚q ď αu
(8.17)
is sequentially weak˚-closed. Since X is separable, and the set in (8.17) is equi-
continuous, it follows that sets of the form (8.17) are weak˚-closed, not just se-
quentially weak˚-closed. From Krein-Smulian’s theorem it follows that for every
α P R the half-space tx˚ P X˚ : ℜf px˚q ď αu is weak˚-closed. It then follows that
the real hyper-plane tx˚ P X˚ : ℜf px˚q “ 0u is weak˚-closed. Consequently, since
f : X˚ Ñ C is complex linear, there exists a vector x P X such that f px˚q “ ⟨x, x˚⟩,
x˚ P X˚.
We can also use Grothendieck’s theorem. Then we proceed as follows. Instead of
considering a set of the form (8.17) we look at the subset HM,α deﬁned by
HM,α “ tx˚ P X˚ : }x˚} ď M, f px˚q “ αu .
(8.18)
Then the set in (8.18) is sequentially weak˚-closed. Let px˚
nqnPN be a sequence in
HM,α which converges to x˚ P X˚ in weak˚-sense. Then, by (c),
ℜf px˚q ď lim sup
nÑ8 ℜf px˚
nq “ lim sup
nÑ8 ℜα “ ℜα.
(8.19)
Applying the same argument to the sequence p´x˚
nqnPN which converges in weak˚-
sense to ´x˚ shows f p´x˚q ď ´α. This in combination with (8.19) yields ℜf px˚q “
α. The same argument can applied to the sequences pix˚
nqnPN and to p´ix˚
nqnPN.
Consequently the subset HM,α is sequentially weak˚-closed. Since the space is sep-
arable and the set HM,α is equi-continuous it follows that HM,α is weak˚-closed.
Grothendieck’s theorem then implies that the hyper-plane tx˚ P X˚ : f px˚q “ αu is
weak˚-closed. Again it follows that there exists x P X such that f px˚q “ ⟨x, x˚⟩,
x˚ P X˚.

8.31. Theorem. (Eberlein-Smulian) Let A be a subset of a Banach space X. Then
the following assertions are equivalent:
(1) A is relatively weakly compact;
(2) Any sequence in A has a weakly convergent subsequence;
(3) Any sequence in A has a weak cluster point.
Proof. (1) ñ (2): Let tanu8
n“1 be a sequence in A. Denote by X0 the norm-
closure of the span of the an. It is easy to see that X0 is separable and that AXX0 is
a relatively weakly closed subset of X0. Indeed, the weak topology on X0 coincides
with the restriction to X0 of the weak topology on X. (Alternatively, one can note
that X0 is actually a weakly closed subspace of X. In either case, we apply the
Hahn-Banach theorem.) By the preceding lemmas, the weak topology on A X X0 is
metrizable. Thus any sequence in A X X0 has a weakly convergent subsequence. In
particular, so does tanu8
n“1.
(2) ñ (3) This implication is trivial.

(3) ñ (1) Assume that A satisﬁes (3). We claim that A must be norm-bounded.
Indeed, for each x˚ P X˚, the set t⟨x, x˚⟩: x P Au is bounded in C.
This is a
consequence of (3). As above, it follows from the uniform boundedness principle
that A is norm-bounded.
Denote by J the canonical embedding X Ñ X˚˚.
It
suﬃces to show that the weak˚-closure B of JpAq, which is weak˚-compact by the
Banach-Alaoglu theorem and the previous paragraph, is contained in JpXq. Let
now x˚˚ P B be given. We will use compactness to construct a sequence tanu8
n“1 in
A such that, if x P X is any weak cluster point of this sequence, x˚˚ “ Jpxq. This
will then complete the proof.
We need the following remark. Suppose Y is a Banach space and F is a ﬁnite-
dimensional subspace of Y ˚. Then the unit sphere of F is compact in F equipped
with the norm inherited from Y ˚. Thus we can ﬁnd a 1{4-net y˚

unit sphere of F, i.e., a set such that for every y˚ P F with }y˚} “ 1 there is
a 1 ď j ď n such that

Choose next, using the fact that x˚˚ P B, ak P A such that |rx˚˚ ´ Jaks px˚

n“1. By the
Hahn-Banach theorem, x is contained in the norm-closed convex linear span of the
sequence tanunPN. As J is an isometry (by the Hahn-Banach theorem), it follows
that x˚˚ ´ Jpxq belongs to the norm-closed linear span of the vectors x˚˚ ´ Jan,
n “ 1, 2, . . .. It follows from (ii) above that sup t|y˚˚ px˚

implies that
sup t|y˚˚ px˚

for all y˚˚ P span tx˚˚, x˚˚ ´ Ja1, x˚˚ ´ Ja2, . . .u. In particular, we may take y˚˚ “
x˚˚ ´ Jx.
Fix m.
Given N ą m there exists n ą npNq ě N ą m such that
|x˚

|rx˚˚ ´ Jxs px˚

Letting N tend to 8, we get that |rx˚˚ ´ Jxs px˚

Altogether, this completes the proof of Theorem 8.31.

Here the topology σ pX˚, Xq is the weakest locally convex topology on X˚ which
makes all functionals of the form x˚ ÞÑ ⟨x, x˚⟩, x˚ P X˚, where x varies over X,
continuous. Of course, this topology is called the weak˚-topology. The following
theorem is a version of the Krein-Smulian theorem for metrizable locally convex
spaces.

Partial differential equations and operators

Elements of functional analysis
Subjects for further research and presentations
The following topics may be of interest for a presentation and/or further research:
(1) Detailed treatment of the wave equation. A text can be found in Chapter
3. The wave equation is based on the operator B2
Bt2 ´ ∆. For a connection
with unitary semigroups see Subsection 2.5.
(2) Pseudo-diﬀerential operators of general order. For details see, e.g., Tr`eves
[137]. An operator of the form
Ppx, Dqupxq “
1
p2πqn
ż
Rn
ż
Rn eipx´yq¨ξPpx, ξqupyq dy dξ,
where the function Ppx, ξq is an appropriate function, is called a pseudo-
diﬀerential operator. The integrand belongs to a certain symbol class. For
instance, if Ppx, ξq is an inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable function on Rn ˆ Rn with
the property that
ˇˇDα
ξ Dβ
xPpx, ξq
ˇˇ ď Cα,β p1 ` |ξ|qm´|α|
for all x, ξ P Rn, all multi-indices α, β. some constants Cα,β and some real
number m, then P belongs to the symbol class Sm
1,0 of H¨ormander. The
corresponding operator Ppx, Dq is called a pseudo-diﬀerential operator of
order m and belongs to the class Ψm
1,0.
(3) Certain pseudo-diﬀerential operators of order less than or equal to 2 can
be put into correspondence with space-homogeneous or non-space-homo-
geneous Markov processes. A detailed exposition can be found in Jacob
[68, 69, 70].
(4) Non-linear partial diﬀerential operators:
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann
equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the Euler-Lagrange equation, the
Korteweg-Devries equation. A good reference for some of these topics is
Evans [49]. Some of these equations are (closely) related to optimization
problems: see e.g. [13].
(5) Viscosity solutions to partial diﬀerential equations. The standard reference
for this subject is Crandall, Ishii, and Lions [29].
This topic can also
be treated in the context of Backward Stochastic Diﬀerential Equations
(BSDEs): see, e.g., Pardoux [95].
(6) Stationary phase methods for Fourier integral operators. For this topic the
reader is referred to Simon [105]. The books [109], [108], and [107] by
the same authors are also quite interesting. An important related topic
is the notion of wavefront set in connection with the singular support of a
distribution. The text in [130] authored by Hansen, Hilgert, and Paravicini
contains relevant material.
(7) General diﬀerential operators of elliptic type. An important role is played
by Sobolev theory. Some of these operators generate analytic semigroups.
The reader may consult Chazarain and Piriou [25], Folland [51], H¨ormander

[63, 64, 65, 66], Strichartz [134]. For connection with regularity properties
and analytic semigroups the reader is referred to, e.g., Pr¨uss [103], Pr¨uss
and Simonett [104], or Lunardi [86].
(8) Elliptic diﬀerential operators of second order (and Markov processes); see,
e.g., Øksendael [138].
(9) Parabolic diﬀerential operators (of second order and Markov processes). An
interesting article in this context is [23]. The abstract of this paper reads:
“We present the main concepts of the theory of Markov processes: tran-
sition semigroups, Feller processes, inﬁnitesimal generator, Kolmogorov’s
backward and forward equations, and Feller diﬀusion. We also give sev-
eral classical examples including stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs)
and backward stochastic diﬀerential equations (BSDEs) and describe the
links between Markov processes and parabolic partial diﬀerential equations
(PDEs). In particular, we state the Feynman-Kac formula for linear PDEs
and BSDEs, and we give some examples of the correspondence between
stochastic control problems and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations
and between optimal stopping problems and variational inequalities. Sev-
eral examples of ﬁnancial applications are given to illustrate each of these
results, including European options, Asian options, and American put op-
tions.”

Partial differential equations and operators
372 
Elements of functional analysis
(10) Diﬀerential operators and boundary value problems. A recent book on this
topic is Pinsky [98]. Several books on partial diﬀerential equations contain
a chapter on boundary value problems, e.g., see [110]. For a more applied
version of this topic see, e.g., [6]. A modern book with excellent critics is
[123] written by Shaurer and Levy.
(11) Operator semigroups and diﬀerential operators in Banach space; see Chap-
ter 6 in this book. Other texts can be found in [33], [48], [139].
(12) Solutions to stochastic diﬀerential equations and the corresponding sec-
ond order diﬀerential equation (of parabolic type) satisﬁed by the one-
dimensional distributions.
(13) Backward stochastic diﬀerential equations and their viscosity solutions; see,
e.g. Pardoux [95].
(14) The equation of Rudin-Osher. A relevant book on this topic is [93] written
by Jean-Michel Morel and Sergio Solimini. A related equation, the equation
of Perona-Malik, is discussed in Otmar Scherzer [120]. From the description
of this book we quote “The Handbook of Mathematical Methods in Imaging
provides a comprehensive treatment of the mathematical techniques used in
imaging science. The material is grouped into two central themes, namely,
Inverse Problems (Algorithmic Reconstruction) and Signal and Image Pro-
cessing. Each section within the themes covers applications (modeling),
mathematics, numerical methods (using a case example) and open ques-
tions. Written by experts in the area, the presentation is mathematically
rigorous. The entries are cross-referenced for easy navigation through con-
nected topics. Available in both print and electronic forms, the handbook
is enhanced by more than 150 illustrations and an extended bibliography.
It will beneﬁt students, scientists and researchers in applied mathematics.
Engineers and computer scientists working in imaging will also ﬁnd this
handbook useful.” Other related work is Grasmair and Lenzen [58]
(15) Heat equation on a Riemannian manifold. A relevant book in this context
is [59]. For connections with stochastic diﬀerential equations on manifolds
see, e.g., Elworthy [45, 46].
(16) Interpolation theorems: Riesz-Thorin, Stein, Marcinkiewicz, and others.
An interesting book is [78]. In the abstract, the author Mark Kim writes
“This expository thesis contains a study of four interpolation theorems, the
requisite background material, and a few applications. The materials in-
troduced in the ﬁrst three sections of Chapter 1 are used to motivate and
prove the Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem and its extension by Stein,
both of which are presented in the fourth section. Chapter 2 revolves around
Calder´on’s complex method of interpolation and the interpolation theorem
of Feﬀerman and Stein, with the material in between providing the nec-
essary examples and tools. The two theorems are then applied to a brief
study of linear partial diﬀerential equations, Sobolev spaces, and Fourier
integral operators, presented in the last section of the second chapter.” A

rather recent book on interpolation is [88]. For abstract interpolation re-
sults see e.g., Voigt [148, 149]. Another text containing material about
interpolation is Lunardi [87].
(17) Oscillatory integrals and related path integrals. There is a lot of literature
on this subject. Nice papers on this topic are [2, 3]. Interesting books are,
e.g., Mazzucchi [91], Johnson and Lapidus [72], and Kleinert [79].
(18) Eigenvalue problems and spectral theory. A possible reference for this topic
is Gilbarg and Trudinger [54]. There are several other references for this
kind of subject.

74. Shmuel Kantorovitz, Topics in operator semigroups, Progress in Mathematics, vol. 281,
Birkh¨auser Boston Inc., Boston, MA, 2010, This monograph is concerned with the inter-
play between the theory of operator semigroups and spectral theory. The basics on operator
semigroups are concisely covered in this self-contained text. Part I deals with the Hille-Yosida
and Lumer-Phillips characterizations of semigroup generators, the Trotter-Kato approxima-
tion theorem, Kato’s uniﬁed treatment of the exponential formula and the Trotter product
formula, the Hille-Phillips perturbation theorem, and Stone’s representation of unitary semi-
groups. Part II explores generalizations of spectral theory’s connection to operator semigroups.

80. Heinz K¨onig, Measure and Integration: An advanced course in basic procedures and applica-
tions, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Springer, Berlin-Heidelberg, November 14 2011, This
book aims at restructuring some fundamentals in measure and integration theory. It centers
around the ubiquitous task to produce appropriate contents and measures from more prim-
itive data like elementary contents and elementary integrals. It develops the new approach
started around 1970 by Topsoe and others into a systematic theory. The theory is much more
powerful than the traditional means and has striking implications all over measure theory
and beyond.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!
