Implicatures
▶The philosopher Paul Grice (1913-1988)

Implicatures
▶The philosopher Paul Grice (1913-1988)
proposed a theory of conversational implicatures
▶An implicature is something that we mean or
imply or suggest by way of saying something else.

▶When you know basic logic, you can get a
good understanding of how implicature
works, and the diﬀerent ways we can say
what we mean.

what the speaker means,
but not part of what is
said.

How Do Implicatures Work?
The Cooperative Principle:
.
.
Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at
the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or
direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged
note: Neither the cooperative principle nor the ‘maxims’ which
unpack it are to be taken prescriptively. They are not rules we are
exhorted to follow.

Grice’s Maxims: Quality
.
.
Try to make your contribution one that is
true.
1. Do not say what you believe to be false.
2. Do not say that for which you lack
adequate evidence.

Grice’s Maxims: Quantity
.
.
Say what you need to, but no more.
1. Make your contribution as informative
as is required (for the current purposes
of the exchange).
2. Do not make your contribution more
informative than is required.

Grice’s Maxims: Relation (or Relevance)
.
.
Be relevant.
1. Contribute to the topic at hand.
2. Don’t change topic arbitrarily.

Gricean Maxims: Manner
.
.
Be eﬃcient in what you say:
1. Avoid obscurity of expression.
2. Avoid ambiguity.
3. Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity).
4. Be orderly.
