Authors’ Acknowledgments
Julie Adair King: I am extremely grateful to the team of talented profession-
als at John Wiley and Sons for all their efforts in putting together this book. 
Special thanks go to my awesome project editor, Kim Darosett, who is the 
type of editor that all authors hope for but rarely experience: supportive, 
skilled, and amazingly calm in the face of any storm, including my not infre-
quent freakouts.
I also owe much to the rest of the folks in both the editorial and art depart-
ments, especially Heidi Unger, Rashell Smith, Shelley Lea, Steve Hayes, Andy 
Cummings, and Mary Bednarek. Thanks, too, to agent extraordinaire, Margot 
Maley Hutchison, for her continuing help and encouragement and to technical 
editor Dave Hall for his eagle-eyed observations and thoughtful suggestions.
Serge Timacheff: Many thanks to David Hall for being a sounding board and 
on-call expert in a variety of digital photography issues, to Margot Hutchison 
for being a fabulous agent, and to Kim Darosett for being the ever-patient 
editor wrangling two authors at once.

Digital Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition 

Introduction
I
t’s official: Digital photography is no longer considered a fleeting fad or 
solely a game for techno-types. Today, everyone from preteens to great-
grandmothers is recording their memories with digital cameras, abandoning 
their old film models to the attic, the basement, or worse.
This growing enthusiasm for digital photography is for good reason, too. The 
features and quality packed into today’s digital cameras are nothing short of 
astounding. Tiny, fit-in-your pocket cameras are now capable of producing 
images that, in some cases, surpass those of professional models from five or 
six years ago — and at prices that were unheard of in years past. Digital SLR 
models, which accept interchangeable lenses, are now remarkably inexpen-
sive, too, making the step up to semi-pro features much more accessible to 
enthusiastic shutterbugs. 
For many people, though, figuring out how to use all the features offered by 
today’s cameras, let alone how to download, organize, and share digital photos, 
is an intimidating proposition. First you have to deal with all the traditional 
photography lingo — f-stop, shutter speed, depth of field — and on top of that, 
you then have to decode a slew of digital buzzwords. Just what is a megapixel, 
anyway? If your professional photographer friend keeps talking about “shooting 
Raw,” does that mean that you should do the same — whatever it is?
Digital Photography For Dummies answers all these questions and countless 
more. As did the first five editions of this book, this brand spankin’ new, 
sixth edition takes you by the hand and helps you get up to speed with all the 
latest digital photography tools, tricks, and techniques. In easy-to-understand 
language, with a dash of humor thrown in to make things more enjoyable, 
this book spells out everything you need to know to make the most of your 
digital camera. Whether you’re taking pictures for fun, for work, or a little bit 
of both, you’ll find answers, ideas, and solutions in the pages to come.
What’s in This Book?
Digital Photography For Dummies covers all aspects of digital photography. It 
helps you assess your current digital photography needs, determine the best 
gear and products to suit your style, and learn how to combine the newest 
digital innovations with tried-and-true photography techniques. In addition, 
this book explains what happens after you get the shot, detailing the steps 
you need to take to download and organize your picture files, produce great 
prints to hang on the living room wall, and share your favorite images online. 
Here’s just a little preview of what you can find in each part of the book.

2
Digital Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition 
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder
This part helps you stock your camera bag with the right equipment for the 
type of photography that interests you and then gets you started on your 
picture-taking adventures.
 
✓ Chapter 1 provides an overview of the latest and greatest camera fea-
tures, explaining how they affect your pictures and your photography 
options.
 
✓ Chapter 2 introduces you to some cool (and useful) camera accessories, 
picture-storage products, and computer software that enables you to 
do everything from retouching your pictures to making them look like 
watercolor paintings.
 
✓ Chapter 3 gets you up and running, guiding you through camera setup 
and showing you how to take best advantage of the automatic picture-
taking modes found on most cameras.
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera
You’re embarking on what will hopefully be a long and fruitful relationship 
with your new camera. To do so, you’ll want to spend some time understand-
ing how it works and thinks, and know when (and how) to step in to help it 
do its job better. That’s what this part helps you accomplish.
 
✓ Chapter 4 explains the critical technical aspects of digital photography, 
but in plain language that even your Aunt Tillie could understand.
 
✓ Chapter 5 covers exposure, explaining fundamentals such as f-stops, 
shutter speeds, and ISO, and offering tips on using flash and other light-
ing options.
 
✓ Chapter 6 introduces focus techniques that can help you add drama to 
your pictures and also looks at options that enable you to control color.
 
✓ Chapter 7 wraps up this part with a summary of the best settings and 
techniques to use for specific types of pictures, from portraits to land-
scapes to action shots. 
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond
After you fill up your camera with photos, you need to get them off the 
camera and out into the world. The chapters in this part show you how.
 
✓ Chapter 8 explains the process of transferring pictures to your computer 
and also discusses ways to organize all those images.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Chapter 9 provides step-by-step instructions for using your photo soft-
ware to repair common picture problems, such as red-eye.
 
✓ Chapter 10 gives you a thorough review of your printing options, includ-
ing information about different types of photo printers.
 
✓ Chapter 11 looks at ways to display and distribute images electronically — 
placing them on Web pages and attaching them to e-mail messages, for 
example.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Information in this part is presented in easily digestible, bite-sized nuggets.
 
✓ Chapter 12 offers ten easy ways to instantly improve your digital photos.
 
✓ Chapter 13 lists ten great Web sites where you can find equipment 
reviews, chat with other digital photographers, and more.
 
✓ Chapter 14 describes ten critical steps you should take to protect and 
maintain your gear — and also offers advice about what to do if disaster 
strikes.
Appendixes
As you probably have already discovered, the digital photography world is 
very fond of jargon. Terms and acronyms you need to know are explained 
throughout the book, but if you need a quick reminder of what a certain word 
means, head for the glossary, where you can find quick translations from 
geek-speak to everyday language. Following the glossary, an Online Resource 
Guide provides a listing of all the Web sites mentioned throughout the book. 
Icons Used in This Book
Like other books in the For Dummies series, this book uses icons to flag espe-
cially important information. Here’s a quick guide to the icons used in Digital 
Photography For Dummies:
 
This icon represents information that you should commit to memory. Doing 
so can make your life easier and less stressful.
 
Text marked with this icon breaks technical gobbledygook down into plain 
English. In many cases, you really don’t need to know this stuff, but boy, will 
you sound impressive if you repeat it at a party.

4
Digital Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition 
 
The Tip icon points you to shortcuts that help you avoid doing more work 
than necessary. This icon also highlights ideas for creating better pictures 
and working around common digital photography problems.
 
When you see this icon, pay attention — danger is on the horizon. Read the 
text next to a Warning icon to keep yourself out of trouble and to find out 
how to fix things if you leaped before you looked.
 
In sections of the book that discuss photo retouching, steps and figures fea-
ture Adobe Photoshop Elements 6.0, the leading program of its type. This 
icon marks information specific to that program. But if you’re using other 
software (or another version of Elements), rest assured that you can easily 
adapt the steps and general advice to your program, so don’t skip para-
graphs marked with this icon.
Note that although most figures feature the Windows version of Elements, 
things work just the same in the Macintosh version unless specifically stated 
otherwise.
Conventions Used in This Book
In addition to icons, Digital Photography For Dummies follows a few other con-
ventions. When you need to choose a command from a program menu, you 
see the menu name, an arrow, and then the command name. For example, 
if you need to choose the Print command from the File menu, you see this 
instruction: Choose File➪Print.
Sometimes, you can choose a command more quickly by pressing keys on 
your keyboard than by clicking through menus. These keyboard shortcuts 
are presented like so: Press Ctrl+A. This simply means press the Ctrl key and 
the A key at the same time, and then let up on both keys. When shortcuts 
differ depending on whether you’re a Windows or Mac user, the PC shortcut 
appears first, followed by the Mac shortcut.
What Do I Read First?
The answer depends on you. You can start with Chapter 1 and read straight 
through to the index, if you like. Or you can flip to whatever section of the 
book interests you most and start there.

5
 Introduction
Digital Photography For Dummies is designed so that you can grasp the con-
tent in any chapter without having to read the chapters that came before it. 
So if you need information on a particular topic, you can get in and out as 
quickly as possible.
The one thing this book isn’t designed to do, however, is insert its contents 
magically into your head. You can’t just put the book on your desk or under 
your pillow and expect to acquire the information by osmosis — you have to 
put eyes to page and do some actual reading.
With our hectic lives, finding the time and energy to read is always easier 
said than done. But if you spend just a few minutes a day with this book, you 
can increase your digital photography skills tenfold. Heck, maybe even elev-
enfold or twelvefold. Suffice it to say that you’ll soon be able to capture any 
subject, from a newborn baby to an urban landscape, like a pro — and have a 
lot of fun along the way.

Digital Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition 

Part I
Peering Through 
the Digital 
Viewfinder

In this part . . .
T
he past few years have seen an explosion of 
new digital photography tools — new cam-
eras, new software, tons of gadgets and accesso-
ries, and gaggles of features, all coming at you like 
a tidal wave of technology. And that can be pretty 
darned intimidating, even for professional photog-
raphers. What’s a regular person to do? Read this 
part of the book, that’s what.
Chapter 1 helps you determine what camera fea-
tures you need for the type of photography you’d 
like to pursue, and Chapter 2 introduces you to 
some accessories that can make your photogra-
phy easier, more fun, or both. As you no doubt 
already know, there’s a considerable amount to 
ponder before you head to the checkout lane, but 
these two chapters should help you sort every-
thing out.
When you’re ready to start shooting, Chapter 3 
guides you through setting up your camera and 
taking your ﬁ rst pictures. It also introduces you to 
automatic shooting modes that simplify getting 
great results when you take certain types of 
 pictures — portraits, landscapes, and so on.

P
erhaps you picked up this book because you’re finally ready to 
part with your film camera and join the digital photogra-
phy ranks. Or, if you’re like a lot of people, you might be 
considering putting your first (or even second) digital 
camera into mothballs and finding a snazzier model. 
Either way, the news is all good: Today’s digital 
cameras offer an amazing array of features and top-
notch picture quality at prices far below what you 
would have paid even a year ago.
Now that there are so many high-quality cameras 
from which to choose, however, it can be tough fig-
uring out which one is best-suited to your needs. To 
help you make sense of all your options, this chapter 
provides an overview of the current digital photogra-
phy scene, discussing what’s new and noteworthy and 
offering some advice on matching camera features to the 
types of pictures you like to take. In addition, this chapter 
provides some insights on outfitting the rest of your digital photog-
raphy studio, describing the computer hardware you need to store, organize, 
and edit your digital photos.
 
Later chapters get into much more detail about many of the features intro-
duced here. So if you have a burning question that’s not answered by this 
overview, flip to the index to find where to look for more information.

Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
The Savvy Shopper’s Camera Guide
In a fervent battle for your camera-buying dollar, each manufacturer tries to 
outdo the other by adding some hot new option that promises to make your 
picture-taking life easier, more fun, or more rewarding. All the new bells and 
whistles might appeal to your impulse-buying tendencies, but whether you 
need them depends on how you want to use your camera.
So that you can better understand which options are essential and which 
ones you can do without, the next sections review the most common (and 
most critical) features offered by the current crop of digital cameras, along 
with a few specialty options that may be of interest depending on your 
photographic interests.
Design options: Point-and-shoot or SLR?
Before digging into spe-
cific camera features, it 
helps to review the two 
basic design types of dig-
ital cameras: compact, 
point-and-shoot models 
like the one in Figure 1-1 
and digital SLR models 
like the one in Figure 1-2.
 
Digital SLR models are 
often called dSLRs. The 
acronym SLR, by the 
way, means single-lens 
reflex and refers to some 
internal mechanisms 
used by this type of 
camera. Delving deeper 
into that bit of business 
isn’t critical; the important thing to know is that SLR cameras enable you to 
swap lenses. You can use a wide-angle lens for your travel photography, for 
example, and switch to a close-up lens for pictures of flowers and other small 
subjects. Point-and-shoot models do not offer this flexibility.
Both types of cameras have their pros and cons:
 
✓ dSLRs: These models offer the greatest degree of creative control, not 
only because you can swap out lenses but also because you get advanced 
options for manipulating exposure, focus, and color not found in most 
point-and-shoot models. And dSLRs do tend to be a cut above in the qual-
ity arena because they tend to have larger image sensors, although many 
point-and-shoot models also produce excellent images. (See the upcoming 
Sony Corporation of America
Figure 1-1: Many point-and-shoot digital cameras offer 
surprising power in a small package.

11
 Chapter 1: Gearing Up: Does Your Equipment Fit Your Needs?
sidebar “All pixels are 
not created equal” for 
an explanation of how 
the size of the image 
sensor affects picture 
quality.)
 
 In addition, dSLRs 
offer the options that 
professionals and 
serious amateurs 
demand. They’re 
made to work well 
with external flashes, 
and they’re also able 
to connect to external 
lighting systems (such 
as studio flashes and 
modeling lights). 
Some dSLRs can 
shoot up to 10 frames 
per second for high-
speed, no-lag photos 
of action and sports, 
and many are “rugge-
dized” for use in foul weather and other tough environmental 
conditions. 
 
 On the downside, dSLRs are expensive; expect to pay $400 and up 
just for the body, plus additional dollars for lenses. If you already own 
lenses, you may be able to use them with a digital body, however, and 
lenses for one dSLR often work with other models from the same manu-
facturer. So if you buy an entry-level Nikon dSLR, for example, and really 
catch the fever to go semi-pro or pro, you can use the same lenses on a 
higher-end Nikon body.
 
 You should also know that with some dSLRs, you cannot use the moni-
tor as a viewfinder as you can with point-and-shoot digitals. This isn’t a 
major concern for most dSLR photographers, who prefer framing shots 
using an old-fashioned viewfinder. But if you want to have the choice, 
the feature in question is called Live View (or something similar). It’s 
implemented in different ways, so experiment to see which design you 
like best.
 
 Finally, dSLRs can be intimidating to novice photographers. If you’re 
new to SLR photography, your best bet is to check out entry-level 
models, which typically offer you the choice of shooting in automatic 
mode or manual mode and also offer other ease-of-use features you 
may not get with a semi-pro, high-end model. Then you can enjoy your 
camera right away but have the ability to move beyond auto mode when 
you’re ready.

✓ Point-and-shoot: These models offer convenience and ease of use, provid-
ing autofocus, autoexposure, and auto just-about-everything else. And 
they’re typically less expensive than dSLRs, although some high-end 
point-and-shoots aren’t all that different in price from an entry-level dSLR.
 
 You don’t necessarily have to stick with automatic mode just because 
you go the point-and-shoot route, either. Many point-and-shoot cameras 
offer just about the same advanced photographic controls as a dSLR, 
except for the option to use different lenses. Using those advanced con-
trols can be somewhat more complicated on a point-and-shoot, though; 
on a dSLR, you may be able to access a feature through an external 
button, but on a point-and-shoot, external controls may be more limited 
because of the smaller size of the camera body. 
Speaking of size, the other obvious decision you need to make is just how 
much camera bulk you’re willing to carry around. Although dSLRs are get-
ting more compact every year, you’re not likely to be able to tuck one in your 
shirt pocket, as you can with many point-and-shoot models. But you can 
always do what some pros do: Carry both! Keep a point-and-shoot handy for 
quick snapshots and pull out your dSLR when you have the time (and inclina-
tion) to get more serious.
Picture-quality features
Often overlooked amidst the more glitzy, whiz-bang options touted in camera 
magazine and television ads are the ones that really should come first in 
your selection process: the features that affect the quality of the pictures the 
camera can produce. After all, if a camera doesn’t live up to your expecta-
tions for its main purpose — producing sharp, clear, colorful photographs — 
nothing else really matters. 
The next three sections discuss three aspects of digital photography that 
are critical to picture quality: resolution, image noise levels, and file format 
options. In all three aspects, cameras have really improved over the past few 
years, so if your current model is a couple of years old, you can likely enjoy 
an upgrade in picture quality by buying a new model. 
Be sure to also check out the later section, “Lens features,” for tips on getting 
a good lens, which is also critical to picture quality whether you shoot film or 
digital.
Resolution: How many pixels are enough?
 
Resolution refers to a camera’s pixel count. Pixels are the tiny points on your 
camera’s image sensor that absorb light and turn it into a digital photo. 
Today, the pixel count of new cameras is so high that resolution is usually 
stated in megapixels, with 1 megapixel equal to 1 million pixels.

13
 Chapter 1: Gearing Up: Does Your Equipment Fit Your Needs?
Chapter 4 explains resolution thoroughly, but for the purposes of this discus-
sion, all you need to know is that the higher the pixel count, the larger you 
can print your pictures and expect quality results. As a general rule, you need 
a minimum of 200 pixels per inch, or ppi, to produce an acceptable print; 300 
ppi can be even better, depending on the printer.
Just to help you avoid doing the math, the following list shows you how many 
megapixels you need to produce prints at standard sizes:
 
✓ 4 x 6 inches: 1 megapixel
 
✓ 5 x 7 inches: 1.5 megapixels
 
✓ 8 x 10 inches: 3 megapixels
 
✓ 11 x 14 inches: 6 megapixels
All new digital cameras sold today (except those on cell phones) offer at least 
3 megapixels; in fact, 6 megapixels is now the common entry point. And many 
cameras offer 8 to 12 megapixels, with pro models going even higher.
Given that 6 megapixels translate to an 11 x 14-inch print — a size that most 
of us don’t produce on a regular basis — should you pay more for a camera 
that offers a higher resolution? Again, it depends. Here are a couple of ques-
tions to guide you:
 
✓ Are you a serious photographer interested in making large prints on 
a regular basis? If so, a monster megapixel count makes sense. See the 
upcoming “All pixels are not created equal” sidebar, though, for some 
important news about interpreting pixel count.
 
✓ Do you often crop your photos? Lots of pixels are also important if 
you like to crop your photos. As an example, see Figure 1-3. The origi-
nal image, on the left, has way too much extraneous background, dis-
tracting the eye from the subject; tight cropping resulted in the much 
better composition shown on the right. Had this photo been taken with 
a low-resolution camera, the cropped area wouldn’t have contained 
enough pixels to generate a good print at anything but a very small size. 
But because the image originally contained about 10 megapixels, the 
cropped area retains the necessary pixels for a good print — in fact, it 
could be printed even larger than space permits here.
 
✓ Do you rarely print photos larger than snapshot size? If so, a 6- to 
8-megapixel camera is plenty, assuming that you don’t fall into the 
regular-cropping category just described. Again, with 6 megapixels, you 
can output an 11 x 14-inch print if you don’t crop your photos. So put 
your money toward a more expensive lens, a faster computer, or image 
storage hardware instead of more megapixels.

14
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
 
 Figure 1-3: A high-resolution camera enables you to crop and enlarge your photos without 
picture quality loss.
 
✓ Do you rarely print photos at any size, preferring to share your pic-
tures online? For onscreen display, pixel count has no effect on picture 
quality. Pixel count determines only the size at which your picture is dis-
played, for reasons you can explore fully in Chapter 4. For most screen 
uses, you need very few pixels to display the picture at an appropriate 
size. Refer to Figure 1-4, for example: The large image shown on this 
online album page measures only 480 x 320 pixels, and as you can see, it 
consumes a good chunk of the Web page.
 
 Whether you want to share pictures via e-mail or use them on a blog or 
Web site, virtually every camera made in the last five years has enough 
pixels — actually, way more than enough. So if you’re just shooting pic-
tures for, say, your eBay storefront or the like, you may be able to get a 
bargain by looking for a discontinued or used camera.
 
 If you plan on both printing your photos and sharing them online, con-
centrate on how many pixels are appropriate for print use, knowing that 
if you have enough for that purpose, your online needs are more than 
covered. (See Chapter 11 to find out how to trim the pixel count of your 
original images to make them suitable for online use.)

15
 Chapter 1: Gearing Up: Does Your Equipment Fit Your Needs?
 
 
 Figure 1-4: Low-resolution images are fine for online sharing; the large photo on this Web 
page has just 480 x 320 pixels.
All pixels are not created equal
Because digital camera advertisements make a 
big deal about megapixels, you may be tempted 
to rush out and simply buy the model that has 
the highest pixel count. Not so fast. You need 
to know that more pixels are not necessarily 
the key to better image quality. The size of the 
sensor on which the pixels live also matters.
Here’s the scoop: Larger, high-end cameras 
tend to have bigger sensors than pocket-sized 
point-and-shoot models, for obvious reasons. 
And as it turns out, cramming more pixels onto a 
smaller sensor can actually have a detrimental 
effect on picture quality.
For reasons that aren’t really important, if you put 
the same number of pixels onto a large sensor 
and a smaller sensor, the camera with the larger 
sensor typically produces better images. So even 
though two different cameras — say a subcom-
pact model and a digital SLR — may both boast 
a 10-megapixel sensor, the dSLR probably has a 
bigger sensor and therefore provides more qual-
ity per pixel.
Of course, pixel count is only one factor con-
tributing to picture quality; other factors, such 
as lens quality, are also critical.

16
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
ISO: How high can you go (without noise)
Through a common digital-camera control, you can adjust the light sensitiv-
ity of the image sensor, which is the part of the camera that absorbs light 
and converts it into a digital photograph. These light-sensitivity settings are 
stated in ISO numbers, such as ISO 100, ISO 200, and so on.
The higher the ISO number, the more sensitive the camera is to light. That 
means that you can capture an image in dim lighting without flash, use a 
faster shutter speed, or use a smaller aperture. (These last two controls are 
explained in Chapter 6.)
However, raising the ISO can also produce noise, a defect that gives your 
image a speckled look. Noise also can be caused by long exposure times, 
which are sometimes necessary in low-light conditions whether you raise 
the ISO or not. Finally, low-quality image sensors sometimes create a little 
bit of noise because of the heat and electrical processes that occur when the 
camera is used.
Today’s cameras are much less noisy than in years past, but noise can still 
be a problem with high ISO settings and very long exposures. Only a few, 
high-end cameras can be set to ISOs above 800 without producing noise, for 
example. Some cameras start to exhibit noise at ISO 400.
 
Because noise levels vary from camera to camera, this is an important char-
acteristic to study during your camera search. Camera reviews online and 
in photography magazines regularly include noise tests; see Chapter 13 for a 
few of our favorite online resources. See Chapter 5 for a more thorough dis-
cussion of ISO and noise.
File format options: Can you (should you) go Raw?
File format refers to the type of data file that’s used to record the pictures 
you take. The standard format is JPEG (jay-pegg), but some higher-end cam-
eras also offer a second format called Camera Raw, or just Raw for short.
Chapter 4 explains both formats completely, but the short story on Raw 
is that it offers two benefits that appeal to pro photographers and serious 
photo enthusiasts:
 
✓ Raw files give the photographer more control over the look of a pic-
ture. With JPEG, the camera translates the data captured by the image 
sensor into a final image, making decisions on such picture character-
istics as color saturation, brightness, sharpness, and so on. With Raw, 
none of this happens. Instead, the Raw file contains “uncooked” picture 
data, and the photographer then specifies how that data should be con-
verted into a picture. This step is done on the computer, using a soft-
ware tool known as a Raw converter. (Some cameras also offer a built-in 
tool for doing the conversion.)

17
 Chapter 1: Gearing Up: Does Your Equipment Fit Your Needs?
 
✓ Raw files deliver the maximum image quality. During the file-creation 
process, JPEG files go through a process called lossy compression, which 
reduces file size by eliminating some picture data. And any time picture 
data is discarded, image quality can be reduced. Raw files, on the other 
hand, retain all the original picture data to avoid this problem.
All this is not to say that you should bypass cameras that offer only JPEG, 
however. First, as long as you stick with your camera’s highest quality set-
tings, JPEG compression isn’t a big deal or even noticeable to most people 
unless the photo is greatly enlarged. And the compression means that JPEG 
files are smaller than Raw files, so you can fit more pictures on your camera 
memory card and on your computer’s hard drive.
Perhaps most important, though, consider whether you really want to spend 
the computer time required to process Raw images — and understand that 
until you take that step, you can’t do much of anything with your photos. You 
can’t share them via e-mail, put them on a Web page, or take them to your 
local retailer for printing. JPEG files, on the other hand, are ready for use 
right out of the camera.
 
All other things being equal, though, a camera that offers both formats beats 
one that offers only JPEG. You may not be interested in Raw now, but as your 
skills grow, it may be more appealing to you. And if you’re already doing the 
kind of photography that requires top-notch control and quality, such as for 
photo contests, galleries, weddings, or other important uses, shooting in Raw 
is something you’ll want to consider.
Lens features
Also important to your long-term satisfaction with a camera are the type and 
quality of its lens and its related bits and pieces. When comparing cameras, 
consider these lens factors:
 
✓ Optical quality: Without getting into technical details, the quality of the 
image that a lens can capture depends on both its material and manu-
facture. To get an idea of the difference that optical quality can make, 
just imagine the view that you get when looking through sunglasses that 
have cheap, plastic lenses versus pristine, real-glass lenses.
 
 Optical quality has improved significantly over the past several years, 
especially among point-and-shoot cameras. Many models now sport 
lenses that are made from professional-quality materials and offer pow-
erful optical zoom capabilities. Of course, you’re always going to get the 
best optics from the types of lenses used by digital SLR cameras — and 
thankfully, the prices of those models now make them an affordable 
choice for many people. (See the earlier section, “Design options: Point-
and-shoot or SLR?” for more guidance on choosing between the two 
types of cameras.)

18
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
 Unfortunately, it’s tough to evaluate a camera’s optical quality; it’s not 
something you can judge just by playing around with a few models in 
the store. So again, your best bet is to study reviews in camera maga-
zines and at online photography sites, where optics are tested according 
to rigorous technical standards.
 
✓ Focal length: The focal length of a lens, stated in millimeters, deter-
mines the angle of view that the camera can capture and the spatial rela-
tionship of objects in the frame. Focal length also affects depth of field, 
or the distance over which focus remains sharp. 
 
 You can loosely categorize lenses according to the following focal length 
groups:
 
• Wide-angle: Lenses with short focal lengths — generally, anything 
under 35mm — are known as wide-angle lenses. A wide-angle lens 
has the visual effect of pushing the subject away from you and 
making it appear smaller. As a result, you can fit more of the scene 
into the frame without moving back. Additionally, a wide-angle lens 
has a large depth of field so that the zone of sharp focus extends a 
greater distance. All these characteristics make wide-angle lenses 
ideal for landscape photography.
 
• Telephoto: Lenses with focal lengths longer than about 70mm are 
called telephoto lenses. These lenses seem to bring the subject 
closer to you, increase the subject’s size in the frame, and produce 
a short depth of field, so that the subject is sharply focused, but 
distant objects are blurry. They’re great for capturing wildlife and 
other subjects that don’t permit up-close shooting.
 
• Normal: A focal length in the neighborhood of 35mm to 70mm is 
considered “normal” — that is, somewhere between a wide-angle 
and telephoto. This focal length produces the angle of view and 
depth of field that are appropriate for the kinds of snapshots that 
most people take.
 
 Figure 1-5 offers an illustration of the difference that focal length makes, 
showing the same scene captured at 42mm and 138mm. Of course, the 
illustration shows you just two of countless possibilities, and the ques-
tion of which focal length best captures a scene depends on your cre-
ative goals. So you may want to visit a camera store, where you usually 
can find brochures that illustrate the types of shots you can capture at 
specific focal lengths. Then just think about the subjects you usually 
shoot and match the lens focal length to your needs.
 
 Also, check out Chapter 6 for a further explanation of how you can 
manipulate depth of field to achieve different creative results.
 
✓ Zoom power: With a zoom lens, you get a range of focal lengths in one 
unit. For example, a lens might zoom from 18mm to 55mm. Do note that 
with a lens that offers a really large focal range — say, 18 to 200 — you 
tend to see some quality drop-off at certain points in the range. (Here 
again, camera magazines routinely measure this type of thing.)

42mm
138mm
 
 Figure 1-5: A short focal length captures a wide angle of view (left); a long focal length 
brings the subject closer (right).
 
 When testing a point-and-shoot camera, make sure that the button 
or knob you use to manipulate the zoom is conveniently positioned 
and easy to use. On a digital SLR, you zoom by twisting the lens barrel, 
so this isn’t an issue. However, you do want to watch out for so-called 
lens creep: Some SLR zooms have a tendency to slide from one focal 
length to another, without any input from you, when you tilt the 
camera.
 
✓ Optical versus digital zoom: For zoom lenses on point-and-shoot cam-
eras, another important factor to note is whether the lens offers an opti-
cal or digital zoom. An optical zoom is a true zoom lens and produces 
the best picture quality. Digital zoom is a software feature that simply 
crops and enlarges your image, just as you might do in a photo-editing 
program. Because you’re then left with fewer original image pixels, the 
result is typically a reduction in image quality.
 
 You don’t have to disregard cameras that have digital zoom; just don’t 
think that it’s a benefit to your photography. And if the camera offers 
both an optical and digital zoom, find out whether you can disable the 
digital part. Some cameras automatically shift into digital zoom mode 
when you reach the end of the optical zoom range and don’t alert you to 
that change.
Photo-enthusiast features
Today’s digital cameras offer fully automatic everything, so you really can 
just “point and shoot.” But if you’re a photography enthusiast or ready to 
move out of automatic mode, look for advanced features that enable you to 
take more control over exposure, color, and other picture characteristics. 
You can explore some of these features in the next few sections.

20
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
Advanced exposure options
In order to get creative with exposure, you need a camera that gives you 
some control over two critical settings: aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed. 
You can get a full briefing on how these two settings work in Chapter 5, but 
for now, just give points to cameras that offer the following options:
 
✓ Aperture-priority autoexposure: In this mode, you can specify the aper-
ture, or f-stop, and the camera then selects the shutter speed needed 
to produce a good exposure. Having control over aperture is important 
because the setting you use affects depth of field, or the distance over 
which objects in the scene appear in sharp focus. So if you’re shooting a 
portrait, for example, you can select an aperture that keeps the subject 
sharp while blurring the background.
 
 This mode typically is represented on camera dials by the initials A or 
Av (aperture value).
 
✓ Shutter-priority autoexposure: In this mode, you select the shutter speed, 
and the camera selects the aperture setting needed to expose the picture 
properly. Because shutter speed determines whether moving objects 
appear blurry or “frozen” in place, gaining control over this exposure 
setting is especially important if you shoot lots of action pictures.
 
 Shutter-priority autoexposure mode is usually labeled S or Tv (time 
value) on the camera’s exposure dial.
 
✓ Exposure compensation: Sometimes known as EV (exposure value) com-
pensation, this setting enables you to tell the camera that you want a 
slightly darker or lighter picture than the autoexposure system thinks is 
appropriate. Some cameras only let you apply this adjustment when you 
use shutter-priority or aperture-priority autoexposure; others make the 
control available even when you shoot in fully automatic exposure modes.
 
✓ Manual exposure: In this mode, you can specify both aperture and 
shutter speed to precisely control exposure. Doing so isn’t as hard as 
you may think by the way, because most cameras still guide you by 
displaying a meter that lets you know whether your picture will be 
properly exposed.
These four controls are the most critical for photographers who want to 
manipulate exposure, but they’re just the start of the multitude of exposure-
related features found on today’s high-end point-and-shoot and digital SLR 
cameras. You can read about additional features and get the complete story 
on exposure in Chapter 5.
Advanced white-balance controls
Digital cameras use a process called white balancing to ensure accurate 
colors in any light source. In most cases, automatic white balancing works 

21
 Chapter 1: Gearing Up: Does Your Equipment Fit Your Needs?
fine, but problems can occur when a scene is lit by multiple light sources — 
a classroom illuminated by a mix of window light and fluorescent light, for 
example. So having the ability to adjust color manually is helpful. Just a few 
feature names to look for:
 
✓ Manual white balance modes enable you to choose a white-balance 
setting designed for a specific light source, which can solve some color 
problems.
 
✓ White-balance bracketing records the shot three times, using a slightly 
different white-balance adjustment for each image.
 
✓ White-balance shift (or correction) makes minor tweaks to the color 
adjustment that the camera applies for different light sources.
 
✓ Custom white-balance presets enable you to create and store your own 
white-balance setting. So if you have special photography lights that you 
use for studio shooting, for example, you can fine-tune the white-balance 
adjustment to those exact lights.
Chapter 6 fully explores white balance and other color issues.
Digital vs. film focal lengths
When you shop for a digital camera lens, you 
need to know that focal lengths are stated in 
terms of the results you would get if you put 
that lens on a camera body that uses 35mm film 
(that’s the size you’ve probably been using in 
your film camera for years). But very few digi-
tal cameras have a so-called full-frame sensor, 
which is the same size as that 35mm film nega-
tive. Most sensors are smaller, and because of 
that reduced size, the area that any given focal 
length can capture is reduced when you put the 
lens on a digital body. The resulting picture is 
similar to what you would get if you took a pic-
ture with a 35mm film camera and then cropped 
the picture slightly.
How much frame area you lose varies from 
camera to camera and is called the crop factor. 
Most dSLR image sensors have a crop factor 
ranging from 1.3 to 1.6. To figure out how a lens 
you’re considering will perform, you multiply the 
camera’s crop factor by the lens focal length. 
For example, if the camera has a crop factor 
of 1.5, a 50mm lens gives you the same angle 
of view as 75mm lens on a 35mm film camera. 
Note that the other characteristics determined 
by focal length — the spatial relationship of 
objects in the frame and depth of field — are 
not affected by the crop factor. In those two 
regards, a lens performs identically regardless 
of the camera body.
If you opt for a point-and-shoot camera, you 
typically see a specification that gives both the 
actual focal length of the lens and the 35mm 
equivalent, as in “5mm lens, equivalent to 35mm 
lens on 35mm-format camera.” In this case, 
you can just ignore the actual focal length and 
expect the lens to produce the results indicated

Advanced flash features
The built-in flash found on most digital cameras offers a convenient source 
of light but typically produces harsh lighting and strong shadows. For better 
flash pictures, look for a camera that enables you to attach an external flash, 
such as the Nikon unit shown on the left in Figure 1-6. Usually, you attach 
the flash via a hot shoe, which looks something like what you see on the right 
in Figure 1-6. Some cameras also enable you to attach a flash via a cable.

Figure 1-6: A hot shoe enables you to attach an external flash.
An external flash gives you lots more flash flexibility. If the flash has a rotat-
ing head, you can angle the head so that the flash light bounces off the ceiling 
and then falls softly down on your subject, for example. With some external 
flashes, you can even position the flash on a stand, off the camera, and then 
trigger the flash with a remote switch.
Other important features for flash photography include the following:
 
✓ Manual flash control: For better flash photography, look for exposure 
modes that enable you to decide when the flash fires. On some point-
and-shoot models, you can use flash only when the camera thinks addi-
tional light is needed. That can be problematic for outdoor photography 
because many pictures benefit from flash even in bright sunshine.
 
✓ Flash exposure compensation: This feature enables you to adjust the 
power of the flash.

23
 Chapter 1: Gearing Up: Does Your Equipment Fit Your Needs?
 
✓ Flash recycle time and power usage: If the flash on your current camera 
seems sluggish, you can probably enjoy a significant performance upgrade 
by investing in a new camera. Flashes on newer cameras also tend to have a 
faster recycle time — that is, they can recharge and be ready to shoot again 
more quickly — and use less battery power than in years past.
See Chapter 5 for more about flashes and lighting.
Viewfinder options
Some cameras lack a traditional viewfinder and instead force you to frame your 
shots using the LCD monitor. Manufacturers omit the viewfinder either to lower 
the cost of the camera or to allow a non-traditional camera design. But it can be 
difficult to go without a viewfinder because you have to hold the camera a few 
inches away to see the monitor. If your hands aren’t that steady, taking a picture 
without moving the camera can be tricky. When looking through the viewfinder, 
however, you can brace the camera against your face. Additionally, monitors 
tend to wash out in bright light, making it hard to see what you’re shooting. 
 
Most, but not all cameras aimed at photo enthusiasts do sport a viewfinder, 
fortunately. If you decide that a viewfinder is critical, take a look at both tra-
ditional viewfinders — sometimes called optical viewfinders — and electronic 
viewfinders. Often referred to as an EVF, an electronic viewfinder is actually 
a tiny microdisplay, much like the monitor itself. The electronic viewfinder 
displays the same image that the camera lens sees, so you can shoot with-
out worrying about parallax errors, a phenomenon that can occur with some 
optical viewfinders. (Chapter 3 has details.) However, some people don’t 
like most electronic viewfinders because the display is less sharp than what 
you see through an optical viewfinder. Also, you usually can’t see anything 
through the viewfinder until you turn the camera on, which means that you 
can’t set up your shots without using up battery life.
Make-it-easy features
You say you’re not interested in becoming the next Annie Liebowitz or Ansel 
Adams? Relax. You can take great pictures without having to know a thing 
about aperture, shutter speed, and all the other advanced stuff discussed in 
the preceding section.
New digital cameras offer a variety of features designed to make getting great 
shots easier than ever; just look for the options explored in the next several 
sections when you shop.
Automatic scene modes
Scene modes are settings that automatically set your camera to shoot a spe-
cific type of picture. Most cameras now offer a standard handful of basic 
scene modes, offering settings designed to shoot action shots, portraits, 

24
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
close-ups, landscapes, and nighttime scenes. But some cameras add many 
more scene modes, offering settings designed to cope with any number of 
settings, subjects, and lighting conditions, from shooting underwater to cap-
turing children playing in snow.
 
When evaluating cameras, pay attention not just to the number of scene 
modes, but also to how easily you can access them. Some cameras make you 
dig through layers of menus to access scene modes, and the more hassle 
that’s required to get to a feature, the less likely you are to use it.
See Chapter 3 for more about scene modes.
Image stabilization
One common cause of blurry pictures is camera shake. That is, the camera 
moves during the period when the camera’s shutter is open and light is hit-
ting the image sensor. The longer the exposure time, the longer you have to 
hold the camera still to avoid this type of blur. Camera shake is also more of 
a problem if you shoot with a telephoto lens, especially if it’s one of the long, 
heavy types you can buy for a digital SLR.
You can always avoid camera shake by mounting the camera on a tripod. But a 
feature called image stabilization can enable you to get sharper shots when you 
need to handhold the camera. The feature may go by different names depending 
on the manufacturer: vibration reduction, anti-shake, vibration compensation, and 
the like. Whatever the name, the feature is implemented in one of two ways:
 
✓ Hardware-based stabilization: With this method, sometimes called opti-
cal image stabilization, the anti-shake benefit is produced by a mecha-
nism built into the camera or, in the case of some digital SLRs, the lens. 
This type of image stabilization is considered the best.
 
 
 If you’re a dSLR buyer, having the mechanism in the camera body means 
that you enjoy stabilization no matter what lens you attach. However, 
some experts argue that lens-based stabilization offers better results.
 
✓ Software-based stabilization: This type of stabilization, sometimes 
known as electronic image stabilization, or EIS, is applied by the camera’s 
internal operating software rather than a hardware mechanism. It works 
differently depending on the camera. In some cases, the camera applies 
some complex correction filters to the image when motion is detected. 
Other cameras address camera shake by automatically increasing the 
ISO setting, which makes the camera more sensitive to light. At a higher 
ISO, you can use a faster shutter speed, which means that the length 
of time you need to hold the camera still is reduced. Unfortunately, a 
higher ISO often brings the unwanted side effect of image noise, as dis-
cussed earlier in the “Picture-quality features” section.

25
 Chapter 1: Gearing Up: Does Your Equipment Fit Your Needs?
The payoff you get from image stabilization is another one of those features 
that is difficult to evaluate from merely playing with a camera for a few minutes 
in a store. In general, optical stabilization is better than software-based stabili-
zation, but for specifics on how well the cameras you’re considering perform in 
this arena, search out in-depth reviews.
 
Even the best possible stabilization system can’t work miracles; you’re still 
not able to handhold the camera for a very long time before camera shake 
ruins your picture. Without stabilization, most photographers can hold a 
camera steady down to a shutter speed of about 1/60 second if they’re really 
good. With image stabilization, you may be able to reduce the shutter speed 
to 1/30 second — or even 1/15 if you’re Cool-Hand Luke.
Chapter 6 talks more about ways to avoid blurry images.
In-camera Help systems
Many cameras now offer internal 
Help systems. If you can’t remember 
what a particular button does, for 
example, you can press a button to 
see a screen that reminds you, as 
shown in Figure 1-7. This particular 
Help screen is from a Nikon camera, 
but other manufacturers offer similar 
displays. Built-in help is a great tool 
for times when you don’t want to lug 
your manual around. Some cameras 
also offer hints to help you solve 
exposure problems and other image-
capture issues.
Smile/face/blink detection
Camera companies are always looking for new snazzy features to impress 
you — and just maybe make your photos even better. One of the newest is 
face recognition. This feature automatically detects and focuses on a subject’s 
face as long as you’re at a typical portrait-taking distance. This feature is 
great for taking photos of kids who squirm a lot when getting their picture 
taken.
Taking face recognition one step further, a few companies have announced 
cameras capable of smile and blink detection! In this mode, the camera tracks 
a subject’s face and then snaps the photo automatically when the person’s 
eyes are open and smile is widest.
Figure 1-7: Some cameras offer built-in Help 
systems.

26
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
Of course, these features aren’t foolproof; the camera sometimes misinterprets 
the scene and sets focus on the wrong subject. And if you’re capturing a group 
of people, they’re probably not all going to exhibit those wide smiles and 
bright eyes at the exact same moment. So the best way to ensure that you get 
a great portrait is to snap many different images of your subject. When you 
review your photos on the monitor, most cameras enable you to magnify the 
view so that you can double-check for open eyes and great smiles.
Speed features
Among both amateur and pro photographers, one of the most common com-
plaints about digital cameras in years past was that they were slow: slow to 
come to life when you turned them on, slow to respond when you pressed the 
shutter button, and slow to finish recording one image so that you could cap-
ture another. This sluggish behavior made capturing action shots extremely 
difficult.
Well, camera manufacturers heard the complaints and responded with a 
variety of technical changes that greatly reduced the problem. So if you’ve 
been frustrated with this aspect of your current camera, a new model will 
likely ease the pain. Most cameras now can keep up with the most demanding 
rapid-fire shooter, although again, you should read reviews carefully because 
cameras vary in this regard.
Along with faster start-up and image-recording times, many new cameras also 
offer some, if not all, of the following features to make speed shooting even 
easier:
 
✓ Burst mode: In this mode, sometimes called continuous capture, you can 
record multiple photos with one press of the shutter button, reducing 
the time needed to record a series of pictures. Typically, you can cap-
ture several frames per second — the exact number varies from camera 
to camera. In Figure 1-8, for example, a burst speed of three frames per 
second captured five stages of the golfer’s swing.
 
✓ Shutter-priority autoexposure or manual exposure: In both exposure 
modes, you can control the shutter speed, which is critical to determin-
ing whether a moving subject appears blurry. If you shoot a lot of action 
shots, this kind of shutter control is highly recommended. (See Chapter 
5 for an explanation of shutter speed.)
 
✓ Sports mode: This mode enables even photography novices to capture 
action without having to learn all the ins and outs of shutter speed, ISO, 
and other exposure intricacies. Just dial in the Sports setting, and the 
camera automatically adjusts all the necessary controls to best capture 
a moving target.

 Figure 1-8: Burst mode enables you to shoot a moving target. Here, a capture 
setting of three frames per second broke a golfer’s swing into five stages.

28
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
✓ Dynamic or continuous autofocus: This autofocus mode, which may 
go by different names depending on the model, adjusts focus as needed 
right up to the time you take the shot to keep moving subjects in focus.
 
✓ Compatibility with high-speed memory cards: Camera memory cards — 
the little removable cards that store your pictures — are rated in terms of 
how fast they can read and write data. With a faster card, the camera needs 
less time to store the image data after you shoot the picture. Although older 
cameras often can’t take advantage of the speed increases, many newer 
models are designed to work with even the fastest cards. 
Other fun (and practical) features
Describing all the features found on the latest digital cameras is nigh on 
impossible; it seems that every day, some new camera option is announced. 
But the following list introduces you to some of the most common additional 
features that may be of interest to you. These options fall into the category of 
not necessary but nice to have — sort of like an extra cup holder in your car 
or a bonus track on a CD:
 
✓ In-camera editing tools: Many cameras offer built-in retouching filters 
that can fix minor picture flaws, such as red-eye or exposure problems. 
Some cameras that can capture pictures in the Camera Raw format 
even offer an in-camera converter that translates your Raw file into the 
standard JPEG format. (See the earlier section related to file formats for 
more about this issue.) These tools are especially helpful for times when 
you need to print or share a photo before you can get to your computer 
to fix the image in your photo software.
 
✓ Adjustable LCD monitors: Most newer cameras feature larger LCD 
screens than the somewhat smallish versions offered in first-generation 
models. In fact, some monitors are nearly as large as the back of the 
camera. But some cameras, such as the Canon model shown in Figure 1-9, 
take the monitor design a step further, featuring fold-out screens that can 
be rotated to a variety of angles. This adjustable type of monitor enables 
you to shoot at nearly any angle while still being able to see the monitor.
 
✓ Video capture: Some point-and-shoot cameras can record short digital 
movie clips. Although not intended as a replacement for a real cam-
corder, this feature can be a fun way to capture a little “live action” 
along with your still photos.
 
✓ Print and e-mail functions: Many cameras enable you to create an e-mail-
sized copy of a high-resolution image. (See the earlier section related to res-
olution to find out why you don’t want to simply send that high-res image 
through cyberspace.) And some cameras offer a feature called PictBridge, 
which enables you to connect your camera directly to your printer, so you 
can print your photos without ever downloading to your computer. (The 
printer also must offer PictBridge capabilities.) This feature is great for 
printing pictures at birthday parties, conventions, and the like.

✓ Video-out capa-
bilities: If the camera 
has a video-out port, 
you can connect the 
camera to a televi-
sion and view your 
pictures on the TV 
screen, as shown 
in Figure 1-10. This 
feature is a great way 
to share photos with 
the entire family or 
co-workers.
 
✓ Wireless image 
transfer: There’s a 
lot in the air today. 
It seems like every-
thing is wireless, 
from the WiFi con-
nection at your local 
coffee shop to every-
one walking around looking like aliens with their Bluetooth cell phone 
earpieces. And, of course, digital photography is no exception. Some 
high-end dSLRs support optional wireless file transmitters that connect 
using networking technology so that photographers can instantly send 
images from the camera to a computer. This capability is useful, for 
example, for photojournalists who need to get images from important 
news or sports events posted immediately on the Web.

that has a video-out port.

 For consumers, some cam-
eras can use a new type of 
wireless memory card, the 
Eye-Fi SD card, shown in 
Figure 1-11. This card gives 
you the ability to wirelessly 
transmit images to your 
home computer using a WiFi 
connection. Chapter 2 talks 
more about buying and using 
memory cards.
So . . . is it time 
to upgrade?
Summing up all the details in the 
preceding sections, the answer to 
the question posed by the head-
line is, well, maybe. Assuming that your camera is a couple of years old, you 
should definitely look at a new model if any of the following statements apply:
Serge Timacheff

memory card with a wireless file transmitter. 
Batteries: New life, new technology
In the early days of digital photography, it wasn’t 
uncommon for a camera to run for a meager 20 
minutes or so before battery power was depleted. 
Thankfully, you can expect significantly longer 
battery life now than in years past. Battery tech-
nology has advanced, and cameras have gotten 
better in terms of power management.
Some cameras run on standard AA or AAA bat-
teries, while others use a proprietary recharge-
able battery designed for use just with the 
camera. The nice thing about AA or AAA batter-
ies is that you can find those batteries virtually 
anywhere in the world; the bad thing is that it 
gets costly to replace them all the time. You can 
save money by investing in rechargeables, but 
first make sure that your camera can work with 
them; some older models can’t.
Proprietary batteries come with their own char-
ger and typically have more endurance than 
AAs or AAAs. Of course, if you run out of juice 
or you lose the battery, you’re stuck until you 
recharge it or find a shop that sells a replace-
ment. If you’re heading to a remote location, it’s 
a good idea to buy an extra battery so that you 
can carry a spare. Wilderness adventurers can 
even get solar chargers for AA and AAA as well 
as camera-specific batteries. 
As for battery technology, common recharge-
able battery types are Li-ion (lithium ion), NiCd 
(nickel cadmium), and NiMH (nickel metal 
hydride). NiMH is the best choice for AAs and 
AAAs; most proprietary batteries are Li-ion. 
All three types typically last longer than non-
rechargeable, alkaline AA and AAA batteries. 
Remember that any rechargeable can lose 
power while it’s sitting on the shelf, however, 
so be sure to charge up the night before you 
plan to shoot.

31
 Chapter 1: Gearing Up: Does Your Equipment Fit Your Needs?
 
✓ You’re not happy with the quality of your photos, especially when you 
print them larger than snapshot size.
 
✓ You have trouble capturing action shots because your camera is a slow 
performer.
 
✓ Your pictures appear noisy (speckly) when you shoot in dim lighting.
 
✓ You’re a serious photographer (or want to be) and your camera doesn’t 
offer any exposure controls, Raw image capture, a flash hot shoe, or 
other advanced features.
 
✓ You have trouble viewing your pictures on the camera monitor because 
it’s too small and difficult to see in bright light.
 
✓ Your pictures are often ruined by camera shake (which causes blurry 
pictures), and you could benefit from image stabilization.
Of course, some cameras address these issues better than others, so again, 
be sure that you read reviews on any new model you consider. Also consult 
with the salespeople at your local camera store, who can point you toward 
cameras that best solve the picture-taking problems you’re experiencing.
Equipping Your Digital Darkroom
In addition to deciding on whether your camera meets your needs, you also 
need to ponder whether your computer, monitor, printer, and photo software 
are suitable for the types of projects you like to do.
Chapter 10 provides a detailed discussion about printers, including advice on 
when you should print your own images and when you’re better off having 
them printed at your local photo lab. Chapter 2 introduces you to some great 
photo software for editing your photos, and Chapter 8 looks at products for 
storing and organizing your image files.
That leaves the core component of your digital darkroom: the computer 
itself. Here’s a quick overview of the characteristics of a system that will 
serve you well in the digital photography arena:
 
✓ System components: Just as the cost of digital cameras has dropped 
dramatically over the past few years, new computer systems, too, 
offer you a lot more power for your money than in the past. But at the 
same time, image-editing software has become more sophisticated and 
demanding of your system’s resources. Plus, digital cameras are 
producing larger image files, which not only require more storage 
space but also require more system resources to process in your 
photo editor.

32
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
 Long story short, having plenty of system memory (RAM), a large hard 
drive, a capable graphics card, and a relatively fast processor will make 
your digital photography work much easier and can even pay for itself in 
time saved during image processing.
 
✓ Operating system: The computer’s operating system — OS, in geek ter-
minology — also can make a difference. You can run many photography 
programs on older versions of Windows or the Mac OS, but the newer 
versions are optimized to work better with images. For example, Mac 
Leopard’s “Quick Look” and Windows Vista’s Explorer both provide 
much-improved ways to search for and review images than previous edi-
tions of either operating system. 
 
✓ USB connectivity: New digital cameras, printers, memory-card read-
ers, and other digital imaging devices connect to computers through 
a technology known as USB (Universal Serial Bus). If your computer is 
old enough that it doesn’t yet support the latest version of this technol-
ogy, USB 2.0, you may want to upgrade to that standard. (You can buy a 
USB 2.0 card and install it in your computer; your local computer expert 
can show you how.) This feature determines in part how fast you can 
transfer images from the camera to the computer or from a memory-
card reader to the computer, and you can enjoy faster performance by 
moving from USB 1.0 to 2.0.
 
✓ Monitor: A monitor is another important component of your digital 
darkroom. It used to be that those big, bulky TV-like monitors (CRT, or 
cathode-ray tube, monitors, to be specific) produced the best-quality 
computer displays and that LCD monitors were considered amateurish 
and gimmicky. Not so today: LCD displays have overtaken the market 
as the standard, and the images they produce are nothing less than 
stunning. You can get ultra-high resolution monitors (that even support 
HDTV, for heaven’s sake) at a remarkably affordable price that will make 
your photos look like they’re alive in your studio. 
 
 One tip, however: Especially if you’re doing color-critical imaging work, 
be sure to shop carefully to make sure that the LCD performs well for 
this type of use — some are better than others, as with any product. 
Also, if you still have a CRT monitor, and it’s working well for you, 
there’s no need to run out and replace it with an LCD. You may discover 
that it provides a better display than many new, low-priced LCDs, in fact. 
Of course, it doesn’t look nearly as cool on your desk, but . . . 
Mind you, this isn’t to suggest that you must go out and buy a brand-new 
computer and all the trimmings. If you use a medium-resolution camera that 
doesn’t produce huge picture files, and you stick with consumer-level photo 
software, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements, you may be just fine with a 
computer that’s a few years old or a middle-of-the-line new system. If you do 
work with an older system, though, you may find it beneficial to treat your-
self to some new hardware.

Sources for More Shopping Guidance
If you read this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the fea-
tures you do and don’t want in your digital camera as well as in the other 
components of your digital darkroom. But you need to do some more in-
depth research so that you can find out the details on specific makes and 
models.
First, look in digital photography magazines as well as in traditional pho-
tography magazines (such as Shutterbug) for reviews on individual digital 
cameras and peripherals. Some of the reviews may be too high-tech for your 
taste or complete understanding, but if you first digest the information in this 
chapter as well as Chapter 4, you can get the gist of things.
If you have Internet access, you can also find good information on several 
Web sites dedicated to digital photography. See Chapter 13 for suggestions 
on a few Web sites worth visiting.
 
One final bit of buying advice: As you would with any major investment, find 
out about the camera’s warranty and the return policy of the store where you 
plan to buy. Many retailers charge a restocking fee, which means that unless 
the camera is defective, you’re charged a fee for the privilege of returning or 
exchanging the camera. Some sellers charge restocking fees of 10 to 20 per-
cent of the camera’s price.

o you remember your first Barbie doll or — if you’re a guy who refuses 
to admit playing with a girl’s toy — your first G.I. Joe? In and of themselves, 
the dolls were entertaining enough, especially if the adult who ruled your house-
hold didn’t get too upset when you shaved Barbie’s head and took G.I. Joe 
for a spin in the garbage disposal. But Barbie and Joe were even 
more fun if you could talk someone into buying some of the 
accessories. With a few changes of clothing, a plastic con-
vertible or tank, and loyal doll friends like Midge and Ken, 
Dollworld was a much more interesting place.
Similarly, you can enhance your digital photography 
experience by adding a few hardware and software 
accessories. Digital camera accessories don’t bring 
quite the same rush as a Barbie penthouse or a G.I. 
Joe surface-to-air missile, but they greatly expand 
your creative options and make some aspects of digi-
tal photography easier.
This chapter introduces you to some of the best digital 
photography accessories, from portable hard drives that let 
you store images on the road to new-fangled tripods that can grip 
almost anything. Be sure to also visit Chapters 8, 10, and 11, which cover 
some additional goodies related to downloading, printing, and sharing your photos.
 
All the prices quoted in this chapter and elsewhere are what you can expect 
to pay in retail or online stores. Because prices for many digital imaging prod-
ucts seem to drop daily, you may be able to get even more for your money by 
the time you’re finished reading this book.

Buying and Using Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras use removable memory 
cards. Some cameras ship with a starter card, but it’s typically a small-capacity 
card that can hold very few pictures. So it’s a safe prediction: You’ll need to 
buy a memory card, or two, or more. 
 
When you shop for memory cards, you encounter many different card types. 
But the decision about which type you need is pretty much made for you 
because most cameras, with the exception of a few high-end models, can use 
only one kind. So check your camera manual to find out which of the follow-
ing card types it accepts:
 
✓ SD (Secure Digital): The most popular card type because of their small 
size, reliability, and high capacity, these cards are supported by a wide 
variety of digital cameras.
 
✓ SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity): These cards look just like SD 
cards, but they use a new technology that allows greater storage capac-
ity than SD cards.
 
 Although you can use SD cards in most devices that support SDHC, the 
reverse isn’t always true. Note, too, that if you want to download images to 
your computer using a memory-card reader, the reader also must be com-
patible with SDHC, not just SD. (Chapter 8 talks about image downloads.)
 
✓ MiniSD: About half the size of an SD card, MiniSD cards are often used 
in very small digital cameras. If your card reader doesn’t support MiniSD 
directly, you can get a special MiniSD adapter that lets you use them in 
your SD card slot.
 
✓ CompactFlash: These cards, which are physically larger and square-
shaped, are very popular in larger digital cameras. They support a wide 
variety of storage capacities ranging from small to very large; some 
CompactFlash cards can store more than 16GB (gigabytes) of picture 
data. 
 
✓ xD-Picture Card: Designed by Fujifilm and Olympus, these cards are 
smaller than a postage stamp but hold a remarkable amount of photos. 
 
✓ Sony Memory Stick: About the size of a stick of chewing gum, these 
cards are used in some Sony cameras and other Sony devices. 
After finding out what card type you need, the next decision to make is what 
card capacity you need. The good news is that most types of removable 
camera memory are very affordable — unlike gasoline, memory cards have 
dropped dramatically in price over the past couple of years, so you can 
afford to carry around a lot of picture-storage capacity. Keep in mind that the 
more memory you can carry with you, the less often you need to stop shoot-
ing to download pictures to your computer.

37
 Chapter 2: Extra Goodies for Extra Fun
 
How many pictures can a memory card hold? The size of a picture file depends 
on several factors, including what resolution and file format you use when you 
shoot the photo. (See Chapter 4 for an explanation of resolution and file for-
mats.) Your camera manual should provide a table that lists the specific file 
sizes of pictures taken at each of the resolution and format settings the camera 
offers. But Table 2-1 gives you a general idea of approximately how many pic-
tures can fit in various amounts of memory. The table assumes that the picture 
is taken using the JPEG file format with a minor amount of compression — a 
setting that translates to good picture quality. If you shoot in the Camera Raw 
format, your files are substantially larger. On the other hand, if you use a lower-
quality JPEG setting, file sizes are much smaller.

Memory shopping tips
Here are a few other pointers on buying camera memory:
 
✓ Remember, most cameras can use only one type of memory, so check 
your manual for specifics. You don’t have to buy any particular brand, 
though; it’s the card type that matters — CompactFlash, Memory Stick, 
and so on.
 
✓ Also, check your camera manual to find out the maximum capacity card 
it accepts. Some older cameras can’t use the new, high capacity cards.
 
✓ Memory cards come in a variety of “speeds.” No, this doesn’t mean how 
fast you can stick them into the camera and shoot (sorry, Quick Draw). 
Rather, it refers to how fast your images can be recorded on them and 
moved from them to the computer. This speed is specified on the card 
with a number and an “x” sign: 66x, 90x, 133x, and so on, with a higher 
number indicating a faster card. Card speed is especially important for 
cameras that can shoot lots of photos in quick succession; faster cards 
mean that you can keep shooting without any pauses. Of course, speed 
equates to cost: The faster the card, the more expensive it is.

Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
 Before you buy, check to make sure that your camera is engineered to 
take advantage of the higher-speed cards (most point-and-shoot models 
are not). Also, understand that you probably won’t notice a difference 
unless you’re shooting at high resolutions — say, 5 megapixels or more. 
Finally, note that when it comes to how fast you can download images, 
the speed of the card isn’t the only factor; the capabilities of the card 
reader and your computer come into play as well.
 
✓ As with other commodities, you pay less per megabyte when you buy “in 
bulk.” A 2GB card costs less per megabyte than a 512MB card, for example.
Care and feeding of memory cards
To protect your memory cards — as well as the images they hold — pay 
attention to the following care and maintenance tips:
 
✓ When you insert a card into your camera for the first time, you may need 
to format the card so that it’s prepared to accept your digital images. 
Look in your camera manual for information on how to do this formatting.
 
 Be careful not to format a card that already contains pictures, however. 
Formatting erases all the data on a card.
 
✓ Never remove the card while the camera is still recording or accessing the 
data on the card. (Most cameras display a little light or indicator to let you 
know when the card is in use.)
 
✓ Don’t shut off the camera while it’s accessing the card (although most 
cameras will prevent themselves from turning off if this is occurring).
 
✓ Avoid touching the contact areas 
of the card. On an SD card, for 
example, the little gold strips are 
the no-touch zone, as shown in 
Figure 2-1. On a CompactFlash 
card, make sure that the little 
holes on the edge of the card 
aren’t obstructed with dirt or 
anything else. (Most cards ship 
with a little flyer that alerts you 
to the sensitive spots on a card.)
 
✓ Some types of cards, such as 
Secure Digital cards, have a 
locking feature. By sliding a 
little switch on the card, you 
can prevent access to the card, 
which means that no files can 
be erased or added. Figure 2-1 
gives you a look at the lock.
Paws off!

prevents access to the card data.

 Chapter 2: Extra Goodies for Extra Fun
 
✓ If your card gets dirty, wipe it clean with a soft, dry cloth. Dirt and grime 
can affect the performance of memory cards.
 
✓ Try not to expose memory cards to excessive heat or cold, humidity, 
static electricity, and strong electrical noise. You don’t need to be overly 
paranoid, but use some common sense. Some “extreme” cards are avail-
able, made primarily for working in very high/low temperatures.
 
✓ Ignore rumors about airport security scanners destroying data on 
memory cards. Although scanners can damage film, they do no harm to 
digital media, whether in checked or carry-on bags.
 
✓ To keep your cards safe while 
not in use, store them in their 
original plastic sleeves or 
boxes. Or, for a handy way to 
store and carry multiple cards, 
invest in a memory card wallet. 
The Tenba version shown in 
Figure 2-2 has compartments 
for batteries as well as memory 
cards (www.tenba.com).
Storing Your Picture Files
A hot topic in the world of profes-
sional photography is digital asset 
management, which is simply a fancy 
term referring to the storing and cat-
aloging of digital picture files. (If you 
want to be über-hip, you can refer to 
it as DAM — and, yes, it’s pronounced just like the four-letter word you used 
to get in trouble for saying as a kid.) Professional digital photographers accu-
mulate huge collections of images and are always striving for better ways to 
save and inventory their assets.
Your image collection may not be as large as that of a professional photo-
grapher’s, but at some point, you, too, need to think about where to keep 
all those photos you take. You may be at that point now if you shoot high-
resolution pictures and your computer’s hard drive — the thing that stores 
all your data files — is already cramped for space.
The next several sections discuss the three most common strategies for 
expanding your digital closet space.

safe storage for spare cards.

Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
Adding more hard-drive space
If the existing hard drive on your computer is bursting at the seams, you can add 
a second (or third or fourth) drive for relatively little money. And you don’t even 
have to crack open the computer’s case to install an internal drive; plenty of 
companies make external drives that attach via a USB (Universal Serial Bus) con-
nection or, in some cases, via a second type of connection called FireWire.
Nor do you have to give up 
much desk space to add stor-
age; many drives are no larger 
than the size of a wallet. For 
example, Figure 2-3 shows the 
My Passport drive from Western 
Digital (www.westerndigital.
com), which holds 250GB of 
data and retails for about $130. 
The great thing about this type 
of drive is that it’s designed to 
be portable, so you can pack it 
in your camera bag when you 
travel as well as use it at home. 
(This unit does draw its power 
from the computer’s USB con-
nection, so you need to carry 
your laptop or have access to 
another computer at your desti-
nation, however).
 
Although adding a second hard drive may temporarily solve your picture 
storage concerns, you should not rely on this option for long-term, archival 
storage. Hard drives are mechanical devices, and as such, they can fail on 
occasion. And if your hard drive goes bad, all your picture files are likely 
to be lost. Keeping your pictures on a hard drive for quick and convenient 
access is fine, but always make backup copies on archival media. This same 
warning applies, by the way, to Zip drives, portable thumb drives, and flash 
memory keys.
At present, the two best options for archival storage are CDs and DVDs, dis-
cussed next.
CD storage
For the safest long-term storage of your image files, regularly back up the 
images stored on your computer’s hard drive (or other storage device) to a 
CD-ROM. If your computer is new, you likely have a built-in CD burner (that’s 
the techy way to say CD recorder). If not, you can add an external model to 
your system for under $100.
Western Digital Corporation
Figure 2-3: External drives such as the Western Digital 
My Passport can hold a lot of data in a unit about the 
size of your wallet.

 Chapter 2: Extra Goodies for Extra Fun
You do need to follow a couple of precautions to get the longest life span 
from your CDs:
 
✓ Buy disks labeled CD-R, not CD-RW. The first type can’t be erased, 
whereas data on CD-RW discs can be overwritten. In addition, some 
manufacturers say that their archival-grade CD-Rs have life expectan-
cies of as much as 100 years, while CD-RWs are said to survive about 
30 years. Those claims are the subject of some pretty hot debate right 
now — and if you ask around, you’re sure to hear horror stories of CDs 
going bad. Whether the problem stems from the CD itself or mishandling 
by the user is the question. See the “CD-R or CD-RW?” sidebar for more 
information about types of CDs.
 
✓ Look for blank CDs that have a gold coating and are advertised as archi-
val quality. You pay more for the quality; archival discs cost about $1.50 
each, versus $1 or less for the non-archival versions. But the idea is to 
make sure your pictures last, right?
 
✓ Don’t use a permanent marker to write labels directly on the discs. The 
ink can damage the disc and the data stored on it.
 
✓ Just to be extra safe, burn two copies of CDs that contain your most pre-
cious photographic memories. That way, if one disc gets scratched or 
lost, you have a backup to your backup. 
CD-R or CD-RW?
Two types of recordable CDs exist: CD-R and 
CD-RW. The R stands for recordable; RW stands 
for rewriteable. Most CD burners can do either 
dance.
With CD-R, you can record data until the disc is 
full. But you can’t delete files to make room for new 
ones — after you fill the disc once, you’re done. 
On the plus side, your images can never be acci-
dentally erased. With CD-RW, your CD works just 
like most other storage mediums. You can get rid of 
files you no longer want and store new files in their 
place. However, you shouldn’t rely on CD-RWs for 
archiving purposes. For one thing, you can acci-
dentally overwrite or erase an important image 
file. For another, data on CD-RWs starts to degrade 
after about 30 years, while archival-quality CD-Rs 
can last as long as 100 years. 
One other important factor distinguishes CD-R 
from CD-RW: compatibility with existing CD-ROM 
drives. If you’re creating CDs to share images 
with other people, you should know that those 
people need multiread CD drives to access files 
on a CD-RW. This type of CD drive is being imple-
mented in new computer systems, but most older 
systems do not have multiread drives. Older com-
puters can usually read CD-Rs without problems, 
however. (Depending on the recording software 
you use, you may need to format and record the 
disc using special options that ensure compatibil-
ity with older CD drives.)

42
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
Burning your own CDs is much easier than in years past, thanks to software 
that walks you through the process. Still, if you’re not comfortable with the 
job, you may prefer to let the professionals do your CD burning. Most retail 
photo labs and even superstore photo departments (such as Costco and 
 Wal-mart) can burn CDs from camera memory cards.
A bigger drawback to the CD solution — and one not so easily overcome — is 
that CDs can hold only about 650MB of data. If you’re shooting with a high-
resolution camera, you can fill up a CD in no time. So for non-critical images, 
you may want to back up your files to DVD instead, as explained next.
 
For the ultimate in archiving safety, always print your best pictures, too. That 
way, if something does go wrong with the digital file, you can scan the print 
and create a new digital copy. You can make prints easily and cheaply at 
any retail lab if you don’t care to do it yourself. See Chapter 10 for help with 
printing.
DVD storage
Close cousins to the CD burner, DVD burners enable you to record your 
photos onto a DVD (digital video disc). What’s the difference between CDs 
and DVDs? Capacity, for one. A standard single-layer DVD stores 4.7GB of 
data, while a CD holds about 650MB. 
That’s the good news about DVDs. But this technology has some complica-
tions, too: 
 
✓ Blank DVDs currently aren’t available with the archival gold coating 
that’s offered on some CDs. So the longevity of DVDs may not equal that 
of those archival CDs.
 
✓ Although most computers now have a DVD drive, not all systems have 
a DVD burner. If the DVD drive on your computer just says DVD-ROM, it 
can read a DVD disc that has data or a movie on it. If it says DVD-R/RW, 
it can actually record onto a DVD disc.
 
✓ If you do have a DVD burner, check its manual to find out what flavor 
of blank DVDs to buy. Several DVD formats exist: DVD+R, DVD-R, single 
layer, dual-layer, and so on.
 
✓ Although many DVD drives can use all the various types of DVDs, not all 
can. That means that accessing your DVD files on computers other than 
the one you used to burn the disc isn’t always possible.
 
✓ As with CD archiving, don’t use the DVDs that have the RW distinction; 
data on those discs can be overwritten or erased. 

43
 Chapter 2: Extra Goodies for Extra Fun
On-the-Go Storage and Viewing
Even if you carry several large-capacity memory cards, you can fill them up 
quickly if you’re using a high-resolution camera or shooting Raw files. Simply 
buying more cards as you go may sound logical, but whenever possible, you 
really should download as soon as you fill a card. Memory cards have been 
known to fail and are easy to lose. And your camera could be lost or stolen, 
with all your photos in it. You might get a new camera, but you won’t have 
those photographs any more.
For times when you don’t want to travel with a computer, you can pack 
smaller, more portable storage options in your camera bag. Here are just a 
few of the alternatives:
 
✓ Portable hard drives: 
Several companies make 
portable storage units 
that can function inde-
pendently on the road 
and then serve as an 
external drive and card 
reader when connected 
to your computer at 
home. Figure 2-4 shows 
one option, the Digital 
Foci Photo Safe II (www.
digitalfoci.com). An 
80GB model will set you 
back about $140. 
 
✓ Drive and viewer 
combos: Some portable 
drives have screens on 
which you can review 
your pictures. This fea-
ture is especially great 
for photographers who 
work with clients in the 
field; you can show your 
work this way rather 
than pass your camera 
around after every shot. 
Figure 2-5 shows one 
such product, the Epson P-5000, which offers 80GB of storage space and 
can be had for about $600. (Digital Foci also offers some drive/viewer 
products.)

Figure 2-5: This portable storage unit from Epson has a large screen 
 
for viewing your pictures.
 
✓ Portable media players (PMPs): Among the most cool and useful acces-
sories for digital photography and travel in general, these snazzy gad-
gets come from several different companies in a variety of designs and 
with various features, but they almost always include the ability to 
store and play all kinds of digital media along with a bunch of other 
functions. One product in this category is the Creative Zen Vision W 
(www.creative.com), shown in Figure 2-6. This particular unit not only 
provides the features listed earlier, but also has a radio, a voice memo 
recorder, and Microsoft Outlook contact and organizer display capabili-
ties. A 60GB version of the product sells for about $400.
As you might expect, prices for all these devices vary greatly, depending on 
the storage capacity, the size of the screen, and other features. But keep in 
mind that when you get home from your travels, you usually can attach these 
on-the-go devices to a computer via a USB cable and use them as another 
desktop or laptop storage drive. 
 
Do be sure that whatever device you buy either offers a card slot for the type 
of memory card your camera uses (or that you can buy an adapter to make 
your card fit the slot) or can be connected directly to your computer via USB 
cable for image transfer. Also, note that some viewers can’t display images 
captured in the Camera Raw format, so if you prefer that format, read the fine 
print. Chapter 4 explains Camera Raw.

Protecting Your Camera
Perhaps the most important camera accessory you can buy is a camera bag, 
case, or other product that will keep your investment dry, cushioned, and 
easy to transport. Thousands of inventive gadgets and devices are available 
that not only protect your gear but also let you impress your family, friends, 
neighbors, and anyone else willing to pay attention.
Here’s just a sampling of what you can find in your local camera store (or 
favorite online store): 
 
✓ Camera bags and cases today come in virtually all sizes, shapes, and 
even colors (although a reliable camera-store source says that black 
is still by far the most popular color for a camera bag — go figure). 
Figure 2-7, for example, shows just a small assortment of styles from 
one manufacturer, LowePro (www.lowepro.com).
 
 If you choose a backpack-style bag, a design like the Flipside pack 
shown in Figure 2-7 is a good idea: While you’re wearing the pack, it 
can’t be opened from the back, so you don’t have to worry about some-
one reaching inside and snatching your camera while you’re not paying 
attention.

Figure 2-7: Five transport options from LowePro, shown left to right: Tasca (pink), 
 
Slingshot, Fastpack, Apex (lower), and Flipside. 
 
✓ For fashion-conscious photographers, a few manufacturers offer prod-
ucts that look more like stylish handbags than camera cases. Check out 
one of the offerings from Jill-e (www.jill-e.com), shown in Figure 2-8, for 
example.
 
✓ If you need to transport camera equipment and can’t actually carry it 
with you, you can choose from a number of very solid, watertight cases 
that cushion your gear in customizable foam and seal it from any poten-
tial outside hazard. Pelican Products (www.pelican.com) produces an 
extensive line; many professional photographers rely on this type of 
product when flying to ship expensive gear as checked baggage.

 Chapter 2: Extra Goodies for Extra Fun
 
✓ For point-and-shoot cameras, 
an interesting protective and 
universal case called a Wrap-Up 
from Made Products (www.
made-products.com) is avail-
able. You keep the case perma-
nently attached to your camera 
by means of the tripod mount. 
When you want to shoot, you 
just unwrap the case (you can 
still use a tripod with the case 
attached). When you’re done, 
you wrap it back up. Because 
the case never leaves the 
camera, it’s one less thing to 
misplace or leave behind by 
accident. Figure 2-9 offers a 
look.
 
✓ For photography in rugged con-
ditions, several companies sell 
products that protect and fit 
your camera like a glove, literally. GGI International (www.ggiinternational.
com) makes a wide variety of silicone skins that fully encase your camera, 
keeping out moisture and dirt, while still letting you operate it. Made 
Products (www.made-products.com) offers a line called Camera Armor 
that provides similar protection for dSLR owners, while Kata (www.
kata-bags.com) includes weather covers for shooting outdoors. 
Seeking Software Solutions
Flashy and sleek, digital cameras are the natural stars of the digital-imaging 
world. But without the software that lets you get to your images, your digital 
camera would be nothing more than an overpriced paperweight. Because you 
probably already own plenty of other had-to-have-it, never-use-it devices that 
serve as paperweights, the following sections introduce you to a few software 
products that help you get the most from your digital camera.
Image-editing software
Image-editing software lets you change your digital photos just about any 
way you see fit. You can
 
✓ Correct problems with brightness, contrast, color balance, and the like.
 
✓ Crop out excess background and get rid of unwanted image elements.
 
✓ Apply special effects, combine pictures into a collage, and explore 
countless other artistic notions.

Today’s computer stores, mail-order catalogs, and online shopping sites are 
stocked with an enormous array of photo-editing products. The next sections 
present some of the most popular options.
 
Be sure to also find out what software, if any, came with your camera. Many 
camera manufacturers provide a selection of photo-editing tools on the soft-
ware CD that ships in the camera box. Also note that many software compa-
nies post free, downloadable trial copies of their products on their Web sites.
Programs for beginners and casual photo editors
Several companies offer programs geared to the photo-editing novice or the 
digital photographer who only wants to perform simple photo surgery and 
creative artwork. Just a few choices in this category include
 
✓ ACDSee Photo Editor ($50, www.acdsystems.com)
 
✓ ArcSoft PhotoImpression ($50, www.arcsoft.com)
 
✓ Adobe Photoshop Elements ($99, www.adobe.com)
 
✓ Corel PhotoImpact X3 ($70, www.corel.com)
These programs provide all the basic image-correction tools that most casual 
photographers need, plus plenty of wizards (step-by-step on-screen guides), 
which walk you through different tasks. Figure 2-10, for example, shows the 
wizard feature of ACDSee Photo Editor.
Additionally, project templates simplify adding your photo to a greeting card, 
calendar, or photo collage, and you also get tools for creating slide shows, 
burning images to CDs, and more. And the nice thing about all the programs 
just listed is that although they provide easy, one-click corrections, they also 
offer some of the same higher-level tools that professionals use. So if you 
decide you’re ready to tackle some more advanced projects, you can do so 
without buying a new program.
 
However, not all programs aimed at the consumer market offer a wide range 
of tools, so read product reviews. Make sure the program enables you to do 
the things you have in mind. (See Chapter 13 for some Web sites where you 
can find this kind of information.) And keep in mind that if all you want to do 
is simple repairs, such as removing red-eye and cropping your photo, you 
may be able to get the job done just using the software shipped with your 
camera or some other free solution, such as Google’s Picasa (www.picasa.
com). Another possibility is a new Adobe service, Adobe Photoshop Express 
(www.photoshop.com), which offers tools that enable you to upload and edit 
your photos online and then post the results in Web albums.

Figure 2-10: Consumer photo-editing programs, such as ACDSee Photo Editor, make simple 
 
retouching projects easy. 
Programs for advanced users and pros
If you edit pictures on a daily basis or want a little more control over your 
images, you may want to move up the software ladder a notch. Advanced 
photo-editing programs provide you with more flexible, more powerful and, 
often, more convenient photo-editing tools than entry-level offerings.
 
The downside to advanced programs is that they can be intimidating to new 
users and require a high learning curve. You usually don’t get much onscreen 
assistance or any of the templates and wizards provided in beginner-level 
programs.
Figure 2-11, for example, offers a look at Adobe Photoshop CS3 (www.adobe.
com), the industry-standard professional photo editor. As you can see, the 
program interface isn’t exactly what you’d call intuitive. Expect to spend 
plenty of time with the program manual or a third-party book to become pro-
ficient at using the software tools.

 Figure 2-11: Adobe Photoshop is a top choice for serious imaging enthusiasts, but it has a 
steep price and steeper learning curve.
Of course, Photoshop is several hundred dollars more than the less-
advanced applications, too, selling for about $650. Fortunately, several good 
but less-expensive alternatives exist for users who don’t need Photoshop’s 
ultra-high power. Explore these options:
 
✓ ACDSee Pro ($130, www.acdsystems.com)
 
✓ Adobe Lightroom ($299, www.adobe.com)
 
✓ Apple Aperture, ($199, www.apple.com), shown in Figure 2-12

retouch lots of photos.
Specialty image software
In addition to programs designed for photo editing, you can find great pro-
grams geared to special needs and interests, including the following:
 
✓ Image-cataloging programs: These programs are designed to help you 
organize your pictures. For some recommendations, see Chapter 8, 
which goes into detail about downloading, organizing, and archiving 
your images.
 
✓ Slide show programs: These programs make it easy to produce multi-
media presentations featuring your photos. Most image-editing applica-
tions offer some kind of slide show capabilities, but a few programs are 
dedicated to slide shows. Photodex Corporation (www.photodex.com), 
for example, provides a range of products.
 
✓ Plug-ins: A plug-in is a sort of mini-program that adds functions to a 
larger photo-editing program. For example, Figure 2-13 offers a look at 
nik Color Efex Pro (www.nikmultimedia.com). This plug-in package lets 
you create effects similar to those produced by traditional camera fil-
ters, as well as cool special effects. It works with many popular photo 
editors, including Photoshop and Photoshop Elements.

52

 Figure 2-13: Special effects plug-ins, such as Color Efex Pro from nik multimedia, add more 
creative options to your photo-editing software.
 
 Frequently, plug-ins are made for specific applications; for example, 
Essentials for Adobe Photoshop Elements (www.ononesoftware.com) 
complements and enhances Elements’ capabilities to let you correct 
color, add frames, remove backgrounds, and enlarge lower-resolution 
images for printing in larger formats.
 
✓ Digital painting programs: With digital paint, you can create original 
artwork or use your photos to create images that have the look of tra-
ditional art media. Many image-editing applications offer special effects 
filters that let you do this to a degree, but a number of programs are 
designed from the get-go for painting. The most famous option — and 
as advanced as Photoshop in its own way — is Corel Painter. Figure 2-14 
shows only a fraction of the artistic tools available in this program.
 
✓ Scrapbooking software: Scrapbooking is a very popular category with 
a number of great applications. What you used to do with glue, scraps 
of paper, buttons, and ribbons, you can now do with special programs. 
Here are just two of the many scrapbooking programs available:
 
• Art Explosion Scrapbook Factory Deluxe ($40, www.nova
development.com)
 
• Creating Keepsakes Scrapbook Designer Deluxe by Encore, Inc. 
($40, www.broderbund.com)

Steadying Your Camera
For nighttime shots and other photos that require long exposure times, 
keeping your camera steady is essential. Otherwise, you run the risk of a 
blurry image because of camera shake. Here’s a look at some of the devices 
you can use any time you want to be sure that your camera remains abso-
lutely still:
 
✓ Traditional tripods: You can spend a little or a lot on a tripod, with 
models available for anywhere from $20 to several hundred dollars. At 
the higher end of the price range, you get a sturdier product, designed 
to safely hold heavier cameras, such as dSLR models. You also get con-
venience features, such as a quick-release plate for easily attaching and 

54
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
removing the camera from the tripod head. Typically, you buy the tripod 
base separately from the head, which gives you a little more flexibility in 
buying the components you like best. 
 
 Take your camera when you shop to see how well the tripod works with 
it. Set the tripod at its maximum height, push down on the top camera 
platform, and try turning the tripod head as though it were a doorknob. 
If the tripod twists easily, or the legs begin to collapse, look for a differ-
ent model.
 
✓ Small solutions: A great 
option for times when 
you don’t want to carry 
around a full-size tripod 
is a product like the Joby 
Gorillapod (www.joby.
com). Made of stiff but 
flexible gripping legs, it 
can stand as a short tripod 
or wrap around something 
and hold on — such as a 
tree, as shown in Figure 
2-15. The Gorillapod 
comes in a variety of sizes, 
shapes, and colors for all 
types of cameras.
 
 Another small solution 
with a similar name, The Pod 
(www.thepod.ca) is a beanbag-
like platform that you can use 
to steady the camera on uneven 
surfaces and at various angles, 
as shown in Figure 2-16.
 
✓ Monopods: Another way to be 
portable but stable is to use a 
monopod, a collapsible stick 
that lets you hold your camera 
steady but doesn’t stand on 
its own. You frequently see 
sports photographers at foot-
ball games traipsing around the 
Joby, Inc.

sidelines with a big camera, big lens, and a monopod. If you get tired of 
holding your camera, whatever its size, these are useful and easy to tote 
around.
 
✓ Hybrids: Some innovative tripod/monopod hybrids exist; they look like 
monopods, but you can pop out three mini-legs to let them stand on 
their own.
 
 A hybrid isn’t as stable as a full tripod, so don’t stand too far from your 
camera with a strong wind blowing.
Grabbing a Few Handy Extras
To round out your shopping spree, here are a few more accessories that just 
don’t seem to fit neatly anywhere else:
 
✓ Lensbaby: If you’re shooting a dSLR (meaning you use interchangeable 
lenses), you might enjoy trying a really different kind of lens such as the 
Lensbaby (actually, there are several Lensbaby models). It attaches to 
your camera like any other lens, but that’s where the similarity stops. It 
looks more like a part to a vacuum cleaner with a corrugated hose and 
a mounting plate on one end, and a small lens element on the other, as 
shown on the left in Figure 2-17. You focus it and vary your image effects 
by pulling, pushing, and literally twisting and turning the lens body. 
You can get effects where only a part of the image is clear and the rest 
is blurred in a way that’s nothing like a typical shallow depth-of-field 
shot, as shown on the right. Lensbabies sell for between $150 and $270, 
depending on various options (www.lensbabies.com).

✓ Tripod easy-orientation brackets: Many inexpensive tripods and mono-
pods lack the type of rotating head that makes it easy to change the 
camera from a horizontal orientation to a vertical one. One solution is the 
ALZO Camera Flipper (www.alzodigital.com), which is a small bracket that 
fits between the tripod head and your camera. You still mount the camera 
to the tripod in the horizontal orientation, but you can open the bracket 
to shift the camera to a vertical position at any time. 
 
✓ Graphics tablet: A tablet 
enables you to edit photos 
using a stylus (like a pen with-
out ink) instead of a mouse. If 
you do a good deal of intricate 
touch-up work on your pictures 
or you enjoy digital painting or 
drawing, you’ll wonder what 
you ever did without a tablet. 
Wacom, the industry leader 
in the tablet arena, offers a 
basic tablet called the Bamboo 
Fun, shown in Figure 2-18. The 
Bamboo Fun comes with both 
a stylus and a cordless mouse 
so you can switch back and 
forth easily between the two 
devices. Prices vary depending 
on the tablet size; the smallest 
model sells for about $100. For 
details, visit www.wacom.com.
 
✓ Camera strap replacement: 
Here’s a very simple but really useful and innovative alternative to the 
conventional camera strap. The R-Strap series of products from Black 
Rapid (www.blackrapid.com) is designed primarily for dSLR cameras 
(although they could be used, in theory, for most point-and-shoot 
models as well). The R-Strap attaches to the screw mount where you 
attach the camera to a tripod. The strap lets you hang the camera by 
your side — instead of dangling from your neck — and with it, you can 
immediately swing your camera to shooting position.
 
✓ LCD shade/magnifier: Ever tried to look at your camera’s LCD to check 
your photo, but couldn’t see it because of the bright sunlight? One prac-
tical solution is the Hoodman HoodLoupe (www.hoodmanusa.com). 
The HoodLoupe is basically a small magnifying glass in a black case that

hangs around your neck. When you 
take a photo and want to view it, you 
put the rectangular end up against

the viewfinder on the HoodLoupe, 
as shown in Figure 2-19. It enables 
you to see your images in even the 
harshest sunlight, it doesn’t require

In This Chapter
▶ Setting up your camera
▶ Setting focus and exposure automatically
▶ Getting better results by using the automatic scene modes
▶ Reviewing critical picture-taking settings
D
igital camera manufacturers work hard to create a good “out of box” 
experience — that is, to make your first encounter with your camera 
fun, easy, and rewarding. To that end, cameras leave the factory in automatic 
picture-taking mode, using default settings that are likely to produce a good 
picture the first time you press the shutter button.
Before you snap that first shot, however, scan the information in this 
chapter, which offers advice on setting up your new camera. 
This chapter also introduces you to some common autoex-
posure modes, including scene modes designed to best 
capture certain types of pictures, such as portraits and 
landscapes.
Setting Up Your New Camera
Every camera is different, so providing specifics on 
setting up your particular model is impossible. But 
the following list contains a few general steps that you 
should take to ensure that your “out of box” experience 
runs smoothly and that the camera is ready to perform 
its picture-taking magic for you:
 
✓ Most cameras come with a quick-start guide to walk you 
through basic setup procedures. Included somewhere in that guide or 
in the first few pages of your manual, you should find a list of all the 

60
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
components that are sup-
posed to come with the 
camera. It’s a good idea 
to unpack and examine 
everything, as shown in 
Figure 3-1, to make sure 
that nothing was omitted 
from the box. 
 
✓ Look for a card or docu-
ment that enables you to 
register your purchase 
with the manufacturer. 
You also may be able to 
register online. Either way, 
do take the time to regis-
ter the camera; the camera 
company needs your name 
and contact information 
in order to notify you of 
any updates to the camera 
firmware (internal 
software).
 
✓ If your camera comes with 
rechargeable batteries, charge them fully before you do anything else. 
The batteries might have a little juice in them without charging, but it’s 
really not a good idea to start up the camera that way — doing so can 
cause the batteries to have a permanently limited charge.
 
✓ Whatever type of batteries your camera uses, be sure to load them cor-
rectly with the positive (+) and minus (–) sides correctly positioned. 
Loading them incorrectly can damage your camera. 
 
✓ Another good thing to do right away is to attach your camera strap — and 
get into the habit of using it when you shoot. The last thing you want to 
do is drop your new camera while trying to figure out its functions!
 
✓ Some cameras ship with a memory card (that’s the thing that stores 
your pictures). The type of card varies from camera to camera, but most 
are small enough to get lost as you rip into the camera box, so use cau-
tion. If your camera doesn’t come with a card, check the manual to find 
out what type to buy. (Chapter 2 offers some advice on this purchase.)
 
✓ Be careful when putting the memory card in the camera. Look at your 
quick-start guide to see which direction to orient the card, and use 
gentle pressure when inserting it.

inspect all the components.

 Chapter 3: First Steps, First Shots
With batteries installed, card inserted, and strap attached, the camera should 
now be ready to go. But before you switch it on, grab your manual and keep it 
handy as you explore the rest of this chapter, which explains some common 
setup options and guides you through taking your first pictures. 
Adjusting the viewfinder to your eyesight
If your camera has a viewfinder, 
chances are that it also has a view-
finder diopter adjustment control, or 
something with a similar name. This 
control is a little knob or wheel, usu-
ally placed along the edge of the view-
finder, that enables you to adjust the 
viewfinder to your eyesight. Figure 3-2 
offers a close-up look at how this con-
trol appears on some Canon dSLRs. 
If you don’t take this step, then what 
you see through the viewfinder may 
not be an accurate reflection of the 
scene, focusing wise.
Although you should check your 
manual for details, you usually adjust 
the viewfinder in this fashion: Point 
the camera at a plain surface, such 
as a wall or sheet of paper. Then look 
through the viewfinder and concentrate on the little marks inside the view-
finder that indicate the camera’s possible focusing areas. (These vary from 
camera to camera.) Concentrating just on those marks — not on the scene in 
front of the lens — adjust the diopter control until the marks appear sharply 
focused. If no amount of adjustment makes things sharp, you may be able to 
buy a viewfinder accessory that allows a greater amount of adjustment.
Note that if you wear glasses and will wear them when using your camera, 
you should have them on when you adjust the diopter.
Exploring basic setup options
Somewhere on the back of your camera, you should find a Menu button that 
displays the camera menus on the monitor. And on one or more of those 
menus, you should find a few options for customizing the camera. Again, 
your manual contains specifics, but here are a few bits of advice regarding 
the most common setup options:
 
✓ Date and time: This setting is perhaps the most critical of the basic 
operation controls. Your camera records the current date and time in 
the image file, along with details about what other camera settings were 
Diopter adjustment control

your vision. 

62
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
in force when you shot the picture. In many photo editors and image 
browsers, you can view this information, known as metadata.
 
 Having the correct date and time in the image file enables you to have 
a permanent record of when each picture was taken. More importantly, 
in many photo programs, you can search for all the pictures taken on a 
particular date. For example, in Adobe Photoshop Elements, you can dis-
play a calendar view, as shown in Figure 3-3, and click on a date to view 
thumbnails of all the pictures you shot on that date.
 
✓ Format memory card: When you put a new memory card into your 
camera, it’s always a good idea to format the card. Formatting erases 
any data on the card and sets it up for the specific type of camera 
you’re using. This step is especially critical if you use the same card 
for different types of cameras or other devices, such as an MP3 player. 
Otherwise, your picture data can be lost or become corrupted.
 
 Before you format, though, make sure that you don’t have any data on 
the card that you want to save; remember, this process wipes every-
thing off the card. 
 
 
Figure 3-3: Because the date is recorded with the picture file, you can easily track down 
 
pictures taken during a certain period.

63
 Chapter 3: First Steps, First Shots
 
✓ Auto shut-off: To conserve battery power, many cameras turn off auto-
matically after a few minutes of inactivity. The drawback is that you can 
miss fleeting photographic opportunities — by the time you restart the 
camera, your subject may be gone. If you’re not happy with the way this 
option works, see whether you can adjust the length of time that the 
camera must be idle before auto shutdown occurs; some cameras also 
give you the option of turning the feature off entirely.
 
✓ Shoot without memory card: Most cameras will let you take a photo 
without a memory card. The image is stored in a tiny bit of internal 
camera memory but usually isn’t retained for more than a few minutes. 
(The point of the function is to enable camera salespeople to demon-
strate cameras without having to keep memory cards in all of them.) If 
you’re worried that you might shoot all day and forget that you didn’t 
insert a memory card, turn off this function!
 
✓ Instant review: After you take a picture, your camera may display it auto-
matically for a few seconds. On some cameras, you can’t take another 
picture until the review period is passed, and if that’s the case with your 
model, you may want to turn off instant review when you’re trying to cap-
ture fast-paced subjects. And because monitors consume power, also turn 
off instant review if you’re worried about running out of battery juice. You 
may also be able to adjust the length of the instant-review period. 
 
✓ Monitor brightness: Adjusting the monitor brightness can make pic-
tures easier to view in bright light. But be careful: The monitor may then 
give you a false impression of your image exposure. Before you put your 
camera away, double-check your pictures in a setting where you can use 
the default brightness level. As another alternative, you may be able to 
display an exposure guide called a histogram; see Chapter 5 for details.
 
✓ Sound effects: Digital cameras are big on sounds: Some play a little 
ditty when the camera is turned on. Some beep to let you know that the 
camera’s autofocus or autoexposure mechanism has done its thing, and 
others emit a little “shutter” sound as you take the picture. There have 
even been cameras that said “Goodbye” in this odd little digitized voice 
when you turned the camera off. Before heading to a wedding or any 
other event where your camera’s bells and whistles won’t be appreci-
ated, check your camera menu to see whether you can silence them or 
at least turn down the volume.
 
 Some cameras offer a Museum mode. When you choose this setting, the 
camera automatically stifles its vocal chords and also disables the flash 
because flash photography isn’t permitted in most museums.
 
✓ File numbering: Cameras assign filenames to photos, often beginning 
with a few letters and a symbol (for example, IMG_0023.JPG, DSCN0038.
JPG, or something similar). You can often set up your camera to number 
files beginning with certain numbers, and some cameras actually let you 
put in a few of your own letters with the file numbers (although it’s usu-
ally very limited).

64
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
 Some cameras have an option that automatically restarts the file-
numbering sequence when you swap out a memory card. For example, 
if the current memory card contains a file named IMG_0001.JPG, and you 
put in a new memory card, the camera assigns that same filename to the 
first picture you take. Obviously, this option can lead to trouble after 
you download pictures to your computer because you can wind up with 
multiple pictures that share the same name. So check your manual to 
find out whether this option exists on your camera, and if so, avoid it.
 
✓ Auto rotate: You may be able to choose whether you want the camera 
to automatically rotate vertically oriented pictures so they appear as 
shown on the left in Figure 3-4. If you don’t choose this option, the image 
appears on its side, as shown on the right in the figure. 
 
 When you turn on auto-rotation, the camera stores the picture-orientation 
information as part of the data file. Some photo software can read that 
orientation data, too, so that when you display the picture on your com-
puter monitor, the image also appears in its proper orientation.

Taking Your First Pictures
After completing basic camera setup and familiarizing yourself with your 
camera’s buttons and menus, you’re ready for the big moment: time to actu-
ally take some pictures.
Although you no doubt can figure out the basics of shooting with your digital 
camera on your own, the following sections offer some bits of information 
that can help you get better results from the get-go.

65
 Chapter 3: First Steps, First Shots
Setting the focus mode: Auto or manual?
Most point-and-shoot digital cameras offer only autofocus, but a few do 
permit manual focusing. When you’re just getting comfortable with your 
camera, stick with autofocus — with manual focusing on a point-and-shoot 
camera, you usually have to dig through menus and specify an exact camera-
to-subject distance, which is tricky.
If you own a dSLR, you can either take advantage of autofocus or focus manu-
ally by twisting a focusing ring on the lens barrel. Typically, you use a switch 
on the lens barrel or the camera body to specify which focusing option you 
want to use. Look for a switch that has the labels A or AF and M or MF.
 
On some dSLR lenses, you also get a switch for enabling or disabling image 
stabilization, a feature designed to prevent blurring caused by camera move-
ment that can occur when you handhold the camera. See Chapter 1 for a 
complete explanation of this feature, and check your camera or lens manual 
to find out how to best take advantage of it with your equipment.
More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, either in autofocus 
or manual focus mode, you determine only the 
point of sharpest focus. The distance to which 
that sharp-focus zone extends — what photog-
raphers call the depth of field — depends in 
part on the aperture setting, which is an expo-
sure control. And the aperture setting varies 
depending on the automated photography mode 
you select.
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so 
that background objects are softly focused — an 
artistic choice that most people prefer for por-
traits. On the flip side of the coin, the Landscape 
setting selects an aperture that produces a large 
depth of field so that both foreground and back-
ground objects appear sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter 
speed, plays a focus role when you photograph 
moving objects. Moving objects appear blurry 
at slow shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds, 
they appear sharply focused. On your camera, 
the Sports shooting mode automatically selects 
a high shutter speed to help you “stop” action, 
producing blur-free shots of the subject.
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard 
against allover blurring that results when the 
camera is moved during the exposure. The 
faster the shutter speed, the shorter the expo-
sure time, which reduces the time that you 
need to keep the camera absolutely still. Using 
a tripod is the best way to avoid the problem 
when you use a slow shutter speed. 
For an explanation of the role of shutter speed 
and aperture in exposure, check out Chapter 5. 
Chapter 6 discusses various issues related to 
focusing. 

66
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
Choosing an automatic exposure mode
Most digital cameras offer a variety of automatic exposure modes, which you 
select either via menus or an external dial or switch. In all these modes, the 
camera handles critical exposure decisions, such as selecting the aperture 
setting and shutter speed, leaving you free to concentrate on composition 
and your subject. Shooting in automatic mode also typically means that the 
camera handles most other settings, too, including those that affect color and 
autofocusing.
Although the number and type of automatic exposure modes vary from 
camera to camera, they can be broken down into two general categories:
 
✓ Full Auto: This setting is designed to deliver good results no matter 
what your subject. Think of it as one-size-fits-all shooting.
 
✓ Scene modes: These settings are specialized modes geared to specific 
subjects — people, landscapes, and so on.
The next few sections offer some more information about shooting in Full 
Auto mode and give you an overview of four of the most common scene 
modes (Portrait, Landscape, Close-up, and Sports).
 
One word of advice before you move on, though: Automatic exposure modes 
are great in that you don’t have to know much about photography or have to 
worry about setting a bunch of controls before you shoot. But the downside 
is that you typically lose access to some features that may be helpful for cap-
turing your subject. For example, the camera usually decides whether or not 
a flash is needed, and you can’t override that decision. And some cameras 
don’t let you tweak color or exposure, either.
So if your camera offers more advanced exposure modes, such as aperture-
priority autoexposure or manual exposure, it’s worth your time to learn 
how to use them. They may take a while to fully grasp, but they make your 
life easier in the long run because you can easily tweak exposure, color, and 
focus settings to precisely suit your subject. See Chapters 5 through 7 for a 
look at the many picture-taking options you can access when you shift out of 
fully automatic exposure modes.
Full Auto mode
In this mode, the camera selects all settings based on the scene that it 
detects in front of the lens. Some cameras use different settings if they detect 
motion in the scene, for example, than if they detect a stationary subject. 
You may be able to specify the image resolution and a few other settings 
(explained later in this chapter), but for the most part, you get no input into 
how the picture is captured.

67
 Chapter 3: First Steps, First Shots
If you have exposure or color problems in this mode, check out Chapters 
5 and 6 to discover some possible remedies. But again, whether you have 
access to the techniques covered in those chapters depends on your camera 
and how it implements Full Auto mode.
Portrait mode
Portrait mode attempts to select 
exposure settings that produce a 
blurry background, which puts the 
visual emphasis on your subject, as 
shown in Figure 3-5. Keep in mind, 
though, that in certain lighting condi-
tions, the camera may not be able to 
choose the exposure settings that 
best produce the soft background. 
Additionally, the background blur-
ring requires that your subject be at 
least a few feet from the background. 
The extent to which the background 
blurs also depends on the other 
depth-of-field factors that you can 
explore in Chapter 6.
 
Keep in mind that you can use 
Portrait mode any time you want 
a slightly blurry background, not 
just for people pictures. Try this 
mode when shooting statues, still-
life arrangements (such as a vase of 
flowers on a kitchen table), insects, 
and the like.
Check your manual to find out 
what other image adjustments may 
be applied in Portrait mode. Some cameras, for example, tweak color and 
sharpness in a way designed to produce flattering skin tones and soften skin 
texture. And one more tip: If you’re not sure that your subject will remain 
motionless, the Sports mode, which is designed to capture moving subjects 
without blur, may deliver better results. 
Landscape mode
Whereas Portrait mode aims for a very shallow depth of field (small zone of 
sharp focus), Landscape mode, which is designed for capturing scenic vistas, 
city skylines, and other large-scale subjects, produces a large depth of field. 
Serge Timacheff
Figure 3-5: The portrait setting produces a 
softly focused background.

68
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
As a result, objects both 
close to the camera and at 
a distance appear sharply 
focused. Figure 3-6 offers 
an example; notice that 
the tree as well as the 
road and the ridges of the 
mountains far behind it 
are all in focus. 
Like Portrait mode, 
Landscape mode achieves 
the greater depth of field 
by manipulating the 
exposure settings — 
specifically, the aperture, 
or f-stop setting. So the 
extent to which the camera 
can succeed in keeping 
everything in sharp focus 
depends on the available 
light. To fully understand 
this issue, see Chapter 5. 
And in the meantime, know 
that you also can extend 
depth of field by zooming 
out and moving farther 
from your subject, too.
On most cameras, Landscape mode also adjusts colors to emphasize blues 
and greens. If you don’t care for that color choice, you can try changing 
the camera’s white-balance setting, a color control covered in Chapter 6. 
However, some cameras put that control off limits in automatic exposure 
modes. Additionally, flash is usually disabled in Landscape mode, which 
presents a problem only if you need some extra light on an object in the front 
of the scene.
 
Again, think beyond the Landscape moniker when you look for good ways 
to put this mode to use: Try it when shooting long-range pictures of animals 
at the zoo, for example, so that critters both near and far appear sharp. It’s 
also good for shooting a group of people (such as a team sitting in bleachers) 
where you want to be able to see every smiling face crisply. 
Serge Timacheff
Figure 3-6: The landscape mode produces a large zone of 
sharp focus and also boosts color intensity slightly.

69
 Chapter 3: First Steps, First Shots
Close-up mode
On most cameras, this mode — also known as macro mode — is represented 
by a little flower icon. On some point-and-shoot cameras, selecting this mode 
enables you to focus at a closer distance than usual. For a dSLR, the close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you’re using. 
But in either scenario, your camera or lens manual should spell out exactly 
how close you can get to your subject.
Choosing this mode typically results in exposure settings designed to blur 
background objects so that they don’t compete for attention with your main 
subject. As with Portrait mode, though, how much the background blurs 
varies depending on the distance between your subject and the background 
as well as on the lighting conditions. 
For example, the amount of 
background blurring in the 
macro example shown in 
Figure 3-7 isn’t as great as 
in the earlier portrait exam-
ple because not as much 
distance exists between the 
subject and background. 
Should you prefer a greater 
or shorter depth of field, 
see Chapter 6 for other 
ways to adjust this aspect 
of your pictures.
As with the other scene 
modes, the camera may 
tweak colors slightly and 
may or may not allow you 
to use flash. The region of 
the frame that’s used to 
establish focus also varies, 
so check that manual.
Sports mode
Sports mode, sometimes 
also called Action mode, 
results in a number of set-
tings that can help you 
photograph moving objects such as the wind turbines in Figure 3-8. First, the 
camera selects a fast shutter speed, which is needed to “stop motion.” Shutter 
speed is an exposure control that you can explore in Chapter 5.
Serge Timacheff
Figure 3-7: Close-up mode also produces short depth of 
field. Notice how all the branches and leaves behind the 
lemon tree are blurred. 

70
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
Serge Timacheff
 
Figure 3-8: To capture moving subjects without blur, try Sports mode — even if you’re 
 
not shooting a sporting event.
With some cameras, dialing in Sports mode also selects some other set-
tings that facilitate action shooting. For example, if your camera offers burst 
mode or continuous capture, in which you can record multiple images with 
one press of the shutter button, Sports mode may automatically shift to that 
gear. And flash is usually disabled, which can be a problem in low-light situa-
tions; however, it also enables you to shoot successive images more quickly 
because the flash needs a brief period to recycle between shots. 
The other critical thing to understand about Sports mode is that whether the 
camera can select a shutter speed fast enough to stop motion depends on 
the available light and the speed of the subject itself. On the other hand, a 
little blurring in an action photo can sometimes be acceptable and add to the 
effect of motion.
To fully understand shutter speed, visit Chapter 5. And for more tips on 
action photography, check out Chapter 7.
Reviewing other critical capture settings
In addition to choosing an exposure mode, you should review the following 
additional picture-taking settings before you shoot. Later chapters get into 
these options in more detail, but here’s a quick introduction to the most criti-
cal ones so that your first photos are at least close to being perfect:

71
 Chapter 3: First Steps, First Shots
 
✓ Resolution: This option determines how many pixels the image will con-
tain. Pixels are the tiny colored tiles from which all digital pictures are 
created. The more pixels you have, the larger you can print your photos 
and expect good picture quality.
 
 Most cameras enable you to select from two or more resolution settings, 
each of which creates the image using a different number of pixels. For 
now, just select the camera’s top resolution setting — it’s better to have 
too many pixels than too few. You can also refer to the Cheat Sheet at 
the front of the book to find out how many pixels you need to produce 
different sizes of prints. 
 
 The resolution option is presented in different ways, depending on the 
camera. You may be given a choice of pixel dimensions or total pixel 
count in megapixels (1 megapixel equals 1 million pixels). Some cam-
eras take another approach, using vague option names such as Large, 
Medium, or Small. And sometimes, you get all three methods combined, 
A Parallax! A Parallax!
You compose your photo perfectly. The light is 
fine, the focus is fine, and all other photographic 
planets appear to be in alignment. But after you 
snap your picture and view the image on the 
camera monitor, the framing is off, as though 
your subject repositioned itself while you 
weren’t looking. You’re not the victim of some 
cruel digital hoax — just a photographic phe-
nomenon known as a parallax error.
On most point-and-shoot cameras, the view-
finder looks out on the world through a sepa-
rate window from the camera lens. Because the 
viewfinder is located an inch or so above or to 
the side of the lens, it sees your subject from 
a slightly different angle than the lens. But the 
image is captured from the point of view of the 
lens, not the viewfinder.
When you look through your viewfinder, you 
may see some lines near the corners of the 
frame. The lines indicate the boundaries of the 
frame as seen by the camera lens. Pay atten-
tion to these framing cues, or you may wind up 
with pictures that appear to have been lopped 
off along one edge.
The closer you are to your subject, the bigger 
the parallax problem becomes, whether you use 
a zoom lens or simply position the camera lens 
closer to your subject. Some cameras provide a 
second set of framing marks in the viewfinder 
to indicate the framing boundaries that apply 
when you’re shooting close-up shots. Check 
your camera manual to determine which fram-
ing marks mean what. (Some markings have to 
do with focusing and exposure, not framing.)
Another solution is to simply use the monitor to 
frame your shots; the monitor reflects the image 
as seen by the lens. (On some cameras, the LCD 
monitor turns on automatically when you switch 
to macro mode for close-up shooting.)

Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
as in Figure 3-9, which shows 
how the resolution setting is pre-
sented on some Nikon cameras. 
With some cameras, you get 
one set of controls for adjusting 
both resolution and file format, 
explained next. Your camera 
manual should spell out exactly 
how you go about changing the 
resolution and how many pixels 
you get with each setting.
 
✓ File format: Chapter 4 fully 
explores the issue of file formats, 
which simply refers to the type 
of data file the camera produces. 
For now, consult your camera 
manual to find out what setting results in a JPEG (jay-pegg) file at the 
highest image quality. (It will be the JPEG setting that produces the larg-
est file.) This setting ensures the best quality images without some of 
the complications created by the other file type that may be available to 
you, called Camera Raw.
 
 Again, your camera might com-
bine the resolution and format 
options into one setting. For 
example, on some Canon cam-
eras, you select Large/Fine to dial 
in the highest resolution with 
the top-quality JPEG setting, as 
shown in Figure 3-10. (As you can 
see, the symbols representing 
the settings are sometimes pretty 
cryptic; again, keep that camera 
manual handy!)
 
✓ ISO: This setting, fully explained 
in Chapter 5, adjusts the camera’s 
sensitivity to light. The higher 
the ISO number, the less light the camera needs to expose the image. 
But higher ISO settings also can result in a speckly looking defect called 
noise. So whenever possible, use the lowest ISO your camera offers. 
Note that in automatic exposure modes, the camera may lock you out of 
controlling ISO, however, and raise and lower the ISO according to the 
lighting conditions.

how large you can print your picture.

resolution and format together.

 Chapter 3: First Steps, First Shots
 
✓ Shutter-release mode: Many cameras offer a choice of shutter-release 
modes, which simply control what happens when you press the shutter 
button. Common modes include:
 
• One-shot or single mode: The camera records one image every time 
you fully depress the shutter button. In other words, this is normal 
photography mode.
 
• Continuous or burst mode: You press and hold the shutter button 
down to record a continuous series of images at a rapid pace. The 
camera keeps recording pictures until you let up on the shutter 
button.
 
• Self-timer mode: You fully press and release the shutter button, and 
the image is captured several seconds later. (This is the mode you 
use when you want to put yourself in the picture.)
 
• Remote-control mode: Some cameras enable you to trigger the shut-
ter button with a remote control unit; if so, this mode sets up the 
camera for that option.
 
 The name of the option that controls the shutter-release mode varies; 
it may be named something like Drive mode, Release mode, or Shooting 
mode, for example.
Pressing the shutter button
With all your initial picture-taking settings dialed in, all that’s left to do is 
frame the shot and press the shutter button.
 
Any time you take advantage of autoexposure, autofocus, or both, however, 
the way you press the shutter button is critical. In order for the automatic 
mechanisms to work, you must use the following two-stage approach:
 
1. After framing the shot, press and hold the shutter button halfway 
down.
 
 The camera’s autofocus and autoexposure meters begin to do their 
thing. In dim light, the flash may turn on or pop up if the camera thinks 
additional light is needed.
 
 Be sure to check your manual to verify how your camera establishes 
focus. In some cases, for example, you need to compose your image so 
that your subject is within a certain area of the frame. And some cam-
eras adjust their autofocusing behavior depending on whether they 
think you’re shooting a still or moving subject. For still subjects, the 
camera may lock its focus when you depress the shutter button halfway. 
But if the camera senses motion, it may continually adjust focus from 
the time you depress the shutter button halfway.

74
Part I: Peering Through the Digital Viewfinder 
 
 When focus is established, the camera will likely beep at you, assuming 
that you didn’t silence its voice during setup. 
 
2. Press the shutter button the rest of the way and then release it to 
record the image.
 
 While the camera sends the image data to the camera memory card, 
another light on your camera may illuminate. Don’t turn off the camera 
or remove the memory card while the lamp is lit, or you may damage 
both camera and card.
 
 When the recording process is finished, the picture appears briefly on 
the LCD display. If you want a longer look at the image, you’ll need to 
put the camera into playback mode.
If the picture didn’t work out as planned, move on to Part II of the book to 
discover all the myriad ways you may be able to manipulate exposure, color, 
focus, and other characteristics of your photo.

D
igital cameras pack features and technology 
galore tightly into a small space. Whether 
you’re using a point-and-shoot or a digital SLR, 
or something in-between, your photographic 
skills and the images they produce will grow by 
understanding more about how to use your digital 
marvel. 
To that end, Chapter 4 explains the digital side of 
digital photography, explaining such critical con-
cepts as resolution and ﬁ le format. Chapter 5 pro-
vides you with the fundamentals of exposure, 
discussing such issues as f-stops, shutter speeds, 
and ISO as well as sharing some tips on using 
autoexposure features and ﬂ ash. Chapter 6 covers 
focus and color, and then Chapter 7 ties every-
thing together by summing up techniques you can 
use to get the best shot every time. 
By studying these chapters and putting at least a 
few of the ideas into practice each time you pick up 
your camera, you can take full advantage of your 
photographic investment. And more important, 
your percentage of good shots — no, great shots — 
will increase. Heck, even your family might be 
impressed with a shot or two before long.

f discussions of a technical nature nauseate you, keep a stomach-soothing 
potion handy while you read this chapter. The following pages are full 
of the kind of technical babble that makes science teachers drool 
but leaves us ordinary mortals feeling a little queasy.
However, you’re more likely to be a successful digital 
photographer by becoming acquainted with the sci-
ence behind the art. To that end, this chapter pro-
vides you with a foundation in the digital side of 
digital photography, exploring such important digi-
tal-capture concepts as resolution, file formats, bit 
depth, and more. It’s not an exercise for the faint 
of heart, but it’s critical to getting the best results 
from your digital camera.
Turning Light into Pixels
 
A traditional camera creates an image by allowing light to pass 
through a lens onto film. The film is coated with light-sensitive chemi-
cals, and wherever light hits the coating, a chemical reaction takes place, 
recording a latent image. During the film development stage, more chemicals 
transform the latent image into a printed photograph.

78
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Digital cameras also use 
light to record images, but 
instead of film, digital cam-
eras capture pictures using 
image sensors, which is a 
fancy way of saying “light-
sensitive computer chips.” 
Currently, these chips come 
in two flavors: CCD, which 
stands for charge-coupled 
device, and CMOS, which 
is short for complementary 
metal-oxide semiconductor. 
(No, Billy, that information won’t be on the test.) Figure 4-1 gives you a look 
at some image sensors from Kodak.
Although CCD and CMOS chips differ in their design and construction, both 
chips do essentially the same thing. When struck by light, they emit an elec-
trical charge, which is analyzed and converted into digital image data by a 
processor inside the camera. The more light, the stronger the charge.
As the final step in the chain, the picture file is saved to a removable memory 
card. The type of card varies depending on the camera; the most common 
are CompactFlash, Secure Digital (or SD, for short), and, on Sony cameras, 
Memory Stick.
To access the images that your camera records, you just transfer them from 
the memory card to your computer. (Chapter 8 shows you how.) You then can 
use any number of software programs to view, edit, organize, print, and e-mail 
your pictures. Or you can take advantage of the many devices that enable you 
to view or print your photos directly from a memory card, from GPS units that 
let you display favorite photos in your car to pocketbook-size printers that can 
produce pro-quality prints — all with no computer required.
Of course, what you’ve just read only touches the surface of how digital cam-
eras work. For an idea of just how complex the whole business really is, check 
out Figure 4-2, which shows a cutaway view of a Canon digital SLR camera 
(dSLR, in photo lingo). Suffice it to say that digital cameras are complex blends 
of computer technology and traditional photographic technology.
Fortunately, you don’t need to explore the inner workings of your camera any 
further to take great pictures. In fact, perhaps the most important lesson to 
take from this discussion is that a digital camera is a sensitive piece of elec-
tronic equipment and, as such, should be protected from extreme tempera-
tures, shock, water, and all the other hazards that can damage any high-tech 
tool.

Exploring the World of Digital Color
Like film cameras, digital cameras create images by reading and recording 
the light reflected from a scene. But how does the camera translate that 
brightness information into the colors you see in the final photograph?
The next sections explain this mystery and decode some of the color-related 
techie terms you may encounter when you browse digital photography maga-
zines, Web sites, and other forums.
RGB: A new way of thinking about color
A digital camera translates light into color pretty much the same way as the 
human eye. To understand the process, you first need to know that light 
can be broken into three color ranges: reds, greens, and blues. Inside your 
eyeball, you have three receptors corresponding to those color ranges. Each 
receptor measures the brightness of the light for its particular range. Your 
brain then combines the information from the three receptors into one multi-
colored image in your head.

80
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Because most of us didn’t grow up 
thinking about mixing red, green, 
and blue light to create color, this 
concept can be a little hard to grasp. 
Here’s an analogy that may help. 
Imagine that you’re standing in a 
darkened room and have one flash-
light that emits red light, one that 
emits green light, and one that emits 
blue light. Now suppose that you 
point all the flashlights at the same 
spot on a white wall. Where the 
three lights overlap, you get white, 
as shown in Figure 4-3. Where no 
light falls, you get black.
In the illustration, the flashlights 
emit full-intensity light with no fade 
over the spread of the beam, so mixing the three lights produces only three 
additional colors: magenta, cyan, yellow. But by varying the intensity of the 
beams, you can create every color that the human eye can see.
Just like your eyes, a digital camera analyzes the intensity — sometimes 
referred to as the brightness value — of the red, green, and blue light in a 
scene. Then the camera’s computer brain mixes the brightness values to 
create the full-color image.
 
Pictures created using these three main colors of light are RGB images — for 
red, green, and blue. Computer monitors, television sets, digital projectors, 
and scanners also create images by combining red, green, and blue light.
Digging through color channels
After your camera analyzes the amount of red, green, and blue light in a 
scene, it stores the brightness values for each color in separate portions 
of the image file. Digital-imaging professionals refer to these collections of 
brightness information as color channels.
In sophisticated image-editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop, you can 
view and edit the individual color channels in a digital photograph. Figure 4-4 
shows a color image broken down into its red, green, and blue color chan-
nels. Notice that each channel contains nothing more than a grayscale image. 
That’s because the camera records only light — or the absence of it — for 
each channel.
Figure 4-3: RGB images are created by 
blending red, green, and blue light.

Red Channel
RGB
Blue Channel
Green Channel
 
 Figure 4-4: An RGB image has three color channels, one each for the 
red, green, and blue light values.
In any of the channel images, light areas indicate heavy amounts of that 
channel’s color. For example, the red portion of the left flag appears nearly 
white in the red channel image, but nearly black in the green and blue chan-
nel images. Likewise, the blue flag poles appear very light in the blue chan-
nel images. Moreover, the center portion of the left flag is bright in all three 
channel images, which translates to white in the color image.

82
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Photoshop and some other high-level programs enable you to manipulate 
the red, green, and blue color channels independently in order to tweak the 
colors in your photo. Thankfully, though, you don’t need to dig that deep 
into imaging science to adjust the colors in the pictures you shoot; most 
programs, especially those designed for beginners, provide simple color-
adjustment tools that do all this channel-changing for you in the background. 
You just tell the program that you want your photo to have a touch more of 
this color and a tad less of that. 
 
Note that not all digital images contain three channels. If you convert an RGB 
image to a grayscale (black-and-white) image inside a photo-editing program, 
for example, the brightness values for all three color channels are merged 
into one channel. If you convert the image to the CMYK color model in prepa-
ration for professional printing, you end up with four color channels, one cor-
responding to each of the four primary colors of ink (cyan, magenta, yellow, 
and black). For more on this topic, see the next section.
Don’t let this channel stuff intimidate you, because until you become a sea-
soned photo editor, you don’t need to give it much thought, if then. We bring 
the topic up only so that when you see the term color channel — which often 
crops up in camera reviews and photo-editing how-to articles — you have 
some idea what it means.
For a detailed look at how you can control color in your digital photos, check 
out Chapter 6.
More colorful terminology
RGB is just one of many color-related 
acronyms and terms you may encounter 
on your digital photography adventures. 
So that you aren’t confused when you 
encounter these buzzwords, the follow-
ing list offers a brief explanation:
 
✓ RGB: Just to refresh your memory, 
RGB stands for red, green, and 
blue. RGB is the color model — that 
is, a method for defining colors — 
used by digital images, as well as 
any device that transmits or filters 
light. Figure 4-5 shows you how 
full-intensity red, green, and blue 
are mixed to create white, cyan, 
yellow, and magenta.
 
 Image-editing gurus also use the 
term color space when discussing a color model, something they do with 
surprising frequency.
Figure 4-5: The RGB color model is based 
on red, green, and blue light.

83
 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
 
✓ CMY/CMYK: Whereas light-based 
devices mix red, green, and blue 
light to create images, printers 
mix ink to emblazon a page with 
color. Instead of red, green, and 
blue, however, printers use cyan, 
magenta, and yellow as the primary 
color components, as illustrated 
in Figure 4-6. This color model is 
called the CMY model, for reasons 
you no doubt can figure out.
 
 Because inks are impure, produc-
ing a true black by mixing just 
cyan, magenta, and yellow is dif-
ficult. So most photo printers 
and commercial printing presses 
add black ink to the CMY mix. This 
model is called CMYK (the K is used to represent black because com-
mercial printers refer to the black printing plate as the Key plate). Four-
color images printed at a commercial printer may need to be converted 
to the CMYK color mode before printing.
 
 
One important note here: The colors you see in the RGB model in Fig-
ure 4-5 and the colors in the CMYK model in Figure 4-6 appear the same 
here. But in reality, the RGB colors are much more vibrant; what you’re 
seeing in Figure 4-5 is the RGB chart converted to the CMYK model for 
printing. You simply can’t reproduce in print the most vivid hues in an 
RGB image, which is one reason why those colors you see on your moni-
tor never exactly match what you see in your printed photos. For more 
on this issue and printing in general, check out Chapter 10.
 
✓ sRGB: A variation of the RGB color model, sRGB offers a smaller gamut, 
or range of colors, than RGB. One reason this color model was designed 
was to improve color matching between on-screen and printed images. 
Because RGB devices can produce more colors than printer inks can 
reproduce, limiting the range of available RGB colors helps increase the 
possibility that what you see on-screen is what you get on paper. The 
sRGB color model also aims to define standards for on-screen colors 
so that images on a Web page look the same on one viewer’s monitor 
as they do on another. In fact, the s in sRGB stands for standard. Today, 
sRGB is the color model used by most digital cameras.
 
✓ Adobe RGB: Many imaging purists don’t like to limit their color palettes 
to the smaller spectrum of sRGB. For that reason, some digital cameras, 
especially high-end models, also enable the photographer to capture 
images in the Adobe RGB color model. This model, developed by Adobe, 
includes a wider range of colors than sRGB. Figure 4-7 offers an illustra-
tion that approximates the differences between the two spectrums; note 
that neither can capture all the colors that the human eye can perceive.
Figure 4-6: The print color model is based 
on cyan, magenta, and yellow ink.

Visible Spectrum
Adobe RGB
sRGB
 
Figure 4-7: The Adobe RGB spectrum includes more colors than sRGB.
 
 The potential downside of Adobe RGB is that some colors included in its 
gamut can’t be reproduced in print. If a printer encounters a color that 
it can’t handle — such colors are said to be out-of-gamut — it substitutes 
the closest possible color. However, the sRGB color space excludes 
some colors that can be printed. So if capturing the widest spectrum 
is more important to you than color matching, you can opt for Adobe 
RGB over sRGB. But if you do decide to use Adobe RGB, study your 
photo software and printer software manuals to find out how to work 
with that color model when you edit, view, and print your images. Some 
lower-end programs can’t deal with different color models and simply 
convert everything to sRGB when you open the images. (You will need 
programs that support a thing called color management.) In other words, 
Adobe RGB may be a subject for you to explore when you become more 
advanced in your digital photography adventures.
 
 Note, too, that color-matching problems between printed and on-screen 
images can occur with either sRGB or Adobe RGB because those dis-
crepancies can result from many issues other than the original color 
model. Chapter 10 offers more on this subject.

85
 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
 
✓ Grayscale: A grayscale image is comprised solely of black, white, and 
shades of gray. Some people (and some photo-editing programs) refer to 
grayscale images as black-and-white images, but a true black-and-white 
image contains only black and white pixels, with no shades of gray in 
between. Graphics professionals often refer to black-and-white images 
as line art.
A bit about bit depth
If you own a high-end digital camera, it may 
enable you to choose between two bit depth 
settings. A bit is a chunk of computer data. Bit 
depth refers to how many bits are available to 
store color data. A higher bit depth allows more 
image colors.
Bit depth is stated either in terms of total bits or 
in bits per color channel. For example, a stan-
dard RGB image has 8 bits per channel, for a 
total of 24 bits (8 each for the red, green, and 
blue color channels). Images that contain more 
than 24 bits are high-bit images. High-bit RGB 
images contain as many as 16 bits per channel, 
or 48 bits total.
With 24 bits, you can capture about 16.7 million 
colors, which is typically more than enough. 
So what’s the advantage to more bits? Those 
extra bits may be useful if you need to adjust 
exposure, contrast, or color in your image-
editing software. If you apply heavy changes to 
a 24-bit image, you can sometimes introduce a 
defect called banding or posterization, where 
abrupt color changes interrupt what should be 
a smooth transition of hues, as shown in the 
right image in the following figure. Theoretically, 
higher-bit images withstand more correction 
without breaking down because you have more 
original color data to manipulate.
However, going to 48 bits does not guarantee 
that this defect won’t occur. And high-bit images 
have two important drawbacks: Files are signifi-
cantly larger, and many photo-editing programs 
either can’t open high-bit files or severely limit 
the number of tools that you can use on those 
files.
For that reason, sticking with 24 bits is a good 
practice for most photographers. The excep-
tion might be when you are shooting in tricky 
light, in which case you might want to ramp up 
to 48 bits. In the photo-editing stage, first make 
any necessary exposure or color adjustments 
and then convert the photo to a 24-bit image so 
that you can have full access to all your photo-
editing tools. (To make this conversion in Adobe 
Photoshop Elements, choose Image➪Mode➪8 
Bits/Channel.)

86
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
 Many digital cameras enable you to capture grayscale images — well, 
sort of. What they really do is capture a full-color image and then con-
vert that photo to grayscale as it’s saved to the camera memory card. 
Some cameras instead offer a feature that enables you to create a copy 
of a color image that’s on your memory card and then convert that copy 
to a grayscale version, so you end up with both a color original and 
a grayscale copy. You may want to bypass these in-camera grayscale 
options and instead do your own color-to-grayscale conversions in your 
photo-editing program, however. Assuming that you own a capable pro-
gram, you’ll have much more control over how the colors in your image 
are translated to grayscale. At the very least, if your camera captures 
the original file in grayscale instead of creating a grayscale copy, take 
one shot of the subject in color and one in grayscale. You can always go 
from color to grayscale after the fact, but you can’t do the opposite.
 
✓ CIE Lab, HSB, and HSL: These acronyms refer to three other color 
models for digital images. Until you become an advanced digital-imaging 
guru, you don’t need to worry about them. But just for the record, CIE 
Lab defines colors using three color channels. One channel stores lumi-
nosity (brightness) values, and the other two channels each store a sep-
arate range of colors. (The a and b are arbitrary names assigned to these 
two color channels.) HSB and HSL define colors based on hue (color), 
saturation (purity or intensity of color), and brightness (in the case of 
HSB) or lightness (in HSL).
 
 About the only time you’re likely to run into these color options is when 
mixing paint colors in a photo-editing program. Even then, the on-screen 
display in the color-mixing dialog boxes makes it easy to figure out how 
to create the color you want.
Resolution Rules!
 
Without a doubt, one of the most important things you can do to improve 
your digital photos is to understand the concept of resolution. Unless you 
make the right choices about resolution, your pictures will be a disappoint-
ment, no matter how captivating the subject. In other words, don’t skip this 
section!
Pixels: Building blocks of digital photos
Have you ever seen the painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La 
Grande Jatte, by the French artist Georges Seurat? Seurat was a master of a 
technique known as pointillism, in which scenes are composed of thousands 
of tiny dots of paint, created by dabbing the canvas with the tip of a paint-
brush. When you stand across the room from a pointillist painting, the dots 
blend together, forming a seamless image. Only when you get up close to the 
canvas can you distinguish the individual dots.

87
 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
 
Digital images work something like pointillist paintings. Rather than being 
made up of dots of paint, however, digital images are composed of tiny 
squares of color known as pixels. The term pixel is short for picture element.
If you display an image in a photo-editing program and then use the pro-
gram’s Zoom tool to magnify the view, you can see the individual pixels, as 
shown in Figure 4-8. Zoom out on the image, and the pixels seem to blend 
together, just as when you step back from a pointillist painting.
 
 
Figure 4-8: Zooming in on a digital photo enables you to see the individual pixels.

88
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Every digital photograph is born with a set number of pixels, which you con-
trol by using the capture settings on your digital camera. (See Chapter 3 for 
details.) Most cameras sold today can record at least 6 million pixels, and 
higher-end models can capture 10 megapixels or more — and some pro models 
can capture as many as 15 or 20!
 
Some people use the term pixel dimensions to refer to the number of pixels in 
an image — number of pixels wide by number of pixels high. Others use the 
term image size, which can lead to confusion because that term is also used 
to refer to the physical dimensions of the picture when printed (inches wide 
by inches tall). In this book, pixel dimensions refers specifically to the pixel 
count, and print size refers to the print dimensions.
Regardless of the terminology, pixel count affects three important aspects of 
a digital photo:
 
✓ The maximum size at which you can produce good prints
 
✓ The display size of the picture when viewed on a computer monitor or 
television screen
 
✓ The size of the image file, which in turn affects how much storage space 
is needed to hold the file
To help you determine the right pixel population for your photos, the follow-
ing three sections explore each of these issues.
Pixels and print quality
 
Generating a good print from a digital photo requires that you feed the 
printer a certain number of pixels per inch, or ppi. So the pixel count of a 
photo determines how large you can print the image without noticing a loss 
of picture quality.
Compare, for example, the images in Figures 4-9 through 4-11. The first image 
has resolution of 300 ppi; the second, 150 ppi; and the third, 75 ppi. For a 
close-up comparison of the three images, check out Figure 4-12.
 
For print purposes, resolution is measured in terms of pixels per linear inch, 
not square inch. So 75 ppi, for example, means 75 pixels wide by 75 pixels 
high, for a total of 5625 pixels in a square inch.

 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
Why does the 75-ppi image in Figure 4-11 look so much worse than its higher-
resolution counterparts? Because at 75 ppi, the pixels are bigger. And the 
bigger the pixel, the more easily your eye can figure out that it’s really just 
looking at a bunch of squares. Areas that contain diagonal and curved lines, 
such as the edges of the coins and the handwritten lettering in the figure, 
take on a stair-stepped appearance.
If you look closely at the black borders that surround Figures 4-9 through 
4-11, you can get a clearer idea of how resolution affects pixel size. Each 
image sports a 2-pixel border. But the border in Figure 4-11 is twice as thick 
as the one in Figure 4-10 because a pixel at 75 ppi is twice as large as a pixel 
at 150 ppi. Similarly, the border around the 150-ppi image in Figure 4-10 is 
twice as wide as the border around the 300-ppi image in Figure 4-9.
 
So the burning question is: Exactly how many pixels are enough to guarantee 
great prints? Well, it depends in part on how close people will be when view-
ing the pictures. Consider a photo on a billboard, for example. If you could 
climb up for a close inspection, you would see that the picture doesn’t look 
very good because billboard photos are typically very low-resolution images, 
with few pixels per inch. But when you view them from far away, as most of 
us do, they look okay because our eyes blend all those big pixels together. 
Unless you’re doing billboard photography, however, people will be viewing 
your images at a much closer range, so a higher resolution is required if you 
want the pictures to appear crisp and sharp. 
The exact resolution you need to produce the best prints also varies depend-
ing on the printer. But a good range to shoot for is 200–300 ppi. For quick 
reference, Table 4-1 shows you the approximate pixel count you need to pro-
duce traditional print sizes at the low end of that scale. The first set of pixel 
values represents the pixel dimensions (horizontal pixels by vertical pixels); 
the value in parentheses represents the total pixel count, in megapixels (MP). 
One megapixel equals 1 million pixels; you arrive at this total-pixel number 
by multiplying the horizontal and vertical pixel count.

Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
It’s critical that you set your camera to the resolution setting that matches 
your final print needs before you shoot. Although some photo programs enable 
you to add pixels to an existing image — a process called upsampling — doing 
so isn’t a good idea. The problem is that when you add pixels, the photo-
editing software simply makes its best guess as to what color and brightness 
to make the new pixels. And even high-end photo-editing programs don’t do a 
very good job of pulling pixels out of thin air, as illustrated by Figure 4-13.
 
75 ppi upsampled to 300 ppi
 
 Figure 4-13: Here you see the result of upsampling the 75-ppi image in 
Figure 4-11 to 300 ppi.
To create this figure, we started with the 75-ppi image shown in Figure 4-11 
and resampled the image to 300 ppi in Adobe Photoshop, one of the best 
photo-editing programs available. Compare this new image with the 300-ppi 
version in Figure 4-9, and you can see just how poorly the computer does at 
adding pixels.
With some images, you can get away with minimal upsampling — say, 10 to 
15 percent — but with other images, you notice a quality loss with even slight 
pixel infusions. Images with large, flat areas of color tend to survive upsam-
pling better than pictures with lots of intricate details.
Chapter 10 provides an in-depth look at printing, talking more about the 
whole pixel-count issue and exploring other factors that affect print quality. 
In the meantime, keep these additional pixel pointers in mind:

93
 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
 
✓ The numbers in Table 4-1 assume that you’re printing the entire photo. If 
you crop the photo before printing, you need more original pixels to gener-
ate a given print size because you’re getting rid of a portion of the image.
 
✓ If you’re having your photo professionally printed, you may be required 
to submit a photo at a specific resolution. For example, the publisher of 
this book requires photos to be sent at a resolution of 300 ppi. You can 
establish the resolution for print output in many photo editors. Chapter 
10 shows you how to do it in Adobe Photoshop Elements.
 
✓ A resolution of 300 ppi also is typically the right resolution if you’re 
having your photos printed at a local lab such as those at Costco or Wal-
Mart, although you don’t need to be right on that mark. If you’re upload-
ing picture files to the lab’s online printing service, the ordering screen 
usually displays some guidance as to the maximum recommended print 
size for each picture’s resolution. 
 
✓ For do-it-yourself printing on a home printer, 200 to 300 ppi should work 
just fine. A few printers, however, such as some from Epson, do request 
that you feed them a slightly higher ppi, so check your printer manual 
for guidelines.
 
✓ Although you don’t want to drop much below the 200 ppi threshold, 
neither do you need to shoot for the moon when it comes to pixel count. 
Once you get past 300 ppi, you usually don’t gain anything in terms 
of print quality; in fact, many printers, when fed an excess of 300 ppi, 
simply dump the overage. And images with ginormous pixel counts 
aren’t suitable for online sharing and also produce large file sizes, two 
drawbacks you can read about in the next two sections.
 
 In other words, if you’re shooting with a really high-resolution camera, 
you may not always want to set it to capture the maximum number of 
pixels. Instead, try to find a “sweet spot” that delivers the print size you 
want without bloating the pixel count unnecessarily. 
Pixels and screen images
 
Although resolution has a dramatic effect on the quality of printed photos, 
it’s irrelevant to the quality of pictures viewed on a monitor, television, or 
other screen device. The number of pixels controls only the size at which the 
picture appears on the screen. No matter what the pixel count, the quality of 
the display remains the same.
Here’s why: Like digital cameras, computer monitors (and other display devices) 
create everything you see on-screen out of pixels. With a monitor, you typically 
can choose from various display settings — through the Windows Control Panel 
or the Mac System Preferences dialog box — each of which results in a differ-
ent number of screen pixels. Standard settings range from 800 x 600 pixels for a 
small laptop screen to much more for large, wide-screen monitors, which may 
offer resolutions of 1920 x 1200 pixels or more. Some HDTV sets even double as 
giant computer monitors, and they have extremely high pixel dimensions.

94
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
At any rate, when you display a digital photo, the monitor simply uses one 
screen pixel to display one image pixel. For example, Figure 4-14 shows the 
screen of a 19-inch monitor as it appears when set to a display resolution 
of 1024 x 768 pixels. The photo inside the e-mail window contains 640 x 480 
pixels — and therefore consumes 640 of the available 1024 horizontal screen 
pixels and 480 of the 768 vertical pixels.
Clearly then, a photo that contains enough pixels to produce even a medium-
size print is too large for screen use. Send someone a photo captured at, say, 
6 megapixels, and only a small portion of it will be visible without scrolling.
 
So what do you do if you want to be able to print your pictures and share 
them online or use them for other screen purposes? Always set the camera 
resolution to match the print size you have in mind. As illustrated in the 
preceding section, you can’t add pixels later successfully to achieve a good 
print. You can, however, dump pixels from a high-resolution original to 
create a copy that’s appropriately sized for the screen. Chapter 11 explains 
how to take this step.

 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
 
A few cameras offer a setting that enables you to record two copies of each 
image, an original, full-size one for print and one significantly smaller image 
for on-screen use. And some models offer a built-in photo-editing tool that 
you can use to create e-mail sized versions of high-resolution images, too. 
Check your camera manual to find out whether your camera offers these 
time-saving features.
Pixels and file size
Many factors affect the size of the data file needed to store a digital pic-
ture, including the complexity of the scene (the level of detail, the number 
of colors, and so on). The file format in which the image is stored, usually 
either JPEG or Raw, explained later in this chapter, also affects file size. But 
all other things being equal, an image with lots of pixels has a larger file size 
than a low-resolution image.
Of course, if your digital camera is relatively new, it creates images that con-
tain tons of pixels, which means whopping file sizes. A 10-megapixel photo, 
for example, has an average file size of about 4.5MB (megabytes) when saved 
as a high-quality JPEG image.
Large files present the digital photographer with a number of problems:
 
✓ Large files require more storage space. When you’re shooting huge files, 
it doesn’t take too long to fill up a camera memory card or computer hard 
drive. And if you archive your files on CD or DVD, as we recommend, you 
can wind up with a huge disc collection after only a year or so of shooting. 
Keep in mind that a CD can hold only 650MB of data; a DVD has a capacity 
of about 4.7GB, or gigabytes. (One GB equals 1,000MB.)
 
✓ Large files take longer for the camera to capture. The more pixels you 
ask your camera to capture, the longer it needs to process and record 
the picture file to your memory card. That additional capture time can 
be a hindrance if you’re trying to capture action shots at a fast pace.
 
✓ Large files strain your computer. Large files make bigger demands on 
your computer’s memory (RAM) when you edit them. You also need lots 
of empty hard drive space for editing because the computer uses that 
space as temporary storage while it’s processing your images.
 
✓ Large files are inappropriate for online use. When placed on a Web 
page or sent via e-mail, photos that contain bazillions of pixels are a 
major annoyance. First, the larger the file, the longer it takes to down-
load. And if you send someone a high-resolution image in an e-mail, 
chances are that they won’t be able to view the whole image without 
scrolling. Remember, most computer monitors can display only a lim-
ited number of pixels. (See the preceding section for details.)

96
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
All that said, large files are a fact of life if you want to capture images at your 
camera’s highest resolution and quality settings. But do consider whether 
you always need to max out your pixel count. Are you really going to want to 
print the picture of your grandma’s birthday cake or your new car at 8 x 10 
inches or larger? If not, dialing down resolution a notch makes sense.
Selecting a File Format
Your camera may offer a choice of file types, or formats, in computer lingo. The 
format determines how the camera records and stores all the bits of data that 
comprise the photo. And the format you choose affects file size, picture qual-
ity, and what types of computer programs you need to view and edit the photo.
Although many formats have been developed for digital images, camera man-
ufacturers have settled — at least for now — on just two: JPEG and Camera 
Raw. A handful of high-end cameras also offer a third format, called TIFF, 
although that option has largely been replaced by Camera Raw. 
Each of these formats has its pros and cons, and which one is best depends 
on your picture-taking needs. The next sections tell you what you need to 
know to make a file-format decision.
 
Be careful not to confuse your camera’s file format control with the one that 
formats your camera memory card. The latter erases all data on your card 
and sets it so that it’s optimized for your camera. Don’t freak out about this 
possibility: When you choose the card format option, your camera displays 
a warning to let you know that you’re about to dump data. You get no such 
message for the file format control.
PPI is not DPI!
The capabilities of printers are also described 
in terms of resolution. Printer resolution is mea-
sured in dots per inch, or dpi, rather than pixels 
per inch. But the concept is similar: Printed 
images are made up of tiny dots of color, and 
dpi is a measurement of how many dots per inch 
the printer can produce. Generally, the higher 
the dpi, the smaller the dots, and the better the 
printed image, although gauging a printer solely 
by dpi can be misleading. (Chapter 10 talks more 
about evaluating printers.) 
Some people, including some printer manufac-
turers and software designers, mistakenly inter-
change dpi and ppi. But a printer dot is not the 
same thing as an image pixel. Most printers, in 
fact, use multiple printer dots to reproduce one 
image pixel.

97
 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
As for how you select a file format, the process varies from camera to camera, 
so check your manual. On some cameras, you set the format and resolution 
together; on others, the two are controlled separately. Either way, the settings 
typically have vague names, such as Good, Better, Best or, for cameras that con-
trol resolution and format together, Large/Fine, Small/Basic, and the like. Chap-
ter 3 offers a few more specifics about dialing in these and other camera settings.
JPEG
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is standard on every camera. JPEG stands for 
Joint Photographic Experts Group, the organization that developed the format.
JPEG is the leading camera format for two important reasons:
 
✓ Web- and computer-friendly photos: All Web browsers and e-mail 
programs can display JPEG images, which means that you can share 
your pictures online seconds after you shoot them. Furthermore, every 
image-editing program for both the Mac and Windows supports working 
with JPEG photos.
 
✓ Small file sizes: JPEG files are compressed and, therefore, have smaller 
file sizes than those captured in the Camera Raw or TIFF formats 
(explained later). That means that you can store more pictures in your 
camera’s memory as well as on your computer’s hard drive or whatever 
image-storage device you choose. Smaller files also take less time to 
transmit over the Web.
The drawback to JPEG is that in order to trim file size, it applies lossy 
compression, a process that eliminates some original image data. (Many 
digital-imaging experts refer to this process as simply JPEG compression.) 
Heavy JPEG compression can significantly reduce image quality, especially 
when the image is printed or displayed at a large size.
Figure 4-15 offers an example of the bad things that can happen with exces-
sive JPEG compression. The image takes on a “parquet tile” look and often 
exhibits random color defects — notice the bluish tinges around the eye-
lashes and near the jaw line. These defects are known collectively in the biz 
as JPEG artifacts or simply artifacts.
Now for the good news: Most cameras enable you to specify the level of JPEG 
compression that you want to apply. And at the highest-quality setting, the 
file undergoes only a little bit of compression. The result is a file that pro-
vides the benefits of the JPEG format with little, if any, noticeable damage to 
picture quality, as evidenced by the example in Figure 4-16. Sure, your file 
size is larger — the high-quality JPEG in Figure 4-16 has a file size of 400K 
(kilobytes) versus the 33K size of the low-quality version in Figure 4-15 — 
but what good does that small file size do you if the picture is lousy? Both 
pictures contain the same number of pixels, by the way, so the quality differ-
ences you see are purely a result of compression amounts.

98

33K
 
Figure 4-15: Too much JPEG compression destroys picture quality.
To sum up, as long as you stick with the highest quality JPEG file your 
camera can produce, this format is the right choice for all but the most 
demanding photographers. (If you fall in the latter camp, explore the Camera 
Raw format, explained in the next section.) And note that even if you choose 
your camera’s lowest-qualiity JPEG setting, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll see 
the level of destruction shown in Figure 4-15 — the defects in the picture are 
exaggerated so that you can more easily see what JPEG artifacts look like.
Figuring out which camera setting delivers the top-quality JPEG file requires 
a look at your camera manual because the options differ between models. 
Typically, compression settings are given vague monikers: Good/Better/Best 
or High/Normal/Basic, for example.

 Figure 4-16: But a lightly compressed JPEG produces excellent images while 
keeping file sizes small.
 
These names refer not to the amount of compression being applied, but to 
the resulting image quality. If you set your camera to the Best setting, for 
example, the image is compressed less than if you choose the Good setting. 
Also, some cameras may use similar names to refer to image-size (resolution) 
options rather than JPEG quality options.
You should find a chart in your manual that indicates how many images you 
can fit into a certain amount of memory at different compression settings. 
But you need to experiment to find out exactly how each setting affects pic-
ture quality. Shoot the same image at all the different settings to get an idea 
of how much damage you do if you opt for a higher degree of compression.

100
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
If your camera offers several resolution settings, do the compression test 
for each resolution setting. Remember: Resolution and compression work 
together to determine image quality. You usually get away with more com-
pression at a higher resolution. Low resolution combined with heavy com-
pression yields results even a mother couldn’t love.
 
When you edit your images in a photo editor, you can save your altered file 
in the JPEG format. If you do, though, you apply another round of lossy com-
pression. Each pass through the JPEG compression machine does further 
damage, and if you edit and save to the JPEG repeatedly, you can wind up 
with the level of artifacting shown in Figure 4-15. So you should instead save 
works-in-progress in a format such as TIFF (explained later in this chapter), 
which does a much better job of preserving picture quality. Should you want 
to share your edited photo online — which requires a JPEG image — you can 
create a copy of your final TIFF image and save the copy in the JPEG format. 
Chapter 11 shows you how.
Camera Raw 
When you shoot in the JPEG format, your camera takes the data collected by 
the image sensor and then applies certain enhancements — exposure correc-
tion, color adjustments, sharpening, and so on — before recording the final 
image. These changes are based on the picture characteristics that the manu-
facturer believes its customers prefer.
The Camera Raw format, sometimes called simply Raw, was developed for 
photo purists who don’t want the camera manufacturer to make those deci-
sions. Camera Raw records data straight from the sensor, without applying 
any post-capture processes. After transferring the files to a computer, you 
then use special software known as a raw converter to translate the sensor 
data into the actual photograph. 
 
Unlike JPEG, Camera Raw is not a standardized format. Each manufacturer 
uses different data specifications and names for its Raw format. Nikon Raw 
files are called NEF files, for example, while Canon’s versions go by the name 
CRW or CR2, depending on the camera model.
Whatever the specific name, Raw image capture offers the following 
advantages: 
 
✓ No risk of JPEG compression artifacts. Unlike JPEG files, Raw files don’t 
undergo lossy compression. That means that when you “shoot Raw,” 
you don’t have to worry about the quality loss that can sometimes occur 
with JPEG compression. Again, though, as long as you stick with your 
camera’s highest-quality JPEG setting, you may have difficulty detect-
ing much difference in quality between the JPEG and Raw version of an 
image unless you greatly enlarge the photo.

101
 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
 
✓ Greater creative control. When you process your “uncooked” picture 
data in a raw converter, you can specify characteristics such as bright-
ness, color saturation, sharpness, and so on, instead of dining on what-
ever the JPEG version might serve up. To keep up the cooking analogy, 
imagine that you put together a special dish and you realize after it 
comes out of the oven that you accidentally used cayenne pepper when 
your recipe didn’t call for any. If your dish were like a Raw file, you’d be 
able to go back to the beginning of your cooking session and remove the 
pepper. With JPEG, that pepper would be a done deal. And that’s what 
photographers like about Raw — files captured in this format give you 
much more control over the final look of your images.
 
✓ Greater latitude for editing the picture. Raw capture also gives you a 
bit of a photographic safety net. Suppose that you don’t get the expo-
sure settings quite right, for example, when you shoot a picture. With 
JPEG, the camera decides how brightly to render the shadows and high-
lights, which can limit you in how much you can retouch that aspect 
of your picture later. With Raw, you can specify what brightness value 
should be white, what should be black, and so forth, giving you greater 
ability to achieve just the image brightness and contrast you want — a 
benefit that’s especially great for pictures taken in tricky light.
 
✓ Higher bit depth. Raw files typically have a greater bit depth than JPEG 
files. The sidebar “A bit about bit depth” (earlier in the chapter) explains 
this concept in detail, but the short story is that the more bits you have, 
the more color and tonal information the image can contain. Of course, 
whether or not you will be able to spot any difference depends on the 
subject matter. But again, starting with a higher bit depth can give you 
an added level of flexibility if you decide to edit the photo.
Of course, like most things in life, the benefits of Raw do come at a price. 
First, most low-priced cameras don’t offer the format. But Raw also costs you 
in the following ways, which may be enough for you to stick with JPEG even if 
your camera is dual-natured in terms of file format:
 
✓ Raw files require some post-capture computer time. You can’t take a 
Raw image straight from the camera and share it online, add it to a text 
document, use it in a PowerPoint presentation, retouch it in a photo 
editor, or, well, do much of anything with it until you process it in a 
Raw converter. Some photo programs provide a tool that handles this 
conversion in the background, requiring little input from you, but if you 
want to enjoy the added control that shooting Raw gives you, you need 
to use a converter than enables you to specify all the critical image char-
acteristics: color, sharpness, contrast, and so on, and that takes time. 
Either way, after the conversion, you save a copy of the processed Raw 
file in a standard file format, such as TIFF (explained in the next section).

102
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
 Chapter 8 details the conversion process. For now, just understand that 
if you’re not too keen on computers, Raw may not be for you.
 
✓ You may not be able to view thumbnails of your images on your 
computer without converting them, either. If you’re used to looking at 
thumbnails of your photos in Windows Explorer, for example, or iPhoto 
on the Mac, you may not be able to do so with Raw files, depending on 
the camera make and model. You will still see the Raw filenames, but no 
image thumbnails.
 
 However — and here’s some good news — most camera companies offer 
their own image-browsing software for free. (Look on the CD that came 
with your camera.) You should be able to view and maybe even print 
Raw images by using those manufacturer-created programs — just not 
in most third-party programs.
 
✓ You may need to buy a separate Raw converter program. Some camera 
companies include a good raw-conversion tool on the software CD that 
ships with the camera. But others provide only a minimally equipped 
converter for free, enabling you just to change from Raw to JPEG but 
using only a standard set of conversion settings, with no control over 
specific image characteristics. So you may need to buy a third-party pro-
gram to really take advantage of the picture control that Raw offers.
 
 If you already own a photo-editing program, however, check to see 
whether it offers a converter. For example, Adobe Photoshop Elements 
provides a very capable converter. Note that some photo programs are 
especially designed to speed up the Raw conversion process, and some 
programs offer more picture controls than others. So shop around and 
investigate all your options before you buy.
 
 If your software has a Raw converter but balks at opening the Raw files 
from your camera, check the software manufacturer’s Web site. You 
may need to download an update that provides a Raw-file translator for 
your model of camera. (Note that some software companies are quicker 
than others at posting updates when new camera models are released.)
 
✓ Raw files are larger than JPEG files. Again, Raw files aren’t com-
pressed, so they can be significantly larger than JPEG files, even if you 
capture the JPEG image at the lowest possible amount of compression. 
So you can store fewer Raw files on a memory card than JPEG files. (If 
your camera offers the Raw format, the manual should provide details 
on the size of its Raw files vs. JPEG versions.) In addition, because you 
probably want to hang onto your original Raw files after you convert 
them, just for safety’s sake, you ultimately wind up with at least two 
copies of each image — the Raw original and the one that you converted 
to a standard format.

103
 Chapter 4: Resolution, File Format, and Other Digital Details
In short, because of the added complication of working with Raw files, you’re 
probably better off sticking with JPEG if you’re a photo-editing novice, a 
computer novice, or both. Frankly, the in-camera processing that occurs with 
JPEG is likely to produce results that are at least as good as, if not better, 
than what you can do in your photo editor if you’re not skilled at the task. 
(Just remember the earlier warning about saving files that you edit in the 
TIFF format instead of JPEG.)
 
Some cameras offer a setting called Raw+JPEG (or Raw+Basic, or something 
similar). With this option, the camera creates both a Raw file and a JPEG 
file so that you have a version of the image that you can use immediately 
and another that you can use if you’re inclined to spend hours editing it. Of 
course, you consume even more camera memory with this option because 
you’re creating two files — and later, you’ll have yet one more file after you 
process the Raw file on your computer. 
In addition, a few cameras now offer an in-camera converter that creates a 
converted copy of your Raw file and then saves the copy to your memory 
card. You can usually specify just a few image characteristics, however; and 
of course, you have to judge the settings you choose based on what you see 
on the camera monitor. Still, this is a convenient option when you want to 
share an image right away, and you don’t have the time or opportunity to do 
the job on your computer.
DNG: Format of the future?
Adobe Systems offers another digital-image file 
format, DNG. Short for Digital Negative Format, 
DNG was created in response to growing con-
cerns about the fact that every camera manu-
facturer uses its own, specially engineered 
flavor of Camera Raw. This Photo Tower of 
Babel makes it difficult for software designers 
to create programs that can open every type 
of Raw file, which in turn makes it difficult for 
people to share Raw files. That issue isn’t a 
huge problem for the average consumer, but 
it’s a pain for professionals who must work with 
Raw images from many photographers. In addi-
tion, the possibility exists that future software 
may not support earlier generations of Raw 
files, leaving people with images they can no 
longer open (think Betamax videotapes and 
8-track audio recordings).
The idea of DNG is to create a standard raw-
data format that all camera manufacturers can 
embrace. That goal is still being pursued by 
Adobe, but if you want to translate your current 
Raw files to DNG, the Adobe Web site (www.
adobe.com) offers a free converter that can 
handle files from many current digital cameras. 
Of course, there’s no guarantee that DNG will 
be around 100 years from now, either, and most 
photo software can’t yet open DNG files. But 
with Adobe backing the format, it’s a reason-
able bet that DNG will one day be as common 
as JPEG or TIFF. 

104
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
TIFF
The third player in the image file format game is TIFF, which stands for 
Tagged Image File Format, in case you care, which you really shouldn’t. Like 
Camera Raw, TIFF is a lossless image format, meaning that it retains your 
picture at its highest quality — as opposed to JPEG’s lossy compression, 
which can dump critical image data. TIFF has long been the standard format 
for images destined for professional printing, where the highest quality is 
required.
Before the emergence of Camera Raw, some high-end cameras offered TIFF as 
an alternative to JPEG. Most cameras, now, though, don’t offer the option to 
record images as TIFF files. Instead, TIFF is a “destination” format: You save 
an edited JPEG file in TIFF format, for example, so that no more compres-
sion and data loss occur. Or, if your camera offers the ability to save files in 
the Camera Raw format, you can save them in TIFF format after you process 
them so that you preserve the best image quality. Chapter 9 explains the pro-
cess of saving in the TIFF format.
TIFF does present two problems: First, TIFF files are much larger than JPEG 
files. In addition, Web browsers and e-mail programs can’t display TIFF photos. 
If you do want to share a TIFF file online, you need to open the file in a photo 
editor and save a copy of it in the JPEG format. (Chapter 11 tells you how.)

etting a grip on the digital characteristics of your camera — resolution, 
white balance, and so on — is critical. But don’t get so involved in 
these new picture-taking issues that you overlook the traditional fundamen-
tals such as proper exposure and lighting. All the megapixels in the world 
can’t save a picture that’s too dark or too light.
This chapter tackles all things exposure-related, explaining 
such basics as how shutter speed, aperture, and ISO affect 
your pictures. Also look here for information about 
advanced exposure features, such as shutter-priority 
autoexposure and aperture-priority autoexposure, 
along with general tips to help you manipulate expo-
sure to meet your creative goals.  
Lights, Camera, Exposure!
 
As Chapter 4 explains, a digital photo is created when 
light passes through the camera lens and strikes the 
image sensor, which is a light-sensitive computer chip. 
The overall brightness and contrast of the resulting image 
depends on three main factors:
 
✓ The f-stop, or aperture setting, which controls the amount of light 
that strikes the image sensor.
 
✓ The shutter speed, which determines the length of time the light is 
allowed to hit the sensor.
 
✓ The ISO setting, which controls how sensitive the image sensor is to light.

106
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
How much control you have over these settings depends on your camera. On 
digital SLRs and some high-end point-and-shoot models, you get full manual 
exposure control and can adjust all three settings as you see fit. On lower-
priced cameras, your options usually are more limited, with the camera han-
dling most or all of the exposure decisions for you.
Either way, though, taking a closer look at these three exposure factors will 
help you better understand the possibilities and limitations of your camera. 
To that end, the next section explains f-stops and shutter speed; following 
that, you can explore the ins and outs of ISO.
Aperture, f-stops, and shutter speed
After light enters the camera lens, it must make its way past two barriers 
before reaching the image sensor. These light gatekeepers are called the 
aperture and the shutter.
Although the exact design of the 
system varies from camera to 
camera, Figure 5-1 offers an illus-
tration of the basic concept. Just 
behind the lens is the aperture, 
which is a hole in an adjustable 
diaphragm. Light passes through 
that hole to the shutter, which 
serves the same purpose as shut-
ters on a window: Normally, the 
shutter is closed, preventing light 
from reaching the image sensor. 
When you press the shutter 
button, the shutter opens briefly 
to let the light in, as shown in the 
figure, and the sensor records 
the image. (Chapter 4 offers more 
details on how the magic of turn-
ing light into a picture actually 
happens, if you’re interested.)
 
By controlling the aperture size and the length of time the shutter remains 
open, you can vary the amount of light that strikes the sensor, and thus con-
trol exposure. But the f-stop and shutter speed affect other aspects of your 
pictures, too, and recognizing those side effects is important to choosing set-
tings that will produce the picture you have in mind. Here are the details you 
need to know:
 
✓ Aperture (f-stop): The size of the aperture is measured in f-numbers, 
more commonly referred to as f-stops. Standard aperture settings are 
f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, and f/22, but the range of f-stops provided

107
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
varies from camera to camera, or, on an SLR-type model, on the lens 
attached to the camera.
 
 Contrary to what you may expect, the higher the f-stop number, the 
smaller the aperture and the less light that enters the camera. Each 
f-stop setting lets in half as much light as the next lower f-stop number. 
For example, the camera gets twice as much light at f/11 as it does at 
f/16. (And here you were complaining that computers were confusing!) 
Where do the numbers come from? Well, let’s just say that this setup 
is based in a series of complex math calculations that won’t affect your 
photos much beyond understanding knowing these basics. See Figure 5-2 
for an illustration that may help you get a grip on f-stops.
 
 
Figure 5-2: As the f-stop number decreases, the aperture size grows and more 
 
light enters the camera.

108
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
 Along with altering exposure, the aperture setting also affects depth of 
field, or the distance over which objects in the picture appear sharply 
focused. Chapter 6 explores depth of field in detail; for now, just know 
that the higher the f-stop, the greater the depth of field. Figure 5-3 illus-
trates this issue. Notice that the background in the left image, captured 
at an f-stop of f/5.6, is much softer than its sibling, taken at f/16.
 
f/5.6, shallow depth of field
f/16, large depth of field 
 
Figure 5-3: A higher f-stop increases depth of field (the zone of sharp focus).
 
 You can use this aperture side effect to your creative advantage: For 
example, if you’re shooting a landscape and want to keep both near and 
distant objects as sharply focused as possible, you choose a high f-stop 
number (a smaller aperture opening). Or, if you’re shooting a portrait 
and want objects in the background to be softly focused, you choose a 
low f-stop number, which opens the aperture and reduces depth of field.
 
✓ Shutter speed: Shutter speed refers to the length of time the shutter 
stays open after you press the shutter button. Shutter speeds are mea-
sured in fractions of a second. A shutter speed of 1/60, for example, 

109
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
means that the shutter opens for one-sixtieth of a second. The range 
of shutter speeds available to you depends on your camera; check the 
back of your manual for the scoop.
 
 On most cameras, a shutter speed number that appears with an inches 
mark indicates a speed of one second or above. For example, 4" indi-
cates a four-second shutter speed.
 
 Like the aperture setting, shutter speed also affects the apparent focus 
of your image, but in a different way. Shutter speed determines whether 
any moving objects in the scene appear blurry or sharp. A fast shutter 
speed “freezes” action; a slow shutter speed blurs motion. In Figure 5-4, 
for example, a shutter speed of 1/60 second left the jumping children 
blurry. Setting the shutter speed to 1/300 second caught them cleanly in 
mid-jump. The speed you need to stop action depends on how fast your 
subject is moving, however.
1/60 second
1/300 second
Figure 5-4: In addition to affecting exposure, shutter speed determines whether moving objects appear blurry.

Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
 Here’s one other critical shutter-speed factoid: For very slow shutter 
speeds, you should use a tripod or otherwise steady the camera so that 
it doesn’t move during the exposure. Otherwise, camera shake during 
the time the shutter is open can cause the whole photo to be blurry. The 
length of time that people can successfully handhold a camera varies, so 
experiment to see where you enter the danger zone. Also turn on image 
stabilization, if your camera or lens offers it; that feature can enable 
sharper handheld shots at slower shutter speeds. (Check your manual, 
though, to find out whether you should turn off image stabilization when 
using a tripod; in some cases, the feature can actually cause blur in 
tripod shots.) Chapter 6 discusses this whole issue in more detail.
On cameras that offer manual aperture and shutter speed control, you can 
choose to manipulate just one of the two settings or adjust them in tandem to 
capture just the right amount of light. 
Why would you want to do this? Here’s one example: Let’s say that it’s 
around noon on a bright, sunny day, and you want to take a stop-action 
sports picture that requires at least a 1/500-second shutter speed. So you 
then choose an aperture setting that lets in the right amount of light to 
expose the picture at that shutter speed. If you want to take the same photo 
near twilight, and you want to stick with that 1/500-second shutter speed, 
you must open the aperture to a wider setting (lower f-stop number) to com-
pensate for the fact that you’re now shooting in less light. (You alternatively 
could increase the camera’s light sensitivity by increasing the ISO setting, but 
that option carries some risks, as explained in the next section.)
 
Note that some digital cameras don’t use a traditional shutter/aperture 
arrangement to control exposure, however. Instead, the chips in the image-
sensor array simply turn on and off for different periods, thereby capturing 
more or less light. But even on cameras that use this alternative approach, 
the camera’s capabilities are usually stated in traditional terms. For example, 
you may have a choice of two exposure settings, which may be labeled with 
icons that look like the aperture openings shown in Figure 5-2. The settings 
are engineered to deliver the equivalent exposure that you would get with a 
camera using the same f-stop.
ISO ratings and chip sensitivity
With the aperture setting (f-stop) and shutter speed, you control how much 
light makes its way from the camera lens to the image sensor. But the final 
exposure that results from your chosen f-stop and shutter speed depends on 
the light sensitivity of the camera’s image sensor.

111
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
 
Light sensitivity for both film and digital camera sensors is stated in ISO 
numbers. ISO stands for the International Standards Organization, which is the 
group that developed the light-sensitivity specifications. (Years ago, it was 
ASA, for American Standards Association, but for once the world decided to 
agree on something, and now we have ISO.)
Film geared to the consumer market typically offers ratings of ISO 200, 400, 
or 800. The higher the number, the more sensitive the film, or, if you prefer 
photography lingo, the faster the film. And the faster the film, the less light 
you need to capture a decent image. The advantage of using a faster film 
is that you can use a faster shutter speed, a smaller aperture, or shoot in 
dimmer lighting — or all three — than you can with a low-speed film. On the 
downside, photos shot with fast film sometimes exhibit noticeable grain, 
which gives the pictures a speckled appearance.
With a digital camera, you don’t swap out sensors as you swap film on a film 
camera to change the ISO. Instead, the camera has an ISO control that boosts 
or decreases the sensor’s light sensitivity. Some point-and-shoot cameras 
handle ISO for you automatically, adjusting the ISO setting according to the 
current light. ISO may also be adjusted behind the scenes when you shoot in 
certain automatic scene modes, such as a Sports mode or Nighttime Portrait 
mode. But many digital models today allow you to set a specific ISO number, 
such as 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and even higher.
Unfortunately, raising the ISO setting on a digital camera boosts the elec-
tronic signal that’s produced when you snap a picture. And that extra signal 
power usually results in noise — the digital equivalent to the added grain that 
you get when you use a higher ISO film. So just as with film, the lower the ISO 
number, the better the picture quality.
Figures 5-5 and 5-6 illustrate the impact of ISO on quality, showing the same 
subject captured at ISO 200, 400, 800, and 1600. When you print pictures at a 
small size, as in Figure 5-5, noise may not be apparent to the eye; instead, the 
image may have a slightly blurry look, as in the ISO 800 and 1600 examples 
in Figure 5-5. Figure 5-6 shows close-up views of each image so that you can 
more easily compare the loss of detail and increase in noise.
Of course, for some shooting scenarios, you may be forced to use a higher 
ISO. For example, if you’re trying to capture a moving subject in less than 
ideal lighting, you may need to raise the ISO in order to use the fast shutter 
speed necessary to freeze the action.

 Figure 5-5: Raising the ISO setting increases light sensitivity, but also can produce a 
defect known as digital noise. 
It’s important to note, too, that the examples you see here illustrate noise 
produced by a specific camera. Some cameras, especially newer models, pro-
duce much better high-ISO images than others. Bottom line: Experiment with 
ISO settings if your camera gives you control over this feature. Then evaluate 
your test shots to see how much quality you can expect to give up when you 
raise ISO. And if you’re in the market for a new camera, read reviews to find 
out how models you’re considering perform at different ISO settings.

enlarge images.
 
Finally, if your camera gives you a choice between automatic ISO adjustment 
and manual ISO control, stick with manual. In automatic mode, the camera 
may ramp up the ISO to a point that produces more noise than is acceptable 
to you. Some cameras do allow you to limit the top ISO that can be selected 
in auto mode or to specify the shutter speed at which ISO increase occurs, 
which makes Auto ISO a little more palatable. But if you’re a stickler for image 
quality, it’s better to control this aspect of your picture-taking yourself.
So how do I set f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO?
The exact steps you take to change your camera’s f-stop, shutter speed, and 
ISO vary from camera to camera, of course. If your camera offers only auto-
matic exposure, you may not even have any control over these settings. 

114
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
However, even if your camera is fully automatic, you may still have some 
input over the final exposure; you may be able to request a slightly darker or 
brighter image through a feature called exposure compensation, for example. 
Keep cruising through this chapter for a look at all the possibilities and then 
check your manual to see what’s possible.
If you own a digital SRL, you can choose to work in autoexposure mode, 
manual exposure mode, or “semi-automatic” mode, where you select the 
shutter speed and the camera selects the appropriate f-stop (or vice versa). 
Some high-end point-and-shoot models also offer manual and semi-automatic 
exposure modes. Again, the level of control you have in the non-manual 
modes varies, so again, look for your camera instruction book.
Also check that book to find out how the camera indicates to you the cur-
rent exposure settings. On a digital SLR, you typically see the current shutter 
speed, f-stop, and ISO in the viewfinder display, as shown on the left side of 
Figure 5-7. Some cameras also display the settings in the camera monitor, as 
shown on the right. And with some cameras, such as the Canon model used 
to create the images in the figure, you can check exposure settings either 
way. (The viewfinder and monitor may also display several other pieces of 
information related to other camera settings, as they do here.)

 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
If you use a point-and-shoot camera, you may only be able to view the cur-
rent settings on the monitor, even if the camera has a viewfinder. And if you 
have a very basic, fully automatic camera that handles exposure for you, 
you may not be able to view the aperture and shutter speed settings at all 
until after you take the picture and download it to your computer. Then you 
can open the photo in a program that can read the camera metadata, which 
records the settings you used to take the picture. See Chapter 8 for more 
about viewing metadata. Doing so, by the way, is a great way to learn more 
about how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect the look of your pictures.
 
Finally, remember that if your camera offers lots of different exposure 
modes — full automatic, manual, semi-automatic, and specialty modes such 
as Portrait and Landscape — the aspects of exposure that you can control 
depend on the mode you choose. See the next section for a rundown of the 
standard exposure modes for an overview of this issue.
Choosing an Exposure Mode
Many digital cameras today offer you 
a choice of exposure modes. The mode 
you choose affects the level of control 
you have over shutter speed, f-stop, 
and ISO.
You may be able to select the exposure 
mode from a camera menu. Or your 
camera may sport a mode dial like the 
one shown in Figure 5-8, which is the 
type found on some Nikon dSLRs. The 
initials and symbols that represent the 
different modes vary from camera to 
camera, of course (although some have 
become almost universal, such as a pic-
ture of a flower representing Close-up 
mode).
Wherever and however you access them, exposure modes can be broken 
down into a few standard categories:
 
✓ Full automatic: In this mode, the camera takes care of all aperture and 
shutter speed decisions for you. You may or may not be able to adjust 
ISO. Whether or not you can use flash also depends on the camera; 
some models enable flash only if the camera thinks extra light is needed. 
Figure 5-8: Exposure modes are typically rep-
resented by symbols such as you see here.

116
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
You may not be able to disable flash, either; if the camera says you need 
flash, you’re stuck with it, even if your creative eye says differently.
 
 Certain other camera options, such as those affecting color or file 
format, may also be off limits. For example, some cameras don’t enable 
you to shoot in the Camera Raw format in automatic exposure mode. 
(Chapter 4 explains file formats.)
 
✓ Automatic scene modes: These modes are designed to automatically 
select the right exposure settings for different types of subjects: por-
traits, landscapes, sports pictures, and so on. Many times, scene modes 
also adjust color, contrast, and sharpness according to the subject as 
well. As with full automatic mode, you normally give up control over 
flash and some other camera options.
 
 If you’re interested in exploring scene modes, Chapter 3 describes the 
most common ones and tells you of specific pitfalls you may encounter 
when you use them.
 
✓ Semi-automatic modes: The two standard modes in this category, 
shutter-priority autoexposure and aperture-priority autoexposure, ask you 
to specify one-half of the f-stop/shutter speed equation. The camera 
then assists you by selecting the other half. For example, if you set the 
camera to shutter-priority autoexposure, you dial in the shutter speed 
you want, and the camera than chooses the appropriate f-stop to expose 
the image properly at your chosen shutter speed. The camera makes 
that calculation based on the current ISO setting.
 
 In addition to offering more control over exposure, these modes typi-
cally free you to adjust all the other camera settings (color options, file 
format, and so on).
 
✓ Manual exposure: In this mode, you specify f-stop, shutter speed, 
and ISO. After you become experienced in the ways of these controls, 
manual mode is often the fastest way to manipulate exposure. And even 
in manual mode, most cameras display some sort of meter to let you 
know whether you’re on-target with your settings.
Depending on your camera, you may have access to several other variations 
on these themes. Some models offer something called flexible programmed 
autoexposure or variable programmed autoexposure, (usually represented by 
the letter P, as in Figure 5-8). In this semi-automatic mode, the camera pres-
ents you with several different combinations of f-stop and shutter speed, all 
guaranteed to deliver a good exposure. You then can choose the combina-
tion that best matches your creative goals. And many Canon cameras offer a 
mode called A-DEP, which attempts to choose an f-stop that results in a depth 
of field that keeps all objects in the frame in sharp focus. (A-DEP stands for 
automatic depth of field.)

117
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
The next section offers some tips for getting good results in any of the auto-
matic modes. Following that, you can find tips on using aperture-priority 
autoexposure and shutter-priority autoexposure.
Getting good autoexposure results
Today’s autoexposure mechanisms are incredibly capable. But in order for 
the feature to work correctly, you need to take this three-step approach to 
shooting pictures:
 
1. Frame your subject in the viewfinder or monitor.
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway and hold it there.
 
 The camera analyzes the scene and selects initial exposure settings. If 
you’re working in autofocus mode (covered in the next chapter), focus 
is set at the same time. After the camera makes its decisions, it signals 
you in some fashion — usually with a light near the viewfinder or with a 
beep.
 
3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
Normally, autoexposure works well if you use this technique. But a few points 
are worth noting:
 
✓ On some cameras, exposure is locked at the point you press the shut-
ter button halfway. On other models, the camera continues to monitor 
the light and continually adjusts the exposure settings as necessary up 
to the point at which you fully depress the shutter button. If you want 
to lock exposure at a certain setting on this second type of camera, you 
can switch to manual exposure, if your camera offers that option. Or 
your camera may offer a feature called autoexposure lock or AE lock, 
which enables you to lock in the exposure settings before the shutter 
button is pressed all the way. Using autoexposure lock can be a little 
cumbersome, though, so using manual exposure is often easier if you 
want to specify certain exposure settings.
 
✓ Check your camera to find out how it warns you if it can’t select any 
combination of exposure settings that will produce a good image. Some 
models beep at you or display a flashing light; others display a warning 
screen on the monitor.
 
✓ The exposure settings that the camera’s autoexposure system selects 
are based on the current metering mode. That’s just a fancy name for the 
control that determines which part of the screen the camera analyzes 
when calculating exposure. See the upcoming section “Exposure meter-
ing modes” for more information.

118
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
✓ If you’re not happy with your autoexposure results, find out whether 
your camera offers a feature called exposure compensation. Described 
later in this chapter, this option enables you to tell the camera that you 
want a darker or lighter picture than the autoexposure system delivered. 
Using “priority” exposure modes
In addition to regular autoexposure modes, where the camera sets both aper-
ture and shutter speed, your camera may offer aperture-priority autoexposure 
or shutter-priority autoexposure. 
 
On some cameras, aperture-priority autoexposure is abbreviated as A; on 
others, Av. The a, of course, stands for aperture; the v stands for value. 
Shutter-priority autoexposure is abbreviated either by the letter S or Tv, for 
time value. (Shutter speed determines the exposure time.) Oh, and if you see 
the letters AE, as you will if you read many photography magazines, it’s an 
abbreviation for autoexposure.
Whatever they’re labeled, these options offer more control while still giving 
you the benefit of the camera’s exposure brain. Here’s how they work:
 
✓ Aperture-priority autoexposure: This setting gives you control over the 
aperture (f-stop). After setting the aperture, you frame your shot and 
then press and hold the shutter button halfway as you do when shooting 
in fully automatic mode. But this time, the camera checks to see what 
aperture you chose and then selects the shutter speed necessary to cor-
rectly expose the image at that f-stop, taking the current ISO setting into 
account when making its decision.
 
 By altering the aperture, you change depth of field — the range of sharp 
focus. The section, “Aperture, f-stops, and shutter speed,” earlier in 
this chapter, explores this relationship between aperture and depth of 
field. Aperture isn’t the only way to adjust depth of field, though, so see 
Chapter 6 for the whole story.
 
✓ Shutter-priority autoexposure: In shutter-priority mode, you choose 
the shutter speed, and the camera selects the correct f-stop. This mode 
is good for times when your scene contains moving objects because 
shutter speed determines whether those objects appear blurry or are 
“frozen” in place. See the same aforementioned section for more details 
about shutter speed.
Assuming that your ISO value doesn’t change, you theoretically should wind up 
with the same exposure no matter what aperture or shutter speed you choose, 
because as you adjust one value, the camera makes a corresponding change to the 
other value, right? Well, yes, sort of. Remember that you’re working with a 

119
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
limited range of shutter speeds and apertures (your camera manual provides 
information on available settings). So depending on the lighting conditions, 
the camera may not be able to properly compensate for the shutter speed or 
aperture that you choose.
Suppose that you’re shooting outside on a bright, sunny day. You take your 
first shot at an aperture of f/11, and the picture looks great. Then you shoot a 
second picture, this time choosing an aperture of f/4. The camera may not be 
able to set the shutter speed high enough to accommodate the larger aper-
ture, which means an overexposed picture.
Here’s another example: Say that you’re trying to catch a tennis player in the 
act of smashing a ball during a gray, overcast day. You know that you need a 
high shutter speed to capture action, so you switch to shutter-priority mode 
and set the shutter speed to 1/500 second. But given the dim lighting, the 
camera can’t capture enough light even with the aperture open to its maxi-
mum setting. So your picture turns out too dark unless you increase the ISO 
setting, making the camera more sensitive to light.
As long as you keep the camera’s shutter speed and aperture range in mind, 
however, switching to shutter-priority or aperture-priority mode is a great 
way to expand your creative control over your photos until you’re ready to 
move up to manual-exposure mode. So try them out in the following scenarios:
 
✓ You’re trying to “stop” action and require a specific shutter speed. 
In this case, the shutter speed is your top priority, so choosing shutter-
priority autoexposure is a good choice. In dim lighting, remember that 
you may need to raise the ISO value in order to use a really fast shutter 
speed.
 
✓ You want moving objects to be blurred so that you convey a sense of 
motion. When shooting fountains and waterfalls, for example, you can 
give the water a misty look by slowing down the shutter, as shown in 
Figure 5-9. The shutter speed for the left image was 1/200 second; the 
right image, 1/20 second. Here again, shutter speed is critical to the look 
of your photo, so shutter-priority autoexposure is the right choice.
 
 For a very slow shutter speed, use a tripod or set your camera on some-
thing that’s not moving (like a rock or a ledge — just be careful that your 
camera doesn’t fall off!). If you try to handhold the camera at slow shut-
ter speeds, camera shake during the exposure may result in blurring of 
the entire scene.
 
✓ You want to control depth of field. Depth of field, as you may remem-
ber if you read the first part of this chapter, determines the distance 
over which objects in the scene stay sharply focused. And one way to 

120
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
control depth of field is via the aperture setting (f-stop). So if depth of 
field is your primary creative concern, set the camera to aperture-priority 
mode and dial in the f-stop that gives the depth-of-field result you’re 
after. Do be careful to also monitor the shutter speed that the camera 
selects, however, making sure that it doesn’t drop so low that you risk 
blurring the image due to camera shake. If that happens, you can either 
increase the ISO, which should allow a faster shutter speed, or grab a 
tripod.

Exploring Even More Exposure Features
Depending on your camera, you may have access to a slew of other exposure-
related options. The next several sections describe the most common of 
these features.

 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
Exposure metering modes
 
Many cameras offer a choice of exposure metering modes. (Check your 
manual to find out what buttons or menu commands to use to access the dif-
ferent modes.) In plain English, metering mode refers to the way in which the 
camera’s exposure mechanism meters — measures — the light in the scene 
while calculating the proper exposure for your photograph. The typical 
options are as follows:
 
✓ Matrix metering: Also known by other names, including multizone meter-
ing, evaluative metering, or pattern metering, this mode divides the image 
frame into a grid (matrix) and analyzes the light at many different points 
on the grid. The camera then chooses an exposure that best captures 
both shadowed and brightly lit portions of the scene. This mode is typi-
cally the default setting and works well in most situations.
 
✓ Center-weighted metering: When set to this mode, the camera mea-
sures the light in the entire frame but assigns a greater importance — 
weight — to the center of the frame. Use this mode when you’re more 
concerned about how stuff in the center of your picture looks than stuff 
around the edges. (How’s that for technical advice?)
 
✓ Spot metering: In this mode, the camera measures the light only at the 
center of the frame. Or, on some high-end cameras, you can shift where 
the metering spot is located in the frame.
Spot and center-weighted metering are especially helpful when the back-
ground is much brighter or darker than the subject. In matrix metering mode, 
your subject may be under- or overexposed because the camera adjusts the 
exposure to account for the brightness of the background.
Figure 5-10 offers an example. The left image was taken using matrix meter-
ing. Because the camera saw so much darkness in the frame, it used an expo-
sure that left the white rose very overexposed — almost no detail remains in 
the petals.
Changing to spot metering corrected the white rose, but left the red rose too 
dark, as shown in the middle image. For this scene, center-weighted metering 
produced the best exposure balance. However, if that red rose were out of 
the picture, the spot-metering image would be preferable because the white 
rose retains more detail.

Of course, when you switch to spot or center-weighted metering, your back-
ground may become too dark or too bright. On some newer cameras, you 
may find an option that brightens the shadows without also making the high-
lights too bright — Nikon calls this feature Active D-Lighting, for example, 
and Canon calls it Highlight Tone Priority. But if your camera doesn’t offer 
such options, you just have to choose which part of the scene is the most 
important, exposure-wise.
Keep in mind, too, that you can correct minor lighting and exposure prob-
lems in the photo-editing stage. Generally speaking, making a too-dark image 
brighter is easier than correcting an overexposed (too bright) image. So if 
you can’t seem to get the exposure just right, opt for a slightly underexposed 
image rather than an overexposed one.
Exposure histograms
Many digital cameras today can display on the monitor a histogram, which 
helps you evaluate the exposure of an image during playback. 
The histogram is simply a chart that plots out the brightness values for all 
the pixels in your photo. You can see a sample histogram, along with the 
photo it represents in Figure 5-11. The horizontal axis of the chart displays 
brightness values, with shadows on the left and highlights on the right. The 
vertical axis shows you how many pixels fall at each brightness value. So 
a spike at any point indicates that you have lots of pixels at that particular 
brightness value.

123
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
 
Shadows
Highlights
 
Figure 5-11: A histogram plots out the brightness values of all pixels in your image.
By reading the histogram, you can quickly see whether your picture may 
be underexposed (too dark) or overexposed (too light). Why not just see 
how the picture looks in the monitor, you ask? Because the photo may look 
brighter or darker than it actually is depending on the ambient light in which 
you view it and on the inherent brightness of the monitor itself. A histogram, 
on the other hand, is a scientific measurement of the actual image brightness. 
In fact, for some professional photographers, the histogram has replaced the 
light meter as a better on-the-fly measurement and representation of what 
they’re shooting.
Normally, a histogram that resembles a bell-shaped curve, or something that 
looks close to it, is good because well-exposed photos typically contain more 
midtones (areas of medium brightness), accented by highlights and shadows. 
This isn’t true exclusively, of course, and sometimes you may want more 
shadow or highlight in an image depending on your subject.
However, if you look at your camera’s histogram and it has a big spike to 
the left, it may be that your photo is too dark, in which case you need to 
adjust your exposure settings or add a flash. If it’s spiked to the right, your 
photo may be too bright, and you may need to use a faster shutter speed or 
a higher f-stop (or both). It’s normal to have a few odd spikes here and there, 
though; don’t demand that every image be a perfect curve. In other words, 

124
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
a histogram is a general guideline and reference tool, not an absolute determin-
ing factor for how your image needs to be adjusted. Sorry, you statisticians out 
there — we’re talking art here!
Exposure compensation 
Whether you’re working in fully automatic mode, an automatic scene mode, or 
using shutter- or aperture-priority mode, you may be able to tweak the expo-
sure by using exposure compensation, often referred to as EV (exposure value) 
compensation. This control bumps the exposure up or down a few notches 
from what the camera’s autoexposure computer thinks is appropriate.
How you get to the exposure compensation settings varies from camera to 
camera. But you typically choose from settings such as +0.7, +0.3, 0.0, –0.3, 
–0.7, and so on, with the 0.0 representing the default autoexposure setting. (If 
you’re an old-school photographer, it may help you to know that these set-
tings represent exposure stops. For example, EV –0.3 reduces the exposure 
by one-third of a stop.)
 
Regardless of how you access the EV 
control, the adjustment works the 
same way:
 
✓ To produce a brighter image, raise 
the EV value.
 
✓ To produce a darker picture, lower 
the EV value.
Different cameras provide you with dif-
ferent ranges of EV options, and the 
extent to which an increase or decrease 
in the value affects your image also 
varies from camera to camera. But 
Figures 5-12 through 5-14 give you an 
idea of the impact you can make with EV 
compensation.
The image in Figure 5-12 shows the expo-
sure that the camera created at EV 0.0. 
The two images in Figure 5-13 show the 
same shot taken with negative EV values. 
Figure 5-14 shows what happened with 
positive EV values.

The candle scene points out the benefits of exposure compensation. Suppose 
that you wanted an exposure dark enough to allow the candle flame to create 
a soft glow and to capture the contrast between the shadowed background 
areas and the bands of strong afternoon sunshine filtering into the scene. If 
the non-adjusted exposure (EV 0.0) turns out to be a bit brighter than you 
had in mind, you can just play with the EV values until you come up with a 
mix of shadows and highlights that suit your taste.
 
Don’t forget that if your camera offers a choice of metering modes, you may 
want to experiment with changing the metering mode as well as using EV 
adjustment. Adjusting the metering mode changes the area of the frame that 
the camera considers when making its exposure decision. The candle image 
was taken using matrix metering mode, which bases exposure on the entire 
frame.
Exposure bracketing
 
Your camera’s monitor gives you 
a good idea of whether your image 
is properly exposed. But don’t rely 
entirely on the monitor because it 
doesn’t provide an absolutely accurate 
rendition of your image. Your actual 
image may be brighter or darker than 
it appears on the monitor, especially if 
your camera enables you to adjust the 
brightness of the monitor display.
If your camera offers a histogram, 
explained a few sections ago, you can get 
a more accurate idea of exposure. Still, to 
make sure that you get at least one cor-
rectly exposed image, try to bracket your 
shots if your camera offers exposure-
adjustment controls. Bracketing means 
to record the same scene at several 
different exposure settings, usually one 
brighter and one darker than your main 
shot, as shown in Figure 5-15.
How you accomplish bracketing 
depends on what exposure modes are 
available to you:
Figure 5-15: Automatic bracketing records 
the same subject several times, using 
different exposure settings for each shot.

127
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
 
✓ In manual exposure mode, you can just change the shutter speed, or 
aperture, or both between each shot.
 
✓ In automatic exposure modes (including shutter- and aperture-priority 
autoexposure modes), shoot the subject using three different exposure 
compensation settings. 
Either way, you wind up with three versions of the shot, covering the pos-
sibility of your photo being too dark or too light. Of course, this assumes that 
you have the luxury of taking three shots of the same subject. It might be 
tough to set this up if you’re trying to get a shot of your sister kissing her new 
husband at the altar — she’s not likely to wait for you to take three shots.
 
Some cameras also offer automatic exposure bracketing. With this feature, 
often abbreviated as AEB, you take three successive shots, and the camera 
automatically creates three different exposures. Some cameras even let 
you adjust the amount of difference between the shots. Check your camera 
instruction book to find out what your camera offers and how it works. 
Excuse me, can you turn down the sun?
Adding more light to a scene is considerably 
easier than reducing the light. If you’re shoot-
ing outdoors, you can’t exactly hit the dimmer 
switch on the sun. If the light is too strong, you 
really have only a few options. You can move 
the subject into the shade (in which case you 
can use a flash to light the subject), or, on some 
cameras, reduce the exposure by lowering the 
EV value.
If you have the opportunity, try to avoid shoot-
ing under a bright midday sun. You’re better off 
waiting until later in the day during what pho-
tographers call the “golden hour.” An hour or 
two before sunset, the sun is low in the sky, 
shadows are long, and the sun shines a golden, 
lush light onto subjects.
If you do need to shoot in bright sunlight and 
you can’t find a suitable shady backdrop, you 
can create one with a piece of cardboard. Just 
have a friend hold the cardboard between the 
sun and the subject. Voilà! — instant shade. By 
moving the cardboard around, you can vary the 
amount of light that hits the subject. You can 
also buy relatively inexpensive, collapsible, and 
very portable photographic reflectors that are 
made to do this. Some of them are made of gold- 
or silver-colored material so that they can do 
dual duty: When you need to add light instead 
of obscure it, you can use them to bounce the 
available light onto your subject.

128
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Looking at Lighting
Photography lighting is a combination of art and science, and entire books 
are devoted to the subject. You can choose lighting solutions that range from 
using ambient (natural) light, such as sunlight streaming through a window, 
all the way to blowing your entire paycheck on an expensive professional 
lighting kit. Whatever you do, it’s important to remember that lighting is a 
tool you use to enhance your composition — it’s not an end in itself. 
 
The rest of this chapter explores some specific lighting options and tech-
niques. But here are some general lighting tips to help you take better 
photos:
 
✓ Minimize shadows. When you add light to a subject, whether with a 
flash, a house lamp, or by putting the subject in front of a window, you 
will probably add some shadows to your image. Be aware of them, and 
avoid shadows that are too harsh or that affect your composition. This 
may mean adding more lights to “fill in” the shadows. You can also 
reduce shadowing by putting more distance between your subject and 
the background.
 
✓ But sometimes, shadows work well. The artist in you may find that an 
interesting shadow adds character and dramatic effect to your image. 
Don’t hesitate to use shadows to effect if you want that kind of shot. 
(This approach isn’t great for a family portrait, though!) 
 
✓ Good lighting doesn’t have to be expensive. You don’t necessarily 
have to have a pro lighting kit or an expensive external flash to get good 
results. With a couple of well-placed house lamps or an inexpensive light 
and a cone from the local hardware store, you may be able to get per-
fectly acceptable results.
 
✓ The larger the light, the more flattering the result. Generally speaking, 
a larger light creates a softer, more even light that wraps around the 
subject and produces fewer harsh shadows. This type of illumination is 
especially nice for shooting portraits.
 
✓ Diffuse the situation. Some lights — especially built-in flash units — 
create very harsh light. For a better result, try to diffuse the light. Doing 
so dramatically improves the quality of your images, making things like 
skin tones, shadows, and contrast look much better. 

129
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
 
 Inexpensive diffusers such as 
the one shown in Figure 5-16, 
from LumiQuest (about $13, 
www.lumiquest.com) work well 
when you use a built-in flash. 
For other types of light, you can 
buy professional diffusers (such 
as a softbox or umbrella), but 
you can also try just hanging a 
sheet or sheer white curtain in 
front of your lights. (Be careful 
when using lights that get very 
hot, of course.)
 
✓ A little backlighting can help. 
Having a limited light behind 
your subject can help add 
some depth to your photo. For 
example, you might place a light 
on the floor, pointed upwards, 
behind a portrait subject. 
 
✓ Try bouncing the light. When 
using an artificial light source, 
whether it’s a true-blue pho-
tography light or a makeshift solution like a desk lamp, you get better 
results if you don’t aim the light directly at the object you’re photo-
graphing. Instead, aim the light at the background and let the light 
bounce off that surface onto your subject. For example, when shooting a 
portrait, bounce the light off the ceiling. This technique further diffuses 
the light, creating a softer illumination of your subject.
 
✓ Pay attention to color when using multiple light sources. If you light 
a scene with, say, a flash and a household lamp, the camera may not 
render colors correctly. This issue is related to white balance, a color 
feature that you can explore in Chapter 6.
Using a built-in flash
Most cameras have a built-in flash that operates in several modes. In addition 
to automatic mode, in which the camera gauges the available light and fires 
the flash if needed, you typically get the following options: fill flash, no flash, 
Figure 5-16: You can buy diffusers that soften 
the harsh light of a built-in flash.

130
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
red-eye reduction, and nighttime flash (called slow-sync flash). Higher-end 
cameras allow you to add an external flash unit as well.
The next several sections explain these additional flash options.
Fill flash (or force flash) 
This mode triggers the flash regardless of the light in the scene. Fill-flash 
mode is especially helpful for outdoor shots, such as the one in Figure 5-17. 
The first image shows the result of using automatic flash mode. Because the 
picture was taken on a sunny day, the camera didn’t see the need for a flash. 
But without flash, the shadow from the hat obscured the subject’s eyes. 
Switching to fill-flash mode and forcing the flash to fire threw some additional 
light on her face, bringing her eyes into visible range.
Figure 5-17: Adding flash light brings the eyes out from the shadows created by the hat.
No flash
Choose this setting when you don’t want to use the flash, no way, no how. 
You may also want to turn off the flash simply because the quality of the 
existing light is part of what makes the scene compelling, for example. Or you 

131
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
may want to go flashless when you’re shooting highly reflective objects, 
such as glass or metal, because the flash can cause blown highlights (areas 
that are completely white, with no tonal detail). The upcoming “Lighting 
Shiny Objects” section offers more help with this problem. And of course, 
some venues, such as museums and churches, often don’t permit flash 
photography.
 
When you turn off the flash in an autoexposure mode, the camera may 
reduce the shutter speed to compensate for the dim lighting. That means 
that you need to hold the camera steady for a longer period to avoid blurry 
images. Use a tripod or otherwise brace the camera for best results. You also 
can consider raising the ISO setting to increase the camera’s sensitivity to 
light (but be aware that you may introduce noise into the photo).
Flash with red-eye reduction
Anyone who’s taken people pictures with a point-and-shoot camera — digital 
or film — is familiar with the so-called red-eye problem. The flash reflects 
against the subject’s retinas, and the result is a demonic red glint in the eye. 
Red-eye reduction mode aims to thwart this phenomenon by firing a low-
power flash before the “real” flash goes off or by emitting a beam of light 
from a lamp on the camera body for a second or two prior to capturing the 
image. The idea is that the prelight, if you will, causes the pupil of the eye 
to shut down a little, thereby lessening the chances of a reflection when the 
final flash goes off.
Unfortunately, red-eye reduction flash doesn’t always work perfectly. Often, 
you still wind up with fire in the eyes — hey, the manufacturer only promised 
to reduce red-eye, not eliminate it, right? Worse, your subjects sometimes 
think the prelight is the actual flash and start walking away or blink just when 
the picture is being captured. So if you shoot with red-eye mode turned on, 
be sure to explain to your subjects what’s going to happen.
 
The good news is that, because you’re shooting digitally, you can repair red-
eye easily. Some cameras have an in-camera red-eye remover that you can 
apply after you take a picture. If not, the fix is easy to make in a photo-editing 
program. Chapter 9 shows you how. 
Slow-sync flash
Slow-sync flash, which sometimes goes by the name nighttime flash, increases 
the exposure time beyond what the camera normally sets for flash pictures.
With a normal flash, your main subject is illuminated, but background ele-
ments beyond the reach of the flash are dark, as in the top example in 
Figure 5-18. The longer exposure time provided by slow-sync flash allows 
more ambient light to enter the camera, resulting in a lighter background, as 
shown in the lower example in Figure 5-18.

132
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Whether a brighter background is desirable 
depends upon the subject and your artistic mood. 
However, remember that the slower shutter speed 
required for slow-sync flash can easily result in 
a blurred image; both camera and subject must 
remain absolutely still during the entire exposure 
to avoid that problem. As a point of reference, 
the exposure time for the normal flash example in 
Figure 5-18 was 1/60 second, while the slow-sync 
exposure time was a full five seconds. In addition, 
colors in slow-sync pictures may appear slightly 
warmer because of the white-balance issues that 
Chapter 6 discusses.
Using an external flash
Although your camera’s built-in flash offers a con-
venient alternative for lighting your scene, the light 
it produces is typically narrowly focused and fairly 
harsh. When you’re shooting your subject at close 
range, a built-in flash can leave some portions of 
the image overexposed or even cause blown 
highlights — areas that are so overexposed that 
they are completely white, without any detail. 
And a built-in flash often leads to red-eyed people, 
as all of us know too well. 
Some digital cameras can accept an auxiliary flash 
unit, which helps reduce blown highlights and 
red-eye because you can move the flash farther 
away from, or at a different angle to, the subject. 
(The closer the flash is to the lens, and the more 
direct the angle to the subject’s eyes, the better 
the chance of red-eye.) Additionally, external flash 
heads typically produce a more pleasing result, 
illuminating the subject with a more wide-spread, 
and thus softer, light. And if you buy a flash with a rotating head like the one 
shown in Figure 5-19, you can bounce the light for an even more diffused 
effect.
When you attach an external flash, the camera’s on-board flash is disabled (if 
the camera has one), but the auxiliary flash can work automatically with the 
camera, just like an on-camera flash can. This option is great for profession-
als and photo enthusiasts who have the expertise and equipment to use it; 
check your camera manual to find out what type of external flash works with 
your camera and how to connect the flash.
Figure 5-18: Slow-sync flash 
produces a brighter background 
than normal flash mode.

133
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
 
If your camera doesn’t offer an external 
flash connection, you can use so-called 
“slave” flash units. These small, self-
contained, battery-operated flash units 
have built-in photosensitive eyes that 
trigger the supplemental flash when the 
camera’s flash goes off. If you’re trying to 
photograph an event in a room that’s dimly 
lit, you can put several slave units in differ-
ent places. All the units fire when you take 
a picture anywhere in the room.
Switching on additional 
lights
You often can get better results, light-
ing wise, if you turn off the flash and use 
another light source to illuminate the 
scene. Studio lights are the solution used 
by pro photographers and even some seri-
ous photography enthusiasts. Or you may 
want to invest in some inexpensive photo-
flood lights — these are the same kind of lights used with video camcorders 
and are sometimes called “hot” lights because they “burn” continuously.
But you really don’t need to go out 
and spend a fortune on lighting 
equipment. If you get creative, you 
can probably figure out a lighting 
solution using stuff you already have 
around the house. 
You can even use something like 
the setup shown in Figure 5-20. The 
white background is nothing more 
than a cardboard presentation easel 
purchased at an art and education 
supply store — teachers use these 
things to create classroom displays. 
Another white board covers the 
table top.
The easel and board brighten the 
subject because they reflect light 
Figure 5-19: An external flash with a 
rotating head offers more flexibility and 
better illumination than a built-in flash.
Figure 5-20: You can create a makeshift studio 
using nothing more than a white presentation 
easel, a tripod, and household lamp.

134
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
onto it. If you need still more light, you can switch on a regular old desk lamp 
or a small clip-on shop light (the kind you buy in hardware stores). And if you 
want a colored background instead of a white one, just clip a piece of colored 
tissue paper, also bought at that education supply store, to the easel. Fabric 
remnants from your local sewing store provide another source of inexpen-
sive backdrops. 
Okay, so professional photographers and serious amateurs may turn up their 
noses at these cheap little setups. But hey, whatever works, works. Besides, 
you’ve already spent a good sum of money on your camera, so why not save 
a few bucks where you can?
Lighting shiny objects
When you shoot shiny objects such as jewelry, glass, chrome, or porcelain, 
lighting presents a real dilemma. Any light source that shines directly on the 
object can bounce off the surface and cause blown highlights, as shown in 
the left image in Figure 5-21. In addition, the light source or other objects 
in the room may be reflected in the surface of the object you want to shoot. 
For the jewelry shot, the reflections in the crystal earrings also distorted 
color.
 
 
 Figure 5-21: Direct lighting creates blown highlights (left); working with a diffused light 
source solves the problem (right).
Professional photographers invest in expensive lighting setups to avoid these 
problems when shooting product shots like the one in Figure 5-21. If you’re 

135
 Chapter 5: Controlling Exposure
not in the professional category — or just don’t have a huge budget for outfit-
ting a studio — try these tricks to get decent pictures of shiny stuff:
 
✓ Turn off your camera’s built-in flash and find another way to light 
the object. A built-in flash creates a strong, focused light source that’s 
bound to create problems. See earlier sections in this chapter to find out 
how various digital camera features may enable you to get a good expo-
sure without using a flash.
 
✓ Find a way to diffuse the lighting. Placing a white curtain or sheet 
between the light source and the object not only softens the light and 
helps prevent blown highlights, but also prevents unwanted reflections.
 
✓ If you regularly need to photograph reflective objects, you may want 
to invest in a light cube or tent. The left photo in Figure 5-22 shows one 
such product, from Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com). You can put 
the objects you want to shoot inside the cube and then position your 
lights outside of it. The white cube panels serve to diffuse the light and 
also provide a nice, plain backdrop for your subject.
 
 For larger objects, you can buy a light tent, which is a little bit like 
a teepee made of white cloth. You can put your subject inside and 
then shoot through a hole in the text, as shown in the right photo in 
Figure 5-22, which features a tent from Lastolite (www.lastolite.com). 
Light cubes and tents come in a wide variety of sizes and prices, but 
unless you’re shooting huge objects, you should be able to find a good 
solution for under $100 or so. The price may seem a little steep at first, 
but if you do a lot of this type of photography, the amount of time and 
frustration it can save is well worth your investment.

Manipulating Focus and Color
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring autofocus features
▶ Focusing manually
▶ Playing with depth of field
▶ Understanding white balance
▶ Adjusting photo colors
T
oday’s digital cameras offer an abundance of focus and color features. 
But for many new digital photographers, sorting through all the options 
is so overwhelming that they throw up their hands, set everything to “auto-
matic,” and let the camera take the focus and color reins. That’s a shame, 
because taking just a little time to understand these features can lead 
to much more artful photographs — not to mention a greatly 
reduced number of pictures that are spoiled by focus or 
color miscues.
This chapter puts you on the path to mastering both 
focus and color. The first part details the most 
important aspects of focus, covering such topics 
as getting the best results from your camera’s 
autofocusing system and achieving different cre-
ative goals by manipulating depth of field (the zone 
of sharp focus). Following that discussion, the 
second part of the chapter dives into the color pool, 
explaining how to deal with off-kilter colors and offer-
ing tips about some subtle color adjustments that you 
can use to enhance different subjects.
Diagnosing Focus Problems
Several factors can affect focus, so in order to find the right solution to a 
focusing concern, you first have to identify the cause. Here’s a quick symp-
tom list that will point you in the right direction:

138
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
✓ My entire picture is blurry. Illustrated in Figure 6-1, this problem is easy 
to diagnose: Either the camera moved during the exposure or, if you’re 
shooting close-ups, your lens is too close to the subject. See the sidebar 
“Hold that thing still!” (later in the chapter) for a list of tricks to avoid 
camera shake; for close-up shooting, check your camera manual to 
determine the minimum close-focusing distance of your lens.
 
 
Figure 6-1: Camera shake causes allover blur (left); use a tripod to ensure sharp shots (right).
 
✓ My subject is blurry, but the rest of the picture is sharp. This problem 
can be caused by a couple of errors:
 
• The subject moved. To catch a tack-sharp picture of a moving sub-
ject, you need a fast shutter speed (how fast depends on the speed 
of the subject). If your camera offers manual exposure mode or 
shutter-priority exposure mode, just dial in a faster shutter speed 
and try again. You can also set the camera to a Sports scene mode 
to select a higher shutter speed automatically, although you lose 
control over the exact shutter setting in that mode.
 
 Remember that in order to maintain the proper exposure when 
you raise the shutter speed, you need to either choose a lower 
f-stop setting (to allow more light into the camera) or raise the ISO 
setting (to make the camera more sensitive to light). For more on 

139
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
shutter speed and exposure, see Chapter 5; for more about auto-
matic scene modes, head to Chapter 3. Also check out Chapter 7, 
which offers more tips for shooting a moving target.
 
• The subject is outside the focusing zone. The camera establishes 
focus based on a particular area of the frame, and on some 
cameras, that area varies, depending on certain focusing options 
you can select. For example, some autofocusing systems enable 
you to establish focus on the center of the frame or some other 
specific point in the frame. Or you may be able to base focus on 
the average position of all objects throughout the entire frame. So 
you need to study your manual to find out what focusing zone the 
camera is using, and then make sure that your subject is within 
the required area when you set focus. See the upcoming section 
“Taking advantage of autofocus” for a bit more information on 
this subject.
 
✓ I want more or less of the scene to be sharply focused. When you focus 
the camera, whether you do it manually or by using autofocus, you 
establish the point of sharpest focus. You also can control the distance 
over which that sharp focus is maintained, otherwise known as the 
depth of field. For example, you can create a composition in which your 
main subject is sharp, but everything a few feet away from the subject 
is in soft focus. Or you can do the opposite, keeping the distant objects 
sharp as well.
 
 You manipulate depth of field not by using focusing controls, but by 
adjusting aperture (f-stop), focal length, and camera-to-subject distance. 
See the section “Showing Some Depth of Field,” later in this chapter, for 
details.
 
✓ I can’t get the camera to focus at all. Assuming that your camera 
isn’t broken, you may simply be too close to your subject. Again, 
every camera has a close-focusing limit, which you should be able to 
de termine with a look at your camera manual. Another possible cause 
is the subject itself: In autofocus mode, some subjects can also give the 
camera fits, causing the autofocus motor to “hunt” continuously for a 
target. See the section “Taking advantage of autofocus” for tips on how 
to solve this problem.
 
✓ The focus of my pictures is fine, but things look blurry through the 
viewfinder. Try adjusting the viewfinder to your eyesight. You do this 
by using a diopter adjustment control, typically found near the viewfinder. 
Chapter 3 explains how to take this critical step. The other possibility 
is that your viewfinder is simply dirty; you can wipe it clean by using a 
cloth or tissue specially made for use with cameras.

Understanding Focusing Systems
Like film cameras, digital cameras offer a variety of focusing features to help 
you capture sharp images with ease. The following sections describe the 
most common focusing schemes and how you can make the most of them.
Working with fixed-focus cameras
Fixed-focus cameras are just that — the focus is set at the factory and can’t 
be changed. The camera is designed to capture sharply any subject within a 
certain distance from the lens. Subjects outside that range appear blurry. 
 
Fixed-focus cameras sometimes are called focus-free cameras because you’re 
free of the chore of setting the focus before you shoot. But this term is a mis-
nomer, because even though you can’t adjust the focus, you have to remem-
ber to keep the subject within the camera’s focusing range. There is no such 
thing as a (focus-) free lunch.
Be sure to check your camera manual to find out how much distance to put 
between your camera and your subject. Blurry images usually result from 
having your subject too close to the camera; most fixed-focus cameras are 
engineered to focus sharply from a few feet away from the camera to infinity.
Taking advantage of autofocus
 
Most digital cameras or lenses used with them (in the case of some digital 
SLRs) offer autofocus, which means that the camera automatically adjusts 
the focus after measuring the distance between the lens and subject. For 
autofocus to work, you need to take a two-stage approach to pressing the 
shutter button, as follows: 
 
1. Be sure that autofocusing is enabled.
 
 On a digital SLR, you may find a control on the lens or camera body that 
switches the system from manual to autofocus. For example, Figure 6-2 
shows the switch as it appears on one Nikon dSLR and lens combo. You 
may also need to enable autofocusing through a menu option. 
 
 On a point-and-shoot camera that offers the choice between manual and 
autofocusing, check your manual to find out how to switch between the 
two — you likely establish the setting through a camera menu.
 
2. Frame the picture so that your subject is within the current autofocus 
area.
 
 The autofocus area refers to the part of the frame that the camera uses 
to establish focus. This area can vary, depending on the autofocus 
system and settings you’re using; see the notes following these steps 
for help.

141
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
3. Press the shutter button halfway and hold it there.
 
 Your camera analyzes the picture and sets the focus. To let you know 
that focus is established, the camera sends you some sort of signal: 
Usually, a little light in or near 
the viewfinder turns green, or the 
camera makes a beeping noise 
(some cameras let you turn off the 
beep, which can be annoying in a 
quiet place). Some cameras also 
display one or more little lighted 
squares or brackets in the view-
finder to tell you what part of the 
frame the camera used when set-
ting focus.
 
 Whether or not focus is set in 
stone at this point depends on the 
autofocus mode. Some cameras 
offer a continuous autofocus mode 
that adjusts focus as needed if 
the subject moves after focus is 
initially established. Again, see the 
list of upcoming tips for details.
 
4. After focus is established, press 
the shutter button the rest of the 
way to take the picture.
Although autofocus is a great photography tool, you need to understand a 
few things about how your camera goes about its focusing work in order to 
take full advantage of this feature. Here’s the condensed version of the auto-
focusing manual:
 
✓ Autofocus systems: The most common autofocusing schemes found on 
today’s digital cameras fall into two main categories:
 
• Single-spot focus: With this type of autofocus, the camera reads the 
distance of the element that’s at a specific position of the frame. 
Usually, the focus area is the center of the frame. But on some 
cameras, you can select from several different focus areas through-
out the frame.
 
• Multi-spot focus: The camera measures the distance at several spots 
around the frame and sets focus relative to the nearest object or 
multiple points on an object taking up a large percentage of the 
frame (such as a group of people posing).
Autofocus/Manual focus switch
Figure 6-2: Some SLR lenses have a switch 
that sets the camera to autofocus mode.

142
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
 You need to know how your camera adjusts focus so that before you 
lock in the focus with the press-and-hold method just described, you 
frame the picture so the subject is within the area that the autofocus 
mechanism reads.
 
 Some cameras enable you to choose which of these two types of focus-
ing you want to use for a particular shot, so check your camera manual 
for details. Look for something that goes by a name such as AF mode, 
AF-area mode, and the like. (The AF stands for autofocus.)
 
✓ Autofocus area indicators: Depending on its autofocusing system, your 
camera may display little dots or brackets in the viewfinder or monitor 
to indicate the areas used to establish focus. As an example, Figure 6-3 
shows you how the markers appear on a Canon camera that has a nine-
point autofocusing system and a Nikon camera that has a three-point 
autofocusing system. When you press the shutter button halfway, these 
indicators light or blink to tell you where the camera set focus.
 
 Check your camera manual to see what the different viewfinder and 
monitor marks mean, though; not all are related to focusing. The center 
circle in the viewfinder shown on the left in Figure 6-3, for example, 
indicates the spot-metering zone, an exposure feature offered on some 
Canon cameras. And on some cameras, marks are provided to help you 
frame the picture. (See the sidebar, “A Parallax! A Parallax!,” in Chapter 3, 
for more information.)
 
✓ Single-servo autofocus: The default autofocus setup on most digital 
cameras is to lock focus when you press and hold the shutter button 
halfway down. As long as you keep that button halfway down, focus 
remains locked. This focusing scheme is sometimes called single-servo 
autofocus but also goes by certain other names, such as one-shot 
autofocus.
 
 
Figure 6-3: The autofocus areas may be indicated by little squares or brackets.

143
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 Single-servo autofocus enables you to focus on a subject even if you 
want to frame the shot so that the subject doesn’t fall into the autofocus 
area. For example, suppose that your camera bases focus on the center 
of the frame, but you want your subject to appear off-center in the pic-
ture. Frame the picture initially so that the subject is centered and then 
press the shutter button halfway. After focus is established, keep the 
button halfway down, reframe the shot as desired, and then press the 
shutter button the rest of the way. Figure 6-4 illustrates this technique.
 
 
Figure 6-4: After locking focus on your subject, 
 
you can reframe the shot if you want.
 
✓ Continuous-servo autofocus: Using single-servo autofocus to shoot a 
moving subject can be difficult. Say that you’re trying to photograph a 
child running up the driveway toward you, for example. You frame the 
shot and lock focus at the point the little one starts off. But by the time 
you actually take the shot, the child is halfway up the driveway — and 
no longer in focus.
 
 You can just keep locking and then relocking focus as needed, but that’s 
difficult to accomplish and also a bit of a pain — press halfway, release, 
press halfway, release, mutter under breath, press halfway . . . you get 

144
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
the idea. To offer a better solution, some higher-end cameras offer 
continuous-servo autofocus. In this mode, you still press the shutter 
button halfway to establish the initial focusing distance. But if the 
camera detects motion in front of the lens, it automatically adjusts focus 
as needed right up to the time you press the button the rest of the way 
to snap the picture.
 
 Note that this autofocusing feature goes by different names depend-
ing on the manufacturer. Canon calls it AI Servo, for example — the AI 
standing for artificial intelligence. And some other manufacturers use the 
term dynamic autofocus.
 
 Whatever its name, this autofocusing feature still requires some input 
from you after you depress the shutter button halfway. In order for the 
camera to correctly track focus, you typically must keep your moving 
target within the active autofocus area, which may mean reframing the 
shot after you initially establish focus.
 
✓ Auto-servo autofocus: In some cases, you also get a third autofocus 
mode in which the camera automatically shifts from single-servo auto-
focus to continuous-servo autofocus if it detects movement in front of 
the lens. Again, the mode name depends on the camera maker; on Canon 
cameras, this mode is called AI Focus, for example.
 
✓ Infinity and macro focusing modes: Some point-and-shoot cameras that 
offer autofocus provide you with one or both of these specialty focus 
modes. Macro mode allows you to focus at a closer distance than you 
normally could; it’s designed for shooting close-ups, in other words. 
Infinity mode, sometimes also called landscape focusing mode, does the 
opposite: It sets focus at the farthest point possible and is designed for 
shooting subjects at a long distance. When you switch to these modes, 
you need to make sure that your subject falls within the focusing range 
of the selected mode. Check your camera’s manual to find out the 
proper camera-to-subject distance.
 
 Also, don’t confuse these specialty focus modes with the auto-
matic exposure scene modes that go by the same name (Macro and 
Landscape). Those modes are also geared to shooting close-ups and 
landscapes, but they typically affect exposure, color, contrast, and other 
picture characteristics, not focus distance. They may, however, affect 
depth of field, which controls the zone of sharp focus. See Chapter 3 for 
more about scene modes.
Finally, know that even the most capable autofocus system may have trouble 
doing its job in dim lighting. Certain types of subjects also confuse autofocus 
mechanisms: objects behind vertical bars (such as a lion at the zoo), low-
contrast scenes (think gray boat sailing in foggy weather), and highly reflec-
tive objects are among the biggest trouble-makers.
If your camera offers manual focusing, the easiest solution is to switch to that 
mode and do the focus work yourself. The next section offers some manual 

145
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
focusing tips. If your camera doesn’t offer manual focus, you can fool the auto-
focus system by locking focus on something else that’s the same distance away 
from the lens as your subject. After you lock focus, reframe the shot if needed.
Focusing manually
On a digital SLR, you can opt out of autofocus and instead twist the focusing ring 
on the lens to focus manually. You first may need to set a switch on the lens or 
camera body to the manual-focus mode, select manual focusing from a camera 
menu, or both. The steps here vary, as does the placement of the focusing ring, 
from camera to camera, so check out that instruction manual for details. 
A few, higher-end point-and-shoot digital cameras also offer manual focusing. 
Although some models offer a traditional focusing mechanism where you 
twist a focusing ring on the lens barrel, most require you to use menu con-
trols to select the distance at which you want the camera to focus.
Careful focusing is especially critical for close-up shots like the one in 
Figure 6-5 because being just an inch off in your focus judgment can mean 
an unacceptable picture. In this picture, for example, that inch worth of 
miscalculation would set focus on the stems rather than at the front part of 
the frame, where the most interesting textures occur. So when you shoot 
close-ups on a camera that requires you to dial in a specific focus distance, 
get out a ruler and make sure that you’re using the correct camera-to-subject 
distance. You can’t necessarily get a good idea of whether the focus is dead-
on from the viewfinder or LCD. And don’t forget to adjust your viewfinder to 
your eyesight, as explained in Chapter 3.

Showing Some Depth of Field
One way to become a more artful photographer is to learn how to control 
depth of field, which refers to the distance over which sharp focus is main-
tained. With short, or shallow depth of field, only objects close to the subject 
are sharp, as in the left image in Figure 6-6. This treatment is perfect for por-
traits because it prevents the background from drawing attention away from 
the subject.
Hold that thing still!
A blurry image isn’t always the result of poor 
focusing; you can also get fuzzy shots if you 
move the camera during the time the image is 
being captured. 
Holding the camera still is essential in any 
shooting situation, but it becomes especially 
important when the light is dim because a longer 
exposure time is needed. That means that you 
have to keep the camera steady longer than you 
do when shooting in bright light.
To help keep the camera still, try these tricks:
 ✓ Press your elbows against your sides as 
you snap the picture.
 ✓ Squeeze, don’t jab, the shutter button. Use a 
soft touch to minimize the chance of moving 
the camera when you press the shutter 
button.
 ✓ Place the camera on a countertop, table, or 
other still surface. Better yet, use a tripod. 
Chapter 2 offers tripod-buying advice.
 ✓ If your camera offers a self-timer feature, you 
can opt for hands-free shooting to eliminate 
any possibility of camera shake. Place the 
camera on a tripod, set the camera to self-
timer mode, and then press the shutter 
button (or do whatever your manual says 
to activate the self-timer mechanism). Then 
move away from the camera. After a few 
seconds, the camera snaps the picture for 
you automatically.
 
 Of course, if you own a camera that offers 
remote-control shooting, you can take 
advantage of that feature instead of the 
self-timer mode.
 ✓ If your camera or lens offers an image 
stabilization (or “anti-shake”) mode, make 
sure that it’s turned on when you don’t use a 
tripod. This feature can help you get crisper 
handheld results, especially when you’re 
using a slow shutter speed, a long, heavy 
lens, or both. Check your manual to find out 
whether the manufacturer recommends 
disabling the stabilization feature when the 
camera is mounted on a tripod, however.

Shallow depth of field
Large depth of field
 
Serge Timacheff
 
 Figure 6-6: Shallow depth of field is ideal for portraits (left); landscapes benefit from a longer 
zone of sharp focus (right).
When you want to give equal importance to everything in the frame, on the 
other hand, try a large depth of field, which extends the sharp focus zone 
over a greater distance from your point of focus. Landscapes and architec-
tural shots like the one on the right in Figure 6-6 typically benefit from a large 
depth of field. Focus in this image was set on the foreground figure, but the 
ones in the distance look nearly as sharp.
You can manipulate depth of field in three ways:
 
✓ Adjust the aperture (f-stop). Chapter 5 introduces you to the aperture 
setting, or f-stop, which is an exposure control. The f-stop also affects 
depth of field; the higher the f-stop number, the greater the depth of 
field. This option was used to produce the images in Figure 6-7, with an 
aperture of f/3.4 for the left image and f/11 for the right one.
 
 Remember, though, that f-stop and shutter speed are forever interwoven 
in the exposure equation. As you raise the f-stop, which reduces the size 
of the aperture, you must use a slower shutter speed to compensate 
for the smaller aperture opening. So, if you need a fast shutter speed to 
get a stop-action shot of a baseball player hitting a ball, you may have 

148
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
to live with a short depth of field because you need a wide aperture to 
expose the photo properly at that fast shutter speed. Alternatively, you 
can adjust the camera’s sensitivity to light via the ISO control. 
 
f/3.4
f/11
 
Figure 6-7: Changing the aperture is one way to adjust depth of field.
 
 Note, too, that a short depth of field can blur objects in front of your 
subject, too — it’s not always the background that blurs. For example, 
if you set focus on the yellow tulip in the background of the scene in 
Figure 6-7, the foreground tulip would blur with a short depth of field.
 
 If your camera offers aperture-priority autoexposure, try that mode when 
depth of field is your primary concern — your priority, in other words. In 
this mode, (normally identified by an “Av” or “A” on your camera’s mode 
dial), you set the f-stop, and the camera selects a shutter speed that will 
deliver a good exposure. The range of f-stops you can choose depends on 
your lens; check the camera manual for the specifics.
 
 Even if your camera doesn’t offer manual or aperture-priority control, 
you may be able to control depth of field to some extent. Some of the 
scene modes found on many cameras are designed to produce the depth 
of field appropriate for certain subjects. For example, Portrait mode 
typically selects a wide aperture setting to produce a shallow depth of 

149
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
field, and Landscape mode typically selects a narrow aperture to pro-
duce a greater depth of field. Additionally, some Canon cameras offer 
an automatic depth-of-field setting (A-DEP), which attempts to select an 
aperture that will keep all major objects in the frame in the sharp focus 
zone. The extent to which these automatic modes can adjust aperture 
depends on the light, of course, so they’re not always going to produce 
the desired results in terms of depth of field. Chapter 3 talks more about 
scene modes.
 
✓ Change the lens focal length. Focal length, measured in millimeters, 
determines the camera’s angle of view, how large objects appear in the 
frame, and depth of field. A long focal length, such as you get from a tele-
photo lens, produces a shallow depth of field. A wide-angle lens, on the 
other hand, has a short focal length and produces a large depth of field.
 
 Figure 6-8 offers an example. Both photos were taken at an aperture of 
f/5.6; however, the top image was taken at a shorter focal length (wider 
angle), so more of the scene remains in the sharp-focus zone. Note that 
both focal lengths here are in the telephoto range, which means that 
depth of field is relatively shallow even in the top image.
 
 If you have an optical zoom lens, you can change focal length just by 
zooming in and out. (Your manual should spell out the range of focal 
lengths for the lens.) Or, if you own a digital SLR, you can buy different 
lenses with different focal lengths or even a couple of lenses that each 
offer a different zoom range. If your camera doesn’t have an optical 
zoom, though, you’re stuck with a single focal length.
 
 Digital zoom does not produce a shift in depth of field; digital zoom 
simply results in cropping and enlarging your existing image. (See 
Chapter 1 for more about camera lenses and types of zooms.)
 
✓ Change the distance between camera and subject. As you move closer 
to your subject, you decrease depth of field; as you move away, you 
extend depth of field.
 
Practicing these depth-of-field techniques is important because they help you 
achieve different compositional aims. Consider the pictures in Figure 6-9, for 
example. The subjects look great in both images. But notice the backgrounds: 
In the left image, a section of a gutter downspout extends up from the boy’s 
shoulder, and there’s a strong break in the light in the upper-left corner. 
Both distract the eye from the subjects. The photo on the right, where these 
annoyances are no longer visible, was achieved by moving the camera farther 
from the subjects and then zooming in. Any time you zoom in, you include 
less of the background in the shot because of the change in angle of view. 
And the background also becomes noticeably softer because of the reduction 
in depth of field, too, lessening the visual impact of the brick.

270 mm
 
Figure 6-8: Zooming to a longer focal length also decreases depth 
 
of field.
It’s important to emphasize that the subjects were in the same place for 
both shots, and the aperture used for both was the same (f/5.6). The huge 
difference between the two images is solely due to a change of camera posi-
tion and focal length. If you wanted to further soften that background, you 
could open the aperture further (assuming that your camera offered a lower 
f-stop setting). Or you could zoom in without moving away from the subjects, 
although that choice would mean that you could no longer fit as much of 
their bodies in the shot.

151
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
Figure 6-9: A longer focal length also means less background area fits in the frame.
 
Putting it all together, then, decide how much depth of field best suits your 
subject and then combine aperture, focal length, and camera-to-subject 
distance to create the look you want. Remember the following formulas, 
and adapt as needed: 
 
✓ For minimum depth of field (subject sharp, distant objects blurry): Use 
a wide aperture (low f-stop number), a long focal length, and get as close 
as possible to your subject. Be sure not to exceed the minimum close-
focusing distance of your lens, though.
 
✓ For maximum depth of field (subject and distant objects sharp): Use a 
small aperture (high f-stop number), a short focal length, and move back 
from your subject as much as possible. 
Controlling Color
In the film photography world, expert photographers manipulate color by 
using different films and lens filters. If you want landscapes that feature bold 
blues and vivid greens, for example, you choose a film known to emphasize 
those hues. If you’re shooting portraits, on the other hand, you might add 

152
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
an amber-tinted filter onto your lens to infuse the scene with a warm, golden 
glow that flatters skin tones.
Things work differently in the digital world, but you still have lots of options 
for manipulating color — in fact, more so than in the film world, and without 
having to lug around a bagful of different films and filters, too. The rest of this 
chapter explains the standard digital-camera color features and also helps 
you solve some common color problems.
Be sure to also visit Chapter 4 for an 
introduction to some of the technical 
terminology and basic science related 
to digital color.
Adjusting color with 
white balance
Different light sources have varying 
color temperatures, which is a fancy way 
of saying that they contain different 
amounts of red, green, and blue light.
 
Color temperature is measured on 
the Kelvin scale, illustrated in Figure 
6-10. The midday sun has a color tem-
perature of about 5500 Kelvin, which 
is often abbreviated as 5500K — not 
to be confused with 5500 kilobytes, 
also abbreviated as 5500K. When two 
worlds as full of technical lingo as 
photography and computers collide, 
havoc ensues. If you’re ever unsure 
as to which K is being discussed, just 
nod your head thoughtfully and say, 
“Yes, I see your point.”
The human eye manages the percep-
tion of color temperature naturally, 
and no matter if you’re in an office 
with fluorescent light, under a bright 
sun, or in a living room with house 
lamps, when you see red, it looks red 
(assuming no difficulties with color 
blindness, of course). However, cam-
eras aren’t as sophisticated as your 
brain at accommodating various light-
ing conditions and the colors being 
illuminated by them.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Color temperature affects how a camera perceives the colors of the objects 
being photographed. If you’ve taken film pictures in fluorescent lighting, for 
example, you may have noticed a slight green tint to your photographs. The 
tint comes from the color temperature of fluorescent light (and, actually, fluo-
rescent light is one of the hardest lights in which to photograph using film, 
because the temperature fluctuates).
Film photographers use special films or lens filters designed to compensate 
for different light sources. But digital cameras, like video cameras, get around 
the color-temperature problem by using a process known as white balancing. 
 
White balancing simply tells the camera what combination of red, green, and 
blue light it should perceive as pure white, given the current lighting condi-
tions. With that information as a baseline, the camera can then accurately 
reproduce the other colors in the scene.
On many digital cameras, white balancing is handled automatically. But many 
models provide manual white-balance controls as well. Why would you want 
to make manual white-balance adjustments? Because sometimes, automatic 
white balancing doesn’t go quite far enough in removing unwanted color 
casts, especially when a scene is lit by multiple light sources that have dif-
ferent color temperatures. If you notice that your whites aren’t really white 
or that the image has an unnatural tint, you can usually correct the problem 
by shifting out of automatic mode and dialing in a manual white-balance set-
ting that’s tailored to a specific light source. Table 6-1 shows some common 
manual settings. These settings are usually represented by graphic icons; the 
ones in the table are generic, but most cameras use similar symbols to repre-
sent the white-balance settings.

Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Figure 6-11 gives you an idea of how image colors are affected by white-
balance settings. As with most cameras, the one used to take these pictures 
handles color pretty well in automatic white-balancing mode. But this shoot-
ing location threw the camera a curve ball because the subject was lit by 
three different light sources. The room had fluorescent lights, which lit the 
subject from above; to the subject’s left (the right side of the picture), bright 
daylight was shining through a large picture window. Adding flash made 
things even more complicated.
The image has a slightly yellowish cast at the Automatic setting. That’s 
because in the Automatic mode, most cameras balance colors for flash light-
ing when the flash is turned on (which is why the results of the Flash mode 
and the Automatic mode are the same in the figure). But balancing colors 
for the temperature of the flash only doesn’t account for the two other light 
sources hitting the subject. In this particular case, the Fluorescent setting 
achieved the most accurate color balance, with the Sunny option coming in a 
close second.
That’s the short story on white balance: Turn to this control any time your 
colors look out of whack. But also investigate the tactics explored in the next 
few sections, which present some additional white-balance features and uses.
 
Get in the habit of setting your white balance back to AWB (automatic white 
balance) after you’re done using a manual setting. Otherwise, if you shoot 
another photo in different light, the color is likely to appear wrong in that 
photo.
White-balance shift
Some cameras offer a way to refine white balance beyond what you can do 
with the six or seven usual manual settings. For example, suppose you’re 
using incandescent lamps but the Incandescent setting on your camera 
doesn’t quite produce neutral colors. You may be able to nudge the white-
balance adjustment in small increments to eliminate the problem. For exam-
ple, on some Canon cameras, you can tweak the white-balance adjustment 
by moving a little marker inside a color grid, shifting hues along both a blue/
amber axis and a green/magenta axis, as shown in Figure 6-12. The setting in 
the figure shifts the white balance three steps toward amber and one step 
toward magenta.
This feature sometimes goes by the name white-balance shift; on other 
models, it may go by the name white-balance correction or something similar. 
But regardless of the label, this feature offers very precise control over white 
balance.

Typically, the shift increments 
are geared to a measure called 
a mired (my-redd), which indi-
cates the degree of color cor-
rection applied by a traditional 
colored lens filter. Each white-
balance adjustment incre-
ment equals so many mireds 
(usually, five). If you’re hip to 
the whole mired issue, check 
the fine print in your camera 
manual for details on how your 
model handles things.
Custom white balancing 
based on a gray card
Some cameras allow you to 
shoot a reference photo that 
the camera analyzes to determine the right amount of white balancing needed 
to completely remove any color casts. This feature is usually the most reliable 
and efficient way to ensure accurate color.
Figure 6-12: On some Canon cameras, you use this 
type of control to adjust white balance in small 
increments.
Managing colors (and color expectations)
One concern often voiced by digital photogra-
phers is that the colors they see on their camera 
monitors often look very different when the pic-
ture is displayed on a computer monitor. An even 
bigger complaint is that printed colors don’t look 
the same as what’s displayed on the monitor.
The first step to solving the problem is to get 
your expectations in line, which means under-
standing the different color worlds involved in 
the process: the colors that your eyes see, the 
colors that your camera can capture, and the 
colors that can be reproduced in print.
Unfortunately, no camera is as capable as the 
human eye at capturing certain shades and 
intensities of reds, greens, blues, and yellows. 
And no printer can reproduce with ink all the 
colors that can be displayed by a camera or 
computer monitor, which create colors by pro-
jecting red, green, and blue light. In other words, 
you’re dealing with three different color spaces, 
or gamuts, which can be compared to three 
boxes of crayons that each hold a slightly dif-
ferent assortment of colors. When your camera 
doesn’t have the right crayon to record a color 
in a scene, it simply uses the closest available 
one — the same way you might draw with a 
midnight-blue crayon if you lost your navy-blue 
one. The printer does the same thing when out-
putting your photos.
To sum up, perfect color matching simply isn’t 
possible. You can, however, do a number of 
things to get the best possible color consistency. 
See Chapter 10 for a list of steps to take to get 
printed colors more in line with screen colors, 
and review the camera color-control topics dis-
cussed in this chapter to bend the colors your 
camera produces to better mirror the colors 
that you see in a scene. See Chapter 4 for a bit 
more detail about color spaces, including which 
one to use if your camera offers a choice.

157
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Here’s how it works: You take a picture of a neutral gray card, illuminating 
the card with the same lighting that you plan to use for your shot. (You can 
buy cards made just for this purpose at your local camera store for under 
$20.) The camera then determines what white-balance adjustment is needed 
to get that image to a neutral color state. The adjustment information is 
stored as a custom setting, and any time you shoot in that same light, you 
select that custom setting as your white-balance option, and the camera 
applies the same correction to ensure color accuracy.
White-balance bracketing
If you’re unsure about the light illuminating your subject, you may want to 
try white-balance bracketing. This high-falootin’ term simply means that you 
take a picture of the same thing several times with different white-balance 
settings.
Say that your family is sitting on the couch in your living room, and a mix of 
sunlight and a few lamps is shining on them. One of the lamps has a regular 
incandescent bulb, while another has one of those new, efficient, curly fluo-
rescent bulbs. Depending on who’s sitting in what light, your camera’s color 
brain is very likely to get quite confused about how to render the image.
Assuming that your camera offers manual white-balance control, as explained 
in the preceding section, try taking the shot using a variety of settings to see 
which one produces the best overall colors. Later, on your computer, you 
can look at the photos in more detail and decide which one you prefer.
 
Some cameras offer automatic white-balance bracketing that’s based on 
white-balance shifting (explained earlier in this chapter). With this feature, 
you first select a white balance setting — Sunny, Cloudy, whatever. Then you 
tell the camera to take one shot at that setting, take a second shot at a setting 
that slightly shifts colors in one direction, and a third that shifts colors in the 
other direction.
Using white balance for effect
Colors are often described as being either “cool” or “warm.” Cool colors fall 
into the blue/green range of the color spectrum; warm colors, the red-yellow-
orange spectrum. Light, too, is often said to be cool or warm: Candlelight, for 
example is a very warm light, whereas flash is a very cool light. 
 
Talking about colors as being cool and warm can get confusing if you’re also 
pondering the Kelvin scale. Colors that give off the bluish light have a higher 
Kelvin temperature than those that give off a warmer light, and most of us 
are used to thinking of a higher temperature as warmer. Don’t think too much 
about it — it’s more important that you are aware of the colors of different 
light sources than their Kelvin temperatures.

158
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
At any rate, back to the discussion at hand: Film photographers often apply 
tinted filters to the ends of their lenses to purposefully add a warm or cool 
cast to their subjects. With digital, however, you may be able to do the same 
thing simply by using your camera’s white-balance controls.
Assuming that your camera offers manual white-balance settings, you can 
simply experiment with different settings to see which ones provide the 
warming and cooling effects you want. The trick is to choose a white-balance 
setting that’s actually designed for a light source that has a different color 
temperature than your actual light source, as follows:
 
✓ For warmer colors: Choose a white-balance setting designed for the 
bluish light sources that fall at the top of the Kelvin scale, such as flash 
or clouds. The camera, thinking that the light is very blue, shifts colors 
to the warmer side of the scale. And if you’re shooting in light that’s 
actually not cool, the resulting colors wind up being shoved slightly past 
neutral to warm. 
 
✓ For cooler colors: Choose a white-balance setting designed for the 
warm-colored light sources at the bottom of the Kelvin scale, such 
as Incandescent. Again, the camera applies what it thinks is the right 
amount of cooling needed to make your whites white, but the adjust-
ment again takes your colors past neutral, this time to the cooler side of 
the color range.
As an example, take a look at Figure 6-13. The actual light in this scene was 
from strong, bright daylight coming in through the overhead windows. At 
the Daylight white-balance setting, the colors were neutral — or, to put it 
another way, rendered without a color cast from the light. Shooting the scene 
using the Cloudy setting produced the result you see in the right figure. The 
camera applied an overly strong warming effect, thinking that it needed to 
compensate for the bluish tint of cloudy skies. The change is most evident 
in the green ironwork at the top of the scene and in the walls, which appear 
almost tan in the original but golden in the Cloudy version.
 
Using flash in bright sunlight also produces this warming effect for the same 
reason. And conveniently enough, a flash also produces better outdoor illu-
mination for many subjects. With portraits, the flash helps eliminate shadows 
under the nose and eyes, for example. And if you flip on your flash, you can 
leave your white-balance setting to Auto, because the camera automatically 
color-corrects for flash any time to enable flash.
Of course, this trick only works to a certain degree. If the light is cloudy, 
for example, you can’t make colors warmer because the maximum warm-
ing happens when you select Cloudy as the white-balance setting. And if 
you’re shooting by incandescent lamps, you can’t go any cooler because the 
Incandescent setting already applies the greatest amount of cooling. So the 

159
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
degree of color change that occurs when you select a different white-balance 
setting depends on how far your actual light source is from that setting.
 
Balanced for actual light (daylight)
Balanced using Cloudy setting
 
Figure 6-13: You can trick your white-balance control into serving as a digital warming filter.
 
If your camera offers white-balance shift, however, you may be able to tell the 
camera that you always want to push colors slightly to the warm or cool side 
any time you select a certain white-balance setting. So if you find that your 
camera consistently produces colors that are too cool for your liking at the 
Cloudy setting, you can dial in a correction that slightly increases warming in 
cloudy light.
Shooting Raw for absolute color control
 
Does your camera enable you to capture images in the Camera Raw format? 
In this format, fully explained in Chapter 4, the camera actually applies no 
white balancing — or any other color adjustments — as it does when you 
shoot in the JPEG format. Instead, you specify the color attributes of your 
picture when you convert the Raw file to a standard format (such as TIFF) on 
your computer.

160
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
The color controls available during conversion depend on the raw-conversion 
software you use; Figure 6-14 highlights those available in the Adobe 
Photoshop Elements version. In this program, you can apply one of your 
camera’s preset white-balance settings (Cloudy, Sunny, and so on) or use 
color sliders to fine-tune those settings. You also can manipulate color 
saturation and vibrancy.
 
Color controls
 
Figure 6-14: You can set white balance for Raw files during the conversion process.
Although Raw capture involves more time behind the computer and has a 
few other complications you can explore in Chapter 4, it does provide an 
even finer degree of color control than you get from most cameras. More 
importantly, it provides a color safety net. If you shoot JPEG and get the 
white balance wrong, you can wind up with an ugly color cast that may be 
difficult to fully remove in a photo editor. But with Raw, the color isn’t locked 
in when the file is created, so you always get a second chance.

161
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
That’s not to say that you can totally ignore white balance when you shoot 
Raw, however. First, the picture you see during playback on the camera 
monitor is a JPEG preview of the image as it will appear if you stick with the 
current white-balance setting. So if the color is way off, judging the overall 
result of the picture is a little difficult. It’s hard to tell whether a red flower 
is properly exposed, for example, if the entire image has a blue color cast. 
And when you open your picture file in a Raw converter, the software initially 
translates the picture data according to the recorded white-balance setting. 
Getting as close as possible from the get-go can thus save you some time 
tweaking colors during the conversion stage.
Exploring even more color options
Especially if your camera is relatively new, you may have access to several 
color controls in addition to those already laid out in this chapter. Browse 
through your camera manual to look for features such as these:
 
✓ Automatic scene modes: Explained in Chapter 3, these exposure modes 
are geared to best capture specific types of scenes: landscapes, por-
traits, and so on. Primarily, these modes are meant to assist you with 
choosing the right exposure settings, but many also manipulate colors. 
Landscape mode may emphasize blues and greens, for example, while 
Portrait mode may slightly enhance skin colors.
 
✓ Color enhancement presets for advanced exposure modes: If you 
prefer to work in an advanced exposure mode, such as shutter-priority 
autoexposure or manual exposure, you still may be able to apply auto-
matic color adjustments to your images. Usually, you can choose from 
color presets, each of which renders colors a different way. One preset 
may be geared to richer colors, another may produce a more neutral 
color palette, and others may emphasize different parts of the color 
spectrum. On some Canon cameras, for example, you make this adjust-
ment through a feature called Picture Styles; on some Nikon cameras, 
the Optimize Image feature offers these options.
 
✓ Saturation adjustments: Many cameras, even entry-level models, enable 
you to boost color saturation, or the intensity of the colors. However, 
use discretion: By increasing color saturation too much, you can lose 
picture detail. A flower petal that should reflect a variety of reds, at dif-
ferent saturations, for example, can become one big, lifeless blob of fully 
saturated red.
 
✓ Color effects: Many cameras offer effects filters that can turn your full-
color photo into a grayscale or tinted monochrome image (blue and 
white, for example, or sepia-toned). Figure 6-15, for example, shows an 

162
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
original full-color image along with grayscale and sepia-toned versions 
produced this way. In some cases, you select the filter before you press 
the shutter button. Some cameras enable you to preview the effect; in 
other cases, you can’t see the results of the filter until picture playback. 
On other cameras, you apply the effect to an existing image on your 
memory card rather than before you shoot.
Figure 6-15: Many cameras can produce grayscale or sepia-toned images.
 
 These in-camera filters are fun and convenient, but if you want better 
control over your results, capture the image as usual and then apply 
the color effects in your photo editor. In many photo editors, you can 
choose which of your original colors to emphasize in your monochrome 
version, and you also can make the exposure and contrast adjustments 
that are often needed after making the move from color to monochrome. 
If you do use the in-camera filters, be sure that your camera preserves 
the full-color version of the image; you can always go from color to 
monochrome, but the opposite isn’t true.

lthough a good photo can happen unintentionally, the real trick is to be 
able to shoot good images consistently. Knowing how to use 
and manage your camera and understanding the art of compo-
sition can make a big difference in your “hit rate” of keeper 
shots. 
This chapter offers some suggestions that can help 
you take more memorable, captivating photographs. 
Whether you’re snapping pics of your children or 
shooting products for a sales brochure, experiment 
with these methods. As you’ll discover, a little plan-
ning and creativity is all you need to evolve from a 
so-so picture taker to a creative, knock-their-socks-
off photographer. 
Composing a Better Photo 
You don’t have to be an art major to understand that your camera 
angle and distance, as well as how you position elements of a scene, can 
make the difference between a well-composed image and one that falls flat. 
After you practice a few techniques and learn a couple of tricks, it will quickly 
become second nature to you to compose an image so that the person enjoy-
ing the photo is naturally drawn to the subject you intended to portray. 

164
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Consider the image in Figure 7-1. 
Exposure, focus, and the other tech-
nical aspects of the picture are fine. 
And the subject, a statue at the base 
of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument 
in Indianapolis, is interesting enough. 
But overall, the picture is . . . well, dull 
as dishwater. In fact, with all the new 
scented dishwashing liquids out there, 
dishwater might even be more intriguing.
Now look at Figure 7-2, which shows 
two additional images of the same sub-
ject, but with more powerful results. 
What makes the difference? In a word, 
composition. Simply framing the statue 
differently, zooming in for a closer view, 
and changing the camera angle create 
more captivating images.
 
 Figure 7-2: Getting closer to the subject and shooting from less-obvious angles results in 
more interesting pictures.
Figure 7-1: This image falls flat because of 
its uninspired framing and angle of view.

165
 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
Not everyone agrees on the “best” ways 
to compose an image — art being in 
the eye of the beholder and all that. 
For every composition rule, you can 
find an incredible image that proves 
the exception. That said, the following 
list offers some suggestions that can 
help you create images that rise above 
the ho-hum mark on the visual-interest 
meter:
 
✓ Remember the “rule of thirds.” 
For maximum impact, don’t place 
your subject smack in the center 
of the frame, as shown in Figure 
7-1, although that may seem like 
the natural thing to do. Instead, 
mentally divide the image area 
into thirds like a tic-tac-toe game, 
as illustrated in Figure 7-3. Then 
position the main subject elements 
at spots where the dividing lines 
intersect. In the sample image, the 
point of interest, the deer’s eye 
and nose, fall at that placement.
 
✓ Shoot from unexpected angles. 
Again, refer to Figure 7-1. This 
image accurately represents the 
statue. But the picture is hardly 
as captivating as the images 
in Figure 7-2, which show the 
same subject from more unusual 
angles.
 
✓ Draw the eye across the frame. 
To add life to your images, 
compose the scene so that the 
viewer’s eye is naturally led from 
one edge of the frame to the 
other, as in Figure 7-4. Leaving 
a little margin of background in 
the direction the subject is look-
ing also helps. The figure in the 
image, also part of the Soldiers 
and Sailors Monument, appears 
ready to fly off into the big, blue 
yonder. You can almost feel the 
breeze blowing the torch’s flame 
and the figure’s cape.
Figure 7-3: One rule of composition is to divide 
the frame into thirds and position the main 
subject at one of the intersection points.
Figure 7-4: To add life to your pictures, frame 
the scene so that the eye is naturally drawn 
from one edge of the image to the other.

166
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
✓ Get close to your subject. Often, the most interesting shot is the one 
that reveals the small details, such as the laugh lines in a grandfather’s 
face or the raindrop on the rose petal. Remember, you can also get close 
to a subject by zooming-in on them; you don’t have to always get physi-
cally close. 
 
✓ Pay attention to the background. 
Before taking a picture, do a quick scan 
of the background, looking for distract-
ing background elements such as the 
flower and computer monitor in 
Figure 7-5.
 
 Here’s a trick for capturing children 
against a non-invasive backdrop: 
Photograph them while they’re lying 
down on the floor and looking up at 
the camera, as in Figure 7-6. Rooms full 
of children also tend to be full of toys, 
sippy cups, and other kid paraphernalia, 
which can make getting an uncluttered 
shot difficult. So simply shove every-
thing off to a small area of carpet and 
have the kids get down on the floor 
and pose.
 
 Another trick for shooting kids and pets 
is to get down to their level; lie down on 
the floor or sit with them. Not only will you get 
some interesting angles and perspectives, you’ll 
make them feel more comfortable, and the shots 
will appear more natural.
 
✓ Try to capture the subject’s personality. The 
most boring people shots are those in which 
the subjects pose in front of the camera and 
say “cheese” on the photographer’s cue. If you 
really want to reveal something about your sub-
jects, catch them in the act of enjoying a favorite 
hobby or using the tools of their trade. This 
tactic is especially helpful with subjects who are 
camera-shy; focusing their attention on a familiar 
activity helps put them at ease and replace that 
stiff, I’d-rather-be-anywhere-but-here look with a 
more natural expression.

background objects.

clutter, have kids lie on an

 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
Capturing Captivating Portraits
The classic portraiture approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while 
throwing the background into soft focus, as shown in Figure 7-7. In other 
words, the picture features a shallow depth of field, or zone of sharp focus, 
as shown in the examples in this section. This artistic choice emphasizes the 
subject and helps diminish the impact of any distracting background objects 
in cases where you can’t control the setting.
Chapter 6 explains depth-of-field 
techniques fully, but here’s a quick 
recap on how to achieve that blurry-
background look:
 
✓ Set your camera to Portrait 
or aperture-priority exposure 
mode. One way to shorten 
depth of field is to use a low 
f-stop setting, which opens 
the aperture. Portrait mode, 
found on many cameras, auto-
matically opens the aperture as 
much as possible. This scene 
mode also usually applies some 
color and sharpness adjust-
ments that are well suited to 
rendering skin tones. 
 
 However, if you want to pre-
cisely control depth of field, 
switch to aperture-priority 
autoexposure mode, if avail-
able. In this mode, you choose 
the f-stop setting, and the 
camera selects a shutter speed 
to properly expose the photo. 
(This mode is usually abbrevi-
ated as A or Av on the camera dial; Chapter 5 has details.)
 
✓ Zoom in, get closer, or both. Zooming to a longer focal length also 
reduces depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.
 
 Avoid using a lens with a short focal length (a wide-angle lens) for por-
traits. They can cause features to appear distorted — sort of like the 
way people look when you view them through a security peephole in a 
door. Instead, use a “normal” lens in the range of 40mm–70mm.

blurry background. 

168
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
✓ Move your subject farther from the background. The greater the dis-
tance between the two, the more background blurring you can achieve. 
Increasing the distance also helps eliminate shadows that may occur 
behind the subject if you use flash to light indoor portraits.
After you ensure that soft background, these other tips can also improve 
your people pics:
 
✓ For indoor portraits, shoot flash-free if possible. Shooting by avail-
able light rather than flash produces softer illumination and avoids the 
problem of red-eye. To get enough light to go flash-free, turn on room 
lights or, during daylight, pose your subject next to a sunny window. 
Do remember that the camera may need a fairly slow shutter speed to 
expose the image in low light, however, so you may want to use a tripod 
and ask your subject to remain as still as possible. Or, you can try rais-
ing the ISO setting to increase the camera’s light sensitivity, although 
that can also produce noise (the defect that gives your image a speckled 
look).
Portraits by flash light: Getting better results
If using a flash for your indoor and nighttime 
portraits is necessary, these techniques can 
produce better results:
 ✓ Turn on as many room lights as possible to 
reduce the flash power needed to expose the 
picture. This step also causes the pupils to 
constrict, reducing the chances of red-eye.
 ✓ Try using Red-Eye Reduction flash mode. 
Warn your subject to expect a preflash or 
other beam of preliminary light, which con-
stricts pupils, and the actual flash.
 ✓ Try Night Portrait exposure mode. In this 
mode, the camera automatically selects 
a slower shutter speed than normal. This 
enables the camera to soak up more ambi-
ent light, producing a brighter background 
and reducing the flash power that’s needed 
to light the subject. A slow shutter, however, 
means that you may need to use a tripod to 
avoid camera shake, which can blur the 
photo. You also need to warn your subjects 
to remain very still during the exposure.
 ✓ Soften the flash light by attaching a diffuser 
to the flash head. The more diffused the 
flash, the more flattering the light.
 ✓ If you have an external flash, rotate the 
head to bounce the light off the ceiling. 
Again, this diffuses the light so that it falls 
back softly on the subject.
 ✓  To reduce shadowing from the flash, move 
your subject farther from the background. 
 ✓ Shoot with your camera in a horizontal 
position. When a camera is held vertically 
with the flash on, it’s very common to get a 
strong, unattractive shadow along one side 
of your subject. 

169
 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
 
 In Portrait mode, the camera may not 
even allow you to shoot without flash 
in dim lighting. If your camera offers a 
No Flash scene mode (it may be called 
Museum mode or something similar), 
you can try that instead, although the 
camera may not choose an aperture 
setting that throws the background 
into soft focus in that mode. 
 
✓ But experiment with using flash in 
outdoor portraits. This technique is 
called adding fill flash. The little pop 
of light eliminates shadows that can 
occur on the face in strong overhead 
lighting. (You can see an example in 
the flash discussion in Chapter 5.) But 
even in the shade, a flash offers better 
illumination for outdoor portraits. If 
your camera lets you control the power 
of your flash, you may want to use a 
lower-power setting for fill flash so that 
you don’t overdo it. 
 
 Most cameras don’t let you use flash in 
Portrait mode if the light is very bright, 
unfortunately. You may be able to move your subject into a shady 
enough area that the camera thinks flash is needed, however.
 
✓ Frame your subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety 
of frame sizes. Leaving a little “head room,” as shown in Figure 7-8, is 
a good idea because it gives you added flexibility when you print the 
photo. If you camera creates images with a proportion of 3:2, the entire 
photo will fit a 4 x 6-inch print. But if your originals are 4:3, which is the 
case on many cameras, some of the photo must be cropped to fit that 
4 x 6 print. And either way, you need to crop the photo to fit other tra-
ditional print sizes (8 x 10, 5 x 7, and so on). So if you don’t leave that 
margin of empty space, you may find yourself cropping off the top of 
your subjects’ heads.
 
✓ Check image colors if your subject is lit by both flash and ambi-
ent light. If you set the camera’s white-balance setting to automatic, 
enabling the flash tells the camera to warm colors to compensate for the 
cool light of a flash. If your subject is also lit by room lights or daylight, 
the result may be colors that are slightly warmer than neutral. This 
warming effect typically looks nice in portraits, giving the skin a subtle 
glow. But if you aren’t happy with the result or want even more warm-
ing, you may need to try a different white-balance setting or adjust the 
image color in your image-editing application. See Chapter 6 for help.

Shooting Better Action Shots
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving 
subject, whether it’s a butterfly flitting from flower to flower, a car passing 
by, or a running baseball player. Even something moving slowly, such as the 
135-meter-high London Eye observation wheel (see Figure 7-9), benefits from 
a faster shutter speed to capture a non-blurry image. This photo was taken at 
1/320 second. 
What shutter speed you need 
depends on the speed at which 
your subject is moving. But gener-
ally speaking, 1/500 second should 
be plenty for all but the fastest 
subjects — speeding race cars, 
boats, and so on. For slower sub-
jects, you can even go as low as 
1/250 or 1/125 second.
Whatever the speed of your sub-
ject, try setting your camera to 
one of the following exposure 
modes to capture action:
 
✓ Shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure: Usually abbreviated S 
or Tv (for time value), this 
mode enables you to specify 
an exact shutter speed. The 
camera then chooses the 
f-stop needed to expose the 
image properly. Of course, 
you can always switch to 
Manual exposure and set 
both shutter speed and aper-
ture yourself.
 
 Many cameras will tell you if you have set a speed that is too fast to get 
a good exposure. For example, in some cameras if the aperture value 
blinks after you set the shutter speed, the camera can’t select an f-stop 
that will properly expose the photo at that shutter speed. Other cameras 
may prevent you from choosing a shutter speed that puts you into the 
exposure danger zone.
 
✓ Sports mode: Almost all cameras offer a Sports mode these days, 
although it may go by some other name (Action, for example). Whatever 
the name, this mode automatically dials in a fast shutter speed for you. 
In some cases, other camera settings such as ISO (light sensitivity) may 
also be selected for you. 
Serge Timacheff
Figure 7-9: To produce crisp shots of things in 
motion — even when they’re moving slowly — 
use a fast shutter speed. 

171
 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
Here are a few other tips that pros use when capturing action:
 
✓ Raise the ISO setting to enable a faster shutter if needed. In dim light-
ing, you may not be able to get a good exposure at your chosen shutter 
speed or in Sports mode without taking this step. Raising the ISO does 
increase the possibility of noise, but a noisy shot is often better than a 
blurry one. (Note that some cameras automatically raise the ISO for you 
in dim lighting as well as when you put the camera into Sports mode.)
 
✓ Forget about flash. Using flash isn’t usually a workable solution for 
action shots. First, the flash needs time to recycle between shots, so it 
slows your shot-to-shot time. Second, most built-in flashes have limited 
ranges — so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. And 
third, the maximum shutter speed decreases when you enable flash; the 
top speed is usually 1/200 or 1/250 second. That may not be fast enough 
to capture your subject without blur.
 
 If you do decide to use flash, you may have to bail out of Sports mode, 
though; it probably doesn’t permit you to use a flash.
 
✓ Set the camera to burst mode, if available. This mode may be called 
Continuous or something similar; often, the option is set through an 
option called Drive mode, Release mode, or Shooting mode. Whatever 
the name, it enables you to record a continuous series of images with a 
single press of the shutter button. As long as you keep the button down, 
the camera captures image after image at a rapid pace — two to four 
frames per second is common, but some high-end cameras can be faster. 
 
✓ For fastest shooting with a dSLR, switch to manual focusing. You then 
eliminate the time the camera needs to lock focus in autofocus mode. 
Again, some cameras are faster than others, so you’ll probably need to 
try it both ways.
 
 Note that with most point-and-shoots that offer manual focusing, you 
have to specify the exact camera-to-subject distance by using a menu 
control or some similar process that can actually slow you down. So 
unless you can preset the focus distance, stick with autofocus (in this 
case, anyway).
 
✓ In autofocus mode, try continuous-servo mode, if available. Again, the 
name of the mode varies from camera to camera — on Canon models, 
it’s often called AI Servo, for example. When this feature is enabled, the 
camera initially sets focus when you depress the shutter button halfway 
but continues to adjust focus as necessary up to the time to take the 
picture, just in case the subject moves. All you need to do is reframe the 
shot as needed to keep the subject within the area the camera’s using to 
calculate focus.
 
✓ If continuous-servo autofocus isn’t available, lock in autofocus in 
advance. Press the shutter button halfway to do so. Now when the 
action occurs, just press the shutter button the rest of the way. Your 
image-capture time is faster because the camera has already done the 
work of establishing focus.

172
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
✓ If possible, turn off automatic image review. Most cameras display 
each picture for a few seconds on the camera monitor immediately after 
you capture the shot. In many cases, you can’t take another picture until 
this “instant review” period is over. If your camera enables you to turn 
off the feature, doing so is a good idea for action shooting. (Some cam-
eras limit image review automatically in Sports mode.) 
 
✓ Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame. To make 
sure that your subject doesn’t move out of the frame before you press 
the shutter button, compose the image with some extra room at the 
edges. You can always crop the photo later to a tighter composition. 
 
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any fast-
moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shooting 
candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, leaping, 
or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or change posi-
tions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your eye, set your 
camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots as fast as you can.
Also, remember that some moving subjects will actually look better if you 
keep a little blurriness to convey motion. That’s what we call “artistic judg-
ment” (even if you never intended the picture to turn out that way — don’t 
worry, we won’t tell). While the photo in Figure 7-10 is certainly no award-
winning image, a lot of kids (especially) find it to be a fun image — and it 
just wouldn’t be the same without the blurriness.

 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
Taking in the Scenery
Providing specific camera settings for scenic photography is tricky because 
there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch of country-
side, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, for example: 
One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all buildings in the 
scene sharply focused. But another photographer might prefer to shoot the 
same scene so that a foreground building is sharply focused while the others 
are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first building.
That said, the following tips can help you photograph a landscape the way 
you see it:
 
✓ Shoot in aperture-priority 
autoexposure mode, if 
available, so that you can 
control depth of field. 
Again, this mode enables 
you to adjust the aper-
ture, which is one factor in 
determining depth of field. 
(Chapter 6 explains depth 
of field fully). The camera 
then handles the rest of the 
exposure equation for you 
by dialing in the right shut-
ter speed.
 
 For a long depth of field, dial 
in a high f-stop number; for 
a shallow depth of field, a 
low number. The portrait 
examples earlier in this 
chapter feature a shallow 
depth of field; contrast 
those images with the one 
in Figure 7-11, taken at f/22. 
Notice that the fence in the 
foreground and the church 
in the distance are both in 
sharp focus.
 
✓ Try Landscape mode if 
aperture-priority autoexposure isn’t available. This scene mode auto-
matically selects a high f-stop number to produce a large depth of field, 
so that both near and distant objects are sharply focused. Of course, if 
the light is dim, the camera may be forced to open the aperture, reduc-
ing depth of field, to properly expose the image.
Serge Timacheff
Figure 7-11: An f-stop of f/22 kept both foreground 
and background in sharp focus.

174
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
 
 If you prefer your landscape to have a shallow depth of field, try Portrait 
mode instead. That mode automatically selects a lower f-stop setting.
 
✓ If the exposure requires a slow shutter, use a tripod to avoid blurring. 
The downside to a high f-stop is that you need a slower shutter speed 
to produce a good exposure. If the shutter speed drops below what 
you can comfortably hand-hold, use a tripod to avoid picture-blurring 
camera shake. No tripod handy? Look for any solid surface on which 
you can steady the camera (or nestle it into a camera bag or jacket). You 
can always increase the ISO setting to increase light sensitivity, which in 
turn allows a faster shutter speed, too, but that option brings with it the 
chances of increased image noise.
 
✓ For dramatic waterfall and 
fountain shots, consider using 
a slow shutter to create that 
“misty” look. The slow shutter 
blurs the water, giving it a soft, 
romantic appearance. Figure 
7-12 shows you a close-up of 
this effect. Again, use a tripod to 
ensure that the rest of the scene 
doesn’t also blur due to camera 
shake.
 
✓ At sunrise or sunset, base expo-
sure on the sky. The foreground 
will be dark, but you can usually 
brighten it in a photo editor if 
needed. If you base exposure 
on the foreground, on the other 
hand, the sky will become so 
bright that all the color will be 
washed out — a problem you 
usually can’t fix after the fact.
 
 This tip doesn’t apply, of course, 
if your sunrise or sunset is 
merely serving as a gorgeous 
backdrop for a portrait. In that 
case, you should enable your 
flash and expose for the subject. 
 
✓ For cool nighttime pics, experiment with a slow shutter. Assuming that 
cars or other vehicles are moving through the scene, the result is neon 
trails of light. Sometimes, if it’s really dark, you may have to bump-up 
your ISO to a point that it produces a lot of digital noise — but other-
wise you might not get the shot, even with a very slow shutter speed.

 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
The photo of the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) in Figure 7-13 was 
taken in Lapland, Finland about 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle in 
the middle of winter; it took a shutter speed of 30 seconds at ISO 800 to 
capture this image (and using a tripod, of course).
 
 
Serge Timacheff
 
Figure 7-13: Photographing at night may require using a high ISO 
 
setting.
  
 Some cameras will require that you 
run in a bulb mode in order to take 
very long exposures, such as the one 
in Figure 7-11. Typically available only 
in Manual exposure mode, the bulb 
setting records an image for as long 
as you hold down the shutter button.
 
✓ For the best lighting, shoot during 
the “magic” or “golden” hours. 
That’s the term photographers use 
for early morning and late afternoon, 
when the light cast by the sun is soft 
and warm, at a strong angle, giving 
everything that beautiful, gently 
warmed look with nice indirect light, 
such as you see in Figure 7-14, which 
shows a picture of St. Tropez taken 
late in the day.
 
✓ In tricky light, bracket shots. 
Bracketing simply means to take 
the same picture at several differ-
ent exposures to increase the odds 
Alex A. Timacheff
Figure 7-14: The time of day when you 
shoot can create some very dramatic 
effects. 

176
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
that at least one of them will capture the scene the way you envision. 
Bracketing is especially a good idea in difficult lighting situations such 
as sunrise and sunset.
Getting Gorgeous Close-ups
Close-up, or macro shots can be wonderfully artistic, but they can also be 
challenging to take. To take good macro shots, try the following settings and 
techniques:
 
✓ Check your owner’s manual to find out the minimum close-focusing 
distance of your camera and/or lens. How “up close and personal” 
you can get to your subject depends on your lens, not the camera body 
itself. Many cameras and lenses also have a Macro mode, identified 
by a little flower icon; you may have to turn this on somewhere on the 
camera either as a button, a preset mode, or perhaps on the LCD menu, 
to achieve the closest focusing distance. 
 
✓ Take control over depth of field by setting the camera mode to aper-
ture-priority autoexposure. Whether you want a shallow, medium, or 
deep depth of field depends on the point of your photo, although many 
macro shots look best with a shallow depth of field. 
 
 Capturing the image shown in Figure 7-15 at a low aperture setting of 
f/2.8, for example, created a very shallow depth of field that draws the 
viewer’s attention to the ice crystals forming on the subject’s eyelashes.
 
✓ If aperture-priority autoexposure 
isn’t available, try the Macro scene 
mode. In this mode, sometimes also 
called Close-up mode, the camera 
automatically opens the aperture 
to achieve a short depth of field. 
Usually, the camera also bases 
focus on the center of the frame.
 
 Do note that Macro mode means 
and does different things depend-
ing on the camera. In some cases, 
it simply adjusts the close-focus-
ing distance; in others, it affects 
aperture as well as some color and 
contrast characteristics of the image. 
So check your manual for details.
 
✓ When shooting flowers and other 
nature scenes outdoors, pay 
attention to shutter speed, too. 
Even a slight breeze may cause your subject to move, causing blurring 
at slow shutter speeds.
Serge Timacheff

emphasize the part of the scene that you 
found most interesting.

177
 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
 
✓ Try using fill flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, 
a tiny bit of flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your 
primary light source. You may need to reduce the flash output slightly, 
however, because when you fire a flash very close to a subject, it may be 
overpowering. If you can control your flash directly, turn it down; if not, 
you may need to cover it with something to diffuse its light (even taping 
a napkin over the flash may be sufficient). 
 
✓ When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light 
source. Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your 
flash may be too bright and harsh even if you’re able to tone it down. 
If flash is inevitable, turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce 
the flash power that’s needed — even a hardware-store shop light can 
do in a pinch as a lighting source. (Remember that if you have multiple 
light sources, though, you may need to tweak the white-balance setting, 
or adjust your color settings in your image-editing program.)
Broadening Your Horizons: Shooting Panoramas 
You’re standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon, awestruck by the colors, 
light, and majestic rock formations. “If only I could capture all this in a photo-
graph!” you think. But when you view the scene through your camera’s view-
finder or LCD screen, you quickly realize that you can’t possibly do justice to 
such a magnificent landscape with one ordinary picture. 
Wait — don’t put down that camera and head for the souvenir shack just yet. 
When you’re shooting digitally, you don’t have to try to squeeze the entire 
canyon — or whatever other subject inspires you — into one frame. You 
can shoot several frames, each featuring a different part of the scene, and 
then stitch them together just as you would sew together pieces of a patch-
work quilt.
You can create a panoramic shot that’s horizontal or vertical. In Figure 7-16, 
for example, you see two horizontal images, each showing a different part 
of a historic farmhouse. Figure 7-17 shows the stitched panorama. And 
Figure 7-18 shows a vertical panorama, creating by joining two vertically 
oriented shows: one of the parasailor in the sky and the other of the water 
and land below.
Although you could conceivably combine photos into a panorama using your 
photo-editor’s regular cut-and-paste editing tools, a dedicated stitching tool 
makes the job easier. You simply pull up the images you want to join, and the 
program assists you in stitching the digital “seam.”

178
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
Figure 7-16: These two images served as the “material” stitched together to form the panorama shown 
in Figure 7-17.
Figure 7-17: The resulting panorama provides a larger perspective on the farmhouse scene.
Some camera manufacturers provide proprietary stitching tools as part of the 
camera’s software bundle. In addition, many photo-editing programs, such as 
Photoshop Elements, offer a stitching tool. You also can buy stand-alone stitch-
ing programs such as ArcSoft Panorama Maker ($40, www.arcsoft.com).
 
The stitching process is easy if you shoot the original images correctly. If you 
don’t, you wind up with something that looks more like a crazy quilt than a 
seamless photographic panorama. Here’s what you need to know:

179
 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
 
✓ Capture each picture using the same 
camera-to-subject distance. If you’re 
shooting a wide building, don’t get 
closer to the building at one end than 
you do at another, for example. 
 
✓ Overlap each shot by at least 30 
percent. Say that you’re shooting a 
line of ten cars. If image one includes 
the first three cars in the line, image 
two should include the third car 
as well as cars four and five. Some 
cameras provide a panorama mode 
that displays a portion of the previ-
ous shot in the monitor so that you 
can see where to align the next shot 
in the series. If your camera doesn’t 
offer this feature, you need to make 
a mental note of where each picture 
ends so that you know where the 
next picture should begin.
 
✓ Maintain the right axis of rotation. 
As you pan the camera to capture 
the different shots in the panorama, 
imagine that the camera is perched 
atop a short flagpole, with the cam-
era’s lens aligned with the pole. Be 
sure to use that same alignment as 
you take each shot. If you don’t, you 
can’t successfully join the images 
later.
 
✓ For horizontal panorama, keep the 
camera level. For best results, use a 
tripod. Some tripods include little bubble levels that help you keep the 
camera on an even keel. If you don’t have this kind of tripod, you may 
want to buy a little stick-on bubble level at the hardware store and put it 
on top of your camera.
 
✓ Use a consistent focusing approach. If you lock the focus on the fore-
ground in one shot, don’t focus on the background in the next shot.
 
✓ If possible, stick with manual focusing and exposure. This approach 
guarantees that the focus and exposure remain consistent across all 
your shots.
 
✓ If autoexposure is necessary, find out whether your camera offers an 
autoexposure lock function. This feature retains a consistent exposure 
throughout the series of panorama shots, which is important for seam-
less image stitching.

joined to create a vertical panorama. 

180
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
 
 If your camera doesn’t provide a way to override autoexposure, you 
may need to fool the camera into using a consistent exposure. Say that 
one-half of a scene is in the shadows and the other is in the sunlight. 
With autoexposure enabled, the camera increases the exposure for the 
shadowed area and decreases the exposure for the sunny area. That 
sounds like a good thing, but what it really does is create a noticeable 
color shift between the two halves of the picture. To prevent this prob-
lem, lock in the focus and exposure on the same point for each shot, and 
then reframe as you capture each segment of the scene. Choose a point 
of medium brightness for best results. (Whether this technique will 
work depends on your camera because some cameras continually adjust 
exposure up to the time you capture the image.)
 
✓ Avoid including moving objects in the shot. If possible, wait for bypass-
ers to get out of the frame before you take each picture. If someone is 
walking across the landscape as you shoot, you may wind up with the 
same strolling figure appearing at several spots in the stitched pan-
orama. Ditto for cars, bicycles, and other moving objects. 
If you really enjoy creating panorama images or need to do so regularly for 
business purposes, you can make your life a little easier by investing in a spe-
cial panoramic tripod head, which helps you make sure that each shot is per-
fectly set up to create a seamless panorama. Manufacturers of these specialty 
tripods include Manfrotto (www.manfrotto.com) and Kaidan (www.kaidan.
com). Expect to pay several hundred dollars for these specialty devices.
Exploring High-Dynamic-Range Imaging
Those are some big words, but what they mean is really quite simple. Imagine 
you’re taking a photo of a beautiful sky and countryside below it. Usually it’s 
one or the other — the sky or the landscape — that turns out well, but not 
both. Either the sky is washed-out and overexposed, or the landscape is too 
dark, when what you really want is to get the best of both. Achieving that 
feat is what photographers call HDR, which is short for high-dynamic-range 
imaging (try out that term at your next social event and see where it gets you). 
 
Dynamic range refers to the range of brightness values in an image, from 
shadows to highlights. So a high-dynamic-range image contains more bright-
ness values than a camera can normally capture in one shot.
To capture your sky/landscape scene with HDR, you shoot multiple photos 
of the scene, all at different exposure settings, making sure that some shots 
render the sky as you want it and some capture the landscape well. Aside 
from exposure, everything else about your shots remains the same — fram-
ing, focus, and so on.

181
 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
The next part of the magic happens in a photo editor that offers a feature 
that enables you to automatically merge the images in a way that retains the 
proper exposure for each part of the scene. In Adobe Photoshop, for exam-
ple, the feature is called Merge to HDR. You also can buy dedicated software 
applications such as Photomatix from HDRSoft ($100, www.hdrsoft.com) 
made specifically to do the same task. 
For a great example of HDR work, take a look at the images in Figures 7-19 
and 7-20, both from photographer Dan Burkholder. In the first image, you 
see the scene captured at a single exposure. The second image offers the 
HDR version, created by combining the shot from Figure 7-19 with seven 
additional exposures. If you want to learn more about Dan’s techniques, see 
images from an amazing book of HDR photographs featuring post-Katrina 
New Orleans, or (better yet) to attend one of his workshops, visit www.
danburkholder.com.

Figure 7-19: Here you see one of the images that photographer Dan Burkholder used to create 
 
the HDR image in Figure 7-20.
 
While this approach can ultimately yield an image much closer to what your 
eye might see, it is an involved process that is not a procedure for the com-
puter or software novice. The resulting image file is a 32-bit image that often 
cannot be viewed or used with some less-advanced image-editing applications.

Coping with Special Situations
A few subjects and shooting situations pose additional challenges not already 
covered in earlier sections. Here’s a quick list of ideas for tackling a variety of 
common “tough-shot” photos:
 
✓ Shooting through glass: To capture subjects that are behind glass, try 
putting your lens flat against the glass. Then switch to manual focus-
ing if possible; the glass barrier can give the autofocus mechanism fits. 
Disable your flash to avoid creating any unwanted reflections, too. 
 
 Some newer point-and-shoot cameras have a special “museum” or 
“aquarium” preset scene modes optimized for shooting through glass. 
 
✓ Shooting out a car window: Set the camera to shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure or manual mode and dial in a fast shutter speed to compensate for 
the movement of the car; or, if your camera doesn’t offer those modes, 
try Sports mode. Even so, however, you still may get a significant 
amount of blur, especially at night. But sometimes, as in Figure 7-21, 
that blur can create an interesting effect. 

183
 Chapter 7: Getting the Shot: How the Pros Do It
 
 
Serge Timacheff
 
Figure 7-21: Sometimes, a distorted, sbstract image can be interesting.. 
 
✓ Shooting in strong backlighting: When the light behind your subject is 
very strong and lighting the subject with flash isn’t an option, you have 
a couple of choices: You can either expose the image with the subject 
in mind, in which case the background will be overexposed, or you can 
expose for the background, leaving the subject too dark. By taking the 
latter route and purposely underexposing the subject, you can create 
some nice silhouette effects. (In computerland, this is what we call “turn-
ing a bug into a feature.”) Otherwise, if you turn on your flash so that it 
is forced to fire even with the bright backlighting, it will help illuminate 
your subject. Some point-and-shoot cameras also have a preset “back-
lighting” scene mode that will, in many cases, do all the work for you. 
 
✓ Shooting fireworks: First off, use a tripod; fireworks require a long expo-
sure, and trying to handhold your camera simply isn’t going to work. If 
your camera has a zoom lens, zoom out to the shortest focal length. For 
dSLR and point-and-shoot cameras capable of manual operation, switch 
to manual focusing and set focus at infinity (the farthest focus point 
possible on your lens).
 
 If available, use the Manual exposure setting. Choose a relatively high 
f-stop setting — say, f/16 or so — and start a shutter speed of 1 to 3 

184
Part II: Getting the Most from Your Camera 
seconds. From there, it’s simply a matter of experimenting with dif ferent 
shutter speeds.
  
 No Manual exposure mode? Try shutter-priority autoexposure mode 
instead. Some point-and-shoot cameras now have a Fireworks scene 
mode, too, in which case you can let the camera take the reins. Be 
especially gentle when you press the shutter button — with a very slow 
shutter; you can easily create enough camera movement to blur the 
image. 
 
 If your camera offers a noise-reduction feature, you may want to enable 
it, too, because a long exposure also increases the chances of noise 
defects. (Keep the ISO setting low to further dampen noise.)
 
✓ Shooting reflective surfaces: If you have a dSLR or a point-and-shoot 
camera that accepts accessory lens filters, you can reduce daytime 
glare from reflective surfaces such as glass, water, and metal by using 
a circular polarizing filter, which ranges in price from about $30 to $200, 
depending on size and brand. A polarizing filter can also help out when 
you’re shooting through glass.
 
 But know that in order for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and 
your camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at 
a 90-degree angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must 
also reflect off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In addition, a 
polarizing filter also intensifies blue skies and water in some scenarios, 
which may or may not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing 
filter isn’t a surefire cure-all.
 
 A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest in 
a light cube or light tent. You place the reflective object inside the tent 
or cube and then position your lights around the outside. The cube or 
tent acts as a light diffuser, reducing reflections. For more on this type 
of product, see Chapter 5.

Downloading Your Images
You have a camera full of pictures. Now what? You transfer them to your 
computer, that’s what. This step can be one of the scariest tasks for a lot 
of people, which is why more than a few novice photographers use their 
cameras for months before even considering transferring their images. Not 
to worry! The next few sections show you exactly how to get your images 
moved from camera to computer, safe and sound. 
A look at your downloading options
Digital camera manufacturers have developed several ways for users to 
transfer pictures from camera to computer. Here’s a brief overview of your 
choices:
 
✓ Use a card reader: A card reader is simply a little gadget that enables 
you to transfer files to a computer without using the camera itself. Many 
computers, printers, and monitors now have built-in card readers; if 
yours doesn’t, you can buy an external one that plugs into your com-
puter’s USB port. Either way, you just pop the card out of the camera 
and into the card reader, and you can then transfer files just as you 
would when moving them from a CD, DVD, or old-fashioned floppy disk. 
(Remember those?) See the upcoming section “Downloading from a card 
reader” for more details on this transfer method.
  
 USB stands for Universal Serial Bus, which is a technology developed for 
connecting printers, cameras, and other devices to a computer. A USB 
port is simply a slot on the computer where you can plug in a USB cable. 
Figure 8-1 offers a close-up look at a USB plug and ports. 
 
✓ Connect the camera to the computer: You can also connect your 
computer directly to your camera using the cable that came in your 
camera box. Normally, it connects via USB. When attached, your camera 
appears on your computer as just another storage device, and you can 
then transfer images from the camera’s memory card.
 
 Although this method isn’t all that much more complicated than using a 
card reader, it does require you to keep your camera turned on during 
the transfer, which eats up your batteries. And you have to keep track 
of your camera’s connection cable, which is a bother you don’t have to 
take if you use a built-in card reader (or keep the card reader perma-
nently connected to the computer). Read through the upcoming section 
“Downloading from the camera” to get a better idea of the process.

✓ Use a camera dock: A camera 
dock, or docking station, is 
a small base unit that you 
leave permanently connected 
to your computer. To down-
load pictures, you place the 
camera into the dock. From 
there, the process is the same 
as downloading from a card 
reader or camera (although 
some docks give you a button 
or menu that you use to initi-
ate the transfer). Most docks 
also serve as the camera’s 
battery charger, and some 
offer features that simplify 
e-mailing and printing pic-
tures. You can even buy 
docks that have a built-in 
snapshot printer; the Kodak 
model shown in Figure 8-2 is 
an example.

snapshot printers.

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 A few cameras ship with a docking station; sold alone, docks usually 
run in the $50 to $200 range, depending on whether they incorporate a 
printer. Check your camera manufacturer’s Web site to see what types 
of docks may be available, if any, for your camera.
 
✓ Wireless transfer: A few cameras now offer wireless transfer, taking 
advantage of the same technologies employed by wireless Internet 
connections, television remote controls, and other wireless devices. In 
order to take advantage of this feature, both your camera and computer 
must have the right wireless equipment. Chapter 1 gives you a look at 
one new product that enables wireless connection, the Eye-Fi memory 
card. (Only some cameras can use this type of card.)
 
 Because setting up wireless transfer varies depending on the specific 
technology, camera, and computer, we must refer you to your camera 
manual for help with that process.
  
✓ Let a pro do it for you. Not all that comfortable with computers? You 
may find it easier to have your local photo lab copy your files to a CD for 
you. You can have a CD made at the same time you print your pictures. 
Then you can put only the pictures you want to edit, e-mail, or access on 
your computer’s hard drive — you just put the CD in the CD drive and 
copy pictures just as you may have done with music files or data files. 
Almost any place that can print digital photos offers this service.
Tips for smoother downloading
Whichever transfer option you choose, a couple of pointers can help the 
whole thing run more smoothly:
 
✓ Transfer speed: The speed at which your image files travel from 
memory card to your computer depends on the size of the picture files, 
the speed of the card, the speed of the computer, and the speed of the 
connection type itself. If you use a USB connection, make sure that your 
equipment offers USB 2.0, which is the latest (and fastest) version of that 
technology. Chapter 2 talks a little more about memory card speeds; see 
Chapter 4 to get details about two of the factors that affect file size, reso-
lution, and file format.
 
✓ Transfer software: When your computer detects the presence of digi-
tal images, whether they’re on a CD, a DVD, a connected camera, or a 
memory card, it’s likely that the computer will automatically display 
some sort of window or program that offers to help you download your 
photos. In fact, multiple windows may appear. You may see a Windows 
utility, for example, as shown in Figure 8-3, or iPhoto on the Mac, as 
shown in Figure 8-4. And then a few seconds later, a download tool that’s 
part of your photo software or camera software may pop up and beg you 
to let it do your downloading.

191
 Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse
 
 
Figure 8-3: On a Windows-based computer, the system 
 
may display this screen full of download options.
 
 
Figure 8-4: On a Mac, iPhoto may automatically start up when the computer detects a memory 
 
card or camera. 

192
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 You can use whichever of these tools you find easiest; just close the win-
dows for the ones that you want to ignore. Better yet, consult the Help 
systems of those programs to find out how to disable the automatic 
launch. And if nothing pops up, you can start up your favorite download 
program as you normally launch any program.
 
 Also note that even though you download images using one program, 
you don’t have to stick with that program for editing your images. You 
can download using iPhoto, for example, and then open and edit the 
transferred photos in Adobe Photoshop Elements.
 
✓ Transfer options: Although it’s impossible to provide specifics on all the 
possible download tools, they all pretty much work the same way: You 
click the thumbnails of the images you want to download and then click 
a button (usually labeled Download or Import or something similar), and 
the program takes it from there.
 
 Most downloaders do provide you with lots of ways to customize the 
download. For example, you typically can specify the folder and drive 
where you want to store your photos. (In true geeky fashion, the option 
is usually referred to as the destination folder.) See the upcoming side-
bar “File-organization tips” for some suggestions on the best choices to 
make.
 
 Do look out for a couple of potentially dangerous options:
 
• Erase originals after download: One typical option is to automati-
cally erase the original images on your card as you transfer them 
to the computer. Disable that option just in case something goes 
haywire. It’s not a good idea to erase the images on your card until 
you’re confident that they’re safely stored on your hard drive. 
 
• Automatically fix red-eye: A couple of downloaders, including the 
one provided with Photoshop Elements, automatically attempt to 
try to remove red-eye during the download process. This option 
can cause your downloads to take forever as the program tries to 
locate and fix areas that it thinks may be red-eye. It’s better to do 
the job yourself after downloading; see Chapter 9 for the step-by-
step instructions.
 
✓ Drag-and-drop transfer: If you’re an experienced computer user, you 
may prefer not to use any photo-download software. Instead, you can 
just use the system file-management tools — Windows Explorer or the 
Mac Finder — to drag and drop files from your card or camera to the 
hard drive. The next section, “Downloading from a card reader,” demon-
strates the drag-and-drop technique.

193
 Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse
Downloading from a card reader
If you own a relatively new computer or photo printer, it may be equipped 
with one or more memory-card slots. Assuming that one of those slots 
accepts the type of memory card that your camera uses, you’re set: Just take 
the card out of the camera and put it in the slot. (For a printer slot, be sure to 
turn the printer on, or your computer won’t see the card.)
No built-in card slots? You can buy a card reader for very little cash at any 
electronics, office supply, or camera store. You can either buy a reader that 
accepts just one type of card or a product like the Kingston reader shown 
in Figure 8-5, which works with 19 different card types. Either way, to install 
the card reader, simply plug it in to an empty USB port on your computer. In 
most cases, card readers are “plug-and-play” — that is, your computer rec-
ognizes the reader without any further help from you. But some card read-
ers ship with some software that you need to install, so be sure to check the 
instructions on the product box. 
File-organization tips
When you transfer picture files to your com-
puter, you can store them in any folder on your 
hard drive that you like. But it’s a good idea to 
stick with the default location that your comput-
er’s operating system sets aside for digital pic-
tures. The folder is named either Pictures or My 
Pictures, depending on your operating system 
(Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac Leopard, 
and so on). Most photo-editing programs, as 
well as other programs that you may use to 
work with your pictures, look first in the default 
folders when you go to transfer, edit, and save 
pictures. So keeping your images in those fold-
ers saves you the trouble of hunting down some 
custom folder every time you want to work with 
your photos.
After you amass a large image collection, 
you may want to create subfolders inside the 
Pictures or My Pictures folder so that you can 
better organize your photos. For example, you 
can create a Travel subfolder to hold travel 
photos, a Family subfolder for family images, 
and so on.
You might even like to rename your individual 
photos with file names that let you reference 
them specifically. For example, suppose you 
took pictures in France in the year 2008. You 
might rename the files this way:
 Original File Name: 
DSCN0223.jpg
 Your New File Name: France 08-0223.jpg
That way, you can identify the picture subject and 
year by looking at the first part of the filename, yet 
by keeping the original file number, each image 
has a unique identifier. Some photo programs 
offer automated file renaming tools that can make 
this organizational step a breeze, too.

194
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
If you happen to have a card reader 
that doesn’t support your type of 
memory card, you may be able to 
buy an adapter that makes the two 
devices compatible or allows you to 
plug the memory card right into a 
USB port.
In any case, the computer should 
automatically recognize the card, 
seeing it as just another drive, like 
a CD drive or DVD drive. From this 
point, you can either use one of 
the aforementioned photo down-
loaders, following the instructions 
provided by the specific program, 
or you can simply drag and drop the 
files from the card to the computer. 
The process is the same as you use 
to copy and move any type of file 
using Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder.
For example, Figure 8-6 shows how a four-slot card reader shows up in 
Windows Vista version of Windows Explorer. (This Explorer is the Windows 
file-management tool, not Internet Explorer, which is a Web browser.) Each 
slot on the card reader shows up as a separate drive in the list on the left 
side of the window. In some cases, the camera brand name appears along 
with the drive letter; in the figure, for example, the card contained images 
taken with a Canon EOS camera, so EOS_Digital appears. 
Normally, you have to open a folder or two to get to the actual image files. 
They’re typically housed inside a main folder named DCIM (for digital camera 
images), as shown in Figure 8-6, and then within a subfolder that uses the 
camera manufacturer’s name or folder-naming structure. After you open 
the folder, you may see thumbnails of the images, as in the figure, or simply 
the names of the files. (In Windows Explorer, you can display thumbnails by 
opening the View menu and choosing Large Icons or Medium Icons.)
On a Mac, the card should appear as a drive on the desktop. Double-click the 
drive icon to open a Finder window and access the card contents, as shown 
in Figure 8-7. Again, you have to open a series of folders to get to the actual 
images.

Figure 8-7: On a Mac, you can drag and drop files using the Finder.

196
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
If you’re shooting Camera Raw images, they may not appear as thumbnails 
depending on the camera model and the version of the Windows or Mac 
operating system you use. But you can see the filenames and still transfer 
them to your computer. (This applies to photo downloaders too, unless 
you’re using software provided by the camera manufacturer, in which case 
the thumbnails should be visible.)
After opening the folder that contains the images, select the ones you want to 
transfer and then just drag them to the folder on your hard drive where you 
want to store them, as shown in Figure 8-8. Although it’s not visible in the 
figure, you should see a little plus sign next to your cursor when you drag. 
The plus sign indicates that you’re placing a copy of the pictures files on the 
computer; your originals remain on the card. When you’re sure that the files 
made it to their new home, you can put the card back into the camera and 
erase the originals.
 
 
Figure 8-8: After selecting the pictures you want to transfer, just drag them to their new home.
 
To select one image file for copying, click it. To select additional files, 
Ctrl+click them in Windows or Ô+click them on a Mac. Or, to select all the 
files, press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Ô+A (Mac).

 Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse
Downloading from the camera
As an alternative to using a memory-card reader, you can attach your camera 
to the computer and transfer images directly. Virtually all digital cameras 
today connect to your computer via a USB hookup, introduced at the start of 
this chapter. You might have to plug the USB cable into your camera, or your 
camera may sit in a docking station that plugs into your USB port on your 
computer. 
 
Either way, your camera manual undoubtedly provides specifics on the pro-
cess of connecting to a computer. As you work through the download steps 
for the first time, keep the manual handy so that you can find out whether 
you need to follow any special procedures along the way. For example, you 
may need to install software that shipped with the camera before you even 
connect the camera to the computer.
With those caveats in mind, the following steps provide a basic look at the 
process:
 
1. Check the camera’s battery status.
 
 If the battery is low, charge it before moving on. You can damage the 
camera, the memory card, and your picture files if the battery dies in the 
middle of the transfer process. 
 
 Alternatively, if your camera came with an AC adapter, power the 
camera that way for downloads.
 
2. Turn the computer on, but turn the camera off.
 
 With some cameras, connecting to the computer while the camera is 
powered up can cause problems.
 
3. Use the USB cable that shipped with your camera to connect the 
camera to an open USB port on the computer.
 
 The camera’s USB port is usually tucked under a little rubber flap or 
door; check the camera manual for help if you can’t find the port.
 
 On the computer side, try to use a built-in USB port rather than one 
that’s on a keyboard or an external USB hub. Sometimes the external 
hubs don’t work as smoothly for camera connections.  
 
4. Turn the camera on. 
 
5. Set the camera to the proper mode for image transfer.
 
 For this step, you need to consult your camera manual. With some cam-
eras, you have to choose a PC connection setting, for example, or you 
may need to switch to playback mode.

198
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 What happens next depends on what software you have installed on 
your system. But at the very least, an icon representing the camera 
should appear in Windows Explorer or on the Mac desktop. You can 
then drag and drop your picture files to the hard drive by using the 
same technique outlined in the preceding section. Or you can use your 
favorite photo-download software, as described earlier in the chapter.
 
6. When the download is complete, turn the camera off before discon-
necting it from the computer.
Converting Raw Files
Many new, high-end digital cameras can capture images in the Camera Raw 
file format, or just Raw, for short. As discussed in Chapter 4, this format 
stores raw picture data from the image sensor, without applying any of the 
usual post-processing that occurs when you shoot using the JPEG format.
 
Although you can transfer Raw files to your computer using the same pro-
cesses outlined in the first part of this chapter, you won’t be able to see 
them until you use an image-editing program that can recognize the files 
created by your specific camera. Most camera manufacturers provide soft-
ware in the camera box that enables you to view your pictures, and some 
third-party software can also display Raw files. (In the case of third-party pro-
grams, though, you may need to go to the software manufacturer’s Web site 
and download a “Raw update” to make the program compatible with your 
camera.) 
You usually can print your Raw files immediately from the camera maker’s 
software. But if you want to be able to edit your photos, share them online, 
or use them in any other programs, such as a multimedia program, you need 
to process the Raw files and then save them in a common image format. You 
take this step by using a software tool known as a Raw converter. Again, your 
camera software may offer a Raw converter, and many photo-editing pro-
grams also offer this tool. 
When you process Raw files, you usually have some options as to how you 
want the raw data translated into a photo. You may, for example, be able to 
adjust brightness, color tone, white balance, and so on. The extent to which 
you can control these characteristics of your photos varies depending on 
the converter. Some converters are pretty sophisticated, but others, includ-
ing some provided by camera manufacturers, automatically set all the image 
characteristics for you. These simplistic converters simply change the file 
format from Raw to a standard format, usually either TIFF or JPEG, applying 
the same picture-characteristic choices you would get if you shot them in the 
JPEG format instead of Raw. 

199
 Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse
Just to give you an idea of how the Raw conversion process works with a 
converter that does enable you to specify image characteristics, the following 
steps give you an overview of the process in Photoshop Elements:
 
1. Follow your normal process for transferring files to your computer.
 
 Again, the first part of this chapter explains the transfer process.
 
2. In Elements, choose File➪Open to launch the Open dialog box.
 
3. Track down the file and click Open.
 
 Elements recognizes that the file is in the Raw format and launches 
the Adobe Camera Raw window, shown in Figure 8-9. Be sure that the 
Preview check box at the top of the window is turned on; if not, click it. 
Now you can see the results of any changes you make.
 
4. Use the controls on the right side of the window to tweak the image 
appearance if necessary.
 Figure 8-9: You must convert files shot in the Camera Raw format to a standard format before you can 
open them.

200
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 The preview that appears initially shows the image according to the 
camera settings that were in force when you shot the image. To put 
it another way, the preview shows you the image as it would have 
appeared if you captured it in the JPEG format, and the camera applied 
its normal color, sharpness, and exposure settings. However, this pre-
view just represents your starting point. You can tweak exposure, white 
balance, color saturation, and image sharpness by using the controls 
on the right side of the dialog box. You can find complete details about 
what each control does in the Elements Help system.
 
5. Click Open Image to finish opening the file.
 
 Your picture opens in the Elements editing window.
 
6. Choose File➪Save As to open the Save As dialog box.
 
7. Save the file in the TIFF format. 
 
 This format retains your image at its highest quality. Don’t save in the 
JPEG format; when you do, the picture can lose some quality because 
of the way the file is compressed during the saving process. For details 
on TIFF and JPEG, see Chapter 4; skip ahead to Chapter 9 for specifics 
about the file-saving process and options that appear when you save in 
the TIFF format.
Again, for details about the specific conversion settings in your Raw con-
verter, check the program’s Help system. You can also find lots of good tuto-
rials online for popular programs, such as Elements and Photoshop.
Whichever converter you use, however, a few general tips apply:
 
✓ Don’t erase your original Raw file. You may someday want to convert the 
file using different settings. And retaining the Raw file means that you 
always have an original image in pristine condition that you can return 
to if necessary.
 
✓ The settings you use when making your Raw conversion stay with 
the Raw file, sort of like an invisible recipe card. So the next time you 
re-open the file in the converter, you don’t have to go through all the 
adjustments again; they’re automatically applied as you did them the 
first time. But because your picture data still is technically “raw,” you 
can apply a whole new set of adjustments without doing any damage to 
your picture.
 
✓ Before you do any Raw conversions — or any photo editing, for that 
matter — you should calibrate your monitor to ensure that you’re look-
ing at an accurate representation of the picture brightness, color, and so 
on. Chapter 10 talks more about monitor calibration.
 
✓ Remember that Raw files have different filenames depending on the 
camera manufacturer. Nikon files go by the name NEF; Canon, CR2; and 
so on. In Windows, you see these three-letter extensions at the ends of 
the filenames.

201
 Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse
Recovering Deleted Files (Maybe)
It happens to everyone sooner or later: You accidentally erase an important 
picture — or worse, an entire folder full of images. Don’t panic yet — you 
may be able to get those pictures back.
 
The first step: Stop shooting. If you take another picture, you may not be able 
to rescue the deleted files. If you must keep shooting, and you have another 
memory card, replace the one with the accidental erasure with the other 
card. You can work with the problem card later. 
For pictures that you erased using the camera’s delete function, go online 
or to your local computer store to buy a file-recovery program such as 
MediaRECOVER ($30, www.mediarecover.com) or RescuePRO ($40, www.
lc-tech.com). For these programs to work, your computer must be able to 
access the camera’s memory card as if the card were a regular drive on the 
system. So if your camera doesn’t show up as a drive when you connect it to 
the computer, you need to buy a card reader. 
If you erased pictures on the computer, you may not need any special soft-
ware. In Windows Explorer, deleted files go to the Recycle Bin and stay there 
until you empty the Bin. Assuming that you haven’t taken that step, just open 
the Bin, click an erased file, and then choose File➪Restore to “un-erase” the 
picture. On a Mac, deleted files linger in the Trash folder until you choose 
the Empty Trash command. Until you do, you can open the Trash folder and 
move the deleted file to another folder on your hard drive. 
Already emptied the Recycle Bin or Trash? You also can buy programs to 
recover files that were dumped in the process; start your software search at 
the two aforementioned Web sites.
Looking at Organizational Software
Some camera manufacturers provide a custom photo-browsing and organiz-
ing tool on the software CD that ships in the camera box. Many photo-editing 
programs also offer this kind of tool; Figure 8-10 shows the organizer utility 
included for the Windows version of Photoshop Elements 6, for example. (If 
you’re running Elements 6.0 on the Mac, you also get a file-browsing tool, but 
it’s a little different from the one provided for the Windows version.) 
Depending on your computer’s operating system, it also may offer tools for 
browsing through thumbnails of your digital photo files: 
 
 
 

202
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Figure 8-10: Photoshop Elements provides a built-in photo organizer; here, you see the Windows version.
 
✓ Recent versions of Windows, for example, enable you to view thumb-
nails in Windows Explorer, as shown in Figure 8-6, earlier in this chapter. 
Explorer also has a very convenient search function that can track down 
the location of a specific file, provided you can tell it the filename.
 
✓ If you work on a Macintosh computer running OS X 10.1.2 or later, you 
have access to iPhoto, also shown earlier, in Figure 8-4. (The window 
may look different depending on what version of the operating system 
and iPhoto you use.) Apple provides a copy with all new Mac systems, 
and you can then purchase subsequent updates from the Apple Web 
site. 
Again, these Windows and Mac system tools may not display files if you 
shoot them in the Camera Raw format, and the same may hold true for some 
third-party organizer programs. See the preceding discussions of the Raw 
format for more information.

203
 Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse
I never metadata I didn’t like
Digital cameras store metadata along with pic-
ture data when recording an image to memory. 
Metadata is a fancy name for extra information 
that gets stored in a special area of the image 
file. Digital cameras record such information as 
the aperture, shutter speed, exposure compen-
sation, and other camera settings as metadata.
To capture and retain metadata, digital cameras 
typically store images using a variation of the 
JPEG file format known as EXIF, which stands 
for exchangeable image format. This flavor of 
JPEG is often stated in camera literature as 
JPEG (EXIF). Note, though, that metadata is 
also stored when you shoot in the Camera Raw 
format instead of JPEG. (Chapter 4 explains all 
this file format stuff.)
The important point is that you can view meta-
data in many photo-editing and cataloging 
programs. For example, the area highlighted 
in red in the following figure shows a por-
tion of the metadata panel found in a program 
provided with some Canon cameras, Canon 
ZoomBrowser EX. (For Mac users, the program 
is called ImageBrowser instead.)
By reviewing the metadata for each image, you 
can get a better grasp on how the various set-
tings on your camera affect your images. It’s 
like having a personal assistant trailing around 
after you, making a record of your photographic 
choices each time you press the shutter button — 
only you don’t have to feed this assistant lunch or 
provide health insurance.

204
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
You also can find many good third-party picture-organizing programs; these 
tools are sometimes called digital asset management, or DAM applications by 
digital photography aficionados. (Yes, you pronounce it just the way it looks, 
believe it or not.)
Figure 8-11 offers a look at one good option, ACDSee Pro (www.acdsystems.
com). A couple of other choices to investigate include ThumbsPlus (www.
cerious.com) and Extensis Portfolio (www.extensis.com).
A significant advantage of these products lies in their database features, 
which you can use to assign keywords to images and then search for files 
using those keywords. For example, if you have an image of a Labrador 
retriever, you might assign the keywords “dog,” “retriever,” and “pet” to the 
picture’s catalog information. When you later run a search, entering any of 
those keywords as search criteria brings up the image. You can also then 
rate and prioritize your photos in any order you like.
Figure 8-11: Products such as ACDSee Pro make it easier to manage a large photo collection.

205
 Chapter 8: Building Your Image Warehouse
 
Again, your photo editor may offer some of the same features as you find in 
third-party organizers. So be sure to explore those tools before you invest in 
an unneeded extra program. And note that you can download free trials of 
most programs from the vendor’s Web site, which enables you to try before 
you buy.

Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
In This Chapter
▶ Opening and saving pictures
▶ Cropping out unwanted elements
▶ Removing red-eye
▶ Tweaking exposure and color
▶ Creating the illusion of sharper focus
O
ne of the great things about digital photography is that you’re never 
limited to the image that comes out of the camera, as you are with tra-
ditional photography. With film, a lousy picture stays lousy forever. Sure, you 
can get one of those little pens to cover up red-eye problems, and if you’re 
really good with scissors, you can crop out unwanted portions of the picture. 
But that’s about the extent of the corrections you can do without a 
full-blown film lab at your disposal.
With a digital image and a basic photo-editing program, 
however, you can fix many common picture problems 
with surprisingly little effort. This chapter explains 
the basics, offering simple steps for correcting expo-
sure, color, red-eye, and more.
What Software Do You Need?
In this chapter, and in others that describe specific 
photo-editing functions, we show you how to get the 
job done using Adobe Photoshop Elements. We chose 
this software for two reasons. First, it costs less than 
$100, yet offers many of the same features found in the more 
sophisticated (and more expensive) Adobe Photoshop, the lead-
ing professional-level photo editor. In addition, Elements is available for 
both Windows-based and Macintosh computers, which is a rarity in today’s 
Windows-centric computing world.

208
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Here are a few additional notes about the photo-editing instructions in this 
book:
 
✓ Steps and illustrations feature Elements 6.0. However, if you’re using 
another version of the program, the core components are much the 
same.
 
✓ Text marked with an Elements How-To icon relates specifically to 
Elements. This chapter is just intended to help you get your feet wet 
with Elements, however. If you want to dig deeper into the program, 
many excellent books are available, and the program’s built-in Help 
system is quite good as well.
 
✓ In figures, the Elements toolbox appears as a two-column affair run-
ning down the left side of the program window, as shown in Figure 9-1, 
but yours may occupy just a single column. The arrangement depends 
on the size of the program window; if the window is small, the toolbox 
shrinks itself in height so that you can see the entire toolbox at all times.
 
✓ Whatever the toolbox arrangement, you select a tool by clicking its icon 
in the toolbox. Controls related to that tool then appear on the options 
bar, labeled in Figure 9-1. On a Mac, choose Window➪Options Bar if you 
don’t see the options bar.
 
✓ In addition, we hid the Palette Bin and Project Bin in the figures to leave 
more room for the image itself. You can hide and display these compo-
nents via the Window menu.
 
✓ Finally, instructions assume that you’re working in Full Edit mode. If 
your screen is set to one of the other two modes, Quick Edit or Guided 
Edit, open the Palette Bin. Then click the Full Edit button at the top of 
the bin. You can then close the bin. Again, you can toggle the bins on 
and off by clicking their names on the Window menu.
Readers who own Adobe Photoshop will find that many of that program’s 
tools work exactly as they do in Elements, although the Photoshop versions 
may offer a broader array of options. If you use a photo editor other than 
Elements or Photoshop, be assured that you can easily adapt the information 
provided in this book to your software. Most photo-editing programs provide 
similar tools to the ones we discuss here. And the basic photo-retouching 
concepts and photographic ideas are the same no matter what photo soft-
ware you prefer.
So use this chapter as a guide for understanding the general approach you 
should take when editing your digital pictures, and consult your software’s 
manual or online Help system for the specifics of applying certain techniques.

Opening Your Photos
Before you can work on a digital photo, you have to open it inside your 
photo-editing program. In just about every program on the planet, you can 
use the following techniques to crack open a picture file:
 
✓ Choose File➪Open.
 
✓ Use the universal keyboard shortcut for the Open command: In 
Windows, press Ctrl+O; on a Mac, press Ô+O.
Whichever method you choose, the program displays the same dialog box 
you see when you open files in any program. Just track down your picture file 
and click the Open button as usual. For help getting your files onto your com-
puter in the first place, check out Chapter 8.

210
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Just a few other file-opening points to note:
 
✓ Some programs, including Elements, offer a built-in file browser that 
you can use to preview thumbnails of your picture files before you open 
them. After you locate the picture you want to edit, you usually can just 
double-click the thumbnail to open the file.
 
✓ If you captured your pictures using the Camera Raw file format, you 
need to convert them to a standard file format such as TIFF before you 
can edit the files. Chapter 8 offers a look at the Raw-conversion process.
 
✓ If your picture opens on its side, use your software’s Rotate com-
mands to set things right. In Elements, the commands reside on the 
Image➪Rotate submenu.
Saving Your Edited Photos
Chapter 2 discusses options for preserving your original photo files. You also 
need to take precautions to preserve any changes you make to your pictures 
in your photo editor.
Until you save the edited picture, all your work is vulnerable. If your system 
crashes, the power goes out, or some other cruel twist of fate occurs, every-
thing you did since the last time you saved the picture is lost forever. So 
commit the following image-safety rules to memory:
Why is my photo software so sluggish?
Photo editing requires a substantial amount 
of free RAM (system memory). If your com-
puter slows to a crawl when you open a pic-
ture, try shutting down all programs, restarting 
your computer, and then starting your photo 
software only. (Be sure to disable any startup 
routines that launch programs automatically in 
the background when you fire up your system.) 
Now you’re working with the maximum RAM 
your system has available. If your computer 
continues to complain about a memory short-
age, consider adding more memory — memory 
is relatively cheap right now, fortunately.
Understand, too, that your photo software uses 
your computer’s hard drive space as well as 
RAM when processing images. In Elements, 
you see a message saying that your scratch 
disk is full when you run out of drive space; 
other programs may use different terminology. 
In any case, you can solve the problem by delet-
ing unneeded files to free up some room on the 
hard drive. Another option is to buy an external 
hard drive and move your less-used files to that 
drive.

211
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
 
✓ Saving for the first time: To save an edited picture for the first time, 
choose File➪Save As. You’re presented with a dialog box in which you 
can enter a name for the file and choose a storage location on the disk, 
just as you do when saving any other type of document. The dialog box 
may contain a few options related just to your photo program as well; 
because of space limitations, we must refer you to your software’s Help 
system for the lowdown on these options.
 
 If you don’t want to overwrite your original photo file, be sure to give 
the picture a new name, choose a different file format, or store it in a 
separate folder from the original.
 
✓ Saving works in progress: As you work on a photo, resave the file peri-
odically. You can usually simply press Ctrl+S in Windows or Ô+S on a 
Mac to resave the image without messing with a dialog box.
 
 Do not use this tactic to save an altered file for the first time, or you’ll 
overwrite the original image file.
 
In most programs, you can specify a file format when you choose the Save As 
command. Always choose a non-destructive format to hold onto all your orig-
inal picture quality. The most universally available non-destructive format is 
TIFF, first introduced in Chapter 4.
When you save an image as a TIFF file, you may see a dialog box like the one 
shown in Figure 9-2, which is from the Windows version of Elements.
Set the dialog box options as follows:
 
✓ Image Compression: Choose None. The LZW compression option is also 
safe in terms of preserving all your image data, but some programs can’t 
open files saved with LZW.
 
✓ Byte Order: Choose IBM PC if you know you’ll be using the file on a 
Windows-based system; choose Macintosh for a Mac system. But don’t 
stress too much about this one — most programs can open either type 
of file.
 
✓ Save Image Pyramid: Give this one a pass, too. When enabled, it creates 
a file that some programs won’t open.
 
✓ Save Transparency and Layer Compression: These options don’t come 
into play until you start using advanced Elements tools. For details 
about when you need to worry about them, check your program’s Help 
system. (Many photo programs don’t even offer these TIFF options.)

212
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 
Figure 9-2: Save edited files in a non-destructive 
 
format such as TIFF; select the options shown 
 
here, if available.
What about the two standard digital camera file formats, JPEG and Camera 
Raw? Well, as covered in Chapter 4, JPEG applies a form of file compression 
that degrades picture quality. So if you need a JPEG copy for some reason, 
perhaps for online sharing, wait until you’re completely finished retouching 
the photo, save the finished file in the TIFF format, and then create a copy in 
the JPEG format. Chapter 11 shows you how.
As for Camera Raw, only cameras can create files in that format. A non-
camera format called Photoshop Raw does exist, but it’s not the same 
thing and isn’t appropriate for saving your edited picture files. 
Removing Red-Eye
Shooting portraits with flash often leads to red-eye, that phenomenon that 
makes your subjects’ eyes appear to glow red. You may be able to lessen the 
problem by using your camera’s red-eye reduction flash mode, but even that 
feature doesn’t always do the trick. 

213
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
Some cameras offer a built-in red-eye removal filter that you can apply to 
pictures on your memory card. If your camera doesn’t offer that tool or if the 
camera’s filter doesn’t fix the picture successfully, you can usually remove 
red-eye in your photo software. Almost all photo-editing programs today 
sport a red-eye removal tool.
 
In Photoshop Elements, follow these steps to try it out:
 
1. Zoom in closely on the red-eye area.
 
 Click the image with the Zoom tool, labeled in Figure 9-3, to zoom in. (To 
zoom out, Alt-click with the tool in Windows or Option-click on a Mac.)
 
2. Select the Red-Eye Removal tool, labeled in Figure 9-3.
 
3. Click on a red pixel in the eye.
 
 Elements replaces the red pixels with pixels that it thinks produces a 
natural result. If you’re not happy with the outcome, choose Edit➪Undo. 
Then try again.
 
Red-Eye Removal tool

Figure 9-3: The Elements Red-Eye Removal tool does a decent job on

214
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 If the replacement pixels are too dark or too light, adjust the Darken 
Amount setting on the options bar. To cover up a larger or smaller por-
tion of the eye, adjust the Pupil Size setting. 
 
Although red-eye removal tools work well most of the time, they can falter if 
the red-eye pixels are very bright. Red-eye tools also don’t work on animal 
eyes; the tools only know how to replace red pixels, and animal eyes take on 
a green, yellow, or white glow in flash pictures. In both scenarios, the easiest 
solution is to simply paint in a new eye color with your photo editor’s paint 
brush. Just dab over the red pixels with dark paint, making sure that you 
don’t cover up the natural white highlight pixels that should occur in the eye. 
(If you happen to do so, just put the highlight back by painting with white.)
Cropping Your Pictures
Chapter 7 offers tips on photo composition. But if you’re not happy with 
the composition you created when you took a picture, you may be able to 
improve it by cropping.
Figure 9-4 offers an example. In this photo, the subject was posing in front 
of a nicely textured, old wall in Barcelona, Spain. But there’s just too much 
wall and not enough subject in the photo. Cropping away some of the excess 
background resulted in the better image shown in Figure 9-5.

image begs for some cropping.

215
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
 
The following steps explain how to 
give your image a haircut by using the 
Elements Crop tool. Every photo program 
offers a comparable tool, most of which 
work similarly to the Elements version.
 
1. Click the Crop tool icon in the 
toolbox. 
 
 The Crop tool is located in the posi-
tion shown in Figure 9-6.
 
2. Specify the proportions you want 
for your cropped photo by using the 
Aspect Ratio options.
 
 Click open the Aspect Ratio drop-
down list, labeled “Set crop propor-
tions” in Figure 9-6. The list contains 
a variety of traditional print sizes — 
4 x 6 inches, 5 x 7, and so on. If your 
goal is to produce a photo that fits 
one of those sizes, click it in the 
list. You then see the dimensions appear in the neighboring Width and 
Height boxes. (If you want to reverse the values, click the little arrows 
between the two boxes.)
 
 Don’t see the size you want on the list? Just enter the dimensions in the 
Width and Height boxes yourself. Or, if you’re not yet sure what propor-
tions you want the photo to have, choose No Restriction from the drop-
down list.
 
 Avoid the Use Photo Ratio option that appears on the list. If you choose 
this setting, the program resamples your photo after you crop, adding 
enough pixels to the photo to restore the original image pixel count. The 
same thing occurs if you enter a value in the Resolution box (next to the 
Height box), so be sure that box is empty. Adding pixels usually reduces 
picture quality, for reasons you can explore in Chapter 4.
 
3. Drag across the image to create your initial crop outline, as shown in 
Figure 9-6.
 
 When you release the mouse button, you see a dotted outline that has 
little square boxes on the sides and corners. Figure 9-7 gives you a close-
up look at these boxes, officially known as handles. The area outside the 
outline appears dimmed to help you better see the photo that will result 
from your current crop boundary.

emphasis to the subject.

Figure 9-6: Just drag to surround your subject with a crop box. 
 
 As you decide how much of your original image to crop away, keep 
image resolution in mind if you plan to print the photo: You need 
enough pixels in the cropped photo to produce a good print. How much 
of the original image you need to keep depends on the initial pixel count. 
For help with this issue, see Chapter 4.
 
4. Refine the crop outline if needed.
 
 You can resize and relocate the crop outline as follows:
 
• Drag a handle to resize the crop box. As you drag, the program limits 
you to drawing a crop outline that matches the proportions you 
selected from the Aspect Ratio drop-down list in Step 2. If you chose 

217
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
No Restriction, however, you 
can create a crop boundary 
of any proportions.
 
 Be careful when you drag 
a corner handle! If you 
place the cursor outside a 
corner handle, it changes 
to a curved, two-headed 
arrow, and dragging rotates 
the crop box. And after 
you apply the crop, the 
image is rotated according 
to the angle of the box. To 
avoid this, move the cursor 
directly over the handle to 
return to the straight, two-
headed arrow cursor. You 
can then drag the corner 
handle safely.
 
• Drag inside the crop box to 
move it. If you have trouble 
precisely positioning the 
crop box by dragging, put 
your cursor inside the box 
and then press an arrow key 
on your keyboard to nudge 
it one pixel at a time in the 
direction of the arrow.
 
5. To apply the crop, click the green Accept check box (labeled in 
Figure 9-7).
 
 The Cancel button, also labeled in the figure, lets you escape the crop 
operation instead. (Note that the position of your Accept and Cancel 
buttons may be different than in the figure depending on the size of your 
crop box.)
 
6. Save the cropped image.
 
 To do so, choose File➪Save As. For best results, choose TIFF as the file 
format. See the file-saving information at the start of this chapter for the 
complete story on saving edited files.

Fixing Exposure After the Fact
At first glance, the underexposed picture on the left side of Figure 9-8 appears 
to be a throwaway. But don’t give up on images like this because you may 
be able to rescue that too-dark image, as shown on the right here. The next 
three sections explain how to use a variety of exposure-repair tools.
 
 
Figure 9-8: An underexposed image (left) sees new light (right).
Basic brightness/contrast controls
Many photo-editing programs offer one-shot brightness/contrast filters that 
adjust your image automatically. These automatic correction tools tend to 
do too much or too little and, depending on the image, can even alter image 
colors dramatically.
Fortunately, most programs also provide exposure controls that enable you 
to specify the extent of the correction. These controls are easy to use and 
almost always produce better results than the automatic variety.

219
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
The most basic exposure and contrast tools work like the Elements 
Brightness/Contrast filter, found on the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting menu 
and shown in Figure 9-9. You just drag the sliders to adjust brightness or 
contrast.
Figure 9-9: Raising the Brightness and Contrast values brought midtones into an acceptable range, but also 
blew out all color in the sky.
 
Although the Brightness/Contrast filter is easy to use, it’s not always a ter-
rific solution because it adjusts all pixels by the same amount. That’s fine 
for some pictures, but often, you don’t need to make wholesale exposure 
changes.

220
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
For example, in the too-dark image shown in Figure 9-8, the shadows are 
where they need to be, exposure-wise. Only the highlights and midtones — 
areas of medium brightness — need lightening. In the left image in Figure 9-9, 
raising the Brightness value enough to get the midtones to the right level cre-
ated a new problem: Pixels that were formerly very light became white, and 
pixels that used to be black jumped up the brightness scale to dark gray. The 
result was a decrease in contrast and a loss of detail in the highlights and 
shadows. Raising the Contrast value only made the situation worse, as shown 
in the right image in the figure. The contrast shift amped up the highlights 
way too much, blew out detail in the sky, and caused the distant mountaintop 
to disappear.
 
For a better alternative, find out whether your photo editor offers more-
sophisticated exposure-correction tools, such as two described in the next 
sections (the Levels filter and Shadows/Highlights filter).
Brightness adjustments at higher levels
Advanced photo-editing programs provide a Levels filter, which enables 
you to darken shadows, brighten highlights, and adjust midtones (areas of 
medium brightness) independently. Depending on your software, the Levels 
filter may go by another name; check the manual or online Help system 
to find out whether you have a Levels-like function. In Elements, choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels to access the filter.
When you apply this filter, you typically see a dialog box that’s full of strange-
sounding options, graphs, and such. Figure 9-10 shows the Levels dialog box 
from Elements, along with the original too-dark image from the preceding 
section. Don’t be intimidated — after you know what’s what, the controls are 
easy to use. 
 
The chart-like thing in the middle of the dialog box is a histogram. You may 
have seen a histogram on your camera’s LCD monitor associated with each 
image. This is the same histogram, just showing up with your image in the 
software instead of on your camera.
Chapter 5 introduces you to histograms, but as a review, a histogram maps 
out all brightness values in the image, with the darkest pixels plotted on the 
left side of the graph and the brightest pixels on the right. The histogram 
in Figure 9-10 reveals a heavy concentration of pixels at the dark end of the 
exposure range and a limited pixel population in the middle and high end.

221
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
Midtones
Shadows
Highlights
Figure 9-10: Drag the sliders under the histogram to adjust shadows, midtones, and highlights independently.
Being able to read a histogram is a fun parlor game, but the real goal of the 
Levels filter is to adjust those brightness values to create a better-looking pic-
ture. Here’s what you need to know:
 
✓ Levels dialog boxes offer separate controls for adjusting shadows, 
highlights, and midtones. Often, these three controls are labeled Input 
Levels. In Elements, you can adjust the Input Levels values by enter-
ing numbers in the boxes below the histogram or dragging the sliders 
beneath the histogram.
 
• Shadows: Adjust shadows by changing the value in the leftmost 
Input Levels option box or dragging the corresponding slider, 
labeled in Figure 9-10. Drag the slider to the right or raise the value 
to darken shadows. Some programs refer to this control as the Low 
Point control.
 
• Midtones: Tweak midtones using the middle box or slider, labeled 
Midtones in Figure 9-10. Drag the slider left or raise the value to 
brighten midtones; drag right or lower the value to darken them. 
This control sometimes goes by the name Gamma or Midpoint 
control.

222
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
• Highlights: Manipulate the lightest pixels in the photo by chang-
ing the value in the rightmost box or dragging its slider, labeled 
Highlights in the figure. To make the lightest pixels lighter, drag the 
slider to the left or lower the value. In some programs, this control 
goes by the name High Point control.
 
 Dragging the midtones and highlights sliders to the positions shown in 
the dialog box in Figure 9-11 produced the corrected image.
Figure 9-11: Dragging the midtones and highlights sliders to these positions created the final image.
 
 When you adjust the shadow or highlights slider in Elements, the mid-
tones slider moves in tandem. If you don’t like the change to the mid-
tones, just drag the midtones slider back to its original position.
 
✓ Adjusting Output Levels values reduces contrast. Levels dialog boxes 
also may contain Output Levels options, which enable you to set the 
maximum and minimum brightness values in your image. In other 
words, you can make your darkest pixels lighter and your bright-
est pixels darker — which has the effect of decreasing the contrast. 
Sometimes, you can bring an image that’s extremely overexposed into 
the printable range by setting a slightly lower maximum brightness 
value. However, in Elements and Photoshop, a better approach is to use 
the Shadows/Highlights filter, explained next.

223
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
 
✓ Adjust all color channels together. For color pictures, you may be able 
to adjust the brightness values for the red, green, and blue color chan-
nels independently. (For an explanation of channels, see Chapter 4.) 
In Elements, you select the channel that you want to adjust from the 
Channel drop-down list, which appears at the top of the Levels dialog 
box when you’re editing a color photo. However, adjusting brightness 
levels of individual channels affects the color balance of your photo 
more than anything else does, so for exposure correction, leave the 
Channel option set to RGB, as it is by default. 
Using the Shadows/Highlights filter
With the Levels filter, you can darken shadows and brighten highlights. 
To make the opposite shift — to lighten shadows and darken highlights — 
poke about your photo editor to see whether it offers something akin to 
the Elements Shadows/Highlights filter, shown in Figure 9-12. This filter 
provides a more capable option than the Levels filter’s Output controls or 
the Brightness/Contrast filter for coaxing details out of murky shadows or 
toning down too-bright highlights. To access the filter in Elements, choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/Highlights.
 
 
 Figure 9-12: The Shadows/Highlights filter lets you lighten shadows 
and darken highlights.
The street scene shown on the left in Figure 9-13 is an ideal candidate for this 
filter. The settings shown in Figure 9-12 brought back details formerly lost in 
the shadows.
Depending on the image, you may need to apply both the Shadows/Highlights 
filter and the Levels filter. For example, the “after” image in Figure 9-13 is 
vastly improved from the original. But following up with the Levels filter, 
brightening the highlights and midtones with the Levels filter, produced an 
even better result, as shown in Figure 9-14.

224
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 
 Figure 9-13: Lightening the shadows and boosting midtone contrast slightly produced the 
image on the right.
What’s an adjustment layer?
Some photo-editing programs, including 
Photoshop Elements, offer adjustment layers. 
Adjustment layers enable you to apply exposure 
and color-correction filters to a photo in a way 
that doesn’t permanently alter the picture. You 
can go back at any time and easily change the 
filter settings or even remove the filter. You also 
can easily expand the image area affected by 
the filter or remove the filter entirely from just a 
portion of the picture.
We don’t have room in this book to cover adjust-
ment layers, but we urge you to get acquainted 
with them if your photo software provides this 
feature. Using adjustment layers may seem a 
little complicated at first, but after you get the 
hang of using them, you’ll appreciate the added 
flexibility and convenience they offer.

Figure 9-14: Applying the Levels filter further improved the image, brightening highlights and midtones.
Giving Your Colors More Oomph
Images looking dull and lifeless? Toss them in the photo-editing machine with a 
cup of Saturation — the easy way to turn tired, faded colors into rich, vivid hues.
Take the image in Figure 9-15, for example. The colors just aren’t as brilliant 
as they looked in real life. All that’s needed to give the photo the more color-
ful outlook shown on the right is a Hue/Saturation filter, found in nearly every 
photo-editing program, including Photoshop Elements.
To adjust saturation in Elements, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation.
 
 The dialog box shown in Figure 9-16 opens.
 
2. Be sure the Colorize box is not selected. 
 
3. Be sure the Preview box is selected, as shown in the figure.
 
4. Drag the Saturation slider to the right to increase color intensity; drag 
left to remove color from your image.

226
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 If you select Master from the Edit drop-down list at the top of the dialog 
box, all colors in your picture receive the color boost or reduction. You 
also can adjust individual color ranges by selecting them from the list. 
You can tweak the reds, magentas, yellows, blues, cyans, or greens.

 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
Helping Unbalanced Colors
Incorrect white balance or other factors can cause an image’s color balance 
to be off. In other words, the pictures look too blue, too red, or too green, or 
exhibit some other color sickness.
The top picture in Figure 9-17 is a 
case in point. This photo, which 
shows a portion of an antique clover 
huller, has a slight blue color cast. 
You can spot the problem most 
easily in the belts and the top of the 
wooden wheel (lower-right corner), 
which should be black or dark gray.
You can remove a color cast by 
applying a color-balancing filter. This 
type of filter is typically designed 
around three color pairs: red and 
cyan; green and magenta; and blue 
and yellow. You manipulate the 
image by adjusting the balance of 
colors within those pairs, adding 
more of one color while subtracting 
the other. For example, the lower 
image in Figure 9-17 shows the huller 
picture after adding red and yellow 
and subtracting blue and cyan. Now 
the belts and wheel look gray, as 
they should. The color-balancing act 
also brought out the faded red and 
yellow paint of the clover huller. 
 
In Elements, the color-balancing 
filter goes by the name Color 
Variations. To access it, choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color 
Variations. The dialog box shown in 
Figure 9-18 appears.
The filter controls work as follows:
 
✓ You can adjust highlights, shadows, and midtones independently. Click 
one of the Range buttons, labeled in Figure 9-18, to specify which com-
ponent you want to alter.
 
✓ After selecting the range, use the color-shift thumbnails, also labeled in 
the figure, to adjust the colors.

 To add cyan, click the Decrease Red thumbnail; to add magenta, click 
the Decrease Green thumbnail; and to add yellow, click the Decrease 
Blue thumbnail.
 
✓ Use the Amount slider, located underneath the Range buttons, to con-
trol how much your picture changes with each click of a thumbnail.
 
✓ Although the Variations filter also offers controls for adjusting satura-
tion and exposure, you get more control over those aspects of your 
picture if you instead use the techniques outlined earlier in this chap-
ter. See the sections “Fixing Exposure After the Fact” and “Giving Your 
Colors More Oomph” for details.

229
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
Sharpening Focus
Although no photo-editing software can make a terribly unfocused image 
appear completely sharp, you can usually improve things a bit by using a 
sharpening filter. Figure 9-19 shows an example of how a little sharpening can 
give extra definition to a slightly soft image.
Figure 9-19: Sharpening increases contrast to create the illusion of sharper focus.
 
It’s important to understand that sharpening doesn’t actually adjust the focus 
of your photo. What it does is create the illusion of sharper focus by adding 
small halos along the borders between light and dark areas of the image. The 
dark side of the border gets a dark halo, and the light side of the border gets 
a light halo.
Take a look at Figure 9-20, for example, which offers close-up views of the 
original and sharpened photo from Figure 9-19. See the area where the light 
gray area meets the red area? The gray side of the border gets lighter, the red 
side gets darker. The border between the light gray and dark gray areas is 
similarly altered.

Sharpening halos
 
 Figure 9-20: The light side of a color boundary gets lighter; the dark side 
gets darker.
With that little sharpening lesson in mind, check your photo software’s Help 
system to find out what type of sharpening filter it offers. Some programs 
provide you with a fairly crude manual sharpening tool. You drag a slider 
one way to increase sharpening and drag in the other direction to decrease 
sharpening. Elements, Photoshop, and other more advanced photo-editing 
programs provide you with a much more capable filter, however, which goes 
by the curious name of Unsharp Mask.
 
The Unsharp Mask filter is named after a focusing technique used in tradi-
tional film photography. In the darkroom, unsharp masking has something to 
do with merging a blurred film negative — hence, the unsharp portion of the 
name — with the original film positive in order to highlight the edges (areas 
of contrast) in an image. And if you can figure that one out, you’re smarter 
than the average bear.
Despite its odd name, Unsharp Mask gives you much better control over the 
sharpening effect than the one-slider sharpening filters. You can sharpen 
either your entire image or just the edges — areas of high contrast, in imaging 
lingo. You also can control the size of the sharpening halos. And of course, 
you get precise control over how much sharpening is done.
 
To use the Unsharp Mask filter in Elements, choose Enhance➪Unsharp 
Mask. (If you use Elements 4.0 or earlier, the filter is instead located on the 
Filter➪Sharpen submenu.) The dialog box shown in Figure 9-21 appears.
The Unsharp Mask dialog box contains three sharpening controls: Amount, 
Radius, and Threshold. You find these same options in most Unsharp 
Mask dialog boxes, although the option names may vary from program to 
program. Here’s how to adjust the controls to apply just the right amount of 
sharpening:

231
 Chapter 9: Fixing Minor Photo Flubs
 
✓ Amount: This value determines 
the intensity of the effect. Higher 
values mean more intense 
sharpening.
 
✓ Radius: The Radius value con-
trols how many pixels neighbor-
ing an edge are affected by the 
sharpening — in other words, 
the size of the sharpening halos. 
Generally, stick with Radius 
values in the 0.5 to 2 range. Use 
values in the low end of that 
range for images that will be dis-
played on-screen. Values at the 
high end work better for printed 
images.
 
✓ Threshold: This option tells the 
program how much contrast 
must exist between two pixels 
before the boundary between 
them receives the sharpening 
effect. By default, the value is 0, 
which means that the slightest 
difference between pixels results in a kiss from the sharpening fairy. 
As you raise the value, fewer pixels are affected; high-contrast areas 
(edges) are sharpened, while the rest of the image is not.
 
 When sharpening photos of people, experiment with Threshold set-
tings in the 3 to 8 range, which can help keep the subject’s skin looking 
smooth and natural. If your image suffers from graininess or noise, rais-
ing the Threshold value can enable you to sharpen your image without 
making the noise even more apparent.
The right combination of settings depends on your original photo. But be 
careful not to go overboard. Too much sharpening gives the picture a rough, 
grainy look. In addition, you can wind up with obvious, glowing color halos 
along areas of high contrast.

G
etting a grip on all there is to know about digital photography can be a 
little overwhelming — we know, we’ve been there. So if you’re feeling 
like your head is already about to pop from all the new terms and techniques 
you’ve stuffed into it, we have great news for you: You need to read 
only the first section of this chapter to find out how to get ter-
rific prints of your digital photos.
Those first paragraphs introduce you to retail photo-
printing services that make getting digital prints 
easy, fast, and amazingly inexpensive. If you like, 
you can handle the whole thing via the Internet, 
without ever leaving home.
When you’re ready for do-it-yourself printing — and 
that process, too, has been greatly simplified since 
the first days of digital photography — the rest of 
the chapter offers tips on buying a photo printer and 
getting the best results from it. And whether you’re 
printing your own photos or letting someone else do the 
honor, this chapter also discusses ways to get your printed 
colors to match what you see on your monitor (or closer to that 
goal, anyway).

234
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Printing from a Lab
 
In the first years of digital photography, the only option for people who 
didn’t want to print their own photos was to find a professional photo lab 
that could handle digital files. Unless you lived in a major city, you probably 
didn’t have access to such a lab, and if you did, you paid big bucks to get 
your prints.
Now, any outlet that offers film developing, from your local drugstore to big-
box retailers such as Costco or Wal-Mart, also offers quick and easy digital 
photo processing. You just take your camera memory card to the store and 
specify what pictures you want to print. Depending on the service and the 
specific store, you can have the staff handle everything for you or upload 
your photos at a special kiosk and input your desired sizes, paper selections, 
and quantities. You can also do this online from the comfort of your own 
home, if you like; you simply upload the photos onto the store’s photo 
Web site.
The cost of retail printing continues to get less expensive, too. Depending 
on the number of prints you make, you can get 4 x 6-inch prints for as little 
as 17 cents apiece, and spend as little as $1.49 for an 8 x 10-inch print. And 
remember, the only prints you pay for are those you choose to upload, as 
opposed to how things worked in film days, when you paid to print the entire 
roll, including the pictures that didn’t turn out so great. 
You have a variety of options for getting your digital prints:
 
✓ One-hour printing: Take in your memory card, leave instructions about 
your print job, and go run other errands or do your shopping. Come 
back in an hour and pick up your prints.
 
 If you’re worried about a lab losing your memory card, by the way, you 
usually have the option of copying your pictures to a CD or some other 
removable media, such as one of those tiny flash memory keys, and 
taking that to the photo lab. Just make sure that the lab can accept the 
type of media you want to use.
 
✓ Instant-print kiosks: In a hurry? You may not even need to wait an hour 
for those prints. Many stores have kiosks that can print your pictures 
immediately. Again, you just put in your memory card, push a few but-
tons, and out come your prints. You can even do some retouching, such 
as cropping and eliminating red-eye, right at the kiosk.
 
✓ Order online, print locally: You can send your image files via the 
Internet to most retail photo printers and then specify the store 

235
 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
where you want your prints made. Then pick up the prints at your 
convenience.
 
 This option also makes it easy to get prints to faraway friends and rela-
tives. Instead of having the prints made at your local lab and then mail-
ing them off, you can simply upload your files to a lab near the people 
who want the prints. They can then pick up the prints at that lab. You 
can either prepay with a credit card or have the person getting the 
prints pay upon picking them up.
 
 For help finding a lab that’s conveniently located, check out www.take
greatpictures.com, which is provided by the Photo Marketing Associ-
ation and lists lots of locations by zip code. (Look for the Find a Photo 
Lab link.) Or, you can go directly to the Web sites of major retailers, 
such as Wal-mart or Costco, and find a list of printing services offered at 
each one. (Note that to use the Costco service, you have to be a Costco 
member.)
 
✓ Order online, get prints by mail: Some major retailers also offer this 
option. In addition, you can order prints by mail from online photo-
sharing sites such as Kodak Gallery (www.kodakgallery.com), Snapfish 
(www.snapfish.com), and Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com). You can read 
more about photo-sharing sites in Chapter 11.
Buying a Photo Printer
Even if you have most of your 
prints made at a retail lab, 
adding a photo printer to your 
digital-photography system is 
still a good investment, for sev-
eral reasons: 
 
✓ When you need only a 
print or two, it’s more 
convenient to do the job 
yourself than to send the 
pictures to a lab. 
 
✓ For times when you’re 
feeling artistic, you can print on special media, such as canvas-textured 
paper. With a model such as the $150 HP Photosmart D7460, shown in 
Figure 10-1, you can even output borderless prints in sizes up to 8.5 x 24 
inches. 
 
✓ Doing your own printing gives you complete control over the output, 
which is important to many photo enthusiasts, especially those who 
exhibit or sell their work.

output borderless inkjet prints up to 8.5 x 24 inches.

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
✓ Today’s photo printers can produce excellent results. In fact, most 
people can’t tell the difference between prints made at home and those 
made at a lab.
When you go printer shopping, you’ll encounter several types of printers. 
Each offers advantages and disadvantages, and the technology you choose 
depends on your budget, your printing needs, and your print-quality expecta-
tions. To help you make sense of things, the following sections discuss the 
three main types of consumer and small-office printers.
Inkjet printers
Inkjet printers work by forcing little drops of ink through nozzles onto the 
paper. Inkjet printers designed for the home office or small business cost 
anywhere from $50 to $1,300. 
 
Inkjets fall into three basic categories:
 
✓ General-purpose models: These printers are engineered to do a decent 
job on both text and pictures, but are sometimes geared more to text 
and document printing than photos.
 
✓ Photo printers: Sometimes referred to as photocentric printers, these 
models are designed with the digital photographer in mind and usually 
produce better-quality photographic output than all-purpose printers. 
But they’re sometimes not well suited to everyday text printing because 
the print speed can be slower than on a general-purpose machine. They 
also require more individual ink cartridges and may only output small, 
snapshot-size images. However, many printers do have a foot in both the 
general-purpose and photo printer camps, offering good results for all 
printing uses.
 
✓ Multi-purpose printers: These models combine a printer with a flatbed 
scanner (which can also be used as a document copier) and sometimes 
also a fax machine. So you can print an image file or scan a printed 
photo and turn it into a digital file — and then print it again! Figure 10-2 
shows one all-in-one model, the Epson Stylus Photo RX680. This par-
ticular machine can even print directly onto printable CDs and DVDs, so 
you can label your own disks. Today, many multi-purpose printers offer 
great photo-printing abilities, but some are more business oriented and 
are engineered more to document printing.
Typically, photo-printing quality peaks as you reach the $150 price range, 
though. Higher-priced inkjets offer speedier printing and extra features, such 
as the following:
 
✓ Ability to print on wide-format paper (larger than the usual 8½   x 11-inch 
letter size)
 
✓ More than four ink cartridges, for better color rendering 

237

Figure 10-2: The Epson Stylus Photo RX680 is a scanner, copier, 
 
and photo printer that also prints onto CDs and DVDs. 
 
✓ Borderless printing
 
✓ Computer-network connections 
 
✓ Wireless Bluetooth connections 
 
✓ Printing directly from a camera or memory card
 
✓ Built-in monitors that you can use to preview your pictures
 
✓ Integrated fax, copier, and scanner 
Most inkjet printers enable you to print on plain paper or thicker (and more 
expensive) photographic stock, either with a glossy or matte finish. That 
flexibility is great because you can print rough drafts and everyday work on 
plain paper and save the more costly photographic stock for final prints and 
important projects. 
The downside? Well, you’ve no doubt discovered this for yourself: Although 
most inkjet printers themselves are inexpensive, printing is not necessarily 
cheap because the inks they use can be pretty pricey. And inkjet printer man-
ufacturers will almost always tell you that you need to use their own brand of 
ink instead of less-costly third-party inks. 

238
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Another option is to have your inkjet cartridges professionally refilled at a 
local store; this service is becoming common, especially in large metropoli-
tan areas. The vendors guarantee the quality of the ink, and if you don’t like 
the results, you have a place you can go to with your prints to get help. 
 
Either way, using a third-party, aftermarket brand of ink, while less expensive 
and sometimes perfectly adequate, can potentially produce unsatisfactory 
results and, worse yet, can invalidate your warranty. So beware before buying 
a bunch of cheap inkjet cartridges, and do your homework by researching the 
topic to see what other users of your printer have experienced. And do stop 
to consider that printer manufacturers spend lots of research time and money 
developing ink formulas that best mesh with their printers’ ink delivery systems 
and with various papers, including those they manufacture and sell themselves. 
So it does make sense that the media offered by the manufacturer — both inks 
and papers — would stand the best chance of producing optimum results.
All that said, inkjets are the best option for most digital photographers. The 
exception is if you have high-volume printing needs or care as much about 
regular document printing as photo printing. If that describes you, check out 
laser printers, too, described next. And if you’re interested only in printing 
snapshot photos — perhaps you already have a printer for outputting letters 
and other documents — the upcoming section about dye-sub printers may 
also be of interest.
Laser printers
 
Laser printers use a technology similar to that used in photocopiers. You 
probably don’t care to know the details, so here’s the general idea: The 
process involves a laser beam, which produces electric charges on a drum, 
which rolls toner — the ink, if you will — onto the paper. Heat is applied to 
the page to permanently affix the toner to the page.
The upsides to laser printers include:
 
✓ Color lasers can produce near-photographic quality images as well as 
excellent text. 
 
✓ They’re faster than inkjets. 
 
✓ You can use plain paper or special photo paper, just as with an inkjet 
(although you get better results if you use a high-grade laser paper as 
opposed to cheap copier paper).

239
 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
 
✓ Although you may pay more up front for a laser printer than for an 
inkjet, you should save money over time because the price of toner is 
usually lower than for inkjet ink. 
 
✓ Many color lasers are designed for high-volume, networked printing, 
making them attractive to offices where several people share the same 
printer.
The downsides? 
 
✓ Although they’ve become much more affordable over the past two 
years, color lasers still run $150 and up, with a much higher average 
price than inkjet printers (although prices are still going down). 
 
✓ These printers tend to be big in stature as well as price — this typically 
isn’t a machine that you want to use in a small home office that’s tucked 
into a corner of your kitchen.
 
✓ Most laser printers don’t have the digital-photography niceties found in 
many inkjets: memory-card slots, monitors for viewing photos on your 
cards, and the like. However, this situation is starting to change, with a 
few lasers now offering these and other photo-printing features.
As for photo quality, it varies from machine to machine, so be sure to read 
reviews carefully. Some laser-printed photos aren’t quite as impressive as 
those from the best inkjets, but some new models come very close. Many 
people can’t tell the difference between an inkjet and laser print. Figure 10-3 
offers an example of a color laser printer from Konica Minolta.

Figure 10-3: Color lasers are now very affordable 
 
and can produce good photo prints.

Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
Dye-sub (thermal dye) printers
A third type of printer you may encounter, although it’s not nearly as 
common as inkjets and laser printers, is called a dye-sub printer.
Dye-sub is short for dye-sublimation, which is worth remembering only for 
the purpose of one-upping the science-fair winner who lives down the street. 
Dye-sub printers transfer images to paper using a plastic film or ribbon that’s 
coated with colored dyes. During the printing process, heating elements 
move across the film, causing the dye to fuse to the paper.
 
Dye-sub printers are also called thermal-dye printers — heated (thermal) 
dye . . . get it?
Some popular snapshot printers, including certain models from Kodak, use 
this technology. Dye-sub printers fall within the same price range as quality 
inkjets, and most produce good-looking prints.
However, dye-sub machines present a few disadvantages that may make 
them less appropriate as your primary home or office printer:
 
✓ Most dye-sub printers can output only snapshot size prints.
 
✓ You have to use special stock designed to work expressly with dye-sub 
printers. (Typically, you buy a printing pack that includes both the req-
uisite paper and the dye film or ribbon.) That means that dye-sub print-
ers aren’t appropriate for general-purpose documents; these machines 
are purely photographic tools.
 
✓ Printing can be slower than with an inkjet or laser because the paper has 
to pass through the printer’s innards several times, once for each color 
of dye and, usually, a final pass for the application of a clear overcoat.
More printer-shopping tips 
After narrowing down what type and size of printer you need, a few addi-
tional shopping tips can help you pick the right product off the store shelves:
 
✓ Don’t spend on extras you won’t use. Decide whether you really need 
all the bells and whistles found on some new printers. For example, 
some will print directly onto a CD or DVD (although you need special 
but commonly available CDs or DVDs that accept inkjet ink printing), 
print from a wireless Bluetooth connection, or let you print directly from 
a memory card. These features may be handy for you, but if you don’t 
need them, they will also make a printer more expensive than a similar-
quality model without the extra whiz-bang features.

241
 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
 
✓ Don’t worry too much about the specification known as dpi. This 
abbreviation stands for dots per inch and refers to the number of dots of 
color the printer can create per linear inch. A higher dpi means a smaller 
printer dot, and the smaller the dot, the harder it is for the human eye 
to notice that the image is made up of dots. So in theory, a higher dpi 
should mean better-looking images. But because different types of print-
ers create images differently, an image output at 300 dpi on one printer 
may look considerably better than an image output at the same or even 
higher dpi on another printer. And frankly, any new printer you buy 
today is probably going to offer enough resolution to produce print 
quality that’s plenty good. So although printer manufacturers make a big 
deal about their printers’ resolutions, dpi isn’t always a reliable measure 
of print quality.
 
✓ For inkjets, look for a model that uses four or more colors. Most inkjets 
print using four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. This ink combi-
nation is known as CMYK (see the sidebar “The separate world of CMYK,” 
later in this chapter). But some lower-end inkjets eliminate the black 
Protecting your prints
No matter what the type of print, you can help 
keep its colors bright and true by adhering to 
the following storage and display guidelines:
 ✓ If you’re framing the photo, mount it behind 
a matte to prevent the print from touching 
the glass. Be sure to use acid-free, archival 
matte board and UV-protective glass.
 ✓ Display the picture in a location where it 
isn’t exposed to strong sunlight or fluores-
cent light for long periods of time.
 ✓ In photo albums, slip pictures inside acid-
free, archival sleeves.
 ✓ Don’t adhere prints to a matte board or 
other surface using masking tape, scotch 
tape, or other household products. Instead, 
use acid-free mounting materials, sold in 
art-supply stores and some craft stores. 
And don’t write on the back of the print with 
anything but a pen made for printing on 
photographs. 
 ✓ Limit exposure to humidity, wide tempera-
ture swings, cigarette smoke, and other 
airborne pollutants, as these can also con-
tribute to image degradation. You can do 
this by having a framer “seal” the photo into 
a frame.
 ✓ Although the refrigerator door is a popular 
spot to hang favorite photos, it’s probably 
the worst location in terms of print longev-
ity. Unless protected by a frame, the photo 
paper soaks up all the grease and dirt from 
your kitchen, not to mention jelly-smudged 
fingerprints and other telltale signs left 
when people open and close the door.
 ✓ For the ultimate protection, always keep a 
copy of the image file on a CD-R, DVD-R, or 
other storage medium so that you can output 
a new print if the original one deteriorates. 
See Chapter 9 for advice on archiving your 
digital files.

242
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
ink and just combine cyan, magenta, and yellow to approximate black. 
“Approximate” is the key word — you don’t get good, solid blacks without 
that black ink, so for best color quality, avoid three-color printers. 
 
 Some high-end photo inkjets feature six or more ink colors, adding 
lighter shades of the primary colors or several shades of gray to the 
standard CMYK mix. The extra inks expand the range of colors that the 
printer can manufacture, resulting in more accurate color rendition, but 
add to the print cost. 
 
 If you enjoy making black-and-white prints — grayscale prints, in official 
digital-imaging lingo — look for a printer that adds the extra gray car-
tridges. Some printers that use only one black cartridge have a difficult 
time outputting truly neutral grays — prints often have a slight color 
tint. Browse magazines that cover black-and-white photography for 
leads on the best machines for this type of printing.
 
✓ Inkjets that use separate cartridges for each color save you money. 
On models that have just one cartridge for all inks, you usually end up 
throwing away some ink because one color often becomes depleted 
before the others. With multiple ink cartridges, you just replace the ones 
that are running out.
 
 A few printers require special cartridges for printing in photographic-
quality mode. These cartridges are normally more expensive than stan-
dard inks. So when you compare output from different printers, find out 
whether the images were printed with the standard ink setup or with 
more expensive photographic inks.
 
 In some cases, these cartridges lay down a clear overcoat over the 
printed image. The overcoat gives the image a glossy appearance when 
printed on plain paper and also helps protect the ink from smearing and 
fading. In other cases, you put in a cartridge that enables you to print 
with more colors than usual — for example, if the printer usually prints 
using four inks, you may insert a special photo cartridge that enables 
you to print using six inks. 
 
✓ Compare print speeds if you’re a frequent printer. If you use your 
printer for business purposes and you print a lot of images, be sure that 
the printer you pick can output images at a decent speed. And be sure 
to find out the per-page print speed for printing at the printer’s highest 
quality setting. Most manufacturers list print speeds for the lowest-
quality or draft-mode printing. When you see claims like “Prints at 
speeds up to . . . ,” you know you’re seeing the speed for the lowest-
quality print setting.

243
 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
The separate world of CMYK
As you know if you read Chapter 4, on-screen 
images are RGB images. RGB images are cre-
ated by combining red, green, and blue light. 
Your digital camera and scanner also produce 
RGB images. Professional printing presses and 
most, but not all, consumer printers, on the 
other hand, create images by mixing four colors 
of ink — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. 
Pictures created using these four colors are 
called CMYK images. (The K is used instead of 
B because black is called the key color in CMYK 
printing.)
You may be wondering why four primary colors 
are needed to produce colors in a printed image, 
while only three are needed for RGB images. 
(Okay, you’re probably not wondering that at 
all, but go with it, will you?) The answer is that 
unlike light, inks are impure. Black is needed to 
help ensure that black portions of an image are 
truly black, not some muddy gray, as well as to 
account for slight color variations between inks 
produced by different vendors.
What does all this CMYK stuff mean to you? First, 
if you’re shopping for an inkjet printer, be aware 
that some models print using only three inks, 
leaving out the black. Color rendition is usually 
worse on models that omit the black ink.
Second, if you’re sending your image to a ser-
vice bureau for printing, you may need to convert 
your image to the CMYK color mode and create 
color separations. If you read  Chapter 4, you may 
recall that CMYK images comprise four color 
channels — one each for the cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black image information. Color 
separations are nothing more than grayscale 
printouts of each color channel. During the 
printing process, your printer combines the sep-
arations to create the full-color image. If you’re 
not comfortable doing the CMYK conversion 
and color separations yourself or your image-
editing software doesn’t offer this capability, 
your service bureau or printer can do the job for 
you. (Be sure to ask the service rep whether you 
should provide RGB or CMYK images, because 
some printers require RGB.)
Don’t convert your images to CMYK for print-
ing on your own printer, however, because 
consumer printers are engineered to work with 
RGB image data. And no matter whether you’re 
printing your own images or having them com-
mercially reproduced, remember that CMYK has 
a smaller gamut than RGB, which is a fancy way 
of saying that you can’t reproduce with inks all 
the colors you can create with RGB. CMYK can’t 
handle the really vibrant, neon colors you see 
on your computer monitor, for example, which is 
why images tend to look a little duller after con-
version to CMYK and why your printed images 
don’t always match your on-screen images.
One more note about CMYK: If you’re shop-
ping for a new inkjet printer, you may see a few 
models described as CcMmYK or CcMmYKk 
printers. Those lowercase letters indicate that 
the printer offers a light cyan, magenta, or black 
ink, respectively, in addition to the traditional 
cyan, magenta, and black cartridges. As men-
tioned earlier, the added inksets are provided 
to expand the range of colors that the printer 
can produce.

244
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
✓ “Computer-free printing” options give you extra flexibility. Some 
printers can print directly from camera memory cards — no computer 
required. Several technologies enable this feature:
 
• Built-in memory card slots: You insert your memory card, use the 
printer’s control panel to set up the print job, and press the Print 
button. Be sure that the printer offers card slots that are compat-
ible with the type of memory card you use, though.
 
• PictBridge: This feature enables you to hook up your camera to 
your printer for direct printing. (Both the camera and the printer 
must offer PictBridge capabilities.)
 
• DPOF (dee-poff): This acronym stands for digital print order format 
and enables you to select the images you want to print through 
your camera’s user interface. The camera records your instruc-
tions on the memory card. Then, if you use a printer that has 
memory card slots, you put the card into a slot, and the printer 
reads and outputs your “print order.” Again, both the camera and 
the printer must offer DPOF technology.
 
• Wireless connections: Manufacturers are offering a number of 
Bluetooth-enabled printers, too. If you use a Bluetooth cell phone 
that has a camera, you can send your pictures from the phone to 
the printer wirelessly.
 
 Of course, direct printing takes away your chance to edit your pictures; 
you may be able to use camera or printer settings to make minor changes, 
such as rotating the image, making the picture brighter, or applying a 
prefab frame design, but that’s all. Direct printing is great on occasions 
where print immediacy is more important than image perfection, how-
ever. For example, a real-estate agent taking a client for a site visit can 
shoot pictures of the house and output prints in a flash so that the client 
can take pictures home that day.
 
✓ Research independent sources for cost-per-printer information. 
Consumer magazines and computer publications often publish articles 
that compare current printer models based on cost per print. Some print-
ers do use more expensive media than others, so if you’re having trouble 
deciding between several similar models, this information could help you 
make the call. Note that some printer ads and brochures also state a cost 
per print, but the numbers you see are approximations at best and are 
calculated in a fashion designed to make the use costs appear as low as 
possible. As they say in the car ads, your actual mileage may vary.
 
✓ Read reviews and blog comments for other input, too. Once again, it 
pays to check out reviews in magazines and online sites to find detailed 
reviews about print quality and other printer features. You also can 
get lots of good real-world information by searching out blogs and user 
forums where people discuss their experiences with models that you’re 
considering.

 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
Choosing Photo Paper
With photo paper, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for. The 
better the paper, the more your images will look like traditional print pho-
tographs. In fact, if you want to upgrade the quality of your images, simply 
changing the paper stock can do wonders.
If your printer can accept different stocks, print drafts of your images on the 
cheaper stocks, and reserve the good stuff for final output. “Good stuff,” by 
the way, means photographic paper from a well-known manufacturer, not the 
cheap store brands. Start with paper from the manufacturer of your printer 
because that paper is specifically engineered to work with your printer’s 
inks. The prints you make with that paper can give you a baseline from which 
you can compare results on other brands.
 
Don’t limit yourself to printing images on standard photo paper, though. You 
can buy special paper kits that enable you to put images on calendars, stick-
ers, greeting cards, window decals, transparencies (for use in overhead pro-
jectors), and all sorts of other stuff. Some printers even offer accessory kits 
for printing your photos on coffee mugs and t-shirts. And if you use an inkjet 
printer, try out some of the new textured papers, which have surfaces that 
mimic traditional watercolor paper, canvas, and the like.
Setting Print Size and Resolution
As mentioned several times earlier in this chapter, many printers enable you 
to output prints right from a memory card or from the camera. If you’re going 
that route, just follow the instructions in your printer manual. There’s really 
not much to do in advance of printing except specify the size of the print and 
the number of copies, which you do either via your camera menus or buttons 
on the printer. 
Many photo-editing programs also offer simplified printing, providing wizards 
that ask you to set only print size and other basics. If you like the results you 
get from these automated printing utilities, great. But keep in mind that when 
you set the print size this way, you let the printer software or your imaging 
software make the all-important resolution decision for you.
 
Chapter 4 explains this issue fully, but here’s a quick recap: 
 
✓ Resolution — pixels per inch — has a major impact on print quality. 
To do their best work, most printers need 200 to 300 pixels per inch. 
If you’re having your picture output at a professional lab, you may be 
required to submit the file at a specific resolution.

246
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
✓ When you enlarge an image, one of two things happens: The resolu-
tion goes down and the pixel size increases, or the software adds new 
pixels to fill the enlarged image area (a process called resampling). Both 
options can result in a loss of image quality.
 
✓ To figure out the maximum size at which you can print your image at 
a desired resolution, divide the horizontal pixel count (the number of 
pixels across) by the desired resolution. The result gives you the maxi-
mum print width (in inches). To determine the maximum print height, 
divide the vertical pixel count by the desired resolution.
 
✓ What if you don’t have enough pixels to get both the print size and reso-
lution you want? Well, you have to choose which is more important. If 
you absolutely need a certain print size, you just have to sacrifice some 
image quality and accept a lower resolution. And if you absolutely need 
a certain resolution, you have to live with a smaller image. Hey, life’s full 
of compromises, right?
Again, if you’re happy with the prints you get when you go the automatic 
route, that’s terrific. Some print utilities offer guidance as to how large you 
can print your picture without losing quality; pay attention to those on-
screen messages, and you’ll be fine.
 
But if you do want to take control over output resolution, you must set the 
print size and resolution before you send the image to the printer. Here’s how 
to do the job in Elements:
 
1. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
 
 The Image Size dialog box shown in Figure 10-4 appears.
 
2. Turn off the Resample Image check box.
 
 This option controls whether the program can add or delete pixels as 
you change the print dimensions. When the option is turned off, the 
number of pixels can’t be altered.
 
 Click the box to toggle the option on and off. An empty box means that 
the option is turned off, which is what you want in this case.
 
3. Enter the print dimensions or resolution.
 
 Enter the print dimensions in the Width or Height boxes; as you change 
one value, the other changes automatically to retain the original pro-
portions of the picture. Likewise, as you change the dimensions, the 
Resolution value changes automatically. If you prefer, you can change 
the Resolution value, in which case the program alters the Width and 
Height values accordingly.

247
 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
 
 
Figure 10-4: Set print size and output resolution (ppi) in the Image 
 
Size dialog box.
 
 If you want your picture to print at a traditional photo size — say, 4 x 6 
inches or 5 x 7 inches — you need to crop it to those proportions before 
you set the image size, depending on the proportions of your original 
digital image. Many cameras produce images that have a 4:3 aspect 
ratio, for example, which means that the entire image can’t fit a 4 x 6 
print size, which has an aspect ratio of 3:2. See Chapter 9 for help with 
cropping.
 
 Also note that for good print quality, you should strive for a resolution 
between 200 and 300. But you usually don’t have to be dead-on with 
any particular resolution unless you’re sending your photo to a lab that 
requires a specific value. (See the notes following these steps for details 
on how to handle that situation.)
 
4. Click OK or press Enter.
 
 If you did things correctly — that is, deselected the Resample Image 
check box in Step 2 — you shouldn’t see any change in your image on-
screen, because you still have the same number of pixels to display. 
However, if you choose View➪Rulers, which displays rulers along the 
top and left side of your image, you can see that the image will, in fact, 
print at the dimensions you specified.

248
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
5. If you want to retain the current settings after you close the image, 
save the file.
 
 Chapter 9 explains the process of saving files.
Now about that situation mentioned in Step 3: If you are sending your photo 
to a lab or for some other reason need to resample the image in order to 
achieve a certain print resolution, select the Resample Image check box. 
(Click the box so that a check mark appears inside.) Turn on the Constrain 
Proportions box and the Scale Styles box, if it’s available. Then set your 
desired Width, Height, and Resolution values.
When the Resample Image option is enabled, a second set of Width and 
Height boxes becomes available at the top of the dialog box. Use these 
options if you want to set your photo dimensions using pixels or percent (of 
the original dimensions) as the unit of measure.
 
After resampling, be sure to save your image with a new name. You may want 
the image at the original pixel count some day.
If you’re using another photo editor, be sure to consult the program’s Help 
system or manual for information on resizing options available to you. 
Advanced photo-editing programs such as Elements offer you the option of 
controlling resolution as you resize, but some entry-level programs don’t. 
Instead, these programs automatically resample the image any time you 
resize it, so be careful.
 
How can you tell if a program is resampling images upon resizing? Check the 
“before” and “after” size of the image file. If the file size changes when you 
resize the image, the program is resampling the photo. (Adding or deleting 
pixels increases or reduces the file size.)
Sending Your Image to the Printer
Printing from your photo-editing or cataloging software is similar to printing 
a file in any computer program. Here’s the general overview: 
 
1. Open the photo file.
 
2. Set the image size and resolution as discussed in the preceding 
section.
 
 If your photo software doesn’t offer this capability, you can probably set 
the print size through the Printer dialog box, later in the steps. Setting 
the image size and resolution in the way discussed in the preceding 
 section is a “best practices” type of thing, however. 

249
 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
 
3. Choose the Print command.
 
 In almost every program on the planet, the Print command resides on 
the File menu. Choosing the command results in a dialog box through 
which you can change the print settings, including the printer resolu-
tion or print quality and the number of copies you want to print. You 
can also specify whether you want to print in portrait mode, which prints 
your image in an upright position, or landscape mode, which prints 
your image sideways on the page. Figure 10-5 shows the dialog box that 
appears when you choose the Print command in Elements.
 
4. Specify the print options you want to use.
 
 The available options — and the manner in which you access those 
options — vary widely depending on the type of printer you’re using and 
whether you’re working on a PC or a Mac. 
 
 Please read your printer’s manual for information on what settings to 
use in what scenarios, and, for heaven’s sake, follow the instructions. 
Otherwise, you aren’t going to get the best possible images your printer 
can deliver.
 
 
Figure 10-5: The Elements Print dialog box offers a variety of print settings.

250
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 If you did establish print size and resolution before starting the print 
process, stay away from any options inside the Print dialog box that 
adjust the picture size or resolution, or you undo that work. In Elements, 
leave the Print Size option set to Actual Size, and keep your paws off the 
Scaled Print Size options.
 
5. Send that puppy to the printer.
 
 Look in the dialog box for an OK or Print button and click the button to 
send your image scurrying for the printer.
Getting better results from your printer
With the general printing info under your belt — and with your own printer 
manual close at hand — you’re ready for some more specific tips about 
making hard copies of your images. So here are a few tips that can help you 
get the best output from any printer:
 
✓ Better paper equals better prints. For those special pictures, invest in 
glossy or “luster” photographic stock or some other high-grade option. 
 
✓ When setting up the print job, be sure to choose the right paper set-
tings. If the printer is set to print on matte paper, for example, and you 
instead feed it glossy stock, you might have a smeary mess on your 
hands.
 
✓ Do a test print using different printer-resolution or print-quality set-
tings. This process enables you to determine which settings work best 
for which types of images and which types of paper. The default settings 
selected by the printer’s software may not be the best choices for the 
types of images you print. Be sure to note the appropriate settings so 
that you can refer to them later. Also, some printer software enables you 
to save custom settings so that you don’t have to reset all the controls 
each time you print. Check your printer manual to find out whether your 
printer offers this option.
 
✓ Don’t forget to install the printer driver (software) on your computer. 
Follow the installation instructions closely so that the driver is installed 
in the right folder in your system. Otherwise, your computer can’t com-
municate with your printer. This is usually a matter of following the 
“quick setup” instructions that came with your printer. If you don’t have 
them, you can usually find drive and setup files on the manufacturer’s 
Web site (look for “downloads” and/or “support”). 
 
✓ Use the right printer cable. Most printers connect using a USB cable; if 
your printer didn’t come with one, you can easily get one at a local office 
supply store. There are variations in quality, so don’t just opt for the 
cheapest one. Also, remember that usually a longer cable means less-
ened performance, so try to work with a shorter printer cable, if 
possible.  

251
 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
 
✓ Don’t ignore your printer manual’s instructions regarding routine 
printer maintenance. Print heads can become dirty, inkjet nozzles can 
become clogged, and all sorts of other gremlins can gunk up the works. 
But don’t get obsessive about it, because the cleaning process con-
sumes ink, costing you money as well as time. 
As for the number-one printing complaint — printed colors that look different 
from on-screen colors — move to the next section.
Comparing your monitor to your prints
You may notice a significant color shift between your on-screen and printed 
images. This color shift is due in part to the fact that you simply can’t repro-
duce all RGB colors using printer inks, a problem explained in the sidebar 
“The separate world of CMYK,” earlier in this chapter and in the color section 
in Chapter 4. In addition, the following variables are at work:
 
✓ Brightness of the paper 
 
✓ Purity of the ink 
 
✓ Lighting conditions in which you view the image 
Although perfect color matching is impossible, you can take a few steps to 
bring your printer and monitor colors closer together, as follows:
 
✓ On an inkjet printer, check your ink status. An empty or clogged ink car-
tridge is very often the culprit when colors are seriously off.
 
✓ Changing your paper stock sometimes affects color rendition. Typically, 
the better the paper, the truer the color matching.
 
✓ The software provided with most color printers includes color-matching 
controls designed to get your screen and image colors to jibe. Check 
your printer manual for information on how to access these controls.
 
✓ If playing with the color-matching options doesn’t work, the printer 
software may offer controls that enable you to adjust the image’s color 
balance. When you adjust the color balance using the printer software, 
you don’t make any permanent changes to your image. Again, you need 
to consult your printer manual for information on specific controls and 
how to access and use them.
 
✓ Don’t convert your images to the CMYK color model for printing on a 
consumer printer. These printers are designed to work with RGB images, 
so you get better color matching if you work in the RGB mode.
 
✓ Many image-editing programs also include utilities that are designed 
to assist in the color-matching process. Some of these are very user-
friendly; after printing a sample image, you let the program know which 

252
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
sample most closely matches what you see on-screen. The program then 
calibrates itself automatically using this information.
 
✓ Photoshop Elements, Photoshop, ACDSee, and other advanced image-
editing programs offer more sophisticated color-management options. If 
you’re new to the game, leave these settings in their default positions, as 
the whole topic is a little mind-boggling, and you can just as easily make 
things worse as improve them. Many of the color settings aren’t designed 
to improve matching between your printer and monitor, anyway, but 
to ensure color consistency through a production workflow — that is, 
between different technicians passing an image file along from creation to 
printing. 
 
✓ If your photography work demands more accurate color-matching con-
trols than your printer or photo-editing software delivers, you can invest 
in a color management system, or CMS, for short. Incorporating special 
software and hardware tools, a CMS enables you to calibrate all the dif-
ferent components of your image-processing system — scanner, moni-
tor, and printer — so that colors stay true from machine to machine. 
Among companies offering color-management products for consumers 
are Colorvision (www.colorvision.com) and X-Rite (www.xrite.com).
 
✓ Even if you don’t fully get into color management, you might consider 
picking up a monitor calibration tool. This little bit of hardware, which 
you can buy for about $100, measures the colors and brightness emitted 
by your monitor and then builds a profile that gets passed onto your 
computer, printer, and other imaging devices. In addition to adjusting 
the display to compensate for any inherent color cast it may have, the 
profile helps the other devices more accurately translate the colors in 
your image as they move from camera to monitor to printer. 
 
✓ Finally, remember that the colors you see both on-screen and on paper 
vary depending on the light in which you view them. It is best to do 
this in a room with a limited amount of light shining on your screen. 
Additionally, the color of your clothing and even the surrounding walls 
can reflect off the monitor, causing more color confusion. So you may 
even want to don gray or black clothing when you’re doing color-critical 
work.
Seeing Things in Black and White
While most of the pictures people take today are in color, you can easily 
change them to black and white using an image-editing program. Photoshop 
Elements, for example, has an easy-to-use tool for just this task, shown in 
Figure 10-6. And with many images, such as the photo in Figure 10-6, you may 

253
 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
discover that you like the black-and-white version of some pictures better 
than the color original.
 
Serge Timacheff
 
Figure 10-6: Photoshop Elements makes converting color images to black-and-white easy. 
 
After you do your conversion, save your image with a different filename 
using the Save As option (usually found under the File menu on your editing 
program). This ensures that you will have your original image and your new 
black-and-white version. (See Chapter 9 for help with file-saving and photo-
editing in general.)
Printing your black-and-white images can be a challenge, though, because 
most photo printers are designed more for color printing. So follow these tips 
to get the best reproduction: 
 
✓ A printer that uses two or more shades of black ink as well as the usual 
color inks produces the best results. Epson, Canon, and HP all offer a 
number of dedicated photo printers that use either two or three shades 
of black ink and are capable of printing great looking black-and-white 
prints. These printers are more expensive, however, and can sell for 
$800 and up. 

254
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
✓ Paper matters, too. There are a number of inkjet papers with a variety 
of coatings and textures made specifically for monochrome (black-and-
white) images, and using these products can make a big difference.
 
✓ If you can’t get good results from your own printer, the easiest solution 
is to look for a lab that offers black-and-white printing. Labs that work 
with professional photographers, especially, offer various options, so 
check around — especially if you’re printing an important photo that 
you are going to frame or have around for a long time. 
Publishing Your Own Coffee Table Book
Ever seen a coffee-table-style book of photographs from a wedding? It used 
to be that you had to print copies of the best photos from a wedding or other 
event and then insert them into a leather- or linen-bound fancy book to keep 
as a high-quality showpiece. 
Today, you can do the same thing online by uploading your favorite photos 
from virtually any event or collection and have them printed in a beautiful book 
like the one shown in Figure 10-7. You can have anywhere from a few photos to 
several hundred in a single book. And, as an added bonus, you can even create 
“virtual” copies of the book for sharing online, complete with music.

 Chapter 10: Printing Your Photos
Many companies offer photo printing into books of all sizes and styles, 
including the following:
 
✓ Picaboo (www.picaboo.com)
 
✓ Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com)
 
✓ Lulu (www.lulu.com)
 
✓ Snapfish (www.snapfish.com)
 
✓ Kodak Gallery (www.kodakgallery.com)
You simply create an online account, decide on a design, upload your photos, 
and then use the various templates and layouts provided to create your 
book. 
For something on a smaller scale, you can create a mini album like the one 
shown in Figure 10-8. This product, from ZoomAlbum (www.zoomalbum.net), 
is only 3 inches square — perfect for carrying in your pocket to your next 
supper club or family reunion. You typically can create an album on a single 
sheet of paper (provided with the kit) and your own printer. You then peel 
the photos from a special backing and stick them into the album cover. A kit 
that makes about three albums sells for around $30.

▶ Trimming your file size for faster image downloading
▶ Saving a JPEG file
▶ Viewing pictures on your television
▶ Using digtial photo frames
W
hen you print pictures, you need lots of pixels — a high-resolution 
photo, that is — to get good results. But when you display your 
pictures on-screen, you need very few pixels. Even the most inexpensive, 
low-megapixel, entry-level cameras can deliver enough pixels to create 
acceptable images for Web pages, online photo albums, multi -
media presentations, and other on-screen uses. In some 
cases, a camera-phone image might even be good enough.
The process of preparing your pictures for the screen 
can be a little confusing, however — in part because 
so many people don’t understand the correct approach 
and keep passing along bad advice to newcomers.
This chapter shows you how to do things the right 
way. You find out how to set the display size of on-
screen photos, save the resized photo in the JPEG 
file format, display your image in a digital photo frame, 
send a picture along with an e-mail message, and more.
Step into the Screening Room
With a printed picture, your display options are fairly limited. You can pop 
the thing into a frame or photo album. You can stick it to a refrigerator with 
one of those annoyingly cute refrigerator magnets. Or you can slip it into 
your wallet so that you’re prepared when an acquaintance inquires after you 
and yours.

258
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
In their digital state, however, photos can be displayed in all sorts of new and 
creative ways, including the following:
 
✓ On a Web page: If your company has a Web site, add interest by posting 
product pictures, employee photos, and images of your corporate head-
quarters. Many folks these days even have personal Web pages devoted 
not to selling products but to sharing information about themselves. 
(Your Internet provider may provide you with a free page just for this 
purpose.) And, if you have a teenager, you probably know that Web sites 
like Facebook.com and MySpace.com are all the rage — and very photo-
oriented.
 
 You can even create an online photo gallery — and you don’t need to be an 
experienced Web designer, either, because many photo-editing programs 
provide a wizard that practically automates the process. Figure 11-1 shows 
the wizard provided in Photoshop Elements, for example. Figure 11-2 
offers a look at the finished Web page. See “Nothing but Net: Photos on 
the Web,” later in this chapter, for details on preparing a digital photo for 
use on a Web page.
 
 
 Figure 11-1: Putting together a simple Web gallery is easy, thanks to step-by-step wizards 
provided in many photo-editing and cataloging programs.

259

Figure 11-2: Visitors to your gallery can click a thumbnail to display the image at a larger size.
 
✓ Via e-mail: E-mail a picture to friends, clients, or relatives, who then can 
view the image on their computer screens, save the image file, and even 
edit and print the photo if they like. 
 
✓ On a photo-sharing site: When you have more than a few pictures to 
share, forego e-mail and instead take advantage of photo-sharing sites 
such as 
 
• Kodak Gallery (www.kodakgallery.com)
 
• Phanfare (www.phanfare.com)
 
• PhotoBucket (www.photobucket.com)
 
• Snapfish (www.snapfish.com)
 
• Shutterfly (www.shutterfly.com)

260
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 After uploading pictures, you can invite people to view your album and 
to buy prints of their favorite photos. You generally can create and 
share albums at no charge; the Web sites make a profit through their 
photo-printing services.
 
 Do not rely on photo-sharing sites for archival picture storage, however. 
Many sites delete your pictures if you don’t buy prints within a certain 
amount of time. And some sites that have had glorious beginnings went 
through a bad spell and shut down, taking all their customers’ photos 
with them. See Chapters 2 and 8 for information on how to archive your 
digital files properly.
 
✓ In a multimedia presentation: Import the picture into a multimedia pre-
sentation program such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Corel Presentations. 
The right images, displayed at the right time, can add excitement and 
emotional impact to your presentations and also clarify your ideas. 
Check your presentation program’s manual for specifics on how to add a 
digital photo to your next show.
 
✓ As a screen saver: Create a personalized screen saver featuring your 
favorite images or pick a single image to use as your desktop wallpaper, 
as shown in Figures 11-4 and 11-5, in the next section.
 
✓ As a slide show: Put together a digital slide show using a specialty pro-
gram such as Photodex ProShow Gold (www.photodex.com), shown in 
Figure 11-3. You can burn the show to CD for playback on any computer 
and on some DVD players. Many photo-editing and cataloging programs 
also offer a tool for making slide shows, although they’re usually more 
limited than what you get in a stand-alone program.
 
✓ On TV: With many digital cameras, you can view your photos on a 
TV. You can then show your pictures to a living room full of guests. 
Some new HDTVs also include a computer connection so you can play 
your images directly from your desktop or laptop. For more about this 
option, see the section “Viewing Photos on TV,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ On a digital photo frame: The newest rage for enhancing your living 
room, digital photo frames offer yet another way to display your photo-
graphs. See the last section in this chapter for some tips on these 
products.
Sizing Pictures for Screen Display
Preparing pictures for on-screen display requires a different approach than 
getting them ready for the printer. The following sections tell all.

261
 Chapter 11: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
 
 
Figure 11-3: Programs such as Photodex ProShow Gold make creating digital slide shows easy.
Understanding monitor resolution and picture size
When you prepare pictures for on-screen use, remember that monitors 
display images using one screen pixel for every image pixel. (If you need a 
primer on pixels, flip back to Chapter 4.) The exception is when you’re work-
ing in a photo-editing program or other application that enables you to zoom 
in on a picture, thereby devoting several screen pixels to each image pixel.
Most monitors can be set to a choice of displays, each of which results in a 
different number of screen pixels, or, in common lingo, a different monitor 
resolution. Standard monitor resolution settings include but aren’t limited to
 
✓ 800 x 600 pixels
 
✓ 1024 x 768 pixels

262
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
✓ 1280 x 1024 pixels
 
✓ 1600 x 1200 pixels
The first number always indicates the number of horizontal pixels.
 
To size a screen picture, you simply match the pixel dimensions of the photo 
to the amount of screen real estate that you want the picture to consume. If 
your photo is 1024 x 768 pixels, for example, it consumes the entire screen 
when the monitor resolution is set to 1024 x 768.
At a higher monitor resolution, the same photo no longer fills the screen. A 
higher screen resolution means smaller screen pixels, so everything appears 
smaller — including your photo.
For a clearer idea of how monitor resolution affects the size at which your 
photo appears on-screen, see Figures 11-4 and 11-5. Both examples show an 
800 x 600-pixel digital photo as it appears on a 19-inch monitor. (This exam-
ple was created by using Windows Desktop Properties control to display the 
photo as the desktop background, or wallpaper, in geek speak.) 
 
 
 Figure 11-4: An 800 x 600-pixel digital photo fills the screen when the monitor resolution is set 
to 800 x 600.

263
 Chapter 11: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
 
 
 Figure 11-5: At a monitor resolution of 1600 x 1200, an 800 x 600-pixel photo consumes one-
quarter of the screen.
 
✓ In Figure 11-4, the monitor resolution is 800 x 600. The image fills the 
entire screen (although the Windows taskbar hides a portion of the 
image at the bottom of the frame). 
 
✓ In Figure 11-5, the monitor resolution is 1600 x 1200. The 800 x 600-pixel 
image now eats up one-fourth of the screen. 
Unfortunately, you often don’t have any way to know or control what monitor 
resolution will be in force when your audience views your pictures. Someone 
viewing your Web page in one part of the world may be working on a 19-inch 
monitor set at a resolution of 1920 x 1200, while another someone may be 
working on a 13-inch monitor set at a resolution of 800 x 600. So you just have 
to strike some sort of compromise.
 
For Web and e-mail images, a good practice is to size your photos assuming 
an 800 x 600 monitor resolution — the least common denominator, if you will. 

264
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
If you create an image larger than 800 x 600, people who use a monitor reso-
lution of 800 x 600 have to scroll the display back and forth to see the entire 
photo. Of course, if you’re preparing images for a multimedia presentation 
and you know what monitor resolution you’ll be using, work with that display 
in mind. And if you know that most of your audience has high-resolution 
monitors, then you can size your photos larger. For online use, also keep in 
mind that the Web browser or e-mail window itself takes up some of the 
available screen space.
Creating a screen-sized copy 
of a high-resolution photo
Some digital cameras offer an option that automatically creates two copies 
of each image: one with lots of pixels for making prints, and another that has 
the appropriate number of pixels for e-mail or Web use. But if your camera 
doesn’t offer this feature, you can easily make a resized copy of a photo for 
online sharing. 
 
Here’s how to do the job in Photoshop Elements:
 
1. Save a backup copy of your picture.
 
 In all likelihood, you’re going to trim pixels from your photo for on-
screen display. You may want those original pixels back someday, so 
save a copy of the picture with a different name before you go any 
further. Then you can work on the copied image and know that your 
original is safe and sound.
 
2. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size to display the Image Size 
dialog box.
 
3. Select the Resample Image check box, as shown in Figure 11-6.
 
 This option, when turned on, enables you to resample the picture — that 
is, to add or delete pixels. After you select the option (by clicking the 
check box), the Pixel Dimensions area at the top of the dialog box offers 
a set of Width and Height controls, as shown in the figure. You use these 
controls to add or delete pixels in Step 7.
 
4. Select Bicubic from the drop-down list next to the Resample Image 
option.
 
 The options in this list affect the method the program uses when adding 
and deleting pixels. Bicubic, the default setting, produces the best 
results when you’re trimming pixels.

265
 Chapter 11: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
 
 
Figure 11-6: To delete pixels in Photoshop Elements, select  the 
 
Resample Image check box.
 
5. Select the Constrain Proportions check box, as shown in the figure.
 
 This option makes sure that the original proportions of your picture are 
maintained when you change the pixel count.
 
6. Select the Scale Styles box, if it’s available.
 
7. Using the top set of Width and Height boxes, enter the new pixel 
dimensions for your photo.
 
 Pixel dimensions is just a nerdy way of saying “number of pixels across 
by number of pixels down.”
 
 Before setting the new pixel count, select Pixels as the unit of measure-
ment from the drop-down list next to the Width or Height box. Because 
the Constrain Proportions option is turned on, the Height value auto-
matically changes when you adjust the Width value, and vice versa.
 
8. Click OK or press Enter.
 
 To view your photo at the size it will display on-screen, choose 
View➪Actual Pixels. 

266
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
 Keep in mind that this view setting displays the photo according to your 
current monitor resolution; if displayed on a monitor using a different 
resolution, the photo size will change. For more on this sticky bit of 
business, refer to the preceding section.
 
9. Save the resized photo in the JPEG format.
 
 The upcoming section, “JPEG: The photographer’s friend,” offers specif-
ics on this step. If your original image was in the JPEG format, be sure to 
give the resized copy a new name so that you don’t overwrite the origi-
nal file.
The steps for resizing a photo in other programs should be similar. For 
specifics, check your software’s Help system for information about how to 
resample pictures. Your software may even offer a wizard that automates the 
process of downsampling a picture and sending it via e-mail.
 
Whatever program you use to resample your photos, remember that the 
more pixels you have, the larger the image file. If you’re preparing photos for 
the Web, file size is a special consideration because larger files take longer 
to download than smaller files. If your images are too large, your site may 
never get seen by impatient Web surfers because they will give up quickly on 
downloading your Web page. See the section “Nothing but Net: Photos on the 
Web” for more information about preparing images for use on Web pages.
Sizing screen images in inches
Newcomers to digital photography often have trouble sizing images in terms 
of pixels and prefer to rely on inches as the unit of measurement. And some 
photo-editing programs don’t offer pixels as a unit of measurement in their 
image-size dialog boxes.
If you can’t resize your picture using pixels as the unit of measurement or 
you prefer to work in inches, do this:
 
1. Set the image width and height as usual. 
 
2. Set the output resolution to 72 or 96 ppi. 
 
 In Photoshop Elements, follow the same steps as outlined in the pre-
ceding section, but set the picture size and output resolution using the 
Width, Height, and Resolution boxes in the Document Size section of the 
Image Size dialog box.

267
 Chapter 11: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
 
Where do these 72 and 96 ppi figures come from? They are based on default 
monitor resolution settings on Macintosh and PC monitors. Mac monitors 
usually leave the factory with a monitor resolution that results in about 72 
screen pixels per linear inch of the viewable area of the screen. PC monitors 
are set to a resolution that results in about 96 pixels for each linear inch of 
screen. So if you have a 1 x 1-inch picture and set the output resolution to 72 
ppi, for example, you wind up with enough pixels to fill an area that’s 1-inch 
square on a Macintosh monitor.
 
Note that this approach is pretty unreliable because of the wide range of 
monitor sizes and available monitor resolution settings — the latter of which 
the user can change at any time, thereby blowing the 72/96 ppi guideline out 
of the water. For more precise on-screen sizing, the method described in the 
preceding section is the way to go.
Nothing but Net: Photos on the Web
If your company operates a Web site or you maintain a personal Web site, 
you can easily place pictures from your digital camera onto your Web pages.
Without knowing what Web-page creation program you’re using, providing 
specifics on the commands and tools you use to add photos to your pages 
isn’t possible. But the next few sections offer some advice on a general artis-
tic and technical level.
Following basic Web rules 
If you want your Web site to be one that people love to visit, take care when 
adding photos (and other graphics, for that matter). Too many images or 
images that are too big quickly turn off viewers, especially viewers with slow 
dialup connections. Every second that people have to wait for a picture to 
download brings them a second closer to giving up and moving on from your 
site.
 
To make sure that you attract, not irritate, visitors to your Web site, keep 
these nuggets of information in mind:

268
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
✓ For business Web sites, make sure that every image you add is neces-
sary. Don’t junk up your page with lots of pretty pictures that do noth-
ing to convey the message of your Web page — in other words, images 
that are pure decoration. These kinds of images waste the viewer’s time 
and cause people to click away from your site in frustration.
 
✓ If you use a picture as a hyperlink, also provide a text-based link. (A 
hyperlink, in case you’re new to the Internet, is a graphic or bit of text 
that you click to travel to another Web page.) This suggestion applies 
whether you use a single image as a link or combine several images into 
a multi-link graphic, or image map. Why the need for both image and 
text links? Because many people with slow Internet connections set their 
browsers so that images do not automatically download. Images appear 
as tiny icons that the viewer can click to display the entire image. This 
setup reduces the time required for a Web page to load. But without 
those text links, people can’t navigate your site unless they take the time 
to load each image.
 
✓ Save Web-bound photos in the JPEG file format. This format produces 
the best-looking on-screen pictures, and all Web browsers can display 
JPEG files. PNG (pronounced ping) is a less-common image standard on 
the Web, and JPEG 2000 is a newer version of JPEG that has yet to be 
adopted and put into use.
 
✓ Don’t save photos in the GIF or TIFF format. If you’re familiar with 
Web design, you may be wondering about using the GIF format for your 
online photos. GIF, which stands for Graphics Interchange Format, is 
a great format for small graphics, such as logos. But it’s not good for 
photos because a GIF image can contain only 256 colors. As a result, 
photos can turn splotchy when saved to this format, as illustrated by 
Figure 11-7. And the TIFF format, although great for printing, produces 
files that are too large for Web use and can’t be displayed in Web 
browsers.
 
 People argue about whether to say jiff, as in jiffy, or gif, with a hard g. We 
go with jiff because our research turned up evidence that the creators of 
the format intended that pronunciation. But it doesn’t matter how you 
say GIF as long as you remember not to use it for your Web photos. 
 
✓ Understand how pixel count affects display size. Set the display size of 
your photos following the guidelines discussed earlier in “Sizing Pictures 
for Screen Display.” To accommodate the widest range of viewers, size 
your images with respect to a screen display of 800 x 600 pixels. Don’t 
forget that the Web browser or e-mail program needs part of the avail-
able screen space. For e-mail pictures, a maximum image width of 450 
pixels and a maximum height of 400 pixels are good guidelines.
 
 Note that with this low pixel count, people can’t make a decent print 
from your pictures. Consider using a photo-sharing Web site instead of 
e-mail if you want people to have the option of printing your photos.

269
 Chapter 11: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
 
 
Figure 11-7: For better-looking Web photos, use the JPEG file format (top). GIF images can 
 
contain only 256 colors, which can leave photos looking splotchy (bottom).
 
✓ File size determines how long it takes other people to download your 
pictures. It also determines how long you sit and wait for pictures to 
make it from your computer to the Web. If you need to send someone 
high-resolution images for printing, you can either mail the images on a 
CD or use a specialized Web application designed to upload, store, and 
distribute large files, such as the Online File Folder from GoDaddy.com.
 
✓ Pixel count, not ppi, determines file size. File size is determined by the 
total number of pixels in the image, not the output resolution (pixels per 
inch, or ppi). The file size of an 800 x 600-pixel image is the same at 72 
ppi as it is at 300 ppi. Check out Chapter 4 for a more detailed explana-
tion of all this file-size, pixel-count, and output resolution stuff.
 
✓ Increasing the amount of JPEG compression is another way to reduce 
file size. The next section explains this option.

270
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
 
✓ If you want to control the use of your photos, think twice about 
posting them online. Remember, anyone who visits your page can 
download, save, edit, print, and distribute your image — without 
your knowledge or approval unless you have a way of protecting your 
images online (provided by some online photo gallery services, such 
as Printroom.com). To prevent unauthorized use of your pictures, you 
may want to investigate digital watermarking and copyright protection 
services. To start learning about such products, visit the Web site of one 
of the leading providers, Digimarc (www.digimarc.com). The Web site 
operated by the organization Professional Photographers of America 
(www.ppa.com) provides good background information on copyright 
issues in general. Many image-editing programs also let you add a water-
mark to your photos (such as your name or a logo) to protect them.
JPEG: The photographer’s friend
JPEG (jay-peg) is the standard format used by digital cameras to store picture 
files. If you don’t need to resize your JPEG originals, you can share them via 
e-mail or post them on a Web page immediately. All Web browsers and e-mail 
programs can display JPEG photos.
Chances are, though, that your originals are too large for on-screen use, which 
means that you need to dump some pixels, following the instructions earlier 
in this chapter. After you take that step — or do any other photo editing — 
you must resave the file in the JPEG format before sharing it online. 
 
When you save a file in the JPEG format, the picture undergoes lossy compres-
sion. This feature creates smaller file sizes by dumping some image data, which 
can reduce picture quality. (Chapter 4 offers an illustration.) The greater the 
level of compression, the worse the picture appears. In most programs, you 
can specify the amount of compression you want when you save your 
JPEG file. 
 
The following steps show you how to use the Photoshop Elements Save 
for Web utility to save your picture in the JPEG format. Using this feature 
enables you to see how much damage your picture will suffer at various 
levels of JPEG compression. If you’re using another image editor, check the 
Help system for the exact commands to use to save to JPEG. The available 
JPEG options should be much the same as described here, although you may 
or may not be able to preview the compression effects on your picture.
 
1. Choose File➪Save for Web to display the Save for Web dialog box, 
shown in Figure 11-8.
 
 The preview on the left side of the dialog box shows your original pic-
ture; the right-side preview shows how your photo will look when saved 
at the current settings.

271
 Chapter 11: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
 
2. Select JPEG from the Format drop-down list, labeled in Figure 11-8.
 
 After you select JPEG, you see the other save options shown in the 
figure.
 
3. Set the compression amount by using the Quality controls labeled in 
the figure.
 
 A higher Quality setting results in less compression and a larger file.
 
 The Quality drop-down list offers five general settings:
 
• Maximum (provides the best picture quality/least compression)
 
• Very High
 
• High
 
• Medium
 
• Low (provides the least quality/most compression)
Would you like that picture all 
at once, or bit by bit?
When you save a picture in the JPEG format 
inside a photo editor, you usually encounter 
an option that enables you to specify whether 
you want to create a progressive image. This 
feature determines how the picture loads on a 
Web page.
With a progressive JPEG, a faint representa-
tion of your image appears as soon as the initial 
image data makes its way through the view-
er’s modem. As more and more image data is 
received, the picture details are filled in bit by 
bit. With nonprogressive images, no part of your 
image appears until all image data is received.
Progressive images create the perception that 
the image is being loaded faster because the 
viewer has something to look at sooner. This 
type of photo also enables Web-site visitors to 
decide more quickly whether the image is of 
interest to them and, if not, to move on before 
the image download is complete.
However, progressive images take longer to 
download fully, and some Web browsers don’t 
handle them well. In addition, progressive 
JPEGs require more RAM (system memory) 
to view. For these reasons, most Web design 
experts recommend that you don’t use progres-
sive images on your Web pages.
If you decide to go with the GIF format instead 
of JPEG, by the way, you encounter an option 
called interlacing, which has the same result as 
a progressive JPEG. For reasons illustrated in 
this chapter (refer to Figure 11-7), you shouldn’t 
really use GIF for photos, but if you do, don’t 
create interlaced files.

Quality options
Click to open Preview menu
Figure 11-8: The Quality settings determine how much compression is applied.
 
 If you want to get a little more specific, use the Quality slider on the 
right. You can specify any Quality value from 0 to 100, with 0 giving 
you the lowest image quality (maximum compression) and 100 the best 
image quality (least compression).
 
 When you adjust either control, the right preview in the dialog box 
updates to show you the effect on your photo. Beneath the preview, 
the program displays the approximate file size and download time at a 
specific modem speed. To specify the modem speed, open the Preview 
menu by clicking the button labeled in Figure 11-8.
 
4. Deselect the Progressive and ICC Profile check boxes.
 
 If you see a check mark in a box, click the box to remove the check mark 
and turn off the option. Progressive JPEG files aren’t a good idea (for 

273
 Chapter 11: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
reasons discussed in the “Would you like that picture all at once, or bit 
by bit?” sidebar). The ICC Profile option concerns some color manage-
ment issues that professional imaging folks may want to investigate, but 
us ordinary mortals don’t need to worry about. In addition, the option 
adds to the file size.
 
5. If your picture contains transparent areas, choose a Matte color.
 
 This feature comes into play only if you’re using some advanced 
Elements features (namely, a multi-layered image that has transparent 
areas on the bottom layer). So you can ignore it if that doesn’t fit your 
scenario.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The Save for Web dialog box disappears, and the Save Optimized As 
dialog box comes to life. This dialog box works like any file-saving dialog 
box. Just give your picture a filename and specify where you want to 
store the file. The correct file format is already selected for you.
 
 If the original picture file was captured in the JPEG format, be sure to give 
your Web version a different name, or you overwrite the original image.
 
7. Click Save or press Enter.
 
 The program saves the JPEG copy of your picture. Your original photo 
remains open and on-screen. If you want to see the new JPEG version, 
you have to open that file.
 
You can actually adjust the pixel count in the Save for Web dialog box as 
well, so you can resize and save your original image in the JPEG format all 
in one step if you choose. Make the pixel count change using the Image Size 
area of the dialog box. First, select the Constrain Proportions box and enter 
either the new pixel width or height. Then click the Apply button to dump 
those unneeded pixels. From that point, just follow the preceding steps to set 
the JPEG file-saving options.
Viewing Photos on TV
Want to share your photos with a group of people? You may be able to dis-
play those photos on your TV, which is a great alternative to passing around 
your camera or having everyone huddle around your computer monitor.
Displaying your photos on a television also can help you get a better look at 
your pictures than you can on your camera monitor or even your computer 
monitor, especially if your computer sports a smallish monitor. Small defects 
that may not be noticeable on a small screen become readily apparent when 
viewed on a 27-inch television screen.

274
Part III: From Camera to Computer and Beyond 
You can get those photos up on the “big screen” in a number of ways:
 
✓ Memory card slots: Some TVs and DVD players offer memory card 
slots that accept the most popular types of camera memory cards. You 
can then just pop the card out of the camera and into the slot. Some 
DVR (digital video recorder) and VCR units also offer card slots. If your 
equipment doesn’t have such slots, you can buy stand-alone card read-
ers made especially for this purpose.
 
 Most television devices can’t display Raw images, however; your photos 
must be in the standard JPEG format to work. Some stand-alone reader 
units can display Raw files, however. (See Chapter 4 for a description of 
Raw and JPEG.)
 
✓ Video-in/video-out ports: If your camera has a video-out port, you can 
connect it with a video cable to the video-in port on your TV (or DVD or 
whatever), as shown in Figure 11-9. Then you turn on the camera and 
navigate through your pictures using the camera’s own playback controls.
 
 
Figure 11-9: You can connect some cameras to a TV for picture playback.

275
 Chapter 11: On-Screen, Mr. Sulu!
 
 Most digital cameras sold in North America output video in NTSC 
format, which is the video format used by televisions in North America. 
You can’t display NTSC images on televisions in Europe and other coun-
tries that use the PAL format instead of NTSC. So if you’re an interna-
tional business mogul needing to display your images abroad, you may 
not be able to do it using your camera’s video-out feature. Some newer 
cameras do provide you with the choice of NTSC or PAL formats.
 
✓ USB connection: A few new TV and video devices even have a USB port. 
This enables you to connect your camera for picture playback or hook 
the TV to your computer and access pictures stored on your hard drive 
(or other computer storage device).
 
✓ DVD playback: If you can’t get your pictures onto the TV via any of the 
above routes, you can always create a video DVD of your pictures; many 
photo programs and slide-show programs offer tools to help you do this. 
Then you can just pop the DVD into your DVD player for playback. (Check 
your DVD player’s manual to find out what format of DVD recordings it 
accepts, and make sure that you burn the DVD using that specification.)
For all these viewing options, you need to track down the manual for your 
television, DVD player, or whatever device you’re using to get the pictures to 
the screen to find specifics on how to proceed from here. You may need to 
set the device’s input signal to a special auxiliary input mode or use certain 
buttons on your remote controls to initiate and control picture playback.
Digital Photo Frames
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could have all your best photos displayed in your 
living room or office, but without having to print and frame all of them? A dig-
ital photo frame allows you to do just that, by providing a framed LCD screen 
that displays photos without needing to be connected to a computer.
Frames come in a variety of sizes and styles, ranging from 6-inch screens to 
15 inches and larger. And, just like regular photo frames, they come with vari-
ous frame styles, as well, such as wood finishes, white, black, and so on. The 
photos are displayed in a slide show format on the digital photo frame.
Although there are a few variations, most frames have a slot into which you 
put your camera’s memory card, as shown in Figure 11-10. The figure features 
a frame from Smartparts (www.smartparts.com). Some frames also offer USB 
ports, in which case you can connect your camera or some portable hard 
drives.

Figure 11-10: Digital photo frames offer a fun new way to display your pictures.
Some frames require that you size your photos ahead of time; newer models 
automatically resize your images for you. Many frames even have speakers 
and can play digital movies and MP3 files, so you can have music or dialogue 
accompanying your show.
Some things to remember about digital frames:
 
✓ Some frames support only one kind of memory card, such as Compact-
Flash or Secure Digital (SD) — the two most common types — but many 
also support a wide variety of cards.
 
✓ The number of photos you can put onto a digital frame depends, of 
course, on the size of the memory card and the size of the photos.
 
✓ All digital frames use JPEG as the standard file type.
 
✓ You have the option to display your photos in order or randomly.
 
✓ Digital frames sometimes feature various ways of “transitioning” images 
(meaning how the images fade from one to the next, and how long the 
frame stays on a single shot).

igital cameras have a high “wow” factor. That is, when you 
whip out your camera and start taking pictures, you have 
a good chance that some bystander will say, “Wow!” and 
ask for a closer look. Sooner or later, though, people 
stop being distracted by the flashy technology of your 
camera and start paying attention to the quality of 
the pictures you turn out. And if your images are 
poor, whether in terms of photo quality or compo-
sition, the initial “Wows” turn to “Ews,” as in, “Ew, 
that picture’s terrible. You’d think after spending all 
that money on a digital camera, you could come up 
with something better than that.”
So you don’t embarrass yourself — photographically 
speaking, anyway — this chapter presents ten ways to 
create better digital images. If you pay attention to these 
guidelines, your audience will be as captivated by your pic-
tures as they are by your shiny digital camera.

280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Remember the Resolution!
When you print digital photos, the image output resolution — the number of 
pixels per inch, or ppi — has a big impact on picture quality, as illustrated by 
Figure 12-1. The first image has a resolution of 300 ppi; the second, 75 ppi.
Figure 12-1: The poor quality of the right image is due to a lack of pixels.
Most digital cameras offer a few different capture settings, each of which 
delivers a certain number of pixels. Before you take a picture, consider how 
large you may want to print the photo. Then select the capture setting that 
delivers enough pixels to print a good picture at that size.
 
You need at least 200 ppi to produce a good print on most printers, so mul-
tiply your desired print size by that number to determine your pixel require-
ments. (The Cheat Sheet at the front of the book offers a resolution reference 
table for math haters in the crowd.) Your printer may produce better results 
when fed more pixels, however, so check the manual and experiment with 
different pixel counts.
Keep in mind that you usually can get rid of excess pixels in your photo soft-
ware without affecting picture quality, but you almost never get good results 
from adding pixels. In other words, it’s better to wind up with too many 
pixels than too few.
For the complete lowdown on resolution, see Chapter 4.

281
 Chapter 12: Ten Ways to Improve Your Digital Images
Don’t Squish Your Images
 
Today’s digital cameras commonly store images in the JPEG (jay-peg) file 
format. As the image is saved, it goes through a process known as JPEG 
compression. JPEG compression dumps some image data in order to create 
smaller picture files, enabling you to fit more pictures on a memory card or 
a CD. This process is sometimes referred to as lossy compression because it 
results in a loss of picture data. 
Many cameras give you a choice of JPEG settings, each of which applies a 
different amount of compression. In most cases, these settings have quality-
related names — Best, Better, Good, for example, or Fine and Normal. For 
best results, always stick with the top JPEG setting available. At that setting, 
you can expect very good picture quality.
If you edit your files in a photo editor, however, don’t save your works-in-
progress in the JPEG format. Each time you open, edit, and save in the JPEG 
format, you apply another round of lossy compression. And after a while, you 
will be able to notice a loss of image quality. Instead, save in a lossless format 
such as TIFF.
 
Also understand that compression 
and pixel count work together to 
determine picture quality. Combine 
heavy compression with too few 
pixels, and you get a blurry, blocky 
mess like the one you see in Figure 
12-2. This image shows the low-reso-
lution photo from Figure 12-1 after it 
was subjected to maximum JPEG 
compression. 
For photographers who want to 
avoid any chance of JPEG defects, 
some cameras also enable you to 
shoot in the Camera Raw format. 
This format delivers raw picture 
data, with no compression applied. 
However, Raw picture files are sub-
stantially larger than JPEG files, and depending on your subject and how 
large you print or display the photo, you may notice little, if any, difference 
between a picture shot at the highest JPEG setting and one captured in Raw. 
Additionally, you can print, share, and view JPEG pictures immediately, 
whereas you must convert Raw files to a standard format before doing much 
of anything with them.

Look for the Unexpected Angle
As explored in Chapter 7, changing the angle from which you photograph 
your subject can add impact and interest to the picture. Instead of shooting 
a subject straight on, investigate the unexpected angle — lie on the floor and 
get a bug’s-eye view or perch on a sturdy chair and capture the subject from 
above. Or have your subject turn to look at you. 
 
As you compose your scenes, also remember the rule of thirds. Divide the 
frame into vertical and horizontal thirds and position the main focal point of 
the shot at a spot where the dividing lines intersect. 
Turn Down the Noise
 
Digital photos sometimes suffer from a defect called noise, which makes 
your image appear as though someone sprinkled colored sand over it. Noise 
becomes more apparent as you enlarge the photo.
You can combat noise in two ways:
 
✓ Use a low ISO setting. The ISO setting adjusts the camera’s sensitivity 
to light. A higher ISO enables you to capture an image in less light, but 
also increases the possibility of noise. So whenever possible, dial in the 
lowest ISO setting your camera offers.
 
✓ Increase shutter speed. Noise can also result from a very long exposure 
time. The longer the exposure time — in other words, the slower the 
shutter speed — the greater the opportunities for noise.
In dim lighting, you may need to add light to avoid having to use a high ISO 
or slow shutter. Chapter 5 offers some lighting tips and also explains ISO and 
shutter speed in detail. 
Press the Shutter Button Correctly
This tip usually sounds silly to people who hear it for the first time. But one 
of the most common reasons for improperly exposed or out-of-focus pictures 
is improper shutter-button technique.
Most digital cameras offer automatic exposure and automatic focus. For 
these automatic mechanisms to work correctly, take this approach to snap-
ping a picture:

283
 Chapter 12: Ten Ways to Improve Your Digital Images
 
1. Frame the shot. 
 
2. Press the shutter button halfway and hold it there. 
 
 In a second or two, the camera beeps or displays a light, which is your 
signal that the focus has been set. The camera also determines the cor-
rect exposure settings at this time.
 
3. Hold the camera steady as you press the shutter button the rest of the 
way to record the image. 
 
 If you push the shutter button too hard or jab it suddenly, you may 
move the camera, making your nice composition not-so-nice anymore.
Note that some cameras adjust exposure settings right up to the time you 
record the image, while others lock exposure after your half-press of the 
shutter button. For more about exposure, see Chapter 5; for focus tips, see 
Chapter 6.
Turn Off Digital Zoom
Digital zoom is offered on most point-and-shoot digital cameras. From its 
name, you’d naturally expect that digital zoom does the same thing as an 
optical (traditional) zoom lens — that is, make faraway objects appear closer 
and larger in the frame. 
In truth, though, digital zoom is simply a software process that crops your 
photo and then enlarges what’s left; it’s a gimmick used to make the features 
on your camera seem bigger and better when you’re reading the description 
at the store or online. You get exactly the same results as if you use your 
photo software to crop and enlarge the image. And as covered in Chapter 4, 
enlarging a digital photo can reduce picture quality, so turn off digital zoom 
for best results.
Digital zoom also doesn’t affect depth of field — the zone of sharp focus — 
like a real zoom lens. For more about depth of field, see Chapter 6. Chapter 1 
offers more advice about evaluating camera lenses.
Take Advantage of Your Photo Editor
Don’t automatically toss photos that don’t look as good as you’d like. With 
some judicious use of your photo software’s retouching tools, you can 
brighten underexposed images, sharpen slightly soft (blurry) photos, correct 
color balance, crop out distracting background elements, and even cover up 
small blemishes. 

284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can also get really creative and make a photo appear as if it was pro-
duced using traditional art media, such as watercolors, chalk, or crayons. 
Figure 12-3 offers just one example; this image is the result of applying an 
artistic filter and some color enhancements in Photoshop Elements. 
 
Serge Timacheff
 
Figure 12-3: Using creative tools like Photoshop Elements 
 
filters can give ordinary photos an artistic look.
 
Applying an artistic filter is a great way to hide flaws that you can’t remove 
in your photo editor, by the way. Got a photo that’s too blurry to be repaired 
using a sharpening filter, for example? Turn it into a faux watercolor. People 
don’t expect images created with watercolor to be “sharp,” and so your focus 
problems are gone!
Being able to edit your photographs is one of the major advantages of digital 
photography. Take a few minutes each day to become acquainted with your 
photo software’s correction commands, filters, and tools. After you start 
using them, you’ll wonder how you got along without them. Chapter 9 gets 
you started by showing you a few photo-retouching basics.

285
 Chapter 12: Ten Ways to Improve Your Digital Images
Print on Good Paper with Good Ink
As discussed in Chapter 10, the type of paper you use when printing can have 
a dramatic effect on how your pictures look. The same picture that appears 
blurry, dark, and oversaturated when printed on cheap copy paper can look 
sharp, bright, and glorious when printed on special glossy photographic 
paper.
If you’re printing photos at a lab, you can count on getting good-quality 
paper. But if you’re doing the job on a home printer, check your printer’s 
manual for information on the ideal paper to use with your model. Some 
printers are engineered to work with a specific brand of paper, but don’t be 
afraid to experiment with paper from other manufacturers. Paper vendors 
are furiously developing new papers specifically designed for printing digital 
images on consumer-level color printers, so you may find something that 
works even better than the recommended paper.
 
For inkjet printers, another critical factor is the type of ink you use. You 
can use third-party inks to save money. However, many third-party inks are 
of poor quality or even produce incorrect color combinations. In addition, 
printer manufacturers carefully engineer print heads and other ink-delivery 
systems to work with specific ink formulations, and any variance in the for-
mula can muck up the works. So for the most reliable results, stick with the 
ink recommended by the printer manufacturer.
Practice, Practice, Practice!
Digital photography is no different from any other skill in that the more you 
practice, the better you’ll be. Shoot as many pictures as you can, in as many 
different light situations as you can. 
 
After you download your pictures, open them in a photo browser that can 
display the camera’s metadata. That metadata records all the settings that 
you used for each shot, so you can evaluate the pictures to see which set-
tings worked the best in which situations. (See the end of Chapter 8 for a look 
at some actual metadata.)
After you spend some time experimenting with your camera, you’ll gain an 
instinctive feel for what tactics to use in different shooting scenarios, increas-
ing the percentage of great pictures in your portfolio.

286
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Read the Manual (Gasp!)
Remember that instruction manual that came with your camera? The one you 
promptly stuffed in a drawer without bothering to read? Go get it. Then sit 
down and spend an hour devouring every bit of information inside it.
Yes, manuals are deadly boring, especially when compared with this book, 
which is so dang funny you find yourself slapping your knee and snorting 
milk through your nose at almost every paragraph. But you aren’t going to 
get the best pictures out of your camera unless you understand how all its 
controls work. This book can give you general recommendations and instruc-
tions, but for camera-specific information, the best resource is the manufac-
turer’s own manual.
 
Can’t find your manual or you don’t have one? No worries! Most camera 
manufacturers’ Web sites usually offer the manuals as PDF files available to 
download.

Top Ten Maintenance and 
Emergency Care Tips
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping fresh batteries at the ready
▶ Erasing images properly
▶ Protecting your memory card
▶ Safeguarding your camera from heat, cold, and water
▶ Backing up regularly
▶ Taking care of your computer’s hard drive
T
he old Boy Scout motto, “Be prepared,” applies in spades when 
it comes to digital photography. Although you can’t fore-
see all potential incidents that might snag your photo 
shoot, you can keep your camera in tip-top condition and 
practice some basic preventative measures to ensure 
that your equipment stays safe and in good working 
order. This chapter provides ten strategies to help 
you do just that. 
Keep Spare Batteries On-Hand
Digital cameras are hungry for power, which means 
you will have to replace or recharge the batteries 
from time to time. To avoid missing important photo-
graphic opportunities, always keep a spare set of batteries 
or an extra rechargeable on-hand. That way you don’t waste 
precious time running to the store or waiting for your battery 
to recharge when you could be taking pictures. The same holds true for an 
external flash, if your camera supports one.

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
The amount of time and number of photos that you can shoot before replac-
ing your batteries vary, depending on how you use your camera. If you start 
to run low on battery power, try these energy-conservation tips:
 
✓ Limit the use of the monitor. The monitor is one of the biggest power 
drains, so wait to review your pictures until you have fresh batteries. 
When you’re not using the monitor to take pictures, turn it off, even if 
you leave the camera itself powered up.
 
✓ Turn on your camera’s auto-off function. Most cameras offer a feature 
that automatically shuts the camera off after a period of inactivity to 
save power. You may even be able to reduce the wait time that must 
pass before the shutdown occurs.
 
✓ Go flash-free. The internal flash also consumes lots of battery juice. 
When the flash recycle time starts to slow down, that’s a clue that your 
batteries are fading.
 
✓ Turn off image stabilization. On some cameras, turning off this feature 
saves battery power (but check your manual because this tip doesn’t 
apply to all models of cameras and lenses).
 
✓ Avoid using continuous autofocus, if your camera offers it. In this 
mode, the camera continuously adjusts focus from the time you press 
the shutter button halfway until the time you actually take the picture. 
And because the autofocus motor consumes power, you can preserve 
some battery life by sticking with regular autofocus or, on a dSLR, shift-
ing to manual focus.
 
✓ Keep spare batteries warm. Batteries deplete faster when they get cold, 
so tuck your extra batteries in a shirt pocket or find some other way to 
keep the chill off.
 
Always do whatever you can to protect spare, loose batteries from short-
circuiting as well. That means protecting the metal electrical contacts from 
connecting (both touching the same piece of aluminum foil, for example). 
Most batteries come with little caps that cover the contacts, and it’s a good 
idea to use them; otherwise cover them with tape or keep them in separate 
containers. 
Format Your Memory Cards
After you download images from a memory card, always format the card 
when you put it back into your camera. Also format new cards when you put 
them into your camera for the first time.

293
 Chapter 14: Top Ten Maintenance and Emergency Care Tips
 
You typically can find a Format or Format Memory Card option somewhere 
on your camera’s setup menus. (Don’t confuse this option with the one that 
enables you to set the picture’s file format, usually JPEG or Camera Raw; 
Chapter 4 explains this issue.)
Formatting your card does two things: 
 
✓ It ensures you’ve gotten rid of the previous files on the card.
 
✓ It ensures your card is correctly configured for your camera.
If you simply erase pictures from your card, you’re essentially leaving cookie 
crumbs behind. (Techies call these fragments.) When enough fragments 
are left behind, they eat up space on your card and can make some cards 
unusable.
Keep these additional dos and don’ts in mind, too:
 
✓ If you’re using an image-editing program to transfer files automatically 
from your card to your computer, don’t select any option that lets you 
delete your files on the card as you transfer them. This is simply asking 
for trouble; wait until you’re sure the files transferred successfully 
before you think about wiping the originals from the card. 
 
✓ Don’t delete images on your card from your computer; doing so can 
cause problems when you go to use the card in the camera again. 
 
✓ Before formatting your card, do make absolutely sure you’ve down-
loaded all the pictures that you want to keep before pushing the OK 
button. And remember that formatting wipes out all files on the card, 
not just picture files — so if you use your card to store other things, 
such as music files, beware.
 
If you accidentally format a card that contained images that you didn’t want 
to delete, don’t despair yet: A variety of image-recovery software programs 
can usually recover many lost pictures — especially if you haven’t pho-
tographed more images on the newly formatted card. Most Web sites for 
popular memory-card brands (www.lexar.com and www.sandisk.com, among 
others) offer various types of image recovery software programs you can 
purchase and download should disaster strike. 
Keep Your Memory Cards Clean 
If any dirt gets onto the copper strips or holes in your memory card, you may 
not be able to transfer images, or your images may become corrupt during 

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
transfer. The key to preventing this from happening is to keep cards as clean 
as possible. You can store them in your camera, the little plastic cases they 
shipped in, or a memory card case.
While memory cards are remarkably durable (there are stories of them going 
through the washing machine and still working), they’re still somewhat 
fragile and very easily lost. CompactFlash pinholes are especially suscep-
tible to things like lint in your pocket. (On a side note: Be careful to insert 
CompactFlash cards gently and in the right direction; they connect to little 
pins inside your camera and card reader, and you can easily bend those pins 
if you’re too forceful.) 
Lastly, try not to expose memory cards to extreme cold or heat. Setting one 
on your dashboard on a sunny day, for example, is asking for trouble. 
Clean the Lens and LCD with Care
Is there anything more annoying than a dirty lens? Let’s face it: Fingerprints, 
rain drops, and dust happen, and they all get in the way of the perfect image. 
And LCD monitors also can get gunked up pretty easily.
To clean your lens and LCD, stick with these tools:
 
✓ A microfiber cloth (like the ones used for cleaning eyeglasses). It works 
either with or without lens-cleaning fluid. And yes, you can go ahead and 
breathe onto the glass or plastic LCD to fog it up with some moisture 
first. 
 
✓ Any cotton product, such as a t-shirt or dishtowel, is usually okay as 
long as it’s clean and lint-free. 
 
✓ A manually operated bulb blower commonly available in any camera 
store. Some come with a little natural-fiber brush, which is also okay. It’s 
a good idea to use this type of tool before wiping your lens if it’s espe-
cially dirty to ensure that bigger particles of dirt aren’t rubbed into the 
lens. 
 
Do not use any of the following to clean a lens or LCD:
 
✓ The same microfiber cloth you use for your glasses. It may have oily 
residue from your face. 
 
✓ Facial tissue, newspaper, napkins, or toilet paper. These are made from 
wood products and can scratch glass and plastic and can harm a lens 
coating.

295
 Chapter 14: Top Ten Maintenance and Emergency Care Tips
 
✓ Household cleaning products (window cleaner, detergent, toothpaste, 
and the like).
 
✓ Compressed air. These cans contain a chemical propellant that can 
coat your lens or LCD with a permanent residue. Even more scary, com-
pressed air can actually crack the monitor.
 
✓ Synthetic materials (like polyester). They usually don’t clean well, 
anyway.
 
✓ Any cloth that’s dirty or that’s been washed with a fabric softener.
 
If you’re using interchangeable lenses on a dSLR camera, you can attach a 
clear protective filter on the lens — look for something called a UV/Haze 
filter (the UV stands for ultraviolet). You can also buy these filters for some 
point-and-shoot models.
Of course, you should always carry and store your camera in a quality case 
or bag; see Chapter 2 for a look at some options.
Update Your Firmware
Just when you thought software and hardware were confusing enough, along 
comes another techno-term to deal with: firmware. This special software lives 
permanently on your camera, telling it how to operate and function — in 
essence, it’s your camera’s gray matter. 
Every now and then, camera manufacturers update firmware to fix problems 
and bugs, enhance features, and generally do housekeeping that makes your 
camera operate better. Sometimes these changes are minor, but occasionally 
they fix pretty serious problems and errors. 
 
To benefit from these updates, you have to download the new firmware files 
from your camera manufacturer’s Web site and install them on your camera. 
If you signed up for manufacturer e-mail updates when you registered your 
camera (you did do that, right?), the company should inform you of updates 
when they occur. But it’s a good idea to also simply check the manufacturer’s 
camera support page every three months or so to make sure that you don’t 
miss an important firmware update.
Depending on the camera brand and model, you typically can update your 
camera one of two ways:
 
✓ Download and install the files from a memory card: Put a memory 
card in a card reader connected to your computer and then download 
the firmware files from the Web site to the card. After the files are on 

296
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
the card, put it in your camera and follow the directions in your camera 
manual (or on the Web site) to install the firmware. 
 
✓ Download and install directly to your camera: You also may be able 
to download directly to your camera by connecting the camera to your 
computer using a USB cable. Again, check your camera manual for spe-
cifics on this process.
 
Don’t push any buttons or disconnect the camera until the update is finished. 
Cameras don’t like being interrupted during brain surgery. (Be sure your 
camera batteries are fully charged before you begin, too.)
Protect Your Camera from Temperature Extremes
Extreme cold can cause various mechanical functions in your camera to 
freeze; it can stop your lens from zooming or your shutter release button 
from operating. Your LCD may stop functioning as well, and your battery 
power may drop so much that your camera won’t even turn on. 
If you must take your camera into the cold, keep it in a camera case under 
your jacket until you’re ready to use it. In the photo shown in Figure 14-1 — 
taken while on a snowmobile safari in the Arctic region of northern Finland at 
–42° Fahrenheit — you can just see the camera case beneath the jacket, for 
example. 
 
 
Figure 14-1: Extreme cold can be especially bad for your camera, and you 
 
need to protect it from the elements. 

297
 Chapter 14: Top Ten Maintenance and Emergency Care Tips
On the flip side of the temperature scale, extreme heat can damage your 
camera as well and can be especially hard on your LCD screen, which can 
“go dark” if it gets too hot. If this happens, simply get your camera to a cooler 
place. Typically, it will return to a normal viewing state. Although heat gener-
ally doesn’t cause as many problems as cold, leaving your camera in direct 
sunlight (such as in a car) isn’t a good idea. If you can at least cover it with a 
towel or t-shirt, your camera will be happier. 
 
Changing temperature extremes, such as going from a warm room into sub-
freezing weather, are especially bad for your camera. Condensation forms on 
the camera parts and lens elements, which can (at best) obstruct your ability 
to take good photos and (at worst) cause permanent moisture damage. To 
avoid problems, store your camera in a sealed Ziploc-type bag until it adjusts 
to the new temperature.
Keep Your Camera Away from Water
Digital cameras, like most other electronic devices, don’t do well if they get 
wet. Water — especially salt water — can short important camera circuitry 
and corrode metal parts. A few raindrops probably won’t cause any big prob-
lems, but exposure to enough water, even momentarily, can result in a death 
sentence for a camera. 
Did you leave your camera on the picnic table during a brief downpour? Did 
you drop it into the fountain? If you think your camera is potentially dam-
aged, but not enough that it’s clearly beyond hope, the following steps may 
help you salvage it:
 
1. Remove the batteries and memory card. 
 
2. Wipe the camera with a clean, dry cloth. 
 
 Try not to push any buttons. 
 
3. Set it in a warm place where it can dry out as much and as quickly as 
possible. 
 
4. Get your camera to a good-quality, authorized repair facility or send it 
to the manufacturer. 
While these steps aren’t a guarantee that your camera will make it, some-
times you can get lucky. 
Obviously, preventing your camera from getting wet is always preferable to 
having it repaired, and keeping it in a water-resistant or waterproof case is 
the best way to avoid getting it wet. Most camera bags are at least moder-
ately water-resistant, and some even have completely sealed, waterproof 

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
compartments. Barring that, put your camera in a large, locking, plastic sand-
wich bag (or two).
 
If you want to try underwater photography, you can buy waterproof housings 
that are designed to let you operate all the camera’s buttons and such but 
still keep the innards safe and dry. Some companies also make a variety of 
products that protect your gear when you shoot in the rain. See Chapter 2 for 
an introduction to just some protection options.
Clean the Image Sensor
The image sensor is the part of your camera that absorbs light and converts 
it into a digital image. If dust, hair, or dirt gets on the sensor, it can show up 
as small spots on your photos. For example, you can see two spots in Figure 
14-2, in the sky to the right of the pyramid. (Image-sensor spots are often 
most visible in the sky or in bright, clear areas of your image, but can be seen 
just about anywhere.) 
 
Serge Timacheff
 
Figure 14-2: Spots on a dSLR’s image sensor appear in 
 
the same place on multiple images.

299
 Chapter 14: Top Ten Maintenance and Emergency Care Tips
Many new cameras have an internal cleaning system designed to remove any 
stray flotsam and jetsam from the sensor. Usually, the camera is set up at 
the factory to go through a cleaning cycle each time you turn the camera on, 
off, or both. You may also be able to initiate a cleaning cycle at other times 
through a menu option.
If the camera’s internal cleaning mechanisms don’t do the trick, you need 
to take your camera to a repair shop to have the sensor cleaned manually. 
Although you can find products designed to help you do this job yourself, 
you do so at your own peril. This job is a delicate one, and really should be 
done only be a trained technician. Call your local camera store to find out the 
best place in town to have the cleaning done. (Some camera stores offer free 
cleaning for cameras purchased from them.) 
 
You can help limit the amount of dust and dirt that finds its way to your 
image sensor by keeping the camera stored in a case or camera bag when not 
in use and being cautious when shooting in dicey environmental situations — 
windy days on the beach, for example. If you own a dSLR, be especially care-
ful when changing lenses, because that’s a prime occasion for dirt to sneak 
into the camera. Also try to point the camera slightly downward when you 
attach the lens; doing so can help prevent dust from being sucked into the 
camera by gravity.
Back Up Your Images Regularly
When disasters such as fires or floods occur, photos are one of the first 
things people try to save. Photographs are precious memories and often 
can’t be replaced. 
Digital images can be destroyed not only by fire or flood, but also by a 
hard-drive failure if that’s the only place you have them stored. While not 
extremely common, hard drives have been known, on occasion, to simply 
stop working. It’s difficult and expensive — and occasionally impossible — to 
retrieve files from one that’s gone bad. 
 
The key to preventing a disaster such as this is simple: Back up your images 
on a CD or DVD. Store the disks in a location separate from your originals. 
Some people keep backups in safe-deposit boxes at banks, in other family 
members’ homes, or in their offices, for example. 
For the complete story on image backup, including information about storage 
devices designed to hold your favorite photos, see Chapter 2.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Clean Out Your Computer’s Hard Drive
You probably know that computers need lots of RAM (random-access 
memory) in order to run smoothly and quickly. But you may not know that 
a computer also needs a significant amount of empty space on its hard 
drive — that’s the component that holds all your files and programs — to 
perform well. The computer uses that free space, sometimes called scratch 
disk space, to temporarily store data as it’s processing your files. Without 
enough free space, the computer slows down and may not be able to perform 
some photo-editing tasks at all, especially on large image files.
Generally speaking, you should keep at least 10GB (gigabytes) of free space 
on your hard drive, although some photo programs may request even more. 
Keeping that free space available may mean moving data files onto external 
hard drives, CDs, or DVDs for storage; it may also mean uninstalling unused 
applications.
Chapter 2 gives you a look at some of your storage options; see Chapter 8 
for a look at some software that can help you organize and manage your 
photo files.

Glossary
C
an’t remember the difference between a pixel and a bit? Resolution and 
resampling? Turn here for a quick refresher on that digital photography 
term that’s stuck somewhere in the dark recesses of your brain and refuses 
to come out and play.
24-bit image: An image containing approximately 16.7 million colors.
AE Lock: A way to prevent the camera’s autoexposure system from chang-
ing the current exposure settings if you reframe the picture or the lighting 
changes before the image is recorded.
aperture: One of three critical exposure controls; an opening made by an 
adjustable diaphragm, which permits light to enter the camera lens and 
reach the image sensor. The size of the opening is measured in f/stops (f/2.8, 
f/8, and so on). Aperture also affects depth of field, or the distance over 
which sharp focus is maintained. 
aperture-priority autoexposure: A semi-automatic exposure mode; the pho-
tographer sets the aperture, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter 
speed to produce a good exposure.
artifact: A defect created by too much JPEG compression.
aspect ratio: The proportions of an image. A 35mm-film photo has an aspect 
ratio of 3:2; the standard digital-camera image has an aspect ratio of either 
3:2 or 4:3.
autoexposure: A feature that puts the camera in control of choosing the 
proper exposure settings. See also aperture-priority autoexposure and 
shutter-priority autoexposure.
backlight: Bright light coming from behind your subject, which can cause 
your subject to be underexposed in autoexposure shooting modes. 
bit: Stands for binary digit; the basic unit of digital information. Eight bits 
equals one byte.
bit depth: Refers to the number of bits available to store color information. 
A standard digital camera image has a bit depth of 24 bits. Images with more 
than 24 bits are called high-bit images.
burst mode: A special capture setting, offered on some digital cameras, that 
records several images in rapid succession with one press of the shutter 
button. Also called continuous capture mode.

302
Digital Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition 
byte: Eight bits. See bit.
Camera Raw: A file format offered by some digital cameras; records the 
photo without applying any of the in-camera processing or file compression 
that is usually done automatically when saving photos in the other standard 
format, JPEG. Also known as Raw.
card reader: A device used to transfer images from your CompactFlash, 
Secure Digital (SD), or other type of memory card to your computer. 
catchlight: The bright, small, reflective spots seen in a subject’s eyes in a 
photo that can come from a flash or natural light.
CCD: Short for charge-coupled device. One of two types of imaging sensors 
used in digital cameras.
CIE Lab: A color model developed by the Commission Internationale de 
l’Eclairage. Used mostly by digital-imaging professionals.
CMOS: Pronounced see-moss. A much easier way to say complementary metal-
oxide semiconductor. A type of imaging sensor used in some digital cameras.
CMYK: The print color model, in which cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks 
are mixed to produce colors.
color correction: The process of adjusting the amount of different colors in 
an image (for example, reducing red or increasing green).
color model: A way of defining colors. In the RGB color model, for example, 
all colors are created by blending red, green, and blue light. In the CMYK 
model, colors are produced by mixing cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink.
color temperature: Refers to the color cast emitted by a light source; mea-
sured on the Kelvin scale.
CompactFlash: A type of removable memory card used in many digital cam-
eras; about the size and thickness of a matchbook.
compositing: Combining two or more images in a photo-editing program.
compression: A process that reduces the size of the image file by eliminating 
some image data.

303
 Glossary
continuous autofocus: An autofocus feature on some digital cameras, in 
which the camera continuously adjusts focus as needed to keep a moving 
subject in focus.
contrast: The amount of difference between the brightest and darkest values 
in an image. High-contrast images contain both very dark and very bright 
areas.
crop: To trim away unwanted areas around the perimeter of a photo, 
typically done in a photo-editing program.
depth of field: The zone of sharp focus in a photograph. With shallow depth-
of-field, the subject is sharp but distant objects are not; with large depth 
of field, both the subject and distant objects are in focus. Manipulated by 
adjusting the aperture, focal length, or camera-to-subject distance.
digital zoom: A feature offered on most digital cameras; crops the perimeter 
of the image and then enlarges the area at the center. Results in reduced 
image quality.
diopter: An adjustment on a camera viewfinder to accommodate your 
eyesight.
downloading: Transferring data from your camera to a computer or from one 
computer device to another.
dpi: Short for dots per inch. A measurement of how many dots of color a 
printer can create per linear inch. Higher dpi means better print quality on 
some types of printers, but on other printers, dpi is not as crucial.
DPOF: Stands for digital print order format. A feature offered by some digital 
cameras that enables you to add print instructions to the image file; some 
photo printers can read that information when printing your pictures directly 
from a memory card.
driver: Software that enables a computer to interact with a digital camera, 
printer, or other device. Usually this installs automatically when you plug 
your device into your computer, but sometimes you have to use a CD to 
install it. 
dye-sub: Short for dye-sublimation. A type of photo printer.
edges: Areas where neighboring image pixels are significantly different in 
color; in other words, areas of high contrast.

304
Digital Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition 
EV compensation: A control that slightly increases or decreases the expo-
sure chosen by the camera’s autoexposure mechanism. EV stands for expo-
sure value; EV settings typically appear as EV 1.0, EV 0.0, EV –1.0, and so on.
EVF: An electronic viewfinder, which delivers an electronic pixel version of 
what the camera lens actually captures through a small viewfinder display. 
Different from an optical viewfinder, which employs lenses to approximate 
the camera lens view or looks directly through the lens (on an SLR camera).
EXIF metadata: See metadata.
exposure: The overall brightness and contrast of a photograph, determined 
mainly by three settings: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.
file format: A way of storing image data in a digital file. Popular digital-
camera formats include Camera Raw, JPEG, and TIFF.
fill flash: Using a flash to fill in darker areas of an image, such as shadows 
cast on subjects’ faces by bright overhead sunlight or backlighting. 
flash EV compensation: A feature that enables the photographer to adjust 
the strength of the camera flash.
f-number, f-stop: Refers to the size of the camera aperture. A higher number 
indicates a smaller aperture. Written as f/2, f/8, and so on. Affects both expo-
sure and depth of field.
gamut: Say it gamm-ut. The range of colors that a monitor, printer, or other 
device can produce. Colors that a device can’t create are said to be out of 
gamut.
GIF: Short for graphics interchange format. A file format often used for Web 
graphics; not suitable for photos because it can’t handle more than 256 
colors.
gigabyte: Approximately 1,000 megabytes, or 1 billion bytes. In other words, 
a really big collection of bytes. Abbreviated as GB.
grayscale: An image consisting solely of shades of gray, from white to black. 
Often referred to generically as a black-and-white image (although in the 
truest sense, a black-and-white image contains only black and white, with no 
grays).
histogram: A graph that maps out shadow, midtone, and highlight brightness 
values in a digital image; an exposure-monitoring tool that can be displayed 

305
 Glossary
on some cameras. Also found inside some of the exposure-correction filter 
dialog boxes displayed in some photo-editing programs.
HSB: A color model based on hue (color), saturation (purity or intensity of 
color), and brightness.
HSL: A variation of HSB, this color model is based on hue, saturation, and 
lightness.
image sensor: The CMOS or CCD chip in your camera that senses light and 
converts it into digital information. 
ISO: Traditionally, a measure of film speed; the higher the number, the 
faster the film. On a digital camera, it means how sensitive the image sensor 
is to light. Raising the ISO allows faster shutter speed, smaller aperture, or 
both, but also can result in a noisy (grainy) image. Stands for International 
Standards Organization.
jaggies: Refers to the jagged, stair-stepped appearance of curved and diago-
nal lines in low-resolution photos that are printed at large sizes.
JPEG: Pronounced jay-peg. The primary file format used by digital cameras; 
also the leading format for online and Web pictures. Uses lossy compression, 
which eliminates some data in order to produce smaller files. A small amount 
of compression does little discernible damage, but a high amount destroys 
picture quality. Stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the group that 
developed the format. 
JPEG 2000: An updated version of the JPEG format; not yet fully supported 
by all Web browsers or other computer programs.
Kelvin: A scale for measuring the color temperature of light. Sometimes 
abbreviated as K, as in 5000K. (But in computerland, the initial K more often 
refers to kilobytes, as described next.) 
kilobyte: One thousand bytes. Abbreviated as K, as in 64K.
LCD: Stands for liquid crystal display. Often used to refer to the display screen 
included on most digital cameras.
lossless compression: A file-compression scheme that doesn’t sacrifice any 
vital image data in the compression process, used by file formats such as 
TIFF. Lossless compression tosses only redundant data, so image quality is 
unaffected.

306
Digital Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition 
lossy compression: A compression scheme that eliminates important image 
data in the name of achieving smaller file sizes, used by file formats such as 
JPEG. High amounts of lossy compression reduce image quality.
manual exposure: An exposure mode that enables you to control aperture, 
shutter speed, and ISO. Usually represented by the letter M on the camera’s 
exposure mode dial.
manual focus: A setting that turns off autofocus and instead enables you 
to set focus by twisting a ring on the lens barrel or by specifying a specific 
focusing distance through camera menus.
megabyte: One million bytes. Abbreviated as MB. See bit.
megapixel: One million pixels; used to describe the resolution offered by a 
digital camera. 
Memory Stick: A memory card used by most Sony digital cameras and 
peripheral devices. About the size of a stick of chewing gum.
metadata: Extra data that gets stored along with the primary image data in 
an image file. Metadata often includes information such as aperture, shutter 
speed, and EV setting used to capture the picture, and can be viewed using 
special software. It can also include information you add in a photo-editing 
program, such as a copyright, your name, keywords, or a photo caption. 
Often referred to as EXIF metadata; EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File 
Format.
metering mode: Refers to the way a camera’s autoexposure mechanism 
reads the light in a scene. Common modes include spot metering, which 
bases exposure on light in the center of the frame only; center-weighted 
metering, which reads the entire scene but gives more emphasis to the sub-
ject in the center of the frame; and matrix, evaluative, pattern, or multizone 
metering, which calculates exposure based on the entire frame.
monopod: A telescoping, single-legged pole onto which you can mount a 
camera and lens in order to hold it more stably while shooting. It will not 
stand on its own, unlike a tripod. 
MultiMediaCard: A type of memory card used by some digital cameras.
noise: Graininess in an image, caused by a very long exposure, a too-high ISO 
setting, or a defect in the electrical signal generated during the image-capture 
process.

307
 Glossary
NTSC: A video format used by televisions, DVD players, and VCRs in North 
America and some parts of Asia (such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and 
the Philippines). Many digital cameras can send picture signals to a TV, DVD 
player, or VCR in this format.
optical zoom: A traditional zoom lens; has the effect of bringing the subject 
closer and shortening depth of field. 
output resolution: The number of pixels per linear inch (ppi) in a printed 
photo; the user sets this value inside a photo-editing program.
PAL: The video format common in Europe, China, Australia, Brazil, and sev-
eral other countries in Asia, South America, and Africa. Some digital cameras 
sold in North America can output pictures in this video format (see also 
NTSC).
PCMCIA Card: A type of removable memory card used in some digital cam-
eras. Now often referred to simply as PC Cards. (PCMCIA stands for Personal 
Computer Memory Card International Association.)
PictBridge: A universal standard that allows digital cameras and photo 
printers to connect directly by USB cable, without the computer serving as 
a middleman. Any PictBridge camera can connect to any PictBridge printer, 
regardless of whether both are made by the same manufacturer. 
pixel: Short for picture element. The basic building block of every digital 
image.
pixelation: A defect that occurs when an image has too few pixels for the 
size at which it is printed; pixels become so large that the image takes on a 
mosaic-like or stairstepped appearance. 
platform: A fancy way of saying “type of computer operating system.” Most 
folks work either on the Windows platform or the Macintosh platform.
plug-in: A small program or utility that runs within another, larger program. 
Many special-effects filters operate as plug-ins to major photo-editing pro-
grams such as Adobe Photoshop Elements.
ppi: Stands for pixels per inch. Used to state an image’s output (print) resolu-
tion. Measured in terms of the number of pixels per linear inch. A higher ppi 
usually translates to better-looking printed images.

308
Digital Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition 
Raw: See Camera Raw.
Raw converter: A software utility that translates Camera Raw files into a 
standard image format such as JPEG or TIFF.
red-eye: Light from a flash being reflected from a subject’s retina, causing the 
pupil to appear red in photographs. Can sometimes be prevented by using 
a red-eye reduction flash setting; can also be removed later in most image-
editing programs. 
resampling: Adding or deleting image pixels. Adding a large amount of pixels 
degrades images.
resolution: A term used to describe the number of pixels in a digital image. 
Also a specification describing the rendering capabilities of scanners, print-
ers, and monitors; means different things depending on the device. (See 
Chapter 4 for details.)
RGB: The standard color model for digital images; all colors are created by 
mixing red, green, and blue light.
rule of thirds: A philosophy for composing images where various parts of 
your image are separated and flow among nine squares, aligned tic-tac-toe 
style. Normally you center elements of your subject onto cross-points of the 
vertical and horizontal lines. 
SD Card: A type of memory card used in many digital cameras; stands for 
Secure Digital. 
SDHC Card: A high-capacity form of the SD card; requires a camera and card 
reader that specifically supports the format. 
sharpening: Applying an image-correction filter inside a photo editor to 
create the appearance of sharper focus.
shutter: The device in a camera that opens and shuts to allow light into the 
camera.
shutter-priority autoexposure: A semi-automatic exposure mode in which 
the photographer sets the shutter speed and the camera selects the appro-
priate aperture.
shutter speed: The length of time that the camera shutter remains open, 
thereby allowing light to enter the camera and expose the photograph. 
Typically measured in fractions of a second, as in 1/60 or 1/250 second. 

309
 Glossary
slow-sync flash: A special flash setting that allows (or forces) a slower shut-
ter speed than is typical for the normal flash setting. Results in a brighter 
background than normal flash.
SmartMedia: A thin, matchbook-size, removable memory card used in some 
older digital cameras.
TIFF: Pronounced tiff, as in a little quarrel. Stands for tagged image file format. 
A popular image format supported by most Macintosh and Windows pro-
grams. It is lossless, meaning that it retains image data in a way that maintains 
maximum image quality. Often used to save Raw files after processing and all 
pictures after editing.
tripod: Used to mount and to stabilize a camera, preventing camera shake 
that can blur an image; characterized by three telescoping legs. 
TWAIN: Say it twain, as in “never the twain shall meet.” A special software 
interface that enables image-editing programs to access images captured by 
digital cameras and scanners.
unsharp masking: The process of using the Unsharp Mask filter, found in 
many image-editing programs, to create the appearance of a more focused 
image. The same thing as sharpening an image, only more impressive-
sounding.
uploading: The same as downloading; the process of transferring data 
between two computer devices.
USB: Stands for Universal Serial Bus. A type of port now included on all 
computers. Digital cameras come with a USB cable for connecting the camera 
to this port.
white balance: Adjusting the camera to compensate for the color tempera-
ture of the lighting. Ensures accurate rendition of colors in digital photo-
graphs.
xD-Picture Card: A type of memory card used in digital cameras.
