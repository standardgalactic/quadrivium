About the Authors
Carolyn O’Connor graduated cum laude from Yale College with 
a bachelor of science degree in chemistry. She then traveled to
Manhattan to attend Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.
After medical school, she did her postgraduate training in internal
medicine at The New York Hospital – Cornell Medical School. Her
fellowship training in rheumatology was at Boston University
Medical Center. Currently, she is chief of rheumatology and associ-
ate professor of medicine at Drexel University College of Medicine
in Philadelphia. One of her major interests is metabolic bone dis-
ease. Her division of rheumatology runs the bone density program
at Drexel.
She has two children; one has majored in philosophy and the other
is studying mechanical engineering. Her outside interests include
growing roses and struggling with the New York Times Crossword.
Sharon Perkins has been a registered nurse for almost 20 years,
and currently works for a group of retinal doctors. Since she
started treating an older population with macular degeneration,
she sees way more osteoporosis than she wishes she did. She has
five children and two daughters-in-law, two grandchildren, and a
husband who recently retired from 20-plus years of flying airplanes
and is currently hanging around the house.

Dedications
I dedicate this book to my many patients who trust in my advice.
Truly, from listening to them and caring for them, I have learned
more about osteoporosis than from reading any textbook.
Carolyn R. O’Connor, MD
For my granddaughter Emma, in hopes that osteoporosis will be
fully preventable in her future.
Sharon Perkins

Many thanks to the following people:
* Antonio J Reginato, MD (in memoriam) friend and mentor,

University College of Medicine, who contributed invaluable
comments to Chapter 13

disorders
Carolyn R. O’Connor, MD
One of my earliest memories is of my great grandmother, who my
younger sister called “the grandma with the broken arm.” I’d just
met my family history of osteoporosis, although I didn’t know it at
the time.
Years down the road, my children remembered their great grand-
mother, daughter of my great grandma, who had fallen and broken
her hip. Pictures show the inches she lost as she aged as evidence
of vertebral compression fractures.
Osteoporosis runs in my family, but we never really put a name to
it or did much about it. But because of the problems my relatives
had, I was always aware of aging as being dangerous for your
bones, and for that, I thank them.

I also have to thank my sister, Sue, for telling me I’d hate writing a
book on osteoporosis, because “bones are boring.” She knows I
love a challenge.
Thanks to all the rest of my family and my friends for occasionally
remembering that I was writing a book and asking me how it was
going. Sometimes I needed a chance to vent!
For all the people behind the scenes at Wiley Publishing, especially
Kathy Cox, who never loses faith in me, thank you.
Dr. O’Connor and I both thank our acquisitions editor, Mikal
Belicove, for the chance to write this book, as well as our mar-
velous project editor, Natalie Harris, copy editor, Chad Sievers, and
technical editor, Deborah Kado. And once again, Kathryn Born has
done a wonderful job on illustrations.

Introduction
You may think you know enough about osteoporosis without
reading a whole book on it. Take calcium, try not to fall down
the basement steps, be prepared to shrink three or four inches as
you get older, and so on, right? What else is there to know? Plenty,
as we hope you’ll agree after reading this book. The unfortunate
fact is that although nobody wants to have osteoporosis, not
enough people take steps to decrease their chances of develop-
ing it.
Considering that your odds of developing osteoporosis in the
United States today are around 40 percent if you’re female and 10
percent if you’re male, many people are leaving the fate of their
bones to chance.
One of our goals in writing this book is to keep you from develop-
ing osteoporosis. However, if you already have osteoporosis, our
goal is to minimize the damage it does to your bones, through
medication, healthy eating, and exercise.
If you’ve already fallen and broken bones, we want to help you
avoid another fall. If you have children or grandchildren, we hope
that you’ll nag them into taking steps to avoid falling into osteo-
porosis themselves. We want to help you have healthy bones. We
also want you to avoid spending months in casts or in surgery
after falls that break bones you really need to stay mobile.
You can prevent osteoporosis or at least reduce its severity, but 
it takes lifestyle changes that start in childhood. Is making the
lifestyle changes worth it? Ask anyone who’s spent six months
recovering from a broken hip. Does it take discipline? Yes — but so
does learning to walk again.
Nothing in life is simple, but our goal is to educate you as pain-
lessly as possible to the high cost of osteoporosis, and the newest
ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat it. Don’t fall into the trap of
believing that osteoporosis is inevitable; we’re here to help you
avoid the bad breaks.

About This Book
We wrote this book hoping it would be less of a “how to” book and
more of a “how to avoid” book. In other words, rather than just
explain how to deal with osteoporosis, we also want to show how
to avoid it altogether.
Unfortunately, for some of you, that’s not going to be possible.
Some of you already have osteoporosis, and others are inevitably
going to have it. For you, we wrote quite a bit of (we hope) helpful
information on what medications to take, how to handle a fracture,
and how to improve your bone strength.
Osteoporosis is, to a large degree, preventable, but it takes years 
of planning to prevent it. Although it may be too late to prevent
osteoporosis for some of you, others have time — time to educate
yourselves, your families, and your friends about building bone
that can stand up to the test of time without crumbling.
This book is intended to help you do just that. We wrote it with the
personal background of family history of osteoporotic fractures
and years of treating patients with osteoporosis. Remember that
we didn’t write this book to be read all the way through. If you
don’t have time or if you only want to know about a specific topic,
you can go to the section that answers your questions and under-
stand it, without having to read everything that comes before.
However, starting at the beginning may be best for you if you want
to know exactly what osteoporosis is. The textbooks say that
osteoporosis is “a disease of bony fragility, characterized by low
bone mass,” but that doesn’t really begin to explain the changes
your bones undergo when they become osteoporotic. And it cer-
tainly doesn’t describe the chaos that fragile bones can bring to
your life.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book we use the following conventions to help make every-
thing consistent and easier to understand.
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 Bold text indicates keywords in bulleted lists or highlights the
action parts of numbered steps.
 Italics identify new terms, followed by an easy-to-understand
definition.

What You’re Not to Read
Of course we want you to read everything in this book. However,
we understand that you may only want to read the essentials. So in
this section we identify the “skippable” material if you’re in such a
hurry that you can’t read everything. The following items are inter-
esting to read, but not essential for you to understand and cope
with osteoporosis:
 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are shaded boxes that appear
throughout the book. They sometimes share fun facts, but
nothing that’s vital to you understanding osteoporosis.
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached: This informa-
tion is interesting, but you won’t break a bone if you skip it.
 The stuff on the copyright page: Although the Library of
Congress may find this text fascinating, we doubt you’ll find
anything that enthralling in the legal language. Feel free to
pass over it.
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, we make a few assumptions about you,
our dear reader. Those assumptions include the following:
 You or someone you know has been diagnosed with osteo-
porosis, or you’re concerned about osteoporosis prevention.
 You want to know about both osteoporosis prevention and
treatments.
 You want to know what to expect when you break a bone.
 You want to know how to find the right specialists for treating
osteoporosis.
 You want to know how to treat the pain that inevitably accom-
panies a fracture.
We also assume that when you read each chapter or section, you
want quick answers on any number of issues related to osteoporo-
sis. The one theme we thread throughout every chapter and 
section is that an ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure.
Osteoporosis isn’t inevitable. Fight it hard, with all the tools at your
disposal. We hope that one day this book will be obsolete, because
osteoporosis will be a disease of the past. And when that day comes,
we’ll be dancing for joy — or doing some other weight-bearing exer-
cise to strengthen our bones!

How This Book Is Organized
We divide Osteoporosis For Dummies into four parts. You don’t
have to read them in any order. Like any For Dummies book, you
can skip to what you really need to know at the moment. The fol-
lowing sections explain how we organized this book.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones
This part starts with an explanation of what osteoporosis is, and
why it’s a serious health problem. We give you a crash course in
Bone 101, and describe who gets osteoporosis and why. We review
the most common risk factors for osteoporosis and some of the
uncommon ones, too. In addition, we talk about the osteoporosis
you don’t hear much about: osteoporosis in men and kids.
Part II: Keeping Bones Healthy
In these chapters, we give you the best ammunition possible to
fight osteoporosis. We also tell you what to eat and what types of
exercise build the strongest bones.
Part III: Diagnosing and 
Treating Osteoporosis
If you have osteoporosis, you want to get to the nitty-gritty: how
best to treat it, what the latest and best medications are, what to
do if you break a bone, and what the future holds in the diagnosis
and treatment of osteoporosis. You can find it all and more in this
part.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Sometimes you need your information in little bites that are lighter
and easier to digest. In the Part of Tens chapters, we tell you some
great ways to get your daily calcium and enjoy it at the same time,
give you ten things you need to know about bones, fill you in on
ten great resources for more bone information, and give you some
great parenting tips to help encourage your kids to take better care
of their bones.
We also share Dr. O’Connor’s list of the “questions patients ask
most often” about osteoporosis, and give you her answers. It’s like
a private doctor’s visit — without the co-pay!

Icons Used in This Book
Icons are strange little pictures that show up occasionally in the
margins in each chapter. We include them to let you know that a
topic or a bit of information is special in some way. Osteoporosis
For Dummies includes the following four icons:
The Tip icon lets you know that you’re about to read something
helpful that can save you some time or trouble.
The Remember icon highlights key points of whatever discussion
you’re reading and points out information that you really need to
consider.
Pay close attention to the information that this icon flags. It lets
you know that potentially serious trouble or problems may be lurk-
ing, but you can avoid the trouble by paying heed to our advice.
The subject of osteoporosis, of course, often runs into a great deal
of medical jargon or study findings. Although you don’t need to
know this information to tackle the basic issues of osteoporosis,
this icon points it out in case you’re interested.
Where to Go from Here
We wrote this book to be used as a resource, which means you can
pick it up, get a quick answer on whatever’s troubling you that day,
and put it down without feeling guilty about not reading an entire
section. If you’re looking for specific information, jumping around
is okay.
For example, if you just came home from your doctor’s office with
a bewildering array of prescriptions, feel free to go straight to
Chapter 10. There we describe everything you want to know about
prescription medicine commonly prescribed to treat osteoporosis,
plus a few things you may not really need to know but that are
interesting tidbits.
Are you feeling guilty about your lack of exercise routine and want-
ing to set up a simple routine that really works without setting a
single out-of-shape foot in the gym? Check out Chapter 6. We even
give you pictures because it’s a lot easier to do an exercise after
you see a picture of it.

On the other hand, if you want to discover everything you can
about osteoporosis, start reading Chapter 1 and don’t stop until
you close the book after the appendix. Don’t forget to stop for
meals and bathroom breaks. Or take a more leisurely approach,
and enjoy reading whichever chapter interests you most first. Just
like all other For Dummies books, you can pick up this book and
put it down at will. You can read a chapter a day, a chapter an hour,
or a chapter a year and still get the answers you need, when you
need them.

Part I
Understanding 
Your Bones

In this part . . .
P
ssst . . . do you want to know all about your bones?
Okay, so maybe understanding your bones doesn’t
sound all that alluring or mysterious. But after you dig up
a few bony tidbits, we think you’ll agree that bones are
complicated and fascinating. In this part, we help you dis-
cover where bones come from, what makes them strong,
and how you can make yours last a lifetime.

Chapter 1
Boning Up on Osteoporosis
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what osteoporosis really is
 Getting an early diagnosis
 Doing your best to avoid osteoporosis
 Building up your (and your children and grandchildren’s) bone density
 Dealing with osteoporosis
 Understanding the difference between osteoporosis and other diseases
Years ago, when your authors first started taking care of
patients, doctors had no way to diagnosis early osteoporosis.
By the time osteoporosis was apparent on a regular X-ray or a frac-
ture had occurred, significant bone loss had already affected the
individual. Nor did doctors have any effective drugs to treat or pre-
vent osteoporosis. We’ve come a long way, baby, in the early detec-
tion, prevention, and treatment of osteoporosis.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the problems of osteoporosis
and explain why it’s an issue affecting everyone. Even if you’re not at
risk for developing osteoporosis, you undoubtedly have a younger
loved one who is in the process of building bone. We want to help
you understand what you can do to make your bones, and those of
your loved ones, the best they can be, even if you’ve never had a
glass of milk in your adult life.
Defining Osteoporosis
What exactly is osteoporosis? The standard World Health organ-
ization (WHO) definition is that osteoporosis is “a skeletal disorder
characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a
person to an increased risk of fracture,” which is certainly a mouth-
ful, if not a particularly enlightening one. Osteoporosis is the most
common bone disease by far, but it’s a disease many people don’t
understand.

Most people think of osteoporosis only in terms of bone fractures
or loss of height, but osteoporosis is far more complicated. You’d
probably understand osteoporosis most clearly if you could see a
bone specimen affected by osteoporosis under the microscope,
but you’re not likely to ever be privy to a bone biopsy. Doctors
don’t usually perform bone biopsies in their patients to diagnosis
osteoporosis, although pathological examination of bone is still the
gold standard in diagnosing osteoporosis. Normal bone has a net-
work of strong plates and bands. In osteoporosis the bands
become thinner and weakened, and worse yet there are tiny breaks
in the plates and bands.
Another way to define osteoporosis is that osteoporosis is present
if bone mineral testing value is more than 2.5 standard deviations
below the average adult, even if there’s no history of fractures.
(See Chapter 9 for more on bone mineral density tests.)
The word “osteoporosis” actually means porous bones. If some-
thing is porous, it has holes in it. Although all bone has cavities
filled with cells and blood (see Chapter 2 for more information on
bone biology), in osteoporosis, the normal bony cavities enlarge.
When the “holes” become larger, bone becomes more fragile and
more susceptible to breaking. Minimal trauma can cause a fracture
when you have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a systemic disorder
that affects the entire skeleton.
Bone is in a constant state of remodeling; old bone is broken down
and replaced with new bone (see Chapter 2 for more on how bone
is built). Osteoporosis can occur when you lose more bone than
you rebuild, or when more bone than normal is broken down. (See
Chapter 3 for risk factors that are responsible for changes in your
bone density.)
Bone mass decreases between 1 and 5 percent per year after age 40
in women, and less than 1 percent in men. Women are more likely to
develop osteoporosis because they generally have less bone mass
to start with than men do. The sudden loss of estrogen, a sex hor-
mone that is instrumental in building healthy bone, in menopause
also contributes to women’s increased risk of osteoporosis.
Who, Me? How Osteoporosis 
May Affect You
If you’re reading this book, you may already be proactive about
your bone health. Maybe you already know that you need to
change your diet, exercise more, and take that extra calcium 
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
10

supplement. This book can help those of you who want to prevent
osteoporosis. If you already have osteoporosis, this book can
explain the ways to treat it and to prevent it from worsening.
To emphasize just how common the problem of osteoporosis is, a
recent report from the Surgeon General’s office stated that by the
year 2020, half of all Americans older than age 50 will be at risk for
fractures from osteoporosis. Of women now age 50 or older, 40 per-
cent will suffer a fracture of the hip, wrist, or spine at some point
in their lives.
Your co-author Sharon works with a population of patients who are
older than 60 years of age. Part of her job includes weighing and
measuring each patient. Invariably, nearly every person laments
that they used to be taller than they are now. (Thinner too, but
that’s another issue!)
Losing height used to be considered an inevitable part of aging,
similar to wrinkles and age spots. Most people don’t realize that
one cause of height loss is related to fractures in the spinal column
called vertebral compression fractures. Between 60 and 70 percent
of women older than age 65 have at least one of these fractures.
Even worse, studies show that 20 percent of people with a verte-
bral fracture will sustain another fracture within a year. And people
with compression fractures have a relative risk of death that is
nine times higher than their healthy counterparts.
If you’re one of the 28 million Americans who currently have osteo-
porosis, or one of the 18 million who have low bone mass and are
likely to develop osteoporosis in the future, don’t despair! Even if
you’ve already broken a bone or two, you can take some steps to
decrease your odds of fracture in the future. This book can help
you implement those changes in your life.
Looking more closely at the 
numbers: How serious is 
osteoporosis?
Statistics related to osteoporosis are staggering. Consider just a
few from the 2004 Surgeon General’s report:
 Around 1.5 million people have a fracture related to osteo-
porosis each year.
 Hip fractures are responsible for 300,000 hospitalizations each
year.
Chapter 1: Boning Up on Osteoporosis 11

 Up to 700,000 vertebral compression fractures and 250,000
wrist fractures occur in the United States each year.
 The cost for treating osteoporotic fractures each year is
around $18 billion — $38 million a day.
 Approximately 20 percent of seniors who suffer a hip fracture
will die within one year.
 Around 20 percent of seniors with a hip fracture will be in a
nursing home within a year.
 White women older than age 65 are twice as likely to fracture
something as African American women. Latino women’s frac-
ture rates fall between the two groups.
A woman’s risk of hip fracture is equal to her risk of develop-
ing breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer combined.
 By the year 2050, men will have one half of all hip fractures in
the United States.
Defeating fragility fractures 
before they occur
You can’t see or feel changes in your bone strength over time. 
In other words, osteoporosis is a disease without warning signs.
After you’ve experienced your first fragility fracture, a fracture that
occurs after an event that normally wouldn’t be traumatic enough
to cause a fracture, you’ve already lost a significant amount of
bone density.
Fragility fractures are strong predictors for another fracture in the
future. If you have a fragility fracture, you need thorough evaluation
and treatment by someone who specializes in osteoporosis (see
Chapter 8 for more on choosing a doctor to treat osteoporosis).
The first outward sign of osteoporosis could be a devastating hip
fracture or spinal compression fracture. But you can avoid these
breaks. How, you may ask?
Your doctor can detect osteoporosis before that first break! A simple
new kind of X-ray known as Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA),
also known as bone densitometry, can measure your bone density.
Your doctor then uses this information to predict the likelihood of a
future fragility fracture. (See Chapter 9 for more information about
DXA scans.)
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
12

After you’ve had a baseline bone mineral density test, your doctor
may ask you to repeat the test every two years to see how your
bones are holding up to the stress of aging.
Uncovering the relationship between
aging and osteoporosis
Bones, like Rome, weren’t built in a day. It takes years to build up
your bone density, and your behaviors, both good and bad, during
the time of peak bone development can impact the amount of bone
you end up with.
Your bones actually remodel and reshape themselves throughout
your lifetime, something that most people don’t even notice until
something goes wrong. You may wonder why a process that seems
to progress painlessly (with any luck at all) from birth to around
age 45 suddenly seems to fall apart at the bones, as it were.
By the time you reach the age of 35 or so, you’ve amassed all the
bone you’ll ever have. Several factors, such as heredity, your diet,
your exercise levels, and whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or
have any other “bad” habits, determine your peak bone mass. (See
Chapter 3 for more on determining your risk factors.)
After age 35, you can maintain the bone mass you already have,
but you can’t increase your peak bone mass. For women, the start
of menopause, with its sudden drop in estrogen is the start of
accelerated bone loss. For men, bone loss happens later in life.
(Check out Chapter 4 for more on men and osteoporosis.)
Suddenly the bone you’re building isn’t keeping pace with the bone
that’s being broken down. The various medications used to treat
osteoporosis affect this delicate balance. (See Chapter 10 for more
on osteoporosis and medications). You can also achieve improve-
ment in bone strength by doing weight-bearing exercises (see
Chapter 6) and by taking in enough calcium and vitamin D (see
Chapter 5).
Why Early Diagnosis 
Is So Important
The earlier you start preventing and treating osteoporosis, the
better your chances of preserving bone. Waiting until you’ve
broken a bone and then trying to “catch up” on bone strength 
isn’t nearly as effective as building good bone in your early years.
Chapter 1: Boning Up on Osteoporosis 13

Unfortunately, the peak bone-building years coincide with the
years where people sometimes ignore health issues. Given that
most 25-year-olds aren’t terribly concerned with their bones, the
next best way to get people to pay attention to their bones is to
diagnose problems early enough to catch and treat little problems
before they become big ones.
Keep a close eye on your young children and grandchildren. Even
though kids do break bones, it doesn’t mean they have osteoporo-
sis. In fact, not all fractures are a fragility fracture. However, a child
who breaks several bones within a year needs to be tested for pos-
sible bone disease (see Chapter 4 for more on children and osteo-
porosis), unless the child in question has a propensity for jumping
off roofs or otherwise taking increased risks.
If you have known risk factors, such as long-term use of corticos-
teroids or a strong family history of osteoporosis, don’t wait until
you’re wearing your first cast to find out if you have osteoporosis.
Talk to your doctor and ask to have a baseline bone density test,
and make sure that your diet includes the recommended amount
of calcium and vitamin D for your age group. And don’t forget to
exercise! (Remember that bone loss occurs every year after
menopause unless you’re taking steps to prevent it.)
Many situations increase your risk for developing osteoporosis.
Knowing some of them can get you started off in the right direction
for an early diagnosis and prevention. Some important risk factors
are in the following list:
 Chronic illnesses, such as liver or kidney disease
 Chronic use of corticosteroids, such as prednisone
 Difficulty absorbing nutrients due to problems with your
stomach or intestines
 Estrogen or testosterone deficiencies
 Excessive use of tobacco or alcohol
 Low body weight
 Periods of immobilization
Improving Your Peak Bone 
Density — And Your Children’s
If more Americans truly practiced prevention instead of searching
for a cure after the inevitable has happened, everyone would be a
lot healthier.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
14

This statement is as true with osteoporosis as with other diseases.
For example, if people spent 1⁄100 of the time trying to build a good
peak bone density up to age 25 or 30, many of them wouldn’t have
to worry about what drug to take to cure their osteoporosis.
Your bone density potential is partly determined by hereditary fac-
tors, and partly by environmental factors. Many experts today are
especially concerned that today’s children are going to suffer from
osteoporosis due to a number of problems. What are they?
 Children spend more time sitting (as in front of the computer)
and less time exercising.
 Children spend more time indoors and therefore receive less
exposure to vitamin D, a vitamin necessary for bones.
 Teenage girls usually have to deal with peer pressure to stay
as thin as possible.
 Children are substituting soft drinks for milk.
 More teens are smoking.
 Some teenage girls also exercise too strenuously, attempting
to keep weight down or to attain success in weight-driven
sports, such as ballet or gymnastics. (See Chapter 4 for more
on this condition known as female athlete triad.)
Studies show that adolescents who take in less than 1,000 milli-
grams of calcium daily (boys) and 850 milligrams (girls) of calcium
won’t achieve their optimal bone mass.
If you’re already older than 30, you can try and build strong bones
in your children and grandchildren by encouraging them to get up
off their bottoms and go outside and run around. (See Chapter 4
for more about children and osteoporosis.) You can feed them —
and yourself — nutritious meals and set a good example by drink-
ing your milk. In fact, teens make nearly one-third of their spinal
peak bone mass during adolescence, yet their eating habits often
aren’t focused upon bone building, especially among teenage girls
concerned about their weight.
Certainly knowing your family history is important. Look at your
family photographs for changes in your relatives’ spines. If you
know that your grandma and mom both had osteoporosis, make
sure that you avoid the dangerous habits of cigarette smoking and
excess alcohol consumption.
Chapter 1: Boning Up on Osteoporosis 15

Evaluating Osteoporosis Therapy
The goal of therapy for osteoporosis is to reduce fractures, because
fractures do much more than break bone. Fractures can change a
person’s life, or possibly end it prematurely. In fact, people who
suffer from hip fractures have a higher chance of dying because the
surgery increases your risk of getting pneumonia or blood clots in
your lungs. The pain and suffering from osteoporosis costs billions
of dollars of treatment in the United States alone.
All treatment, whether it be preventive or therapeutic and whether
it involves taking medication or just getting up off the couch and
exercising, is aimed at preventing fractures caused by weak bones.
Unfortunately studies in the United States have shown that many
patients who have had a hip fracture weren’t tested or treated for
osteoporosis.
This book tells you about how doctors can diagnose osteoporosis
early and how they can treat osteoporosis. Hence, we’re delighted
that you’ve decided to read our book and bone up on osteoporo-
sis, because our goal is to prevent the breaks that can shatter far
more than just bone. (Check out Chapter 9 that focuses on testing
your bones and Chapter 10 that focuses on different prescription
medications to help your osteoporotic bones.)
Terminology 101: Keeping 
Your “Osteos” Straight
The word “osteo” is derived from the Greek word for bone. Many
medical conditions and terms start with this same Greek word, and
they focus on bones. However, the different “osteo” conditions
really have little to do with one another. In this section we try to
help you determine the differences between osteoporosis and the
other “osteos” you may encounter.
Osteoarthritis: It hurts, 
but it’s not osteoporosis
Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis are both common conditions in
people older than 65, but these two conditions are completely dif-
ferent problems.
Osteoarthritis is a problem that affects your joints. It results from
the loss of the cartilage that acts as a cushion between the joints 
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
16

of your bones. Osteoarthritis causes pain in your joints and has
nothing to do with osteoporosis, even though both words start
with “osteo.” Perhaps, if the medical community used the phrase
“degenerative joint disease,” for osteoarthritis, people wouldn’t
confuse the two.
More than 20 million Americans have osteoarthritis; before age 
45, more men than women have osteoarthritis, but after age 55,
osteoarthritis affects more women than men.
The joints most commonly affected in osteoarthritis are certain
joints in the fingers, feet, spine, hips, and knees. Repeated trauma
to the joints can cause osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis causes pain
and stiffness in the joints; swelling and warmth can also occur. 
If you have pain and stiffness in your joints after sitting for long 
periods, you could have osteoarthritis. Sometimes a consultation
with a rheumatologist is necessary for confirmation. (Refer to www.
rheumatology.org to see exactly what a rheumatologist does.)
Treatment for osteoarthritis includes anti-inflammatory drugs,
such as ibuprofen (Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve), aspirin, or 
acetaminophen (Tylenol). Physical therapy, mild exercise, and
weight loss, if you’re overweight, can also help osteoarthritis.
Osteomalacia: So why exactly 
did that bone break?
Osteomalacia is an illness that also causes fragility fractures, but
it’s much less common than osteoporosis. If you have a broken
bone, you may think quibbling about whether your fracture was
caused by osteoporosis or osteomalacia is silly. But the treatment
for each can be different, so you and your doctor need to know
which condition is affecting your bones.
Osteomalacia is primarily a disorder of decreased bone mineraliza-
tion. Your doctor can diagnose osteomalacia with a bone biopsy 
or by history, physical examination, laboratory, and radiological 
studies.
So what exactly are the differences between the two? Osteoporosis
usually occurs in a population with certain risk factors; they’re
postmenopausal women, people older than age 65, or patients 
who have been on long-term corticosteroid therapy. Osteoporosis
patients generally have normal blood levels of calcium, phosphate,
vitamin D, and parathyroid hormones, to name a few. Patients with
osteomalacia may have low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and phos-
phates, and high levels of parathyroid hormones.
Chapter 1: Boning Up on Osteoporosis 17

In osteoporosis, the amount of bone mass you have is reduced,
making your bones more porous, but the mineral makeup of the
bone is normal. Because the bones have less mass, they’re fragile.
In osteomalacia, the bones themselves are soft and brittle, because
their mineral content is abnormal.
Sometimes the only way to distinguish between osteoporosis and
osteomalacia is through a bone biopsy. You can have a bone biopsy
as an outpatient procedure; typically your doctor samples a bit of
bone from your iliac crest (the bony protrusion near your hip just
below your waist).
Always remind your doctor to define your problem precisely and
consider other causes of reduced bone density.
Osteopenia warning: Falling 
bone density ahead!
Osteopenia is a word that has come to be identified with a numeri-
cal reading on your bone density. You have had some bone density
loss, but not a lot. It could be a forerunner or warning sign of fur-
ther bone loss and fractures due to bone loss.
Your doctor can diagnose osteopenia when your bone density tests
results show that you have a lower bone density than normal, but
not enough to diagnose you with osteoporosis. Dr. O’Connor remem-
bers a time when osteopenia had a different meaning. It meant that
your X-rays showed a reduction in bone density. Most doctors don’t
use osteopenia this way anymore, because they have adapted to the
terminology used in reading bone densities.
Understand that osteopenia really doesn’t tell you much about
why your bone density might be low. It’s merely a numerical value
obtained from a bone density report.
We describe bone density and the ways to test for it more thor-
oughly in Chapter 9, but a quick way to describe the difference
between osteopenia and osteoporosis is that osteopenia is a 
range of 1 to 2.5 standard deviations below the norm on a bone
density test, and anything higher than 2.5 standard deviation is
osteoporosis.

an organ similar to a heart or a kidney. In fact, the inside of your
bones are constantly changing and being remodeled. Although it
may seem that your skeleton is merely an inert support system
upon which to hang the rest of your body, this assumption couldn’t
be farther from the truth.
In this chapter, we discuss the structure, development, and func-
tion of bone: the what, why, and how of bone biology otherwise
known as BONE 101. Knowing this information can help you under-
stand your bones, how osteoporosis can affect them, and why
osteoporosis treatments are designed to do what they do. You
need to understand normal bone before you can understand what
can go wrong.
Understanding Your 
Living Skeleton
When most people think of a skeleton, they often think of a
Halloween skeleton — inactive with no life. However, similar to 
all other parts of your body, bone is very much alive, composed 
of cells and the material made by those cells. In this chapter, we

explain why your bone is beautiful. It functions in an amazing way
to provide strength and stability for the skeleton; yet, in spite of 
its strength, it’s light and flexible. Bone changes under mechanical
stress, it undergoes repair, and it’s periodically replaced.
Your co-author Sharon remembers reading a horror story many
years ago about a ghoul that sucked the bones out of its victims,
leaving them flopping on the ground like helpless, albeit talking,
jellyfish. This story is only partly accurate, because without bones
people would be very similar to jellyfish, but they would be dead
jellyfish, because bones manufacture things that people can’t live
without.
Bone has so many characteristics. It grows. It remodels itself. It
contains a marrow cavity that makes blood cells. Unfortunately, it
can break under pressure. At the risk of making you feel as though
you’re in an anatomy and physiology class, we want you to have 
a basic understanding of how your bones work. After you under-
stand what makes bones work, you can better understand — and
avoid — the problems that prevent bones from doing their job.
Although bones in your skeleton look inert; in reality, they’re very
busy — all the time. They have a number of functions to carry out
to keep you alive and well. Bones provide
 Agility: Bones, in conjunction with their closest attachments,
muscles and joints, enable you to get off the couch and do
some physical activity. (Oh, you’ve been stuck on the couch
for some time? Sorry, but lifting the remote to change the
channel doesn’t constitute exercise.)
 Production of blood cells: Your bone marrow produces
important blood cells including red blood cells, platelets, and
some white blood cells.
• Red blood cells carry oxygen around your body.
• Platelets help clot your blood and keep you from bleed-
ing to death from a paper cut.
• White blood cells fight off foreign invaders, such as your
neighbor’s cold germs.
 Protection: Bones shield you from things that could hurt your
delicate insides, such as flying objects, walls, and even floors.
Without bones, your brain would literally be mush, because it
would be severely damaged every time you laid down to
sleep. Your heart would literally break every time you picked
up a “dangerous” object — like your 20-pound grandchild —
and held him or her to your chest.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
20

 Storage: Think of your bones as a bank that stores vital miner-
als, such as calcium and phosphorus. For example, your body
needs to maintain a constant level of calcium in the blood so
that the rest of your cells can function properly. If you have a
disease where calcium blood levels drop, the bone architec-
ture serves as a reservoir for calcium.
 Support: Your skeletal system is strong enough to support the
upright posture, yet not so heavy as to preclude running and
walking.
Meeting Your Bones
There’s a lot more to your bones than first meets the eye. Most of
you, unless you’re a surgeon or have ever had a compound frac-
ture, have never actually seen a live human bone. You may have
seen a human skeleton at a museum, but the bone you see there
looks dry and boring, not to mention inactive.
The bones you see at a museum are dead. Your bones are alive, 
and if you could get a bird’s-eye view of all the cellular-level activ-
ity taking place every day, you would have new respect for your
bones. They’re more productive than any factory on the planet!
Chapter 2: Loving the Living Tissue Called Bone 21
You’re not freaky: Looking 
at unusual bones
Most of you have the same number of bones, which is 206. (Did you remember that
number or did you have to pull out your high school biology notes?) But some of you
may be lucky enough to have a few extra here and there. Extra bones are generally
one of two types: Wormian (also known as sutural, which certainly sounds nicer)
and sesmoid bones.
 Wormian bones are small clusters of bones found between the joints of some
cranial bones.
 Sesmoid bones are in tendons in areas of pressure, such as the wrist or ankle.
Not to confuse you too much, but one type of sesmoid bone, the patella, or
kneecap, is normally found in everybody.
Your co-author Sharon knows sesmoid bones well. She had one removed from her
foot after it caused recurring tendonitis and made walking from point A to point B
difficult. The tendency to have extra bones is hereditary, and almost everyone in
Sharon’s family has this same extra bone in the same place.

Looking at the different 
types of bones
Although bones contain the same basic structure, they differ in
appearance and function. Generally, two types of tissue comprise
bones:
 Cortical: Also called compact bone, cortical bone is dense.
 Trabecular: Also called spongy bone, trabecular bone is light-
weight and porous, because it contains many little holes.
Most bones contain both cortical and trabecular tissue. Check out
“Examining the innards and outards of your bones” later in this
chapter for more on cortical and trabecular bones.
Furthermore, bones fall into four different category types, listed
and defined in the following bulleted list.
 Long bones are merely longer than they are wide, but they
aren’t necessarily all that long. Some of the bones in fingers
and toes are long bones even though they’re really fairly
short. Other long bones, such as the femur in your thigh and
the humerus in your arm, are fairly long. Long bones are com-
posed of mostly cortical bone.
 Short bones are actually more cube shaped. Most short bones
consist of trabecular tissue. Your wrist and ankle contain
short bones.
 Flat bones are thin and provide protection to underlying
important parts like your brain and heart. Ribs, sternum, and
shoulder blades are all flat bones. So is your skull. Trust us on
this one. Although your skull is curved, it’s made out of flat
bones. Flat bones are generally cortical bone with a spongy
center.
 Irregular bones are bones that don’t fit in any other category,
like your vertebrae and some of your facial bones. Irregular
bones are mostly made up of trabecular tissue.
Examining the innards and 
outards of your bones
Cortical bone surrounds bones and makes up 75 percent of your
total skeletal mass. The bone inside the shell, trabecular bone, is
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
22

composed of plates and rods that are arranged in a network of 
patterns that provide maximum strength with minimum bulk. (See
Figure 2-1.) Most bones contain both types of tissue, but the pro-
portions may vary from bone to bone. Cortical bone predominates
in your arms, ribs, and legs. It also regenerates itself rather slowly,
about 2 to 3 percent a year.
You primarily find trabecular bone in the spine, pelvis, and hip. The
relative hollowness of trabecular bone makes it more vulnerable to
certain problems related to bone metabolism, such as osteoporo-
sis, hyperparathyroidism, or calcium deficiencies. (See Chapter 7
for further discussion of metabolic bone diseases.) Trabecular bone
makes up about 20 percent of your bone mass and regenerates
more rapidly than cortical bone — about 25 percent a year com-
pared to 3 percent for cortical bone.
Over the course of a lifetime, women may lose about 40 percent
and men between 15 and 40 percent of their trabecular bone.
Women lose 30 to 40 percent of cortical bone, while men lose 
5 to 15 percent.
Figure 2-1: Bones contain two types of bone tissue: trabecular and cortical, or
compact. Compact bone is the dense outer shell, whereas trabecular bone is the
lighter inner portion of bone.

Chapter 2: Loving the Living Tissue Called Bone 23

Chemically speaking, all bone is composed of a crystal-like structure
that is bound to proteins. These crystals are composed of minerals
(predominately calcium and phosphorus) arranged in an orderly
structure referred to as hydroxyapatite. These crystals are bound to
the protein matrix that is composed primarily of collagen molecules.
Although you may think of collagen as primarily a magic substance
to plump up lips or send wrinkles to never-neverland, collagen is
actually a protein that works as the “foundation” that holds your
skin, tendon, bone, cartilage, and connective tissue together. There
are several types of collagen. The major collagen in bone is type I
collagen.
This composition provides both strength and resiliency. Another
way of thinking about this is to imagine a scaffold (consisting of
cross-linked collagen molecules) upon which crystals are
deposited in an orderly fashion.
There can be problems with collagen formation. For example, 
when the body makes abnormal type I collagen molecules, a severe
genetic form of osteoporosis, known as osteogenesis imperfecta, 
can result. See Chapter 7 for more information on this illness. When
there are problems in the way minerals deposit on bone, another
bone problem called osteomalacia (see Chapter 1) can develop.
Modeling and Remodeling
During childhood, bones grow in length and change their shapes
through a process called modeling. New bone forms on the outside
of the cortex, while the inside of the bone is resorbed (a special
term that refers to removal of bone tissue).
After a person has reached her maximum height, the process con-
tinues so that small injuries can be repaired. Old bone is removed
and new bone is made; however, the formation and resorption are
more closely coupled.
Basically, when you’re an adult, during the remodeling process,
bone is removed and replaced at the same site. This occurs on the
surface of the trabecule (trabecular bone) or on the inside of the
cortex (cortical bone). An amazing fact to mull over about your
bones is that the adult skeleton is completely replaced every ten
years!
Now that you have some knowledge of how your bones are struc-
tured, to further understand how this information deals with 
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
24

osteoporosis, you need to know three important pieces: what
builds up bones, what breaks them down, and what keeps the
breaking down and building up in balance. The next section
explains these processes.
Building Up and Breaking Down:
Your Bones Day by Day
As we state earlier in the chapter, bone is constantly reshaping
itself in a complex process of building and remodeling. You don’t
notice this reshaping because it happens on a microscopic level.
The major players involved in bone building and remodeling are
 The cells: Osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes
 The hormones: The directors of cellular function
 The essential minerals: Most commonly calcium and 
phosphorus
Blasts, clasts, and cytes (oh my)
An intricate balance between the activities of two major cell types
referred to as the osteoblast and osteoclast determine a person’s
total bone mass.
An easy way to remember the work of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and
osteocytes is
Osteoblasts giveth.
Osteoclasts taketh away.
Osteocytes maintaineth.
Osteoblasts are the builders and make collagen and hydroxyapatite.
Some of the osteoblasts become buried in their matrix and then
they are referred to as osteocytes. The rest of the osteoblasts cover
the new bone’s surface (see Figure 2-2). Waves of osteoblasts that
move into the area form new layers of bone.
Osteoclasts are larger cells whose function is to dissolve bone by
acting on the mineral matrix. They make enzymes such as collage-
nase, which breaks down collagen. Osteoclasts also secrete vari-
ous acids that can dissolve the hydroxyapatite structure.
Chapter 2: Loving the Living Tissue Called Bone 25

Figure 2-2: Osteoblasts build up bone; osteoclasts break down bone.
There are a variety of signals that control the function of osteoblasts
and osteoclasts. Interestingly, osteoblasts make small proteins, one
of which is called OPG (osteoprotegrin). OPG can prevent osteo-
clasts from being activated. Osteoblasts change their shape and
become buried in their matrix, connected to each other only by thin
processes called canaliculi. After the osteoblasts are buried in bone,
they’re referred to as osteocytes. Osteocytes account for 90 percent
of all cells in the skeleton.
Bone remodeling starts with resorption, which the osteoclasts
orchestrate. Osteoclasts break down bone by dissolving mineral
and resorbing the matrix that osteoblasts have formed. Refer to
Figure 2-2.
More research into the function of these cells will undoubtedly
result in new drugs to treat osteoporosis. Scientists now under-
stand that the process of building up bone and resorption of bone
is critical because abnormalities in these processes lead to bone
diseases.
Fine-tuning your bones 
with hormones
Hormones are the directors of the entire process of keeping bone
in proper balance. Many hormones contribute to the balance, but
the hormones in this section are the most important.

Vitamin D
Vitamin D is a critical hormone that you need for proper bone min-
eralization. The body mainly absorbs it through your skin from
sunlight, although you do absorb some through the stomach by
way of diet and supplements.
When vitamin D is absorbed in the skin, it’s an inactive hormone
and requires special changes that occur in both the kidney and
liver. Certain drugs interfere with vitamin D metabolism and there-
fore cause soft fragile bone. Vitamin D deficiency can also occur
from a poor diet and lack of exposure to sunlight.
Vitamin D has many important functions in addition to its role in
mineralization. For example, vitamin D helps to maintain normal
blood levels of calcium by promoting calcium absorption in the
intestine. Hence, vitamin D helps keep bones from becoming thin,
brittle, or misshapen. An adequate amount of vitamin D (see
Chapter 5 for more on vitamin D in foods) in your diet or through
vitamin D supplements prevents rickets in children (see Chapter 4
for more on rickets) and osteomalacia, a condition where bones
are soft and brittle, in adults. (Refer to Chapter 11 on taking vita-
min D supplements.)
Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
Parathyroid hormone (also known as PTH) is another key director.
The parathyroid gland, which is actually a set of four small glands
located near your thyroid gland, produces this hormone.
PTH provides for the exquisite regulation of calcium metabolism.
For example, when the serum level of calcium drops, the parathy-
roid gland synthesizes more hormone. PTH instructs the kidney 
to hold onto more calcium. It also directs how much calcium is
allowed to be stored in the bone.
Basically, PTH is the traffic director of calcium, regulating how
much calcium you absorb with your diet, how much calcium 
your kidneys secrete, and how much calcium your bones store.
Osteoblasts have receptors for PTH. When these receptors are
activated, the osteoblasts make less OPG. This small molecule 
in turn regulates the activity of osteoclasts.
Calcitonin
Calcitonin, a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, inhibits 
bone removal by osteoclasts, and promotes bone formation by
Chapter 2: Loving the Living Tissue Called Bone 27

osteoblasts. Calcitonin is also one of the older drugs used to 
treat osteoporosis. (See Chapter 10 for more on drugs that treat 
osteoporosis.)
Estrogen
Estrogen is a hormone that is instrumental in regulating women’s
menstrual cycles. Estrogen also works with the parathyroid glands
to keep calcium levels in balance. The drop in estrogen levels at
menopause is one of the reasons why women begin to develop
osteoporosis.
Estrogen deficiency is one of the most important factors in the
development of bone fragility. For some reason, estrogen defi-
ciency results in the production of more osteoclasts and more
active osteoclasts. (Check out Chapter 10 for more on estrogen.)
Testosterone
Although you may associate the hormone testosterone with men,
both men and women produce testosterone. Testosterone helps
maintain strong bone and muscles, and stimulates bone formation.
Testosterone deficiency clearly is associated with osteoporosis.
(Refer to Chapter 10 for more on testosterone.)
Orchestrating bone growth 
with minerals
The two most important minerals your body needs to orchestrate
bone growth are calcium and phosphorus. Calcium is the most
common mineral found in your body and contributes to bone
strength. Remember that the crystal hydroxyapatite is composed
of calcium. (Check out “Examining the innards and outards of your
bones” earlier in this chapter for more about hydroxyapatite.)
Osteoblasts add calcium to your bones, and doctors don’t com-
pletely understand just how the crystals are formed. Osteoclasts
remove calcium from your bones. In fact, an interesting tidbit: The
206 bones in your body contain about three pounds of calcium!
Also, remember that when the rest of your body needs calcium,
the bone tissue will supply it and the integrity of your bones may
suffer as a result!
Phosphorus is the second most important mineral found in your
body, because it’s the other major component of hydroxyapatite.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
28

Your bones and teeth store approximately 85 percent of the 
phosphorus.
Phosphorus and calcium work together to build healthy bones.
Your body attempts to achieve a balanced ratio of calcium to phos-
phorus. When this balance is disrupted, various bone diseases can
result. Too little or too much phosphorus is harmful. Many other
cells use phosphorus, like calcium, to keep you healthy.
Although an adequate amount of phosphorus is not only good but
also essential to getting through the day, an excess amount of
phosphorus can be detrimental. A diet high in phosphorus, such
as a high-protein diet or a high intake of soft drinks, can decrease
calcium in your bones because the excess phosphorus looks for
calcium to bind to, removing it from bone if necessary. Many
American diets contain too much phosphorus in sodas and not
enough calcium.
Your Bones from Birth to Infinity:
More Stuff to Know
Did you know that babies actually have more bones than adults do,
because some of their bones haven’t fused yet and can be counted
as two or three? Most adults have 206 bones, but your bones at
birth numbered more than 300! Babies and young children also
have somewhat bendable bones, so they may have more greenstick
fractures, which are breaks that occur when bones bend but don’t
break completely.
This section includes a few more interesting tidbits to know about
your bones:
 Bones continue to grow in length and breadth until your late
teens or early 20s. Hence bone biologists have developed the
term “peak bone mass.” This phrase refers to the amount of
bony tissue present at the end of skeletal maturation. Your
peak bone mass increases throughout adolescence and then
peaks in your early 30s. It plateaus for a while and then (for
women) starts to decline after menopause. Men start to decline
in their 60s. (You can read more about men and osteoporosis in
Chapter 4.)
Factors such as your genetic makeup, nutrition, and activity
determine your peak bone mass. Various diseases also can
affect your peak bone mass. Understanding the factors that
Chapter 2: Loving the Living Tissue Called Bone 29

determine peak bone mass are critical in determining ways 
to prevent osteoporosis, because if you can build stronger
bones, even though some bone is lost during aging, you may
not have enough bone loss to result in osteoporosis. (Check
out Chapter 3 for more discussion on risk factors.)
Your peak bone mass is represented in Figure 2-3 by a bone
density measurement. These graphs are different for men and
women and are different for different races. This data comes
from a large epidemiological study referred to as the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
After you’ve achieved your peak height, your bones continue
to remodel on the inside surfaces. In fact, osteoclasts and
osteoblasts keep doing their thing. So, if the balance of break-
ing down and building up is disturbed, you can lose some
bone mass.
 Bones respond to forces placed upon them. For example, an
athlete who uses his right arm far more often than his left, will
develop thicker cortical bone on the right side when compared
to the left.

and race.

 Bone mass is often compared to a bank account. Up until a
certain age you’re putting more in than you’re taking out. But
as you age, your withdrawals begin to exceed your deposits,
and you begin to lose bone.
 In women, bone loss accelerates after menopause because
estrogen levels drop. Women who go through menopause at
an earlier age, due to chemotherapy or hormonal disorders,
are at higher risk for osteoporosis because they have fewer
years to benefit from the protective effects of estrogen.
After you reach menopause and lose the protective benefit of
higher estrogen levels, your bone withdrawals increase dra-
matically. You can lose as much as 5 percent of your bone
mass each year during the first five years of menopause.
 Men also lose bone mass as they age, but at a much slower
rate, normally 0.2 to 0.5 percent per year.

Risk Factors
In This Chapter

 Eyeing ways to lower the risks
A
lthough men do get osteoporosis (see Chapter 4 for more on
men and osteoporosis), many more women have osteoporo-
sis. In fact, just being female is your highest risk for osteoporosis.
But other factors — family history, your medical history, and your
habits, good and bad, also affect your chance of developing osteo-
porosis, whether you’re male or female.
To predict the likelihood of developing osteoporosis, you may be
tempted to focus mainly on family history, assuming that if your
90-year-old grandmother is still taller than you are and has better
posture than you have, your chances of developing osteoporosis
are slim. On the other hand, if your female relatives have owned
more walkers, canes, and casts than the average medical supply
store, you may believe that you’re also destined to experience frac-
tures due to weak bones.
Although family history is important, it’s only one factor that
determines how likely you are to develop osteoporosis. Both

heredity and environment are important when assessing — and
reducing — your risk. In this chapter, we compile all the factors
that contribute to osteoporosis in women, from hereditary and
lifestyle factors to medications and medical conditions.
Assessing Your Risk Factors:
Which Women Get Osteoporosis?
Many factors can contribute to your chances of developing osteo-
porosis. Some factors you can influence, some you can’t. In this
section, we look at the most common risk factors and what you
can do to modify them.
Your doctor can evaluate your chances of having low bone density
based on your risk factors and request specialized testing to
screen you for osteoporosis before you actually get a fracture. (See
Chapter 9 for the specifics on testing.)
I am woman, see me shrink
When it comes to osteoporosis, being female is a definite black
mark. Men start with more bone mass, and they also lose bone 
at a slower rate than women. In fact, according to the National
Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), 80 percent of osteoporosis suffer-
ers are women.
Moreover, according to the American Medical Association (AMA),
between 20 and 30 percent of women who have gone through
menopause have osteoporosis, and another 30 percent have low
bone density. If you add up the percentages, you realize that the
vast majority of women are at risk. For 8 million women, osteoporo-
sis is a fact, and for another 15 million, it’s a looming possibility.
Why do women get all the breaks (so to speak)? In part, the risk is
due to normally thinner bones, and partly because the loss of
estrogen at menopause accelerates bone loss, especially for the
first five to seven years.
So, the biggest single risk factor for developing osteoporosis is
simply being female. And, of course, your gender is one thing
about yourself that is impossible to change.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
34

Aging is such sweet sorrow
Another unchangeable risk of osteoporosis is age. As difficult as it
is to accept, getting older brings not only wrinkles but also the
possibility of osteoporosis. Up until her mid-30s, a woman builds
more bone than she loses. But after age 35, bone withdrawals start
to deplete her bone credit account. Here are several interesting
statistics from the AMA about age and bone fractures:
 One out of two women older than 50 will have a bone fracture
related to osteoporosis.
 A 50-old woman has a 14 percent risk of hip fracture over the
remainder of her lifetime.
 Ninety-plus percent of hip fractures in elderly women are due
to osteoporosis.
 One out of five women older than age 50 with a hip fracture
will die within one year.
Other factors, however, make some women’s risk greater than
others. Similar to age and gender, some can’t be changed. Others,
such as habits, both good and bad, can be. We take a look at both
in the next sections.
Blaming it on the family
So the specific question is exactly where do you come from? That’s
not just a question for your genealogy search; it’s an important
issue to assess in determining your odds of having osteoporosis.
Do you remember when you used to look up to your mom, and
now you’re looking down on her head instead? Loss of height is a
sign of osteoporosis, and a good way to tell if this disease runs in
your family — just look through the family album and see if great-
grandma got shorter every year. Osteoporosis can be a family
affair; if a close female relative had fractures related to osteoporo-
sis, your risks of having osteoporosis are increased, especially if
osteoporosis occurred on your mother’s side of the family.
It can be frightening to look through a series of pictures and realize
that your loved one has become a fraction of her former self; you
may start worrying about how many inches you might lose if you
develop osteoporosis. Those of you who are short to begin with
worry especially about getting shorter! The truth is that a person
Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 35

can lose up to eight inches of height from vertebral compression
fractures, or fractures of the spine. Average height loss is around
three inches. (See Chapters 7 and 13 for more on vertebral com-
pression and other types of fractures.)
Researchers have been conducting extensive genetic studies to fur-
ther identify genes that predispose to lower peak bone mineral den-
sity and accelerated bone loss in menopause. Perhaps in years to
come, DNA testing in adolescence can accurately predict the risk.
But for now, researchers can only rely on some results about who
is more predisposed to osteoporosis. Here are some of the more
interesting findings:
 Caucasian and Asian women, on average, have bone den-
sity 5 to 10 percent lower than women of African American,
Mediterranean, or Latino descent. This statistic doesn’t mean
that only Caucasian and Asian women develop osteoporosis,
just that their risk is higher overall.
 Are you a blonde or redhead? (No, we’re not going to tell a
blonde joke!) Women with fair skin and light hair are also at
higher risk for developing osteoporosis. Thin women with
narrow hips also have a higher risk of osteoporosis. (We dis-
cuss weight in the next section).
 Does premature gray hair run in your family? Some studies
have indicated that people who start to go gray in their 20s,
and are more than 50 percent gray by age 40, have a higher
risk of having osteoporosis.
Don’t worry too much. Just because you were blonde in your 20s,
turned gray prematurely in your 30s, and are a 100-pound Caucasian
doesn’t mean you’re going to get osteoporosis. You just have a
higher risk. As a precaution, talk with your doctor about taking cal-
cium and vitamin D supplements. Discuss with your doctor your
risks for osteoporosis. He can advise you on further treatment.
(See Chapter 11 for info on supplements.)
Weighty issues
If you’re a small and narrow-hipped size two, it’s likely that you
haven’t achieved as high a peak bone density as women who are
heavier. Small, thin women generally have small, thin bones, and
are more prone to osteoporosis fractures. Some studies are even
more specific and say that if you weigh less than 127 pounds at any
height, you’re prone to osteoporosis.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
36

Although being naturally small and thin is a risk factor in itself,
dieting during adolescence seems to increase your risk of osteo-
porosis. Excessive dieting may lead to inadequate calcium
intake; most research shows that calcium is essential for build-
ing normal bone during childhood and adolescence.
Women with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia are espe-
cially at risk for osteoporosis, according to some studies. They
may be two to three times as prone to bone fractures, and the
risk may persist throughout their lifetime, if peak bone mass was
affected. (See Chapter 4 for more on anorexia and bulimia.)
If you diet or exercise excessively, your menstrual periods may
stop altogether. When this happens, you may also develop an
estrogen deficiency. In extreme cases, even young women can
develop osteoporosis and fractures (see more about osteoporo-
sis in adolescents in Chapter 4).
Your body mass index (BMI) is one way of assessing your risk by
weight. (BMI is a formula that takes your height and weight to
estimate your body fat.) A body mass index of 20 or less is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of osteoporosis. See Table 3-1.
Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 37
We remember broken bones: 
Our personal family histories
One of your co-author Sharon’s earliest memories of her maternal great-grand-
mother was the cast on her arm. She had one of the commonest fractures of osteo-
porosis, a broken wrist, (in medical lingo: a Colles’ fracture). Years later, Sharon’s
children remember their great-grandma, daughter of the first, using a walker after
she broke her hip. She also lost more than six inches of height due to vertebral com-
pression fractures (fractures of the spine).
Dr. O’Connor’s history is a little different. Her father’s mother (her paternal grand-
mother) suffered from painful spinal fractures, followed by a hip fracture. Her son,
Dr. O’Connor’s dad, had reduced bone density on a scan when he was in his 60s.
He was evaluated by a specialist in bone disease and found to have an inherited
defect of calcium metabolism called hypercalciuria, which can be treated with

Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 39

Women who are overweight have a lower risk of osteoporosis
because fat cells produce estrogen. But not many people would
consider becoming overweight just to reduce the risk of osteo-
porosis, especially when being overweight is associated with so
many other risk factors. If you’re beginning to see controlling your
weight to prevent osteoporosis as a no-win situation, you’re par-
tially right! However, other risk factors do exist that are more
easily adjusted, as you can see in the “Focusing on Lifestyle
Factors” later in this chapter.
Starting and stopping 
menstrual periods
The age when you had your first period and the age when you had
your last period are both contributors to your risk of osteoporosis.
Estrogen rises during your menstrual cycle, and estrogen helps
protect against osteoporosis.
So if your periods started when you were 12, and stopped when
you were 50, you got more estrogen over the years than someone
whose periods began when she was 16 and stopped when she was
40. You may not have thought at the time that your period was
good, but your bones appreciate all that extra estrogen exposure.
(See Chapter 10 for more on estrogen replacement therapy in
osteoporosis.)
Focusing on Lifestyle Factors
You may not be able to change your height or the (natural!) color
of your hair, but you can change some behaviors or habits that can
increase your risk of developing osteoporosis. We discuss three of
the most important in the next sections.
Smoking and osteoporosis
You know that smoking is bad for your lungs, but did you also
know that smoking is bad for your bones? Thinking that smoking, 
a habit that many people want to quit because of the well-known
effects on your lungs, can also be dangerous for your bones may
be farfetched, but the facts in the following list make it crystal
clear. Studies have shown that
 Smoking decreases the level of estrogen in women. Estrogen
helps keep bone healthy.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
40

 Women who smoke go through menopause at an earlier age;
estrogen levels drop during menopause.
 Smokers may absorb calcium poorly; calcium is necessary to
build strong bones.
 Smoking effects may begin in adolescent smokers; they may
have lower than normal bone mass and smaller bone size.
 Fractures heal more slowly in smokers — true of women 
and men.
 By age 80, smokers have bone density 6 to 10 percent lower
than nonsmokers.
 Up to one in eight hip fractures in women can be attributed to
decrease in bone density due to smoking.
 Estrogen replacement therapy in menopause is less likely to
be effective in smokers than nonsmokers.
Although studies may differ on some points, the overall evidence 
is clear. One of the best preventive measures you can take for your
bones is to never start smoking. But if you’re already a smoker, try
to quit. If you can’t quit, at least cut down. Your bones will thank
you! (If you need help to stop smoking, check out Quitting Smoking
For Dummies by David Brizer, MD [Wiley].)
How alcohol affects your bones
When the subject turns to drinking alcohol and osteoporosis, the
information is somewhat confusing. Studies show that a moderate
intake of alcohol is good for your bones, but that heavy alcohol
use is bad for your bones. How do you know what’s “too much”
and what’s “just right” when it comes to alcohol and your bones?
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines “mod-
erate” drinking as one drink per day for women and no more than
two drinks a day for men. A single drink is defined as 1.5 ounces 
of 80 proof distilled spirits, for example, 12 ounces of beer, or 5
ounces of wine. So having a glass of wine — red or white, it’s up 
to you — a day may have benefits for your bones.
One study showed that postmenopausal women who drank 16 drinks
a week had a 5 to 10 percent higher bone mass density (BMD) than
postmenopausal women who drank less than two drinks per week.
This increase in bone density may be because alcohol can help con-
vert testosterone to estrogen after menopause. Alcohol may also
increase calcitonin, a hormone that inhibits bone resorption, in
menopausal women.
Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 41

However, excessive drinking, especially during adolescence and
young adulthood, can decrease bone growth and increase one’s
risk for developing osteoporosis later in life — true for both men
and women. Even more disturbing is the fact that studies have
shown that the effects of heavy alcohol at a young age can cause
lifelong damage to your overall health, not just to your bones.
If you haven’t gone through menopause yet, heavy drinking may
cause your periods to be irregular or to stop altogether, decreasing
your estrogen levels. Adult women older than 67 years old who
drank more than 3 ounces of alcohol a day (the equivalent of six
drinks) had greater bone loss than women who drank very little
alcohol.
Of course, heavy alcohol intake also puts you at risk for one of the
biggest causes of bone fracture: falling!
Watching what you eat
We understand that watching what you eat is no fun. Even though
most people would eat a reasonably balanced diet even if they
weren’t constantly deluged with information on how what they eat
affects their health, some people would subsist mostly on cookies
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
42
What you can’t see can hurt you
Alcohol can change your body’s calcium balance in several ways. Alcohol affects
the body in several ways including:
 Alcohol can cause a vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to decreased cal-
cium absorption.
 Alcohol can increase levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which puts a strain
on your body’s calcium reserves.
 Alcohol can increase magnesium excretion, which also decreases bone health.
 Alcohol also suppresses bone formation by its toxic effect on osteoblasts, the
cells that build bone, and increases bone breakdown by stimulating the forma-
tion of osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. (See Chapter 2 for more
about bone formation, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts.)
Heavy alcohol consumption also leads to high levels of cortisol, which causes
decreased bone formation and impairs calcium absorption by increasing PTH.

and fast food if left to their own devices. This section is for you
(and you know who you are!).
Nutrition is so important to bone growth that we devote an entire
chapter to it (see Chapter 5). But we also want to throw in a few
tidbits here to demonstrate the very real connection between what
goes into your mouth and healthy bones.
Women older than 50 need at least 1,500 mg of calcium each day,
which is about 4 glasses of fortified milk (6 to 8 ounces per glass) 
a day. (A glass of milk contains about 400 mg of calcium.) See
Chapter 5 for more on calcium intake.
Equally as important to ingesting enough calcium is to make sure
you’re not losing calcium from poor dietary habits. Some calcium
robbers include
 High animal protein diet: High protein intake may increase
the amount of calcium excreted in your urine. Vegetables and
fruit, on the other hand, increase your potassium and magne-
sium intake, which builds calcium stores. Is the current low-
carb diet craze going to be bad news for women down the
road? One way to prevent bone loss is to make sure to eat
enough veggies in addition to high protein and also to main-
tain your calcium intake at 1,200 to 1,500 mg a day.
 Too much salt: A heavy hand on the saltshaker can result in
extra calcium loss.
 Sodas: Recent studies indicate that drinking dark colas daily
may result in lower bone density. Both regular and diet sodas
may have this negative affect on your bones. This loss doesn’t
occur when phosphoric acid is consumed in foods that also
contain calcium. And, of course, if you’re drinking soda, you’re
not drinking something good for you — like milk or calcium-
fortified juice. Sodas that contain caffeine may also increase
urine output, which can wash away vital mineral stores.
Recognizing Medications 
That Cause Bone Loss
Many commonly prescribed medications are a double-edged sword
for everyone, male or female. On one hand, they cure or help con-
trol serious health problems; on the other hand, the medications
themselves can cause serious health problems.
Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 43

Several commonly prescribed medications can increase your
chance of developing osteoporosis. Although we’re not suggesting
that you stop taking medications that can damage your bones, we
are suggesting that you educate yourself about your medication’s
side effects. You can take certain precautions, with your doctor
and pharmacist’s help, to decrease your risk of medication-related
osteoporosis.
Why corticosteroids can thin bones
People commonly take corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to
decrease inflammation in the body, from their eyes to their intes-
tines. If you have serious asthma, an autoimmune disease, severe
allergies, or arthritis, you may be taking corticosteroids every day.
Corticosteroids help many people live normal lives.
But corticosteroids are very potent medications with the following
serious side effects:
 They increase calcium loss through your urine.
 They decrease calcium absorption through your intestinal
tract.
 They inhibit growth of new bone.
 They lower estrogen and testosterone hormone levels.
Corticosteroids come in many different forms and under different
brand names. No matter how people take corticosteroids, all
routes lead to bone loss. (Some people inhale them for asthma and
other lung diseases, some inject them, some take them by mouth,
and others apply them as creams.)
The higher the dose of corticosteroid and the longer the time you
take it, the more likely you are to develop osteoporosis. One quar-
ter of all people who take corticosteroids for five to ten years will
suffer a fracture. Some studies have shown that you may lose up to
30 percent of bone mass after taking corticosteroids for a relatively
short time.
If you absolutely must take corticosteroids of any type long term,
doing the following is important:
 Be on the lowest dose possible.
 Reduce your dose slowly. Stopping or reducing your dose too
quickly can be dangerous.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
44

 Have your bone density tested every other year, or more fre-
quently if suggested by your doctor.
 For men, check your testosterone levels.
 Check your urine calcium.
 Discuss your concern about osteoporosis with your doctor.
Most doctors will place you on calcium and vitamin D supple-
ments if you’re on chronic corticosteroids. Your doctor may
also recommend taking them every other day.
People on long-term moderate or high doses of corticosteroids
may gain weight, develop hypertension or elevated blood sugars,
and become prone to easy bruising. This condition is referred to 
as iatrogenic (a disease caused by medical treatment) Cushing’s
syndrome. These people are at most risk for bone loss.
Avoiding excess thyroid medication
Your thyroid is an important part of your body because it helps
control your metabolism. Thyroid problems come in two varieties:
hypothyroid (sometimes called Hashimoto’s disease), or too little
thyroid hormone being manufactured, and hyperthyroid (some-
times called Grave’s disease), which is too much thyroid hormone.
(If you want the complete lowdown on thyroid disease, check out
Thyroid For Dummies by Alan L. Rubin, MD [Wiley].)
If your thyroid is underactive, you may gain weight, be tired all the
time, feel cold, or have hair loss. If you have an overactive thyroid,
you may lose weight, feel like your mind is racing, have difficulty
sleeping, be jittery, and perspire more than usual.
Hyperthyroid hormone levels can increase your risk of developing
osteoporosis. Hyperthyroid can result when your thyroid produces
too much thyroid hormone or when you take more thyroid medica-
tion than you need to correct hypothyroidism.
A simple blood test ordered by your doctor can tell you whether or
not the amount of medication you’re taking is too much — or just
enough.
Calcium may interfere with absorption of your thyroid medication if
the two are taken too close together. Your doctor may recommend
taking your thyroid medicine in the morning and your calcium 12
hours later. You also need to avoid drinking calcium-fortified juices
close to the time you take your thyroid medicine.
Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 45

Taking medications 
to prevent seizures
Approximately one in ten people will have at least one seizure in
their lifetime by age 75. There are different types of seizures caused
by the malfunctioning of different parts of your brain; some seizure
medications work better on one type of seizure than another. Some
anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are more sedating than others, and many
have been implicated in causing bone loss by interfering with your
body’s absorption of vitamin D.
Seizure medications may also interfere with female hormone levels
such as estrogen and progesterone. Some AEDs suppress ovula-
tion, which keeps estrogen levels from rising during the menstrual
cycle. Lower estrogen levels means a greater chance of developing
osteoporosis.
If you’re on AEDs, make sure to have a bone density test done each
year, and take at least 200 to 400 IU of vitamin D a day, along with
at least 1,000 to 1,400 mg of calcium. Also be aware of a major risk
of poorly controlled seizures: falling!
Other drugs associated with 
developing osteoporosis
A large number of drugs in addition to the ones in this section are
associated with bone loss. Be aware that you may be at extra risk
for osteoporosis if you’re taking any of the following:
 Vitamin A (in excess of 3,000 micrograms per day): Excess
vitamin A may cause too much bone to be reabsorbed. (See
Chapter 11 about consuming too much vitamin A.)
 Heparin, a blood thinner: Researchers and doctors don’t
completely understand the connection between osteoporosis
and heparin, but long-term therapy (more than four or five
months) and doses of 15,000 IU or more increase the risk of
osteoporosis. Heparin may increase the number of osteo-
clasts in bone. (See Chapter 2 for more on osteoclasts.)
 Drugs that lower estrogen and testosterone: Any drug that
lowers your estrogen level increases your risk of developing
osteoporosis because bone loss increases when estrogen
levels are low. For example, Lupron (leuprolide acetate) is 
an anti-estrogen medicine that is used for women with
endometriosis and also for certain cancers in men, such as
prostate cancer. This drug lowers your estrogen level.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
46

 Medications that attack the virus that causes AIDS: Anti-HIV
drugs may increase your chance of osteoporosis by raising
cholesterol levels and interfering with the way the body manu-
factures and uses fat.
How Gastrointestinal Problems
Can Affect Your Bones
Your bones are dependent on what your digestive system absorbs,
so anything that interferes with your absorption of calcium and
vitamin D can weaken your bones. Diseases that wreak havoc with
your insides can also wreak havoc with your bones. Eating well is
important for development of strong bones (see Chapter 5 for
more about nutrition and osteoporosis), but eating well won’t help
your bones if your intestines aren’t absorbing the good stuff.
Vitamin D deficiency from inadequate nutrition might be more
common that originally thought. In one recent study, 45 percent of
hospitalized patients in Boston were vitamin D deficient. One
cause of vitamin D deficiency is gastrointestinal diseases, which
weren’t looked for in those cases. See Chapter 11 for more informa-
tion on vitamin D deficiency and its treatments.
Inflammatory bowel disease
If you have a chronic intestinal problem, such as ulcerative colitis
or Crohn’s disease, your risk for developing osteoporosis is 
threefold:
 The part of your intestine that absorbs vitamin D may be dam-
aged by inflammation, and therefore you become vitamin D
deficient.
 You may have had surgery, which removed the part of your
intestine that absorbs vitamin D.
 You may be taking medications, such as corticosteroids,
which increase bone loss. (See the section “Why corticos-
teroids can thin bones” earlier in this chapter.)
Your bone density may improve if your disease is in remission and
you’re no longer taking corticosteroids.
Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 47

Bone loss after stomach surgery
New studies have shown that many people lose bone faster than
they can replace it in the months following bariatric surgery to
induce weight loss. Those people who lose the most weight and
those people who lose weight quickly are most at risk, with up to
an 8 percent drop in bone density six months after surgery. This
loss may be the result of less efficient absorption of calcium, to 
the weight loss itself, or to the fact that vitamin D isn’t adequately
absorbed if part of the small intestine is removed.
Some people develop osteomalacia, a defect in the body’s ability to
mineralize bone, after stomach surgery. Osteomalacia (see Chapter
1 for more info) is considered to be “adult rickets” and results in
many fractures in unusual places (ribs, pelvic bones, and shoulder
blades).
Differentiating between osteoporosis and osteomalacia is impor-
tant because treatment may differ. Your doctor can perform a bone
biopsy to determine which condition is present. Bone biopsies are
simple procedures to perform, but pathologists with special train-
ing in bone diseases need to interpret the results so that you
receive the proper treatment.
Celiac disease and bone loss
As many as 1 in 250 men and women have an inherited disease
called celiac disease, or nontropical sprue. People with celiac dis-
ease don’t absorb adequate nutrients through the small intestine
because their intestinal lining is damaged by eaten gluten, which 
is found in wheat.
Severe celiac disease can be associated with marked deficiency of
vitamin D and numerous fractures. Patients without obvious causes
of osteoporosis need to be screened for celiac disease because it’s
fairly common. Your doctor can diagnose celiac disease with a com-
bination of history, blood tests, and intestinal biopsies. All untreated
patients need to have frequent bone density testing and vitamin D
measurements.
Noting Other Diseases Associated
with Osteoporosis
Many different diseases can increase your risk of developing 
osteoporosis. In many cases the medicine you take, such as 
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
48

corticosteroids, to treat the disease increases your risk. In other
cases the disease itself can cause bone loss.
Some other diseases associated with increased risk of osteoporo-
sis are
 Chronic kidney disease: Kidney disease raises the amount of
phosphate, a mineral that binds to calcium to maintain healthy
bones, in the blood. The extra phosphate circulates in the
blood looking for calcium to bind with, and will take calcium
from your bones if necessary to attach to the phosphate,
depleting your calcium stores.
Some people with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis
develop a severe bone disorder known as renal osteodystro-
phy. Your kidneys are critical in the metabolism of vitamin D.
When your kidneys start to fail, you become deficient in cer-
tain important active forms of vitamin D. Technically this 
condition isn’t osteoporosis. A bone biopsy in this situation
would reveal secondary hyperparathyroidism. Nonetheless, 
if you suffered from renal osteodystrophy, you could develop
many fractures. A great deal of progress has been made in
recent years in prevention and treatment of this disorder.
Careful regulation of phosphorus levels and new forms of 
vitamin D supplementation have greatly reduced the inci-
dence of this complex disorder.
 Cirrhosis of the liver: Many factors associated with liver fail-
ure can affect bone metabolism, such as the accumulation of
toxins related to the ineffectiveness of the damaged liver to
filter them out.
 Ehler-Danlos syndrome: This hereditary disease affects con-
nective tissue and is associated with decreased bone density
and hypermobility of joints.
 Hypercalciuria: People with hypercalciuria lose too much cal-
cium through their urine, often in the form of calcium kidney
stones. Your doctor might look for this problem by collecting
your urine for 24 hours and measuring the amount of calcium
in the urine.
 Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis:
People with rheumatoid arthritis are twice as likely to develop
osteoporosis as the general population; the risk is even higher
among rheumatoid arthritis patients who take corticosteroids.
 Multiple myeloma: This is a cancer of blood cells that results
in bone tumors. Patients with multiple myeloma have abnor-
mal plasma cells in their bone marrow. These cells make sub-
stances known as cytokines that stimulate osteoclasts and
Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 49

inhibit osteoblasts, thus weakening the bone. (See Chapter 2
for the lowdown on osteoblasts and osteoclasts.)
 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI): Several types of OI exist. Most
are inherited and cause very brittle bones and fractures in
childhood. OI is due to defects in the production of collagen,
an important protein in the maintenance of bone strength. (See
Chapter 4 for more information on osteoporosis in children.)
 Overactive parathyroid gland: An overactive parathyroid
results in a rise in blood calcium levels, causing mental confu-
sion, kidney damage, dehydration, nausea, and vomiting. (See
Chapter 2 for more about hyperactive parathyroid glands.)
 Overactive thyroid gland: It negatively affects bone mineral
density. (See “Avoiding excess thyroid medication” earlier in
this chapter for more information.)
The problem is that doctors and researchers don’t thoroughly
understand the mechanism in these various diseases. For example,
in people with Ehler-Danlos, the link could be genetic.
Reducing the Risks of 
Getting Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis isn’t just an inevitable part of getting older or a dis-
ease that only women get. It’s a complicated disease that can have
many causes, and it’s also a disease you can prevent by being
proactive about your health.
Women do develop osteoporosis more frequently than men. So,
given the fact that if you were born a woman, you’re most likely
going to stay one your whole life, what can you do to reduce your
risk of osteoporosis? Be aware that osteoporosis is more common
in women and start early to prevent it. Use these helpful tips and
keep osteoporosis at bay:
 Eat well from an early age if possible. If you’re already “over
the hill,” start eating well now, making sure you get at least
1,200 to 1,500 mg of calcium daily and 800 IU of vitamin D.
Take supplements if necessary, and medications as ordered
by your doctor. (See Chapter 5 for more on nutrition and
Chapter 11 for more on supplements.)
 Exercise, exercise, exercise! It helps you build more bone
mass and protects what you already have. (See Chapter 6 for
more on the benefits of exercise at any age.)
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
50

 Don’t smoke! If you already are smoking, do whatever you
can do to stop or least reduce the amount you smoke.
 Limit your daily alcohol intake. Have no more than one to
two alcoholic drinks each day.
 Take medications your doctor prescribes. Studies have
shown that up to half of all prescriptions written by doctors
aren’t filled or aren’t taken properly. (See Chapter 10 for more
on medications that fight osteoporosis.)
 Keep other health problems closely monitored. If you have
other health problems, such as the ones listed in “Noting
Other Diseases Associated with Osteoporosis,” earlier in this
section, make sure you’re especially diligent about your diet,
exercise, and medication routines.
 Know your family history. If osteoporosis runs in your family,
start working on changing history by changing your diet and
habits.
Chapter 3: Breaking Down the Risk Factors 51
Lost in space: Astronauts and bone loss
Astronauts are at risk for osteoporosis because of their prolonged weightlessness.
(Bet you never really gave that much thought, did you?) People who are confined to
bed for long periods of time also have accelerated bone loss, perhaps because of
the same mechanism: You need gravity for strong bones!

Men and Kids Get
Osteoporosis, Too 
In This Chapter
 Examining who else gets osteoporosis (besides women)
 Diagnosing and treating osteoporosis in men
 Understanding adolescents and osteoporosis
 Realizing kids can get osteoporosis
U
ntil recently, the emphasis on diagnosing and treating osteo-
porosis has been mainly on women. However, men also get
osteoporosis, and in fairly significant numbers. The misconception
that they don’t can cause delays in their diagnosis and treatment.
Adolescents and children can also have osteoporosis or a related
bone disease.
In this chapter, we look at the osteoporosis patients who don’t get
a lot of attention in the media: men, teens, and children.
Taking a Closer Look at Who 
Else Gets Osteoporosis
Although many osteoporosis sufferers are women, men and chil-
dren can also have osteoporosis (see “Yes, Little Kids Can Have
Osteoporosis” later in this chapter for more on children). In fact,
20 million men in the United States have osteoporosis, and one in
four men older than age 50 will have an osteoporotic-related frac-
ture in his lifetime. This chapter goes into more depth on how
osteoporosis affects men, teens, and children, but first check out
these interesting facts that may surprise you:

 Because men don’t go through menopause, with its sudden
drop in hormone levels, their onset of osteoporosis is later.
But by age 65, men are losing bone at the same rate as
women.
 Men of any race can have osteoporosis. Between 3 and 7 per-
cent of men age 50 and older have osteoporosis, and between
19 and 35 percent have low bone mass. Men of Caucasian and
Asian backgrounds are more likely to have low bone mass
than African Americans or Hispanics.
 Juvenile osteoporosis is rare, and most often associated with
other health conditions, although a form of osteoporosis called
idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) has been documented in
a small number (less than 100) of previously healthy children
just before the onset of adolescence. (See the sidebar “A rarity:
Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis” later in this chapter.)
 Girls who take being thin and athletic to an extreme may
develop a syndrome called the female athlete triad, which 
can have permanent devastating effects on bone. (Check out
the “The female athlete triad” section later in this chapter for
more info.)
Focusing on Osteoporosis in Men
Although most of the research has focused on women with osteo-
porosis, researchers are slowly starting to place more emphasis on
understanding when and why men develop osteoporosis.
Men generally start adulthood with larger, heavier bones than
women, and have a higher peak bone mass. But between 15 to 
25 percent of all men will develop osteoporosis, and after age 50, 
6 percent will fracture their hip. Table 4-1 shows the relationship 
of hip fractures in men and women more clearly:

Osteoporosis begins to affect men about ten years later than it
affects women. And because both men and women are living longer,
researchers and doctors anticipate more people will have hip frac-
tures in the future. In fact, by the year 2050, researchers project
that men will have one half of all hip fractures in the United States.
By the age of 86, the incidence of hip fracture in men is equal to the
incidence in women, meaning that by age 86, osteoporosis isn’t a
“women’s disease” in any way.
Because osteoporosis apparently becomes an equal opportunity
disease as you age, you may be curious as to when men should
start having bone mineral density scans. All men older than 70
need a baseline scan, as well as men under age 70 who have risk
factors, such as long-term corticosteroid use or use of drugs to
treat prostate cancer. (See Chapter 9 for more information on base-
line scans, and check out the next section for more on risk factors
in men.)
Seeking answers in 
the “Mr. OS” study
A seven-year study begun in 1999 by the NIH National Institute of
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), along
with the National Institute on Aging and National Cancer Institute is
following 5,700 men older than age 65. The study, called “Mr. OS,” is
looking at men’s risk factors for osteoporosis and how osteoporosis
affects men specifically. Knowledge of the diseases and conditions
that can affect bone mass can help to prevent men as well as women
from reaching the point of fracture before diagnosis.
Chapter 4: Men and Kids Get Osteoporosis, Too 55

One part of the study is looking at the possible relationship
between high bone mass and prostate cancer. This increased risk
may be related to levels of hormones, such as testosterone, which
protect bone. Other findings that are being examined in the study
include the following:
 Although men sustain hip fractures less frequently than
women, their mortality rate one year after hip fracture is two
to three times higher than for women.
 Risk factors for developing osteoporosis appear to be the
same in men as in women:
• Alcohol abuse: Alcohol abuse increases bone loss.
Approximately 25 to 50 percent of men seeking treat-
ment for alcohol abuse have low bone mass.
• Inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake: Men older
than 50 must consume 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 to
800 International Units (IU) of vitamin D daily.
• Lack of exercise: Men, like women, need to do weight-
bearing exercise 20 to 30 minutes a day three days a
week to build bone strength. (See Chapter 6 for more on
exercise.)
• Low hormone levels: Up to 30 percent of men with
osteoporosis have low testosterone levels and may need
hormone replacement. In one study, one-third of men
older than 70 with a fracture were hypogonadal, or suf-
fering from low testosterone levels. Hypogonadism is
often underdiagnosed in men because there’s no obvi-
ous precipitating event. In women, when estrogen levels
drop and menopause begins, their menses stops and hot
flashes start. But in men, during andropause, falling
testosterone levels may not be detected. Hence,
andropause (male menopause) may be subtler than
menopause in women, because signs of andropause
might just be attributed to aging, such as lack of sex
drive or difficulty maintaining an erection.
• Prostate cancer: Chemotherapy to treat prostate cancer
and other malignancies may also lower testosterone
levels.
• Smoking: Men who smoke are two to three times as
likely to fracture vertebrae as nonsmokers.
• Use of corticosteroids for diseases, such as asthma:
Men who have osteoporosis are more likely than women
to develop the disease because of another medical 
condition or because of medication they take, such as
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
56

corticosteroids. Use of corticosteroids accounts for
between 15 to 20 percent of osteoporosis in men. Men
taking these drugs need to maintain an adequate cal-
cium intake, have their testosterone levels checked, and
may need to take antiresorptive medications (see
Chapter 11 for more on osteoporosis medications).

sis and divides them into high, medium, and less common risks.

Treating men with osteoporosis
Because osteoporosis is recognized in men less often than in women,
fewer men are put on medication to reduce the risk of osteoporosis
until the damage has already been done. However, studies are begin-
ning to show that the same drugs successfully used to treat women
with osteoporosis also help men (see Chapter 10 for medications
used to treat osteoporosis). The major difference in treatment in men
and women is that hormone replacement differs.
Chapter 4: Men and Kids Get Osteoporosis, Too 57

In 2001, the FDA approved use of alendronate (Fosamax) in treat-
ment of osteoporosis in men. Before this point in time, few studies
had been done exclusively in men. Just after that, Forteo was
approved to treat osteoporosis in both men and women.
Because many men who develop osteoporosis have low levels of
testosterone, which drops gradually as they age, they may need to
take testosterone supplements. Androgens, or male sex hormones,
such as testosterone, stimulate bone formation. Doctors may pre-
scribe testosterone in the form of injections, patches, or gel to
raise the testosterone to normal levels.
Although testosterone is effective in reducing calcium loss and
helping to maintain bone density, it isn’t without side effects. Men
with prostate cancer shouldn’t take testosterone, because prostate
tumors may grow larger with added testosterone. Other potential
side effects of testosterone therapy include enlargement of the
breasts, swelling of hands and feet, and erectile dysfunction.
Researchers are studying new ways to give testosterone, such as
patches, injections, under the tongue, or gel, that may bypass the
liver. When the drug doesn’t pass through the liver, the chances of
liver damage are greatly reduced. Bypassing the liver can also
result in more of the drug being available for absorption.
Don’t take testosterone replacement therapy if you have
 Breast cancer (men can get that too)
 Liver disease
 Polycythemia (an abnormal increase in the number of red
blood cells)
 Prostate cancer
Avoid DHEA (a steroid hormone that decreases with age and is
often sold as a “rejuvenation” drug in health food stores) supple-
ments if you’re taking testosterone, because the combination of
the two may be dangerous.
Researchers are also working to develop designer androgens that
might have the desired bony effects without increasing the risk of
prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer and osteoporosis
Some evidence suggests that men who have prostate cancer and
are receiving androgen-deprivation therapy are at increased risk
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
58

for osteoporosis. Androgen-deprivation therapy focuses on
decreasing the level of testosterone in men with prostate cancer,
because testosterone may encourage growth of the cancerous
cells. Around 40 percent of men with prostate cancer receive anti-
hormone therapy as part of their treatment.
One large study showed that men who had received nine or more
doses of hormone therapy were 45 percent more likely to sustain a
bone fracture and had a 66 percent higher chance of needing hos-
pitalization after a fracture. Another study showed that five years
after treatment, slightly more than 19 percent of men had a frac-
ture, compared to 12.6 percent of men who hadn’t had any antihor-
mone therapy.
Taking drugs to fight osteoporosis called bisphosphonates (see
Chapter 10 for more on bisphosphonates) may reduce the risk of
bone loss and consequent fractures in men taking antihormone
drugs, such as leuprolide acetate (Lupron). If you’re taking an anti-
hormone drug, ask your doctor about taking bisphosphonates to
help offset bone loss.
Focusing on prevention 
and treatment
Outside of the use of testosterone in men, prevention and treat-
ment of osteoporosis in men and women is similar. Whether you’re
male or female, the best way to treat osteoporosis is to prevent it
from happening, by eating well, exercising, and by not smoking or
drinking alcohol excessively. (See Chapter 3, which covers all the
prevention measures you can take to avoid osteoporosis.)
Chapter 4: Men and Kids Get Osteoporosis, Too 59
The older you get
Nobody ever said getting older was a picnic. When it comes to prostate cancer, the
most common cancer found in American men, outside of skin cancer, age is defi-
nitely against you. Although men have a one in six lifetime risk of developing prostate
cancer, the risk increases dramatically, to one in two, if you make it to age 80. The
good news is that prostate cancer is a slow-growing cancer, and has a high cure
rate depending on whether or not the cancer has begun to spread to other organs
before it’s discovered. The best way to beat prostate cancer is to catch it early by
having a regular blood test screening called prostate specific antigen (PSA) or a
digital rectal exam.

If you already have osteoporosis, check out Chapter 10 for effec-
tive medication treatments.
Why Too Thin Is Bad for Bones —
Especially in Teens
You may remember the teenage angst of feeling “too fat,” even
when your weight barely touched the 100-pound mark. Teens
today are as acutely aware of their weight, and many, if not most,
teenage girls want to be thin. Unfortunately, the desire to be thin
can lead to behaviors that can have disastrous consequences for
bones down the road.
Because the teen years are so important in building the bone mass
that you draw from for the rest of your life, behaviors aimed at
staying thin, such as smoking and excessive dieting, will result in
bone loss that can never be regained, even if you change behaviors
as an adult.
For example, some teenage girls see smoking cigarettes as a way 
to curb their weight. One Japanese study showed teens that were
concerned about their weight were four times more likely to start
smoking. In fact, nearly 30 percent of American teenage girls are
regular smokers.
Dieting and bone loss
Avoiding the “it’s in to be thin” emphasis today is difficult, espe-
cially if you’re young and impressionable. Being severely under-
weight can have devastating consequences to bone, especially 
if there is an associated eating disorder, such as anorexia and
bulimia.
The American Psychiatric Society defines anorexia nervosa and
bulimia nervosa in the following way:
Anorexia nervosa is
 A refusal to maintain weight that’s over the lowest weight con-
sidered normal for age and height
 An intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though
underweight
 A distorted body image
 In women, three consecutive missed menstrual periods with-
out pregnancy
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
60

Doctors and counselors direct treatment of anorexia at achieving
weight gain. When an anorexic reaches 90 percent of her normal
body weight, her period usually resumes. Estrogen therapy may
also help. Studies have shown that bone lost during this time
period isn’t easily regained, and the increased risk of fracture may
be permanent, even with treatment.
Meanwhile, bulimia nervosa is
 Recurrent episodes of binge eating, which means eating more
than needed to satisfy hunger; (minimum average of two
binge-eating episodes a week for at least three months)
 A feeling of lack of control over eating during the binges
 A regular use of one or more of the following to prevent
weight gain:
• Self-induced vomiting
• Strict dieting or fasting
• Use of laxatives or diuretics
• Vigorous exercise
 A persistent over-concern with body shape and weight
Chapter 4: Men and Kids Get Osteoporosis, Too 61
Finding out a bit more about anorexia
The following important tidbits are important to know about anorexia nervosa and
how it can affect bone development:
 Anorexia nervosa is a psychological disease that has physical consequences
lasting all through life. Around 1 out of 100 adolescents, 90 percent of whom are
female, develops anorexia.
 Anorexia can cause bone loss in several ways. Girls with anorexia stop having
menstrual periods because their estrogen levels fall too low due to a lack of body
fat. Falling estrogen levels are a prime cause for a decrease in bone density.
 Anorexics generally don’t consume an adequate amount of calories, which
results in less bone formation during adolescence, a time when up to half of
peak bone density is being achieved. In addition, anorexics often have a high
level of a glucocorticoid called cortisol, which contributes to bone loss.
 Teens with anorexia have been found to have spinal density 25 percent less
than that of healthy teens, and up to two-thirds of anorectics have bone density
more than two standard deviations below the normal on a DXA scan, a test done
to determine your bone density. (See Chapter 9 for more about DXA scans and
how to interpret them.)

Bulimics aren’t always underweight; many maintain their weight
within normal limits and don’t experience the stopping of men-
strual periods and bone loss that anorexics do.
The female athlete triad
The female athlete triad may sound like some sort of Olympic
event, but it actually describes a serious result of eating disorders
combined with too much exercise. Young athletes involved in
sports, such as ballet, gymnastics, and figure skating, where keep-
ing their weight low is important, often suffer from this condition.
What causes this condition? The combination of stringent dieting
and excessive exercise results in a loss of menstrual periods,
which lowers estrogen levels. The outcome? The athlete lacks the
nutrients to grow strong bones and hormones to maintain bone,
which causes osteoporosis at a young age, leading to stress frac-
tures and weakened bones that can last a lifetime.
A young athlete may seem to be taking in a normal number of 
calories, but the amount eaten may be far below what she needs
because of her greatly increased physical activity.
The female athlete triad isn’t an uncommon problem. In fact,
among female athletes, the syndrome may be present in as many
as 50 percent or more of athletes. If you’re a parent, grandparent,
or close friend of a young athlete, watch for these signs to see if
the child is taking training to a dangerous level:
 Loss of menstrual periods for three months in a row
 Preoccupation with eating and/or using diet pills, laxatives, or
diuretics
 Frequent visits to the bathroom immediately after eating
 Menstruation not begun by age 16
 Always wearing baggy sweatshirts and pants so weight loss
isn’t evident
Girls with the female athlete triad may be put on hormone replace-
ment therapy to supply necessary hormones. They also need to be
under a physician’s care.
If you’re the relative, coach, or friend of a young athlete, how can
you help them avoid the trap of the female athlete triad? Follow
these three simple steps:
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
62

1. Don’t emphasize winning as the most important thing.
The benefits of sports are many, and although winning 
is great, don’t seek it at the price of permanent health 
problems.
2. Be aware.
Watch for the signs that your athlete is taking diet and
exercise to an extreme, and don’t wait until you notice
everything is out of hand before doing something about it.
3. Take action.
Don’t bury your head in the sand when you see signs. Don’t
assume that just talking to your athlete will fix the problem.
Enlist the help of your doctor and the coach.
Yes, Little Kids Can 
Have Osteoporosis
Even though osteoporosis is rarer in children, it can occur. But
some diseases, such as rickets, osteogenesis imperfecta, and the
very rare idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IOA), can also cause
osteoporosis or bone loss in children. And some medical treat-
ments, such as corticosteroids to treat asthma, can also lead to
osteoporosis. This section examines these conditions in more
detail.
Rickets: A real risk for bone loss
You may think of rickets as a disease of the past, and to some
extent you’re correct. Rickets, a vitamin D deficiency, was much
more common before the early 1920s, before milk was fortified
with vitamin D and rickets greatly decreased.
But rickets is still around, although it’s not a common disease. In
adults, rickets is known as osteomalacia (see Chapter 1 for more on
osteomalacia). Rickets and osteomalacia both have the same
causes and effects.
Some of the symptoms of rickets are
 Bone fractures
 Bone pain
 Fever, restlessness, and weakness
Chapter 4: Men and Kids Get Osteoporosis, Too 63

 Growing wings and jumping from grass blade to grass blade
(Wait, ignore that. That’s from Crickets For Dummies.)
 Muscle cramps
 Short stature
 Skeletal deformities such as bowlegs, pigeon breast, spine
curvatures, or odd-shaped skull
 Soft teeth
Rickets is a childhood metabolic disease that causes an imbalance
between bone breakdown and remodeling. This imbalance can
happen because the child isn’t taking in enough vitamin D, or
because an intestinal disease, such as celiac disease (or sprue), 
is blocking the absorption of vitamin D.
Vitamin D is available from two sources: sunlight and food. In
industrial areas, pollution may block sunlight. In cold areas, sun-
light may be limited during the winter. People with dark skin
absorb less sunlight and are more prone to vitamin D deficiency.
Newborns sometimes are vitamin D deficient because their breast-
feeding mothers are. Breast milk normally doesn’t contain ade-
quate amounts of vitamin D, but the amount can be increased if
mom takes vitamin D supplements. Breastfed babies can also take
supplements.
Sometimes children with special diets can develop rickets. For
example, a child allergic to milk and dairy products or a vegetarian
child who avoids milk products needs vitamin D supplementation
to avoid rickets. Consult with your doctor about the appropriate
amounts, depending on your child’s age.
A hereditary inability of the kidneys to retain phosphate or a
kidney disorder that causes acidosis can cause rickets. Liver 
disorders can also cause problems with vitamin D absorption 
or metabolism.
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic bone disease usually
inherited from a parent. Occasionally, OI occurs as a spontaneous
mutation with no family history. A parent with OI has a 50 percent
chance of passing the gene on to a child.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
64

People with OI are missing a protein called type I collagen. This
protein helps make up bone, ligaments, teeth, and the white outer
part of the eyeball, the sclera. The lack of type I collagen creates
fragile bone that fractures easily, although it heals at a normal rate.
OI can range from mild to severe, and anywhere between 20,000
and 50,000 people in the United States have OI. Some individuals
with OI have distinctive features: They’re shorter than average.
They have a blue, gray, or purple tint to the whites of their eyes.
Some have hearing loss.
Someone with OI may have anywhere from ten fractures to hun-
dreds in their lifetime. Some fractures may need surgical treat-
ment. For example, metal rods may need to be inserted into the
long bones of the arms and legs. Spinal fusion may be necessary to
limit scoliosis. The rate of fracture often declines as OI children
become adults, but may increase again as women enter
menopause.
Doctors aim treatment at maximizing function, minimizing disabil-
ity, and maintaining overall health and independence. Doctors may
prescribe an injectable bisphosphonate drug, pamidronate
(Aredia), to strengthen bones and reduce fractures.
Chapter 4: Men and Kids Get Osteoporosis, Too 65
A rarity: Idiopathic juvenile 
osteoporosis (IJO)
Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO) is a rare disease, with less than 100 cases
reported, and occurs in previously healthy children between the ages of 4 and 16.
Most of the time, the disease goes into spontaneous remission within two to four
years.
Children with IJO may complain of pain in their back, hips, and feet, and may have
trouble walking. Their DXA scans may show low bone density, and X-rays will reveal
fractures of weight-bearing bone or collapsed vertebrae.
Treatment of IJO is aimed at protecting bones from fracture until remission occurs,
through physical therapy and reduced activity. Doctors generally don’t use med-
ications unless the disease is severe and not resolving spontaneously.
Damage from IJO can result in permanent collapse of the rib cage or scoliosis, but
often the disease leaves no permanent disability. Growth may be hindered during the
active phase of the disease, but normal growth usually resumes in remission. Most
children experience complete recovery with no later recurrence.

If your child or grandchild suffers from IO, take extra care when
handling him. (Don’t avoid touching your child. Give him or her
plenty of hugs and kisses — just be gentle.) Casts are probably
going to be a way of life for your child, so make sure the car seat
and stroller you buy are big enough to accommodate them.
Corticosteroids and osteoporosis 
in children
The use of corticosteroids for inflammatory diseases, such as
asthma, in children is one of the biggest childhood risks for devel-
oping osteoporosis.
Most children who develop corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis
are taking oral steroids. Although researchers and doctors haven’t
ruled out high-dose inhaled steroids as a possible cause of osteo-
porosis, studies haven’t been conclusive (see “Substituting inhaled
corticosteroids” later in this section). If your child is likely to be on
oral corticosteroids long term, ask your doctor to conduct a base-
line bone densitometry to monitor any changes (check out
Chapter 9 for more on baseline testing).
One study by the National Jewish Medical and Research Center of
400 asthmatic children on daily oral corticosteroids made the fol-
lowing conclusions:
 Daily doses of 10 mg of prednisone can cause bone loss.
 Thirty to 50 percent of children will have bone loss.
 Bone loss in children will be mainly in the vertebrae and
radius (forearm).
 Bone loss won’t have any symptoms until a fracture occurs.
 Bone densitometry starting at age 5 is essential in high-risk
children.
 Bone loss is most common in children taking a daily dose of
20 mg or more of a corticosteroid. Short “bursts” or occa-
sional corticosteroid use doesn’t appear to cause bone loss.
Substituting inhaled corticosteroids
Although studies measuring possible bone loss in children who
have used inhaled corticosteroids have been inconclusive, some
preliminary results show less chance of bone loss and osteoporo-
sis if the children use inhaled corticosteroids rather than oral
ones.
Part I: Understanding Your Bones 
66

Studies have shown some conflicting information, however. In
2001, studies in young women showed that inhaled corticosteroids
to treat asthma resulted in loss of bone density. Eight puffs daily
had the greatest effect. Then in 2003, further data appeared in the
literature that showed that inhaled corticosteroids in children
didn’t seem to affect bone. These preliminary results are great
news, but need to be viewed with caution, because there is con-
flicting information.
Several studies in adult asthmatics have shown decreases in osteo-
calcin, a protein made by bone forming osteoclasts, in inhaled cor-
ticosteroid users, so inhaled corticosteroids could possibly be
damaging, although not to the same extent as oral doses.
With chronic disease requiring the daily use of corticosteroids, the
best advice is to start with the smallest dose that gives good effect,
start with inhaled corticosteroids rather than oral doses if possi-
ble, and monitor bone closely. Keep the number of puffs used daily
to a minimum. Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma are critically
important in treating this potentially life-threatening and lung-
damaging problem.
Treating corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis
Like it or not, some children need to be on daily doses of oral corti-
costeroids. The treatment goal is to minimize bone damage, even 
if it can’t be avoided completely. If your child takes oral corticos-
teroids, ask your doctor to start with the lowest effective dose to
treat, instead of pulling out the big guns from the start.
Children on corticosteroids must maintain an adequate calcium
and vitamin D intake. This amount may be higher than the normal
recommended daily allowance, which for calcium is 400 mg for
infants aged 0 to 6 months, 800 mg for children 1 to 10, and 1,200
mg for adolescents and young adults 11 to 25. Children on corti-
costeroids need to have 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium daily, and 
400 to 800 IU of vitamin D.
Furthermore, keep your child exercising, even if you and your
doctor have to modify the exercise program for your child’s limita-
tions. Maintaining weight-bearing activities stimulates bone mass.
Have a baseline bone densitometry test done so your doctor can
watch for any changes. Your doctor may also want to monitor 
24-hour urinary calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine (a waste
product that can help measure kidney function) levels to check 
for mineral loss. Taking blood tests for osteocalcin, which helps
measure bone turnover, may also be helpful.

s it true that “you are what you eat?” When it comes to building
bones, which are strong enough to last a lifetime, the answer is
a resounding yes!
You not only are what you eat today, but you’re also what you ate
three weeks ago, three months, three years, and so on. Your bones
today are strong because of the calcium you ate during your forma-
tive years, up to age 30 or so. If you ate poorly, didn’t exercise, and
smoked and drank too much alcohol, your bones are going to pay
the price — and not just today, but years from now as well.
The bone mass you build by your mid-20s or 30s is the best you’ll
ever have. After that, all you can do is maintain what you have; you
can’t build any more. The amount of bone gained during adoles-
cence should equal the amount lost during the rest of your adult
lifetime. If you don’t build enough bone in adolescence, you’ll have
too little to “draw from” during the later part of your life.
Although heredity and certain unchangeable factors, such as race,
body build, and gender, play a large part in determining your peak
bone mass, up to 50 percent can be attributed to lifestyle behav-
iors. And eating is certainly a lifestyle behavior.

In this chapter, we tell you what to eat today to maintain strong
bones and how to plan a lifelong diet to keep what you’ve built. If
you’re just starting to think about your bones after a lifetime of
ignoring them, we can recommend some food strategies.
Getting Enough Calcium 
in Your Diet
When you hear the words “healthy bones,” your first thought may
be “I need to consume more food rich in calcium.” For many of you
this statement is true, because most Americans don’t get enough
calcium from their diets. As convenient as supplements may be,
the calcium that’s best absorbed is the calcium you get from your
diet.
Calcium is only one of the minerals responsible for maintaining
your bones, but it’s a very important one, and one in which as
many as 35 percent of Americans are deficient. (See Chapter 2 for
more on the relationship between calcium and your bones.)
Most of the time, your body keeps a steady amount of calcium. So
when you don’t have enough calcium in your diet, your bones get
less than they need to maintain strength. Leaving your bones short
of calcium may not kill you, at least not directly, but it does have a
large negative effect on your life if it leads to osteoporotic fractures.
Because getting “enough” calcium is a nebulous term, we devise
Table 5-1 to show you exactly how much calcium you need at dif-
ferent points in your life.

You may be surprised to see that adults need more calcium than
babies and young children because many people mistakenly
believe that milk and other calcium-rich foods are mostly for
babies and children. Although a good calcium intake at younger
ages is important so that bones reach their maximum strength, a
good calcium intake is just as important as you get older so that
you can maintain the bone you already have.
If you’re a parent or grandparent, you can demonstrate what a
good diet looks like by including ample amounts of calcium in your
diet. You know that lecturing little ears about getting enough cal-
cium and restricting foods that deplete calcium, such as soft
drinks, likely falls upon deaf ears. Kids don’t care what’s going to
happen to their bones in 30 years.
You need to make sure the choices your children and grandchil-
dren are offered can build strong bones from a young age. And
young adults must know that you can’t let good habits slide just
because you’re no longer building bone mass. A common miscon-
ception is that after you achieve your maximum height, you can
discontinue drinking milk. Not so fast!
The fact is children between the ages of 9 and 18 require the high-
est amount of calcium (1,300 mg per day). For postmenopausal
women, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 1,200 mg per
day, which is only a 100 mg less! Most physicians recommend 1,500
mg of calcium daily if you’re diagnosed with osteoporosis.
Hence stopping your good eating habits and assuming that you’ve
done enough by eating well in your childhood and teens is a mis-
take. Studies show that you have to maintain your calcium intake
for its positive effects on your bones to continue.
You probably know that dairy products are great sources of cal-
cium. If you’re not big on dairy, check out Chapter 15, which
includes ten great alternatives to dairy products to reach your
daily calcium levels. You can manage to keep up your calcium
intake and never touch a single dairy product, but you’ll have to
add carefully.
Don’t shut this book if you’re thinking to yourself, “I hate milk, and
I’m not going to drink milk, even if my bones start crumbling like
potato chips.” Don’t be hasty — we also include tons of sugges-
tions in this chapter about how you can get an adequate amount of
calcium without ever opening a milk carton.
Chapter 5: Eating Right for Good Bones 73

Table 5-2 shows that milk is an excellent source of calcium, but so
are some other foods. (See Tables 5-2, 5-3, and 5-4.) And don’t
forget that milk is milk, even if you mix it into your mashed pota-
toes instead of chugging it from the carton.

Milk matters!
You’ve probably seen the milk-mustachioed personalities featured in the “Got Milk?”
ads. The campaign to increase milk consumption has also spawned T-shirts and, of
course, parodies.
Why the emphasis on milk? Obviously, the “Got Milk?” campaign is designed to sell
more milk. But the focus on milk as a good food is a wonderful thing. Milk con-
sumption increased by 15 million gallons the first year the ads aired in California.
So what’s milk got that other dairy foods don’t, besides a clever campaign? The
answer is: more calcium.
A cup of calcium-fortified milk contains 420 mg of calcium, about a third of your daily
requirement. It doesn’t matter if it’s 2 percent, skim, or whole milk; milk is the hands-
down winner of the high calcium award. The commercial brought national atten-
tion to the fact that today’s youth were consuming less milk and more soft drinks. For
more on the “Got Milk?” campaign, visit its Web site at www.whymilk.com.

As you can see, calcium isn’t just for milk drinkers; you can find
calcium in a number of other foods. Even fortified breads and cere-
als, depending on the manufacturer, typically contain at least 100
mg of calcium.
Living with lactose intolerance
Millions of people worldwide are lactose intolerant, meaning that
they can’t break down and use lactose, the main sugar found in
milk and other dairy products. These people are deficient in the
enzyme that breaks down lactose known as lactase. The symptoms
include bloating, lower abdominal pains, and loose stools after
drinking milk. As time goes by, people who are lactose intolerant
often drink less milk to avoid the symptoms.
Lactose intolerance affects all races to some degree, although
African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, and Native
Americans are affected more frequently than Caucasians. For
example, some studies in the United States quote a 70 percent 
incidence in African Americans and a 15 percent incidence in
Caucasians.
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
76

Lactose intolerant people are twice as likely to suffer from osteo-
porosis than people who aren’t lactose intolerant. They have a
higher rate of osteoporosis because they typically take in less cal-
cium, or because they don’t absorb calcium well.
You can take some easy steps to maintain your calcium intake if
you’re lactose intolerant by:
 Drinking lactose-free milk, such as Lactaid. In lactose-free
milk, the lactose has been chemically removed.
 Drinking soymilk. We thank comedian Lewis Black for point-
ing out that soymilk is more appropriately referred to as “soy
juice” because it doesn’t come from a cow! Have you ever
seen a soy cow before? Neither have we!
 Trying Ultra Lactaid tablets. Take one just before consuming
any product with lactose. These tablets often aren’t effective
in people with severe deficiencies of the enzyme.
 Checking our charts in this chapter for calcium contents of
foods that don’t contain lactose. We provide plenty of alterna-
tives, for example, oranges, almonds, and salmon. (A yummy
spinach salad topped with orange slices, sliced almonds, and
chunks of grilled salmon sounds good right now!)
 Looking for calcium-fortified drinks, such as orange juice.
Make sure you know what you’re getting by reading the label.
 Eating yogurt with active cultures. Yogurts with live active
cultures contain bacteria that help digests lactose. (One cup
of yogurt contains 5 grams of lactose.)
 Chopping up some cheese. Hard cheeses, such as cheddar
and Swiss, have much of their lactose broken down during the
production process. (Swiss cheese still has a gram of lactose.)
To get a better feel for how certain dairy foods compare to each
other in terms of lactose content, check out Table 5-5.

“Eat your leafy greens!”
Yes, your parents were right about eating your vegetables. Not
only did your eating them keep peace at the dinner table, but they
also helped build your future bones.
Nearly all vegetables contain some calcium. Generally speaking, if
it’s green and leafy, it’s probably a good source of calcium. (Some
vegetables, such as cauliflower, eggplant, and potatoes, only con-
tain small amounts, around 10 mg per serving. Corn, beets, and
mushrooms also register low on the calcium scale.) You also have
to keep in mind how the calcium intake changes when you cook
your vegetables (see Table 5-6).
Some vegetables contain calcium that is more easily absorbed than
others. The calcium in spinach, for example, isn’t absorbed as well
as the calcium in broccoli or kale, because spinach contains oxalic
acid, which binds calcium.

Another reason to eat your leafy greens: Recent studies have
shown that a daily intake of three to five serving of fruits and veg-
etables daily can increase your calcium levels not only because
they contain calcium, but also because their acidity, or alkalinity,
increases the calcium that’s able to be absorbed from them (see
the “Looking at the acid test” sidebar later in this chapter).

78

Reading the labels: How 
much calcium is in it?
You can find nutritional labels (check out Figure 5-1) on almost
everything these days. You can barely pick up anything at the gro-
cery store that doesn’t have a label with nutritional contents listed
on it — like you really wanted to know that a corn muffin contains
500 calories!
Figure 5-1: A nutritional label from fortified whole milk.
When it comes to figuring out calcium amounts, the label makers
have made it a bit more difficult by putting down a percentage,
rather than an amount in milligrams. You can easily figure it out
though.
If a label says that one serving contains 20 percent of the daily
value, just multiply 20 by 10 and you’ve got the milligrams of cal-
cium. So 20 percent is 200 mg of calcium per serving.

Examining the Critical 
Role of Vitamin D
You can’t have healthy bones unless you take in enough vitamin D.
Although you probably already know that calcium is essential to
build strong bones, you may not realize that without vitamin D,
your body can’t properly absorb or utilize calcium (see Chapter 11
for more on vitamin D supplementation).
In many parts of the world, people easily obtain vitamin D through
sunlight exposure, the main source of vitamin D. However, many
elderly housebound people, as well as those cooped up in an office
with nary a ray of sunlight exposure day after day, and those who
live where it seems the sun rarely shines, may all be vitamin D defi-
cient, unless they work at getting enough to compensate in their
diet.
Fortunately, many processed foods are fortified with vitamin D.
Companies began fortifying milk and cereals with vitamin D in 
the 1930s to help prevent rickets, a disease caused by vitamin D
deficiency.
Milk is a good source of vitamin D only because manufacturers 
add vitamin D to the milk. Cows’ milk alone has none! Because milk
is a good source of vitamin D, you may assume that cheese and
other dairy products, such as ice cream and yogurt, are also good
sources, but only milk is artificially fortified with vitamin D. You
won’t find vitamin D in large quantities in other dairy products, so
don’t count your daily ice cream bar as a part of your vitamin D
requirement! Vitamin D–fortified milk isn’t used in the production
of many other dairy products.
Because only certain foods are fortified with vitamin D, doctors are
recognizing more and more patients with blood levels of vitamin D
below the recommended amount. Years ago, doctors didn’t have
particularly accurate ways of measuring the amount of vitamin D 
in their patients’ blood. Newer tests are more accurate.
To complicate matters, many foods have less vitamin D than they
used to have. We believe (and there is literature to back this up)
that vitamin D deficiency is becoming much more common among
adults especially those living in northern climates. One cup of milk
has about 100 International Units (IU) of vitamin D in it, but the
minimum requirement is 200 IU daily. If you have osteoporosis,
your doctor may recommend upwards of 800 IU of vitamin D daily.
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
80

So if you don’t drink milk, if you’re not exposed to enough sunlight,
and if you don’t take a multivitamin, you may be at risk for vitamin
D deficiency. Other options do exist. For example, raisin bran is
fortified with 77 IU of vitamin D, but the amount can vary from
brand to brand. Table 5-7 lists some good food sources of vitamin
D for you to consider.

If you have reduced bone mineral density, have your doctor 
measure the vitamin D levels in your blood. Many experts con-
sider a level less than 25 micrograms/dl to be abnormal. Years ago,
experts in bone metabolism thought that this level might have
been adequate, however new information suggests that more is
better!
Nutrients You Probably 
Never Think About
The list of nutrients that affect your bones is staggering, so we just
touch on a couple here.
 Phosphorus: Phosphorus in the form of phosphate makes up
more than half of the mineral in bone, so you may think that
phosphorus is good. It is — up to 700 mg a day. However,
excess phosphorus, more than 3,000 to 4,000 mg daily, can
result in calcium loss. A normal diet contains adequate phos-
phorus. You can find large amounts of phosphorus in soft
drinks and many processed foods.
Chapter 5: Eating Right for Good Bones 81

 Potassium: If you have a diet low in potassium, your body
may overcompensate by removing calcium from your bones,
thus weakening them. You can find potassium in fruits, vegeta-
bles, poultry, fish, milk, and yogurt.
Setting Down the Saltshaker
The United States is a nation of saltshaker addicts. Many (your co-
author Sharon shamefully included) often salt all their food with-
out even tasting it first to see if the salt is even necessary.
Excess sodium chloride increases urinary calcium loss. If you’re a
saltshaker addict, your sodium intake is probably in the “excess”
column! Several studies show that an additional gram of sodium a
day increases calcium loss by 1 percent a year, unless you offset
the loss with additional calcium intake.
Because high sodium intake is also associated with high blood
pressure and water retention, you can do yourself a number of
health-related favors simply by not using your saltshaker so enthu-
siastically. Keep your sodium intake down to 1 teaspoon of table
salt daily, or 2,400 mg of sodium. If you have high blood pressure,
kidney disease, or heart failure, discuss the amount of salt in your
diet with your physician.
Don’t forget to count the sodium found in processed foods. These
amounts can be extremely high — as high as 420 mg in one can of
“lowered-sodium” soup!
High Protein or Low Protein?
The debate over high protein diets as a good way to lose weight
has enlarged to include questions on whether a high protein diet is
good or bad for your bones.
Protein is a necessary part of your diet. Men need 56 grams of pro-
tein a day, while women need 46 grams. Some studies have shown
that taking in too little protein results in weak bones. And people
who break their hip and who don’t get enough protein are more
likely to have a slow recovery with more medical problems.
But what about the opposite issue — taking in too high amounts of
protein? If a little is good, is a lot better? Experts are debating this
question. Several recent studies show that high protein diets can
result in too much calcium being excreted in your urine, which can
result in less calcium for your bones.
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
82

Researchers haven’t done enough studies following people on high
protein diets for a long period of time to conclude if they develop
osteoporosis. Many factors can affect your excretion of calcium;
some studies show that as long as your calcium intake is adequate,
a high protein diet doesn’t result in weakened bones.
For now, the sensible approach to diet and osteoporosis is also the
healthiest approach to diet in general: common sense and modera-
tion. The best diet for overall health is one that emphasizes pro-
tein, vegetables, and fruit, and de-emphasizes sugar, processed
foods, and soft drinks.
Assessing Alcohol in Your Diet
For many years, excess alcohol consumption has been known to
be a risk factor for skeletal fractures especially among men. The
question is how much alcohol is safe to drink, because some
research has shown perhaps some beneficial effects of drinking
small amounts of alcohol on cholesterol levels.
The problem is that 1 in 13 Americans abuse alcohol or are alco-
holics. What happens to your bone in that situation? Drinking
excess alcoholic beverages
 Disrupts your body’s calcium balance
 Leaches calcium from bone
Chapter 5: Eating Right for Good Bones 83
Looking at the acid test
The whole high protein versus osteoporosis issue revolves around acid, or more
specifically, your body’s acid-base balance.
Your body’s acidity or alkalinity is expressed as pH, which stands for “potential of
hydrogen.” This level indicates the acidity or alkalinity of liquids. All liquids have a
pH falling between 0 and 14. A pH of 7 is neutral, or balanced. A pH less than 7 is con-
sidered acidic; higher than 7 is considered alkaline.
Your body functions best when it’s neither acidic nor alkaline — at a pH of 7, in other
words. Different foods contain varying amounts of acid that may affect the acid-
base balance in your body.
Recent studies show that a high intake of high acid nutrients, such as meat, can
increase acidity in your body. To neutralize this acid, more minerals may need to be
released from bone, resulting in weakened bone.

 Interferes with the conversion of vitamin D to its active form
 Lowers serum testosterone levels, which is a hormone impor-
tant in bone strength in both men and women
Excess alcohol intake can also make you prone to falls. In one
study of 84,000 women, moderate alcohol intake — more than one
to two drinks per day — was associated with a higher risk of fore-
arm and hip fractures.
Drinking too much alcohol can also lead to poor nutrition. Many
alcoholics are deficient in nutrients due to poor diet.
So is drinking alcohol okay or not? If you’re not normally a drinker,
we probably don’t see any reason to start now. But if you enjoy a
glass of wine at night, restrict your intake to just one glass.
Decreasing Caffeine: 
Does it Matter?
Are you addicted to lattes? Do you need at least a pot of coffee to
get you going each day? Can you not get by in the afternoons with-
out a large, two-gallon jumbo cola? All are sources of caffeine, and
although the buzz caffeine supplies may get you up and make you
feisty, it may also leach calcium from your bones.
Excess caffeine intake may disturb your body’s balance of calcium
and phosphorus, which can cause increased calcium loss in your
urine. The phosphoric acid found in many soft drinks has the same
effect, resulting in a loss of calcium for your bones. Coffee and soft
drinks aren’t the only culprits. Don’t forget that some over-the-
counter medication, such as Excedrin, contains significant
amounts of caffeine.
Studies show that a moderate intake of caffeine, up to four cups of
coffee a day, doesn’t increase bone loss. This doesn’t mean you
can have four of the double lattes, each served in a cup the size of
Texas, and think you’re within your daily caffeine allowance! A cup
is 8 ounces of regular coffee. If you consume more than that
(include cola intake), you need to consider cutting back. One way
to offset calcium excretion due to caffeine intake is to put a little
calcium-containing dairy product into each cup of coffee. We can’t
recommend this for cola addicts, however!
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
84

If you’re a caffeine junkie, you need extra calcium to replace the
excess amounts being excreted in your urine. (See Chapter 11
about taking calcium supplements.)
Looking At How Your Weight
Affects Your Bones
Thick or thin, fat or skinny, what’s best for your bones? Because
most other health issues say thin is better, you may assume the
same is true for your bones, but that’s not necessarily the case.
Excessive dieting isn’t good when it comes to osteoporosis.
Some studies show that thin women who are overly concerned
about their weight and diet frequently have bone density that is 6
percent lower than women of average weight. If your weight drops
below 127 pounds, your physician needs to be appropriately con-
cerned that you’re at higher risk for development of osteoporosis.
Clearly, obsessive dieting to the point of anorexia or amenorrhea
(lack of menstrual periods, caused by low estrogen levels) can
result in low bone density that may last a lifetime. (See Chapter 4
for more on anorexia.) Plenty of low calorie sources of calcium are
available to keep you both trim and bone-strong at the same time.
What about the other side of the coin, that is, being overweight?
“Fat” has a negative connotation in the United States and else-
where. And even though “fat” in the sense of true obesity is cer-
tainly bad for your health, some fat is necessary. Research has
shown that higher body weight can influence bone mass through
four mechanisms:
 Larger mechanical loading
 More muscle mass
 Higher levels of sex hormones
 Less bone resorption
Estrogen levels in your body are related to fat, and estrogen helps
build strong bones by decreasing bone breakdown and helping
maintain adequate levels of vitamin D.
Chapter 5: Eating Right for Good Bones 85

Osteoporosis is actually less common in overweight people, but
that’s hardly a reason to gain large amounts of weight, because the
risks of obesity on many other body functions are well docu-
mented. The bottom line for adults is that you need to discuss
your proper weight with your physician. Too much is harmful. Too
little is harmful as well.
With regard to children, weight issues may be different. Some
recent studies have shown that overweight children have lower
bone density than their normal weight peers. Their lower exercise
levels and decreased intake of calcium and increased amounts of
carbonated beverages may account for these findings.
You can help your overweight child develop better bone density
by cutting out sodas and substituting low-fat milk. Encourage your
child to be active; your child may never make the Olympics, and
may not want to play competitive sports, but cycling, weight lift-
ing, or just walking can pay big dividends in stronger bones. Better
yet, go out with your child when he exercises, and you’ll develop
not only stronger bones, but also a closer relationship with 
your kid.

Exercising for Strong Bones
In This Chapter
 Taking the first steps to exercise
 Exercising and loving it
 Determining how to fit exercise into your life
 Steering clear of injuries
 Following through with your exercise plan
H
aving a love-hate relationship with the idea of exercise is so
easy. You may fully realize the obvious health benefits of a
regular exercise program, yet dread the idea of devoting time to
what you’re sure is a mundane activity.
We can promise, however, that as soon as you start and actually
carry out an exercise routine, the health and psychological bene-
fits will be so obvious that you’ll greatly miss your exercise routine
when you can’t perform it. In other words — try it, you’ll probably
like it!
Experts agree that weight-bearing exercise benefits your bones.
You may worry that exercising when you have osteoporosis is dan-
gerous, or that exercise might cause more fractures, but the oppo-
site is actually true. The right exercises actually strengthen your
bones and decrease your chance of fracture.
In this chapter, we discuss what exercises are best to prevent or
lessen osteoporosis, how to set up and actually continue an exer-
cise plan, how to avoid injuries after you’re on the plan, and how
to keep a smile on your face while doing something that’s great for
your bones!

Starting While You’re Still Young
When’s the best time to start an exercise program to prevent
osteoporosis? Yesterday! Actually, the best time to start is at birth;
building bone is a lifelong proposition.
Most of you remember childhood as a time of physical activity —
roller-skating, jumping rope, riding bikes, climbing hills, and swim-
ming were a daily part of life. Sadly, as people age they become
less active. In fact, studies show that by age 16, only a little more
than 10 percent of girls are involved in regular physical activity. As
a matter of fact, the Surgeon General’s report in 2002 stated that
only 25 percent of U.S. high-school students participated in daily
physical education, down from 42 percent in the early 1990s.
Although you may want to blame video games and TV for the
decrease in physical activity in young children as well as teens,
parents (and grandparents) need to take some responsibility.
Parents are the ones who control the on-off switch on electronic
equipment. If you’re a parent (or grandparent), pull the plug and
encourage your kids (and grandkids) to go outside and play
instead of spending all their time killing intergalactic invaders.
Children and teens need to be involved in one hour each day of
moderate to vigorous activity, and moving the computer mouse
doesn’t qualify!
Better yet — get up off the couch and join them in biking, hiking, or
inline skating. (Make sure you check with your doctor before start-
ing any exercise program, and make sure your health insurance is
current if you haven’t exercised in a while!)
Even though you may think it’s too late for you to relive your child-
hood and keep physical activity on your daily calendar, it’s not too
late to influence the next generation — your children and grand-
children. Active children tend to have active parents — and grand-
parents, too! Stay active with your kids and grandkids by taking
hikes, riding bikes, dancing, or swimming. You can reap some bene-
fits for yourself and also help them avoid any future problems with
osteoporosis.
Even if you’re starting to gray, you need regular exercise. Exercise
is not only good for osteoporosis, but it also helps your heart, your
lungs, your mental outlook, your sex life (va-va-va-voom!), and the
way your clothes fit!

Moving Your Bones to 
Build More Bone
Does it sound odd that using your bones actually makes them
stronger? Doesn’t it at least seem logical that using your bones
wears them out faster? That’s not the case though.
Why do you need to use exercise to build bone instead of just rely-
ing on medication? Three reasons come to mind. Exercise is
 Inexpensive
 Effective
 Good for you and provides additional health benefits
Understanding why exercise
strengthens bone
Exercise that moves your muscles stimulates your bones. As the
muscle pulls against the bone it’s attached to, it stimulates the
bone to rebuild and become dense. One reason for this is that your
bone, like every other part of you, adapts to a certain level of activ-
ity. When you increase that activity level, you increase blood flow
to your bones, which results in increased nutrients for growth
going to your bones.
Building muscle helps build bone. Although exercise won’t com-
pletely prevent you from losing bone, it can help slow the process.
In addition, exercise can
 Strengthen muscles and reduce pain
 Improve your sense of balance and decrease your chance 
of falling
 Better your overall health
Utilizing weight-bearing exercise
and resistance training
Weight-bearing exercise and resistance training are both beneficial
for increasing muscle and bone mass and avoiding fractures.
Chapter 6: Exercising for Strong Bones 89

Weight bearing refers to any exercise that places your full weight
on your legs. In other words, if you’re standing, you’re weight bear-
ing! However, if you’re just standing there, you’re not exercising.
Weight-bearing exercise means using your bones and muscles to
work against gravity when you move.
Gravity keeps you on earth instead of letting you float through the
air like an astronaut. Because gravity is holding you down, it takes
effort to move your muscles and bones against it. If you’re moving
against gravity while standing up, you’re doing weight-bearing
exercise. Some examples of weight-bearing exercise are running,
walking, stair climbing, dancing, jumping rope, jogging in place, or
playing sports, such as tennis, volleyball, or racquetball.
Meanwhile, resistance training includes any activity that involves
overcoming resistance, such as pushing, pulling, or lifting. 
Some examples of resistance training are lifting weights, doing
push-ups or pull-ups, or using specially designed exercise
machines that allow you to push or pull against a set resistance
level.
Resistance exercise helps bone grow because the tendon the bone
is attached to pulls on the bone, encouraging bone-cell activity. As
your muscles become stronger, they continue to stress the bones,
stimulating more bone-building cells to grow.
Because water doesn’t create much resistance or allow weight
bearing, swimming isn’t classified in either of these categories.
However, because water exercise is good for your heart and
muscle strength, it’s a good choice of exercise for many people,
especially those unable to bear weight on joints because of pain or
other problems.
Developing an Exercise Plan
Okay, you’ve decided to start exercising. You’ve bought a bike, a
jump rope, three jogging suits, and a pair of inline skates, and
you’ve signed up for 90 sessions a month at the gym. Are you
ready? No, you’re not! Take off those skates! You need to spend
some time planning a serious exercise program before you go
flying off in a dozen directions, some of which may well result in
muscle strain, if not a few broken bones!
Remember that the key to an exercise program, or any other pro-
gram, is a reality check. What can you realistically do? What should
you realistically do? Although it seems obvious, most people skip
an important first step — talking to their doctor.
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
90

Having healthy bones isn’t going to do you any good if you exer-
cise yourself into collapse during the first week! Before you start
buying out the sporting goods store, ask yourself and your doctor
a few questions, such as:
 Do I have any physical limitations on exercise? If you’ve
lived a few years, you probably have some wounded areas.
How about the hand you broke three times playing racquet-
ball, the knee you twisted playing football, and the foot you
had surgery on last year? Most of you have a “weak spot”
acquired from years of daily living. Try not to aggravate any
existing problems when you start exercising.
 Is there any kind of exercise I shouldn’t be doing? The
restrictions may be health related. For example, if you have
exercise-induced asthma, running probably isn’t a good activ-
ity. If you have heart problems, your doctor may not want you
undertaking certain types of exercise.
Restrictions can also be common-sense restrictions. For exam-
ple, if you live on a major highway, jogging may not be a good
choice, unless you can go to a track somewhere. Ice-skating is
impractical if you live in Hawaii, unless you have an indoor
rink nearby.
 What do I enjoy doing? Suffice it to say that if you like what
you’re doing, you’ll probably keep doing it, and if you hate
what you’re doing, you’ll probably stop at the first muscle
twinge.
 How much will it cost? Unfortunately, cost is a major factor
in many people’s exercise plan. Gym memberships and sports
equipment can be expensive. Even walking can add up if, like
your co-author Sharon, you require expensive specialized ath-
letic shoes!
Setting an exercise schedule
If you try to do too much too fast, you may end up wearing your-
self out or even hurting yourself. If you overdo it at the beginning,
you may end up not doing any exercise at all in the long run.
Setting a schedule for exercise requires that you look realistically
at your schedule. If you plan to spend every lunch hour at the gym
from now until Christmas, don’t forget to factor in your once-a-week
lunch hour with your friends from high school and the garden
club’s weekly meeting. Are you really going to avoid all lunchtime
social engagements for the rest of your life, or even for a month?
Chapter 6: Exercising for Strong Bones 91

If you’re like most people, the answer is no. So be realistic. If you
can plan to spend three days a week at the gym, with some time on
the treadmill at home another day or two, you’ll still be way ahead.
Don’t feel like you need to do all your exercise at one time, either.
A walk at lunch and a bike ride with your kids after work adds up
to an hour a day, but it doesn’t feel like you’re spending all your
time exercising. Get creative — just make sure you get active!
Finding time in your life for exercise
If you’re working and your lunch hours are nonexistent, then you
need to squeeze exercise into some other time of the day. Many
gyms open early so that you can exercise before work. Going in the
morning may be a better plan than going after work, when all you
want to do is go home and collapse, if you’re motivated enough to
get up in the morning to go to the gym and make it to work on time.
If you’re a caretaker at home, finding time to get to the gym may be
difficult. Even though many gyms have childcare on-site, few have
eldercare. Being the caregiver for a parent or a disabled spouse
can affect your exercise schedule, and you may need to keep your
exercise regimen close to home.
One way to keep your family active and also spend quality time
together is to make exercise a family affair. How about bikes for the
whole bunch — and a baby carrier on the back for your youngest
member? Or just take a walk with your little guys — pushing the
stroller provides great resistance training!
Avoiding Injury While Exercising
You may be prone to initial hyperenthusiasm about exercising. Or
are you the type of person who has to be dragged, kicking and
screaming, into the gym? For people who begin any new project
with incredible amounts of misdirected enthusiasm, we need to
insert a word of warning here.
Overdoing exercise when you’re not used to it can cause muscle
damage that can permanently sideline you from the Macarena line.
Start slowly and work up to a more strenuous routine, and utilize
the gym’s trainers to help you pick the machines that will benefit
you most. Of course, the trainer can also coach you to use the
machines correctly. You can damage your muscles by exercising
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
92

incorrectly, not to mention the damage you’ll do if you drop
weights on your foot by mistake! Find out how to do exercises
properly from the beginning; your bones, muscles, and tendons
will all thank you!
Getting Down to the Nitty-Gritty:
Choosing an Exercise Routine
Sooner or later, you need to get down to business. All the running
shoes and color-coordinated outfits won’t help a bit until you start
putting them to use. To get started, pick a time, starting with 20 to
30 minutes a day, three days a week, as a recommendation. Then
pick an activity from the following list, and end your routine with
15 minutes of weight training, also known as strength or resistance
training.
Some weight-bearing cardiovascular workouts include
 Cross-country skiing
 Dancing
 Jumping rope
 Light jogging (make sure your knees are up to this!)
Chapter 6: Exercising for Strong Bones 93
Don’t let the muscleheads intimidate you
Does the thought of walking into the gym alone scare you to death? Find a friend or
drag your partner with you so you can discover how to exercise correctly together
(people typically don’t feel as foolish when they have an equally inept partner with
them) and also can cheer each other on.
Even if you go in a group of ten, you may find the gym intimidating at first. Some
gyms now cater just to women, or to the over-40 crowd, so don’t feel like the local
Beefy Studs R Us Gym Inc. is your only option. Visit a few places to get a feel for the
clientele before signing on any dotted lines.
Don’t be scared off, though, if everyone you see is fit and trim. After all, that’s what
you want to be too! Invest in a workout outfit or two if you feel conspicuous in the
sweats you’ve owned since high school. Make sure you’re comfortable in every-
thing so you don’t have to worry about parts of your outfit riding up or down during
your workout.

 Playing tennis
 Stair climbing
 Walking outside or on a treadmill
Do you want to painlessly increase your daily cardiovascular work-
out? Take the stairs instead of the elevator every chance you get —
and park at the back of the parking lot, instead of circling around
looking for the spot closest to the door.
Weight, or resistance, training allows you to be specific about the
bones you want to strengthen, so you want to add exercises target-
ing your hips, spine, and arms — the most frequent fracture sights
in osteoporosis. Weight training may give you a mental picture of
rippling muscles lifting a hundred pounds over their owner’s head,
but weight training can be very simple; you don’t even need to buy
weights. You can use anything that’s easy to hold, as long as you
have two of them so you work both arms equally.
Resistance training has benefits beyond bone building. A study
done at the University of Florida’s Colleges of Medicine and Health
and Human Performance showed that people working with weights
three times a week for six months were able to work out longer on
a treadmill.
When you begin resistance training, start with one- to two-pound
weights and work up gradually. If you can’t comfortably do eight
repetitions of an exercise, the weight you’re using is too heavy. If
you can do more than 15 repetitions easily, it’s too light. For some
of you, you may not be able to use any weights at all to start! Build
up at your own pace.
Follow these easy steps when using weights:
1. Take three seconds to lift the weights, and then hold in
position for one second.
2. Lower over another three seconds.
3. Breathe slowly, exhaling as you lift and inhaling as you
lower the weight.
4. Do one set of 8 to 15 repetitions (reps), starting with 8 to
12 reps and working up to 12 to 15 reps.
5. Rest for 30 to 60 seconds, and then do a second set.
Don’t forget to start with a weight you can lift only eight times.
Stay at that weight until you can lift it 12 to 15 times. Then add
weight until, once again, you can lift it only eight times. Add 
more weight each time you can easily do 12 to 15 reps.

Don’t exercise the same group of muscles two days in a row —
alternate exercises to allow muscles to recover.
Biceps curls with dumbbells
Biceps curls work your upper outer arms, or biceps. Biceps work to
bend your arm. Start cautiously if you have lower back or elbow
problems.
Doing the exercise
1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and stand with your feet
as far apart as the width of your hips.
You can also do this exercise sitting in a chair.
2. Keep your arms at your sides with palms facing 
your body.
(See Figure 6-1.)
Figure 6-1: Keep your elbows close to your body for the entire exercise.
Chapter 6: Exercising for Strong Bones 95

3. Bend your right arm up, keeping it close to your shoulder.
Turn your palm as you lift so that it’s facing your shoulder
at the top of the movement. 
4. Lower the dumbbell slowly; repeat with your left hand.
(See Figure 6-1.)
Doing it correctly
Do:
 Keep your elbows close to your body.
 Keep your knees relaxed and back straight.
 Lower the weight slowly; don’t just let it fall back.
Triceps kickback
Triceps kickback works your triceps, which are the upper inner
part of your arm. Triceps work to straighten your arm. Start slowly
if you have elbow or lower back problems.
Doing the exercise
You need a bench or something to lean on to do this exercise. 
1. Hold your dumbbell in your right hand and stand with
your left side next to your bench — or whatever you’re
using to lean on.
(See Figure 6-2.)
2. Lean forward at the hips until your upper body is at a 
45-degree angle.
3. Use your left hand to lean on the bench, or whatever
you’re using for a bench, for support.
4. Bend your right elbow so that your upper arm is parallel
to the floor, your forearm is perpendicular to it, and your
palm faces in.
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
96

Figure 6-2: Don’t let your upper arm move or your shoulder drop below waist level.
5. Hold your upper arm still and straighten your arm until
the end of your dumbbell is pointing straight down.
6. Slowly bend your arm to lower the weight.
7. Repeat with your left arm after you complete the set.
(Refer to Figure 6-2.)
Doing it correctly
Do:
 Keep your abdominal muscles pulled in and your knees
relaxed.
 Straighten your arm but keep your elbow relaxed.
 Hold your upper arm still.
 Keep your shoulder above waist level.
Chapter 6: Exercising for Strong Bones 97

Overhead press
This exercise works the shoulder muscles (deltoids), the upper
back (upper trapezius), triceps, and the sides of rib cage (the
oblique muscles).
Doing the exercise
1. Stand with your feet slightly apart.
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms at shoul-
der height.
Keep your elbows bent and the weights about six inches
from your body, with your palms facing outward.
3. Slowly lift the weight over your head with your arm
straight.
4. Hold for three seconds, and then lower slowly to your
starting position.
(Check out Figure 6-3.)
Figure 6-3: Be sure to hold the weights so your palms are facing outwards.
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
98

Doing it correctly
Do:
 Keep your back straight.
 Keep your knees relaxed.
 Hold for less than three seconds if you’re afraid you’re going
to drop the weights on your head!
Knee extensors
Knee extensors work your hips and legs to help strengthen them.
Never bounce your leg while doing this exercise, or you’ll tighten
the muscles unnecessarily and risk a knee injury.
As your legs get stronger through your exercise routines, you may
want to purchase some ankle weights to help continue increasing
your strength. Ankle weights are soft weights, about ten pounds
each, that strap around your ankles with Velcro. You can usually
find them in any store that carries athletic equipment.
Doing the exercise
You need a chair or something to sit on to do this exercise.
1. Sit in the chair with your knees six inches apart and 
a small, rolled hand towel under your lower thigh to 
elevate it slightly.
2. Slowly lift your right foot until your leg is straight out in
front of you, and then slowly lower your foot back down
to the floor.
3. Repeat 8 to 15 times for each leg.
(See Figure 6-4.)
Chapter 6: Exercising for Strong Bones 99

Figure 6-4: The proper way to do knee extensors.
Doing it correctly
Do:
 Keep your abdominal muscles pulled in.
 Lift from the knee, not from the hip.
 Move slowly and make sure not to jerk your knees.
Hip extensors
This exercise goes a long way toward strengthening your hips 
and legs.
Doing the exercise
You need a sturdy chair to lean on for balance. You also need the
ankle weights that we mention in the “Knee extensors” exercise in
the previous section.
1. Holding onto the back of the chair, bend forward at your
waist at about a 45-degree angle.
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
100

2. Slowly lift one leg behind you as straight as you can and
as high as possible.
3. Slowly lower your leg back down to the floor.
4. Repeat 8 to 15 times with each leg.
(Check out Figure 6-5.)
Figure 6-5: The proper way to do hip extensors.
Doing it correctly
Do: 
 Keep your legs straight.
 Make sure to not bend your upper body when lifting your leg.
 Build up your repetitions as you get stronger.
Hip flexors
Hip flexors help strengthen your hips and legs.
Chapter 6: Exercising for Strong Bones 101

Doing the exercise
You need a sturdy chair to hold onto for balance. You can also use
ankle weights as you progress.
1. Holding onto the back of the chair, slowly bring your
knee as close to your chest as you can without bending
your other knee or your waist.
(See Figure 6-6.)
2. Slowly lower your leg back to the floor, repeating 8 to 15
times on each side.
Figure 6-6: The proper way to do hip flexors.
Doing it correctly
Do:
 Keep the knee you’re not lifting straight.
 Keep your back straight.
 Lower your leg slowly.
 Add ankle weights as you build up strength.
Part II: Keeping Your Bones Healthy 
102

Leg lifts
Leg lifts help build your leg, abdominal, and hip muscles.
Doing the exercise
You need a chair to sit on. Add ankle weights as you build strength,
1. Sit on a chair and slide forward until your buttocks are
near the edge of the seat.
Support yourself by holding on to the seat with both
hands.
2. Lift both feet together two to three inches off the floor
and hold for two seconds.
(See Figure 6-7.)
3. Slowly lower legs to the floor.
Repeat 8 to 15 times.
Figure 6-7: The proper way to do leg lifts.
Chapter 6: Exercising for Strong Bones 103

Doing it correctly
Do:
 Hold on to the sides of the chair so you don’t slide to the
floor!
 Add ankle weights as you build up strength.
 Raise your legs a little higher as you build strength.
If you’ve experienced spinal compression fractures, avoid any
exercises that flex the spine. If you suffer from these types of frac-
tures, start exercising under a physical therapist’s guidance. (See
Chapters 7 and 13 for more info on spinal compression fractures.)

Facing the Consequences 
of Bones Gone Bad
In This Chapter
 Realizing that bone loss is a silent disease
 Understanding fragility fractures
 Name that fracture: Knowing which bone is broken
You’re probably quite aware that aging brings changes to your
fragile skin; the proof is in the mirror every day. Although you
don’t visibly see the changes to your insides like you see the wrin-
kles on the outside, those internal changes are there nonetheless.
Similar to many of the other changes that come with increasing
age, people don’t notice the changes in their bones until it’s too
late. In other words, osteoporosis is a silent disease. You don’t
have any pain until you break a bone!
In this chapter, we explain the different types of fractures that you
can experience when you have osteoporosis and the types of prob-
lems that can occur as a result. Knowing how and why bones break
in osteoporosis is the first step in understanding how to prevent
fractures.
Aging and Your Bones
As we discuss in Chapter 2, bones are beautifully engineered and
marvelously efficient — until something goes awry. You first need
to understand why keeping your bones strong and healthy is so
important.
Early detection and preventive treatment before fractures occur is
the vital key to treating osteoporosis. (Check out Chapter 3 for the
best ways to keep your bones strong.)

Osteoporosis is somewhat similar to high blood pressure (hyper-
tension). For instance, if you have high blood pressure, you may
not know it, because people rarely experience any symptoms from
an elevated blood pressure. Untreated hypertension causes damage
to blood vessels over many years. But if high blood pressure is
diagnosed early, its devastating consequences (stroke and heart
disease) can be prevented.
When you develop a fracture from osteoporosis, it’s likely that you
have had the problem for years. In other words, by the time you
have an osteoporotic fracture, bone is already quite fragile. You
can lose bone at the rate of 5 percent per year (for example during
menopause) and not experience any pain at all. So unless you dis-
cover you have osteoporosis at an early stage, before you have any
symptoms (see Chapter 9), you’ll already have weak bones at the
time of your first symptom, which can be a devastating and even
life-threatening fracture.
Don’t get the impression that as soon as a fracture occurs, no treat-
ment can help. Studies have shown that bone density can improve
even at later stages, and fracture rates can be reduced. A recent
estimate by the Office of the Surgeon General reports that by the
year 2020, nearly one-half of Americans will be at risk for develop-
ing fractures, if doctors don’t make changes in their approach to
early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. Table 7-1 shows what
the lifetime risk of fracture is broken down by age and gender.

Facing Fragility Fractures
Your doctor may often use the phrase “fragility fracture” when you
experience a broken bone with minimal trauma. You probably
know that experiencing a fracture with normal, healthy, strong
bones is certainly possible. For instance, a child who falls from a
tree and fractures an arm can have normal bone strength, but the
impact is still too great to withstand a break. On the other hand,
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
108

people with osteoporosis or other problems, such as osteomalacia
(adult rickets), can develop a fracture without a significant injury.
Hip fractures, vertebral compression fractures, and wrist fractures
all should alert your physician to investigate your situation care-
fully and further delve into the possibility of you having lost bone
strength. In infancy, the occurrence of multiple fractures should
alert your pediatrician to the possibility of osteogenesis imperfecta.
(See Chapter 4 for more on osteogenesis imperfecta.)
Your doctor also may diagnosis osteoporosis if you’re unfortunate
enough to require surgery on a broken bone. During surgery, your
orthopedic surgeon can directly assess your bone quality. She may
call a consultation after the procedure because your bones appear
thin during the operation “like potato chips.” You don’t want to
hear this term when describing your bones, do you? (And to think,
you don’t get any sour cream and chive dip to go with them.)
Increasing evidence suggests that any fracture in women or men
older than 55 can be the first indication of a metabolic bone prob-
lem. Other fractures seen in osteoporosis include rib fractures,
fractures of the arm (humerus), and pelvic bone fractures.
Finally, multiple fractures, even with significant trauma, should
alert your physician to the possibility of a metabolic bone disease
and prompt referral to a specialist.
For example, one of your co-author’s nephews experienced three
fractures over a two-year period while playing ice hockey. His doc-
tors started him on vitamin D supplements, because he lived in
New Hampshire, where the exposure to sunlight is variable. He
hasn’t had a fracture since!
Breaking Bones – Different Types
of Fractures
Certain types of fractures are more commonly associated with
osteoporosis and other bone diseases. In this section we define
these common fracture types and the difficulties they can cause.
Falling on outstretched arms
Wrist fractures, often called Colles’ fractures, typically occur as a
result of osteoporosis. These breaks usually happen in the radius,
Chapter 7: Facing the Consequences of Bones Gone Bad 109

the ulna, or some of the other small bones in your wrist (see Fig-
ure 7-1). Colles’ fractures often occur when you fall and put your
arm out to break your fall.
Figure 7-1: A wrist or Colles’ fracture is very common in people with osteoporo-
sis. Darker lines show where the wrist might break.
Treatment requires casting or some other form of immobilization.
Sometimes you may require surgery. You may experience loss of
motion of your wrist, but this type of fracture isn’t nearly as devas-
tating as a hip or spinal fracture.
However, the occurrence of a wrist fracture is clearly a warning
sign that you may have an overall reduction in the strength of your
bones. A Colles’ fracture is therefore considered a fragility fracture,
and your doctor needs to evaluate you for the possibility of osteo-
porosis or other bone disorders.
Who are more prone to wrist fractures? Among American women,
the incidence of wrist fractures increases rapidly at the time of
menopause and plateaus at about 700 per 100,000 persons per year
after age 60.

“I broke my hip! Or was it 
my femur?”
What is commonly referred to as a “broken hip” is actually a frac-
ture of the femur, the longest and heaviest bone in your body. The
fracture is usually found at the neck of the femur, where it con-
nects to the pelvis.
More than 300,000 people fracture their hip each year in the United
States. In fact, hip fractures (see Figure 7-2) are the second most
common type of osteoporotic fracture.
Figure 7-2: A “hip fracture” is actually a fracture of the femur, oftentimes in the
femoral neck, which is an area that is particularly weak.
Ninety percent of all hip fractures are related to osteoporosis. Hip
fractures are devastating and can have long-term consequences. A
hip fracture
 Requires a trip to the emergency room. In the United States,
in 1995, hip fractures resulted in 800,000 visits to emergency
rooms.
 Requires hospitalization with period of immobility. In 2003,
in the United States, there were 300,000 hospital admissions
for hip fracture (defined as a fracture of the head of the
Hip
fractures
Chapter 7: Facing the Consequences of Bones Gone Bad 111

femur) in one year. There could be more fractures not
included in this analysis.
 Often requires surgery. You need a new hip or a pin in your
hip. (See Chapter 13 for more details about the surgery after
hip fractures.) Surgery on your hip can be complicated by
very serious problems including infection, pneumonia, and
blood clots in your legs or lungs.
Fractures of the femoral neck are very close to the hip joint.
As a result, doctors can’t immobilize this area with a cast.
In addition a hip fracture can lead to
 Increased disability from hip surgery. One-fourth of all people
with a hip fracture become disabled in the year after their
fracture. Hip fractures result yearly in more than 7 million
days of reduced activity.
 Increased chance of ending up in a long-term care facility.
Almost 75 percent of all nursing home admissions are related
to hip fractures from osteoporosis, which accounts for
approximately 6,000 admissions yearly. Almost half the
expense of hip fracture healthcare is paid to nursing homes.
(In 1995, 180,000 people ended up in a chronic care facility
because of a hip fracture.)
 Reduced life expectation. Hip fracture affects your health and
ability to care for yourself (your risk of dying even!).
If you were able to get around without a walker or other aid at
the time of your hip fracture, fracturing you hip will almost
triple (2.8 times) your risk of dying in the next three months,
compared to people who don’t have a fracture.
According to one study of women older than 65, each standard
deviation decrease in bone density at the hip resulted in a 30 per-
cent increase in total mortality. (See Chapter 9 for more info on
standard deviations and bone density testing.)
Although we aren’t intending to scare you, we want you to be aware
that hip fractures are serious health problems that can result in
your dying sooner than you would have without a fracture. The
key is to avoid fracturing a hip. How can you stay alive longer by
being fracture free? Prevention, prevention, prevention!
Falling and hip fractures
“Grandma fell and broke her hip.” You’ve undoubtedly heard some-
one say this or you’ve even said it yourself. She actually fractured
her femur, probably near the femoral neck.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
112

Some studies show that occasionally people don’t “fall and break
their bone” at all. Instead they have a fracture of the femur from
the simple stress of putting their foot down on a step. So the frac-
ture causes the fall and not the other way around! How often this
actually happens is difficult to say. Nonetheless, people in the
healthcare field definitely want to prevent as many falls as possible
by changing the environment and preventing hazards.
Some people are more prone to falling than others; they have
what’s known as postural instability. Your co-author Sharon is one
of these people. If you’re one, you undoubtedly already know it.
You may walk into walls and trip over a crack in the sidewalk.
Doctors aren’t quite sure what causes postural instability, but it
may be because you have visual issues, don’t judge spatial rela-
tionships well, can’t decipher depth perception, or have poor con-
trast sensitivity.
Whatever your reason for being spatially challenged (or as your
grandchild may say, a klutz), you need to be especially careful
when you have osteoporosis. If you’re a klutz, you know you’re
going to fall or trip sooner or later, and every fall increases your
chance for injury.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) statistics indicate that one-
third of all people older than 65 fall each year, and that the major-
ity of fractures result from falls. The good news is that most falls
occur in your own home.
Why is this good news? It’s good news, because you can control
your own environment. You can’t control the supermarket that
mops aisle one and forgets to put out a “Be Careful” sign, but you
can determine where you place your furniture and the kind of rugs
you have on your stairs. (See Chapter 13 for more on falling and
fractures.) You can also take preventive measures to avoid a fall.
(And make sure to stay off that ladder!)
Chapter 7: Facing the Consequences of Bones Gone Bad 113
What’s a stress fracture?
Many older people who fall can’t really explain how they got to the ground. A spon-
taneous break in the femoral neck that results in a fall is called a stress fracture.
We really don’t know how many hip fractures are due to stress fractures and how
many are due to an impact to the bone from hitting the ground.

Developing a dowager’s hump
The phrase “dowager’s hump” paints a vivid picture. You may
think of your great-aunt or great-grandmother instantly, because
you imagine an elderly woman with loss of height, hunched for-
ward with a forward curvature of the spine. A dowager’s hump is
caused by compression fractures of the spine, called vertebral
compression fractures.
A compression fracture is a break of the vertebrae in your back that
typically changes the height of the vertebral body. Multiple com-
pression fractures (see Figure 7-3) can result in a loss of up to five
inches in height.
Figure 7-3: Compression fractures are responsible for the loss of height in many
people with osteoporosis.
The dowager’s hump appearance, more technically known as
kyphosis, is caused by the inner part of the vertebrae collapsing.
This creates what is known as a wedge fracture (see Figure 7-4)
and can result in the spine bending forward.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
114

Figure 7-4: Multiple wedge fractures of the vertebrae can result in a 
“dowager’s hump.”
Compression fractures caused by osteoporosis can occur without
a trauma. You don’t have to fall from a ladder or be hit by a bicycle
to have vertebral compression fractures.
If you have severe osteoporosis, a sneeze or cough can fracture a
vertebra. Up to 30 percent of compression fractures occur when
the patient is in bed! Nagging back pain may be the only symptom
you have from vertebral compression fractures.
Chapter 7: Facing the Consequences of Bones Gone Bad 115
Grading vertebral fractures
The vast majority of vertebral compression fractures don’t come to medical atten-
tion and are referred to as asymptomatic fractures. The International Osteoporosis
Foundation (IOF) is encouraging radiologists to report a height loss of 20 percent in
any vertebral body as a fracture so as to increase reporting and reduce ambiguity.

Although compression fractures don’t result in admissions to the
hospital as frequently as hip fractures, you can become just as dis-
abled. Furthermore, the pain can be just as severe if not more so
because your facture can significantly interfere with your quality of
life. If your compression fractures are numerous and severe, the
pain may never disappear.
Back pain and spinal deformities aren’t the only consequences of
compression fractures. The change in your skeletal structure can
compress your abdominal organs, which can then lead to a pro-
truding belly, constipation, decreased appetite, and weight loss. If
you suffer from compression fractures in your thoracic spine (the
middle part of your back), your lungs may become partially com-
pressed, which can make you short of breath.
Studies have shown that each vertebral compression fracture
reduces the ability of your lungs to expand by around 10 percent.
With three or more fractures, you may lose enough lung capacity
to cause untreatable lung disease.
Only around 10 percent of all people in their 80s are actually
treated for their osteoporotic vertebral fractures. If you’ve lost
inches, see your doctor!

The incredible shrinking person
If you’re getting shorter by the year, you may assume that you have osteoporosis.
Although that diagnosis is certainly possible, you may also have another disease
process that is responsible for your being less able to reach the top pantry shelf.
Some other causes of height loss as you age include
 Compression fractures of vertebral bodies due to osteomalacia
 Juvenile epiphysitis (Scheuermann’s disease), which affects the thoracic spine
and causes the middle of your back to hunch forward
 Scoliosis (an S-shaped curvature of the spine that starts in childhood and slowly
progresses through adulthood)
 Tumors involving the bones of the back
 Severe degeneration of the discs (the soft cartilage material in between the
vertebral bodies)
So although vertebral compression fractures may result in loss of height, if you’re
losing inches, see your doctor to be sure you receive the proper diagnosis and 
treatment.

Don’t forget these additional facts about compression fractures if
you’re a trivia buff:
 Vertebral compression fractures are the most common osteo-
porotic fractures. More than 700,000 occur each year in the
United States.
 Approximately 25 percent of all postmenopausal women have
compression fractures.
 Having compression fractures can increase your mortality
rate by 15 percent. They can lead to chronic pain and severely
impact your quality of life, in addition to leading to the
dreaded dowager’s hump.

Chapter 8
Finding (and Paying For) a
Doctor to Treat Osteoporosis
In This Chapter
 Choosing the right specialist
 Finding the best doctor for you
 Working with your doctor
 Looking into your insurance coverage
C
hoosing a doctor to treat or diagnose osteoporosis can be
confusing. With some diseases, the kind of doctor you choose
is pretty cut and dried. For example, if you had an eye problem,
you wouldn’t go to a heart surgeon; you’d go to an ophthalmolo-
gist. But finding a doctor who only specializes in osteoporosis isn’t
as easy. In fact, you can find many types of doctors with an interest
in osteoporosis in several different medical specialties.
Finding the right doctor under any circumstance can be a time-
consuming and frustrating task. In this chapter we discuss the spe-
cialists that treat osteoporosis, a plan to find the right doctor for
you, ways for you and your doctor to work together on your plan
of care, and a lowdown on paying for your doctor’s visits and treat-
ment with your insurance company’s help.
I Looked in the Phonebook, 
But I Couldn’t Find Any 
Bone-ologists
Obstetricians deliver babies; pediatricians take care of children.
But when you look in the phonebook for doctors specializing in
osteoporosis, you may have no idea where to start. You certainly

won’t find any listings for bone-ologists. So where do you start in
your search for a doctor to diagnose and treat osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis accounts for 2.5 million doctor visits and 400,000
hospital admissions yearly, and yet not one specialty is devoted
strictly to osteoporosis. A family practitioner or gynecologist first
sees most women for osteoporosis before possibly recommending
a specialist.
Seeing your family doctor
Starting with your family doctor, who may be a family medicine
specialist or an internal medicine specialist, doesn’t hurt. Some
internists or family medicine doctors have a special interest in
osteoporosis and may be perfectly capable of handling your care. 
If your doctor feels you need someone whose primary practice is
osteoporosis, she may send you to any number of specialists (see
the next section, “Choosing a specialist”).
However, one large study showed that osteoporosis is more likely
to be diagnosed and treated by specialists rather than family prac-
titioners or internists, with 96 percent of metabolic bone specialists
diagnosing and treating osteoporosis in women whose osteoporo-
sis was diagnosed by bone mineral testing as opposed to 75 per-
cent of rheumatologists, 63 percent of endocrinologists, and 53
percent of general internists.
If your doctor doesn’t want to send you to a specialist, ask her
why. It may be that she is especially interested in osteoporosis and
keeps up-to-date with the latest information. If so, that’s fine.
However, if you feel more comfortable with a specialist, tell your
family doc.
A doctor who knows your medical history well could be your best
bet for treatment, as long as she keeps up with the latest treatment
information and takes osteoporosis seriously.
Choosing a specialist
Many different medical specialties are available where practitioners
may choose to treat patients with osteoporosis. Your primary doctor
can help you decide which one of the following is best for you:
 Rheumatologists: Rheumatologists (your co-author Dr.
O’Connor is one) diagnose and treat diseases of the bones,
joints, and muscles, including autoimmune diseases such as
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
120

lupus. Rheumatology is a subspecialty of internal medicine
and requires board certification in both internal medicine and
rheumatology.
 Endocrinologists: Endocrinologists treat diseases of the endo-
crine system, which is certainly no surprise. The endocrine
system comprises the glands and hormones that control your
body’s metabolic activity. Endocrinologists treat diabetes, thy-
roid problems, and pituitary diseases. Endocrinology, like
rheumatology, is a subspecialty of internal medicine.
Endocrinologists may be especially interested in osteoporosis
because endocrine problems often result in osteoporosis.
Refer to Chapter 3 for a complete discussion of risk factors.
 Geriatricians: Geriatricians treat geriatric patients (also
known as senior citizens). When are you in this category?
Although most people would say “never,” the accepted defini-
tion of “geriatric” is age 65 and above.
Because osteoporosis is often, but not always, a disease of
aging, many geriatricians have a special interest in treating it.
 Gynecologists: Because women comprise the largest group of
osteoporosis patients, many gynecologists, doctors who treat
women’s health, also treat patients with osteoporosis. If
you’re a man with osteoporosis, though, you may feel a little
funny sitting in the waiting room.
 Orthopedic surgeons: Orthopedic surgeons specialize in the
treatment of bones and muscles. Some are interested in treat-
ing osteoporosis, while some aren’t.
 Physiatrists: Physiatrists are often confused with everything
from psychologists to podiatrists! Physiatrists specialize in
physical medicine and rehabilitation, dealing with acute
injuries as well as chronic conditions such as arthritis and
osteoporosis.
Taking extra courses in bone:
Metabolic bone specialists
Some doctors have taken additional training in interpreting bone
mineral density tests; a doctor who has taken this type of course
usually has a special interest in osteoporosis.
An international society of bone densitometry (a mouthful if 
there ever was one!), called the International Society of Clinical
Densitometry, offers courses for physicians who are interested in
Chapter 8: Finding (and Paying For) a Doctor to Treat Osteoporosis 121

discovering how to interpret bone mineral density studies. One of
your authors (Dr. O’Connor) has taken such a course and therefore
has special expertise in interpreting bone densitometry studies.
Ask your doctor if she has taken such courses.
Some rheumatologists, endocrinologists, and orthopedic surgeons
who work in academic teaching hospitals do nothing other than
diagnose and treat patients with metabolic bone disease, because
their research involves studying bone problems.
If your case is unusual or difficult to treat, a metabolic bone spe-
cialist is your best bet. However, most metabolic bone specialists
practice in large university settings, which may be impractical to
visit regularly if you live in the middle of nowhere.
You can have an initial consultation at a large university and then
allow your doctor at home to follow up. This option may be good
for people who don’t live close to a large university but can spend
a few days out of town seeing a specialist.
Preparing to Meet the Doctor
Making a list of important questions before seeing any doctor for
the first time or when you’re going to discuss a specific problem is
always a good idea. For some reason many people’s anxiety levels
shoot through the roof when visiting the doctor’s office, often
causing them to forget why they came in. Maybe the antiseptic
smell or the white lab coats do it, but something about the whole
environment can be frightening. Be prepared and make a list so
you don’t forget.
Everyone’s list will be a little different, but use the following basic
questions to get started:
 Do you treat many patients with osteoporosis?
 What kind of diagnostic tests do you usually conduct?
 Will you call me when you get the results, or do I need a
follow-up appointment?
 How can I reach you if I have questions?
 Will my insurance pay for the tests to be done?
 What is your background in treating osteoporosis? Have you
taken additional training to treat it?
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
122

You may not be comfortable asking the doctor questions, because
you were raised not to question the doctor. Don’t worry about
asking the doctor for clarification. Most doctors today are interested
in educating their patients and want you to ask questions about
anything that isn’t clear to you. So ask away! And if your doctor
doesn’t feel that way, she may not be the right doctor for you!
Before you even walk in the door, you can ask the office staff the
following questions:
 What medical school did the physician attend?
 Where did the physician receive her postgraduate training?
 Is the physician board certified?
 Does the physician’s office have its own bone density 
equipment?
 With what hospitals is the physician affiliated? Some insur-
ance companies have this data available on their Web sites.
The Web might list the medical schools of the physicians who
participate in their network, for example.
Getting ready for your 
first appointment
Before you go for your first appointment, put together a manila
folder of “must have’s,” so you don’t forget anything. Make sure to
put the following items in the folder:
 Your list of questions (See “Preparing to Meet the Doctor” ear-
lier in this chapter.)
 Your medical records, including blood tests done within the
last two years and consultations with other physicians
 The scans from your Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA
scan), a specific type of test that measures your bone mineral
density (see Chapter 9 for more on the DXA scan)
 Any X-rays (the actual X-rays, not just the reports)
 A list of drugs you’re taking for your osteoporosis, as well as a
list of all other medications and vitamins you take with
dosages, including any over-the-counter (OTC) medications
Chapter 8: Finding (and Paying For) a Doctor to Treat Osteoporosis 123

 A list of all other health issues you have, because they may
affect your doctor’s recommendations
 A list of your other doctors’ names and phone numbers just in
case your doctor wants to speak with them to coordinate
your care
Making sure you’ve found Dr. Right
Finding the right doctor isn’t always easy. Even if the doctor you’re
seeing has the best reputation in town, he may not be right for 
you if:
 He makes you feel uncomfortable asking questions.
 He doesn’t answer your questions to your satisfaction.
 He doesn’t call you back within a reasonable time when you
have concerns.
You may need more than one visit to figure out whether your new
doctor is right for you. Your first visit may be awkward for a number
of reasons: you’re nervous, the doctor is having a bad day, the
office seems disorganized with long waiting times, or the front-desk
staff is unfriendly. Don’t let one bad experience scare you away, if
you feel comfortable with the doctor otherwise.
Team Tactics: Setting Up a Care
Plan with Your Doctor
When making a plan for treating osteoporosis, you need to work
closely with your doctor. The days of doctors just telling you what
to do and you doing it, without understanding why or for how long,
are long gone. Most doctors today are well aware that patients
want and have a right to be involved in their own care and to
understand what medications they’re taking and why.
The first step in treatment is diagnosis. Ask your doctor if she
plans to do a DXA scan (see Chapter 9 for the full details about the
scan) to assess your baseline bone density. If she says no, ask why!
Determining whether your treatment is helpful if you don’t know
where you started from, as a basis for comparison, is difficult. Ask
how often she wants to do scans; make sure your insurance will
pay for scans at the timeframe she recommends. (See “Getting the
Most Out of Your Insurance Plan” later in this chapter for impor-
tant insurance info.)
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
124

After you have a diagnosis, formulate a treatment plan with your
doctor. Every treatment plan has several facets to consider:
 Prognosis: How is osteoporosis likely to affect me? Your
family history and your current health history, including med-
ication, influence your prognosis.
 Medications: Your treatment plan may include medication to
prevent osteoporosis or slow bone loss, as well as supple-
ments such as calcium and vitamin D. (See Chapter 10 for
more on medications and osteoporosis.)
Make sure you discuss with your doctor other medications
(including all OTC meds, vitamins, and supplements) you’re
taking for other medical conditions. She needs to know the
specific drugs and dosages to make sure she doesn’t pre-
scribe something for your osteoporosis that interacts with
your other medication.
 Dietary recommendations: Your doctor can suggest ideas for
increasing calcium and other necessary nutrients in your diet.
(See Chapter 5 for more on osteoporosis and diet.)
 Exercise plan: An exercise plan doesn’t have to mean spend-
ing hours at the gym. Simple weight training or just increasing
your normal physical activity can all be part of your exercise
plan. (See Chapter 6 for more on exercise and osteoporosis.)
 Reassessment: You may need to see your doctor regularly to
gauge whether or not your current treatments are effective. A
plan isn’t worth anything if it isn’t getting the desired results.
Your doctor may also be able to supply you with a list of support
groups for osteoporosis sufferers in your area. Many local hospi-
tals run monthly support meetings where you can connect with
people who can relate to what you’re going through — and possi-
bly make some new friends, too.
Depression is common in people with chronic illness. Don’t be
afraid to mention to your doctor — or your family members, for
that matter — that you’re struggling with depression. Your doctor
may be able to refer you to a therapist specially trained in the area
of aging, or to a support group. The worst thing you can do when
you’re hurting emotionally is to hide it — resources are available
to help you through tough emotional times.
Your physician may need to collect more data before making a
decision about your treatment, so don’t be upset if she wants to
see you again before giving out medications or specific plans.
Making sure your doctor has all the pertinent information before
deciding on a treatment is in your best interest.
Chapter 8: Finding (and Paying For) a Doctor to Treat Osteoporosis 125

Being honest with your doctor
Some people sometimes tell their doctor whatever it is he wants to
hear, even if they know perfectly well they’re not going to follow his
recommendations. Obviously, doing so isn’t in your best interest!
Even if you think your doctor will be angry with you, don’t tell him
you’re willing to do something you know perfectly well you won’t!
Be completely honest and upfront about your personal needs and
limitations. And if you find yourself unable to be honest with your
doctor, ask yourself why. Does he get upset when you question
him, or does he refuse to discuss alternatives? It may be time to
find another doctor!
Discussing your diet and exercise habits
Diet and exercise are two prime areas that seem most likely to bring
out the fibber in people, but they’re certainly not the only two.
Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking or drinking aren’t too
far behind.
Many people don’t like to admit to their doctor that, despite their
heartfelt promises in the office, they probably aren’t going to start
going to the gym four times a week — at least, not for more than a
week or two! And your intention to eliminate coffee and soda from
your diet and to add three cups of cottage cheese a day — well, are
you seriously going to do it? Even more important, are you going to
tell your doctor you did do it at your next visit?
Even at the risk of feeling like you’re letting your doctor down, be
honest about your shortcomings. If you admit you’re unlikely to
head for the gym in January, your doctor may come up with a more
practical plan — one that lets you exercise in your own home. If
the thought of putting on a leotard — or even sweats — at the local
Muscle Busters gym has you hiding behind the couch, admit that
you’re too embarrassed to set foot in a gym staffed with and popu-
lated by twenty-somethings. Your doctor may know of exercise
programs catering to seniors, or programs designed for people
who haven’t exercised in a while.
If you didn’t make all these changes but tell your doctor you did,
he may be baffled at your lack of response. Or, being a fairly astute
person, he may surmise that you’re not being entirely truthful 
with him!
The same policy of telling the truth at all costs applies to lifestyle
changes. If you’re still smoking, admit it and ask for help in quitting
or at least cutting down. If you hate cottage cheese, ask for some
suggestions for other calcium-rich foods.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
126

Discussing medication
Don’t lie about taking your medication. If you stopped taking it two
months ago because it upset your stomach, tell your doctor. Another
brand or type of medication may work fine, or he may suggest a
different way for you to take your medication to minimize upset.
But if your doctor thinks you’re still taking your medication, he
may be baffled by your lack of response, not realizing that your
lack of response is related to your lack of taking your medicine. He
may then prescribe a stronger medication or higher dose, which
could be unnecessary or even harmful to you.
Being honest with yourself
Being honest with yourself is just another part of being honest with
your doctor. You probably know yourself pretty well, and you know
what you are and aren’t going to do, even in the name of being
healthier. You can’t admit to your doctor that you’re never going to
follow an exercise program if you don’t first admit it to yourself!
The problem with lying to yourself is that you cheat yourself out of
possible alternatives. If you promise yourself that you’re going to
go to the gym faithfully in March, you may drift into April before
admitting that you missed the boat. If you would have admitted in
February that going to the gym would never be part of your after-
work routine, you could have made an alternate plan, such as walk-
ing three times a week during your lunch hour in the mall. Yes, you
may have stopped at the winter clearance sales racks once or
twice a week, but you certainly would have gotten more exercise
than you did by promising yourself you’d get to the gym and never
getting there.
The only person who suffers the consequences of deceiving 
yourself — or your doctor — is you. Be honest about what you 
can and can’t do so you can maximize your treatment plan within
your own limitations.
Keeping in touch after your visit
Your doctor will most likely suggest a follow-up appointment in a
month or two to check on your progress. Keep your follow-up
appointments! As busy as you may be, you can’t substitute any-
thing for a face-to-face visit.
Chapter 8: Finding (and Paying For) a Doctor to Treat Osteoporosis 127

Although you may be tempted just to phone in a report, telephone
consultations never provide adequate care. Most physicians are
hurried and can’t provide the same attention to detail over the
telephone as they can when you’re in the office.
Getting the Most Out of 
Your Insurance Plan
You may have a love-hate relationship with your insurance provider.
On one hand, knowing you’re protected against outrageous bills in
case of illness is good. On the other hand, how can you make heads
or tails out of what your policy covers and what it doesn’t cover?
Because hundreds, if not thousands, of variations of policies are
available on what health insurers will and won’t pay, we really
can’t tell you what your insurance will cover when it comes to
osteoporosis testing and visits. If you’re covered by insurance,
read your insurance manuals (you know, the 500-page books you
tossed in a closet somewhere) thoroughly to see what coverage
you have and if you need referrals from your primary care physi-
cian. You may also need to call your company representatives for
clarification of the rules, if they seem unclear.
Calling back more than once may be worthwhile if the first person
you speak to doesn’t seem sure about your coverage, or if her
advice seems to contradict what’s in the book. The next person you
speak with may give more satisfactory answers. If she does, write
down her name and keep detailed notes about the conversation!
Although insurance companies differ, we can give you the basic
guidelines for Medicare coverage, as well as a summary of laws
passed by different states about osteoporosis.
According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF),
Medicare will pay for a DXA scan every two years if you’re in one
of the following groups:
 An estrogen-deficient woman, as defined by her doctor
 An individual with vertebral deformities, such as scoliosis
 An individual on long-term corticosteroid therapy
 An individual with primary hyperparathyroidism
 An individual being monitored to assess response of efficacy
of a FDA-approved osteoporosis drug therapy
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
128

People who are or will be taking the equivalent of 7.5 mg a day of
prednisone, a corticosteroid, may be able to have DXA scans more
frequently than every two years.
Seven states, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas, have mandated private insurance
coverage for osteoporosis-related diagnostic testing and treatment.
Some, such as Kentucky, require insurers to offer baseline bone
density testing starting at age 35. Others, like Maryland, require
that testing requested by a healthcare provider be covered.
Three other states — Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee — have laws
that require plans to offer coverage for osteoporosis-related test-
ing and treatment. It may cost you extra to add it to your insurance
plan, however. Thirty-three states have laws relating to osteoporo-
sis; some sponsor osteoporosis-awareness programs, while others
provide funding for testing for low income and uninsured women.
For a thorough rundown of state-by-state coverage and programs
relating to osteoporosis, check out www.ncsl.org. You can also
check out the appendix in this book for a state-by-state list of pro-
grams. To look at Medicare coverage, go to http://medicare.
gov/coverage/home/asp. 
If you’re unemployed and below a certain income, you can apply
for medical assistance from your state. Each state has different
requirements. A financial counselor at a hospital or social worker
has the skills and knowledge to assist with this problem. Don’t
avoid seeking care because of the lack of insurance, because the
system may have a way to help you. 
Eeny meeny miney moe — 
did I choose an HMO?
Insurance companies just love acronyms and abbreviations. Have
you ever called to find one to find about coverage and had to
answer the question “Is your plan a PPO, POS, or an HMO?” This
question leaves you scrambling to find a magnifying glass to read
the small print on the back of the card, because you have no idea
what you are or what those initials mean.
First, a few definitions:
 HMO stands for health maintenance organization. Many
people with osteoporosis have a health plan that is an HMO.
Generally, if you have an HMO, referrals are required for
seeing specialists, obtaining X-rays, and for physical therapy.
Chapter 8: Finding (and Paying For) a Doctor to Treat Osteoporosis 129

 PPO stands for Preferred Provider Organization. In a PPO, you
aren’t required to get referrals, but you must see a physician
who is in your network.
 POS stands for Point of Service. POS is the least restrictive,
but in some cases, you might still need to see network
providers.
Regardless of the type of health insurance, your plan may decide
that certain treatment is medically unnecessary and consequently
may deny coverage of certain treatment.
The best way to avoid this kind of aggravation is to know your 
coverage ahead of time. First, know what services are covered.
Second, understand your specific plan’s rules. For example, are
referrals necessary? If you use an HMO, find out if you need a refer-
ral for laboratory testing and X-rays. 
Most health plans have an (usually large) section called “exclu-
sions and limitations.” This section tells you what your insurance
won’t pay for. Find out the services that your plan doesn’t cover.
Physical therapy sections are especially important if you have
osteoporosis.
Know which hospitals are covered in your health plan in case you
require admission to a hospital, or even an emergency visit. If you
go to a hospital not covered in your plan, you may spend weeks on
the phone arguing to get your visit paid for.
What if you have a disagreement with your insurance company?
For example, you’ve read your manual from cover to cover and
believe that a certain service is covered, but the payment is
denied. You can appeal! The Kaiser Family Foundation has pub-
lished a 73-page document that is available online at www.kff.
org/insurance/index.cfm, which details exactly how to appeal.
The site also includes a worksheet so that you can begin to under-
stand your coverage.
If you need to file an appeal, follow these steps:
1. Contact the plan’s customer relations department.
Be sure to take notes regarding every phone call, including
whom you spoke with, the date, and time. 
2. If it still isn’t resolved, make a formal appeal in writing to
your plan.
Send the letter certified mail and keep a copy for your
records.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
130

3. If you still don’t get a resolution, you can proceed with
another level of appeal called an external appeal.
Because state governments handle most laws related to
health insurance companies, the process of external
reviews varies.
Going out of network
If your plan uses capitation, you may be restricted in terms of where
you go for laboratory testing, radiographs, and physical therapy. In
other words, if you want your insurance to pay, you need to stay
“in network” and use the lab the insurance sends you to.
However, your primary care doctor can often give you an “out of
network” referral if she feels it’s important for you to see a specific
doctor not in your network. Some insurance plans have a higher
co-pay, an amount you pay upfront at the time of the visit, if you go
out of network.
Getting your drugs covered
Until recently, Medicare didn’t provide any prescription coverage.
In 2003, the Medicare Modernization Act was enacted. It provides
some level of coverage for medications related to bone health.
Some plans, for reasons of their own making, cover one brand
name of drug and not another, so make sure your doctor orders
the one that’s covered, unless she has a specific reason for using a
certain brand. Most prescription plans don’t cover multivitamins
or calcium supplements.

Testing Your Bones 
In This Chapter
 Understanding how bone density testing works
 Determining who needs bone density testing
 Testing your bones in other ways
 Interpreting your test results
 Figuring out how often to get tested
You may have heard people talk about bone density tests with-
out really having any idea what they are. But you think maybe
you need one, because everyone else in your book club has, and
you want to know what you’re talking about when you make your
appointment.
Obviously, the test has something to do with your bones, the den-
sity of your bones, and minerals. You may have no idea whether
it’s a blood test, an X-ray, or an exercise test.
Cheer up. In this chapter, we thoroughly educate you on the ins
and outs of bone density testing, which is sometimes called bone
densitometry, a word only your doctor will be able to correctly 
pronounce.
After you read this chapter, you’ll be able to discuss your DXA
(pronounced dexa) and a whole alphabet of initials with the best of
them. Bone density measurements also go by several other terms,
including DeXA, DXA (DXA is the preferred abbreviation, but either
abbreviation is used), bone mineral density testing, and bone den-
sitometry. If your doctor uses one of these terms, just know she
wants you to get your bone density measured.

What’s Bone Density 
Testing, Anyway?
Bone density testing, or bone densitometry is a radiological way to
measure your bone density. Bone density measures the strength of
your bones and helps predict the chance that you’ll sustain a bone
fracture due to osteoporosis. The lower your bone density, the
more likely you are to fracture a bone even after a slight injury.
Bone density can be measured by several different tests, which we
review in the next section. A bone density test can tell you how
your bone mass and strength stack up against others in your age
group. The overall accuracy of bone mineral density tests is 85 to
99 percent.
Are you wondering why these specialized tests are even necessary?
Why not just get an X-ray and be on your merry way? Standard X-
rays aren’t a good way to measure bone density because your doctor
can’t see or detect any bone loss on the X-ray until you’ve lost at
least 30 percent of your bone mass. Clearly you and your doctor
need to know about bone loss long before you lose that much.
Deciding When to Have a 
Bone Density Test
The International Society of Densitometry has made certain recom-
mendations for bone density testing (your co-author Dr. O’Connor
endorses these recommendations). The following people need a
bone density test:
 All women aged 65 and older
 Postmenopausal women under age 65 with risk factors 
such as 
• Smoking
• Weight less than 126 pounds
• Family history of osteoporosis
 All men aged 70 and older
 Any adults with a history of a fragility fracture (including hip,
wrist, and spinal fracture with minimal trauma)
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
134

 Adults with a disease or condition associated with low bone
mass or bone loss (see Chapter 3)
 Adults taking medications associated with low bone mass or
bone loss (see Chapter 3)
 Anyone being considered for treatment
 Anyone being treated with drugs for osteoporosis to monitor
treatment effect
 Anyone not receiving therapy where evidence of bone loss
would lead to treatment, such as a patient with previously
diagnosed osteopenia now stopping estrogen treatment
 All patients with evidence of reduced bone density on regular
skeletal X-rays
The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) also has recommen-
dations about when to have a bone density test:
 All women age 65 and older
 Postmenopausal women under age 65 with
• Family history of osteoporosis
• Personal history of low-trauma fracture after age 45
• Current cigarette smoker
• Low body weight (less than 127 pounds)
 Other clinical indications include
• Low-trauma fractures as an adult
• Hyperthyroidism
• Hyperparathyroidism
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Vitamin D deficiency
• Diseases that cause poor intestinal absorption such as
sprue (see Chapter 3 for a list)
 Use of medications that cause bone loss include
• Excessive doses of corticosteroids
• Medications that block sex hormone production
• Medications used to treat seizures
• Thyroid hormone medications
Chapter 9: Testing Your Bones 135

Medicare covers your bone density test every two years if you’re
postmenopausal. (Medicare also covers other diagnoses.) (Check
out Chapter 8, which discusses Medicare and private insurance
coverage.) You can’t have a bone density test unless your physi-
cian orders the test with a diagnosis listed on your prescription.
DXA, SXA, PDXA, and More —
Understanding This Alphabet Soup
Although you may assume that a bone density test is a bone density
test is a bone density test, and who cares what kind you have, how-
ever, it really does pay to know what the different tests accomplish.
Deciphering DXA
When people talk about having a bone density test, the Dual Energy
X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is usually the test they’re having. The
DXA scan, often considered the gold standard for bone mineral
density tests, is the most widely available test and the one most
insurance companies cover.
A DXA scan (see Figure 9-1) typically measures the density of your
lower spine and your left hip. Many DXA scanners can also meas-
ure the strength of your wrist bone. Taking your wrist’s measure-
ment is especially important if your doctor or the technician can’t
measure the density of your spine or hip. Most doctors prefer to
have at least two different sites studied.
Figure 9-1: A woman getting a DXA.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
136

A DXA scan is quite accurate, absolutely painless, and requires no
advance preparation. You don’t have to fast, receive any injections
or sedation, take any kind of medication, or even memorize your
multiplication tables before the test. The only preparation is not to
take calcium tablets the day before and the day of the procedure.
You want to avoid the calcium supplements because they can arti-
ficially increase the bone density in your spine if they’re still in
your intestine.
You can keep your clothes on during the examination, as long you
don’t wear anything with metal buttons or zippers. You may be
asked to remove metal jewelry. (The metal can increase bone den-
sity dramatically, which can skew the results.)
You lie on an exam table for a DXA scan, and the test takes only a
short time to complete, less than 15 minutes or so. A DXA scan
does subject you to a dose of radiation, but the amount is small —
less than what you’d receive during a chest X-ray (about 1⁄30th of the
dose). The scan directs X-rays from two different sources (hence
the name “Dual Energy”) at your bone in an alternating pattern.
There is almost no scatter of radiation either, so the room doesn’t
require shielding. You may find DXA machines in your doctor’s
office, which is the most commonly performed type of test.
Settling for SXA
The SXA test (which stands for Single Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry)
measures the bone density in the forearm or heel. The SXA has
several main disadvantages compared to the DXA scan including:
 The part being tested has to be submersed in water.
 The test also measures only bone sites that are far from the
spine and hip. Bone density readings in the heel may not 
correlate with bone density readings in your back.
 The SXA test may not be as accurate.
 It takes longer to complete.
Meanwhile, the advantages of the test include the following:
 The equipment is portable.
 The cost is low.
Chapter 9: Testing Your Bones 137

Pondering PDXA
Peripheral Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (PDXA) measures
only peripheral sites, such as the wrist, heel, or finger, and it takes
less time to complete than the SXA. The equipment, like the SXA, is
portable, but the cost is higher than the SXA.
The PDXA delivers a very low radiation dose, and like the DXA, it
has high resolution and a high degree of accuracy.
Looking at the RA
Radiographic Absorptiometry (RA), otherwise known as photoden-
sitometry, has the advantage of using standard X-ray equipment,
but it requires specialized equipment that scans film at high reso-
lution. Then your doctor uses specialized software to calculate
bone volume, bone density, and cortical thickness. It also delivers
a minimal dose of radiation.
On the downside, it measures the strength of bone in only your fin-
gers, and doctors and researchers have yet to determine the corre-
lation of this reading with density elsewhere in the body.
Questioning pQCT
Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) is a very
accurate test done by using a traditional CAT scanner with special-
ized software. This test, which is primarily utilized in research, is
very accurate but expensive, and it results in a higher exposure to
radiation. It also takes longer to obtain the scan.
The pQCT is the only test that can measure cortical bone (the outer
shell) and trabecular bone (the inner honeycomb layer) in the fore-
arm. (See Chapter 2 for the lowdown on bones.)
Testing Bones in Other Ways
The tests previously mentioned in this chapter all use radiation,
although in low amounts, to measure bone mineral density. Three
other tests are available that can look at your bones without radia-
tion: ultrasound and blood and urine tests.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
138

Ultrasound tests
Taking an ultrasound of your heel is the second most common way
of evaluating for osteoporosis, after the DXA scan. It’s simple and
inexpensive, but it probably isn’t as accurate as the DXA scan.
Blood and urine tests
Researchers and doctors are developing new blood and urine tests
that attempt to measure the rate of bone turnover. In other words,
exactly what is the balance of bone formation and bone resorption
(breakdown) in you?
Doctors refer to these tests as “biochemical markers of bone
turnover.” These markers are more useful for monitoring the treat-
ment and progress of osteoporosis and not for measuring bone mass.
Interpreting the Results 
of Your DXA
Bone density scans can be a confusing jumble of T-scores and 
Z-scores, and plus and minus signs, unless someone explains 
Chapter 9: Testing Your Bones 139
Bone turnover (no cherry 
or blueberry) markers
Recent exciting research has shown that high levels of resorption markers in your
blood or urine may predict the development of hip fracture. (See Chapter 2.) At this
point in time, these biochemical markers are measured under very special circum-
stances or in complex cases.
Just in case you really want to know what resorption and formation markers are,
here are the official technical descriptions:
 Resorption markers: As bone is resorbed, collagen is broken down into frag-
ments. The resorption markers measure these breakdown products. You may
have heard of the names of these tests; examples are N teleopeptide (NTX) and
C teleopeptide (CTX).
 Formation markers: These markers measure certain proteins that are made and
released into the blood during the process of bone formation. The names of
these markers are osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP).

how to interpret them. (Today is your lucky day. We’re here to 
help you!)
Knowing your T-score
Your T-score compares your bone mineral density, with the young
normal average bone mineral density and expresses the difference
as a standard deviation score. If you’re shaking your head, rest
assured that we explain these scores more in-depth in this section.
You figure your T-score with the following formula: 
T-score = (Patient’s bone mineral density – Young Normal
Mean) divided by
Standard Deviation of Young Normal Mean
To explain in simpler words, your T-score is your bone mineral
density compared to the average (mean) score of young adults
(ages 25 to 35). These young adults have your same gender and
ethnicity. The difference between the two is called a “standard
deviation” abbreviated SD.
The SD is your T-score, which can be either a plus or minus
number. If your T-score is zero, then your bone density is exactly
the same as the average value of women (or men) of the popula-
tion of young women of your race.
If your T-score is greater than zero, for example, +1, then your bone
density is 1 standard deviation greater than the average young
population. In contrast, a T-score less than 0, for example, –1,
means that your bone density is less than the average of younger
women. The lower the T-score, the lower your bone density com-
pared to younger women.
Another way of looking at bone density is to look at the actual
value of the measurement in grams per area or grams per centime-
ters squared. This number is an actual measurement of density
and your doctor can monitor it.
Your risk of fracture is related to your T-score. Based upon your 
T-score, your doctor can use special tables to predict your risk of
future fracture at each site and your age. To explain it another way,
your risk of fracture doubles every time your T-score drops by 1.0.
Your doctor can also use your T-score to predict the chance you
might have a fracture over the next ten years.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
140

Your doctor uses the T-score and an assessment of your other risk
factors for osteoporosis (see Chapter 3 for the different risk fac-
tors) and then decides if you need treatment for prevention of fur-
ther bone loss. Your T-scores may differ at different sites of your
body because bone may lose its strength at different rates.
To make T-scores a little easier to understand, Table 9-1 explains
the break points between normal bone, osteopenia, and osteoporo-
sis, based on definitions from the World Health Organization (WHO).
Table 9-1
WHO Definitions of Osteoporosis 
Based on Bone Density T-scores
Bone Mineral density
T-score
Normal
1 standard deviation (SD) or less below the 
young adult reference range (–1)
Low bone mass 
1 to 2.5 SDs below the young adult reference 
(osteopenia)
range (–1 to –2.5)
Osteoporosis
2.5 or more SDs below the young adult refer-
ence range (–2.5 or less)
Severe osteoporosis
2.5 or more SDs below the young adult refer-
ence range (–2.5 or less) and the presence of 
one or more bone fractures
A T-score doesn’t tell your doctor about the cause of your low
bone density. You may have osteomalacia (see Chapter 1), which is
another important cause of low bone strength and isn’t technically
the same condition as osteoporosis. If you have a very low T-score,
then in all likelihood your primary care doctor will refer you to a
specialist who can try to determine the reason why your bone
strength is so much lower than the average.
What if your T-score is in the normal range, yet you suffer a fragility
fracture (see Chapter 7 for more about fragility fractures)? If this
happens, you need to see a bone specialist.
Catching the Z’s
Now, you may think comparing your bone density with that of a 
25-to-35-year-old is unfair, especially if you’re on the far side of 50.
Someone must have agreed with you on that point, because another
score, called the Z-score, compares your results to other people
your same age, gender, height, and weight.
Chapter 9: Testing Your Bones 141

A negative number in the Z-score isn’t good, because it means your
bones are thinner than those of your contemporaries who have
similar height, weight, age, and gender. A positive number means
you have less chance of fracture than others in your demographi-
cally similar group.
Z-scores are more useful in measuring bone density in children,
because you want to compare bone density to other children of
the same age.
Interpreting all these numbers
Although you may think it’s unfair, your doctor will use the lowest,
or worst score you got as your bone mineral density score, which
means that if your hips aren’t bad but your spine is, the spine
number is the one she’s going to use.
Your doctor will also need to look at your overall health as part of
your evaluation, because some diseases can result in a lower than
normal bone mineral density, even if you don’t have osteoporosis.
Some of the diseases that can lower your bone mineral density are
 Ankylosing spondylitis
 Cushing disease
 Hyperparathyroidism
 Hyperthyroidism
 Multiple myeloma
 Premature menopause
 Rheumatoid arthritis
 Rickets
 Vitamin D deficiency
See Chapter 3 for more information about these specific diseases
and how they affect your bone density.

Knowing How Often You Need 
a Bone Density Test
One bone density test in your lifetime isn’t always enough. In fact,
your doctor may ask you to have tests done every year or so if you
fall into certain categories, as we outline in this section.
For example, your doctor may prescribe serial bone mineral test-
ing to monitor your response to treatment, or to monitor you if
you’re at risk for rapid bone loss, such as if you take high doses of
corticosteroids.
The International Society of Bone Densitometry recommends: 
“Repeating bone density typically one year after initiation 
or change of therapy with longer intervals once therapeutic
effect is established. In conditions associated with rapid bone
loss, such as glucocorticoid therapy, more often might be
appropriate.”
However, the changes in bone density after one year on treatment
are very slight, perhaps beyond the detection of bone density read-
ings. If you experienced a dramatic decline in bone density after
one year (for example, greater than 5 percent), your doctor per-
haps may change the therapy. However, not many people have
such a decline. People on high doses of corticosteroids may be in
this category.
Repeating your DXA scan every two years is an approach that
many experts in the field take. Your doctor will compare bone min-
eral densities from year to year. Make sure you or you doctor don’t
compare T-scores. 
Also, bone mineral densities from different manufacturers aren’t
readily comparable. Therefore if you return to the same radiologi-
cal unit year after year for your DXA scan, make sure the equip-
ment has the same manufacturer.

S
ome days you may feel a bit like Alice in Wonderland, taking
“one pill that makes you taller, one that makes you small, and
even one that doesn’t do anything at all.” It’s nice to think that any
ill can be cured with the right drug, and certainly some nearly
miraculous new osteoporosis drugs are available on the market.
However, when choosing medication, “one size fits all” is a mis-
nomer. In this chapter, we look at the different medications avail-
able for osteoporosis, who they’re likely to benefit, and how to
determine what’s right for you. We also include a useful table that
gives you a quick once-over about the available drugs by generic
and brand names.
Sorting Out the Different Types 
of Drug Treatment
Maybe you’re sitting around one day at the book club, getting a
little off topic discussing the medicines your doctor has you on for
osteoporosis. “Oh, my doctor said Fosamax is the best,” says one

friend, while another shakes her head. “Oh, no, my doctor said I
have to take Evista.” Meanwhile you’re thinking that your doctor
wants you to take injections; why can’t you just take pills like your
friends?
If you’ve ever wondered why your doctor has chosen a certain
medication for you to treat your osteoporosis, take heart. We’re
here to help you sort out the different categories of drugs to treat
osteoporosis and to explain why your doctor may choose one over
the other. Osteoporosis is a problem with various causes, and the
treatment from individual to individual varies depending upon the
cause of the problem.
To help you, we first list the common categories of drugs and the
brand names they’re known by (see Table 10-1).

Looking at Bisphosphonates 
for Building Up Bone
Bones are like a bank; your bone “balance” stays healthy as long as
you’re not taking out more than you put in. That analogy may be a
little simplistic (see Chapter 2 for the more involved detail of bone
buildup and breakdown) but in essence, bone strength depends
upon the balance between the bone cells that build bone versus
those cells that break down bone.
Researchers have used the “bone strength equals bone buildup
minus bone loss” formula to develop drugs that prevent and treat
bone loss. Drugs that slow down bone breakdown are referred to
as antiresorptive drugs. The wonderful part of antiresorptive drugs
is that not only do they build bone density, but they also actually
reduce the frequency of bone fracture.
Bisphosphonates are a type of antiresorptive drug that inhibits
bone removal by the osteoclasts (see Chapter 2 for more on osteo-
clasts). Taking bisphosphonates can increase bone density in both
the hip (by 3 percent) and lumbar spine (by 5 percent). Changes in
bone density can be seen in the first year of treatment. Fracture
rates are reduced by 50 percent.
Using alendronate, ibandronate, 
and risedronate
The most commonly used antiresorptive drugs belong to a class 
of compounds referred to as bisphosphonates, also called diphos-
phonates. Three oral bisphosphonates are approved in the United
States for both prevention and treatment of osteoporosis:
Chapter 10: Taking Prescription Drugs for Osteoporosis 147

 Alendronate (Fosamax)
 Ibandronate (Boniva) (the newest drug, it may be difficult 
to find)
 Risedronate (Actonel)
All bisphosphonates bind to osteoclasts (cells that break down bone)
and slow their ability to resorb bone. The drugs differ somewhat in
their chemical makeup, but all are antiresorptive drugs, with alen-
dronate being the first developed.
You may find that you tolerate one drug better than the other. For
example, alendronate may cause you more difficulty with stomach
irritation, and risedronate may not. Ibandronate may be your
choice because it only needs to be taken once a month. All the bis-
phosphonates vary in their side effects and their dosing regimens.
People also respond to different drugs differently, so if you start
with one and have side effects, don’t hesitate to tell your doctor!
You may hear alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate called
“diphosphonates” instead of “bisphosphonates.” A diphosphonate
is the same thing as a bisphosphonate; just chalk it up to the idio-
syncrasies of the scientific world to have two words (long ones, at
that) for the same thing. The prefix bis- and di- both refer to the
word “two.” These drugs contain two phosphonate groups attached
to one carbon atom. This particular structure is responsible for the
strong binding of the drug to osteoclasts.
Deciding when to treat 
with bisphosphonates
When is it time to start bisphosphonates? When everyone else in
your bridge group is on them? When your children keep hounding
you about taking something for your bones? No.
Your doctor makes the final determination of when to start medica-
tions for osteoporosis, but she usually follows these guidelines for
starting treatment:
 T-score is less than 2.5. (A T-score is the number of standard
deviations the bone mineral density measurement is above or
below the young normal mean bone mineral density. In other
words, your T-score is your score compared to that of young
adults. See Chapter 9 for the complete lowdown on T-scores.)
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
148

 T-score is less than 2.0 with multiple risk factors, such as 
corticosteroid use and low body mass index (BMI). (See
Chapter 3 for more on risk factors.)
 T-score is less than 1.5 and you’re taking drugs that cause
rapid bone loss, such as corticosteroids and phenobarbitol.
(See Chapter 3 for drugs that cause bone loss.)
 Menopausal status is a factor because rapid bone loss can
occur in menopause due to a decrease in estrogen. (See
Chapter 3 for more information about menopause’s effects 
on osteoporosis.)
Who shouldn’t take 
bisphosphonates?
Not everyone is a good candidate for taking bisphosphonates. Your
doctor may decide not to give you bisphosphonates if you have
any of the following conditions:
 Esophageal strictures
 Kidney disease
 Severe gastroesophageal reflux
 Vitamin D deficiency
Some people develop side effects that are intolerable, such as
stomach irritation, or muscle and joint pain. Sometimes switching
from one bisphosphonate to another may help. Among the newer
bisphosphonatelike drugs, there is no clear advantage of one med-
ication versus another in preventing fractures.
Taking bisphosphonates with adequate amounts of calcium and
vitamin D is critical. You need 1,500 mg of calcium daily and 400 
to 800 International Units (IU) of vitamin D daily. Check with your
doctor to find out the right amount for you.
Remember that over-the-counter medications, including herbs and
homeopathic remedies, are still drugs. Inform your doctor of all
medications you take so she can monitor them.
Taking bisphosphonates correctly
Some bisphosphonates can be given in either daily or weekly
doses as a preventive. For risedronate (Actonel), the dose is 5 mg
daily or 35 mg once a week. Doctors often prescribe alendronate
Chapter 10: Taking Prescription Drugs for Osteoporosis 149

(Fosamax) in a higher dose (10 mg daily or 70 mg once a week).
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ibandronate
(Boniva) in 2005 to be taken once a month.
All bisphosphonates need to be taken first thing in the morning
with eight ounces of water. Don’t eat or drink anything else for 30
minutes after taking your medication. You need to remain upright
for about 30 minutes — no sneaking back to bed for a quick nap —
to help decrease stomach irritation after taking your medication.
These drugs are absorbed slowly from the gastrointestinal tract.
They can cause an irritation of the esophagus (a chemical esophagi-
tis). You must use them with caution if you have any problems with
your esophagus. Taking them with water is important because water
doesn’t compete with the drugs’ absorption in the stomach; juice
or other foods interfere with absorption.
The Estrogen Replacement
Controversy
Bisphosphonates, or antiresorptive drugs, only act on bone tissue;
they don’t have an effect elsewhere in your body. Estrogen and
other sex hormones, such as testosterone, on the other hand, have
many effects on your body rather than acting just on bone.
Estrogen prevents and treats osteoporosis by slowing down bone
resorption. Estrogen also alleviates the symptoms of menopause,
which can be terribly disabling. These symptoms include insom-
nia, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness. Before the development of
alendronate (Fosamax), estrogens were the most commonly used
drugs used for treatment of osteoporosis. Your doctor may recom-
mend estrogen therapy if you can’t tolerate the side effects of bis-
phosphonates or if she thinks you’ll benefit in other ways, such as
relief from postmenopausal symptoms, from estrogen replacement.
The FDA first approved estrogen replacement therapy for treat-
ment of osteoporosis in 1972. However, researchers found that
estrogen taken without progesterone resulted in an increased risk
of uterine cancer, because the uterine lining was continually built
up by the estrogen and not “shed in a monthly bleed.” When estro-
gen was combined with progesterone, the uterine lining was shed
in a monthly bleed due to withdrawal for a few days from proges-
terone, and there was no increased risk of uterine cancer.
Unfortunately, new information has shown that five years of treat-
ment with both estrogen and progesterone slightly increases the
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
150

risk of breast cancer, while treatment with estrogen alone may not.
Recent studies have also shown that estrogen-progesterone hor-
mone replacement therapy may increase the risk of heart disease
and stroke. Researchers previously thought that hormone replace-
ment therapy was a protection against these diseases.
Because of all the uncertainty about the risk of breast cancer and
heart disease with estrogens, many bone specialists use antiresorp-
tive drugs as their first line of treatment for osteoporosis. However,
despite the increased risks of breast and uterine cancers, estrogen,
in combination with progesterone, and estrogen alone clearly have
been shown to reduce fracture rates by about one-third. If your
doctor decides that estrogens are right for you, she’ll discuss the
pros and cons with you and give you the lowest dose available.
The ideal patient for estrogen therapy in osteoporosis is someone
who is in early menopause and who is having hot flashes and who
has had a hysterectomy so that there is no risk of uterine cancer.
In this circumstance, estrogen alone in low doses can be used.
Taking estrogen correctly
If your doctor prescribes estrogen, it’s available in pills or skin
patches. The lowest dose available is 0.3 mg, while the standard
dose is 0.625 mg. Estrogen can also be combined with proges-
terone in hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Some brand names
of combination type HRT are Activella, FemHRT, and Prempro.
Estrogen alone or in combination drugs is often taken once a day
for most of the month, and then stopped for a few days to allow a
withdrawal bleed. Shedding the menstrual lining each month
decreases your chance of developing uterine cancer. Your doctor
may prescribe a different regimen for taking the drug, so be sure to
follow her instructions, because she knows you best.
Chapter 10: Taking Prescription Drugs for Osteoporosis 151
Estrogen therapy – Where 
did I put those car keys?
In 2004, the results of the women’s Health Initiative Memory study, sponsored by
the National Institute of Health (NIH) showed that women taking estrogens might
have an increased risk of memory problems. These results seem contrary to what
would be expected and haven’t been confirmed by other studies.

Whether to use pills or patches is a matter of choice. If you’re wor-
ried about forgetting a daily pill, patches, which are changed every
few days, may be best. Pills may also cause nausea in some people.
Pills also need to pass through the liver before being absorbed,
whereas patches are directly absorbed into the bloodstream. On
the other hand, some people develop skin irritation from the
patches and do better with pills.
Pills
Some common brands of estrogen-only pills are
 Cenestin
 Estrace
 Estratab
 Estinyl
 Menest
 Ogen
When taking estrogen pills, you need to remember the following
points:
 Take your pill at the same time each day.
 If you miss a pill, don’t double the dose the next day.
Combination pills
Your doctor may prescribe combination hormone therapy, which
means your pills contain both estrogen and progesterone. This
combination means you’ll have a withdrawal bleed, similar to a
menstrual period, each month. This withdrawal bleed helps pro-
tect you from developing uterine cancer. Of course, if you’ve had
your uterus removed (a hysterectomy), there’s no reason to take a
combination pill.
Combination pills are usually taken for 21 days, and then stopped
for one week, during which you’ll have a withdrawal bleed.
Some common brand names of combination pills are
 Estratest
 FemHRT
 Prempro

If you’re taking a combination pill, you need to remember the 
following points:
 Take your pill at the same time every day.
 Don’t double up the next day if you miss a pill.
 Be aware (and prepared) that you’ll have monthly bleed.
Patches
Some common brand names of estrogen patches are
 Alora
 Climara
 Estraderm
 Vivelle
 Vivelle-dot
If you’re using estrogen patches, you need to remember the follow-
ing points:
 Replace your estrogen patches once or twice a week, depend-
ing on the brand.
 You can shower or swim with the patch on.
 Rotate the site for your patch every time you change it to
avoid skin irritation.
 Most patches need to be placed only on your abdomen or 
buttocks; don’t put them on your breasts or your waist. Don’t
forget to peel off the backing or they won’t stick!
Living with side effects of estrogen
Estrogen can cause some irritating side effects. If you’re taking hor-
mone replacement therapy with progesterone, you’ll probably have
withdrawal bleeding, like a period. This bleeding can be annoying if
you thought you were done buying maxi pads ten years ago!
Other side effects of estrogen can include
 Bloating
 Breast tenderness
 Change in sex drive (good or bad!)
 Headaches
Chapter 10: Taking Prescription Drugs for Osteoporosis 153

 Nausea
 Weight gain
Let your doctor know immediately if you experience
 Abnormal vaginal bleeding
 Breast lumps
 Chest pain or shortness of breath
 Coughing up blood
 Difficulty with your speech
 Pain in your legs, especially your calves
 Severe headache or dizziness
 Weakness or numbness in your arm or leg
 Yellowing of your skin or eyes
Don’t take estrogen if you have had blood clots in your veins. 
(The technical term is thromboembolic disease.)
Trying “designer estrogens” (Evista)
Researchers have developed a new class of drugs, called designer
estrogens that bind only to certain estrogen receptors. (No, these
designer estrogens didn’t make their debut on a runway.) As a
result, these designer estrogens have an effect on bone, but not 
on the uterus or breast.
One of these medications is known as raloxifene (Evista) and is
FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal
osteoporosis. Some evidence has even suggested that raloxifene
might lower the risk of breast cancer.
The side effects of raloxifene often limit its use and include the re-
currence of hot flashes. You also may have an increased risk of blood
clots in the veins, similar to the use of other types of estrogens.
The reason why raloxifene isn’t usually considered as the first drug
of choice for osteoporosis is that studies haven’t shown that the
drug protects against fractures, particularly hip fractures, as well
as the bisphosphonates.
If you’re taking raloxifene, notify your doctor immediately if you
notice pain or swelling in your legs, sudden shortness of breath,
coughing up blood, or changes in your vision.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
154

On the bright side, raloxifene is also helpful in lowering total and
low-density (the “bad” cholesterol) cholesterol levels. Researchers
are also testing it to see if it has any effects on heart disease.
Don’t take raloxifene if you’re
 Pregnant or may become pregnant
 Have a history of blood clots
 Have limited mobility (are in a wheelchair, or in a cast)
 Have liver disease
See the “The Estrogen Replacement Controversy” section earlier in
this chapter for more information about taking estrogens.
Calcitonin: An Old 
Medication Standby
Another drug that inhibits resorption (slowing bone loss) is calci-
tonin, which was one of the first drugs available to treat osteoporo-
sis. Calcitonin is related to a naturally occurring hormone secreted
by a part of the thyroid gland.
One of the advantages of calcitonin is that it can sometimes allevi-
ate the pain from a skeletal fracture, so physicians often prescribe
it to patients who have just experienced a spinal fracture due to
osteoporosis. The other major benefit is that it has few side effects.
Calcitonin is useful for individuals who can’t take bisphosphonates,
estrogens, or designer estrogens; unfortunately it’s less effective.
Calcitonin is a protein, which means you can’t take it in pill form,
because your body would digest it before it did you any good. As a
result, calcitonin is available in two other forms:
 Injection: Available in 50 to 100 IU daily doses
 Nasal spray: The most commonly used, you take one daily
dose (200 IU)
Injected calcitonin can rarely cause some annoying side effects,
such as flushing of your hands and face, nausea, rash, or urinary
frequency. The nasal spray form can cause backache, bloody nose
or other nasal irritation, and headaches.
Chapter 10: Taking Prescription Drugs for Osteoporosis 155

Building Bone with Teripeptides
The newest drug on the horizon is the only drug that works by
actually stimulating new bone formation. This new molecule is
known as teripeptide, or human recombinant (meaning that it’s
manmade in a laboratory) parathyroid hormone (PTH). Bone den-
sity in both the spine and hip increase significantly after only 21
months on this medication with the accompanying reduction in
fracture rates.
Doctors and researchers have little long-term experience with this
hormone, and consequently they don’t know of any unusual side
effects if the hormone is used for longer periods of time.
The drug does have three major disadvantages:
 It requires one daily injection under the skin.
 It’s very expensive.
 Very few insurance companies cover it at this time.
Children or anyone with an elevated calcium level can’t take it.
Side effects of PTH include dizziness, nausea, and leg cramps.
When to consider prevention
Given the profound effects of corticosteroids, such as prednisone
and other prednisonelike drugs, on bone metabolism, you need to
take calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent osteoporosis
even if you take prednisone only for a short time. If you take pred-
nisone for a longer period of time, your doctor may order a bone
density test ahead of time, assess your risk factors for osteoporo-
sis, and then give you a bisphosphonate as preventive treatment.
Your doctor will adjust the dose of prednisone based upon your
risk factors, such as estrogen status, the dose of corticosteroids
used, and your baseline bone mineral density as measured by DXA
scanning. (See Chapter 9 for more on how DXA scans measure your
bone density.)
If you’re going to receive an organ transplant, such as liver, kidney,
or heart, you’re at increased risk for rapid bone loss and your physi-
cian may consider preventive therapy in that circumstance as well.

156

Deciding on testosterone 
replacement therapy
Testosterone deficiency is a common cause of osteoporosis in
men. Low testosterone levels have many causes (see Chapter 4 for
more details), but the lower levels are most commonly seen in men
who use corticosteroids or those who are undergoing treatment
for prostate cancer. So if you’re a male with osteoporosis, your
doctor might consider testosterone replacement to improve your
bone density and prevent fractures.
Testosterone comes in several different forms:
 Oral: Oral preparations are difficult, because they cause more
liver problems and one needs frequent, high doses.
 Intramuscular injections: Injections are inconvenient, but
they’re less damaging to the liver.
 Transdermal patches: Patches also avoid liver toxicity, but
they can cause rashes from allergic reactions.
 Gel: A new gel applied to the skin called Androgel might be
the easiest and safest to use.
Side effects of testosterone include enlargement of the prostate
gland, abnormal liver function tests, and abnormal lipid levels. If
you’re on testosterone replacement, make sure you receive a
prostate exam and regular blood tests.
When considering using testosterone, remember these four impor-
tant points:
 The first line treatment of osteoporosis in men is still a 
bisphosphonate.
 Testosterone isn’t indicated for treatment of osteoporosis in
men who have normal testosterone blood levels.
Don’t take testosterone to increase athletic performance.
 If you have the following conditions, don’t take testosterone
replacement:
• Breast cancer (men can get breast cancer too)
• Liver disease
Chapter 10: Taking Prescription Drugs for Osteoporosis 157

• Polycythemia (an illness with a very high amount of red
blood cells)
• Prostate cancer
Exploring New Directions 
in Medication
Researchers and pharmaceutical companies are always developing
new medications and figuring out ways to use older medications in
new ways. Drugs for osteoporosis are no exception. This section
includes some of the “newest kids on the block” in medication
options.
Administering bisphosphonates 
in a new manner
Ten years ago, an intravenous form of bisphosphonate, known as
pamidronate, was approved for use in two diseases (Paget’s dis-
ease, an illness of disordered bone formation, and high calcium
levels seen in cancer) . . . but not for osteoporosis.
For osteoporosis, pamidronate (Aredia) is used in a lower dose.
Although not FDA-approved, many rheumatologists (including Dr
O’Connor) are using pamidronate to treat osteoporosis. This med-
ication is most useful when you have reflux esophagitis (when
other bisphosphonate drugs aren’t effective because they cause
irritation to the esophagus) because pamidronate doesn’t cause
esophagitis. Therefore many doctors use it in people who can’t sit
up or who have problems with their esophagus.
Pamidronate is usually given at an infusion center. The dose typi-
cally is 30 mg every three to six months. Side effects are uncom-
mon, but include a drop in calcium level or a flulike reaction
(consisting of fever and muscle aches). These reactions tend to
resolve quickly. It takes about two hours to receive the infusion.
One limitation of the intravenous bisphosphonates is their cost.
Because the FDA hasn’t approved their use in the treatment of osteo-
porosis, some insurance companies don’t cover the medication.
Another form of intravenous bisphosphonate, which was first stud-
ied in 2002 for osteoporosis, is zoledronic acid (Zometa). The drug
has been widely used in individuals with bone cancer.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
158

In one study, 351 postmenopausal women received zoledronic acid
intravenously once a year. Bone density improved and markers of
bone turnover were lowered. In another study, researchers are cur-
rently conducting a long-term study in more than 1,700 individuals
who have experienced a hip fracture. The question being asked 
is whether yearly doses of zoledronic acid can prevent future frac-
tures. Keep your eyes open for more results from this study, known
as the Horizon future fracture trial.
Combining drug therapies
Using more than one drug to treat difficult cases of osteoporosis is
an approach your doctor might try. Although not much evidence
supports this approach, your doctor might consider it because
doctors frequently use a combination of drugs in treatment of other
illnesses, such as high blood pressure or rheumatoid arthritis.
For example, if a man develops osteoporosis on corticosteroid
therapy and has a very low testosterone level, he may be pre-
scribed both testosterone replacement and a bisphosphonate.
The effectiveness of a combination therapy isn’t clear-cut quite
yet. Some evidence in a small population showed that the combi-
nation of alendronate and estrogen works better to prevent osteo-
porosis than taking either drug alone. In contrast to that study, a
study with teriparatide and alendronate showed no additional ben-
efit of the combination when compared to each drug used in isola-
tion. These findings are certainly puzzling and warrant repeated
investigation.
Using ultra low-dose estrogen
A promising study published in 2004 followed 400 women between
the ages of 60 and 80. The women wore an estrogen patch that
delivered a very low dose of estrogen. After a two-year period,
bone mineral density improved in both the hip and spine. The
patients were monitored for endometrial cancer, and none devel-
oped. This evidence is promising, but a larger and longer study is
needed before anything is conclusive.
Strontium
In 2004, a group of European researchers published the effects of 
a medication called strontium renelate on vertebral fractures in
postmenopausal women. This new medication, taken by mouth,
Chapter 10: Taking Prescription Drugs for Osteoporosis 159

stimulates the formation of new bone as well as decreases bone
resorption.
The drug clearly prevented fractures in the spine in a group of
high-risk patients. This medication, which has been approved for
use in the United Kingdom, but not yet in the United States, is taken
once daily and comes in a powder that must be dissolved in water.
Patients take the medication at bedtime on an empty stomach.
Side effects include mild nausea and diarrhea, which occur rarely.
Don’t take this medication if you have a prior history of blood clots.
Tibolone (Livial)
A new type of hormone replacement, called tibolone (Livial), avail-
able in Europe and Australia, is a manufactured compound that
has properties of several hormones.
It acts like progesterone, androgen (a male hormone), and estrogen,
and has been referred to as gonadomimetic (mimics the function of
your ovary). Clearly this medication has the potential to prevent
and treat osteoporosis.
A study of 4,000 women is underway to study the benefits and
potential side effects of this medication; you can read more about
the study and the drug itself at http://hcp.livial.com.
One plus to this medication over traditional hormone replacement
therapies is that no uterine bleeding occurs in the majority of post-
menopausal women taking this drug. If you have a prior history of
breast cancer, avoid this drug.
For men with osteoporosis, researchers are developing new
designer androgens that might have the desired bony effects, but
not the undesirable effects, such as prostate cancer.

pecialty stores that tout the latest in vitamin and mineral sup-
plements are flourishing, popping up in shopping centers and
malls everywhere. These stores are becoming more and more pop-
ular, perhaps due to some surveys that show as many as 53 per-
cent of Americans take a daily vitamin or mineral supplement.
Are you really surprised? Every time you turn on the television or
the radio you’re constantly bombarded with commercials that
encourage you to take certain vitamins, minerals, or other supple-
ments to prevent various diseases and claim that you’ll live forever.
Despite all these miracle claims, you may be wondering what
exactly are the facts regarding these supplements and your bones?
Even though your doctor may not actually write a prescription for
them, you still need to carefully consider them just like any other
medication that you receive by way of a prescription.
In this chapter, we sort through the information available to help
you find a balance between the hype and the facts when taking
over-the-counter (OTC) supplements to help with osteoporosis.

Why Vitamin D Is a Major Player
Vitamin D’s main function is to maintain normal levels of calcium
and phosphorus, both vital to the building of healthy bone, in your
bloodstream. Vitamin D also assists in bone mineralization. You
may hear vitamin D referred to as a hormone as well as a vitamin;
this is because vitamin D needs to be converted to an active hor-
mone form to do its job.
If you don’t take in enough vitamin D, your bones can become soft
and brittle. Children may develop rickets and adults may develop
osteomalacia if they don’t consume enough vitamin D (see Chapter
4 for more on these diseases).
You can find vitamin D in foods, such as fish and eggs (check out
Chapter 5 for more on vitamin D in your diet). Your body also
makes vitamin D after your skin is exposed to sunlight. You need
sun exposure for 10 to 15 minutes at least two to three times a
week to produce the necessary vitamin D. Some people, especially
the elderly or homebound, don’t get out in the sun this much.
Supplementation is most important for these individuals, because
they’re most likely to be at high risk for fracture.
If you live in some areas of the United States where sunlight doesn’t
provide enough ultraviolet-ray exposure to synthesize vitamin D 
in the winter months, you may need to consider taking vitamin D
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
162
Taking enough vitamins . . . or too many?
Although you may take vitamin supplements, do you actually read the contents listed
on the bottle to make sure you’re getting the exact amount you need? You may figure
it’s the drug companies’ business to figure out all the picky little details, and that
you’re doing your part to stay healthy by remembering to take what’s in the bottle
every day.
Unfortunately, vitamin companies work on averages, and what’s right for your neigh-
bor may not be right for you. New studies show that some preparations contain vita-
mins and minerals in amounts that may actually harm you rather than help you, and
that others don’t contain enough to do any real good.
You need to be proactive and find out what’s good — and not good — for you.
Become an educated consumer and buy only what you need, and what may be help-
ful for you.

supplements. Pollution, cloud cover, and use of sunscreen can also
prevent sufficient UV light from reaching the skin to manufacture
vitamin D.
You may wonder if a few sessions at the tanning salon would sub-
stitute for sunlight in providing ultraviolet light. The answer is:
possibly. Tanning salons deliver both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultra-
violet B light (UVB); only UVB synthesizes vitamin D. If you decide
to utilize a tanning salon for UV exposure, make sure that the salon
is providing UVB rays. Also remember that tanning beds may
increase your risk of skin cancer, so talk it over with your doctor
before lying down in the bed!
A study done in 2002 showed that 42 percent of African American
women were deficient in vitamin D, compared to only 4 percent of
Caucasian women. Women of Middle Eastern and Asian descent are
also more likely to be vitamin D deficient, partly because darker
pigmented skin converts UV rays to vitamin D less efficiently than
lighter skin, and partly because women from these cultures may
wear clothing that shields them more from the sun’s rays.
People older than age 50 are also prone to vitamin D deficiency,
because the kidneys are less efficient at converting vitamin D to its
active form, and older skin doesn’t synthesize vitamin D as well. As
a result, your recommended intake of vitamin D becomes higher as
you get older (see Table 11-1). In addition, older people are less
likely to spend time outdoors, especially in colder climates, where
sunlight is already limited. Diseases that interfere with fat absorp-
tion can also result in vitamin D deficiency. People with Crohn’s
disease, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, and liver disease may need
supplementation.

Chapter 11: Keeping Bones Strong with OTC Supplements 163

Most of the popular multivitamin supplements contain 200 to 400
IU of vitamin D. You need to read the labels carefully to know the
amount you’re taking.
Checking your vitamin D levels
Your doctor can measure your vitamin D level by blood tests, but
the normal values reported by the laboratories are probably too low.
Experts now recommend that your blood level of vitamin D needs
to be at least 25 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). In concert with
this amount, in 2005, researchers are also recommending that the
upper limit of vitamin D supplementation be increased from 600 IU
daily to 800 IU daily in order to maintain a blood level of 25 ng/ml.
Furthermore, if you’re taking alendronate (Fosamax) or risedronate
(Actonel) for osteoporosis, then you must have adequate amounts
of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in order for the medica-
tions to work properly.
Finally, vitamin D deficiency with bone findings showing osteoma-
lacia can look exactly like osteoporosis. Monitoring your vitamin D
status if you’re undergoing treatment for osteoporosis or if you’ve
had a fracture is critical. Because most patients with vitamin D
deficiency and fractures don’t have a bone biopsy to look for
osteomalacia, the next best step is to restore vitamin D in the
blood and observe what happens.
Drugs that interfere with 
vitamin D absorption
If you’re taking certain medications, you may need to supplement
vitamin D because the drugs interfere with absorption. Some of the
drugs that can interfere with vitamin absorption are
 Anticonvulsants
 Barbiturates
 Cholesterol-lowering medication
 Cortisone
 Digitoxin
 Some laxatives
If you’re taking medications that fall into any of these categories,
ask your doctor about taking extra vitamin D supplementation.

Correlating vitamin D deficiency 
and hip fractures
Some evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency and hip frac-
tures go hand in hand. In fact, one study showed that 50 percent of
women hospitalized for hip fractures were vitamin D deficient.
Another long-term study by Harvard Medical School showed that
women who supplemented their diet with 500 IU of vitamin D 
daily reduced their rate of hip fracture by 37 percent, compared 
to those women whose daily intake of vitamin D was less than 140
IU. This study also showed that 60 percent of women surveyed 
had intakes of vitamin D that were less than the recommended
daily allowance (RDA).
Reducing falls with vitamin D
In 2005, researchers conducted a review of published literature
regarding falls in people older than 60 who lived in a community
dwelling. The results showed that patients who received various
forms of vitamin D supplementation had fewer falls. The investiga-
tors conducting this research believe that vitamin D may improve
muscle strength, although other factors may also play a part.
Taking in too much vitamin D
You and your doctor may determine that you need to take 
vitamin D supplements. But can you take in too much vitamin D?
Absolutely! Because vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, your body
stores excess amounts in tissue, instead of washing it out in urine,
as water-soluble vitamins are.
Vitamin D toxicity is almost never caused by excessive sunlight
exposure or by dietary intake of vitamin D. The usual cause of vita-
min D toxicity is caused by taking in too much vitamin D in the
form of supplements.
Some of the symptoms of vitamin D toxicity are
 Constipation
 Decreased appetite or weight loss
 Nausea and vomiting
 Weakness
Chapter 11: Keeping Bones Strong with OTC Supplements 165

In addition, too much vitamin D can cause calcium in the blood to
rise too high, causing confusion and other changes in mental status.
High blood levels of calcium can also cause heart arrhythmias and
kidney problems.
Just remember; too much of a good thing, even vitamin D, can be
dangerous!
Overdoing Vitamin A
When you think of vitamin supplementation, you probably think in
terms of getting enough of a vitamin. The thought of getting too
much of a vitamin may not occur to you. However, as is the case
with vitamin D, discussed in the previous section, you can take in
too much of a vitamin or mineral supplement and end up increasing
rather than decreasing your chance of fracture due to osteoporosis.
Vitamin A, which is a fat-soluble vitamin like vitamin D, has come
under study recently as a possible culprit in increasing your risk of
fracture, not because you may be deficient, but because you may
be taking too much vitamin A.
Some studies have shown that supplementing your diet with vita-
min A (the retinol form) 10,000 IU daily can increase your chance
of bone fracture by up to 40 percent.
Your body still needs some vitamin A to maintain healthy skin,
vision, teeth, and hair, among other things. The RDA of vitamin A 
in adults is between 2,500 IU and 3000 IU per day.
Many vitamin supplements contain up to 10,000 IU of vitamin A,
well above the 2,500 RDA. This higher amount may well contribute
to bone mineral loss and an increased risk of fracture.
If you take too much vitamin A, not only do you risk the chance 
of bone fracture, but you also may suffer from vitamin A toxicity.
Blood tests may show high levels of liver enzymes if you have 
vitamin A toxicity, or a higher than normal level of vitamin A.
Measurements of the retinol form of vitamin A are commercially
available, although not widely ordered. The retinol form of 
vitamin A, found in liver, egg yolks, cheese, and milk, is the toxic
type at high levels, whereas the beta-carotene form, which is 
contained in carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, and cantaloupe,
seems to be safe.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
166

Signs of vitamin A toxicity include
 Blurred vision
 Decrease in muscle coordination
 Dizziness
 Headache
 Nausea
 Vomiting
The human body converts beta-carotene, found in many yellow
vegetables, to vitamin A, but ingesting beta-carotene doesn’t seem
to increase risk of fractures, according to several studies. Because
of this fact, many multivitamin preparations now include beta-
carotene as a substitute for some or all the vitamin A in their
preparations. Check your vitamin labels to see if your vitamin A is
at least partially being supplied by beta-carotene; if not, look for
another supplement.
Confronting the Cacophony 
of Calcium Supplements
You may drink milk by the gallon and eat cheese by the pound and
still wonder if you’re getting enough calcium in your diet (see
Chapters 5 and 15 for more on calcium in the diet). The best way
to get calcium is to take in enough through your diet, but not
everyone can do that. For example, for the 25 percent of Americans
who are lactose intolerant, incorporating enough calcium into their
diet isn’t easy (see Chapter 5 for good ideas on getting enough cal-
cium if you’re lactose intolerant). Still, 5 percent or more of
Americans are worried about getting enough calcium that they
take calcium supplements, and many more probably should be
worried about their calcium intake.
Recent studies appear to show that calcium alone isn’t enough to
maintain healthy bones; you also need an adequate amount of 
vitamin D. (Refer to the section, “Why Vitamin D Is a Major Player”
earlier in this chapter for more on the importance of vitamin D in
your diet.)
Chapter 11: Keeping Bones Strong with OTC Supplements 167

If you’re older than 50 years old, you need 1,200 mg of elemental
calcium daily to maintain strong bones. More than half of American
women may not take in enough calcium without taking supplements.
(Check out Chapter 5 for more on getting adequate calcium in 
your diet.)
Calcium can be confusing, because so many types of calcium sup-
plements are available today. Does your basic drugstore multivita-
min contain enough, or do you need to opt for the expensive
varieties available only in your local health food store? Do you
need to take calcium carbonate, citrate, or one of the other “ates”
out there? Is coral calcium all it’s cracked up to be?
Calcium must be combined with another ingredient, such as citrate
or gluconate, to be useful. This is why calcium supplements are
manufactured with gluconate or citrate and are listed as, for exam-
ple, “calcium citrate” rather than just plain calcium.
Reading the labels for 
elemental calcium
Combining calcium with the different “ates” results in varying
amounts of elemental calcium, and elemental calcium is what
counts. Elemental calcium is the amount of calcium available for
absorption into your body. Always check the amount of elemental
calcium on the label; this is the only number that counts!
If the amount of elemental calcium isn’t listed on the bottle, you
can easily figure it out by using these formulas:
 Calcium carbonate contains 40 percent elemental calcium, so
1,000 mg contains 400 mg of elemental calcium.
 Calcium citrate contains 21 percent elemental calcium, so
1,000 mg contains 210 mg of elemental calcium.
 Calcium gluconate contains 9 percent elemental calcium, so
1,000 mg contains 90 mg of elemental calcium.
 Calcium lactate contains 13 percent elemental calcium, so
1,000 mg contains 130 mg of elemental calcium.
 Tribasic calcium phosphate contains 39 percent elemental cal-
cium, so 1,000 mg contains 390 mg of elemental calcium.
Table 11-2 breaks down the amounts of elemental calcium you get
when you combine specific amounts of calcium with the added
“ate” ingredient.

Table 11-2 clearly shows that the best “bang for your buck” in cal-
cium comes from calcium carbonate supplements; they contain 40
percent elemental calcium. The good news is that calcium carbon-
ate is also the cheapest and most common source of calcium in
supplements. The downside of calcium carbonate is that it can
cause gas, constipation, reflux, and bloating.
Ingesting your daily calcium
You need to remember these few caveats when you take your daily
calcium:
 If you’re taking a large amount, such as 1,000 mg, don’t take
it all at once. Your body can absorb only 500 mg of calcium at
one time. Split your doses up into morning and evening, if you
can remember to take two pills each day!
Chapter 11: Keeping Bones Strong with OTC Supplements 169

 Take your calcium carbonate with meals. It requires addi-
tional acid to digest.
However, calcium citrate, which is the best-absorbed form of
calcium supplement, is maximally absorbed if taken an hour
or so after meals. Calcium citrate also comes in a liquid form
that may be less irritating to intestinal walls. If you’re taking
any type of acid blockers, your body will better absorb cal-
cium citrate than other types of calcium.
 If your meal contained a large amount of fiber, wait one to
two hours before taking your calcium or it may not be well
absorbed. Fiber can move stomach contents through your
intestines too fast for calcium to be well absorbed.
 Drink a full glass of water or juice when you take your pill.
Doing so helps speed absorption and also helps you “wash
the pill down” without getting it stuck in your throat, if you
have difficulty swallowing pills.
 If you’re on other medications, don’t ingest your calcium
pill within one to two hours of your other medications.
Doing so can interfere with absorption of some medications;
discuss timing of multiple medications with your doctor.
Does it sound like you’ll need a calendar to keep all this informa-
tion straight? You’re probably right! Just make sure you plan out
when to take all your meds and supplements and then stick to that
schedule. You can also consider taking a combination supplement
(check out “Combining calcium and other vitamins and minerals”
later in this chapter.)
Calcium interactions
A large number of medications and foods can interact with cal-
cium. Be aware of the following possible interactions:
 Caffeine: High caffeine intake can cause excess urinary 
excretion.
 Dilantin: Don’t take it within one to three hours of calcium, or
the effects of both medications can be decreased.
 Iron: Don’t take iron and calcium at the same time, because
each can interfere with the other’s absorption.
 Laxatives: Anything that moves substances through the intes-
tine very quickly can result in calcium being excreted before
it’s absorbed.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
170

 Oxalic acid: You find this acid in spinach, soybeans, and coca;
it absorbs calcium found in these substances. It doesn’t affect
calcium taken in from other sources at the same time.
 Excess phosphorus and magnesium: The absorption of phos-
phorus and magnesium requires vitamin D. If you consume
these minerals in excess amounts, they’ll use up more vitamin
D, leaving less available for calcium absorption.
 Tannins in tea: They may interfere with calcium absorption.
 Tetracycline: Calcium supplements taken at the same time
may decrease the efficacy of this antibiotic; separate doses of
calcium and tetracycline by one to three hours.
 Thyroid medication: Calcium supplements can interfere with
effectiveness of thyroid medication. Take them at least two to
three hours apart.
Count calcium from fortified sources such as milk or juice as a sup-
plement. Don’t take fortified foods with drugs that shouldn’t be
taken with supplements!
Making sure your calcium dissolves
Swallowing a calcium pill is one thing; making sure that the pill 
dissolves quickly enough to be properly absorbed is something 
different.
A quick test to see if your supplement is sufficiently dissolvable is
to drop one into a glass of warm water or vinegar and see if it dis-
solves within a half-hour. If it does, it’s sufficiently dissolvable. You
don’t want it to have any chunks left at the bottom of the glass.
Chapter 11: Keeping Bones Strong with OTC Supplements 171
The coral calcium controversy
Coral calcium is most often sold in health food stores, at prices far above your aver-
age calcium pill. Coral calcium is simply calcium carbonate, plus small amounts of
magnesium with lead.
Some individuals have made claims that coral calcium cures everything from osteo-
porosis to cancer, but these claims have been debunked. No proof shows that coral
calcium works any better than any other calcium carbonate. Save yourself a few
bucks and skip the coral calcium.

Another way to be sure your pill will be absorbed is to buy only
supplements with “USP” (which stands for US Pharmacoeia) on
them. Pills with the label are guaranteed to meet the standard set
for adequate absorption.
Of course, if you take chewable or liquid supplements, you don’t
have to worry about whether or not they’re going to dissolve prop-
erly; at least you won’t as long as you chew thoroughly before
swallowing.
Table 11-3 lists the most commonly used calcium supplements.

Getting the lead out
You may want to increase your calcium levels, but are concerned
that doing so will also increase the amount of lead you ingest, pos-
sibly leaving you at risk for lead poisoning. The truth is, many cal-
cium compounds do contain small amounts of lead, because lead
and calcium are found together in marine calcareous deposits.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set an upper limit on
acceptable amounts of lead in 1,000 milligrams of calcium as 7.5
micrograms, but this amount greatly exceeds the 6 micrograms per
day experts recommend as safe for total lead ingestion.
Supplements with measurable lead contained no more than 1 to 2
micrograms, but the combination of overusing of calcium and
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
172

ingesting foods high in lead could cause an amount exceeding the
daily limit. Many companies have reduced lead content in supple-
ments by refining it out or by using calcium deposits with lower
lead content. Nearly 70 percent of supplements now have amounts
of lead below detection levels.
Fortunately, calcium blocks the absorption of lead in your intes-
tine, because both are absorbed at the same site, and the site
prefers calcium. So lead ingested along with calcium may be less
harmful than lead ingested from other substances.
Looking for supplements that state they test for lead content is
worthwhile, but don’t focus so much on the dangers of lead that
you stop taking any calcium supplements at all. Even more impor-
tant, don’t overdose by taking more pills than you need.
Unacceptable levels of lead, in addition to other heavy metals,
such as arsenic, have also been found in another calcium source
sold in some health food stores, bone meal. Bone meal is made
from processed crushed cattle or horse bone. Avoid using bone
meal as a calcium supplement!
Combining calcium and other 
vitamins and minerals
Some manufacturers have combined calcium with other necessary
elements in one supplement. If you’re the type of person who
wants to take just one pill and forget about the rest, or if you have
a tendency to forget half your pills on a daily basis, taking one of
these pills may appeal to you.
Combining calcium and vitamin D
Some supplements contain both calcium and vitamin D, which is
necessary for calcium absorption. Taking one of these supplements
is one way of assuring that you’re getting enough of both, but be
especially careful not to take more than the recommended dose.
You don’t want to overdose on them both.
Getting your calcium from multivitamins
You may wonder why you can’t just swallow your multivitamin and
forget about all these other complicated supplements. You could, if
you can find a multivitamin that contained an adequate amount of
calcium. However, most multivitamins contain only 200 mg, not
enough to supply your daily requirement.
Chapter 11: Keeping Bones Strong with OTC Supplements 173

Antacids for your bones?
What do you already have in your medicine cabinet that can boost
your calcium intake? Antacid tablets. But wait — before you throw
out your calcium supplements from the health food store, you may
want to consider whether antacids are really the best source of cal-
cium supplementation. Consider the following:
 Antacids contain the cheapest and best-absorbed form of 
calcium, calcium carbonate. Some antacids also contain 
aluminum, which actually interferes with calcium absorption
by binding with phosphorus in the intestines.
 Don’t use antacids containing aluminum as a source of cal-
cium supplementation!
 Calcium requires an acidic environment to be well absorbed.
Antacids, by definition, decrease stomach acid, and so may
result in less calcium being absorbed than a calcium supple-
ment without acid reducers.
 Some antacids have no active ingredients other than calcium
carbonate, which also acts as an acid reducer. These antacid
tablets are often chewable, easy to take, reasonably priced,
and can be the best way to get your daily dose of calcium.
Just be careful to check and see how much calcium is in your
antacid to be sure that you’re taking enough!
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis

Creating a dream team: 
Calcium and chocolate!
A new supplement on the market called Viactiv puts the almost unbeatable combi-
nation of chewable chocolate and calcium together. These bite-sized chews also
contain vitamins D and K along with calcium carbonate. Although the label says the
calcium amount is 500 mg, remember that only 40 percent, or 200 mg, of calcium
carbonate is absorbable.
Another downside of this seemingly unbeatable combination is that it does contain
some sugar, and therefore a small amount of calories. And you do have the possi-
bility of becoming hooked on these little candies and being tempted to overindulge.
Take only if you have adequate willpower to resist emptying the box!
Because this supplement has Vitamin K in it, you can’t take it if you take Coumadin
(a blood thinner).

Taking calcium when you have 
other medical conditions
Some medical conditions can affect your use of calcium supple-
ments. First, talk to your doctor and pharmacist and exercise
extreme caution if you have any condition known to elevate the
amount of calcium in your blood.
Three important conditions to consider are
 Hyperparathyroidism: With this condition your parathyroid
gland makes too much parathyroid hormone. This hormone
increases calcium absorption, and hence, extra calcium sup-
plementation can lead to dangerously high blood calcium
levels. High blood calcium levels can cause confusion, muscle
weakness, and abnormal heart rhythms, to list just a few of
the problems.
 Kidney stones: Occasionally patients with certain types of
kidney stones tend to have elevated calcium levels in their
urine. Discuss calcium supplementation with your physician if
you have a history of kidney stones or any other problem with
your kidneys.
 Sarcoidosis: This is a benign illness of unknown cause charac-
terized by granuloma formation in many organs. About one
quarter of individuals have elevated blood calcium levels.
Therefore if you have sarcoidosis, you must discuss the safety
of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with your physician.
If you’re diagnosed with one of these conditions, make sure that
you alert your doctor and pharmacist about any OTC supplements
that you take. Remember that the OTC supplements are drugs, and
your physician needs to monitor them just like prescription meds!

Managing Pain from
Osteoporosis 
In This Chapter
 Dealing with the pain of osteoporosis
 Finding medication that works for you
 Being aware of possible side effects
 Handling pain without medication
O
steoporosis isn’t painful until you’ve fractured something.
This important fact often confuses people. You can have a
significant reduction in bone density and have no symptoms at all.
If you’re one of the unlucky people who developed a fracture from
osteoporosis, you already know about the pain from the broken
bone. For instance, a broken hip or wrist can cause immediate pain
and inability to use the hip or wrist. Osteoporosis also can cause rib
fractures from minimal trauma. These typically cause severe pain in
various areas of the rib cage. (See Chapter 7 for more on how your
“bones go bad” without your realizing it until you break something.)
In contrast, if you’ve fractured a bone in your spine, you may still
be able to function normally, although you may notice that you’re
getting shorter progressively. And you may have pain in your back
that you simply dismiss as “getting older.” Most people who frac-
ture a vertebra due to osteoporosis don’t have sudden onset of
severe back pain. Only about one-third of patients with osteoporotic-
related spinal fractures actually come to medical attention because
of pain. Unfortunately, for those who do experience pain from
spinal fracture, the pain can be severe and unrelenting.
To keep the pain from any type of fracture to a minimum, you may
need to utilize several different pain-relieving techniques. Working
with your doctor to find the right combination of drug therapy,
exercise, or manipulation is the best approach to take.

Decreasing your pain can help keep you on your feet, and staying
mobile helps keep your bones strong. In this chapter, we discuss
ways you can deal with the pain resulting from a fracture so your
osteoporosis doesn’t drastically alter your life.
Recognizing the Real 
Pain of Osteoporosis
Pain not only hurts, but it also has long-lasting consequences
beyond the immediate discomfort. Acute pain, which occurs sud-
denly after an injury, is sometimes more bearable than chronic
pain because you know acute pain will go away — usually sooner
rather than later! Chronic pain, which lasts more than three months,
can alter your lifestyle as well as your physical and mental states.
Everyone has a different tolerance to pain. In some individuals,
chronic pain can make them angry, depressed, and even frustrated.
It can take the joy out of daily events, and leave you with a fear of
doing anything that might cause more pain.
Because osteoporosis is a chronic condition, you may be dealing
with both acute and chronic pain. Pain from rib fractures and
spinal fractures often lasts for three months or longer. The pain
from hip fractures and from wrist fractures is often shorter,
because the hip fracture can be surgically repaired and the wrist
fracture can be casted. The pain of osteoporosis doesn’t come just
from fractures; damage to muscles from abnormal posture caused
by vertebral compression fractures or from muscles tightening in
reaction to discomfort can also cause chronic pain.
If you fall and break a bone, you’ll obviously feel the immediate
pain; however, vertebral compression fractures usually occur with-
out any sort of trauma. In fact, 30 percent occur while you’re in
bed (no, not from doing that!)!
Because a fractured vertebra may not be as obvious to others or to
yourself as that of a visible break, such as a deformity from wrist
fracture, you may not realize at first that your pain is from osteo-
porosis. After you recognize the pain for what it is, several options
are available to help you alleviate the pain of osteoporosis.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
178

“Oh, My Aching Back!”
Does your back hurt? If so, you’re in good company. Nearly 45 per-
cent of Americans complain of aching backs. Although you may
think your aching back is caused by osteoporosis, only about half
the people who are diagnosed with spinal fractures complain of pain.
As you know by now from reading this chapter, back pain can be
caused by vertebral compression fractures; yet you still need to
check with your doctor about other potential causes as well. And
because 25 percent of all postmenopausal women will experience a
vertebral compression fracture, osteoporosis still accounts for a
lot of aching backs! Vertebral compression fractures account for
around 50 percent of all osteoporotic fractures, and one-third of
women older than age 65 have at least one in their lifetime.
Because back pain is so common, many people never follow up
with their doctor about it, dismissing it as just another part of
aging. This could be part of the reason that two-thirds of spinal
fractures are never diagnosed. Because of this statistic, anyone
older than 55 who has sudden onset of back pain needs to be eval-
uated for osteoporosis.
Chapter 12: Managing Pain from Osteoporosis 179
What’s hurting today?
Many of you may wake up each morning and do a mental inventory, sort of a “What’s
hurting today?” laundry list. Taking this step is actually a good idea, as long as you
don’t make it the highlight of your day! 
Being aware of what’s normal for you may help you be more aware when some-
thing has changed for the worse; the sooner you get treatment, the sooner you’ll
start to feel better.
Making notes of any new pain that shows up is a good idea. You can jot down the
type of pain (sharp, dull, stabbing, deep), the location, and exactly when it started
to hurt. You also need to keep track of what makes the pain hurt worse, and what
makes it feel better.
Your doctor will love you if you can answer questions like, “When did the pain start?”
by simply referring to your notes rather than vaguely guessing the answers. In fact,
keeping track — without being obsessive about it — is a good idea with all health
problems, not just those related to osteoporosis.

Treating Acute Pain 
from a Fracture
If you have a fracture other than a vertebral fracture, you feel
acute, or sudden pain, and often some deformity that’s clearly visi-
ble. Often, you won’t be able to move the broken bone.
Because a fracture causes immediate pain and disability, you need
to see a doctor immediately. Until you get to a doctor, immobilize
the broken bone with a splint or sling, if you break an arm or wrist.
If you think your hip is broken, don’t try to walk on it. If you have
to go upstairs to get to a phone, try not to put any stress on the
broken side.
After the doctor has worked to fix your fracture, discuss pain med-
ications and treatments with him. A complete description of all
pain-relieving medications is far beyond the scope of this book.
Nonetheless, the next section briefly mentions some of the medica-
tions that doctors often prescribe for a short time after a painful
fractured bone.
Narcotic medications 
for short-term pain
Initial pain from a broken bone can be treated with narcotic
painkillers, provided you aren’t susceptible to their side effects.
Narcotics may cause disorientation, dizziness, respiratory depres-
sion, and constipation, so if your doctor thinks any of those side
effects may be a big problem for you, he may want you to take
them for as short a time as possible.
We list some of the most common narcotic pain medications in
Table 12-1.

Pure narcotic (oxycodone) (comes in varying doses)
One important thing to look at with any prescribed or over-the-
counter (OTC) medication is whether the drug contains more 
than one type of medicine. For example, if your doctor prescribes
Tylenol #3 for you, she’s really prescribing 300 mg of acetaminophen
with 30 mg of codeine. This information is important if you’re also
taking acetaminophen separately because you increase the chance
of overdose and/or drug interactions if you don’t know exactly
what’s in the combination pill you’re taking.
When taking narcotic medications to treat short-term pain, 
remember these do’s and don’ts:
Do:
 Take your medicine the way the doctor prescribed. Never
“double up” on your dose without discussing it with her.
 Be especially careful when moving around. Many narcotics
make you drowsy and you don’t need another fall!
 Take only what you need to control the pain; narcotics can be
addicting.
 Tell your doctor if you have a rash, shortness of breath, or
any other unusual reaction to your medication.
 Take a stool softener if you’re prone to constipation.
Don’t:
 Avoid taking medication if you need it.
 Take a friend’s medication because “she had the same thing
and this worked for her.”
OTC analgesics or NSAIDs?
A quick trip to the drugstore to look for pain medications when
you’re hurting can leave you in more pain from brain strain. So
Chapter 12: Managing Pain from Osteoporosis 181

many little bottles of pills, and all claiming to be the best, or at
least “just as good” as the others. How do you know what works
best when you have pain?
We strongly recommend that if you have serious pain from a frac-
ture, that you consult your physician for proper instructions in
pain relief medications. Many OTC analgesics (pain relievers) can
cause drug-to-drug interactions or some other toxicity. (Any med-
ication that relieves pain is referred to as an analgesic regardless of
how it works.)
That being said, you’ll find that OTC pain medicines fall into two
categories: acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medications (NSAIDs).
Asking for acetaminophen
You’re not likely to walk into the drugstore and ask for 
acetaminophen — even if you can pronounce it! Acetaminophen 
is better known as Tylenol.
Acetaminophen has some benefits over NSAIDs and also some 
disadvantages. On the plus side:
 Acetaminophen is easier on your stomach.
 It generally causes less irritation.
On the negative side:
 Acetaminophen doesn’t reduce inflammation.
 Taking more than the recommended dosage of acetamino-
phen, 4,000 mg per day, can lead to liver failure. The risk for
liver failure is especially high if you mix acetaminophen with
alcohol.
 Acetaminophen can also cause blood thinning.
Turning to NSAIDs
If your doctor recommends an NSAID for pain relief, you can spend
hours picking up drug store bottles and comparing television com-
mercials. They all claim so many benefits; should you go with
“what doctors recommend most” or “the one hospitals use”?
NSAID is short for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which may
not seem any clearer to you at first. If you break it down word by
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
182

word, however, you get a pretty good definition of what an NSAID
is. It’s “not a steroid,” so it doesn’t have the bone-damaging charac-
teristics that steroids do (see Chapter 3 for more on the risks of
corticosteroids on your bones). However an NSAID is an anti-
inflammatory (against inflammation, or the warmth and swelling
you can have from an irritated or infected body part). NSAIDs
inhibit an enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX for short). (See the
sidebar “What’s COX got to do with it?” in this chapter, for more
information on how NSAIDs work.)
NSAIDs are further divided into three different types. We list each
type with an example: 
 COX-1 type: naproxen (Aleve), ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin)
 COX-2 type: celecoxib (Celebrex) — prescription only
 Salicylates: aspirin
As for which NSAID is best for you, ask your doctor first. Many
NSAIDs are available over the counter, such as aspirin, ibuprofen,
and naproxen. Some are available by prescription only.
Remember that NSAIDs all have similar side effects, which can be
harmful if you take more than the prescribed dose. For example, if
your doctor gives you a prescription for extra-strength ibuprofen,
don’t buy another NSAID over the counter, such as Aleve, aspirin,
or Advil, and take that as well. The resulting NSAID overdose can
be dangerous, causing stomach irritation or bleeding.
Chapter 12: Managing Pain from Osteoporosis 183
What’s COX got to do with it?
The first NSAID ever developed was aspirin. It relieves pain by inhibiting cyclooxy-
genase (COX) enzymes. When these enzymes are inhibited, there is a reduction in
swelling. Undoubtedly you’ve heard a lot about these enzymes because of the drug
Vioxx. (The Food and Drug Administration took it off the market in 2004 after some
research showed that it might lead to heart attacks and heart damage.) More than
30 different kinds of NSAIDs are available, and they’re all related to aspirin in the
sense that they all inhibit COX enzymes. They differ in their dosing and side effects.
Many are available over the counter. (See “Non-narcotic prescription pain med-
ications” in this chapter for more info.)

Important things to know about NSAIDs: 
 You can’t take Advil, Motrin, or ibuprofen (all the same thing!)
if you have a predisposition to gastroesophageal reflux, stom-
ach ulcers, renal disease, liver disease, or congestive heart
failure.
 If you’re taking warfarin (Coumadin), you need to be especially
careful about taking any other medications, particularly
NSAIDs. (Even acetaminophen can interact with Coumadin, a
blood thinner.) NSAIDs can increase bleeding, and the combi-
nation can lead to a serious gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
In the general population, the risk of GI bleeding associated
with NSAIDs use is about 1 percent, but the risk rises to 3 to 4
percent in those ages 60 and older.
You have a higher risk of GI bleeding if you:
• Are 65 or older
• Have a history of stomach ulcers
• Are taking corticosteroids
• Are taking Coumadin
• Are taking more than one NSAID
 Taking single drugs, such as plain aspirin, can be better than
taking combination drugs, such as Excedrin, which contains
acetaminophen as well as aspirin and also a hefty dose of caf-
feine. Combination drugs may give you ingredients you don’t
need and also increase the chance of drug interactions.
Non-narcotic prescription 
pain medications
At this book’s writing, the FDA is reviewing the safety and benefits
of taking NSAIDs called COX-2 inhibitors. (See the sidebar “What’s
COX got to do with it?” in this chapter, for more info.) These COX 2
inhibitors NSAIDs include Vioxx, Bextra, and Celebrex, which are
all prescription medications. An expert panel recently testified for
the FDA and recommended that Celebrex stay on the market.
(Vioxx was taken off the market in mid-2004, Bextra in 2005.)
Don’t continue to take these medications without discussing them
with your doctor and reviewing together the new information
about possible heart attacks while taking these drugs. A good
place to read about this complex and controversial topic is the
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
184

American College of Rheumatology Web site (www.rheumatology.
org/publications/hotline/0305NSAIDs.asp).
One medication often neglected in the treatment of pain due to
fractures is calcitonin. (We discuss calcitonin in Chapter 10.) This
hormone nasal spray is used to build bone density, but it also can
relieve pain. (Calcitonin is also available in a subcutaneous injec-
tion.) Dr. O’Connor often uses this drug in hospitalized patients
with pain from a new spinal fracture due to osteoporosis.
Your doctor may also prescribe medications such as antidepressants
(amitriptylene). You may protest that you’re not depressed; you’re
in pain! But if your doctor suggests them, give them a try. They
modify the way your nervous system processes pain and how the
brain processes the signals from the nervous system. Another 
drug that affects the way the brain processes pain is gabapentin
(Neurontin), an antiseizure medication. We discuss Neurontin in
the section “Seeing a pain management guru,” later in this chapter.
Another medication used to block pain may be familiar if you think
back to your last dentist visit to have a cavity filled. Prior to the
drilling, you probably received an injection of novocaine (or lido-
caine). This numbing medication is now available in patch form
that you can apply to your skin. It may be beneficial for relief of
back pain, and your doctor may prescribe it for the pain you’re
experiencing from an osteoporotic fracture. The patch of lidocaine
is called Lidoderm; you leave the patch on for 12 hours and then
remove it. Twelve hours later, you reapply another patch.
Treating Chronic Pain: What to Do
When Pain Goes On and On
If you break a bone, you expect a certain amount of pain. But what
do you do when the end of the painful experience never seems to
end? If you have a fracture, healing should occur within a few
months. If you’re still having pain after three months, ask your
doctor why.
When pain medication 
makes you woozy
Whenever you start a new medication, such as certain pain reliev-
ers with narcotics or even an OTC medicine, you have some poten-
tial for dizziness and wooziness, especially when you first get up
Chapter 12: Managing Pain from Osteoporosis 185

and stand after sitting for a long time. Be particularly careful
because one of the main risks for osteoporotic fracture is falling
(see Chapter 13 for more on how to prevent falls).
In fact, older people have a 10 to 25 percent higher risk of having
adverse reactions to drugs, so be vigilant about using handrails or
bracing yourself when you stand up. Many older people don’t
metabolize medicine as quickly as they used to, so the effects may
last longer. Less medication may be needed as well, because many
people older than 65 need a lower dose of medication to get good
relief. Start out with a low dose and increase if needed to decrease
the chance of dizziness or confusion from your medicine. See the
section “Narcotic medications for short-term pain,” earlier in this
chapter for more suggestions on taking narcotics safely.
Taking more than one medication
Opening your medicine cabinet may be a little like Pandora’s box;
all sorts of things may come out, and some of them may not be
good for you.
The most important thing to look for when taking more than one
medication is the way your medications react with each other.
Read the labels and make sure you’re not taking the same medica-
tion twice, under different name brands. Doing so is particularly
important if you’re taking a medication that can cause stomach
irritation and possible bleeding, such as aspirin or ibuprofen.
Always tell your doctor about all your medications and their doses,
even if they’re OTC, including all supplements, herbs, and drugs
from a health food store. And if you have “leftover” pain medicines
from a previous illness, make sure you check the expiration date
before taking them, because drugs can lose their potency after
they expire. Be sure to check with your doctor to make sure using
them is okay.
Studies have shown that people older than 65 take three times as
many prescription medications as the general population. People
older than 65 also are most likely to take their medicines incorrectly.
If your doctor prescribes pain medication for chronic pain, you
need to be very careful to take it correctly and to keep track of any
side effects.
Keeping an eye on addiction
Becoming dependent on pain medication is possible, but don’t be
overly concerned if you have chronic pain. Most studies show that
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
186

more people older than 65 are undermedicated for chronic pain
rather than overmedicated. Addiction can also occur if you
develop a tolerance to the beneficial effect of a narcotic. Are you
scratching your head and wondering what that means? It means
that the amount of drug that works to decrease your pain is no
longer enough, and you need to gradually increase the dose in
order to achieve the same pain relief.
That being said, some people do become dependent on narcotics,
even when they start out taking them for a legitimate reason. To
avoid problems with dependency, take pain medication only when
you really need it, not just because “it’s been four hours.”
The exception is when your doctor specifically tells you to take
your medication on a schedule so your pain doesn’t become
severe. Studies show that people who need pain medication
because they’re in pain are able to stop the medication without dif-
ficulty when they no longer have pain. Don’t be afraid to use your
pain medication in the way it’s intended.
Dealing with Pain 
without Medication
Although popping a pill may be easy for instant relief, you (and
your doctor) need to aim pain treatment at more than temporary
relief. The nonmedication methods in this section may relieve pain
and keep it from coming back.
Heating it up or cooling it down
Heat packs and/or ice packs can be very helpful for relieving pain,
especially if the pain is localized to one spot. If you’re very stiff in
the morning, standing in the warm shower can be enough to loosen
you up, but be sure you’re using your handrails! Cold packs can be
wonderful for reducing swelling and inflammation, and can reduce
pain by temporarily numbing the nerves.
You don’t have to buy expensive heat and ice packs, although you
can use the electric heating pads to cover larger areas, and some
are especially designed for your neck or back. Some apply moist
heat. However, if you want to make your own hot packs, you can
warm slightly dampened towels in the microwave. Remember that
microwaves don’t apply heat evenly, and make sure the towel
doesn’t get too hot in one spot; you could end up with a painful
burn in addition to your other aches and pains.
Chapter 12: Managing Pain from Osteoporosis 187

Frozen vegetables, especially peas, which can be made to conform
to oddly shaped areas, make very good cold packs. Of course, you
need to use the vegetables in the bag, not the ones in a box!
Crushed ice in a resealable baggie also makes a good ice pack.
Using physical therapy
Physical therapy can help you maintain and improve the muscle
strength you have, as well as increase your energy levels and raise
your levels of endorphins (natural painkillers released by your body).
Some physical therapists come directly to your home and can help
you assess your home for possible sources of injury. A physical
therapist can assess your gait, help you improve your posture,
reduce muscle strain, and help strengthen weakened or problem
areas with specific exercises. (Refer to Chapter 13 for more on
what a physical therapist does.)
Many insurance plans cover part or all the cost of physical therapy,
which can become quite costly if you go two to three times a week.
(See Chapter 8 for more on insurance coverage.) Your plan may
only cover if you go to a certain therapist, so make sure you check
with the physical therapist’s office to see if it’s part of your plan.
Exercising to get rid of pain
When you’re hurting, the last thing you may want to do is exercise,
but exercise keeps you limber, builds your strength, and increases
your energy level. The key to exercise is finding the right kind, 
not overdoing when you first begin, and not giving it up after a
short time. (See Chapter 6 for more on exercising if you have
osteoporosis.)
Aquatic physical therapy is one of Dr. O’Connor’s favorite prescrip-
tions after the acute injury has started to heal. Walking in a pool
filled with very warm water is beneficial in relieving pain and in
beginning the muscle-strengthening process. Swimming, although
not a weight-bearing exercise and therefore not helpful to improve
bone mass, is a good exercise for weakened or damaged tissue.
Warm water may also be wonderful for relieving muscle spasm.
Some insurance companies also cover part of the cost of pool or
gym membership, realizing that exercise helps reduce health prob-
lems overall. You may have to pay upfront and be reimbursed;
check with your insurance company for what it requires.

Exploring TENS units
A Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) unit uses
electrical impulses to block pain signals. A technician places elec-
trodes on your skin near the site that is hurting, and transmits a
mild electrical current through them, blocking the sensation of
pain for several hours.
TENS units cost around $100, and the electrodes run around $30
for a pack of four. Electrodes are good for between 15 to 30 uses.
TENS units run on batteries, and most are small enough to hook to
your belt so you can keep moving while you’re wearing one.
Use a TENS unit only under the supervision of your doctor or phys-
ical therapist; your insurance may reimburse the cost as long as
you have a prescription for the unit. You can also rent a TENS unit
before buying one to make sure it’s going to help you with your pain.
Many medical companies let you rent one for a month and apply
the rental fee to the purchase price if you decide to buy the unit.
If you have a pacemaker, you may not be able to use a TENS unit
without interfering with your pacemaker. Talk to your doctor before
considering a TENS unit.
Trying acupuncture for chronic pain
The word “acupuncture” may have you envisioning small dark
rooms with ancient Chinese chanting in the background. However,
in the last few years, acupuncture has become a more widely used
and accepted method for dealing with chronic pain.
An acupuncturist inserts very thin needles, about the width of a
strand of hair, into certain points of your body to stimulate nerve
endings and release endorphins. You may need six or more treat-
ments before you have significant pain relief.
Acupuncture became an officially recognized treatment for pain by
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1997. Physicians can be
certified in acupuncture after taking a 200-to-300-hour training
course. They’re then members of the American Academy of Medical
Acupuncture (AAMA). Chiropractors and naturopaths (practitioners
that treat health problems by using noninvasive natural medicine)
can also be certified in acupuncture by completing a 200-to-300-
hour course, and can then be approved by their state licensing
boards to provide acupuncture. The National Certification
Commission can also certify acupuncturists for Acupuncture and
Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM).
Chapter 12: Managing Pain from Osteoporosis 189

A variation of acupuncture is acupressure, where pressure is
applied to certain “trigger points” to relieve pain. An instructor
may be able to show you this technique so that you can do it at
home.
Massaging away the pain
You can also use massage therapy to decrease pain, relax muscles,
and relieve tension. Some malls have massage therapists set up so
you can shop and then drop onto the table for some relaxation, but
make sure the person doing your massage is a trained therapist.
Massage therapists should be graduates of an institution accred-
ited by the Commission for Massage Training Accreditation
(COMTA) and should also be members of the American Massage
Therapy Association (AMTA).
If you have osteoporosis, don’t allow a therapist to deep massage
near your spine. The pressure can cause fractures.
Bracing yourself, internally 
and externally
Spinal fractures are less likely to cause pain and deformity if
they’re braced; that is, if the broken bones are held in place to
keep your spine in the best possible alignment. Bones can be held
in place externally, by the wearing of a back brace, or internally, by
a newer technique called percutaneous vertebroplasty.
External braces are often worn only during the acute phase after
injury, because long-term use may weaken your back muscles.
Meanwhile, percutaneous vertebroplasty involves stabilizing the
fracture by injecting an acrylic cement into the broken areas of the
vertebrae. An even newer technique called kyphoplasty inserts
acrylic cement after inserting a balloon device into the vertebrae
to try and restore the vertebrae to their normal position. This pro-
cedure reduces the deformity known as a dowager’s hump that
develops when the vertebrae collapse. See Chapter 13 for more on
both procedures.
Coping with pain psychologically
Your mind is a powerful thing. In fact, “mind over matter” actually
can reduce pain. Several different techniques use your mind to
overcome pain:
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
190

 Biofeedback: With this technique, you discover how to use
your body’s response to decrease pain and stress through
positive reinforcement. Often the technique is first taught
with the use of a machine that records your heart rate and
other vital signs as they change in response to stimuli.
Eventually you figure out how to respond positively to pain by
relaxing muscles, breathing deeply, or by using visual imagery
to distract you from the pain.
 Guided imagery: This technique induces relaxation and
decreases tension and anxiety by using visual images.
 Hypnosis: This technique puts you into a “trance state” char-
acterized by extreme suggestibility and relaxation. A therapist
may demonstrate a type of self-hypnosis similar to relaxation
training so you can use it at home yourself.
 Relaxation training: This technique shows you how to relax
tense muscles and reduce anxiety that can intensify pain.
 Music therapy: You can use this technique in conjunction
with relaxation therapy to decrease anxiety and relax tense
muscles.
You can also incorporate several of these methods together, such
as relaxation training, music therapy, and biofeedback, to help
cope with pain.
Seeing a pain management guru
You also have the option of seeing a pain management specialist.
Typically a pain management specialist is an anesthesiologist with
special interest in pain who is trained to give nerve blocks and
other special procedures.
Pain management specialists often use a medication referred to as
gabapentin (Neurontin) for pain. Originally the FDA approved this
drug for treatment of seizures, but physicians discovered that it
was useful for the pain that occurs after shingles and for the pain
that occurs from damaged peripheral nerves, as seen in diabetes.
Now doctors use gabapentin as a medication for treatment of all
kinds of pain, as well as a number of other diseases.
Some pain management physicians are anesthesiologists with spe-
cial training in performing nerve blocks as well as other sophisti-
cated procedures designed to inhibit the impulses from the nerves
causing pain. You may have these procedures tried if you have
severe back pain from crushed vertebrae. Ask your primary care
doctor to refer you, if nothing else has worked.

Chapter 13
Recovering from a Fracture
When You Have Osteoporosis 
In This Chapter
 Looking for osteoporosis
 Avoiding falls
 Knowing which bones are most likely to break
 Healing your bones
 Avoiding another fracture
You may not have thought much about osteoporosis — until
you fracture a bone. Sad to say, many people aren’t diagnosed
with or treated for osteoporosis until after they’ve sustained their
first fracture.
This is especially true if you don’t fall into the stereotypical osteo-
porosis; for example, older men, who do have osteoporosis in sig-
nificant numbers (see Chapter 4 for more on men and osteoporosis),
may not even consider the possibility because they think osteo-
porosis is a “woman’s disease.”
We’re hoping you’re reading this book before you’ve broken a
bone, not while you’re resting on the floor waiting for someone to
come and find you after a fall. All kidding aside, a broken bone is
no laughing matter, and our goal is to prevent as many broken
bones as possible.
However, some fractures may occur, and we want you to know
what to expect if you have one. If you suffer any of the fractures we
discuss in this chapter, have your doctor thoroughly evaluate you
for causes of osteoporosis. Then you can work together to proac-
tively prevent your next break.
In this chapter, we discuss how to prevent breaking bones in the
first place, which bones are most likely to fracture, what type of

treatment you’re likely to undergo, and how you can get through it
with — well, maybe not a smile on your face, but with a minimum
of discomfort and inconvenience.
Checking for Osteoporosis 
after a Fracture
Anyone who has had a fragility fracture, such as a hip fracture,
spontaneous break of a bone in their back, or a wrist fracture (see
Chapter 1 for more on fragility fractures) needs to be evaluated for
osteoporosis or some other cause of weak bones, such as osteoma-
lacia. This workup may include bone density measurements (see
Chapter 9) and blood testing.
Anyone who has continued back pain, or who has lost several
inches of height, needs to be evaluated to see if his or her height
loss is due to compression fractures, fractures of the vertebrae. (See
“Comprehending vertebral compression fractures” later in this
chapter for the lowdown on compression fractures.)
Preventing Falls
Clearly, avoiding falls is an obvious defense against broken bones.
Unfortunately, falls are a part of many older people’s lives.
Falls however are much more than an embarrassing moment or a
minor inconvenience. Almost 8,500 people in the United States
older than 65 die from injuries sustained in a fall each year. In one
study, 25 to 35 percent of adults older than 65 fell once or twice a
year, often without being able to pinpoint a reason for the fall.
Even being in a controlled environment, like a nursing home under
supervision, doesn’t prevent all falls. Approximately 50 percent of
nursing home residents fall at least once a year, and 11 percent of
those who fall seriously injure themselves. By comparison, 30 per-
cent of seniors living independently fall each year, more than half
in their own homes.
As you age, your risk of falling increases. Around 50 percent of
people older than age 80 fall at least once each year (these falls
aren’t all attributed to osteoporosis). Why so many falls when 
you get older? The causes are many, but some of the biggest
offenders are
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
194

 Confusion
 Dizziness/vertigo
 Hearing problems
 Joint problems such as osteoarthritis involving lumbar spine,
hip, or knee
 Low blood pressure
 Multiple medications/sedating medications
 Poor balance
 Poor eyesight
 Unsteady gait (pattern of walking)
 Weakness from previous stroke
Preventing all falls may be impossible, but you can prevent a large
number by taking a few simple precautions. To decrease your
chance of falling, try these suggestions:
 Put grab bars in the bathtub or shower and use them.
 Clear clutter from your house, and don’t change your furni-
ture around too often!
 Light your house well.
 Wear nonskid socks or slippers.
 When you get up out of bed or out of a chair, rise slowly, and
have something sturdy nearby to use to steady yourself.
 Make sure your doctor is aware of all the medications you take,
even the OTC ones like Benadryl, which can make you sleepy.
 Use handrails when you go up and down stairs, and make sure
they’re secure. It doesn’t help if you and the handrail both end
up falling down the steps!
 Don’t carry heavy loads up or down the steps, like big baskets
of laundry. Take smaller loads and make two trips if necessary.
Carrying a large load obscures your vision and may also make
you unstable.
 Tripping over a sleeping pet is easy. Put something easily visi-
ble on your pet, a reflective collar or a very bright ribbon so
you can spot her more easily.
 If you use a wheelchair, be careful getting in and out; always
check to make sure the brake is locked.
 Get rid of slippery rugs, especially in the bathroom or the
kitchen, where the floor is likely to be slippery.
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 195

 Keep your steps free of ice and snow; hire a neighbor to do it.
It’s money well spent.
 Stay off ladders! That goes for climbing on kitchen chairs too.
(Now, if only your co-author Sharon could get her mom to 
do this!)
Altering your lifestyle is sometimes difficult. You may feel like
you’re not independent if you can’t do things for yourself, like
painting the 8-foot ceilings in your living room. But remember that
your independence will decrease even more significantly if you
become a fall statistic. So please — don’t change the second-story
storm windows by yourself!
Recognizing Breaks and What’s
Most Likely to Break
How do you know if you’ve broken a bone? Sometimes it’s quite
obvious; for instance, if you have a compound fracture, the bone is
sticking out of the skin! Some fractures aren’t so obvious. You
should suspect a bone is broken when:
 It hurts to move or touch the broken part.
 The broken part has bruising.
 The arm or leg is shorter than normal, or turns inward or 
outward.
 You hear a “snap” at the time of the injury.
 You can’t put any weight on the broken part.

196
Wearing hip protectors
You may not win any fashion awards with what looks like bulky underwear, but hip
protectors with their extra padding placed at the sides can reduce your chance of
a hip fracture if you fall.
One downside to hip protectors is that they’re expensive; a pair can cost nearly
$100. Several brands are available, with names like Safehip, HIPS, and Hip guard.
One of the best Internet sites carries a good selection of sizes and brands, as well
as selling other aids to help you live fall free. Check out www.hiprotector.com.
In addition to selling several brands of hip protectors, the site also offers medical
alert alarms and rails to help you get out of bed without falling.

So are you wondering which types of fractures are the most
common with osteoporosis? If you experience any of these frac-
tures, ask your doctor to check you for osteoporosis. If you already
have osteoporosis, be vigilant about preventing these breaks:
 Hip fractures: Although hip fractures may seem to get the
most publicity with osteoporosis, they aren’t the most
common osteoporotic fracture. Of the 1.5 million osteoporotic
fractures each year in the United States, approximately
300,000 are hip fractures.
 Vertebral compression fractures: Nearly half, or 700,000, of
the annual osteoporotic fractures in the United States are ver-
tebral compression fractures.
 Wrist fractures: Often called Colles’ fractures, these types
account for about 200,000 of the annual osteoporotic fractures
in the United States.
 Other fractures: The remainder includes mostly fractures of
the ribs, shoulder, and pelvis, although any bone can sustain
an osteoporotic fracture.
Although vertebral compression fractures can occur with little or
no trauma — a cough or sudden twist of your upper body can
cause one — hip and wrist fractures are most often related to falls.
The following sections detail each type of fracture and the specifics
you need to know.
If you decrease your chance of falling, you decrease your chance of
fracture. Make sure you’re doing all you can to stay on your feet
and off the floor! (Check out “Preventing Falls” earlier in this chap-
ter for specific ways to avoid falling.)
Handling hip fractures
Despite your best efforts to improve your bone strength and avoid
falls, some of you are going to fracture your hip. In fact, many of
you — men and women — will sustain a hip fracture — 300,000 of
you each year.
Hip fractures usually make it difficult, if not impossible, for you to
walk, but some people with a fracture have only vague pain in their
back, buttocks, groin, or thighs, and can walk normally. Some frac-
tures cause shortening of one leg with the foot and knee pointing
outwards.
Because joints and muscles are often sore in people older than 65,
determining whether a fracture is present, or if the pain has another
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 197

cause, such as osteoarthritis, is important. If you even just suspect
that you may have a fracture, get treatment as quickly as possible,
to prevent complications. Most hip fractures are easily seen on
plain radiographs (X-ray) although some are seen only with a
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography
(CT) scan, which are specialized highly detailed images of bone.
Where your hip fracture is located is critical. A break can occur in
several different places in the femur. Doctors classify the breaks as
the following:
 Intracapsular fractures: Nearly half of all hip fractures in the
elderly are in the femoral neck, and are sometimes called
intracapsular fractures. They occur one to two inches away
from the hip joint.
Femoral neck fractures can be harder to pin together, because
the bone at the break is more fragile and isn’t well anchored
by the pins. Femoral neck fractures can also disrupt blood
flow to the femoral head and can lead to bone death and joint
collapse (called avascular necrosis).
 Extracapsular fractures: These fractures, also called
intertrochanteric fractures, are lower on the femur.
 Around 55 percent of osteoporotic hip fractures are extracap-
sular. Other types of extracapsular fractures are trocanteric
and subtrocanteric.
Repairing your hip joint
Hip fractures are usually treated surgically. Some require total hip
replacement, while others can be pinned together and allowed to
heal. It depends on where the break is and how much “good” bone
your surgeon has to work with.
If your fracture is at the neck of the femur, just below the ball and
socket joint (an intracapsular break), your doctor may recommend
putting in a prosthetic metal hip joint, also called arthroplasty. This
procedure is often necessary in older patients because the broken
area won’t have enough blood supply to heal well, and may develop
osteonecrosis, or, literally, “dead bone.” The dead section of bone
will eventually weaken and collapse.
If both the ball and the hip socket are replaced, it’s called a total
hip replacement. If only the ball is replaced, it’s a partial hip
replacement (hemiathroplasty). Hip replacement parts generally
last 10 to 15 years.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
198

Your new hip can be fixed to bone in several ways. Some pros-
thetic devices are attached to the bone with rapidly setting plastic
cement called methyl methacrylate. Others are held in place by
bone growing directly into a roughened coating on the prosthesis.
Each type of fixation has its advantages and disadvantages. An
uncemented prosthesis may last longer in some people, because
there’s no cement to fail under repeated loading over the years. 
On the downside, recovery can take longer with an uncemented
prosthesis, because it takes time for bone to attach and grow into
the prosthesis. You may have to limit activities for as long as three
months. And you’re also more likely to have pain in the thigh as
the new bone grows.
Cemented replacements are used more frequently than cementless
ones for patients with osteoporosis or those with weakened bones.
Sometimes surgeons perform a hybrid procedure, where they
cement one component and not the other.
Fractures that occur lower on the neck of the femur (extracapsular
fractures) have a couple options. The surgeon can fix them inter-
nally by pinning the broken area back together with a surgical plate
and screws or pins, or the surgeon can perform a hip replacement.
Preparing yourself for surgery and aftercare
Your doctor will probably have a printed list of what to expect
after your surgery if your surgery is planned ahead of time.
However, it never hurts to hear everything twice, especially when
going into the hospital for major surgery.
Sometimes your doctor will perform the surgery shortly after your
hip fracture, and you won’t have time to square everything away.
You may have to rely on your spouse, a friend, or relative to get
everything in order for your discharge home. This simple list can
get them started:
1. Plan to have someone stay with you for a few weeks, 
if you live alone.
You aren’t going to be anywhere near as mobile as you
hope you’re going to be. Recovering from surgery is diffi-
cult, and having someone to save you steps can be a big
benefit. Try to progress your activities as much as your
surgeon allows.
2. Rent crutches or a walker if your hospital doesn’t 
provide them.
You may find it easier to start with a walker, especially
because you can attach a carry bag to the walker with all
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 199

your essentials. Depending on the type of person you are,
these essentials could include the latest paperback, knitting
or crocheting material, or the TV remote! You’ll probably
want to keep your glasses, tissues, medications, telephone,
and possibly a water bottle with you as well. Buy a big bag,
but make sure it hangs evenly off the front of the walker;
you don’t want extra weight pulling from either side.
You may feel much more stable using a walker for the first
few days or weeks; crutches can be hard to manage. After
you graduate to crutches, wear a carpenter’s apron (or a
frilly apron, if you prefer!) or something with big pockets to
carry your essential items around.
3. Clear a path through your frequently used rooms.
You may be surprised at how many small rugs and pieces
of furniture you find in your way when you get home. You
used to sidestep them without a second thought, but now
they can be major obstacles to getting around without
another fall.
4. Arrange a downstairs sleeping area.
If all your bedrooms are on the second floor, you may want
to rent a hospital bed. Getting on and off a low couch may
be difficult or not recommended by your surgeon.
5. Check your bathroom for accessibility to the toilet.
Some bathrooms are rather cramped and you may find it
difficult, if not impossible, to maneuver your walker close
enough to ease yourself onto the toilet.
If maneuvering around your bathroom looks to be a prob-
lem, rent a portable toilet. These rented johns are usually
higher than a standard toilet and easier to get onto when
you’re using a walker or crutches.
You may also want to consider your shower setup. Showers
seats are available so you can sit comfortably while taking
a shower. A hand-held shower nozzle can make washing
your hair easier. Getting down into a bathtub may be diffi-
cult for several months after surgery. Your doctor may
even recommend against using a bathtub.
6. Don’t plan on cooking any big dinners.
Forget about cooking Thanksgiving dinner for your clan of
20. The turkey can wait! Let someone else host this year. In
addition, have a good supply of frozen dinners on hand, or
else make sure the person staying with you doesn’t mind
doing the cooking.

200

What to expect at the hospital
If you’ve never had surgery before, you may not know what to
expect. Although procedures may vary somewhat from hospital to
hospital, most will follow this pattern:
1. Your doctor will discuss your surgery with you and have
you sign a surgical consent.
A nurse may also give you pain medication if you’re uncom-
fortable. Some recent studies have shown that patients
whose hip surgery is performed within 24 hours of the frac-
ture have less pain. Sometimes surgery can’t be done that
quickly if you have other medical issues that need medical
clearance before surgery.
2. You may have an electrocardiogram (EKG) done and
blood drawn to assess your general health and look for
any potential problems, such as anemia or an infection.
Some hip fractures can result in considerable loss of blood
even before surgery.
3. The anesthesiologist may come in to discuss anesthesia
with you.
Your doctor can perform hip surgery under general or
regional anesthesia, like a spinal or epidural. A review of
several recent studies shows that regional anesthesia may
be slightly more beneficial for hip surgery. But you may
experience more pain while the anesthesiologist is adminis-
tering the anesthesia because you’ll need to be rolled on
your side.
You won’t be allowed to eat or drink anything for 12 hours
or so before surgery so that your stomach is empty and 
the risk of aspiration during surgery will be decreased.
Aspiration occurs when the contents of your stomach move
up into the throat and down into your lungs. Sounds ugly
and it is!
4. You’ll be taken down to a preoperative area to wait for
your surgery.
If you don’t already have an intravenous line (IV), 
a nurse will put one into your vein. The surgery lasts
approximately two to three hours. You may have a 
10-to-12-inch incision if you had standard hip surgery; 
if you have minimal incision surgery, you’ll have a 
3-to-5-inch incision.
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 201

5. You’ll be taken after surgery to a recovery area, where
you’ll remain until you’re awake and your vital signs,
like your blood pressure and heart rate, are stable.
You’ll probably be in the recovery area for an hour or so. A
nurse will frequently check your blood pressure and pulse.
As soon as your vital signs are stable, you’ll be moved to
your room.
6. The day after surgery, you’ll be encouraged to sit up and
possibly even stand for a short period.
Doing so helps keep blood clots from developing.
Getting back on your feet without complications
Because there’s a high risk for complications after hip surgery,
your doctor will want you back on your feet as soon as possible —
probably much sooner than you feel like getting up!
You may find yourself on your feet with the help of a walker or
crutches just a few days after surgery. Moving around is crucial to
keep you from developing pneumonia or blood clots from staying
in bed too long.
You’ll probably spend less than seven days in the hospital after a
hip pinning replacement. After the initial time in the hospital, you
may go home or spend a few days or few weeks in a rehabilitation
center for further recovery. In the rehab center you’ll spend your
days under the watchful eyes of specially trained therapists,
nurses, and physicians. When you’re discharged home depends on
a number of factors, such as your overall general health and
whether or not you have anyone to help you after you get home.
If you have a hip replacement, the most common postoperative
complication is a hip dislocation. Essentially, the ball slips out of
the socket.
To avoid dislocation, don’t place your hip in certain positions,
such as pulling your knees up to your chest, or crossing your
affected leg past the midline of your body. Your hip becomes dislo-
cated because the artificial ball and socket need time for scar
tissue to stabilize the hip. The ball can become dislodged from the
socket more easily during the first three months after surgery.
As with any surgery, you can develop an infection at the surgical
site. Your doctor probably will prescribe antibiotics to help pre-
vent infection. You may also need to do breathing exercises for the
first few days to keep your lungs working well so you don’t develop
pneumonia.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
202

Over the long term, foreign material in your body can cause an
inflammatory reaction. This can happen after hip replacement sur-
gery when small pieces of material wear off the artificial joint and
are absorbed by surrounding tissue. The inflammation can eventu-
ally result in bone destruction near the implant, causing it to
become loose. Check with your surgeon about yearly visits for
early detection of this problem.
Because problems with infection deep within the bone can occur
years after your surgery, tell your dentist or doctor before having
any procedures done, even teeth cleaning. They may want to pre-
scribe prophylactic antibiotics.
Because of the risk of developing blood clots (also known as deep
vein thrombosis, or DVT) due to decreased mobility and damage to
the veins during surgery, you may be given a blood thinner, such
as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or heparin, at the time of surgery
and for a short time afterwards. Newer types of blood thinners
known as fondapiranux are also available.
Your doctor may also ask you to wear compression stockings.
These stockings keep the blood flow moving through your legs to
help avoid clot development.
Physical activity after hip replacement
Early mobility is the key to recovering from hip surgery. Getting
back on your feet helps you avoid certain complications like blood
clots and pneumonia, which actually cause more mortality than
the surgeries themselves. 
Having a new hip joint may tempt you to try to become more phys-
ically active. Remember that physical exercise is good for you. It
can reduce joint pain and stiffness and increase muscle and bone
strength. However, don’t forget that artificial hip joints have a
more limited range of motion than your original hip joint, so you
may need to discover new ways to sit or bend to avoid damaging
the joint.
Your doctor may discourage activities that put high-impact stress
on your hip joint, such as running, basketball, or tennis. Walking or
swimming are low-impact exercises that can help improve muscle
strength, although swimming doesn’t increase bone strength
because it’s a nonweight-bearing activity (see Chapter 6 for more
on exercise).
Your doctor will probably prescribe physical therapy after your
surgery (see the following section), and you can be assured that
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 203

your physical therapist will assess your recovery carefully and will
start with simple activity before moving on to more demanding
routines.
Therapy after hip surgery
Physical therapy is critically important in osteoporosis, because
bed rest can lead to more bone loss. However, getting back to
normal after any fracture isn’t easy. With hip surgery, getting back
to normal is even more difficult. Statistics show that less than half
of those people who undergo hip surgery ever regain their former
mobility or quality of life.
We don’t provide these stats to discourage you, but to motivate
you. You can regain a great deal of your former abilities with physi-
cal therapy, but it’ll take work. The more you know about what will
help you get back to whatever is “normal” for you, the better
equipped you’ll be for the demands of the post-surgery period.
(See Chapter 12 for more on pain management after a broken bone.)
Many doctors recommend physical therapy after most kinds of
injuries and orthopedic surgeries. Physical therapists are specially
trained to develop an exercise regimen specific to you. First, they
assess your abilities. Then they work with you to increase the diffi-
culty of your exercise program as you become stronger.
You may feel as though you’re barely out of anesthesia before
physical and occupational therapists (under the guidance of a
physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine) are in your room,
encouraging you to get moving. (Occupational therapists are spe-
cialized therapists trained in rehabilitation of upper extremity
problems.) You can check out the sidebar, “Encountering two 
therapists — physical and occupational,” in this chapter for more
on what therapists do.

Encountering two therapists — 
physical and occupational
Physical therapists and occupational therapists are both specially trained profes-
sionals who have advanced degrees and are integral parts of the healthcare team
when it comes to musculoskeletal problems. Both help people improve their ability
to perform tasks in their daily living and working environments.
Physical therapists do much more than take care of patients after osteoporotic frac-
tures. They may take care of accident victims and people with disabilities, such as
low-back pain, arthritis, heart disease, head injuries, and cerebral palsy.

In your first sessions, your physical therapist works at getting you
to move safely in and out of bed, without doing damage to your-
self. You’ll also discover how to properly use a walker or crutches.
An occupational therapist may help you with figuring out how to
get dressed and bathed.
If you go to a rehab hospital after surgery, you’ll discover how to
gradually do your daily care yourself, and as time progresses, to
walk farther and with fewer physical aids, a single point cane, and
finally to just your own two feet!
You may not be back to your own two feet when you graduate from
the rehabilitation facility, though. Up to 85 percent of patients are
still using a cane or other device for walking six months after their
fracture. Have your doctor evaluate you after six months or so to
make sure your recovery is on track.
Make sure you eat well. Eating well is a critical part of healing from
a hip fracture. Plenty of protein (20 grams per day) and supplemen-
tation of calcium and vitamin D have been proven to increase your
bone mineral density and speed your recovery. See Chapter 5 for
more on nutrition.
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 205
A physical therapist may help you if you have had surgery by
 Helping you develop or regain strength and flexibility
 Working to develop pain control techniques
 Improving your balance and coordination
 Decreasing swelling and inflammation in joints
Meanwhile, occupational therapists help individuals with physical, mental, or emo-
tional handicaps to develop, recover, or maintain daily living and work skills. Some
are specially trained to look at the small joints of the hand and wrist. They create
custom braces to protect hand joints that are damaged by injury or arthritis.
An occupational therapist may help you if you have had surgery by
 Assessing your home for falling hazards
 Helping you modify your environment to decrease the chance of injury
 Protect your upper extremities from injury when using a cane or walker
An occupational therapist also often manages rehabilitation after a wrist fracture.

If you need revision surgery . . .
Only around 10 percent of hip surgeries need to be revised or
redone over a five-to-ten-year period, but if you’re one of the 10
percent, that statistic isn’t going to make you feel any better.
Doctors have to perform revision surgery for a number of reasons:
 Aseptic loosening is the most common, where the hip implants
become loose within the bone. This loosening can be painful.
 Wear of the polyethylene-bearing surface in the socket
 A break of the prosthesis
 A break in the bone around the prosthesis
 Infection
Revision surgery is more complicated than the first hip surgery, for
several reasons. The bone around the implant may be in poor con-
dition to attach to, and removing the prosthesis may necessitate
more extensive surgery. Also, the unfortunate fact is that you’re
probably going to be older at the time of revision surgery than you
were at the time of the original surgery. Age brings more problems
with mobility and increased chance of complications.
However, don’t worry too much about revision surgery. Knowing
how long, on average, a hip replacement lasts can be reassuring.
The following list shows how long hip replacements last, on average:
After ten years, 90 percent of hip replacements still function well.
After 20 years, around 80 percent still function well.
After 25 to 30 years, around 50 percent still function well.
Comprehending vertebral 
compression fractures
Some of you reading this book already have vertebral compression
fractures and don’t know it. Around 25 percent of all postmenopausal
women in the United States have at least one; if you’re a post-
menopausal woman older than 80, your odds increase to 40 percent.
(See Chapter 12 for more about vertebral compression fractures.)
Vertebral compression fractures occur when the weight of your
upper body exceeds the ability of your spine to support the load.
Ironically, you’re more likely to have a spinal fracture if you’re small.
Overweight people are less likely to have vertebral compression
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
206

fractures, probably because their weight-bearing load is increased,
which strengthens their bones.
The two common types of osteoporotic spinal fractures are
 Wedge fractures: In a wedge fracture, part of the vertebral
body collapses, making the bone into the shape of a wedge. 
If several vertebral bodies collapse, the spine bends forward,
which is called kyphosis (see Chapter 7 for more about 
kyphosis).
 Burst fractures: In a burst fracture, the break goes all the way
across the vertebrae, causing loss of height.
Both wedge fractures and burst fractures can cause a number of
complications. These complications include
 Bowel obstruction
 Chronic pain
 Constipation
 Crowding of internal organs
 Decreased self esteem
 Loss of height
 Loss of urine control
 Respiratory disease
 Weight loss due to abdominal compression
Diagnosing compression fractures
Only about a third of vertebral fractures are diagnosed, partly
because back pain is considered by many to be a normal part of
aging, and also because some vertebral compression fractures
don’t cause pain.
The standard method for diagnosing compression fractures is 
X-ray. Make sure your doctor orders pictures of the lumbar and
thoracic spines from both front and side views. Statistics show
that up to 20 percent of people have more than one compression
fracture present.
A CT scan can help diagnose fractures not easily seen on X-ray. A
CT scan can also diagnose burst fractures that may appear to be
wedge fractures on X-ray (see the previous section about the differ-
ences between wedge and burst fractures). An MRI is recommended
if your doctor suspects spinal cord compression or other neurolog-
ical involvement.
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 207

Compression fractures can occur anywhere on your spinal column,
although they’re seen most commonly in certain vertebrae, namely
T8 through 12, L1, and L4. For more information about the different
parts of your spine, visit www.back.com/anatomy.html.
Treating compression fractures
Treatment for compression fractures runs the gamut. Depending
on the location and symptoms of your fracture, your doctor can do
the following:
 Bed rest and painkillers: If you have a stable fracture, one
that won’t be displaced by movement, your doctor may simply
prescribe a few days’ rest and mild painkillers, if necessary
(see Chapter 12 for more on pain medication for fractures).
Calcitonin, a hormone sometimes used to help prevent bone
fractures, can also help decrease pain from vertebral com-
pression fractures.
 Brace: Your doctor can also prescribe a bracing device called
a Thoracic-Lumbar-Sacral Orthosis (TLSO) to treat a spinal
fracture. Some doctors prefer not to use bracing, however,
because using constant support may weaken your bone.
To make TLSO a little easier to understand, the term thoracic
refers to your chest area, lumbar and sacral your lower back.
 Percutaneous vertebroplasty: This procedure is the injection
of acrylic cement into a collapsed or weakened vertebra to
stabilize the fracture. Stabilizing the fracture can help
decrease pain.
You’ll probably be sedated with an IV medication or other
sedative during the procedure. If you have severe pain, you
may need general anesthesia for the procedure, because it
may be too painful for you to stay lying down in the position
necessary to inject the cement.
After the procedure, you’ll need to lie flat for one hour to allow
the cement to harden. You may need to stay in the hospital for
another hour or so for observation, at which time you should
be able to stand and walk. It may take up to three days to feel
pain relief, although some people have immediate relief.
 Kyphoplasty: This technique is new for stabilizing vertebral
fractures and decreasing pain. Kyphoplasty is done through a
small incision in the back under either a local or general anes-
thetic, depending upon the severity of the case. The entire
procedure takes about an hour for each treated vertebra. You
should be in the hospital no longer than a day; you may possi-
bly be allowed to return home the same day. You may notice
pain relief within two days of surgery.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
208

The advantage of kyphoplasty over vertebroplasty is that
kyphoplasty may return the spine to a more normal align-
ment, decreasing the dreaded “dowager’s hump.”
Pain relief was reported in more than 90 percent of kypho-
plasty patients. However, the new technique is still in its
infancy. Only about 500 patients have received this treatment.
Complications occur in about 1 percent of individuals and can
be mild or serious. Allergic reactions to the cement have been
reported, and the most serious complications are bleeding
related to needle placement and damage to a nerve or the
spinal cord.
Recovering from vertebral compression fractures
If you have spinal compression fractures, you may be in a great
deal of pain and not be able to move around much at first.
However, as soon as possible, provided that you don’t have
damage to the nerves in your back, you need to engage in a physi-
cal therapy program.
Don’t spend too much time in bed, because prolonged bed rest
weakens bone. Get up as soon as possible, even if you can only
stay up for short periods of 30 to 60 minutes at a time.
Work to begin walking as soon as possible, being careful to main-
tain good posture, which helps reduce the load on the fracture and
decrease pain. You can start with walking for just a few minutes
and work up gradually to 20 minutes or so by adding a minute or
two each week.
Exercise is important after a vertebral fracture, but it needs to be
the right type of exercise. Until your fracture is healed, usually
within 8 to 12 weeks, stick to exercises that don’t put any strain on
your spine, such as sit-ups or toe touches. You can safely
strengthen your abdominal muscles just by tightening them as
long as you don’t move your back.
Ideally you’ll have the help of a physical therapist to show you
which exercises are safe after a spinal fracture, because the chance
of another fracture is high. If you don’t already have a therapist,
ask your doctor to recommend one.
You may find walking with the help of a rolling walker that has four
wheels easier than a walker with the standard two wheels in the
front. Avoid standard walkers because you put extra strain on the
fractured area each time you lift the walker.
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 209

If you have difficulty maintaining good posture, a back brace may
help you temporarily. Occupational therapists can help fit you for a
back brace, as well as show you the best way to carry out daily
activities without putting strain of the fracture.
Want another option? T’ai Chi, an ancient eastern practice, is a
popular exercise regimen that improves balance and strengthens
muscles. Ask your physical therapist if T’ai Chi is right for you!
(You can also check out T’ai Chi For Dummies by Therese Iknoian
and Manny Fuentes [Wiley] for more information.)
With a snap of your wrist — 
a Colles’ fracture
A Colles’ fracture — the medical term for a wrist fracture — is the
result of a normal instinct — the instinct to put your hand out
when you’re falling, to break your fall.
You may suspect a Colles’ fracture if you have pain and swelling
just above the wrist, and you can’t hold anything with any weight
in your hand. The wrist may be at an odd angle to your hand. X-
rays can also diagnose a Colles’ fracture.
You’ll probably need to have the bones realigned and the wrist
splinted or casted to keep the bones in proper position to heal. If
you’ve broken more than one bone in the wrist, your doctor may
need to pin or otherwise internally immobilize the broken areas.
A Colles’ fracture can lead to some loss of mobility in the wrist;
you can also have chronic pain if you’ve injured ligaments in the
wrist. You may also develop arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome, a
painful compression of a nerve in your wrist, from damage to the
median nerve.
Although a wrist fracture may not seem as serious at first as a hip
fracture or spinal fracture, it can be a difficult fracture to recover
from. You never know how much you use your wrist until you lose
the use of it! In fact, it can take up to two years to fully recover use
of your wrist after a fracture, and even then some problems with
mobility and pain may remain.
After a wrist fracture, your wrist will be immobilized for six to ten
weeks in a cast or splint. You may need to elevate your arm to
reduce swelling. Occupational and physical therapy can help you
to increase your use of the wrist, helping strengthen it and
increase mobility.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
210

Other kinds of fractures
Although hip, spine, and wrist fractures are the most common frac-
tures in osteoporosis, other bones can break too. For example, ribs
can break with bouts of coughing or even from an overenthusiastic
hug from a grandchild!
Broken ribs are painful, and take between three to eight weeks to
heal. You may feel pain especially when taking a deep breath, and
may feel better when you “splint” the rib by holding your hand
over it. You may also experience some bruising.
Applying heat to the painful area may help it feel better. Don’t wear
a binder unless your doctor specifically recommends one. You
need to be able to take deep breaths to keep your lungs clear.
The pelvic bones can break as well, usually after a fall. If you frac-
ture your pelvis, you may have pain in your groin, hip, or lower
back. Other symptoms may include
 Abdominal pain
 Bleeding from the vagina, urethra (urine tube), or rectum
 Difficulty urinating
 Difficulty walking or standing
 Numbness/tingling in the groin or legs
Treatment of pelvic fractures depends on the severity of the break.
In the case of a minor fracture, bed rest and OTC or prescription
painkillers may be all the treatment needed. Your doctor may also
recommend physical therapy, the use of crutches, and surgery.
Healing from a pelvic fracture can take anywhere from a few weeks
to several months.
How Long Does Bone 
Take to Heal?
Bone is a complicated living tissue, and its complexity is obvious
when you look at the healing process of bone. Exactly how fast the
bone heals depends somewhat on what type of bone is broken.
You basically have two types of bone. (See Chapter 2 for more on
different types of bone.)
Chapter 13: Recovering from a Fracture 211

 Cortical (compact): Cortical bone is denser, about four to six
times denser than trabecular bone. About 75 to 80 percent of
your skeleton is made of cortical bone. Cortical bone makes
up most of the shafts of long bones, like the femur.
Cortical bone heals in four to eight months.
 Trabecular (spongy): Trabecular bone is spongier and makes
up the other 20 percent of bone. Trabecular bone is found at
the end of long bones and in the bones of the vertebrae.
Trabecular bone heals within three to six months. Trabecular
bone heals more quickly than cortical bone in part because of
its better blood supply.
If you have a problem with low amounts of vitamin D in your blood
or some other problem with vitamin D metabolism, it will take
much longer for your fracture to heal. (See Chapter 11 for informa-
tion on vitamin D.)
Reducing the Chance 
of Another Fracture
Statistics show that if you’ve had one osteoporotic fracture, your
chances for another one increase. After you know your bones are
more prone to fracture, you need to be extra vigilant about taking
care of yourself. Now is the time to intervene.
Make sure that you receive follow-up from your primary care
doctor or rheumatologist. Take your medications (Chapter 12),
exercise regularly (Chapter 6), eat well (Chapter 5), take your cal-
cium and vitamin D supplements (Chapter 11), and don’t hang off
second-story ladders.

Focusing on the Future 
of Osteoporosis
In This Chapter
 Expanding prevention
 Improving diagnosis
 Uncovering new meds
 Relying on new surgical techniques
 Combating osteoporosis worldwide
 Looking at the next generation
W
hen Dr. O’Connor first started studying rheumatology (the
study of bones and joints), there was no good way to detect
early osteoporosis. In fact, no medications were even available to
improve fragile bone. Fortunately with the advancements of sci-
ence, a simple testing procedure has been developed to detect
early bone disease. Doctors also now have treatments, that when
instituted early, can build bone density.
In this chapter, we show that even though the medical field has
come a long way, it still has many challenges ahead in eradicating
osteoporosis and making everyone’s bones as strong as
Superman’s (or Superwoman’s).
Improving Osteoporosis Prevention
Recent research has identified the burden of bone disease, which
is staggering, not only in terms of money spent, but also in terms
of problems that can’t be as easily measured such as loss of 
independence.
Scientists can predict the number of fractures and costs of those
fractures if nothing is done to change the current trend. Doctors

and researchers also have the tools, such as diagnosis and medica-
tions, to decrease osteoporosis in the next generation.
Unfortunately, just having the information doesn’t always change
things. For example, doctors know that changing diet and exercise
patterns in girls between the ages of 9 and 12 makes a difference in
their adult bone strength. The challenge is to translate that infor-
mation into changes that truly alter the face of osteoporosis forever.
How do doctors encourage 
patients to change habits?
You probably know how difficult it is to change established habits.
Almost everyone knows that smoking, drinking excessively, and
lying on the couch eating bon bons all day isn’t healthy, but people
still do them. So how do doctors change habits, not only individu-
ally, but also nationwide? We suggest these ideas:
 Doctors can discover lessons learned from other health edu-
cation campaigns such as those campaigns that promote
smoking cessation.
 Doctors can educate through population-based approaches.
 Doctors can educate one-on-one.
Research needs to be done to investigate which interventions are
most effective in changing behaviors. What messages are most
effective for children? What messages work better for men?
We hope that the readers of this book will not only improve their
own bone health, but will also take the steps to improve the bone
health of their family members.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
214
Relying on professional associations
Several major organizations have missions solely directed toward improving 
bone health. They’re constantly working to increase knowledge of how osteoporo-
sis can be prevented. The most notable organizations are the American Society for
Bone and Mineral Research (www.asbmr.org), the National Osteoporosis
Foundation (www.nof.org), and the American College of Rheumatology
(www.rheumatology.org).

How are healthcare 
providers educated?
Healthcare providers realistically can’t know every detail about
every topic in medicine. Through writing this book and reading 
literature and seeing patients, your authors have become experts
in this field. However, no physician could possibly know every
detail about bone disease. But if the majority of healthcare providers
understood some key facts about osteoporosis and then imple-
mented them, it could result in a major improvement in the quality
of many people’s bones.
For example, about five years ago, a study in Pennsylvania showed
that only 20 percent of patients who had a hip fracture ever filled a
prescription for a drug that was known to improve bone density.
Although some of those patients might not have filled a prescrip-
tion that was given to them by their doctors, many more probably
never even received a prescription for an osteoporosis medication.
Other studies have shown that too few patients with a fragility frac-
ture, a bone that breaks with minimal or no trauma, were conse-
quently worked up with a DXA scan or with medication.
What could be the causes for this lack of doctor and patient 
follow-up? Here are some possibilities:
 When patients break a bone and then the fracture heals, they
may think they don’t need any further treatment, especially if
their doctor doesn’t stress the need for follow-up.
 Many people fail to understand the connection between
fragility fractures and osteoporosis. (See Chapter 1 for more
on fragility fractures.)
 Coordination of patient care among several doctors could
result in no one taking the responsibility of initiating treat-
ment for osteoporosis. (This is the proverbial “someone
needs to take the ball and run with it” problem!)
For example, your family doctor may think your gynecologist
is looking after your osteoporosis — or vice versa.
 Healthcare providers may feel that starting treatment in
patients who are older would be too difficult and complicated.
 The doctor or patient might feel that osteoporosis medica-
tions won’t work, because a fracture has already occurred.
Chapter 14: Focusing on the Future of Osteoporosis 215

Clearly, understanding why certain patients with osteoporosis
don’t get treated can improve strategies to identify those people 
at risk.
The hospital where Dr. O’Connor practices has initiated a program
to alert residents in training to initiate a “fragility fracture workup”
when a patient is admitted to the hospital with a fracture that
could be due to osteoporosis or another metabolic bone disease. 
A fragility fracture typically is a hip, spine, or wrist fracture and is
related to lack of bone strength.
Initiating this type of evaluation is a step in the right direction.
When encountering a patient with a fracture, every doctor needs
to reflect on whether or not her patient has experienced a fracture
with minimal trauma. If the doctor suspects a fragility fracture,
then she needs to order the appropriate testing to determine
whether osteoporosis or osteomalacia is present. (Osteomalacia is
soft bones due to problems in making mineral deposit on bone. See
Chapter 1 for more on the differences between osteoporosis and
osteomalacia.) Then the doctor needs to ask: Why does my patient
have osteoporosis?
Needing more research in prevention
There’s no question that preventing bone loss before it occurs is
better than trying to play catch up and strengthen bone that has
already become weakened.
In Chapter 1, we describe how you achieve your highest bone 
density in your 20s and 30s. Ideally you want to have a high bone
density in your early adulthood, because the higher your peak
bone mineral density, the more bone you can lose before you fall
into the dangerous, fracture-prone range. Research has shown that
exercise and calcium intake are two key factors that increase peak
bone mineral density. But much more research is needed regarding
what other factors determine peak bone mineral density.
A great deal of attention has recently been focused on vitamin D
deficiency in the elderly (see Chapters 5 and 11 for more on vita-
min D deficiency). Would the use of more vitamin D supplementa-
tion in food be the solution? Or would it be preferable to encourage
everyone to have their vitamin D level measured after age 55? This
screening blood test would follow the pattern of many other tests
that are performed routinely for prevention. Many of you already
check your cholesterol, thyroid, blood count, and PSA (a test for
possible prostate cancer) every year. Testing blood for vitamin D
levels wouldn’t be difficult.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
216

Only in the last few years has emphasis shifted from calcium alone
to calcium plus vitamin D as essential for bone maintenance.
Research into vitamin D and bone health indicates that current
published guidelines for adequate circulating levels of circulating
vitamin D may be woefully low. Doctors and their patients still need
more information regarding how much vitamin D is required for
adequate bone mineralization throughout growth and development. 
In this book, we increase the recommended daily amount of
Vitamin D to 800 IU in people older than 70.
Looking at Future Technologies 
for Your Bones
Researchers are continuously working to develop new technologies
to look inside the human body and analyze the DNA codes that
make you you. We hope the technology of the next decade will
make it possible not only to diagnose and treat osteoporosis in its
earliest stages, but also to predict who will have osteoporosis and
give preventive treatment long before any evidence of the disease
develops.
Better diagnosing for fragile bone
The current definition of osteoporosis depends in large part upon
a radiological technique, called Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry
(DXA), which has certain technical limitations. In 1990, researchers
interested in bone disease met in Copenhagen, Denmark, and
defined osteoporosis as “a disease of bony fragility, characterized
by low bone mass, micro architectural deterioration of bone tissue
and a consequent increase in fracture risk.” This definition moves
away from the idea that osteoporosis is strictly related to a meas-
urement on a DXA scan.
DXA scans only measure bone density in two dimensions.
Researchers are developing new radiological techniques that can
better analyze bone architecture. Using sophisticated computer
programming techniques, radiologists are discovering how to
measure bone strength in three dimensions. This technology is
referred to as helical or volumetric CT scanning. Some evidence
suggests that these types of scans will give a more accurate picture
of the precise structure of bone.
Chapter 14: Focusing on the Future of Osteoporosis 217

Understanding how your 
genes lead to osteoporosis
In Chapter 3 we mention how important your family history is in
predicting your risk for osteoporosis. But just what role does
heredity have in determining your peak bone mineral density? And
what role does heredity have in determining your rate of bone loss
after menopause or andropause (male menopause)?
Researchers might be able to answer these questions (and many
others) by looking at the genes that are linked to fractures or low
bone density. For example, researchers are working on these ques-
tions in Iceland, a country where the population is small enough
that blood to analyze DNA can be obtained from every single
person.
The illness called osteoporosis is really a heterogeneous disease,
which means that there are different causes of bone loss in differ-
ent individuals. In other words, your decreased bone strength and
your neighbor’s low bone strength may have two entirely different
causes and may need two entirely different treatments. This makes
dissecting the genetic factors very challenging.
Another way of approaching the problem is to look for rare diseases
affecting bone density. One such rare disease occurs in children
and causes fractures. A researcher has shown that this disease is
linked to a defective low-density lipoprotein receptor protein 5
gene. Interestingly, when this gene is overactive, an illness with
very high bone density results.
Finding Future Medications
Several effective drugs are now available for treating osteoporosis,
but many have side effects that make them difficult or impossible
for some women to take.
Because some of the drugs available have to be taken daily, there’s
a potential for noncompliance, with some people not taking their
medication due to confusion or just plain forgetfulness. Some new
medications can be taken less frequently, or by intermittent intra-
venous infusion.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
218

New ways of giving bisphosphonates
As we discuss in Chapter 10, one of the side effects of bisphospho-
nates is esophagitis, an irritation of the esophagus. Therefore if you
have a problem with your esophagus, your doctor might not allow
you to take alendronate or risedronate.
If you do have esophagitis, your doctor may consider intravenous
forms of bisphosphonates. One type is pamidronate, which has
been used for years for the treatment of Paget’s disease and cer-
tain complications of metastatic cancer. Dr. O’Connor often uses
pamidronate in her patients with esophageal problems.
Unfortunately, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn’t
approved pamidronate for use in osteoporosis. Therefore some
insurance companies don’t pay for its use. Nonetheless, some liter-
ature and anecdotal evidence indicates that this medication is safe
and effective and it works similarly to other bisphonphonates.
Although pamidronate is administered four times per year, another
new disphosphonate has been developed that can be administered
once a year. This drug is known as zoledronic acid.
In 2002, a study on zoledronic acid showed that one dose yearly
increased bone mineral density. Larger trials with more people and
over a longer period of time are underway to assess whether frac-
tures rates can be reduced. (See Chapter 10 for more information
about pamidronate and zoledronic acid.)
Chapter 14: Focusing on the Future of Osteoporosis 219
Experimenting with new 
synthetic estrogens
A new synthetic estrogen compound, Estren, increased bone density and strength
in female and male mice without the side effects associated with hormone replace-
ment therapy (HRT). Although what works in mice doesn’t always work in people,
Estren could be an alternative treatment for women who stopped using HRT
because of the recently uncovered associated risks for cancer and heart disease.
Estren is part of a new class of compounds called ANGELS (Activators of Non-
Genomic Estrogen-Like Signaling). Scientists were able to separate estrogen’s
bone-strengthening chemicals from those that affect the reproductive system.
Estren, which contains chemicals that appear to preserve bone mass, didn’t cause
any side effects in the reproductive tissue of mice. More animal studies will need
to be done before Estren is tested on people.

Developing new drug compounds 
by studying bone biology
Research is ongoing to develop substances that can keep bone pro-
ducing what it needs to stay strong. One method that researchers
are developing for improving bone density in people with osteo-
porosis is looking for substances that prevent osteoclasts (cells
that break down bone) from binding to bone.
Osteoblasts (cells that build bone) make a protein known as osteo-
protegerin (affectionately referred to as OPG). OPG binds to another
protein, which activates osteoclasts. Therefore researchers have
developed a compound that acts like OPG. They hope to turn this
compound into a new drug that can increase bone density.
Phytoestrogens, which are naturally occurring estrogens found in
plants, may increase production of osteoprotegerin.
Again, much research will be needed before the general public
might benefit from this information. For more information about
new drugs on the horizon, see Chapter 10.
Repairing Collapsed Vertebrae: 
A New Surgical Treatment
One of the most devastating complications of osteoporosis is the
bent back that results from collapsed vertebral bodies. The bent
spine (dowager’s hump) is due to multiple compression fractures
(fracture of the vertebrae). To make matters worse, not only do
these fractures cause deformities, but also they can cause severe
and relentless pain.
A new surgical technique called kyphoplasty is a variation on a pro-
cedure known as vertebroplasty. (We describe vertebroplasty in
Chapter 13.) Kyphoplasty is used in patients who have painful
spinal fractures of less than one year’s durations. Kyphoplasty
uses an additional step in the vertebroplasty process that involves
the use of a balloon to create a space inside the bone cavity so that
more cement can be injected.
So essentially, a specialist (usually an orthopedist) inserts a large
needle into the fractured bone, inflates a balloon, and injects
acrylic cement, which hardens to keep the vertebrae in place.
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
220

Local anesthesia is used and some mild intravenous sedation. The
initial results look promising with fewer complications compared
to vertebroplasty.
No randomized clinical controlled trials have been conducted with
this technique showing benefit of these procedures, but early
results in more than 500 patients show promise. If you have col-
lapsed vertebrae, consider this procedure only after obtaining sev-
eral opinions. Make sure your surgeon has had a great deal of
experience in performing this particular procedure.
Fighting Osteoporosis on 
an International Level
The effort to end osteoporosis is worldwide. Scientists are continu-
ally conducting research and attending seminars to discover ways
to better prevent and treat osteoporosis. Two organizations have
led the fight against osteoporosis worldwide: 
 The World Health Organization (WHO): In the year 2000,
WHO launched the “Bone and Joint Decade” 2000 to 2010 
project. This international effort highlights the fact that public
health officials have recognized the importance of muscu-
loskeletal health. An international conference each year
addresses topics including how to educate physicians and
patients about osteoporosis and other problems affecting
bones and joints. In 2004, 57 countries presented reports
regarding their efforts to combat osteoporosis. For more 
information about the Bone and Joint Decade, click on
www.boneandjointdecade.org.
 The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF): The IOF’s
mission is to improve early detection and treatment of osteo-
porosis by collaborating with national governments and
healthcare systems throughout the world.
The IOF has initiated many noteworthy and interesting pro-
grams, including the first Asia-wide campaign to alert women
to the risk of developing osteoporosis. In October 2004, the
organization ran a TV and print campaign in Asia urging women
to take control of their bone health by taking the IOF “One
Minute Osteoporosis Risk Test.” In addition, the IOF showed
three mannequins to graphically illustrate the three most
common fractures due to osteoporosis (wrist, spine, and hip).
Chapter 14: Focusing on the Future of Osteoporosis 221

Part of the campaign also focuses on physicians and how they
can do a better job of diagnosing and treating patients with
osteoporosis.
The IOF (www.osteofound.org) also sponsors the
International Congress on Osteoporosis, an annual meeting
for health professionals to share the latest findings in bone
health, and World Osteoporosis Day, an event that focuses
each year on one particular issue related to osteoporosis. In
2004, the attention was on men.
Battling Osteoporosis 
in the United States
Organizations in the United States are also doing their share to end
osteoporosis through education and prevention. The following rep-
resent just a few of the organizations working to battle osteoporo-
sis in the United States.
 The Surgeon General’s Office: While we were writing this
book, the Surgeon General published a comprehensive report
on osteoporosis. The document is 404 pages long (yes, it’s a
lot to read!) and demonstrates the interest that the United
States Department of Health and Human Services has in
improving bone health. The publication is free, and is avail-
able online, in print, and in CD format. It has everything a
healthcare professional should know about osteoporosis and
has great information for laymen as well. You can find the
report at www.http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/
bonehealth/content.html.
 The National Committee for Quality Assurance: This is a
nonprofit oversight organization interested in assessing and
improving performance of healthcare agencies in the United
States. In 2004, the committee began to grade managed
Medicare programs on their management of women who have
suffered a fracture.
 The National Institutes of Health (NIH): The NIH has a won-
derful program for educating the public about milk called
“Milk Matters.” The Web site (www.nichd.nih.gov/milk)
contains valuable information.
Certain states have begun programs specifically addressing osteo-
porosis. Just a few examples include the following:
Part III: Diagnosing and Treating Osteoporosis 
222

 Michigan’s Osteoporosis Project: This project is a statewide
program designed to reduce the prevalence of osteoporosis
and reduce the number of osteoporosis-related fractures.
 New Jersey’s Project Healthy Bones: This program is a 24-
week exercise and osteoporosis education curriculum that
emphasizes exercise, osteoporosis prevention, and treatment
strategies as well as home safety and falls prevention.
 North Carolina’s Osteoporosis Coalition: This program pro-
motes education and support for prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment of osteoporosis so as to achieve a reduction in its
prevalence, severity, and costly consequences.
In addition, many states have started education programs aimed at
children to stress the importance of diet and exercise in the devel-
opment of strong bone. Some schools have gone so far as to remove
soda vending machines from their buildings, replacing soft drinks
with milk and juice. For much more about state legislation and to
find out what your state is doing in the fight against osteoporosis,
check out the Appendix.
Ongoing Research Regarding
Osteoporosis
With new medications, education starting in childhood, and better
detection methods, osteoporosis could, in the very near future,
become a disease of the past. Education is one of the keys to
changing the face of osteoporosis, and it needs to start — well, if
not in kindergarten, then not long after.
Everyone needs to know that osteoporosis isn’t a disease only of
older women. (It can affect young people and men too.) And every-
one needs to know that the habits you form and things you eat
have lifelong effects on your bones.
What can you do if you already have osteoporosis? You can take
advantage of today’s technology and work on educating the next
generation so that they’ll never have to utilize it. Then we hope
that one day in the not too distant future, your grandchildren will
scratch their heads and ask, “Osteoporosis? What’s that?”

calcium intake? Want to know the top ten questions
people ask about osteoporosis? Want to discover even
more about osteoporosis and your bones? It’s all here in
The Part of Tens.

Chapter 15
Ten Surprising Sources 
of Calcium 
In This Chapter
 Finding calcium in unusual places
 Trying mineral water
 Enjoying some high calcium dinners
I
f a glass of milk isn’t exactly your cup of tea, you may think
you’re doomed to a calcium-deficient life. Don’t despair — you
can get your calcium from other sources outside the traditional
milk carton.
To help build strong bones that will carry you into your golden years,
you need more than 1,000 mg of calcium each day, depending on
your age (see Chapter 5 for more about daily calcium requirements
by age). If your golden years are coming up quickly — that is, if
you’re older than 50 — you need at least 1,200 mg of calcium a 
day. That’s almost as much as you need during your teen years
(1,300 mg), when the foundation of your adult bone is being built.
In this chapter, we tell you how to fill your calcium requirements
from sources you probably never thought of as good sources of
calcium.
Drinking Mineral Water
Do you enjoy drinking mineral water but find it hard to justify the
cost? It may help to know that a bottle of mineral water can con-
tain anywhere from 25 to 400 mg of calcium per liter. Carrying a
bottle of mineral water around with you is a great way to satisfy
both your water and calcium requirements. Check labels to make

sure you’re getting the maximum amount of calcium for your dol-
lars. To help you out, we include a few brands (and their country
of origin) that have a high calcium level:
 Badoit (France): 190 mg per liter
 Borsec (Romania): 310 mg per liter
 Evian (France): 78 mg per liter
 Perrier (France): 147.3 mg per liter
 San Pellegrino (Italy): 208 mg per liter
 Vittel (France): 91 mg per liter
Going Beyond Leafy Green Veggies
Do you plug your nose at the smell of fresh green vegetables, such
as spinach, broccoli, or romaine lettuce? Don’t worry. If you don’t
like eating leafy greens, you can still hit the veggie tray and get
your calcium from other vegetables.
Carrots contain 33 mg of calcium per cup, and cauliflower adds 22
mg per cup. Celery strips, which often seem like they’re not valu-
able for anything except holding cream cheese or peanut butter,
are good for 50 mg of calcium per cup. Add two tablespoons of
cream cheese (25 mg) and you have 75 mg of calcium. (You can
even eat healthier with fat-free or low-fat cream cheese and still get
the same amount of calcium.) Eat a dozen, and you’re almost up to
your daily requirement!
Snap beans, green or yellow, add 41 mg per cup to your daily
count, and if you’re in the mood for Chinese, Chinese cabbage
adds 74 mg per cup.
A cup of canned pumpkin is worth 64 mg of calcium. Mixed with 
a half cup of evaporated milk (350 mg) and poured into a small
pastry shell, you’ve got pumpkin pie — and more than 400 mg of
calcium in a single sitting. (We won’t discuss the calorie count,
however!)
Munching on Nuts and Seeds
Okay, so vegetables may not thrill you a whole lot more than milk
does — how about some ideas for calcium that are more like treats
and less like a chore to consume?
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
228

How about half a cup of almonds? How much easier could 200 mg
of calcium be to ingest? You don’t like almonds? How about pista-
chios (140 mg), macadamias (40 mg), or pecans (73 mg)?
Are you against nuts because they contain a lot of a fat and calories
or are you allergic to nuts? How about sunflower seeds (140 mg)?
Or sesame seeds (131 mg) ground into a wonderful sweet snack
called halvah? Who said getting your calcium wasn’t fun?
Eating Tacos for Dinner
Warm up the taco shells. Taco shells have 132 mg of calcium in one
serving! Add the cheese (350 mg per serving), the sour cream (60
mg per ounce), and a plate of nachos with cheese (272 mg) before
dinner and you’ve satisfied more than half your daily requirement
and had a great time!
Sending Out for Pizza
Do you feel like staying home tonight and having a pizza delivered?
One slice of cheese pizza contains 300 mg of calcium — and do you
ever eat just one slice?
Taking One Latte to Go!
You may not like milk — but how about a latte? For some reason, 
it doesn’t really taste like milk, does it? And one 12-ounce latte is
good for 400 mg of calcium. If you don’t want the caffeine buzz, 
you can always get a decaf.
Chugging a Little OJ Today
Can’t start the morning without a glass of orange juice? Go ahead;
one cup of fortified OJ contains 350 mg of calcium. Or try a differ-
ent kind of snack. Nibbling on a bowlful of calcium-fortified cereal
(without the milk) brings your breakfast total up to 500 mg to start
the day. Or have a carton of low-fat yogurt (300 mg of calcium) for
650 mg of calcium to start your day.
Chapter 15: Ten Surprising Sources of Calcium 229

Adding a Little Molasses
Are you looking for a sweetener that may actually have some
health benefit? Try a little molasses. Two ounces contain 115 mg of
calcium. You can find molasses in gingerbread and baked beans, if
you don’t feel like putting it on ice cream or eating it off the spoon.
Indulging on Chocolate Cake
One devil’s food chocolate cake contains 1,100 mg of calcium.
We’re not advocating substituting the cake for a good day’s intake
of more healthy calcium-rich food, but isn’t it nice to know that
chocolate cake is good for something?
Powdering with a Different Twist
Do you ever think about nonfat powdered milk? A tablespoon of
nonfat powdered milk contains 52 mg of calcium, and you can toss
a few tablespoons into everything from gravy to homemade cook-
ies. Keep a box handy and increase your calcium intake without
even noticing it!

Chapter 16
Ten Things You Need 
to Know about Bones
In This Chapter
 Counting up the benefits of having healthy bones
 Making healthy bones a lifelong priority
 Finding reasons to keep your bones together
H
aving healthy bones and avoiding osteoporosis has, for many
of you, become just one more health chore that you know
you need to do, but you just may have not gotten around to it.
Your co-author Sharon’s sister, an X-ray tech who works for a
group of orthopedic doctors, said, “Bones are so boring” when
Sharon first talked about writing this book. Undoubtedly, many of
you can relate and agree with Sharon’s sister.
Okay, so bones are boring. Talking about taking your calcium and
eating your vegetables can be dull. Even though thinking about
bones may be boring, taking care of them isn’t boring if you realize
how important they are. In this chapter, we give you ten very inter-
esting reasons why you need to pay attention to your bones
throughout your lifetime.
Broken Bones Hurt!
If you’ve ever had one, you know having a broken bone hurts. And
if you’ve been fortunate and never had one, just ask someone who
has and she’ll tell you all about the pain.
Not only do broken bones hurt, but they also take a long time to
heal. If you break an arm or leg, you may spend six weeks in a cast.
If you break a hip, you’ll be on crutches for months. For a graphic
illustration, borrow a pair of crutches and see how much fun it is
to use them in the bathroom.

Or, for even more graphic fun, wrap some type of bandage around
your arm for a day and then imagine it there for several weeks.
Your skin gets all flaky under the cast, and it gets really itchy, 
too. You go crazy trying to think of ways to scratch through the
cast. And when you take the cast off, your arm is skinny and 
gray — not to mention flaky.
Broken Bones Can Make 
You Sick — or Worse
The mortality rate from broken bones, especially hips, is very high.
The fracture itself may not cause further illness, but the inability to
move around can. In fact, a rather frightening 24 percent of hip
fracture patients older than age 50 die within one year of their frac-
ture. Two-thirds of those who fracture a bone never fully recover
their former quality of life.
If you’re in bed for a long time, you’re more likely to develop blood
clots or pneumonia, illnesses that can lead to the most serious
consequence of broken bones — death within the year of a fracture.
Having a broken hip can lead to permanent residence in a nursing
home. One quarter of those who were able to walk unaided before
their fracture ended up needing permanent nursing care after their
fracture.
Increasing Calcium Certainly
Helps Decrease Fractures
Some research suggests that as many as 40 to 60 percent of 
osteoporotic-related hip fractures could have been avoided if
people would just consume enough calcium. We give you some
great and painless ways to take in your recommended daily
amount of calcium in Chapter 15. The older you get, the more 
calcium you need.
Milk Is Really Important to Bone
One cup of milk provides one-fourth of your daily requirement of
calcium and one-fourth of your daily requirement of vitamin D,
both of which are important for bone growth and health (see
Chapter 5 for more about diet).
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
232

The power of milk to increase your daily calcium intake is why
your parents probably taught you to drink four glasses of milk
each day.
You Don’t Get a Second 
Chance at Building Bone
Don’t wait until you’re 70 before you start thinking about your
bones. You actually finish building bones by your 30s; after that,
you can replace what’s lost, but you can’t increase what you have.
This news doesn’t mean you can’t still improve your bone strength
at age 70. In fact, you can help keep what you have by eating well,
exercising, and avoiding excess alcohol and smoking. But you can’t
increase the bone you have at this point. The bone you built before
your 30s is all you’re ever going to have.
Today’s Bad Habits Lead to
Tomorrow’s Bone Loss
In some areas of life, you can put your bad habits aside after you
reach your 30s and 40s and live as though you never made them.
But when it comes to your bones, yesterday’s bad habits affect the
amount of bone you have for the rest of you life!
Lack of exercise, smoking, and drinking too much alcohol will
catch up to you later in life. Losing bone density is only one of the
consequences of bad habits, but it’s an important one.
Develop an exercise program with your doctor, stop drinking
excessively, and throw away your cigarettes. (If you need help with
the latter, check out Quitting Smoking For Dummies by David Brizer,
MD, [Wiley].) Make sure you’re passing these bits of wisdom on to
the next generations; they’ll thank you in the future.
Getting Shorter Is No Fun at All
If osteoporosis added inches instead of subtracting them, it might
not be such a bad thing. But because many people go through life
wishing to be a little taller, the prospect of losing what little height
they have isn’t a pleasant one!
Chapter 16: Ten Things You Need to Know about Bones 233

Growing shorter may be a problem on your wallet because you
have to spend more money buying clothes that fit. However, the
loss of height caused by fractured vertebrae is more costly to your
health because it can also cause the following (to name a few of
the more serious side effects):
 It makes deep breathing difficult.
 It decreases your appetite because your stomach feels
squashed.
 It results in weight loss that you may not be able to afford.
Your Bones Are a Storehouse 
of Necessary Minerals
Bones do more than help you stand up; they’re also the store-
houses of a large amount of the minerals you need to keep every
system in your body functioning. Your bones store 99 percent of
your body’s calcium, along with 85 percent of phosphorus, 60 per-
cent of magnesium, and 35 percent of sodium. These minerals give
strength and rigidity to our bones, and serve as a reservoir of min-
erals that the rest of your body can draw on to keep every system
in your body functioning properly.
Broken Bones Cost Society 
a Ton of Money
You may not be that concerned about costing society money. But
the fact is that society’s money is really everyone’s money, so
money lost by hospitals, workplaces, and the government eventu-
ally costs everyone, including yourself, in higher prices and taxes.
A 1996 report by the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF)
reported that the cost of treating osteoporotic fractures was
between $13 and $18 billion (yes, billion!) a year. That study is nearly
ten years old so the costs have probably risen. Rehabilitation and
institutionalization accounted for about 40 percent, and inpatient
hospital care about 25 percent of the cost. The cost of premature
death accounted for another 33 percent, with 1 percent or so due
to lost time in the workplace.
These costs are only going to rise as the population ages and as
more people age 65 and above fall down and break something.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
234

Bones Turn Over All the Time
Eating well and exercising for a week or two isn’t enough to main-
tain strong bone, because bone is being broken down and rebuilt
all the time. You have to make eating well and exercising a part of
your everyday life.
Before you turned a year old, nearly 100 percent of your bone had
been replaced by new bone. As an adult, about 10 percent of your
bone is replaced each year.
Bone remodeling is a 24-hour a day operation; old bone is con-
stantly being removed and new bone being laid down. Anything
that disrupts the process of new bone building, such as a lack of
calcium or vitamin D, affects the amount and type of new bone
growth.

Ten Resources for Finding
Out More about Osteoporosis
In This Chapter
 Uncovering more info about osteoporosis
 Trying a support group
 Perusing books and Web sites
 Discussing osteoporosis with your doctor
You may want to know more about osteoporosis than we can
tell you in this book. The good news is that plenty of informa-
tion is available for you out there. You just have to uncover it.
In this chapter, we tell you how to find the latest updates, the
newest studies, the most supportive support groups, and other
resources to keep you in the know about what’s going on with
osteoporosis.
Staying Up-to-Date with the NOF
Started in 1984, the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) pro-
motes awareness, public and professional education, advocacy,
and research. The NOF is a nonprofit organization; membership is
currently $15 per year within the United States.
Membership buys you a quarterly newsletter called Osteoporosis
Report and a 70-page booklet called Boning Up On Osteoporosis.
The Web site (www.nof.org) also includes a list of doctors special-
izing in osteoporosis treatment. Keep in mind that the doctors
listed pay to be listed, and aren’t endorsed by the NOF.
The NOF also helps set up support groups for osteoporosis called
Building Strength Together around the country. (See the “Joining a

Support Group” section in this chapter for more information on
how it works.)
The NOF also sells books, exercise tapes, and promotional material
related to osteoporosis on its Web site. If you’re not comfortable
surfing the Internet, you can contact the organization to request
materials at 
National Osteoporosis Foundation
1232 22nd St. N.W.
Washington, DC 20037
202-223-2226
Relying on the NIH
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is associated with two
sources of information on osteoporosis: the National Institute of
Aging Information Center and the NIH Osteoporosis and Related
Bone Disease-National Resource Center.
 The first resource is a branch of the NIH called the National
Institute on Aging Information Center (NIAIC). NIAIC’s Web
site (www.nih.gov/nia) is a wealth of information on clinical
trials and research, not only related to osteoporosis, but also
about aging in general. You can order publications on a
number of topics related to osteoporosis and aging.
You can reach the NIAIC in a number of ways. You can e-mail
at niaic@jbs1.com, or call at 800-222-2225 or 800-222-4225
(TTY). If you want to send away for information, write 
NIAIC
P.O. Box 8057
Gaithersburg, MD 20898
 The second resource is associated with the NIH Osteoporosis
and Related Bone Diseases-National Resource Center. The
organization’s Web site (www.osteo.org) has many fact
sheets that you can download or have mailed to you.
If you want to snail mail the organization, write to

238

Utilizing Expert Medical Facilities
Harvard Medical School and the Mayo Clinic are two well known
medical facilities that publish a plethora of medical information of
just about any topic you can name, including osteoporosis, exer-
cise, and diet.
Harvard publishes a number of 30- to 50-page pamphlets on topics
such as Boosting Bone Strength for $16 each. (Prices may be subject
to change.) In addition, the Web site (www.health.harvard.edu/
newsletters/special.html) contains a copious number of arti-
cles and information on osteoporosis and related subjects. You
also can call Harvard Health publications at 877-649-9457 or e-mail
them at harvardpro@palmcoastd.com.
The Mayo Clinic is well known as a prolific publisher of health infor-
mation for consumers as well. Mayo’s Web site (www.mayoclinic.
com) is a wealth of information on many health issues; you can also
subscribe to a free newsletter.
Joining a Support Group
Talking and commiserating with a group of people who know what
you’re going through because they’ve also gone through the same
situation can help you deal with your condition. Support groups
are everywhere, and you can find osteoporosis support groups in
most large cities and quite a few small ones as well.
The NOF (see the “Staying Up-to-Date with the NOF” section earlier
in this chapter) sponsors and helps set up support groups around
the country under the name Building Strength Together (BST). The
NOF supplies materials, referrals, a manual to help you know
where to start, and technical support. If you go to the NOF’s Web
site (www.nof.org), you can find a link to applications to join sup-
port groups separated by age and gender.
Your local newspaper may have a section that lists area meetings.
You can also utilize your nearest hospital; many groups meet at or
are sponsored by area hospitals.
Chatting Online about Osteoporosis
No matter what subject interests you, you can be assured that
someone else out there is also interested and wants someone to
talk to about it on the Internet.
Chapter 17: Ten Resources for More about Osteoporosis 239

Osteoporosis is no exception. Nearly all the large Internet providers,
such as Yahoo!, AOL, and MSN, sponsor support groups for every
disease known to man, including osteoporosis. Just type “osteo-
porosis support” into your search bar and click on the results.
Some groups are far more active than others by holding local 
meetings among people who live near each other. If your first
encounter turns out to be a dud, don’t despair — plenty of groups
are out there! You may find some people who chat in more than
one group — and you can do the same!
The great thing about online bulletin boards and chatrooms is that
they never close. When you wake up at 4 a.m. and can’t sleep, you
can log in and talk to another insomniac. You can also remain
anonymous if you want, and can ask questions that you may not
feel comfortable asking your best friends!
Just remember that the people you’re chatting with aren’t experts
and may have outdated or just plain wrong information! You don’t
know exactly who you’re talking to, so if you have any questions
about what someone says in a chatroom, consult your doctor. One
problem with the Internet is that people can easily sound like an
“expert” when they’re not, or to pretend to be someone — like a
nurse or a physician — when they’re not.
Reading Books
If you’re a reader, you’re in luck! Although we obviously think this
book is a great resource for osteoporosis, many other books on
osteoporosis are available. In addition, books, such as Fitness Over
40 For Dummies by Betsy Nagelsen McCormack and Mike Yorkey
and Weight Training For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Liz Neporent and
Suzanne Schlosberg (both by Wiley), can help you put your new-
found intentions to exercise your way to better bones to good use.
Watching Videos
Are you not the type who likes to read books (except this book, of
course)? You can choose from numerous videotapes, such as
Exercise: A Video from the National Institute on Aging, a 48-minute
video. It comes with a companion booklet. You can find more infor-
mation at www.niapublications.org/exercisevideo/
index.asp.

Talking with Your Doctor 
about Osteoporosis
Don’t overlook your doctor as a source of up-to-date information
on the latest drugs and studies related to osteoporosis. Most doc-
tors receive at least one journal a month filled with the latest med-
ical advances.
Although most doctors aren’t willing to have you call them up just
to chat about what’s new in osteoporosis, they often will call you
back if you have specific questions about something you’ve seen
or read about.
Visiting Your Favorite 
Physical Therapist
Physical therapists are important health professionals with master’s
degrees who are specially trained to give you an individualized
exercise program that strengthens your bones. They conduct a
complete evaluation to understand exactly what your needs are,
determine if you have any weak areas that need to be protected,
and design a program just for you. Then they monitor your progress
and determine if the exercises need to be changed. Usually your
primary care doctor, rheumatologist, or orthopedic surgeon will
know the most qualified physical therapists in your area.
For additional information, contact the Association of Rheumatology
Health Professionals, 1800 Century Place, Suite 250, Atlanta, GA
30345; phone 404-633-3777.
Going Online for the 
Latest Information
The Internet is a wonderful source of information, but keep in mind
that some of the information may be rumor, wishful thinking, or
just plain out-to-lunch thinking. Just remember that with the
Internet, everyone can play — and some Web sites contain incorrect
or inflammatory information that they pass off as the hidden —
usually “government-suppressed” — truth.
Chapter 17: Ten Resources for More about Osteoporosis 241

To find more information on osteoporosis than you could read in a
year, just go to your favorite search engine and type in “osteoporo-
sis.” Approximately 4 million sites will appear, although in all hon-
esty, many of them are duplicates of the same information. You’ll
still have plenty of reading material to keep you busy for a long,
long time. Drug companies developing medications that prevent
and treat osteoporosis often have educational material that is
available on the Web. (Okay, so these sites aren’t exactly an unbi-
ased source of information, because the drug companies are natu-
rally promoting their own drugs, but these sites are still a valuable
resource on the available drugs.)
Check out the following Web sites if you’re itching for more infor-
mation on osteoporosis.
 www.medscape.com and www.medlineplus.com provide
some of the latest articles on osteoporosis published in med-
ical journals.
 Merck’s www.fosamax.com, Procter & Gamble Pharma-
ceutical’s site www.fightfractures.com, and Eli Lilly’s
www.forteo.com offer information about these three drug
company’s specific osteoporosis drugs.
 www.rheumatology.org/public/factsheets is the Web site
for the American College of Rheumatology, the professional
organization of rheumatologists. (Rheumatologists are qualified
by additional training and experience in the diagnosis and
treatment of arthritis and other diseases of the joints, muscles,
and bones.) The site has information sheets regarding osteo-
porosis and corticosteroids-related osteoporosis. You can also
use this site to locate a rheumatologist in your neighborhood.

Chapter 18
Top Ten Questions Dr.
O’Connor’s Patients Ask
about Osteoporosis 
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what real people really want to know about osteoporosis
 Finding out what you need to know
N
o question is too silly or unimportant to ask. In this chapter,
Dr. O’Connor answers the questions she hears most com-
monly. We suspect that you may have thought of the same ques-
tions at one time or another. We also include a chapter reference
for you if you want more than just the short answer!
What’s the Best Type 
of Calcium for Me?
Answer: The cheapest!
Seriously, the most easily absorbed form of calcium is calcium cit-
rate, but the most important consideration about calcium intake is
to take enough. Don’t worry so much about the type of calcium.
Instead, find the least expensive kind. (See Chapter 11 for more on
calcium supplements.)

How Much Calcium 
Do I Need Each Day?
Answer: It varies with your age.
Because your ability to absorb calcium decreases with age, you
need more calcium when you’re older than 55. I generally recom-
mend 1,500 mg daily for that age group. (See Chapter 5 for more
info on different age groups.)
I Drink Plenty of Milk. Isn’t That
Enough Calcium for My Bones?
Answer: Yes, but only if you really do drink a lot of milk.
One cup of unfortified milk supplies 300 mg of calcium. Therefore
you need at least four cups of milk every day if you’re older than
55. Drinking milk is a fabulous way to get calcium in your diet.
Calcium from food is more easily absorbed than calcium from sup-
plementation. (See Chapters 5 and 11 for more on calcium.)
What Exercises Are Best for
Preventing Osteoporosis?
Answer: The general rule is 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise
(such as walking and stair climbing) daily. See Chapter 6 for a more
complete exercise program.
Before you start any exercise program, consult your physician.
What’s the Difference between
Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis?
Answer: They’re completely different problems.
Osteoporosis is the most common cause of fragile bones, while
osteoarthritis is a problem with your joints (such as your knees or
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
244

hips). Osteoarthritis causes pain in your joints at an early stage,
whereas osteoporosis is painless at an early stage. (See Chapter 1
for more on osteoarthritis.)
My Back Hurts. Is That 
My Osteoporosis? 
Answer: No, fragile, osteoporotic bones don’t hurt!
The only time you’ll have pain with osteoporosis is after a fracture.
(See Chapters 7 and 13 for more on vertebral compression frac-
tures.) If your back hurts, don’t blame it on your low bone density.
See your physician!
What Else Can I Do to 
Improve Bone Strength?
Answer: Stop smoking, limit alcohol intake, and make sure that
you have a minimum of 800 International Units (IU) of vitamin D
daily. (See Chapter 3 for more on risk factors for osteoporosis.)
My Family Doc Recommended 
a Bone Density Study. How Is 
It Done?
Answer: No preparation is necessary other than not taking your
calcium tablets for 24 hours prior to the test. The density of your
left hip and lower spine are measured with a specialized X-ray.
There is no injection or pain. This simple test takes 15 or 20 min-
utes, and the amount of radiation received is less than what you
would get from a standard chest X-ray.
(See Chapter 9 for more on testing your bone density.)
Chapter 18: Top Ten Questions Dr. O’Connor’s Patients Ask 245

Which Is Better, Alendronate 
or Risedronate?
Answer: Research has shown that both prevent osteoporotic 
fractures.
To my knowledge, no head-to-head studies have compared these
drugs with each other. (See Chapter 10 for more on different osteo-
porosis medications.)
I’ve Had a Curved Spine Since 
My Teenage Years. Do I Have
Osteoporosis?
Answer: Probably not.
When your parents insisted that you weren’t standing up straight,
you may have had a curvature of your spine known as scoliosis.
This condition has nothing to do with osteoporosis, other than the
fact that both scoliosis and osteoporosis cause loss of height. (See
Chapter 1 for more on differentiation between these two diseases.)

Chapter 19
Ten (Or So) Parenting Tips 
to Build Strong Bones
In This Chapter
 Preventing osteoporosis in the next generation
 Instilling healthy habits in your children (and grandchildren)
M
ost parents (and grandparents) want to do everything they
can to ensure their children (and grandchildren) grow up
healthy and lead long lives. That includes helping them develop
strong bones. (You do want Little Emma and Ethan to grow up big
and strong, right?) Remember that bone health in adults depends
upon critical factors in childhood.
In this chapter, we give you ten (or so) things you need to know as
a parent (and as a grandparent) to lower your children’s (and
grandchildren’s) risk of developing osteoporosis.
The More You Exercise, the
Stronger Your Bones Will Be
Children need to be active starting from toddler ages to teenage
years. Don’t let your kids (and grandkids) become couch potatoes
or computer addicts! The more weight-bearing activity, such as
running and walking, that they do during the growing years, the
better their bones will be later.
Better yet, get out there and play a game of softball or Frisbee or
take a bike ride with them, and the entire family will have healthier
bones. (Check out Chapter 6 for more information on exercise.)

Drinking Milk Daily Builds 
Big Benefits for Bones
Just four glasses of milk each day — one with each meal and one
for a snack — gives you enough calcium and vitamin D for your
bones to develop properly. Calcium requirements increase during
adolescence and teenage years, at the very ages when kids may be
least likely to eat well and drink enough milk.
The daily requirement for calcium at age 9 to 18 is 1,300 mg 
a day. Check out Chapter 5 for ways to increase calcium intake
painlessly, and Chapter 15 for some great ways to get calcium if
your child is allergic to milk.
Shopping Wisely Is 
Worth the Extra Time
When you shop for your family, read food labels to check for the
calcium and vitamin D content in the foods you buy. The extra time
it takes to check for calcium and vitamin D can pay off in better
bones for you all. For example, soymilk now states, “fortified” on
the carton, which means that vitamin D has been added.
Don’t Let Lactose Intolerance 
Rob Your Child of Calcium
Does your child (or grandchild) suffer from lactose intolerance?
Lactose intolerance means that they can’t break down and use lac-
tose, the main sugar found in milk and other dairy products. The
symptoms include bloating, lower abdominal pains, and loose
stools after drinking milk. As time goes by, people who are lactose
intolerant often drink less milk to avoid the symptoms, which is
definitely not what you want for your child.
Dr. O’Connor had a small victory while she was working on this
book. Her son, who is lactose intolerant, was home from college.
She was working on the chapter about nutrition, and she encour-
aged him to read labels for the calcium and vitamin D amounts.
That evening for dinner he had a large glass of soymilk. Better yet,
she reports that her house now doesn’t have any soft drinks. (See
the next section for more info on soft drinks.)
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
248

If your child can’t drink milk because of lactose intolerance, then
supplement with calcium tablets or soymilk. Check out Chapter 5
for ideas on ways to maintain an adequate calcium intake if your
child (or grandchild) is lactose intolerant.
Avoid Carbonated Beverages
Although an occasional soft drink is fine, don’t let soda take the
place of milk in your children’s diet. Carbonated drinks contain
phosphoric acid, which can cause calcium loss in your child’s
bones. A better alternative is to replace the soft drinks with milk
and calcium-fortified juices.
Watch for Signs of Anorexia
If your child (or grandchild) is severely underweight, you need 
to keep an eye open for the warning signals of anorexia nervosa.
Anorexia is a serious psychiatric disorder where people have a 
distorted body image and where they’re intensely afraid to gain
weight or become fat, even though they’re underweight.
Also keep your eyes open in case your teenage daughter (or grand-
daughter) has erratic menstrual cycles. If you notice any of these
symptoms, consult your physician as soon as possible, before the
problem has time to become more serious. (See Chapter 4 for more
about anorexia nervosa.)
When someone is anorexic, they’re typically not eating well or
taking in the necessary calcium and vitamin D. As a result, the con-
dition has long-term consequences on bone health.
Know Your Family History
Heredity is extremely important in understanding one’s risk for
developing osteoporosis. Let your children (and grandchildren)
know if someone in your family has osteoporosis so that they can
carry that information with them into the future.
If your children (or grandchildren) know that their great-grandma
on mom’s side and their dad’s mom each suffered from osteoporo-
sis, they may think again before they skip their daily calcium
intake. Then again, you may have to remind them.
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Parenting Tips to Build Strong Bones 249

Set an Example about 
Eating Healthy
Yes, children watch and emulate their parents and even their
grandparents, even though at times it seems that they do the exact
opposite! Little eyes are watching — if your breakfast consists of
coffee and a donut, what will your children consider good nutrition
as they grow up? Make a decision to include calcium-rich and vita-
min D–fortified foods to all your meals. (For instance, skip the
donut and eat a cup of yogurt.)
How much better — for all of you — if your diet choices show that
eating well is important to you. Children really do pay more atten-
tion to what parents do than to what they say!
Help Your Teen Avoid 
Cigarettes and Alcohol
Talking to your kids about the risks of smoking and drinking is an
important way to prevent your children from picking up either as a
bad habit. Smoking and drinking not only have detrimental effects
on your bone health, but on so many other parts of your body.
(And don’t forget that smoking is an expensive, dirty habit.)
Although peer pressure is strong, parents really do have an equally
strong influence on their kids. Make sure your offspring know
where you stand — and of course, set the proper example.

Appendix
Reviewing Osteoporosis
Programs State by State
In This Appendix
 Checking out your state’s osteoporosis legislation
 Finding state programs that may benefit you
A
s you may remember from history, states don’t always see
eye to eye. This statement is evident when you check out
each of the 50 states and their laws and programs related to osteo-
porosis. Some have great insurance coverage and wonderful edu-
cational programs, while some have nothing.
In this appendix, we give you a state-by-state review so you can see
how your state stacks up to others about putting the spotlight on
osteoporosis. If your state has no programs for osteoporosis detec-
tion or prevention, call your representative and ask why!
Alabama
In 1995, Alabama created the Osteoporosis Prevention and Treat-
ment Education Act to increase public awareness of osteoporosis
and educate the public about the causes, risk factors, prevention,
and treatment options. Check out www.adph.org/NUTRITION/
default.asp?DeptId=115&TemplateId=2022& TemplateNbr=0
for more information.
Alaska

Pennsylvania
The Pennsylvania Osteoporosis Strategic Plan, released in
September 2004, intends to reduce the burden of osteoporosis by
focusing on educating its citizens on the three ages and stages
important to prevention of osteoporosis: the Bone Building Years
(0 to 30), the Bone Maintenance Years (30 to 50), and the Bone
Loss Years (50 and older). A risk assessment of the general popula-
tion based on age, race, gender, and geographical areas can help
reduce the impact of the disease on different stages of life, because
evidence shows that education started in adolescence and contin-
ued throughout the different stages of life helps improve healthy
outcomes.
The Pennsylvania Osteoporosis Prevention and Education Strategic
Plan was a result of the collaboration between the Department of

Glossary
R
eading a book about a medical condition can be challenging
at times. You often come across terms that seem to reside in a
different country, and perhaps even a different planet. We want to
ease any confusion you may have by simplifying those terms in
this glossary so you aren’t left scratching your head and wondering
which side is up. Whether you’re reading this book or other infor-
mation about osteoporosis, this section is a short but helpful dic-
tionary that pulls most of the medical terms in Osteoporosis For
Dummies together.
Note: Any word printed in italic and bold type has its own defini-
tion in its own rightful alphabetical place in this glossary.
Adult rickets: See osteomalacia.
Alendronate (Fosamax): A bisphosphonate drug used in the treat-
ment of osteoporosis to increase bone mass.
Anorexia nervosa: Excessive fear of being overweight, which
results in inadequate food intake.
Baseline measurement: A test or measurement taken before any
treatment is begun.
Bisphosphonates: The newest group of medications that improve
bone density. Bisphosphonates work to build bone by slowing the
removal of bone while allowing more bone to be formed. See alen-
dronate, pamidronate, risedronate and ibandronate sodium.
Body Mass Index (BMI): A measure of body size that takes into
account both height and weight.
Bone: Living, growing tissue made mostly of collagen, a protein
that provides a soft framework, and calcium, a mineral that adds
strength and hardens the framework. The combination of collagen
and calcium makes bone strong yet flexible enough to stand up to
the abuse you heap on your skeleton every day.
Bone densitometry: A test to detect low bone density. The most
common bone density test is called Dual Energy X-ray
Absorptiometry (DXA test).

Bone mass: The total amount of bone tissue in the skeleton.
Bone mineral density: The volume of calcium and minerals within
the bone tissue; a measurement of bone strength.
Burst fracture: A fracture of the vertebrae that extends through
the entire vertebral body. See vertebral compression fracture.
Calcitonin: A hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. Calcitonin
can help slow bone removal, which improves bone mineral den-
sity. It can also help relieve pain associated with fractures. It’s
available as a medication in two forms: injection or nasal spray.
Calcium: The most abundant mineral in the human body and most
important for preventing and treating osteoporosis.
Celiac disease: Also called nontropical sprue. An inherited intes-
tinal disorder that results in an inability to tolerate gluten, a natural
protein commonly found in many grains, including wheat, barley,
rye, and oats.
Collagen: A protein fiber that comprises a large part of connective
tissue (skin and tendons) and bone.
Colles’ fracture: A wrist fracture.
Compact bone: See cortical bone.
Cortical bone: Also called compact bone. The dense outer cover-
ing of bone that surrounds trabecular bone. Found mainly in the
appendages.
Corticosteroids: Hormonal steroid substances secreted from the
adrenal glands; also a type of steroid drug often used for asthma
and rheumatoid arthritis.
Diphosphonates: See bisphosphonates.
Diuretic: A medication or substance that increases urination.
Dowager’s hump: An abnormal outward curvature of the upper
back with round shoulders and stooped posture caused by bone
loss and compression of the vertebrae in the spine in osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis For Dummies 
264

DXA test: The gold standard test for measuring bone density, DXA
is an abbreviation for Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, a test to
evaluate your bone mineral density. DXA uses a very small amount
of X-ray to measure bone mass at clinically relevant sites on the
body, usually the hip or lumbar spine. The DXA takes only a few
minutes to complete and is noninvasive. Doctors use it to diagnose
osteoporosis very early before fractures occur.
Elemental calcium: The amount of usable calcium in a calcium
supplement.
Endocrine glands: Glands that secrete hormones into the blood.
Esophagitis: Irritation or inflammation of the esophagus, the tube
that leads from the back of the mouth to the stomach.
Estrogen: A sex hormone that stimulates the development of
female secondary sex characteristics. Estrogen levels decline in
menopause.
Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT): Drugs given to replace the
hormones made by the ovaries before menopause. ERT is a very
effective prevention for osteoporosis after menopause.
Etidronate: A bisphosphonate drug used to increase bone mass.
Used in combination with calcium carbonate in Didronal PMO.
Femoral neck: A part of the hipbone that connects the ball of the
hip to the long shaft of the thigh bone (femur).
Femur: The thigh bone; the largest bone in the human body.
Fragility fracture: A bone that breaks with minimal or no trauma.
Greater trochanter: Area of bone found at the top part of the femur.
Hemiathroplasty: A partial hip replacement.
Hydroxyapatite: The chief structural component of bone, com-
posed primarily of calcium phosphate crystals.
Hypercalcemia: High levels of blood calcium.
Hyperparathyroidism: Excessive production of parathyroid hor-
mone (PTH) disrupting the regulation of calcium. As a result, cal-
cium is taken from the bones, blood levels of calcium rise, and
increased amounts of calcium may be excreted in urine.
Glossary 265

Hypogonadism: A decrease in activity of the male/female sex
organs resulting in decreased hormone production.
Ibandronate sodium (Boniva): A bisphosphonate taken once a
month to reduce bone loss from osteoporosis.
Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis: A rare condition where children
develop osteoporosis for no known reason.
Inflammatory bowel disease: Inflammation in the small or large
intestine.
Kyphoplasty: A treatment for vertebral compression fractures. A
“balloon” is injected into the space between the vertebrae through
a catheter. The balloon is then inflated and filled with an orthope-
dic cement that hardens in place. This helps return the vertebral
space to its original height.
Kyphosis: See dowager’s hump.
Lordosis: Curvature in the lower spine.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): A machine that uses mag-
netic forces to obtain detailed images of the body.
Malabsorption: The inability to take in adequate amounts of nutri-
ents from the intestinal tract; some forms of malabsorption can
cause osteoporosis.
Menopause: The period of natural cessation of menstruation nor-
mally occurring between the ages of 45 and 50.
Nontropical sprue: See celiac disease.
Osteoblasts: Cells that form bone.
Osteocalcin: Protein synthesized in bone by active osteoblasts.
Osteoclasts: Cells that break down bone.
Osteocytes: Cells that help maintain bone.
Osteogenesis: The formation of bone in connective tissue or 
cartilage.
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI): A genetic disorder characterized by
brittle bones that break very easily.
Osteoporosis For Dummies 
266

Osteomalacia: A softening of the bones as a result of vitamin D
deficiency. Also known as adult rickets.
Osteopenia: A mild decrease in bone mineral density.
Osteoporosis: A decrease in bone mass. As the bones become
weaker, they become easier to fracture or break. Men as well as
women suffer from osteoporosis, a disease that can be prevented
and treated.
Osteoprotegerin (OPG): A protein found naturally in the body that
reduces the production of osteoclasts; currently under investiga-
tion as a potential osteoporosis treatment.
Pamidronate (Aredia): A bisphosphonate drug currently under
investigation for use with osteoporosis.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH): A hormone under investigation as a
treatment for osteoporosis; prevents the level of blood calcium
from going too low. Also can stimulate the breakdown of bone.
When given intermittently, it can increase bone mass.
Parathyroid hormone or parathomone (PTH): A hormone
secreted by the parathyroid gland and associated with calcium uti-
lization in the body.
Peak bone mass: The maximum amount of bone achieved during
the years of skeletal growth.
Periosteum: The fibrous membrane covering the outside of bone.
Phosphorus: A mineral active in bone and tissue growth.
Phytoestrogens: An estrogen-like substance found in plants.
Progesterone: A steroid hormone secreted by the ovaries.
Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT): A test used to meas-
ure true bone mineral density.
Raloxifene (Evista): A drug that prevents bone loss; raloxifene is
from a new class of drugs called Selective Estrogen Receptor
Modulators (SERMs).
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): A U.S. reference for
daily nutrient requirements.
Glossary 267

Remodeling: The process of replacing old bone with new bone
through the action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.
Resistance-type exercises: Exercises where muscle is acting
against resistance, such as weight lifting.
Resorption: The breakdown and assimilation of bone through the
action of osteoclasts.
Rickets: A childhood disease resulting in soft, weak bones, caused
by lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate.
Risedronate (Actonel): A bisphosphonate for the prevention and
treatment of osteoporosis.
Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs): Drugs used to
prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. SERMs act like
estrogen in some tissues, and block the effects of estrogen in
others, which is why they’re called “selective.”
Spongy bone: See trabecular bone.
Standard Deviation (SD): A consistent unit of measure above or
below the average of a comparison group.
Strontium ranelate (Protelos): Strontium ranelate stimulates the
formation of new bone tissue and decreases bone loss; available in
Europe for treatment of osteoporosis.
T-Score: Osteoporosis experts consider normal bone density to be
that of a normal, young adult. In the DXA test, this measurement is
called a normal “T-score.” A T-score of –1.0 or higher is in the normal
range. A score between –1.0 and –2.0 means that your bone density
is borderline for osteoporosis (osteopenia). A T-score of –2.0 or
lower qualifies as osteoporosis.
Teriparatide (rhPTH) (Forteo): A recombinant (manmade) form of
the active part of parathyroid hormone. Used to treat osteoporosis
by increasing bone mass and strength.
Testosterone: The major male sex hormone.
Thyroid gland: Part of the endocrine system, found at the front of
the neck. Secretes hormones that are important for normal body
growth and metabolism.
Osteoporosis For Dummies 
268

Tibolone (Livial): A synthetic steroid that mimics the activity of
estrogen and progesterone (female sex hormones) in the body.
Trabecular bone: Also called spongy bone, trabecular bone is a
honeycomblike structure of bony tissue.
Ultrasound: High frequency sound waves used to image internal
structures of the body.
Vertebrae: The bony segments of the spinal column.
Vertebral compression fracture: An injury to the spine in which
one or more vertebrae collapse. If the collapse is only in the front
part of the spine, it’s called a compression fracture or wedge frac-
ture. If the vertebral body is crushed in all directions, it’s called a
burst fracture.
Vertebroplasty: A procedure to treat compression fractures.
Orthopedic cement is injected into the space between the verte-
brae; as it hardens the vertebral space is restored to its original
height.
Vitamin D: Essential vitamin that allows the bones to absorb cal-
cium. Vitamin D allows calcium to leave the intestine and enter the
bloodstream.
Wedge fracture: A vertebral compression fracture occurring at
the front or the back of the vertebrae only; the collapse at one end
or the other of the vertebrae looks like a wedge.
Weight-bearing exercise: Exercise in which a person supports his
or her own body weight, such as walking.
Z-score: Measures standard deviations for a specific group. A 
Z-score from a DXA test compares a person to controls matched
for age, weight, gender, and race.
Zoledronic acid (Zometa): Used to treat hypercalcemia.
