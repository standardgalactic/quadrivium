URINARY SYSTEM -  
GENERAL STRUCTURE & 
FUNCTION 
Learning Objectives 
1. Describe the structure of the kidney. 
2. List the homeostatic functions of the kidney.  
3. Describe the structure of the kidney nephron. 
4. Explain the regional functions of the kidney tubule.    

ORGAN FUNCTIONS: 
•
Fluid balance 
•
Electrolyte balance 
•
Liquid waste removed   
•
Excretion of drugs 
•
Endocrine secretions:  
 
erythropoietin 
 
renin 
 
Vitamin D3 (calcitriol) 
KIDNEY STRUCTURE  
Ureter conducts urine to bladder 
Renal  
cortex 
Renal 
medulla 
Capsule 

NEPHRON STRUCTURE 
Million filtering units 
 
Tubule regions include: 
1. Bowman’s Capsule (start of tubule)  
surrounds glomerulus 
2. Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) 
3. Loop of Henle 
4. Distal convoluted tubule (DCT) 
5. Collecting Duct (CD) 
medulla 
cortex 

2 TYPES OF  
NEPHRONS 
medulla 
cortex 
Cortical  Nephron is 
the most common 
type in humans 
Juxtamedullary 
Nephron maintains  
hyperosmotic  
medullary gradient  

REGIONAL CHANGES IN 
VOLUME & OSMOLARITY   

REGIONAL FUNCTIONS 
Excretion (E) = Amt Filtered (F) - Amt Reabsorbed (R)+ Amt Secreted (S) 

1. Filtration is the movement of solutes and water  
from the blood into the lumen of the renal tubule to 
generate a filtrate.  
 
2. Reabsorption is the movement of solutes and water  
from the lumen of the renal tubule across the epithelial 
cells and back into the blood.  
 
3. Secretion is the movement of solutes directly from  
the blood across the epithelial cells and into the luminal 
filtrate.   
   
4. Excretion is the removal of solutes and water from  
the body as urine.  
IMPORTANT TERMS 

1. The kidneys’ primary functions are to maintain fluid 
volumes of the body by regulating salt balance and to 
maintain the osmolarity of the body by regulating water 
balance.  
2. Additional homeostatic functions include removal of 
wastes and detoxification of drugs. 
3. The kidney secretes hormones, including erythropoietin 
in response to hypoxia, renin in response to low blood  
pressure, and active Vitamin D3.   
4. The kidney contains a million filtration units, called 
nephrons.  Each nephron is fed by a portal system. 
5. Filtration occurs across the first capillary bed 
(glomerulus). Reabsorption and secretion occur along 
the renal tubule to alter the composition of the filtrate. 
The final product is urine which leaves the kidney by the 
ureter.
