Summary, -- In this paper we begin by developing in more detail the 
growing but largely implicit realization that Bell's theorem is, in essence, 
not a test for the existence of hidden variables but, rather, for whether 
or not the wave function of a many-body system tends to factorize into 
a product of localized states of its constituent particles. If such a process 
of spontaneous localization actually does take place, it cannot be treated 
in terms of SchredJnger's equation, but requires qualitatively new kinds 
of laws. A possible form of these laws is indicated briefly in our paper. 
We show further that such laws do not fit in with our customary notions 
of dynamical causality but are rather examples of a different kin~ of 
relationship that may be called formal causality. An analogy is given 
that helps to explain more fully what is meant by formal causality. 
We then present our proposals concerning the parameters cletermining 
the conclitions under which spontaneous localization will take place. 
We suggest that these are related, not to the coherence length, but 
rather #~o a critical time ~o= ?~/kT, in which a system large enough to 
have thermal properties will undergo a change in quantum state. From 
our suggestion it follows that, in experimental investigations carrie4 
out thus far, we have been looking for the process of spontaneous local- 
ization in the wrong place. Some indigations of what may be the right 
place to look for this process are given. Finally, we point out that the 
notion of spontaneous localization makes it unnecessary to give the 
measuring apparatus a fundamental role in the theory so that the 
measurement problem of c~nventional quantum mechanics disappears.

1. - Bell's theorem and its bearing on a new process of spontaneous localization. 
There has been a growing general realization (~) that Bell's theorem (6) 
has no essential relationship to hidden variables, but rather that it is mainly 
significant as a test for whether or not the laws of quantum mechanics have 
to be extended in certain new ways. At present the nature of this extension 
is largely implicit, but in this article we shall sketch at least its general outlines 
in ~ more explicit fashion. 
We begin by illustrating what is meant here in terms of the simple example 
of Furry's hypothesis (~.~) as applied to a molecule of total spin zero, consisting 
of two atoms of spin ?~/2 which are caused to separate by some means that does 
not involve the spin. The original wave function for the spin of the system 
of the two particles is 
(1) 
1 
~o = ~fi (~+(~.)~-(~)- y_(~.)~+(~.}), 
where ?~ is a unit vector in the z-direction and yJ+($~) represents a state of positive 
spin in the z-direction for particle 1, ~-($s) a state of negative spin in this direc- 
tion for particle 2, etc. In essence, the Furry hypothesis is the supposition that, 
as the atoms fly apart, there is a certain distance d depending on factors that 
are at present unknown, at which the original wave function ceases to apply 
to the system. Instead, a new state arises spontaneously which will be repre- 
sented by the product function 
(2) 
~, = ~+(~) ~_(~.), 
where r 
a unit vector in some new direction. Because the original state has 
no preferred orientation, it is reasonable to assume that the vector is distributed 
isotropically (i.e. with uniform probability for any direction). 
If the new distribution is averaged over the directions r then, as shown in 
the Appendix, Bell's inequality will be satisfied. But evidently, in this appli- 
cation, Bell's inequality has nothing to do with an average over hidden variables.

]~ather, the averaging is over spin dh'ections, which are just straightforward 
quantum-mc(;hanical w~riables. What is new here is, however, the implication 
of ~ localization process, in which an initially nonlocal state ~/]o becomes a prod- 
uct T~ of local states. Such a process evidently cannot be described by any 
wave function satisfying SchrSdinger's equation. And so, its law of develop- 
ment has to be something qualitatively dii~erent from the presently known 
laws of quantum theory. What is needed here is indeed a new kind of relation- 
ship determining the probability P(To, r 
that a given nonlocal state To of the 
combined system will spontaneously break into particular products ~+(g~) Y~-(r 
of local states in which the individual particles have spins that are well defined 
in the direction ~ (*). 
In some of the previous papers on the subject (7) it was indicated that ex- 
periments then available disagreed with such a possibility. However~ since 
then, the subject has advanced considerably and the development of new kinds 
of experiments has been stimulated by the consideration of Bell's theorem (s.g) 
so that the question has now to be re-examined. 
The density matrix has been commonly used as a basic form for expressing 
the laws of quantum mechanics. A clear presentation of the meaning of the 
suggested new law involving a process of spontaneous localization therefore 
requires an understanding of how this process may be related to the density 
matrix. To do this~ we first note that, for each individual system, the final 
localized state hr/~ will be represented by an idempotent density matrix~ corre- 
sponding to a product of pure states for each particle 
(3) 
We may now define an average density matrix by integration over the direc- 
tions r 
=fP(V'o, n) e(~) d~. 
(4) 
It can be readily verified that the conventional quantum-mechanical averages 
will be obtained correctly from ~. Thus, if 0 is any operator~ we have 
(5) 
6 = Tr (80). 
It is important to emphasize, however, that the actual ensemble of systems 
(') This is equivalent to the notion of a spontaneous change from ~r improper ~ to 
proper >> mixtures, as suggestecl by D'EsPAGNAT (s).

with product states ~, is not determined by @; i.e., if ~ is given, the actual 
ensemble is ambiguous. For example, the same density matrix ~ as that given 
by (4) will result from an ensemble in which all the particles come off with 
spins defined in the z-direction and for which the only possible final wave func- 
tions for the system are ~t~ = V+(z*)~0 ($,) and Wt~= V_(~x)V+($,) with equal 
probability for these two states. It is easily seen that both of these ensembles 
yield identical (and isotropic) results in all conventional quantum-mechanical 
applications. Yet they result from entirely different distributions of localized 
states. 
This means that, if we extend the laws of quantum mechanics to allow for 
a spontaneous localization process, the density matrix will not be enough to 
give a complete account of all physically significant aspects of the behaviour 
of a system. What is needed in addition is the actual probability distribution 
P(~o, r 
over the possible localized final states. 
In this new sort of theory we have to be careful to define what is meant by 
locality, and to distinguish this from other usages of the term. Thus, in quantum- 
mechanical field theory, if the fields at different points on a spacelike hyper- 
surface all commute (or anticommute), the field is said to be/oeal (otherwise 
nonlocal). However, in the context that we are now discussing, we should say 
that such a field is iDotentia//y localizable. That is it is in principle possible to 
have states which may be as localized as desired (described by products whose 
factors approach delta-functions). But more generally the actual wave function 
of the entire field is a nonlocal function of the field variables at different pla~s 
(of a kind similar to (1)). 
For the sake of clarity we repeat some of the well-known arguments in which 
the meaning of this notion is brought out in experiments of the type suggested 
by EINS~V.I~, ROSEN and PODOLSKY (,0.n). Thus, in the system consisting of 
two atoms of spin ~[2, with total spin zero, any component of the spin of the 
first atom may be measured by means of an apparatus which localizes the 
atom at the same time. It then follows from the usual quantum theory that 
the other atom has a definite spin in the opposite direction as well as a de- 
finitely different location. Without interaction in any of the usual senses~ the 
second atom seems to ~ know, instantly in which direction its spin has to be 
well defined, and in which directions its spin has to be not well defined. Thus 
it can be said that the measurement must, in some sense, actually produce 
suitably localized states that are properly correlated from an initial state that 
is not localized in this way at all. Any attempt to explain this result on the basis 
of a system consisting initially of localized constituents would require a non- 
localized interaction (e.g. instantaneous action at a distance) the very ex- 
istence of which is denied in the theory.

It is oft.en implied in the literature th'tt without hidden va.riables fbhe problem 
of nonlocality does not arise. Of course, if we wish to explain quantum me- 
chanics through hidden variables, we will ahnost certainly need nonlocal hidden 
variables (~-~). But as we have seen above, this is because quantum mechanics 
is nonloeM, and not because a hidden-variable explanation is being sought. 
So we have to understand nonlocMity as intrinsic to quantum mechanics, and 
we cannot avoid this by just refraining from the consideration of hidden va- 
riables. Moreover, as has been pointed out, Bell's theorem is primarily a cri- 
terion for whether or not this nonlocality is limited by a spontaneous process 
of localization, from which it follows that the satisfaction of Bell's inequality 
can in no way be taken as a proof of the existence of hidden variables. 
2. - Dynamical vs. formal causality. 
The idea of a quantum theory that involves nonlocality in an essential way 
and that is yet capable of a spontaneous process of localization does not fit 
into the conventional notions of dynamical causal law. 
Rather it implies a 
new notion that may be called /ormal causality. 
(This is a development of 
Aristotle's original ideas concerning formal cause.) 
In classical physics, the basic concept of causality is that of a sequential 
process, in which a cause at one time becomes an effect at a later time, while 
this in turn becomes the next cause of a yet later effect, etc. A law such as that 
of classical mechanics, which connects this cause-effect sequence at successive 
times, is a typical example of dynamical causality. When quantum mechanics 
was developed there was a general attempt to continue such a notion of caus- 
ality by treating the later form of the wave function as determined in terms of 
the earlier one through SehrSdinger's equation. 
But as is well known such a 
wave function cannot contain within it any description of a real sequence of 
events. 
To obtain this kind of sequence one has to have a nondynamical 
(~ collapse, of the wave function in each measurement process. 
Since this 
collapse ~) is entirely outside the framework of Schr6dinger's equation, con- 
sidered as a basic dynamical law, the whole meaning of such an attempt to 
regard the theory as an extension of classical dynamics becomes highly unclear. 
We propose instead that, in a pure quantum state, the wave function de- 
scribed is a Jorm and not a dynamical sequence. In physics, the notion that 
the form that a thing has may be regarded as a cause has been used extensively 
in recent times especially in connection with ideas of symmetry (e.g. one ap- 
peals to symmetry as an explanation of the properties of particles). We are

suggesting here that the quantum theory implies a much wider application of 
this mode of thinking than has been common thus far. 
To illustrate we shall make use of an analogy from music (~ 
Let us begin 
by considering a musical theme. The order of successive notes in such a theme 
evidently cannot be understood as dynamically determined. Rather~ the entire 
theme is a single whole form, which is perceived directly as such. One theme 
may then be followed by another, in a developing structure~ which in turn con- 
stitutes a higher-order form, and this sort of development can go on further 
to indefinitely higher levels. In this development~ the structures of themes are 
not to be identified with the notes~ written or actually played. Thus the written 
notes are merely a representation of the structure of themes and evidently not 
the structure itself. And it is only in the relationshi~ of th~ notes, as actually 
played~ that the structure exists (e.g. notes played a minute apart would be 
sensed as unrelated and not as part of a theme). 
What we suggest here is that the single particle is similar~ in some essential 
way, to a sequential structure of themes as described above. The development 
of themes in successive stages is then like a particle which is first in one quantum 
state and then in another, etc. As there is no dynamical causal relationship, 
determining the order of successive themes, so there is no dynamical cause 
of successive quantum states. Rather the whole order and form of the develop- 
ment is the cause. A particular solution of SchrSdinger's equation may be 
considered as a mathematical equivalent of a musical score describing a par- 
ticular theme. The development from one, theme, to another requires~ how- 
ever~ new mathematically expressed , scores ~ going beyond what can be put 
as a solution of SchrSdinger's equation. 
To understand this point more thoroughly we have to extend our analogy 
to the many-particle system. We compare the many-particle system to an 
orchestra (each particle to an instrument). When the whole orchestra is playing 
one theme all the instruments are related in an essential way (though each one 
may be following its own course of notes~ in general different from that of the 
others). We thus obtain an analogy to the nonlocal correlation implied by the 
many-body wave function (e.g. as described in connection with EPR-type 
situations). 
A new process can now be envisaged in which the orchestra playing together 
as a whole (i.e. in nonloeal relationship) begins suddenly, as part of the whole 
structure of the composition~ to break up so that each instrument plays in- 
dependently (i.e. solo) in a way that is not related to how the others are playing. 
This is our analogy for the spontaneous process of localization of states. 
(*) It may be desirable to try to find visual analogues as well, but these tend to favour 
dynamical explanations, at least at present, because a large part of the visual experience 
of which we are conscious has been such as to emphasize dynamically describable 
structures of objects.

Later some or all of lhe instruments could '~gain begin to play together, to 
produce a single new whole theme, .rod this in turn couht again break up into 
independent themes etc. If we extend the analogy to the quantum theory, 
this suggests that we have to consider a kind of (~inverse ~) of spontaneous 
localization, which could be called spontaneous /usion of localized states into 
a single whole nonlocalized state. So the overall movement would be determined 
as the result of the interplay of the two opposing tendencies towards localization 
and towards fusion. 
In the classical limit of such a theory the usual dynamical laws will have 
to emerge as an approximation. This implies firstly that for sufficiently massive 
systems with many degrees of freedom, and for sufficiently large intervals of 
time and space, nonloeal correlations tend to become unimportant so that the 
classical idea of systems composed of independently existent constituent parts 
will generally be a vahd simphfication. And secondly it implies that in con- 
texts indicated above there is a general statistical tendency to develop succes- 
sive ~ themes, in such a way that, at least in the long run and on the average, 
later sequences will be determined dynamically in terms of earher ones. 
We have thus come to a new conception of movement that is suitable for 
the quantum-mechanical context. In this conception there is no need to put 
the observer or the measurement process in a special role (e.g. as responsible 
for the ~ collapse ,> of the wave function or at least as essential for the description 
of this collapse). Our approach thus makes possible a description of the world 
as a total process, taking place independently of the observer. The observer 
or his measuring instrument may be included in this process. But as in clas- 
sical physics no measurement process has to be thought about to conceive of 
the existence of a movement. In this way measurement ceases to have the 
primary conceptual role that it is customarily given in the interpretation of the 
quantum mechanics. And so the measurement problem disappears. 
In the present quantum mechanics (i.e. without a spontaneous process of 
localization) there is no way to arrive at such a result. Thus if one begins with 
the density matrix, one may try to give the usual frequency interpretation, in 
an ensemble considered as objective and independent of the measurement pro- 
cess (~s). But as has been pointed out here the actual ensemble to be associated 
with a given density matrix is inherently ambiguous. In the usual quantum 
mechanics, the only way to remove this ambiguity is to introduce a measuring 
apparatus, which not only determines what the actual ensemble of states is 
but which actually creates this ensemble, 
l~or example, with the density 
matrix (4), the ensemble that is created may be of particles with spins well 
defined in the z-direction if the apparatus measures the spin in that direction. 
But the ensemble that is created will be of particles with spins well defined

in some other direction if the orientation of the apparatus is correspondingly 
altered. If the orientation of the apparatus is changed at random from one 
measurement to the next, one will obtain the Furry ensemble (with probability 
P(V'o, ~)). 
To sum up, in the usual quantum mechanics, the apparatus functions as 
a maerosystem which removes the ambiguity in the microscopic state and 
actually contributes in an unanalysable way to the determination of this state. 
This is, in essence, the meaning of what BOHR, HEISENBERO, etc. say about 
the subject. However~ in the view that we are now proposing 9 there is no am- 
biguity of this kind because there are definite laws in which the determination 
of an actual state is comprehended as the outcome of a process of spontaneous 
localization. 
3. - Thermal properties and the conditions for spontaneous localization. 
The further development of this general line of theory requires an under- 
standing of what determines the critical distance d at which a noulocalized state 
tends spontaneously to factorize into localized states. 
At present there are 
some speculations that this is related to the coherence length a~sociated with 
the wave function. Aside from calling attention to the arbitrariness of this 
suggestion, we have to point out that the existing experimental evidence (9) 
is generally against such an assumption (although there are two reports in its 
favour (1'.~)). 
We are ourselves considering another approach in which it is proposed 
that this distance d may be determined by a certain critical time ro associated 
with the temperature, which expresses the time needed for a system in thermal 
equilibrium to go from one quantum state to another. Our detailed proposals 
(along with our reasons for adopting them) will be published later but we shall 
here indicate briefly the general line of our thinking on this subject. 
A system in thermal equilibrium is commonly treated as being in a state 
of definite energy E with a probability P~ cxp [--E/kT] that this energy 
has a particular value E. We suggest, however, that a system in thermal equi- 
librium should be described by a time-dependent wave packet, rather than 
by a state of definite energy. This fits the fact that such thermal systems have 
observable fluctuations of their properties as functions of the time. We propose 
that an appropriate wave packet will have the form

where y,~(x,) is the cig(mfunction of tim }Iamiitoniall of the whole system, corre- 
sponding to energy E (the V~(x,) are assumed to bc an orthonornml set). 
It is readily verified that all time average properties a.rc the same with 
this wave function as they are for the ensemble of stationary states with 
P~ exp [-- E/kT]. To show this one may, for example, define a time average

And so we see that all conventional quantum-mechanical averages are the same 
as those obtained in the usual theory for a system in thermal equilibrium at 
temperature T. 
Let us now obtain an expression for the inner product of ~(x o t + ~) and 
~(x~, t). This is 
exp [

T0 is an estimate of the time for a system in thermal equilibrium to chang% 
in the sense that a given vector in Hflbert space transforms into a different 
and orthogonal vector9 
Of course, all of the above discussion has been in terms of the usual quantum 
theory, in which there is no spontaneous process of localization. 
It seems 
reasonable~ however, to suppose that any process of spontaneous localization 
must be related to some change taking place in the original nonlocal state. It 
is clear that no significant change can take place in this state until the Hflbert

space vector is different from what it was initially. 
And, as has been seen, 
vo ~ t$/kT is an estimate of the minimum time for such a change. So the simplest 
assumption possible in this situation is that in a system large enough to give 
thermodynamic concepts a meaning~ the process of spontaneous localization 
occurs on the average in a time interval of the order of To = ~/kT. 
We may then picture a large-scale system in or near thermal equilibrium 
as continually breaking up at a rate proportional to l/re into relatively localized 
domains, which are continually recombining or fusing to produce some sort 
of steady state, domain structure ,~. The size of these domains will evidently 
depend in some way on re and on the relative rates of localization and fusion 
of states. 
This means that to study the process of localization we have to look at 
systems with enough degrees of freedom to have thermodynamie properties. 
Experiments done thus far have all been oriented in the opposite direction to 
systems having at most only a few degrees of freedom (~ 
Moreover even if we tried to give a meaning to temperature for systems with 
only a few degrees of freedom, we would have to note that experiments have 
generally aimed at defining the energy with as little fluctuation as possible, so 
that the effective ~ temperature ~> would be close to absolute zero. The critical 
time Vo would then be so long that it would be difficult to observe any process 
of localization that might be taking place. Indeed, it can be said that, from the 
point of view that we are suggesting here, the usual quantum theory is a frag- 
mentary abstraction or approximation holding only at or near the absolute 
zero of ~ temperature ~ and that the sort of experimental conditions designed 
to answer questions raised in this theory generally preclude the possibility of 
observing spontaneous localization. 
It is clear then that we have not been looking for spontaneous localization 
in the right place. What is the right place is not yet entirely clear. 
But it 
seems likely that a useful area to examine would be that of large-scale systems 
with quantum properties (e.g. superconductivity and superfluldity), for long- 
range quantum correlations are present in such systems. And yet it seems likely 
that the range of this correlation is limited by some sort of process related to 
thermal exchanges of energy. It appears then that a study of localized domain

Note added in precis. - An experiment due to I~APALIOLIO8 (16) WaS designed to 
consider a special form of hidden-variable theory and the results do not necessarily 
invalidate the point of view proposed hero. However, even with regard to hidden 
variables, the experiment is inconclusive because it was done using photons rather 
than particles. Quantum field theory would load us to question the identity of the 
photon as it passes through space and, in particular, as it passes through the analyscr, 
so that the conclusion drawn by PAPXLIOLIOS, which is based on the assumption of 
identity, may be entirely irrelevant. We will discuss these and further points in a 
future publication.

structures in such systems might yiehl a clue as to the exist(race of spontaneous 
localization processes. 
In experiments such as those of EPR the number of degrees of freedom and 
the effective temperature of the microsystem under investigation arc both so 
low that (in agreement with most observations) one would not expect spon- 
taneous localization. To undergo such localization, a microsystem has to com- 
bine with a larger system, having thermal properties. A special case of this 
is for the microsystem to combine with a (macroscopic) measuring apparatus. 
We must be careful here, however, not to imply that the microsystem interacts 
with the apparatus in some dynamical sense. Rather, the microsystem and the 
macrosystem fuse, to form an undivided whole. In our musical analogy we could 
say that the apparatus and the microsystem then make up a single larger 
orchestra ,. At a certain stage the whole orchestra then factorizes into (~ in- 
struments, playing independent themes (or at least into smaller independent 
orchestras). 
But of course our whole approach is such that we do not wish unduly to 
emphasize the measurement situation. This latter emphasis has been due to 
the fact that in the usual quantum mechanics there is, as has already been 
pointed out, no way to discuss, or even to think about, an actual process without 
bringing in the measuring apparatus. However, in our theory, the general mode 
of existence is taken to be in the process in which nonlocal states break up 
into local states, while the latter fuse again into nonloeal states. 
We mention the measuring apparatus here only to orient our theory in 
relationship to the actual historical context in which quantum mechanics 
developed. But from here on we no longer need to discuss the measuring ap- 
paratus in a central role. Rather our main interest is now to explore and de- 
velop the new laws of spontaneous localization and fusion of quantum states. 
APPENDIX 
In order to bring out clearly that systems satisfying Bell's inequality can 
be considered in terms of a probability distribution over products of localized 
states, regardless of whether these arise from hidden variables or from a 
spontaneous localization process of the kind suggested in this paper, let us 
consider the following argument. 
We let A, B, (7, D be a set of real numbers such that ]AI<I , IB[<I, IGl<], 
IDI<I. Consider the form 
AB -- AC, = AB[1 • DC] -- AG[1 -}- DB] . 
Then since 
W-QI< IPl+ IQI, 

464 
A. I~ARACCA, O. J. BOIIM, B. J. IIILF, Y ~n~l A. E. G. STVART 
it follows that 
[AB--ACI< lAB[1 ~ D(7]I + IA(7[1 • DB]I<[I =~ DC] + [1 ~ DB] . 
In the above we have used the fact that 
[1 -b DC]>0 
and 
[1 ~= DB]=0. 
It follows then that 
(A.1) 
IAB--A(TI<2 --I[DO ~- DBJI. 
We can see already that this general result has a form similar to that of Bell's 
inequality which, for a spin system, can be written as 
IP(a, b) -- P(a, v)l <2 -- lP(d, e) + _P(d, b)l , 
where P(a, b) is the correlation function for spin measurements in direction 
for particle 1 and in direction b for particle 2, etc. 
In order to establish the actual relationship between the two forms of ine- 
quality, consider a composite spin system for which the density matrix can 
be written as a local product form p ---- ~1 (~ Q~. In this case each correlation 
function is a product, such as 
P(a, b) = (0o ~)Ob) -~ (0.) (0~) -~ AB , 
.P(a, e) = (0~ (~0~) = (0~ (0,~ = AC , 
etc. 
where 0o is the spin operator in direction ~ etc., and where we have used the 
fact that (0o) is a real number~ such that I(0~)[<1 so that we can identify it 
with A, and so on. 
In the case of a spin system satisfying the Furry hypothesis, as discussed 
in the text of this article, the correlation function is obtained by averaging 
AB over all the directions r in which the spin may be well defined 
(A.2) 
P(a, b) =fda P(U'o, ~)A(C~)B(r 
. 
By carrying out a similar average of the forms leading to eq. (A.1) over direc- 
tions ~, we can readily show that P(a, b) as defined above actually satisfies 
BoWs inequality. Indeed, the calculation here is precisely the same as that 
needed in Bell's interpretation of the inequality (5), the only difference being 
that BELL defines the correlation as 
(A.3) 
PB(a, b) =fd2 ~(2)A(2)B(2), 
where 2 represents the hidden variables, and ~ their statistical distribution.

@ RIASSUNTO 
In questo lavoro si eomincia con lo sviluppare in maggiore dettaglio il riconoscimento, 
crescente ma in larga misura implicito, che il teorema di Bell, in sostanza, non ~ una 
prova dell'esistenza di variabili nascoste ma piuttosto del fatto chela funzione d'onda 
di un sistema di molti corpi tenda o meno a fattorizzarsi in un prodotto di stati loea- 
lizzati delle sue particelle costituenti. Se un tale proeesso di loealizzazione spontanea 
ha realmente luogo, esso non pub essere trattato in termini dell'equazione di SehrSdinger, 
ma riehiede leggi qualitativamente nuove. Si indica brevemente nel lavoro una forma 
possibile di queste leggi. Si mostra poi ehe queste leggi non si aecordano con le nostre 
nozioni abituali di causalit~ dinamica ma sono piuttosto esempi di un diverse ripe di 
relazioni ehe si possono ehiamare eausalit~ formale. Si d~ un'analogia ehe aiuta a spiegare 
meglio che eosa si intende per causalith formale. Si presentano poi le nostre proposte 
concernenti i parametri che determinano le eondizioni nelle quali la localizzazione 
spontanea ha luogo. Si suggerisce che queste siano legate, non alla lunghezza di coerenza, 
ma piuttosto ad un tempo eritieo T0= h/kT, durante il quale un sistema abba~tanza 
grande da avere propriet~ termiche subisce un cambiamento di state quantico. Dalla 
nostra ipotesi segue ehe, nelle ricerehe sperimentali eseguite finora, si ~ ricereato il 
processo di localizzazione spontanea nel posto sbagliato. Si danno alcune indicazioni di 
loealizzazione spontanea nel posto sbagliato. Si danno aleune indieazioni di quale pub 
essere il posto giusto per osservare questo processo. Infine, si sottolinea ehela nozione 
di loealizzazione spontanea rende superfluo assegnare all'apparato di misura un ruolo 
fondamentale nella teoria, cosiech6 il problema della misura della meccanica quantistica 
eonvenzionale scompare.
