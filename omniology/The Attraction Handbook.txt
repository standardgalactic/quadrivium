-Prologue- 
 
The world has changed. Over the last 200 years, there has been more evolution in 
human sexuality than in the 2000 years before that. With the advent of communication, 
contraceptives, and globalization, people have more choices available to them then ever 
before - and they're using it. 
 
The days of a woman placing her future on the altar and her marital bed are over. 
We've been replaced with ultimate choice - and with communication becoming cheaper 
and easier, people are turning to new mediums like never before. 
 
The rich are getting richer - sexually that is. Quality people want other quality peo-
ple. Quality women want quality men. 
 
This is a simple truth that many will buck. But if you can understand this: 
 
Quality women want quality men, 
 
Then, you can succeed. But what is a quality man, and how do you become one? 
This will be clear to you in about 100 pages. Get ready for what might be the most im-
portant reading of your life, because this tome is one of social skills, and the world is 
one of social interaction. Brace yourself.

-Dedication - 
 
 
“I cannot fathom how I could heap enough honors upon Vincent DiCarlo - 
my best friend, and a man of so much character, so much heart, and so much 
life. He is nothing short of a genius, and has been one of the ultimate inspira-
tions in my life. He brings a steady hand to my quick-draw approach, and I can 
only think that in the few years I've spent with him, I've made the growth of 
lifetimes. He is the stuff of legends, and Vincent, God bless you man, a person 
could not ask for a better friend in this world.”

Pirates. People who download products that are sold online. For Free. *gasp* 
 
The biggest knock against pirating isn't what happens to me. It's what happens to you. 
In this book, we'll cover what makes someone attracted to something - anything. It can easily 
be extrapolated... if you downloaded this instead of paying for it, it's likely you won't feel in-
clined and motivated to finish this book and apply it for many wonderful changes in your life. 
 
Know anyone that downloads tons of things for free? Music? Video games? Ebooks? I 
do. And these people rarely pay attention to any one thing, and get the value they could out 
of them. I know a guy who at a free talk I was giving mentioned he'd downloaded over 10,000 
ebooks - Whoa. I didn't know that many ebooks were out there. 
 
He hadn't read more than a few pages of most of them. They were doing him no good. 
 
So here's what I've got to say - This is my livelihood, and my fulltime job. Your purchase 
of this ebook supports research and development of new concepts in the social field, and 
we're making the world a better place. So - thank you for purchasing. 
 
If however, you're one of those scurvy net-pirates, here's what I've got to say. Do focus 
on this book, and use it to make your life better. Improve socially and become more happy. 
That's what I want for the world. 
 
Then go out and make a positive difference, actually learn and grow and change. Don't 
download this book and not read it. Then you're breaking the law and not even getting any-
thing out of it my man. Apply the concepts in this book diligently, read through it and refer 
to it. Make this your #1 reference, because it really is the best. 
 
Then remember to support the cause. It's what lets us continue to research and write in 
this field, and in doing so you'll feel more dedicated to your own success. People who pay for 
this book have exactly 317.25% more success than people who don't. Really.

“What is Attraction?” 
 
Many men do not what Attraction is. They are aware that the thing exists, and that some-
times they get attracted to certain girls, and sometimes girls get attracted to certain men - but as 
for causing attraction? Not a clue. 
 
Well, the word "Attraction" has different meanings, depending on the context. At theAp-
proach, when we talk about Attraction, we talk about one thing: 
 
Actionable Attraction 
 
Actionable Attraction is precise and practical. A girl is attracted when she has a burning 
desire to be with you. When a girl has a burning desire to be with you, then you can choose to 
have sex, choose to have a relationship, at your leisure. 
 
WHAT GENERATES ATTRACTION? 
 
Attraction is always a result of three things: 
 
Value 
Attainability 
Compliance 
 
We call this VAC for short. 
 
Value is something that fills a conscious or subconscious need. 
 
Attainability is the idea that you have a chance at something. 
 
Compliance is how much work you put into getting something.

theAttraction Handbook    
 
 
Value: Value is something that fills a conscious or subconscious need for a person. 
 
For example, when a man wants a car. 
 
Car's value: Consciously, it's transportation. Subconsciously, it's a show of status. 
 
Attainability: Attainability is the idea that you can have something. 
 
People do not want things they have no chance of having. 
 
Case in point: Attraction is not value-based. If it were, every man in the world would be 
seriously attracted to the idea of owning a yacht. Think about a yacht - It represents travel, free-
dom, luxury, status. It can be used for adventures and enjoyment. 
 
And yet, most men are not desiring a yacht. The reason is that a yacht is unattainable to 
most men - not realistically achievable. When something is unattainable to someone, the person 
will go into Auto-Rejection. This is where the person rejects the item automatically... but they're 
really rejecting themselves. 
 
So a man is valuable. He has many things in his life in order, communicates himself well, 
and is appealing to women. He is attainable to a woman he approaches and talks to, and con-
verses with her for 30 minutes. He's going on and on, and yet she's not attracted. Why? 
 
Compliance: Compliance is work or effort put into something. The more effort someone 
puts into something, the more they like and respect it. This is known as the Cost-Worth Concep-
tion. 
 
The more something costs, the more a person will rationalize it's worth.

Case in point: The carnival. If you've ever been to a carnival, or amusement park, you 
might have seen the games there. The games at a carnival are hard to win, expensive to play, 
and have pretty cheap stuffed animals as prizes to them. 
 
And yet, when someone wins? They feel ECSTATIC! They're so happy to have won, they 
pump their fist, and often will give the stuffed toy to a loved one as a show of devotion, or even 
put it on one of their shelves like a trophy! 
 
If this toy were given away for free on the streets as a promotion, would the person even 
take it? If one were forced upon them, what would they do with it? Likely throw it away. 
 
This is classical Cost-Worth. When the toy takes a significant amount of money, and some 
skill to win, the person has paid a significant cost, so they rationalize the toy is worth some-
thing. When it's free, the cost is 0 and so is the worth. 
 
This book is laid out for the most long-term readability, and long-term usability. You'll see a lot of 
linking around through the book, especially early on. That's because many of the sections that are neces-
sary baseline stuff for advancement get handled and then you can largely move on with your life. Read 
this more like a holy book and less like a novel and you'll be in great shape.

The #1 Mistake Guys Make: Thinking That Women Require A Lot to Have Sex 
 
Let's lay this to rest right now. Women like sex, have become sexually liberated, and there's 
far less consequences for promiscuity these days in the Western world. Not really all that long 
ago, you could get banished or executed for being promiscuous. Now, there's Nellie Furtado 
songs of that exact title. Women love sex - the reason such harsh penalties were put in in the 
first place was because women loved sex way too much, and would be fucking almost anything 
if there weren't repercussions to it. 
 
Harsh Truth #1: Most guys don't want to accept that, because that means there's something 
wrong with them. If women want to have sex, and will have sex with desirable men, that would 
mean they're not desirable. That hurts the ego - Thankfully, 99 out of 100 times, it's not you 
that's a problem - it's a couple snags in the road. It's not you, it's how you're acting... for a split 
second, at some point. We'll straighten you out. 
 
What it takes to start having some sex: 
 
Sex comes down to two things: Attraction and logistics. If a girl is firmly attracted to you - 
that's the Attraction part - and you're somewhere logistical feasible - that's the not getting ar-
rested and her friends not thinking she's a whore part - then you'll be having sex right quick. 
Let's get you into bed ASAP - here's what you need. 
 
You need base value: Once you get into an interaction with a woman, it's all on you player.  
 
You'll be able to use your masterful conversational skills, the advanced social arsenal you 
possess, and you'll be able to finesse and fly and grit and play and rock and roll. She'll see what 
an awesome guy you are, and you'll let her see that she has a shot at you, and then you can 
make her work really hard for you. She'll get invested, and think you're even more of a super-
stud, you'll reward her showing her that she does in fact have an awesome shot at you, and then 
you'll set the price for yourself and make her work to meet your standards.  
 
I don't ask for much personally - I like women to cook for me, clean my house, run errands, 
take me out to dinner, and occasionally take me out to a nice event like the theatre, the opera, or 
the museum. A nice gift or two, maybe some clothing once in a while - I'm really low mainte-
nance. Vincent is a bit more draconic with his standards - his  women fly him around the world 
for the pleasure of being with him.  
 
But, we are ahead of ourselves. You need base value first.

Once you get into conversation, you can use your myriad of social skills to attract, se-
duce, etc. 
 
The following chapters detail getting your base value down: 
 
*Nonverbal Image Projection 
*Fluidity in Motion 
*Situational Relevance 
*Focus 
 
Mastering those four skills will give you enough value to engage her in basic conversation. 
Here are ways to start conversation: 
 
Opening 
 
Opening - or initiating conversation - is an art unto itself. It is a difficult art to achieve su-
preme mastery in, but an easy art to become proficient enough for our purpose so far - getting 
sex when we want it, and relationships if we so choose. 
 
Opening confidently and clearly always has some value. 
 
The Second Biggest Mistake Most Guys Make: When they talk to women, they're cliché. 
 
You must be non-cliché in your openers. You can open with a compliment, a question, or 
even a simple greeting -  as long as it's not cliché. If you sound like everyone else, with a "Can I 
buy you a drink?", "It's crowded in here tonight", or a "What's up" the battle is already lost. Your 
way of speaking should be colorful and interesting. 
 
Situational Relevance 
 
The basis of all conversation is Situational Relevance. People expect others to be relevant 
conversationally to the situation at hand. Things that are irrelevant - or random - tend to go over 
poorly. And yet, many things can be SitRel if delivered properly. Many more than one would 
imagine.

-Focus- 
 
PRIMARY:  
 
Charge the venue! Charge the venue means raising the "fun level" of where you're at. It 
comprises three things: 
 
*Have fun 
*Socialize 
*Make others have fun 
 
Your goal is not to "hunt", or to "scout". You're not on a mission, selectively singling out 
beautiful women as your "targets" while ignoring the rest of the venue. What you're doing is 
charging the venue, making others have more fun as you socialize with them. 
 
To have fun yourself, do what you like to do to start the night. If you like to drink, having 
one or two drinks is fine. If you like to dance, dance. If you like to shoot pool, playing a round of 
8-Ball is okay. Then get out there and socialize. 
 
If you find yourself not having fun, do playful type openers, and start goofing off. Don't 
take it too seriously. Make sure you socialize. Make your end goal for others to have fun - Not to 
"score", or to "get laid", or even to get numbers. If you can have fun, socialize, and make others 
have fun you'll have an enjoyable result regardless of the results... and far more importantly, the 
kind of people who get results are the people who ARE having fun and socializing. 
 
Your primary focus of "Charge the Venue" should take up 50-65% of your effort.

SECONDARY:  
 
Make connections and see if people meet your standards. 
 
Your Secondary Focus is to make connections and see if others meet your standards. Make 
connections means find common ground and common interests. You see if people meet your 
standards - You're not trying to impress them, you're seeing if they're good enough for you. 
 
Secondary Focus should take up 25-30% of your effort. 
 
 
TERTIARY:  
 
VAC, Logistics, and everything else. 
 
The first time you'll consciously think about VAC is after you're already charging the venue 
(having fun, meeting people, helping others have fun), making connections with other people, 
and seeing if they're good people who would make good friends, lovers, etc. 
 
Then and ONLY then will you start thinking tactically. That's when you'll consciously apply 
VAC and try to work out logistics on how you're going to leave with the girl or what have you. 
 
 
SUMMING IT UP: 
 
If you do the math, there's only 5-25% of your effort to be had on Tertiary Focus. That 
means, on a good night where things are going well, having fun, charging the venue, making 
connections, and seeing if people meet your standards will be 95% of what you need to do. BUT 
even in a logistical nightmare, only 25% of your effort will go into dealing with logistics and 
other tactical details.

VERTIGO: 
 
The "Vertigo Effect" is when you're thinking incorrectly, and worrying - You'll actually 
make the things you worry about true. 
 
What Vertigo is in real life, is when the fluid in your ears is scrambled. You get dizzy, lose 
your balance. This can happen at high altitudes by looking down, especially if you're afraid of 
heights. 
 
What happens is a man is scared of heights, so he looks down. Because he looks down, he 
goes into vertigo, and winds up falling... If he didn't think about the height, if he wasn't scared 
of it, he wouldn't fall. 
 
This happens constantly in social situations. If you think "I need to impress this girl", you'll 
try to brag or buy her attention, which actually shows you're LOW value. Because you were 
afraid of appearing low value, you vertigoed it into happening. 
 
 
EXAMPLE: You're having a good conversation with a girl, and things are going well. Then 
you see her friends are looking for her. 
 
WRONG WAY: You see the friends are looking for her, and are afraid they'll drag her away. 
You try to take her away from them to another part of the club, or to leave, so you'd better get 
her away from them and either get her number or leave with her. 
 
WHAT HAPPENS: The friends see you sneaking, or the girl wonders why you're acting 
suspicious. When the friends catch eyes with each other, they'll see you were trying to hide from 
them and assume you're sketchy, and you'll get the boot. 
 
THE CORRECT WAY: If you'd told the girl to call her friends over with a big smile (having 
fun), then greeted them and started talking to them about fun stuff (socializing, making others 
have fun), made a connection with them, then found out if they're good people and if they'd 
make good friends for you if you wound up with the girl, then the friends would like you and 
wouldn't interfere. 
 
EXAMPLE: A random well-muscled guy approaches you and the girl you're talking to you. 
 
WRONG WAY: You immediately start trying to put him down, insult him, be rude him to 
him. 

 
 
16 
Copyright 2006 theApproach 
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook    
 
WHAT HAPPENS: He takes offense to it. If he already knows the girl, you're cooked. If he 
doesn't, you're getting into an unnecessary conflict. The girl will roll her eyes and walk away 
from the juvenile antics. Even if you win, it's a picric victory. Any girl that enjoys seeing a man 
put another man down and socially bully is not a quality girl (whereas even the girls the girls 
that do like would like you even more if you'd done it the correct way!) 
 
THE CORRECT WAY: Greet the guy, be friendly with him, laugh and joke around. If he 
asks how you know the girl, you can have fun with it (charging the venue) and say something 
like "She's my cousin amigo" or "We go way back to Jersey City in '96." What you say is less im-
portant than that you're having fun, but never the less you introduce yourself to the guy, per-
haps give him a quick sincere compliment (making a connection), and if he doesn't already 
deem you to be okay, you see if he meets your standards. The guy becomes your friend, and 
doesn't bother you - maybe even helps you later. 
 
 
WHY THIS WORKS: 
 
"Charging the Venue", your Primary Focus, is very good for your value. It shows you're 
confident, fun, and outgoing, and you share that with other people. Make Connections is good 
for Attainability, and See if People Meet Your Standards is good for Compliance. 
 
Going through Focus correctly begets VAC - Attraction. If you're correctly focused during 
your social outings, people will become attracted to you. Then it's on to Tertiary Focus, which is 
mostly just finding a bed ;) 
 
 
ALSO WORTH NOTING: 
 
If you have the correct focus, and you're truly into having fun and take legitimate enjoy-
ment out of others having fun, then you're never decreasing your power by socializing. Many 
men with the hunting/scouting mentality become less powerful as they get rejected through the 
night. Someone who is out to charge the venue, have fun, meet people, see that others have fun, 
make connections, and see if other people would be good in his life - those people are respected, 
liked, and admired. 
 
As the night goes on, if you've got the basic execution of socializing down and your focus is 
correct, you're becoming more powerful. More people are liking you, talking about you. You 
can go back and talk to anyone from early in the night easily.

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART ABOUT FOCUS 
 
The most important part about focus is this - It's very hard to go out and "suffer" way your 
way to results. It's doable, but your progress will be infinitely swifter and more likely if you're 
enjoying yourself when you're out.  
 
When you walk out of a nightclub at the end of the night, you should ask yourself if you 
had fun that night. If you did, it was a good night. The man that suffers all night trying to get 
laid, in short, does not get laid.  
 
If you can be having fun and socializing right up until the end, and then perfectly willing to 
leave alone and in a good mood - you won't be leaving alone all that often. Paradoxically and 
true, women want men that aren't hung up on getting laid. They want men who go out to enjoy 
themselves and be good to other people.

-The Five Types of Openers- 
 
There are exactly five ways to open that are situationally relevant. All good openers will 
fall into one of these categories. 
 
GENUINE INTEREST:  
 
Everyone appreciates sincere, genuine interest taken in them. Done in a non-cliché way, 
that's relevant to the current situation, a sincere compliment will regularly work to start conver-
sation. 
 
The two largest rules for Genuine Interest Openers, unsurprisingly, are first: 
 
You must be genuine. 
 
Complimenting a woman on a random trait, or randomly throwing out "I think you're beau-
tiful" to every woman you meet has a chance of causing you to seem insincere, or even that 
you're mocking her. Your Genuine Interest Openers should be something you really like about 
the woman. A good general rule is to pick either the trait about her that you noticed first, or the 
one you liked the best. 
 
If you see a woman you like, and the first thing you notice is she's got beautiful wavy hair 
that's done back an absolutely sheens, you could say, "I absolutely love your hair - It's shimmer-
ing in the light." If you noticed a woman and the first thing you saw was her hair, but after look-
ing at her further you noticed she's got a really great pair of high heels on, you might say, 
"Those heels look very dangerous - They're awesome." 
 
The non-cliché rule is in full-force on genuine interest openers. Do not feel obligated to find 
some article about the woman that's obscure that she's never been complimented on before. Peo-
ple know what the best things they have on are, and like certain pieces of clothing and jewelry, 
as well as certain features the best. It is absolutely critical that you're non-cliché in how you 
compliment. You should rarely if ever be saying, "I like your hair." Use interesting adjectives, 
really describe what you like about it and how you see it. Substitute generic, cliché words like 
"pretty" and "beautiful" for slightly more interesting ones like "gorgeous" and "stunning". 
 
 
One of the greatest openers in the world for women who are sitting in a cafe, bistro, or cof-
fee shop, is "Excuse me, is this seat taken?" If she says no, you sit down. If she says, "I thought 
you just wanted the chair..." you reply, "No, I thought you looked interesting and it'd be fun to 
meet you. I'm Sebastian." Actually, use your own name instead of Sebastian.

IMPLICIT:  
This is one of the most common forms of greeting in the social world, and yet it's often ma-
ligned by people studying social science. This is when you show implicitly that you're interested 
in the other person. "What's happening?" 
 
The reason this is often fails is because try the most cliché, over-beaten types of implicit di-
rect. "Hi", and "What's up?" DO NOT USE THOSE. But if you pick something interesting and 
different, you can run with it. "What's happening?" "What's good?" 
 
One of the greatest openers in the world for women who are sitting in a cafe, bistro, or cof-
fee shop, is "Excuse me, is this seat taken?" If she says no, you sit down. If she says, "I thought

meet you. I'm Sebastian." Actually, use your own name instead of Sebastian. 
 
SITUATIONAL:  
 
Making observations on the world around you is very powerful and interesting. 
 
It shows you're spontaneous and it never looks like a pickup attempt. If you work on your 
perception of the world around you, this is a very powerful class of opener. Again, you must be 
non-cliché, but it's not too hard here. 
 
Any time you see something interesting or crazy, you can simply do what's called the 
"nudge and point". In a bar, nightclub, or even the everyday world, a light "nudge" (either actu-
ally nudging, or better yet getting the person attention without touching them) and pointing at 
something interesting with a big smile. Huge tall guy wearing a top hat? Nudge and point. 
Midget on the dance floor grinding with a 6' tall girl? Nudge and point. 
 
Most places people go to socialize make an active effort to look interesting and different, to 
set their venue apart from the rest. Bar has a fish tank behind it? Nudge and point. Imitation 
helicopter hanging from the ceiling? Nudge and point. Verbals to go along with it are simple. A 
"That's crazy", or "Check that out" will do.  
 
You can go a bit further, and point out less-than-crazy things in an interesting way. I once 
noticed a blue chandelier in a nightclub I'd been in for a couple hours. I hadn't noticed it before 
then, which was odd. I nudged the near person, pointed up, and said, "That's crazy - I've been 
underneath this chandelier for two hours and hadn't noticed it and so it's so pretty. Wow." It, of 
course, opened.

INDIRECT:  
 
This is a class of opener where you are not interested in the other person yourself (or so it 
seems), but in something else about them. Women famously use, "Do you have a cigarette?" to 
begin talking to men they find interesting and attractive. Many variations of this exist, and one 
of the pioneers of codifying this school was one Neil Strauss, a rock critic for Rolling Stone. In 
"The Game", a semi-autobiographical work, Neil wrote about a number of his indirect openers, 
including: 
 
“Guy: Hey, I need a female opinion on something? Would you date a guy who was still friends with 
his ex-girlfriend?  Hmm. Actually, this is a two-part question. Imagine you were dating a guy who was 
still friends with his ex-girlfriend. And you were going to move in with him but he had a drawer with 
pictures of his ex-girlfriend – not nude pictures or anything, just regular pictures and some letters.” 
 
The thing many people overlook, even though it's on display in the book, is that Neil abso-
lutely loves social dynamics, particularly male/female social dynamics. It's... his thing. It's what 
he loves. If you do NOT love social dynamics, then you should not use any of Neil's social dy-
namic-based openers. And here is the reason - 
 
You absolutely MUST care about the answer to the opener you're using. In field-testing, a 
person using openers that aren't intriguing to them takes about six times longer to achieve a 
consistent 90% opening percentage than someone using openers they care about. The reason is 
that if you don't care, you'll be bored and that will be obvious. You'll need to learn fake manner-
isms of enthusiasm and pacing in your questions that would be automatic if you simply cared 
about the answer. 
 
In fact, it's better to use an opener you care about that's less intriguing, than one that's been 
proven as good that bores you personally. 
 
"Hey, quick take on something... if you bump into a mirror that's already broken, and an-
other piece of glass falls off it, how much bad luck do you get? ... Seven years seems kind of 
harsh. I'm thinking, like, two weeks." (Real field-tested opener that works.) 
 
"Hey, quick take on something... I just read in a magazine that chewing on ice is a sign of 
nervousness and un-sexy to women. And I was like, damn! I chew on ice... and I'm not a nerv-
ous person... What do you think? Chewing on ice - Unsexy?" (Also works. Very well, I might add.)

NONVERBAL/PLAYFUL:  
 
One of the most fun class of opener, you can often open with inane stuff just to have fun 
and have a laugh. On the verbal spectrum, a student coined, "It's SAUSAGE TIME!!!!" during an 
exercise. IST (It's Sausage Time) is not a good opener per se, but it'll get you feeling light-
hearted and having fun. 
 
There are some N/P openers that open very well. "Happy Birthday!" to a random girl who 
is having fun goes over very well. 1 in 4 women have had a birthday one month ago, in this 
month, or the next month, and a disproportionate amount of people out partying and having a 
lot of fun are on birthday parties. If the woman says, "It's not my birthday...?" You reply, "Oh... 
You were having so much fun, I could've sworn it was!" 
 
 
You're now interacting with her. It's time to get her to put in some work... a lot of men have a hard 
time with this. What they don't realize is that the first amount of work a woman needs to put in is very 
small - when she returns effort and puts energy into the interaction, she starts investing herself - and her 
time - in you.

Base Level Compliance: This compliance is necessary for all interactions - EVERY time a 
girl doesn't open, one of these things has gone wrong. Going down the list of base compliance 
will help you troubleshoot. If they're not even putting in this small effort, it's not going to work! 
 
1. Acknowledgement 
2. Listening 
3. Answering Questions 
4. Responding to Statements 
5. Active Contribution 
 
1. Acknowledgement: If the girl doesn't acknowledge you, you obviously can't open her. 
The obvious extrapolation is do not open a girl directly from behind - It'll often immediately 
spook the girl, and she'll have a poor automatic reaction. 
 
If you're having a hard time getting acknowledgement, work on your image and presence. 
If you're dressed like a generic guy, you might get passed over. A style well-suited to you will 
help you with this phase of opening. 
 
2. Listening: The girl must listen to what you have to say after acknowledging you. You 
need to carry a command presence with you, which means stand straight and tall with good 
body language, and make solid eye contact. 
 
Then, you must be LOUD enough to be heard. Especially in nighttime venues like bars and 
clubs, you'll need to raise that voice to a level where it can be heard. Get LOUD. 
 
3. Answering Questions: After the girl is listening to you, you'll open and go from there. 
The next smallest step in the progression is for her to answer questions. If she refuses to answer 
questions, you've either picked an opener that wasn't situationally relevant, your command 
presence has faltered, or your question wasn't SitRel. 
 
4. Responding to Statements: Any two-way conversation will ultimately involve people 
replying to each other's statements. A man says, "I was at the beach a couple days ago." The girl 
says, "Really? How was it?" That's a response to a statement, and is a step in the right direction. 
 
If the girl doesn't respond to a statement, ask a question, and once she answers, make an-
other statement. Repeat this pattern until she responds to statements. 
 
5. Active Contribution: This is when the girl actively chooses new subject threads, fills in 
blanks in the conversation, and asks you questions. This comes from getting the first four base levels of 
compliance, along with having value and attainability. Girls who are attracted actively contribute to con-
versations.

More on Base Level Compliance…. 
 
Base Level Compliance is necessary in all interactions, but doesn't necessary go in order. 
Sometimes a girl will go up to you and start talking to you - She's immediately actively contrib-
uting. If you go "past" a base level to a higher one, you're fine. Acknowledgement and listening 
are automatically built into the higher levels, and if the woman is actively contributing obvi-
ously she's going to answer questions you say. 
 
Base level value gets you base level compliance. Just by having a decent image and being 
clean and groomed, women will acknowledge you. By being fluid in your movements, and say-
ing appropriately tactful things that are relevant to the situation, she'll respond to you and start 
talking. 
 
You now have some value and some compliance.  
 
Now...

-Attainability- 
A girl will ask herself three questions: 
 
"Can a girl like me get a guy like him?" 
"Will he respect me as a friend?" 
"Is this for real?" 
 
If the girl can answer all these questions with a yes, then you will be attainable. 
 
"Can a girl like me get a guy like him?" 
 
This is where you show her that the type of girl she is can be happy and wind up with the 
type of guy you are. Sometimes, this is done for you - If you've ever traveled and ran into one of 
your countrymen in another nation, you understand how strong the bond can be just because 
you speak the same language and have a set of shared experiences. 
 
Frequently, a girl will wonder if she could really get a guy like you. If you're older than her, 
or younger than her, or a different ethnicity, or from a different country, or different socioeco-
nomic levels... she might wonder if she could really get you. If you'd like her type of girl, and if 
you two would be happy together. 
 
To answer this attainability question, you show her that her type of girls get along quite 
well with you. Ways to do that include: 
 
*Explicit social proof: If the girl sees you interacting well with other girls that are similar to 
her, it'll make her feel like her type of girl can get you. For example, if you're European gentle-
man in a bar in Louisiana - As girls sees you getting along well and having fun with other 
Southerners, she'll realize that a girl like her can get a guy like you. 
 
*Implicit social proof: You can mention in passing that you had a friend or ex-girlfriend of 
her exact type. You can ask where, "Where are you from?" When she answers, "China," you can 
say, "Oh yeah? Nihao." When she says, "Nihao, how did you know that?" You reply, "I had a 
girlfriend in college from Shanghai." This shows her that a girl like her - a Chinese girl - can get 
a guy like you. One Chinese girl already did! 
 
*Common interests: It's known to people far and wide that birds of a feather flock together. 
The key here is not to try to pretend like you have a common interest that you don't have - in-
stead, talk about a wide range of subjects and you will find common ground. Almost all people 
have something in common - the trick is finding it.

*Showing or telling her about a friend of yours that has a girl of the same type as her. If 
you're an Arabic gentleman, and you're getting to know a Caribbean girl, taking her out with 
one of your friends that has a Caribbean girlfriend will show her that she could be with you. 
 
*The most common way this criteria of attainability is fulfilled in the real world is by people 
meeting in a place where people are assumed to be compatible with each other automatically: A 
job, school, or a party. Doing your socializing in an area like that can and does mean built-in 
attainability, and it is one of the fastest ways to get there from here. That said, we like to hunt 
anywhere and everywhere, so we liberally use other techniques! 
 
"Will he respect me as a friend?" 
 
If a girl asks herself if you'll respect her as a friend, and decides the answer is yes - you're in 
great shape. This technique was actually originally developed from my best friend, Vin DiCarlo, 
chatting with a bisexual girlfriend of his. 
 
Now, when a lot of people say bisexual, they mean "will have threesomes if her boyfriend 
was there" - well, this girl would do that. Yes, she would. But this is not what we were are talk-
ing about here. 
 
What we are talking about her is a full-on, hardcore bisexual girl that would go out to night-
clubs by herself to look for girls to get down with. She was methodical and quite amazing at 
picking up and having fun with girls. When asked what she was doing, she would say, "I be-
come her friend." 
 
Oh, there's a lot more to it than that. But a lot of the most major concerns about having sex 
are taken care of if she believes you really respect her as a friend. If she knows you really, really 
respect her as a friend, she'll know you won't make her feel bad after sex, or get weird and not 
talk to her again. She knows you won't brag or boast and ruin her reputation. She knows you 
won't give her an STD or get her pregnant and take off. You respect her, like you do your 
friends, and you'd take care of her and care about her like you do your friends.

Some techniques for letting her know you respect her as a friend: 
 
Use the word friend outright repeatedly, such as: 
 
*You're such a good friend. 
*I'm glad we're becoming friends. 
*It's nice to make friends with such a cool girl. 
*Crazy place to make a new friend, huh? 
*You're really a great friend to me. 
 
Describe her as being a good friend to you: 
 
*I feel so comfortable around you. 
*I always feel calm around you. 
*You make me a better person. 
 
Respect as a friend is also about what you DON'T do. Try this test: Before doing something, 
ask yourself, "Would I do this if I were making a new friend?" 
 
So, here's an example. Let's say you're in Amsterdam, and you're a huge Real Madrid fan 
(it's a futbol team). You meet another guy who likes Real Madrid in a bar, and it's exciting to 
meet another fan. You chat with him for a while. Then, do you whip out your phone and says, 
"Give me your digits." 
 
No! That'd be weird. And yet, that's what so many men do when getting a girl's number. 
With your fellow Real Madrid fan, you'd say, "Wow, it's cool to meet another fan up here in 
Amsterdam. I know this great bar with amazing sangria roja and tapas that shows all the games 
- you should come out with my friends sometime and watch the game with us." The guy would 
say yes, and then you'd say, "Cool, you have a number I can reach you at?" 
 
That's a normal interaction. But many guys try to be too cool with women. Here's another 
question - Do you call your friends ONLY when you want to get together? No! Most people call 
their friends every once in a while to say hi, check in, or tell a funny story. Again, don't call 
women just to try to get them out on dates - call to chat and shoot the breeze sometimes. It'll 
show you respect her as a friend, because you're treating her as a friend.

"Is this for real?" 
 
Women rarely get cool, social guys coming to talk to them in an intelligent way. If you mas-
ter these social skills, you're going to seem like an aberration. It's going to be a strange, wonder-
ful experience when a girl and you strike up a conversation while waiting for the N or W train 
to Queens. 
 
So women will ask the question, "Is this for real?" They'll think, "Is he just a player? Is he 
playing a joke?" 
 
If you approach a girl that you do not find physically attractive at all, and tell her you think 
she's the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, she's not going to think you're being for real - 
and act accordingly. 
 
So, being genuine is good and helps. The other thing you'll see - as you get better, your 
mannerisms will get smoothed out, your conversation will become more solid, you'll dress 
yourself and groom better, and you'll be a much more attractive guy. The problem is, women 
doubt their eyes if they see their white knight come riding in absolutely perfectly. No one's per-
fect... right? 
 
"Is this for real?" is answered by legitimacy. You need to be genuine... and also not too 
smooth. Situational Relevance is of paramount importance, and then remember to seem 
"mortal" in your interactions. Stay away from talking about her eyes are like deep pools of shim-
mering moonlight. "Is this for real?" is answered by doing the right things as outlined in this 
book, especially being situationally relevant. If you refrain from ridiculous unSitRel gimmickry - 
even though such gimmickry can be fun - you'll be in good shape. 
 
THE GIRL IS NOW SIGNIFICANTLY ATTRACTED TO YOU 
 
Girl sees you've got some value in your life. You look pretty good, you move well, you 
speak well. She's started contributing and talking with you. You've shown her that she has a 
chance to be with you - she doesn't have you already, but she has a chance, and she's intrigued. 
 
She's now attracted enough that you can start getting more compliance from her - making 
her work for you. In the process of getting this compliance, this work, this effort, she'll see more 
of your value.

HAVING STANDARDS 
 
Standards are an easy way to get compliance and to let a woman see that you have value. 
Just by figuring out what you want from a woman and holding women to those standards will 
make them work. 
 
Screening questions are one way to test if a girl meets your standards. Screening questions 
were originally developed to "screen out" women who weren't of the caliber men wanted. That's 
not what they really did though. 
 
Women, like all people, are very malleable. So a man would ask, "I like ambitious people. 
Do you consider yourself to be ambitious?" 50% of women were not saying, "No, I am not ambi-
tious, so do not waste your time with me." No! If the woman liked the man, she'd answer in the 
affirmative - saying she's ambitious. 
 
It had a side effect though. People like to be consistent with what they say they are. So in 
fact, the woman would want to act and seem more ambitious around you if she said she was. 
The end result? You're modifying behavior. 
 
Consider this: You're a different person around your mother than you are around your 
grandfather than you are around your boss than you are around an employee than you are 
around your best friend. Women are the same! When screening, you're holding them up to your 
standards, and most women if they like you, will try to pass your screens. So a screening ques-
tion is good for compliance - it certainly gets them working. It also helps modify behavior. Some 
women who could absolutely never be what you're asking will answer that they're not. Then it's 
up to you if that trait is negotiable or not. 
 
Formats for screening questions: 
 
I like X. Are you X? 
Do you consider yourself to be X? 
Are you more X or Y? 
I see so many people who are Y, and that's not good. You're not Y, right? 
I can tell you're X, but are you also Y? 
 
 

 
 
29 
Copyright 2006 theApproach 
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook    
 
These are a general format - you can substitute in equivalent words, or rephrase how you 
like.  
 
Here's examples. 
 
I love nature. Are you a nature loving person? 
Do you consider yourself to be open to trying new things? 
Are you more into large scenes with tons of people, or getting together for a quiet evening 
with some friends. 
Oh man, you see all these people who get so caught up in working and have no time to 
play. That's not you, is it? 
I can tell you're really loyal. Do you get a lot of enjoyment out of giving too? 
 
Screening questions need to be Situationally Relevant. 
 
This is the foundation for VAC. You now have some value, attainability, and compliance. 
But Attraction does not equal sex by itself. If I had a nickel for every time a woman was at-
tracted to a man, and they didn't sleep together... I'd be staying in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel 
every night, and eating steak for every meal. 
 
Why is this? Attraction makes a woman have a burning desire to be with you. But that alone 
isn't enough for sex. You need something else - Logistics. 
 
Logistics are the details. This includes navigating both social logistics - her friends, your 
friends - and technical logistics - where to go, getting in contact with each other, eventually find-
ing a bed. 
 
One thing that is absolutely crucial - You should always take every enjoyable interaction as 
far as possible. If she has no unbreakable engagements, and you have no engagements, then 
keep spending time together. Don't fall into the trap of wanting to "leave on a high note" - press 
the interaction towards going further right away if it's good.

But once one of you has some reason you have to leave, you'll get contact information. 
Here's the formula for that: 
 
*Suggest an activity that you'd like to do together. 
*Let her answer yes. 
*Then get her contact information. 
 
So it'll go: "I had so much fun talking with you girl. I'm checking out the Museum of Fine 
Art in a couple days - it'd be cool for you to come with. 
 
Her: "Sounds fun." 
 
You: "Alright cool, you have a number I can reach you at?" 
 
Done correctly, you'll never get "I don't give my number out" - she already agreed to see 
you! Make the activity you suggest SitRel to your conversation - ideally something you screened 
her on earlier. So in the example above, ideally you asked her earlier if she likes art and she said 
yes. 
 
You want the girl to get your number. So if you have a cell phone, enter her number into 
your cell, then say, "I'm going to hit dial on my phone - my number will show up on your caller 
ID." Make sure she knows how to spell your name and punch it into your phone. It's also good 
if you copied her number down wrong into your phone - you'll catch and be able to get the right 
one. 
 
GOT THE NUMBER. NOW WHAT?

Texting!  
 
Texting is the single best way to communicate with women via the phone these days. The 
reason is that it's very little effort on your part, which means you're not working too hard for 
her. Your text messages should NEVER ask for a reply to them. They should always be state-
ments about what's going on and how you feel. A good first text will mention that it was nice to 
become friends with her. 
 
"crazy to meet a new friend on the train :)" 
 
Subsequent texts should be just about what you're doing. Text about the weather, things 
you buy, what you're eating, etc. Do this every day or two - the nice thing about texting is you 
can text every girl in your phone the same message with a little "update" about your life. 
 
"i went with the tshirt today. oops. stay warm" after it snows. 
"i just ate the best. soup. ever." 
 
Little things like that are great. Then whenever you're in a great mood, share it with people! 
Do a mass-text to 10 people you like letting them know how great whatever is going on. 
 
"what an amazingly ridiculously fun night" 
"life is beautiful" 
 
Texting before bed is good. Text right before you go to sleep, then put your phone on "all 
off" so it doesn't start vibrating or beeping. In the morning, you'll have a few new replies - then 
you reply or don't at your leisure. 
 
You should always have a girl reply to at least one text message before calling her - if she'll 
answer her phone to talk to you, she'll reply to a text. If she won't reply to a text... 
 
THE FIRST TIME YOU CALL 
 
It's good to call girls for "short by definition" calls. Call a girl when you're waiting for a train 
that leaves in 10 minutes or a flight that boards in 15. That way, you'll be forced to go for a 
good, legitimate reason soon. It's also a great way to save time - make your phone calls to peo-
ple while waiting for trains, in cabs, waiting for a meeting to start, etc. 
 
The first time you call a girl, it's good to have an enjoyable conversation without asking her 
out on a date or to spend time with you. Call, chat for a while, use it as an opportunity to screen 
her and learn more about her, then say talk to you later. After that, text her again once or twice 
over the next couple days, then you can call again and suggest meeting up.

THE THREE C'S OF DATING 
 
*Cheap 
*Convenient 
*Conversation 
 
The Three C's of Dating - Your first date should always meet this criteria, and so should 
most subsequent dates. 
 
Cheap: The date should be inexpensive. More expensive dates mean more pressure and get 
into dynamics of who is paying and who is not. 
 
Convenient: For you. You shouldn't drive three hours to see her. Much better that she drives 
to see you. 
 
Conversation: The date should be conducive conversation. At least, it shouldn't stifle con-
versation. Ideally, it helps conversation by giving you a range of subjects to talk about. 
 
Stock good dates: 
 
*Window shopping 
*Seeing touristy stuff 
*Museums 
*Ice skating 
*Roller skating 
*Walks in parks and nature 
*Letting her tag along while you run your errands 
 
If you check out your local newspaper and check online, lots of cities and colleges will host 
events that are free to the public and lots of fun. Particularly, dress rehearsals tend to be great 
dates, and the cast are usually happy when more people show up. Dress rehearsals are great. 
 
A NOTE ON MIND AND MEMORY 
 
Remember this: Memory is not linear. Memory is not linear. Memory is not linear. 
 
The more different places you go to with a girl, the more unique and different memories 
she'll have of spending time with you. Some girls won't sleep with a guy until the fifth date - so 
go on five dates the first time you see her! 
 
Stay calm and relaxed, then keep the date moving to as many different locations as possible.

Start by going window shopping, grab a hot chocolate, go for a walk in the park, then stop 
for a bite to eat. 
 
Planning dates around food is a bad idea - plan them on something else, then when you get 
hungry, suggest you get food. Here's a great line for that: 
 
"Are you hungry?" 
 
If she says yes, you say alright, let's grab some food. 
If she says no, you say, "That's okay, you can watch me eat." 
 
By going to as many different places as possible, you create different memories with her. On 
a date, if you go window shopping, walk through a park, run an errand, then grab a cup of tea - 
she'll remember spending time with you in a number of different places. Much better than just 
going to a... yuck... movie. (Movie theaters are for girlfriends, guys) 
 
THE COOL AREA RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE 
 
Look around for the nearest interesting place to your house - a restaurant or bar is ideal, a 
grocery store will do in a pinch. This is a place she can drive or park, or a place you can end up 
with before you take her home. So you went out to see a dress rehearsal with her, then bar-
hopped, and then, hey, what a coincidence, I know this great place nearby with really cheap 
drinks... it's just right across the street... 
 
And that place is your home. :)

SITUATIONAL RELEVANCE 
 
Situational Relevance - Being SitRel as we call it - is the basis of all conversation. The con-
versation flows, and topics come up that make sense and are relevant to the situation and con-
text at hand. 
 
The thing about situational relevance is that there's no objective jury sitting somewhere rul-
ing if something is relevant or not. The rule is this: 
 
IF A STATEMENT APPEARS TO BE SITUATIONALLY RELEVANT, IT IS SITUATION-
ALLY RELEVANT. 
 
This can be used to your advantage if you know how. It's easy to transition fluidly from one 
topic to another. Here's how:  
 
Let's take a sample sentence. 
 
"We had fun last Friday throwing snowballs at each other, playing outside, and then went 
to my friend's house to have hot chocolate." 
 
The following is what we call thread cutting. It forms the foundation of chatting about 
whatever you want. 
 
Make can make a list of all the interesting words in that sentence. These are known as SitRel 
Keywords: If you use a keyword in the next sentence, your sentence will almost always be Si-
tRel. So again, 
 
"We had fun last Friday throwing snowballs at each other, playing outside, and then went 
to my friend's house to have hot chocolate." 
 
SitRel Keywords: 
*Fun 
*last Friday 
*Friday 
*Throwing snowballs 
*Playing 
*Outside 
*Friend's house 
*House 
*Hot chocolate

To "thread cut", what you do is take one word from a sentence, and use that word to form 
a brand new sentence. Because a word the person you're talking to just used is in your sentence, 
it will appear to be SitRel. 
 
Follow-ups to, "We had fun last Friday throwing snowballs at each other, playing outside, 
and then went to my friend's house to have hot chocolate": 
 
*Oh really? I had so much fun over the weekend. I took my puppy for a run and he totally 
wore me out. 
*Nice. Last Friday was absolutely crazy for me - tons of stuff came up for work at the last 
minute even though I had plans starting at 7 PM... well, let's just say I made my plans 
on time... 
*Oh wow, I love Fridays. My favorite day of the week, fun stuff always happens. 
*That totally reminds me of when I was a kid. My brother and I used to demolish our sisters 
with snowballs. I actually feel bad looking back on it... 
*I love playing around like kids. It's so much to get back to. 
*I love it outside in the wintertime. It's so beautiful when fresh snow is down. 
*Isn't it cool to head over to a friend's place when you're totally worn out and just relax and 
kick it? 
*Yeah? I totally love bumming around my best friend's house, because he's got the biggest 
fireplace you've EVER seen. 
*Mmmm, hot chocolate is my favorite. You know where they have the best hot chocolate? 
Amsterdam, by far. 
 
All of those are legitimate sentences that will keep the conversation going, but subtly navi-
gate it to whatever subject you want. 
 
Reasons to thread cut: 
 
*Keep the conversation fresh and exciting 
*Guide it towards subjects that you like to talk about 
*Guide it towards subjects that you can see if she's your type based on 
*Remove - "cut" - bad threads. A bad thread is anything that makes either of you feel bad, 
one that you don't enjoy, or one that hurts either of your attraction for each other. 
 
Example of thread cutting in action:

Let's say a girl brings up an issue that's potentially derisive, like something political. It's 
not conducive to seduction usually, so let's get the hell away from there! 
 
Girl: My professor was saying during class yesterday that women shouldn't be paid as 
much as men because they have a greater chance of leaving the workforce to raise families. Can 
you believe that? 
 
Now, must guys would either jump in and say, "That's totally wrong! I'm a champion of 
woman's rights and..." and go off on some dorky spiel, thus continuing this thread that is not 
conducive to the guy and girl connecting, that's not fun, and not really productive for anyone. 
So thread cut! 
 
SitRel Keywords: 
*Professor 
*Class 
*Yesterday 
*Women 
*Paid 
*Men 
*Workforce 
*Raising families 
*Families 
 
So here's just a few thread cuts you could potentially do: This will get the topic to another 
subject, one that's more conducive to connecting with the girl and both of you enjoying your-
selves. 
 
*Yeah? I had the absolute worst professor back during my Junior year of undergrad. I re-
member he said the day he walked in, "If you're a man, you're going to have to break your back 
in this class. If you're a girl, just come by my office after hours." Anyway, he got fired the week 
before the final exam, and everyone in the class was given an "A" automatically - wild stuff 
huh? 
 
*I kind of miss class. In the real world, sleeping during meetings doesn't really work, so... 
Ha, what's your favorite class?

*Sounds yucky. I had a weird day yesterday too. I was at the gym, and I actually ran into a 
really old friend of mine who I knew like six years ago. Back then, he was a really skinny guy. 
So yesterday, this HUGE, like totally jacked guy runs up to me and says, "My friend!" and gives 
me this huge bear hug, and I had no idea who this guy was. So I'm playing it off, and it turns 
out it's my buddy Jack, from ages ago, who was always the skinny as a pencil kid. But, totally 
huge now. Good to see an old friend, wild day though. 
 
Any of those get you off the subject that isn't fun, and let's you maneuver into something 
else. The key is, you don't need any fancy lines prepared. You just pick one - any - word out of 
her sentence, and use it in your own sentence. Thus, the thread is cut, and you move forwards. 
 
ADVANCED THREADCUTTING 
 
After you practice and get a solid grasp of thread cutting, you can add another element to 
really give you a wide range of conversational options. You can pick out implied topics from the 
conversation and use those for thread cuts too. Let's go back to our original snowball example. 
 
"We had fun last Friday throwing snowballs at each other, playing outside, and then went 
to my friend's house to have hot chocolate." 
 
Original SitRel Keywords: 
*Fun 
*last Friday 
*Friday 
*Throwing snowballs 
*Playing 
*Outside 
*Friend's house 
*House 
*Hot chocolate 
 
There's a lot to work with. But let's look at the implied topics. 

 
 
38 
Copyright 2006 theApproach 
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook    
 
Implied Topics: 
*Spending time with friends 
*Cold weather 
*Snow 
*Acting like kids 
*Hanging out 
*Relaxing 
 
So a range of additional sentences would be: 
 
*I love spending time with my friends, just kicking it like that. Awesome stuff... 
*You know, I don't really like the cold weather, but some wintery stuff can be tons of fun. 
*Yeah? I love snow, but I've basically given up on the East coast. I'm moving to San Diego or 
Hawaii or something. 
*Isn't it great to go out and just act like kids? 
*It's cool when you get to hang out on a Friday without a care in the world, pelting your 
pals with snowballs. 
*Sounds really relaxing, nice. 
 
For many sentences, there is a theoretically infinite number of implied topics. 
 
Let's apply to this to conversation: 
 
Girl: I think it's really gentlemanly when a guy buys a girl a drink. 
 
*whoop whoop whoop* - our alarm is going off. You don't want to buy girls drinks, and 
she's obviously fishing for one. Now, most guys might say - "I don't buy girls drinks!" Wrong 
answer - it's not fun for both of you. Some might just do it - also not the right answer. Let's see 
how thread cutting can get us through this. 
 
Girl: I think it's really gentlemanly when a guy buys a girl a drink. 
 
Well, first our SitRel Keywords: 
 
*Gentlemanly 
*Guy 
*Buys 
*Girl 
*Drink 

 
 
39 
Copyright 2006 theApproach 
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook    
 
Nothing too great to work with - you could still use one of those keywords to get into a 
better topic, but there's a lot better options available if you look at the implied topics. 
 
Implied Topics: 
 
*Male/Female Interaction 
*Supplication 
*Treating 
*Taking care of people 
*Doing nice things 
 
Now, we want to be positive - we don't want to make ourselves or the girl feel bad 
(usually...). So where can we go from here? 
 
Response: 
 
"Yeah, it feels good to be treated - we were out last night and my friend's girlfriend was 
buying the bar for our group, it was really good of her." 
 
Or, 
 
"It's really great when someone does something nice for you - it can make you feel taken 
care of. One of my coworkers was just in China, and picked up a strand of pearls for my mom. 
What a hell of a guy, huh?" 
 
Negative turned into a positive - check.

CLOSING DATES 
 
Don't feel pressure to sleep with girl on any particular meet up and try to force it. Much bet-
ter to pencil women around your schedule. If you plan on meeting women for just an hour or 
two, you'll be in great shape - if it goes well you can extend it, but don't make the mistake of 
trying to block in six hours of spending time with each other - too much pressure, and it's a clas-
sical case of trying too hard. 
 
Now, after you've seen her a couple times, you want to sleep with her. You can do what we 
call a "closing date" - this is a date conducive to having sex. The #1 and #2 closing dates are: 
 
1. Cooking together at your or her place 
2. Watching a movie together at your or her place 
 
#1 is ideal. Go the store and pick up some groceries together, and cook together. Delegate 
important tasks to her, like stirring. Do manly things like chop vegetables. Cook and eat to-
gether. 
 
Alternatively, invite her over to watch a movie. This date is not quite as good as cooking 
because it's a fairly overt invitation to have sex (whereas cooking is a bit more subtle) but it 
works almost as well.

ESCALATION 
 
Have you ever been to an assembly in middle school or high school? Have you ever had 
your leg just barely touching the leg of the girl next to you. And wondered... does she know this 
happening? 
 
The answer is: Yes, she did. She might've been wondering the same thing. But that's the joy 
of it - even though both people may be aware of it, it's "incidental" - neither person is trying to 
create it. 
 
If you want to get physical with a woman, you first need to be touching her already, in an 
incidental way. It should not seem like you are trying to make this happen. It should seem like 
it's "just happening". 
 
Examples of incidental kino: 
 
*Brushing up against each other as you walk 
*Legs intertwined as you sit facing each other on barstools 
*Your and her hands touching when handing something to the other person (such as a 
drink or salt shaker) 
 
The #1 form of incidental kino for escalation: 
 
*Sitting closely next to each other on a couch 
 
Look at couples in a happy relationship - they'll always be touching very slightly without 
either of them consciously manufacturing it. If you can get the same with a woman, you'll both 
feel comfortable around each other. And remember - if she's not willing to touch you very 
slightly like that, she's not ready to be kissed yet! 
 
One of the ideal ways to escalate is to have a blanket near your couch. After eating dinner, 
throw on a movie, grab a blanket, and cuddle. When you go for a first kiss, you should be so 
close that you can simply turn her head and move not more than a few inches to kiss her.

LAST MINUTE RESERVATIONS 
 
Sometimes a woman will have last minute reservations about sex. A lot of men mistake 
these or deal with them poorly - this is simply when a person wants to do something, but they 
would like to be reassured that it is a good decision. 
 
Examples include: 
 
*"This is so soon" 
*"I can't believe we're doing this" 
*"I don't know you that well" 
*"This is so bad" 
 
Now realize that people who have dated and gotten out there enough have heard all of 
these while a woman simultaneously pulls down our pants. Just remember: Verbally agree with 
her. 
 
*"This is crazy this is happening so soon." 
*"I can't believe this either, this is wild." 
*"I know, it's amazing how fast this happening." 
*"This is so totally bad... it feels good, but this is totally bad..." 
 
NEVER argue with her. In fact, never argue with anyone, ever, for any reason. But here es-
pecially, never argue with her. Realize that she just wants some reassurance most of the time, 
and this will cover 90% of LMR. 
 
There are, however, two types of last minute reservations: 
 
The first, which the above handles, is where she likes you, but has reservations about hav-
ing sex: She wants to know that you'll treat her well, that you'll make her feel good, that she 
won't feel used afterwards, that you don't hurt her. 
 
The second kind of LMR is where she likes sex but isn't sure about you. If you've been char-
ismatic and charming and have gotten VAC as prescribed - this will never be your problem. 
However, if you haven't made her work hard enough (not enough compliance) or you've tried 
to impress her too much so it looks like you're chasing her, sometimes you'll run into the second 
kind of LMR: 
 

 
 
43 
Copyright 2006 theApproach 
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook
theAttraction Handbook    
 
Where she likes sex, but doesn't like you. 
 
This will be rare if you follow this manual, but it does happen. In these cases, you can make 
the occasional joke at her expense. BUT, if you act reassuring and unphased, that handles this 
second kind of LMR too. Joking around or acting like a drama queen will definitely destroy 
your connection if you do it when the girl likes you but just has a small reservation about hav-
ing sex at that moment. 
 
CONVERTING HER INTO A RELATIONSHIP 
 
Getting girls into relationships is quite easy - women are naturally hardwired to want to 
stick around men who they frequently have good sex with. The formula for converting a girl is 
to keep having sex and keep getting VAC. Sounds simple right? 
 
How you act right after sex will determine in huge part how she sees your value and attain-
ability. You need to cuddle with her, smile, and be light and airy and enjoying yourself. This is 
NOT the time to get moody or standoffish! (Believe it or not, some men get moody/standoffish 
after having sex - it's a huge mistake and makes it much harder for those type of men to get girl-
friends) 
 
Don't go immediately to sleep. Going to sleep soon is okay, but cuddle with her, let her 
know it was nice and you enjoyed being with her. It's recommended to go get a meal after hav-
ing sex. If it's early in the day, go out and do a late lunch or dinner. If it's at night, go get break-
fast in the morning. Cooking a meal together like this would be good too. 
 
Now it's time to get her working more. The game doesn't end when you have sex - that's 
when the game starts. The cards are now stacked in your favor, but this is where things really 
begin and where you set things up so you have a happy, healthy relationship with her.

MING DYNASTY 
 
Relationships are a lot like pottery. To make a vase, you first find raw materials - clay, sand, 
water. As you move through the world looking for the raw materials, you have lots of choices - 
red or grey clay? What kind of water? 
 
After you find the raw materials you want, you mix them to the consistency you want and 
put them on your potter's wheel. You spin it into the shape you want, then you put it in the 
oven to harden. After a round of firing, you take it out, glaze it, and put into the oven again - 
after it comes out, it's fire hardened in how it will look for the rest of it's existence. 
 
Relationships are very similar. Before the vase is ever being made, you're choosing raw ma-
terials. A master craftsman could do an excellent job with poor raw materials, but it's still not a 
very wise choice - if you scoop up a handful of clay, and there's cigarette butts littered in it, you 
usually want to dump that scoop for a different one. In short - start with quality girls and your 
relationships will be much smoother. 
 
Then, you're mixing the raw materials to your taste. All of us have different personality 
traits, and we act like completely different people around different people in our lives. If you 
asked your mother, best friend, cousin, boss, and accountant to describe you, you'd get pretty 
different descriptions from all of them. That's the consistency - you want to bring out and en-
courage the best of your girl. 
 
In the first six weeks of the relationship, you're spinning the pot and putting into the oven 
for the first round. After six weeks, you're slowly glazing it and fire hardening it over the next 
year. 
 
At that point, the relationship will be very hard to change. And the longer it goes, the 
harder and riskier it would be to change. If a potter doesn't like his vase while he's spinning it, 
he can flatten the clay and start over. But if you look at a vase from the Ming Dynasty - it takes 
hundreds if not thousands of man hours to attempt to repair a single chip in such a vase, and if 
it's not handled very carefully it will shatter into a million pieces. 
 
Keep that in mind, and set your relationships up correctly from the very beginning.

DRAWING THE BATTLE-LINES 
 
People naturally push their limits to see what they can get away with. It's completely natu-
ral and all people do it. 
 
Now, what do most men ask for in a relationship? Exactly what it would take to make them 
happy. They would like to have sex three times a week, for instance. Nothing crazy - just regu-
lar, nice sex three times a week. 
 
Understand that women, like all people, will naturally push their limits. So if a guy asks for 
ONLY what it would take for him to be happy, then when the woman pushes her limits, what 
happens? The guy isn't happen. 
 
When a person pushes the limits you've set, it can be called "pushing the battle-lines" - 
they're picking a fight. "I don't want to have sex tonight", "I don't want to cook tonight", "You 
don't buy me gifts enough", "We never go anywhere" - something along those lines. 
 
If you've drawn the battle lines right in front of your happiness, what happens when the 
lines get pushed? That's right, you're unhappy. You ask for just as much sex as you want, and 
then when she wants to push the limits, she says no sex. And you're an unhappy camper. 
 
What you need to do instead is to draw the battle-lines far away from your happiness. In-
stead of asking for just what you want, ask for much, much more than what you want. So in-
stead of, "I don't want to have sex tonight," you'll get, "Can we just have regular sex tonight in-
stead of having anal sex on the balcony?" If you take more than what you need to be happy 
from a relationship, then when she goes to push her limits and see what's up, you're still happy 
while you sort it out. Works like a charm.

PRECEDENCE IS KING 
 
People get used to reacting to other people in certain ways. Here's a true story: 
 
I knew a well-educated woman who was a professor of the arts. She had been married for 
eight years, and from the start of her marriage, her husband would throw his underwear on the 
floor every night when he got changed, and she would pick it up and put it into the hamper. 
 
After eight years of doing this, she one day said, "I'm not picking up your damn under-
wear!" They were divorced six months later. 
 
I sympathize for her - I certainly wouldn't want to pick up underwear every day, and more 
importantly, it wouldn't be any extra work or effort for her husband to put the underwear in the 
hamper as he took it off. But here's where the problem comes in - 
 
She started doing something she didn't like, and he got used to it. It's very hard to break 
patterns of behavior - people get used to them, and adapt. Habit is one of the most powerful of 
human behaviors. People HATE when the status quo is broken. 
 
For this dear professor, her mistake was in picking up his underwear even once. If the first 
time he threw it on the floor when they were newlyweds, if she'd said, "Yuck, that's gross, put 
your underwear in the hamper" with a big smile, they'd have never gotten into that cycle. In-
stead, what she did was do things she didn't like "for the relationship" for a long time, and after 
eight years, she tried to abruptly change all those behaviors. The vase shattered. 
 
So, rule#2 of relationships is...

If doing it would be annoying in six months, don't do it once now! 
 
It can very, very easy to get high on endorphins and promise the world to a woman after 
having sex the first time. The early stages of a relationship - the so-called "honeymoon period" - 
are always quite amazing. But ask yourself this: "If I do this action, will I be able to continue do-
ing it and enjoy doing it for six months, a year, two years, five years down the road?" Consider 
it. 
 
Smart men set things up the way they like in the beginning. If you have a busy life and can 
only really see a woman once a week, it would be cruel to see her five days a week for two 
months, then cut down to once a week after that. If you don't like going on fancy dates, then 
don't do it from the start. If you want to watch sports with her around, make sure she starts 
watching sports with you from the beginning (she'll be receptive to it early in the relationship - 
good luck trying to set it up after things have been going for a while if you haven't!). 
 
Here's the honest-to-God truth: I don't like giving gifts on "Hallmark holidays" - I resent 
Valentine's Day and I think modern Christmas has totally lost focus of what the holiday should 
be and is a sham. 
 
I don't like giving gifts on mandated, expected days, to everyone I know in my life. I travel a 
lot, and when I see something I think a loved one would like, I get it for them regardless of what 
holidays are coming up. Now here's the thing that might blow your mind. About three weeks 
before the first Christmas I spend with a woman, I'll say, 
 
"Sweetie, I don't really like the commercialized Western Christmas, it makes me pretty sad 
and I don't like giving gifts on those terms. I like to give gifts when I see something that I think 
someone I care about would like, not on a random arbitrary day with large price-markups that 
completely defy the notion of what spirituality, religion, and family are supposed to be about. 
Go ahead and not get me anything either."

And guess what? It's okay with them! Women usually get me gifts for Christmas anyway, 
despite me telling them not to. I'll give them a kiss in return. 
 
As for Valentine's Day? I dedicate Valentine's Day to playing electronic games. I don't even 
usually see my girlfriend if it's our first Valentine's Day together. I remember one year I had a 
girlfriend of two years, and I went over to her apartment a couple days after V-Day. She threw 
her arms around me, and said, "Thank you so much!" 
 
I said, "Sure, no problem... for what?" She looked at me. "The roses?" I say, "The roses?" She 
asks, "Not from you?!?" 
 
They were signed "From a Secret Admirer" - I told her they weren't from me. She was so 
mad! She was about to throw them away when I asked if I could have a few for my kitchen , 
and I took them and put them in water in a vase on my kitchen table. We had great sex that day, 
better I'm sure than sex would've been if I'd been the one who sent her the roses. 
 
This all comes down to having the guts to really speak your mind early in a relationship. 
Most men resent Valentine's Day, but go along with it just because. It makes them resentful and 
wastes their wallet. By drawing the battle-lines correctly from the beginning, it gives her a 
chance to accept who you are.  
 
Now, imagine you'd been with a woman for 15 years, giving her gifts every Valentine's 
Day, and then you didn't one year! It would make her feel horrible. Instead, with a woman, 
she'll understand that I don't really like these "Hallmark holidays" and she'll understand and 
respect that to me with a man of my caliber, she's not getting chocolates on Valentine's Day. She 
can, of course, still come over in her pink and black lacy heart lingerie, cook me a meal, and get 
some sex... after the first year, because the first year, I'm playing some video games :)

INTENTION MAPPING 
 
How come some men never stay single for more than three weeks? How come some men 
can't get anything more than a one night stand to save their life? And how come some men, who 
really aren't all that great looking, get multiple girlfriends in open relationships. Girls are beau-
tiful, intelligent, ambitious, with high self-esteem, accepting an arrangement that most people 
would think impossible. 
 
Is it luck? Is it fate? 
 
I present to you one word: Intention. 
 
Everyone behaves differently around different people. You will be a different person 
around your grandmother than you are around your boss than you are around your accountant 
than you are around your father. 
 
You'll act differently. Your grandmother, most likely, thinks you don't use vulgarities ever. 
Your best friend might have a little different perception of you. 
 
People are malleable - women especially. We behave differently in different situations. 
Now, to answer the question of why some men get exactly what they want, and why others get 
the same exact thing that they absolutely don't want, I present to you the Intention Map: 
 
An Intention Map is a tool to modify behavior. The short version is, you will get the other 
person feeling and acting around you the way you want them to.  
 
There are three primary phases of an Intention Map: 
 
1. Screening 
2. Qualifying 
3. Sex/Afterglow 
 
But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let us start at the beginning.

THE INTENTION: 
 
To get what you want, you must have a clear, defined idea of what you want. The first thing 
to do, before you begin intention mapping, is to make a list of traits you want in all women. 
Traits might include ambitious, creative, hard-working, caring, affectionate. 
 
Next, figure out what specific roles you want in your life. Do you want an open relation-
ship? A really casual "friends with benefits" situation? Exclusivity? Whatever you want, that is 
good - just know what you want. 
 
Then make a list of traits that you'd want for that specific relationship. Some traits I find are 
good in certain relationships: 
 
EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS: 
 
Loyal 
Feminine 
Traditional 
Conservative 
 
OPEN RELATIONSHIPS: 
 
Independant 
Understanding 
Open-minded 
Non-jealous 
 
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS: 
 
Spontaneous 
Exciting 
Independent 
Experimental 
 
Note that this isn't your list necessarily. What you want from an exclusive relationship may 
vary. Many men don't want a highly independent woman in an exclusive relationship - if you're 
going to only be with one person, you want them available on your schedule. Some men might 
like an exclusive relationship with an independent woman though, so you fill in your own list.

Now, the behavior modification. 
 
Take the list of qualities that you want in all women: 
 
Ambitious 
Creative 
Hard-working 
Caring 
Affectionate 
 
Add in the list of qualities that you want in the specific relationship you want: 
 
Independant 
Understanding 
Open-minded 
Non-jealous 
 
Now, it's time to get to the three phases of an intention map. 
 
What you are going to do is you are going to get the girl saying she is this quality, you are 
going to reinforce to her that you like because she is this quality, and you are going to reinforce 
it again during and immediately after sex.

PHASE ONE: SCREENING 
 
Screening is a technique that increases compliance, and shows that you have standards. Ex-
amples of screening questions include: 
 
"I like ambitious people. Do you consider yourself to be ambitious?" 
"All my friends are really into a lot of creative things. What creative things do you do?" 
"Do you work hard for things you believe in?" 
"You strike me as a really caring person. Am I right?" 
"I can tell you're very loyal, but are you also affectionate?" 
 
"Ugh, you see all these girls around who can't get anything done without a man helping 
them." Tell me, are you independent?" 
"A lot of my friends don't have traditional values. Do you consider yourself to be an under-
standing person?" 
"Are you open-minded to seeing and trying new things?" 
"You don't get jealous easily, do you?" 
 
Those questions are all weighted towards getting what you want. A select few women will 
be unable to meet your criteria. For instance, not all women are creative. It's up to you what 
you're willing to compromise on in your list - I'm absolutely unwilling to compromise on a 
woman having high self-esteem, so I'll dismiss girls who have low self-esteem.  
 
I also like girls who love art, music, and theatre - but I'm willing to compromise on that if 
she has other interests I enjoy, like nature or exercise. 
 
It's up to you what you're willing to compromise on. The fact is, if she likes you, she'll try to 
give you the right answers to your screening questions. Most people consider themselves to be 
ambitious, caring, open-minded, etc. She's going to say she is either way - the key is, by saying 
it, she'll precedence herself to it, and want to act that way around you especially.  
 
So though she might not be a very open-minded person around her friends from church, 
she will be around you ;)

PHASE TWO: QUALIFICATION 
 
Now, you will simply tell her that she meets your standards, and that she has the specific 
type of trait you're looking for. This needs to be Situationally Relevant as we say - so do it after 
she does something to display that trait, or immediately after a screening question saying she is. 
 
"You're so ambitious. I like that." 
"I like that you're so creative." 
"Thank you for being so caring. It makes me feel really good." 
"Mmmm, you're so affectionate." 
 
"I like that you're so independent." 
"Wow, you're so understanding of things outside of what you were raised with. That's 
amazing." 
"It's really cool to hang out with such an open-minded girl." 
"It's nice to spend time with you - you're so secure in yourself and never get jealous. I love 
it." 
 
Ever hear the expression, "Treat a man as you would have him become." There was a typo 
in it. it should have read, "Treat a woman as you would have her become." Tell her she's exactly 
what you want - and she'll want to live up to that. True story: 
 
I was driving with my girlfriend at the time to spend the Fourth of July at a beach house. 
Even after a year and a half together, just coincidentally, I'd never driven a car with her in the 
passenger seat. We'd been in other cars together, and lots of taxis, but living near each other in a 
city with good public transportation, I'd never driven her. 
 
Well, I just coincidentally happened to be going the speed limit. Really, a coincidence to the 
extreme. And yet she said to me, "Sebastian... you can tell so much about a person by the way 
they drive. My sister's boyfriend swerves all over the road, honks, gets angry, cuts people off. 
Goes too fast, too slow - and you can tell he doesn't have his life together. You're going just the 
speed limit, nothing's bothering you... it says a lot about who you are." 
 
Here's the thing - I *knew* what she was doing, and I *still* drove perfectly for the rest of 
the weekend. People don't want to go against praise that they get. So tell people that they are 
exactly what you want them to be. 
 
(note: this also works great when you're getting service from a company. Whenever some-
thing's going wrong at an airport, I always say, "Thank you so much. Your airline is always 
really, really good to me, so I feel so comfortable when I'm flying with you folks." It results in a 
higher quality of service as they try to live up to that)

PHASE THREE: SEX / AFTERGLOW 
 
During sex is a special time. We get into a state of raw emotion, and let loose our logical 
constraints. During sex, qualification goes into the subconscious to the extreme. So you can say 
things like: 
 
"I love making love to such an ambitious girl baby." 
"Mmmm, baby, how creative you are turns me on so much." 
"Oh yeah, I love being with you here - you're so caring, take care of me, make me feel so 
good." 
"You're so affectionate." 
 
There is also the afterglow, immediately after sex. 
 
"Wow, it's great being with such an independent girl." 
"It feels good lying next to a girl so open-minded." 
"Damn baby, you're so open-minded. It shows when we're in bed too." 
"I love that you're so secure in yourself. We're here together and you're not worrying, you're 
calm and in the moment." 
 
The other thing you do during the Afterglow stage is you set up the TIMEFRAME of the 
relationship. You do this after you've been having sex for a little while, perhaps three weeks. So, 
for an open-relationship where you're seeing each other once a week or so, you'll say. 
 
"You're so great, baby. We spend amazing time together, and then you're independent and 
have a really great life besides just me. The time we spend together is amazing, and yet you un-
derstand that I've got a really busy life. It feels great to be with you." 
 
With this system, you can develop your intention throughout the interaction: Before you 
ever have sex, she'll be saying she's what you want, and you'll be telling her she's what you 
want and that's why you like that. During sex, you say that you feel good making love to her 
because she's want you want, and after sex you'll say it feels good lying next to her because 
she's what you want. 
 
Enforced and reinforced so many times, this shapes and modifies her behavior. She might 
still be close-minded around her friends, but she'll be open-minded around you and yours - and 
that's what counts.

-Developing the Lifestyle You Want- 
 
Non-Verbal Image Projection 
 
People size you up all the time on a quick glance. Once you spend significant amount of 
time training in social skills, you  
 
start to get an intuitive sense of whose "got it" just by looking at them. You look for hun-
dreds of little nonverbal cues that someone is a success or failure. 
 
Here's the thing: If someone looks successful, people will assume they are. If someone looks 
unsuccessful, people will assume they're not. 
 
But looking successful is easy. Let me assure you: It is much easier to improve your appear-
ance than it is to improve the way you see the world and relate to it. Both are easy: But looking 
good is much better. 
 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD LOOKING AND LOOKING GOOD 
 
Not everyone is "good looking" the way they are born. I certainly was not. But it's certainly 
possible to look good, no matter how bad off you started. There are many documented cases of 
guys who weren't given much - 5'6 nerdy ball types - turning themselves into guys who looked 
good. Now, these guys wouldn't win a male modeling contract or be cast as the "manly man" in 
commercials that sell lawnmowers, but they certainly look good enough to get women. 
 
Some men are naturally good looking. If you're one of them, pat yourself on the back. Your 
parents were good to you. If you're not, it's sort of okay to hate these people as long as it doesn't 
waste time you'd spend improving yourself. 
 
The nice thing about making changes like these is that they're largely permanent. Once you 
improve your appearance, it requires little more than basic upkeep to keep looking good.

A WORD ON HEALTH 
 
Being healthy = Being more attractive. You don't need to make broad changes in your diet 
to become more healthy. Here's a few quick things you could do: 
 
*Cut down and remove simple, process carbohydrates: White bread, soda, cookies, cake. 
*Eat less sugary things. 
*Get higher fiber content in food (especially in bread - look for bread with 3 or 4 grams of 
fiber per serving, or more). 
*Eat more vegetables. 
*Cut out fruit juices - eat fruit instead. 
*Cut cream and sugar out of your coffee/tea. 
*Eat less fried foods. 
*Break your meals down into smaller portions. 
*Eat something every morning, early in the morning. 
*Use olive oil or other healthy oils to cook with, instead of corn oil or other bad kinds. 
 
Those are a few things. Pick one of them and do it. And you want a really good one that'll 
make you feel a million times better and make your skin look a lot better? 
 
*Drink lots of water. 
 
Huge suggestion. Pays large dividends.

FASHION AND DRESS 
 
Fashion is ruled by "social handicapping", or the handicap principal. This phenomenon is 
outlined well in Matt Ridley's book The Red Queen. In summary, what it says is that surviving 
despite a handicap is one of the most honest indicators of value. 
 
Spending extra time and money for frilliness in clothing shows that you're on top of your 
life, doing well enough professionally that you can afford luxuries, and that you control your 
own schedule. Here's the great part though: You don't have to spend more money to be better 
dressed. In fact, a lot of great clothing costs less than generic brands like Levi's. 
 
Here's a few general rules to make your clothing look better: 
 
*You want no extra material in your clothing. A lot of guys who think they are skinny or fat 
try to wear large clothing to conceal their body. This is the exact wrong effect. Would you like 
some proof? 
 
Okay, check this: Look around the average nightclub. There will be some overweight 
women there. Which ones get attention? The ones that wear "fat girl clothing" that's frilly 
around the stomach to ostensibly hide it? Or the ones that dress the same as hot women do - 
with confidence, showing off? Now as much as I don't like it, the fat girls that get attention are 
the ones that dress like they are hot. You too, should dress like a "hot guy" regardless if you are 
or not. 
 
*If you raise your arms above your head and no skin is showing, your shirt is too large. 
 
*Your shirt should fit without extra material across your torso and abdomen. For skinny 
guys, this can be a problem - look for more European brands. 
 
*Every guy wants to think he's big. Guys don't like being "small". It's "unmanly" or some-
thing - get over it. I'm 6'0 and I wear American-sized extra-smalls sometimes, and shop in the 
"young adults" (read: children's) section of fashionable stores regularly. The fact is, American 
clothing is cut very, very large. Now, I'm a large in Europe and an XXXXXL in Japan, but 
American clothing? Look for smalls and x-smalls, even if you're used to wearing large.

*Your shoes should be clean and "new looking". By taking care of your shoes, they'll con-
tinue to look that way for quite a while. If you're going to be doing lots of mucking around out-
side, hiking, or playing pickup sports games, it's recommended you get a pair of construction 
boots, hiking boots, or sneakers as appropriate, and having clean shoes for wearing to other 
events. 
 
*You get extra points if your belt, shoes, and watch match: Very classy look. 
 
FUNCTIONAL ACCESSORIES 
 
When you wear a bunch of gold chains, assuming they're not tacky, it's good for your value 
(you seem confident and outgoing) and it's potentially bad for attainability (is this guy for real? 
does he think he's a player?). There are a few slots you can accessorize without setting off that 
trigger though. These are the "functional accessories" - you're expected to wear them, so you 
don't harm attainability by doing so. 
 
They are: 
 
*Socks 
*Belt 
*watch 
*Scarf 
 
It should be a MUST to get interesting socks. Trash your dirty white tube socks. Start to 
move away from the solid color black and brown socks that have served you well. Look for ar-
gyle socks, or interesting colors and patterns. Great socks can really set you off, and girls do 
take notice of these things. 
 
What a good belt is up to your own style. Try to match your belt to your shoes. 
 
Women regard your watch as your "second face" - it says a lot about who you are. I've also 
seen a consistent pattern: Men base their style around their watch. Maybe because you look at it 
lot, maybe something else, but I notice that when I wear a different watch shopping, I buy stuff 
that matches my watch and I've seen the pattern with other people too.  
 
If you want to change your style, change your watch and the rest will follow it. And scarves 
are excellent in the winter time for setting outfits off. Look for either a scarf that compliments or 
contrasts the colors you're wearing.

GIRLS WANT TO TALK TO GUYS BUT ARE BAD AT IT 
 
You'd be surprised at how often a woman wants to talk to a man but does not find anything 
to say, gets nervous, and clams up.  
 
So make it easy for them! One of the first places they'll look for something to talk to you 
about is around your neck. If you're wearing an interesting scarf you're in good shape. If not, 
the first piece of jewelry you should get is an interesting necklace or pendant that means some-
thing to you and has a story behind it. Wear it out socializing for a few weeks - if you're ap-
proaching people and talking to them, and no one compliments or mentions your necklace, it's 
time to try out a new one. 
 
Every guy needs: 
1 good pair of clean shoes 
1 good pair of solid jeans 
3 shirts that fit well 
5 pairs of interesting socks 
1 accessory that lets girls start a conversation about 
 
It's better to have one or two good outfits than a few mediocre ones. Remember that - you 
can wear the same jeans all weekend, you can wear the same shoes regularly. Shirts could use 
changing, and please change your socks! But you don't need a lot to go out, not at all.

GETTING FASHION-WISE 
 
It is worth the time it takes to learn basic fashion. Here's what to do: Flip through magazines 
like GQ and Cargo and study them a bit. After you've been doing this for a couple months, then 
just flip quickly through them - when you have a developed sense of fashion, you can look at 
the ads in a couple different magazines for about 5-10 minutes and get a surprisingly good 
grasp of what the next season's style is. 
 
When fashion week happens, many, many web sites have coverage. These are good to 
browse around and spend a couple hours on.  
 
You'll get to see some men's clothing and there's always cute girls wearing ridiculous outfits 
that'll never catch on too.  
 
It's funny and cute. 
 
IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET 
 
If you're on a budget, rejoice. You're going to be buying "faux designer" clothing - stuff that 
imitates what's in fashion quite well, without the underlying long-term quality. This is, in actu-
ality, an excellent place to be in. Well-made designer clothing lasts 2-5 years, but is usually out 
of the style by two years at the most. By wearing brands like H&M and Express, your clothing 
will be wearing out right on schedule, and it's much cheaper. 
 
Also, flip through a copy of GQ immediately before going out to a discounters like TJ Max 
or Marshall's. 95% of the clothing in those stores are utterly horrible. You don't buy that 95%.  
 
You pick out and buy one of the few good pieces they have for an absolute steal - these 
stores typically stock things that couldn't sell. 95% of it couldn't sell for good reason - it's ugly, 
ugly stuff. The other 5% is typically overstocked clothing - one store got sent way too many of 
some kind of shirt or pants or jacket.  
 
This is the exact same high quality stuff they have in expensive stores, but at a fraction of 
the price because of their oversight in manufacturing or shipping too much of it. Rejoice.

IF YOU WANT TO BREAK THE RULES 
 
If you want to break the rules, you need to learn them first. Within a year of getting into 
fashion, most people start to move away towards their own, personal style and image. You need 
to know the rules of fashion first. If you're trying to make a statement, you're going to make a 
much more powerful one by getting far away from what's in, consciously, and coordinating that 
style than you will be mixing and matching some stuff that's in, some stuff that's newly out, and 
some stuff that looks terrible. 
 
Another advantage of learning fashion is you'll be able to spot exactly how image conscious 
women are by their dress within a year of getting into it. You'll be able to see a lot of where her 
priorities lay in terms of image and social status just on a glance: This is in fact, very useful in-
formation to be able to assess quickly. 
 
Body Language 
 
You're constantly being sized up before you speak a single word. After you get your fashion 
handled, it's time to get your body language under control. 
 
Here's an order to go down to get things under control: 
 
*Push your shoulders "back and broad" - as far out and pushed back as possible 
*Push your chest out 
*Suck your stomach in 
*Tilt your head up 
*Take a deep breath... 
*...hold it... 
*...and exhale: Let your shoulders fall to a relaxed comfortable position, keep that chest out 
and stomach in. 
 
Back and broad: This maximizes your space, and presents a confident, dominant image. 
Chest out, stomach in: This makes you look stronger and healthier. 
Head up: Your head should be above parallel to the ground. Ever see rich "snobby" people 
with their heads held really high?  
 
It's indicative of thinking you're very high status. Do it. 
 
Breathing: After organizing your body language, you'll be slightly tense. Take a deep breath 
and relieve the tension.

YOU MUST TOUCH PEOPLE TO SUCCEED IN THE WORLD 
 
You must touch people to succeed in the world. Being able to touch others shows you're 
comfortable in yourself, comfortable around others, not nervous, honest, dominant, confident, 
and a leader. There is, undoubtedly, a correct way to touch people. 
 
The word "kinesthetic" means physical. Sometimes "good touching" is called "kino". 
 
THE THREE GOOD KINDS OF KINO 
 
There are three good kinds of kino: 
 
Playful, protective, and incidental. 
 
Playful kino is touching a girl in a playful way - tickling her, taking her hand and twirling 
her around, nudging her with a smile, playing hot hands or thumb wars, and anything that is 
light, playful and fun. 
 
Protective kino is touching a girl in a way that is protective and makes her feel safe. This 
includes putting your hand on her lower back as you move through a crowd together or cross 
the street, holding hands, or having her arm in yours "escorting her" somewhere. 
 
Incidental kino is kino that "just happens". It would include brushing up against each other 
as you walk down a street, sharing an umbrella, placing your hand on her shoulder as you point 
to something off in the distance, or just sitting close to each other on a couch. 
 
All kino should seem either spontaneous or subconscious - never planned or prepared. 
 
Playful kino should always seem spontaneous. 
 
Incidental kino should always seem subconscious. 
 
Protective kino can be either. 
 
Never look where you touch - it's nonverbally "asking permission". 
 
Do it like you mean it - if you'll recall a lot of films where the guy is trying to put his arm 
around a girl by yawning and then leaving his arm around her like a wet noodle - this is wrong. 
If you're going to do it, do it.

FLUIDITY IN MOTION 
 
All of your gestures should be calculated, fluid, and slow. Never seem rushed or spastic. 
This has two major applications: 
 
First, slow down the way you move around the world. When you're going to walk some-
where, stop, decide where you want to walk, then walk to that point. If you're unsure where to 
go, stop again and reassess - do not rock back and forth taking a few steps in every direction like 
a confused tourist.  
 
When you go to reach to pick something up, do it smoothly. A lot of people think they're 
not coordinated, or that they're clumsy. The fact is, it can be practiced like anything else. Any-
one who is physically healthy can possess basic coordination and make slow, fluid gestures. 
 
Second, slow down the way you eat. In much of the modern world, time is at a premium, 
and our eating habits reflect it. Slow down the way you eat, roll food around in your mouth, 
taste it, and enjoy it. Chew your food, enjoy it.  
 
Have you ever seen a woman eat an apple slowly and seductively? 
 
 Sexy, right?  
 
Be like that. Many, many women size men up about how they are in bed by the way they 
eat. And why wouldn't they? Food and sex are two of the nicest things available on earth. Both 
should be enjoyed to their fullest extent, and that means not rushing through either like the 
cookie monster.

Getting Results 
 
The fact stands - all the social science in the worlds gets results only when: You act. 
 
You must take action to get the kinds of results you want. The crux of that is developing 
your social skills through interaction - getting out there and meeting the kind of women you 
want. As for academic exercises, the #1 thing you can do is this: 
 
Make a list of everything you'd want in a woman. Go ahead, spell out your ideal. Imagine a 
genie popped out of a bottle, and asked you, "What is your ideal woman? You may have any-
thing you like, but anything you do not specify will be left to chance." 
 
List it. List it all. Write it down. 
 
Then go through and figure out which of those traits is negotiable for you. You ideal 
woman might be a tall, blond girl who cooks amazing French cuisine, loves art, is very feminine 
and nurturing, and has traveled extensively. 
 
Which of those is negotiable for you? If she has the rest of the package, but can not cook, 
does that work for you? There is no right or wrong answer. Society suggest what men and 
women should evaluate each other based on, but your own criteria - in the end - is up to you. 
And if you're really stuck on blond hair, don't be worried that others might judge you harshly. 
 
Just figuring out what you want will, in fact, will help you see it in the world. Much ado has 
been made of the power of manifestation over the last few years. Regardless if there is anything 
to it, one thing is certain - you'll spot things you think about in the world around you. You'll 
walk into a party, and the one girl you've been looking for will stand out to you. 
 
Remember you can intention map many traits of your ideal woman into a girl. Some things 
can't be changed - height for instance - but practically speaking, most men find specifics of ap-
pearance negotiable, but overall good health and grooming not. (Actually, too many men settle 
on women who aren't healthy or groomed well enough because they don't think they can do 
better - don't fall into that trap if you really do care) 
 
That's the #1 academic exercise for getting the kind of women you want. After that, you 
don't need to be socializing to develop things about yourself. Even if you build value into your 
life for the wrong reasons to start, it'll make you more valuable. Many a man starts lifting 
weights to get a physique that would attract women. The thinking there is faulty - it's the 
"wrong reason" to do it - but the fact stands, you'll evolve out of the faulty thinking if you 
choose to stay with it.

WHERE TO MEET WOMEN? 
 
Anywhere! Remember to be situationally relevant, and go for it anywhere. Venues built for 
socializing (bars, nightclubs, cafes) are well-suited for generally social opening. "Real life" ven-
ues, you'll need a reason to engage her in conversation. One of the best is, of course, showing 
genuine interest in her. Making observations on the world around you works well too. 
 
Make a point of turning "wasted time" into time to socialize. Do so on train rides, the sub-
way/underground, in airports, and while waiting for people. Socialize while in line to get pop-
corn at the movie theatre or to buy a burger at the local burger joint. If you work in a major met-
ropolitan city, make a point of taking lunch at places where you can seat yourself, and make a 
point of never eating alone. 
 
Then go fail! 
 
One of the largest predictors of success is failure. Any man that's ever been good at any-
thing has learned and grown from failure. But this word, failure, is not even the right word. 
There are only two potential outcomes to any situation: Success, or an opportunity to learn 
from. 
 
It must be emphasized again and again that to get results, you will fail. But here's some 
numbers you might enjoy: 
 
There's somewhere in the ballpark of 4 billion women worldwide. 
 
4,000,000,000 - Number of women worldwide 
 
Four BILLION. 
 
Of those, the top 10% of women worldwide are a staggering 400 million. 
 
400,000,000 
 
The top 1% of women: Forty million! 
 
40,000,000 
 
Isn't that amazing? The highest quality, most elite beautiful women in the world. Forty mil-
lion.

Population of New York City in 2000: 
 
8,008,278 
 
That's right. There's enough elite women to fill all of New York 5 times over. Not all of Man-
hattan - All of New York. All the Boroughs. All of Harlem, all of Queens, all of Brooklyn, all of 
the Bronx, all of Chinatown and Wall Street, and Times Square. 
 
Population of London: 
 
7,465,100 
 
Population of Tokyo: 
 
12,369,000 
 
Imagine the biggest cities in the entire world, filled entirely with absolutely amazingly 
beautiful women. That's how many women there are in the world. 
 
So don't get too hung up on one, eh? It's amazingly unattractive (and ignorant) to think that 
there's only one person you can be happy with. The fact is, there are many women across the 
entire world that you could learn and grow and continue to get better with. The top .1% of the 
world: 4 million women. Of those 4 million, no more than 3 million are taken by theApproach 
personnel and alumni, which leaves a cool million for you to pick one you enjoy and get along 
with. 
 
So figure out everything you want. She's out there. And just by becoming aware of what 
you're after, you'll notice it more and also draw it out in people. 
 
Then get out there and fail! Every day a new girl turns 18, 31, 25, 30, 36, 42 - whatever you're 
looking for, she's out there. Every day many beautiful women move. The price of a "failure" is a 
quick sting to the ego and a potential lesson to learn from. Success can mean having a life-
changing experience with a beautiful, caring, nurturing girl. 
 
So get out there and socialize!

Thanks for reading theAttraction Handbook. Just do me one favor - Go ap-
ply these techniques, huh? This project is the culmination of thousands of hours 
of fieldwork and hundreds of writing and editing. Go put it to use, and see 
what it can do for your life. I do this because I love seeing people get results, 
and it's very possible for anyone to get the kind of results the like. Literally mil-
lions of beautiful women are out there, and with practice you can find one or 
more great lovers for yourself. 
 
 
Good luck and God bless,
