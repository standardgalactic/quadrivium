Executive Summary
Executive Summary
Background
The private housing sector is a key contributor to the well-being of citizens and the growth of the New 
Zealand economy. For instance, Infometrics (2012) finds that investment in owner-occupied dwellings 
accounts for 6.8 percent of the nation’s GDP. Issues of a lack of supply, fragmented industry structure, 
overall risk-averse attitudes, a general reluctance to innovation, skills shortages, a slow take-up of 
sustainability and a less-than-responsive planning system are prevalent in the New Zealand housing sector 
as identified by the New Zealand Productivity Commission (2012). The Commission further identifies 
the poor performance of the building and construction industry as one of the key contributors to the 
prevailing housing affordability problems. The Commission was convinced that “better productivity can 
increase housing affordability by improving the quality of building work and by reducing construction 
costs which generally account for half of a typical house and land package, depending on the land value”. 
(p. 171). 
More importantly, improvement in the productivity performance of the residential construction sector 
has significant implication for the wider economy. For instance, a 10% increase in the productivity of the 
building and construction sector results in a 1% increase in the New Zealand’s GDP or a lift in value of 
approximately $1.5 billion annually (Building and Construction Productivity Partnership, nd). Moreover, 
every dollar investment in the construction sector translates to three dollars of economic activity in 
other sectors of the New Zealand economy (Building and Construction Productivity Partnership, nd). 
There is therefore the need to research the potential ways of improving productivity gains in the RBLC. 
Purpose
This study aims to investigate the potential productivity increase leverage points in the phases of the 
multi-unit residential building life cycle (RBLC) to establish where the biggest productivity improvements 
could be made. The key objective of the study is to find answers to the following research questions.
1.	 What does productivity mean to the research participants?
2.	 What are the relative levels of contribution of the phases in the housing production and disposal 
process to the overall productivity outcomes in the RBLC?
3.	 What are the productivity/efficiency limiting factors at each phase and for the whole cycle, 
and how could these be addressed?
4.	 Where do the potentials for the biggest productivity improvements exist in the RBLC and how 
could productivity be improved, overall?

Executive Summary
Method
The study focused on investigating how key role-players could constrain or enhance productivity in order 
to gain an understanding of the key productivity barriers and enablers in the cycle.
Personal interviews were conducted with 38 key role-players involved in the various phases of the RBLC. 
The entire research design and implementation was based on progressive focusing (Parlett and Hamilton, 
1976; Anderson, 2003). This approach permitted the adjustments of the data collection process to include 
the investigation of new concepts or relationships as the bigger picture became clearer with additional 
insights gained from the interviewees’ progressive feedback.
Purposive sampling (Patton, 1990; Morse, 1991) was the most appropriate for the nature and purpose 
of the study. This allowed the recruitment of stakeholders who could give authoritative feedback on the 
subject matter, who were abreast with the issues on ground through their current involvement in the 
building process, and “who were articulate, reflective and willing to share with the interviewer” (Coyne, 
1997; p. 624). The interviewees were recruited in a snowballing fashion through leads provided by those 
previously interviewed, followed by visits to 24 residential building sites in different parts of the Auckland 
region where the researchers interviewed the owners, the builders and other key role-players.
At the end of the interviews, feedback was analysed using concept categorisation, involving content 
analysis, frequency counting, and descriptive statistics. The content analysis (Patoton, 1990) was used 
to establish the recurrence of important constructs or themes in the interviewees’ feedback. The multi-
attribute technique was used for the analysis of the ratings made by the interviewees (Tronchim, 2006 
and Saunders et al., 2006). Both methods facilitated numerical analysis by frequency counts and graphical 
displays of the results for better visual appreciation and interpretations. 
Results
Perceptions of productivity
In order to put participants’ feedback in context, their understanding of the concept was first explored 
by simply asking the question: “In your role in the residential building process, what does productivity 
mean to you?” Analysis of the interviewees’ feedback yielded the following 3 key components for a 
project-level definition of productivity:
--
‘Efficiency’: this is the economic perspective of productivity, focusing on the optimal use of 
resources. This aligns with the output-input schema, where the overall focus is to “achieve more 
(output) with less (input)”. This perspective of productivity was mentioned 39% of the time; 
meaning that the economic perspective on productivity is not widely shared by the stakeholders 
as a key component of productivity at the project level.

Executive Summary
--
‘Effectiveness’: This is the ability to achieve set objectives. In the project context, the objectives 
are cost/budget, time/schedule, scope and quality. This is more of a performance issue and 
perhaps, explains why the terms ‘productivity’ and ‘performance’ are used in tandem. This 
perspective was mentioned 35% of the time. 
--
Sundry items: The participants also expected productivity to involve the achievement of 
other indicators of performance such as safety, client satisfaction, relationships (including 
absence of disputes/litigations), workforce satisfaction, reputation (for performance), future 
job orders, and regulatory/statutory compliance. These sundry items accounted for about 26% 
of the recurring themes in the interviewees’ expectation or understanding of the concept of 
productivity. 
Overall, the concept of productivity was seen as a metric for assessing the extent to which value has 
been delivered. The ‘value’ in this case may mean different things to different stakeholders depending on 
their value system. However, a general understanding of the value is the extent to which the set targets 
or objectives have been achieved on one hand, and the extent to which the available resources have 
been optimised in the delivery process, on the other hand. To survey participants, productivity is at its 
optimum level if the set targets have been achieved, while utilising the minimum amount of resources 
possible in the process. This is important because it goes further than the output-input perspective 
of the economist which focuses solely on the quantum of output per unit of resource inputs (Davis, 
2007). Except where the output-input ratio constitutes the objective to be achieved or the set target, the 
economist’s perspective misses out on the ‘performance’ aspect of the focus on value delivery. Having a 
balanced view of productivity ensures that productivity improvements are not made by scarifying the 
quality of the finished building, which might well be the case if all that is focussed on is the having more 
output with less input without caring for the quality of the output. 
Relative levels of contribution of the phases to the overall productivity outcomes in the RBLC
The study proceeded with the proposition that RBLC could be segregated into nine interdependent 
phases: the inception, design, documentation, construction, close-out/commissioning, operation & 
maintenance, upgrade/conversions, and decommissioning phases. However, productivity measurements 
in the RBLC occur at the end of four points in the cycle: 1) the development phase (which is marked by 
the close-out/commissioning stage), 2) the preventative and corrective maintenance stages within the 
operation and maintenance phases, 3) the upgrade/conversion phase, and 4) the decommissioning (i.e. 
deconstruction and disposal) phases. The inception and design phases of the RBLC were found to offer 
the greatest potentials for productivity increase leverage as the decisions made at these two phases set the 
parameters that define the building characteristics and the delivery outcomes at the development phase 
as well as the subsequent performance of the building at the operation and maintenance, conversions 
and decommissioning phases.

Executive Summary
Productivity/efficiency limiting factors in the RBLC
Overall, four key role players were perceived to be the greatest influencers of the outcomes of productivity 
and performance in the RBLC. In order of influence, these are: the designers; building owner; project 
manager; and the builder, with the local councils coming in as the fifth most influential role player. 
The critical areas of influence of these key role players on the productivity outcomes in the RBLC are 
summarised as follows.
Key areas of the building owner’s influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes
These comprise brief and strategic choices in 4 key areas (4Ps):
1.	 Place: Location characteristics and their impact on the development costs, building value and 
capital appreciation rate at the in-use phase.
2.	 Product: Building characteristics and their impact on development, operation and maintenance 
costs throughout the RBLC.
3.	 Process: Project preferences and specifications, and their impact on the development risks 
and costs. 
4.	 Performance: Performance metrics (KPIs), management and outcome monitoring, and their 
impact on the development risks and costs at the development phases.
Key areas of the designer’s influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes
1.	 Quality of brief articulation and design development.
2.	 Appropriateness of material selection and specifications.
3.	 Quality of design information documentation and communication.
Project management influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes
Whether performed by the building owner, the designer or the builder, the quality of the project 
management role could impact significantly on the productivity outcomes in the RBLC in 6 ways:
1.	 Quality of planning and risk management.
2.	 Quality of project organisation.
3.	 Quality of project communication/information management.
4.	 Quality of the monitoring, reviewing and control of the performance of the service providers.
5.	 Quality of the coordination and supervision of the service providers.
6.	 Overall quality of the project leadership.

Executive Summary
Key areas of the builder’s influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes
1.	 Quality of construction planning and risk management.
2.	 Effectiveness and efficiency of site organisation & management.
3.	 Effectiveness of coordination & supervision subcontractors and own workforce.
4.	 Quality of progress monitoring; review & control of performance.
5.	 Level of regulatory and statutory compliance (RMA, HSEA, codes and standards, bylaws).
External factors’ influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes
The stakeholders have control over their own influences and can do something about these influences 
by addressing the issues highlighted in their roles and responsibilities. However, they have less control 
over the impact of the key external factors, which comprise the following:
--
Industry characteristics: 
o	 Boom-bust cycle; 
o	 composition/structure; dominance of small firms; 
o	 business model, capacity & capability issues; 
o	 attitude, culture and resistance to change; 
o	 skills shortage, 
o	  Margins/profitability; competition.
o	 technology & innovation.
--
Market conditions:
o	 Economic recession;
o	 Business/investor confidence; 
o	 Demand and supply for services and outputs;
o	 Availability of project finance.
--
Regulatory/statutory compliance: 
o	 RMA, HSEA, Local Government Act; Building Act; Council bylaws;
o	 Building codes, building standards;
o	 Resource and building consent issues;
o	 Land supply and development policies.
o	 Rapid rate of regulatory reforms.
By being mindful of, and by formulating adequate contingency plans for, these critical external factors, 
the stakeholders would be better positioned to significantly redress the prohibiting factors and lift 
productivity gains in the RBLC.

Executive Summary
Recommendations
To improve productivity in the RBLC, the following recommendations are put forward.
1.	 Key role players should take steps to rethink the identified key areas in which they negatively 
impact on productivity outcomes in the RBLC.
2.	 Adequate contingency plans should be put in place to cushion the negative impact of the 
external limiting factors.
3.	 The government and the industry should work together to address the key industry 
characteristics, market conditions and the regulatory/statutory compliance issues which limit 
the ability of the stakeholders to innovate and improve productivity. 
4.	 The building owner’s proclivity to design customisation and frequent change orders should be 
discouraged through professional advice on the negative impact on costs, scope, completion 
time and value of the finished property.
5.	 The building consent processes should be made cheaper and fast-tracked through initiatives 
such as online consenting, streamlined BCA operations and greater use of the standard, multi-
proof building designs. 
6.	 The owner-builder exemption to the restricted building work regime should be re-considered 
given its tendency to result in low productivity and a return to the era of leaky building in 
the near future.

Executive Summary
7.	 Greater use of the CodeMark product certification scheme to provide a wider range of materials 
and components for use by designers to deliver more economic, flexible, innovative, productive 
and environmentally friendly design solutions to satisfy a variety of end-user requirements. 
8.	 Encourage the involvement of home-builders who have in-house design, management and 
construction capacity to provide one-stop design and build service to the owner. This contrasts 
with the current domination by volume builders who do not have the technical expertise of 
home-building to effectively coordinate and manage the quality of work and performance of 
the specialist tradespeople engaged to deliver the job.
9.	 Greater use of off-site manufacturing system to improve quality, speed, life cycle costs, 
productivity and sustainability in the home building sector.
Implications of the findings for industry practice, education and research
The findings of this study provide rich insights into residential building procurement process, new house 
building process, productivity measurement in construction, building life cycle phases, and the key role 
players in the building development process and their influences on productivity at their respective 
phases of operation in the residential building life cycle. Key beneficiaries of the practical and theoretical 
knowledge provided in this report include industry practitioners, researchers, teachers and learners in 
tertiary education in the field of residential property development. Building Control Officers, property 
consultants, property researchers, project managers, building contractors, quantity surveyors, architects, 
teachers and learners in the field of construction management, quantity surveying, real estate, building 
science, architecture and town and regional planning will benefit from this work.

Introduction
Introduction
This exploratory study focused on the assessment of the productivity increase leverage points in the 
multi-unit residential building life cycle (RBLC) phases. It was largely based on the information provided 
via personal interviews with a number of key stakeholders involved at the various phases of the RBLC. 
Insights from the literature were also added to improve clarity of the issues being discussed.
The Report presents the results of the 38 personal interviews held with key role-players in the residential 
building development cycle, including owners, builders, specialist tradespeople, property consultants, 
developers, building inspectors, architects, and engineers. The interviews were aimed at assessing the 
productivity limiting factors in the RBLC phases and the recommendations for productivity improvement. 
The Report is divided into seven sections. Section 1 provides the background to the study; it details the 
terms of reference, purpose and scope of the study. Section 2 highlights the context of the study within 
an overarching construction systems research and the systems mapping project commissioned by Scion 
in collaboration with BRANZ. Section 3 focuses on the research problem and the conceptual issues that 
underpin the thrust of the study. Section 4 presents the research method for the study, including the scope 
of investigations, and how the empirical data was gathered and analysed. Section 5 is for the key results 
and their discussions in relation to the research objectives. The section also explores the productivity 
increase leverage points at each phase based on the relative levels of influence of the stakeholders at the 
phases. Section 6 is for the conclusions and the recommendations for actions. 
Disclaimer
The report recommends actions that could be undertaken to improve productivity at each phase of 
the RBLC. Before these could be considered as support for formulating policy and action plan, it is 
recommended that the findings be validated at an industry workshop where other stakeholders will 
be given the opportunity to make further inputs, including confirming, disconfirming, adding to or 
amending the findings to improve their reliability and buy-in by the industry. 
The project was exploratory in nature; the scope of the investigations was shallow and the data points 
were limited in size. As a result, the findings, and the conclusions and recommendations flowing them, 
may be used with caution, as they may not be generalised beyond the study scope. In addition, the study 
was a snapshot of opinions at a given point in time. The information contained in this report therefore 
has a high degree of uncertainty for future applications; it will be subject to change as new trends and 
opinions emerge.

1.1	
Terms of reference
The key task for the Massey academic staff participating in the research was to undertake a case study 
as part of the overarching systems mapping project aimed at identifying the points in the RBLC where 
potential opportunities exist for improving productivity in the cycle.
The case study involved stakeholders at the various phases of the RBLC with a focus on the following:
1.	 Assessing the potentials for improving productivity at each phase, and for the whole RBLC of 
the case study projects. 
2.	 Identifying productivity/efficiency limiting factors at each phase, and for the whole RBLC of 
the case study projects. 
3.	 Compiling a report on the outcomes of the case study, including making recommendations 
for improvement.
Study team
The Productivity Increase Leverage Points in the RBLC Scoping Study was led by Dr Jasper Mbachu of 
the School of Engineering and Advanced Study (SEAT), Massey University at Albany. Doctoral research 
students – Myzatul Kamarazaly and Wajiha Shahzad – assisted with the fieldwork. The Study was project-
managed by Dr Jeff Seadon and funded by SCION and BRANZ.
1.2	
Purpose of the study
The study report is expected to provide the Building and Construction Sector Productivity Partnership 
with an empirical basis on which to consider for further scrutiny, the priority actions required to improve 
productivity in the key phases of the RBLC, as part of the overall strategic agenda of improving the 
construction industry productivity by 20% by 2020. 
1.3	
Scope of the study
Investigations were limited to site-based personal interviews with builders and home owners on building 
sites, and phone interviews with developers, council officials and consultants.
As an exploratory study with no pre-determined sampling frames, snowballing technique was used 
to identify potential residential building sites for the site-based interviews through leads provided by 
participants as more building sites were visited. The first study period was from the middle of March 
to the first week of October 2012. The second study period was from the middle of February to end 
of June 2013. Follow-up interviews were carried out at random to seek further clarifications on some 
important concepts that emerged from the analysis.

Background
In total the residential buildings covered in this study comprised 24 buildings/sites in Auckland. The 
buildings were a mix of 3–4 bedroom bungalows and duplexes grouped as follows. 
• Group 1 case study buildings: residential buildings being currently developed. (10 buildings 
sites involved: 3 building sites comprised 18 standalone duplexes on standard designs; 7 
building sites on bespoke architectural designs, comprising 4 standalone bungalows (4 sites) 
and 3 standalone duplexes (3 sites)).
• Group 2 case study buildings: residential buildings currently in use (6 standalone buildings);
• Group 3 projects: residential buildings currently renovated or upgraded. (5 standalone 
buildings involved);
• Group 4 projects: residential buildings currently decommissioned (i.e. deconstructed and 
recycled. 3 standalone buildings involved).
The Groups 2 to 4 buildings were constructed within the post-2000 or post-2005 era.

Background
The standard designs in Group 1 buildings were project-managed by design and build group home 
builders. Two of the 7 buildings on bespoke designs in the Group 1 buildings were managed by the 
owners, while the 5 others were managed by small builders. The standard designs were relatively 
complex and comprised largely panellised offsite manufactured systems. The owner-managed bespoke 
designs were also complex in terms of the shapes and forms, and were largely traditional stick-built 
types. The builder-managed bespoke designs were not so complex; pre-nailed frames were used for the 
wall, floor and roof framings. The Group 2 buildings were recently completed with the owners/users 
moving in the 6–8 months following completion. The maintenance issues experienced were part of the 
emerging defects covered under the Warrantee/Guarantees. These included plumbing and electrical 
fixings, door hinge problems and other minor defects being fixed by plumbers, electricians and builders 
who completed the buildings. The Group 3 buildings were relatively old buildings. It was not possible to 
establish the age of the buildings from the owners who claimed they bought the buildings some years 
ago. The renovation or upgrade works were largely the ceiling and underfloor insulation and heating 
installation with financial assistance under the EECA’s “Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart” programme. 
Being qualified under the scheme, the houses might have been built before 2000. The owners said they 
received $1,300 from the Energywise funding towards the cost of the installation. The key incentive was 
the ability to pay the remaining balance (about 67%) of the installation costs at a rate of $7–10 per week 
as part of their mortgage repayments or council rates for a 10-year payment period. In addition to the 
insulation installation, the renovation work in two of the houses included external wall reclad against 
leaky problems. The Group 4 buildings were demolished to pave way for new duplexes as at the time 
of conducting the survey. Though the ages of the buildings were not established, the demolition was to 
maximise the land value for higher quality developments. Overall, the selection of the buildings was for 
exploratory study and not necessarily for quantitative representations of the various classes of buildings. 
Patton (1990), Sage (2010) and Cresswell (2010) note that the key aim of exploratory study is to explore 
constructs or themes for theory-building, while quantitative studies focus on theory-testing and involve 
representative sampling for use in generalising outcomes beyond the study scopes.

Context Of The Study
2	 Context Of The Study
2.1	
Overarching research initiative
To address the issue of low productivity in the building and construction sector, the Productivity 
Partnership – a partnership between the industry and the government – was established in November 
2010, with a goal to transform the way the sector works in order to build value and raise the sector’s 
productivity by 20% by 2020. The partnership was established following the recommendations of the 
Building and Construction Sector Productivity Taskforce which identified the low productivity issues 
in the industry in 2009 (DBH, 2009). The taskforce was established by the Minister of Building and 
Construction in August 2008 with the goal of researching the issues and making recommendations on 
how to bring about a turn-around to the declining productivity of the building and construction sector, 
paying particular attention to sector skills and procurement. The taskforce concluded its mission and 
reported back in late July 2009 with comprehensive recommendations on issues impacting on the sector’s 
productivity and solutions for improvement, including a suggestion for a joint industry/government 
approach to resolve the issues, collaboratively. The Partnership was given birth to, on account of this 
suggestion.
2.2	
Industry processes
This research theme was motivated by lack of understanding of industry processes. This gap in information 
documentation has been identified as part of the barriers to improving the sector performance (Davies, 
2007; DBH, 2009; Mbachu and Durdyev, 2011). A systems mapping project was commissioned to 
understand the construction systems involved in the production of different types of buildings at every 
stage of their life from their conception, client brief, design, consenting and construction through to their 
use, maintenance and demolition. This work also involves case study research of successful construction 
projects. The emphasis is on determining those aspects of individual projects that either contributed to 
or compromised the effectiveness and efficiency of the resources applied to the project.

Research Problem And Conceptual Issues
3	 Research Problem And 
Conceptual Issues
3.1	
Overview
This section highlights the background, the research problem statement, the research aim, the research 
questions and the research objectives. The section also sets out the conceptual issues that underpinned the 
study based on the international literature. These insights were tested for relevance in the New Zealand 
context during the exploratory surveys. 
3.2	
Background to the research problem
The private housing sector is a key contributor to the New Zealand economy. For instance, Infometrics 
(2012) finds that investment in owner-occupied dwellings accounts for 6.8% of the nation’s GDP. As at 
2010, the New Zealand housing stock was valued at approximately $600 billion – which was 12 times 
greater than the $50 billion capital value of the New Zealand share market (DBH, 2010). The value as 
at the first quarter of 2013 was $672 billion (RBNZ, 2013); this indicated value addition of roughly $72 
billion over the 3 year period from 2010 to 2013; i.e. an annual increase in value of about $24 billion. In 
the building and construction sector, new developments and refurbishment were expected to cost $15 
billion annually (Brealey, 2012). This shows that shifts in the market dynamics contribute only $7 billion 
or 37 percent annually to the growth in the value of the housing stock, while physical development (i.e. 
land and buildings) accounts for the majority, i.e. about 63 percent – of the annual value increment. 
The Productivity Commission (2012) puts the section prices as 60 percent of the cost of new dwelling. 
That means that 40 percent is for the construction, which still accounts for a significant proportion of 
the total cost of new dwelling. Productivity improvement in the RBLC could therefore contribute to a 
significant reduction of the house development and refurbishment costs and improve value addition 
in the residential sector. More importantly, productivity improvement in the housing subsector could 
translate to improvement in the productivity of the building and construction sector as well as for the 
overall economy. This is evident from the fact that a 10 percent increase in the productivity of the building 
and construction sector results in a 1 percent increase in the New Zealand’s GDP or a lift in value of 
approximately $1.5 billion annually (Building and Construction Productivity Partnership, nd). More 
over, every dollar investment in the construction sector translates to three dollars of economic activity 
in New Zealand (Building and Construction Productivity Partnership, nd). There is therefore the need 
to research the potential ways of improving productivity gains in the RBLC.

Research Problem And Conceptual Issues
3.3	
Research aim, questions and objectives
The key objective of the study is to find answers to the following research questions.
1.	 What are the relative levels of contribution of the phases in housing production and disposal 
that contribute to the overall productivity outcomes in the RBLC?
2.	 What are the productivity/efficiency limiting factors at each phase and for the whole cycle and 
how could these be addressed?
3.	 Where do the potentials for the biggest productivity improvements exist in the RBLC and how 
could productivity be improved, overall?
3.4	
Productivity in context
Productivity is a complex phenomenon to define (CAPCUCI, 2009). The New Zealand Building and 
Construction Sector Productivity Partnership (BCSPP, 2012) identifies the key underpinnings of 
‘increased productivity’ as including the following:
--
More outputs for fewer or the same inputs. 
--
Better value for customers at a competitive price. 
--
More efficient procurement of resources.
--
Increased standardisation. 
--
Design and build for whole-of-life.
--
The right type and level of skills.
--
Greater use of technology and innovation.
Though the above criteria point more to the benefits or outcomes of ‘increased productivity’ rather than 
its definition, they nonetheless provide insights to the whole essence of productivity in the context that 
resonates well with the industry understanding of the concept.

Figure 1: Conceptual framework for the study
Focus on the RBLC phases and the key role players
The focus on the RBLC phases and the key role players started by asking two key questions: 
a)	 What are the relative levels of influence of the decisions made at the phases on the overall 
RBLC productivity outcomes? The data was analysed to give the relative contribution of 
each phase to the overall productivity outcome, using the expression for the Relativity Index 
(Equation 2 in the Data Analysis section The outcome of this analysis became the input data 
for further analysis, which further looked at the phase(s) that contributed to the 80% of the 
RBLC productivity outcomes; 
b)	 Who are the role players at each phase? In what ways do they influence the phase and the overall 
RBLC productivity outcomes? The results of the influence analysis revealed the key role players 
having most profound influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes. The ways in which these 
key role players influence productivity then became the focus of in-depth inquiry with a view to 
discovering where the biggest opportunities exist for productivity increase leverage in the cycle.

Focus on the external influential factors in the operating environment
The second focus on the operating environment started by asking two key questions: 
a)	 What are the productivity/efficiency limiting factors in the operating environment of the 
residential building? In what ways do they influence the RBLC productivity outcomes? These 
questions prompted the interviewees to reflect on the nature and impact of the factors in the 
operating environment which were beyond the control of the stakeholders in the RBLC. A copy 
of the interview schedule is included in the Appendix. It should be noted that the interviews were 
partly by face-to-face with the site-based building owners, builders and specialist tradespeople, 
and by phone with the other role-placers such as the designers, council officials, developers 
and consultants. The questions were structured in terms of the issues for which feedback was 
needed. The relative levels of influence of each role player on the overall RBLC productivity 
outcome were analysed using Equation 2. The results of this analysis were subjected to further 
analysis which helped identify the top influential role players having profound influences on 
the RBLC productivity outcomes; 
b)	 What tasks do the role players perform at each phase, and how does each task influence 
productivity outcomes at a particular phase and for the entire RBLC? This analysed the relative 
levels of influence of each role player’s task on the productivity outcome of the associated 
phase, using Equation 2. The results of the influence analysis revealed the critical tasks having 
profound influence on their respective phase productivity levels. 
1.	 The critical activities of the priority phases were associated to the top influential role players 
for accountability purposes. 
2.	 The needed improvement in the critical activities of the priority phases were associated with 
the top influential role players. 
3.	 The findings of the investigations in step 4 above informed recommendations about the 
productivity increase leverage strategies in the RBLC.
This scoping study identified the RBLC phases and the activities required at each phase. It has also 
identified the role players at each phase and their roles (Table 1). 
The second stage of the project focused on obtaining feedback from interview participants. Part of the 
feedback included rating of the relative levels of influence of the identified phases, activities, role players 
and their roles on productivity at each phase and for the overall RBLC.

Research Method
It should be noted that some researchers such as Babbie (2005) and Reips and Funke (2008) make 
an important distinction between a ‘Likert scale’ and a ‘Likert item’. The ‘Likert scale’ is the sum of 
responses on several ‘Likert items’. Thus, whereas the Likert item could be one-dimensional, the Likert 
scale is multi-dimensional and could be subjected to multi-variate or multi-attribute analysis. However, 
Reips and Funke (2008) caution about the inherent drawback in use of Likert rating scale measures for 
quantitative analysis, which is the assumption that the ordinal nature of the Likert scale measures are 
as good as interval-scale measures. However, the authors found that this assumption is permissible only 
where the Likert scale is symmetric or balanced with equal amounts of Likert items on opposite sides of 
the scale from a transition or neutral position. Otherwise, the Likert items should be rescaled to interval 
scale using Correspondence analysis. The 5-point Likert scale used in the study satisfies the symmetric 
or balanced scale which requires no rescaling to interval scale. 
Further details about the data analysis are provided under the Data Analysis subsection.

Research implementation process
The research implementation followed a seven-step process as shown in Figure 2. It started with the 
agreement on the Terms of Reference and scope, through scoping study report to empirical study, final 
report and dissemination of research findings.

Case studies: Research strategy and action plan
Research strategy
A three-phase approach was adopted in the empirical data gathering for the study. In the first phase, 
pilot interviews were held with a sample of nine stakeholders involved in the RBLC. These comprised 
a building owner, a developer, an architect, an engineer, a builder, a specialist tradesperson, a project 
manager, a quantity surveyor, a building control officer, and a property manager. The purpose of the 
pilot interviews were to generate constructs for the design of the interview schedule for a larger survey 
of stakeholders as planned for the study. 
In the second phase, the survey instrument was tested for clarity and relevance with another set of 
volunteers comprising a developer, an architect and a builder. The pre-testers’ feedback formed the basis 
for fine-tuning the interview schedule to improve its appeal to the participants in the larger survey. 
The third phase surveys involved case studies of residential buildings at the various phases of the building 
life cycle. For each case study project, one-on-one interviews were conducted with the key stakeholders as 
detailed in Table 1. Using an open-ended but structured interview schedule feedback was received from 
the survey participants. The interview questions sought the stakeholders’ perceptions on the following:
1.	 The concept of productivity. This was to enable the interviewee to qualify his or her responses 
to the ensuing questions based on his or her understanding of the concept.
2.	 Productivity/efficiency limiting factors in the RBLC phases and their sources. The interviewees 
were prodded to reflect on three streams of issues: 
a)	 the role players at the RBLC phases and their influences on the productivity outcomes at 
their phases and the overall cycle; 
b)	 the external factors and their impacts on the RBLC productivity outcomes; and 
c)	 General comments on how to lift productivity in the cycle.
The interviewees’ responses included some form of ratings on the relative levels of impact or contributions 
of the constraints on the phase and overall productivity outcomes in the RBLC. Aggregation of the 
feedback from the 19 stakeholders across the 24 case study projects plus an additional 21 interviewees 
at a second stage interview sessions, yielded data for analysis with a view to providing answers to the 
research questions, as well as insights on the productivity increase leverage points at each phase and for 
the overall building life cycle.

Method
Since the productivity outcomes at each phase and for the overall RBLC are influenced by the actions or 
inactions of the key role-players operating at the particular phase (DBIS, 2010; Mbachu and Nkado, 2007), 
the study focused on investigating how these key role-players could constrain or enhance productivity 
in order to gain an understanding of the key productivity barriers and enablers in the cycle.
The exploratory nature of the investigations necessitated the use of personal interviews with 38 key role-
players involved in the various phases of the RBLC. The entire research design and implementation was 
based on progressive focusing (Parlett and Hamilton, 1976; Anderson, 2003). This approach permitted the 
adjustments of the data collection process to include the investigation of new concepts or relationships 
as the bigger picture became clearer with additional insights gained from the interviewees’ progressive 
feedback.
Among the various sampling methods in qualitative research, the purposive sampling technique (Patton, 
1990; Morse, 1991) was found most appropriate for the nature and purpose of the study. This allowed 
the recruitment of stakeholders who could give authoritative feedback on the subject matter, who were 
abreast with the issues on ground through their current involvement in the building process, and “who 
were articulate, reflective and willing to share with the interviewer” (Coyne, 1997; p. 624). With no 
pre-defined sampling frame for the study, the bulk of the interviewees were recruited in a snowballing 
fashion through leads provided by those previously interviewed, followed by visits to 24 residential 
building sites in different parts of the Auckland region where the researchers were able to successfully 
negotiate access to interview the owners the builders and other key role-players.
At the end of the interviews, feedback was analysed using two key methods of qualitative data analysis: 
concept categorisation using content analysis and frequency counting using descriptive statistics. The 
content analysis involving the conceptual and relational forms of analysis (Patoton, 1990) was used to 
establish the recurrence of important constructs or themes in the interviewees’ feedback. The multi-
attribute technique was used for the analysis of the ratings made by the interviewees. Tronchim (2006) 
and Saunders et al. (2006) recommend this method as a valid approach for simplifying and presenting 
quantitative data or feedback in a manageable form. Both methods facilitated numerical analysis by 
frequency counts and graphical displays of the results for better visual appreciation and interpretations. 
Sage (2010) recommends combining different qualitative methods to take advantage of in depth study of 
phenomena, yet permitting some form of quantitative analysis to enrich understanding of the meaning 
inherent in the qualitative data. Cresswell (2010) and Anderson (2003) prefer calling this approach the 
‘mixed method’ of research.

Data analysis
As indicated above, the empirical data collected at the third phase of this study were analysed using the 
multi-attribute analytical technique. Two parameters were evaluated to obtain the relative contributions 
or the relative influences required in the conceptual framework: the mean rating (MR), and the relativity 
index (RI). 
Mean rating (MR)
This analysis involved analysing the ratings of the survey participants to establish the mean rating (MR) 
for each attribute in a set that represented the combined ratings of all the respondents. The ranking of 
the attributes in the set was based on the MR values. Mbachu (2008) provides the generic expression 
for the computation of the MR value (see Equation 1).

(Where: MRj = Mean Rating for attribute j; Rpjk = Rating point k (ranging from 1–5); Rjk% = percentage

Relativity Index (RI) 
The relativity Index (RI) was adapted from the relative importance index (RII) devised by Mbachu and 
Nkado (2007). Its purpose was to evaluate how the subcomponents contributed to the component level 
outcome. It was computed as a unit of the sum of mean ratings (MRs) of the subcomponents within a 
set of variables. Equation 2 is an expression for the RI.

Figure 3: Relating project and building life cycles
Figure 3 illustrates the project (i.e. the development) cycle as a subset of the product (i.e. the residential 
building) life cycle. The project life cycle starts with the owner’s need for a building. Mbachu and Nkado 
(2006) identify three categories of owners and their procurement needs as follows.
--
Sell the building on completion (i.e. developer client), 
--
Put the building to rent or lease for investment (i.e. investor client), or 
--
Operate and maintain the building as a dwelling (i.e. owner-occupier).

The owner considers and communicates the type of building that could best address the need at the 
inception phase. The architect translates the owner’s brief on the need into drawings and specifications. 
The project cycle proceeds through contract documentation and planning to construction and close-
out/commissioning and ideally loops back to the conception phase. However, in practice, the completed 
building evolves from a project to a product at the end of the close-out stage. The building cycle continues 
beyond this stage into the operation and maintenance phase. While the project phase is relatively short 
(about one or two years depending on the scope and complexity of the building), the operation and 
maintenance phase is quite long (usually for 50 years or more). Two pathways emerge beyond the 
operation and maintenance phase. To maintain the true meaning of ‘cycle’, the building life cycle should 
be along the path to upgrade/conversion/renovation, which loops back to the procurement need. 
The path to deconstruction/disposal marks the terminal end of the building (from a product perspective) 
and the inception of another life cycle phase (from a process perspective). 
This study adopts the on-going building life cycle view as shown in Figure 3. This starts with the 
procurement need, through conception, design and construction to operation and maintenance and 
upgrade, and back to procurement need. The loop continues until the terminal or end of life stage when the 
building is decommissioned and deconstructed. Following the deconstruction, the building components 
could be re-used in future projects or recycled as part of the process of prefabrication or manufacture 
of materials and components for other buildings. The cycle continues with the re-development of the 
vacant land to meet the need for infrastructure in the future.
Interview participants’ feedback on the RBLC model
The survey participants at the three phases of the study confirmed that the model was valid for the New 
Zealand residential building context. Some participants suggested slight changes in the naming of some 
stages to improve clarity. In particular, phase 4 of the cycle was renamed to remove the ‘prefabrication’ in 
the original model title for this phase. This is because ‘prefabrication’ refers to a technological approach 
rather than the manufacture/supply of materials and components which this phase represents.
However, a number of the survey participants suggested that the model should be qualified as one out 
of three or four possible approaches to procuring a residential building as described below.

New house procurement routes

Results And Discussions
The interviewees indicated during the phase interview phase that about 90 percent of the residential 
stock in New Zealand was supplied via standardised designs provided by the group homebuilders. While 
only about 10 percent was built as customised designs produced from scratch by an architect. [However, 
the outcome of the second phase interviews adjusted the proportions of the buildings procured via the 
four approaches as shown in Figure 4]. Overall, the interviewees pointed out that the project life cycle 
modelled in Figure 3 represents more of the customised design approach. They further pointed out that 
the bulk of the productivity limiting issues were driven by the customised design and so the model was 
apt to the key thrust of the research. The developers pointed out that, except for fully built house sold 
on cash-and-carry basis, home owners would always modify the standardised designs thereby reducing 
the efficiency gains this approach offers, especially in relation to minimising consenting costs and time 
and reaping the benefits of economies of scale offered by bulk material purchase.

Figure 4: New house procurement routes: Classification by design type and project management role-player
5.3.1	
New house procurement routes: Classification by project management role player
The alternative routes to new build procurement in the residential sector may be one of three ways as 
shown in Figure 4. The details and implications for productivity outcomes are discussed in the following 
subsections. 
Owner-managed process
Feedback from the interviewees suggested that the owner-managed approach to residential building 
procurement used to be popular five years ago. However, this approach declined in popularity with the 
onset of the restricted building work regime. The interviewees generally believed that most owners lacked 
the technical and coordination skills required to successfully project-manage the building process and 
value delivery. The 5–10 percent occurrence shown in Figure 4 for this route comprised owners who had 
acquired experience building their own houses in the past and who felt confident of the process and the 
network connections involved. The owner’s lack of technical and coordination skills therefore presents 
a problem in terms of achieving productivity outcomes in the RBLC. The interviewees claimed that no 
two buildings are the same due to varying ground conditions, role players and operating environment. 
The building owner’s experience in a few instances of homebuilding is not enough to gain requisite 
skills in managing a diverse range of challenges in future building procurement. As a result, there will 
be serious project management gaps, risks and mistakes which could significantly constrain productivity 
outcomes in the process.

The choice of this route is set to increase in the future with the recent exemption of the owner-builder 
from the restricted building work regime. The recent passing of the Building Amendment Act 2012 by 
the Government aims, among other things, to reduce the cost of do-it-yourself (DIY) building work by 
removing regulatory hurdles (MBIE, 2012). The Act’s amendment included cutting red tape, speeding up 
the building consenting process by introducing Risk-Based Consenting. It therefore encourages DIYers to 
build or renovate their own homes, while offering protection to future purchasers of the property. In the 
process, the owner-builder is allowed to carry out building work but must take responsibility for that work 
and the work will be notified in the Public Information File held by the local authorities for inspection 
by the public and prospective building owners. Whether or not the encouragement of DIY building work 
would result in another era of systemic failure and declining productivity trend can only be a matter of 
guesswork and is worthy of future investigations. By and large, a number of the interviewees were of the 
opinion that the exemption of the owner-builder from the restricted building work regime – even with 
more plan checks and inspections by the local authorities over and above the current practice – does 
not assure that there will be no quality issues with the owner-builder work, especially with the proposed 
change of the Code Compliant Certificate to Consent Compliant Certificate, which means that certificate 
no longer assures of the quality of the building work and its compliance with the Building Code.

Builder-led procurement approach
Feedback from the interviews suggested that homeowners usually engage small homebuilders to project-
manage the building process where the owner requires significant input in the design process. This 
approach could have positive or negative impact on productivity, depending on the extent of the builder’s 
involvement in the design process. The interviewees hinted that usually the builder is given a set plan to 
build from without prior involvement in the design development. The interviewees maintained that the 
approach could be counter-productive on account of several issues such as the design not taking into 
consideration the builder’s preferred method of construction, buildability issues in the design, lack of 
design details, poor specifications and detailing errors. Another key concern raised was that the designers 
often do not do proper site investigations and analysis and adjust the design to the specific conditions 
of the site, especially as it relates to ground conditions. Resolving such incongruities between the design 
and site characteristics often results in time and cost overruns due to re-consenting, re-designing and 
abortive work. To avoid such problems and gain productivity, the interviewees suggested having proper 
geotechnical investigations of the site and also having the builders take control of or be actively involved 
in the entire development process from design and consenting to construction and close-out. This also 
helps to sort out the issues about accountability in the development process which often takes expensive 
and time consuming adjudication and litigation processes to resolve. Alternatively, the design and build 
or design and manage functions should be integrated by having the architect being in charge of the 
design as well as the supervision of the build process to ensure that all design issues are sorted very 
quickly as and when they arise. This approach may require reverting to the era where the architects used 
to be the ‘leaders’ of the building team. However, many of the interviewees were not in support of this 
due to the perception that architects lack practical experience of the building process and often do not 
have the project management, business and networking skills of the builder for proper coordination and 
successful delivery of the complex building process. 
Developer-led approach to new house procurement 
This approach normally involves the developers offering to the prospective building owner standard 
plans only, standard plans plus specific sections, or land and fully built house. 
The interviewees indicated that on account of the robust marketing strategies and the land development 
knowledge of the developers, this approach to new house procurement is gaining prominence in New 
Zealand and is perceived to be the homeowner’s increasingly preferred route, especially where they are 
not too fussy about making lifestyle changes to the standard plans or having significant input to the 
design and development process. Some interviewees hinted that the key driver for this is the developer’s 
ability to better manage and resolve issues around property unit titles, easements/right of access, and 
cross-lease terms, which often present serious productivity issues in the other approaches which are 
managed by the owner or the smaller builder.

The interviewees confirmed that the design and build process that is based on standard plans with little 
or no significant changes to the plans resolves some of the risks involved in the development process and 
ensures greater clarity around cost estimates and completion times. It also offers the greatest opportunity 
for productivity gains. On the other hand, the approach involving significant change to the standard 
designs (i.e. changes requiring new consenting) is still being followed in 20–30 percent of the cases. This 
was said to be driven by tendency of the owners to ask for the designs to be adapted to suit their unique 
tastes and preferences. However, the use of the standard plans with little or no modification to the design 
is likely going to increase in the future with the recent streamlined National Multiple-use Approval Service 
(NMAS) for volume builders, which was launched by the Government in 2010 (MBIE, 2012). The NMAS 
involves fast-tracking the building consents for standard, multiple-proof building designs. This saves time 
and money for the end-users/consumers and the builders. With the MultiProof designs, only site-specific 
conditions such as the substructure works need to be checked by local councils for code compliance. 
The MultiProof approval is usually given for standardised plan which is intended to be replicated for 
more than nine times within a period of 2 years. However, a building consent application involving the 
MultiProof design still requires a separate Certificate of Design Work by a certified design professional 
for any relevant site-specific parts of the design, and any customisations made to the MultiProof design. 
It was envisaged that this could halve the timeframe for building consent decisions from 20 to 10 days 
(MBIE, 2012). As a result, prospective building owners might be encouraged to avoid tweaking the 
standard designs in order to fully avail of the cost and time-savings offered by the use of the Multi-proof 
designs, thereby improving productivity significantly in the RBLC.
On the flipside, the interviewees indicated that the developer-led approach has some short-comings 
where it comes to implementing the standard designs. These shortcomings were claimed to be rooted in 
the developers being investors with marketing and general management skills. They often do not have 
in-depth technical building and construction management skills. They were viewed as having a hands-
off position when it comes to the actual building development process, with the technical services being 
subcontracted to franchise builders. The interviewees maintained that the resultant technical project 
management skills gap present some productivity issues, especially in relation to the project coordination, 
milestone tracking and quality assurance of the complex residential developments. These shortcomings 
could be addressed by engaging franchise builders who have a wealth of experience and the authority 
to resolve the challenges involved in the complex residential development cases. Overall, a number of 
the interviewees saw the developer as a middleman who merely increases costs through mark ups, while 
reducing the franchise builder’s margin. The offset to low margin is the assurance of steady work without 
the hassle of marketing and tending for jobs, which may be a waste of money at times, with the tender 
success rates being as low as 1 out of 10 jobs tendered for.

New house procurement routes: Classification by level of owner’s input into the design 
process
From the interviewees’ feedback, new house procurement route options may also be classified by the 
level of the prospective building owner’s input into the design process. As shown in Figure 4 the routes 
comprise the following:
--
Bespoke design 
--
Standard plan only
--
Land and standard plan package
--
Land and house package.
In the first phase of the interviews, the standard plan only and the land and standard plan package were 
considered as one approach. However, the second phase interviews revealed the subtle difference between 
the two, being that the standard design of the latter is specific to a particular section or plot of land for 
which building consent has been issued. The details are briefly described in the following subsections.

Bespoke design approach
This is the preferred approach to a prospective owner who desires to have the design tailored to his or 
her unique lifestyle preferences and for those would like to have a significant influence on the design 
process. The approach will involve the owner engaging an architect, an architectural draughtsman, a 
builder or a developer to design the building from the scratch to incorporate the owner’s requirements, 
site specific characteristics and the council requirements. The interviewees hinted that in this approach, 
the owners’ requirements usually conflict with the district and regional plan requirements, often requiring 
protracted and expensive building and resource consenting processes. Feedback from the interviewees 
suggested that the building owners – especially the first time and one-off procurers – often are not clear 
as to what is it they want at the onset; they usually find it difficult to make up their minds and often 
make frequent changes even after the concept design has been frozen. The interviewees pointed out that 
the owners’ delays in making and communicating critical decisions as to their requirements, and the 
frequent changes they make at critical stages of the design and construction process are at the root of 
the disputes, quality issues and the time and cost overruns which significantly impact on productivity 
outcomes in this procurement approach. 
The interviewees acknowledged that the owner’s inclination to customisation is understandable, given 
that for the majority of New Zealanders, homebuilding is the greatest investment of a lifetime and so 
they rightly deserve the right to influence the design to meet their lifestyle preferences. Notwithstanding 
the negative impact of the bespoke design on productivity outcomes, this approach to homebuilding 
is set to continue in the future and presents a hard challenge to deal with. However, educating and 
enlightening the prospective building owner on the negative implications may help reduce the degree of 
customisation and the rate and timing of changes in the implementation process. More importantly, the 
interviewees pointed out that the building owners do not understand blueprints and so the use of physical 
or computer models to convey the concept design solutions to the owner would aid understanding of 
the complex blueprint and enable them to make early decisions on whether or not the proposed design 
solutions meet their needs.
Standard plan only approach
The interviewees indicated that this approach is more popular than the bespoke design route. It involves 
the prospective building owner buying a standard plan from a builder or developer; the plan then gets 
modified to suit the owner’s desired changes, site characteristics and the local council requirements. 
However, the issue here is that the owner’s modifications might be to such an excessive extent as to make 
the bespoke design approach more economical. This is evident in the design resources that are wasted 
when significant part of the standard design is discarded, as well as the time and the associated costs 
involved in re-designing to suit.

Land and standard plan package
This approach is gaining momentum in Auckland and Christchurch with the group home builders and 
speculative developers responding to the increasing demand and prevailing acute shortage of houses in 
the New Zealand property market. It involves the owner buying land and standard plan package from 
the group home builder or speculative developer. The standard plan has been designed to meet a specific 
section site characteristics and local council requirements, and would normally have the building consent 
issued to the developer or group home builder. The prospective home owner may have the opportunity 
to make cosmetic changes that would not require amendments to the original consent that has been 
issued. This approach offers greater opportunity for productivity gains in the home building process by 
reducing the risks and time involved in the design and consenting process. The risks that may present 
in this approach are largely those of the construction process and the time and costs involved in the 
transfer of title to the new building owner. However, the productivity gains could be reduced where the 
owner prefers to make significant changes to the standard design as to require an amendment to the 
original consent. 
Turnkey/land and house package
As with the land and standard plan package, this approach is also gaining momentum as the group home 
builders and speculative developers respond to the increasing demand and prevailing acute shortage 
of house supply in New Zealand. The approach is also largely driven by the new streamlined National 
Multiple-use Approval Service (NMAS) for volume builders. It involves the prospective building owner 
buying a completed land and house package from a volume builder. As the name suggests, the prospective 
owner’s input in the procurement process is only to ‘turn the house keys’ after paying for it and having the 
conveyance deed completed. The interviewees acknowledged that this approach optimises productivity 
in the new home procurement process in three key ways:
1.	 It leverages off the economies of scale which volume house building offers in terms of the 
discounts from bulk material purchases and the reduction in the unit costs per house when the 
overhead costs are spread over a sufficient number of units. This helps to achieve a significant 
reduction in the development costs and improvement in housing affordability, as long as the 
developer is not intent on recouping all the gains as profit.
2.	 It eliminates the risks/uncertainties and the time and cost overruns involved in implementing 
a standard design. The only delay that could stand between the home owner and his or her 
home ownership dream is the timeframe taken to seal the deal including completing the deed 
of conveyance.
3.	 The approach also lends to standardisation, prefabrication and manufacturing processes in 
the home building sector. These novel approaches improve productivity through quality gains, 
reduction in wastages and environmental impact, improvement of health and safety and 
minimisation of the adverse effect of weather, all of which often constrain productivity gains 
in the other approaches to home building.

However, the downside of the approach is that the prospective building owner is not given the opportunity 
to bring to the table his or her unique lifestyle preferences in the building design, except where what is on 
offer meets these preferences – which is a rare occurrence. Also, the interviewees pointed out that such 
turnkey houses are designed and constructed to meet the threshold requirements of the building code 
and are targeted to minimise the capital development costs without caring much about the operation 
and running costs except to the extent required in the code and the warranties/guarantees. As a result, 
the building owner is not given the opportunity to modify the design to minimise the in-use costs and 
may therefore involve in expense running or retrofitting costs which impact significantly on the life cycle 
productivity outcomes. The solution to this is for the volume builders to aim for green star accreditation 
of the houses, but the price to the prospective owner may be prohibitive.

New house building process involving designing from scratch
The interviewees confirmed that the new building procurement approach involving designing from the 
scratch presents the greatest challenge to the productivity improvement in the RBLC. This approach is 
further discussed in the following subsections to highlight the details involved in the two cases of simple/
standard and the complex house building cases, and how they could impact on productivity outcomes.

New house building process (simple/standard house)
Essentially, the following 8 steps are involved in the development process for a simple or standard 
house designed from the scratch. Figure 5 presents the 8 stages as part of the overall RBLC for a simple 
residential building designed from the scratch. Feedback from the interviewees suggested that the overall 
development phase could range from 26 to 40 weeks, but this could be reduced through parallel execution 
of the stages. Each stage is briefly described in the following subsection.

Figure 5: Residential building life cycle (simple building)
a)	 Briefing
At the briefing stage, the prospective home owner articulates his or her ideas and wish list 
to the designer in terms of his or her preferences in the new house. These may include 
space requirements, aesthetics, development cost target, functionalities, running costs and 
futureproofing needs, especially for energy efficiency, flexibility of use or technological 
advancement. The ability of the owner to be able to articulate these needs and requirements 
upfront and the tenacity of the brief over the design and development period could enhance 
or constrain productivity in the downstream design and construction phases. The interviewees 
stated that in real life, the owners, especially the first-time one-off procurers, often do not know 
what they want at the onset and are likely to make unexpected changes frequently even at the 
critical stages of the design and construction phases. 
The interviewees suggested that the designers should be able to manage the owner’s variation 
orders by anticipating and making provisions for the changes and by using computerised 
design process to respond quickly to the changes as and when they happen. The computerised 
3D models and visual walkthroughs could be generated to assist the owner gain better 
understanding of the design solutions and make early changes. However, there is no way 
around it if the construction work has already started.

b)	 Site investigations/analysis
Prior to the concept design, the designer visits the site and checks on the local Council district 
plan as well as the regional plan to identify issues relating to building and resource consent 
requirements. Investigations will include soil types, property title issues, consent notices, 
conveyances, right of access, and wider issues. The bulk of the information about the site and 
the requirements of the Building Act and other legislations that might be relevant to proposed 
building work is available in the Project Information Memorandum (PIM) obtained from the 
local councils. Part of the qualifications of a building as simple or standard is the absence of 
complex site characteristics and subsoil conditions; hence, there may not be a need for detailed 
soil tests and geotechnical investigations, especially for level sections on stable soil. 
Time-wise, the interviewees suggested that the site investigation stage may take up to a week 
depending on the nature of the site and issues around building and resource consent, where 
applicable.
c)	 Concept design
Based on the owner’s brief and the outcome of the site investigations, the designer prepares 
the concept design that optimises the value of the site and the needs of the building owner 
within the confines of the site characteristics and the requirements of the district (and where 
applicable, the regional) plans. Usually a number of alternative designs are presented to the 
owner for evaluation. The preferred concept plan may be modified to incorporate changes 
required by the owner. Usually the prospective owner puts down 10–12 percent of the design 
and documentation costs to enable the designer carry on with the concept and full designs 
and documentation. 
The interviewees indicated that two key issues that may limit productivity gains at the concept 
design stage. The first is due to the owner not being clear and upfront with his requirements, the 
delay in decision making and the frequent changes the owner makes, all of which could prolong 
this stage beyond the normal duration expected. The second could be the designer’s inability to 
manage well the owner’s brief and the changes he or she often makes. The interviewees indicated 
that often times, the designer fails to capture the key requirements of the owner in the design and 
is unable to anticipate the likely changes the owner makes and to proactively respond to these 
changes as and when they occur. To minimise the productivity limiting issues, the interviewees 
suggested that the designer should be experienced enough to understand the building owner, 
especially the first time homeseekers, and use computerised design process to anticipate and 
respond to the flurry of changes that may happen. Also they suggested the use of physical or 
3D models of the new house to enable the building owner visualize the design and the interior 
spaces. These will help the building owner make quick evaluation of the extent to which his or her 
needs have been addressed by the concept design and so advise the needed changes fairly quickly.

The duration for the concept design varies depending on the ability of the building owner to 
provide on time the information and preferences required to freeze the concept design and 
get on with the full design development. The interviewees indicated a time range of 2–4 weeks 
as being typical. 
d)	 Full design and documentation
Having frozen the concept design, the designer proceeds to full design of the house and 
produce the working drawings and specifications for consenting and building contract 
documentations. Usually, the owner is required to make a deposit payment (usually 10–12% 
of the full design costs) before the full design and documentation process could start. Where 
the site characteristics and the owner’s requirements are such that the design is able to be based 
on the recommendations of the NZS 3604: 2011 Timber-Framed Buildings Standard, there may 
not be a need for specific engineering design (SED). In this case, the full design and consenting 
processes are fairly quickly and less costly. The requirement for SED not only adds to the costs 
and time required for the full designs, but also brings about delayed consenting, as the council 
officials spend more time to scrutinise the designs to ensure compliance with the Building 
Code. To minimise the delay in obtaining the building consent, one or two pre-lodgement 
meetings may be required with the council officials to sort out issues about weathertightness 
and additional information required to demonstrate compliance with the code.

Overall, the interviewees pointed out buildability issues, poor specifications, design and detailing 
errors/omissions and a potential discrepancy between the design and the site characteristics as 
the key productivity limiting issues which this stage can introduce at the construction phase. 
To mitigate these issues, the interviewees suggested early involvement of the builders and 
specialist tradespeople at the full design stage. The aim is to leverage the in-depth experience 
of the builders and the specialist tradespeople, particularly the plumbers, drainlayers and the 
electricians to sort out early any design-related issues before the design could be firmed up.
Timewise, the full design could take 2–4 weeks for simple standard house, but could be more 
for complex designs, depending on the level of complexity involved.
e)	 Consenting stage
Following the completion of the full design and documentation stage, and before a building 
contract agreement is entered into with the builder, the designer obtains quote for the value of 
the building work from the selected builders who are invited to tender for the job. A builder 
is selected and the contract price negotiated and agreed. The contract price becomes the basis 
for the BCA to determine the fee to be charged for the processing of the consent. In effect, the 
designer lodges a building consent application to the local city or district council on behalf of 
the building owner. A number of the interviewees referred the researcher to the MBIE’s website 
(http://www.dbh.govt.nz/blc-building-consentinspect-process) or the Consumer Build’s 
website 
(http://www.consumerbuild.org.nz/publish/bact/buildingact-consents-application.
php) for full details of the information required for the building consent lodgement. There is 
no value repeating the checklist in this document. The builder or developer may also take on this 
responsibility if engaged for a design and build contract. As part of the application lodgement, 
an appointment is made with the Building Consent Authority (BCA). At the appointment, 
the council receiving officer checks the application, the house plans, specifications and other 
submittals to make sure that all the details required to evaluate compliance with the performance 
requirements of the Building Code have been supplied. Following this, the building consent 
processing fee will be charged often based on the agreed contract price for the building work or 
the envisaged time required to process the application. Also the number of inspections required 
for the work will be advised and at what stage of the house building process the inspections 
should occur. The fees are higher where SED or other verification methods are used in the 
design process. For such cases, the interviewees hinted that the BCAs usually outsource the 
assessment to the specialist consultants. This approach was perceived to have improved the 
duration for the consenting, though nowhere near the statutory 20 working days in majority 
of the cases. The interviewees admitted that, to be fair on the BCAs, the delay is usually due to 
the BCAs not having all the information they require to make decisions, especially in relation 
to weathertightness details. However, some interviewees pointed out that, on account of the 
prevailing leaky building issues and the associated litigations, the BCAs are overly risk-averse 
in terms of approving plans and issuing the consent within the 20 day statutory timeframe.

To this end, the recent proposed amendment to the Building Act which seeks to introduce 
stepped risk-based consenting system was perceived by some of the interviewees in the second 
phase interviews as a possible solution to the prevailing risk-averse climate surrounding 
the building consenting application processing and the associated delays. In relation to the 
residential building consenting process, the MBIE (2012c) highlights the key elements of the 
proposed stepped building consent system as follows:
--
“a simplified and more prescribed consenting process for certain simple residential 
building work at the lower-risk end of the spectrum (such as a simple single-storey house 
built using proven methods and design with low structural and weathertightness risks)” 
--
“existing consent and inspection requirements for moderate- to high-risk residential 
building work, such as a multi-storey house of complex design, and for lower-risk 
building work not involving a suitably qualified building practitioner”. 
MBIE (2012c) stated that some prescribed quality assurance measures are pre-conditions for 
the implementation of the proposed risk-based consenting process.
However, a number of the interviewees expressed doubts about the ability of the proposed 
amendments to truly “contribute to a more productive, efficient and accountable building 
construction sector”1. To many of the interviewees, it could escalate the builders and designers’ 
insurance costs of liability protection for defective work; and the costs will be passed on to the 
homeowner in the form of higher building costs, thereby exacerbating the already spiralling 
construction costs to all time highs. So in the end, the expected potential compliance cost 
savings might actually result in building cost increases tripling any envisaged savings.
From a different perspective, some interviewees saw the real intention of the proposed 
amendments as largely serving to shift the BCAs’ exposure to liability for defective building 
work to designers and builders, who would then be expected to take greater accountability for 
ensuring that their work is Code compliant. This is in view of the preponderance of the joint 
and several liability judgements against the BCAs by the courts in several weathertightness cases.
The interviewees queried the rationale of accepting the building consent as valid evidence of the 
BCA’s satisfaction with the design plans and specifications being Building Code compliant, but 
not accepting the final Consent Completion Certificate (CCC) as valid evidence of the building 
being Code compliant, whereas the CCC certifies that the building has been constructed and 
inspected to comply with the building consent as issued.

Another productivity limiting issue at the consenting stage relates to the differences in the way 
the various territorial authorities interpret and apply the same provisions of the Building Act 
in the consenting process. This issue introduces a lot of risks and unnecessary redesign work 
when replicating similar designs for building sections sited on different local council lands. 
This adds to the costs and time for full design development. The proposed streamlined online 
consenting process was believed to contribute to mitigating this issue.
Timewise, the interviewees indicated that the consenting timeframe could vary depending 
on several issues; on the average, the consenting time for simple standard house designed 
solely from the Acceptable Solutions could take 2–4 weeks. For complex designs, it could take 
up to 8 weeks. The majority of the interviewees said that the 20 day statutory timeframe for 
processing the building consent was never realised in 95 percent of the time, even for simple 
and straightforward plans that were based solely on the Acceptable Solutions. Part of the delay 
could be due to the workload of the BCA at the time of lodging the application; high workload 
could make the BCA prolong the start of the time ticking by giving a long appointment date 
for receiving the lodgement. To avoid the indictment of not being able to meet the 20 day 
statutory timeframe, they could ‘force the clock to stop ticking’ by requesting for unnecessary 
details. Experienced builders and developers were said to have good rapport with the BCAs 
and would usually spend the least amount of time getting their consent issued, sometimes 
achieving 2–3 weeks of consenting timeframe for simple standard house plan.

It should be noted that the Building Act review acknowledged that the BCAs take a risk-
averse approach to building consenting because of concerns about their liability, resulting in 
“unnecessary checks and inspections for certain building work where the risk to public health 
and safety is relatively low” (Office of the Minister for Building and Construction, OMBC, 
2011, p. 2).
f)	 Building agreement and contract signing
After the building consent has been obtained, the owner negotiates with the builder whose quote 
was accepted earlier on, and on the basis of which the BCA charged a fee for processing the 
building consent application. The builder usually provides the building contract and agreement, 
which the owner signs if Okayed by his or her solicitor. It should be noted that the building 
contract signed at this stage is conditional upon the issuance of the Code Compliance Certificate 
where the owner is not responsible for the full project management role. The interviewees 
indicated that the builder may be contracted for labour only services where the owner wishes 
to be involved or retain the services of the architect or architectural draughtsperson for the 
supervision role, though this is rare. The norm is the full contractual engagement where the 
builder oversees the entire construction process including material supplies and employment of 
the specialist tradespeople. On a number of occasions, the builder could be engaged to manage 
the construction process, including the coordination of the specialist tradespeople employed 
directly by the owner, who also supplies the materials. 
The interviewees hinted that not all building contracts are written contracts; a number of 
residential building contracts could be verbal, depending on the size of the project, and the 
level of rapport or trust between the owner and the builder. The interviewees indicated that 
the verbal contracts were used for small building works, while the written contracts were 
normally used for large scale jobs. However, they pointed out that the written contracts are 
increasingly being used due to the current litigious climate of the building industry. It should 
be noted that the Building Act 2004 will be amended to require written contract between 
building contractors and consumers for all building projects above $20,000, together with more 
information disclosure, clearer obligations and new legal remedies (MBIE, nd). 
The builders indicated that several forms of written building contracts are in use, with many 
building companies and independent builders having their own forms. In addition, there are 
standard forms of building contract. These include the following:
--
Standards New Zealand’s (NZS 3902:2004) Housing, Alterations and Small Building 
Contract. 
--
The New Zealand Institute of Architect’s (NZIA’s) standard forms:

Results And Discussions
--
Standard Conditions of Contract Short Form (SCC SF 2009): for use between the builder 
and the owner when the architect is commissioned to administer the contract for small 
or less complex building projects.
--
National Building Contract Small Works (NBC SW 2010): for use between the builder 
and the owner for small or less complex building projects when an architect is not 
involved in the contract administration.
--
The Registered Master Builders Federation’s (RMBF’s) standard form of contract.
--
The Certified Builders Association of New Zealand’s (CBANZ’s) standard form of 
contract.
The interviewees indicated that the use of the standard forms could minimise disputes in the 
residential building contracts. Such standard forms of contract were perceived to be fair on all 
parties, except where the standard clauses were modified to serve the interest of one party to 
the detriment of the other. The feedback was that the RMBF and the CBANZ standard forms 
were popular among the independent builders, while the developers and volume builders use 
their own forms of contract. On the other hand, the NZS 3902, and to a lesser extent the NBC 
SW 2010 were the preferred choices for owner-managed projects, while the SCC SF 2009 is the 
default contract where the architect is engaged to manage the contract. The relative frequencies 
of use of these contract forms would therefore align with those of the new house procurement 
routes shown in Figure 4. 
Overall, the use of the verbal contracts was indicated as one of the causes of the high incidence 
of disputes in the residential building sector as well as a key barrier to productivity and 
performance in the sector. There was recurring affirmation that written contracts clearly spell 
out terms and conditions that govern the contractual relationships between parties. This helps 
to minimise arguments and disputes about rights and responsibilities of the parties.
At the building agreement and contract signing stage, the interviewees also raised the issue 
of project finance as another key barrier to progress and productivity, if not property dealt 
with at this stage. They were of the view that, prior to signing the building agreement, the 
owner must first sort out the funding for the project. As soon as the owner receives a quote 
from a preferred builder, the owner must ensure that he or she has arranged for the finance, 
which should be an amount over and above the quote given by the builder. The extra amount 
serves as the contingency against cost escalations due to change orders, unforeseen ground 
conditions and other unexpected cost increases which are not due to the fault of the builder. 
Some interviewees advised 15–30 percent contingencies depending on the complexity and scale 
of the project, including variability of the subsoil conditions. The NZS 3902: 2004 recommends 
10 percent of the building contract price as typical contingency sum.

The interviewees indicated that most written residential building contracts are fixed price 
contracts. The owner is required to pay up to 10 percent deposit after the contract has been 
signed. All other payments are claimed by the builder at the completion of each of 6 stages. The 
contract agreement will include the agreed completion date, the stages of the project and the 
payment regime. The builder provides the cash flow forecast that represents the agreed stages 
of the building work and the amount due from the owner, if properly completed. This helps the 
owner to arrange for the project finance early so as to avoid cash flow problems which could 
stall progress and derail the agreed plans. The stage and cash flow forecast is usually based on 
agreed regular time interval (e.g. monthly) or a staged process of work completion. Table 2 
presents a summary of the interviewees’ feedback on a typical staged process and payment 
schedule for a simple standard residential building.

It should be noted that each of the stages 2 and 6 may be split into two if the ground works 
and external works, respectively, are complex. 
Furthermore, the interviewees viewed the labour only and the managed labour contract forms of 
builder engagement as being some of causes of disputes, defective work, time and cost overruns 
in the residential building process. They argued that productivity could further be improved if 
these contract forms are avoided. They advised that the most productive arrangement is where 
the builder is given total control of the building process. This also ensures greater clarity around 
accountability for the contract works.

g)	 Construction and routine inspection stage
Usually within 10 days after signing the contract, the builder must start work, except if agreed 
otherwise with the owner. The building consent expires after 12 months if the work has not 
started, unless special arrangement is made with the BCA. The builder notifies the BCA before 
the project work begins and arranges for building inspections by the BCA or an independent 
Licensed Building Practitioner (LBP). The interviewees indicated that the number of inspections 
required at various stages of the building process may vary depending on the confidence 
reposed on the builder, the complexity and scale of the project and the overall risk profile of 
the project. For a standard residential building project, 6–8 inspections may be carried out at 
the following stages:
--
Foundations, including excavations, service ducting, reinforcing steel and concreting 
(usually 2–3 inspections)
--
Framing,
--
Plumbing
--
Drainage (including roofing)
--
Cladding, flashings and insulation.
--
Completed building.
Usually, the owner and the builder arrange for insurance covers as means of managing their 
share of the risks involved in building work. Regular monthly site meetings are held to discuss 
progress, and resolve conflicts and disputes and other issues. The builder submits progress 
payment claims to the owner at agreed intervals or milestones as work progresses.
The interviewees hinted that, for a complex residential project, the builder should prepare a 
master programme for integrating and coordinating the works of the specialist tradespeople and 
to monitor progress. He or she should also prepare a safety plan for monitoring health and safety, 
as well as a quality assurance plan for monitoring quality. The interviewees were convinced 
that following such best practice approach, even for a simple standard residential project has 
huge productivity benefits in terms of ensuring a safe and defects-free work completed on time 
and within budget. The interviewees further stated that the residential building process is often 
fraught with disputes, quality issues and time and cost overruns because, 70–80 percent of the 
time the builders do not follow this best practice approach. 
Depending on the scale and complexity of the project and how the owner and the builder 
fulfil their contractual obligations, the interviewees estimated the construction stage to take 
about 20–24 weeks for a simple house on a level section, if weather and other constraints do 
not present.

h)	 Final completion, certification and handover
On completion of the work, the owner and the independent certifier inspect the work to 
ensure that it has been completed to plan, specifications and quality requirements. If there 
are any defects, the builder rectifies them to the satisfaction of the owner. At the same time, 
an independent building inspector makes a final inspection and may issue a Notice-To-Fix if 
there are non-Code-compliant or weathertightness issues.
Finally, an application is made to the BCA to issue a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC). The 
BCA issues the CCC if satisfied that the completed work was carried out in accordance with 
the consent documentation, and that due inspections were carried out as scheduled for the 
consent that was issued. In addition, if the inspections were carried out by an LBP, his or her 
Record of Work forms must be provided to the BCA. Further requirements for issuing the CCC 
include the owner’s payment of the development contribution levy, as well as the Energy Work 
Certificate for the project, which must be provided by the electrician and gasfitter. 
While handing over the completed building to the owner, the builder and the specialist 
tradespeople will be required to provide to the owner their guarantees and warranties for their 
own portions of the work. If a Registered Master Builder was in charge of the house building, 
he or she will offer the building owner a Master Build 7 Year Guarantee2 as a standard practice 
required by the Registered Master Builders Federation of New Zealand. This is in lieu of the 
5–10 percent retention monies which may be held back by the owner at each payment stage, if 
the guarantee is not in place. The interviewees referred the researcher to the Master Builders’ 
Master Build Guarantee (RMBF, 2013) for details. The RMBF’s guarantee covers the following 
items, which are compared with those of the Certified Builders Association of New Zealand 
(CBANZ, nd):
RMBF Guarantee covers
CBANZ Guarantee covers:
1
Owner’s deposit (up to $20,000 inclusive of 
GST),
Reimbursement of any deposit paid to the builder where the 
builder is unable to continue beyond site preparation, not 
exceeding 20% of the contract price, or 450,000, whichever is 
the less
2

New house building process (complex building)
The development process for complex residential buildings follow the same process for the simple or 
standard building as outlined in section 5.4.1. However, the higher level of complexity involved may 
require additional activities to be carried out, as well as increase the time and costs required for completing 
activities that are similar to those of the simple buildings. Feedback from the interviewees indicated six 
additional activities to those required for the simple building. The additional activities also could result 
in the development phase requiring 41–76 weeks to complete, which is about double the timeframe for 
simple building. The additional activities are highlighted in Figure 6 and are briefly discussed in the 
following subsections.

Figure 6: New house development process (complex building)
a)	 Geotechnical investigations and report
The interviewees indicated that one of the issues that add to the complexity of the residential 
building is the condition of the site, including the stability of the subsoil layers. The bulk of the 
information about the site and the requirements of the Building Act (2004) and other legislation 
that might be relevant to proposed building work is available in the Project Information 
Memorandum (PIM) or the Land Information Memorandum (LIM) obtainable from the 
local council. The PIM or LIM document would provide information about the site that 
could suggest carrying out detailed soil tests and geotechnical investigations as part of the site 
analysis. The need for detailed soil tests and geotechnical investigations is to ensure that the 
site characteristics have been captured as the basis for the ensuing design development. This 
would help to minimise issues, particularly variations to the foundation designs and drainage 
works, which often give rise to cost and time escalations, disputes and barriers to productivity 
gains at the construction phase. The interviewees indicated that majority of the unforeseen 
ground conditions that cause variations, delays and escalation of the building costs were driven 
by lack of proper site investigations. The key issue at this stage is that often not much time is 
devoted to detailed site analysis by the designers and/or the owner. The assumption is that the 
information on the PIM or the LIM is sufficient to inform the design. But in real life, recent 
developments or changes in the ground conditions may have altered the original conditions 
recorded in the PIM or LIM and could often give rise to productivity limiting issues later on at 
the implementation phase. The interviewees maintained that the extra cost for having a detailed 
geotechnical investigation and report is nothing compared to the costs, delays and productivity 
issues which could arise during the construction phase due to unexpected variations in ground 
conditions which may require significant changes to the designs.
Timewise, the interviewees suggested that geotechnical investigations and reporting could take 
2–4 weeks, depending on the scale of the project and the nature of the ground conditions.

b)	 Scheme design
The interviewees pointed out that if the outcome of the detailed geotechnical investigations 
reveals some abnormal ground conditions that would not suit simple design solutions, complex 
engineering designs will be needed. To enable the structural engineers carry out the complex 
designs, the architect would need to prepare a scheme design after ‘freezing’ (or finalising) the 
concept design approved by the building owner. These are general arrangement drawings that 
provide the basis for the structural engineering design and detailing. 
Timewise, this could take 1–2 weeks, depending on the scale of the project and the experience 
of, and the approach taken by, the architect. 
c)	 Specific engineering design (SED)
The interviewees suggested that the challenging site conditions that underpin complexity of 
some residential buildings and that inform the need for detailed geotechnical investigations 
more often than not imply that specific engineering designs (SED) may likely be required. 
These are designs that do not match the Acceptable Solutions prescribed in the Clause B1 of 
the Building Code. To find feasible solution to the complex engineering problem presented 
by the subsoil or site conditions, the engineer may design outside the Acceptable Solutions 
and therefore needs to demonstrate how the design complies with the Code through the 
Verification Method or the Alternative or Performance Based Solutions. The interviewees 
hinted that the prevailing climate of several and joint liability litigations now cause the 
Building Consent Authorities (BCAs) to view with suspicion any design that departs from 
the Acceptable Solutions. The BCAs must be satisfied that the design is Code compliant and 
so often apply rigorous scrutiny involving different levels of review and audit to the drawings 
and specification – some by consultants. As a result, the consenting process could involve 
back and forth iterations between the BCAs and the designer involving numerous requests for 
additional information. At the end, the consenting process could be very costly and protracted 
resulting in delay and loss of productivity. The interviewees hinted that this phase could take 
1–2 weeks depending on the complexity of the design, the experience of the designer and the 
approach taken in the design process.

d)	 Pre-lodgement meeting with the BCA
The interviewees hinted that where designs are based on the Verification or Alternative 
Solutions, a pre-lodgement meeting is scheduled with the BCA after the completion of the 
full design and documentation process. The purpose is for an official of the BCA to check 
through the drawings and specifications and advise what needs to be changed or what additional 
information is required to demonstrate compliance with the Building Code. However, some 
interviewees pointed out that this may still not be a perfect solution to the consenting delay 
problem. They argued that the advice given by the BCA officials during the pre-lodgement 
meeting does not guarantee that the bona fide application will not be subjected to full scrutiny 
when lodged. This is because, whereas the BCA officials may give advice at the pre-lodgement 
meeting, the actual application is often scrutinised by independent consultants who will do 
full checks without considering whether or not prior advice had been given during the pre-
lodgement meetings. However, it was indicated that if this process is effectively utilised, the 
time for the consenting process could be greatly reduced.

e)	 Completion, final inspection and snagging
On completion of the work, the owner or the architect engaged by the owner will inspect the 
work to ensure that it has been completed to plan, specifications and quality requirements. 
For a large scale or complex residential building project, a snag list is usually presented to the 
builder if there are defects to be fixed before practical completion could be certified for the 
project. This process is not as formalised for the simple building project. The interviewees 
hinted that this inspection is additional to the final inspection carried out by the building 
inspector or the independent certifier. The latter is a condition for the issuance of the Code 
Compliance Certificate (CCC). The building inspector may issue a Notice-To-Fix if there are 
non-Code-compliant or weathertightness issues to be resolved; the issues must be satisfactorily 
resolved before the CCC can be issued on application. A number of the interviewees welcomed 
the proposed changes to the building control processes, whereby the building inspector’s final 
inspection would be substituted with the inspection by the LBP, usually the engineer or the 
architect, who designed the works. The interviewees indicated that this approach would be 
more productive in the sense that the designer is able to verify and confirm the alignment 
of the works with the design assumptions much quicker than the BCA building official or an 
independent certifier who may not know the design assumptions and who may go overboard in 
scrutinising the works just to avoid liability to risk of defects as is currently being experienced. 
The interviewees believed that productivity suffers due to time-consuming scrutiny and delay 
to work progress by the inspectors who were not part of the design process.

New house building process: Construction phase of the complex buildings
Feedback from the second phase of the interviewees confirmed the findings at the earlier phase that 
the construction stage, especially for large scale and complex residential buildings, present significant 
barriers to efficiency gains in the RBLC. At the same time, the stage also offers numerous opportunities 
for productivity improvement in the cycle. 
Interviews held at the first phase with five site managers involved in residential developments within 
Auckland identified eight key stages of the construction phase as being typical of most large scale or 
complex residential development projects as shown in Figure 7. These contrast with the six typical stages 
for the simple or standard residential building project as highlighted in Table 2.

Figure 7: Typical stages of the construction phase of a complex residential project development
The following subsections provide detailed insights into the construction process for the complex 
residential buildings, where the barriers exist and how productivity could be improved in the process. 
A) The planning stage
The construction phase starts with a more detailed planning of the ensuing operations. This is more 
detailed than the pre-contract planning required for establishing the likely duration of the project, and 
which informs the tender price and completion date at the tender stage. During the planning meeting, 
the entire construction work is broken down into chunks of interrelated activities based on a project-
specific Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Where the project is largely executed by subcontractors, 
the WBS could be aligned with the trades or work packages. It should be noted that this aspect of the 
planning is quite similar with the planning for commercial building project. Perhaps, this aligns with the 
recent proposed amendments to the Construction Contracts Act, which include removing the distinction 
between residential and commercial construction contracts (Beehive, 2013).

The desired logical sequence for the execution of the activities is agreed upon, along with the estimated 
durations and resource requirements (i.e. costs, labour, plant/equipment and supervision/coordination). 
The resource estimates are largely based on the quotations provided by the material suppliers and the 
subcontractors plus some risk margins for safety or buffers. The WBS and the planning parameters 
(i.e. sequence, duration and resource estimates) provide the basis for compiling the Method Statement 
(MS). The MS details the sequence of the planned operations against the quantities and rates of outputs, 
durations, construction method, resources (plant, labour and subcontractor) and the temporary works 
needed for each operation, as well as the applicable legislations and compliance requirements. It provides 
for each activity, the preferred method of execution, the volume of work involved, the man-hours, the 
machine-hours, the types and number of required equipment/plant, the optimum gang size, and the 
responsibility for supervision and control. The MS needs to be approved by the building owner or his/
her project representative. The designers in particular would want to be assured that the construction 
method outlined in the MS is such that would align with the design assumptions and that would deliver 
the required quality of work. 
The MS also provides the inputs for the project risk analysis and the network analysis (especially for 
complex projects). The outcomes of the risk analysis and the method statement details are used to compile 
the project implementation plans. On a large project, these may comprise six plans: 
a)	 the master programme: This takes the form of a bar chart or a Gantt chart. The master 
programme (and the weekly programmes drawn up from it) provides the baseline for 
monitoring and controlling the actual progress of work and the cost expenditure. 
b)	 the risk plan and contingencies: this identifies the various risk scenarios that could affect the 
key project objectives, their risk profiles, mitigation measures and contingencies. 
c)	 the quality assurance plan: This details the key quality expectations and the measures for 
achieving them; 
d)	 the health and safety plan: this details the health and safety issues and the measures for 
addressing them in line with the Health & Safety in Employment (H&SE) Act; 
e)	 the environmental management plan (EMP): this details the environmental and resource 
management issues and the measures for complying with the RMA 1991. 
f)	 the temporary traffic management plan (TTMP): this details the potential impact of the 
operations on the traffic and how this could be addressed to meet the NZTA requirements. 
Figure 8 shows the key components of a typical planning stage for the construction phase of a large scale 
residential development as advised by the site managers.

It should be noted that the accuracy and robustness of the risk analysis and the method statement reflect 
on the project implementation plans. These in turn determine the level of accuracy and the outcomes of 
the monitoring and control of the actual execution of the works and the productivity and performance 
level that could be achieved in the process. The site managers believed that by spending quality time 
in doing proper risk analysis and drawing up a detailed method statement, a large proportion of the 
uncertainties and constraints to productivity and performance could be detected and resolved or budgeted 
for at the planning stage, thereby improving productivity outcomes.
B) Notices and permits
The notices and permits at the construction phase are distinct from the building and resource consents 
which are applied for and issued at the design and documentation phase. These notices include those 
required for demolition of existing structures on the building site (where applicable), tree removal, and 
existing site services relocation. Also, given the large scale of the development and the impact on traffic 
in the neighbourhood, notices may be required from the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) 
for temporary traffic management and control which must be supported by the temporary traffic 
management plan compiled during the planning phase. Above all, the BCA requires that the building 
inspection schedules which are noted on the issued building consents must be booked well ahead of time.
The lead times required for issuing the notices and the time lag involved in obtaining the permits, 
especially from the Councils, contribute to increased duration of the construction project. In addition 
to the fees charged in the process, the increased durations affect the cost of the project finance and the 
required resources. These result in higher construction costs, and reduced productivity outputs. To guard 
against these, the site managers advised that proper documentation must be prepared to accompany the 
notices and permits in concert with the BCA officials to ensure that all information is provided and that 
there will be no delays in the processing of the notices and permits.
C) Preliminaries
The preliminaries comprise the fundamental operations that must be carried out before the actual 
building erection commences. Depending on the scope and complexity of the project and the site 
characteristics, the preliminaries could involve the creation of temporary access roads (where applicable), 
the identification and relocation of existing services on the site such as water mains and sewers, electricity, 
telecommunication, etc. In some contaminated sites, the LIM offers information on the nature of the 
contaminations and how these could be properly dealt with. Also, the LIM could provide information 
about other risk aspects such as site erosion and made-up grounds which must be resolved before anything 
else is built on the lot. The site is fenced and appropriate signage is put in place for public information. 
Dust screens and effluent control must also be in place as part of the approved environmental management 
plan (EMP) for the project.

Next, a detailed site layout plan is drawn up to identify optimum locations of the various preliminary 
and general (P&G) items on site such as the site accommodation, material stockpiles, storage spaces, 
hard-standing for the crane and its installation (where multi storey residential units are involved), etc. 
Subsequently, the set-up and establish operations are implemented following the site layout plan. 
Some of the key issues about the preliminaries which may significantly affect productivity outcomes at 
the construction phase relate mostly to the site layout plan. If the site layout planning process and the 
resultant site layout plan were not properly implemented, the work flow on site and the safety of the 
construction operations could be significantly constrained. This in turn would impact negatively on 
site operational efficiency, safety and productivity outcomes. This usually presents a major challenge in 
congested sites, especially in the cities. The solution to this, as proffered by two of the site managers was 
to rent a storage space outside of the site to keep the site free for improved work flow. Also the use of 
decked containers as site offices and storage spaces was suggested to maximise the limited ground space 
for improved manoeuvrability on site. Figure 9 shows the subcomponents of the preliminaries work stage 
of the construction phase. This differs slightly from the cost-only approach adopted in the New Zealand 
Institute of Quantity Surveyor’s (NZIQS, 1992) Elemental Analysis of Costs of Building Projects.

Another key issue with the preliminaries is that contractors (whether building companies or developers) 
generally underestimate the scope and cost of the preliminaries items while pricing the jobs. The site 
managers indicated that majority of the contractors use a rule of thumb to assign a mark-up of 5–10% 
of the base cost of the project without actually costing the details of preliminaries and general (P&G) 
requirements. Depending on the site characteristics, the scope of work and the complexity of the project, 
the P&G could cost up to 50% of the base costs, especially where cost-intensive operations need to be 
carried out before the actual construction starts, such as dewatering, erosion control, access road and 
site decontamination. Due to the stiff competition for jobs during economic recessions, contractors 
deliberately underprice the P&G items to lower their bids and improve their chances of winning the 
tenders. They do this with the intention of making up their potential losses through variation claims 
on the P&G components when the actual construction work starts. However, the building owner often 
queries such variation claims on the grounds that the contractor ought to have ascertained all project 
costs and include these in the pricing of the tender. This often results in costly and time-consuming 
dispute resolution processes that undermine productivity, relationships and overall project outcomes. 
To guard against this, the site managers advised that contractors should carefully scrutinise the site 
geological reports and the drawings in addition to visiting the site to verify all issues that may affect 
cost and factor these in the pricing of the job. Adhering to this advice may be a problem for some 
contractors on three grounds: the first is the time and resource commitments required to do proper site 
analysis and pricing of the preliminaries; the second is that the contractor is not sure of winning the 
job and the time and resources spent on researching the issues and submitting a bona fide tender may 
go down the drain, if the bid is unsuccessful. Thirdly, pricing the preliminaries correctly may escalate 
the tender price and makes the bid uncompetitive. Overall the site managers agreed that the solution to 
the preliminaries problems, especially where the site characteristics, scope of work and the complexity 
of the project indicate huge P&G cost implication is to be upfront with the pricing, have a negotiated 
contract, insist on a cost-reimbursement contract or partner with the building owner for a win-win 
contractual arrangement.
D) Site preparations and substructure
The site managers’ accounts of the typical constituents of the site preparation and substructure work 
at the construction phase of a large scale residential development project varied, depending on the 
project and site features. Overall, the feedback showed that typical constituents include all work within 
the confines of the new building footprint from the foundations up to the underside of the lowest floor 
finish. Again, this differs slightly from the approach adopted in the New Zealand Institute of Quantity 
Surveyor’s (NZIQS, 1992) Elemental Analysis of Costs of Building Projects. The key differences are the 
exclusion of demolitions, dewatering and diversion/termination of existing services and water courses, 
all of which form part of the preliminaries work as discussed in the earlier subsection.

Depending on the nature of the project and the site conditions, the site preparations may include the 
site clearance, tree removal, temporary ground retainment, underpinning and shoring of the nearby 
buildings/structures which may be affected by the excavation of the new construction. On the other hand, 
the substructure work may comprise the excavations (including basement excavations, where applicable), 
drainage and piling (where applicable), bulk filling and consolidation, foundations, underfloor walls/
retaining walls, ground floor slab or timber floor construction, tanking/waterproofing, underfloor service 
ducts, lift pit (where applicable), and permanent ground retainment. Figure 10 shows typical constituents 
and construction sequence for the site preparations and substructure work.

Depending on the variability of the ground conditions, the site characteristics and the scope of work, 
the substructural issues may account for 20–30 percent of the variation claims and cost overruns in the 
residential development. These issues are prevalent on most sites, notwithstanding the availability of 
information on the soil test results and the geological reports. The issues relate mostly to excavations. 
E) Superstructure
The superstructure comprises the balance of the construction work from the substructure to completion, 
excluding the finishes, fixtures and fittings, and the external works. Depending on the nature of the 
building, typical superstructure work as shown in Figure 11, may include the frame, structural walls, 
suspended floors and roofs; stairs and lift (where applicable); external cladding; doors and windows; and 
services (second fix: cabling, piping or ducting for plumbing, HVAC, fire services, electrical services, 
telecommunications/data and special services).

Figure 11: Typical subcomponents of the site preparations and substructure work
The superstructure represents a significant proportion of the construction phase, especially for high rise 
residential buildings. It therefore has potential for influencing productivity and performance outcomes 
in the construction phase. The site managers hinted that the key issues around the superstructure work 
and which may impact on efficiency and productivity relate mostly to the coordination of the various 
trade interfaces involved. They were of the view that, depending on the scope and complexity of the 
work and the number of these interfaces, effective project coordination role relies heavily on sound 
project management skills and knowledge and in-depth experience. These underpin the effectiveness of 
the planning, scheduling, communication, supervision, monitoring and control processes. 
F) Finishes fixtures and fittings
The finishes comprise the external and internal protective coatings or treatments to the surfaces of walls, 
frames, ceilings, floors, parapets, etc. The external finishes may be applied or in-situ such as rendering, 
painting or decorations.

The finishes, fixtures and fittings stage could influence the maintenance frequency of the completed 
building in the operation stage, if they are not properly installed or if the quality of work is shoddy. 
Also, if not properly supervised, a lot of wastage may be encountered over and above the allowances in 
the tender price, which could result in cost overruns and poor productivity outcomes. Figure 12 shows 
typical components and sequence of the finishes, fixtures and fittings at the construction phase.

G) External works
The external works are the last of the construction works prior to the close-out and handover stage. 
Theoretically, they include site works beyond the line of the exterior face of the building structure 
(NZIQS, 1992). Depending on the site characteristics, and the scale and complexity of the project, typical 
subcomponents and sequence of execution of external works are as shown in Figure 12.

Figure 13: Typical components of external works for large scale residential development
Being the last major construction operation before the close-out stage, the external works may present 
productivity issues due to the tendency to divert the project resources (workers, equipment and 
supervision) to commence other projects which have just been won by the contractor. As a result, a lot 
of issues around ‘snagging’ (i.e. a list of identified defects) are usually encountered at this stage, which 
may further delay the practical completion period and undermine the desired productivity outcomes 
on the project. However, it could be argued that if certain components of the external works, such as 
hard landscaping, are required for issuing Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) and where final payment 
is tied to CCC being issued, there is every incentive for the contractor to deploy sufficient resources to 
finish the work quickly and efficiently (Berry, 2013).
H) Close out and handover
The close-out and handover stage is the last operation following the issuance of the practical completion 
for the project. Typical subcomponents of this stage are as shown in Figure 13.

Ideally, this stage of the construction phase should not present any productivity challenge. However, 
being the last operation, the quality inspections and the compliance scrutiny conducted here are the 
strictest. Defects or mistakes which were not noticed during the earlier stage inspections are more likely 
to be captured here. The stage therefore may likely experience a lot of snagging issues or ‘notices to fix’ 
following the last building inspections. Given that the bulk of the project resources such as workers, 
subcontractors, scaffolds and other plant and equipment would have been deployed elsewhere at this 
stage, fixing any identified defects usually becomes a big issue for most contractors. More so that this 
is the stage where the last impression is created, which may affect the building owner’s perceptions of 
quality for the whole project and a key decider of whether or not the building owner would want to re-
use the contractor for future contracts, where applicable. Getting it right the first time is the best way 
of guarding against the quality issues which may be picked up at this stage.

Figure 14: Typical subcomponents of the close-out and handover stage
Typical project plan and schedule
Figure 14 is a simplified version of a typical project plan and schedule for the construction phase of 
a residential development project. It highlights the key operational stages, the planned durations and 
their scheduling on a timescale. This is used to compare actual progress on site against the initial plan. 
Through this comparison, any noted discrepancies are investigated to establish the underlying causes 
and hence the resolution strategies. In practice, the project plan is revised whenever any major variation 
occurs that has the potential of affecting the overall project cost and completion time. The revision re-
establishes a set of benchmarks and completion date for subsequent progress monitoring. Similar plans 
are established for the project cost and control purposes. 
However, the industry’s approach to monitoring the costs and schedule performance separately is not 
very effective. This is because, while the project may be within schedule as planned at any point in time, 
the budget would have been exceeded.

The key requirement from the building owner is a clearly articulated and firmed-up statement about his 
or her requirements in the building process. This may be possible for experienced building owners who 
procure buildings regularly. The truth is that most building owners – especially the first-time or one-off 
residential building procurers – do not have adequate knowledge of the building construction process 
to be able to articulate their needs early in the procurement process. It is the responsibility of the project 
team – the designers and the contractors – to enlighten them on the key issues and how their decisions 
and need preferences could impact on quality, cost and productivity at the development phase as well 
as the entire RBLC. This may help to reduce the owner-driven change orders, especially at the critical 
stages of the construction process.
The key requirement from the architects and the engineers is accurate, comprehensive and timely 
information on the details for implementing the building project efficiently and effectively. Alternatively, 
the contract should provide for the contractor to develop the design further to address his or her needs 
for operational details about some tricky aspects of the construction work. This will minimise the 
designers’ detailing errors or lack of sufficient information, and hence mitigate delays and rework issues.
The contractor needs to have the right experience, capacity and capability to undertake the project. He 
or she should have adequate project management and organisational skills to effectively coordinate the 
various subcontractor interfaces. In addition, the workers need to be skilled and experienced in the type of 
work at hand. They need to be adequately equipped with the right tools and be well motivated to deliver 
the expected outcomes. The environment within which they work needs to be safe and conducive for 
productive outputs. They need to be well supervised and rewarded for going the extra mile in delivering to 
or surpassing expectations. However, in practice, the contractors often lack the project and organisational 
skills and knowledge for these interface coordination roles. Where changes occur due to variations to 
the contract, the master programme is hardly updated to reflect the new scope of work. The result is that 
proper progress monitoring involving the benchmarking of the actual performance against the planned 
targets is not followed. Consequently, idle times, excessive wastages, and ill-motivation of workforce 
become the order of the day, giving rise to poor productivity and performance at this stage. To guard 
against this problem, the interviewees recommended the contractor’s engagement of an experienced and 
qualified construction manager to be in charge of the project execution; alternatively he or she could 
upskill in project planning, project management and human resources management to be able to deliver 
sustainable and successful project outcomes.

Productivity measurement points in the building life cycle
Generally, productivity measures the overall efficiency of the production unit in utilising resource inputs 
to produce outputs of goods and services (Mawson et al. 2003; Calderon, 2010). Statistics New Zealand 
(2012a) concurs to this by defining ‘production’ as “the act of combining the inputs (labour and capital) 
to produce outputs of goods and services. Mawson et al. (2003) argues that, as ‘outputs’, the goods and 
services produced by the production unit for productivity evaluation purposes must be those available 
for use by the other/external production units. 
It should be noted that the productivity outcome in a phase of the RLBC or in one of its subparts, 
does influence productivity outcomes in other phases. For instance, an architect’s poor design at the 
design phase could present buildability problems and poor productivity in the construction phase. In 
the operation and maintenance phase, the architect’s poor design could also result in poor building 
performance including high energy costs and frequent maintenance. Also by not taking into consideration 
the ease with which the building components could be decoupled for re-use at the decommissioning 
phase, the architect’s design results in expensive and destructive deconstruction with little or no prospects 
for materials and components re-use or recycling; this further diminishes productivity at this phase. 
However, the productivity measures computed at the measurement points in the building life cycle may 
not take into consideration the inter-phase relationship due to difficulties in accurately tracking and 
quantifying the inter-phase influences. The way around it is to consider the down stream influences of 
one phase in evaluating the output value of the phase. For instance, the value of the poorly designed 
and constructed building at the end of the commissioning stage of the development phase could be 
significantly diminished by the implied high maintenance and running costs at the operation and 
maintenance phase. This way, the inter-phase productivity influences could be accounted for at the point 
of measurement. Figure 7 shows the stages in the RBLC. 
Interview participants’ feedback on the productivity measurement points in the RBLC
The essence of the foregoing section was to clearly identify where the productivity measurement points 
exist in the RBLC so as to understand the groupings of the role players that contribute to the outcomes 
in each measurement point. The interview participants were all in agreement with this concept. The 
outcomes of the subsequent investigations on the relative levels of influence of the role players on 
productivity therefore helped to identify the key role players who are in the position to make a difference 
in the productivity improvement at the key stages and for the overall building life cycle.

Role of stakeholders in the building life cycle 
One of the objectives of this study was to identify the key role players in the phases of the RBLC and 
how they influence productivity at their phases of operation and for the whole cycle. The information 
compiled in relation to this objective at the scoping study phase provided the starting point of inquiry 
at the empirical surveys. The participants were asked to validate, modify or add to the information as 
they saw fit. Overall, the interview participants approved of the information as being valid in practice. 
Table 2 presents the final version of the information, as modified by the interview participants.
The information in Table 2 should be viewed with caution; this is because only a few interviewees were 
prepared to provide feedback on the intra-phase and inter phase influence of each role player as initially 
planned for in the scoping study report. The interviewees were rather more comfortable with feedback on 
the productivity influencing role/input of the role players and the other role players whose productivity 
output might be affected in the other phases of the RBLC. Perhaps, this could be due to lack of detailed 
knowledge of the intra and interphase activities and influences and the interviewees’ reluctance to provide 
feedback on issues outside their sphere of competency. Their feedback in relation to the productivity 
influencing role/input of the role players was documented in Table 3. The information was presented 
from the role player focus, as distinct from the phase-focus of Table 4.

Stakeholder perceptions of the concept of productivity
There was some sort of an agreement among the participants on the meaning of ‘productivity’ from their 
individual viewpoints. Feedback was consistent on the concept being a metric for assessing the extent 
to which value has been delivered in any undertaking that has set objectives or targets to be achieved, 
and pre-determined amount of resources for accomplishing the set targets. The ‘value’ in this case may 
mean different things to different stakeholders depending on their value system. However, a general 
understanding of the value is the extent to which the set targets or objectives have been achieved on 
one hand, and the extent to which the available resources have been optimised in the delivery process, 
on the other hand. To survey participants, productivity is at its optimum level if the set targets have 
been achieved, while utilising the minimum amount of resources possible in the process. While this 
perspective on productivity aligns with the generic understanding of ‘value’ in the value management 
circle (Shen and Chung, 2002), it is important in two respects:
First, it goes further than the output-input perspective of the economist which focuses solely on the 
quantum of output per unit of resource inputs (Davis, 2007). Except where the output-input ratio 
constitutes the objective to be achieved or the set target, the economist’s perspective misses out on the 
‘performance’ aspect of the focus on value delivery. Having a balanced view of productivity ensures that 
productivity improvements are not made by sacrificing the quality of the completed building, which 
might well be the case if all that is focussed on is having more output with less input, without caring 
for the quality of the output. 
It should be noted that for a number of the interviewees, the economic perspective, particularly the total 
factor productivity model, is essential, as the sole purpose of being in business is to make profit. However, 
they argued that making quick money may not be a key motivator to productivity and performance 
in all cases. They cited an instance where a contractor envisages further jobs coming from a building 
owner. In this instance, the contractor may be prepared to trade off profit on the current job with the 
hope of recouping it in the subsequent jobs. The contractor could therefore manage the change orders 
in the current job solely to the owner’s terms without disputing the owner’s approach to valuing the 
variation orders; the motivation here is to build good owner-working relationship that is fundamental 
to winning subsequent jobs. 
Overall, the key components of project-level definitions of productivity as analysed from interviewees’ 
feedback comprised three limbs as follows:
--
‘Efficiency’: this is the economic perspective of productivity, focusing on the optimal use of 
resources. This aligns with the output-input schema, where the overall focus is to “achieve 
(output) more with less (input)”. Table 4 and Figure 15 show that this perspective of productivity 
was mentioned 39% of the time. This means that the economic perspective on productivity is 
not widely shared by the stakeholders as a key component of productivity at the project level.

--
‘Effectiveness’: This is the ability to achieve set objectives. In the project context, the objectives 
are cost/budget, time/schedule, scope and quality. This is more of a performance issue and 
perhaps, explains why the terms ‘productivity’ and ‘performance’ are used in tandem. Figure 
15 shows that this perspective was mentioned 35% of the time. A holistic view of productivity 
at the project level therefore encompasses wider issues. 
--
Sundry items: A closer look at the key components of the various definitions of productivity 
provided by the survey participants suggests that, over and above issues relating to efficiency 
and effectiveness, the participants expected productivity to involve the achievement of other 
indicators of performance such as safety, client satisfaction, relationships (including absence of 
disputes/litigations), workforce satisfaction, reputation (for performance), future job orders, and 
regulatory/statutory compliance. These sundry items accounted for about 26% of the recurring 
themes in the interviewees’ expectation or understanding of the concept of productivity. 
A holistic view of productivity at the project level should therefore comprise efficiency, effectiveness and 
wider issues which can be referred to as ‘add-ons’.

Results And Discussions
However, it was surprising to note that sustainability was not considered by the participants as being a 
key component of the productivity definition, in spite of the growing emphasis on the subject. Perhaps, 
this aligns with the Beacon Pathway’s (2008) observation that, quite unlike the UK and other developed 
economies where the government drives the sustainability initiatives in the new build through massive 
financial support (often in the social housing sector) and through the Building Code, such financial 
support is not part of the government agenda for the private sector, which is entirely market driven. 
Beacon Pathway (2008) research suggests that many people would find it easier to build and retrofit their 
homes sustainably if council policies, plans and processes were more supportive of sustainable design, 
arguing that “even when policies are neutral or supportive of sustainable building, Council administrative 
processes can be a disincentive. Currently, there are limited resources, knowledge gaps, and a generally 
piecemeal approach to policy initiatives to support sustainable residential building. Over and above the 
threshold provided in the current Building Code, sustainability is only considered in the retrofitting sector 
through the various financial incentives provided by the central and local governments. Furthermore, 
Sharman (2013) notes that building sustainably is seen as being more expensive, as only first costs are 
usually considered, rather than lifetime costs.
Overall, an ideal definition of productivity at the project level must include effectiveness (i.e. achievement 
of set targets or objectives, usually costs, schedule, scope and quality), efficiency (i.e. optimal use of the 
available resources in achieving the set targets), and sundry issues such as client satisfaction, safety and 
statutory/regulatory compliance.
Implications for research
The feedback provided by the participants was therefore wrapped around the above definition of 
productivity, which is a huge contrast from the economic perspective usually adopted by the government 
and government agencies. It should be noted that the agencies adopt the economic perspective of 
productivity for international comparability purposes (UN, 2009).

The box plots in Figure 16 show that, on the basis of the average values, decisions made at the full 
design and specification phase have the highest influence on the overall productivity outcome in the 
RBLC, accounting for about 30% of the total outcome. This result contrasts with earlier studies (Mbachu, 
2008) which found that the decisions made by the client at the inception phase exert the most profound 
influence on the productivity outcomes in the down stream phases and for the overall life cycle. Perhaps, 
this is a reflection of the general feeling that the designers in New Zealand have so much influence on 
the choices made by the building owners, especially in relation to the form, structure and fabric of the 
building, and therefore control the downstream productivity outcomes, albeit, indirectly. Overall, the 
industry believes that the construction phase would be a lot more straightforward and less problematic 
if the design is right from the start Sharman (2013). 
Table 5 shows that, overall, the decisions made at the design, conception/inception and construction 
phases account for about 80% of the productivity outcomes in the RBLC. The biggest opportunities for 
productivity increase leverage in the cycle could therefore be in the shaping of the decisions the role 
players at these phase make to ensure a positive influence in the productivity outcomes for the whole 
cycle. This task is explored in the next section.

Key role players’ influence on productivity outcomes
As stated in the conceptual framework for the study, establishing the productivity/efficiency constraints 
in the RBLC and where the opportunities for greatest improvement exist in the cycle requires focus 
internally on the stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities at each phase as well as the consideration of the 
influence of the external factors in the operating environment. This subsection presents feedback and 
results on the relative levels of influence of the key role players on the RBLC productivity outcomes as 
well as the various ways in which they bring about those influences.
Key role players’ relative levels of influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes
With the traditional procurement approach involving customised designs being the greatest obstacle 
to productivity outcomes in the RBLC, the first phase of the interviews focused on this procurement 
approach. The ‘turnkey’ approach and the standardised design (with no significant owner-modifications) 
were later covered in the second phase of the study to ensure a holistic coverage of the entire spectrum 
of the residential building development from simple to complex buildings.
To determine the relative levels of influence of the role players, the participants were asked to rate their 
relative levels of influence on a 5-point Likert scale. Multi-attribute analysis was used to establish the 
mean ratings as given in Equations 1 and 2 under the Research Method section. Table 7 shows the results 
of the analysis. Figure 17 provides the graphical plots for better visual clarity.
Results showed that the architect was perceived as the most influential role player in the RBLC as far 
as the customised design procurement route is concerned. The next ‘very high’ influencers are the 
owner, the project manager and the contractor. The consenting authorities were rated as being ‘high’ 
influencers. It should be noted that the interviewees rated the ‘project manager’ as a function rather than 
a role player. In other words, the architect, developer or contractor could perform this role depending 
on the contractual arrangement with owner. Some experienced owners could also retain this function. 
The various ways through which these role players influence productivity outcomes in the RBLC are 
discussed in the following subsection.

Figure 18: Key role players’ relative levels of influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes (for traditional procurement involving 
customised design)
Influences
At the interviews, the key role players were asked to comment on the various ways the key stakeholders 
could influence productivity at their phases of operation and for the whole of the building life cycle. 
They were also asked to suggest ways in which the influence of the role players could be leveraged to 
improve productivity and performance in the RBLC. The following subsections detail the outcome of 
the analysed feedback of the interviewees using content analysis.

A) Building owner
The interviewees were unanimous in their feedback that the building owner is the most influential role-
player in the RBLC productivity outcomes. Their feedback, as modelled in Figure 18, suggested that the 
building owner’s influence is underpinned by the strategic choices he or she specifies in the design brief in 
relation to 4 key areas: place (i.e. location), product (i.e. the building), process (i.e. project characteristics), 
and performance (i.e. the performance criteria/benchmarks). The strategic choices in these key areas are 
interdependent and have profound influences in all stages of the RBLC as shown in the figure below.

Figure 19: Building owner’s brief and strategic choice in 4 key areas and their influence on the RBLC phases and productivity outcomes.
1) Location
The interviewees believed that, no matter how defined (whether from the economic/efficiency or the 
strategic/effectiveness perspective), the building owner’s choice of location for the building development 
has the greatest influence on the productivity and performance at the individual and overall phases of the 
RBLC. At the development phases, the location parameters having profound influence on productivity 
and performance include the following:
--
site/topographical characteristics, including subsoil profiles, 
--
neighbourhood characteristics including city/district plan restrictions, permissible noise/
pollution levels, traffic congestion, parking availability and permits, 
--
Logistics and supply, including proximity to material supply and waste disposal centres, 
haulage distances and freight restrictions.

Overall, these location parameters have a profound influence on the design solutions, specifications for 
materials and workmanship, planning approvals and permits, project site layout and planning, and the 
choice of construction method and implementation, including onsite material handling and storage. The 
most profound influence was perceived to be the city/district plan’s compliance requirements for the 
residential zone into which the location falls; these place serious restrictions on the nature and size of 
the development thereby limiting the extent to which the building owner’s expected value on the land 
development could be realised. Some examples cited by the interviewees included the council plan’s 
restrictions on the use and characteristics of the proposed building, and the building envelope’s provisions 
for building coverage/intensity level, recession planes, boundary setbacks and structure heights. These 
restrict the building features such as the number of floors that can be permitted as per the council plan’s 
building envelope. Ideally, the height limits are intended to reflect the physical qualities, characteristics 
and aesthetic coherence of the areas to which they have been applied (Auckland Council, 2012a). Where 
the proposed building or upgrade fails to meet the council plan’s provisions, resource consent is required. 
Overall, Seadon (2013) opines that the city/district plan’s compliance requirements become issues under 
intensification, as proposed by the Auckland Council. 
The interviewees noted that, under the Resource Management Act 1991, the resource consent application 
would include the assessment of the potential environmental effects and the proposed measures to 
mitigate the effects. More importantly, if the potential environmental effects were assessed by the Council 
as being more than minor, public notices or limited notices must be given, allowing interested parties 
to make submissions in support or opposition of the application. The interviewees further noted that it 
could take about one to two months to process a non-notified resource consent application and about 
four months for publicly notified applications. They added that the consenting application could be quite 
tedious, costly and time-consuming, and with the prospect that the application may not be approved in 
the end, resulting in a waste of resource and time. These issues constrain productivity and performance, 
especially at the design and upgrade/conversion phases. To minimise the delays in the consent application 
processing, Seadon (2013) advises the designers to work with the BCAs during the design production 
stage and to prepare well prior to application lodgement, ensuring that all the information required is 
provided.

The location features also impact significantly on the development and operation phase productivity 
outcomes in several other ways. For instance, some of the interviewees explained that if the location 
is such that the project will be carried out on a sloping or highly restricted site, it presents a lot of 
problems with the site planning, onsite material storage and handling, manoeuvrability, work flows and 
site safety; these escalate construction costs and completion times, thereby constraining productivity 
and performance. The location could expose the building fabric to harsh environmental conditions 
that may raise durability issues thereby necessitating costly design specifications and/or high operation 
and maintenance costs. Examples cited included locations in high wind zones (that require more costly 
structural stabilisation) or in tectonic hotspots (that require more expensive seismic strengthening) or 
corrosion zone (that require special treatment to façade). For instance, one of the interviewee hinted 
that if the site is located in a high wind, earthquake or corrosion zone, the building code provides that 
homes built in these locations would require extra protections in terms of engineering, bracing and 
finish. The extra protections impact significantly on costs and completion times, and hence could reduce 
productivity outputs at the construction stage, though, this may improve productivity over the life cycle 
due to improved durability and resistance of the building to severe environmental conditions.

Overall, the location features present positive and negative impacts on the productivity outcomes in the 
RBLC phases. A good number of the interviewees advised that a more proactive approach to choosing 
the right location for optimum productivity in the RBLC is to focus more on the impact over the long 
term (such as the impact on the market value of the completed building and the capital appreciation 
rate in the chosen location) and less on the short term impacts (such as the impact of the land purchase 
price and the site restrictions on the development costs). However, an issue that may require weighing 
both positive and negative location impacts to evaluate which location would given a more productive 
net effect is the impact of the city or district plan restrictions on what is achievable in each alternative 
location in terms of the maximum value to be derived from the land development and the net present 
value of the capital appreciation rate or revenue streams (for the case of investment property) over the 
50 year life cycle of an average residential building. 
2) Product/building characteristics
The building characteristics may include parameters such as aesthetics, quality/durability, size/scope/
complexity, materials and components, services, and building use. The interviewees believed that, in the 
case of a building designed by the architect from the scratch, the brief set down by the building owner 
communicates the desired functional requirements and performance characteristics for the proposed 
building. The designers job is to propose design solutions or alternatives to meet the owner’s needs, based 
on their interpretation of the owner’s brief and preferences on the one hand, and on the other hand, their 
understanding of the regulatory compliance and limitations as set out in the building code and the city/
district plan. Within the regulatory allowances, the strategic choices made by the owner in relation to 
the building functionality and characteristics therefore dictate the productivity outcomes in the design, 
planning, construction and in-use phases of the RBLC. Earlier studies concur to this by arguing that 
the owner’s brief to the architect defines the parameters within which the building must be designed 
(Kwakye, 1997), planned for (Mbachu, 2008) and constructed (Rowlinson, 1999). The parameters of the 
completed building in turn inform its performance in the operation and maintenance phase as well as 
in the upgrade/conversion and the disposal phases. An example of the owner’s preferences in relation 
to the building characteristics as cited by some of the interviewees is the choice for curved shapes as 
opposed to straight edges. Though aesthetically pleasing, the curved shapes could present buildability 
problems. As a result, the completion time could be longer and the development costs could escalate by 
20–30 percent compared to an alternative design with straight edges. 
The opportunity for productivity increase at this stage presents if the building owner could specify the 
building characteristics that have potentials for maximising productivity in the RBLC phases. A typical 
example cited by one of the interviewees was the choice of the design proposal with straight edges as 
against curves.

In the case of the standard plans, interviewees at the second interview phase believed that 70-80 percent of 
the time, the owners would modify the plans to suit their unique requirements or preferences. This follows 
the general understanding that, for most New Zealanders, home ownership represents their greatest life-
time investments. The owners would therefore like to exercise control over the design solutions to suit 
their current and future lifestyle needs. The key issue here is that such significant modifications to the 
standard plans and specifications could increase the costs and completion times of the building by 30-50 
percent when compared to the outcomes for a similar building built with little or no modified standard 
plan. The significant design changes represent enormous wastage of design resources, and hence raise 
serious productivity issues at the design phase of the RBLC. 
3) Process/project preferences and specifications
The process/project preferences and specifications as cited by the interviewees included the owner’s 
preferences for the construction method and technology, the procurement system, the contract strategy, 
the risk and reward scheme, the project team and the project culture. 
The interviewees confirmed that the owner’s brief about the project specifications set the contractual 
framework and boundaries within which the project team members are contractually bound to deliver. 
The key issue here, as stated by some of the interviewees, was that the New Zealand building owners 
are so risk-averse that they are usually reluctant to accept innovative solutions that have not been tried 
and tested, and which could provide huge opportunities for cost-savings and productivity improvement. 
Building owners would rather prefer the traditional systems, in spite of their many shortcomings. This 
also extends to the consenting stage where the Building Consent Authorities view with suspicion any 
innovative material or building solution that is not part of the Acceptable Solutions. In relation to this, 
Sharman (2013) remarks that, given the Auckland weathertightness experience this is not surprising, 
adding that BCAs are very loathe to accept innovations they have no experience of as they perceive it 
increases their risk if the house subsequently fails to perform. A number of the interviewees observed that 
the time and cost involved in demonstrating compliance of the innovative solutions to the Building Code 
is quite discouraging, and is a key barrier to the uptake of innovation and productivity in the industry.

In terms of innovative solutions, two opportunities for productivity improvement at this stage, which 
were mentioned by a good number of the interviewees included the following:
• the use of prefabrication technology (as opposed to onsite fabrication), and 
• the use of partnering and integrative management procurement routes (as opposed to the 
traditional design-bid-build approach which is the current norm and which introduces 
fragmentation between the design and construction roles, thereby impeding seamless flow 
of value in the RBLC value stream. The integrative management procurement route such 
as design and build (D&B) and project management (PM) entails a central and integrated 
coordination role for managing the design and construction functions so that value flows 
uninterruptedly from start to finish thereby avoiding the patch-protection tendencies of the 
service providers, minimising interface frictions and transaction costs, and assuring a central 
point for accountability, risks and outcomes in the development process.
The interviewees believed that these two strategies have the potentials to reduce the construction costs 
by 20–25 percent as well as reduce the completion time by 30–40 percent. However, getting the building 
owners to adopt these two strategies would first, require them to give up their penchant for bespoke 
designs and risk-averse dispositions. Further research is recommended to gain understanding of what 
drives building owners’ risk-aversion and preference for bespoke designs.

4) Performance metrics (KPIs), management and outcome monitoring
Some of the interviewees indicated that the building owner’s strategic choice does include specifications 
of the benchmarks for evaluating performance of the service providers in the proposed project delivery 
process and beyond. The key project benchmark specifications are budget, schedule and quality targets 
to be achieved. Other project benchmarks could include safety, environmental impact and service 
attitude, depending on the building owner’s values and goals. These key performance indicators (KPIs) 
vary in weights depending on the building owner’s preferences. For short-term interest owners such 
as developers, the schedule and budget benchmarks are weighted heavier than the other KPIs. On the 
other hand, the long-term interest owners such as the owner-occupiers would place more emphasis 
on quality/durability and in-use performance. The interviewees believed that these KPIs provide the 
productivity measurement criteria from the building owner’s point of view. Invariably, if the benchmarks 
were unrealistic, the service providers would struggle to achieve them. This means the productivity target 
would not be realised. However, the key issue here, as pointed out by some of the interviewees, is that 
the benchmarks conflict with one another, meaning that focusing on one benchmark may undermine 
achievement of the others. One of the interviewees alluded this to the “devil’s square balancing act”. An 
example cited was that where the emphasis is disproportionately focused on speed of completion, the 
budget is likely going to be exceeded and the quality may be comprised as well. On the other hand, 
focusing on quality may mean longer construction time and higher costs. Each of these scenarios impairs 
productivity at the development phase. The interviewees believed that the solution to this challenge is 
the use of technology and innovation in leveraging and optimising the available resources to achieving 
the benchmarks in ways that are quite impossible to accomplish using the business-as-usual approach. 
Sharman (2013) opines that for innovation and technology to thrive, the risk-averse tendencies of the 
key role players – the owner, the BCAs and builders – need to be addressed. This is a no mean task, but 
it is worth working towards through collaboration and gradual incremental change approach.. Another 
solution lies in the use of partnering clauses in the building contract agreements between the owner 
and the service providers; the aim is to achieve win-win situations for all, rather than the prevailing 
win or lose scenario. It should be noted that a recent BRANZ-sponsored Value Stream Mapping (VSM) 
workshop found that although technology was one solution worthy of exploration, communication 
between the building owner, the builder and the designer, were also key, as was professional skills in 
pricing (Berry, 2013). 
Overall, the interviewees confirmed that the strategic decisions the building owner makes at the onset 
have profound impact on the actions and performance of the service providers in the remaining phases of 
the building life cycle. This finding accords with earlier research (Rowlinsons, 1999; Folk, 2005; Mbachu 
and Nkado, 2007), which has rated the owner as the most influential figure in the procurement process 
and performance outcomes.

 In terms of the management of the residential building process, the interviewees believed that the owner 
plays a significant role in shaping outcomes in this direction. The key expectations included meeting 
own contractual obligations to the building contract such as the following:
• responding to crucial requests for information (RFI) as and when needed, 
• being clear about his or her needs in the building process and communicating these 
unequivocally at the onset, 
• avoiding or minimising disruptive and costly change orders especially at critical stages of the 
building process, 
• maintaining reasonable expectations from the service providers, and 
• having adequate funding arrangement in place to minimise cash flow problems for the 
service providers.
B) Design consultants
At the interview sessions, the majority of the interviewees agreed that design consultants play a major role 
in shaping the productivity and performance outcomes in the RBLC. Content analysis of the interviewees’ 
feedback revealed six major areas through which the designer could influence productivity outcomes in 
the RBLC. These were perceived as the potential leverage points for productivity improvement by the 
designers at the inception, design and other phases of the RBLC. Figure 19 highlights the six areas. The 
details are discussed in the following subsections.

1) Quality of brief articulation and design development
A number of the interviewees believed that the designer’s ability to correctly and comprehensively 
establish and translate into a final design and specification the owner’s needs and requirements at the 
inception stage goes a long way to determine the extent of value that could be delivered by operators in the 
downstream phases of the RBLC. This is subject to the limitations imposed by some statutory/regulatory 
compliance requirements such as the city/district plan rules and the RMA. One of the interviewees 
reasoned that productivity could be thought of as the quantum of value delivered to the building owner 
or developer in the development process. The interviewee went further to explain that three gaps exist 
between the owner’s/developer’s desired value and the delivered value. Figure 20 models these gaps.

Figure 21: Gaps between the owner’s desired procurement value and the value delivered during the development phase of the 
building life cycle
Gaps 1 and 2 fall within the role and responsibilities of the designer in the development process; these 
are discussed in the following subsections.
Gap 1: Value loss due to owner’s insufficient brief or designer’s inefficiencies
The first gap that shrinks the desired value to the designed value is due to the owner’s inability to state 
in sufficient details his or her needs and requirements for the project during the brief. This inability may 
be due to lack of experience or knowledge of the project development process or perhaps, as in the case 
of the developer, lack of clarity around the real owner or user’s needs and preferences. This gap could 
also be attributed to the designer’s inefficiencies, usually in terms of not being able to fully capture the 
owner’s needs and requirements for the building and translate these in the blueprint; it could also be 
due to poor design or misinterpretation of the owner’s brief. 
As a result of this gap, the designed value therefore falls short of what the owner desires in wanting to 
procure the building. The interviewee believes that this gap is the reason for the prevalent costly and 
time-consuming change orders, which often happen during critical stages of the construction phase, 
thereby causing resource wastage, time and cost overruns and drastic reduction in productivity gains.

To improve productivity at this stage, this gap needs to be filled by educating the owner in the briefing 
process or involving an expert who knows in sufficient depth the owner’s business and/or personal 
circumstances to be able to provide comprehensive advice on his or her stated and evolving needs for 
the building and the development process. The interviewee criticised the practice of having a static brief 
captured only at the inception of the development process, arguing that briefs should be an on-going 
thing and that the evolving design should be flexible enough to permit later changes which can easily 
be accommodated at any phase of the development process without incurring so much wastage, delay 
and cost to the implementation of the project. This is crucial in the case of inexperienced owners or 
for developers who will need to incorporate future users’ requirements when the building development 
gets to a certain stage.
Other productivity improvement leverage strategies at this stage include having fit-for-purpose designs; 
ability to verify design assumptions on site to minimise costly and time-consuming downstream change 
orders and variations; consideration of resource use efficiency social and environmental impact of the 
design solutions; use of quality assurance techniques in performing design activities such as checklists, 
design reviews and peer reviews; and ensuring code compliant designs. 
Overall, the interviewees believed that by adopting innovation, flexibility in design and economy, the 
designer could not only fill the gap but extend the value envelope to deliver more value than initially 
envisaged by the owner/developer. 
Gap 2: Regulatory/statutory compliance restrictions
The interviewee explained that the building owner does not always get what he or she desired in the 
building due to the limitations imposed on the design solutions by the city/district plan rules and the 
Resource Management Act (RMA) 1991. These limitations vary according to the location of the building 
on the planned zones and include boundary setbacks, recession plane and height restrictions, and building 
coverage, neighbourhood characteristics, density, etc. The designer factors these limitations in the design, 
which may result in a gap between what the owner or developer desires and what is statutorily allowable. 
The interviewee hinted that is usually the case for customised design where the owner’s requirements 
may be at odds with the statutory provisions. In this, if there is a decision to go ahead and design to the 
owner’s full requirements, resource consent will be needed, often involving public notifications. This 
process is uncertain in terms of outcomes and is usually costly and time-consuming, especially where 
there is a need to take the matter to the Environment Court to appeal against the Council’s decisions. 
In this situation, productivity is determined by the client’s decisions.

The interviewee and a number of others hinted that the regulatory/statutory compliance constraints 
to productivity are outside the control of the project team; there is nothing much anybody could do 
about it. However, through innovation, experience and design efficiency, the designer is able to mitigate 
the statutory compliance issues and deliver better value to the building owner. Overall, economic and 
strategic selection of land for the building development can help to avoid the choice of zones where 
statutory compliance requirements could seriously limit the owner’s requirements in the design solutions 
and result in more productive outcomes.

2) Appropriateness of material selection and specifications
The interviewees indicated that designers could influence productivity in the RBLC through their 
choice and specification of materials and components for the building. They believed that significant 
productivity gains could be achieved by selecting and incorporating into the design durable, code-
compliant, environmentally-sustainable and energy-saving materials and components that are easy to 
install without so much wastage at the construction phase, that could be durable enough to minimise 
frequent maintenance and the associated costs and disruptions at the operation and maintenance phase, 
and that could be easily deconstructed and recycled without losing much to the landfills. The interviewees 
maintained that productivity suffers at the construction and operation phases when material selection 
process excludes the above criteria. To guard against this, the designer should consider whole-of-life 
costs and environmental impact assessment of the materials and components, and avoid focusing on 
capital costs alone. The designers need to educate their clients accordingly, so they could tailor their 
preferences to improve overall productivity and value delivery. 
In a fresh round of interviews, some designers pointed to the limited range of materials and components 
as a key factor limiting choice of materials for whole-of-life performance, economy and sustainability. They 
indicated that only few materials and components are available to meet the Building Code Acceptable 
Solutions. Though in theory designers are not obliged to use Acceptable Solutions, opting for the 
Verification Method or the Alternative Solution proposal, more often than not, would mean a delayed 
consenting process under the current risk-averse consenting climate. The key solution proffered to this 
issue is having more materials and components being ‘CodeMark’ certified. This will give the designers 
more flexibility and a range of options for delivering more innovative, productive and environmentally 
friendly solutions for varied applications. 
3) Quality of design information documentation and communication
The interviewees also believed that designers could influence productivity at the consenting and construction 
phases through clear, comprehensive and unambiguous documentation and the communication of the 
design information as and when needed by other stakeholders. A number of the interviewees argued 
that a lot of delays and productivity issues have arisen due to the designers not supplying on time and 
comprehensively the information needed for speedy processing of consents and permits by the councils. 
Also the construction progress is undermined when the request for information (RFI) was not attended 
to as quickly as needed by the contractor to make progress. Some of the key drivers of non-compliance 
and rework include incomplete design information, incorrect or unclear specifications, detailing error 
or lack of sufficient details to enable accurate interpretation of designs and specifications.

Gap 3: Constructors’ inefficiencies and systemic constraints
The regulatory/statutory permitted value implicit in the design solution could be further reduced due 
to the constructors’ inefficiencies and wider systemic constraints. Some of these inefficiencies include 
poor planning and coordination; inadequate supervision and motivation of the workforce; poor quality 
assurance, poor workmanship, defects and rework; disputes and litigation; low margins; poor contractual 
risk allocation; and high wastage.
To narrow this gap and improve productivity, the interviewee suggested guarding against the above 
highlighted inefficiency drivers through the use of the lean construction principles and practice which 
target waste elimination and continuous value improvement.
C) Influence of the quality of project management role
Figure 21 summarises the recurring themes from the survey participants’ feedback on the various ways 
in which the quality of the project management role – whether performed by the owner, the designer 
or the builder – could positively or negatively influence productivity outcomes in the RBLC cycle. These 
are broadly categorised into 6 themes: 
--
Planning & risk management – including scope management (definition, change and control).
--
Project organisation (including site organisational structure, recommending recruitment of 
experienced service providers, site layout, site organisation, etc.
--
Project coordination and supervision (including design, construction and interfaces).
--
Monitoring, review & control of performance on cost, quality, scope, schedule and statutory 
compliance, particularly site safety and code compliance.
--
Communication – management and coordination of the project information.
--
Overall project leadership, including motivation/empowerment, incentivisation, and 
maintenance of transparency, trust and win-win approach for all. 
The survey participants acknowledged that, depending on the scale of the residential building project, the 
procurement system adopted and the applicable phases of contractual engagement, the project manager’s 
role may be an extension of the architect’s or the engineer’s role (in the traditional procurement system) 
or that of a construction project management consultant (in the project management procurement 
system). The quality of the project management role could have significant impact on the productivity at 
various phases of the RBLC. If engaged at the inception phase, the project manager’s role could include 
strategic advice on the technical feasibility of the project as conceived by the owner.

As the key role player in the construction phase, the builder could exert profound impact on the value 
of the completed building at the operation phase through quality construction or lack of it. 
Figure 22 details the recurring themes in the survey participants’ feedback as the key areas through 
which the builder could positively or negatively influence productivity outcomes in the RBLC. Positive 
influence results when these responsibilities are discharged to best practice standards. On the other hand, 
negative influence results when the builder is negligent in some of these aspects. Monitoring of activities 
in these key areas therefore presents opportunities for significant improvement on productivity from 
the builder’s side. In the area of site organisation and management, Sharman (2013) advises on-time 
ordering and taking delivery of materials and products as and when needed on site could also help to 
improve the builder’s influence on productivity at the construction phase.

Figure 23: Contractor’s key areas of influence on the RBLC productivity outcomes
E) Consenting authorities’ (BCAs’) influence
A number of the survey participants doubted whether the influences of the BCAs should be included 
under the stakeholder roles or as part of the external constraints, given that the project team has no 
control over their influences. However, a good number of the participants supported including them here 
since they are key roleplayers and the authorities are also looking at ways in which their productivity 
limiting actions could be addressed to improve productivity in the industry. Berry (2013) observes that, 
for a residential building project, the project team can influence the outcome of the consenting process 
through the use of mechanisms such as pre-application meetings with the BCA, being familiar with the 
Code and the consenting authority’s requirements. Sharman (2013) adds to this by noting that the BCAs 
are a factor that must be taken into account as far as productivity is concerned, adding that, the better 
the quality of information provided to the BCAs, and the better the project team’s management of the 
BCAs’ requirements, the less obstructive they will be to on-time consenting process and to the overall 
productivity outcomes in the RBLC.

Role of the Local Councils
Almost all the survey participants acknowledged that the BCAs play a significant part in influencing 
productivity outcomes in the RBLC, especially at the design, construction, close-out and upgrade/
conversion phases. The key influence is on the time to process applications, the fees charged, and their 
suspicion for new and innovative solutions which do not fall within the ‘Acceptable Solutions. The 
interviewees confirmed that the BCA’s risk-averse position on the ‘Alternative Solutions’ was largely due 
to the aftermath of the systemic leaky building problems and the associated litigations. Such risk-averse 
positions of the BCAs inhibit flexibility and innovation in the residential building sector thereby limiting 
the prospects for productivity improvement. 
However, one of the survey participants argued that the BCAs may not be solely to blame as many people 
would want to believe. Part of the problem is the inability of the designers and homebuilders who go 
for the Alternative Solutions to demonstrate compliance with the Code. As the participant pointed out, 
the Building Code is a performance-based standard which truly allows for innovation and uniqueness. 
It allows designers the freedom to come up with a proposal for an innovative solution which – though 
may not align with the Acceptable Solutions/– provides a better outcome for the project. However, the 
onus is on the designer to provide detailed information and supporting evidence to convince the BCA 
that the proposal will comply with the Code

Results And Discussions
Content analysis of the survey participants’ feedback suggest that, from the perspective of the Councils’ 
role, productivity increase leverage can be achieved by the Councils making improvement in six key areas 
through which they influence productivity and performance of the operators in the RBLC. Figure 23 
highlights these areas.
A number of the interviewees believed that the area of the Council’s role and responsibilities having the 
most profound influence on productivity and performance in the RBLC relates to land development 
policies and regulations. It could be argued that this impacts on the land development level and 
not necessarily the residential building construction (Berry, 2013). However, a holistic view of the 
productivity outcomes in the RBLC would require a consideration of the productivity limiting issues in 
the land development as well as the residential building development and operation phases. A number 
of the interviewees believed that section prices and availability are an issue around Auckland because 
the Council has left the infrastructure development of the greenfields to the land developers who now 
charge a premium to cover their investments on subdividing and servicing the sections thereby pushing 
up section prices in the region. A number of the interviewees cited the Bay of Plenty region where the 
Council’s intervention in the land supply and infrastructure development of the sites has resulted in 
very affordable sections with lots of residential development activities going on in the area. Within the 
Auckland region where the bulk of residential development is needed, the key issue is the Council’s 
reluctance to open up green fields (i.e. farmlands) for large scale residential developments. The Auckland 
Council’s Unitary Plan policies favour urban intensification programme which focuses on infill, multi 
storey redevelopment of existing plots or brown field sites within the urban boundaries. Within the plan, 
only 30% of developments will be green fields with the 70% balance being within the existing urban 
boundaries. The interviewees pointed out that land values within the urban boundaries are exorbitantly 
high, resulting in higher development costs and the development contribution levy charged by the 
Council. Invariably, the high development costs increases the resource input (i.e. the denominator side 
of the productivity equation) and by implication, a lower productivity outcome. 
To improve the Council’s productivity in these areas, the interviewees suggested the re-engineering 
of the Council’s operations and processes through the application of smart technology and online 
consenting and approval processes. Another suggestion made by one of the interviewees was the 
outsourcing of the key services of the Councils to consultants to improve operational efficiency and 
accountability. However, this was not supported by other interviewees as viable option as the monitoring 
and performance evaluation of the consultants will present a fresh mix of problems to the already existing 
ones. Some suggested the government doing more with the private sector partners in providing affordable 
accommodation such as the targets of the Housing New Zealand Corporation and the Auckland Council 
Property Ltd.

External factors impacting on the productivity outcomes in the RBLC
This subsection presents the survey participants’ feedback on the relative levels of influence of the 
external factors impacting on the RBLC productivity outcomes, as well as the various ways through 
which these occur.
Relative levels of impact of the key external factors on the RBLC productivity outcomes
Table 8 presents the analysis of the interviewees’ feedback on the relative levels of impact of the key 
external factors, based on a 5-point Likert rating scale. The results, as highlighted in Figure 24 show 
that industry characteristics, regulatory/statutory controls and market conditions, were perceived as the 
critical external factors impacting on the RBLC productivity outcomes. It would have been expected that 
technology advances should rate higher than the critical factors identified in Figure 24. Perhaps, this 
could be because the construction sector is yet to deeply embrace technology and innovation generally 
(Sharman, 2013).
The industry characteristics – the most critical of the factors – comprise the following:
• Boom-bust cycle; 
• Composition/structure; dominance of small firms; 
• Business model, capacity & capability issues; 
• Attitude, culture and resistance to change; 
• Skills shortage, 
• Margins/profitability; competition.
• Technology & innovation.

Characteristics of the residential building industry
Issues with the size of the residential building industry and the operators
A number of the interviewees hinted that the very nature of the residential building industry in 
New Zealand inhibits its ability to grow and leverage the benefits of modern methods of residential 
development to improve on its practices, productivity and performance. Some indicated that the sole 
trader business model of most homebuilders is a key inhibitor to their capacity and capability development 
as well as their potentials to improve productivity and performance. Because the one-man homebuilder 
is always busy pursuing current jobs, he or she hardly finds time to enrol in training courses to upskill 
and develop his or her capabilities. Furthermore, most of the house-building businesses do not have 
the modern technology to drive efficiency. On the contrary, a recent BRANZ-sponsored Value Stream 
Mapping (VSM) workshop found that many residential builders do engage in training and continuous 
professional development. Further the LBP scheme requires minimum CPD, which encourages them to 
involve in CPD activities (Berry, 2013) notes that 
The issues raised by the survey participants were also noted in the Productivity Commission’s (2012, 
p. 8) Housing Affordability Report. It was found that the New Zealand residential building industry is 
essentially “a fragmented cottage industry” dominated by sole traders with no employees, and that most 
builders have the capacity to build only one house at a time, with each of about 4,604 homebuilders 
building just one house in 2010.
Some of the interviewees opined that the low margin in the industry, the high cost of labour and the fact 
that “you can’t hire and fire” under the Employment Relations Act, make these homebuilders to prefer 
working alone than taking on apprentices. They maintained that, ordinarily, if these homebuilders could 
take on one or two apprentices each, they could contribute to skill development in the industry. After 
some years of hands-on experience, these apprentices could help the builders boost their productivity and 
performance, as well as take care of their work so they could find the time to attend training programmes 
to develop their capabilities. 
In this regard, the interviewees suggested that, to boost productivity in the RBLC, the government should 
do more to support the apprenticeship programmes run by the industry training organisations so that 
the cost involved doesn’t further reduce the already low margin of the homebuilders.

Issues with the industry clients
Some of the interviewees hinted that, in effect, the attitude of the clients of the residential building industry 
and wider socio-cultural factors encourage the one-man home building business model and discourage 
large capacity builders. The interviewees opined that most home owners would prefer customised or 
bespoke designs to suit their lifestyle living preferences. Group home builders use standardised residential 
designs and plans to leverage economies of scale in bulk purchases of materials and equipment, as well 
as minimise consent delays and risks. It is also easier, cheaper and faster to replicate the same design 
on multiple plots with adaptation being only for the foundations and the façade as dictated by the 
environment and the district plans. However, most home buyers would still make changes to these plans 
to suit their unique preferences. This undermines the benefits and productivity increases offered by the 
use of standardised designs, and in effect, discourage the use of such development strategy. Feedback 
from the interview participants suggested that the building owners’ proclivity to bespoke design is 
rooted on the fact that the investment in residential development is often the owner’s most significant 
financial investment, especially for the first-timers. Also, a number of the home owners have a long 
term investment interest on their dwelling and so would like to have a say on the way it is designed 
and constructed, which may not be attuned to the conventional/standardised designs. However, Berry 
(2013) observes that some smaller builders are addressing issues such as this by permitting some scope 
for standardisation of details, methods and processes that still accommodate homeowners’ needs for 
modification of the standard design to suit their lifestyle preferences.

Influence of the regulatory environment
A number of the interviewees acknowledged the profound influence the regulatory environment has on 
productivity and performance of the role players in the RBLC. 
On a different note, some interviewees saw, as a key issue, the rapid rate of change of the legislations 
and the time and costs involved in taking steps to keep abreast with the changes. Compliance with the 
current codes, especially on weathertightness and seismic strengthening, requires a more rigorous and 
costly process that results in longer completion time and higher outturn costs.
Further opinions suggested that the current regulatory environment has contributed to poor productivity 
performance. Notable among these include the following:
• RMA, HSEA, Local Government Act; Building Act; Council bylaws;
• Building codes, building standards; LBP;
• Resource and building consent issues;
• Land supply and development policies.
5.10	
Relative levels of impact of the role players and the external factors on the 
RBLC productivity outcomes
The survey participants were also asked to rate the relative levels of impact of the two main sources of 
productivity/efficiency constraints in the RBLC as identified in the study: the external factors in the 
operating environment and the role of the key stakeholders in the various phases of the cycle. This 
information is crucial to understanding where the critical impact lies, with a view to formulating the 
appropriate risk response strategies. Each participant’s ratings add to 100%. The outcome of the analysis 
using the descriptive statistics is shown in Figure 25. The figure provides the graphical representations 
of the outcome in the box plot and the pie chart formats. The box plots show the range of values as 
rated by the participants, including the minimum, maximum, mode, mean and the standard deviation 
values for each set of constraints.

Figure 25 shows that based on the mean values, the external factors could account for 42 percent of the 
productivity outcomes in the RBLC, while the influence of the stakeholder roles accounts for 58 percent. 
The influence of the stakeholder roles is therefore more critical than influence of the external factors. 
With the latter constraint sources not being within the control of the stakeholders in the RBLC phases, 
the appropriate risk response strategy to these constraints is to have adequate contingency plans to deal 
with them as they arise. This result also shows that the controllable constraints – i.e. the stakeholder 
roles – offer greater opportunities for productivity increase leverage in the RBLC.
5.11	
Productivity increase leverage points: Where the greatest opportunities lie
Based on the investigations and the analysed results, it could be deduced that the greatest opportunities 
for productivity increase leverage in the RBLC lie with the stakeholder roles in the critical phases of 
the cycle, namely, the design, inception and construction phases. Decisions made at these three phases 
account for about 80% of the overall productivity outcomes attributed to controllable influences. The key 
role players involved in the decision making at these phases comprise the architect, the owner, the project 
manager and the contractor. The roles and responsibilities of these stakeholders where these decisions are 
made are shown in Figure 26. Overall, the figure presents a summary of the critical stakeholder influences 
and those of the external factors in the operating environment having the most profound impact on the 
productivity outcomes in the RBLC. The stakeholders have control over their own influences and can do 
something about these influences by addressing the issues highlighted in their roles and responsibilities. 
However, they cannot control the impact of the external factors. All the same, being mindful of, and by 
formulating adequate contingency plans for, these critical external factors, the stakeholders would be 
better positioned to significantly redress the prohibiting factors and lift productivity gains in the RBLC.

Recommendations
6.1	
Conclusions
An exploratory study has been completed, which aimed at identifying where the potentials for productivity 
increase leverage exist in the RBLC. 24 case study residential buildings were investigated. These comprised 
buildings at the development, operation and maintenance, renovation and decommissioning phases. One-
on-one interviews were held with 38 stakeholders working on the case study buildings. The stakeholders’ 
feedback provided the empirical data, which were analysed using the multi-attribute analytical method. 
To qualify the survey participants’ feedback to the questions asked, their understanding of the concept 
of productivity was first established. Thematic analysis of their definitions of the concept suggests that 
an ideal definition of productivity at the project level must include effectiveness (i.e. achievement of set 
targets or objectives), efficiency (i.e. optimal use of the available resources in achieving the set targets), 
and sundry issues such as client satisfaction, safety and statutory/regulatory compliance.
Results of the analysis of the interviewees’ feedback on the key questions showed that the greatest 
opportunities for productivity increase leverage in the RBLC lie with the stakeholder roles in the critical 
phases of the cycle, namely, the design, inception and construction phases. Decisions made at these three 
phases account for about 80% of the overall productivity outcomes attributed to controllable influences. 
The key role players involved in the decision making at these phases comprise the architect, the owner, 
the project manager and the contractor. The roles and responsibilities of these stakeholders where these 
decisions are made are highlighted. Also the critical stakeholder influences and those of the external 
factors in the operating environment having the most profound impact on the productivity outcomes 
in the RBLC were summarised. 
It was found that the design phase offers the biggest opportunity for productivity increase leverage in 
the RBLC. The critical role and responsibilities of the architect having the most profound influence in 
the cycle include brief articulation, design development, materials selection, specifications, and design 
information documentation and communication. Through these responsibilities, the architect firms up, 
as performance standards, the building owner’s brief within the scope permitted by the town planning 
and consenting requirements. The architect’s outputs in this regard are the designs, the drawings and the 
specifications, which are used to direct/inform the contractors’ performance. Buildability issues, lack of 
details, detailing errors, design errors, and a myriad of other issues further compound the contractor’s 
productivity in terms of costs, time and quality by creating complexity, communication gasp and 
uncertainties which may engender rework, delays, wastages, and variation claims.

Conclusion s A nd Recommendation
The second biggest opportunity for productivity increase leverage in the RBLC lie in the conception 
phase through the building owners’ needs and preferences as documented in the brief. The owner’s key 
influences hinge on the strategic choices he or she makes in four key areas: place/location characteristics, 
product/building characteristics, process/project specifications, and performance/project KPIs. Through 
these strategic choices, the owner sets the boundaries or parameters within which other role players in 
the development process must operate. The key influence here is the crystallisation effect on the building 
form and characteristics and the limiting influence on the efforts of the downstream role players to 
increase productivity in their respective phases and for the RBLC overall. The crystallised building form 
and characteristics in turn have a profound effect on the productivity metrics at any stage and for the 
whole cycle, namely in the nature of impact on the numerator side of the productivity index measure 
(i.e. the value of the output or completed building) and on the denominator (i.e. the total resource input 
costs for procuring and maintaining the completed building).
At the operations and maintenance phase, the building parameters, as designed and built, have profound 
impact on maintenance frequencies, downtimes, heating and cooling performance and overall running 
costs. However, the key aspects that impact on the productivity of the building and construction crew 
relate to the planned and restorative maintenance value and costs at this stage. Again, the dynamics of 
the development phase also play out at these two phases resulting in profound impact on productivity 
outcomes.

Conclusion s A nd Recommendation
At the decommissioning stage, the influence of the design phase productivity is felt through the ease or 
lack of it with which the decommissioned facility could be deconstructed or decoupled without much 
waste going to the landfill and how easy it is to recycle or reuse the building components. 
Activities at the decommissioning stage do not pose serious problems to the life cycle productivity 
outcomes due to rare occurrence of these activities and the increasing emphasis on re-use and recycling 
which mitigate the resource inputs at this phase. 
Implications for industry and practice
The stakeholders in the RBLC have control over their own influences and can do something about them 
by addressing the issues highlighted in their roles and responsibilities. However, they cannot control 
the impact of the external factors, which account for about 40% of the overall productivity outcomes 
in the cycle. All the same, being mindful of these critical external factors and by formulating adequate 
contingency plans for them in line with their risk profiles as established in this study, the stakeholders 
would be better positioned to significantly redress the prohibiting factors and lift productivity gains in 
the RBLC.
Limitations
This is a discussion document. As an exploratory study, the scope was limited to the nature of the buildings 
selected for the case study, namely bungalows and duplexes. Other forms of residential buildings such 
as multi-unit apartments were not covered in the investigations. Also all investigations were limited to 
the Auckland region. 
The research by and large was exploratory in nature; the scope of the investigations was narrow and the 
data points were limited in size. As a result, the findings, and the conclusions and recommendations 
flowing them, may be used with caution, as they may not be generalised beyond the study scope. The 
main intent of the report is to stimulate wider debate on the issues.
6.2	
Specific recommendations
Based on the investigations that were carried out and the findings, the following recommendations are 
put forward for improving productivity at the key stages of the RBLC. The recommendations relate to 
the new build procurement route involving designing from the scratch. This was identified as the area 
offering the greatest challenges as well as opportunities for greatest efficiency gains and productivity 
improvement in the residential development process.

Conclusion s A nd Recommendation
6.2.1	
Briefing stage
1.	 The homeowner should carefully consider his or her wish lists or requirements for the building 
and clearly communicate these to the designer at the briefing stage. This will help to ensure that 
the homeowner does not change his or her mind frequently and/or include extra requirements 
at late stages. This way, design time and costs, as well as resource wastage would be minimised 
to ensure efficiency gains and more productivity outcomes.
2.	  The designer should use experience, hindsight and exercise of good professional judgement in 
ensuring proper and comprehensive brief articulation, being mindful of the homeowner’s level 
of knowledge of the building process (or lack of it), likelihood of changes in some key areas.
6.2.2	
Concept design stage
1.	 The designer should carry out proper investigation of the proposed building site and ensure 
that the design proposals presented to the homeowner have maximised value in terms of 
meeting the owner’s requirements, the site characteristics and the development requirements 
of the local council.
2.	 Before the concept design is frozen to commence full design, the owner should seek the advice 
of the prospective builder on the suitability of the design to the section and wider issues.
6.2.3	
Full design and documentation stage
1.	 Prior to finalising the design and documentation stage, it is strongly advised that a preconstruction 
design review meeting be held between the owner, the designer, the builder and the specialist 
tradespeople who will be involved in the implementation of the project. The purpose is to 
give the designer the opportunity to convey the design intent and objectives to the builder 
and the tradespeople. It will also give the builder and the tradespeople the opportunity to 
review the contract documents and seek clarifications on issues that may affect their work and 
progress on site such as conflicting information, design/detailing details, errors or omissions, 
constructability issues, contractual deficiencies, etc. This will help to sort out early issues that 
could give rise to disputes, delays, misinterpretation of the design documents and defective 
work and hence unblock likely clogs to progress and value delivery at the construction phase.
2.	 Overall, the designer should ensure the selection and specification of appropriate materials 
and components based on whole-of-life performance outcomes. Though accessing the design 
information for life cycle performance may be a challenge, gathering and documenting feedback 
from end-users would help to provide the in-use performance characteristics of a range of 
building materials and components to inform whole-of-life economic and sustainable design 
and specifications 
3.	 Overall, the designer should ensure good quality of design documentation from the perspectives 
of the builder and the BCA.

6.2.4	
Consenting stage
The design team should be able to properly manage the information requirements of the BCA through 
effective use of pre-application meetings and quality of documentation. This way, the information 
clarification and documentations required for the issuance of the CCC would have been provided at the 
time of application to avoid unnecessary delays and back-and-forth iterations. 
6.2.5	
Building contract stage
1.	 Whether for simple or complex residential building projects, verbal contracts should be avoided. 
Written contracts should be used to clearly document the terms and conditions that will govern 
the implementation of the contract. This will help to minimise disputes about the rights and 
obligations of the parties to the contract.
2.	 As much as possible, standard forms of contract that are widely accepted as being fair to all 
parties and not biased towards any one trade or professional organisation should be used such 
as the Standards New Zealand’s (NZS 3902:2004) Housing, Alterations and Small Building 
Contract. The standard clauses should not be overly modified as to introduce risk into the 
contract or serve the interest of one party to the detriment of the other.

Conclusion s A nd Recommendation
3.	 An owner-managed process should be avoided. No matter how simple or standard a residential 
building project may be perceived to be at the start, it could take on increasing levels of 
complexity as the implementation process gains traction, largely on account of the unknowns 
such as the unforeseeable ground conditions, market dynamics and wider environmental and 
operation conditions. The building owner, except if an LBP, may not be experienced or skilled 
enough to manage such uncertainties and /or complexities. 
4.	 For complex residential building projects, bridging the communication gap between design 
and construction could help to significantly address the bottlenecks around the supply of vital 
design information to support progress at the construction stage. This could be accomplished 
by having an experienced project manager or project coordinator with full authority over all 
aspects of the residential building project development – from the briefing, right through to the 
design, consenting and construction phases. It would be most productive to have an experienced 
builder perform this role. The builder is able to effectively leverage in-depth construction 
knowledge and experience to ensure quality outputs of the design, planning, procurement and 
field operations and to optimise the achievement of the overall project objectives and value-
for-money. Alternatively, the designer could be engaged to do this; this way, the designer is 
able to ensure a good fit between the design assumptions and the work execution. It would 
be most unproductive for the owner to perform this role, given the depth of experience and 
technical expertise required to effectively discharge the responsibility. 
5.	 Where it is not possible to integrate the design and construction function through a project 
manager or coordinator, it is strongly advised that a preconstruction design review meeting be 
held between the owner, the designer, the builder and the specialist tradespeople who will be 
involved in the downstream implementation of the project. The purpose is to give the designer 
the opportunity to convey the design intent and objectives to the builder and the tradespeople. 
It will also give the builder and the tradespeople the opportunity to review the contract 
documents and seek clarifications on issues that may affect their work and progress on site 
such as conflicting information, design/detailing details, errors or omissions, constructability 
issues, contractual deficiencies, etc. This will help to sort out early issues that could give rise 
to disputes, delays, misinterpretation of the design documents and defective work and hence 
unblock clogs to progress and value delivery at the construction phase.
6.2.6	
Construction stage
Irrespective of the scale or complexity of the residential project, the builder should prepare a plan for 
effectively integrating and coordinating his own work and those of the specialist tradespeople and to 
monitor progress. This should also include a safety plan for monitoring health and safety compliance, 
as well as a quality assurance plan for monitoring quality. Such best practice approach, even for a simple 
standard residential project has huge productivity benefits in terms of ensuring a safe and defects-free 
work completed on time and within budget.

Conclusion s A nd Recommendation
As much as possible, the designer should be involved in the construction monitoring and building 
inspections. This would be more productive in the sense that the designer is able to verify and confirm 
the alignment of the works with the design assumptions much quicker than an independent inspector 
or certifier who, on account of not being privileged to the design assumptions, may go overboard in 
scrutinising the works resulting in delays to progress on site.
6.3	
General recommendations
6.3.1	
Procurement route
1.	 The procurement route for new house involving the bespoke design (i.e. designing from scratch 
by an independent architect) presents the greatest challenge to efficiency gains and productivity. 
This should be avoided when seeking productivity improvements. 
2.	 The turnkey approach (i.e. land and house package – fully designed and built house) offers 
the opportunity for greatest productivity improvement and optimum value delivery in the 
residential building sector. As much as possible, this route should be utilised when seeking 
productivity improvements.
3.	 Engagement of the builder on labour only or managed labour contract should be avoided 
when seeking productivity improvements. The builder should be engaged to have full control 
of the construction process, including the recruitment and contractual agreements with the 
subcontractors/specialist tradespeope. This helps to minimise disputes and gaps in the project 
management needs of the implementation process. 
4.	 Overall, the design and build procurement approach where the builder has the capacity for 
in-house design and construction is the most productive alternative to the turnkey approach, 
where the owner wishes to make significant input into the design of the building.
6.3.2	
Project management
1.	 For complex residential projects, there is a need for a tool that could enable simultaneous 
monitoring and benchmarking of the cost, scope and schedule performance of the project 
execution, if productivity is to be properly monitored and controlled. The Earned Value 
Management (EVM) is a more robust approach for effectively tracking the schedule, scope and 
budget performance using one performance index. Though the use of EVM is not popular in the 
New Zealand construction industry, it has been proven overseas to be a more effective tool for 
monitoring progress and achieving improved productivity outcomes in the construction phase.
2.	 Also lean construction and partnering have also been found to improve efficiency and 
productivity in the overseas construction industry, irrespective of the type of project involved. 
3.	 Use of BIM and greater uptake of prefabrication, standardisation and innovation will also 
generally improve productivity in the residential and the New Zealand building and construction 
industry. In addition to skill development and culture change, these measures would help to 
achieve the 20 by 202 productivity agenda for the nation.

Conclusion s A nd Recommendation
6.3.3	
Sundry issues
1.	 Key role players should take steps to rethink the identified key areas in which they negatively 
impact on productivity outcomes in the RBLC.
2.	 Adequate contingency plans should be put in place to cushion the negative impact of the 
external limiting factors.
3.	 The government and the industry should work together to address the key industry 
characteristics, market conditions and the regulatory/statutory compliance issues which limit 
the ability of the stakeholders to innovate and improve productivity. 
4.	 The building owner’s proclivity to design customisation and frequent change orders should be 
discouraged through professional advice on the negative impact on costs, scope, completion 
time and value of the finished property.
5.	 The building consent processes should be made cheaper and fast-tracked through initiatives 
such as online consenting, streamlined BCA operations and greater use of the standard, multi-
proof building designs. 
6.	 The owner-builder exemption to the restricted building work regime should be re-considered 
given its tendency to result in low productivity and a return to the era of leaky building in 
the near future.
7.	 Greater use of the CodeMark product certification scheme to provide a wider range of materials 
and components for use by designers to deliver more economic, flexible, innovative, productive and 
environmentally friendly design solutions to satisfy a variety of end-user requirements. 
8.	 Encourage the involvement of home-builders who have in-house design, management and 
construction capacity to provide one-stop design and build service to the owner. This contrasts 
with the current domination by volume builders who do not have the technical expertise of 
home-building to effectively coordinate and manage the quality of work and performance of 
the specialist tradespeople engaged to deliver the job.
9.	 Greater use of off-site manufacturing system to improve quality, speed, life cycle costs, 
productivity and sustainability in the home building sector.
6.4	
Recommendations for further research
Given the highlighted limitations of the study, it is recommended that large scale investigations be carried 
out at the national level to cover other residential building types.
Further research is also recommended to gain understanding of what drives the building owners’ risk-
averse dispositions and preference for bespoke designs.

PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE LEVERAGE POINTS IN THE BUILDING LIFE 
CYCLE PHASES: CASE STUDY OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS
Jasper Mbachu
School of Engineering and Advanced Technology
Massey University at Albany
Research aim, questions and objectives
The overarching aim of this study is to explore the productivity increase leverage points in the residential 
building life cycle (RBLC) (see the figure overleaf). The key objective of the study is to find answers to the 
research questions relating to the research aim, drawing upon the feedback from industry stakeholders 
during an interview. The interview is envisaged to take about 20 minutes of your time, with 15–25 
minutes being an ideal range.
Interview Questions
1.	 What is your role in the residential building sector?
2.	 In the context of your role what does productivity mean to you?
3.	 How do decisions made at the various phases of the residential building life cycle (RBLC) 
influence the overall productivity outcomes in the cycle? How would you rate the relative 
levels of influence of the decisions made at each phase to the overall productivity outcomes 
in the RBLC?
4.	 Who are the key decision makers or role-players in the RBLC? In what ways do they influence 
productivity outcomes? How would you rate the relative levels of influence of the role-players 
to the overall productivity outcomes in the RBLC?
5.	 What are the productivity/efficiency limiting factors in the operating environment of the 
residential building? In what ways do they influence the RBLC productivity outcomes?
6.	 Overall, how could productivity be improved in the RBLC? 
Appreciation
Thank you for your time and useful contribution to this study. As has been promised, your feedback will 
be treated in strict confidence and used solely for the purpose of this research without revealing your 
details or those of your organisation. If you would you like to receive the key findings of the research
