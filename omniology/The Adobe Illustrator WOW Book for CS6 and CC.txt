Sharon Steuer has been teaching, exhibiting, and writing in the digital art world since 1983. 
Sharon is the originator and lead author of The Adobe Illustrator WOW! Book series (this is 
the fourteenth edition), and author of Creative Thinking in Photoshop: A New Approach to 
Digital Art. In between publishing projects Sharon is a full-time artist working in traditional 
and digital media. She lives with the love of her life, her sound and radio professor husband 
Jeff Jacoby (jeffjacoby.net). As always, she is extremely grateful to WOW! team members 
(past and present), Peachpit, Adobe, and of course the amazingly talented WOW! artists for 
constant inspiration, and for making this book possible. Keep up-to-date with new WOW! 
content from WOWartist.com, and ﬁnd links to her lynda.com digital art courses (along with 
7-day free trial links) on sharonsteuer.com/lynda. Keep in touch with her via sharonsteuer.-
com/contact, facebook.com/SharonSteuer, and @SharonSteuer (Twitter).
Jean-Claude Tremblay is the owner of Proﬁciograﬁk, a consulting and training service for the 
graphic and print community, designed to help clients work efﬁciently. He is an Adobe Certi-
ﬁed Expert Design Master and an Adobe Community Professionals member. He has been 
deeply involved as chapter representative for the InDesign User Group of Montréal and Que-
9

bec City. After serving as a magniﬁcent WOW! tester, Jean-Claude returns for his ﬁfth man-
date as the WOW! technical editor, chief advisor, and resident magician. You can ﬁnd him 
hanging out on Twitter @jctremblay. He lives in the greater Montréal area with his wonder-
ful daughter Judith.
Cristen Gillespie has contributed to other WOW! books, including coauthoring The Photo-
shop WOW! Book. She also authors articles for CreativePro.com. With a decades-long en-
thusiasm for the digital world of art and multimedia, and an equal interest in digitally pre-
serving and presenting family histories, Cristen tackles step-by-step Techniques, Galleries, 
and Introductions with avid interest and commitment. She most enjoys learning from wonder-
ful artists and writers, and when they’re not working on a new version of the book, she al-
ways eagerly looks forward to the next Illustrator WOW! family reunion.
Steven H. Gordon is a returning coauthor for step-by-step Techniques and Galleries. Steven 
has been an ace member of the team since The Illustrator 9 WOW! Book. He has too many 
boys to stay sane and pays way too much college tuition. Steven runs Cartagram (www.carta-
gram.com), a custom cartography company located in Madison, Alabama. He thanks Sharon 
and the rest of the WOW! team for their inspiration and professionalism.
Lisa Jackmore writes both Galleries and step-by-step Techniques. She is an artist both on and 
off the computer creating artwork for nearly anyone who asks nicely. Lisa’s doodles and de-
signs are often inspired by her life’s events and observations—whether the mundane or the 
extraordinary– and is continually grateful for those who provide the inspiration for her illus-
trated thoughts. She so thoroughly enjoys being a part of the WOW! team that she doesn’t 
consider it work at all.
Aaron McGarry is a San Diego-based writer and illustrator who spends time in Ireland, where 
he is from. While writing provides his bread, commercial illustration supplements the bread 
with butter. He paints and draws to escape and relax, but ﬁnds his greatest source of joy with 
his wife Shannon, a glass artist, and their gorgeous 9-year-old daughter Fiona. Please visit: 
www.aaronmcgarry.com.
Additional contributing writers and editors: Our line-editor Eric Schumacher-Rasmussen has 
been writing and editing copy since long before it was his job. He’s currently a freelance 
writer and editor, as well as editor of Streaming Media magazine 
(www.streamingmedia.com), and is returning as our amazing line-editor for the WOW! book. 
Raymond Larrett is a designer, illustrator, cartoonist, and most recently publisher. His Puz-
zled Squirrel Press (http://puzzledsquirrel.com) specializes in unique volumes on comics, his-
tory, and mind control, in exclusive ebook and print editions. For over 20 years Gary Ferster 
has been a freelance illustrator and animator (www.garyferster.com). He’s been a featured 
artist in The Illustrator WOW! Books since the ﬁrst edition, is an Adobe Certiﬁed Expert in 
Illustrator, and is excited to also now be a new tester for the WOW! book team. George 
Coghill is a cartoon-style illustrator who specializes in cartoon logos and cartoon character 
design. His art can be seen at CoghillCartooning.com. Gustavo Del Vechio is a designer, 
teacher, and author of books on Adobe Illustrator published in Brazil (in Portuguese). He is 
an Adobe Certiﬁed Expert in Illustrator since CS2 and has been a featured artist in the 
WOW! book for a number of editions. An adapted excerpt from the automatic-corners chap-
ter of Gustavo’s book on Illustrator CC appears (translated in English) in our Expressive 
Strokes chapter.
For a thorough listing of the WOW! team of testers and contributors to this CS6 and CC edi-
tion, please also see the Acknowledgments and Production Notes, and (of course!) the Artists 
appendix.

How to use this book...
Although The Adobe Illustrator WOW! Book for CS6 and CC contains much to inspire users 
at all levels, it has been designed and tested for intermediate through professional-level users 
of Adobe Illustrator. To follow along with the lessons, you’ll need to know enough about the 
basics of Illustrator to create your own art for the techniques being demonstrated. Lessons in 
this book are designed to help you master techniques while you create your own art along the 
way. Lessons are kept deliberately short to encourage the use of this book within the conﬁnes 
of a supervised classroom. This icon 
 indicates you can look for featured artwork related 
to that lesson within a chapter’s folder from WOW! ONLINE (see Tip “Look for the WOW! 
ONLINE icon” for details).
Look for the WOW! ONLINE icon
Register this book at Peachpit.com to access WOW! ONLINE ﬁles. If you don’t already have 
an account, create one, and then access the ﬁles on the Registered Products tab on your 
Account page.
Alerting you to CC content
Whether you’re using Illustrator CS6 or CC, you can safely assume that unless we indicate 
otherwise as described below, everything you’re reading is applicable to both CS6 and CC 
(updates to the CC creative workﬂow posted after the June 2014 release will be noted at 
wowartist.com).
Look for this 
 icon in the upper corner of a page to identify CC changes big and small, 
as follows:
1 Each universal CS6/CC section of the book is followed by a special section dedicated to 
CC content. This means that within each chapter you’ll ﬁnd two CC sections; the CC intro-
duction will immediately follow the universal chapter introduction, and CC lessons and gal-
leries will immediately follow that chapter’s universal lessons and gallery section. You can 
identify CC introductions, lessons, and galleries by the 
 icon overlapping a purple rec-
tangle at the top of a page; for Introduction and lesson sections the rectangle will be in the 
upper corner of the page, while on Gallery pages the rectangle will be a purple banner across 
the entire top of the page.
11

1
Dedicated CC content is signalled by the CC icon overlapping a 
purple rectangle in the upper corner on In-
troduction, Step-by-Step lesson pages (top 
and middle), or across the top on Gallery 
pages (bottom)
2 Within the universal CS6/CC section, if a 
 icon is the only purple in the upper corner 
of a page, then this signals a change between CC/CS6 functions or features. In this case, pur-
ple CC text and/or a purple-tinted Tip on that page will explain the change, and may also di-
rect you to ﬁnd more information.
12

2
If a CC icon is the only purple in the upper corner of a page, then 
this signals a change between CS6 and CC 
functions or features
Cool Extras—templates & more
Choose File> New from Template and navigate to the Templates folder, which is 
within the Cool Extras folder (which is within the Adobe Illustrator application folder). 
You’ll find more templates and CS6 sample art in Cool Extras.
Shortcuts and keystrokes
Please start by looking at the WOW! Glossary in an appendix at the back of the book for a 
thorough list of power-user shortcuts that you’ll want to become familiar with. The WOW! 
Glossary provides deﬁnitions for the terms used throughout this book, always starting with 
Macintosh shortcuts ﬁrst, then the Windows equivalent (
-Z/Ctrl-Z). Conventions covered 
range from simple general things such as the 
 symbol for the Mac’s Command or Apple 
key, and the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo shortcuts, to important Illustrator-speciﬁc 
conventions, such as 
-G/Ctrl-G for grouping objects, and Paste In Front (
-F/Ctrl-F)/Paste 
In Back (
-B/Ctrl-B) to paste items copied to the clipboard directly in front/back of the 
selected object, and in perfect registration. Because you can now customize keyboard 
shortcuts, we’re restricting the keystroke references in the book to those instances when it’s 
so standard that we assume you’ll keep the default, or when there is no other way to achieve 
that function (such as Lock All Unselected Objects).
Keyboard language differences
13

This book assumes English as the user language, but we realize that many of you are from 
other countries and use keyboards adapted to your own language. Non-English keyboards 
won’t necessarily use the same keyboard shortcuts that we specify throughout the book, so 
we encourage you to check with the Adobe site for a list of keyboard shortcuts applicable to 
your own language.
Keeping up-to-date...
To keep up with the latest CC features and updates, make sure to visit us at 
www.wowartist.com.
A critical Appearance panel setting
Illustrator initially launches with an application default that could inhibit the way Illustrator 
experts work. One of the most powerful features of Illustrator is that, when properly set, you 
can easily style your next object and choose where it will be in the stacking order by merely 
selecting a similar object. But in order for your currently selected object to set all the styling 
attributes for the next object you draw (including brush strokes, live effects, transparency, 
etc.), you must ﬁrst disable the New Art Has Basic Appearance setting from the pop-up menu 
in the Appearance panel (
 shows if it’s enabled). Your new setting sticks even after you’ve 
quit, but needs to be reset if you reinstall Illustrator or trash the preferences. In a few cases, 
we’ll remind you to disable it when necessary, and also, at times, when it’s helpful to have it 
enabled.
If you want your currently selected object to set all styling attribut-
es for the next object, disable New Art Has 
Basic Appearance by choosing it from the 
pop-up menu in the Appearance panel
Everything’s under Window...
If we don’t tell you where to find a panel, look for it in the Window menu!
Locating CC Content
The color purple throughout this book indicates a reference to Illustrator CC. For more details 
and information about how this works, read “Alerting you to CC content,” and the “How This 
Book Is Organized,” and “What’s new in CC?” sections that follow.
HOW THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED...
You’ll ﬁnd a number of different kinds of information woven throughout this book—
Introductions, Tips, Techniques, Galleries, References, and Resources. The book progresses 
in difﬁculty both within each chapter, and from chapter to chapter.
1 Introductions. Every chapter starts with a brief, general universal introduction that applies 
to CS6 and CC, followed by a dedicated CC section. In these introductions you’ll ﬁnd a quick 
overview of relevant creative features, as well as a robust collection of tips and tricks. In fact, 
there is so much info crammed in there it’s likely that you’ll discover new, useful information 
every time you take a look.
14

1
Every chapter begins with an Introduction section that focuses on 
overviews of features
2 Tips. Don’t miss the useful information organized into the universal gray, CC purple, and 
red (important) Tip boxes throughout the book. Usually you’ll ﬁnd them alongside related 
text, but if you’re in an impatient mood, you can quickly ﬂip through, looking for interesting 
or relevant Tips. The red arrows, 
 and red text found in Tips (and sometimes 
with artwork) have been added to emphasize or further explain a concept or technique.
Tip boxes
Look for these gray boxes to find Tips about Adobe Illustrator.
15

Red Tip boxes
Red text and these red Tip boxes convey warnings or other essential information.
Purple CC Tip boxes
Look for purple boxes to ﬁnd Tips about something new in CC.
2
3 Step-by-step lessons. In these detailed sections, you’ll ﬁnd step-by-step techniques gathered 
from artists and designers around the world. Most WOW! lessons focus on one aspect of how 
an image was created, though we’ll often refer you to related techniques covered elsewhere in 
the book. In the universal lessons, we’ve noted those Illustrator CC features that have been 
updated and could alter the lesson’s workﬂow. Feel free to start with almost any chapter, but 
be aware that each technique builds on those previously explained, so you should try to fol-
low the techniques within each chapter sequentially. The later chapters include Advanced 
Technique lessons, which assume that you’ve assimilated the techniques found throughout 
the chapter. The Mastering Complexity chapter is packed with lessons dedicated to advanced 
tips, tricks, and techniques, and most will integrate techniques introduced in the earlier chap-
ters.
16

3
Step-by-step lessons show you how an artist or designer uses a fea-
ture to tackle a creative task
4 Galleries. The Gallery pages consist of images related to techniques demonstrated nearby. 
Each Gallery piece is accompanied by a description of how the artist created that image, and 
may include steps showing the progression of a technique detailed elsewhere. Galleries that 
demonstrate an artist’s use of a new CC feature are clearly marked with a purple banner at the 
17

top. Because these are short and descriptive, you’ll want to take a look even if you’re a CS6 
user, in order to get a clear idea of what updating to Illustrator CC might do for your own art-
work.
4
Galleries provide inspiration from artists and designers living all 
over the world, as well as a peek into their 
approach to creating artwork
18

5 References & Resources. Within the text you’ll occasionally be directed to Illustrator Help 
for more details; to access this, choose Help> Illustrator Help. Illustrator CC subscribers will 
also be directed to the Adobe site for more information regarding Creative Cloud services 
that are included with their subscription. In the back of the book you’ll also ﬁnd a WOW! 
Glossary, a listing of the artists featured in this book, and a General Index.
5
Help is still available from the Window menu or by pressing the F1 
key (if the OS isn’t using that function), pro-
viding access to the latest list of new features 
and short tutorials
6 Where and what is WOW! ONLINE? The best way to learn to create with Illustrator is 
to examine complex art created by professionals. You’re in luck! Many of the artists 
have allowed us to post their works for you to pick apart. Please contact the artists 
(find their contact info in the Artists appendix) to request permissions beyond per-
sonal exploration. To find these artworks and other goodies, see the tip “Look for the 
WOW! ONLINE icon” at the start of this “How to use this book” section.

Your Creative Workspace
Your Creative Workspace
INTRODUCTION
OK, this might not seem like sexy WOW! stuff, but to save time and stay focused on being 
creative, you need to work efﬁciently. In this chapter you’ll ﬁnd tons of things you might 
have missed or overlooked. You’ll ﬁnd tips for customizing your workspace and in-depth 
coverage of newer organizational features such as working with multiple artboards and the 
multi-functional Appearance panel, which can take the place of several panels.
Tabbed docs & the App Frame
• Change whether documents are tabbed (the default) or not through Preferences> User Interface.
• If more documents are open than are visible on tabs, a double-arrow at the tab bar’s right will list them.
• Drag documents away from the tab to make them free-floating.
• Drag an object from one document into another by dragging over that document’s tab. The tab will
spring open to let you drop the object in place.
• On a Mac, you can also turn on the Application Frame (disabled by default) from the Window menu.
The frame contains all the panels and documents, and everything you can do in AI takes place within 
the frame.
Note: You should turn off the Application Frame when using an extended monitor setup (or during video projec-
tion).
ORGANIZING YOUR WORKSPACE
You can save time and frustration if you spend a few minutes choosing your user interface 
Brightness level, setting up custom workspaces, and creating your own document proﬁles. 
The panels you want handy in order to create a bristle brush painting are probably different 
from what you need when creating a technical illustration or the layout for a series of 
brochures. Not all panels are needed for every job, but by organizing all that you deﬁnitely 
need—eliminating all you’ll rarely need or won’t need at all—you’ll be able to locate 
quickly just what you need when you need it. In addition, the Control and Appearance 
panels often contain the same information found in the special-purpose panels, permitting 
you to close some of those panels and streamline your interface even more than you might 
think possible (see the “Using the Appearance panel” section later in this chapter).
In deciding which panels you want on your desktop for any given project, you’ll probably 
ﬁrst want to cluster panels that you will frequently use in sequence, such as Paragraph and 
Character Styles or Transform and Align. You’ll also decide where each panel or group of 
panels should live, and whether, when you collapse them to get them out of your way, you 
want them to collapse to their icon and label, or all the way down to their icon. When you 
have everything arranged to your liking, choose New Workspace from either Window> 
Workspace, or from the pop-up menu in the Application bar. Once you’ve created and 
saved a custom workspace, its name will show up in the Window> Workspace submenu 
and on the Application bar (by default at the top of your working area). Switch workspaces 
by choosing its name. Note that any changes to a workspace, such as a panel opened or 
moved, are temporarily saved when you quit Illustrator so that Illustrator reopens right 
where you left off. To restore a workspace to its original conﬁguration, select the workspace 
and choose Reset (workspace name) from the submenu. Following are tips for arranging 
your panels:
21

• Dock panels to the edges of your screen or, if you want them closer to your work, drag
them around freely. (The Control panel docks to the top or bottom of the screen.)
Dock and stack panels with different 
results by watching 
where the blue highlight 
shows up
• Resize most panels once they’re open. Look for the double-headed arrow when hovering
over an edge to see if the panel can be dragged in that direction.
When you click the double arrow in 
the upper right, open panels will 
cycle through contracted and 
expanded states, which will vary 
depending on how you’ve 
customized the panel; 
customizing the width manually 
when the cursorturns into a 
double-head-ed arrow allows 
you to click-drag to resize the 
panel 
22

• Collapse and expand free-ﬂoating or fully expanded columns to their title bar by double-
clicking the panel name. (If the open panel is one in a column of icons that has been 
temporarily opened by itself, it can’t be reduced to its title bar.) Double-click on the top 
gray bar to collapse a free-ﬂoating panel to an icon. Experiment with expanding and 
minimizing open panels in your workspace to get used to how the panels work, and you’ll 
save time and frustration later when you want to get a panel out of your way quickly.
A double-headed arrow in the upper 
left (next to the panel name) 
indicates that you can display 
more, or few-er, options in the 
panel; the fewest options will be 
shown by default
• If you need multiple panels open at once, place each panel you want open in a separate
column (drag to the side of an existing column until you see the vertical blue bar). Only one 
item in a column of panel icons can be open, but one from each column can be open 
simultaneously and will remain open until you manually close it by clicking on its double 
arrow in the upper right corner. The exception is if you have enabled Auto Collapse Icon 
Panels in Preferences> User Interface. In that case, clicking anywhere outside a panel that 
was opened from an icon will close it for you. Since panels are “spring-loaded,” you can 
still drag items into them even when they’re closed.
23

To minimize a panel opened from a 
column of panels that have been 
reduced to icons, click the 
double ar-row in the upper right 
(you can’t minimize it by double-
clicking the dark gray bar)
Magically appearing panels
If you have used Tab or Shift-Tab to hide your panels, mouse carefully over the narrow strip just before 
the very edge of the monitor where the panels were and they’ll reappear, then hide themselves again 
when you move away.
Using New Document Profiles
When you create a New Document Proﬁle, you can establish not only the size, color mode, 
and resolution of your document, but also whether or not that document includes speciﬁc 
swatches, symbols, graphic styles, brushes, and even what font is chosen as the default. By 
saving this to the New Document Proﬁles preset folder along with your other user Library 
presets, the document appears in the New Document dialog.
Rulers, guides, Smart Guides, and grids
Now that Illustrator offers multiple artboards, you can choose to display the ruler (
-R/
Ctrl-R) as a Global ruler that extends across all your artboards, or as an Artboard ruler, one 
for each artboard with its own x,y coordinate system. The rulers look the same, but if you 
Control-click/right-click on a ruler, or press 
-Option-R/Ctrl-Alt-R, the Change to (Global/
Artboard ruler) command reveals which ruler is active, and you can switch rulers here. In 
order to be consistent with other Adobe programs, new documents by default use Artboard 
rulers and set the origin point at the upper left corner, instead of the lower left. Documents 
created in older versions will still open with Artboard rulers active and the origin point in 
the upper left, but if you switch to the Global Ruler, the origin point will be at the legacy 
lower left corner, as it was when the document was originally created. If you need to work 
with legacy positioning, switch to Global Rulers with your legacy documents to see the old 
24

x,y coordinates. You can still change the location of the origin point by dragging from the 
upper left corner of the rulers to the desired location, but you can give each artboard its own 
origin point when you choose Artboard Rulers.
You can apply guides globally or to individual artboards. To place a non-global guide with 
the Artboard tool selected (Shift-O), drag a guide from the ruler to the active artboard, being 
careful to drag right over the board, not between it and another. If you drag a guide in 
between the artboards, it will place the guide across all artboards.
If you intend to use several guides in a project, you should probably create separate layers 
for speciﬁc sets of guides. By keeping guides on named layers, you not only can easily 
control which guides are visible at any time, but also how the global locking, visibility, and 
clearing of guides is applied. (CC has enhanced guide placement.)
You can also create guides by selecting an object and deﬁning it as a guide by choosing 
Object> Make Guides (
-5/Ctrl-5, or via View> Guides). By default, guides are unlocked, 
but you can lock them using the Lock/Unlock toggle (in the context-sensitive or View 
menus); the Lock/Unlock Guides toggle is global, and affects all guides in all documents. 
Any unlocked guide can be changed into a regular, editable path by targeting the guide and, 
again in the context-sensitive menu, choosing Release Guides. Guides not targeted will not 
be converted.
Smart Guides, which can be powerful aids for constructing and aligning objects as you 
draw, are helpful enough to become an essential part of your workﬂow. Try keeping them 
on (the toggle is 
-U/Ctrl-U). Enable or disable viewing options in Preferences> Smart 
Guides.
Changing measurement units
Control-click/right-click on a ruler to change units of measurement, or cycle units using 
-Option-Shift-
U/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-U. Set default units in Preferences> Units.
Shifting patterns with rulers
When ruler origins move patterns:
• The pattern will NOT shift if you change an Artboard ruler origin.
• All patterns WILL shift if you change a Global ruler origin.
Changing Constrain Angle
If you adjust the X and Y axes in Preferences> General> Constrain Angle, it will affect the drawn objects 
and transformations of your grid, as they will follow the adjusted angle when you create a new object. 
This can be helpful if you’re working in isometrics or another layout requiring alignment of objects at an 
angle.
Hide/Show Edges
The shortcut for Hide/Show Edges is 
-H/Ctrl-H (or choose View> Hide/Show Edges). Once you hide 
the selection edges (paths and anchor points), all path edges in that file will remain hidden until you 
show them again—and that hidden state is saved with your file! Get in the habit of toggling it off when 
you’re done with the task at hand. And, if you open a file and can’t decode the mystery of why things 
don’t appear selected, remember to try 
-H/Ctrl-H.
Three grids
View Illustrator’s automatic grid using View> Show Grid (
-”/Ctrl-”). Illustrator also offers a Perspective 
Grid and a Pixel Grid. For details on the Perspective Grid, see the Reshaping Dimensions chapter, and for 
information on using the Pixel Grid, see the “Web Graphics” section in the Creatively Combining Apps 
chapter.

MASTERING OBJECT MANAGEMENT
Take control of the stacking order of objects right from the beginning, and become familiar 
with the different ways to focus on just the necessary objects at one time.
Although probably the easiest and most important thing that you can do to keep your ﬁle 
organized is to name your layers as you create them, it’s easy to get lazy and just click the 
New Layer icon. To avoid amassing a stack of ambiguously numbered layers, try to get in 
the habit of holding Option/Alt when you click the New Layer icon to name it in the Layer 
Options dialog, or double-click on the layer name itself to rename it. (Of course you can 
double-click to the right of the layer name at any time to access Layer Options and edit the 
name or other settings.) Both the Layers and the Appearance panel are designed primarily to 
help you locate, select, and modify your artwork objects, so you want to take full advantage 
of Illustrator’s changing interface to know just where you are and what you’ll be affecting.
Layers panel and isolation
When you enter isolation mode, only the artwork in the group or layer that’s isolated will be visible in the 
Layers panel. Once you exit isolation mode, the other layers and groups will once again appear in the 
Layers panel.
Using isolation mode
Isolation mode is a quick way to isolate selected objects so you can work on them without 
accidentally affecting other objects. The next time you want to edit an object, group, or 
layer, use isolation mode instead of locking or hiding things that are in the way. In addition 
to you choosing to enter isolation mode, Illustrator will also at times automatically place 
you into a special form of isolation mode, such as when editing symbols, creating patterns, 
or working with opacity masks. Isolation mode focuses your attention as you create and edit 
various types of objects.
See the Tip “Isolation Ins and outs” for a summary of how to enter and exit isolation mode. 
Once you enter, a gray bar appears at the top of your document window, indicating that 
you’re now in isolation mode, and the gray bar displays the hierarchy that contains the 
isolated object. Everything on your artboard except the object(s) you’ve just isolated will be 
dimmed, indicating that those other objects are temporarily locked. If you have isolated an 
object or group, you can expand the isolation to the sublayer or layer that the object is on by 
clicking on the word for that layer in the gray bar. As long as isolation mode is active, 
anything you add to your artboard will automatically become part of the isolated group. 
(Disable “Double-click to Isolate” in Preferences> General to prevent a double-click from 
putting you in isolation mode.)
Isolation mode isn’t limited to objects you’ve grouped yourself. Remember that other types 
of objects—such as blends, envelopes, or Live Paint objects—exist as groups, and isolation 
mode works for them, too. In addition to using isolation mode on groups, you can also use it 
on almost anything—layers, symbols, clipping masks, compound paths, opacity masks, 
images, gradient meshes, and even a single path. The next time you think you have to enter 
Outline mode, or lock or hide objects to avoid grabbing other objects, try isolation mode 
26

instead.
Isolation ins and outs
To enter isolation mode:
• Double-click on an object or group
• Select an object or group and click on the Isolate Selected Object button
 on the Control panel
• Choose Enter Isolation Mode in the Layers panel menu
To exit isolation mode:
• Press the Esc key
• Click on any empty spot on the gray isolation bar
• Double-click an empty spot on the artboard
• Click on the Back arrow on the isolation bar until you’re out
• Choose Exit Isolation Mode from the Layers panel menu
•
-click/Ctrl-click to back out to the next level of isolation
Select Behind
To select objects from the document window that are hidden by other objects without ﬁrst 
having to lock or hide those objects, 
-click/Ctrl-click to Select Object Behind (toggle it 
on/off in Preferences> Selection and Anchor Display). The ﬁrst click brings up the Select 
Behind cursor and selects the topmost object, and each subsequent 
-click/Ctrl-click 
targets the Fill for the next objects in the stacking order. You can’t target Strokes in this 
manner, but if the object has a Fill, you can target the object and use the Appearance panel 
to change the Stroke.

With Paste Remembers Layers enabled (it’s off by default in the Layers panel menu), pasted objects 
retain their layer order, and if the layers don’t exist, Paste Remembers Layers makes them for you! If 
you paste, and it pastes flattened (because it’s disabled), Undo, reverse the toggle, and paste again.
Selecting & targeting indicators in the Layers panel
Many seasoned Illustrator artists have missed the introduction of targeting versus selecting. 
When you simply select objects and apply effects or adjust opacity, the effects might not be 
applied as you expected, and in order to remove or edit the effects you’ll have to carefully 
reproduce this level of selection (see “Decoding appearances” on the next page). If instead 
you apply an effect to a targeted group, layer, or sublayer, then the effects are easy to 
remove (simply target that level again).
To know for sure whether you have successfully targeted a layer, look in the Layers panel, 
where you should see the double-circle as the target indicator for that layer, and a large 
27

square box indicating that you’ve selected all objects within that layer (a small square 
means you have only some objects on that level selected). In addition, in the Appearance 
panel you should see the word “Layer” listed ﬁrst as the thumbnail name (as opposed to 
“Group,” “Path”, or “Mixed Objects”). When a group, layer, or sublayer has an effect 
applied to it, any new objects placed into that level will immediately acquire those effects.
Selection and target indicators (from 
left to right): 1) target in-dicator 
for any layer or subcomponent, 
2) selec-tion is also currently 
tar-geted, 3) target indicator for 
any targeted compo-nent with 
effect applied, 
4) selection indicator for
a container layer, 5) se-lection 
indicator when an object is 
selected, 6) se-lection indicator 
when all objects on a layer are 
se-lected

object sepa-rately); (right) after 
tar-geting the layer or select-ing 
the group and apply-ing the 
effect (it applies to the bounding 
paths only)
Copy and paste techniques
When you copy an object, Illustrator offers a number of power options for how the 
objects are pasted, including Paste in Front, Paste in Back, Paste in Place, and Paste on 
All Artboards. Note that none of these are affected by the ruler origin, but are positioned 
in the same relative position to the upper left corner of the artboard. Here are some of the 
distinctions:
• If you choose Paste in Front or Paste in Back with nothing selected, Illustrator pastes the
cut or copied object at the extreme front or back of the current layer.
• If you choose Paste in Front or Paste in Back with an object selected, Illustrator pastes the
object directly on top of or behind the selected object in the stacking order.
• Paste in Place is the same as Paste in Front with nothing selected, but it pastes to any
selected artboard.
• Paste on All Artboards pastes the object in the same relative position onto each artboard.
29

Using the Appearance panel
You probably know by now that many functions can be handled in the Control panel instead 
of individual panels. The Appearance panel also can replace a number of separate panels, 
making it an indispensable hub for a productive and efﬁcient workﬂow. Here you can view 
or edit a selected object’s stroke, ﬁll, or transparency; check to see if it’s part of a group; or 
adjust an effect or named graphic style applied to it.
In the Appearance panel with a group or layer targeted, double-clicking on Contents reveals 
object-level attributes. With a text object, double-click on Characters to see the basic text 
attributes. You can also add additional strokes or ﬁlls to the object, apply effects and access 
effect dialogs, choose whether or not the next object you draw will have the same 
appearance, or construct a new graphic style to save for future objects. Important concepts 
for using the Appearance panel include the following:
• The basic appearance consists of a stroke and ﬁll (even if set to None), and its
transparency (0%–100% Opacity).
• Apply an appearance to any path, object, group, layer or sublayer.
• The stacking order of attributes affects the ﬁnal appearance, and can be changed simply by
dragging the attribute up or down in the list.
• The visibility of attributes can be toggled on or off by clicking the Eye icon, and multiple
selected items can be unhidden with Show All Hidden Attributes from the panel menu. The 
visibility of thumbnails can be toggled on or off with Show/Hide Thumbnail in the panel 
menu.
• Click on underlined words, such as Stroke, Opacity, or Drop Shadow to open their
respective panels; Shift-click on a swatch icon to open the Color panel.
Decoding appearances
A basic appearance does not include multiple fills or strokes, transparency, effects, or brush strokes. 
More complex appearances are indicated by a gradient-filled circle in the Layers panel. When you need 
to modify artwork created by others (or open artwork you created earlier), it’s essential to have both the 
Appearance and Layers panels visible. Unless an effect is applied at the level of a layer or a group, you 
might not see the filled circle icon until you expand your view of the layer to locate the object that has 
the effect applied.
Many functions reside in the Appear-
ance panel
30

Duplicating fills/strokes/effects
To duplicate a fill or stroke: select the object and click on the Add New Stroke or Add New Fill icon at 
the bottom of the Appearance panel, from the panel menu, or select one or more strokes, fills, and 
effects in the panel and drag them to the Duplicate Selected Item icon at the bottom of the panel.
Drawing with Appearances
Whether or not your new object will have the same attributes as your last-drawn object depends upon 
settings in the Appearance panel menu.
• If New Art Has Basic Appearance is enabled, you’ll be drawing with only the current Stroke, Fill, and
Opacity. Any other attributes from your last-drawn object are ignored.
• If you have disabled New Art Has Basic Appearance, your new art will have the exact same Appearance
as your last object, but you can choose Reduce to Basic Appearance in the panel menu to remove all 
attributes except the Stroke, Fill, and Opacity.
• To eliminate even the Basic Appearance, click on the Clear Appearance icon at 
 the bottom of the
panel, which reduces the selected object to None for Stroke and Fill, and the Default (100%) Opacity.
Graphic styles and the Appearance panel
A graphic style consists of all the attributes applied to an object, group, or layer. If you have 
a single object selected, Control-click/right-click on a style to see a large thumbnail preview 
of the style applied to your object (this won’t work with more than one object selected). 
Save a current appearance by clicking the New Graphic Style button (you can also drag the 
thumbnail from the Appearance panel, or drag the object itself to the Graphic Styles panel). 
Option-drag/Alt-drag the thumbnail on top of an existing graphic style in the Graphic Styles 
panel to replace it.
To add a graphic style to an object that already has a graphic style without removing any of 
the existing attributes, Option-click/Alt-click on the graphic style in the Graphic Styles 
panel. When you look at the Appearance panel, you’ll see the new attributes stacked on top 
of the original attributes.
With a single object selected, Control-
click/right-click on a graphic 
style; an en-larged thumbnail 
shows the style applied to the 
selected object
31

MANAGING MULTIPLE ARTBOARDS
Having multiple artboards allows you to organize work within and across projects in a 
single document, whether you need to create multi-panel storyboards, set up elaborate 
character stagings for animations, organize many elements within a single complex project, 
or even keep multi-sized, collateral business material (such as cards, stationery, envelopes, 
postcards, and brochures) within one document. And then, of course, you can print or 
export to PDF any combination of the artboards that you want into one multi-page PDF, 
even one with multi-sized pages. To help you set up, organize, and work with artboards, 
both the Artboards panel and the Control panel options with the Artboard tool selected 
provide the access and features you’ll need. To manage the artboards themselves, make sure 
you’re familiar with basic artboard functions:
• Set up artboards when you’re conﬁguring a new document, or later on using the Artboards
panel or the Control panel with the Artboard tool active. Artboard conﬁgurations can be 
saved as part of a New Document Proﬁle.
• To add an artboard using the same properties as the currently highlighted artboard, click
on the New Artboard icon. It will be added to the same row as the current artboard, but you 
can rearrange the artboards later.
• Modify artboard settings in the Artboard Options dialog by choosing Artboard Options
from the Artboards menu; double-clicking on the artboard orientation icon in the Artboards 
panel (single-click if the artboard is already active); double-clicking on the Artboard tool; or 
clicking the Artboard Options icon on the Control panel when the Artboard tool is active.
32

• Create and manage artboards manually and interactively by selecting the Artboard tool
(Shift-O) instead of invoking the dialog, dragging artboards to scale and position them, and 
using the Control panel options. Enabling Smart Guides can help with precise manual 
alignment.
• Name your active artboard by double-clicking on the Artboard name and renaming it
directly. Or select the Artboard tool and change its name in either the Control panel or in 
the Artboards Options dialog. The name is listed in the Artboards panel and in the list of 
artboard panels in the status bar (Artboard Navigation, located at the bottom right of the 
document window).
• Rearrange artboards through the Artboards panel menu or Object> Artboards> Rearrange,
choose rows, columns, and spacing; whether or not to move your artwork with the artboard; 
and the last-used settings persist.
• Reorder the list of artboards in the Artboards panel using the up and down arrow icons.
Reordering artboards within the Artboards panel doesn’t change the way the actual 
artboards are arranged in your workspace. However, be aware that the order of artboards in 
the panel determines the order in which artboards print or are ordered when saved as a 
multi-page PDF.
• Use Shift-Page Up or Shift-Page Down to navigate the Artboard panel layers, which will
ﬁll the window with your selected artboard as you navigate.
• Artboards have a reference point. In the Position area of Artboard Options, choose the
reference point from which artboards get resized.
• Overlapping art across multiple artboards, or overlapping artboards onto one piece of art,
allows you to develop multiple versions of the same image without duplicating elements. 
Each artboard will print only those portions of the art wholly contained within its borders, 
allowing you to print or export duplicates, and/or portions of an art piece, from the one 
instance of the art (this is a useful technique for storyboarding and comic strips).
• Convert a non-rotated rectangle to an artboard by choosing Object> Artboards> Convert
to Artboard.
• Use Fit to Artwork Bounds and Fit to Selected Art commands (in the Preset list on the
Control panel when the Artboard tool is selected, or under Object> Artboards), for resizing 
artboards according to their contents.
• To locate an artboard visually when another artboard ﬁlls your view, choose View> Fit All
in Window (
-Option-0/Ctrl-Alt-0). To activate it, click on the artboard with the Selection 
tool or click on its name in the Artboards panel.
• When zooming, the commands Fit Artboard in Window (
-0/Ctrl-0) and Actual Size (
-1/Ctrl-1) affect the active artboard. Double-clicking in the Artboards panel to the right of 
an inactive artboard’s name or on its number on the left (single-click if it’s active), also 
zooms that artboard to Fit Artboard in Window size.
• Export artboards as separate TIFF, JPEG, PSD, or PNG ﬁles when you need a rasterized
version of every artboard in your document.
Design to the edge
By default, artwork that extends beyond an artboard won’t print, making it important to watch not only 
for artwork left off the artboard, but for artwork that has been manually positioned on the page in the 
Print dialog. If your artwork extends beyond the edge of an artboard, make sure you add a bleed setting 
value; if the artwork gets placed in InDesign or saved as EPS, it’s all still visible.

board icons
Copying art between artboards
Working productively and maintaining consistency within a project often means duplicating elements 
from one document to another. With multiple artboards you have a variety of methods to accomplish 
this task, depending upon your needs:
• With the “Move/Copy Artwork with Artboard” icon enabled in the Control panel (Artboard tool selected),
hold down the Option/Alt key while dragging an active artboard to a new location in order to duplicate 
the artboard and all its contents.
• Use Edit> Paste (
-Option-Shift-V/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-V) on all artboards to copy artwork from one artboard
to the same position on all artboards of any size.
• Turn artwork created on one artboard into a symbol, then drag that symbol from the shared Symbols
panel to any other artboard. Now just update the symbol to update all instances of it used on any 
artboards.
• Using the Measure tool, measure the distance between the artwork and where you want it on another
artboard, and use Transform> Move to move or copy the artwork.
• Apply the Transform effect on a layer to copy “instances” of artwork to another artboard in the same
relative position.
RELATED TIPS
Units and math in panels
To enter the current unit of measurement, type a number, then press Return/Enter, or Tab to the next 
text field. To use a different unit of measurement, follow the number with in or " (for inch), pt (point), p 
(pica), px (pixel), or mm (millimeter), and press Return/Enter or Tab. To resume typing into an image 
text block, press Shift-Return. To enter calculations in panels, for example, type 72pt+2mm into the H 
field, or type +2 to add two of whatever unit you’re currently using. Try it!
What does (pt) mean?
You’ll sometimes see parentheses around units in this book, such as 1 (pt). If your 
document is using that unit, you can just enter that numeric value into ﬁelds. To enter the 
value and unit use 1pt, but do not include the parentheses.
Why use New Window?
Choose Window> New Window to display different aspects of your current image simultaneously. You 
can view the same art separately, and in different View modes (Preview, Outline, Overprint, or Pixel), or 
with different Proof Setups (including for color blindness), or Zoom levels. Use Arrange Documents on 
the Application bar to organize them or to make edges hidden or visible. Most choices from the View 
menu are saved with the file along with the new windows.

 THE CREATIVE CLOUD WORKSPACE
Your subscription to Creative Cloud comes with new interface options and features. Most 
of the time, you can run Illustrator CC without being connected to the internet or logged 
into your Creative Cloud account. However, some options require that you are both online 
and signed into Creative Cloud. For example, in order to receive notiﬁcation of available 
updates, to sync your settings, post to Behance, or use Typekit fonts (see the Designing 
Type and Layout chapter for more on this), you’ll need to have an active connection to your 
Creative Cloud account.
In addition to discussing new CC settings and services that are integrated with Illustrator, 
this section will also cover updates to the way Illustrator CC itself looks and functions, 
including HiDPI (high DPI) compatibility for Windows 7 & 8 (support for retina displays 
was added in CS6), creating a Custom Tools panel, and new implementation of keyboard 
modiﬁers for added functionality.
Adobe Add-ons is the new online mar-
ketplace for plug-ins, scripts, 
and other assets offered

35

The Creative Cloud app displaying 
update status; the Cre-
ative Cloud pop-up menu
Behance
Your subscription includes membership in Behance. Adobe’s social media site encourages 
artists to collaborate privately, ask advice from others, or display a portfolio for interested 
parties. Typical of sharing sites, terms of service may claim the right to use images posted 
to Behance without permission or compensation.
Illustrator and the Creative Cloud app
Now that Illustrator is integrated with Adobe’s Cloud services, you’re able to use the 
Creative Cloud app to do myriad things, such as manage your subscription to Illustrator, 
keep your version up to date, sync fonts from the Typekit service, access ﬁles you have 
uploaded to your personal Creative Cloud, and manage your Behance account. By default 
the Creative Cloud app installs an icon on your Apple menu bar, or your Windows taskbar, 
and launches when you log in to your computer. However, you can change this behavior 
from the Preferences command in its pop-up menu. If you’re having trouble signing in to 
your Adobe services or updating Illustrator, your Creative Cloud app is the ﬁrst place to 
look for clues as to why.
Sync your settings and assets
If you have more than one computer, Sync Settings is a Creative Cloud feature that lets you 
use your Cloud storage to quickly copy your workspaces, shortcuts, preferences, presets, 
and assets such as swatches and brushes from one computer to another. To decide what 
settings to sync, choose Preferences> Sync Settings, or choose your Adobe ID (Illustrator 
menu on Mac or Edit menu on Windows)> Manage Sync Settings. Enable the settings you 
want to transfer, then select what to do if a conﬂict arises between settings on your machine 
and settings stored in the Cloud. You can then choose Sync Settings Now in Preferences, or 
you can sync any time a document is open by clicking on the Sync Settings icon in the 
bottom left corner of a document window. Just remember that Sync Local means your local 
settings become top dog, uploading settings to the Cloud, while Sync Cloud downloads 
settings from the Cloud to your computer. You can also simply choose to overwrite the 
36

oldest ﬁle with the newest, wherever it is.
Edit> Settings> Import/Export also allows you to import a settings ﬁle, or create a ﬁle from 
settings to export as a conventional ﬁle. Use the ﬁle for backup, or to share settings with 
others without using the Cloud.

The Custom Tools panel
Although Illustrator has long allowed you to “tear off” sets of tools when you drag on the 
arrow at the right end of the tearaway strip, you can now build your own custom collections 
with any icons from the Tools panel. To make a custom panel, choose Window> Tools> 
New Tools panel and name it. Initially, your custom panel will only contain the Swatch 
Proxy icon, which can’t be removed. To add the ﬁrst tool, drag it to the custom panel and 
drop it on the large + icon (plus), which is then replaced by your tool. For each additional 
tool, your cursor will display a + (plus) to indicate you can add the tool, while a blue line 
indicates where in the panel the tool will be added when you let go. To access tools hidden 
beneath others, ﬁrst use the tear-off panel to make all those tools visible. Swap the position 
of one tool with another in your panel by holding down the Option/Alt key and dragging 
one tool on top of the other. To remove a tool from the panel, ﬁrst make sure you have a 
document open, then simply drag the tool off the panel and release when you see the minus 
sign added to your cursor.
37

A custom Tools panel begins with just 
a + sign, but you can drag in 
as many tools as you wish, and 
even dis-play it in two rows by 
clicking the upper-right double 
arrow
38

To rename, copy, or delete your panels, choose Window> Tools> Manage Tools Panel. You 
can create multiple custom Tools panels and have multiple Tools panels open at the same 
time. They behave like other panels—open one and it persists in the workspace until you 
decide to reset that workspace to its default conﬁguration.
Enhanced keyboard and mouse functions
You can now access enhanced functionality and added controls via your keyboard or mouse 
(see Tip New Pen Pencil path editing for where to ﬁnd info about Pen tool changes):
• To draw or resize an artboard from its center, hold down the Option/Alt key when
dragging on a corner with the Artboard tool.
• To place ﬁles without opening the File menu, press 
-Shift-P/Ctrl-Shift-P.
• To change Opacity, click on the triangle beside the numeric input ﬁeld to access a slider
(in CS6 you’ll see a list of presets). The slider was restored by popular request.
• To cancel creating guides or altering zoom level with the Zoom tool, press the Esc key
while still dragging and before releasing the mouse. This also cancels dragging with the 
Selection, Direct Selection, and Print Tiling tools, and ends drawing an open path with the 
Pen tool.
Better guide creation
To quickly create a guide at a speciﬁc location, double-click directly on the ruler at that 
location. For instance, double-click on a horizontal guide to place a vertical ruler, or press 
Shift and double-click to force the guide to the nearest tick mark. To create crossing 
horizontal and vertical guides at a speciﬁc point, hold 
 (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows), and then 
click-drag the guide from the upper-left corner of the rulers to your artboard. Pressing the 
Esc key before completing the drag cancels creating guides, including dragging to change 
the 0 location of the x,y coordinates.
CC RELATED TIPS
Keep it closed, please
When you save your ﬁle, Illustrator now remembers which of your layers were in an 
expanded state and which were collapsed. You’ll ﬁnd them as you left them when you 
reopen the document.
Seeing spots
If you ever use Separations Preview with Overprint enabled, you’ll be pleased to notice that 
Illustrator now includes the option to display only those spot colors actually used in the 
artwork.
Layers panel cursors
Illustrator CC restores copying feedback missing from the CS6 Layers panel: holding 
Option/Alt as you drag a layer or selection indicator, you’ll once again see a + indicating 
you’re about to copy (instead of move).

KIMBALL
Mike Kimball
Commissioned by the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy to create a poster 
for the 75th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge, Mike Kimball produced an 
illustration that focused on the bridge’s streamlined Art Deco design. He simpliﬁed 
the detail in the bridge to eliminate construction details that distracted from its 
design lines, and restricted the number of colors in keeping with posters of that 
period. Critical to achieving the strong perspective favored by the client were the 
hand-drawn perspective guides Kimball placed on a layer above the artwork. To 
make them, he drew a line along the left and right cables (the extreme right was 
cropped from view later), created intermediate lines with Object> Blend> Make, 
then chose View> Guides> Make Guides. A second set of guides marked the 
cable width. He organized the illustration with separate layers for the bridge itself, 
the highlights, shadows, and the sky. He made extensive use of blending modes, 
opacity, and gradients to create highlights and shadows, while Gaussian Blur 
softened the clouds. When ﬁnished, Kimball’s poster echoed a style from the day 
the famous bridge opened.

SELLERS
Tracing a Template
Manually Tracing a Template Layer
Overview: Place a scan on a template layer in Illustrator; manually trace over the template 
using the Pencil, Pen, and Arc tools; modify paths with the Direct Selection tool; use geo-
metric objects for ease and speed.
Rachel Sellers used Illustrator’s basic drawing tools to build this skyline for Thirty-
Third Latitude Properties. Using a scanned sketch as a template, Sellers relied on 
Illustrator’s Pencil, Pen, and basic geometric tools to draw the skyline and artwork 
in the logo.
1 Placing a scanned image as a template. Scan your source image at a high enough res-
olution and contrast to see the detail you need for tracing, and save it as a PSD, 
TIFF, or JPG. In a new Illustrator document, choose File> Place, select your scan, 
enable the Template option at the lower-left of the dialog, and click Place. Your scan 
is now on a Template layer beneath the original layer. Template names are italic, in-
dicating that they’re non-printing layers. Template layers are also automatically 
dimmed to 50% opacity, but you can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the Tem-
plate thumbnail in the Layers panel.

2 Tracing straight lines and corners; repositioning points. With the template as a guide, 
select Layer 1 (the default layer in the Layers panel) and with the Pen tool, using the 
scan as a guide, click to place anchor points that will connect with straight lines. To 
draw horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines while you trace, hold down the Shift key 
as you click with the Pen tool. Once you’ve drawn a basic path, zoom in close and 
use the Direct Selection tool to adjust positioning of anchor points. Instead of being 
more precise, Sellers used her rough sketch as a guideline for a stylized interpreta-
tion of the Atlanta skyline.

after tracing (left) to reshape the 
drawing of a building (right)
3 Tracing and adjusting curved paths. Illustrator offers several options to create curved 
paths. To create curves using the Pen tool, instead of clicking to place a corner point 
attached to a straight line, you click and drag in the direction that the curve is head-
ing, then click and drag on the other side of the bump of a curve (this takes 
practice!). To adjust the curves, use the Direct Selection tool to drag its direction 
handles. Click the Convert icons in the Control panel to convert anchor points be-
tween corners and curves, and grab a direction handle with the Convert Anchor 
Point tool to hinge a smooth curve.
To draw with the Pencil tool, double-click its icon to adjust Fidelity (accuracy) and 
Smoothness sliders (in CC you adjust one Fidelity slider). You can further control 
how smooth or detailed your paths are by zooming in or out before drawing or 
editing with the Pencil or Smooth tools. Zoom out to create smoother lines (fewer 
anchor points) or zoom in for more accuracy. You can also redraw any selected path 
by drawing close to it with the Pencil tool (you can adjust Within value in Options).

If your curve is a simple arc, consider the Arc tool (located behind the Line Segment 
tool). To use it, click and drag a curved path. After drawing the arc, you can reshape 
its path as you would any curve, by using the Direct Selection tool to adjust handles 
and anchor points.
4 Using basic objects to help build your image. To speed up drawing, use ready-made 
geometric objects like rectangles and ellipses. Create triangles using the Polygon or 
Star tool by clicking the desktop and changing Sides to 3 in the tool’s dialog. Add 
paths and filled objects with the Pen or Pencil tools, or use the Pathfinder panel or 
Shape Builder tool to combine objects (find out more about these tools in the Re-
thinking Construction chapter).

Stop drawing!
If you’ve drawn an open path and don’t deselect it, your next click with the Pen tool will continue the 
same path. To stop the current path and start a new path, in CS6 press the P key (for the Pen tool); in 
CC you can press the ESC key.
RUDMANN
Basic to Complex
Starting Simple for Creative Composition
Overview: Start with simple elements to build complexity; create layers to keep elements 
separated for easy modiﬁcations; use a Live Paint group to organize many small details.
When Andrew Rudmann set out to create the art piece “And Then I Swam,” he 
began with a simple outline and a very few basic elements. He defined a color 
group, created clusters along with the basic elements, and then layered all of them 
to form more complex imagery. He also created a Live Paint group in order to draw 
forms without having to draw each path as a closed object. By slowly building 
complexity from very simple beginnings, he was able to control the results he 
sought to capture his vision.
1 Beginning with a simple sketch and simple objects. Rudmann began with the Pen tool 
48

(P), sketching the structure that would tell the story. Since he was going to create 
the water from a single diamond shape he would modify, he only needed to sketch 
the proportions and placement of his elements. He used the Artboard tool (Shift-O) 
to adjust the artboard to fit the composition.
He next auditioned his basic elements, coloring them, and combining some of them 
into larger elements. To determine the colors for the piece, he first chose the 
background color: “My base color is usually very obnoxious, acidic, or 
uncomfortable so I tend to dull down the other colors in the piece,” he said. He 
selected his final choice of four colors and saved them as a color group (Boat) by 
clicking the New Color Group icon in the Swatches panel.
To keep the process of building up the art from basic elements as fluid as possible, 
he found a method that minimized working with panels, and allowed him to keep 
his attention on the artboard. Selecting a diamond (or cluster of diamonds) that he 
wanted to duplicate and modify, he copied, used Paste in Front (or Back), and then 
used the Free Transform tool (E). He often ungrouped his clusters to freely modify 
and randomize a cluster by transforming some of the individual diamonds.

placement of his forms and 
their proportions, cropped to

group
2 Using layers to organize complex objects. Despite working freely, Rudmann needed 
to be able to access portions of the image for modifications. The illusion of organic 
chaos and randomly placed elements requires some control, and separating sec-
tions with just a few layers, descriptively named, made all the difference as he 
worked. He could lock all the layers to prevent moving artwork already in place, 
and turn off visibility for some layers in order to concentrate on just one region 
without distraction. He created the illusion of depth and distance by placing small 
waves behind the big waves, yet kept each set of waves accessible by putting the 
smaller waves on a layer beneath the big waves. Rudmann sandwiched the man and 
his boat on a layer between the large and small diamond-shaped waves, and the big 
splash came last.
50

the artwork in order to 
concentrate on a single area
3 Using Live Paint to quickly ﬁll the man with dripping water. After Rudmann drew the 
outlines for the boat and the man, he used the Pen tool to freely draw open paths 
for the dripping water on the man, and a few stripes to signify his bucket. So that he 
could fill the interior (white) areas where these paths overlapped, he turned them 
all into a Live Paint Group. He didn’t have to draw fully enclosed objects before fill-
ing them, as long as the outlines overlapped and formed enclosed areas. (See the 
Rethinking Construction chapter for more on using Live Paint.)

A Live Paint Group allows for color-
ing objects without hav-ing to 
draw each of them as separate 
objects made from closed paths

Navigating Layers
Creating, Organizing, and Viewing Layers
Overview: Customize Layers panel defaults; create layers and sublayers; move layers in the 
Layers panel’s hierarchy; change layer colors; hide layers to view artwork.
Layers are a great way to create and organize artwork as you work and view finished 
artwork when you’re done. To design a mock-up of a web app for 
www.cartagram.com/MadisonAL, Steve Gordon created the artwork for each page 
on its own layer. He was able to hide and show layers to see how the design of 
different pages looked when viewed in different sequences.
1 Changing the Layers panel defaults and creating sublayers. For his mock-up Gordon 
planned on creating a “master” layer for each page with separate sublayers for the 
artwork comprising the page header, navigation bar, content container, footer, and 
52

page background. To see more layers at once, he changed the default row height 
and turned off thumbnail display in the Layers panel. To set up layer options to 
look like Gordon’s, select Layers Panel Options from the panel menu and choose 
Small from the Row Size list (if you prefer larger row sizes, simply disable the choic-
es in the Thumbnails list). You can change the default layer name, “Layer 1,” as Gor-
don did by double-clicking the layer name in the Layers panel.
To create sublayers within this first master layer, select the layer in the panel and 
Option-click/Alt-click the Create New Sublayer icon at the bottom of the panel. In 
the Layer Options dialog, name the sublayer. Repeat this for each of the sublayers 
you need. Gordon completed the mock-up of the Home page by creating artwork on 
each of the sublayers.

ing master layers for web pages 
and their sublayers

ate New Sublayer icon to bring 
up the Layer Options dialog

2 Duplicating and moving master layers, and changing the Layers panel display. With the 
first master layer completed, Gordon created master layers for other pages in his 
mock-up. If your design uses common artwork, like Gordon’s page elements, con-
sider duplicating a layer and then editing the artwork unique to that layer. To dupli-
cate a layer, drag it to the panel’s Create New Layer icon or select Duplicate from 
the Layers panel menu.
To change the order of your master layers or sublayers, select a layer (Shift-click to 
select contiguous layers or 
-click/Ctrl-click for non-contiguous layers) and drag it 
to the desired position in the Layers panel (watch the bar icon in the panel as you 
drag to make sure it’s going between layers, not within another layer).
To make the Layers panel easier to navigate at a glance, give each master layer and 
its sublayers a unique color in the panel. For the master layer, double-click to the 
right of its name in the Layers panel and pick a color from the Color menu in the 
Layer Options dialog. For the sublayers, Shift-select them and choose Options for 
Selection from the panel menu.

3 Using the Visibility layer control to mimic user movement between pages. After Gordon 
completed mock-ups for each of the pages, he made all master layers visible in the 
Layers panel by choosing Show All Layers from the panel menu. Then Gordon 
clicked each layer’s visibility (Eye) icon to hide its artwork, displaying the artwork 
of the page on the layer below it. This provided a preview of what users would see 
moving from one page to another, assuring that the design of the pages were com-
patible.

Running on empty
To easily spot an empty layer in the Layers panel, make sure to disable the Show Layers Only option in 
the Layers Panel Options dialog. A layer name without a black triangle in front of it is empty.

Illustrator can automatically expand the Layers panel and scroll to a selected object within hidden 
layers; just select an object in your artwork and click 
 the Locate Object icon.

Basic Appearances
Making and Applying Appearances
Overview: Create appearance attributes for an object; build a two-stroke appearance, save it 
as a style, and then draw paths and apply the style; target a layer, create a drop shadow ef-
fect, create symbols in the layer, and then edit layer appearance if needed.
Complexity meets simplicity when you use Illustrator’s Appearance panel to design 
intricate effects, develop reusable styles, and simplify production workflow. For this 
map of downtown Dixon, Illinois, cartographer Steven Gordon built complex 
appearances and applied them to objects, groups, and layers.
1 Building an appearance for a single object. Gordon developed a set of appearance at-
tributes that applied a soft vignette and blue fill to a shape representing the river. 
To begin building appearance attributes, open the Appearance panel and click the 
56

panel’s Clear Appearance icon to clear all attributes in the shape you’re about to 
draw (including Illustrator’s default black stroke and white fill attributes). Gordon 
first drew the outline of the water with the Pen tool and then gave the path a medi-
um-blue fill. To accentuate the shoreline, he applied a dark Inner Glow effect. To do 
this he opened the Appearance panel and clicked on the Fill attribute. Then from 
the fx icon in the Appearance panel he chose Stylize> Inner Glow. In the Inner 
Glow dialog, he changed the Mode to Multiply, set Opacity to 70%, and adjusted the 
Blur to 0.05 inches (for the width of the vignette edge), making sure the Edge op-
tion was enabled. To finish the glow, he clicked the dialog’s color swatch and chose 
black for the glow color.

low) the river with the In-ner 
Glow effect added to the

ished set of attributes with an

2 Creating a style for your street paths. To create “cased” or outlined streets, make a 
multi-stroke style that you can apply to all streets. Gordon started by deselecting all 
objects and clicking the Clear Appearance icon to eliminate the attributes for the 
river he had created previously. To build cased streets like Gordon’s, click the 
Stroke attribute and choose a light color swatch and a 2-pt width. Next, add a sec-
ond stroke by clicking the Add New Stroke icon in the Appearance panel. Because 
the new stroke has the same attributes as the first stroke, select the bottom of the 
two strokes and change it to a darker color and a 3-pt width. In order to reuse this 
set of appearance attributes, open the Graphic Styles panel and Option-click/Alt-
click the New Graphic Style icon at the bottom of the panel and then name your 
new style.
58

create the map’s cased 
streets
3 Assigning a style to a group. If you apply a style like the cased streets to a selection 
of paths, the outline of a path will overlap and interrupt the outlines of paths below 
it. If you apply a style to a group of paths instead, the style will surround the group, 
merging strokes where they overlap. To do this, select the paths you wish to merge, 
then select and Group (
-G/Ctrl-G). Now make sure that Group is highlighted in 
the Appearance panel and apply your new cased streets style.

plied to the individual 
paths; (right) the style 
applied to street paths

4 Assigning appearance attributes to an entire layer. Instead of applying styles to indi-
vidual objects, like the iconic “map symbols” on the map, Gordon applied a style to 
the layer itself and then added symbols to that layer. To do the same, create a layer 
for the symbols and click the layer’s target indicator in the Layers panel. From the 
fx icon in the Appearance panel, select Stylize> Drop Shadow. Now each “map sym-
bol” you draw or paste on that layer will be painted automatically with the drop 
shadow. You can modify the drop shadow by clicking the layer’s targeting icon and 
then clicking the Drop Shadow attribute in the Appearance panel and changing val-
ues in the pop-up Drop Shadow dialog.

KLEMA
Guides for Arcs
Designing with Guides, Arc, and Pen Tools
Overview: Create guides on one side of the artboard; reﬂect and copy guides to the other 
61

side; create an arc with the Arc tool; cut and extend the arc with the Pen tool; reﬂect and 
copy the arc and join with the two arcs using the Pen tool; print templates using the Tile op-
tion.
Tasked with building a garden gate as a functional sculpture for an outdoor 
exhibition on the grounds of the Norman Rockwell Museum, artist Stephen Klema 
sat down with Illustrator to create life-sized drawings that would serve as templates 
for cutting the sculpture’s wood pieces.
1 Creating the document and positioning guides. To start, Klema made a new document 
with the same dimensions as those of the constructed gate (80" tall by 44" wide). 
Next, he turned on rulers (
-R/Ctrl-R) and dragged guides from the rulers. To po-
sition a guide more precisely, first make sure that guides are unlocked (go to View> 
Guides and choose Lock Guides if it has a check mark before its name), and select 
the guide and use the Control panel’s Transform fields to enter values for the X or Y 
position of the guide on the artboard.
If your artwork will be symmetrical, like Klema’s, you can create guides on one side 
of the document and then select and copy them to the other side. Start by creating a 
guide in the exact middle of the document. An easy way to do this is to drag a new 
guide from the ruler and, making sure that guides are still unlocked, click the 
Horizontal Align Center icon in the Control panel to center it horizontally on the 
artboard (be sure that you’ve chosen Align to Artboard in the Control panel). Next, 
activate Smart Guides from the View menu (this will help position the cursor over 
the exact middle of the document). Finally, select all of the guides you’ve created, 
choose the Reflect tool (it’s hidden under the Rotate tool icon) and Option-click/
Alt-click on the guide you created in the middle of the document. From the Reflect 
dialog, choose Vertical as the Axis and click on the Copy button.
62

right, selected guides 
(colored magenta) that will be 
reﬂected and copied to the other 
side of the artboard
2 Drawing an arch. Klema turned to the Rectangle, Arc, Ellipse, and Pen tools to 
draw the different objects in his illustration. For the inner arch, Klema selected the 
Arc tool (hidden under the Line Segment tool) and double-clicked its icon to bring 
up the Arc Segment Tool Options dialog. Because he planned on drawing from the 
center guide outward to the left, Klema clicked on the dialog’s Base Along menu 
and selected the Y Axis option. Next, he clicked on the center guide and dragged 
down and to the left until the arc was shaped the way he wanted. Depending on the 
shape of the arc you need, you may have to draw it wider or longer. If that’s the 
case, you’ll need to cut the arc with the Scissors tool as Klema did so that it fits the 
width of the arch shape you want. Next, extend the arc downward as a straight line 
by selecting the Pen tool, clicking the bottom endpoint of the arc, and then Shift-
clicking below to complete the straight line. Duplicate the extended arc using the 
Reflect tool and the center guide, just as you did in the previous step with the 
guides. Klema connected the bottom endpoints of the two extended arcs with the 
Pen tool, creating a single object.

3 Printing templates for construction. After drawing all the objects in his design, Klema 
printed the full illustration and separate illustrations of each of the gate parts (he 
used the Tile option in the Print dialog because the pieces were bigger than his 
printer paper). The prints served as templates that he traced on the wood so that he 
could precisely cut out the individual pieces of the gate. He used the full-sized illus-
tration as a guide for assembling the gate parts into the finished sculpture.

WIGHAM
Auto-Scaling Art
Apply Effects and Graphic Styles to Resize
Overview: Draw using picas and points to easily approximate feet and inches; calculate 
units to work with and amounts to scale by; apply a Transform effect to duplicate, scale, 
and move artwork in one step, and duplicate the effect to apply different settings; use a 
Graphic Style to save effect settings.
As she was designing a kitchen, Laurie Wigham learned she needed to provide 
others with the same model at different sizes: She worked at 1 pica to the foot, but 
the builders needed plans at 1/2" to a foot and the city wanted large prints. She 
chose the Transform effect to duplicate and scale her art so that changes made to 
her original plan would automatically be updated in the scaled version.
1 Setting the scale for the architectural drawing. To create and visualize objects in their 
real-world inches and feet, Wigham set Illustrator’s measurement units to picas—
there are 12 points per pica, so each point represented one inch and each pica one 
foot. She drew most of the artwork, including the keys, selected it all, and chose Ob-
ject> Artboards> Fit to Artwork Bounds. When she needed to submit rough plans 
to her contractor, she needed to figure out how to get from this small version to the 
1/2"= 1' scale. She first changed her ruler to inches and noticed that 1/2" (which 
would represent 1' in the larger scale) = 3 picas. Therefore if 1 pica = 1', she would 
need to multiply by 3 (300%) to get 3 picas to equal 1'. She then noted the width of 
her artboard (2.63 inches), so that plus a bit more for space gave her an approxi-
mate distance to use for moving the copy she was going to make.

plete before adding the 
Transform effect

2 Targeting for the Transform effect. In order for the Transform effect to duplicate art 
to other artboards as new objects are added to it, all the art has to be within a mas-
ter layer, and the master layer itself must be targeted. Once an effect is properly ap-
plied to a targeted master layer, any objects added to the layers within will automat-
ically inherit that effect (see the warning Tip Getting targeted to move).
2
Indicators in Layers and Appearance 
panels showing the mas-ter 
layer targeted (not just objects)
3 Applying the Transform effect. With the layer targeted, Wigham clicked the fx icon 
at the bottom of the Appearance panel and chose Distort & Transform> Transform. 
Wigham anchored the transformation reference point to the upper left corner (an 
easy reference point to work from), set the distance for the move and the amount to 
scale it by (300%), and entered 1 for copies. To check everything was working 
properly for the transform, she enabled Preview. Once Wigham saw that her 
artwork du-plicated and scaled properly, she clicked OK. 
68

To preserve the effect to apply it any time in the future that she needed this same 
transformation, she created a Graphic Style (Option-click/Alt-click on the New 
Graphic Style icon in the Graphic Styles panel to name it while adding it). Now she 
could freely edit, add, and subtract ob-jects in her kitchen’s West Elevation. The 
objects on this artboard weren’t selectable or directly editable, but would print. 
When her plan was finished, she drew an art-board around the scaled artwork and 
printed it.

move artwork with the 
Transform effect—the 
Vertical setting is for viewing 
on the monitor only, serving 
no other practical purpose
69

To make a version for the city permits, she duplicated the effect in the Appearance 
panel by dragging it to the Duplicate Selected Item icon. She turned off the visibility 
for the first instance. She next drew an 11"x17" artboard roughly 20 points to the left 
from the other side of her master artboard (so the master was now between the two 
scaled versions). She double-clicked on the Transform effect to open the dialog, and 
this time played with the settings in the dialog until her drawing filled the page. She 
saved this as another Graphic Style. With both Transform effects in the Appearance 
panel, she toggled their visibility each time she needed one scaled version or 
another.
Getting targeted to move
To target the master layer for an effect, be sure to click directly on the layer’s target (circle) and note 
that the square is large and the Appearance panel shows “Layer” as the selected item. If you’re not 
really careful you might accidentally apply an effect to an object or sublayer, instead of applying it to the 
master layer.

COGHILL
George Coghill
Cartoon logo and character artist George Coghill works with two distinct sets of 
tools to create cartoon logos—one set for the character art, and one for the design 
and type elements. He’s able to be even more productive now that his Workspace 
presets include Custom Tools panels. Coghill starts cartoon logo creation with the 
character art, using the more organic creation tools such as the Pen tool, various 
Brushes, the Width tool, and the Shape Builder tool. Once the vector art for the 
character is complete, he then designs the full logo using the Type tool and 
multiple Shape tools. He includes the Pen and Selection tools in both 
environments. The ﬁrst thing Coghill does is create a new Custom Tools panel by 
choosing Window> Tools> New Tools Panel, entering the name “Art Tools” in the 
dialog, and clicking OK. One at a time, he click-drags each desired tool from the 
default Tools panel onto his new custom panel.
71

Coghill arranged his desired layout of panels best suited for character creation 
(Appearance, Brushes, Swatches, Color, Layers, and Graphic Styles) and saved 
this new workspace conﬁguration by choosing Window> Workspace> New 
Workspace, entering the name “Character Design,” and clicking OK to save the 
workspace. He repeated this process for his desired custom tools and workspace 
panel arrangement for the logo design aspect of the creation process. Coghill can 
then work in a customized vector art environment suited perfectly to the task at 
hand and switch between the toolsets with ease.

Designing Type & Layout
Designing Type & Layout
INTRODUCTION
This chapter focuses on tips and tricks related to working with the type tools, 
as well as design and layout. While Chapter 1 covers the basics of working 
with multiple artboards, you’ll find some of the more advanced issues of 
working with multiple artboards later on in this introduction, and in lessons 
in this chapter.
The seven Type panels
For creating and manipulating type, Illustrator offers no fewer than seven panels, all 
accessible from the Window> Type sub-menu. In addition to the usual Paragraph, Character, 
and Styles panels, you’ll find panels for Open Type, Tabs, and Glyphs.
TYPES OF TYPE
There are three kinds of type objects in Illustrator: Point type, Area type, and 
Path type. The Type tool lets you click to create a Point type object, click-drag 
to create a box for an Area type object, or click on a path to create Path type. 
(See the CC section later in this chapter for how you can convert Point type to 
and from Area type.) Click within any existing type object to enter or edit 
text. To exit type editing mode, press the Esc key; to be poised to start 
creating or editing another type object, hold down the /Ctrl key 
(temporarily turning your cursor into a Selection tool) and click outside the 
text block, or reselect the Text tool. Some features for manipulating type 
include the following:
• Point type never wraps to a new line. To add another line of text without also
adding a new paragraph (so your paragraph style applies to all the lines), 
press the Shift-Return/Enter key. Use Return/Enter to add another line as a 
new paragraph (so you can change paragraph styles).
To scale Point type, use the Selection tool to select the type and drag on one 
of the handles of the bounding box. Both the type and the bounding box scale 
together. Use modifier keys as you would with any object to constrain 
proportions or scale from the center.
• Area type automatically wraps to the next line. Use the Return/Enter key to
start a new paragraph within an Area type object.
73

DONAL JOLLEY
Hovering the cursor over the edge of an object reveals the Area Type cursor, then 
click to enter the desired text; the object can be easily 
re-shaped, causing the text to reﬂow
To scale Area type, use the Selection tool to scale just the bounding box itself; 
the type will reflow inside the area, but remain the same size. To scale the 
bounding box and the type, choose the Free Transform tool (E) before 
dragging on the bounding box handles.
Create a custom container for Area type by constructing a path with any tool. 
With a closed path, choose either of the Area Type tools and click on the path 
(not inside the object) to place text within the confines of the path. Hold 
down the Option/Alt key to create Area type with an open path when the 
Area Type tool is not selected.
Use the Direct Selection tool to distort a container object for Area type by 
grabbing an anchor point and dragging on it, or reshape the path by 
adjusting direction lines. The text within your Area type object will reflow to 
fit the new shape of the confining object.
Use the Area Type Options dialog (Type> Area Type Options) to gain precise 
control over a number of important aspects of Area type, such as numerical 
values for the width and height, precise values for rows and columns, offset 
options, the alignment of the first baseline of text, and how text flows 
between rows or columns (by choosing one of the Text Flow options).
74

• Path type ﬂows text along the path of an object. Create Path type by clicking
on a path with the Type tool; the path become unstroked and unfilled, and is 
ready to receive text.
Turning the corner—Path type
When type on a tightly curved path is squeezed together or spread apart, 
choose Type> Type on a Path> Type on a Path Options and choose Center 
from the Align to Path menu. Set Baseline Shift to 0 in the Character panel, 
and move the path until the type is where you want it on the page.
—Steven H. Gordon
A Path type object has three brackets—the beginning bracket, which has an in
port; a center bracket; and an end bracket, which has an out port. Use the 
ports to thread text between objects (see the Tip “Ports defined” later in the 
chapter). Use the center bracket to control positioning the type along the 
path.
To position type on a path, hover your cursor over the path until the cursor 
turns into an upside down T. Dragging the center bracket along the path 
moves the type toward the beginning or end. Dragging across the path flips 
the type to the other side of the path. For example, type running outside of a 
circle will flip to the inside.
To automatically reflow type along a path, use the Direct Selection tool to 
reshape the path. Set or adjust Path type attributes with the Type on a Path 
Options dialog (Type> Type on a Path> Type on a Path Options). Choose 
different Type on a Path effects (such as Rainbow or Stair Step), enable Flip 
to automatically flip type to the other side of the path, set the alignment of 
type relative to the path, and use a Spacing control to adjust the type as it 
moves around a curve. You can also access Type on a Path effects through the 
Type> Type on a Path submenu.
If you try to set Path type on a circle, and the text is set to Align Center, the text will 
be forced to the bottom of the circle. That’s because 
each Path type object has two handles (the start 
marker and the end marker) between which the type is 
centered. When you ﬁrst draw the circle and apply the 
Path type to it, those two handles appear together at 
the top of the circle, due to the fact that the circle is a 
closed path.
75

To manually ﬂip type on a path to the other side of the path, select the type and drag 
the center handle (the thin blue line perpendicular to the 
type) across the path, as indicated by the red arrow 
above. Note the tiny T-shaped icon that appears next to 
the cursor as you position it near the handle; you can 
also ﬂip type by choosing Type> Type on a Path> Type 
on a Path Options, enabling the Flip box, and clicking 
OK.
The quick-changing Type tool
When using the regular Type tool, look at your cursor very carefully in these situations:
• If you move the regular Type tool over a closed path, the cursor changes to the Area Type
icon.
• If you move the Type tool over an open path, the cursor will change to the Type on a Path
icon.
Scale text frames only
By default, Illustrator’s Scale tool scales both the text frame and its contents. To scale the text 
frame alone, Direct-Select it first. Then use the Scale tool, or scale it manually using the 
bounding box.
—Jean-Claude Tremblay
To position the text on top of the circle, grab the start marker handle and drag it to 
the 9 o’clock position, and then drag the end marker 
handle to the 3 o’clock position. Your text will now be 
centered between the two handles, on top of the circle.
76

Path type and closed paths
Even though the feedback you get from the Type tool cursor seems to indicate that you can 
only apply Path type to open paths, you actually can apply Path type to both open and closed 
paths (hold Option/Alt and watch for the cursor to change from the Area Type icon to the Type 
on a Path icon).
WORKING WITH THREADED TEXT
If an Area type or Path type object contains more text than it has room to 
display, you’ll see a red plus sign indicating a loaded out port (see the Tip 
“Ports defined” Ports defined).
To enlarge an Area type object or a Path type object on an enclosed path, 
allowing for more text, use the Selection tool to grab the object by a bounding 
side, and drag to resize it. To lengthen a path for Path type, use the Direct 
Selection tool to select the last anchor and drag the path longer, or use the 
Pen tool to start drawing more of the path from the last anchor, then drag the 
end bracket to the new end of the path. Following are more techniques for 
dealing with threaded text:
• To add a new text object to receive overﬂow text, use the Selection tool to select
the first text object. Next, click on the out port; your cursor changes to the 
“loaded text” cursor. Click on the artboard to create a new text object the 
same size and shape as the original (this works nicely for custom shapes), 
or drag to create a rectangular text object of any size. The new text object is 
threaded (linked) to the original, flowing text into the second.
77

• To link existing text objects together, click the out port on the first object, and
then click on the path of the object that will receive the overflow text. (Keep 
your eye on the cursor, which will change to indicate valid “drop” locations.) 
You can also link objects using a menu command: Select both objects and 
choose Type> Threaded Text> Create, and the objects become linked.
• To disconnect one object from another, select the object and double-click its in
port to break the thread to a preceding object, or double-click its out port to 
break the thread to a subsequent object. Alternatively, you can select the 
object and click once on either the in port or the out port. Then click on the 
other end of the thread to break the link.
• To release an object from a text thread, select it, then choose Type> Threaded
Text> Release Selection. Or, to remove the threading from an object while 
leaving the text in place, select it and choose Type> Threaded Text> Remove 
Threading.
Ports defined
Your text in port and out port indicators will change to reflect different situations:
• A red plus sign in the out port means the object contains overﬂow text.
• An arrow in the in port means the object is threaded to a preceding text object, and text is
flowing into the object.
• An arrow in the out port means the object is threaded to a subsequent text object, and text is
flowing out of the object.
Making one text block of many
To join separate Area text boxes or Point type objects, select all the text objects with any 
Selection tool and copy. Then draw a new Area text box and paste. Text will flow into the box, 
in the stacking order in which it had appeared on the page. (It doesn’t matter if you select 
graphic elements with your text—these elements won’t be pasted.)
—Sandee Cohen
WRAPPING AREA TYPE AROUND OBJECTS
Text wrapping is controlled as an object attribute and is set specifically for 
each object that will have Area type wrapped around it. These wrap objects 
affect only Area type objects that are both within the same layer, and directly 
beneath it in the Layers panel, and do not affect Point type or Path type. To 
make a selected object into a wrap object choose Object> Text Wrap> Make. 
To change options for the wrap object, keep it selected and choose Object> 
Text Wrap> Text Wrap Options. Here, you’ll choose the amount of offset; you 
also have the option to choose Invert Wrap, which reverses the side of the 
object that text wraps around.
78

the text and choosing Object> Text Wrap> Make
FORMATTING TEXT
While the Character and Paragraph panels (and the Touch Type tool in CC) 
let you format text one attribute at a time, the Character Styles and 
Paragraph Styles panels allow you to apply multiple attributes with one click.
An open document always has a paragraph style applied to it even before 
there’s any text, so if you select the Type tool, then modify its attributes in the 
Control panel, Illustrator thinks you’re intending to modify the default, 
[Normal Paragraph Style]. A plus sign next to the style name in the 
Paragraph Styles panel indicates you’ve applied extra formatting, or overrides. 
To avoid unneeded overrides, work with styles wherever possible, and see the 
Tip “Avoiding formatting overrides” on the next page.
• To create a style based on existing formatting, format the text as you want it to
appear, select it, and click on the New Style button (Option-click/Alt-click to 
name the style). The selected attributes define the new style.
• To create a new style based on another, highlight the style you want to copy and
click the Create New Style icon. To name the style as you create it (and 
modify the style if you wish), hold Option/Alt when you click.
79

• To rename a style, double-click on the name in the panel for inline editing.
• To apply a paragraph style to text, just insert your cursor into the paragraph
you want to format and click the name of the style in the Paragraph Styles 
panel. After first applying a style, to remove all overrides click again on the 
plus beside the Paragraph style name.
• To apply a character style, select letters you want to style and click a style
name in the Character Styles panel. In CC you can also use the Touch Type 
tool.
Avoiding formatting overrides
When your project calls for several text objects using the same font, consider using a custom 
paragraph style. Created properly, this prevents Illustrator from applying the default, [Normal 
Paragraph Style], to all your new text and then adding formatting overrides to apply your 
specific font attributes. (Using the Control panel, you will merely be creating formatting 
overrides that must then be cleared in order to apply a different font with different attributes.)
• If you’ll use the same font attributes in several documents, you can create a New Document
Profile that will always include your preferred font attributes as part of the [Normal Paragraph 
Style]. (See more about profiles in Your Creative Workspace.)
• If you only need to change the font for a single document, double-click on [Normal
Paragraph Style] and modify the default for just this document, or create a new paragraph 
style.
—Cristen Gillespie
CONVERTING TYPE TO OUTLINES
You can now keep type live and perform many effects that once required you 
to outline type. Using the Appearance panel you can apply multiple strokes to 
characters, run type along a curve, use envelopes to distort type, and even 
mask with live, editable type. Following are some cases where you still might 
need to outline your type:
• Convert to outlines to graphically transform or distort type. If Warp Effects and
Envelopes don’t create the effect you need (see examples in this chapter and 
in the Reshaping Dimensions chapter for examples of warps and envelopes), 
then outlining your type will allow you to edit the individual curves and 
anchor points of letters or words. Your type will no longer be editable as type, 
but instead will be constructed of standard Illustrator Bézier curves that are 
editable just like any other object. Type converted to outlines may include 
compound paths to form the “holes” in the outlined letter forms (such as the 
see-through centers of an O, B, or P. Choose Object> Compound Path> 
Release to fill the “holes” with color.
• Convert to outlines to maintain your letter and word spacing when exporting type
to another application, as many programs don’t support the translation of 
custom kerning and word spacing.
• Convert to outlines if you can’t distribute the font to your client or service bureau,
when you don’t have permission to embed the fonts, or your service bureau 
doesn’t have its own license for a font.
Outlines and small font sizes
Fonts at small sizes or with fine details won’t look as good on the computer screen, or print as 
clearly at resolutions of 600 dots per inch or less as outlines, as they would if you kept them 
as fonts.
80

The Every-line Composer
Illustrator offers two composition methods for determining where line breaks occur in lines of 
text. The Single-line Composer applies hyphenation and justification settings to one line of text 
at a time, but this can make multiple lines look ragged. The Every-line Composer determines 
the best combination of line breaks across an entire paragraph of text.
USING THE EYEDROPPER WITH TYPE
The Eyedropper tool lets you copy styling and appearance attributes from 
one type object to another. Double-click the tool to specify in Eyedropper 
Options which attributes will be picked up or applied with the Eyedropper 
tool. In addition to specifying whether you’ll be picking up character styles 
and/or paragraph styles, the Eyedropper tool can also copy type object 
Appearance attributes (see the next section, “Using the Appearance Panel 
with Type” for more about Character versus Type level attributes).
For a one-step method, select the type object with appearance attributes you 
want to change, and then move the Eyedropper tool over the unselected type 
object that has the attributes you want and click on it.
Alternatively, the Eyedropper tool works in another mode: sampling and 
applying. A small T means it is in position to sample or apply text attributes. 
To copy text formatting from one object to another using the Eyedropper 
tool, position it over an unselected type object. When it angles downward to 
the left, click the type object to pick up its attributes.
Now position the Eyedropper tool over the unselected text object to which 
you want to apply the attributes, and hold down the Option/Alt key. In 
applying mode, it angles downward to the right, and looks full. To apply the 
attributes that you just sampled, move the cursor to the text you want to 
change and click. (A simple click will apply the sampled attributes to the 
whole paragraph; you can also drag the cursor to apply the attributes only to 
the specific text you dragged over.)
USING THE APPEARANCE PANEL WITH TYPE
When you work with type, you work with the letter characters or with the 
container that holds the characters—or both. Understanding the difference 
between characters and their container (the “type object”) will help you 
access and edit the right one when you style type. To help understand the 
difference, you’ll need to watch the Appearance panel as you work. (See the 
previous chapter for more details about working with the Appearance panel.)
The appearance of stroked text
To stroke type without distorting the characters, select the type using a Selection tool (not a 
Type tool), select Add New Stroke in the Appearance panel, then move this new stroke below 
the Characters.
81

Type characters
By default, Type characters entered with the Type tool are styled with a Black 
Fill and No Stroke. To edit a character’s fill and stroke, drag across the text 
with the Type tool or double-click “Characters” in the Appearance panel.
The Appearance panel showing the green ﬁll applied to the type at the Character 
level
You can’t do the following to type characters (although in the section “Type 
objects” following you will be able to do these things to a type object): move 
the stroke under the fill or fill above the stroke; apply a live effect to the fill or 
stroke; apply a gradient fill; add multiple fills or strokes.

tool and then move the object around on your page.
With the text object you can add another fill (click on the Add New Fill icon 
in the Appearance panel). Now there is another listing of Stroke and Fill, in 
the Appearance panel, but this time they are positioned above the Characters 
line in the panel. If you reveal the Stroke and Fill for the type by double-
clicking the Characters line in the panel, you return to character editing; 
reselect the type object with the Selection tool to return to editing the type 
object rather than its characters.
When you add a new Stroke or Fill to the type object, its color and effects 
interact with the color of the characters. All the strokes and fills applied to 
type are layered on top of those listed below (including on top of the stroke 
and fill you see listed when you double-click Characters in the panel). So if 
you add a new fill to the type object and apply white to it, the type appears 
white (the white fill of the type object is stacked above the black default fill of 
the characters).

THE GLYPHS PANEL
Illustrator’s Glyphs panel (Window> Type> Glyphs) provides quick access to 
a wide variety of special characters (like  or 
), including any ligatures, 
ornaments, swashes, and fractions included with a given font. Use the list box 
to narrow your search of a font for the type of letterform you’re seeking. With 
the Type tool, click to place the insertion point, then double-click the 
character you want in the Glyphs panel to insert it in the text.
83

You can use the Show pop-up menu to restrict the visible character set in the Glyphs 
panel
WORKING WITH LEGACY TEXT
Adobe periodically updates Illustrator’s type engine, partly in order to 
maintain compatibility between applications. If you open a file created in an 
older version and see a warning about using legacy type, you’ll need to 
update the type to the new engine if you want to edit the type. However, this 
action could cause the type to reflow, so you might want to keep a copy of the 
original handy as a reference if you need to edit the type. If the file is very old, 
updating legacy type might be a multi-step process. Adobe first updates type 
to be compatible with the changes that were made in CS, and then updates 
for any changes thereafter—for example, updating Type on a Path created 
prior to CS4 to the current behavior of Type on a Path. By following the 
prompts, you’ll get your old file updated to the latest type engine, permitting 
you now to edit it.

ADVANCED FEATURES OF MULTIPLE ARTBOARDS
You can find basic information on artboards in the chapter Your Creative
Workspace. Following in this section are some of the more advanced features 
of artboards, which will help you work productively and maintain consistency 
within a project. (Scaling artboards is enhanced in CC.)
Duplicating elements to artboards
Among the more common functions you’ll need when you’re working in a 
multiple artboard document is the duplication of elements on multiple pages. 
Although there isn’t currently a built-in “master page” function, there are a 
number of ways to accomplish this task:
• To duplicate elements when adding another art-board, select the Artboard tool,
enable “Move/Copy Artwork with Artboard,” and hold down the Option/Alt 
key while dragging an active artboard to a new location.
• Turn artwork created on one artboard into a symbol, then drag that symbol from
the shared Symbols panel to any other artboard. Now just update the symbol 
to update all instances of it used on any artboards.
• To move or copy the artwork a speciﬁed distance, measure the distance between
the artwork and where you want it on another artboard. Then use 
Transform> Move and enter the measurement in the Distance input.
• To copy “instances” of artwork to another artboard, use the Transform effect.
• To copy objects to all other artboards in the same relative location, use Paste
on All Artboards.
Managing artboards
Many features are available to help you work with artboards according to 
more specialized needs. If you select the Artboard tool to accomplish these 
tasks, use the Esc key to return to the tool you were using.
• To renumber artboards using the Artboard panel, either drag artboard names to
rearrange them, or highlight one artboard and click the up or down arrow 
icons. Renumbering artboards can be very helpful if you’re using them for 
presentations and storyboarding. 
• Rearrange artboard positions using 
either the Artboard panel menu, or
Object> Artboards> Rearrange. A 
dialog lets you determine the order 
they repeat, whether across the 
monitor or down (their layout), how 
far apart they are placed, how many 
columns they’re in, and whether or 
not the artwork is moved with them.
• Convert any rectangle to an artboard 
using Object> Artboard> Convert 
to
Artboard. Or use Object> Path> 
Split Into Grid to create several 
rectangles from one before 
converting them all to artboards.
85

After drawing a rectangle, choosing Split into Grid (original purple stroke is pre-
served), and Convert to Artboard
• To save artboards as separate ﬁles, choose Save As, then in the Illustrator
Options section select “Save each artboard to a separate file,” and choose All 
or enter a range of artboards.
Working with artboards
Rename artboards by double-clicking on their name in the panel. In CC resize an artboard 
from its center by holding Option/Alt as you drag with the Artboard tool.
Exporting and printing multiple artboards
All artboards in a file share the same print options, including color mode, 
bleed settings, and scale, and you can choose to print either to a PDF file or to 
a printer. In the Print dialog, print artboards as separate pages (the default), 
or ignore artboards and tile the artwork.
• Print to PDF always flattens the file. But you can choose the media, such as
screen or slide, ignoring the actual artboard size—this is useful for 
presentations. Or you can scale the artwork to fit your media, among many 
other features found in the Print to PDF dialog.
• Save As PDF preserves transparency, editing capabilities, and top-level
layers, and you can set a level of security.
• Print only some artboards using the Range setting. Scale them to fit your print
media if desired.
• Print artboards with landscape orientation, or a mix of landscape and portrait, with
Auto-Rotate when portrait is selected for the media. If your media is
landscape-oriented, Auto-Rotate is disabled.
86

• Print artwork that is larger than your media by using artboards instead of the
Print Tiling tool. The Split Into Grid command (followed by Convert to 
Artboard) can divide the artwork into media-sized rectangles for you.
• The boundaries of each artboard are cropped if your artwork overlaps artboards
and you print each artboard as a page.
• When printing pages in which two or more artboards are overlapping the same
artwork, each artboard will print with whichever portions of the artwork are 
visible within that artboard.

scape artboards to media oriented to portrait

RELATED TIPS
Control tabs and leaders
Use the Tabs panel to control tabs and leaders. As you pan or zoom, you’ll notice the Tab 
ruler doesn’t move with the text box. If you lose your alignment, just click the little Magnet 
button on the Tabs panel, and the panel will snap back into alignment.

Artist Donal Jolley had to convert type to outlines in order to reshape the U and N
type characters
Missing fonts?
If you open a file without the correct fonts loaded, Illustrator warns you. You can still open, 
edit, and save the file. Illustrator remembers the fonts you were using. However, the text will 
not flow accurately, and the file won’t print correctly until you load or replace the missing fonts. 
Choose Type> Find Font (expanded in CC) to then locate and replace each occurrence by 
clicking Change and then Find, or change every occur-rence at once, with Change All.
Accessing Type Options
To access the Type Options dialog for Area Type or Type on a Path, place your cursor within 
the live type, then double-click the Type tool in the Tools panel.
88

No faux Small Caps
Illustrator’s Small Caps option (in the Character panel menu) converts all selected characters 
to small caps (top). However, if true-drawn small caps aren’t available in a font, Illustrator 
creates the fake, scaled-down version (middle), which is a typographic taboo. To prevent 
Illustrator from creating fake small caps, go to File> Document Setup> Type> Options, and 
change the Small Caps percentage from 70% to 100%. This option is only used when 
Illustrator is faking small caps, so when your small caps are the size of capital letters, you’ll 
instantly recognize it (bottom). This option doesn’t persist between documents, so you’ll have 
to choose it each time. (Go to http://www.creativepro.com/content/typetalk-small-caps-illustrator to 
read the full article.)

 NEW TYPE FEATURES IN ILLUSTRATOR CC
Convert Point type to Area and vice versa
Illustrator CC added a new annotator to the type object’s bounding box. After 
creating a Point or Area type object, select the object with the Selection tool 
to see a circle on the right side of the object’s bounding box. Double-click on 
the circle to convert Point type (hollow circle) to Area type (solid circle) or 
vice versa. You can also toggle text between Area and Point type using the 
Type> Convert menu item (with no type selected, the menu item says Type 
Conversion). The flow of the type doesn’t change; soft returns are added to 
Area type paragraphs to maintain the appearance and overset text is deleted. 
Once you convert type, you can edit it for a different fit by removing soft 
returns in Point type or by adjusting Area type’s bounding box to reflow text.
Point type (top) indicated by a hollow widget, converts to Area type (bottom), indi-cated by a solid widget
89

Touch Type transformations
Illustrator combined the onscreen interactivity of the Transform bounding 
box with the ability to use the Character panel to individually rotate, scale, 
and position characters, and came up with the Touch Type tool (find it in the 
Tools panel with the Type tools [Shift-T], or click the button in the Character 
panel). The tool is designed to work with any input device (including your 
fingers on touch-enabled devices), but there are some limitations to what you 
can do with it. Unlike using the Character panel to rotate and scale 
characters, the Touch Type tool directly affects only one character at a time. 
Unlike placing characters on their own layer with cut and paste, then flipping 
or skewing the entire object, you can’t flip or skew characters with the Touch 
Type tool. However, instead of having to numerically rotate a character a 
negative 27°, scale it by 133%, and reposition its baseline by 35 points, simply 
click to select the character with the Touch Type tool, then start interactively 
transforming the character. In order to quickly return to a “neutral” position, 
create a character style for the base settings before you start playing with the 
Touch Type tool. To reset the entire text block and remove all character 
formatting, choose Reset Panel from the Character panel’s pop-up menu.

sec-tion, later in this chapter)

Limits to the Touch Type tool
The Touch Type tool works on only one character at a time, but several 
characters may be affected by a single transformation. You can’t reposition a 
character past the first character to its left. You can’t skew or flip a character. 
Characters added within a word will take on any transformation of the 
character preceding them, unless you first select a following character, 
effectively replacing it with a new glyph, then type it in again.

Before CC, the search field in the Control and Character panels allowed us to 
type the first few letters of a font name, and Illustrator would immediately 
jump to the first exact match in our font list. If we opened the list box, we 
could then continue to scroll through the list of fonts to find other results 
manually. Now we have added choices to make it easier to search. You’ll have 
the option to restrict your results to matching only the first word in the name 
or to include any font with a matching string anywhere in its name. The list 
then automatically opens to the first word match (if there is one), plus all the 
rest that have a matching string, and only matching results are in the list.
You can restrict the number of search results you get for any given string by 
typing additional strings; type “scri” and all fonts with “script” in the name 
will get displayed, with those fonts that begin with Script listed at the top. 
Type a space to add a new string, then “bl”, and now only fonts that contain 
both those strings, such as Snell Roundhand Black Script, are displayed. 
Another way to get that particular font listed in the search results would be to 
type “ro ha” (for “Roundhand”). Really, you can search on almost anything 
you remember about a font’s name, then narrow the search by adding a new 
string for any other part of its name. When you have a string in the font 
search field, clicking on the alphanumeric character X at the right clears the 
field for a new search. If you just want to browse in the Control panel without 
searching, the list also indicates if any additional styles of a font are available 
by displaying a down-pointing triangle. Twirl it open to see all the styles 
contained in that font family.

Without applying the Typekit ﬁlter, all fonts are displayed that match the search cri-
teria in the search ﬁeld

Highlighting substituted fonts (Preferences> Type) is now global, rather than 
document-specific. It’s enabled by default. Substituted fonts in your 
document will be highlighted in pink.

Typekit fonts and Illustrator
Whether you have a subscription to the Creative Cloud or a single 
subscription to Illustrator CC, you are entitled to sign up for a Typekit 
subscription. Depending upon your subscription, the number of fonts you 
can have synced at the same time may be limited. Access information about a 
Typekit subscription account from the Fonts tab of your Creative Cloud app, 
which will also take you to your account page if you have one. Illustrator files 
saved with Typekit fonts can be shared with anyone else with CC and Typekit 
memberships. In addition, when you save an .ai file with Typekit fonts using 
the default Create PDF Compatible File option, you can have confidence that 
any missing Typekit fonts can be viewed and printed when placed in 
InDesign, Acrobat, Adobe Reader, and other applications that can extract the 
PDF from the .ai file, including by using Place in Illustrator ( -Shift-P/Ctrl-
Shift-P). However, in order to properly view your Typekit fonts live in 
Illustrator, and see which are capable of being edited, the viewer of that file 
must be either logged into both Illustrator CC and Typekit, or must own that 
font. To get started, all you have to do is sign in to Typekit with your Adobe 
ID and password. You can also purchase most of the desktop fonts by going 
directly to the foundry that owns them. Typekit itself doesn’t sell the fonts. 
The Fonts tab in the Creative Cloud app is devoted to Typekit, and is your 
direct link to the Typekit website. Desktop Typekit fonts are cached on your 
computer, letting you use them in any application, not just Adobe apps, but 
unlike fonts you have purchased, they aren’t installed and can’t be packaged 
with your other document files. Currently fonts are managed by the Creative 
Cloud application; if the Creative Cloud app isn’t running, all Typekit fonts 
are treated as missing fonts. In addition, in Acrobat you should be able to 
insert spaces and returns, and even delete characters, but you will need to 
own the font or have access to Typekit in order to make more extensive edits 
to the type.
When someone opens an Illustrator file containing Typekit fonts that they 
don’t own or have access to, Illustrator substitutes the Typekit fonts with a 
default font. Therefore, if your file must always display the exact form of the 
Typekit font characters you used, even in cases where Typekit fonts may not 
be available or installed, (for instance, within a logo), then you can convert a 
copy of your live type into vector objects. It’s important that you convert a 
duplicate of your text so you can maintain the live type in case you need to 
replace the typeface or can again access to the Typekit font. To convert 
Typekit text to outlines, you must currently have the font synced to your 
computer and duplicate the text, layers containing text blocks, or an entire 
artboard containing the text. Then with the duplicate text objects selected, 
choose Type> Create Outlines ( -Shift-O/Ctrl-Shift-O).
93

Without being registered with Typekit, or if the Creative Cloud app isn’t running, 
you’ll see no results when ﬁltering for them in the Char-
acter search ﬁeld. So long as the Creative Cloud app is 
running, it’s easy to sign up with Typekit and browse for 
fonts, or sync missing Typekit fonts to an open 
document.
The Proxy swatch and type
The Proxy swatch in your Tools panel now behaves a little differently with 
type. If the Stroke proxy is active and you select a type object with the 
Selection tool, when you switch to the Type tool, the Proxy switches focus 
from Stroke to Fill. If you then click on a swatch in the Swatches panel, you’ll 
set the Fill color, not the Stroke. The proxy will only switch in this exact 
sequence, and you can still deliberately target the type object’s stroke to 
change it.
Missing fonts
Because Typekit has been integrated into Illustrator, both the search field in 
the Character and Control panels and the Find Font feature can now 
distinguish between locally installed fonts and Typekit fonts. If you have a 
subscription and haven’t reached your limit for the number of fonts you get 
access to, the Missing Font dialog will allow you to choose Sync Fonts to get 
the missing fonts from Typekit without further ado. The dialog announces 
when syncing has been successful, and updates the document with the 
newly synced font once you click Close. If you open a file with a Typekit font 
when you don’t have a Typekit subscription, Adobe will display a Missing 
Font dialog and offer you the opportunity to register for a subscription with 
Typekit. 
94

You can also click the Find Fonts button in the Missing Font dialog to switch 
to the full Find Fonts dialog. In this dialog, also accessible at any time from 
the Type menu, you can sync missing Typekit fonts or choose another font 
from the document or your system to replace the missing font. To see a large 
thumbnail for a replacement font that you have installed, you can context-
click on its name in the dialog. As soon as you have either synced your 
missing font or replaced it with another, the font preview is updated in both 
the document and the Find Font dialog. Once you’ve replaced all your 
missing fonts and like the results, click Done to dismiss the dialog.

Illustrator as a Stand-Alone Layout Tool
Overview: Set your document’s dimensions and bleeds; make custom guides; place 
vector and raster art; make Area type for columns.
Print On Demand (POD), a printing technology and business process in 
which new copies of a book are not printed until an order has been received, 
is an increasingly popular print option for independent and self-publishers, 
particularly those who create documents intended for both print and ePub. 
Raymond Larrett of Puzzled Squirrel Press finds that using Illustrator allows 
him to easily create cover designs that integrate vector art with raster art 
elements, like the ones for this graphic novel. After setting up page 
dimensions, bleeds, and guides for text elements, the Illustrator document 
can be exported as a JPEG file for ePub or web comics, and as a PDF for POD 
publications.
1 Setting up the page. Larrett created a new document (File> New). While in 
the New Document dialog, he changed the Name of the file, set the Number 
of Art-boards to 1, chose Picas under Units, clicked the Landscape icon under 
Orientation, and entered the dimensions of his book cover (including front, 
back, and spine elements) in the Width and Height fields. He also entered his 
bleed measurement in the Top Bleed input field and clicked the “Make all set-
tings the same” icon to populate the other Bleed fields with the same mea-
surement. After entering all his settings, he clicked OK.

setting Orientation to landscape, entering dimensions, 
and entering bleed measurements
98

To create the initial guide, he first checked to make sure that guides were un-
locked (View> Guides), and then click-dragged from the left-side ruler to 
roughly his first position. With the guide still selected, he numerically adjust-
ed the positions of the selected guide by relocating the X (or Y) axis positions 
in the Transform panel. (You can also turn selected vector objects into guides 
using Guides> Make Guides or -5/Ctrl-5.) With his guides in place, Larrett 
used the context-sensitive menu to access Lock, Hide, and Release guide 
functions as needed. (See this chapter’s CC intro for added ways to make 
guides in CC).
2
Dragging a guide out from a ruler into position; Illustrator CC adds ways to make 
guides, including double clicking on a ruler; see “Better 
guide creation” in this chapter’s CC intro for details
Selecting guide and numerically positioning from the Transform panel
3 Placing and reﬁning the elements. When the page was set with the correct di-
mensions, bleeds, and guides, Larrett added artwork to the design. He 
dragged and dropped some existing vector elements, like the barcode and 
logo, from other Illustrator files. Larrett’s design also contains raster 
artwork, which he imported into the document by choosing File> Place. Lar-
rett then created rectangles with the Rectangle tool to define areas for 
columns of text. 
2 Customizing your guides. To make it possible to set up guides for the back 
cover, spine, and front cover, Larrett chose View> Show Rulers ( -R/Ctrl-R). 
With the Area Type tool, he clicked on each of these rectangles, making it 
possible to type or paste text directly into the box. He then double-clicked 
on the Type tool from the Tools panel to open the Area Type Options dialog. 
Within the dialog, Larrett changed the Offset in the Inset Spacing field to 
inset the text from the edge of the text box. You can also use the Area Type 
Options dialog to change the Dimensions, Rows, Columns, and Text Flow 
Options. As an alternative to using the Area Type tool, you can use the Type 
tool to create type for titles, headlines, and other individual type ele-ments.

PUTNAM
Create an Identity
Working Efﬁciently with Multiple Elements
Overview: Create artboards for each type of content; use the Artboards panel to re-
size the artboards and duplicate some of them; use symbols for logos; optionally, du-
plicate artboards with artwork for multiple variations.
A company’s typical identity package may contain several types and sizes of 
materials, such as letterhead, business cards, web pages, and ad inserts. 
Instead of needing to keep track of multiple files, Ryan Putnam can rely on 
multiple artboards and symbols to create the collateral materials in a single 
file, making additions or updates much simpler and less prone to errors and 
omissions.
1 Setting up the artboards. Putnam began by setting up four artboards using the 
default settings in the New dialog plus a standard bleed. Opening the Art-
boards panel, he double-clicked the first artboard icon, entered the dimen-
sions of the business card, named it “Front_card,” and clicked OK. He then 
customized the sizes and names of the other three artboards: the letterhead, 
an insert, and the logo design. Since he needed the same size artboard for the 
front and back of the business card, he used the Artboards panel to duplicate 
the business card by dragging “Front_card” to the New Artboard icon. In the 
Artboards panel he double-clicked the copy’s name and typed “Back_card,” 
and reordered the artboards (which renumbered them) by dragging “Back_-
card” to just below “Front_card.” Because duplicate artboards automatically 
101

get added in a single row to the right of the last artboard drawn, Putnam se-
lected the Artboard tool (Shift-O), to drag the artboards into a custom 
arrangement. Using Smart Guides ( -U/Ctrl-U) he could easily line them up 
in a well-organized fashion.

2 Making symbols for replication and quick updates. Putnam began by designing 
the logo. He then dragged it into the Symbols panel to save it as a symbol, 
named it, and clicked OK. If he modified the logo, he only had to alter the one 
symbol to automatically update all instances of it throughout the document. 
If he needed a variation of the logo, he could break the link to the original 
symbol to create a new symbol (see the Expressive Strokes chapter for more 
about creating and modifying symbols). Using multiple artboards with sym-
bols adds appreciably to productivity. Artboards in one file share the same li-
braries, so if there were any changes in the future, Putnam wouldn’t have to 
open separate files for each item in the identity package, and then open the 
library containing the modified symbol. One file would always contain all the 
libraries and correctly-sized artboards ready for modifications.
2
Using symbols for logos to maintain consistency, to make updates a snap, and to 
modify or place symbols from a shared library onto 
different art-boards as needed
103

3 Copying and duplicating artwork with artboards. 
Putnam created the design for each element of 
the identity package, placing the logo symbol 
on the artboard and adding text and artwork as 
needed. He linked the photo to the insert, 
making it easy to replace for the next event. 
Although the letterhead and in-sert only 
required a single version, he needed to create a 
business card that could be duplicated and 
personalized later for each employee and 
different events. When he needed to create 
another business card for a different em-ployee 
and/or event, he could either duplicate the 
front and back cards in the Artboards panel as 
before, or, with the Artboard tool selected and 
Move/Copy Artwork enabled in the Control 
panel, he could hold down the Option/Alt key 
while dragging a selected artboard. With 
everything in place, Putnam only had to select 
the text, graphic, or linked image that needed 
changing and quickly replace it. Because he 
could add up to 100 artboards in a single file, 
Putnam was now able to stay organized with 
just one file.

with Artboard icon and holding down the Option/Alt key
Sharing artboards and libraries
Any project that shares artwork for different elements—whether they share the same color 
theme, graphic and type styles, symbols, brushes, etc.—might benefit from using multiple 
artboards. That way you only need to maintain the libraries belonging to any single document, 
sharing them among all of the project pieces.

Really Organized
Streamlining File Output with Artboards
Overview: Create an artboard template that automates the output process; label and 
name each artboard; export each artboard as a ﬁle for the application coders to use. 
Illustrator’s multiple artboards and flexible output options made it easy for 
Dacosta! of Chocolate Soop® to produce all the elements coders need to 
create custom, sticker-style wallpapers. Stikalicious™ is a character-based 
wallpaper application for the iPad that Dacosta! created to showcase the 
work of artists from around the world. The user selects a background and 
desired characters, then layers, rotates, and scales them for a unique, 
shareable wallpaper. Each character requires four versions—the smallest and 
largest version of both the active and placed states.
1 Using a template for artboards. Dacosta! began by creating artboards at the 
size needed for the Collection icons, backgrounds, and the four states for 
each character (~100 artboards per file). In order to clearly see the versions 
with a white border, Dacosta! changed the artboard color. To do this, click on 
the Document Setup button on the Control panel and enable Simulate Col-
ored Paper; then double-click on the top swatch beside the Transparency pre-
view and select a light gray in the color picker. To associate each artboard 
with its role in the application, he both named it in the Artboard panel and 
labeled each artboard on the canvas. Dacosta! saved the file in .ait (Illustrator 
template) format, and when he received artwork, opened the template to 
place each state for every character on its correct artboard, creating a com-
plete Stikalicious™ character set. For each artboard in the Artboard panel, he 
used a predetermined naming convention, which the coders would use to 
identify the role each element played in the application. Dacosta! saved the .ai 
file for backup, then exported it to PNG format, enabling Use Art-boards in 
the Export dialog. Use Artboards saves each artboard to a separate file with 
the artboard name as its filename. Now the coders could finish the work on 
the separate elements.

Moving Your Type
Setting Type on a Curve and Warping Type
Overview: Create banners that will go behind curved labels; type label text on a 
curved path and adjust its alignment on the path; warp text and adjust its tracking; 
modify the kerning of the space between words.
Greater Bridgeport Transit hired Jack Tom to design a T-shirt supporting its 
new campaign to raise public awareness of the local bus system. Tom’s design 
combined the campaign’s taglines—“Go Green,” “Go GBT.com,” and “Go 
Public”—with artwork illustrating birds, butterflies, and flowery vines.
1 Creating the background art and the two banners. After drawing the floral, bird, 
and butterfly figures, Tom created the banners that would serve as back-
grounds for the curved “Go Green” and “Go Public” labels. You can make a 
symmetrical banner by first selecting the Ellipse tool and drawing an ellipse. 
Then cut the ellipse with the Scissors tool to make the curved path that will 
form the banner. Using the grid (View> Show Grid) and positioning the 
ellipse over a horizontal grid line will help you cut the ellipse at the same 
verti-cal position on its left and right sides, keeping the curve symmetrical. 
109

Next, make a copy of this path; you’ll use it later for curving the text of the 
label. Now give the joined path a thick stroke (Tom used 35 pt) and then 
outline the path by selecting Object> Path> Outline Stroke. You can now give 
the stroke a width and color the stroke and fill.

tool

2 Curving a label. To make the curved labels for “Go Green” and “Go Public,” 
Tom used the path he had copied in the previous step. If you use Paste in 
Front ( -F/CtrlF), the path will overlay the banner you created previously. 
After pasting the path, select the Text tool, click on the path, and type your 
label text. With the path still selected, click the Align center icon in the Para-
graph section of the Control panel. That centers your text horizontally across 
the banner. Before adjusting the vertical position of the type, realign the posi-
tion of the type to the path by choosing Type> Type on a Path> Type on a 
Path Options. From the Type on a Path Options dialog, change Align to Path 
from the default Baseline to Center. Also, set the baseline shift to 0 in the 
Character panel. This will minimize any pinching or expanding of space be-
tween the letters of the label. Now you can move the path up or down to bet-
ter center the label against the banner.

3 Arcing and bending a label. Tom wanted the main label, “Go GBT.com,” to 
bend backwards in a gentle arc. To bend type, start by typing your text (you 
can use an Area- or a Point-type object). With the text object selected, choose 
Effect> Warp> Arc Lower. In the Warp Options dialog, make sure Horizontal 
is still active and change Bend by moving the slider or entering a number in 
the Bend field. A negative number will bend the type backwards (Tom en-
tered –17% for Bend).
111

warping (below)
When you warp type, the spacing between letters and words may change 
more than you’d like. Consider resetting or adjusting Tracking or Kerning 
from the Character panel. Tracking controls the distance between all letters 
in the selected text, while kerning requires you to adjust the distance between 
each pair of letters. Also, to tighten the space between words, click on the 
space between words and narrow the kerned space between words by holding 
Option/Alt and pressing the left arrow key.

GORDON/CARTAGRAM, LLC
Steven Gordon/Cartagram, LLC
To label curving features like rivers and roads on his maps, cartographer 
Steve Gordon relies on type on a path. Gordon copies and pastes the river 
or road paths on a separate layer before applying type to them. He sets the 
113

Baseline Shift to 1 pt in the Character panel in order to move the type away 
from the underlying road or river path. In this map of Madison, Alabama, 
Gordon encountered paths with sharp turns and tight curves that pinched 
letters together or spread them apart with unsightly gaps. He smoothed the 
kinks from some paths by clicking to select a path with type, selecting the 
Pencil tool, and then dragging it over or near the path.
For paths that couldn’t be smoothed solely with the Pencil, Gordon reset the 
path’s Baseline Shift to 0 and then dragged the path away from the street 
path so that its lettering was the same distance away from the street as the 
labels with the 1-pt Baseline Shift. Some of the type paths required another 
adjustment: Gordon chose Type> Type on a Path> Type on a Path Options, 
and in the dialog box changed Align to Path from the default value of 
Baseline to Center. Gordon employed these techniques, separately or in 
various combinations, as he worked with hundreds of type objects in the 
map.

When cartographer Steven Gordon creates a map with a terrain image in the 
background, he has to ensure that type is not lost in the mountains of the 
image. For this map of North Carolina’s Jackson County, Gordon received 
directions to create a bold, colorful terrain image by his client, The Sylva 
Herald. He began the map by creating the terrain image in Photo-shop, 
placing it in the Illustrator ﬁle, and positioning it on the artboard. After 
creating the type labels, Gordon opened the Appearance panel, chose Add 
New Stroke from the panel menu, and dragged the Stroke attribute below 
Characters in the panel. Next, he set the width of the stroke to 0.5 pt using 
the Stroke Weight menu and then clicked the Stroke attribute’s color icon to 
pop up the Swatches menu and selected the white swatch. Gordon wanted 
to soften the contrast between the white stroke and image behind it and 
decided to add a white glow around the type. To do this he clicked 
Characters in the Appearance panel and then clicked the Add New Effect 
icon and chose Stylize> Outer Glow. In the Outer Glow dialog, he clicked 
the color picker, selected white, and changed Opacity to 100% and Blur to 
0.04 inches to complete the effect.

Arcing Type
Transforming Type with Warps & Envelopes
Overview: Create and color a title using appearances; explore the three Envelope dis-
tortions for creating an arc effect; use an Arc Warp effect to arc the type; create a 
graphic style and apply arc effect to other title elements.
Adding an arc effect to a headline turns boring type into a dynamic engaging 
headline that grabs the viewers’ attention. With Illustrator you can explore a 
number of ways to create arcing text; using effects and graphic styles, you can 
quickly create an arcing effect easily applicable to any other titles or subtitles! 
(See the Reshaping Dimensions chapter for more about warps, blends, and 
graphic styles.)
1 Creating your headline text. To create headline text, choose a font with dis-
tinct, bold characteristics. For his headline text, Ryan Putnam chose 50-point 
Cabaret font.
Amongst the many ways to create an arcing effect in Illustrator, there are 
three different Envelope distortions that you can apply to your text: Warp, 
Mesh, and Make with Top Object.
First, Putnam applied Object> Envelope Distort> Make with Warp. Next, he 
chose Arc from the Warp options, and changed the Bend to 20%. For a 
second option, he then applied Object> Envelope Distort> Make with Mesh, 
set the number of Rows and Columns to 1, and edited the anchor points with 
the Direct Selection tool. For the final option, he used the Pen tool to draw a 
separate arc-shaped object over the type, selected the type and arc-shaped 
object, and applied Object> Envelope Distort> Make with Top Object.

2 Applying an Arc Warp effect to arc the title. Even though using Envelope dis-
tortions created the effect Putnam was looking for, and provided significant 
control for customizing his warp, he ultimately decided that he wanted a 
quick way to add the same simple arc effect to other titles and subtitles on the 
cover. Putnam figured out that if he created the arc using Effect> Warp, he 
could save his effect as a graphic style that he could then apply to additional 
titles.
There are 15 standard Warp shapes you can choose from when creating a 
title. For the “Spiritual” title, Putnam applied Effect> Warp> Arc. With 
Preview enabled, he changed the Bend to 20%, then clicked OK.

MIYAMOTO
Yukio Miyamoto
The best way to really understand how to construct complex appearances 
for type is to pick apart someone else’s styles. Yukio Miyamoto, master of 
photorealism in Illustrator and author of many Japanese books on creating 
art with the software, has generously shared his varied collection of styles 
for you to you to pick apart and modify. These styles, many of which were 
originally created for his (Japanese) Illustrator Appearance Book, are 
downloadable in both live type and outline format, along with a PDF excerpt 
from his book.

LEVY
Jean-Benoit Levy
San Francisco graphic artist Jean-Benoit Levy combined letters, numbers, 
and red bars to create monetary symbols in this poster about societal 
investment in sustainability for the “Occupy: What’s Next” international 
poster contest sponsored by the NextByDesign organization. Levy started 
the poster by creating the gradient-ﬁlled background. Then he selected the 
Type tool and created type objects for each of the characters that spell 
“SUSTA1NA3LC.” With the Selection tool, he selected each type object and 
positioned it within the layout. Next, to create the blur effect for the letters, 
Levy selected one of the type objects and opened the Appearance panel 
and clicked Fill to select a dark green. Then he clicked the Add New Effect 
icon at the bottom of the panel, choose Blur> Gaussian Blur, and entered 32 
in the radius ﬁeld.
123

To help save time blurring the rest of the characters, he created a graphic 
style that he could reuse. With the type object still selected, he opened the 
Graphic Style panel and clicked the New Graphic Style icon to save the 
appearance as a style. Next, he selected all of the remaining type objects 
and clicked on the graphic style he had created to blur them. To give each 
letter a unique color ﬁll, Levy selected each type object, opened the 
Appearance panel, selected the Fill, and then Shift-clicked the Fill to access 
the Color panel. He adjusted the CMYK values until each character color 
looked the way he wanted. For the red bars, he drew paths with the Pen 
tool, converted them to outlines (Object> Path> Outline Stroke), and used 
the Appearance panel to add a drop shadow (Stylize> Drop Shadow).

BRYAN
Billie Bryan
Carib Select Watersports in Grand Cayman asked Billie Bryan to design a 
logo to attract cruise ship passengers to their popular Stingray City 
excursion. Bryan began by drawing the dark blue shape of Grand Cayman 
island and setting the type. She duplicated the artwork layer and then hid it 
by clicking its visibility icon in the Layers panel. Selecting the type, Bryan 
opened the Appearance panel, double-clicked Characters, ﬁlled the type 
with light blue, clicked the Add New Effect icon, and chose Stylize> Inner 
Glow. She clicked on the swatch next to the Stroke to change the color to a 
medium blue, clicked the Add New Effect icon, chose Distort & Transform> 
Transform, and changed the Move values to offset the stroke. She moved 
the stroke below the ﬁll in the panel. Next, she selected the Add New Fill 
from the panel menu and dragged the new ﬁll below the stroke. She 
changed its color to dark purple-blue and gave it an inner glow like the ﬁrst 
ﬁll. Finally, she selected Add New Stroke from the panel menu, widened its 
stroke, and colored it with dark blue. She also used the Transform effect to 
offset the stroke. To complete the logo, Bryan used the island shape to add 
a water effect to the letters. To do this, she turned on the visibility of the 
duplicate layer she had hidden previously. She converted the type to 
outlines, selected the island, moved it in front of the type outlines, and 
selected the island and the type. Then she opened the Pathﬁnder panel and 
chose Intersect. She ﬁnished the logo by recoloring the resulting shapes in 
a light blue.

PUTNAM
Ryan Putnam
Graphic designer Ryan Putnam turned type and paths into neon tubing 
using Illustrator’s Appearance panel and gradients on strokes in this 
professional portfolio piece. Putnam began by drawing a semi-circle and 
setting the type for “CONES” on it. Then he selected the Type tool and 
double-clicked the type to select its characters. He opened the Appearance 
panel and changed the Fill to None. Next, Putnam clicked on the Selection 
tool to select the type as an object. From the Appearance panel menu, he 
chose Add New Stroke and set the new Stroke to 2 pt. To create the 
gradient for the stroke, he opened the Gradient panel, then changed the 
Type attribute to Radial and the Stroke attribute to “Apply gradient across 
stroke.” Putnam modiﬁed the default gradient, making the left color stop 
white with 10% opacity and the right color stop white with 0% opacity. He 
duplicated the stroke three times and edited each duplicate, changing the 
colors in the gradients. For two of the duplicates, Putnam clicked the word 
Opacity (below the Stroke in the Appearance panel) and changed the 
blending mode to Overlay on one and Multiply on the other. He offset the 
bottom stroke slightly from the others by clicking the Add New Effect icon, 
selecting Distort & Transform> Transform, and entering 5 pt in the Move> 
127

Vertical ﬁeld. When he ﬁnished, Putnam made a graphic style from the type 
so he could apply it to the word “Frosty.” To do this, he selected the type, 
opened the Graphic Styles panel, and clicked the New Graphic Style icon. 
Then he selected the type object for “Frosty” and clicked the new graphic 
style he had created.

 Touching Type
Modifying Editable Letter Characters
Overview: Create a point or area text object; use the Touch Type tool to select indi-
vidual letter characters; resize, rotate, and move characters in a text object; manipu-
late letter spacing; style the word using the Appearance panel.
Finishing a map for a travel guide to Boquete, Panama, cartographer Steve 
Gordon created a title for both the map and the guide. His goal was to create 
a title that featured colorful, playful type and conveyed a rough, spontaneous 
design. Illustrator CC’s Touch Type tool and the Appearance panel enabled 
Gordon to graphically manipulate individual letters in his title design.
1 Setting the type. Gordon began by selecting the Type tool, clicking on the 
artboard, and typing “Boquete” in Illustrator’s default font. Next, he 
individually selected each character with the Type tool and changed its font 
and color from the Control panel. When he finished, each letter in the title 
displayed a unique font and color.
128

2 Distorting letters with the Touch Type tool. To give the letters a playful, disor-
derly look, Gordon chose to distort each character’s size, dimensions, angle, 
and letter spacing. He also wanted to keep the type editable so he could 
change fonts depending on how the design developed. Illustrator CC’s Touch 
Type tool, hidden under the Type tool icon in the Tools panel, lets you graph-
ically manipulate letters while preserving their editability as type. If the Char-
acter panel is open, you can also click the Touch Type tool button to enable 
the tool. As you move the cursor toward the type object you want to edit, no-
tice the Touch Type cursor icon: It appears as a T surrounded by a box with 
corner points.

letter character

 To change a letter, click on it with the Touch Type tool. When you select a 
letter, Illustrator displays a selection box with five control points around 
the character. You’ll use these points to edit each letter.
Gordon began by clicking the letter B with the Touch Type tool. He clicked 
the upper-right control point and dragged it to uniformly enlarge the 
character. To rotate the character, he clicked and dragged the control point 
above the character and dragged it to the left.
Left, uniformly resizing a character using the upper-right control; right, using the 
top-center control point to rotate the character
You can use the other control points to scale or reposition a character. 
Clicking and dragging the upper-left point resizes the character vertically 
while the lower-right point resizes it horizontally.
Left, resizing a character vertically using the upper-left control; right, using the 
lower-right control point to resize a character horizon-
tally
If you click the solid circle control point in the lower-left or inside the 
selection box, you can drag the character in any direction. If you drag to the 
left, the letter moves closer to the letter on its left. But if you drag to the right, 
the letter doesn’t move closer to its neighbor on the right; instead, it 
increases the space from its neighbor on the left. You can also change letter 
spacing by clicking the Type tool and adjusting the kerning or tracking.
130

While type remains editable when you use the Touch Type tool, be careful 
about selecting and replacing multiple letters if you want to reuse the Touch 
Type tool’s graphic modifications. When you select multiple letters and 
retype, Illustrator applies the Touch Type’s graphic modifications of the first 
letter you’re replacing to all the letters you replace as you type. You’ll need to 
adjust each letter separately to re-create the visual look you want.
The point is the area
You can use the Touch Type tool on letter characters in both point and area 
type objects.
3 Styling the title with the Appearance panel. Gordon completed his title by ap-
plying several effects from the Appearance panel to the type object. Selecting 
his title, he bent and distorted its characters uniformly by choosing Warp> 
Twist from the fx pop-up menu. Next, he clicked the Add New Stroke icon in 
the panel menu, then increased the stroke’s thickness and moved the stroke 
underneath the Characters attribute in the panel. Gordon wanted a rough 
look for the stroke, so from the fx menu he applied the Distort & Transform> 
Roughen effect and then completed the title by applying the Stylize> Outer 
Glow effect (also from the fx menu) to the stroke to give the lettering a slight-
ly blurry appearance.

Stairstepping exercise
While you can reposition letters up and down in a word using the Touch Type 
tool, consider doing the same with type on a path using Type> Type on a 
Path> Stairstep. It’s easier!

PAYEN
Franck Payen
Paris-based graphic artist Franck Payen plays bass guitar in the local band 
(the) Kandinsky Complex (http://thekandinskycomplex.band-camp.com). After 
completing an album, Franck created a sound-based Adobe Edge 
animation featuring music, images, and typographic titles that used 
Illustrator CC’s Touch Type tool. Franck started by creating an Area Type 
object and typed the song’s lyrics using the slab serif font Black Oak. Next, 
he created multiple art-boards that he would use later in exporting artwork 
for animation. Then he went through the Area Type object and copied lyrics 
and pasted them as separate Area Text objects on the artboards. Using the 
Direct Selection tool, he adjusted the width of several of the type objects. 
Then, to graphically modify the words, Franck selected the Touch Type tool 
(Shift-T) and adjusted the position, size, and rotation of some of the letters in 
the lyrics. He changed the color of words by selecting and changing their ﬁll 
to different colors and tints. Because the type remained editable, Franck 
could change words when the band’s singer decided to reﬁne the lyrics. 
When Franck ﬁnished, he exported each artboard as an SVG ﬁle and then 
imported the ﬁles into Adobe Edge Animate to create the HTML5 animation.

To storyboard the animation for his Paris band, (the) Kandinsky Complex, 
Franck Payen set up a grid of artboards. When he was ready to further 
develop a frame he’d move the artwork to another document where he’d 
reﬁne the elements and prepare the ﬁle for output. For details on how he 
created the type effects, see his gallery on the previous page (listen to them

MESSER
Chana Messer
Artist, trainer, and Adobe Illustrator User Group host Chana Messer created 
this art poster to illustrate the range of techniques designers can use when 
working with type in Adobe Illustrator. To create the free-form cascading 
“TYPOGRAPHY” Messer began with a standard point type text object. Using 
the Touch Type tool she kept the text live while graphically manipulating 
individual characters, shifting positions. After duplicating and then offsetting 
the manipulated text object, she next used the Touch Type tool to select 
individual letters to change ﬁll colors. She also placed a number of colored, 
textured JPEG images within TYPOGRAPHY to make it appear as though 
each of the different textures was actually within only one letter.
To place each texture she selected the text object (it doesn’t have to be 
Touch Type mode), clicked the Draw Inside Mode icon, and chose a JPEG 
via Edit> Place ( -Shift-P/Ctrl-Shift-P). With that placed image still selected, 
she used the Selection tool to resize and position it so it appeared to be 
inside one speciﬁc letter. Then, switching back to the Touch Type tool, she 
selected that (now textured) letter, set the ﬁll to None, and adjusted its 
blending mode by clicking Opacity in the Control panel (Letter with Texture). 
To readjust a masked image that wasn’t currently selected, she targeted it in 
the Layers panel.

Rethinking Construction
Rethinking Construction
INTRODUCTION
Constructing objects is at the heart of artwork in Illustrator, and nowhere has 
Illustrator been more innovative than in finding new ways to construct new 
objects from the amalgamation of simple paths and shapes. The early days of 
painstakingly constructing and joining every path, anchor point by anchor 
point, is giving way to methods of coloring shapes in ways that create new 
objects or that more closely simulate drawing with pencil and paper. This 
chapter works its way from newer methods for combining and editing shapes
—using the semi-automatic methods of the Eraser, Blob Brush, the Shape 
Builder tools, Live Paint, and Image Trace—to older methods such as the 
Pathfinder panel and working with compound paths and shapes. Here also 
you’ll find drawing assistants—such as drawing inside or behind objects, 
joining paths, and aligning objects and anchor points—that will help you to 
combine basic paths and objects.
THE ERASER TOOLS & THE BLOB BRUSH
One of the easiest ways to separate and combine objects is using the Eraser 
and the Blob Brush tools. With the Eraser tool you can cut an object into 
many parts, and with the Blob Brush you can combine multiple objects with 
the same fill attributes (and no stroke).
The Eraser tools
If nothing is selected, the Eraser tool (or the eraser end of your stylus if 
you’re using a graphics tablet) erases objects as you drag over them. To 
restrict the effect of the Eraser tool, select the paths you want to edit, then 
drag the Eraser tool through them, or enter isolation mode. If you want 
certain paths to be protected from the Eraser tool when nothing is selected, 
lock or hide those paths or their layer. You can constrain the direction of the 
Eraser tool by Shift-dragging, or by Option-dragging/Alt-dragging a marquee 
to erase a rectangular area. The Eraser tool also has the calligraphic 
attributes of the Paintbrush tool: Double-click the Eraser tool in the Tools 
panel to customize it.
136

LISA JACKMORE
To put holes into this chair, Lisa Jackmore just clicked with the Eraser tool, auto-
matically turning the chair into a compound path, and 
revealing the blue underneath
The Path Eraser tool (hidden beneath the Pencil in the Tools panel) erases 
parts of selected paths. To remove a portion of a path, you must erase along 
(not perpendicular to) a selected path. Erasing a midsection of a path leaves 
an open anchor point on either side of the erasure.
If the Blob Brush doesn’t merge
Can’t merge objects using the Blob Brush tool? Check the following:
• Objects must be the same fill color and have no stroke
• With Merge Only with Selected Objects on, objects must be selected to merge
• With Merge Only with Selected off, objects must be adjacent in the stacking order (you can’t
have a differently styled object in between in the stacking order; see Layers panel below)
137

The Blob Brush tool
In case you were wondering, the Blob “brush” is in this chapter, and not with 
the other brushes in the Expressive Strokes chapter, because it functions more 
like the Eraser than a brush. If you paint the same brushstroke using the Blob 
Brush tool and the Calligraphic Paintbrush, they might at first appear 
similar; if you switch to Outline mode, however, the difference becomes clear. 
An Illustrator vector path runs down the middle of a Paintbrush stroke, and 
the application of the Paintbrush remains live, which means the brushstroke 
can be restyled or edited like any other path in Illustrator. In contrast, a mark 
made by the Blob Brush is expanded as soon as you complete a stroke. Where 
a Paintbrush brushstroke is defined by the single path down its middle, a 
Blob Brush brushstroke is defined by a path around its outer edge. Following 
are some rules and tips for painting with the Blob Brush:
• To paint with the Blob Brush tool, select it, set a stroke color, and drag a
brushstroke. Your stroke is automatically expanded and the fill takes the 
current stroke color, while the stroke itself is removed. The Blob Brush 
merges successive brushstrokes depending upon the options you set. As long 
as you keep painting with the same Fill/Stroke and Opacity, overlapping 
brushstrokes will merge. If you change any of these, your brushstrokes will 
stay separate.
• To customize the Blob Brush tool, double-click its icon in the Tools panel. If
you enable Keep Selected, you can immediately alter the path with the 
Smooth tool, or make it easy to add to an existing path in a crowded 
illustration by enabling the “Merge Only With Selected” option. When 
“Merge Only With Selected” is on, the Blob Brush tool only affects the 
selected paths if it’s selected and you drag over it using the same stroke color 
and opacity. Disabling this option allows the Blob Brush tool to edit paths 
created with the exact same appearance, regardless of whether or not the 
paths are selected.
• To modify a path that was drawn using another tool, draw the object using any
Fill and a Stroke of None. Use the Blob Brush with the same Stroke color as 
the object’s Fill, and add your brushstrokes to the object. The Blob Brush 
won’t edit a path with a stroke, and if you edit an open path with the Blob 
Brush, it will create a closed path. To add to a compound shape, first expand 
it.
• To modify and combine multiple objects that share the same Fill color with no
Stroke, make sure they are on the same layer and contiguous in the stacking 
order.
• To create calligraphic strokes with a pressure-sensitive stylus and tablet (such
138

as a Wacom) use the Blob Brush Options dialog to change brush shape and 
drawing angle.
• To reﬁne the edges of a Blob Brush brushstroke, use the Eraser tool. You can’t
do this with Brush tool strokes.
Protection from the Blob Brush
Here are three ways to protect objects from Blob Brush:
• Set the preference to Merge Only with Selected
• Enter isolation mode
• Lock or hide paths you don’t want affected
Swift switching to smooth...
Press Option/Alt to access the Smooth tool from the Blob Brush, Paintbrush, 
and Pencil tools. (For CC changes to this, see “The New Pencil Settings (for 
other tools too)” section later in this chapter.
The Blob Brush tool won’t affect non-selected paths (left) with strokes or ﬁll colors 
different from the current ﬁll color (center), but if your 
current color matches the unselected path then you can 
add to the original path by dragging over it with the 
Blob Brush tool (right)
SHAPE BUILDER TOOL
Although it bears some similarities to Live Paint and Pathfinder commands 
(discussed later in this chapter), the Shape Builder tool presents an entirely 
new method for constructing objects. When you initially draw, you can allow 
objects to overlap in the interior of the outline you want to create; e.g., 
drawing a three-leaf clover from three overlapping circles and an overlapping 
rectangle for the stem. With the Shape Builder tool, all you need to do is to 
first select the objects you want to combine into new shapes, then place your 
cursor over an area. To unite one area with others, simply click-drag across 
from one highlighted area to another. You can click-drag in a straight line, or 
Shift-drag a marquee over selected areas to unite multiple areas. Your objects 
don’t need to reside on the same layer to start, but when they are merged 
with an initial shape, they will be moved to that shape’s layer. To delete areas 
or strokes from your selected artwork using the Shape Builder tool, press the 
Option/Alt key while clicking on the highlighted area or portion of a stroke.
Depending on how your options are set, you can either select swatch colors as 
139

you go (with a Swatch preview cursor), or use the colors already in the 
highlighted object (double-click the tool to choose which method to use). If 
you choose “Pick Color From Color Swatches” in the Options dialog, you can 
enable the Cursor Swatch Preview. Now you can use the left and right arrow 
keys to switch the current color to the next color in any selected color group 
in the Swatches panel, or the up and down arrow keys to move to another 
color group. If you choose “Pick Color From Artwork,” the first object you 
click on will determine the color that fills the others as you drag. Separate 
objects can easily become merged into a single object. The rules for filling 
objects can be complex, so see the Tip “Shape Builder & appearances” Shape 
Builder Appearances if an object’s appearance isn’t what you expected.
Shape Builder & appearances
Changing the order and direction with which you drag to apply the Shape Builder tool can alter 
the appearance of the resulting objects. If you aren’t getting the results you want, undo and try 
starting the merge with a different object.
One of the most powerful aspects of Shape Builder is that you are actually 
reconstructing how objects are made and filled, not just how they look on the 
surface. When working with strokes, those you keep remain live and editable, 
whereas Live Paint or Pathfinder commands might result in strokes that have 
become unexpectedly expanded or deleted. You can continue to modify the 
appearance of your Shape Builder strokes. Your new objects do not become a 
special kind of group, either, so you can freely switch between regular editing 
tools and the Shape Builder tool.
Handling gaps in Shape Builder
In Shape Builder Options, (double-click on the Shape Builder tool), you can choose a Gap 
setting, whether to fill open paths as if they were closed, and whether you want to click on a 
path to split an object into two or more areas.

jects using the Shape Builder tool; (lower right) return-

colors and setting the stroke weight to None

Shape Builder and holes
To merge shapes and create holes in them, hold Option/Alt and click on an area or stroke to 
delete it. The Shape Builder tool, like the Blob Brush, can generate compound paths.
Retain your strokes
To retain interior strokes in your drawing, click to fill the shapes separately, rather than 
dragging across them to join, even when you want to use the same fill on these shapes.

ﬁgure by ﬁlling and deleting areas created by overlap-

Shape Builder to reconﬁgure objects you can simply se-
lect sections using the Direct Selection tool and continue 
to change the ﬁll and stroke, adjust transparency, and 
more; a dashed brush beneath is shown to demonstrate 
transparency
Shape Builder as Paint Bucket
The Shape Builder tool can also be used like an ordinary Paint Bucket tool; click (instead of 
click-drag) to fill shapes without uniting them.
WORKING WITH LIVE PAINT
Hidden under the Shape Builder tool are the Live Paint Bucket and Live Paint 
Selection tools. Whereas the Shape Builder tool helps you to reconstruct and 
combine objects, Live Paint provides you with a way to recolor objects 
without modifying the vector paths, ignoring the normal rules about how you 
define a vector object. Paint lines and spaces as if you were coloring a 
drawing by hand. In order to use these tools, you have to first convert your 
objects into a Live Paint Group; all the enclosed spaces, filled or empty, 
become areas you can potentially fill or clear of color. You can create a “hole” 
in your Live Paint object by filling with None, or you can fill an “empty” area 
141

made from adjacent vector objects with your selected color. All the lines 
become editable paths that you can keep, color, reshape, or delete, creating 
new shapes. To convert a selection to a Live Paint Group, choose the Live 
Paint Bucket tool and click on the object, or choose Object> Live Paint> 
Make (
-Option-X/Ctrl-Alt-X); like any other grouped object, Live Paint 
objects all move to the topmost layer that contained the original objects.
To change the way the Live Paint Bucket behaves, double-click on it and set 
options, such as whether the Bucket paints fills, strokes, or both; whether you 
want a Cursor Swatch Preview; or the color and size of the highlight you see 
when you position the Bucket over an editable area. Choose how Live Paint 
handles gaps in the Object> Live Paint> Gap Options dialog. To edit paths 
and reshape areas, use normal editing tools, such as the Pen or Smooth tool. 
To actually alter or delete segments of paths (created from intersecting paths 
in Live Paint), use the Live Paint Selection tool.

Adding to a Live Paint Group
Add new members to a Live Paint Group by selecting the new paths and the Live Paint Group, 
then clicking the Merge Live Paint button in the Control panel (or choose Object> Live Paint> 
Merge). Or even better, enter isolation mode with the Live Paint Group; then anything you 
paste or create will remain part of the Live Paint Group (see the chapter Your Creative
Workspace for more on isolation mode).
Expanding/releasing Live Paint
If you choose Object> Live Paint> Expand, or click the Expand button in the Control panel, 
your objects will be converted into ordinary vector paths that look the same, but are broken 
apart into separate objects. To revert the objects in your Live Paint Group back to their pre–
Live Paint, ordinary-path state, choose Object> Live Paint> Release.
USING IMAGE TRACE
Previously called Live Trace, Image Trace provides you with a variety of 
different ways to turn raster images into vectors. To access default presets in 
Image Trace (such as Photorealistic or Technical Drawing), select any raster 
image that you’ve brought into Illustrator via Open or Place, and click either 
the Image Trace button in the Control panel or Trace in the Image Trace 
panel (Window menu). Use the Image Trace panel to enable or disable 
preview, customize your trace settings, and save your current settings as 
custom presets. Image Trace leaves the traced object live and re-adjustable. If 
you want to edit the objects with normal vector tools, you’ll need to expand 
the trace by clicking the Expand button on the Control panel, after which the 
object will no longer be live.
Stop the Preview!
In order to adjust settings without prompting Image Trace to re-trace as soon as one setting is 
altered, toggle Preview off after an initial trace, and back on when you want to test your 
settings again.
The Image Trace panel
In the Image Trace panel, you can specify a color mode (Color, Grayscale, or 
Black and White) and a Palette of colors for the tracing object. The palette 
determines whether your trace will use a limited or unlimited number of 
colors, and whether to take them automatically from the object or to use a 
Swatch group or library (Pantone converts to global color) that is open or has 
been opened during the session. If you want another library, or need to create 
a new color group, deselect the object, open the library or create the color 
group, and then reselect the image and choose your new library or group 
from the Color drop-down list. In the Image Trace panel, select the open 
library in the Palette drop-down list, and then select a color group listed in 
Colors. Using sliders, you can modify how closely paths adhere to the original 
and set tolerances for when paths join with corner angles, or whether the 
trace should ignore pixels as noise. In Black and White Mode, you can choose 
143

to create Fills and/or Strokes.
Image Trace can create vector objects that abut one another (like puzzle 
pieces), or that overlap each other (stacking one on top of another). If you 
intend to edit the paths, you should probably choose the “Overlapping” 
option; with the “Abutting” option, the paths fit together precisely, so editing 
one path can create a gap between it and its neighboring (abutting) path. 
With Abutting as the Method, you can automatically remove a white 
background from your image by enabling “Ignore White.”

Even though most Align and Distribute controls also appear in the Control 
panel, Distribute Spacing controls are found only in the Align panel. With an 
active selection, you can align objects to that selection, or the edges of the 
artboard, and you can Align to a Key Object (heavy outlines show you which 
object the others align to). To distribute the space between objects, designate 
one as the key; in the Align panel, enter an amount in the Distribute Spacing 
input box; then click either the Vertical or Horizontal Distribute Space icon.

Easier joins
It’s now easy to join open endpoints without getting an error dialog, and you 
can even join multiple pairs of endpoints together at the same time. To join 
you must first either select one pair of points with the Direct Selection tool, 
or select one or more open paths with the Selection tool. Next, if a pair of 
points are exactly on top of each other, you can join them without a dialog by 
using 
-J/Ctrl-J or Object> Path> Join. Use the Control panel to change a 
join from corner to smooth, or vice versa. If points are not exactly on top of 
each other, choosing join will connect them with a line, or you can average 
them together first (see below for more on averaging). If you select multiple 
open objects and choose Join, one object will join to the next (paths won’t 
close upon themselves). At any time you can convert points from corner to 
smooth, or smooth to corner, by selecting the anchor points with the Direct 
Selection tool and clicking the appropriate icon from the Convert section in 
the Control panel. Below are some rules about joining and averaging:
• Endpoints that are precisely on top of one another join with a corner point unless
you choose “Smooth” in the Join dialog (
-Option-Shift-J/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-J).
• Joining two or more open endpoints on separate paths that are not precisely on top
of each other connects the points with a straight segment using corner points. 
If your paths have different appearances applied, the path topmost in the 
ALIGNING, JOINING, AND AVERAGING
Align and distribute objects
146

stacking order determines the appearance of the paths as they are joined to 
it.
• Average and join two endpoints that are not on top of each other using 
-Option-
Shift-J/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-J.
• To average (without joining) endpoints, select any number of points with the
Direct Selection or Lasso tool on any number of objects; then use 
-Option-
J/Ctrl-Alt-J to average the points along horizontal, vertical, or both axes. If 
you have the path selected, but not specific points, then all points will be 
averaged together. If you use the Direct Selection or Lasso tool to select 
points, then the Align icons in the Control panel or Align panel will average 
the points, rather than align the objects.
DRAW BEHIND AND DRAW INSIDE
Illustrator has three drawing mode icons near the bottom of your Tools 
panel: Normal, Behind, and Inside. Once you click the Draw Behind icon, 
anything that you paste or draw will be the backmost object in your current 
layer, or, if you have something selected, will be placed directly behind the 
currently selected object. (Paste in Front and Paste in Back still work as 
expected, and ignore the drawing mode.) If the Draw Behind mode is active 
when you add a new layer to your file, it will add it behind the active layer. To 
create an object with a different appearance from the selected object, create it 
first, then change the new object’s attributes. Or, if you want to be able to set 
an object’s attributes before drawing it, enter isolation mode first. The object 
you’re drawing behind doesn’t need to be selected when you’re in isolation 
mode. You can safely deselect it, and then set the attributes for each new 
object before you draw it.
Draw Inside is only available when one object (or compound path or text 
object) is selected, and will quickly make a clipping mask out of the selected 
object. When your originally selected object is automatically converted to this 
special clipping mask, it loses any attributes beyond the basic stroke and a 
fill, so art brushes or live effects, for instance, are removed. To set up your 
object for Draw Inside, first select it, then click on the Drawing Mode icon in 
the Tools panel and choose Draw Inside. Your selected object will display the 
dotted corners of a bounding box. Next deselect the object (the dotted box 
remains); now you can choose your drawing tool or brush and its attributes. 
Now you only have to draw over the object to have any strokes or fills that 
extend outside to be clipped to the boundaries of the selected object. Your 
clipping mask object and whatever you have drawn inside are now a group. 
To edit any part of this new object, use the Direct Selection tool or target it in 
the Layers panel and edit as a regular vector object. You can even apply 
effects to the entire group, if you desire. You can also copy and paste artwork 
in Draw Inside mode, which will clip the artwork inside text, for example. 
Learn more about working with clipping masks in the Mastering Complexity 
chapter.
Toggle drawing modes
You can use the keyboard shortcut Shift-D to switch between available modes. Keep an eye 
on the changing icon to know which drawing mode you have selected.

Don’t forget the drawing mode
IMPORTANT: Drawing modes are persistent! If you forget what mode you’re 
in, you’ll get unexpected results. Try to get in the habit of switching to 
Normal mode (Shift-D) as soon as you no longer need to be in that special 
drawing mode.
COMPOUND SHAPES & COMPOUND PATHS
There are three additional ways to create new objects by combining and 
subtracting objects with and from each other: compound shapes, compound 
paths, and by using the commands found in the Pathfinder panel. Compound 
paths and compound shapes are live and can easily be released to recover the 
original paths. Compound paths are used primarily to create holes in objects, 
whereas compound shapes provide more complex ways of combining objects. 
The Pathfinder panel icons perform operations very much like compound 
shapes, except that these operations are applied permanently—Undo is the 
only way to reverse the effects of a pathfinder operation. If you wish to apply 
a live version of a Pathfinder command to a layer, type object, or a group, 
instead of using the Pathfinder panel, apply it from either the Effects menu, 
or the fx icon from the Appearance panel.
Compound paths or shapes?
Use compound paths on simple objects for basic combining or hole-cutting. Use compound 
shapes on complex objects (such as those made with additional effects) and to fully control 
how your objects interact. Be aware that compound shapes can become too complex to print, 
or to be combined within some effects, and might have to be released (returning objects to 
their original state) or expanded (which keeps the appearance, but breaks it apart 
permanently). Make/release/expand compound shapes from the Pathfinder panel menu, and 
make/release compound paths from the Object menu.
Compound paths
A compound path consists of one or more paths that have been combined so 
they behave as a single unit. Compound paths can be used as a single mask, 
and they can create holes where the original objects overlapped (think of the 
letter O), through which you can see objects.
To create a simple compound path, draw one oval, then draw a smaller oval 
that will form the center hole of the O, and choose Object> Compound Path> 
Make. Apply the fill color of your choice, and the inner object remains 
unfilled. To adjust one of the paths within a compound path, use the Direct 
Selection tool; or select the compound path and enter isolation mode.
Pathfinder panel
The Pathfinder panel includes the top row of Shape Modes icons and the 
lower row of Pathfinder commands. The Pathfinder panel’s icons alter the 
149

selected objects permanently, slicing them up if needed to achieve the icon’s 
effect (see the “Compound shapes” section following about applying the top 
row as live effects). These permanent alterations to the objects allow you to, 
for example, apply the Intersect icon to selected objects so that you can pull 
apart and further edit the resulting pieces. Note that the Trim and Merge 
commands can be applied only to filled objects.
The Pathﬁnder panel contains two sets of icons: Shape Modes (which combine 
shapes), and Path-ﬁnders (which divide paths)
Left to right: two ovals (the inner oval has no ﬁll, but appears black because of the 
black ﬁll of the larger oval behind it); as part of a com-
pound path the inner oval knocks a hole into the outer 
one where they overlap; the same compound path with 
inner oval, which was Direct-Selected and moved to the 
right to show that the hole is only where the objects 
overlap
150

compound shapes, hold the Option/Alt key as you click a Shape Mode icon in 
the Pathfinder panel; if you click without the Option/Alt modifier, original 
objects are permanently altered. You can also apply the Unite Shape mode by 
choosing “Make Compound Shape” from the Pathfinder panel menu. 
Compound shapes take on the attributes of the topmost object in the 
selection.
As long as you keep compound shapes live, you can continue to apply (or 
remove) Shape Modes and add a variety of effects to the compound shape as 
a unit, such as envelopes, warps, and drop shadows. Compound shapes can 
also be pasted into Photoshop as editable shape layers, although they won’t 
retain their Illustrator appearance.
To retain their appearance and keep them editable, paste them as vector 
Smart Objects (to edit a Smart Object, double-click its thumbnail in 
Photoshop and it will open in Illustrator; when you save, it updates in 
Photoshop). Release the Shape Mode to restore the original objects, or click 
Expand to permanently apply the effect to the objects, using Pathfinder 
Options from the panel’s menu.

shapes; the second column shows the results of the oper-
ation; and the third column shows the resulting objects

Minus Front
Compound shapes
A compound shape combines objects with, or subtracts objects from, each 
other, while leaving the original objects intact. You can make compound 
shapes from two or more paths or from other compound shapes, text, 
envelopes, blends, groups, or artwork with vector effects applied. To create

your Selection tool (from any path or point) and drag until they “snap to” a guide or another 
anchor point (the cursor turns white).
Modifier keys for drawing...
For a long list of modifier keys to control how you draw with the geometric tools (e.g., increase 
or decrease sides of a polygon or points in a star, modify the radius of a spiral, and reposition 
the object as you draw), search Illustrator Help for “keys for drawing.”
Path Simplify command
The Simplify command (Object> Path> Simplify) removes excess anchor points from selected 
paths. The higher the percentage, the more anchor points will remain, and the closer the new 
path will be to the original. The endpoints of an open path are never altered. The higher the 
Angle threshold, the more likely a corner point will remain sharp.
Resizing and stroke weight
Double-click the Scale tool to resize your selection with or without altering line weights:
• To scale a selection while also scaling line weights, enable Scale Strokes & Effects.
• To scale a selection while maintaining your line weights, disable Scale Strokes & Effects.
• To decrease line weights (50%) without scaling objects, first scale the selection (200%) with
Scale Strokes & Effects disabled. Then scale (50%) with it enabled. Reverse these steps to 
increase line weights.
 CC’S LIVE CORNERS AND PATH EDITING
WORKING WITH LIVE CORNERS & LIVE RECTANGLES
Since first introducing Live Corners in an early version of Illustrator CC, 
Adobe has continued to enhance features to provide you with more feedback 
and control. In this section, you’ll learn how to edit the corners of objects 
created with any tool from any version of Illustrator. Then you’ll learn to use 
the added controls provided for working with objects created with the 
Rectangle tool.
Free Transform Touch interface
The redesigned Free Transform interface for both touch devices and 
computers hasn’t changed the tool’s function, but selecting it displays a 
floating strip of icons for transforming objects, and the bounding box 
displays new cursors to indicate the type of transformation you’ve selected. 
Using a stylus or your finger, click or tap on an icon, and if desired, drag the 
pivot point for rotation anywhere on the screen. Select the link icon to 
constrain transformations; you don’t need any modifier keys. Keyboard 
shortcuts still perform as they used to, but now the touch interface is always 
displayed when you choose the Free Transform tool (E).

One of the most powerful features of Live Corners is that it will recognize 
editable corners in any object, even if you created the object before there 
were Live Corners. You can create the object with geometric tools (Rectangle, 
Star, Polygon, etc.) or with drawing tools, such as the Pen and Pencil tools. 
Use the Direct Selection tool to select an entire object and display the Live 
Corner widgets on every corner that is editable. You can reshape selected 
corners interactively by dragging on one of the visible widgets.
If the entire path is selected, dragging on one widget modifies every corner 
equally. To restrict your edits to only some corners, select corner anchors 
individually with the Direct Selection tool, (or select them with the Lasso 
tool, but then switch back to the Direct Selection tool to display widgets 
again). If you drag on a corner widget and a corner path turns red, your 
corner anchor point has run into another anchor point, and you won’t be able 
to drag your widget any further unless you’re willing to move the anchor 
point blocking your corner anchor.
Dragging on one widget alters all selected corner anchor points—when the limit for 
rounding is reached as the corner anchor meets another 
anchor, the corner paths turn red (top). The Relative set-
ting alters the corner shape (bottom).
155

In addition to dragging, you also have the following dialog and keyboard 
controls on selected widgets:
• To cycle between corner types, click on the widget while holding down the
Option/Alt key.
• To access the Corners dialog, use the Direct Selection tool to either double-
click on a widget or to click on the Corners link in the Control panel. With the 
Corners dialog, you can use numeric input for the corner radius, choose from 
three types—Round, Inverted Round, and Chamfer (beveled)—and whether 
the corner should be Absolute (describing a mathematically precise arc 
between points, and a bit flattened), or a more natural Relative, which tends 
to extend the rounding in a manner you might draw by hand.
The special properties of Rectangles
Rectangles, created only with the Rectangle or Rounded Rectangle tools, 
have some specific Live Corner features that become active only when the 
rectangle is selected and your active tool is the Rectangle, Rounded 
Rectangle, or the Selection tool. If your Transform panel is open or you click 
on the Shape link in the Control panel to open a proxy dialog, you’ll find 
additional properties for scale and rotation, along with those features 
common to Live Corners. The Control panel itself also contains input fields 
for Height, Width, and Corner Type. However, if your Direct Selection tool is 
active, a Live Rectangle will look like, and can only be edited like, any other 
Live Corner object, making use of only those features found in the Corners 
dialog. In the Layers panel, you can identify objects drawn with the Rectangle 
tool by looking for the sublayer name <Rectangle> instead of the generic 
<Path>.
Use Shape Properties/Rectangle Properties in the Control and Transform 
panels to input height and width numerically, as well as the corner radius for 
each corner. You can set the Corner Type here by choosing a Corner Type 
icon (or Option/Alt-click on a widget to cycle through them). The icon will 
update to display the Corner Type you selected. Enable or disable Scale 
Rectangle Corners in either panel when you scale a rectangle with a Live 
Corner attribute already applied to it. This feature works like the Scale 
Strokes & Effects feature; when enabled it will increase or decrease the 
corner radius to keep the appearance the same at any size, while it keeps the 
radius intact instead when disabled.
156

Access editable properties for Live Rectangles in the Shape Properties panel 
(opened from the Control panel, top), as well as 
in the  Control and the Transform panels (middle 
and bottom).
157

Live Rectangles display not only corner widgets, but also transform control handles. 
Shape and Transform panels indicate dimensions, angle 
of rotation, corner types, and radii; the Transform panel 
also enables scaling corners.
Your preferences for working with Corners
Live Corners and Live Rectangles come with a few default settings that can 
make your day—or ruin it, so you should be aware of them:
• Hide Corner Widgets for angles greater than 177°, found in Preferences>
Selection and Anchor Display, is the default angle that determines when a 
corner anchor point is not an editable Live Corner anchor. If you’re seeing 
too many corner widgets, change the angle here and some radii now won’t be 
converted to Live Corners.
158

Corner Widget. If 100 or more widgets are selected, they’re hidden by 
default.
Set an angle in Preferences above which no corners will be editable with the Live 
Corner feature
• Show on Rectangle Creation, located in the Transform panel’s pop-up menu,
opens that panel into your workspace whenever you use the Rectangle tool, if 
the panel isn’t already in your workspace. It’s on by default. You can disable 
this behavior in the panel menu.
With the Rectangle tool and the rectangle object selected, toggle this icon in the 
Control panel to show/hide the widgets
• After drawing a rectangle, while it’s still selected and the Rectangle tool is
active, you can hide the corner widgets by toggling off the Hide Corner 
Widget icon in the Control panel, next to the link for Shape (which is on by 
default). It’s quicker than using the View menu to show/hide corner widgets, 
but it only works with rectangles.
• If the view of your object is cluttered with corner widgets, choose View> Hide
159

Select similar Live Rectangles
You’ll find Shapes in the Select Similar menu. It finds other Live Rectangles/
Rounded Rectangles, not other shapes.
Convert legacy rectangles
Convert rectangles made before Illustrator CC into Live Rectangles by 
selecting them and choosing Object> Shape> Convert to Rectangle. Convert 
back to ordinary rectangles by choosing Object> Shape> Expand Rectangle.
PEN TOOL CHANGES & RESHAPING PATHS
Without changing your customary methods to create or edit paths, Illustrator 
CC adds functions, including a Reshape Segment cursor, accessible from your 
Pen, Direct Selection, and Anchor Point tools. When hovering over a path 
segment with the Pen tool, hold down the Option/Alt key to display a 
Reshape Segment cursor that indicates you can now drag the segment freely 
to reshape it. If you also hold the Shift key, your direction handles will be of 
equal length and perpendicular to the path. Another enhancement to the Pen 
tool is invoked if you press 
/Ctrl while dragging out Bézier handles, the In 
handle freezes, while you can still drag on the Out handle to make it longer or 
shorter without breaking the smooth pairing between them. While dragging 
with the Pen tool, press the spacebar to relocate the current anchor point.
The Direct Selection tool will only display the Reshape cursor if at least one 
of the anchor points connected to the path segment has a direction handle 
connected to it. You won’t see the Reshape Segment cursor on straight path 
segments that have retracted handles on either side.
You also can use the Anchor Point tool (formerly called the Convert Anchor 
Point tool), to reshape path segments by dragging directly on them. 
Additionally, if you press Option/Alt, then click on a broken direction handle, 
you can convert the anchor to a smooth anchor with paired, unbroken 
handles.
Draw with a rubber band
The Pen tool has acquired a new preference; now as you move from placing 
one anchor point to another, a “rubber band” can help you preview the shape 
of your path. Enable/disable this feature in Preferences> Selection and 
Anchor Display.
Dragging with the new Reshape Segment cursor to directly adjust a segment of a 
path; you can access the Reshape Segment cursor from 
the Pen tool, the Direct Selection tool, and the Anchor 
Point tool (see details in “Pen Tool Changes & 
Reshaping Paths” section nearby)

THE NEW PENCIL SETTINGS (FOR OTHER TOOLS TOO)
The Pencil tool has undergone what appears to be a very small change, but in 
fact will change the way you work with it. Gone is the Smoothness slider, and 
instead you have one Fidelity slider. By default, the Pencil tool now smooths 
a hand-drawn path, which can result in fewer anchor points. However, you 
can double-click the Pencil tool to open Pencil Options where you can adjust 
the Fidelity slider from (the most) Accurate to (the most) Smooth. You’ll see 
the same Fidelity settings for the Smooth tool, Paintbrush, and Blob Brush 
tools.
Various objects Kevin Stohlmeyer drew using the new Pencil tool, freeform, and 
with Option/Alt and click-dragging to create straight 
lines
If you need to draw precisely with the Pencil, Paint-brush, or Blob Brush 
tools, you must move the Fidelity slider all the way to the far left (most 
Accurate). Choose Smoother options if you want fewer points and more 
graceful curves, If you are a seasoned Pencil user, you should be aware that 
there has been another change in the default behavior of the tool. Now by 
default, pressing the Option/Alt key with the Pencil tool selected will switch 
to drawing straight lines or, if within tolerances for editing the path, 
straighten the curve between segments. If you want to restore the ability to 
access the Smooth tool with the Option/Alt key for easy path smoothing 
while drawing, choose that option in the Pencil Tool Options dialog. The CC 
Pencil tool now automatically closes a path when your end point is close to 
the start point. To keep the path from closing, zoom in so the distance 
between start and end appears farther apart. Your Fidelity setting determines 
if the path joins with a smooth or corner point.

PUTNAM
 Combining Paths
Basic Path Construction with Pathﬁnders
Overview: Create an illustration by joining and intersecting objects using the 
Pathﬁnder panel’s Unite, Minus Front, and Intersect.
To create many eye-catching stock illustrations like the one above, Ryan 
Putnam frequently uses the Pathfinder panel. Using the Pathfinder’s Unite, 
Minus Front, and Intersect, you too can easily create compelling character 
illustrations. (If you have Illustrator CC, don’t miss the CC sections in this 
chapter for details on how to construct with Live Rectangles and Live 
Corners.)
1 Constructing the body with the Unite Pathﬁnder command. Ryan Putnam creat-
ed the body from two rounded rectangles. To create the first object, he 
clicked on the Artboard with the Rounded Rectangle tool to open the Round-
ed Rectangle dialog. In the dialog, he set the dimensions of the rectangle to 3 
in for Width, 3.5 in for Height, and increased the Corner Radius to 1.25. Put-
nam wanted the bottom corners of the body to be smaller, so he then created 
a second rectangle with the same dimensions, entered .5 for the Corner Ra-
dius, and placed the top a third of the way down from the first rectangle.

Putnam selected both rectangles, clicked the Horizontal Align Center icon 
from the Control panel, used the Unite command from the Pathfinder panel, 
and chose a Cyan swatch from the Swatches panel.
2 Constructing the mouth with the Minus Front Path-ﬁnder command. With the El-
lipse tool, Putnam drew a circle within the body object for the mouth. He 
then drew an encompassing rectangle halfway up from the center of the 
circle. He selected both, clicked the Minus Front command from the 
Pathfinder panel, and chose a brown swatch from the Swatches panel.

3 Constructing the teeth and tongue with Pathﬁnder commands. To create the 
tongue, Putnam created two overlapping circles within the mouth shape, se-
lected both, and used the Unite Pathfinder command. To fit the tongue into 
the mouth, he first copied the mouth shape, and then chose Edit> Paste in 
Front. Selecting both the mouth copy and the tongue, he applied the Intersect 
Pathfinder command, and then chose a magenta swatch from the Swatches 
panel for the fill color.

To create the teeth, Putnam drew four objects with the Rounded Rectangle 
tool. He rotated one tooth with the Selection tool by moving the cursor along 
the rectangle until he saw the Rotate icon and then dragged the tooth slightly 
to the right. He then selected all four teeth and combined them into a single 
compound path using Object> Compound Path> Make (for more about 
compound paths, see this chapter’s intro). To trim off the portions of the 
teeth that extend above the mouth, Putnam chose Edit> Paste in Front, 
selected the copied mouth and teeth, and used the Intersect Pathfinder 
command.

4 Creating other character features. Putnam then added a number of character 
features and details, such as a 15-pt stroke for the lips, a circle for the back of 
the mouth, another pair of circles for eyes, and a rounded rectangle for the 
stick.

DEL VECHIO
Coloring Line Art
Using Live Paint for Fluid Productivity
Overview: Draw with the Pen tool to trace the minimum paths needed to deﬁne dis-
creet areas; color using Live Paint tools for easy selections.
When Gustavo Del Vechio needed an illustration for his client’s urban 
development proposal, he used Illustrator to draw the initial concept, which 
he developed more fully in 3D Studio Max. He then rendered the artwork and 
placed it back into Illustrator as a template. Seeking to create a lively and 
humanistic interpretation of a crowded city environment, he used the Pen 
tool for tracing and Live Paint to control coloring, so he could give each 
building its own personality.
1 Freeform drawing with the Pen tool in preparation for Live Paint. Since he was 
using Live Paint, Del Vechio was able to draw open paths that would ulti-
mately enclose the areas to be colored, instead of precisely stacking discrete 
objects atop one another and creating the fully closed paths that normal fills 
require. Paths that merely crossed over other paths created separate areas, 
and by drawing only enough paths to separate one area from another, he was 
able to draw more quickly and efficiently, using many fewer paths and layers. 
He kept Smart Guides turned on to help signal him as each anchor and path 
properly lined up with the others.
169

1
Outlining the 3D model with open paths, using the Pen tool and Smart Guides
After he outlined the basic shapes of the building, Del Vechio turned Smart 
Guides off while he drew the doors and windows more freely on their own 
layer. Even though the 3D model had curved lines, in order to create the 
slightly off-kilter look of an illustration, he used only straight segments 
(except for the arched door and circular window). After tracing the artwork, 
he selected it all and clicked on it with the Live Paint Bucket tool (hidden 
under the Shape Builder tool). Once converted to a Live Paint group, the 
content of all the layers automatically moved into the top layer. Del Vechio 
next needed to select and delete a few unwanted segments. While the 
Selection tool selects objects and the Direct Selection tool selects paths, he 
was able to use the Live Paint Selection tool to select, then delete, individual 
faces and line segments.

Removing unwanted intersecting edges (highlighted in red) with the Live Paint Se-
lection tool
2 Creating Swatch groups and using Global colors makes it easy to apply, and later 
edit, color. Del Vechio created a small color group for each building. Using the 
Live Paint Bucket tool, he colored each building, cycling through colors in a 
group using the left and right arrow keys, and moving between color groups 
using the up and down keys. He also assigned all the colors he created as 
Global swatches. If he later wanted to replace a color, he only had to replace 
the swatch itself and it would automatically update that color anywhere in 
the document.
172

2
Using Live Paint, small Swatch groups, and the left and right arrow keys to select 
new colors while ﬁlling faces with the Live Paint Bucket 
tool
To ensure he wouldn’t accidentally color a stroke when he only wanted to fill 
a face on the buildings, Del Vechio double-clicked on the Live Paint Bucket 
tool and disabled Paint Strokes in the dialog. After he filled the main areas of 
the buildings, he created a gradient for the lights in the windows. In order to 
paint some of the strokes (but not all), he again opened the Live Paint dialog 
to enable Paint Strokes and disable Paint Fills. He then selected all the 
Strokes and set their weight to None. With the Stroke weight set to 0.75 pt 
and choosing various brown colors, he selectively filled some strokes around 
the windows and doors. Although the strokes were now invisible, Live Paint 
would highlight them when his cursor passed over them.
Finally Del Vechio reset the Live Paint Bucket Options to Paint for both Fills 
and Strokes, then recolored some of the areas and edges to complete his 
whimsical cityscape.

 Blob to Live Paint
From Sketch to Blob Brush and Live Paint
Overview: Place sketch as a template; trace sketch with the Blob Brush tool; color 
with the Live Paint Bucket tool.
Ryan Putnam has a stock illustration portfolio full of hand-drawn 
illustrations. Putnam found that using the new Blob Brush tool and his 
Wacom pen tablet, he could now easily create a hand-drawn look using 
Illustrator. Moreover, by using Live Paint, he could quickly fill his illustration 
with color.
1 Creating a sketch and placing it as a template. Putnam first created a tattoo 
sketch in Photoshop and placed it into Illustrator as a template. Create your 
own sketch, scan it, or sketch directly into a painting program (such as 
Painter or Photoshop). Save your sketch as PSD, JPEG, or TIF format. Next, 
create a new Illustrator document and choose File> Place. Locate your 
sketch, then enable the Template option and click Place (see the chapter Your
Creative Workspace for more on templates).

Placing sketch as a template layer
2 Setting Blob Brush tool options and tracing sketch. Putnam wanted to create 
marks that were very true to his stylus gestures and had minimal 
smoothness. To create this effect with the Blob Brush tool, he first had to 
modify the default options. To do this, he double-clicked on the Blob Brush 
tool in the Tools panel. In Options, he set Fidelity to 1, Smoothness to 0, and 
Size to 5 pt (in CC set one Fidelity slider to Accurate; see “The New Pencil 
Settings (for other tools too)” section in this chapter’s CC introduction for 
more about Fidelity changes). From the Size drop-down menu he selected 
Pressure, changed Size Variation to 5 pt, and clicked OK (if you don’t have a 
pen tablet, you can’t use Pressure settings). Using these custom Blob Brush 
settings, Putnam began to trace the scanned sketch template into the layer 
above, varying his stylus pressure to re-create the hand-drawn style.

While drawing with the Blob Brush tool, Putnam used the Eraser tool, set up 
to work with pressure-sensitivity, to modify brush marks and correct 
mistakes. To do this, Putnam double-clicked the Eraser tool from the Tools 
panel and changed the Diameter to 5 pt. He then selected Pressure from the 
Diameter drop-down menu, changed the Diameter Variation to 5 pt, and 
clicked OK. By setting up the Eraser tool with pressure-sensitive settings, he 
could move easily between the two tools by simply flipping the stylus around.
Setting up default Eraser tool preferences and erasing with the Eraser tool
3 Filling areas with Live Paint. If Putnam used the regular Brush tool to trace 
his sketch, he would have had to create additional paths defining fill areas to 
color the drawing. But Blob Brush objects can easily be converted into Live 
Paint Groups for quick and simple coloring. To convert the illustration to a 
Live Paint Group, Putnam selected the illustration with the Selection tool, 
chose the Live Paint Bucket tool from the Tools panel, and on first click, the 
object became a Live Paint Group. With the Live Paint Bucket tool, he hov-
ered over the selected illustration to highlight areas to fill. With the left and 
right arrow keys, Putnam cycled through the swatches from the Swatch Panel 
until he found his desired color (see the Color Transitions chapter for details 
on creating colors). Once he found the color, he clicked in the area to fill. He 
repeated cycling through the swatches and filled in the other enclosed areas 
of the illustration.

4 Applying ﬁnishing touches. Putnam added additional features as needed. For 
instance, he warped the type and added gradients to the Live Paint fills (see 
the “Arcing Type” lesson in the chapter Designing Type & Layout, and see the 
Color Transitions chapter for gradients details).

David Turton
For a powerful, yet highly detailed drawing of a tiger’s head, David Turton 
relied upon the natural combination of the Blob Brush tool and the Wacom® 
Cintiq21UX tablet computer. Because Turton could draw directly on the 
tablet itself, and his paths would join automatically as they overlapped, he 
felt he had greater control over this kind of meticulous, but still freehand, 
pen-and-ink drawing, without having to interrupt the ﬂow to create a new 
brush or adjust his stroke width. He began a rough sketch with brush 
settings that most closely emulated natural pen strokes. He kept Fidelity and 
Smoothness at their lowest settings to be as true to his hand as possible (in 
CC you adjust only one Fidelity slider, to most Accurate), and used a very 
ﬁne, 2-pixel point.
Gradually Turton reﬁned the tiger’s features, ﬁlling in more detail, and 
keeping the brush tip ﬁne, allowing his strokes to merge naturally as he 
181

drew over them, thickening the detail in some areas for greater deﬁnition. As 
the ﬁle size grew, he began to lock layers he was happy with and to add 
more detail as the drawing progressed. This prevented strokes from 
merging and forcing constant re-renders of the drawing. Such extensive 
detail is very demanding of a computer’s resources. When he had 
completed most of the tiger, he unlocked the layers and merged them all. 
Lastly, he used the Eraser tool to “draw out” the whiskers by erasing next to 
their lines, creating an interruption in the strokes in order to enhance the 
illusion of whiskers overlapping the fur.
JACKSON
Lance Jackson
Lance Jackson drew this fanciful animal using a combination of the Blob 
Brush and Eraser tools. Here is his tale of how this unusual creature came 
into being: “I had the opportunity to apply to a position opening for a Google 
doodler. Part of the preliminary interview process was to take the Google 
182

Graphics Test. The second question was ‘Draw or sketch a furry animal. It 
can be any kind of animal, but most importantly, it should be original.’ I 
submitted three animals. The ﬁrst one was the Vegetarian Cheetah. It was 
initially done as a pencil sketch.
After submitting my ten drawings and digital color paintings to Google (this 
was a timed test) I decided to create another version in Illustrator using the 
Blob Brush. I ﬁrst started with just the merged bodies of the running cheetah 
with the quizzical head of a rabbit. A week later I decided to add the 
background. I continued on using the Blob Brush since it helps to unify the 
similar colors. The Blob Brush provided the best means to merge the 
cheetah and rabbit together without going deep into the DNA code of both 
animals.”

STOPPEE
Janet Stoppee
As a graphic designer and master gardener Janet Stoppee combined her 
two favorite activities to create a seed packet for a Flowering Maple. She 
used a photo of a maple she had grown herself from seed as the basis for 
her illustration. Experience has shown her that prepping a photo before 
tracing it helps produce the desired results.
In Illustrator, choosing a palette to use in Image Trace both simpliﬁes and 
colorizes a photo, but Stoppee has traditionally simpliﬁed ﬁrst with a favorite 
third-party ﬁlter (Topaz Simplify) in Photoshop. In this case, she chose the 
preset Painting Harsh-Color to intensify the natural colors. In Illustrator, she 
opened the ﬁle, selected it, and opened the Image Trace panel. There she 
enabled Preview and experimented with the different presets. Stoppee 
chose Accurate Fidelity with the default settings. After tracing her image, 
she expanded it and zoomed in to 1200%. Unavoidably, even when using 
the Overlap method, complex tracings can still have small holes where 
edges don’t meet. A solid background in a matching color might solve the 
184

problem, but if not, you can do as Stoppee did and manually repair the 
holes with the Direct Selection tool.

MARKIEWICZ
Danuta Markiewicz (Danka)
Danuta “Danka” Markiewicz is a Polish artist who lives in Italy and creates 
wonderful illustrated books using Illustrator and a bit of Photoshop. She 
scans in her sketches, then runs them through Image Trace in black and 
white with “Ignore White” enabled. Danka converts these traced illustrations 
into Live Paint objects and colors and recolors the elements. She brings in 
textures from Photoshop and changes the blending mode to Overlay. She 
brings in her texture a second time and uses Image Trace in color mode. To 
create the bowing she applies Effect> Warp> Arc to the image, and to both 
an image and a drop-shadow. Opening the images and textures in 
Photoshop, she combines some layers with Soft Light blending mode, while 
on others she runs her favorite ﬁlter: Minimum. She integrates text in either 
English or Polish using fonts that simulate handwriting. Though her 
characters are vector-based and graphic in style, her ﬁnal books end up 
rather painterly and richly textured.

GILBERT
Katharine Gilbert
Katharine Gilbert used Illustrator and Photo-shop to produce “Vintage,” an 
image of the multiverse of a rusting truck as it appears in many dimensions. 
She used Image Trace to create her black and white version of the truck 
189

because Photoshop’s Threshold ﬁlter doesn’t retain as much detail. She 
reduced the Threshold setting for this dark photo in order to bring out a 
maximum range of contrast in the 2-color image, and she set Paths to their 
maximum accuracy. To keep the grungy, angular detail throughout, she also 
set Corners to their highest for the least amount of smoothing, and moved 
the Noise setting to a minimum so the ﬁnest detail would be traced. After 
running Image Trace, she clicked on the Expand button in the Options bar, 
resized the image to 6 x 4 inches, and reduced the layer’s Opacity to 20%.
From there, Gilbert opened the .ai ﬁle in Photoshop (saved with PDF 
compatibility, it opens as a PDF), and began layering different versions of 
the truck. She made extensive use of Photo-shop’s blending modes, as well 
as the 3D Postcard feature, in order to reproduce the truck with varying 
color, tonality, and perspective.

GRAHAM
Cheryl Graham
Cheryl Graham drew this self-portrait based on a reference photo she 
simpliﬁed with Image Trace. After placing the photo in Illustrator, she 
opened the Image Trace panel and, from Preset, chose Shades of Gray. 
Graham enabled Preview to see the effects as she adjusted settings until 
paths and corners were simple and there were just a handful of grays. With 
Preview selected, her setting was automatically applied when she closed 
the Image Trace window. Graham placed this version in a locked layer as a 
template to trace over; she also kept a copy of the original photo on her 
artboard as an additional reference. She created a dark global color so she 
would be able to specify various tints of the color as she drew. Graham 
double-clicked on the Blob Brush tool and, in the Blob Brush Options, she 
set Fidelity and Smoothness at their lowest settings (in CC she adjusts only 
Fidelity, to most Accurate), speciﬁed an 8-pt brush size with an 8-pt 
variation, and selected Pressure. In the Color panel, Graham speciﬁed a 
10% tint of the global color and with the Blob Brush drew in the lightest 
values. She repeated the process using progressively darker tints, making a 
separate layer for each tint and gradually building the portrait (Progressively 
Tinting).
Occasionally she increased or decreased the Blob Brush size with the [ ] 
keys. While Graham drew, she kept an enlarged Navigator panel open 
191

(Window> Navigator). When she zoomed into an area, either drawing with 
the Blob Brush, or adjusting a path with the Direct Selection tool, she could 
refer to the Navigator panel and easily see how the changes she made in a 
particular area affected the entire portrait, without having to constantly zoom 
in and out of the drawing. Although the low ﬁdelity Blob Brush setting in CS6 
often creates too many anchor points, Graham prefers to start with this 
setting and later apply Object> Path> Simplify, specifying 95% for Curve 
Precision (if there aren’t too many extra points, she skips the Simplify step 
and applies the Smooth tool instead). To ﬁnish the portrait, Graham made 
custom art brushes with tapered ends (directly above) for the details such 
as the eyelashes and eyebrows. She used a Round Curve Bristle Brush to 
create the shadows behind the head.
KLEMA
Stephen A. Klema
Stephen Klema uses Illustrator’s Live Paint to assist him in the conception 
and construction of his sculptures. For “Wood’s Revenge,” he scanned his 
pencil sketch of the tree and saw blade, then opened it in Illustrator. To keep 
the outline distinct as he ﬁlled in the parts, he used the Pen tool to create a 
contour shape with a white ﬁll and no stroke, and used it as a mask on the 
top layer. He selected the Paint-brush with a 1pt stroke to begin tracing 
(Live Paint converts brushstrokes to basic strokes, so the Pen or Pencil tools 
will also work here). After tracing some of the key lines that would become 
his wood shapes, Klema selected them and chose Object> Live Paint> 
192

Make.
To get a clear view of the relationship between the shapes, he used the Live 
Paint tool (K) to ﬁll the shapes with colors that clearly delineated the 
separate pieces (Live_Paint_Fills). Where necessary, he used the Pen tool to 
add and subtract anchor points, and the Direct Selection tool to adjust the 
paths. Klema then traced another section of his scan. To move this set of 
paths into the Live Paint group, he selected both the new paths and the Live 
Paint object, and chose Object> Live Paint> Merge. In this way, he 
developed all the ﬁlled shapes for his sculpture.
To recolor the shapes so they more closely approximated wood and saw, he 
created a custom swatch group and used the Live Paint tool to reﬁll the 
shapes with their ﬁnal colors. Klema then removed the strokes to see how 
well the colors and contrast worked. With his concept ﬁnalized as a Live 
Paint object, he could move on to creating the template ﬁles needed to 
make the sculpture itself.

Stephen A. Klema
Stephen Klema found that the Shape Builder tool helped him to save time 
when creating some of the tool illustrations in his art animation and 
interactive design piece entitled “100 Days.” To construct the drill bit, for 
instance, Klema began by drawing basic 4-sided objects with the Rectangle 
tool, and 3-sided objects using the Star tool (reducing it to three sides using 
the down arrow key). He then added points with the Add Anchor Point tool, 
and shifted the points using the Direct Selection tool (holding the Shift key to 
constrain movement). When the basic shapes were in the proper position, 
he selected them all and then used the Shape Builder tool to start 
combining some objects by click-dragging from one to the other (e.g., from 
the bottom orange object to the top triangle), and deleting others and even 
making holes by holding Option/Alt when clicking (or click-dragging). When 
the drill bit was properly combined he marquee-Direct-Selected the top 
anchor points and Shift-dragged the points upwards to elongate the point. 
Finally, he recolored the newly conﬁgured objects. See Klema’s “100 Days” 
project at www.StephenKlema.com/100days.
STEUER

Overview: Create overlapping objects, color them with a Premedia Systems script, 
and use the Shape Builder tool to unite some parts and delete others; recolor, use 
drawing modes and the Bristle Brush to add a background, shading, and textures; re-
size artboards with another Premedia script.
Artboards for a presentation
To save a project in stages for a presentation: duplicate the current artboard in the Artboards 
panel by dragging it to the New Artboard dialog. Double-click on its name to fit the duplicate in 
the window (double-click the icon to rename) and continue working.
Sharon Steuer created this piece for a user group demo highlighting how 
some newer features in Illustrator—the Shape Builder tool, drawing modes, 
and the Bristle Brush—make constructing objects quicker and easier.
1 Constructing the bowl from overlapping objects. Since the Shape Builder can 
both unite objects and delete parts of intersecting objects, using it can be 
much simpler and quicker than either drawing precisely with the Pen tool, or 
using Pathfinder commands. To follow along with the figures in this lesson, 
set the fill and stroke to the default (press the D key), then set the fill to None 
(X toggles focus between fill and stroke; the / key sets the style to None); 
then, with the Ellipse tool (L), draw a series of ovals that align at the center. 
(To help you do this quickly and efficiently, make sure that Smart Guides are 
on (
-U/Ctrl-U), use the modifier keys Option/Alt to draw from the center, 
and use the spacebar key to adjust the position of the oval as you draw.) It’s 
easier to control your use of the Shape Builder tool if each object you’ll be 
working with is a different color. A quick way to do this is to use the Preme-
dia Systems WOW! Colorizer script (install instructions and scripts are on 
WOW! ONLINE). With the script installed, select everything and choose File> 
Scripts> WOW! Artwork Colorizer. In the script dialog, enable “No colors” to 
let the script select colors and save the used colors as a swatch group (your 
colors may differ from the ones shown here). For the next step, you’ll be us-
ing the Shape Builder tool (Shift-M) to hover over the selected shapes, look-
ing at the highlighted areas to see how they will connect. If the areas that you 
wish to maintain aren’t visible (for instance, the purple oval needs to be on 
top in order to form the foot of the bowl), then adjust the stacking order by 
cutting and using Paste in Front/Back. With Pick Color From Artwork en-
abled (double-click on the Shape Builder tool for options), drag from the red 
bowl through the upper half of the purple oval. To delete the side pieces of 
the foot and the top of the bowl, hold down Option/Alt while clicking on 
them.

2 Completing the composition. You can select each shape (which is now a sepa-
rate object) and recolor the bowl, and you can even marquee-select all the ob-
jects and set the Stroke to None. To quickly place a background behind all 
objects, select the Draw Behind drawing mode, either by clicking its icon in 
the Tools panel, or by pressing Shift-D until you see the icon. Draw rectan-
gles for the background objects. (Steuer drew one rectangle filled with the 
Plaid 2 Pattern, and another with blue.)

Recoloring the bowl with the Grays swatch group; then choosing None for the ob-
jects’ stroke
3 Finishing touches on the bowl. Select one bowl object (you can only select one 
at a time), along with the Brush tool, and choose Draw Inside mode (Shift-D), 
which places dotted corners around the object. Deselect the object and load 
197

the Bristle Brush library. Choose a Bristle Brush and paint on the object; 
Draw Inside constrains your brush strokes within the selected object. When 
you want to paint another object, you must first exit Draw Inside mode 
(Shift-D, or double-click with a selection tool). Select the next object and 
choose Draw Inside again (you can even draw inside a pattern, like the bowl’s 
shadow). When Steuer was done, she wanted to crop the image for the demo 
she would output to PDF. The easiest way was to resize all the artboards by 
72% using the Premedia Systems WOW! Artboard Resizer. This script (also 
on WOW! ONLINE) resizes any or all artboards from the center.

between single and double-column. Check your drawing mode if your objects are not going 
where you intended.
LEAVENS
199

Overview: Create varying types of shading, texture, and detail within objects using 
Draw Inside mode; alter basic shapes and prepare them for masking using Shape 
Builder; add soft shading by using Blob Brush in conjunction with Draw Inside 
mode.
Building and shading complex artwork in Illustrator can be a daunting task. 
Thankfully, there are clipping masks. Chris Leavens employs a combination 
of construction methods in his artwork, “The Gardener,” including 
harnessing the artistic and organizational capabilities of both the Draw 
Inside mode (to quickly create clipping masks) and the Shape Builder tool (to 
combine objects).
1 Creating masks using Draw Inside, and beginning to add detail. Using the Pen 
tool, Leavens blocked in the composition by drawing basic, flat, colored 
forms. He then selected the large cliff object (which spans the width of the 
artwork’s background) and changed the drawing mode to Draw Inside (Shift-
D). Upon entering Draw Inside mode, he deselected by holding 
/Ctrl and 
clicking outside of the artboard and then added form-defining objects within 
the cliff object using the Pen tool. He freely plotted new anchor points out-
side the boundaries of the cliffs, allowing the mask created by Draw Inside 
mode to keep the edges clean and precise. After finishing the cliffs, Leavens 
repeated the same steps on the other objects, adding both shading and detail.

2 Preparing objects for Draw Inside mode with Shape Builder. To speed up the 
drawing process, Leavens used the Pen tool and drew the large, swooping 
tree in multiple pieces. In order to employ the same shading method he used 
for the other objects, he selected the various overlapping pieces of the tree. 
He then chose Shape Builder (Shift-M) and click-dragged over the overlap-
ping objects, quickly combining them into one large object, which he shaded 
using the method mentioned in step one.
Leavens used Shape Builder subtractively to create the cactus. To make the 
cactus look broken and parched, he used the Pen tool to draw jagged forms 
on top of a pair of the cactus’s branches. He then selected the cactus and the 
201

new, jagged shapes and switched back to the Shape Builder tool. While 
holding the Option/Alt key, Leavens click-dragged over the area he wanted to 
remove, leaving behind newly-broken branches.

branch
3 Adding fast shading with Blob Brush and Draw Inside mode. In order to add 
soft, feathered shading to the puffy purple foliage on the large tree, Leavens 
decided to use the Blob Brush. To maintain smooth strokes, he first double-
clicked the Blob Brush tool in the Tools panel, and in Options he increased 
the Fidelity and Smoothness settings (in CC there is only one Fidelity 
setting). He then predefined a graphic style for the shading by mixing a shade 
of violet using the Color panel, switching the blend mode to “Multiply” (by 
clicking Opacity in the Appearance panel), adding a 3-point feather effect 
(Effect> Stylize> Feather), and saving the style by clicking the New Graphic 
Style button in the Graphic Styles panel. To ensure that this style would be 
properly maintained once he selected and began working with it, he disabled 
“New Art Has Basic Appearance” from the Appearance panel menu. He se-
lected one of the purple foliage objects, changed to Draw Inside mode (Shift-
D), deselected, and chose the Blob Brush tool (Shift-B). Before adding the 
shading, he clicked on the newly defined Graphic Style swatch. Finally, Leav-
ens brushed in the shading, using the Blob Brush additively to build up larger 
masses of darker shading, painting solitary strokes where he wanted lighter 
shading, and using the Eraser tool to make corrections.

COGHILL
George Coghill
Cartoon logo and character artist George Coghill uses the Shape Builder 
tool to quickly add interior colors to his line art illustrations. In Illustrator, 
Coghill places a PSD sketch as a template layer and uses the Pen tool to 
trace the contours of each pencil-drawn outline with black-ﬁlled objects (as 
opposed to stroked paths). He then selects all the objects and uses the 
Shape Builder tool to ﬁll the main interior (white) areas with color. (If you 
create outlines using stroked or brushed paths, you’ll have to ﬁrst expand 
the paths into black-ﬁlled objects using Object> Path> Outline Path.)
204

Coghill creates a global color group for his illustration to allow him to later 
edit a swatch and have it update the art instantly (for help with global colors 
and color groups see the Color Transitions chapter). Double-clicking the 
Shape Builder tool icon to customize options, he chooses Color Swatches 
from the Pick Color From drop-down menu, enables Cursor Swatch Preview, 
and clicks OK. Coghill then selects all objects on that layer (
-A/Ctrl-A) and 
clicks on the new custom color group’s folder icon in the Swatches panel. 
Hovering the Shape Builder tool over the interior areas and using the left 
and right arrow keys, he cycles through the color swatches he created 
earlier in his custom color group and chooses a color for each area. The 
center color swatch preview under the cursor indicates which swatch is the 
current color. He clicks on the highlighted area to ﬁll it with the color and 
continues until he has colored all the interior areas. Because he used global 
colors, if he double-clicks a swatch and edits the color, when he clicks OK, 
every object ﬁlled with that swatch will also update.
205

ACOSTA
Ray Acosta
For a university-wide program developed to strengthen community, Ray 
Acosta created “Libertad” (Freedom) to illustrate how freedom also 
demands responsibility. It typiﬁes his workﬂow in which he sketches his idea 
for the monthly message in a notebook during project meetings, and later 
scans the sketch to place it in Illustrator as a template. Next he uses the 
Rectangle and Pen tools to quickly and loosely approximate his sketch on a 
new art layer. 
206

Using Live Rectangles, Live Corners, and Reshape Segment features, 
Acosta starts to push and pull his paths into objects that display an organic, 
carefree quality. While both Live Rectangles and Live Corners have panels 
that let artists use precise numeric input, Acosta prefers to round his corners 
for objects, such as the character’s face and the bill of the hat, using the on-
screen interactive widgets. With these he can directly manipulate the 
corners as he visually matches his sketch. He then uses the Reshape 
Segment feature (accessed when the Pen tool is active by holding down the 
Option/Alt key), to drag straight line segments into curves that closely align 
with his sketch. He applies color after his composition is complete, often 
using themes from the Kuler site. He adds many ﬁnishing touches, such as 
applying charcoal art brushes to strokes to add subtle texture to the vector 
edges of objects and hand-drawn type (details above), and creating 
background textures from Image Traced photos.

GORDON/CARTAGRAM, LLC
 Rounding a Corner
Using Live Corners to Create a Map Symbol
Overview: Create text and artwork; draw a rectangle to encompass the artwork; drag 
corner widgets or work in the Control or Transform panels to round and invert cor-
ners.
Steven Gordon uses a variety of geometric shapes to build map symbols. For 
this location map of Mont Belvieu, Texas, Gordon designed complex road 
symbols using Live Rectangles and Live Corners rather than using basic 
geometric shapes like ellipses and rectangles.
1 Creating a scalloped map symbol by changing the corner type. Gordon needed a 
junction map symbol with scalloped corners. He began by typing “JCT” and 
then drew a rectangle around it (which automatically opened the Transform 
panel). To create the scalloped corners using the Direct Selection tool, he 
pressed the Option/Alt key and clicked once on a corner widget to change its 
corner type to Inverted Round. Then, letting go of Option/Alt, Gordon 
dragged the widget inward to scallop the corners. Alternatively, you can 
change corner type by either clicking Corners in the Control panel, or via the 
pop-up Corner Type in the Transform panel that displays icons for Round, 
Inverted Round, and Chamfer corners.
208

Junction symbol displaying Inverted Round corners

Round icon selected from the Corner Type pop-up menu
2 Creating the basic artwork and text with a surrounding rectangle. For the toll road 
symbol, Gordon started by creating the artwork and text that would appear 
inside the rounded rectangle of the symbol’s frame. He drew the state border 
of Texas with the Pen tool and created two type objects (“99” and “TOLL”). 
He used the Scissors tool to cut a section of the border path, deleted it, then 
positioned the “99” in the empty space, partially inside the state. Then he 
centered “TOLL” with the other objects.
Corner on one tool
209

The Live Corner icons will show when you first make a rectangle with the 
Rectangle tool or select it with the Selection tool, but you can only convert 
corner points to other types using the Direct Selection tool.
After he finished creating and arranging the artwork, Gordon was ready to 
create the rounded rectangle that would serve as the map symbol’s frame. 
With the Rectangle tool he clicked and dragged until the rectangle was sized 
appropriately for the artwork he created previously.
2
Creating a Live Rectangle on top of the map symbol artwork
3 Rounding corners in the rectangular frame. After positioning the rectangle, 
Gordon rounded the bottom two corners to look more like an ellipse. To do 
this, he switched to the Direct Selection tool and selected the two anchor 
points at the bottom of the rectangle. With both points selected, he clicked 
one of the corner widgets and dragged inward, toward the center of the rec-
tangle. When he dragged far enough, the bottom of the rectangle collapsed 
into the shape of an ellipse. Gordon repeated this step for the top of the rec-
tangle; this time he dragged inward a short distance to gently round the cor-
ners.

On the left, the bottom two Live Corner widgets moved to round the bottom of the 
rectangle; on the right, the top two widgets moved to 
round the top of the rectangle
4 Changing individual corner radius values in the transform panel. Gordon needed 
another rectangle to provide a color-filled background behind “TOLL.” With 
the rectangle still selected, he copied and pasted the copy in front (it was 
above the original rectangle but below the border path and type) and filled it 
with blue. Next, in the Transform panel, he unlinked the Link Corner Radius 
default setting by clicking its icon. Then he reset the corner radius of both 
bottom corners to 0, which squared the bottom of the rectangle while leaving 
the top rounded. Selecting the bottom bounding box handle, he shortened 
the rectangle to surround “TOLL” by dragging the handle upward.
To finalize his map symbols he added drop shadows (see the Reshaping
Dimensions chapter for more on Live Effects), and then made each map 
symbol into an Illustrator symbol for easy reuse (see the Expressive Strokes 
chapter for details on creating and using symbols).

FERSTER
 Pencil & Pen Paths
Using Drawing Tools to Edit Paths
Overview: Draw freeform paths with the Pencil tool; switch to the Pen tool for 
straight line and Bézier curves; use modiﬁer keys to change tools and access Re-
shape Segment cursor for editing paths.
When illustrator and designer Gary Ferster needed to create a trade show 
menu for Intuit Inc., he decided to use a combination of Pencil and Pen tools, 
along with the Reshape Segment cursor.
1 Drawing with the Pencil (N) and Pen tool (P). Ferster decided to use the Pencil 
tool to start the top fins of the fish. Double-clicking the Pencil tool he adjust-
ed Fidelity and confirmed that the “Keep selected” and “Edit selected” op-
tions were enabled. With the Pencil tool he drew the left lobe of the top fin. 
To attach a jagged edge to his selected path, he pressed the P key to switch to 
the Pen tool and clicked on the last point of his pencil path. Watching his 
rubber-band preview, he clicked to create his first segment, continuing to 
click to place the next point until he’d formed the jagged edge. To draw the 
front edge of the fin, he pressed the N key to switch back to the Pencil tool 
and (starting from the last anchor point) drew the front downward section of 
the fin.

switch from drawing a freeform path to straight lines
2 Drawing (and reshaping) curves with the Pen tool. To draw the long curved arcs 
of the fish’s head, Ferster pressed the P key to switch to the Pen tool and 
drew the fish’s face using Bézier curves, holding Option/Alt to access the Re-
shape Segment cursor to adjust the arc as he worked. To complete his graphic 
he continued to move back and forth between the Pen and Pencil tools.

Pencil straight lines
Although drawing straight lines with the Pen tool is easier, now you can also 
draw polyline paths with the Pencil tool (see this chap-ter’s CC intro for more 
about this).

Laura Coyle
Atlanta illustrator Laura Coyle created this bottle as a design preview for a 
foil-stamped card ﬁlled with liquid and with a ﬂoating worm. For the 
background of the label, she drew four overlapping rectangles. Selecting 
the rectangles, she opened the Pathﬁnder panel. She Option/Alt-clicked the 
Unite icon to create a compound shape. Switching to the Direct Selection 
tool, Coyle selected a horizontal pair of points in the object. She pressed 
Option/Alt and clicked twice on one of the Live Corner widgets to cycle 
through the corner types until she got to the Chamfer. She dragged the 
Live Corner widget inward to change both corner types to Chamfer. She 
repeated this twice to create two more pairs of Chamfer corners.
214

To complete the object, Coyle opened the Appearance panel, ﬁlled the 
object with brown, and selected Add New Effect. She then gave the ﬁll an 
Inner Glow effect. Next, she created a second ﬁll with a line pattern and 
lightened its opacity. Finally, she added a thin stroke and chose an Outer 
Glow effect for the entire object. For the interior lines of the label, Coyle 
copied the object and pasted the copy in front of the original. After removing 
the copy’s ﬁlls and effects in the Appearance panel, she added two strokes. 
Coyle then used the Offset Path effect to move each stroke inward. (See the 
Reshaping Dimensions chapter for more about the Appearance panel.)

George Coghill
When employing a brush-and-ink style for a cartoon character illustration, 
artist George Coghill likes to enhance the organic look of his brush lines by 
using the new Path Segment Reshape feature. In order to be able to quickly 
access this feature while working with the Paintbrush tool, Coghill ﬁrst 
presses the A key to activate the Direct Selection tool (so it is the last used 
selection tool, accessed by 
/Ctrl key from other tools) and then presses 
the B key to activate the Paintbrush tool. This way, Coghill can quickly 
create a brushstroke with the Paint-brush tool using a Calligraphic brush, 
then temporarily activate the Direct Selection tool by pressing the 
/Ctrl key 
and clicking on the segment of a path to show the anchor points. Then he 
can hover his cursor over the brushed path he just created and ﬁne-tune his 
brushstroke with the Path Segment Reshape feature. As he works, he is able 
to make subtle adjustments along the way (see the Expressive Brushstrokes 
chapter for more on working with brushes).

INTRODUCTION
New features in Illustrator give the user more control over Strokes than ever before. 
You can manually adjust the contours of a path with the Width tool to emulate 
calligraphy, and save its form (profile) in the Stroke panel to apply to another path. 
You can specify precisely where the middle section of an art brush will stretch along a 
path, and where the ends (such as arrowheads) will be protected from distortion. You 
have control over how pattern brushes and dashed lines fit around corners. You can 
use “natural media” bristle brushes to make complex and painterly marks, emulating 
airbrush, pastel, and wet paint, and using traditional brush shapes like flat or fan. 
And symbols can be sprayed and manipulated using a special set of Symbolism tools.
WIDTH TOOL AND STROKE PROFILES
The Width tool (Shift-W) varies the width of strokes created with the drawing and 
geometric shape tools, or art and pattern brushes. The path doesn’t have to be 
selected; hover over it with the Width tool and the path will highlight, along with 
hollow diamonds indicating existing width points that were either set automatically, 
such as the end points of a path, or that you have set. As you move your cursor over 
the path, still hovering, a hollow diamond moves with your cursor, ready to become a 
width point at whatever location along the path you click on. You can modify paths 
between two existing width points, and can create either a flowing, continuous curve, 
or a discontinuous one with a sharp break between sections.
217

DONAL JOLLEY
Creating discontinuous curves from continuous curves with the 
Width tool when creating a ﬂag
If width points are spaced apart, the path gradually gets wider or narrower from one 
point to the next in a continuous curve. If width points are placed on top of each 
other, you create a sharp break between the two widths, causing the curve to abruptly 
widen or narrow, much like adding an arrowhead to the path. Modify strokes on 
either side of the path either by adjusting the stroke weight evenly along the path, or 
placing more weight on one side of the path than the other. Your custom stroke 
profile is temporarily stored in the Stroke panel, making it possible to apply the same 
stroke to as many paths in the document as you wish. An asterisk in the Appearance 
panel beside Stroke denotes a width profile. You can also save a custom profile as 
part of a Graphic Style and/or to the Profiles list using the Save icon at the bottom of 
the Stroke panel list. The Reset icon restores the default width profiles, replacing any 
custom profiles you’ve saved, so be careful about choosing to restore the default 
width profiles. You can modify width points in a variety of ways with the Width tool:
• To open the Width Point Edit dialog, double-click on a path or existing width point.
Numerically input the stroke weight for each side of the path, and/or choose to have 
adjoining width points adjusted at the same time.
• To interactively adjust the width point, click-drag on a handle to symmetrically adjust
the stroke width.
• To adjust one side of a stroke, press Option/Alt while dragging on a handle.
218

• To adjust or move multiple width points, Shift-click to select the points (not anchors)
you want to alter, then drag on one point or handle to adjust the others with it.
• To adjust or move all adjoining width points (up to the next corner anchor point), hold
Shift while dragging.
• To copy selected points, hold Option/Alt as you drag.
• To delete a selected width point, press the Delete key.
• To deselect a width point, click on an empty space away from the path, or press the
Esc key.

(not shown) width points on a pattern brush-
stroke, releasing Shift, then moving them all

Save those width profiles
The Reset icon in the Strokes panel deletes all custom width profiles and restores the 
default profiles. To first save your width profiles, apply them to an object, then save 
that object’s Graphic Style in the Graphic Styles panel.
To numerically adjust one or more selected width points, double-
click on one to open the dialog and make ad-
justments; select just one point before enter-
ing the dialog if you want to enable Adjust 
Adjoining Width Points

Width points vs. anchor points
It’s difficult to distinguish between the shape of Width points and normal points. 
You’ll see the cursor change when you hover over a Width point, and a tool tip for 
other points displays “anchor.”

THE EXPANDED STROKE PANEL
The Stroke panel controls settings for the many different types of strokes, from how 
they align to the path of an object to how they join at corners. Dashed lines, end caps, 
and arrowheads all are part of the Stroke panel, as well as stored width profiles, from 
a normal even width to a fully calligraphic profile. Here you can also customize and 
save your carefully crafted stroke profiles after creating a variable-width stroke, and 
preview how your path joins to an arrowhead. Adjust the way dashes follow a path, 
and scale arrowheads to suit.
220

With the Stroke panel width proﬁles list, save or delete one custom 
width proﬁle at a time (resetting defaults re-
moves all custom width proﬁles)
Making ends meet
Sometimes stroked lines seem to match up perfectly when viewed in Outline mode, 
but they visibly overlap in Preview mode. You can solve this problem by selecting one 
of the three end cap styles in the Strokes panel. The default Butt cap causes your path 
to stop at the end anchor point and is essential for creating exact placement of one 
path against another. The Round cap is especially good for softening the effect of 
single line segments. The Projecting cap extends lines and dashes at half the stroke 
weight beyond the end anchor point. Cap styles also affect the shape of dashed lines.
Corners have joins that serve a similar purpose to end caps. The Join style in the 
Stroke panel determines the shape of a stroke at its corner points; the inside of the 
corner is always angled. The default Miter join creates a pointy corner, with the 
length of the point determined by the width of the stroke, the angle of the corner 
(narrow angles create longer points), and the Miter limit setting on the Stroke panel. 
The default Miter join (with a miter limit of 10x) usually looks fine, but can range 
from 1x (which is always blunt) to 500x. The Round join creates a rounded outside 
corner with a radius of half the stroke width. The Bevel join creates a squared-off 
outside corner, equivalent to a Miter join with the miter limit set to 1x.

with a Miter join, Round join, and Bevel join 
221

Dashes behave like short lines, and therefore have both end caps and, potentially, 
corner joins. End caps work with dashes exactly as they do with the ends of paths—
each dash is treated as a very short path. However, if a dashed path goes around the 
corner, it can make that turn in one of two ways: The spacing between the dashes can 
be precise and constant, so the dash won’t necessarily bend around a corner, or even 
reach to it, or you can click the “Aligns dashes to corners and path ends, adjusting 
lengths to fit” icon. Dashes won’t be precisely spaced, but will look tidy at the 
corners. The command affects dash spacing for other shapes, from circles to stars, as 
well.

the default option in the Stroke panel pre-
serves dash size but are unevenly distributed 
around the frame; (bottom) changing the op-
tion to Align to corners dash size varies the 
size of dashes but evens spacing
222

One more “end” to a path is an arrowhead, and the Stroke panel now offers a choice 
of both the types of arrowheads and how they are affixed to the ends of the paths. 
Click on the Arrowheads pop-up list to choose to attach an arrow or feather to the 
start or end of the path. You can then scale it proportionally or disproportionally, 
reverse the start and end, or align the arrowhead so that either the tip or the end of 
the arrow meets the end of the path. To remove an arrowhead (or feather), choose 
None from the list. You can add custom arrowheads to the list without removing any 
of the default arrowheads (you’d have to reinstall Illustrator to make them available 
again if you removed them). Both dash alignment options and arrowheads can be 
modified again at any time.
Deleting arrowhead presets
To make custom arrowheads, be sure to modify only the file holding the default 
presets. If you delete any arrowheads in that file, you’ll have to reinstall Illustrator to 
get them back again.
Creating custom arrowheads
Illustrator Help provides directions for locating the Arrowheads file on your computer. 
The file contains instructions for customizing and saving arrowheads without over-
writing the original file.

rowhead so the tail of the arrowhead joins

or to align the arrowhead so the tip of the 
arrowhead joins the end of the path (right)
223

BRUSHES
Illustrator’s calligraphic, art, scatter, bristle, and pattern brushes can mimic traditional art tools, 
create photorealistic imagery, or provide pattern and texture to your art. You can either create 
brushstrokes with the Paintbrush tool, or you can apply a brush to a previously drawn path.
Calligraphic brushes create strokes that mimic real-world calligraphy pens, brushes, or felt pens. 
You can define a degree of variation for the size, roundness, and angle of each “nib.” You can also 
set each of these attributes to respond to a graphics tablet and stylus (like the Wacom) with a 
variety of different pen characteristics (with a mouse, you can only use Fixed or Random).
Art brushes consist of one or more pieces of artwork that get fitted to the path you create with 
them. You can use art brushes to imitate traditional painting media, such as drippy ink pens, 
textured charcoal, spatter brushes, dry brushes, watercolors, and more. Or an art brush can 
represent real-world objects, such as a petal, a leaf, or a ribbon, a flower, decorative flourish, or 
train. You can modify art brushes and their strokes using a number of different parameters, 
including variables affected by pressure using a Wacom tablet and stylus). Art brush marks can 
be made to scale proportionately to fit the length of your path, or stretched to fit. You can also 
scale your brush non-proportionally by restricting the area of the art brush that can stretch, 
using two guides to create a segmented brush (choose Stretch Between Guides for the Scale 
option). Either or both ends of the brush are then protected from being stretched, and the middle 
portion is stretched to fill in the remaining length. This allows you to stretch the stem of a rose, 
for instance, without stretching the blossom itself. You can further modify an art brush with 
colorization methods, such as choosing to vary a key color by tint or hue. Modify the way the art 
brush follows a path by flipping its direction, and use the Overlap option to determine whether or 
not to allow it to overlap itself when turning a corner. You can also use the Width tool to modify 
an art brush.
Using the Width tool to alter an art brushstroke modiﬁed by Stretch 
Between Guides option
Use scatter brushes to scatter copies of artwork along the path you create with them: 
flowers in a field, bees in the air, stars in the sky. The size of the objects, their 
spacing, how far they scatter from the path, and their rotation can be set to a Fixed or 
Random amount or, with a graphics tablet, can vary according to characteristics such 
as pressure or tilt. You can also align the rotation of the scattered objects to the 
direction of the path, or to the edges of the page. Change the method of colorization 
as you would with a calligraphic or pattern brush.
224

The Scatter Brush dialog varies how the artwork is scattered along 
a path
Use pattern brushes to paint patterns along a path. To use a pattern brush, first 
define the tiles that will make up your pattern. For example, a train has several parts
—engine, cars, etc. Each of these constitutes a tile where you have the start, the 
middle (the side tile), tiles that turn either an inside or outside corner, and the end of 
the path. You can either use an existing pattern swatch or Option-drag/Alt-drag art 
from the artboard into any tile’s position in an existing brush (see the CC section 
later in this chapter for info on CC’s auto-corners). In the Pattern Brush Options 
dialog, select a tile, then click on the swatch name below the tiles that you want 
assigned to that tile. You can customize settings for how the tiles fit to, or flip along, 
the path, and to alter their color. You can also vary the appearance of the pattern 
brush, how it fills sharp angles (by altering the Scale in both Fixed parameters and 
those affected by tablet features), and the spacing between tiles.
225

Altering Pattern Scale and Spacing to create a very different look 
to the brush
Bristle brushes emulate traditional paint brushes, showing both the texture of the 
bristles and the tip shape, which can be round, flat, fan-shaped, etc. To create a 
bristle brush, select it as the New brush type and, in the Bristle Brush Options dialog, 
choose a tip shape. From there, modify the brush’s bristle length, density, and 
thickness; whether or not the bristles are stiff or soft; and how opaquely it applies the 
paint. By default, these brushes use a Paint Opacity of less than 100%, so you’ll see 
some opacity in your strokes even when you have set Opacity in the Control panel to 
100% opaque. Because calculating transparency for printing often takes a long time, 
a dialog warns that if you have more than 30 bristle brushstrokes, you may want to 
select some or all of the bristle brushstrokes and choose Object> Rasterize to set 
raster settings for them before you attempt to print.
Draw inside and bristle brushes
Bristle brushes are a good candidate for the Draw Inside mode (see the Rethinking
Construction chapter). You can add the bristle texture to a vector shape while 
retaining some or all of the original color; Draw Inside also constrains the strokes 
inside the object, ensuring stray bristle marks are automatically masked.

Bristle brush opacity
Set bristle brush opacity:
• In bristle brush Options under Paint Opacity
• With the Paintbrush tool active, the 1–0 keys change the opacity for selected
strokes, or, with no strokes selected, the setting affects the next brushstroke
• With the Opacity slider in the Appearance or Control panels
Working with brushes
Most brushes follow these rules (for new and additional CC functions, see the CC 
section later in this chapter):
• To create art, scatter, and pattern brushes, create the artwork for them from fairly basic
artwork, including compound shapes, blends, groups, and some live effects such as 
Distort & Transform or Warp. You can’t create brushes from art that uses gradients, 
mesh objects, raster art, and advanced live effects such as Drop Shadow or 3D.
• To modify the art that makes up a brush, drag it out of the Brushes panel, edit the
object, then drag it back into the Brushes panel. Use the Option/Alt key as you drag 
to replace the original art with the new art.
• To set application-level preferences for all brushes, double-click the Paintbrush tool.
(The new preferences will apply to work you do with the brushes going forward, but 
won’t change existing work.)
227

• To modify the properties of a single brushstroke, select it, then choose Options of
Selected Object in the Brush panel’s menu. If you’ve used the Width tool to modify 
the stroke, your options include using the width points to calculate the profile for 
your next strokes.
• To choose how to apply modiﬁcations to existing brushstrokes, in the brush’s Options
dialog choose Leave Strokes to create a duplicate brush, or Apply to Strokes to 
modify every use of the brush in the document.
• When Keep Selected and Edit Selected Paths are both enabled, the last drawn path stays
selected; drawing a new path close to the selected path will redraw that path. 
Disabling either of these options will allow you to draw multiple brushstrokes near 
each other, instead of redrawing the last drawn path.
If you’ve modiﬁed a brushed path using the Width tool or by as-
signing a proﬁle, you can make global ad-
justments by choosing Options of Selected 
Object from the Brushes panel menu
SYMBOLS
Working with symbols in Illustrator saves file size (since objects converted to 
symbols aren’t duplicated in the file), provides consistency whenever the same 
artwork needs to be used more than once, and makes it easy to update objects in your 
artwork simply by editing the symbol to change it wherever it has been used. 
Symbols can be made from almost any art you create in Illustrator. The only 
exceptions are a few kinds of complex groups, such as groups of graphs, and placed 
art (which must be embedded, not linked). Symbols are edited and stored using the 
Symbols and Control panels, and are manipulated like other objects, or with the 
Symbolism tools:
• To store selected artwork as a symbol, drag it into the Symbols panel (or click on the
New Symbol icon in the panel). Use the Libraries Menu icon to save the current  
symbols to a new library, or to load other libraries.
228

• To add a single instance of a symbol to your document, drag it into your document or,
with it selected, click on the Place Symbol Instance icon. Drag a symbol instance into 
your document as often as you like, but you can only use the Place Symbol Instance 
icon once. It’s most useful for modifying the symbol (see following).
• To modify a symbol without modifying the original symbol in the Symbols panel, click
either the Break Link button in the Control panel or the “Break Link to Symbol” icon 
in the Symbols panel.
• To modify a symbol and all instances of it already in the document, place or drag it
into your document, then click on the Edit Symbol button in the Control panel; your 
symbol will be placed in isolation mode. After you modify the symbol and exit 
isolation mode, all instances of the symbol, including the symbol in the Symbols 
panel, will be updated.
• To modify a symbol in the Symbols panel when you have already broken the link, Option/
Alt-drag the modified symbol from your artboard on top of the symbol in the 
Symbols panel. This will replace the original symbol with the modified artwork and 
update all instances of the original symbol.
• To restore a symbol to its original size and orientation after transforming it on the
artboard, click the Reset button in the Control panel.
• To quickly ﬁnd all instances of a symbol in your artwork, select the symbol either in
the Symbols panel or in your artwork and choose Select All Instances from the 
Symbol panel’s menu.
• To replace one symbol with another without opening the Symbols panel, select the symbol
in the artwork and click on the Replace list arrow in the Control panel. A miniature 
Symbols panel opens, which allows you to swap out symbols.
• To add a sublayer to a symbol’s artwork, in isolation mode click on the topmost layer
with the symbol’s name, and then click on the New Sublayer icon. (You can’t add 
sublayers to a <Group> or <path>.)
• To add a new layer above a group or path sublayer at the same hierarchy level, target the
layer, then Option-click/Alt-click on the New Layer icon. If the layer remains a 
normal layer (not a group or a path), you can continue to add new layers at that level 
merely by clicking on the New Layer icon.

libraries, editing commands, and the Symbol Options dialog 
229

Transforming symbols
When creating symbols, Illustrator has two features that are important whenever a 
symbol might be scaled or transformed any other way: If you use Flash, these 
features also affect symbols taken into Flash for animating:
• Apply 9-slice scaling to symbols in Illustrator. Doing so reduces distortion when
transforming objects, especially noticeable with elements such as buttons that have 
custom corners. All nine areas of the symbol can be scaled independently.
• Assign a Registration point to the symbol in Illustrator. The point appears as a
crosshair both in Symbol Edit Mode and when the symbol is selected in normal 
mode. Use the Registration point to affect any transformations applied inside 
Illustrator.
Quick access to Symbol features on the Control panel when a sym-
bol object is selected in the artwork; the Re-
set button not grayed out indicates the sym-
bol has been transformed and the Replace 
pop-up gives immediate access to the loaded 
Symbols library
Adding a new layer at the same level as a path 
sublayer by Option-clicking/Alt-clicking on the 
Create New Lay-er icon
230

Working with the Symbolism tools
There are eight different Symbolism tools. Use the Symbol Sprayer tool to spray 
selected symbols onto your document, creating a symbol set. You can’t select 
individual instances inside a set with any of the selection tools. Instead, modify them 
with any of the other Symbol tools. To access the symbolism tools easily, tear off the 
panel and float it nearby, or if working in Illustrator CC, create a custom Tools panel 
that reveals all of the Symbolism tools as well as any others you need for your project 
(see the CC introduction to Your Creative Workspace for instructions). Add symbols to 
a selected set by selecting a symbol in the Symbols panel—the symbol can be the 
same as or different from the symbols already present in the instance set—and spray. 
To add or modify symbols in a set, make sure you’ve selected both the set and the 
corresponding symbol(s) in the Symbols panel that you want to affect. The 
Symbolism tools will only affect those symbols in a selected set that are also selected 
in the Symbols panel, thus making it easy to modify just one of the symbols in a 
mixed set.
To adjust the properties of the Symbolism tools, double-click on one to open 
Symbolism Tools Options. Vary the diameter (the range over which the tool 
operates), the rate at which it applies a change, and the density with which it 
operates on a set. If you’re using the default Average mode, your new symbol 
instances can inherit attributes (size, rotation, transparency, style) from nearby 
symbols in the same instance set. For example, if nearby symbols are 50% opaque, 
symbols added to the set will also be 50% opaque. You can also change the default 
Average mode to User Defined or Random. (See Illustrator Help for more 
information about choosing User Defined.)
To remove symbols from an existing instance set, you can remove one instance at a 
time by holding the Option/Alt key and clicking. To remove multiple instances with 
the Symbol Sprayer tool, click and drag your cursor over the ones you want to 
remove—they’ll be deleted when you lift your cursor.

Symbols vs. scatter brushes
Scatter brushes and symbols can appear very similar on your art-board, but they’re 
each applied and edited very, very differently. You can read about both in this 
introduction, but you should experiment with making the same art into a scatter 
brush and a symbol, and see how differently you control and edit each so you can 
better understand their advantages and disadvantages.

RELATED TIPS
Different strokes
Marks made with the Blob Brush tool begin as a stroke, but automatically turn into a 
filled shape. Find details on using it in the Rethinking Construction chapter. For the 
basics of applying gradients to strokes, see the introduction to the Color Transitions 
chapter. You’ll also find lessons and galleries that incorporate gradients on strokes 
throughout the book.
Graphics tablets & brushes
Bristle brushes, which mimic painter’s brushes, respond to hand gestures when 
using a tablet and pen, such as the Wacom. The “Wacom 6D Art” or “Art” pens also 
easily retain the appearance of the individual bristles, while allowing full rotation to 
create unique strokes that imitate real brushes. A mouse is much more limited.
 RASTER BRUSHES AND AUTO-CORNERS IN CC
233

Image brushes
Art, pattern, and scatter brushes have been supercharged. Finally you can use 
embedded raster artwork in the brushes you create, and you can mix raster with 
vector in the same brush. You’ll find several examples of raster brush art in this 
chapter, but keep in mind the following points when creating brushes from raster 
artwork:
• Limit the size (in pixels) for pattern and art brushes to approximately one megapixel
(see Tip “How big is a megapixel”), though scatter brushes can be any size, although 
performance can slow down. Because the brush’s redraw performance lags with 
larger brushes, Illustrator will offer to “optimize” (down sample) any single raster 
object (the copy it uses, not the original) that exceeds that limit. Illustrator can’t 
downsample multiple objects, and may not be able to downsample very large images, 
either. You’ll see a warning to resize the artwork before creating the brush, at which 
point you can choose Object> Rasterize to downsample your image. Illustrator 
downsamples the image to match the size of the image on the artboard at the 
resolution you choose in the dialog. It may be enough simply to scale the image 
before rasterizing, or it might also require rasterizing at a lower resolution, 
depending upon the size you’re starting with.
How big is a megapixel?
A megapixel is roughly one million pixels. Multiply W × H in pixels to get the total 
area. A filled rectangle 1024 × 1024 px is the maximum usable size, but can 
sometimes be larger if the artwork boundaries contains fully transparent pixels.
• To maintain the quality of your artwork, create the brush as close to the size you need
as possible. Brushes from raster artwork are pixel based, not vector, even if they 
include vector in them, and will degrade if significantly scaled. To ensure that you 
can access the original artwork, or to re-rasterize it at another resolution, it’s best to 
always rasterize a copy of your object.
• Distortion affects rasters, and if you bend pixels along a path, as is common with art
brushes, the artwork has to be interpolated. Some distortion can be too extreme for 
Illustrator to fill in the gaps. There’s a significant difference between choosing 
Stretch to Fit and Scale Proportionally with art brushes, so experiment to get the 
results you want when working with images in your brushes.
• With a pattern brush, if your art isn’t oriented properly to the path, you must rotate it
first on the artboard. You should note that although you can change the orientation 
of your artwork in the Art Brush Options dialog, Illustrator doesn’t always rotate 
large or complex raster art correctly. To avoid difficulty, rotate the artwork on the 
art-board before attempting to create the brush.
• Raster portions of brushes can’t be colorized. Changing the Colorization settings in the
Brush Options dialog won’t have any effect on the raster portions of your brush, only 
vector elements (see Sharon Steuer’s “shell” gallery later in this section for an 
example of this).
Edit automatic corner tiles
When you drag a brush from the Brushes panel onto the artboard, the artwork is 
expanded into a group of vectors, each tile within its own sub-group. Some of the 
expanded tiles contain an outer unfilled/unstroked bounding rectangle. In order for 
an edited tile to correctly replace an original, you must retain the size of the tile 
you’re replacing, including (if it has one) its bounding rectangle.
Embedded images for brushes
In order to make a linked image into a raster brush, click Embed in your Control 
panel.

New tile order in Brush dialog
The CC Pattern Brush Options dialog displays a new order of tiles.
Corner tiles for pattern brushes
Corner tiles have been a stumbling block for many of us when we create pattern brushes. 
Illustrator CC has partially addressed the problem by providing auto-generated corner tiles. 
Whenever you create a side tile for a pattern brush, you can click on the down arrow beside 
an inner or outer corner tile field and choose from four tiles that Illustrator generates: 
Auto-Centered, Auto-Between, Auto-Sliced, and Auto-Overlap.
Plus, if you like an auto-generated corner, you can reuse it as a corner for another pattern 
by dragging it out of one brush and into another (see the “Hearts” example Steuer Hearts). 
See Lisa Jackmore’s “Castle Brush” in the CC gallery section later in this chapter to learn 
how to extract a corner for use with another brush.
When one of these auto-generated corners works for the brush, you don’t have to do 
anything more than choose it for your corner(s), but if it isn’t quite right, you still either edit 
the corner or create a corner from scratch. You can also simply try eliminating the corners, 
rounding the path instead (see Sharon Steuer’s “Paper Dolls” in the CC gallery section later 
in this chapter). You can find more examples of rasters in brushes, as well as more about 
auto-corners, in the lessons and galleries both in the CC section at the end of this chapter 
and in the CC section at the end of the Mastering Complexity chapter.
SHARON STEUER (from her “Artistic Painting with Illustrator”course on 
lynda.com)
In this example from Sharon Steuer’s “Artistic Painting with Illus-
trator” course on lynda.com, she liked the 
auto corner generated by her heart pattern 
(top) better than the auto-corner generated 
by the “ﬁxed” heart pattern (middle); for the 
ﬁnal she manually replaced the “ﬁxed” auto-
corner with the one generated by the original 
(see Lisa Jackmore’s “Castle Brush” gallery 
later in this chapter for details on how to do 
this)

More brushes not patterns...
You can access more brushes via the Brushes panel’s Brush Libraries menu, but if 
you open Patterns from your Swatch library, your Pattern Brush Options tiles will fill 
with patterns that won’t work as brushes! To clear excess patterns, quit and restart

JOLLEY
Donal Jolley
This sampler by Donal Jolley, using his 6D Art Pen, demonstrates the tremendous 
variety you get from brushes that ship with Illustrator. When you add a Wacom 
pressure-sensitive pen and tablet to these out-of-the-box brushes, you can 
introduce even more variety into your strokes; the standard Grip Pen registers 
pressure, tilt, and bearing, and the optional, more sensitive Art Pens (6D Art for 
Intuos3, or Art Pen for Intuos4) add the ability to vary each stroke with rotation. The 
bristle brush responds particularly well to the Art Pens, adding a new dimension to 
painting. You can manually transform some of your strokes (but not those made with 
the calligraphic, scatter, or bristle brushes), by modifying its proﬁle with the Width 
tool (such as Spikey above), and then saving that proﬁle to apply to other strokes.

PUTNAM
Stroke Variance
Creating Dynamic Variable-Width Strokes
Overview: Place sketch and trace with Pen tool; modify strokes with Width tool; save width 
proﬁle and apply to other strokes.
Ryan Putnam creates many character illustrations for websites, branding projects, 
and more. Putnam now uses the Width tool to add depth and variance in the strokes 
of the illustrations. Using the Profile feature in the Stroke panel, he can save his 
custom stroke modifications to apply to other paths in current and future projects.
1 Placing a sketch template and tracing with Pen tool. Putnam first created a character 
sketch in Photoshop, chose File> Place in Illustrator, enabled Template, and clicked 
OK. Putnam then traced basic paths of the sketch with the Pen tool in the layer 
above.

2 Adjusting strokes with the Width tool. Putnam wanted his strokes to have some vari-
ance compared to the uniform strokes created by the Pen tool. He created two dis-
tinct stroke widths to use on the majority of the paths in the illustration. For the first 
stroke adjustment, Putnam created a stroke with a thicker middle and tapered ends. 
To do this, he used the Width tool to click in the middle of the desired path and drag 
a width point to the desired width. For the second custom width, Putnam created a 
stroke with a thicker end and a tapered end. Again, he used the Width tool, but this 
time clicked on the far right side of the desired path and dragged a width point to the 
desired width.
If you like to be precise with your adjustments, you can double-click a width point to 
open the Width Point Edit dialog, allowing you to numerically adjust the width of the 
stroke in the Side 1, Side 2, and Total Width fields.

3 Saving stroke proﬁles and applying to other paths. Instead of adjusting every path in the 
illustration to match the two custom widths he created with the Width tool, Putnam 
saved time and ensured consistency by saving his two custom stroke profiles. To save 
each profile, he selected the modified stroke and clicked the Add to Profiles icon in 
the Stroke panel. With both of his strokes saved as custom profiles, Putnam could se-
lect a uniform stroke, click the saved Variable Width Profile at the bottom of the 
Stroke panel, and select the saved profile from the drop-down list. These custom pro-
files will then be available in other new Illustrator files.
240

After Putnam applied the custom profile to all the desired paths, he utilized specific 
keyboard commands with the Width tool to further adjust individual paths. For 
example, holding down the Option/Alt key when dragging width points creates non-
uniform widths, the Delete key deletes selected width points, and holding the Shift 
key while dragging adjusts multiple width points. Other keyboard modifiers with the 
Width tool include holding down Option/Alt while dragging a width point to copy the 
width point, holding down Option-Shift/Alt-Shift while dragging to copy and move 
all the points along a path, Shift-clicking to select multiple width points, and using 
the Esc key to deselect a width point.

MCKIBILLO
MCKIBILLO (AKA Josh McKible)
For a commissioned piece on different management styles, MCKIBILLO used the 
parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant as the basis for his illustration. He began 
with a sketch created in Alias SketchBook Pro that he traced in Illustrator using the 
Pen tool. While the image was in progress, he used a ﬁne, uniform line, bright 
Magenta so it wouldn’t visually disappear.
243

When it came to ﬁnessing his linework, MCKIBILLO frequently applied a couple of 
the default width proﬁles from the Proﬁle pop-up in the Stroke panel to create many 
of the lines. If he needed even more control over the shape of his strokes, however, 
he used the Width tool to modify both width and anchor placement along a curve. In 
this illustration, he manually delineated the hands and ﬁngernails with the Width 
tool. Most of his strokes used a rounded cap, but he occasionally varied the cap 
according to the way the lines joined. Using the Width tool, and then saving and 
reusing proﬁles (from Proﬁle in the Stroke panel), MCKIBILLO was able to quickly 
develop a style that appears completely hand-drawn, yet has the advantage of 
remaining easily edited throughout the course of a project.
JOLLEY
244

Donal Jolley
To create his “Rubber Ducky,” Donal Jolley began by drawing the basic lines with 
the Pencil tool. Then with the Width tool, he adjusted each stroke so it curved gently 
and came to a sharp angle at the end (his custom proﬁles are shown below). To 
ﬁnalize the line work, he used the Scissors and Eraser tools to clean up the extra 
anchor points that sometimes occur at the end of brushstrokes. He then locked his 
line work layer and created a new layer at the bottom, into which he painted the 
colors. He works very intuitively with the brushes, saying, “Usually I will open a 
brush category, choose a brush, and then make a stroke with a sharp angle and a 
gentle curve to see how it behaves with the color I want to use. Because many of 
the strokes have a certain transparent quality that does not truly mix with the 
underlying color (or white), I make sure of the stroke before I employ it. I check for 
opacity, form, and how it ‘bends,’ because many brushes tend to give 
unpredictable results at sharper angles.” Then, using his chosen default bristle and 
calligraphic brushes, Jolley painted the ducky’s colors, varying pressure and angles 
with his Wacom Intuos tablet and 6D Art Pen.
245

JACKMORE
Lisa Jackmore
For drawings as ﬂuid as this ﬂoral design, Lisa Jackmore ﬁnds that initially drawing 
with the Paintbrush tool and a calligraphic brush is the most natural and intuitive 
way to begin. However, when she wants to create speciﬁc variations to the strokes, 
she then converts the brushstrokes to Basic stroked paths, so she can use the 
Width tool (you can’t use the Width tool on calligraphic brushstrokes). To do this, 
she clicked on the Basic Brush in the Brushes panel (Basic Stroke Version). 
Jackmore then selected the Width tool (Shift-W) and clicked on the stroke itself, 
dragging the handle outwards to evenly widen the path. To make adjustments to 
one side, she held the Option/Alt key while dragging the handle. To make even 
further variations to the strokes, Jackmore clicked on the stroke, added new width 
points, and adjusted them. She saved several proﬁles by selecting each modiﬁed 
stroke, then from the Variable Width Proﬁle menu in the Control panel, clicking on 
the Add to Proﬁle button, naming it, and clicking OK. To ﬁnish the design, she 
selected each of the remaining paths, applied one of her saved width proﬁles from 
the Control panel, and then increased the stroke weight on all of the paths. 
Jackmore’s background includes a gradient mesh object and a few bristle brush-
strokes drawn with the Paintbrush tool.

PAIDRICK
Ann Paidrick
For Ann Paidrick, the Width tool was key to creating the hand-drawn look for this 
pair of spiral patterns. Starting with the Spiral tool (hidden under the Line tool), she 
used the up and down arrow keys to vary the wind of each spiral as she drew. To 
begin with she chose an orange ﬁll and black stroke. Clicking Stroke in the Control 
panel, she chose the Round Cap, and for each spiral she set a stroke weight 
between 5 and 8 pts. Next she used the Width tool on each spiral to thicken some 
areas while narrowing others. For ﬁnal tweaks to the paths, she used the Direct 
Selection tool to move anchor points and direction lines just enough to create a 
hand-drawn feel.
247

After assembling a cluster of spirals together, she entered Pattern Edit Mode (PEM), 
where she ﬁnished arranging the elements until the pattern worked as a whole. After 
saving the orange and black pattern, she remained in PEM, where she created and 
then saved the version at top by changing spiral ﬁll and stroke colors, and putting a 
rectangle with a purple ﬁll beneath the spirals (for more about PEM see the 
Mastering Complexity chapter).
248

JACKMORE
Lisa Jackmore
To make interesting brushstrokes, Lisa Jackmore used variations of a few 
calligraphic and bristle brushes, painted using a Wacom Intuos4 tablet and Art Pen. 
In creating the variations for the brushes, Jackmore changed the parameters for 
Pressure, Rotation, and Tilt. When she wanted to customize a brush, she double-
clicked the brush, and made changes to the options. For the tree outline, she used 
a 3-pt Flat calligraphic brush, set the Diameter to Pressure (with a 2-pt variation), 
Roundness to Tilt (34°, with a variation of 15°), and set the Angle to Rotation (with a 
125° variation). For the long sweeping lines of the tree, she found the combination 
of using Rotation and a chisel tip of the Art Pen worked the best to vary the 
brushstroke. As she drew, she slightly rotated and tilted the pen and created 
variations in her stroke. To create an irregular ink-like appearance in the words, she 
used a 1-pt Round calligraphic brush, and set the Angle to 30° (ﬁxed), Roundness 
to Tilt (60°, with a 29% variation). Jackmore used several other variations of 
calligraphic brushes to draw the suitcases and background pattern. To make the 
pattern, she drew several paths with a customized calligraphic brush, grouped the 
brushstrokes, and dragged the pattern tile to the Swatches panel. After she drew all 
of the black brushstrokes, she colored the illustration with a gradient mesh object 
for the background, and used variations of the Fan, Round Blunt, and Round Point 
bristle brushes for other areas, such as the bird, suitcases, and shadows. Finally, 
Jackmore used the Rectangle tool to make a frame, then applied a Charcoal brush 
to the stroke.

AHUJA
Anil Ahuja/Adobe Systems
Adobe’s Product Specialist Anil Ahuja used a range of tools and techniques to 
create his dragonﬂy, and relied upon transparency methods to obtain color 
accuracy to closely match his reference photo. In his three levels of objects used to 
create the wings (Creating Wings), this is readily apparent. After drawing the wing’s 
black-stroked vein structure with artistic calligraphic brushes of various sizes and 
shapes, he selected the paths and chose Object> Expand (to outline the strokes), 
then Merge (to create a compound path object). In the Appearance panel he 
clicked Opacity, and changed the Blending Mode to Darken to reduce the opacity, 
giving the wing its realistic brown color. With the brown and blue gradient mesh 
objects (residing on a layer beneath the vein structure), Ahuja used the Direct 
Selection tool to select individual mesh points to decrease the opacity (ranging from 
0–90%). To make the wings appear translucent instead of just transparent, Ahuja 
used the Pen tool to draw an outline copy of the wings which he put on a layer 
below the veined structure and the mesh. He ﬁlled the outline with a color similar to 
the background and reduced the opacity to 30%. To complete the illustration, Ahuja 
created a shadow on a layer between the dragonﬂy and the gradient mesh 
background. To make the shadow, he pasted a copy of the wing outline and with 
the Pen tool added an outline of the body. He then reduced the opacity of the 
shadow object to 53% and changed the Blending Mode to Darken.

STEUER
Brushes & Washes
Drawing with Naturalistic Pen, Ink, Wash
Overview: Start with a placed image as a template; create a custom calli-graphic brush; create 
variations on the brush to apply to strokes; add a wash layer below the ink layer.
It’s easy to create spontaneous painterly and calligraphic marks in Illustrator—
perhaps with more flexibility than in many pixel-based programs. Sharon Steuer 
drew this sketch of Honfleur, France, using a Wacom tablet, her Art Pen for the 
Intuos4, and two different Illustrator brushes. She customized a brush for the thin, 
dark strokes and used a built-in brush for the underlying gray washes.
1 Placing artwork as a template. If you want to use a sketch or photo as a reference as 
you draw into layers above, set it up as a non-printing template layer. For her tem-
plate image, Steuer scanned a small photo of Honfleur and saved it as a JPG, then 
opened it in Illustrator. To place an image as a template, choose File> Place, enable 
the Template option, and click the Place button. If the image imports at too large a 
size, unlock the layer, select the image (holding down Option-Shift/Alt-Shift keys to 
resize proportionally from the center), and drag on a corner of the bounding box un-
til the image is the size you want, then lock the layer again. Illustrator automatically 
dims images on your template layer to 50%, but you can double-click the layer icon 
to adjust this and other settings in Layer Options. Toggle between hiding and show-
ing the template layer using 
-Shift-W/Ctrl-Shift-W, or toggle the visibility icon in 
the Layers panel.
2 Customizing a calligraphic brush. In order to sketch with accurate detail, you’ll need 
to adjust the Paintbrush Tool Options by double-clicking the Paintbrush tool icon. In 
Options, drag Fidelity (accuracy) and Smoothness sliders all the way to the left for 
maximum control (in CC you adjust just one Fidelity slider to Accurate). Disable “Fill 
new brush strokes,” and if you want to be able to quickly draw strokes that overlap, 
disable Keep Selected.
251

2
Customizing Paintbrush Tool Options (in CC set one Fidelity slider 
to Accurate)
To create a custom calligraphic brush, click the New Brush icon and select 
Calligraphic Brush. For this piece, Steuer chose the following settings: Angle=90°/
Fixed; Roundness=10%/Fixed; Diameter=4 pt/Pressure/Variation=4 pt. If you have 
one of the newer Wacom Art Pens, try varying the Diameter with Rotation instead of 
Pressure, then let the pen barrel rotate between your fingers naturally as you draw. 
(If you don’t have a pressure-sensitive tablet, only Random will have any effect on 
varying your stroke.) To create a variation of a brush, duplicate it by dragging it to 
the New Brush icon, then double-click the copy to edit it. If you create a variety of 
brushes—adding minor variances in Angle, Roundness, and Diameter—you can 
enhance the hand-drawn appearance of your ink drawing by selecting a brushed path 
and choosing a new brush for it.
3 Adding a wash. For this piece, Steuer added depth by introducing gray washes un-
derneath the dark brush-strokes. To easily edit the wash strokes without affecting the 
dark ink strokes, create a new layer, and draw your wash strokes into this layer be-
tween the ink and template layers. To avoid altering other layers while you brush in 
the washes, you may want to lock all the other layers. To toggle between locking all 
layers except the wash layer, and unlocking all layers at once, including the wash lay-
er, Option-click/Alt-click the wash layer’s Lock icon.
For the wash, select a light color. Steuer used the Dry Ink 2 brush from the 
Artistic_Ink brush library (Swatch Libraries menu). In the Layers panel, click the 
wash layer to make it the current drawing layer, and paint away.
252

Transparent brushstrokes
By default, calligraphic brush-strokes are opaque. You can also draw with semi-
transparent brushstrokes, which you can use to simulate some types of inks or 
watercolors; where marks overlap, they become richer or darker. Click Opacity in the 
Control panel to reduce opacity or choose a blending mode.

As a class assignment, Professor Stephen Klema challenged his students to create 
expressive graphic illustrations of organic forms. The students of Tunxis Community 
College used a variety of default brushes from the brushes panel. They included 
both calligraphic and art brushes. Before drawing, the students double-clicked the 
Paintbrush tool and adjusted the Paintbrush tool preferences. They dragged the 
Fidelity and Smoothness sliders to the desired positions (there is only the one 
Fidelity slider in CC). The Fidelity slider moved all the way to the left (Accurate) is 
the preferred setting for the most accurate brushstrokes, while moved towards the 
right yields smoother strokes. The “Fill New Brush Strokes” and “Keep Selected” 
options were disabled to allow multiple brushstrokes to be drawn near each other 
without redrawing the last path. Using a pressure-sensitive tablet, the students drew 
varying widths and angles of brushstrokes, many either on top of or close to one 
another, for a spontaneous, expressive look. Extra points within the brushstrokes 
were deleted using the Smooth tool or the Delete Anchor Point tool.

Using the same techniques described on the previous page, additional student 
creations are shown above. In some of these illustrations, artists applied art and 
calligraphic brushes to paths drawn with the Pencil or Pen tools, by selecting the 
path, and then choosing a brush from the Brushes panel. You can ﬁnd many 
additional brushes in the Brushes library. To access more art brushes, click on the 
Brush Libraries Menu icon found in the lower left corner of the Brushes panel. 
Choose Open Brush Library> Artistic, then select the brushes you want to add to 
the Brushes panel. Find more artwork from Professor Klema’s students on his

Sharon Steuer
To create this illustration for her “Good Food in the Microhood” UntappedCities.com 
posting, Sharon Steuer began in Photoshop, where she collaged photos she’d 
taken from different vantage points into one imaginary cityscape. After placing it as 
a JPG template in Illustrator, from another image, she copied objects styled with her 
custom calligraphic brushes and pasted the objects into her new ﬁle, which added 
the custom brushes to her current Brushes panel. She then deleted the objects and 
used these brushes to paint her black line drawing. In a new layer she added color 
using default bristle brushes and a pressure-sensitive Wacom tablet and Art Pen. To 
easily switch between brushes, colors, and layers, she started by selecting a path 
styled similarly to the one she wanted to make, then deselected ( -Shift-A/Ctrl-
Shift-A). To draw a new, blue, wide transparent bristle brush stroke on the Color 
layer, she selected a blue-wide stroke on the Color layer, then deselected, and 
drew. Next, to draw a new calligraphic path on the lines layer, she selected then 
deselected one of those. With Edit Selected enabled in Brush Options, if she kept a 
brush stroke selected, she could redraw the path (instead of draw a new one). After 
adding a few more detail layers, she created an “unwanted lines layer” and hid it, 
so she could then select and move unwanted lines to that hidden layer. Lastly she 
created two overlapping artboards: one to frame the crop when featured on the 
website front page, and the other sized for insertion within the post. To see this 
posting, which also contains a link to an article on CreativePro.com detailing how 
this image was created, go to UntappedCities.com and enter “CreativePro” in the 
search ﬁeld.

For her UntappedCities.com “Good Food in the Microhood” article on San 
Francisco’s Tender-loin restaurants, Sharon Steuer used Photoshop to stretch, crop, 
and color-correct her photo of the Vietnamese soup called “
.” She placed the 
photo in Illustrator off the artboard (as a reference), and used the Pen tool to draw a 
few closed paths (ﬁlled with gradients). Locking that ﬁrst layer with the objects and 
photo, she created additional layers, where she painted her image using two bristle 
brushes at default settings (one Angle and one Mop), and a custom calligraphic 
brush.
259

As the image progressed Steuer decided to modify the bowl’s shape in ways that 
would be difﬁcult with traditional or raster tools; she selected the bowl objects, then 
compressed them vertically using the bounding box. After the article posted, she 
reworked the image as a ﬁne art piece titled “Vegan 
.” Resizing some elements 
and adding others, she printed a square variation in archival materials. Coating the 
print with clear acrylic medium, Steuer cut and collaged it onto a 6"x6" cradled 
board, and then drew and painted on the surface with watercolor pencils. She 
applied ﬁxative and a UV coating to the ﬁnished artwork.

JACKMORE
Painting Inside
Painting with Bristle Brushes & Draw Inside
Advanced Technique
Overview: Start with a placed image as a reference; create a line drawing made of closed 
paths; use a variety of bristle brushes and the Draw Inside mode to paint the sketch; add a 
rectangular background with a Charcoal art brush edge.
Draw Inside mode makes it easy to create a painterly illustration with bristle 
brushes. Lisa Jackmore drew this sketch of an artichoke, using a Wacom tablet with 
her Art Pen, and several modified brushes. After drawing a simple outline of the 
artichoke leaves and the stem with the Pencil tool, she utilized the Draw Inside mode 
and painted with a range of bristle brushes.
1 Drawing the outlines. Jackmore used a snapshot as a basic reference, but if you pre-
fer to draw directly on top of a photo or drawing use File> Place and enable the Tem-
plate option. In order to create an accurate line drawing she double-clicked the Pen-
cil tool to open Pencil Tool Options, where she chose the most Accurate Fidelity, then 
disabled Edit Selected Paths and Keep Selected. Into one layer she created a 1-pt line 
drawing using the Pencil tool, making sure that she closed each leaf and stem path so 
that she would later be able to add detail and color to the loosely-drawn paths using 
the Draw Inside mode. 
261

1-pt stroke
2 Setting up for painting using the bristle brush tool and a tablet. So she’d be able to paint 
freely and easily, Jackmore planned ahead and first set up her tools. She opened the 
Brushes panel, the Bristle Brush Library (from the Libraries menu), and the Layers 
panel. She also set the Wacom tablet’s Touch Ring to auto scroll/zoom.
3 Painting with bristle brushes and the Draw Inside mode. To draw into a path, she select-
ed it, pressed Shift-D to choose the Draw Inside mode, then deselected the path (so 
the bristle brush wouldn’t be applied to the outline, but would be constrained within 
the path). She selected the Paintbrush tool (B), then chose a bristle brush, and a 
stroke color. When she finished drawing inside a path, Jackmore pressed Shift-D to 
switch back to Normal drawing mode. She switched between the Paintbrush tool and 
the Selection tool by holding the 
/Ctrl key to temporarily switch to the Selection 
tool, and toggled between drawing modes with Shift-D. Jackmore created a number 
of variations of the Round Point, Fan, Round, and Flat Blunt bristle brushes. To cus-
tomize parameters for opacity, Bristle Length, Stiffness, and Thickness, she’d open 
Options by pressing the upper switch on the Intuos4 Pen (or double-clicking the 
Paintbrush tool). With the Paint-brush tool selected, she decreased/increased brush 
size with the [ ] keys, adjusted opacity with the number keys, and zoomed in or out 
by turning Wacom tablet’s Touch Ring clockwise, or counter-clockwise.

ing inside the leaf
4 Organizing layers and ﬁnishing details. To reveal the correct part of the leaf as it over-
lapped another, as she worked, Jackmore moved each leaf into its appropriate layer. 
As each leaf and stem became painted enough to see the entire path, while in Normal 
drawing mode she set the stroke to None. To fine-tune the painted area for a particu-
lar leaf, she double-clicked on that leaf to automatically enter into isolation mode 
while already in Draw Inside mode, allowing her to continue to paint and modify 
brushstrokes. For the background, on a layer below Jack-more drew a rectangle, with 
the same fill and stroke color and applied a 3-pt Charcoal art brush stroke. To more 
fully distribute the brushstroke, she slightly rotated a duplicate of the stroke by first 
clicking the Add New Stroke icon in the Appearance panel (to add a stroke), and 
from the fx menu she chose Distort & Transform> Transform and entered 180° for 
rotation.

When you use the Draw Inside mode (bottom of the Tools panel or Shift-D), you’re 
actually creating a special kind of clipping mask. Once you’ve “drawn inside” an 
object, double-click it to enter into isolation mode and automatically re-enter Draw 
Inside mode to add to the object. To remove a “drawn inside” clipping mask from an 
object and return the object to its original state, choose Object> Clipping Mask> 
Release.

GEISLER
Painterly Portraits
Painting in Layers with Bristle Brushes
Advanced Technique
Overview: Place a sketch as a template; draw with customized bristle brushes; continue to 
paint with custom brushes into separate layers; create frame.
The myriad bristle brushes presented Greg Geisler with an infinite variety of brushes 
to create his expressive painterly portrait, “Blue Mirror.” Commissioned by Adobe 
Systems, you can find this file, and a PDF ReadMe file explaining more about how he 
made it, on WOW! ONLINE.
1 Placing the initial sketch, and customizing Bristle Brush Options. Geisler placed his dis-
torted Photoshop sketch (PSD) as a Template layer. He opened the Bristle Brush Li-
brary (from the Brush Libraries menu in the lower left of the Brushes panel) and 
clicked on the 1-pt Round bristle brush, which automatically loaded the brush into 
the Brushes panel. Geisler next duplicated that brush (by dragging its icon to the 
New Brush icon in the Brushes panel) and then double-clicked on the New Brush 
icon so he could change several settings in Bristle Brush Options. He made changes 
to Bristle Thickness, adjusted Paint Opacity and increased the Stiffness, and then 
named it and clicked OK. On a layer above the template, he used this new brush to 
create the base sketch for the entire illustration. Geisler kept the Brushes panel and 
the Bristle Brush Library open throughout the drawing session, so he could continue 
to duplicate and customize brushes as his drawing progressed. For this layer, he cre-
ated three different variations of the 1-pt Liner brush.

2 Adding highlights, midtones, and shadows. To make one of the many layers of high-
lights, such as the strokes in orange, Geisler customized copies of the 3-mm Flat Fan 
Brush in the Bristle Brushes Library, adjusting Bristle Thickness, Bristle Length, and 
Paint Opacity. He also drew highlights with a Round bristle brush customized with 
pointy variations. Geisler continued to draw in separate layers, focusing in particular 
on midtones, shadows, highlights, or color for each layer, using variations of the Flat 
Fan and Round bristle brushes.

3 Working efﬁciently and further modifying brush characteristics. Geisler’s process is very 
organic in that he continually defines new brushes, and creates new layers, as he 
draws. He rarely deletes a stroke, preferring to layer new bristle brushstrokes upon 
others, choosing a more opaque brush to cover the underlying strokes. As he’s draw-
ing, he presses the [ key to decrease the brush size, and the ] key, to increase the bris-
tle size. To vary the opacity, he presses the keys from 1, which is completely transpar-
ent, through 0, which is completely opaque. To add texture, as in the blue back-
ground Figure 3 Blue, Geisler modifies the settings to increase the brush stiffness to-
ward Rigid, increase the brush density toward Thick, and then decrease the bristle 
length.

tion with blue texture
4 Finishing touches. Geisler created an irregular edged black frame that surrounded 
the portrait, on a layer between the blue texture and the face. He customized a wide 
Flat Fan brush to 100% Opacity (100% opaque bristle brushes lose their character 
within the stroke, but maintain a ragged edge), and then expanded the brushstrokes 
(Object> Expand) and clicked Unite in the Pathfinder panel, melding the brush-
strokes into one frame object. He then used the Pencil tool to draw a few closed 
paths, delineating the area between the rectangular frame and the head. Marquee-
se-lecting these paths and the frame, he filled them with black, and again clicked 
Unite in the Pathfinder panel.

Greg Geisler created this graphic self-portrait using a customized calligraphic 
brush. In the Brushes panel, Geisler double-clicked the default 3-pt round 
calligraphic brush, and for the Diameter settings, he changed Fixed to Pressure, 
and set the Variation to 3 pt. Using a Wacom tablet and pressure-sensitive pen, he 
drew the facial outline, varying the stroke width as he changed his touch (Face 
Outline). To block out planes of color within the face (such as the chin, beard, and 
cheek), he used the Pencil tool to draw color-ﬁlled irregular paths on separate 
layers. Each layer contained one of the many deﬁning areas of color (Layers Panel) 
for highlights, shadows, or texture. To create the frame, Geisler used the same 
bristle brush, and a technique similar to the one developed in the previous lesson 
(Bristle Brush Frame). For ﬁnishing touches, Geisler drew the bright blue squiggly 
lines with the Pencil tool.

CESAR de OLIVEIRA BALDACCI
Janaína Cesar de Oliveira Baldacci
Based on a photograph taken by Tatiana Bicalho, Baldacci captured the natural 
undulations of the fur and folds of her pet bulldog with bristle brushes. Baldacci ﬁrst 
drew a white outline of the dog (against the black background) with the Pen tool 
and applied a Gaussian Blur effect. From the Brush Libraries menu (in the bottom 
left of the Brushes panel), Baldacci opened the Bristle Brush Library. She then 
chose a few bristle brushes that had varying characteristics in Paint Opacity, Bristle 
Stiffness, and Bristle Density, such as Round Fan, Flat Blunt, Flat Point, and Round 
Curve (Brushes Panel & Preview Mode). Baldacci then selected the Paintbrush tool 
(B), chose a bristle brush and a stroke color, and drew into the ﬁrst of many layers 
(Outline Mode View). In layers above, she added greater deﬁnition and built the fur 
in stages based on color, such as white, gray, and highlights. On the uppermost 
layers she added the snout, eye details, and additional layers of fur until the portrait 
was complete.

LARRETT
Pattern Brushes
Building Characters with Pattern Brushes
Overview: Create the parts that will make up a pattern brush separately; place the parts in the 
Swatches panel and give them distinctive names; use the Pattern Brush Options dialog to cre-
ate the brushes; vary the width of the pattern brush line using the Stroke menu and the Width 
tool.
To create these stylized science-fiction robots, Raymond Larrett saved extensive 
tedious rendering by building the robot limbs using a custom pattern brush. Working 
this way allows him to quickly and easily make alterations to his art by adjusting the 
weight of the brush stroke, modifying or replacing the various brush elements, or 
even replacing the entire brush itself.
1 Creating the robot arm parts. Larrett’s robot arm required four distinct elements: a 
“shoulder” piece where the arm joins the body, an “elbow” connecting the upper and 
lower arm, the “hand” (in this case a claw), and an “arm link” segment that replicates 
as it connects and forms the majority of the robot arm. He created these pieces indi-
vidually, then turned each into a separate pattern swatch. These swatches become 
the “tiles,” that together make up the robot arm pattern brush.
To create the shoulder piece, he first modified a shape made with the Ellipse tool. 
Using the Pen tool, he drew a lighter, unfilled path with a Round Cap for the 
highlight to complete the shoulder. He then dragged the shoulder art into the 
Swatches panel, naming it “shoulder” so he would recognize it as he built the pattern 
277

brush. In the same way he created the arm link, hand, and elbow swatches for the 
pattern brush tiles. He made sure that the various pieces were facing in the correct 
direction relative to the pattern tiles, which run at right angles to the path, before 
individually dragging each one into the Swatches panel (alternatively, you can select 
art and click the New Swatch icon, or choose Object> Pattern> Make).

facing position that pattern brushes use for 
their tiles

naming them
2 Making and using the pattern brush. To build the pattern brush for the robot arm, Lar-
rett opened the Brushes panel, clicked New Brush in Pattern Brush Options, and 
then clicked OK. He clicked in the Side Tile box and selected the desired pattern 
swatch for the arm (CS6 and CC tile order and swatch selection methods differ slight-
ly). Next he placed the other tiles in the appropriate position: the shoulder as the 
Start Tile, the hand as the End Tile, and the elbow as the Inner Corner Tile. He 
named the new pattern brush Robot Arm, and clicked OK.
To use his new pattern brush, Larrett selected the brush in the Brushes panel, then 
drew a path for the robot arm using the Pen tool (P). He clicked where the Start Tile 
(the shoulder) should go, clicked again to place a corner anchor point (necessary 
for the elbow tile, the Inner Side Tile, to load), and finally clicked to place the hand 
element (the End Tile) at the end of the path. He also sometimes drew with the 
Paintbrush tool or applied the brush to a drawn path.

ate tiles (CS6 and CC tile order and swatch 
selection methods differ slightly) 
279

3 Creating variations in the pattern brush. Larrett then modified the art by varying the 
pattern brush line weight and stroke profiles. To adjust the width of a selected robot 
arm, he changed the line weight in the Control panel or Stroke panel by clicking in 
the numeric field and using the up arrow and down arrow keys to increase or de-
crease stroke weight as desired (adding the Shift key alters the weight by increments 
of 10). To manually adjust only selected portions of the robot limb, Larrett used the 
Width tool (Shift-W). Placing the tool over a point on a path, he moved the diamond-
shaped handles to widen or narrow a portion of the path. Lastly, he combined some 
old and newly-made swatches to create additional brushes for other robots’ limbs.

Adjusting pattern brush fit
After you’ve applied a pattern brush to a path, you can still scale, flip, and modify its 
fit along the path. Modify all these settings in the Pattern Brush Options dialog, or 
manually reshape and scale the pattern by changing the stroke weight or using the 
Width tool.
281

MCGARRY
Aaron McGarry
For this urban portrait Aaron McGarry relied heavily upon Illustrator’s Symbol 
Libraries and Symbols panel. He made his own panel containing only the symbols 
he needed using Window> Symbol Libraries> User Deﬁned. He saved as a symbol 
any detail that he would need to repeat so he could easily access and apply that 
element. To build the roof tiles in the background building, McGarry made one tile 
and ﬁlled it with a solid color. He then made two duplicates and ﬁlled each with a 
different color. He separately dragged and dropped each into the Symbols panel, 
named it, and clicked OK. He was then able to quickly drag alternating tiles from 
the panel to lay the roof, giving it a natural look.
282

To create the red plumbing in the foreground, he also used many duplicated parts, 
such as the nuts and bolts holding the assembly together, that he had saved as 
symbols (Plumbing Detail). McGarry took full advantage of Illustrator’s Symbol 
libraries to create the greenery and curb area around the pipes. He used grass, 
leaves, and rocks found in the libraries accessed from the Symbol Libraries icon in 
the Symbols panel. To create a perspective point of view he modiﬁed some of the 
symbols; for instance, he used Effect> Distort & Transform to turn Rock symbols into 
paved concrete. He also created the oil stains on the road by modifying a Dot 
Pattern symbol from Illustrator’s library. For the dirt on the vehicle, he drew a path 
around its lower side, then enabled the Draw Inside drawing mode. Using the 
Symbol Sprayer tool he sprayed the sand symbol within the path along the vehicle’s 
side. Lastly, he selected the path and reduced the opacity.

MIYAMOTO
Nobuko Miyamoto/Yukio Miyamoto
Making these intricate beaded necklaces at ﬁrst glance would seem impossibly 
difﬁcult, but once they carefully construct each gem, with the use of pattern 
brushes, the necklace virtually draws itself. Nobuko Miyamoto designed the 
necklace and created the bead elements (Bead Detail) with a mixture of blended 
and solid ﬁlled objects. She paid careful attention to the ends of the bead to ensure 
that when each bead lined up with the next one there would be a seamless 
connection between them.
Yukio Miyamoto then transformed Nobuko’s designs into brushes. To make the 
chained ends, he selected the chain object and dragged a copy (Shift-Option/Shift-
Alt) to the other side of the bead. With the chain selected, he chose the Reﬂect tool 
and clicked above and below the chain to reﬂect the chain vertically. He selected 
and grouped each bead, and then in some cases he put the beads in pairs and 
then grouped a pair of beads. For each bead or pair of beads Yukio clicked the 
New Brush icon at the bottom of the Brushes panel, selected New Pattern Brush, 
and clicked OK. In the Pattern Brush Options dialog, he kept the Colorization 
method as None, and then under Fit he chose Stretch to Fit. To make the necklace, 
Nobuko drew a path with the Paintbrush tool and selected the desired bead pattern 
brush in the Brushes panel to apply the brush. Now with the bead as a pattern 
brush, the necklace can be easily adjusted to any length or path.
284

TAN
Moses Tan
Moses Tan recreated astonishing detail and captured a precise likeness of his 
photographic reference using mostly meticulously-drawn ﬁlled paths, but he used 
custom art and scatter brushes for some of the intricate details (Painted Weed 
Detail). He preferred to use scatter brushes for the small-sized growth and art 
brushes for the larger foliage. To make an art or scatter brush he ﬁrst drew a weed 
object, then dragged it into the Brushes panel and in the New Brush Options, 
selected Art Brush or Scatter Brush (Tan’s Brushes Panel). For art brushes he 
speciﬁed the stroke direction (either top to bottom or left to right) so when he drew a 
brushstroke, the foliage was oriented correctly. He kept the other parameters at the 
default settings. For the scatter brushes he varied options for each weed (size, 
spacing, scatter, and rotation). For scatter brushes he used Page for “Rotation 
relative to,” and to preserve the original artwork colors in all his brushes, he used a 
Colorization of None. To paint with a brush he would select the Paintbrush tool, a 
scatter or art brush, and draw paths to easily form the weeded detail in his drawing.

DEL VECHIO by permission from Illustrator CC. O que há de novo?
Gustavo Del Vechio
For his PDF booklet, Illustrator CC. O que há de novo? (translated as Illustrator CC: 
What’s new?), artist and author Gustavo Del Vechio created a pattern brush that 
would demonstrate the various options available with the new auto-generated 
corners in Illustrator CC. He’s very kindly sharing with us his clear diagrams and 
explanation of the way corner tiles are formed from the side tile. Note that in Pattern 
Brush Options, Show Auto Generated Corner Tiles is enabled by default, so if you 
don’t see them in the list of corner tiles, make sure that’s still enabled. There are a 
few basic strategies that Illustrator uses to calculate corners for you, and combines 
them in various combinations. These include stretching your pattern (like an art 
brush), copying and then overlaying extensions of the patterns, and ﬁnally, making 
cuts or “slicing” parts of the pattern in various ways, deleting the extraneous bits. 
These auto-generated tiles will ﬁt with the side tile, but don’t forget to look at your 
choices for both the Outer Corner and the Inner Corner, found on either side of your 
side tile in the Pattern Brush dialog, to make sure you have corners that both ﬁt well 
and look good. See the following pages for a closer look at auto-corner options.
287

GUSTAVO DEL VECHIO
Auto-Centered tiles are formed by the side tile stretching along the path like an art 
brush and forcing it to make a 90° turn at the corner. Any extraneous portion of the 
pattern gets trimmed to make a smooth join, but the side tile itself isn’t cut apart.
288

DEL VECHIO
Auto-Between uses two copies of the side tile, one in a vertical orientation, the other 
turned horizontally by 90°, manipulated to ﬁt the geometric shape that represents 
one half of the corner. Illustrator cuts each at the upper-left corner at a 45° angle, 
then joins them together along that cut. You’ll notice distortions when the side tile 
isn’t square; the more rectangular the area, the more distortion will occur. If the 
objects are round, the level of distortion in the tile is even more obvious. For 
example, a composition with straight lines (above, top) looks less distorted than one 
using ellipses (directly above).
GUSTAVO DEL VECHIO
Auto-Sliced also uses two copies of the side tile. Illustrator again orients one side 
tile vertically and one horizontally, then ﬁnds the center of the tile. It next makes a 
cut at a 45° angle, top left to bottom right, through the center of each copy. After 
deleting the top portion of the vertical tile and the left portion of the horizontal tile, it 
joins the copies along the cut to form the corner tile.
289

DEL VECHIO
Auto-Overlap uses two copies of the side tile, one oriented vertically and one 
horizontally, to align the tiles on their center points. It then removes any excess that 
extends above or to the left of the tiles. The two remaining sections still overlap at 
their center, but the tile is cut along the overlap edge, the hidden portion is deleted, 
and the two parts are joined into the corner tile.
For Auto-Corners to work...
In the Pattern Brush Options ﬁeld, the ﬁeld Show Auto Generated Corner Tiles must 
be enabled in order for you to have access to the four methods of auto corners.
An inny or an outy?
You must separately set corner methods (None, Auto Generated, or from selected 
art) from pop-ups on either side of the main pattern (side) tile; set Outer corners on 
the left and Inner corners on the right.
JACKMORE
 Brush Corners
Pattern Brushes Made with a Raster Image
Overview: Isolate a part of a photo to use as a raster brush by creating a mask for it in Photo-
shop or image editor; import image into Illustrator, embed and resize image; create a Pattern 
Brush from the raster image; use the Pattern Brush Options to specify the attributes. 
Applying a pattern brush along a path is fairly simple, and now Illustrator can help 
create the corners for you. In fact, Illustrator can assist in creating corners for raster 
brushes!
290

1 Preparing a bitmap image to use as a brush in Illustrator. In Photoshop, Lisa 
Jackmore selected the medallion in her photo, clicked the Layer Mask icon (to isolate 
it) and then with the mask selection active she chose Image> Crop to trim the file to 
the size of the medallion. To bring the image into Illustrator as an embedded image, 
she then saved it as PNG to keep the file size as small as possible. You can use either 
PSD or PNG to bring in a masked object with opacity. Jackmore opened the image 
directly in Illustrator. Alternatively if you choose Edit> Place, you can disable the 
Link option, or if it’s already a linked image in your document you can click Embed 
from the Con-trol panel. Jackmore then resized the image to the correct size for the 
frame she in-tended to make (holding Shift when she dragged the corner of the 
bounding box).

(right)
2 Creating the Pattern Brush. Jackmore dragged the image to the Brushes panel, select-
ed Pattern Brush, and clicked OK. For the first version of her brush, in the Pattern 
Brush Options, she named the brush, kept the scale Fixed (100%), Spacing 0%. She 
selected the Outer Corner Tile and chose Auto-Centered, then clicked on the Inner 
Corner Tile and chose Auto-Centered as well. Jackmore chose Approximate Path and 
Spacing at 0%. She made a rectangle with the Rectangle tool and selected the Medal-
lion Pattern Brush in the Brushes panel. Because Jackmore chose the Approximate 
Path option and Spacing at 0%, her medallion Pattern Brush evenly distributed 
around the path without gaps between the medallions, and without distortion. How-
ever, depending on the size, it adjusts the path size to accommodate the pattern tile. 
The smaller the pattern, the less your pattern will be modified as it’s applied. You can 
reduce the scale of your pattern by just adjusting the stroke weight in the Control 
panel.

ner Tiles

3 Experimenting with brushes. When experimenting with brushes it’s always best to 
work with a duplicate. To do this, drag the brush you wish to modify to the New 
Brush icon in the bottom right of the Brushes panel. Then to modify this brush, dou-
ble-click it in the panel. In Pattern Brush Options you can then try the different spac-
ing options as well as a different type of Auto-Corner, Fit, and Scale. Rename the 
brush to reflect the modifications that you chose, and click OK. You can then apply 
this brush to another path, or you can duplicate the original path, and then apply the 
modified version so you can compare the brushes.
You can continue to make new brushes until you’ve experimented with all the 
different parameters, and if the brushes are meaningfully named, you’ll be able to 
figure out if there is a different combination of Corner, Fit, and Scale you want to try. 
If your image is a complicated shape, or has a repeating pattern, it will be more 
challenging to find the right Auto-Corner. If you find you do not like the Auto-Corner 
results, you may have to go back into your image editor and make adjustments to the 
image and then try the Auto-Corners again. If that doesn’t completely fix your 
corners, you can manually edit the corners in Illustrator (see the following galleries 
for more about updating brush definitions).

Exacting image crops
Mask and crop your image in Photoshop to the desired tile size rather than trying to 
apply a clipping mask to the placed image in Illustrator, because Illustrator will use 
the entire placed image dimensions—and not the intended crop dimensions—as the 
tile size.

JACKMORE
Lisa Jackmore
Lisa Jackmore created variations within her pattern brush using Variable Width 
Proﬁle. She began by drawing the bottle, the text, one set of necklace links, and the 
blue bead with a Calligraphic brush and pressure-sensitive pen and tablet. For the 
heart bead she scanned a stone, then masked it in Photoshop. Jackmore then 
placed the PNG image of the stone heart onto the artboard in Illustrator, then in the 
Control panel clicked the Embed link and scaled the image proportionally. 
Jackmore aligned the beaded elements to the heart, dragged them together into 
the Brushes panel, and selected Pattern brush, keeping all the default settings.
Jackmore chose the Paintbrush tool, made a circular path, and clicked on the 
Pattern brush to apply it to the path. To suggest perspective and slightly vary bead 
size, she selected the path, switched to the Width tool, and then selected several 
295

points. She held the Shift key down while dragging one point to uniformly modify the 
width. She continued until the beads looked as though they were lying ﬂat, with 
some of the hearts slightly larger than others. She saved the proﬁle by clicking the 
Add to Proﬁle icon in the Variable Width Proﬁle menu in the Control panel. With her 
main elements in place, Jackmore added background color with a bristle brush and 
the text and ﬂowers with a calligraphic brush. Having saved the proﬁle in the 
application settings, she now has access to this custom proﬁle to apply to paths of 
any type, including brushes. Jackmore created several variations of the pattern 
brush that she can now substitute for the original; you can see some Jackmore 
Necklace Variations.

With just a few adjustments to her designs, Lisa Jackmore was able to very quickly 
make variations to her pattern brushes. Shown below are several pattern brush 
variations created for the She Only Wears Perfume, which are then applied to circle 
paths above.
JACKMORE
Lisa Jackmore
Lisa Jackmore found inspiration for this Pattern Brush in a steel-beamed ceiling. 
She saved a raster image detail of the beam as a PNG image (Steel Beam Image) 
in Photoshop, then opened it in Illustrator. Jackmore dragged the embedded image 
to the Brushes panel and selected Pattern Brush in the New Brush dialog. In Pattern 
Brush Options she kept the default Scale and Spacing. She only needed Outer 
Corners for a frame, so for this pattern she chose Auto-Sliced and Approximate 
Path, named it, and clicked OK. She made and selected a rectangle, then clicked 
on the pattern brush in the Brushes panel and applied the brush. Jackmore was 
aiming for a seamless pattern that didn’t distort the image; this attempt was pretty 
close, but not quite perfect (First Corner Attempt).
297

Jackmore felt she needed to tweak the pattern brush slightly so the dark seam, 
rivets, and bolts were better aligned and not cut off. To solve the puzzle about why 
her pattern repeat wasn’t working perfectly, she dragged the brush from the 
Brushes panel onto her artboard to examine more closely how the parts ﬁt together. 
An Auto-Sliced corner tile is made of two objects overlapping each other, within an 
unstroked, unﬁlled rectangle deﬁning the corner parameters. To adjust the Corner 
tile, Jackmore selected one image object at a time and used the arrow keys to 
move it within the tile until she ﬁgured out how to solve her problem. She then went 
back to Photoshop and made adjustments to the original image, including deleting 
one of the bolts, enlarging the ends of the image to extend the bolt-free area, and 
adjusting the dark seam on one side to align evenly with the opposite side 
(Photoshop Adjustments). Once she thought the right changes were made, she 
brought the image back into Illustrator and created a new pattern brush. Because 
the image was complex, Jackmore had to make a few more trips to Photoshop and 
then back to Illustrator to make new brushes with her tiles to ﬁnally achieve the 
perfect image, and in the end the Auto-Corners worked perfectly (Final Image 
Shown Separated).

STEUER
Sharon Steuer
Borrowing elements from Illustrator art she created several years earlier, Sharon 
Steuer rein-vigorated the original calligraphic brush work with the addition of a 
frame made with a pattern brush, invoking the look of a craft frame made by 
children on a beach vacation. Steuer duplicated, scaled, and rearranged the shells 
and starﬁsh. Dragging them into the Brushes panel, she chose Pattern Brush, 
enabled Stretch to ﬁt (under Fit), chose Tints and Hues as the Colorization Method, 
and clicked OK. For the corner, she decided to use a photograph of a real shell. 
After masking the photo in Photo-shop, she placed it as an embedded image in 
Illustrator.
To add the photo as a corner tile to the pattern brush, she selected the masked 
shell, then—with the Brushes panel in Thumb-nail view—held Option/Alt as she 
299

dragged the photo to the far left “tile space”of the shell pattern brush. Checking that 
her settings were still correct, she clicked OK. After applying the brush to a 
rectangle to form a frame, she didn’t like the position of the photo. To ﬁgure out how 
to reposition the shell, she used the frame on the artboard as a reference and 
positioned a copy of the masked shell photo over the original corner of the frame, 
rotating it into the desired position. Holding down the Option/Alt key, Steuer 
dragged the rotated shell onto the previous corner tile in the Brushes panel, 
retaining the other options.
To make pattern brush variations, she worked with duplicates of the original pattern 
brush, changing the Stroke weight in the Control panel and playing with different 
colorization methods in Brushes Options. To apply the color to vector objects of the 
pattern brush, she changed the Stroke color. To apply a shadow to the frame she 
selected Stroke in the Appearance panel, clicked on the fx icon, then selected 
Stylize> Drop Shadow. Some of the color and scale experiments are shown Steuer 
border variations.

STEUER
Sharon Steuer
After discovering that she could paint with raster images in Illustrator, Sharon Steuer 
decided to experiment with making a pattern brush from an Italian “push puppet” in 
her oil paintings (Puppet Oil Painting). In Photoshop she combined a number of 
details from different paintings in the series to form the pieces necessary to 
articulate three separate parts for the body (the legs and base, the torso, and the 
head), and three more so she could articulate the joints of an arm (one for each end 
and one for the middle). Tightly masking and cropping each element, she saved 
them as a separate PNG ﬁles, and placed all of them as embedded objects into one 
Illustrator ﬁle. Rotating each of the elements so that all were oriented horizontally, 
she dragged the torso segment into the Brushes panel.
301

Choosing the Pattern Brush, she clicked OK to enter and then OK to exit Options. 
With the panel set to Thumbnail view, she next held Option/Alt as she dragged the 
legs and base into the start tile position, then applied the brush to a path to check 
the scale and positioning of the segment. Steuer repeated this process with the 
head in the end tile, and then similarly created the arm brush in three stages. Using 
the Pen tool, she drew with the body pattern brush, then with the arm brush. If she’s 
careful about the path length and angles she can position her puppet with nuance, 
or she can accidentally create strange effects. For links to her “Artistic Painting with 
Illustrator” courses (one movie shows this brush) and a 7-day free trial link, go to

STEUER
Sharon Steuer
While preparing artwork for the pattern brush chapter in her lynda.com course 
“Artistic Painting with Illustrator: Object-Creation Brushes,” Sharon Steuer realized 
that not all patterns work well with corners. She decided to revisit an art piece she 
created many years ago in which she digitally wrapped a line of her doll paintings 
around circles. Now she could achieve the same result more easily by placing the 
“paper doll” image in Illustrator, making it into a pattern brush, wrapping the pattern 
brush around a circle. After adding a drop shadow and a second smaller stroke 
from fx in the Appearance panel (see the Reshaping Dimensions chapter for more on 
the Appearance panel), she then experimented with applying this pattern to a 
rectangle, but none of the Auto-corners looked good, and she couldn’t visualize a 
custom corner that would work regardless of the size of the rectangle. Steuer 
realized that she could eliminate corners entirely by applying her pattern to a 
rounded rectangle. In her “Simulating Corners” movie she demonstrated how to 
manually select and adjust the rectangle’s anchor points to tweak how the pattern 
wraps around the shape. Now, with Live Rectangles, this process is much easier. 
Simply create a rectangle using the Rectangle tool, or if you have a previously 
created rectangle, choose Object> Shape> Convert to Rectangle. If your pattern 
isn’t already applied, click Basic in the Control panel and choose your brush from 
the pop-up. Now, in the Control panel (from Shape) or in the Transform panel, click 
the arrows to adjust the Corner Radius ﬁeld. What radius value you’ll prefer will vary 
304

depending on the pattern, rectangle size, and stroke weight (both versions are 90 
pt).
JACKMORE
Lisa Jackmore
Lisa Jackmore decided to use her photo of a hand-painted decoration with 
asymmetries as the basis for a pattern brush. It would be impossible to match all of 
the castle fragments perfectly (ﬁgure a), so in Photoshop she used the Clone Stamp 
tool to remove most of the castle motifs, leaving only the one complete castle. After 
cropping the image, Jackmore opened it in Illustrator, rotated it, then dragged it into 
the Brushes panel to create a pattern brush. In Pattern Brush Options she chose 
Auto-Centered Corner Tile, which formed the pattern well but resulted in a distorted 
auto-generated corner (ﬁgure b). To generate a smooth corner, Jackmore went 
back to Photoshop and used the Clone Stamp Tool—this time completely removing 
the castle—then used this altered version to make a new pattern (ﬁgure c).

To replace the distorted corner in her castle brush with the new smooth corner, 
Jackmore ﬁrst duplicated the castle brush by dragging it to the New Brush icon in 
the Brushes panel. Next, setting her Brushes panel view to Thumbnail, she selected 
the pattern brush without the castle, then dragged it to the artboard to reveal the 
artwork that makes up each of the tiles. To replace the distorted corner with the 
smooth one, she used the Direct Selection tool to marquee the artwork that formed 
the smooth corner. Holding Option/Alt, she then dragged the selected art into the 
Brushes panel, and when the new smooth corner was directly on top of the 
distorted castle tile in the duplicate, she saw a + icon and released the cursor 
(ﬁgure d). In Pattern Brush Options she clicked OK, and the result was a new 
pattern brush with the smooth corner tile with subtle, small variations where some 
quatrefoils met at the corners. Find the link to her CreativePro article with more 
details about her process, at wowartist.com.

Color Transitions
Color Transitions
INTRODUCTION
Whether your colors are black and white, a limited palette, or a full spectrum, 
mastering the power of Illustrator requires a command of color transitions and 
groups of colors. This chapter focuses on the myriad ways of coloring your objects in 
Illustrator, from using the various panels, to creating transitions of colors with 
gradients and gradient mesh; it also looks at the group of panels and functions that 
Adobe calls Live Color.
No warning with Trash...
If you click the Trash icon in the Swatches panel, Illustrator does not warn you if 
you’re about to delete colors used in the document; Illustrator will simply delete the 
swatches, converting any global colors and spot colors to non-global process colors. 
Instead, choose Select All Unused and then click the Trash icon.
WORKING WITH THE COLOR AND SWATCHES PANELS
The main panels that help you work with color include Swatches, Color Guide, 
Gradient, Appearance, and Control panels. Click a Fill or Stroke color to reveal an 
arrow, which provides access to a version of the Swatches panel, or Shift-click to 
access the Color panel.
To save your current Stroke or Fill color as a swatch, drag it from the Toolbox or 
Color panel to the Swatches panel. You can also drag colors from the Color Guide to 
the Swatches panel. (See the CC section later in this chapter for info on proxy icons 
added to the Swatches panel in CC.) To name a single selected color as you create it 
(and set is as a global color if desired), click the New Swatch icon at the bottom of the 
Swatches panel instead. When you copy objects that contain custom swatches from 
one document to another, Illustrator automatically adds the swatches to the new 
document’s panels.
You can create three kinds of solid colors in Illustrator: process colors, global process 
colors, and spot colors. Each is easy to distinguish visually.
• Process colors (solid swatch) are mixed from the CMYK colors used for printing with
ink. Change the percentage of each ink to change the color, or choose a color from a 
swatch library, such as Pantone process uncoated.
• Global process colors are process colors with an added convenience: If you update
the definition for a global process color, Illustrator updates that color throughout the 
document. Identify a global process color in the Swatches panel by the small triangle 
in the lower-right corner of the swatch in any view, and by the Global Color icon in 
List view. Create a global process color by enabling the Global option (it’s off by 
default) in either the New Swatch or Swatch Options dialog.

top two user-deﬁned swatches are process 
colors; the middle two are spot colors; and 
the last two are global colors (at left with the 
document in CMYK mode; at right the same 
colors with the document in RGB mode)
• Spot colors are used in print jobs that require a premixed ink or varnish, rather than
a percentage of the four process colors. Specifying a spot color allows you to use 
colors that are outside of the CMYK gamut, or to achieve a more precise color match 
to the spot color you’ll be using than CMYK allows. You can specify a color as a spot 
color in the New Swatch dialog from the Color Type menu, or you can choose a spot 
color from a Swatch library, such as the various Pantone libraries (from the Swatch 
panel’s Swatch Libraries Menu icon choose Color Books). All spot colors are global, 
so they update automatically if you change the definition; when the Swatches panel is 
in Thumbnail view, they have a small triangle in the lower right corner, as well as a 
small dot or “spot.” In List view, they’re also marked by the Spot Color icon.
If it’s RGB and CMYK...
When you choose one of the web document formats, you’ll be working in RGB color 
space. If your art will be printed as well as displayed online, it’s best to begin in a 
print/CMYK color space.
Access to panels
In addition to the normal versions of the Color and Swatches panels, access pop-up 
instances from within the multi-purpose Appearance and Control panels. In the 
Appearance panel, click a Fill or Stroke color to reveal an arrow that lets you access 
a version of the Swatches panel, or Shift-click to access the Color panel—all without 
leaving the Appearance panel. In the Control panel, you can simply click on the 
arrow next to the Fill or Stroke swatches.
Four-color-process jobs
You can print four-color-process separations from the Print dialog, even if your 
objects contain spot colors, by enabling the “Convert All Spot Colors to 
Process” (from the Output option). Be aware, however, that there might be color 
shifts.
309

Color groups and the Color Guide
The default document profiles that ship with Illustrator include several swatches and 
one or two color groups to start using in your document. To create and save your own 
groups of colors, select multiple colors from the Swatches or the Color Guide panels, 
or select the objects in your artwork that contain the colors you want and click the 
New Color Group icon in the Swatches panel.
The New Color Group icon (top) makes it possible to organize your 
Swatches panel creating sets manually or 
from selected objects (shown selected at top 
and saved as a group at bottom); you also 
specify the name for the group
The Color Guide panel helps you mix and match colors according to various color 
schemes. At the upper left of the Color Guide panel is the “base color” swatch. You 
can choose a base color by clicking on a color in the Color Guide, Color, or Swatches 
panel. To the right of the base color swatch, you can choose a harmony rule that will 
automatically select colors that go with your base color, based on scientific color 
theory. Or, in the Swatches panel, click on the Color Group icon in a color group to 
load that group in the Color Guide panel. You can then preview variations of those 
colors by choosing to display them (using the Color Guide’s panel menu) according to 
value, temperature, or saturation. Drag a selected swatch (or swatches) to the 
Swatches panel to save it, or click on the “Save color group to Swatch panel” icon. 
Clicking on the “New swatch group” icon in the Swatches panel will also save your 
310

current harmony.
The Color Guide panel after changing the number of steps from the 
default 4 to 7, via Color Guide Options
To access the Harmony Rules menu, click on the popup menu to the far right of the 
base color. Once a new harmony rule is selected, its colors fill the strip beside the 
base color. Alter how many variations of that color group you see by choosing Color 
Guide Options from the Color Guide panel’s menu. You can change the number of 
steps in each color’s gradient (up to 20) and the amount of variation between steps. 
Also in the panel’s menu you will find the choice to view the colors as shades and 
tints, warm and cool, or vivid and muted. The Color Guide panel is one that can be 
resized wider and taller to accommodate the size of the grid. If you want to use your 
current color group as a base for even more color variations, click the Edit Colors 
icon at the bottom of the panel to enter the Edit Colors/Recolor Artwork dialog (for 
more about this icon see the “Live Color” section later in this chapter).
GRADIENTS
Gradients create seamless transitions from one color into another, often creating the 
appearance of realistic modeling. Illustrator can create either Radial or Linear 
gradients. You can not only apply gradients to Fills, but now in many cases, you can 
also apply gradients to Strokes. There are many similarities and a few distinct 
differences between the ways gradients can be applied to Fills versus Strokes. First, 
here are some of the similarities:
For both Fills and Strokes, you can choose a gradient style from the Swatches or the 
Gradient panels, and via Swatch Libraries accessed with buttons in panels or from 
the Window menu. Click the New Swatch icon in the Swatches panel to save your 
current gradient or, if you’ve modified a gradient since it was last saved, you can save 
the current variation within the Gradient panel by clicking on the arrow next to the 
main gradient icon and click the Add To Swatches icon.
Within the Gradient panel, you can make a variety of adjustments, including adding 
color stops, changing the colors and opacities of stops, toggling between Radial and 
Linear, or reversing the direction of the gradient. To find out how the Gradient panel 
changes to accommodate the specifics of Gradient Fills versus Strokes, see below.
311

Gradient panel with Radial gradient selected
Reset gradients to defaults
After you select an object that has an altered gradient angle (or highlight), new 
objects you draw will have the same settings. The fastest way to “re-zero” gradient 
settings such as angles is to press the “<” key to apply a solid Fill. Then click on your 
gradient swatch.
For linear gradients, you can also type a zero in the Angle field. Or, you can use the 
Gradient panel to switch between Radial and Linear and then back again to reset a 
custom angle without removing or relocating color stops.
Extra big gradient panel
A special feature of the Gradient panel is that you can make it extra
tall and wide, and the Gradient slider itself will increase in size, making it much 
easier to design complex gradients.
Shortcut for last-used gradient
The shortcut key “>” applies the last-used gradient and its angle (“<”applies the last 
used solid fill).
312

Tools, or Color panels, you can also apply the current or last-used gradient style to an 
object by clicking (or click-dragging) with the Gradient tool. You can start and/or 
end your gradient outside the object itself when dragging with the Gradient tool. This 
also places the Gradient Annotator onto your fill object. After applying a gradient to a 
selected object’s Fill using the Swatches panel, or by clicking on the object with the 
Gradient tool, use the Gradient panel or the Gradient Annotator (View> Show 
Gradient Annotator) to edit the gradient. Using the Gradient tool you can make a 
variety of adjustments to one object; with multiple gradient-filled objects selected, 
you can click and drag across multiple objects filled with gradients and unify the 
objects.
Probably the biggest difference between gradient fills and strokes is that only 
gradient fills allow you to make adjustments to the gradient on the object itself, using 
the Gradient tool. When the Gradient tool is active and Show Gradient Annotator is 
enabled, the Gradient Annotator appears as a bar across the gradient on the Fill of a 
selected object. To modify a Fill gradient using the Gradient Annotator, add and/or 
move the stops along the lower edge of the Annotator. Adjust the blend between the 
color stops by sliding the diamond shapes along the top of the Annotator, and change 
the color by double-clicking on a stop to open a panel you can toggle between 
showing the Color panel and the Swatches panel. You can set transparency for the 
gradient here, as well. To rotate or scale your gradient, hover over the diamond end 
of the Annotator until your cursor becomes a scale or rotate icon. Reposition the start 
point of the gradient using the hollow circle at the other end. If your object has a 
Radial Fill, you can also drag on the solid anchor to interactively transform the circle 
into an elliptical shape.
Adding color to gradients
• Drag a swatch from the Color or Swatches panel to the Gradient slider until you
see a vertical line indicating where the new color stop will be added.
• Drag a solid color from the Fill or Stroke proxies in the Tools or Gradient panels.
• Hold down the Option/Alt key to drag a copy of a color stop.
• Option-drag/Alt-drag one stop over another to swap colors.
• For Fills, double-click the color stop on the Gradient Annotator or the slider bar in
the Gradient panel, and select a color from the Swatches or Color panels.
• For Fills, hover your cursor beneath the Gradient Annotator bar or Gradient slider
(where the stops are); when you see a small “+” next to your cursor, you can click to 
add a new stop.
Missing Gradient Annotator?
If you don’t see the Gradient Annotator, then try using the toggle View> Show 
Gradient Annotator (
-Option-G/Ctrl-Alt-G). If you apply one unifying gradient to 
multiple objects, however, you’ll only see one (unifying) annotator until you later 
reselect one or more objects, at which point you’ll see one annotator per object.
Gradient Fills and the Gradient Annotator
In addition to Linear and Radial gradients, gradient fills also can become Elliptical 
gradient fills created from Radial gradients. If the Fill is selected in the Gradient,

2) rotating or scaling the gradient (right);  
3) moving the gradient start point
314

Stroke Gradients
Stroke Gradients have some unique options that aren’t available to Fill gradients. In 
the Gradient panel you can choose from three Align options: within the stroke, along 
the stroke, or across the stroke. You can control whether a gradient applied to a stroke 
using the within option is aligned to the Inside or Outside of the path using the 
Stroke panel (but you can’t use these options with gradients applied along or across 
the stroke). You can apply a gradient to a Calligraphic or Bristle Brush Stroke, but 
not to scatter, pattern, or art brushes. With gradients applied to brush strokes, you’ll 
be able to Reverse the direction, but you can’t apply the gradient along or across the 
stroke. If you Expand or Outline a Stroke gradient (Object> Expand> Expand 
Appearance, or Objects> Path Outline Stroke), gradients applied within the Stroke 
become gradient-filled objects and can be edited as such, but Stroke gradients 
applied along or across the Stroke become gradient mesh objects.
A gradient graphic style
Aspect ratio and angle information are not saved with gradient swatches. However, if 
you save your gradient swatch as a graphic style, that information is saved with it.
GRADIENT MESH
A gradient mesh object is an object on which multiple colors can flow in different 
directions, with smooth transitions between the mesh points. You can transform a 
solid or gradient-filled object into mesh (you can’t transform compound paths into 
mesh). Once transformed, the object will always be a mesh object, so be certain that 
you work with a copy of the original if it’s difficult to re-create.
Transform solid filled objects into gradient mesh objects either by choosing Object> 
Create Gradient Mesh (so you can specify details on the mesh construction) or by 
clicking on the object with the Mesh tool, which manually places mesh lines. One way 
to get a head start in creating a mesh object is to transform a gradient-filled object 
into a mesh object: choose Object> Expand and enable the Gradient Mesh option.
315

An easy way to create a gradient mesh is to begin with a linear 
gradient, then choose Object> Expand and 
enable the Gradient Mesh option under the 
Expand Gradient To section
Depending on where you click with the Mesh tool within a mesh object, you’ll add 
points (or lines and points) to the mesh. Reshape the mesh with the Direct Selection 
tool, using the anchors and their handles as with any ordinary path. Select individual 
points, groups of points, or patches within the mesh using the Direct Selection tool, 
the Lasso tool, or the Mesh tool, in order to color or delete them. If the Mesh tool is 
selected, holding down the Option/Alt key and clicking on a mesh point deletes it. 
You can sample a color with the Eyedropper and either immediately have it apply to 
all selected areas of the mesh object, or, with the mesh object completely deselected, 
use the Option/Alt key to click with the Eyedropper tool on a mesh point or space 
between points. Adding color to a patch instead of a single point spreads the color to 
all surrounding points. When adding a new mesh point, the color currently selected 
in the Swatches panel will be applied to the new point. If you want the new mesh 
point to remain the color currently applied to the mesh object, hold down the Shift 
key while adding a new point.
Once you’ve expanded a gradient-ﬁlled object to a mesh, you 
can edit the locations and colors of the mesh points, and add 
mesh points and lines 
316

To further modify the shape your gradient mesh takes, you can use any of the Distort 
tools, such as Warp or Pucker, to reshape it. You don’t even have to select points 
first. Hover over the mesh to highlight it; the size of your distorting tool will 
determine how many mesh points and patches get distorted at the same time.
You can assign transparency to a gradient mesh object as you can to other vector 
objects. Simply select either the mesh points or patches you want and use either the 
Appearance panel (click on Opacity), or the Transparency panel, to reduce the 
Opacity below 100%.
Hint: Instead of applying a mesh to a complex path, try to ﬁrst create the mesh from a
simpler path outline, then mask the mesh with the more complex path. You also can stack 
simple objects with gradient mesh applied to them to construct a more complex object.

“Transparent Mesh” lesson later in this chapter

To extract an editable path from a mesh, select the mesh object, choose Object>

LIVE COLOR
Live Color is a phrase Adobe sometimes uses to describe the combination of features 
(introduced in CS3) that help you be creative with color. The heart of what Adobe 
calls Live Color is a dialog that can be entered a number of different ways, and is 
alternately, and somewhat confusingly, labeled either Edit Colors or Recolor 
Artwork.
Where is Live Color?
Although there isn’t actually anything actually labeled “Live Color” in Illustrator, 
Adobe uses the term to discuss the feature set that lets you interactively work with 
color in Illustrator.
If you have nothing selected, you enter a mode called Edit Colors. You can access this 
mode by clicking the Edit Colors icon at the bottom of the Color Guide panel. Once 
you’re in the Edit Colors dialog, you’ll be in Edit mode, which means that you can 
mix and store colors (see the following section for specific instructions on how to do 
this). You’ll see a tab next to the word “Edit” titled “Assign,” but it will be grayed out; 
since you don’t have any objects selected, you can’t access this tab. You can only 
assign colors to selected objects.
Enter the Edit Color/Recolor Artwork dialog from the Control pan-
el (top) or from the Color Guide panel (bottom)
318

If, however, you have artwork selected, this dialog will now be titled “Recolor 
Artwork,” and you will have access to the Assign tab of the dialog, as well as Edit 
mode. As long as your selection contains at least two colors, you’ll see the Recolor 
Artwork icon in the Control panel. Another option is the icon at the bottom of the 
Color Guide panel mentioned above; note, though, that when artwork is selected this 
icon will now be called “Edit or Apply Colors.” In the Swatches panel, with a color 
group selected, you can click the Edit or Apply Color Group icon. A final way into this 
dialog is Edit> Edit Colors> Recolor Artwork.
The Recoloring Artwork (and Editing Color) dialogs
After selecting the object(s) you want to recolor, click the Recolor Artwork button in 
the Control panel to open the Recolor Artwork dialog; the colors from your selected 
art should still be all in order, and the selection edges will automatically be hidden. If 
you enter the Recolor Artwork dialog via Color Guide’s Edit or Apply Colors icon, 
your image will initially appear with the color group in that panel assigned to your 
artwork. If that’s not what you intended, click the “Get colors from selected art” icon 
to reload the original colors into your artwork. In fact, any time you want to quickly 
return to your original colors without canceling the dialog, simply click again on the 
“Get colors from selected art” icon.
The Edit Color/Recolor Artwork dialog
319

Live Color shows a base color and active colors at the top, with a pop-up menu 
showing several of Adobe’s Harmony Rules, just as the Color Guide panel does. You 
can drag colors within the Active Colors field to reorder them, and your selected 
object(s) will be recolored according to their new positions. To change the base color, 
simply select another color from among the active colors.
You can do a number of things in the upper portion of the Recolor 
Artwork dialog, including set the current col-
or as the base color (on the left), choose from 
Harmony Rules (the arrow pop-up menu), 
and rename Color Groups (says “Artwork 
colors” above); from the upper right you can 
reload the colors from your artwork
The Color Groups section lists any color groups you saved in your Swatches panel 
before you entered the Recolor Artwork/Edit Colors dialog, as well as any color 
groups you created during this work session by clicking on the New Color Groups 
icon. Rename a color group by double-clicking on its name and entering a new one in 
the pop-up dialog. Clicking on any color group loads those colors into your artwork. 
Deleting and creating new color groups in the Recolor Artwork dialog will also delete 
and add color groups in your Swatches panel, so don’t click the Trash icon unless 
you’re positive you want to delete that color group from your document entirely. If 
you create color groups you want to save during a work session, but don’t want to 
apply the changes to your artwork, disable the Recolor Art checkbox and click OK. If 
you click Cancel, all the work you did creating (or deleting) new color groups will be 
deleted.
The center-right section of the Edit Colors/Recolor Artwork dialog 
has more powerful mini icons for 
“Save changes to color group,” “New 
Color Group,” and “Delete Color 
Group”
320

The two main tabs are Edit and Assign. The Assign tab (only available with an active 
selection) displays horizontal color bars, with each long bar representing one of the 
colors in the artwork currently selected. To their right is an arrow pointing to a 
smaller color swatch that’s initially the same color as the larger bar. This small 
swatch is where you can load or mix a replacement color. To protect a color from 
change, click on the arrow to turn it into a straight bar. You can drag and drop colors 
within this area; you can also access context-sensitive menus.
In Assign mode, these icons (circled) allow for merging, 
separating, excluding, and adding new color 
rows; you can also randomly change color 
order, saturation, and brightness, as well as 
ﬁnd a particular color in your artwork
321

The Edit tab contains a color wheel with markers representing the colors in the 
selected artwork. Depending on whether the Lock icon is enabled or disabled, you 
can move the markers around on the color wheel individually (unlocked) or in  
unison (locked) to adjust the color in your art. You can also click the display icons to 
select a segmented wheel or a bar view. In addition to dragging markers on the color 
wheel, you can use the sliders and controls just below the color wheel to adjust the 
various aspects of color (hue, saturation, and value). You can work in the standard 
color modes, or you can choose Global Adjust to affect all colors at once. As you 
adjust individual colors with the sliders, notice that the color marker you selected 
will also move on the color wheel as you move a slider.
On either the Assign or Edit tabs, you can choose to limit colors to a swatch library 
such as a Pantone library using the “Limits the color group to colors in a swatch 
library” icon. On the Assign tab, you have a Preset list and a Color Reduction Options 
icon for restricting the colors that can be reassigned. When you restrict your colors 
to a swatch library, the color wheel or bar on the Edit tab displays only the library’s 
colors, while Assign mode will replace all your original colors with those from the 
library that it thinks are the closest match.
In Edit or Assign mode, clicking the miniature grid-like icon 
(the“Limits the color group to colors in a 
swatch library” icon highlighted here) will 
present a pop-up menu of swatch libraries
The Color Reduction Options icon (under the Assign tab in Recolor 
Artwork)
322

The Presets on the Assign tab also help you limit the number of colors in your 
palette to 1, 2, or 3. This makes Live Color a huge timesaver when you need to 
reduce the number of colors used in a full-color project so it can be printed 
with spot colors, or even need to reduce a 3-color spot color job to 1 or 2. Use 
the Color Reduction Options to further determine how tints, shades, and 
neutrals are handled when colors get reassigned.
The Color Reduction Options icon opens this dialog
Live Color swatches & brushes
Using Live Color to edit brushes, patterns, or gradients automatically saves new 
versions of these into the appropriate panel. Using Live Color to edit Symbols, 
without breaking the link, updates the Symbols themselves.
Special color sets
If your work requires that you use a very specific set of colors, such as team colors 
or specific “designer” hues for a season, you’ll want to first create and save a Color 
Group (or groups) in the Swatches panel. Then, when you open Live Color, your 
Color Groups will be in the storage area, ready to recolor your artwork.
The power of Recolor Artwork
One of the many powerful capabilities of the Live Color toolset is the ability to 
globally change the colors of almost any kind of colored object in your Illustrator 
artwork. Colors in envelopes, meshes, symbols, brushes, patterns, raster effects (but 
not RGB/CMYK raster images), and in multiple fill and stroke objects can all be 
easily re-colored with the Recolor Artwork dialog. —Jean-Claude Tremblay
323

you quickly spot which is active or drag a swatch into the panel. At the top right of 
the panel you can set whether to view your swatches as a list or as thumbnails. 
Clicking on either one sets that view to the default Small size list or thumbnail. 
Although you can enlarge the view from the panel menu, clicking either thumbnail 
resets that view back to Small.
Finding your swatches
You can now search in both the Swatches panel and the Color Swatch section of the 
Color Picker for named color swatches or one that has a specific percentage of an ink. 
Type the name of a swatch (such as Khaki) or, if the swatch is unnamed, a percentage 
of ink (75) or a percentage of a specific ink (c=75) in the Find field for the Swatches 
panel or Color Picker, and the results will display only those swatches that match 
your criterion. (To initially show the Find field in the Swatches panel, choose Show 
Find Field from the pop-up menu.) If your criterion matches a swatch contained in 
different groups, the Swatches panel displays the swatches with their group icons. 
This can help you locate a specific palette that contains a named color, ink 
percentage, or a specific ink.
The Swatches panel displaying Swatch proxy icons and List and 
Thumbnail view icons, as well as the Find 
Field, which allows you to search for un-
named swatches that share a speciﬁed CMYK 
or RGB ink, a speciﬁed percentage of any ink 
(such as 50), or a named color.

Custom Coloring
Creating Custom Colors & Color Groups
Overview: Create an illustration; create custom swatches; create a custom color group from 
custom swatches; save a swatch library.
Ryan Putnam designs many illustrations he uses as icons in stock art and client 
projects. Creating custom swatches is an integral step in creating compelling and 
consistent icon illustrations. Illustrator comes with some great default color 
swatches, but they are not suited for most of Putnam’s icon illustrations. Moreover, 
by creating a custom color group, Putnam can easily apply his custom swatches to 
other related illustrations.
1 Creating an icon illustration. To create the “Destination” icon, Putnam used the Rec-
tangle tool, Ellipse tool, and Pencil tool. Putnam first created the buildings of the 
icon with varying sizes of rectangles with the Rectangle tool. He then used the Ellipse 
tool to create windows and awnings for the buildings. Next, he used the Pencil tool to 
draw the mountains. To distinguish the objects from each other, Putnam filled the 
building and mountain paths with default swatches from the Swatches panel by se-
lecting each object and clicking the desired swatch.

tool
327

2 
Creating custom swatches. After Putnam roughed out the basic color schemes for his 
illustration, he then began to customize a more natural set of colors. First, he made 
sure the Color panel was set to the same color mode as his Document Color Mode. 
Since Putnam is creating his icon for a website and his Document Color Mode is 
RGB, from the Color panel pop-up menu he chose RGB. Putnam then selected an 
ob-ject and mixed the desired color with the sliders in the Color panel. Next, he 
opened the Swatches panel and clicked the New Swatch icon in the bottom of the 
panel. In the Swatch Options dialog he then named the swatch and clicked OK. 
Alternatively, you can choose Create New Swatch from the Color panel popup menu. 
Yet another option is to drag the mixed color directly to the Swatches panel, though 
by doing so, you won’t get Swatch Options and the opportunity to name the swatch. 
Putnam then repeated these steps for every custom color he wanted to create.
2
Selecting the correct color mode from the Color panel’s pop-up 
menu
3 Creating a new color group. After creating his custom swatches, Putnam wanted to 
organize his custom swatches so he could easily apply them to other related illustra-
tions and icons. To do this, he created a custom color group. He selected the desired 
swatches in the Swatches panel by Shift-clicking to select contiguous swatches, or by 
holding 
/Ctrl and clicking for non-contiguous selections. Then he clicked the New 
Color Group icon, where he was given the option to name his color group. The new 
color group was then saved for Putnam and ready for use.
3
Saving custom swatches as a new color group in the Swatches panel
328

To use his custom color group in other documents, Putnam needed to save the color 
group as a custom swatch library. First, he selected all the swatches he wanted to 
delete from his custom color group and clicked the Delete Swatch icon in the 
Swatches panel. Putnam then clicked the Swatch Libraries menu icon at the lower 
left of the Swatches panel, chose Save Swatches, named it, and clicked OK. This 
saved Putnam’s swatch library so it’s accessible to Illustrator via the Swatch Libraries 
menu icon; by scrolling to the bottom of the menu, he can easily access his custom 
swatches library under the User Defined submenu.

GORDON/CARTAGRAM, LLC/Seattle Southside Visitor Services
Scripting Colors
Tools for Adding and Editing Colors
Overview: Use Premedia Systems WOW! Artwork Colorizer script to automatically ﬁll 
shapes with color; browse and download color themes with the Kuler panel; assign and edit a 
color group with the Recolor Artwork dialog.
Coloring adjacent areas is a common task in making maps—you click each area and 
fill it with a color. But when there are dozens of areas, special tools can help you 
perform this task quickly and effectively. For this map of Seattle Southside, Steven 
Gordon used Premedia Systems’ (www.premediasystems.com) WOW! Artwork 
Colorizer script (included on WOW! ONLINE) and Illustrator’s Kuler and Live Color 
panels to fill cities with distinctive colors.
1 Creating the map areas and using a script to ﬁll them with different colors. Gordon started 
the map by importing GIS data using Avenza MAPublisher plug-ins. Once imported, 
the data produced a layer with 37 cities, each with a black stroke and no fill. You can 
fill areas with different colors automatically using Premedia Systems’ WOW! 
Artwork Colorizer script (this script and its installation instructions, are on WOW! 
ONLINE; install the script before starting or restarting Illustrator). To fill the areas 
using the script, choose File> Scripts. From the script’s dialog, leave the default 
option No Col-ors selected (new colors will be created from scratch) and click OK. 
The script will automatically fill your shapes with colors.

2 Creating a color group using Kuler. Gordon wanted to reduce the 37 unique colors cre-
ated by the script to a handful of swatches that could be shared among the cities. He 
decided to tap into the vast collection of color groups (or “themes”) from Adobe’s on-
line Kuler application. You can access Kuler by opening the Kuler panel (Window> 
Extensions> Kuler). If you don’t find a satisfactory theme navigating the panel, go to 
kuler.adobe.com and create your own, as Gordon did. If you create a theme, give it a 
unique title, select Public, and click Save.

3 Importing a Kuler theme as a color group and editing its colors. With his color theme, 
“Seattle Southside,” available on the Kuler website, Gordon added it to the Swatches 
panel using the Kuler panel. To do this, browse themes in the Kuler panel or find one 
(including one you’ve created) by typing its name in the Search field. With the theme 
selected, click the “Add selected theme to swatches” icon. Now your theme is avail-
able as a color group in the Swatches panel.
Gordon applied the new color group by selecting all the cities and then double-
clicking on the color group’s folder icon in the Swatches panel to display the Recolor 
Artwork dialog. When the dialog displayed, it automatically recolored his selected 
artwork using the color group he double-clicked. Gordon wanted to fill the cities with 
the exact colors in his group and avoid using tints. You can limit colors by clicking 
the arrow on the right of any of the color rows to bring up the New Color pop-up 
menu and then choosing Exact.

pop-up arrow icon and menu
As you work, you may wish to edit your colors. Gordon decided to lighten the colors 
in his group so they wouldn’t interfere with the legibility of symbols and small type. 
To change the colors in your artwork, click on the Edit tab in the Recolor Artwork 
dialog. Lighten or darken colors by moving all of the circular color icons together 
(with harmony colors linked) or individually (with harmony colors unlinked) 
toward or away from the center. You can add another color to the group by clicking 
the Add Color tool. When you’re done editing the colors, you can save the changes 
to your group or save them as a new color group. Finally, click OK to exit the 
Recolor Artwork dialog and return to your artwork.

Using Kuler, Image Trace, & Live Color
Overview: Trace a photograph with Image Trace; recolor artwork using a downloaded Kuler 
color theme; recolor color with Live Color; create and upload a color group; use a photograph 
to add detail; use artwork to mask a photograph; create a ﬂare.
How can you enhance a photograph of a beautiful flower? Steven Gordon sought the 
answer with Illustrator’s Image Trace and Live Color tools—and a trip to Adobe’s 
Kuler website—in making this vibrant advertisement for a botanical garden.
1 Tracing a photograph, expanding the tracing, and moving artwork to new layers. Gordon 
began by placing a photograph of a calendula flower in Illustrator. Because he want-
ed to simplify the photograph, Gordon decided to posterize the image by tracing it. 
To do this, he chose Objects> Live Trace> Tracing Options. In the Tracing Options 
dialog, he chose the preset “6 Colors” from the Preset menu, and then modified the 
settings by changing Max Colors to 5. Knowing that he would need to select and ma-
nipulate some of the traced artwork later, he expanded the trace (Object> Live 
Trace> Expand) and ungrouped the artwork. Then he added two layers in the Layers 
panel, one for the green shapes and the other for the orange shapes. He selected and 
moved all of the green and orange shapes to their respective layers.

2 Browsing Kuler, downloading a color group, and recoloring the traced artwork. After re-
viewing the traced artwork, Gordon decided to make the traced green leaves and 
stems more vivid. For inspiration, he opened the Kuler panel (Window> Extensions> 
Kuler; in CC it’s Window> Kuler) and browsed the color themes for one with a vari-
ety of bright greens. Instead of recreating its colors using the Color panel, he down-
loaded the theme to the Swatches panel as a color group by clicking the Kuler panel’s 
“Add selected theme to swatches” icon. Next he selected all of the green artwork and 
double-clicked on the color group he had just downloaded. In the Assign panel of the 
Recolor Artwork dialog, Gordon needed to assign three of the color group’s five col-
ors to the three greens that had been produced by Live Trace. With Recolor Art en-
abled he then clicked the “Randomly change color order” icon several times until the 
green shapes in the illustration looked the way he liked, then clicked OK.

To preserve the traced artwork’s colors, Gordon selected all of the green and orange 
artwork and clicked the Swatch panel’s New Color Group icon.
3 Adding detail, brightening the ﬂower center, and creating and uploading a color group.
With the traced artwork colored, Gordon wanted to bring some of the original photo-
graph’s detail back into the illustration. He created a layer above the traced artwork 
and placed a copy of the photograph. Selecting the photograph, he opened the Trans-
parency panel and set opacity to 50% and the blending mode to Hard Light.
3
On the left, the ﬂower petals after tracing; on the right, the ﬂower 
petals overlaid with the photograph set to 
50% opacity and Hard Light
Because the focal point of the illustration was the flow-er’s center, Gordon wanted to 
employ the photograph’s full color and detail. He created a new layer and placed 
another copy of the original photograph on it. Then, from the layer with the traced 
green shapes, he clicked the Lasso tool and selected the green center shapes. He 
copied and pasted them in place and turned them into a compound path (Object> 
Compound Path> Make). After moving the compound path to the layer with the 
photograph, Gordon selected both and chose Object> Clipping Mask> Make. Finally, 
he brightened the center by drawing a flare with the Flare tool, opened the 
Transparency panel and changed the flare’s blending mode to Soft Light. He finished 
by adding type to the illustration.

Unified Gradients
Creating & Editing with Pen & Pencil Modiﬁers
Overview: Fill objects with gradients; use the Gradient tool with the Gradient Annotator 
to adjust ﬁll length and angle; unify ﬁlls across multiple objects with the Gradient tool and 
Gra-dient panel. 
340

Using the Gradient Annotator in conjunction with the Gradient tool, in many 
instances you’ll be able to customize gradients without having to use the Gradient 
panel at all. In this illustration, Dave Joly only needed the Gradient panel to switch 
between Linear and Radial gradients, and to work with creating unified gradients. To 
control the colors, length, and angle of gradients for individual objects, Joly adjusted 
each gradient with the Gradient Annotator. He unified gradients across multiple 
objects using the Gradient tool and Gradient panel.
1 Applying gradients. To apply a gradient to a single object, such as the fish’s body, 
Joly first made sure that the Gradient Annotator toggle was visible (if View> Show 
Gradient Annotator is available, choose it). Next he selected an object and the Gradi-
ent tool, and then clicked once on the object to fill it with either the document’s de-
fault gradient (for the first object) or with the last gradient used in the document.

Working with the Gradient panel, Gradient tool, and Gradient An-
notator
2 Editing single objects with the Gradient Annotator. Joly was able to edit a gradient al-
most exclusively using the Gradient Annotator. With the Annotator, he could modify 
the gradient length, angle, and colors on the object itself. He only needed to turn to 
the Gradient panel to choose a different existing gradient swatch, switch the current 
gradient between linear and radial gradient in Type, or reverse the gradient. Joly be-
gan his edits by moving his cursor just beyond the arrow endpoint of the Gradient 
Annotator. When his cursor turned into the Rotate icon, he dragged to interactively 
set the angle he wanted the gradient to take. With his cursor directly on top of the ar-
row end, he click-dragged to lengthen or shorten the gradient, and he dragged on the 
large circle at the other end to move the whole gradient to another position over the 
object. To adjust the colors, Joly double-clicked on a color stop along the Annotator, 
which gave him immediate access to proxies for both the Swatches and the Color 
panels, and a subset of the Gradient panel, as well. After choosing a suitable color, he 
dragged the stops on the Annotator to position the color blends more precisely, and 
on the gradient sliders to adjust their blend.
341

2
A single click with the Gradient tool on a selected object ﬁlls the 
object with either the default or last-used 
gradient swatch, and displays the Gradient 
Annotator, if selected in the View menu (be 
sure you don’t click and drag when applying 
for the ﬁrst time—you can click-drag to ad-
just the gradient later)
3 Unifying gradients across multiple objects. Unifying gradients across multiple objects 
is a bit trickier with the Gradient Annotator involved. Joly first created the gradient 
swatch he would need—for the tail fins, for example. Next he selected all the objects 
and clicked on the swatch in the Swatches panel to apply it. This automatically creat-
ed a new Gradient Annotator for every object, but Joly wanted to unify the gradients 
under just one Annotator. Still using the Gradient tool with the Gradient Annotator 
visible, Joly dragged across all the objects. This now appeared to unify the multiple 
gradients under one Annotator, but it’s then only possible to change the length or po-
sition of the unifying gradient. Instead, while adjusting one gradient that had been 
unified across multiple objects, Joly discovered the Gradient Annotator wasn’t pro-
viding reliable feedback or controls. Therefore, when working with one unified gradi-
ent applied to multiple objects, instead of relying on the Gradient Annotator, he 
would ignore or hide the Annotator (Window> Hide Gradient Annotator). Joly sim-
ply used a combination of the Gradient tool (to make length and angle adjustments 
to the unified gradient) and the Gradient panel itself (for numeric precision, adjust-
ments to color stops, and opacity).

Annotator color stops to pop up both the Col-

343

Uniﬁed gradients sometimes appear to retain the function of the 
Gradient Annotator, but if you attempt to edit 
angles or colors with the Gradient 
Annotator, you’ll discover you aren’t actual-
ly editing a single gradient
By using only the Gradient panel and/or the Gradient tool to edit 
uniﬁed gradients, you ensure that all changes will be 
made in unison

MCGARRY
Gradient Paths
The Basics of Gradients on a Path
Overview: Create paths using strokes; apply linear gradients to each path; adjust gradient 
sliders and Stroke options.
This power cord was created by San Diego-based illustrator Aaron McGarry, using 
gradients applied to strokes.
1 Creating the cord using strokes. McGarry drew each section of the power cord sepa-
rately using the Pen tool, then he increased the stroke weight for each section: the ex-
posed copper wires, the insulation, and the cord jacket. He also used the Ellipse tool 
to create the coiled section of the cord and duplicated the ellipse a few times.
345

1
The separate parts of the power cord drawn using the Pen tool, in-
creasing the stroke weight for each section: 7 
pt for the wire, 12 pt for the insulation, and 
40 pt for the jacket
2 Applying gradients to strokes. McGarry applied gradients to his paths using the Gra-
dient panel chosen from Swatch Libraries> Gradients. The copper wire, for example, 
used a copper gradient from the Gradients> Metals library. In the Stroke area of the 
Gradient panel, he chose “Apply gradient across stroke” (the third option) and then 
adjusted it using the slider. He also used this option for the insulation and cord jack-
et. Since the live and neutral plug prongs were flat straight edges, he chose “Apply 
gradient along stroke” (the middle Stroke option) and moved the lightest stop on the 
slider to the left to indicate where the prong turns at the tip. He duplicated these 
prongs and used Paste in Place to put a copy on top. He then applied a Gradient> 
Fades swatch to darken the end of these prongs but still expose the brass beneath, 
creating a more natural transition than darkening alone. For the plug body end he 
drew the contour with the Pen tool and applied an orange gradient to the stroke and 
the fill; he adjusted the stroke gradient to indicate a soft edge transition.

Darren
When Darren (Winder) saw a guitar he liked in a store window, he decided to 
reconstruct it in Illustrator with photorealistic detail. He began by constructing the 
basic shape and using Image Trace to add wood texture to the guitar, then created 
some wood-toned gradients. To mimic directional light and add an edge to the 
guitar progressing from dark to light, he created two paths outlining the body, then 
applied a gradient stroke to each path. To do this, Darren selected a path and 
targeted its Stroke attribute in the Appearance panel, clicked the Stroke color icon, 
and chose his gradient. With the path still selected, he opened the Gradient panel 
and chose the ﬁrst Stroke option (Apply gradient within stroke). This stretched the 
gradient the length of the path.
For the guitar’s sound hole, he again used gradients applied within the stroke, this 
time using multiple strokes on a path. Using the Appearance panel, he clicked the 
New Stroke icon, which created a stroke below the ﬁrst in the same style as the one 
selected (if no attribute is selected, strokes will be added above the others). 
Clicking on the Stroke swatch, he chose the lighter wood gradient and enlarged the 
stroke weight. He then continued to add alternating dark and light strokes, adjusting 
weights to create concentric dark and light circles from one path.

JACKMORE
Bending Mesh
Converting Gradients to Mesh for Editing
Overview: Draw objects and ﬁll with linear gradients; expand gradient-ﬁlled objects into 
gradient meshes; use various tools to edit mesh points and colors.
For many images, gradients can be useful for showing the gradual change of light to 
shadow (if you need to learn more about creating and applying gradient fills, first see 
“Unified Gradients,” earlier in this chapter). For her rolling hills, artist Lisa 
Jackmore expanded linear gradients into gradient mesh objects so she could better 
control the curves and contours of the color transitions.
1 Drawing objects and then ﬁlling them with linear gradients. Begin your illustration by 
creating closed objects with any of the drawing tools. After drawing each object, fill it 
with a linear gradient (although in some objects radial gradients might look better 
before you convert them to mesh objects, linear gradients create mesh objects that 
are much easier to edit). For each linear gradient, customize the colors, and adjust 
the angle and length of the gradient transition with the Gradient tool and Gradient 
Annotator until you can best approximate the desired lighting effect. Jackmore creat-
ed three hill-shaped objects with the Pen tool, filled them with the same linear gradi-
ent, then customized each with the Gradient tool and Annotator.
349

1
The hills shown ﬁlled with radial gradients—although there is 
some sense of light, it isn’t possible to make 
the radial gradient follow the contours of the 
hills
2 Expanding linear gradients into gradient meshes. To create a more natural lighting of 
the hills, Jackmore converted the linear gradients into mesh objects so the color 
transitions could follow the contours of the hills. To accomplish this, select all the 
gradient-filled objects that you wish to convert and choose Object> Expand. In the 
Expand dialog, make sure Fill is enabled and specify Expand Gradient to Gradient 
Mesh. Then click OK. Illustrator converts each linear gradient into a rectangle rotat-
ed to the angle matching the linear gradient’s angle; each mesh rectangle is masked 
by the original object (see the Mastering Complexity chapter for help with masks).
350

2
After expanding the gradients into gradient mesh objects
3 Editing meshes. You can use several tools to edit gradient mesh objects (use isolation 
mode, or lock/hide objects on specific layers as you work). The Mesh tool combines 
the functionality of the Direct Selection tool with the ability to add mesh lines. With 
the Mesh tool, click exactly on a mesh anchor point to select or move that point or its 
direction handles. Or, click anywhere within a mesh, except on an anchor point, to 
add a new mesh point and gridline. You can also use the Add Anchor Point tool (click 
and hold to choose it from the Pen tool pop-up) to add a point without a gridline. To 
delete a selected anchor point, press the Delete key; if that point is a mesh point, the 
gridlines will be deleted as well.
3
Using the Mesh tool to add a mesh line, then moving the 
mesh point with the Direct Selection tool 
351

Select points within the mesh using either the Mesh tool or the Lasso tool, using the 
Direct Selection tool to move multiple selected points. Move individual anchor points 
and adjust direction handles with the Mesh tool in order to reshape your gradient 
mesh gridlines. In this way, the color and tonal transitions of the gradient will match 
the contour of the mesh object. Recolor selected areas of the mesh by selecting 
points, then choosing a new color.
Using the Add Anchor Point tool, using the Lasso to select a point, 
moving selected point (or points) with the 
Direct Selection tool
If you hold Option/Alt while you click in the area between mesh points with the 
Eyedropper tool, you’ll add the Fill color to the four nearest mesh points.
By using these tools and editing techniques, Jackmore was able to create hills with 
color and light variations that suggest the subtlety of natural light upon the contours 
of organic forms.

to gradient meshes are easier to edit than radial gradients

PAIDRICK
Transparent Mesh
Molding Transparent Mesh Layers
Advanced Technique
Overview: Draw guides and create gradient mesh objects; contour rectangles; color gradient 
mesh points with color sampled from reference photo; apply transparency to individual mesh 
points to create realism.
Ann Paidrick transformed simple rectangular objects into complex, contoured 
gradient mesh objects to create an exact representation of an original photograph. By 
incorporating actual transparency into her mesh objects, she is able to reuse the 
finished vase in other settings (see the gallery following this lesson).
1 Creating guides, drawing basic shapes, then creating gradient mesh objects. Placing her 
JPG as a template into layers above, Paidrick drew a loose grid of paths and then 
turned them into guides (
-5/Ctrl-5) to help position her gradient mesh objects. 
353

Paidrick finds that adding a mesh to a rectangle, which she then reshapes, gives her 
more control over mesh points than if she added mesh to a path drawn with the Pen 
tool. Therefore, she always begins her gradient mesh objects by drawing one small 
rectangle with the Rectangle tool. To create the red globe portion of the vase, she 
drew a rectangle, filled it with a bright color, chose Object> Create Gradient Mesh, 
and specified 1 row, 1 column. With the Direct Selection tool (A), she moved points to 
stretch the rectangle to the edges of the vase base, and eventually the top and 
bottom. With the Gradient mesh tool (U), she added more rows and columns. She 
continued to enlarge the mesh object and contour it into the desired shape by press-
ing U to add mesh points, then A to adjust the points. Paidrick added individual 
mesh points with the Add Anchor Point tool to further define the shape of the object. 
She Direct-Selected points and made adjustments to refine the contour of the object 
and its mesh to closely follow the shading of her reference photo.

2 Coloring the mesh objects. To color individual mesh points, Paidrick clicked on a 
mesh point with the Direct Selection tool (A), then switched to the Eyedropper tool 
(I) and filled that point with a color sampled from the photograph. She continued to 
color the mesh points by pressing 
/Ctrl to temporarily switch to the Direct Selec-
tion tool from the Eyedropper tool, picking up color from the photo, until a pixel in 
the photograph matched the color she wanted.
354

Coloring mesh points and sampling color from the reference photo-
graph
3 Applying transparency to individual mesh points. For effects such as reflections, she 
created additional mesh objects on layers above. She then selected individual points 
in the upper mesh objects and reduced the opacity, creating nearly invisible transi-
tions between different mesh objects on layers above and below. She also reduced the 
opacity of individual mesh points to create smooth color transitions between more- 
and less-saturated colors (see bottom figure). To do this she first Direct-Selected a 
point, then reduced the Opacity in the Control, Transparency, or Appearance panels. 
She continued to choose mesh points and use various transparency settings through-
out the illustration until she had matched the color of the reference photo as closely 
as possible.

PAIDRICK
Ann Paidrick
To explore combining a pattern swatch with mesh to simulate drapery folds, Ann 
Paidrick used Illustrator’s Pattern Editing features to make a seamless, swirling 
design on a transparent background. She next created a gradient swatch, adding 
many stops in a range of values to mimic drapery. To add vibrancy to the gradient, 
she adjusted not only values but the hue and saturation of the main color. Paidrick 
ﬁlled a rectangle with the gradient and then, to ensure that the pattern would 
“disappear” into the darkest folds of the drapery, she colored the swirls of the 
transparent pattern the same color as the darkest color in the gradient.
357

In order to distort the pattern to match the folds, she needed to create an expanded 
version of the pattern, trimmed to the dimension of the “curtain” gradient. To do this, 
she chose Object> Expand, kept Fill enabled, and clicked OK. The expanded 
pattern consisted of both the portion clipped within the rectangle shape and of 
repeating pattern elements extending beyond the clipping mask. To work with only 
the pattern elements inside the rectangle, and with the expanded pattern selected, 
she chose Trim in the Pathﬁnder panel, deleting excess pattern objects. The pattern 
now trimmed to the correct dimensions, she chose Object> Envelope Distort> Make 
with Mesh, using 4 rows and roughly three times as many columns. Using the Direct 
Selection tool, she marquee-selected several rows at a time and dragged them until 
the pattern matched the “folds” in the gradient. She adjusted individual points to 
wiggle the mesh, until she succeeded in melding the pattern with the drapes.
358

PAIDRICK
Ann Paidrick
Ann Paidrick enhanced her vase illustration from the previous lesson by adding the 
patterned pear wallpaper to the background. Paidrick locked all the layers of the 
ﬁnished vase and, on a new layer beneath these locked layers, placed a 
photograph of the wallpaper (saved as JPG) as the background. With the Pen tool, 
she drew rough outlines where the distorted pears would be, and then turned these 
outlines into guides (
-5/Ctrl-5). On a separate layer above the background 
wallpaper, she placed another photo of the wallpaper, this time one that she had 
cropped in Photoshop to ﬁt between the top and bottom of the clear glass.
359

In order to use an Illustrator envelope to distort the cropped part of the photo, she 
had to ﬁrst embed the photo by selecting the Embed icon in the Control panel. 
Paidrick then chose Object> Envelope Distort> Make with Mesh (6 rows, 8 
columns). She used the Direct Selection tool to adjust the envelope mesh object 
into the shape of the interior of the glass. To add more rows and columns, Paidrick 
clicked with the Gradient Mesh tool and added additional mesh points with the Add 
Anchor Point tool. She continued to adjust the mesh points, referring to her guides 
until she was satisﬁed with the distortion results. To make the envelope mesh object 
ﬁt into the vase shape, on a new layer above, she drew a closed path with the Pen 
tool, selected the envelope mesh object, then chose Object> Clipping Mask> 
Make.

KING
Steve King
U-Haul celebrates history and natural science with eye-catching images they call 
“Super-Graphics” displayed on their moving vans. Illustrator Steve King mixes 
intricate details with simpliﬁed shapes in this image of the H.L. Hunley, a Civil War 
submarine. King relied on the Gradient tool to create lighting effects and simulate 
the transparency of a see-through illustration. He employed a darkening orange-to-
blue gradient ﬁll on the submarine from the captain’s lantern backward to the 
propeller. The Gradient tool gave King the economy of creating a few gradients that 
he reused as ﬁlls for different objects. To illustrate the faces of four of the seated 
sailors, King drew shapes that he ﬁlled with the same gradient. He used the 
Gradient tool’s Annotator to customize the length and angle of each sailor’s 
gradient, which helped tie them together visually while keeping their shapes 
distinct.
361

MIYAMOTO
362

Yukio Miyamoto
Yukio Miyamoto created the numerous complex linear and radial gradients 
throughout this illustration with ease using the Gradient tool and the Gradient 
Annotator. Miyamoto drew each path with the Pen tool and ﬁlled it either with the 
default linear or radial gradient from the Swatches panel. He selected the Gradient 
tool to reveal the Gradient Annotator, which appeared on top of the object.
Miyamoto double-clicked on the color stop of the Gradient Annotator to show the 
options. He clicked on the Swatches icon and chose a custom color from the 
Swatches panel that he had previously created to color the stop. Miyamoto clicked 
along the Gradient Annotator to add more color stops. He continued to add color 
stops and color them until he was satisﬁed with the results. Miyamoto click-dragged 
the color stops and moved them into the exact locations to achieve the desired 
gradient effect.
363

He grabbed the arrow endpoint and stretched the Gradient Annotator to change the 
length of the gradient. Miyamoto moved the endpoint side to side and adjusted the 
angle of the gradient. He made additional angular adjustments with the circular 
endpoint and clicked the center point, then moved it to various positions within the 
gradient-ﬁlled object. The entire illustration is made of gradient-ﬁlled objects with 
two very small exceptions; there is one blended object (the pen tip) and one mesh 
object (grip area, just beneath the tip). The Gradient Annotator enabled Miyamoto to 
have exceptional control of the gradient ﬁlls to achieve exacting realism.
REINHART
Recolor a Pattern
Creating Variations on a Color Palette
Advanced Technique
364

Overview: Edit a pattern swatch using Recolor Artwork; use the Assign tab to create varia-
tions on a single color group; save new pattern swatches and color groups.
Using Illustrator’s Recolor Artwork (RA) you can start with any pattern, even a 
highly complex one created using a pre-determined color palette, and quickly 
experiment with different colorways by reordering the assignment of the same 
colors, or by generating, applying, and saving a new palette of colors. Sabine 
Reinhart creates color groups with the number of colors she needs, then lets Recolor 
Artwork help her develop a new colorway.
1 Entering Recolor Artwork while in Pattern Editing Mode (PEM). Find a pattern swatch 
to experiment with and duplicate it (drag the swatch to the New Swatch icon in the 
Swatches panel). If you didn’t save your original colors as a color group and want 
easy access to the group, fill an object with the pattern, and while it’s still selected, 
click on the New Color Group icon and enable Selected Artwork. Now, double-click 
on the pattern swatch to enter PEM, disable Dim Copies for easier evaluation, and 
Select All (
-A/Ctrl-A). To enter RA with your original colors intact, click on the Re-
color Artwork icon in the Control panel. If instead you wish to enter RA with a color 
group already applied to your pattern, enter via the Swatches panel—click on the icon 
for a color group, then on the “Edit or Apply Color Group” icon at the bottom of the 
panel. (If the new color group doesn’t contain as many colors as the original, RA re-
duces the number of colors, turning multiple color assignments into a single color.)
1
Using a selected color group to activate the icon for entering Re-
color Artwork (alternately, click on the Re-
color Artwork icon in the Control panel to 
open the dialog without affecting the original 
color assignment)
365

2 Creating a variation on the palette. Once in RA, to vary the color assignment for 
your pattern—but not allow RA to alter the actual hues, tints, or shades—click on 
the Color Reduction icon and choose Exact for the Recolor Method. Get inspiration 
for differ-ent colorways by clicking on the “Randomly change color order” icon at 
the bottom of the New column. Although your colors stay the same, they are 
applied to different objects in the pattern. There’s no Undo in RA to recover a 
colorway, so when you see potential, consider saving your color group in RA, or 
click OK, then save a new pat-tern with Save a Copy in PEM (see below). To further 
modify the assignment of col-ors, drag one new color over another to swap them. 
You also can drag a color from the Current Colors column into the New column to 
restore an original assignment. Click the “Randomly changes saturation and 
brightness” icon (beneath the New col-umn), to create even greater variation 
between your original colorway and a new scheme that is still based on your 
original color group.

the pattern elements

same number of colors as the original, then

Naming color groups to keep them associated with their pattern 
swatch
3 Saving color groups and pattern swatches. Applying a saved color group will only give 
predictable results when applied to the original pattern (not the one you just 
created), so as you save a group in RA, be careful to include the name of the original 
pattern swatch in the color group’s name. To save a pattern variation, click OK in RA, 
then click Save a Copy on the Pattern Isolation Mode bar. Name your pattern in the 
pop-up, and from this point forward, that swatch will retain both the palette and the

MURRA
Sebastian Murra (Mu!)
Sebastian Murra’s highly abstract, organic, often edgy style seems tailor-made for 
smartphone cases. He used specs from the manufacturer CASE-MATE to begin with 
a correctly sized art-board for each device, although he only loosely observed the 
artboard size and orientation until the end. In fact, he made no attempt to restrain 
the art within the template, allowing it to ﬂow freely beyond the boundaries. Murra 
began this design, “Saturday Morning Cartoons,” by creating a palette inspired by 
the colors of fruity breakfast cereals for kids. He created several overlapping 
rectangles, each with a solid Fill and a very ﬁne Stroke, and used Illustrator’s Liquify 
tools, primarily Warp and Twirl, to push and pull the colored shapes into the swirling 
abstracts that are his signature style. He added contrast and depth by transforming 
a few black rectangles along with the fruit-colored ones. He used blending modes, 
especially Hard Light and Hue, to further integrate the swirling tangle of objects. 
368

He often modiﬁed objects with the Direct Selection tool, and used Recolor 
Artwork to alter or introduce colors. Later he rotated everything to its ﬁnal vertical 
orientation, then placed overlapping white rectangles on a layer above the 
artwork, which allowed him to experiment with different framing options until he 
found the right portion of the design that ﬁt within the required size. For the ﬁnal 
composition, he added a yellow-ﬁlled background layer and applied a yellow tint 
to all the lighter colors by adding another yellow-ﬁlled rectangle, set to Darken 
blending mode, on the top layer.

Ann Paidrick
After hours of intricately creating gradient mesh-based artwork, Ann Paidrick can 
quickly and easily change colors using Live Color. Because you can’t recover colors 
once you’ve changed them in Live Color, each time she wants to create a variant of 
her gold ribbon, she starts by duplicating the original artboard (in the Artboards 
panel she drags the gold ribbon artboard to the New Artboard icon). Selecting the 
new ribbon objects, she clicks the Edit Colors icon in the Control panel. Clicking on 
the Edit mode tab, she enables the Lock icon, then drags the Base Color circle in 
the color wheel (the largest circle) until she ﬁnds a color shift she likes, and clicks 
OK. Saving this ﬁle, she creates the next color variation from another copy of the 
original.

COYLE
Laura Coyle
It takes a herculean effort to organize a group of ﬁfth-grade students, but using 
keen organizational skills and the search features found in Illustrator’s Swatches 
panel, it became an easy task. Laura Coyle opened the Swatches panel, selected 
Show Find Field from the Swatches panel pop-up menu, then clicked on the Show 
List View icon. She created global swatches for each color and named them with 
meaningful names, matching up a character’s name with the descriptors such as 
line work, hair, or skin tone creating swatch names like Harriet Line work, Jason Skin 
tone, or Marc Hair (partial view of Swatches panel shown above). Coyle selected 
the color swatches by holding 
/Ctrl, then clicked on the New Color Group icon. 
She kept the default name, Color Group 1, and clicked OK. Coyle repeated the 
process, making a separate color group for the color swatches created for the 
clothing. Coyle ﬁrst drew a few of the main characters. To select and apply color to 
a character, Coyle typed one or more of the letters of the name in the ﬁnd ﬁeld, and 
when the name appeared in the Swatches panel (below left), she chose from the list 
of custom colors particular to that character (such as searching teal or denim for the 
clothing). These central characters would appear in several different scenes 
throughout the project, and by using descriptive labeling, Coyle easily found the 
color for each ﬁgure, and kept their coloring consistent throughout the various 
scenes. Later, when Coyle needed to create other ﬁgures different from the central 
characters, she mixed and matched the custom hair and skin tone color swatches. 
Coyle varied their looks by searching and applying speciﬁc color swatches in the 
color panel, but the overall look of the project was consistent because she used the 
same set of colors for the entire project.

7 Mastering Complexity

Reshaping Dimensions
Reshaping Dimensions
INTRODUCTION
This chapter focuses on the Illustrator tools and functions that allow you to create 
objects that appear to move beyond two-dimensional space. With warps and 
envelopes you can easily use familiar vector tools to bend and bow objects (and text) 
in two-dimensional space, and with envelope meshes you can begin to create an 
illusion of depth as well. Using Illustrator’s 3D effects you actually revolve, extrude, 
rotate, and map objects in three dimensions. Then, the Perspective Grid tool helps 
you to create art based on linear perspective using one, two, or three vanishing 
points. All of these demand a bit of a different mindset than flat Illustrator objects 
and the manipulating of the mesh. In their live states, 3D and the perspective grid 
work quite differently from other Illustrator objects. If you decide to expand the art, 
they become merely complex vector objects, letting you work upon them using any of 
Illustrator’s editing tools.
WARPS AND ENVELOPES
Warps and envelopes may look similar at first, but there’s an important difference 
between them. Warps are applied as live effects—meaning they can be applied to 
objects, groups, or layers. Warps have two advantages: They are easy to create by 
choosing from the predefined options in the Warp dialogs, and you can save them 
within a graphic style to apply them to other objects. Envelopes, on the other hand, 
are also live, but rather than effects, they’re actual objects that contain artwork. You 
can edit or customize the envelope shape, and Illustrator will conform the contents of 
the envelope to the contour.

Edit Envelope, Edit Contents, and Envelope 
Options
373

Warps
Applying a warp is actually quite simple. Target an object, group, or layer and choose 
Effect> Warp> Arc. (It doesn’t matter which warp effect you choose, because you’ll 
be presented with the Warp Options dialog, where you can choose from any of the 15 
different warps.) While the warp effects are “canned” in the sense that you can’t 
make adjustments to the effects directly, you can control how a warp appears by 
changing the Bend value, as well as the Horizontal and Vertical Distortion values.
The tools that appear in the Control panel when an envelope warp 
is selected; you can change the shape of the 
warp using the pop-up menu
Once you’ve applied a warp, you can edit it by opening the Appearance panel and 
clicking on the warp effect. Like all effects, a warp can be applied to just the fill or 
just the stroke—and if you edit the artwork, the warp updates as well. Since warps are 
effects, you can include them in a graphic style, which can then be applied to other 
artwork.
Deleting a mesh point
To delete a mesh point from a warp or mesh envelope, choose the Mesh tool and 
Option-click/Alt-click the point you’d like to delete.
—Jean-Claude Tremblay
Envelopes
While warp effects do a nice job of distorting artwork (and allow you to save the 
effect as a graphic style), Illustrator envelopes provide a higher level of control.
There are three ways to apply envelopes. The simplest way is to create a path you 
want to use as your envelope. Make sure it’s at the top of the stacking order—above 
the art you want to place inside the envelope. Then, with the artwork and your 
created path both selected, choose Object> Envelope Distort> Make with Top Object. 
Illustrator will create a special kind of object: an envelope. This object you created 
becomes an envelope container, which appears in the Layers panel as <Envelope>. 
You can edit the path of the envelope with any transformation or editing tools; the 
artwork inside will update to conform to the shape. To edit the contents of the 
envelope, click the Edit Contents button in the Control panel or choose Object> 
Envelope Distort> Edit Contents. If you then look at the Layers panel, you’ll notice 
that the <Envelope> now has a disclosure triangle that reveals the contents of the 
envelope—the artwork you placed. You can edit the artwork directly or even drag 
other paths into the <Envelope> in the Layers panel. To again edit the envelope 
itself, choose Object> Envelope Distort> Edit Envelope.
374

The controls that appear in the Control panel when an envelope 
mesh is selected; you can easily change the 
number of rows and columns, as well as re-
store the object to its original shape using 
the Reset Envelope Shape button
There are two other types of envelopes, and they’re closely related. Both types use 
meshes to provide even more distortion control. When using the first type, the 
envelope warp, you choose the overall envelope form from a pop-up list of options. 
When you use the envelope mesh, instead of starting from presets, you begin by 
choosing how many rows and columns your mesh will contain.
To create an envelope warp, select an object and choose Make with Warp (Object> 
Envelope Distort). This will open the Warp dialog. Once you choose a warp and click 
OK, Illustrator converts that warp to an envelope mesh. The Control panel will 
display the Envelope Warp controls, including a pop-up menu that lets you choose a 
different shape for the warp if you want to. You can edit the envelope warp’s 
individual mesh points with the Direct Selection tool to distort not only the outer 
edges of the envelope shape but also the way art is distorted within the envelope 
itself. To provide even more control, use the Mesh tool to add, remove, and 
manipulate mesh points.
To create an envelope mesh, select your artwork and choose Object> Envelope 
Distort> Make with Mesh. After you’ve chosen how many mesh points you want, 
Illustrator will create the envelope mesh. The Envelope Mesh tools will appear in the 
Control panel, allowing you to easily change the number of rows and columns, and 
restore the envelope mesh to its original shape if necessary. You can also use the 
Direct Selection tool to edit the points and use the Mesh tool to add mesh points. (If 
you use other tools, however, you’ll need to switch back to the Selection tool if you 
want the Envelope Mesh controls to reappear in the Control panel.)

3D EFFECTS
Illustrator offers you the power to transform any two-dimensional (2D) shape, 
including type, into a shape that looks three-dimensional (3D). As you’re working in 
Illustrator’s 3D effect dialogs, you can change your 3D shape’s perspective, rotate it, 
and add lighting and surface attributes. And because you’re working with a live 
effect, you can edit the source object at any time and observe the resultant change in 
the 3D shape immediately. You can also rotate a 2D shape in 3D space and change its 
perspective. Finally, Illustrator lets you map artwork previously saved as a symbol 
onto any of your 3D object’s surfaces. Remember that Illustrator is primarily a 2D 
program—its 3D capabilities are very limited when compared to the plethora of 
available 3D programs.
376

Extruding an object using the Effect> 3D> Extrude & Bevel dialog
—the two-dimensional object on the left was 
extruded to create the three-dimensional ver-
sion on the right
To begin, think of Illustrator’s horizontal ruler as the X axis and the vertical ruler as 
the Y axis. Now imagine a third dimension that extends back into space, 
perpendicular to the flat surface of your monitor. This is the Z axis. There are two 
ways to create a 3D shape using 3D effects. The first method is by extruding a 2D 
object back into space along the Z axis, and the second is by revolving a 2D object 
around its Y axis, up to 360°.
Don’t worry about the ° symbol
The degree symbol automatically inserts after entering a value into 3D dialog rotation 
text fields.
To apply a 3D effect to a selected object, choose one of the 3D effects from the fx icon 
in the Appearance panel (or via the Effects menu). (To simplify the instructions 
throughout this chapter, we’ll be using the convention “choose Effect> 3D”.) Once 
you apply a 3D effect to an object, it will show up in the Appearance panel. As with 
other appearance attributes, you can edit the effect, change the position of the effect 
in the panel’s stacking order, and duplicate or delete the effect. You can also save 3D 
effects as reusable graphic styles so that you can apply the same effect to a batch of 
objects. Once the style has been applied, you can modify any of the style parameters 
by clicking the underlined effect name in the Appearance panel or double-clicking 
the fx icon to the right of the effect name. Editing the 2D path will update the 3D 
rendering. Following are a few of the key parameters for working in the different 
kinds of 3D:
• To extrude a 2D object, begin by creating a path; the path can be open or closed, and
can contain a stroke, a fill, or both (if your shape contains a fill, it’s best to begin with 
a solid color, not a gradient or pattern). With your path selected, choose Extrude & 
Bevel from the Effect> 3D submenu. In the lower portion of the dialog, enter a point 
size for depth for your object in the Extrude Depth field, or drag the slider. Adding a 
cap to your object makes the ends appear solid; disabling the cap option makes your 
object appear hollow (see first two figures at left).
You can choose from ten different bevels to style the edges of your object; bevels can 
be added to the original using Bevel Extent Out, or carved out of the original using 
Bevel Extent In (second pair of figures Bevel Extents).
377

Left to right: Turn cap on for solid, Turn cap off for hollow, Bevel 
Extent In, Bevel Extent Out
Bevel error messages...
If you apply bevels to some objects (like stars), you might see a yellow warning 
“Bevel self-intersection may have occurred” after clicking “Preview”—this may or 
may not actually mean there’s a problem.
• To revolve an object around its Y (vertical) axis, begin by creating a path. The path can
be open or closed and stroked, filled, or both. With your path selected, choose 
Effect> 3D> Revolve to open 3D Revolve Options. Drag the slider to set the number 
of degrees or enter a value from 1 to 360 in the Angle text field. An object that’s 
revolved 360° will appear solid. An object revolved less than 360° appears to have a 
wedge carved out of it. If you offset the rotation from the object’s edge, a 3D shape 
will appear to be carved out in the center.
For the smoothest 3D
When creating profile objects for 3D, draw as few anchor points as possible. Each 
anchor point produces an additional surface to render, and might also create 
potential problems if you’re later mapping artwork onto surfaces.
—Jean-Claude Tremblay
AARON MCGARRY
Revolving an object using the Effect> 3D> Revolve dialog—the 
open path on the left was revolved to create the 3D wine cork on the right 
378

• To rotate 2D or 3D objects in 3D space, choose Effects> 3D> Rotate. The 3D Rotate
Options dialog contains a cube representing the planes that your shape can be 
rotated through. Choose a preset angle of rotation from the Position menu, or enter 
values between –180 and 180 into the X, Y, and Z text fields. To manually rotate your 
object around one of its three axes, simply click on the edge of one of the faces of the 
white cube and drag. The edges of each plane are highlighted in a corresponding 
color that tells you through which of the object’s three planes you’re rotating it. The 
object’s rotation is constrained within the plane of that particular axis. If you wish to 
rotate your object relative to all three axes at once, click directly on a surface of the 
cube and drag, or click in the black area behind the cube and drag. Values in all three 
text fields will change. And if you simply want to rotate your object, click and drag 
inside the circle, but outside the cube itself.
AARON MCGARRY
An example of rotating an object in 3D space
LISA JACKMORE
Rotate objects in three dimensions by using the Effect> 3D> Rotate 
dialog (or the upper halves of the Revolve 
and the Extrude & Bevel dialogs); the sym-
bol on the left was rotated in 3D space to 
create the ﬁgure on the right (any 2D object 
can be rotated in 3D space, without making 
the object itself 3D)
379

• To change the perspective of an object, enter a number between 0 and 160 in the
Perspective field, or drag the slider pop-up. A smaller value simulates the look of a 
telephoto camera lens, while a larger value simulates a wide-angle camera lens.
2D or not 2D...?
Illustrator’s 3D objects are only truly three-dimensional while you’re working with 
them in a 3D effect dialog. As soon as you’re done tweaking your object and you 
click OK to close the dialog, the object’s three-dimensional qualities are “frozen”—
almost as if Illustrator had taken a snapshot of the object—until the next time you 
edit it in a 3D dialog. On the page, it’s technically a 2D rendering of a 3D object that 
can only be worked with in two-dimensional ways. But because the effect is live, you 
can work with the object in 3D again any time you want. Just select the object and 
then double-click the 3D effect listed in the Appearance panel.

realistic key and fob using Illustrator’s 3D 
tools later in this chapter

Customized bevels!
Each of the 3D Bevel paths are actually symbols, saved inside the “Bevels.ai” file. To 
add a custom bevel, open the Bevels.ai file, draw or paste a new path, drag the new 
paths to the Symbols panel, name the symbol, and resave the file. To find this 
hidden file: Control-click/right-click on the Adobe Illustrator application icon and 
choose “Show Package Contents,” then Required> Resources; the Bevels.ai file is 
inside your language folder.
—Jean-Claude Tremblay
3D—three dialogs
There are three different 3D effects, and some features overlap. If all you need to do 
is change the perspective of an object, use Rotate. If you want to map a symbol to 
the object, use either Revolve or Extrude & Bevel (you can still rotate an object from 
these as well).
—Brenda Sutherland
Not enough steps...
In the 3D dialog click the More Options button to adjust Blend steps; find a setting 
between the default (25) and the maximum (256) that’s smooth enough, but not too 
slow to draw (and print).
Applying surface shading to 3D objects
Illustrator allows you to choose different shading (ranging from dull and unshaded 
matte surfaces to glossy and highlighted surfaces that look like plastic), as well as 
customized lighting conditions. The Surface shading option appears as part of both 
the 3D Extrude & Bevel and the 3D Revolve Options dialogs. Choosing Wireframe as 
your shading option will result in a transparent object, the contours of which are 
overlaid with a set of outlines representing the object’s geometry. Choosing No 
Shading results in a flat-looking shape with no discernible surfaces. Choosing the 
Diffused Shading option results in your object having a soft light cast on its surfaces, 
while choosing the Plastic Shading option will make your object look as if it’s molded 
out of shiny, reflective plastic. For mapped surfaces, enable “Shade Artwork” in the 
Map Art dialog.
If you choose either the Diffused Shading or Plastic Shading option, you can further 
refine the look of your object by adjusting the direction and intensity of the light 
source illuminating it. By clicking the More Options button, the dialog will enlarge 
and you’ll be able to make changes to the Light Intensity, Ambient Light level, 
Highlight Intensity, Highlight Size, and number of Blend Steps. You can also choose 
a custom Shading Color to add a color cast to the shaded surfaces. If you choose to 
maintain a spot color assigned to your Extruded object during output by enabling the 
Preserve Spot Colors checkbox, be aware that this removes custom shading and 
limits your Shading Color to Black. If you choose Preserve Spot Colors, you should 
enable Overprint Preview (View menu) so you can see your shading and color 
accurately.
When expanded, the More Options dialog includes the light source sphere (More 
Options dialog). The small white dot within this sphere indicates the position of the 
light source, while the black box around it highlights this light source as currently 
selected. There is always one light source by default. Click and drag this dot within 
the sphere to reposition your light. With Preview enabled the lighting will 
automatically update on your 3D object.
381

The expanded More Options dialog shows the position of your light 
source within the sphere; the three icons lo-
cated below this sphere from left to right are 
“Move selected light to back of object,” 
“New Light,” and “Delete Light”
Clicking on the “New Light” icon (below the sphere) adds more light sources. This 
also selects the new light source (indicated by the black “highlight” box around it). 
Adjust each selected source independently using the lighting controls (to the right of 
the sphere). The first icon below the sphere, the “Move selected light to back of 
object” feature, creates back lighting for an object. When your light source is behind 
an object, the source indicator inverts to a black dot within a white square. When 
using multiple light sources, this difference helps you see which light sources are 
behind or in front of an object. Select a light source and click this icon to toggle the 
light to the front or back of your object, depending on its current position. To delete a 
light source, first select it, then click the Trash icon beneath the sphere (you can 
delete all but one default light source).
Although this book generally recommends working with the New Art Has Basic 
Appearance setting disabled, you might want to enable it when working with 3D 
effects. Otherwise, any new paths that you create subsequent to applying 3D effects 
to an object will also have the same appearance set, unless you first clear the 
appearance set from the panel or click on the default fill and stroke icon in the Tools 
panel. On the other hand, if you want your next object to have the same 3D effects 
as the one you just created, leave New Art Has Basic Appearance disabled.
Mapping art onto an object
To map artwork onto an object (as with the design on the washer to the left), 
first define the art that you wish to map onto a surface as a symbol; select the 
artwork you want to map, and drag it to the Symbols panel. You may also want 
to define a number of symbols. For instance, the texture and text on the outside 
of the washer (Stainless Steel Washer) is one symbol. The other objects were also 
each saved as symbols and added to surfaces in the Map Art dialog. 
382

Gradients saved as symbols are rasterized when they’re mapped. Adjust the 
resolution for the rasterization in “Document Raster Effects Settings.” Adjust this 
resolution via Effects> Document Raster Effects Settings.
Map the symbols onto your 3D objects from the Extrude & Bevel or Revolve Options 
dialogs. In either of these 3D options boxes, you simply click on the Map Art button, 
then choose one of the available symbols from the menu. You can specify which of 
your object’s surfaces the artwork will map onto by clicking on the left and right 
arrow keys. The selected surface will appear in the window; then you can either scale 
the art by dragging the handles on the bounding box or make the art expand to cover 
the entire surface by clicking the Scale to Fit button. Note that as you click through 
the different surfaces, the selected surface will be highlighted with a red outline in 
your document window. Your currently visible surfaces will appear in light gray in 
the Map Art dialog, and surfaces that are currently hidden will appear dark.
Note: To see artwork mapped onto the side surfaces of your object, make sure the object has a 
stroke of None.
AARON MCGARRY
Maps allow you to add designs or texture effects to an object (such as a label on a 
bottle), but can also cover an entire object (see wine cork mapped with a cork texture 
image). However, complex objects produce a greater number of surfaces, which can 
make rendering very slow and perhaps generate errors. If you intend to add lighting 
and shading options on a mapped surface, enable “Shade Artwork” in the Map Art 
dialog.
Mapping—don’t get lost!
• Remember to choose a surface. Select by clicking the arrow keys to view each
surface.
• To identify the surface you want to map, look for the red highlight on the object
itself, rather than looking at the flattened proxy in the Map Art dialog.
• If the symbol isn’t mapping to a selected surface, it may be on the inside of the
surface.
• A stroke will add more surfaces to an object than a fill because a stroke creates a
hollow inside the object, which is also treated as a surface.
• A stroke can obscure mapped art on a side or inside of a surface that can’t be
seen.

THE PERSPECTIVE GRID
The perspective grid allows you to create art on a ground plane representing real 
world space as viewed by the human eye. Distances between edges converge as you 
approach the horizon, the terminal point of our vision. This tool is useful for creating 
scenes such as cityscapes where buildings or roads narrow in view as they recede 
from our vision, eventually vanishing on the horizon.
With this Perspective Grid toolset you can draw dynamically within the perspective 
environment itself so that shapes or objects automatically conform to the perspective 
grid as you create them, or you can attach existing flat vector art to the perspective 
grid by dragging selected art into the perspective grid using the Perspective Selection 
tool (see warning tip Perspective is permanent!). You can even position the grid on 
top of a reference photograph to add vector content. Symbols, text, and objects 
created with Illustrator’s 3D effect are also supported within the perspective 
environment.
The Perspective Grid tool (left) opens the perspective grid with 
grid plane controls visible; the Perspective 
Selection tool (right) allows you to bring ob-
jects, text, or symbols into perspective, move 
these items in perspective space, or switch 
active planes
384

To begin working in perspective you must first define your perspective environment. 
Click on the Perspective Grid tool in the Tools panel to display the perspective grid 
on your Artboard, or click View> Perspective Grid> Show Grid. The default is Two 
Point Perspective consisting of two vanishing points. For one point perspective 
choose View> Perspective Grid> One Point Perspective> 1P Normal View, which has 
a single vanishing point. For three-point perspective, choose Three Point 
Perspective> 3P Normal View, which has three vanishing points (if a perspective grid 
is customized and saved, it will appear in the respective submenu for 1P, 2P, or 3P 
Normal View as an additional choice).
When you select the Perspective Grid tool, your grid is displayed with grid plane 
control points on its extremities (though some disappear when the Perspective 
Selection tool is used). These controls allow you to manually adjust parameters such 
as vanishing points, angles, repositioning of planes, grid height and width, etc. 
Scrolling the cursor over these controls yields an indicator below the pointer showing 
the directional choices available for that control.
Grid control points can be manually adjusted on the grid itself or 
more precisely using the Deﬁne Perspective 
Grid dialog box (View> Perspective Grid> 
Deﬁne Grid). Presets can then be saved for 
reuse. View> Perspective Grid> Show 
Rulers displays a ruler on the visible grid.
To save a customized grid choose View> Perspective Grid> Save Grid As Preset. The 
new grid is saved under the respective perspective type; for example, a customized 
one-point perspective grid will be saved as an option to 1P Normal View when the 
View> Perspective Grid> Two Point Perspective fly-out menu is displayed. The 
Define Grid dialog (View> Perspective Grid> Define Grid) allows you to adjust the 
grid with greater numerical precision and save as a preset for further uses.
To begin working within your defined environment, first select an active plane to 
work in. The cube in the upper left-hand corner of the work area is the Plane 
Switching Widget. When you click on a cube side with the Perspective Grid tool (or 
any drawing or editing tool), the active plane is highlighted with a color. Orange, for 
example, is the default color for the right plane (see figures at left). The active plane 
means that anything drawn in perspective will conform to the perspective of that 
specific plane regardless of where it is drawn on the artboard (only one plane can be 
active at any time). The Perspective Grid tool cursor also indicates this with the 
shaded side of a cube below its pointer. 
385

The Plane Switching Widget shown left with the left side highlight-
ed in blue indicates that the left plane (grid) 
is active; click on a side of the cube with one 
of the perspective tools (or press 1, 2, or 3 on 
your keyboard) to activate a different plane 
(second and third widget); click the area out-
side the cube within the widget (or press 4) 
to deactivate perspective mode, which allows 
you to draw normally (widget at far right).
Once you choose an active plane, you can use any drawing or editing tool to draw in 
perspective mode. Select a tool such as the Rectangle tool and begin drawing on the 
grid. Use the Perspective Selection tool (hidden under the Perspective Grid tool in 
the Tools panel) to select and move art within an active plane (the cursor also has a 
line and an arrow, indicating the active plane). When you move objects within your 
plane using this tool, your objects appear to recede and advance within the 
perspective grid (using the normal Selection tool freezes an object’s shape to the 
current viewpoint; it won’t continue to transform as you move it). You can also use 
the Perspective Selection tool to select existing vector objects and attach them to the 
perspective grid. To do so, activate a plane then select and drag the object to the 
perspective grid. When you use the Perspective Grid tool to select an object that’s 
already associated with the grid, the associated side of the cube automatically 
becomes highlighted.
Draw normally first...
Create text and symbols normally first, then use the Perspective Selection tool to 
attach them to an active plane and modify text using Object> Perspective> Edit Text.
Clicking in the area outside the cube within the widget (or pressing 4) deactivates all 
perspective planes so you can draw in normal mode (no perspective applied)—see 
figures opposite. Once your object is created, use the Perspective Selection tool (or 
press 1, 2, or 3) to activate a plane by clicking on a Widget side, and then drag the 
object to position it in perspective. You can also marquee-select multiple objects with 
the Perspective Selection tool, then drag them (together) into the active plane.
If you wish to move an object perpendicular to its current location, hold down the 5 
key (top row of numbers on keyboard only, not 5 on right numeric keypad) as you 
drag with the Perspective Selection tool; to duplicate an object and move it 
perpendicular to the original’s position, hold Option-5/Alt-5 as you drag.
386

With the Perspective Grid tool, double-click on any of the grid plane controls (the 
three circles below where the planes intersect) to open a Vanishing Plane or Floor 
Plane dialog, which allows you to move a plane precisely, with or without the objects 
associated with that plane.
To work on an object in normal mode after applying perspective, from either the 
Object menu or the contextual menu, choose Perspective> Release with Perspective 
(remember, this function does not return an object to a normal state if created 
initially without perspective but just detaches it from the perspective plane). The 
object can now be modified normally. Once an object has been detached from a 
plane, however, you must use Object> Perspective> Attach to Active Plane to 
reattach it. If the object is not reattached this way, using the Perspective Selection 
tool will automatically add a new perspective to the object.
Perspective is permanent!
Unlike other effects, once perspective is applied to an object it cannot be released to 
return to its original (normal) state, so always work on a copy of the original or, 
alternatively, use a symbol.

Toggle 
-Shift-I/Ctrl-Shift-I (View> Perspective Grid> Hide Grid) to hide the grid.
In this example, clicking within the Plane Switching Widget but 
outside the cube deactivated the perspective 
grid (note the cyan colored area surrounding 
the cube), so the rectangle was drawn in nor-
mal mode; to later apply perspective to the 
rectangle, select the Grid Selection tool, click 
on a Widget side to activate a plane, and 
drag the rectangle to the desired location.
387

The above image shows a square drawn with the Rectangle tool. 
Notice the Plane Switching Widget indicates 
that the right plane is active, hence the illus-
trated shape in perspective relative to the 
right vanishing point (the cursor also in-
cludes a line and an arrow, which also indi-
cates the active plane). The same square 
copied and moved with the Perspective Se-
lection tool dynamically transforms it as it 
moves within the perspective plane.
This feature moves a plane to match the height or depth of an object as it is created 
or moved. To use: The grid should be visible, Smart Guides on, and the Perspective 
Selection tool active. Press Shift as you hover over an anchor point or grid line; the 
active plane remains visible as the others disappear until an action is completed. It 
then returns to normal, or press Esc if no action is performed.
Double-click the Perspective Grid tool in the Tools panel to open 
the Perspective Grid Options dialog for Au-
tomatic Plane Positioning options

Perspective limits
• An artboard can contain only one perspective grid. However, you can position a
grid across more than one artboard.
• Effects such as rasters, legacy text, non-native art, envelope objects, gradient
mesh art, and the Flare tool do not transform to the perspective grid.
RELATED TIPS
Live effects from fx
Access live effects from the Effects menu, and from the fx icon in the bottom of the 
Appearance panel. To simplify instructions in this chapter, we’ll be using the 
convention Effect> 3D or Effect> Warp. To edit an effect, select the effect in the 
Appearance panel and click the underlined effect name, or double-click the fx icon to 
the right of the effect name.
Smart people use Smart Guides
When you work with warps or envelopes, it may become difficult to edit artwork that 
has an appearance applied to it. With Smart Guides turned on, Illustrator highlights 
the art, making it easier to identify the actual artwork (and not the appearance). Use 
-U/Ctrl-U to toggle Smart Guides on and off.

 CC UPDATE TO THE PERSPECTIVE GRID
Editing the viewpoint of the Perspective Grid itself, before adding artwork, has 
always been fairly manageable. However, if you wanted to change the perspective 
after you had added any art, you had to first alter your grid, and then rebuild your 
scene from scratch, either by reattaching your unaltered original artwork to the grid, 
or by redrawing new art directly in the altered grid. With Illustrator CC, you can now 
freely move the vanishing point on a Two or Three Point grid, even after you’ve 
developed a complex composition. By enabling a feature called Lock Station Point, 
artwork that has been attached to the grid will adhere to adjustments in perspective. 
With Lock Station Point, moving the vanishing point for one grid plane moves the 
vanishing point for the other grid(s) in tandem, and your objects will realign to the 
new perspective.
389

A box attached to a Two Point Perspective grid
Without Lock Station Point enabled (or before Illustrator CC), 
moving a grid’s vanishing point detaches all artwork from the perspective grid 
390

To use the Lock Station Point, first attach your artwork to the grid as usual. Next, 
when you want to change the perspective—for instance, moving the grid so more of 
the right-hand side of the grid is revealed, and less of the left—choose View> 
Perspective Grid> Lock Station Point. Next, to change the perspective and move the 
attached artwork at the same time, use the Perspective Grid tool and drag the right 
vanishing point further to the right to see more of the right side. Your attached 
artwork will conform to the new vanishing point automatically. Dragging on the left 
vanishing point swings the perspective to reveal more of the left side of the grid; on a 
Three Point Perspective grid, you can also swing the vanishing point located at the 
bottom of the grid, which tends to skew the perspective considerably.
With Lock Station Point enabled, you can adjust both the vanishing 
point and the perspective grid, and attached 
artwork will adjust automatically to match 
the grid (for an example of this in detail, see 
Aaron McGarry’s lesson and gallery in the
CC section at the end of this chapter)
While the new Lock Station Point feature lets you keep artwork both attached and 
appropriately transformed as you alter your vanishing point in a Two or Three Point 
Perspective grid, that doesn’t mean you can freely switch between different types of 
grids and have the artwork flawlessly follow along. To avoid erratic results, choose 
whether you want to draw in two-or-three-point perspective before you attach any 
artwork to it.

Gustavo Del Vechio
Del Vechio placed a photo by John Murphy as a template reference for his Carrot 
Tree restaurant illustration. He chose the Perspective Grid tool (which enabled the 
visible grid), then used the tool to set the horizon line and adjust each plane to 
match the perspective of the photo template. To create each portion of the building 
in proper perspective, he ﬁrst would use the Perspective Selection tool to enable 
one plane, then use a variety of Illustrator’s vector tools to create most of the objects 
for that plane directly on the perspective grid. He repeated this process for each 
plane until he had built most of the restaurant on each of the three planes. In a few 
cases he created objects with the grid disabled, then—enabling the grid—used the 
Perspective Selection tool to select the objects and dragged and dropped them 
onto a highlighted plane of the grid. To add variety and texture, he used custom 
bristle brushes to paint the sky and the foreground fade. To constrain his brush 
strokes to areas such as the lawn, he selected that object and enabled the Draw 
Inside mode (see “Draw Behind and Draw Inside” in the Rethinking Construction 
chapter for more about this). Finally, he resized the artboard using the Artboard tool 
to crop the image to his desired dimensions.

CRESSY
Warp & Distort
Bending Forms to Create Organic Variations
Overview: Use Envelope Distort and Distort & Transform live effects to shape objects; use 
ﬁlled rectangles with blend modes to change the time of day.
When Michael Cressy needed to create scenes for an online video game, he turned to 
Illustrator’s powerful Envelope Distort features and live effects to create a Halloween 
world where magic changes the shapes of things. By adding a few additional layers to 
colorize his images for different times of the day, his game scenes took on a 
consistent look with minimal fuss.
1 Using Envelope Distort to bend branches and trees. To create the blighted trees, Cressy 
used the Rectangle tool to make three adjacent stripes with different fills (no stroke). 
He selected them and chose Object> Envelope Distort> Make with Warp. He set the 
Style to Arch with a Vertical Bend of 25%. He then used a Distortion amount of 99% 
in the Vertical dimension. These settings created a slightly curved set of stripes so 
distorted in the vertical dimension that they came to a point. With this horn as his 
base element, Cressy duplicated and scaled each horn (holding Option/Alt and drag-
ging the bounding box) to be either branches or the main tree trunks. From the con-
text-sensitive menu, he chose Transform> Reflect, and in the dialog chose Vertical to 
flip half of them. And since Cressy used Envelope Distort, his settings remained live 
and editable throughout the development of his image.

pointed arch

2 Texturing the tree bark. In order to have some of the tree trunks stand out from the 
rest, Cressy decided to add texture to them. Since the Roughen effect breaks up 
smooth outlines with some of the outlines falling inside the original form, Cressy re-
tained the full shape by keeping the basic shape on one layer, then duplicating it to a 
layer above; this layer he modified by choosing Effect> Distort & Transform> Rough-
en. After enabling Absolute, Cressy played with the sliders until he found the right 
amount of the effect to appear like rough bark on his tree trunks—modest settings 
prevented the Roughen effect here from creating long, sharp needles. Having again 
chosen a live effect to alter his basic shapes, rather than attempting to draw each of 
them with the Pen tool, Cressy kept his options open for future editing and was able 
to work quickly and interactively with the effects.

texture to the tree trunks

3 Using Roughen for grass, then warping it to make a broomstick. To construct the grassy 
hill, Cressy drew a half-oval with the Pen tool, then applied Effect> Distort & Trans-
form> Zig Zag. He next applied Roughen with a low setting, and added another in-
stance of the Roughen effect, this time with a high setting for Details to create the 
tall, thin strands of grass. To create the bristles of the witch’s broomstick, he used 
-
F/Ctrl-F to paste a copy of the grassy hill in front, and applied an Envelope warp us-
ing the Shell Upper preset. He then edited the envelope with the Direct Selection tool 
and Free Transform until he had shaped the broom end.

grassy hill, then running Envelope Distort> 
Make with Warp, and choosing Shell Upper

envelope
4 Adding layers to coordinate scenes for different times of the day. Cressy maintained con-
sistency from one scene to the next by adding tinting layers that could be turned on 
or off, each representing a different time of day. For midday, he added a layer with a 
light brown rectangle, then clicked Opacity in the Control panel to lower the Opacity 
to 50% and chose Screen for the Blending Mode. For early evening scenes, he used a 
white-to-dark brown radial gradient on a layer set to Multiply at reduced Opacity, 
and for night shots, he used a lavender-colored rectangle set to Multiply at 100% 
Opacity. He later reused these tinting layers with other scenes he created.

Dedree Drees
As part of her undersea illustration, “The Dory,” artist and instructor Dedree Drees 
mimicked blades of seagrass by building an intricate blend that she then extruded 
as a 3D object. Drees started by drawing four overlapping, wavy lines using the 
Pencil tool and then giving each stroke a unique color. To begin blending, Drees 
selected all four lines and then double-clicked the Blend tool. In the Blend Options 
dialog she set Spacing> Speciﬁed Steps to 2, and then chose Object> Blend> 
Make. To make the lines of the blend look like ﬂat seagrass blades, Drees extruded 
the blend by opening the Appearance panel, and from the fx icon choosing 3D> 
Extrude & Bevel. She experimented with different Extrude Depth values to make 
sure that the seagrass blades would not appear thick and dense. Drees brought 
this object into Photo-shop where she positioned it among other elements. To ﬁnish, 
she selected individual blades of seagrasses, and created layer masks to make 
them transparent.

GLITSCHKA
Von R. Glitschka
For “Beautiful,” Von R. Glitschka placed his model and Japanese text against one of 
his intricate patterns (see the Mastering Complexity chapter for more on how to 
create patterns). He then used Live Effects throughout to create the 
interaction between his objects and their environment. To lift the Kanji 
characters from the background, he used Outer Glow in Multiply mode, 
creating 
an 
even 
shadow 
around 
the 
calligraphy.
But to separate his model from the background pattern, he maintained 
directional lighting. He ﬁlled an object that matched her shape with the same 
blue as the background, and moved it a bit to the right, added a 20 pixel 
Gaussian Blur, and set the layer to Multiply mode with a slightly reduced 
opacity. He used the Gaussian Blur effect frequently to create the shadows 
cast on her skin by her hair and to soften transitions when modeling the skin 
tones. He used the Inner Glow effect in Multiply mode to add a soft shadow 
within an object. 
401

Because he modeled her in a very detailed fashion, Glitschka streamlined some of 
his work by creating a few graphic styles to use when creating the ﬁne shading and 
blending in her skin tones. Gradients—often using transparency—added to the live 
effects to create a soft, romantically styled illustration.

MCGARRY
The Keys to 3D
The Basics of Realistic 3D Modeling
Overview: Create 2D art to extrude as 3D; save graphics and images as symbols to use as 
maps; render and position 3D objects; map visible surfaces of the 3D object; adjust lighting; 
generate drop and cast shadows
Aaron McGarry, an illustrator working in the high-tech industry, often has to 
conceptualize the look and feel of a product before the physical product actually 
exists.
1 Creating the 2D art to be rendered in 3D. McGarry began his project by first creating 
the 2D art that he’d later extrude into 3D objects. Since the key blade and bow would 
require two different extrusion depths, he created each separately. He began creating 
the key blade in two parts; he drew one set of teeth, then double-clicked the Reflect 
tool, chose Horizontal in the dialog, and clicked Copy. After bringing both pieces to-
gether with a slight gap between, in the Pathfinder panel he clicked Unite. This 
joined the two parts of the key into one shape, yet allowed each of the surfaces to be 
separately mapped, with the gap creating a center line. In total, he created eight sep-
arate pieces: two for the key, three for the key ring links, and three for the fob, all of 
them with a gray fill and no stroke.
403

2 Saving artwork as symbols to be used as maps. To create a more realistic look, McGarry 
gathered and created artwork and saved each one as a symbol to later map onto the 
visible surfaces. He used Illustrator’s vector tools to create the label for the bow of 
the key, the security buttons on the fob, part of the key blade, and key ring links, and 
then saved each as a symbol (by dragging each separately to the Symbols panel). He 
also used File> Place to bring in two JPG photos of flat metal, one narrow strip for 
the fob edges—and a second larger piece for the fob front—and saved each of these 
photos as symbols.

and graphics as symbols to later map onto 
the 3D objects
404

Be thrifty with image maps
Size your map artwork appropriately (both in file size and dimensions) to avoid 
potential errors when rendering. You should also position your 3D objects first and 
then map only the visible surfaces.
3 Extruding and positioning the 3D objects. He selected one object at a time and chose 
Effects> 3D> Extrude & Bevel. For each piece he adjusted value in the Extrude Depth 
field until it looked right. For objects such as the bow of the key he applied a Round-
ed bevel selected from the Bevel menu. He changed the fill color of the key bow to 
blue, but he left the other objects gray, a color similar enough to the metallic maps 
that some surfaces wouldn’t need image maps. Next, McGarry selected objects one at 
a time and re-entered the Extrude & Bevel dialog, where he rotated each object to the 
appropriate angle using the cube widget. With all the parts now positioned, he sepa-
rately applied perspective first to the fob and then the key, this time by customizing 
the Perspective field in the Extrude & Bevel dialog.
Unlike conventional 3D software, Illustrator’s 3D objects cannot pass through other 
objects occupying the same space; objects can only be moved in front or behind other 
objects. As a result, McGarry had to create the illusion of the interconnecting links in 
the image as separate pieces, arranging them in front or behind each other.

selected extruded object, he re-entered the Extrude and Bevel Options dialog and 
clicked the Map Art button. Since the key blade originally consisted of two joined 
pieces, the map dialog treated each half of this top plane as a separate surface. This 
enabled him to map the right half of the blade with the metal symbol and the left half 
with a gradient symbol, creating the dark ridge down the center to give the illusion of 
a worn step on the blade’s left side. McGarry then entered More Options in the Ex-
trude and Bevel dialog and adjusted lighting for each part by moving the highlight on 
the sphere and reducing Ambient Light to darken the side shading. Lastly, to en-
hance the 3D illusion he manually added shadow effects (Effects> Stylize> Drop 
Shadow), and then drew paths to which he applied Effect> Blur> Gaussian Blur for 
the blade and key ring shadows.

3D shadow effects
Illustrator’s 3D lighting doesn’t cast shadows. Although in some situations Effects> 
Drop Shadows can be useful, in many cases you’ll have to manually construct 
shadow objects with paths and blurs.

MCGARRY
Aaron McGarry
McGarry created this exploded view of a key fob using a variety of Illustrator 
features, including vector tools, symbols, and 3D, as well as texture and drop 
shadow effects. He created the PCB (printed circuit board) using basic paths and 
applied a variety of gradients and textures, saving some of the PCB components as 
symbols so he could easily duplicate them. For the batteries and buttons, he 
applied modiﬁed gradients from the Gradients> Metals library and placed icons on 
top of the buttons. For the batteries he added text on a curved path, slightly 
reducing the opacity of the text to blend it with the metal background. To easily 
apply edge bevels to the fob housing, buttons, and key ring section, McGarry 
separately applied Effect> 3D> Extrude & Bevel to each. While still in the Extrude & 
Bevel Options dialog, he also applied the image maps that he’d saved as symbols 
for the fob front and bevels. Clicking the Map Art button, he navigated to the visible 
surfaces with the arrow keys, and for each he chose the image that he’d prepared. 
McGarry created the key ring using the Ellipse tool with a stroke, no ﬁll; he extruded 
and applied a Rounded bevel; then rotated it in proﬁle and applied maps and 
shadows (see detail above). He made three copies, shortening one to indicate the 
ring end. He rotated and moved the fourth ring (lowest) behind the others. Selecting 
each part of the fob separately, he adjusted lighting controls by clicking the More 
Options button in the Extrude & Bevel Options to expand the dialog. Finally, since 
the 3D lighting controls don’t cast shadows, to create the illusion of different object 
depths he separately selected each part of the fob (front housing, buttons, key 
rings, and back), then applied and adjusted drop shadows using Effect> 
Stylize>Drop Shadow.

Anil Ahuja/Adobe Systems
Adobe Systems Product Specialist Anil Ahuja used a number of visual references to 
create this majestic Taj Mahal. To help him in the construction of the building in 
perspective, he created front- and plan-view sketches. He then referred to photos to 
set up the basic two-point perspective grid. As with a real structure, he built from 
the ground up using layers to organize his assembled pieces. The ﬂoor is a single 
design that he created normally (Floor Symbol) and saved as a symbol. Then he 
dragged an instance of the symbol into the perspective grid using the Perspective 
Selection tool. Using a combination of Option-Shift/Alt-Shift, he dragged to create a 
duplicate, then used Transform Again (
-D/Ctrl-D) to repeat the ﬂoor pattern.
The next object was the plinth (raised base) upon which the mausoleum sits 
(Drawing on Grid). Drawing a rectangle in perspective on the ground plane ﬁrst, he 
then used the Automatic Plane Positioning feature when creating the sides. Though 
he created symmetrical objects such as squares and rectangles in perspective, he 
created the more intricate designs such as the curved archways of the iwan and 
pishtaqs normally and then placed them into perspective. The onion dome began 
as outlines on the plinth. He used the perpendicular movement feature to duplicate 
and precisely move an outlined ring straight up off the ﬂoor plane by using the Floor 
Plane dialog options (click Floor Plane control point to open). Once he had 
positioned the rings, he drew straight lines alongside the rings to complete the 
cylinder and drew a simple circle without perspective behind to create the dome 
shape. For more info about how he created this, see his ReadMe on WOW!

DREW
One Perspective
Simulating a One-Point Perspective View
Overview: Create a one-point perspective grid; customize the grid by moving its control 
points; draw tile artwork and move it onto the grid using the Perspective Selection tool; du-
plicate the artwork to make a row; duplicate the rows to form a ﬂoor.
Elaine Drew is an artist who is equally at home with traditional painting as with the 
latest digital drawing tools. For this Anubis image, Drew relied on Illustrator’s 
Perspective Grid tool and presets to give the tiled floor and gradient walls the illusion 
of perspective.
1 Creating the one-point perspective grid. Drew designed the illustration to feature a 
one-point perspective view. She began by selecting the Rectangle tool and drawing 
the square that would form the rear wall of the room and serve as a guide for creating 
the perspective grid in the next step. She filled the square with a gradient.
To start the grid, Drew chose View> Perspective Grid> Define Grid. In the “Define 
Perspective Grid” dialog she chose the [1P-Normal View] preset, and then 
customized it by changing Units to Inches, Gridline every to .5, and Horizon Height 
to 5. Drew clicked the Save icon, named and saved the preset, then clicked OK to exit 
the dialog.

2 Adjusting the grid to ﬁt the illustration design. To begin customizing the grid to fit her 
design, Drew chose View> Perspective Grid> One Point Perspective and selected the 
preset she had created previously. Selecting the Perspective Grid tool (which made 
the grid editable), she dragged the left Ground Level control until it met the lower-
left corner of the artboard. Then she dragged the Horizontal Level control down and 
the Vanishing Point control to the right. Finally, to extend the bottom grid plane to 
the rear wall, she dragged the Extent of Grid control upward so that the grid met the 
bottom of the wall (to accurately see the full extent of the grid, it may be necessary to 
zoom in).

3 Creating the ﬂoor tiles and moving them onto the grid. With the grid established, Drew 
was ready to create the two floor tiles. She decided to create the tiles and assemble 
them into rows outside of the grid before moving them into the grid to form the floor. 
She turned off the perspective grid by clicking inside the circle of the Plane Switching 
Widget with the Perspective Grid tool. (The circle’s background turns blue.)

Next, Drew created one circular petal and one square tile to fit within the 0.5-inch 
grid size she specified in the previous step. To soften the look of the artwork, she 
applied the Effect> SVG Filters> AI_Alpha_1 filter. She duplicated the pair of tiles 
several times to create a row, then duplicated the row and offset it horizontally by 
one tile. She continued duplicating and offsetting the rows to complete the floor. To 
render the tiled floor in the perspective of her grid, she first made sure View> 
Perspective Grid> Snap to Grid was enabled, and then chose the Perspective 
Selection tool and clicked the Horizontal Grid plane portion of the Plane Switching 
Widget. Then she selected all of the tiles with the Perspective Selection tool and 
dragged them onto the grid.

Drew finished the room by creating the left wall. She drew a rectangle and filled it 
with a gradient. Then she selected the Perspective Selection tool, clicked on the Left 
Grid plane portion of the Plane Switching Widget, and dragged the rectangle onto the 
grid.

AHUJA
Amplified Angles
Creating Details with Two-Point Perspective
Overview: Set up a two-point perspective grid; use drawing and editing tools to create the ba-
sic drawing in perspective; add basic shapes in perspective; add more details to achieve the ﬁ-
nal result.
Anil Ahuja, a senior product specialist working for Adobe, created this bus for 
instructional materials that explain how to work with Illustrator’s perspective tools.
1 Setting up a perspective grid. Ahuja sketched the bus from a photo reference, scanned 
it, and then placed it into Illustrator as a template layer. When you select the Per-
spective Grid tool, your artboard will, by default, display a two-point perspective 
grid. Ahuja then adjusted the grid to fit the scanned sketch by aligning the control 
points on the grid to match the sketch. Using the Perspective Grid tool, he then be-
gan by moving the ground level control point (the diamond on either extremity of the 
ground level), which allowed him to move all the planes together in any direction 
(this is indicated by the four-way arrow that appears next to the cursor when it is 
over this control point). Then he moved the left and right planes individually by us-
ing the tool to drag the right and left grid plane controls (the small circles beneath 
each visible grid). He then also adjusted the horizon (the diamond on either extremi-
ty of the horizon line) and vanishing points (circles on the horizon line where the 
planes converge).

trols visible on top of the sketch
2 Drawing in perspective. Clicking a widget side to activate the plane he wished to work 
in, Ahuja then drew the basic shapes of the bus in perspective using tools such as the 
Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, and Ellipse tools. After creating one side window, he 
held Option/Alt while dragging it to create the others. Duplicating objects this way 
automatically transformed them to their new perspective position as he dragged 
them.

perspective using the Rectangle, Rounded 
Rectangle, and Ellipse tools

3 Drawing complex elements. Ahuja created complex elements (such as the wheels) 
outside of the perspective grid, then attached them to the perspective grid by drag-
ging them within the grid using the Perspective Selection tool. He converted the fills 
of some grid objects into gradients, and others into gradient mesh by clicking on 
them with the Gradient Mesh tool (meshes must be made by converting objects al-
ready in the grid; they can’t be created first and then moved into a grid). He duplicat-
ed the outer rim of the tire to create the inner rim by holding Option/Alt (this makes 
the duplicate) and the 5 key (this makes the drag perpendicular to the original). To 
create the tire surface he used the curvature of the tire as a guide, used the Pen tool 
to draw a closed path within the space, and then filled it with a gradient.

again if needed. For each door or window he copied and used Paste in Front, 
converted this copy to a gradient mesh, and reduced the opacity of mesh points by 
clicking on Opacity in the Control panel.
4 The ﬁnishing touches. Ahuja created the most complex elements (like the logo and

drew a rectangle on the plane using the Rectangle tool choosing Effect> Blur> Gauss-
ian Blur. He created the building side by drawing a series of filled and stroked rec-
tangles in the perspective grid.

Modifying a Photo
Inserting Photographs in Perspective
Overview: Place a photograph and adjust the perspective grid to conform to the perspective 
of the image; add graphic elements in perspective; modify the photo to create a new product. 
Aaron McGarry, an illustrator working for the electronics industry in California, was 
able to use a photo of an existing product and the perspective grid to conceptualize 
the next generation of the device. 
420

1 Working with an established perspective. In order to add new elements to this photo, 
McGarry needed to find a way to fit a two-point grid to this uneven perspective. Us-
ing the Perspective Grid tool, he first grabbed the Ground Level control point and 
moved the entire grid so that the three-plane intersection point rested at the fore-
most point on the device. McGarry then needed to adjust the grid to the photo per-
spective. He began by identifying two parallel edges on the left side of the device. To 
use these edges as a guide, he used the Line tool to draw two lines along these edges, 
extending the lines into the background until they intersected (see heavy pink lines 
in image Pink lines). This gave him the left vanishing point. He then used the Per-
spective Grid tool to grab the Horizon Line control point and move the horizon line 
up to meet the intersection point of the two guide lines.
Since the right plane of the device is essentially rounded with no straight edges to 
reference for guide lines, McGarry took the foremost straight edge on the top surface 
(heavy blue line in image) and extended a line back to intersect the horizon line, 
which gave him the right vanishing point. Since the horizon line was already in 
position only one guideline was needed for this side.

two pink lines on the left side, extending back 
until they intersect to form the left vanishing 
point, and relocating the horizon line to this 
point using the Perspective Grid tool

2 Creating the side buttons. McGarry began detailed items, like the icons and buttons, 
outside of the perspective grid. He sampled a light and dark color from the original 
buttons using the Eyedropper tool, then saved them as swatches. To make it appear 
that the button was recessed, he created a linear gradient using the sampled swatch-
es, then adjusted the gradient stops so that the lighter color was pushed to a far edge. 
After rotating the icons 90° clockwise (you can’t rotate objects within the perspective 
grid!), he activated the left plane, marquee-selected the buttons using the Perspective 
Selection tool, and then positioned them. After resizing the buttons using the bound-
ing box, he completed the bottom ledge on the buttons by drawing a narrow rec-
tangle in perspective mode, then added a gradient; since gradients do not transform 
when put into the grid, he adjusted the angle in the Gradient panel to match the 
plane angle. He held Option/Alt as he dragged this ledge to create the other.

device to the side to make room for the new

tion tool to attach the buttons to the perspective grid

tive Selection tool)
3 Creating the LCD screen. Activating the floor plane, McGarry used the Rectangle tool 
to create a rectangle in perspective and filled it with a Sky gradient (from Swatch Li-
braries). Outside of the perspective grid, he next created the screen text and icon, ro-
tated them, and then attached them to the perspective plane with the Perspective Se-
lection tool. To create the illusion that the LCD screen was backlit, he layered an off-
set transparent copy of the LCD above the text. To do this he selected the LCD object, 
then used perpendicular movement by clicking on the Floor Plane control point to 
open the Floor Plane dialog. Entering a 2-pt value in the Location field, he selected 
Copy Selected Objects and clicked OK. With this duplicate now selected, he created a 
new layer and moved the duplicate to this layer by dragging the selection square (in 
the Layers panel). Using the bounding box, McGarry then brought the two foremost 
edges of the top LCD screen out to match the edges of the bottom one. Finally, he re-
duced the opacity of the top LCD in the Control panel, giving depth to the glass while 
also fading the text and icon.

Distant grid control points
If the lines you create as guides (to help you find a vanishing point) extend way 
beyond the artboard, try using two windows (Window> New Window). Zoom in on 
one window, and set the other to the full extent of the grid control points. You can 
make adjustments rapidly by switching between windows, even though the grid is 
only visible in the active window.

MARIC
Establishing Perspective
Aligning Grids & Planes to an Architectural Sketch
Advanced Technique
Overview: Import a sketch with a visible horizon line; set up and align a perspective grid; 
construct the rendering using the perspective grid.
Creating architectural renderings in Illustrator got a whole lot easier with the 
addition of the Perspective Grid tool. For traditional illustrators like Pete Maric, who 
learned how to create architectural renderings by hand, this tool is similar to setting 
up vanishing points on a drafting board. Upon constructing the perspective grid, all 
lines and forms drawn snap to the grid for a faster workflow and provide perspective 
accuracy. The perspective grid can be repositioned for adjacent walls or turned off to 
create “out-of-perspective” elements.
1 Creating a reference image. Maric relied on a hand-drawn sketch as reference for the 
illustration, making certain that there is a strong visible horizon line to later help him 
establish the vanishing points. In Illustrator, using File> Place, he enabled the Tem-
plate option to import the sketch into a locked template layer.

425

2 Constructing the perspective grid. Selecting the Perspective Grid tool in the Tools pan-
el activated the default grid. Maric then began to align the grid to the sketch by mov-
ing the grid plane control handles until the grid matched the perspective of the 
sketch. Starting with the left (blue) plane, he click-dragged the control handle to 
align with the right front of the building. He aligned the right (orange) plane to the 
receding front wall and the bottom (green) plane to the porch. He then click-dragged 
each vanishing point control handle, moving them into position until both were 
aligned to the visible horizon line in his sketch.

Creating architectural elements in perspective using the Perspec-
tive Grid tool and Plane Switching Widget
3 Creating the architectural elements in perspective. Leaving the perspective grid active 
and sketch template layer visible, Maric was able to easily focus on the current active 
drawing plane using the Plane Switching Widget. Maric primarily used the Rectangle 
tool to create the front entrance of the building and main architectural elements. He 
organized drawn elements (façade, windows, mullions) in the Layers panel in accor-
dance with the way they appear in real life. So, windows would be lower on the layer 
stack, mullions would be in front of windows, and the façade would be on top of the 
layer stack. By selecting the right plane in the Plane Switching Widget, he created the 
receding front wall, windows, and mullions to align with this plane.
427

Aligning the perspective grid to adjacent walls and creating detail 
with the Line tool
4 Moving the perspective grid to create additional architectural geometry and adding detail. 
Once one portion of the building was complete, he could reposition the perspective 
grid to create walls in other areas of the illustration. However, before moving the grid 
to adjacent walls, Maric saved customized grids for each plane of the structure by us-
ing View> Perspective Grid> Save Grid as Preset. Then he could realign the 
perspective grid by clicking and dragging the grid plane control handles so he could 
use the grid to construct different walls. To create repeating linear details within the 
walls, Maric needed to draw only one line, he then duplicated it in perspective by 
holding Option/Alt while dragging it.

MCGARRY
 Perspective Shifts
Locking Station Point to Auto-Update Art
Advanced Technique
Overview: Create the illusion of 3D space; attach a variety of objects to a box; use Lock Sta-
tion Point so that objects in the grid automatically adjust with changes of perspective.
Aaron McGarry, an illustrator working for the high-tech industry in California, is 
often called upon to create prototypes in simulated 3D perspective. Using the Lock 
Station Point feature he’s now able to adjust his perspective grid after his prototypes 
are in place, and the objects within the grid will update automatically.
1 Creating the basic artwork. McGarry used the default Two-Point perspective grid to 
begin building his prototype box. Drawing directly on the grid, he used the Rectangle 
tool to draw both sides of a box; he applied a gradient to the strokes of both filled rec-
tangles to give the box “weight.” On a layer below he created the illusion of a cast 
shadow by drawing another rectangle, then softened the edges with a blur effect (Ef-
fect> Blur> Gaussian Blur). To increase the illusion of 3D space, he applied a gradi-
ent to another rectangle on the bottom layer.

2 Bringing details into the grid. He created the text and recycle symbol for the box in 
normal view. He then used the Perspective Selection tool to attach and then resize 
and position the graphics for each side to the box.

original grid

3 Shifting perspective. After his basic prototype was assembled, McGarry needed a 
more dramatic perspective. Before adjusting anything he enabled Lock Station Point 
(View> Perspective Grid> Lock Station Point). He was then able to move the Left 
Vanishing point to the right and lower his Horizon Line. With Lock Station Point en-
abled, the objects within the grid automatically update, and conform to the new per-
spective positioning.

With Lock Station Point enabled, adjusting the grid means that the 
attached objects will follow along and con-
form to new perspective positions

Aaron McGarry
McGarry needed to add a photo of the product to the front of his box prototype 
(Perspective Shifts Lesson). However, because non-vector objects like raster 
photographs can’t be added to the perspective grid, he needed to ﬁrst convert 
his photo to a vector object using Image Trace. In case he’d need the same 
trversion again, and because attaching art to the grid is permanent, he traced the 
photo in a separate ﬁle. McGarry selected the photo, clicked the Image Trace 
panel in the Control panel, and began adjusting parameters. For Mode he chose 
Color, and for the Palette he chose Full Tone. In order to optimize ﬁle size and 
image quality, he used the Color slider to reduce the number of colors and paths. 
Saving this ﬁle, he then copy-and-pasted the vectorized photo to the ﬁle with his 
perspective grid. To permanently vectorize this tracing so he could attach it to the 
grid, he clicked Expand in the Control panel. Using the Perspective Selection tool 
he then attached the traced image to the grid. Once attached, he again used the 
Perspective Selection tool to resize and position the image. With this working 
process, McGarry was able to keep the entire product in place within the grid so 
he could easily update the product angle. As long as Lock Station Point was still 
enabled (it’s saved with the document), he would be able to create alternate 
perspective angles and have the box automatically adjust and update.aced

GAUSE
Monika Gause
Monika Gause, an artist and author, created “Cityscape”as a frontpiece illustration 
for the typography chapter in her encyclopedic hardcover book for German 
readers, Adobe Illustrator CC. Her artistic inﬂuences included ﬁlms about Berlin 
nightlife from the 1920s, the ﬁlm Kapitaal by a Dutch design studio, and photos of 
Asian “tiger cities” by night. The neon Zierﬁsche (above”TAXI”) is a quite famous 
Berlin sign. She began by creating an initial color sketch in Adobe Ideas and 
opened it into Illustrator (Adobe Ideas Sketch).
434

Moving this sketch off to the side, she then constructed another very loose sketch 
on her main artboard with the Bristle Brush tool to help her visualize the 
perspective. Next, using her loose sketch as a guide, Gause set up her two-point 
perspective grid. Because you can’t extract undistorted elements from the grid 
once attached, she created the type and graphic elements for her image outside of 
the grid and off the artboard (on either side of the color sketch). After creating a 
black rectangle the size of her horizontal artboard she began constructing her 
cityscape. For each of her elements she activated the desired plane and used the 
Perspective Selection tool to Option/Alt drag a copy of it into the grid and position it 
within the composition. With her base image complete, and after conﬁrming that the 
Lock Station Point toggle was enabled, she shifted the perspective in her grid and 
moved the horizon line up, and her artwork within the grid automatically updated 
(Perspective Grid Shift). (See Gause’s ﬁles for details on how she created an 
outlined text version, which she then reattached to the grid.)

Mastering Complexity
Mastering Complexity
INTRODUCTION
The organized whole is more than the sum of its parts. Combining tools and 
techniques in Illustrator can yield WOW! results. In this chapter we’ll look at such 
synergy.
Please keep in mind that this chapter will be quite daunting, if not overwhelming, if 
you’re not comfortable with what has been covered in previous chapters.
In this chapter you’ll find a variety of techniques, including making patterns; 
working with opacity and transparency; creating multiple-object, shaped blends; 
working with different kinds of masks; and combining features to solve complex 
problems.
Permanent Pattern panel
To keep the Pattern Options panel in your workspace, dock it where you want it, then 
disable Auto-Exit Pattern Editing Mode in the panel’s pop-out menu. To ensure the 
panel stays permanently docked, save a custom workspace (see the chapter Your
Creative Workspace). To start a new pattern, use one of the methods to enter Pattern 
Editing Mode (see “Entering Pattern Editing Mode (PEM)” Entering PEM).
PATTERN MAKING
Prior to CS6, creating a pattern was laboriously manual. You had to draw all of the 
elements in a pattern tile within a bounding box. With the new Pattern Options 
panel, you can draw a pattern, adjust the size of the tile, create a repeat offset, and 
edit the elements, all while previewing multiple repeats with live updating of your 
edits.
Expanded pattern objects
Illustrator has to expand objects such as symbols and brushes before it can create a 
pattern swatch. To keep those features “live” for future edits, either design those 
portions of the artwork on the artboard first, bringing them into PEM, or after PEM 
warns you about expanding, cancel the Save. Still within PEM, select and copy the 
objects to the clipboard, then save the pattern and exit PEM. Paste the objects to 
your artboard. They won’t be part of the pattern, but you can still edit them as 
symbols, brushes, etc., rather than only having the option to edit them as discreet 
objects within the swatch itself.
436

Editing Mode (PEM). PEM is a special kind of isolation mode that fades back objects 
you’re not working on and inserts a gray control bar (the PEM isolation bar) between 
your document and the title bar (if you’re not familiar with isolation mode, see 
“Using Isolation Mode” in the chapter Your Creative Workspace). If you have specific 
artwork that you want to use in your pattern, select it before entering PEM. If you 
have nothing selected you’ll begin with a blank tile 100 px by 100 px, or the 
equivalent size measured in whatever units you’re currently using. There are two 
steps to being able to work in PEM: 1) you must open the Pattern Options panel, and 
2) you must actually enter PEM. Following are a few ways to simultaneously open the
Pattern Options panel and enter PEM:
• Choose Object> Pattern> Make—if you make patterns infrequently and you don’t
mind using menus.
• Create a custom keyboard shortcut (Edit menu) to quickly access the command if you
make patterns often.
• Double-click on an existing pattern swatch in the Swatches panel. This places the
swatch on the artboard in PEM and opens the Pattern Options panel.
Creating the pattern
While working in PEM you can always change the size of your pattern tile. To do this, 
either enter a new Width and Height for it in the Pattern Options panel, or use the 
Pattern Tile tool (located at the top of the Pattern Options panel) to interactively 
adjust the tile’s dimensions.
The Pattern Tile tool (not yet selected) for adjusting tiles, Swatch Bounds, and offsets interactively 
Entering Pattern Editing Mode (PEM)
You can still create a pattern by simply dragging a pattern tile to the Swatches panel, 
but to explore the power of designing patterns in Illustrator you must enter Pattern 
437

Within a PEM session, you can create your pattern using virtually any of Illustrator’s 
drawing tools. Use symbols and brushes, add gradients and effects, or modify paths 
with the Width tool, and Illustrator will happily allow you to make use of all these 
features within a PEM work session. However, because pattern swatches can’t retain 
brushes, symbols, and other complex features, Illustrator will expand these objects 
when you save your pattern as a swatch, and you won’t be able to take advantage of 
these features if you later try to re-edit the pattern. But unlike with older methods for 
creating pattern swatches, if you try to save a swatch in PEM, you’ll see a warning 
dialog that Illustrator needs to expand some objects in order to create the pattern 
swatch.
Upon entering PEM, you’ll be able to experiment with different layouts—in addition 
to a basic Grid layout, there are Brick and Hex layouts, both of which offer row and 
column offset options. Because editing a pattern with complex effects and 
appearances can slow down the redraw of your computer screen, you can control the 
number of tile repeats included in your preview from the Copies drop-down list. 
Directly below Copies you can choose to dim the repeats by a certain percentage, and 
hide or show both the tile edge and the bounding box (called Swatch Bounds) of the 
full repeat. Your Swatch Bounds might be larger than your tile edge when you use an 
offset to create the pattern.
Using Brick or Hex offsets you may see differences between Swatch 
Bounds (the outside boundary) and Tile Bounds—shown in red for clarity 
438

As you work on your pattern, you still have access to most Illustrator tools so you can 
edit paths and objects. Add and remove objects from the tile—even place objects 
straddling the tile edges. You’ll be able to judge how your pattern will work while you 
edit and adjust the layout, offset, and tile repeats. The repeats effectively let you see 
the pattern as it wraps around to the other side. Objects can overlap, and you can 
interactively alter how they overlap using the graphical buttons in the Pattern 
Options panel—right over left, top over bottom, or vice versa.

Vanishing artwork?
Objects and guides that were on the artboard before you entered PEM, remain on 
the artboard when you exit PEM. However, you can’t select guides with objects to 
take with you into PEM. If you create artwork while in PEM, Illustrator clears the 
artboard of those objects when you exit. Objects that get saved to the Pattern 
Swatch itself (because it is partially or wholly within the Swatch Bounds) are 
accessible as discrete objects later on if you edit the swatch in PEM.
What you can’t do in PEM
• You can’t enter isolation mode to edit the individual objects.
• You can’t use Draw Inside, but can use Draw Behind.
• You can’t duplicate layers, or add new layers or sublayers.
Leaving Pattern Editing Mode (PEM)
Once you’ve designed your pattern tile, there are several ways to exit Pattern Editing 
Mode (to keep the panel in your workspace, see the Tip “Permanent Pattern panel” at 
the beginning of this introduction):
• Double-click with a Selection tool outside the artwork.
• Click on the Done button on the PEM isolation bar (similar to the isolation mode
bar).
• Click on the Exit Pattern Editing Mode arrow beside the pattern’s name on the PEM
isolation bar.
• Press the Esc key.
• To simply exit Pattern Editing Mode without saving a swatch, click on Cancel on the
PEM isolation bar.

Creating variations on a pattern
If you intend to enter PEM by double-clicking a current pattern swatch, it’s best to 
get in the habit of editing a duplicate of the original first, then double-click the 
duplicate to begin editing. To do this, in the Swatches panel drag the pattern you want 
to duplicate over the New Swatch icon. When you then double-click on the duplicate, 
you’ll be editing the duplicate.
While inside Pattern Editing Mode, Illustrator lets you edit only one pattern swatch 
at a time. However, if as you work you create something that you want to save as a 
variation, you can save a copy of the pattern swatch in its current state, then continue 
to work on your main pattern. To do this, click on Save A Copy on the PEM isolation 
bar and name the copy, which is then placed in your Swatches panel. You’ll then be 
returned to PEM, and can resume editing your main pattern.

441

Editing pattern swatches without PEM
You can still edit your swatches conventionally outside of PEM; simply drag the 
pattern swatch onto the art-board and make whatever changes you like there. Edit 
the objects inside the main group, use Recolor Artwork, transform the scale of the 
pattern swatch, or add, remove, or reshape individual objects after selecting them 
with the Direct Selection tool. To make this tile back into a pattern, select the swatch 
with the Selection tool and drag it back into the Swatches panel. To replace a swatch, 
hold down the Option/Alt key as you drag a new swatch over an existing one.
Recoloring your patterns?
You’ve made a lovely pattern, but now you want to create color variations. Rather 
than just selecting individual objects within a pattern and assigning new colors, enter 
Recolor Artwork and apply custom color groups, or try to randomly rearrange color 
assignments! See the “Recolor a Pattern” lesson in the Color Transitions chapter for 
details on how to work with Re-color Artwork while in PEM.
TRANSPARENCY
Although the artboard may look white, Illustrator treats it as transparent. To visually 
distinguish the transparent areas from the non-transparent ones, choose View> 
Show Transparency Grid. Change the size and colors of the transparency grid in the 
File> Document Setup dialog. You can enable Simulate Colored Paper in the same 
dialog, if you’ll be printing on a colored stock. Click on the top swatch next to Grid 
Size to open the color picker and select a “paper” color. Both Transparency Grid and 
paper color are non-printing attributes that are only visible in on-screen preview 
once you click OK to exit the dialog.
The term transparency refers to any blending mode other than Normal and to any 
opacity setting that is less than 100%. Opacity masks and effects such as Feather or 
Drop Shadow use these settings as well. As a result, when you apply opacity masks or 
certain effects, you’re using Illustrator’s transparency features.
Opacity and blending modes
To reduce opacity, select or target an object, layer, or group in the Layers panel, then 
choose a blending mode or reduce the Opacity slider in the Transparency panel. You 
can also reveal Transparency panel controls for a selected object by clicking Opacity 
in the Appearance or Control panels. As it’s called “Opacity” (and not 
“Transparency”), an object or group is completely opaque when Opacity is 100%, and 
invisible when Opacity is 0%.
Blending modes control how the colors of objects, groups, or layers interact with one 
another. Blending modes will yield different results in RGB and CMYK. As in 
Photoshop, the blending modes show no effect when they’re over the transparent 
artboard. To see the effect of blending modes, you need to add a color-filled or white-
filled element behind your transparent object or group.
OPACITY MASKS
With an opacity mask, you can use the dark and light areas of one object (the mask) 
to mark transparent areas of other objects. Black areas of the mask will create 
transparent areas in the artwork it masks; white areas of the mask leave 
corresponding areas of the artwork opaque and visible; and gray values create a 
range of transparency. (This works exactly like Photoshop layer masks.)
To create an opacity mask, position one object or group you want to use as the mask 
in front of the artwork you want to mask. Select both the artwork and the masking 
object. (To mask a layer, first target the layer in the Layers panel.) Finally, click on 
Make Mask in the Transparency panel. The topmost object or group automatically 
becomes the opacity mask.

ing a spotlight effect, shown with the Trans-
parency and Layers panels
443

You may want to start with an empty mask and draw into it—in effect, painting your 
objects into visibility. To create an empty mask, start by targeting a single object, 
group, or layer. Double-click on the empty right-hand thumbnail to add an empty 
opacity mask and enter mask editing mode. Since the default behavior of new opacity 
masks is clipping (with a black background), you’ll need to turn off the “New Opacity 
Masks Are Clipping” option in the Transparency panel menu. If you don’t do this, 
and your targeted artwork disappears when you first create the empty mask, simply 
disable the Clip checkbox in the Transparency panel.
Objects being masked by an opacity mask are indicated by an un-
derscore in the Layers panel
Display the Transparency panel by clicking the underlined word 
Opacity for a selected object in the 
Appearance or Control panel (or via 
Window> Transparency); here focused on 
the opacity mask for illustration on the 
Opacity mask Layers panel
444

Now use your drawing and editing tools to create your mask. (For instance, if you 
create an object filled with a gradient, you’ll see your artwork through the dark areas 
of the gradient.) While the <Opacity Mask> thumbnail is selected, you won’t be able 
to select or edit anything else in your document. You’re in another type of isolation 
mode. To exit this mask-editing mode, you must click the artwork thumbnail on the 
right in the Transparency panel.
When you click the opacity mask thumbnail in the Transparency 
panel, the Layers panel displays only the ob-
jects within the opacity mask, and is indicat-
ed by the Layers panel tab name; try to keep 
the Layers, Transparency, and Appearance 
panels open when editing opacity masks
A few hints can help you with opacity masks. First, opacity masks are converted to 
grayscale, behind the scenes, when a mask is created (even though the opacity mask 
thumbnail still appears in color). The gray values between white and black simply 
determine how opaque or transparent the masked object is—light areas of the mask 
will be more opaque, and dark areas will be more transparent. In addition, if you 
select Invert Mask, you’ll reverse the effect of dark and light values on the opacity—
dark areas of the mask will be more opaque, and light areas will be more transparent. 
To identify which elements have been masked by an opacity mask, look for the 
dashed underline in the Layers panel.
The link icon in the Transparency panel indicates that the position of the opacity 
mask stays associated with the position of the object, group, or layer it is masking. 
Unlinking allows you to move the artwork without moving the mask. The content of 
the mask can be selected and edited just like any other object. You can transform or 
apply a blending mode and/or an opacity percentage to each individual object within 
the mask.
445

Editing opacity masks
• Disable/Enable: Shift-click the mask thumbnail to toggle the mask off (a red X will
appear over the preview) and on.
• Mask View: Option-click/Alt-click the mask thumbnail to toggle the viewing and
editing between the masking objects on the artboard, and the mask grayscale 
values.
• Release (in the Transparency panel): This releases the mask.
• Working on artwork or opacity mask: Click the appropriate icon to control what you
are editing.
• Link or unlink the opacity mask to artwork: Click the space between the mask and
artwork to toggle the link/unlink icon.
Precisely targeting and editing transparency
You can apply transparency to so many levels of a document that it can be a 
challenge to keep track of where you’ve applied it. For example, you can apply a 
blending mode to a path, then group it with several other objects and apply an 
opacity level to that group or to the layer that contains the group. To quickly and 
precisely locate and edit any transparent object, use the Layers, Appearance, and 
Transparency panels together. This is especially useful when you want to identify and 
edit the transparency of specific objects after using the Flattener Preview panel 
(covered in the next section) to see how current transparency settings will affect 
flattened output.
Remember that a gradient-filled circle in the Layers panel indicates that 
transparency is applied to an object, group, or layer, and an underlined name 
indicates that an opacity mask is applied. If the Appearance panel is open, it gives 
you access to the appearance details for the targeted object. Clicking the word 
Opacity in the Appearance panel (or the Control panel) displays detailed 
transparency settings for the targeted object. If you targeted an opacity mask, 
clicking the opacity mask thumbnail in the Transparency panel makes the Layers and 
Appearance panels provide information about the opacity mask.

• Are you still in mask-editing mode? When you have an opacity mask selected, the
file title and Layers panel tab will display <Opacity Mask>.
• Are you in Draw Behind or Draw Inside mode? Check the Draw Mode icons at the
bottom of the Toolbar to make sure you’re in Draw Normal mode.
BLENDS
Although gradients and mesh allow you to transition from one color to another, 
blends give you a way to “morph” one object’s shape and/or color into another. You 
can create blends between multiple objects, and even blend gradients, symbols, 
compound paths such as letters, or even Point type objects.  
446

Because blends are live, you can edit the key objects’ shape, color, size, location, or 
rotation, and the resulting in-between objects will automatically update. You can also 
distribute a blend along a custom path (see details later in this chapter).
The simplest way to create a blend is to double-click on the Blend tool to choose a 
setting for it, and then select the objects you wish to blend and choose Object> 
Blend> Make ( -Option-B/Ctrl-Alt-B). The setting you choose is persistent, so if 
you don’t first double-click on the tool, your setting for it becomes the last-used 
setting. To later adjust settings on an existing blend: select the blend, then double-
click the Blend tool (or choose Objects> Blend> Blend Options).
Another way to create blends between individual paths is to point map using the 
Blend tool. In the past, the Blend tool was used to achieve smooth transitions 
between blended objects. Now that it’s been modified, however, it’s probably best to 
use it for special morphing or twirling effects. To use the point map technique, begin 
by clicking on an anchor point of one object, and then on an anchor point of another 
object. Continue clicking on anchor points of any object you want to include in the 
blend. You can also click anywhere on the path of an object to achieve random 
blending effects.
To modify a key object before or after making a blend, Direct-Select the key object 
first, then use any editing tool (including the Pencil, Smooth, and Path Eraser tools) 
to make your changes.
Isolating blending & knockout
Choose Show Options from the Transparency panel pop-up menu to control how 
transparency is applied to groups and multiple objects. You get different effects 
depending on whether you select individual objects, target groups, or enable/disable 
Isolate Blending and/or Knockout Group. If you enable Isolate Blending for a 
selected group, then the transparency settings of the objects inside the group only 
affect how those objects interact with each other, and transparency isn’t applied to 
objects underneath the group. With a group or layer targeted, the Knockout Group 
option will keep individual objects of a group or layer from applying their 
transparency settings to each other where they overlap; for this reason, Illustrator 
automatically enables the Knockout Group option for all newly created blends. See 
the “Opacity&Blending.ai” ReadMe on WOW! ONLINE for examples.
447

Blend Options
To specify options as you blend, use the Blend tool (see the “point map” directions in 
the previous section) and press the Option/Alt key as you click the second point. In 
Blend Options you can change settings before making the blend. To adjust options on 
a completed blend, select it and double-click the Blend tool (or choose Object> 
Blend> Blend Options). Opening Blend Options without a blend selected sets the 
defaults for creating blends in this work session—these options reset each time you 
restart the program:
• Speciﬁed Steps specifies the number of steps between each pair of key objects (the
limit is 1,000). Using fewer steps results in clearly distinguishable objects; a larger 
number of steps results in an almost airbrushed effect.
• Speciﬁed Distance places a specified distance between the objects of the blend.
• Smooth Color automatically calculates the ideal number of steps between key objects
in a blend, in order to achieve the smoothest color transition. If objects are the same 
color, or are gradients or patterns, this option equally distributes the objects within 
the blend, based on their size.
• Orientation determines how the individual blend objects rotate as they follow the
path’s curves. Align to Page (the default, first icon) prevents objects from rotating as 
they’re distributed along the path’s curve (objects stay “upright” as they blend along 
the curve). Align to Path allows blend objects to rotate as they follow along the path.
To insert objects into a blend
Group-Select a key object and Option-drag/Alt-drag to insert a new key object (the 
blend will reflow). You can also insert new objects by double-clicking it to enter 
isolation mode, or by dragging them into the blend in the Layers panel.
Blends along a path
There are two ways to make blends follow a curved path. The first way is to use the 
Direct Selection tool to select the spine of a blend (the path automatically created by 
the blend) and then use the Add/Delete Anchor Point tools, or any of the following 
tools, to curve or edit the path: the Direct Selection, Lasso, Convert Anchor Point, 
Pencil, Smooth, or even the Path Eraser tool. As you edit the spine of the blend, 
Illustrator automatically redraws the blend objects to align to the edited spine.
Secondly, you can also replace the spine with a customized path. Select both the 
customized path and the blend, and choose Object> Blend> Replace Spine. This 
command moves the blend to its new spine.
You can also blend between pairs of grouped objects. If you’re not getting the results 
you expect, try creating your first set of objects and grouping them (
-G/Ctrl-G). 
Now copy and paste a duplicate set (or Option/Alt and drag to create a copy of your 
group). Select the two sets of grouped objects and blend by choosing Specified Steps 
as the blend option. Once the objects are blended, you can rotate and scale them, and 
use the Direct Selection tool to edit the objects or the spine. (To experiment with a 
pair of grouped blends in this way, find the figures Blend Tool Tomato Vine on 
WOW! ONLINE as “AaronMcGarry-blends.ai.”)

Steps, and a custom S curve “spine” (see 
Aaron McGarry’s explanation on WOW! 
ONLINE)
449

What can you do with blends?
Besides editing objects you can:
• Reverse the direction of a blend, with Object> Blend> Reverse Front to Back. Or
reverse the order of objects on a spine by choosing Object> Blend> Reverse Spine.
• Release blends (Object> Blend> Release) to remove blends, leaving key objects
and spines. Hint: Select> Select All releases multiple blends simultaneously.
• Choose Object> Blend> Expand to turn a blend into a group of separate, editable
objects.
CLIPPING MASKS
All of the objects involved in a mask are organized in one of two ways depending on 
how you choose to make your mask. One method collects all selected objects into a 
group. The other method allows you to keep your layer structure, by placing layers 
within a master “container” layer (Clipping Masks In Layers Panel). With any kind of 
clipping mask, the topmost object of that group is the clipping path; this clips (hides) 
portions of the other objects in the group that extend beyond the clipping mask 
boundaries, leaving only the parts within these boundaries visible. Regardless of the 
attributes assigned to this top object, once you create the mask, it becomes an 
unfilled and unstroked clipping path (but keep reading to see how you can apply a 
stroke and fill to the new clipping path!). In the Layers panel, an active clipping mask 
will appear as an underlined <Clipping Path> and will remain underlined even if you 
rename it.
Choosing Object> Clipping Mask> Make 
puts all of the masked 
objects into a group 
with the clipping path at 
the top of the group
To make a clipping mask from an object, you must first 
create that object. Only a single path can be used as a 
clipping mask, which means that complex shapes or multiple 
paths must be combined into a single “compound path” 
before being used as a mask (using Object> Compound 
Path> Make). Make sure your path or compound path is 
above the objects to be clipped, then create the clipping mask 
using one of two options—use either the Make/Release 
Clipping Mask icon on the Layers panel, or the Object> 
Clipping Mask> Make command. Each has its inherent 
advantages and disadvantages. The Object menu command 
gathers all the objects into a new group as it masks, allowing 
you to have multiple masked objects within a layer. It also 
gives you the ability to freely move masked objects within a 
layer structure without breaking the mask. However, if you 
have a carefully planned layer structure, it will be lost when 
everything is grouped. In contrast, the Layers panel 
command maintains your layer structure as it masks, but you 
can’t have separately masked objects within a layer without 
building sublayers or grouping them first. This makes it 
difficult to move masked objects as a unit.
450

Choose Clipping Mask> Make from the Object menu (top), or use 
the Make/Release Clipping Mask icon on the 
Layers panel (bottom)
After you’ve created a clipping mask, you can edit the masking object, and the objects 
within the mask, by selecting it using any selection tools, such as the Lasso or Direct 
Selection tools, then editing it with your typical path-editing tools, including live 
effects. When working with masks created using the Object menu, clipped objects are 
now hidden when clipped by a mask; when the mask contents aren’t selected, you 
won’t accidentally select clipped objects outside of the masked path.
To move your clipped object (path and contents) simply select it with the Selection 
tool and move it. If you wish to select, move, or edit the clipping path or the contents 
independently, then you have a few options. If neither is selected, you can simply 
click on the clipping path or contents with the Direct Selection or Group Selection 
tool to edit or move that path or selection. If any portion of the mask or contents is 
already selected, you can click the Edit Clipping Path or Edit Contents buttons in the 
Control panel to focus on which portion will be selected and can be edited.
You also can edit your clipping group in isolation mode. To isolate the entire clipping 
<Group>, double-click on any portion of it with the Selection tool; this dims all other 
objects on your artboard. If you prefer, enter isolation mode via the Layers panel. 
Highlight the <Clipping Path> or any of the paths within the <Group> and choose 
Enter Isolation Mode from the Layers panel popup menu. You can now use the Edit 
Clipping Path or Edit Contents buttons, or use the Direct Selection and Group 
Selection tools.
Once in isolation mode you can freely edit or move the paths without affecting any 
other objects. If you are in isolation mode with one of the objects within the mask, 
you can even add additional objects within that grouping. To exit, double-click on the 
artboard (outside of the clipping group), press the Esc key, click on the gray isolation 
bar, or choose Exit Isolation Mode from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
Yet another way that you can determine which portion of your clipping group you 
wish to edit is by choosing Object> Clipping Mask> Edit Mask (or Object> Clipping 
Mask> Edit Content).
Once you have created a clipping group and mask, you can then add a stroke (it will 
appear as if it’s in front of all masked objects) and/or a fill (it appears as if it’s behind 
all masked objects). In addition, once the mask has been made, in the Layers panel 
you can even move the clipping path lower in the stacking order of the group or 
container (where it may no longer be the top path in the layer order) and still keep its 
masking effect.
451

Magical clipping path
Once an object is a clipping path, move it anywhere within its layer or group in the 
Layers panel—it still maintains its masking effect!
Draw Inside (fast masks)
See the Rethinking Construction chapter for details on the super quick way to make a 
clipping mask: using the Draw Inside mode.
Pasting objects into a mask
To paste cut or copied objects into a clipping mask, make sure Paste Re members 
Layers is off (in the Layers panel menu), then select an object within the mask and 
use Paste in Front or Back to place the copied object within the mask. You can also 
create or paste objects while in isolation mode.
Clipping Mask icon disabled
In the Layers panel, you must select the container (layer, sublayer, or group) that 
holds your intended clipping object before you can apply a clipping mask. Also, in 
order for the icon in the Layers panel to be enabled, the top item inside the 
highlighted container must be something that can be turned into a clipping path.
Selecting clipping masks
To select all of your currently unlocked clipping masks at once, choose Select> 
Object> Clipping Masks.
Masking technique #1: The Object command
The simplest way to create masks for objects is using the Object menu command (
-7/Ctrl-7). Use this method when you want to confine the clipping mask to a specific 
object or group of objects that need to be easily duplicated or relocated, or when you 
have more than one clipping mask per layer. Since this method modifies your layer 
structure, don’t use it if you need to maintain objects on specific layers.
At left the clipping mask (outlined in blue) above the ﬂoral illustra-
tion was created as 7 separate objects (6 
petals and 1 center circle) and then united 
into a single compound path (using 
Object> Compound Path); at right after 
positioning this compound path on top of 
other objects, then using it as a clipping 
mask 
452

As before, start by creating an object or compound object that will become your 
clipping mask. Make sure that it’s the topmost object, then select it and all the objects 
you want to be masked (this topmost object will become the mask). Now, choose 
Object> Clipping Mask> Make. When you use this method, all the objects, including 
the new clipping path, will move to the layer that contains your topmost object and 
will be collected into a new <Group>. This will restrict the masking effect to only 
those objects within the group; you can easily use the Selection tool to select the 
entire clipping group. If you expand the <Group> in the Layers panel (by clicking the 
expansion triangle), you’ll be able to move objects into or out of the clipping group, 
or move objects up or down within the group to change the stacking order. (Don’t 
miss the Tip “Magical clipping path” Magical Clipping Path.)
Before masking (left), the black-stroked circle is positioned as the 
topmost object in the stacking order, so it 
will become the clipping path when the clip-
ping mask is created (right)
You can add a stroke and ﬁll to a mask. The middle ﬁgure shows an 
unstroked mask; the right ﬁgure shows a 
dark blue stroke and a light blue ﬁll added to 
the clipping mask
453

Masking technique #2: The Layers panel method
To mask unwanted areas of art within a container (meaning any group, sublayer, or 
layer), first create an object to use as your mask—make sure it’s the topmost object in 
your container. Next, highlight that object’s container and click the Make/Release 
Clipping Mask icon on the Layers panel. The result: The topmost object, within the 
highlighted container, becomes the clipping path, and all elements within that 
container extending beyond the clipping path are hidden (for details on how to use 
complex objects as a mask, see the section “Using type, compound paths, or shapes 
as a mask” below).
Once you’ve created a clipping mask, you can move objects up or down within the 
container (layer, sublayer, or group) to change the stacking order. But if you move 
items outside of the clipping mask container, they’ll no longer be masked. Moving 
the clipping path itself outside of its container releases the mask completely. 
Clipping Mask Release warning
In a layer that contains more than one clipping mask, clicking the Make/Release 
Clipping Mask icon will release all clipping masks within that layer (not just the one 
you may wish to release). The safest way to release a single clipping mask is to select 
it and choose Object> Clipping Mask> Release. —Jean-Claude Tremblay
Multiple artboard masks
Since layers are common to multiple artboards, if you make a mask using the Layer 
panel method, that mask will apply across multiple artboards. In order for artwork on 
other artboards to be seen, it must be above or below the layers being masked.
Mask button
If you use File> Place to place an image, when the placed image is selected, you can 
instantly create a clipping path for the image by clicking the Mask button in the 
Control panel. However, masking is not immediately apparent because the clipping 
path has the same dimensions as the placed image’s bounding box. Make sure the 
Edit Clipping Path button (in the Control panel) is enabled, then adjust the 
clipping path mask that’s “cropping” your image. 
454

Mask error message
If you get the message, “Selection cannot contain objects within different groups 
unless the entire group is selected,” cut or copy your selected objects (to remove 
them from the group), then Paste in Front. Now you can apply Object> Clipping 
Mask> Make.
In the Control panel: when a placed image is selected, the Mask but-
ton (left) appears; when an object using a mask is 
selected, the Edit Clipping Path and Edit Contents 
buttons (left and right respectively in the right-
hand ﬁgure)
Figuring out if it’s a mask
• <Clipping Path> in the Layers panel will be underlined if it’s a mask (even if you’ve
renamed it), and the background color for the icon will be gray.
• The phrase “Clip Group” in your Control panel means your selection contains a
clipping mask.
• An opacity mask appears in the Layers panel as < Path > with a dotted underline,
but as <Opacity Mask> if it’s active in the Transparency panel.
• Select> Object> Clipping Masks to help you find masks within a file (but not inside
linked files).
Using type, compound paths, or shapes as a mask
You can use editable type as a mask to give the appearance that the type is filled with 
any image or group of objects. Select the type and the image or objects with which 
you want to fill the text. Make sure the type is on top, then choose Object> Clipping 
Mask> Make.
To use separate type characters as a single clipping mask, you have to first make 
them into a compound shape or compound path. You can make a compound shape 
from either outlined or live text. You can make a compound path only from outlined 
text (not live text). Once you’ve made a compound path or shape out of separate type 
elements, you can use it as a mask. Look for Chana Messer’s typographic poster 
gallery at the end of the Designing Type & Layout chapter for an example of using 
Draw Inside mode to mask an image with type.
Collect in New Layer
To collect selected layers into one “master layer,” Shift-click or 
-click/Ctrl-click 
multiple layers and choose Collect in New Layer from the Layers menu.
RELATED TIPS
Exporting to Photoshop
When you export Illustrator artwork in Photoshop (PSD) format, you may end up with 
many sublayers if the artwork uses objects such as brushes, symbols, and blends. 
To simplify the exported document, target the sublayer that contains the problematic 
objects, enable the Knockout Group checkbox in the Transparency panel, and then 
export again. 
455

The art of flattening
In Illustrator, transparency exists only within the program. In order to print or save in 
another format, Illustrator will “flatten” the objects where they overlap with 
transparency; in the case of printing, Illustrator flattens only temporarily, but if you 
save in formats such as EPS, or AI 9 or earlier, your image will be permanently 
flattened. When flattened, some objects may be split into many separate objects, 
while others may be rasterized. For more details, search adobe.com for “print 
production guide transparency” to access “Adobe Applications: A Print Production 
Guide.”
 COMBINING COMPLEXITY WITH ILLUSTRATOR CC
With every new version of Illustrator, we all find ourselves counting how many 
brand-new, high-impact features the version includes, and seldom pay much 
attention to those less dramatic features that will help us be more productive. With 
added complexity in our artwork, however, every enhancement saves us time and 
frustration. Illustrator CC’s latest features primarily involve major enhancements to 
brushes and working with type. But some of the smaller new features might actually 
be game-changers in the way we interact with Illustrator, from the most basic 
drawing functions to the most complex artwork and layouts we can create.
The galleries in the CC section at the end of this chapter further explore integrating 
Photoshop with the creation of raster brushes, enlist Live Rectangles as clipping 
masks, use Live Corners for creating complex repeating patterns, and of course, 
provide you with amazing inspiration. If you’re using CC, try using the CS6-
compatible lessons and galleries as a fresh starting point for exploring CC features. 
Imagine creating the following examples with the latest Illustrator CC 
enhancements:
• Stephen Klema’s Guides for Arcs lesson, in Designing Type & Layout—placing guides
precisely by clicking on the ruler instead of entering numeric positioning data.
• Raymond Larrett’s Pattern Brushes lesson, in Expressive Strokes—creating the shapes for
the robots using raster brushes and possibly auto-generated corners.
• Dedree Drees’ “The Dory,” in Reshaping Dimensions—drawing undulating seagrass
with the Pencil tool’s new Fidelity smoothing algorithm.
• Gustavo del Vechio’s “Carrot Tree Restaurant,” in Reshaping Dimensions—altering the
perspective after creating the artwork on a Two Point Perspective Grid.
• Chris Nielsen’s motorcycles in this chapter—creating hyperrealism with the Pen tool’s
drawing enhancements.
A Live Rectangle bonus
456

When you add additional strokes or fills to a Live Rectangle via the Appearance 
panel, even if you add effects, all will maintain the same corner radii as the original 
rectangle when the object is edited using either widgets or the Transform panel.
—Gary Ferster
Tracing with strokes
To trace line art (like that found in a children’s coloring book), using the “centerline” 
model (so you have a single path defining a stroke, and not paths on either side of a 
stroke), make sure that your art is easily translated by stroked (not filled) paths, and 
choose Line Art as a preset. This can be great for tracing logos or hand lettering.
Artboards can mask artwork
Illustrator artboards can themselves act as cropping masks for the artwork that 
extends beyond the artboard. Create as many artboards as you wish to define detail 
areas (overlapping is fine). On placing the .ai file into InDe-sign or Photoshop, 
enable “Show Import Options,” choose your desired artboard (Page), and in Options 
choose Crop To> Media.
Whether illustrating or designing, Illustrator CC’s enhancements help remove 
complexity, freeing you to concentrate more than ever on being creative.
GLITSCHKA
Pattern Making
Navigating the Pattern Options Panel
Overview: Create a pattern or edit an existing one; work in Pattern Editing Mode with the 
Pattern Options panel to adjust pattern repeats, varying spacing, offset, and overlap; create 
copies of patterns and experiment with offsets and settings to create and save pattern varia-
tions to the Swatches panel.
Adobe commissioned Von Glitschka to produce a set of pattern swatches that would 
ship with Illustrator CS6. For each pattern he drew key elements for one tile, scanned 
and placed the sketch into Illustrator, and then hand-traced the elements as vector 
objects. Selecting the vector objects, he then used the Pattern Options panel to 
experiment with offset and spacing possibilities, getting instant feedback with each 
change. This lesson uses his “Diadem” pattern, which you can find in the Swatch 
Libraries menu under Patterns> Decorative> Vonster Patterns.
457

1 Creating the ﬁrst pattern repeat. To follow along using Glitschka’s Diadem pattern, 
first protect the original by copying it (drag the pattern in the Swatches panel to the 
New Swatch icon), then double-click on the copy to automatically open the Pattern 
Options panel and enter Pattern Editing Mode (PEM). To use your own artwork in-
stead, select it and choose Object> Pattern> Make. In PEM, changes to settings im-
mediately update, so when you adjust settings for Copies, be aware that with 
complex artwork, increased repeats can slow down screen redraw. When you open an 
existing pattern in PEM, PEM loads the Tile Type saved with the pattern. If you 
create a new pattern, then the default Tile Type will be Grid. You control the space 
between re-peats by adjusting the size of the tile’s bounding box, either with Size Tile 
to Art en-abled and numeric input for H and V Spacing, or interactively by using the 
Pattern Tile tool. With the Pattern Tile tool selected, use the square anchors to 
enlarge or re-duce the gap between repeats. To create an overlap, make the tile 
bounding box smaller and choose the desired Overlap features. As your pattern 
progresses, you might want to evaluate it by zooming out, temporarily disabling both 
Dim Copies and Show Tile Edge, and increasing the repeats. Undo/Redo is available 
while in PEM and can even back you out of PEM. At any time you can save the 
current version of the pattern as a swatch, but stay in PEM to create more variations, 
by clicking Save a Copy and naming it. Now you can continue editing and 
experimenting with the pat-tern. To save this version as the final one and exit PEM, 
click Done. If you click Can-cel, no changes are saved to your original pattern in the 
Swatches panel.

2 Experimenting with pattern offsets. To experiment with pattern offsets, you can stay in 
PEM or start over with a new copy. Make sure that both Show Tile Edge and Show 
Swatch Bounds are enabled. Any artwork that is within, overlaps, or touches the 
Swatch Bounds will be included in the pattern. To make your tile resize to the exact 
size of your art, enable Size Tile to Art (if it’s enabled, you may have to disable and 
then re-enable it).
2
Using Brick by Row to start an offset repeat of the pattern, 
adjusted with the Pattern Tile tool to make the repeats ﬁt with a 
slender gap between them 
460

Glitschka offset “Diadem” using the Hex by Row tile type, which naturally fits this 
design with little manipulation, but you can also use Brick by Row with a Brick Offset 
of 1/2 to tuck the repeats close together. Brick Offset controls the position of each 
repeat relative to the others. When the Pattern Tile tool is active, you can adjust the 
Brick Offset in fixed intervals by dragging the diamond widget on the Tile Edge to the 
right or left.
With either Hex by Row or Brick by Row as your Tile Type, grab a square anchor on a 
corner or side, and drag inwards to bring the artwork closer together. Hold the 
Option/Alt key to resize two sides symmetrically, and add the Shift key to resize the 
entire tile proportionally. When you see something you like, click Save a Copy and 
remain in PEM, or click Done to save the swatch and exit PEM.

REINHART
Layered Patterns
Building Depth and Complexity in PEM
Advanced Technique
Overview: Design basic elements for your pattern and enter PEM; establish a height and 
width for your tile; choose a Tile Type; position the pattern elements and experiment with 
Swatch Bounds; vary the level of detail to enhance depth.
Sabine Reinhart specializes in creating richly complex, layered patterns, constructed 
so all the elements involved enhance the illusion of depth. Illustrator’s Pattern 
Editing Mode (PEM) makes it easier than ever to experiment with the placement of 
elements as Reinhart gradually builds up her pattern. Although her patterns are 
often large enough to slow most computers down to a crawl, the organic look she 
achieves rewards her patience.
1 Starting the pattern tile with its ﬁrst elements. Rein-hart had drawn her main elements, 
created a color group, and determined the size and tile type (Grid in this case) before 
she began her pattern. Selecting her artwork, she entered Pattern Editing Mode (Ob-
ject> Pattern> Make), and manually entered the Width and Height in the Patterns 
panel. Using the Move tool, she adjusted the position of each flower so that it over-
lapped the Swatch Bounds (which in the Grid tile type is the same as the Tile size, 
and shown Grid tile size outlined in red for clarity), leaving room for adding subordi-
nate artwork both above and below the first objects.
462

1
Planning ahead by drawing artwork, creating a color group, and 
setting the size of the pattern tile
2 Designing patterns using Swatch Bounds. As long as you are within PEM, you can 
freely use the entire canvas to design new elements and plan your pattern. Because 
the Swatch Bounds define the parameters of the actual pattern, however, your pat-
tern will only be made up of any objects that are at least partially touching the edge 
or the interior of the Swatch bounds. Objects contained by the Swatch Bounds, over-
lapping it, or touching an edge somewhere will automatically appear in the opposite 
quadrants of the pattern repeat. For instance, when Rein-hart placed a dark green 
flower outside—but still touch-ing—the Swatch bounds, it was included in the pat-
tern, and as long as she set Copies to more than 1 x 1, she could preview where the 
object was repeated within the pattern.
2
Adding layers both above and below the initial artwork; 
elements transformed and recolored 
463

Be aware that if you’re using Brick or Hex layout (instead of Grid), changing the 
offset or offset type (by row or column) can cause the Swatch Bounds to grow or 
shrink in size. Artwork that was previously outside Swatch Bounds might now fall 
within the pattern, and vice versa. In addition, when you create art in PEM, any 
objects that aren’t included in the pattern swatch will be deleted; if you wish to keep 
any objects that are not included in the pattern, copy the objects to the clipboard 
before exiting PEM, and paste them into a new file.
3 Adding new artwork. After getting the first flowers placed, Reinhart started adding 
more flowers, duplicating, transforming, and coloring them while inside PEM. She 
emphasized depth by overlapping some flowers in front and in back of others, by 
scaling, and by altering the artwork to show less detail as she moved it further to the 
back of the stack. She intermingled a few butterflies and, at the very bottom, added a 
light-colored rectangle with no stroke to conceal any gaps in the pattern and give it 
an airy, organic appearance. She named the pattern in the Patterns panel and clicked 
Done to save her pattern to the Swatches panel. Later, she would use Recolor Art-
work to create variations (see her lesson in the Color Transitions chapter for details 
about how she did this).

and adding her personal European touch to the designs, she created the patterns 
used on the cover of The Adobe Illustrator CS6 WOW! Book as part of a collection she 
called “Lost in Paradise.” She used Illustrator’s new Pattern Options panel and 
Pattern Editing Mode to help her visualize the ﬂow of the elements as they were 
repeated. Peachpit designer Mimi Heft later wove Reinhart’s patterns into the cover 
design in InDesign, placing a version of one bird on top of the O in WOW! (For 
more about how Reinhart creates her patterns, see the “Layered Patterns” tutorial in 
this chapter and the “Recolor a Pattern” lesson in Color Transitions.) Reinhart named 
the leaf and peacock feather pattern (above right) “Kimaya,” meaning “Divine,” and 
the peacock and ﬂower pattern (top left) “Jamini,” meaning “Night.” Through these 
patterns she celebrated the exuberance, rich heritage, and mystery found in India’s 
ancient life and culture.

Ann Paidrick
When Ann Paidrick opened a package, she saw the crumpled paper used for 
shipping as an artistic gift of inspiration. She photographed a few pieces, then used 
Illustrator to trace each and create patterns using the traced objects. She chose the 
16-color Preset in Image Trace to convert her scans to vector objects with strong 
abstract coloring. After some cleanup, she arranged two of the objects and entered 
Pattern Editing Mode. She experimented with the Tile Type and layout, and decided 
on Hex by Row for these versions. She used the Pattern Tile tool to interactively 
adjust the Tile Edge, squeezing and pulling on the hex shape, and adjusted the 
Overlap. Whenever she found a pleasing arrangement, she clicked on Save a Copy 
on the isolation bar. Between Illustrator’s Image Trace and Pattern Editor features, 
Paid-rick was able to use found objects to quickly produce unique and complex 
vector patterns.

HAMANN
Roping in Paths
Using Masks and Pathﬁnders for Shapes
Advanced Technique
Overview: Create and organize layers, place a scanned sketch, and draw shapes; draw paths 
for the rope, outline their strokes, feather their ﬁlls, and draw masks; make a compound path, 
duplicate it, and reshape it.
When Angels on Earth magazine needed an online illustration featuring a heroic angel 
saving a woman from drowning, illustrator Brad Hamann responded with layering, 
masks, and pathfinder tools in “Angel in the Rapids.”
1 Scanning a sketch, organizing layers, and drawing shapes. Hamann began by drawing 
and scanning a pencil sketch and placing it in Illustrator on a template layer.
470

1
Hamann’s scan of the pencil sketch he made from the photographs 
he took of himself
Hamann’s design called for layering so that artwork like the tubes and rope appeared 
in front of or behind other artwork. He created layers in the Layers panel based on 
visual hierarchy. To outline the angel against the rest of the image, Hamann created 
a blue outline of the angel, then a white one. To do this he copied the head and body 
objects, then used Paste in Back, and then applied Path-finder> Unite. Giving this 
new shape a blue stroke and fill, he copied it, used Paste in Back, and then gave this 
duplicate outline a white fill and a wider white stroke.
2 Making and masking the rope. Hamann created the rope in sections, drawing paths 
between objects for the tubes and hands. He smoothed the curvature of the ropes by 
adjusting direction lines with the Direct Selection tool. To give the selected rope 
paths a dark blue edge with a light fill, he first changed the paths to a 4-pt, dark blue 
stroke. Next Hamann chose Object> Path> Outline Stroke and changed the stroke to 
1 pt and the fill to orange. Finally, to add a subtle highlight to the rope, Hamann 
chose Effect> Stylize> Inner Glow and in the dialog entered 24 for Opacity and 0.03 
inches for Blur, and clicked OK.

paths after choosing Object> Path> Outline 
Stroke, ﬁlling them with orange, and then ap-
plying Inner Glow to the ﬁlls

Where each rope section was cut off by another object, Hamann masked the rope by 
the edge of the other objects’ strokes. He decided that drawing the masks by hand 
would be precise enough for the resolution of a web graphic. To mask the rope where 
it joined the fist, for example, Hamann drew a shape with the Pen tool that loosely 
surrounded the rope except for where the rope was cut off by the fist. For that area, 
he drew the path of the masking shape by hand along the edge of the fist’s blue 
stroke. Finally, he selected the masking shape and the rope and chose Object> 
Clipping Mask> Make.
3 Drawing the tube. For the tube draped over the angel’s left arm, Hamann drew a yel-
low-filled path for the tube’s outer edge and another path for the tube’s center hole. 
He selected both objects and chose Object> Compound Path> Make. To form shad-
ows, he copied the compound path and used Paste in Front, then filled this duplicate 
with a darker yellow. With the duplicate still selected, Hamann used the Scissors tool 
to make two cuts on the right side of the outer edge, then selected and deleted the 
outer left edge of the compound path. Next, he used the Pen tool to redraw the shad-
ow path between the two open points. When he completed the path, he filled it with 
a darker yellow and then chose Effect> Stylize> Feather, changed the feather radius 
to 0.05, and clicked OK. Hamann finished by drawing highlight shapes and pasting 
an-other duplicate of the tube in front, changing its fill to None and stroke to dark 
blue.

FERSTER
Adding Highlights
Using Transparency to Create Highlights
Advanced Technique
Overview: Create highlights in objects for the interior of the cell using the Blend tool; stack 
them and lower opacity; create highlights with gradients for other objects and reduce opacity; 
create a bright lens ﬂare.
Adding transparency to blended or gradient-filled objects, or conversely, eliminating 
transparency beneath a lens flare, gives you a great deal of versatility when 
constructing believable highlights.
1 Using multiple techniques for blending colors in order to simulate natural highlighting.
When Gary Ferster wanted to illustrate a living cell, he chose various methods for 
constructing blended highlights. For the mitochondrion (pinkish objects), he used 
the Blend tool to create two initial shapes, one very light, and one the “local” color. 
When blended smoothly, this method created soft highlights. He then stacked one 
blended object over the other and reduced the opacity in each, in order to make them 
appear to be part of the cell. For the small bubbles (lysosomes) and nucleus in the 
cell, however, Ferster used simple radial gradients with a very light center gradating 
to the local color of the object. By adjusting the gradient stops, he could make high-
lights bigger or smaller, with sharper or more feathered edges, and then adjust opaci-
ty to blend these objects into the cell.
1
After creating an object by blending a light object with a 
darker, same-shaped object to represent a highlight, 
transparency further blends the “lit” object (mitochondrion) 
into its surroundings 
474

Adjusting the radial gradient adjusts the size and edge of the high-
light, while transparency settings adjust the 
ﬁnal blend into another object
2 Using the Lens Flare tool for maximum highlighting. Nothing suggests a powerful light 
source quite like a lens flare, but Ferster had observed that using the Lens Flare tool 
over a transparent background creates a dulled, gray flare. A simple solution was to 
draw a solid white rectangle, at least as big as the flare, behind all the objects. The 
part of the lens flare that extended beyond the cell became white, disappearing into 
the background entirely.
2
The Lens Flare tool needs a non-transparent background to 
reach maximum brightness

GUSMAN JOLY
Annie Gusman Joly
Transparency can be created with Blending Modes that interact with the layers 
beneath, forming new colors based on the type of Blending Mode used. Artist Annie 
Gusman Joly uses them here to create a complex pattern of shadows. In this tropical 
forest, light ﬁlters through the leaves and ﬂowers to fall on the ground beneath the 
white bird’s feet. To create the random and overlapping patterns, Joly ﬁrst ﬁlls a large 
object on one layer with a solid blue. After drawing the path for the shadows on the 
layer above, she ﬁlls it with blue and sets the Blending Mode to Multiply. If the shadow 
color is too dark, she reduces the layer Opacity to increase the shadow layer’s 
transparency. She uses the same technique for the shadow beneath her three-toed 
sloth.

GUSMAN JOLY
Moonlighting
Using Transparency for Glows & Highlights
Advanced Technique
Overview: Create a Radial gradient with transparency for a circular object; use the Blend tool 
with a duplicate object to create a circular or oval blend with transparency; create a glow or 
477

Because the glowing moon is circular in Annie Gusman Joly’s “Solo-Flight” 
illustration about growing up an identical twin, it could be created by using either a 
radial gradient or a shaped blend. The key to making a gradient or blend work 
against any background is to use transparency for the edge of the object that touches 
the background.
1 Creating a glow from a Radial gradient. With the object selected, click on it once with 
the Gradient tool to fill with the last-used or default gradient, and, if necessary, 
change the type in the Gradient panel to Radial. Either in the Gradient panel or with 
the aid of the Gradient Annotator, double-click on each color stop and choose the 
same color for them. Reduce the opacity for the stop that represents the outer edge to 
0%; drag the opposite color stop inward to make the solid part of the object bigger 
and more solid, and adjust the Gradient slider between them (the diamond shape on 
the top of the gradient bar) to create a larger or smaller amount of feather (or 
“glow”).

Gradient panel (bottom) to create a gradient 
with transparency

Drag the color stop for the inner object toward the transparent 
stop to make the object larger; drag the dia-
mond to alter the size of the glow
2 Creating a glow for a circular object from an object blend. With a pale yellow Fill color, 
choose a stroke of None, and draw a circle (Shift-drag with the Ellipse tool). With 
Smart Guides on (View menu), move your cursor over the circle until you see the 
word “center,” hold down Option/Alt, and Shift-drag out a new, smaller circle. Set 
the Opacity of the larger circle to 0%. Select both circles and choose Object> Blend> 
Make (
-Option-B/CtrlAlt-B); then double-click the Blend tool in the toolbox to ad-
just the steps. For this example, somewhere between 20 and 30 steps makes a very 
glowing moon.

479

3
Creating the second object with Offset Path (top left) and using 
Object> Blend> Make; the default Smooth 
Color doesn’t blend (top right), but switching 
to Speciﬁed Steps creates the glow
This shaped-blend method can also be used for making any shape or size of highlight 
for any object. By creating the highlight as a separate object, you gain the advantage 
of being able to change the object’s color later without having to reconstruct the 
object and the blend.
3 Shaping a glow with a blend made from non-circular objects. When you don’t have a cir-
cle or oval path, only a blend can “shape” the glow evenly around the object. So that 
the glowing object can be placed over any background, we’ll continue to create the 
glow with transparency. Create your first object—here, a crescent moon filled with 
pale yellow and no stroke. Many asymmetrical shapes don’t scale easily relative to 
the original’s boundaries, so with your object selected, choose Object> Path> Offset 
Path. Enable Preview and use a negative number for a smaller object. Select the larg-
er object and, in the Transparency panel, set the Opacity to 0%. Now select both 
paths and choose Object> Blend> Make. If you haven’t already created a blend with 
the Specified Steps or Specified Distance Spacing option in your current working ses-
sion, Illustrator might use Smooth Color. Smooth Color doesn’t create a glow, but 
rings the inner crescent moon with a lighter color. To get the glow, double-click on 
the Blend tool to open the dialog and choose Specified Steps for the Spacing option. 
Around 25 steps should create a decent glow. If necessary, adjust the offset, miter, 
and path edges until the blend is smooth and glowing.

one transparent object
NIELSEN
Chris Nielsen
When Chris Nielsen came across this one-of-a-kind, custom chopper by Matt 
Hotch, he knew he had to illustrate it with his signature PhotoRealist technique. He 
knew his basic 8 MP digital point-and-shoot camera would capture enough detail, 
but with many other custom bikes parked in the same shop, getting the reference 
shot at all was a major undertaking.  
481

Once he brought it into Illustrator, he used the same methods described on the 
opposite page, relying on the Pen tool to draw progressively smaller details, and 
the Path-ﬁnder panel with the Divide command to create the areas representing 
every nuance of the bike and its reﬂections. He worked on a section at a time, 
starting with less detailed areas, and bringing each to near completion before 
moving to the next area. Nielsen would often zoom to a comfortable 300% or so to 
work on ﬁne details, but rarely more than that. In this manner, he always managed 
to keep an eye on the way the area he was working on was affecting the image as 
a whole. Color started with the photo itself, but Nielsen didn’t rely upon the photo to 
produce the most accurate and pleasing tones. He used his artist’s eye to adjust 
colors until the right hues and values were represented. Since Nielsen’s work is so 
photorealistic, he purposely leaves sections in an “outline view” appearance so the 
viewer will realize that it is still a drawing they’re looking at and not a photograph. 
When completed, Nielsen’s “Chingon” brought to life a rare, custom 
motorcycle for everyone to enjoy.
NIELSEN
Chris Nielsen
Chris Nielsen created another stunning image using the same drawing technique 
described on the opposite page. Nielsen likes to begin drawing an area of the 
photograph that contains a large object, such as a gas tank, or big pipe. Working 
over a template layer that contained his original photograph, he ﬁrst drew the 
outline of a large object with the Pen tool. Then he drew paths for each area where 
the color value changed within that object. He selected the paths and clicked the 
Divide Pathﬁnder icon. He continued in this manner until there were enough 
shapes to deﬁne the object. This was a particularly challenging motorcycle to draw 
because there are only slight variations in one overall color. Nielsen ﬁlled each 
individual object with a custom color chosen from the Swatches panel. In all of his 
motorcycle illustrations, the reﬂection of Nielsen taking the photograph is visible—
here it is shown in the magniﬁed detail Motorcycle Detail.

MCGARRY
Masking Images
Simple to Complex Clipping Masks
Advanced Technique
Overview: Create a clipping mask; gather and order objects to clip; use the mask to clip ob-
jects; position masked objects; add ﬁnishing touches.
This custom surfboard design made of masks within masks was created by San 
Diego-based illustrator Aaron McGarry, who finds much of his work inspired by a life 
tailored to the beach communities and industries of southern California.
1 Inserting wood texture with a clipping mask. In a new document McGarry double-
clicked the layer name to customize it. He used the Pen tool to draw the outline of a 
surfboard, which he would use as a clipping path for his new surfboard design. To 
add the wood texture for the board, McGarry used File> Place to place a JPG image 
of balsa wood into his document (making certain that the Template option was dis-
abled). With his image selected, he used Object> Arrange> Send to Back to move the 
image to the back of the stacking order, making his surfboard outline the top-most 
object. Adjusting the alignment of the path and the wood, he then selected both ob-
jects and chose Object> Clipping Mask> Make (
-7/Ctrl-7); this clipped the image 
into the path and thereby created the wooden surfboard.
483

placed and the path moved above it (middle);

layers panel before making the clipping mask 
(directly above)
2 Creating a complex (compound) clipping mask. With the surfboard itself prepared, and 
since his logo would be used for other purposes, McGarry created the logo in a sepa-
rate document using the Pen tool, Pathfinder panel, and text. He would be “filling” 
this logo with a blue underwater image by using the logo itself as a clipping mask. 
His initial logo design consisted of two separate paths plus type, all styled initially 
with a black stroke and no fill so he could see his design as he worked. Only one path 
can be used as a clipping path for a mask, so if you have multiple elements (such as 
type and logo objects) you’ll have to first combine the elements into a compound 
path or compound shape. McGarry had outlined his text so he could make some ad-
justments, so in order for all of the letters and the logo to behave as one mask, he 
needed to combine them into one compound path using Object> Compound Path> 
Make (
-8/Ctrl-8). Alternatively, if you’re working with live type, you can combine 
logo design elements and type into a Compound Shape by choosing Make Compound 
Shape from the Pathfinder panel.
2
Selecting all parts of the logo and using Object> Compound Path> 
Make to create a single compound object 
that behaves as one path
484

With this complex compound path prepared, McGarry placed his underwater JPG 
image. Using the Layers panel he positioned his logo path above his placed image. 
McGarry then selected both the logo and the image, then used 
-7/Ctrl-7 to make all 
of his logo objects into a clipping group. Then he renamed the layer “logo masked.”
3 Assembling the objects and ﬁnishing touches. To add finishing details, McGarry creat-
ed two more layers. On one layer (“speargun”) he put additional type; into the “board 
edge” layer he moved a copy of board outline path (by holding Option/Alt while 
dragging the object proxy to the new layer); and then increased the stroke weight. He 
then created the light-to-dark edging around the board by applying a wood gradient 
to the stroke (from Swatch Libraries> Gradients) and in the Gradient panel. He en-
abled the first Stroke option (Apply gradient within stroke), and adjusted the angle in 
the field below to create the desired lighting effect. Finally, with the board edge out-
line still selected he chose the Draw Inside drawing mode to constrain his paint and 
used a charcoal art brush (Window> Brush Libraries> Artistic> Artistic_ChalkChar-
coalPencil) to paint rough white streaks on the board surface (see the Expressive
Strokes chapter for more about how to do this). Finally, McGarry made sure that 
Paste Remembers Layers was enabled (from the Layers panel pop-up menu), and 
with both documents open, McGarry used drag and drop to move his logo into his 
surfboard document, automatically adding the layer names as well. He positioned his 
logo on top of the surfboard and resized it to fit.

MCKIBILLO
487

MCKIBILLO (AKA Josh McKible)
MCKIBILLO’s NaniBird project was devoted to the art of papercraft. In addition to 
MCKIBILLO’s own NaniBirds, the project inspired designs and papercraft 
characters by many other collaborators (read more about it at 
www.papernanibird.blogspot.com).
488

 MCKIBILLO spent a lot of time reﬁning the original NaniBird silhouette, always 
mindful that, like a little sculpture, his papertoy, required consideration of all sides 
of the design. The blank NaniBird PDF template 
(on WOW! ONLINE) was created from a layered Illustrator ﬁle, with separate, 
simple, vector objects. To insert your art into the template, you can ﬁll each object 
with a pattern, you could use Draw Inside mode to paint within a selected object 
(see the Rethinking Construction chapter for details about how to do this), or you can 
use each path as a separate clipping path, to mask any objects (or images) within. 
It’s tricky to visualize, so print proofs and assemble to ensure artwork within is 
correctly oriented. The photo above shows a NaniBird surrounded by a ﬂock of 
NaniPeeps (you can also download Peep templates from WOW! ONLINE).

GAUSE

Monika Gause
Monika Gause, the artist behind the European Illustrator website Vektogarten 
(http://vektorgarten.de), made her papercraft zebra as an homage to NaniBirds and 
similar projects (see the previous Gallery). After working out how to physically 
construct her Paperzebra (paper-colored animal in the photo, Paper Zebra Photo), 
she then deconstructed it and designed the ﬂat template. 
491

Gause draws into the template with the Pencil tool, then she uses Live Paint to 
add color to the blank 
spaces formed between the lines (see the Rethinking Construction chapter for help 
working with Live Paint). Once she ﬁgured out her ﬁrst zebra, she set about making 
a number of variations, some with a tongue sticking out, others with a ﬂat smiling 
row of teeth. Gause also allows anyone to use her templates, saying that her goal is 
“to get a zebra into every home on the planet.”
LEAVENS
Opacity Masking
Smooth Transitions & Intertwining Objects
Advanced Technique
Overview: Create soft transitions using single-object opacity masks; interweave objects using 
complex multi-object opacity masks.
Chris Leavens’ fantastic realms are made plausible by the way objects interact with 
each other, creating depth and disguising vector edges. He often uses opacity masks 
to overlap objects believably, as well as to soften transitions between shadow and full 
light, or between transparent and opaque. Instead of cutting objects apart to create 
the illusion of objects intermingling, with opacity masks you can keep objects intact 
so you can continue to make adjustments. Whenever complex interactions or soft 
transitions are called for, Leavens finds it easier to construct and work with opacity 
masks than with clipping masks.
492

1 Masking with shadows for soft transitions. In order to create the illusion that a critter’s 
head was inside the tendril’s tube, Leavens attached a feathered oval for the area of 
the neck that would gradually disappear into the gradient that creates the hole in the 
tendril. To do this he drew a black oval on top of the neck and feathered it (Effect> 
Stylize> Feather). Because the head consisted of several objects contained within a 
<Clip Group>, to attach an opacity mask to the head, Leavens targeted the <Clip 
Group> in the Layers panel, held down Shift, and also selected the feathered oval. 
Opening the Transparency panel, he disabled “New opacity masks are clipping” from 
the panel menu so all new masks would be solid white (reveal all). Then he clicked 
the Make Mask button, turning the top object (the black feathered oval) into an opac-
ity mask for the critter head clip group.

ing the tendrils into the pot)
2 Masking with multiple objects. Leavens began by drawing the snake and palms indi-
vidually. All the objects were complex, and each was contained within a clip group, 
with a single clipping path defining its contour. To create the illusion that the snake 
was weaving through the trees, Leavens created an opacity mask for the snake by 
modifying a copy of the contour paths for the trees. Using the Make Mask button 
would only turn the top tree into a mask, so he needed to manually create the mask. 
To do this he selected all three clipping paths used to define the outline of the trees 
by holding Shift and clicking each clipping path with the Group Selection tool (or 
Shift-click each <Clipping Path> in the Layers panel) and copied them to the clip-
board. He selected the snake’s <Clip Group> with the Selection tool (or targeted it in 
the Layers panel), opened the Transparency panel, then double-clicked on the empty 
mask thumbnail to enter Opacity Mask Mode for the snake’s clip group (you’ll see a 
thick line around the mask thumbnail, and <Opacity Mask> in the Layers panel). 
Leavens then used Paste in Front (
-F/Ctrl-F) to paste the copied trees in perfect 
registration; then clicked on a Black swatch to solidly fill the semi-transparent out-
lines. The snake now appeared completely behind the trees. Using the Eraser tool, he 
erased sections of the mask where he wanted the snake to appear in front of the tree. 
When the mask was finished, he clicked on the image thumbnail to exit Opacity Mask

HUBIG
Dan Hubig
In this Illustration for California Magazine, Dan Hubig ﬁrst combined blends, 
gradients, and transparency in Illustrator, and then enhanced his image in 
Photoshop with Blurs, Brushes, and Adjustment layers. Hubig used Transparency to 
render the cloak and torso only partially opaque, which kept his options open for 
expressing invisibility in Photoshop. He created his “cloak of invisibility” in Illustrator 
with a white Fill and Stroke and an opacity of only 19%, then duplicated it with a 
Stroke and no Fill to a new layer on top. By planning ahead, he would be able to 
reduce the cloak’s visibility to zero, if he chose, but maintain that important outline. 
For one version, Hubig also made the man’s torso completely invisible, but for the 
ﬁnal version, he retained a hint of opacity. To learn more about how Hubig creates 
his illustrations, see the “Planning Ahead” lesson in the Creatively Combining Apps 
chapter.

BURKE
Pariah Burke
Pariah Burke used Illustrator to construct the cover illustration for his book, 
ePublishing with InDesign. Because he knew that projects often change as they 
progress, he also chose to construct his Illustrator ﬁle to be ﬂexible for future 
editing. He divided the project into three parts: the book cover, the iPad, and the 
joining blank pages. He ﬁrst constructed a highly realistic iPad that he later altered 
to a more generic tablet. He created a front view of the iPad, complete with a 
placed JPG image of an actual eBook page, clipped to ﬁt precisely within the 
tablet’s screen area.
498

To distort the image and position it along with the bevel onto the iPad body, Burke 
selected the bevel and page objects and chose Object> Envelope Distort> Make 
with Mesh. He chose one row and one column, turning the mesh into a transform 
bounding box that he could continue to modify, and even un-trans-form (rare in 
Illustrator!). To edit or replace elements within the envelope, in the Layers panel he 
could move an object above “Envelope” to remove the effect (moving all at once 
deletes the mesh), or drag elements into the Envelope group to apply (or reapply) 
the effect. Using Isolation mode made it even easier for him to focus on just the 
envelope objects. He made the book cover with equal attention to detail and again 
selected all the objects that would be placed onto the book’s cover, distorting them 
using Envelope Mesh with the same method. To make the pages, Burke made 
individual, gradient-ﬁlled polygons, and added thin, white-ﬁlled shapes to represent 
the page edges. With the book-to-iPad constructed, he made a custom drop 
shadow by drawing two paths (one white and one dark gray), choosing Object> 
Blend> Make, and then applying a Multiply blending mode to the blend. Before the 
project was ﬁnished, he had to make several alterations to accommodate his 
publisher, a relatively easy task thanks to envelope mesh.

AUBÉ
Jean Aubé
Jean Aubé created “Falling” as a personal response to lingering discussions with a 
friend about the emotional impact of the 9/11 disaster. He used many different 
techniques throughout, including Image Trace, scatter brush (to distribute the 
stars), gradients, and many instances of reducing opacity and changing blending 
modes. The hard edges of the man and roses falling from above keep these 
narrative elements in full focus, while the soft layers of clouds create a rich depth of 
ﬁeld. To create these clouds Aubé ﬁrst used Image Trace on scans of his pastel-
drawn clouds. He then placed and offset layer upon layer of clouds, adjusting 
opacity and blending modes, and ﬁnally overlaying a gradient (purple to white) set 
to multiply mode.

PEREZ
Richard Perez
To add warmth to his crisp vector objects, San Francisco-based illustrator Richard 
Perez often adds just a few touches of texture. Sometimes his textures are scans, 
while other times he creates textures out of repeating Illustrator objects. Depending 
on where and how he wants to add texture, he applies and constrains it using 
opacity masks or clipping masks. Perez often begins with a muted, restricted color 
palette and builds the basics of his image using mostly the Rectangle, Ellipse, and 
Polygon tools. He uses the Direct Selection tool to select points to delete or move, 
creating some open objects and elongating others, often constraining movement to 
180°, 90°, and 45° axes. Though he sometimes combines objects using Path-
ﬁnder> Unite, often he keeps objects separate (such as the half-ovals that form the 
clouds), so he can make subtle adjustments to positioning.
501

With the main elements in place, he brings in the textural elements, which he 
collects and keeps in separate ﬁles for reuse. In the case of this lovely ode to the 
San Francisco Embarcadero waterfront, Perez brought in a ﬁeld of repeating dots. 
Using a sequence of Option-dragging/Alt-dragging to duplicate, then 
-D/Ctrl-D to 
repeat the duplication, he transformed one dot into a line of dots, offsetting that line 
of dots into a pair, and then duplicating/repeating that pair into a ﬁeld of dots. For 
the circle with dots (Dot Textures), he selected his masking object with the dot set 
beneath it and applied Object> Clipping Mask> Make. The masking object’s ﬁll 
disappeared, but by Direct Selecting (or targeting the <Clipping Path> in the Layers 
panel), he could reapply the ﬁll. Keeping the dots related in color to the ﬁll beneath 
helps to imply a halftone, overlay, or transparency.

Moses Tan
Moses Tan accurately rendered most of the details of this Kyoto Bus Station by 
carefully tracing over his own reference photograph using closed ﬁlled paths drawn 
with the Pen tool.
503

TAN
In a few cases, however, he used Illustrator’s more powerful features such as 
blends, gradients, and clipping masks. To draw the central grill unit (Grill Detail), 
Tan drew one vertical column, copied and Shift-dragged it to the opposite side. With 
both objects selected he double-clicked the Blend tool to show Options, entered 50 
for the Speciﬁed Steps, and set the orientation to Align to Page. Selecting the 
objects he choose Object> Blend> Make.
Tan began the shadows beneath the passengers using linear 
gradients, then within the Appearance panel he selected the ﬁll, 
clicked the fx icon, and chose Blur> Gaussian Blur. For other 
shadows he ﬁlled objects with gradients, then reduced the 
opacity and changed the blending mode (such as Overlay or 
Multiply).

NIELSEN
Chris Nielsen
Chris Nielsen has trained his artistic eye to recognize subtle shifts of color within a 
photograph and translate them into a striking image using layers of ﬁlled paths. 
Nielsen ﬁrst placed an original photograph in a bottom layer to trace upon. He 
worked on one small section at a time, such as the eye in the detail to the right. With 
the Pen tool he made paths (no ﬁll, with a black stroke) and traced the areas of 
primary color he saw in the photograph. He chose the darkest value ﬁrst (dark blue 
or black), then on another layer, he drew the objects with progressively lighter 
values (a lighter blue, red, gray, etc.). He continued building layers of paths until the 
area was completely covered. He moved throughout the image this way until the 
portrait was ﬁnished. When all of the paths were drawn he began to ﬁll them with 
color. Nielsen chose the Eyedropper tool, pressed and held the 
Ctrl key to switch 
to the Direct Selection tool, and selected an object to color. Then he toggled back to 
the Eyedropper tool by releasing the 
/Ctrl key and sampled a color from the 
photograph. He toggled between the Direct Selection tool and the Eyedropper tool 
until the paths were ﬁlled. Most of the time, Nielsen liked the sampled colors, but if 
not, he would tweak the color using the sliders in the Color panel. Once all of the 
paths were ﬁlled with color, Nielsen hid the template layer. He saw small gaps of 
white in his drawing where the paths didn’t quite meet or overlap. To ﬁll these gaps, 
he made a large object that covered the area, ﬁlled it with a dark color, and moved 
it to the bottom-most layer.
506

JACKSON
Lance Jackson
To create the cover illustration for The Adobe Illustrator CS5 WOW! Book, Lance 
Jackson generated atmosphere and depth with the Bristle Brush and constructed 
many of the details using the Blob Brush. He used various tools to block in the main 
components of his composition. He used the Pen tool to draw the basic cables and 
roadway for the Golden Gate Bridge, then modiﬁed the strokes with the Width tool. 
Next Jackson began brushing over the water and bridge with various brushes from 
the Bristle Brush library, especially Deerfoot, Cat’s Tongue, Dome, and Fan. To 
constrain the brushes to each main element, he often selected a base object and 
chose the Draw Inside mode. For added texture, he also used brushes from the 
Artistic and Grunge Brush Vector Pack libraries. Jackson drew a few cars and 
pedestrians using the Blob Brush, then duplicated and recolored several of them. 
Jackson toned down his palette, adding fog and more depth, by reducing the 
opacity of his brushstrokes, layering the strokes, and sometimes even changing the 
blending mode (by clicking Opacity in the Control panel).

STEUER
Sharon Steuer
Sharon Steuer chose her photo of three rainbow chard leaves on a white 
background as source material for raster Illustrator brushes. In 
Photoshop Steuer used a combination of tools to isolate each chard leaf 
from the others and from the white background (Photoshop Layers 
Panel). She saved each leaf in its own ﬁle in PNG format. In a new 
Illustrator ﬁle she chose File> Place, disabled the Link option (so the 
placed ﬁles would be embedded), then she selected all three chard 
leaf PNG ﬁles in the dialog (holding Shift), and clicked OK. Moving her 
loaded cursor into her artboard she clicked to place each of her 
images, one after the other. Dragging the ﬁrst leaf into the Brushes 
panel, she chose Art Brush and clicked OK, but received a warning 
dialog that the artwork’s resolution was too high. She cancelled, resized 
the three chard leaves, and then duplicated them. Selecting one of the 
duplicates, she chose Object> Rasterize, then enabled the Medium 
(150 ppi) and Transparency settings and clicked OK. Dragging this 
downsized image into the Brushes panel, she chose Art Brush and 
clicked OK. This time Art Brush Options opened, where she enabled 
Stretch to Fit Stroke Length and the up-pointing direction arrow before 
clicking OK. She then applied Rasterize to the other two duplicates and 
made brushes for each of them as well. With the three chard brushes 
prepared, Steuer switched to the Artboard tool and created a new 
artboard. She then drew a pair of colorful rectangles as a background. 
Locking this layer, she created another layer above for artwork. With the 
Paintbrush tool, she painted with this set of brushes, creating a simple 
chard forest. (See her other “chard forest” gallery in the Creatively 
Combining Apps chapter, and go to sharonsteuer.com/lynda for links to 
a 7-day free trial to view movies of this process.)

GLITSCHKA/Glitschka Studios for “Drawing Vector Graphics: Patterns” for lynda.‐
com
Von R. Glitschka
Von R. Glitschka (Glitschka Studios) created this “Scroll Work” pattern in Illustrator 
for his “Drawing Vector Graphics: Patterns” course on lynda.com. Glitschka began 
by tracing a scan of his hand-drawn sketch with the Pen tool. With the objects 
complete, he decided that the point of each curve should be slightly (and uniformly) 
rounded, instead of ending in sharp points. Although he could have used Live 
Corners to convert all corners to curves in selected objects, that would have 
rounded the creases between curves as well as the corner ends. Instead, he 
carefully applied a Live Corner radius value to just the end points of the outward 
curls, preserving the sharp creases between the curves. To do this he used the 
Direct Selection tool to marquee-select each of the points that he wanted to change 
(holding Shift to select many at once), and then clicked Corners in the Control 
panel. Entering .7 (pt) in the Radius ﬁeld he pressed Return to gently round the end 
of each curlicue (above left shows the original sharp curves in magenta stroke, with 
the rounded ends in ﬁlled turquoise).
510

Selecting all the elements, he chose Object> Pattern> Make to enter the Pattern 
Editor (top right). Here he adjusted the placement of the pattern tile to form his 
desired repeat then clicked OK (ﬁnal pattern directly above). See his gallery 
opposite on how he combined this pattern to create the complex pattern on the 
cover of this book.

GLITSCHKA/Glitschka Studios for “Drawing Vector Graphics: Patterns” for lynda.‐

Von R. Glitschka
Using his Scroll Work pattern (shown in the previous gallery) as a starting point, Von 
R. Glitschka of Glitschka Studios created the variation used for the cover of this 
book by layering this pattern onto itself. After adding to his set of custom ﬁll colors, 
he duplicated the ﬁrst pattern by dragging its swatch to the New Swatch icon in the 
Swatches panel, he then double-clicked the duplicate to open it in Pattern Editing 
mode. To create a white variation, he selected all ( -A/Ctrl-A) and changed the ﬁll 
to white (rendering the pattern temporarily invisible on the artboard). Exiting the 
editor, he drew a rectangle on his artboard and chose his original turquoise pattern 
as the ﬁll. Opening the Appearance panel, he clicked the Add New Fill icon and 
chose one of his dark blue custom colors for the bottom Fill. 
512

With the blue showing behind the turquoise swirls, in the Appearance panel he 
duplicated his pattern ﬁll (dragging it to the Duplicate Selected Item icon), then 
changed the duplicate ﬁll to his new white pattern, and from Opacity reduced the 
slider to 15%. To offset the layered white pattern, he highlighted it in the 
Appearance panel, then back on his art-board he Option-clicked/Alt-clicked on his 
ﬁlled rectangle with the Rotate tool. Disabling Transform Objects, with Transform 
Patterns enabled he experimented with rotation angle values, updating the Preview 
by checking/unchecking it (to transform a pattern manually in the en_US edition of 
CS6 and CC, hold the ~ key). For more on Glitschka pattern process, see his 
“Drawing Vector Graphics: Patterns” course on lynda.com.
POJE
Lisa Poje
Illustrator and animator Lisa Poje worked on “Robot Bath Time” through two 
versions of Illustrator. She began in CS6, but Live Corners in Illustrator CC ﬁnally 
gave her a tool that allowed her to create corners both intuitively and non-
destructively. She ﬁrst used the Pen tool to draw the pipes seen in both the 
background and the ﬂoor. She employed a simple Shift-click routine to lay down 
pipe at right angles, then applied a fat 10–15 point stroke. Once all the pipe paths 
were laid down, she converted the stroked paths to ﬁlled objects with Object> 
Path> Outline Stroke. Keeping the paths selected, she switched to the Direct 
Selection tool, grabbed one Live Corner widget, and rounded all the corners at 
once by dragging on the widget; even the sharp pipe ends were perfectly rounded. 
Because all the corners are live and editable, she selected inner corners separately 
from the newly rounded outer corners and dragged those widgets back to once 
again form a sharp corner.
513

Poje prefers working visually with the widgets to typing numbers in dialogs, but 
appreciated that precision was always available to her when editing the pipes. For 
her, the signiﬁcant advantage to using Live Corners for this piece was not having to 
slowly and individually add anchors with the Pen tool to create Bézier curves at the 
pipe junctions, and then to individually remove original corner anchors.
514

FERSTER
Gary Ferster
In the planning stages for a promotional email template for his reelwelldone.com 
website, Gary Ferster intended to create rectangles, apply uniform rounded corners 
to them using fx> Stylize> Round Corners from the Appearance panel. However, 
Ferster has since discovered that creating and modifying rounded corners using 
Live Rectangles provides him with superior control and ﬂexibility. He began his 
design in a new document, choosing the Web proﬁle (which sets pixels as the 
default units), and a width of 600 pixels. After setting an orange ﬁll and increasing 
his black stroke to 3 (pixels) in the Control panel, he used the Rectangle tool to 
draw a rectangle on the artboard, which opened the Transform panel. While the 
rectangle was still selected, he entered 10 in one corner radius value box, and (with 
the default link enabled) all radii updated to 10 pixels.
To place a photo “inside” the still-selected rectangle without losing its styling, Ferster switched to 
Draw Inside mode (Shift-D), pressed    -Shift-P/Ctrl-Shift-P (File> Place), located the desired photo, 
and clicked OK. With the loaded cursor he click-dragged over the bottom portion of his rectangle, 
placing the image “inside” the rectangle, which then became a ﬁlled and stroked clipping mask. 
Still in Draw Inside mode, he typed “Drama” as point type on the artboard, moved it over the top 
portion of the rectangle, and changed its ﬁll color to white.
515

Returning to regular drawing mode (Shift-D), he duplicated this rectangle by 
selecting it, holding Option-Shift/Alt-Shift and dragging horizontally to create a 
second, then pressed 
-D/Ctrl-D twice to create two more. After typing the correct 
text label, he replaced each image by clicking on it with the Direct Selection tool, 
pressing 
-Shift-P/Ctrl-Shift-P, choosing the new image, enabling Replace, and 
clicking OK. Finally, he used File> Save for Web, with “JPEG High” and “Type 
Optimized” settings.
516

FERSTER
Gary Ferster
For the most part, Gary Ferster’s Illustrator work has tended to be clean and linear. 
He prefers 3D applications such as Lightwave 3D for rendering complex 
illustrations, saying “It would take me forever to create a vector environment that 
equalled or matched the 3D artwork.” Once rendered in 3D, replicating complex 
objects is relatively simple, but in Illustrator replicating complex objects, such as 
gradient mesh or blended objects, has been much more labor and time intensive. 
Gradient mesh objects are too complex to make into an Illustrator brush, and 
although they can be made into symbols, as vectors or rasterized, the Symbolism 
tools aren’t precise enough for medical illustration purposes. Now that Illustrator 
brushes can contain rasters, Ferster was able to paint with brushes created from 
rasterized versions of his complex elements. Beginning with a larger gradient mesh 
oval and a smaller object blend (ﬁgure a, above left), he then stacked the blend on 
top of the mesh and grouped them together (ﬁgure b). After creating a duplicate of 
the group to preserve a vector version of his blood cell, he selected the duplicate 
and chose Object> Rasterize, set the Resolution to High (300 ppi), and clicked OK 
(ﬁgure c).
517

Next, dragging that rasterized cell into the Brushes panel, he chose Scatter brush, 
clicked OK, and accepted the default settings. Choosing the Paintbrush tool he 
drew a path with this new brush and then double-clicked the brush in the panel. He 
turned Preview on, set all the parameters to Random, and then adjusted each slider, 
watching his changes live. When he was satisﬁed with the settings Ferster clicked 
OK, and painted with his scatter brush. To create a sense of depth he selected 
each path individually and adjusted the Opacity in the Control panel, assigning 
paths at the back with low opacity (20%), and increasing opacity as the paths 
stacked towards the top, with the topmost path at 100% opacity. Because each 
brushed path was easily edited and adjusted with vector path tools (Direct 
Selection, Smooth tool, etc.), without any further adjustment to brush Options, 
Ferster was able to control the exact position of each cell. The gradient background 
is (in medical terms) a “lumen” (artery), with the lighter middle area implying a tube-
like form, simulating the blood ﬂow through a cross section of an artery. The ﬁnal 
brushed paths appear simple when viewed in Outline mode (above left).

INTRODUCTION
This chapter showcases some of the ways you can use Illustrator together with other 
programs. Moving artwork between Illustrator and other applications—such as 
Photoshop, Flash, After Effects, or Ideas—is often straightforward. But there are 
always rules and limits to moving files between programs, and the following pages 
address some ways to make your life easier when working with Illustrator and other 
programs.
LINKING VS. EMBEDDING IN ILLUSTRATOR
The major choice you’ll need to make when placing art in Illustrator is whether to 
link or embed the file. When you link a file, you don’t actually include the artwork in 
the Illustrator file. Instead a copy of the artwork acts as a placeholder, while the 
image remains in a separate file. Linking leaves the file editable in the original 
program, making it easy to update when the original is changed. Not only are .ai files 
with linked images smaller than those with embedded images, but linking permits 
you to link the same file several times in your document without increasing the file 
size for each instance. The Links panel keeps track of all the raster images used in 
your document, regardless of whether they were created within Illustrator, opened, 
or introduced via the Place command. Just remember that you have to include the 
separate, linked files if you move the .ai file to another computer.
When you embed artwork, you’re actually including it in the file, which can 
sometimes be helpful even though the file size increases. Although it’s trickier to 
update an embedded file in the original program, embedding is the answer if you 
need to be positive an image is included in the document. Consider embedding the 
image if you need to edit it in Illustrator or it’s the only way to retain its 
transparency. Also, if there’s a danger the linked file won’t travel with the document 
when sending it to a client or press, you’ll want to embed the file.
Recovering missing linked files
If you don’t have the original linked files for an .ai file, you can get the images from 
the PDF side of the file—as long as the file was saved with Create PDF Compatible 
File enabled. If it was, drag and drop the .ai file onto your Photoshop application 
icon, and choose Images in Photoshop’s Import PDF dialog. From this dialog you can 
open any images from the PDF portion of the Illustrator file, save the images, and 
relink them in Illustrator.
So you think it’s linked?
Flattening transparency (Object menu) of a linked image automatically embeds the 
image. Not only does this increase file size, but you can no longer update the link.
519

Placing a ﬁle using the Link option
ILLUSTRATOR TO NON-ADOBE PROGRAMS
When moving artwork from Illustrator to non-Adobe programs, you must decide 
which objects in your artwork you want to remain as vectors, if possible, and which 
you can allow to become rasterized. What you’ll be able to do with your Illustrator 
artwork in that other program depends both on how you prepare your Illustrator files 
as well as the strengths and limitations of the program into which you’ll be moving 
your artwork. Parameters that you might be able to control include moving only 
selected objects or the entire file; bringing Illustrator files in as paths, styled vectors, 
or rasters; and bringing in images flat or with layers.
PDF is often better than EPS
If the application you’re working in can place or open native .ai, native PSD, or PDF 
1.4 or later formats, it’s better to use those than the old standard EPS, which cannot 
preserve layers, transparency, and other features.
Copy and paste/drag and drop
You may be able to preserve the vector format in programs outside the Creative Suite 
if they support PostScript drag and drop behavior. In order for this to work, enable 
AICB (Adobe Illustrator Clipboard) in Preferences> File Handling & Clipboard 
(disabled by default). When you copy/paste or drag and drop into a raster-based 
program without vector support, your artwork will be either automatically rasterized 
at the resolution set in that program or from Illustrator’s Document Raster Effects 
Settings.
ILLUSTRATOR & ADOBE PHOTOSHOP
There are many options for moving artwork between Illustrator and Photoshop. In 
many cases you can control whether you want to maintain vector data, rasterize in 
part or whole, or whether to maintain layers, although those processes don’t always 
work as you’d expect.
Illustrator to Photoshop: Smart Objects
Illustrator art brought in as a Smart Object can be scaled, rotated, duplicated, 
modified using Adjustment layers or Smart Filters, or even warped without loss of 
data. Smart Objects keep the original dimensions of your artwork, so further edits in 
Illustrator need to fit the original bounding box or the objects will be distorted in 
Photoshop.
520

To save multiple artboards, each artboard to its own ﬁle, in Save 
As under Options enable Save each artboard 
to a separate ﬁle
• To create Photoshop Smart Objects from Illustrator data, copy/paste to open the Paste
dialog and choose Smart Object. Or create a Smart Object automatically by dragging 
and dropping or choosing File> Place.
• To edit an Illustrator Smart Object, double-click on its thumbnail in Photoshop’s
Layers panel to automatically launch Illustrator and open a working copy of your 
artwork. To update your Photoshop file, save your edits in Illustrator before 
returning to Photoshop.
• To replace a Smart Object ﬁle with a different ﬁle on disk, choose Layer> Smart
Objects> Replace Content. This means you can use Smart Objects as placeholders for 
content you place in Photoshop later.
Why is it a “smart” object?
When you place an Illustrator file as a Smart Object in Photoshop, the original is 
embedded in the file and only an “instance” is transformed or duplicated, much like 
using a symbol in Illustrator. When you want to edit the Smart Object, and not the 
instance of it, the Smart Object “knows” to launch the originating program—in this 
case, Illustrator.
Illustrator to Photoshop: pixels, paths, and layers
• To create a pixel image, path, or Shape layer, copy and paste an object, selecting from
among these options in the Paste dialog that opens.
• To preserve layers and keep text editable, place the text on a top-level layer, not a
sublayer, and choose Export to save the file in “Photoshop (psd)” format. The other 
vector objects are rasterized, but text stays editable. You can even use Illustrator’s 
anti-aliasing options—None, Sharp, Crisp, Strong—which are comparable to and 
supported by Photoshop’s text options.
521

• To reliably export compound shapes to Photoshop, place your compound shape on a
top-level layer. To keep both the shape and any strokes you’ve added on separate 
layers so each is editable, remove strokes before exporting, or Photoshop might treat 
your shape and its stroke as a single object. Apply your strokes in Photoshop.
Photoshop to Illustrator
• To keep text live, in Photoshop save the file in PSD format. In Illustrator, choose
File> Open (or File> Place with the Link checkbox disabled), and in the Photoshop 
Import Options dialog, enable Convert to Layers.
• To link a ﬁle, rather than embed it, choose File> Place and enable the Link (File> Open
has no link options).
• When linking a ﬁle, you will be able to relink, or edit the original, and have the link
update reflect your modifications, but you can’t import layers from PSD or TIFF files.
• When embedding a ﬁle, you can import text layers and keep them live, with image
layers flattened in a separate layer, but embedding won’t allow you to edit the 
original PSD or TIFF file and have it update.
• When importing Photoshop layers, Illustrator doesn’t understand Adjustment layers
and will flatten all the non-text layers in a file if it encounters an Adjustment layer. If 
necessary, merge an Adjustment layer with the layer it’s modifying before saving the 
PSD or TIFF file. When using Place or Open, enable the Convert to Layers option.
• To preserve the appearance of Density or Feather options applied to a layer mask,
apply the mask to the layer in Photoshop before you embed the file (Illustrator 
ignores Feather and Mask Density options found in CS6 Properties, or in the Masks 
panel in pre-CS6 versions).
Placing Photoshop web slices
When you place a Photoshop or TIFF file that contains web slices, disable the Link 
checkbox (embedding the file) to make the Import Slices checkbox available in 
Illustrator’s Import Options dialog.
Importing PS Layer Comps
If you know you’ll be placing your Photoshop file in Illustrator, use Layer Comps in 
Photoshop to give you better control over which layers are visible once you place 
your PSD file in Illustrator.
Choosing a Layer Comp in Illustrator’s Photoshop Import Options
522

ILLUSTRATOR & ADOBE INDESIGN
• To edit Illustrator objects in InDesign when using copy/paste, in InDesign’s Preferences,
disable Prefer PDF When Pasting. Then pasted objects can be ungrouped and edited. 
Paste objects containing complex appearances (such as brushes, effects, or 
gradients), either with preserved paths (objects lose any complex appearances), or 
with preserved appearances (complex appearances will be flattened and expanded). 
Control whether pasting preserves paths or appearances in the Copy As section of 
Preferences> File Handling & Clipboard.
Pasting text into InDesign
You can paste type from Illustrator to InDesign either as editable text, or, to preserve 
appearance, as a graphic object. If you want to paste editable text, in Illustrator 
enable AICB and Preserve Path in File Handling Preferences; in InDesign choose 
Preferences> Clipboard Handling and select Text Only. If instead you’d rather 
preserve the appearance of Illustrator text (if it includes, for instance, transparency or 
a pattern fill), choose All Information. This treats pasted text as an object so that you 
can apply effects and transform it, but you won’t be able to edit the text.
• To place Illustrator artwork (linking it rather than embedding), save your file with the
Create PDF Compatible File option enabled (it’s on by default). InDesign, as well as 
other programs, can interpret and preview only the PDF portion of the file.
• To control how an Illustrator ﬁle imports, enable Show Import Options in the Place
dialog. If you’re placing an Illustrator file containing multiple artboards, InDesign 
allows you to select which artboard to import; the Layers tab in the Import dialog lets 
you control visibility of top-level Illustrator layers.
Illustrator layers in InDesign
To control the layer visibility of an Illustrator file in InDesign, when you choose Place, 
enable “Show Import Options,” or select a file you’ve already placed in InDesign and 
choose Object> Object Layer Options. In the Object Layer Options dialog, click an 
Eye icon to hide or show any layer. At the bottom of the dialog you can choose 
whether to update layer visibility settings for a linked Illustrator file when the link is 
updated.
Illustrator & 3D Programs
In addition to Illustrator’s 3D effects (see the Reshaping Dimensions chapter), you can 
also import Illustrator paths into 3D programs to use as outlines and extrusion paths. 
Once you import a path, you can transform it into a 3D object. Photoshop’s 3D 
features can work with any closed path whether pasted as pixels, path, or Shape 
layer. Autodesk Maya, Strata 3D CX, Trimble SketchUp!, and NewTec LightWave 
are just a few of the many full-featured 3D programs that you can use in combination 
with Illustrator.
523

ILLUSTRATOR, PDF, AND ADOBE ACROBAT
Acrobat’s Portable Document Format (PDF) lets you transfer files between different 
operating systems and applications. By default, all Illustrator files created now are 
also PDF-compatible files. And when you open an Illustrator document newer than 
the version of the program that you have, you’re actually opening the PDF portion of 
the .ai file. When you choose File> Save As, keep the “Create PDF Compatible File” 
option enabled so Acrobat (and earlier versions of Illustrator) can open an .ai file.
• To access the complete set of PDF options, choose “Adobe PDF (pdf)” from the Save As
format pop-up and click Save, which opens the Adobe PDF Options dialog; then 
choose from among the full range of PDF options, such as Optimize for Fast Web 
View.
• To save layered Illustrator ﬁles as layered Acrobat ﬁles, enable the “Create Acrobat
Layers From Top-Level Layers” option in the Adobe PDF Options dialog.
Opening other apps’ PDFs
Illustrator can open many PDF files made by other applications, but can only open 
one page at a time. Also, depending on how the PDF was made, text in the PDF 
may be broken up into multiple text lines when opened in Illustrator.
WEB GRAPHICS
This section looks at some of the complexities of creating web graphics for modern 
displays. Adobe has worked to eliminate obstacles between Illustrator and web 
programs such as Flash, but some of its features can produce large files that result in 
long load times, or objects that don’t scale to large and small displays.
Document profiles and templates, such as Flash Builder were designed to optimize 
your design for the web from the start. If you choose the Web, Devices, or Flash 
Builder document profiles when creating a new document, most of the settings—
including setting resolution, RGB color mode, pixels for ruler units, and enabling 
Align to Pixel Grid—are geared for screen display.
Using the Pixel Preview grid
If Show Pixel Grid is enabled (it’s the default in Preferences> Guides and Grid), the 
Pixel Preview grid will automatically show up when you zoom to 600% or greater.
• Use multiple artboards; these are a great aid for sharing resources when you need to
maintain a look or prep a number of files for quick export. Use Export to choose a 
format and output selected artboards. Save for Web keeps the assets, but only 
exports the active artboard.
• To prevent colors from being altered when working for print and display, work in CMYK
(the more limited color space), and then convert a copy of your file to RGB.
• To assist in creating bold graphics, turn on Pixel Preview to see how the anti-aliasing is
affecting each object.
• To keep sharp-edged objects crisp and prevent unnecessary anti-aliasing wherever
Illustrator paths line up with the pixel grid, enable Align to Pixel Grid in the 
Transform panel (it will be enabled by default if you chose a Web or Flash Builder 
document profile).
Anti-alias & Save for Web
If you use Save for Web, choose Type Optimized in the Image Size options to 
preserve character-level anti-aliasing choices.
524

Pixel Preview
While Illustrator’s default preview is optimized for print, choosing View> Pixel 
Preview will allow you to see your art as it would appear when displayed on the web 
or on a digital screen. Pixel Preview will show the effects of anti-aliasing, which often 
will affect the visual appearance of your art.
—Mordy Golding
From Illustrator to Flash Pro
Because Flash and Illustrator objects are both vector-based, you can create just about 
any artwork intended for a Flash project inside Illustrator. If you own both 
programs, you can copy and paste or drag and drop between Illustrator and Flash. To 
get the best results in Flash, save your artwork in Illustrator (.ai) format and choose 
to import to the Flash Stage or Library. Note that if you save an .ai file and import it 
to Flash, you’ll need to have top-level layers (not the sublayers automatically created 
by Illustrator’s Release to Layers). Manually select all of the sublayers in Illustrator 
and drag them up to become top-level layers. Here are some strategies for 
maximizing the quality and usefulness of your Illustrator files in Flash:
• Use Illustrator symbols for objects that you intend to place multiple times, instead of using
multiple copies of the original art. Symbols can reduce the size of files that you 
export from Illustrator for Flash.
• To modify symbols while keeping the ﬁle size small, select them and apply Effects from
the fx menu of the Appearance panel. Flash imports only one instance of a symbol no 
matter how many different instances have effects applied (although the effects may 
not stay live). Don’t use the Symbol Stainer, Screener, or Styler on your symbols; 
using these tools will result in a larger SWF file with many unique symbols.
• Flash preserves gradients with fewer than eight stops, and retains transparency (called
Alpha). Flash rasterizes mesh objects, and gradients with more than eight stops.
• To create a Flash frame from each Illustrator layer, export as a SWF file and choose
Export Layers to SWF frames.
• To control the way a symbol transforms, set a registration point in Illustrator; it will be
effective in both Illustrator and Flash. Use the registration point to precisely position 
and transform symbols relative to the artboard coordinates before exporting them to 
Flash. The registration point “anchors” the symbol to that point for transformations. 
When editing symbols in isolation mode, the registration point’s x,y location is 
always 0,0, and can’t be changed using the ruler.
Illustrator to Fireworks CS6
Although you can copy and paste artwork directly into Fireworks CS6, to preserve 
multiple art-boards, use File> Import in order to select a range of artboards to 
convert to pages in Fireworks, or use File Open to automatically convert all 
artboards to pages.
The Edge alternative
As an alternative to using Flash for web animation and interactivity, Adobe Edge is 
525

an application based on HTML code. Since iOS devices don’t permit Flash, Adobe 
Edge provides the means to create files you can display on most devices and 
browsers, including the iPhone and iPad. If you’re familiar with Flash, you’ll find it 
easy to learn to use Adobe Edge.
Animate with Graphic Symbols
If you use Illustrator layers to create an animation that doesn’t need to be tweened in 
Flash, try importing the layers as keyframes in a Graphic Symbol. The animation is 
complete as soon as you insert a frame on the Timeline for every keyframe 
(Illustrator layer).
9-slice scaling in Illustrator
Enable 9-slice scaling on symbols to allow you to protect outside areas of a symbol, 
such as its corners, from becoming distorted when transformed in Illustrator.
Symbols and guides
When aligning a symbol to an object or guide, be aware that its content, not just its 
bounding box, can snap to align with objects and guides. Choose this option from the 
Transform panel menu, and turn on Smart Guides to assist you.
CREATING ANIMATION WITH LAYERS
You can use Illustrator layers to design a sequence for an animation, or export it to 
another program for further manipulation. You can also place the parts of objects 
you want to animate on top-level layers, instead of a sequence. For best results, 
export in .ai format when possible.
• To create layers so each object (or layer) can be manipulated/animated separately in
another program, such as After Effects, choose Release to Layers (Sequence).
• To create the animation in Illustrator before exporting it (similar to onion-skinning),
choose the Build option; the bottom layer’s object gets placed on every layer, with the 
next object placed on every layer except the first layer, and so on, until all the objects 
are placed on the top layer and the animation sequence is complete.
• To create a composition to import into After Effects, use the Video & Film Document
Profile. This creates two artboards—one large artboard that serves as a “scratch” area 
on which you can place objects for later use in After Effects, and one sized for your 
chosen video format. To retain each artboard and the layers, create a multi-layered 
file and save with Create PDF Compatible File enabled.
RELATED TIPS
No Preview or Place option?
Disabling the PDF-compatible file option when you save in .ai will create a smaller 
file, but it will also create a file that you can only use from within that particular 
version of Illustrator or later. Most applications—including Adobe applications such 
as InDesign, Photoshop, Acrobat, and Adobe Reader—can’t open or place the file 
with a preview. If you need to open, view, or place it outside of Illustrator, save a file 
with Create PDF Compatible File enabled; it’s on by default.
Getting it into Illustrator
From most programs, and on most platforms, you can Save As, or Print and Save As 
a PDF document. Illustrator will open any PDF document (if there are multiple pages, 
it will ask you which one you want). Your objects and text might be broken up, but 
everything should be in there.
Ideas—an Adobe Touch app
Ideas is an Illustrator-compatible vector app for iOS and Android devices that offers 
up to 10 layers plus one image layer, multiple undos, and drawing tools that create 
art similar to the Blob Brush. Use the Creative Cloud or send a copy by email for 
further development in Illustrator. See an example of Brian Yapp’s Adobe Ideas art 
later in this chapter.

 CC FEATURES FOR CREATIVELY COMBINING APPS
PLACE MULTIPLE FILES
Before IIllustrator CC, placing multiple files into a document was a time-consuming 
process of choosing one file at a time. Illustrator CC has now added the option to 
place multiple files using a feature that operates similarly to InDesign’s “place gun.” 
Choose File> Place (
-Shift-P/Ctrl-Shift-P), and in the Place dialog, Shift-click 
contiguous files, or 
-click/Ctrl-click discontiguous files to select several files at the 
same time. Choose whether to link the files or embed them, and whether or not to 
show Import Options when placing them. The options that you’ll be presented with if 
you enable the Show Import Options checkbox will vary depending upon factors such 
as the selected file’s format, whether it’s one or multiple files, and whether you’ve 
enabled the Link option or are embedding the file. See the Tip Using Place with Area 
Type “Using Place with Area Type” before attempting to place text. Templates and 
Replace are unavailable when more than one file has been selected.
Once you’ve clicked OK, Illustrator’s cursor will display the thumbnail of the file 
you’re about to place, along with its number in the sequence of files you’ve selected—
for instance, 2/7 means you’ve selected the second of seven files. To place a file that 
isn’t displayed, use the left and right arrows on your keyboard to cycle through to the 
one you do want. If you decide now you don’t want a file, press the Esc key to drop 
that file from the queue.
Place the image in your document by dragging out a marquee, which is constrained 
proportionally to the image, or by clicking once in the document to place the file at 
full size. If you didn’t choose to show Import Options in the Place dialog, and 
depending upon both whether the file type supports options and whether or not you 
have Link enabled, you can still sometimes choose Import Options on the fly; press 
Shift and click once to bring up that file’s Import Options, select an option, click OK, 
and you’re back to the Place cursor ready to place the file. If you choose Show Import 
Options in the Place dialog, Illustrator will first page through the files, bringing up 
any import options for each one, before you place any of the files.
Illustrator is not InDesign
Although Illustrator and InDesign have many similar features, such as the new 
multi-file Place feature, Illustrator’s Place is not identical to InDesign’s. InDesign lets 
you undo when placing files, reloading the “place gun” with each undo, even after 
you’ve placed the last file. Illustrator lets you undo and reload the cursor only until 
you have placed the last file. Once the place gun is empty, choosing Undo doesn’t 
reload. InDesign also allows you to select multiple files in Bridge and drag them onto 
your document, loading the “place gun” cursor with all those files at the same time. 
As of this writing, Illustrator only lets you drag and drop one file from Bridge, 
although using Place from the context menu does allow for multiple files. And finally, 
you won’t be able to create a grid while placing files as you can with InDesign.
Using Place with Area type
When placing Area type, Illustrator doesn’t recognize a pre-drawn container. After 
selecting the text file, drag with your cursor to draw a frame the size you want, and 
the text will pour into that frame. To place text in a vector object, use the Type tool to 
copy it to the clipboard, convert the object to an area type container, then paste the 
text into it.
527

The CSS Properties panel displays all type and graphic styles for 
which it can generate code (top half), and the 
code for selected objects (bottom half)
THE NEW CSS PROPERTIES PANEL (FOR WEB DESIGN)
Using Illustrator for site design got a boost with the new CSS Properties panel. 
Design the elements for a web page, create a mockup on the artboard, and then 
generate the basic HTML for your favorite HTML editor. The new panel lets you 
generate the CSS you need for styling and positioning the elements. Character Styles 
and Graphic Styles automatically display in the CSS panel, and the panel will display 
the CSS code if you select either an object on the artboard or a style in the panel. The 
CSS Options dialog allows you to make choices about the code that Illustrator 
generates, including whether or not to include absolute positioning, vendor Pre-fixes, 
or code for unnamed elements. If you place elements on their own layers, naming 
them as they are named in the HTML editor, you’ll get the most useful CSS for your 
layout. You can copy and paste code from the panel and then paste it into your 
HTML editor, or you can export all of the CSS code in one file to work with in your 
external editor. In addition, except for live type, you can copy any object to the 
clipboard and use Paste in your HTML editor; it will paste the SVG code that 
Illustrator generates for you—another timesaver.
IMPROVED SVG FEATURES
In Illustrator CC, saving web assets in SVG format gives you the option to make them 
Responsive—that is, they’ll be scalable on websites that adapt to different devices, 
such as cellphones and tablets. By default, type is now saved in standard SVG 
format, which is visually faithful but lacks hinting at small sizes, while precision for 
vectors is set to the lowest quality to produce the smallest possible file. In 
Preferences> Clipboard and File Handling, you can now enable the option to include 
the SVG code whenever you copy an object to the clipboard. Also, opening an 
Illustrator SVG file aligns it to the pixel grid by default. 
528

The File Info dialog has a new appearance and now only allows 
loading one template at a time

You can enable Responsive to have the CSS for SVG ﬁles work in 
responsive websites
ROBERTS
Andrew Roberts 
Illustrator & Animation
Andrew Roberts, Illustrator and designer, was commissioned to creates ﬂipbooks 
for institutions such as The Royal Shakespeare Company and The Metropolitan 
Opera, so when it came to creating a banner for his website, he decided to bring a 
similar sensibility to an animation to run along the top. In Illustrator, Roberts created 
an extremely detailed background (almost 30MB) based on his hometown cycling 
route called the Backs; this is the spot in Cambridge (UK) where you’ll ﬁnd both 
Clare College and Kings College (famous for its 500-year old chapel). On a 
separate layer above he created the foreground elements, and then in yet another 
layer, Roberts created groups of elements that form his academic cycler. Each of 
the cycler’s groups represents a detail for the animator to articulate (the hat, the 
arm, legs, petals).
530

Then, with detailed instructions as to what he wished the cycler to do (bicycler 
enters from off-frame on the right, rides across and to left and tosses his hat along 
the way), he passed off the ﬁles to Feel Design folks, who imported the elements 
into Flash where they created movie clip symbols and animated it on a timeline; the 
ﬁnal animation contains more than 200 frames. The cyclist was the most complex 
part, with each part of the leg and bike as a separate symbol. Once complete and 
approved by Roberts, Feel Design exported the ﬁnal animation as a .swf that they 
then embeded into the HTML header of andyrobertsdesign.com/illustration (it 
requires Flash to play).

ROORDA
Twist and Slice
Making Web Page Elements in Illustrator
Illustrator & Web
Overview: Set up a document for web page design; use layers to structure artwork; create 
slices with the Slice tool or by using guides or artwork; save slices as image ﬁles.
If you’re comfortable designing and drawing in Illustrator, why not start your 
webpage in Illustrator? Jolynne Roorda used Illustrator to design and preview web 
pages, create comps for client approval, and slice and optimize artwork for use in this 
website for Yoga on High.
1 Setting up your document. To start designing your webpage, create a new document 
using File> New. From the New Document dialog’s Profile menu, choose Web, and 
then choose one of the default sizes from the Size menu or enter your own custom 
size. Be sure to keep Align New Objects to Pixel Grid enabled to assure that the hori-
zontal and vertical edges of objects you draw remain sharp when you slice and save 
as images later.
Because your artwork will be saved in a raster format like GIF, PNG, or JPG, 
consider turning on pixel preview (View> Pixel Preview). With pixel preview you can 
see the pixel grid (zoom in 600% or more) and the anti-aliasing of your artwork as if 
it were rasterized, so you can adjust it if necessary.

The New Document dialog
2 Structuring pages with layers and adding artwork. Let the Layers panel help you orga-
nize the artwork comprising your webpage. Roorda began by drawing the artwork, 
placing images, and creating text on a single layer. Then she added layers in the Lay-
ers panel, selected the artwork she planned to slice, and moved it to these new layers 
(for layers help, see the chapter Your Creative Workspace). This separated the artwork 
so overlapping text and graphics would not appear for elements like backgrounds 
when she saved slices as images later. Finally, she added a layer at the top of the Lay-
ers panel for the slices she would draw next.

own layers 
533

Roorda selected the slices layer in the Layers panel and began creating slices. To 
draw slices, select the Slice tool and click and drag to draw rectangles that match 
areas of your webpage design such as the banner, navigation bar, and content areas. 
To manually change a slice, click the Slice Selection tool, then click an edge or corner 
point of the slice and move it. Because slices are objects like other artwork you draw, 
you can change their dimensions in the Control or Transform panel to make them fit 
precise sizes you plan for the HTML or CSS elements you’ll create later in Adobe 
Dreamweaver or other web software.

The Save for Web dialog showing the slices
Put slicing on automatic
Do you want the boundaries of slices to precisely fit the boundaries of your artwork? 
Simply select one or more objects, choose Object> Slice> Make, and Illustrator will 
generate slices for all selected objects and for the empty spaces on the artboard. 
These slices are dynamic; you can add, delete, or change artwork and the slices 
adjust automatically.
Instead of drawing slices with the Slice tool, you can also create guides or draw 
objects that define the areas of the artboard containing artwork you want to slice. To 
create slices from guides, choose Object> Slice> Create from Guides. To create them 
from objects, choose Object> Slice> Create from Selection. The resulting slices, like 
those Roorda created with the Slice tool, can be moved, deleted, or resized if 
necessary.
Take the artboard to the limits
To limit the objects that will be saved as web images to those within the current 
artboard, be sure to enable Object> Slice> Clip to Artboard.
3 Saving an image and slices. To save your artwork as images that you can use in your 
web software, choose File> Save for Web and in the dialog, click the Export menu. If 
you want to save all slices (including slices that fill empty space on the artboard), 
choose All Slices. If you only want to save some of the slices, choose Selected Slices. 
With Selected Slices you can specify different image formats (such as JPG or GIF) 
and color tables for different slices. To do this, click the Slice Select Tool icon and 
click on a slice, Shift-click or marquee-select several slices, or drag over the slices, 
choose the Preset to make any other adjustments you need, and click Save to save the 
slices as images. Repeat as often as you need to save all of your slices.

ZEN OF THE PEN™ (Simulation by Laurie Wigham)
Laurie Wigham
Illustrator, ePub, & iBooks Author
When Laurie Wigham was working with Sharon Steuer on editing and redesigning 
The Zen of The Pen™ (info@zenofthepen.net) as both an ePub and for Apple’s iBooks 
Author (iBA), she realized that collecting all the Illustrator ﬁles into one document 
would streamline the workﬂow. The key to doing this was putting each ﬁgure and its 
caption on its own artboard so it could be placed separately into InDesign for 
export to ePub. In InDesign’s Place dialog she enabled Show Import Options so she 
could then choose to import all artboards. To use the same images in iBA, Wigham 
went back to Illustrator and chose File> Export. In the dialog she enabled the Use 
Artboards option, chose JPG format, and clicked Export to save each artboard as a 
separate JPG ﬁle. Because she had scaled the ﬁles in Illustrator to actual size and 
cropped the artboard to ﬁt the images, she was able to drag the JPG ﬁles into 
position in iBA without doing any extra work. However, after viewing the test 
document on her iPad, Wigham realized that the captions were hard to read. She 
went back to Illustrator to adjust the size and weight, using the Character Styles 
panel to change all the ﬁles with a few keystrokes. Back in InDesign she was able to 
automatically update the placed images, but she had to go through one more step 
for iBA. After exporting the revised artboards as JPG ﬁles, she had to individually 
replace the ﬁles in iBA. (Figures above, counter-clockwise from top: Artboards 
panel and artboards in Illustrator, InDesign Place dialog with import options, iBA ﬁle

Rick Johnson
Illustrator, CADtools, & Photoshop
Rick Johnson illustrated this GG1 electric locomotive, most of which were built in the 
late 1930s for the Pennsylvania Railroad by General Electric, for Classic Trains 
magazine using blueprints, photographs, and ﬁeld notes. One might be tempted to 
draw this using Illustrator’s perspective tools, but Johnson needed this drawing to 
be as technically accurate as possible. He began by drawing everything precisely 
to scale in “ﬂat” orthographic top, front, and side views, in Illustrator using HotDoor’s 
CADtools plug-in (download the latest demo versions from www.hotdoor.com/
cadtools). Then, also using CADtools, Johnson projected those surfaces to their 
respective trimetric angles. With the help of custom-angle Smart Guides (set to 39°, 
–12°, 90° in Preferences> Smart Guides), he aligned the pieces to their appropriate
X, Y, and Z axis. He divided the art into 76 layers based on logical groups (e.g., 
tracks and power trucks, underframe, interior components, skeleton, and shell). He 
then exported the art to a layered Photoshop (psd) ﬁle, and in Photoshop he 
adjusted the coloring, contouring, and shading. He used layer masks to reveal the 
most (and most interesting) interior detail while still showing the outside form of this 
classic locomotive, which meant sometimes ghosting several layers at once. Since 
he had already drawn the entire locomotive from the inside out, the ctr.trains.com 
website was able to repurpose the art, so visitors could disassemble the 
locomotive, peeling away a layer at a time.

MCGARRY
Aaron McGarry
Illustrator & Photoshop
To create this urban portrait, Aaron McGarry used the combined strengths of 
Illustrator and Photoshop. He began in Illustrator by placing original photos as 
template layers, and hand-tracing over them into another layer using the Pen, 
Rectangle, Ellipse, and Type tools. To simulate metal on the various components, he 
ﬁlled the objects with gradients from the Metals library (Window> Swatch Libraries> 
Gradients> Metals). Since each of the main objects represented a different depth, 
he next selected each main grouping of objects and applied separate drop 
shadows (Effect> Stylize> Drop Shadow). With the objects complete and 
assembled on various layers, he hid the template layer (Parts Of Meter).
539

Placing a photograph of a wall as a background layer (below the objects), McGarry 
then exported the ﬁle to Photo-shop, preserving the layers. In Photoshop he created 
the illusion of a glass cover on the meter by placing a photo of the sky. Then, using 
the Warp command (Edit> Transform> Warp), he warped the photo to the 
roundness of the meter face. He next added a layer mask to the photo layer and 
used a gradient (Black, White) to fade the lower part of the photo, blending it in with 
the background image and adjusting the opacity to simulate the reﬂective, 
transparent quality of curved glass. For the ﬁnishing touches he used a variety of 
Photoshop’s Brush tools, as well as the Eraser and Smudge tool (all with varying 
opacity), to paint the rust, stains, and grime, thereby creating a grittier look.

Ready to Export
Exporting Options for Layers to Photoshop
Illustrator & Photoshop
Overview: Organize objects on layers that Photoshop can understand; use Export to Photo-
shop (PSD) or Copy/Paste as Smart Object for editing layers in Photoshop; add texture or run 
other ﬁlters as Smart Filters.
When Kevan Atteberry wants to add finishing touches to his illustrations in 
Photoshop, he has several options for preparing and exporting his artwork from 
Illustrator. Shown above is a detail from his “Frankie Stein” series, where Atteberry 
uses Illustrator’s ability to write Photo-shop layers when exporting to the PSD 
format, as well as Photoshop’s ability to paste selected and copied objects directly as 
Smart Objects. Exporting layers as PSD layers is the quickest method for adding 
texture or other raster effects in Photoshop. To use Transform on the object (scale, 
rotate, etc.), Atteberry copies and pastes it from Illustrator as a Smart Object, which 
preserves the underlying vector for Photoshop to work with. (For the full illustration, 
see the “Frankie Stein” gallery following this.)
1 Organizing and rasterizing the layers in Illustrator for export as Photoshop PSD. When Il-
lustrator writes layers for a Photoshop file, it attempts to maintain the layer 
structure, including all the sublayers. But some types of objects, such as those 
created with brushes, blends, symbols, or envelopes, generate an unmanageable 
number of extra sublayers. Two important steps in Illustrator can prevent this from 
becoming a nuisance in Photoshop. First, Atteberry collects all paths that make up a 
given ob-ject into a named layer. This might be a sublayer of a layer that contains 
more of a subject, such as the “MUM-layers” containing a “mumsDress” layer. This 
is just like organizing your hard drive in miniature, making it easy to quickly identify 
what ob-jects the layers contain. Next, he targets the sublayers, opens the 
Transparency panel and enables Knockout Group (you may need to expand panel 
options). To extend our example, “mumsDress” now becomes a single, rasterized 
layer in Photoshop, but is still separate from “mumsHair,” and both are contained in 
a Layer Group called 
“MUMlayers.” Photoshop now can preserve Illustrator’s file structure and layer 
names, without creating too many nested groups.
1
Each brush object is listed in the Layers panel as a <Path> with a 
ﬁlled target icon (see the chapter Your Cre-
ative Workspace for help with targeting)
541

If Knockout Group is enabled in Illustrator’s Transparency panel 
(see the Mastering Complexity chapter in-
tro for more about the Transparency panel), 
sublayers become one layer in Photoshop
Well-named layers and enabling Knockout Group keeps layers 
manageable in Photoshop 
Upon Export to Photoshop, each object stroked with a brush in Il-
lustrator becomes a layer within a Layer 
Group in Photoshop 
542

2 Using Smart Objects and Smart Filters. Although any layer or Layer Group can be con-
verted to a Smart Object inside Photoshop, Atteberry copies and pastes Smart Ob-
jects directly from Illustrator when he wants to Transform or Warp them. After im-
porting and merging layers as described above, he goes back to Illustrator, selects 
and copies an object—such as Mum’s hand—that he wants to fine-tune in the final 
version in Photoshop. With the object copied to the clipboard, he returns to Photo-
shop and chooses Paste. A dialog pops up with options, and he chooses Smart Object. 
Once the Smart Object is in the right position both in the image and in the stack of 
layers, he hits Return/Enter to accept it. He then can delete the rasterized layer he 
had exported earlier, if it doesn’t contain other paths. The new layer will always link 
to the vector file for transforming (so the art won’t degrade the way pixel-based art-
work would) and for editing in Illustrator.
2
Pasting an object into Photoshop as a Smart Object in order to 
Transform the object without pixel degrada-
tion (blurring)
If he doesn’t need to transform an object, but wants to add texture inside Photoshop 
using a filter, instead of copying and pasting from Illustrator again, Atteberry 
converts the layer to a Smart Object from within Photoshop. Now he can run a Smart 
Filter on the Smart Object layer (in our example, mumsDress). This allows him to 
reopen the filter dialog at any time, change settings, delete or add filters, etc., all 
without altering the original object.

ATTEBERRY
Kevan Atteberry
Illustrator & Photoshop
For his “Frankie Stein” series of illustrated children’s books, Atteberry uses Illustrator 
to create the basic illustration, and then moves into Photoshop to add textures and 
special effects. He carefully constructs his layers in Illustrator to make sure that he 
can work freely and easily in Photoshop, taking advantage of Photoshop’s unique 
way of creating original artwork. In this illustration (spread over two pages), he 
prepared his Illustrator layers to use ﬁlters, Layer Styles, and Photoshop’s soft, 
feathered brushes. He did this by ensuring the elements that would receive the 
same treatment in Photoshop were kept on different layers from other elements. See 
the “Ready to Export” lesson earlier in this chapter for more about layer 
organization.
545

ATTEBERRY
Kevan Atteberry
Illustrator & Photoshop
Once Atteberry has imported his descriptively-named Illustrator layers to become 
rasterized Photoshop layers, he depends upon Photoshop’s ability to add texture 
with ﬁlters and images, blending it seamlessly into the objects he drew in Illustrator. 
He makes extensive use of Photoshop’s natural soft, feathery brushes to add 
shadows and highlights to his characters and their environment. He even paints 
entirely new characters, such as the ghost (Atteberry and Frankie Stein), using soft 
brushes and building it up gradually with multiple layers set to varying opacities, 
giving it its ethereal, ghostly quality. Adjustment layers are added to tweak color. 
The ﬁnal results of his multi-layered approach achieve his unique blend of the real 
and the imaginary.

ATTEBERRY
 Symbol Animation
Prepping & Splitting Objects for Animation
Illustrator & Animation
Overview: Draw characters using discrete objects for each part from which the animation will 
be constructed from; save objects as symbols; if you’re creating a SWF, import the saved .ai 
ﬁle to a Flash library.
When designing an animation, Kevan Atteberry uses Illustrator’s advanced vector 
capabilities for preparing a “morgue” of parts, and converts those parts to symbols 
for easy import into animation apps such as Flash. For this project Atteberry 
assembled his scene and his characters, creating the final animation for SWF output. 
He created an animation to send to friends as his Christmas greeting e-card using a 
snowbunny who finds a Christmas carrot. You can use many of Atteberry’s methods 
to organize elements for export to a number of different animation applications. See 
the CC section later in this chapter for Raymond Larrett’s example of prepping layers 
for exporting to Adobe Edge Animate.
1 Creating characters and splitting artwork into parts for animating. In order for his snow-
bunny and candy carrot to have “moving” parts, Atteberry drew each part that might 
be animated with custom artbrushes. By starting off with parts even before planning 
the animation, he ensured that he would have the maximum “play” to all their fea-
tures when it came time to create with motion. The snowbunny and carrot were de-
signed with unarticulated separate parts. He planned to use Flash’s transforming 
tools to generate motion “tweens.” However, had he needed a leg to bend in the mid-
dle, for instance, he could have drawn a path stroked with his artbrush in a start and 
ending position, and used an object blend in steps to generate in-between positions. 
(See the Mastering Complexity chapter for details on creating object blends.)

SWF output

2 Converting the separate parts to symbols. Having placed his objects on named layers, 
the next step to an animation was for Atteberry to select each part that he planned to 
animate in Flash, or parts of the scene he simply felt more comfortable drawing in Il-
lustrator, and turn it into a Flash-compatible symbol. Since the panels are “spring-
loaded,” he was able to simply hover over the icon with the object he was dragging 
until the panel popped open to receive it, which automatically opened the Symbols 
Options dialog. There he could give each symbol a descriptive name and designate it 
as either a Movie Clip or a Graphic. He could also have used the keyboard shortcut 
F8, or, if he’d wanted to keep that panel open during this process, he could click on 
the New Symbol icon in the Symbols panel. He kept the default Movie Clip Type des-
ignation, but Flash lets you change the designation for a symbol at any time. If you 
are creating an interface element, such as a button, Enable Guides for 9-slice scaling 
if you choose Movie Clip. Atteberry left that disabled. And finally, he could choose to 
save his symbols with a Flash registration point. This is the “transform” point that 
anchors an object being rotated or scaled, for instance, in the animation. This regis-
tration point, too, can be modified in Flash later on.

to go inside Flash

3 Importing Illustrator symbols to a Flash library. Once Atteberry had saved the Illustra-
tor file, he opened Flash, began a new document, and chose File> Import> Import to 
Library. He browsed to his Illustrator file, and when the Import (file) to Library dia-
log opened, he checked that all the layers for the objects were enabled, he enabled 
“Import unused symbols” (just in case an object was left off the artboard), and ac-
cepted Flash’s suggestion for handling an object that was not compatible with Flash. 
From this point on Atteberry was set to construct his scene and animate his charac-
ters using his Illustrator symbols.

by Health Promotion Services, Inc., funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute). To make the lines simple and expressive, Wigham drew the characters 
and other objects with the Pen tool. To create a relaxed and casual look, she drew 
open-ended unﬁlled paths, using a thick black stroke with a rounded end cap and 
corners (Window> Stroke). Beneath the outlines she created unstroked solid-
colored objects, deliberately misaligned with the strokes to produce a loose, cut-
paper look. Wigham created a collection of drawings that would provide a library of 
symbols for the animator to later assemble in Flash. She drew each character with 
different positions and facial expressions, and included a collection of separate 
body parts and props that could move independently. She assembled all the 
drawings needed for each tutorial unit in a single ﬁle, positioned on a “stage,” 
framed by the navigation and play controls of the website and browser. Each 
master layer in the ﬁle contained all the elements for a key frame within the 
animation, as well as motion paths and detailed instructions for the animator.

Illustrator & After Effects
Lee Daniels is a UK-based artist and animator who moves ﬂuidly between Illustrator, 
Photoshop, and After Effects (AE). Daniels’s memorable animated shorts add 
cinematic production values to his classic vector art characters. Although his 
animations end up in AE, they all begin with his meticulous organization in 
Illustrator. It’s in Illustrator that he creates every possible animated component of 
each character, separated into vector object groups and organized within a clear 
and well-labeled layer structure in Illustrator.
554

Once everything is clearly organized, Daniels can move into AE to pull in layers and 
choose speciﬁc objects (such as “monkey eyebrows”) to move into position in the 
555

AE timeline. As long as his Illustrator ﬁles are logical and orderly, once he’s in AE he 
can ﬁnd what he needs to keep production ﬂowing (Animating with AE). You can 
see this and many others Daniels animations at www.LeeDanielsART.com.

JOLY & RIDDLE
Dave Joly & Mic Riddle
Illustrator, Flash, & Cinema 4D
When Dave Joly and Mic Riddle collaborated on the “Trick or Treat” movie, they 
produced a unique mix of 2D and 3D artwork, using everything from Flash to 
557

Maxon’s Cinema 4D, to After Effects, to Apple’s Final Cut Pro, and it all started with 
Illustrator. To begin the 2D animation, they drew all the parts in an Illustrator ﬁle that 
they would use for a segment. Every part was placed on its own layer. So, for 
example, the man and woman seen here were created with separate heads, bodies, 
and expressions—each change in position on its own layer. They only needed B&W 
in Illustrator; the color would come from other programs.
Once all the parts were ﬁnished, they could choose either to create and name 
symbols in Illustrator for later importing into a Flash library, or they could save the 
ﬁle and import it to the Flash stage (which is what they did for this scene). They 
chose to have Flash convert all the layers as Flash layers, which preserved 
Illustrator’s layer names and organization. After animating the husband and wife 
talking, they were ready to export their 2D Illustrator art as a QuickTime ﬁle with an 
alpha channel (to create transparency around the animated characters), and from 
there take it into Cinema 4D to become a “texture” for a 3D type of “material” that 
controls how the 3D models appear. Eventually, with the aid of other programs, such 
as After Effects and Final Cut Pro, this 2D segment became incorporated into the 
rest of the movie.
558

RIDDLE & JOLY
Mic Riddle & Dave Joly
Illustrator, Cinema 4D, & After Effects
Still working on their “Trick or Treat” movie, Mic Riddle and Dave Joly created the 3D 
scenes for the animation. Again, they often began inside Illustrator. Most 3D 
programs are able to import Illustrator paths and use them as the start for creating 
an extruded or lathed object, such as the doorway and clock shown here, both of 
which have dimension. It’s these surfaces that, once lit in Cinema 4D or another 3D 
application, cast and receive shadows that convince us the objects are no longer 
ﬂat illustrations. And just as they created a layer for each 2D part they intended to 
animate in Flash, they drew each “object” on its own layer that would be extruded in 
Cinema 4D, making extensive use of compound paths to represent both a solid 
dimensional surface and a hole for windows, or the cavity for a clock’s pendulum.
559

They added more animation and camera movements, color, texture, and pattern, 
then rendered their movie “scenes” to be imported into After Effects. They used 
After Effects both for features that were easier to produce there, and to save some 
time tweaking a scene by not jumping back and forth between programs. Finally, 
ﬁles were collected in Final Cut Pro, where they added sound and performed ﬁnal 
edits, and saved as a .mov ﬁle (ﬁnd a low-res version of the animation on WOW!

MARIC
Finishing Touches
Adding Scenic Entourage Elements & Using Photoshop for Lighting Effects
Illustrator, Painter, Go Media, & Photoshop
561

Overview: Place a photo sky as the background; add entourage elements; create lighting ef-
fects in Photoshop.
To complete his architectural rendering created with Illustrator’s perspective grid, 
Pete Maric inserted a photo background, added scenic “entourage” elements, and 
manually created lighting effects in Photoshop.
1 Replacing the sky background image and importing entourage elements. Maric decided to 
change the mood of the illustration by replacing the background sky image to reflect 
a dusk setting. In Illustrator, Maric created a new bottom layer and chose File> Place 
to choose a JPG of a sunset that he photographed and transformed with Corel 
Painter. Maric relies heavily on a library of entourage elements (cars, people, trees, 
bushes, etc.) to add interest to his illustrations. After importing a couple of his own 
trees, Maric opened Go Media’s Architectural Elements Vector Pack and chose a 
bush and a foreground tree detail to copy and paste into his rendering. He sampled 
the grass color with the Eyedropper tool, then filled each bush with that color by 
holding Option/Alt and clicking. To populate the scene he duplicated each bush indi-
vidually by holding Option/Alt while dragging it into place, using the bounding box 
to scale when needed.

2 Creating lighting effects in Photoshop. In Photoshop, he rasterized the Illustrator 
file using File> Open, enabled the Constrain Proportions setting and set the 
Resolution to 300 pixels/inch. In order to help focus the image on the architecture, 
he darkened the corners by adding a blue solid rectangle layer, set the transparency 
to Multiply, created a layer mask, and applied a radial gradient to the center of the 
mask. Maric then manually created mood lighting effects by overlaying another 
series of gradient-filled layers on top of the image. He created the gradients by 
sampling color from his image using Photoshop’s Eye-dropper tool. He created the 
gradients on separate lay-ers, then he painted on one layer, added layer masks as 
necessary to each of them, adjusted the layer opacity, and applied different blending 
modes.
564

3 Adding realistic reﬂections to the windows and simulating interior artiﬁcial lighting. To 
create a reflection in the windows, Maric used Photoshop’s Pen tool to create an ac-
curate selection inside the windows. He then opened a photo, selected and copied it 
to the clipboard, and pasted it into the window selection using Edit> Paste Special> 
Paste Into. To integrate the reflection photograph into the overall look of the illustra-
tion, he applied Gaussian Blur and Watercolor effects to it. To create an interior light 
glow effect, Maric added an additional 50px feather to the window selection using 
Select> Modify> Feather, created a new layer, filled it with a light yellow color, and 
reduced the layer opacity. For added interest and to mimic hotspots from interior 
lights, he created a new layer, used the Elliptical Marquee tool to select a small circu-
lar area within the windows, feathered the selection by 10px, and filled the selection 
with the same color used for the glow layer. To duplicate the highlight, he held Op-
tion/Alt and click-dragged it into place. He continued to duplicate the highlights for 
most of the front windows.

Planning Ahead
Working Between Illustrator & Photoshop
Illustrator & Photoshop Advanced Technique
Overview: Plan ahead for export to Photoshop with layer organization; group or separate 
some objects on layers based on the Photoshop technique you will use; make a registration 
rectangle for precise placement.
When Dan Hubig creates an illustration like “Soothing Nervous Patients,” above, he 
relies upon both Illustrator and Photoshop to get the job done efficiently and quickly. 
Consequently, he constructs his files in Illustrator with Photoshop’s strengths and 
weaknesses in mind. Because the two programs have very different features, even 
when those features share the same name (such as brushes), Hubig organizes his 
objects so their Photoshop layers will allow him complete flexibility and ease in 
creating the finishing touches. And by setting his layers to flatten sublayers on 
export, he reduces the RAM requirements of his large files and shortens the time it 
takes Illustrator to create the Photoshop file.
1 Planning ahead. The main rule Hubig has when organizing his layers is that overlap-
ping objects he will work on in Photoshop do not reside on the same layer. As long as 
they are on separate layers when exported to Photoshop, he’ll be able to lock trans-
parency (which acts like a mask limiting a tool to actual pixels), clip an Adjustment 
layer so it affects only that object, etc.—all without having to make tedious selections 
inside Photoshop. By constructing his layer organization this way, rather than 
grouping by subject (such as the dentist on one main layer, with its parts as 
sublayers), he can rasterize all the sublayers, so Photo-shop doesn’t import them as 
nested Groups when he uses Knockout Group to export the blends he likes to use 
(see the lesson “Ready to Export” for a full description of this method). The trade-off, 
however, is that if Hubig doesn’t pay careful attention to naming the layers, once 
they’re in Pho-toshop, his layer organization may not always be as “intuitive” as it 
would be if grouped according to subject matter.
567

Photoshop to add texture and effects to 
objects without making selections
568

2 Preparing artwork for ﬁnishing in Photoshop. Aware of the Photoshop techniques he 
plans to use, Hubig is also able to save time by putting objects that will receive the 
same treatment in Photoshop on the same layer. If you look at the two floor shadows 
in the illustration, you can see they both have Gaussian Blurs and reduced opacity. 
By creating them on a single Illustrator layer, Hubig is able to apply the blur and 
change the layer opacity in Photoshop just once for both objects. On the other hand, 
by keeping the blue cloud on a separate layer, Hubig is able to make changes even 
though it overlaps other objects visually. He can adjust the cloud’s opacity, and by 
locking the layer’s transparency he can loosely apply a brush with a broad 
“Scattering” (set in the Brushes panel), knowing his paint won’t spill onto other ob-
jects.

two Illustrator objects placed on one layer, 
and reducing opacity for both at the same 
time
569

Locking just the transparency in a layer to limit the effect of a tool 
or command to just the pixels—essentially, 
“auto-masking” the object
3 Bringing new objects into Photoshop with a registration rectangle. Although Hubig typi-
cally eyeballs the placement of objects in Photoshop, you might have a need for preci-
sion when moving objects into Photoshop. Make sure your artboard and image sizes 
in Photoshop are the same. Then, to achieve precise registration, create an 
unstroked, unfilled rectangle on the top layer (to select easily) that is the same size as 
the artboard. Select both the object(s) and the registration rectangle, and copy and 
paste them as pixels in Photoshop. This positions your new art precisely where it be-
longs with respect to earlier artwork, and on its own layer. Finally, drag the artwork 
layer into position among the other layers, if necessary.

DEL VECHIO
Gustavo Del Vechio
Illustrator & Photoshop
When Gustavo Del Vechio wanted an illustration to go along with his humanistic 
interpretation of an urban development project, he decided to make it appear as if 
the designer could make a real city rise up from his pencil-and-paper drawing. He 
contrasted the ﬂat paper with the dimensional illustration, and the illustration with 
the full three-dimensionality of a photograph; then lit the whole to place the designer 
under a drafting lamp. He made the background from a simple rectangle ﬁlled with 
a white to black radial gradient. He ﬁlled another rectangle with white and used 
Effect> Stylize> Scribble on black-ﬁlled objects to create very ﬂat-looking hatch 
marks representing the urban area.
572

Del Vechio then linked the photos of each hand to a separate layer, adding Effect> 
Drop Shadow to one with a positive X value, and to the other with a negative X 
value, maintaining the illusion of radial light from above. Finally he added the 
completed illustration from his project for the urban development proposal. He had 
used 3D Studio Max for the initial structures, hand-traced the rendering, and later 
turned it into a Live Paint group to complete the colorful illustration (see his lesson in 
the Rethinking Construction chapter). Having placed his buildings in a designer’s 
environment, his ﬁnal illustration demonstrated what goes into creating a city, from 
the artist’s initial concept to a three-dimensional reality.
573

GILBERT
Katharine Gilbert 
Illustrator & Photoshop
Katharine Gilbert moves freely between Illustrator and Photoshop, mixing vector, 
raster, and 3D to express her vision.
For “Wind,” Gilbert began in Illustrator with an abstract painting that she created 
with art brushes (loaded from Window> Brush Libraries> Artistic> 
Artistic_Paintbrush and Artistic_Water-color). She then moved to Photoshop 
Extended where she applied the painting as a surface to a 3D sphere. After 
applying the texture image to her “world,” she placed a rasterized version of it in a 
new Illustrator ﬁle to act as a guide for painting the “wind” layers. She used the 
same art brushes as before, tweaking them slightly as needed. She turned off the 
image layers and exported only the vector artwork, which she saved with PDF 
compatibility.
574

Back in Photo-shop, Gilbert opened the .ai ﬁle as a Photoshop PDF, then 
experimented with the sphere, her Illustrator art, and some Photoshop brushwork to 
add shadows and more depth to the sphere. She duplicated the elements, merging 
them into a 3D Postcard, rendered several copies at different angles, and added 
more image elements for added depth and contrast. She placed the sphere above, 
and then tied her universe together by placing her Illustrator painting of the wind 
over all.
575

GLITSCHKA
Von Glitschka 
Illustrator & InkScribe/VectorScribe
For its part in the 2011 London International Technology Show, Astute Graphics 
commissioned Von Glitschka to create a poster with a British theme to showcase 
their Illustrator plug-in InkScribe. Glitschka researched heraldry, then combined a 
rampant lion with the recently-popularized 1939 WW II “Keep Calm and Carry On” 
posters, and came up with this poster concept. Glitschka made the initial sketch on 
paper, then scanned and opened it in Illustrator. To begin manually tracing over it, 
he selected the InkScribe tool. InkScribe consists of a tool (added to the Tools) and 
a panel with a new set of functions (accessed from the Window menu), so using it is 
completely seamless with using any other Illustrator features. The InkScribe tool 
replaces not only the Pen tool but also its editing tools (Add, Convert, Direct 
Selection, etc.). The InkScribe tool requires minimal use of modiﬁer keys to perform 
most functions, and also includes a customizable Annotations overlay (InkScribe 
Tool with Annotations), making for a very efﬁcient workﬂow.
576

Glitschka used the InkScribe tool to both draw and edit his paths. The user-
customizable functions and onscreen annotations made it easier for him to precisely 
adjust Bézier handles, change anchor point type, and minimize the number of 
anchor points as he drew, making clean-up and editing much easier. He 
occasionally also used Illustrator’s geometric shapes and Pathﬁnder operations, 
such as when he created the lion’s claws, and used Astute Graphics’ Dynamic 
Corners plug-in, part of Astute’s VectorScribe set, to round off some of the very 
sharp corners, adding a more organic ﬂow to the vector art.
577

YAP
Brian Yap
Illustrator & Adobe Ideas
Brian Yap began this illustration on his iPad using Ideas, a vector-based Adobe 
Touch app for iOS devices. He began with a photo reference layer of the shoes, 
drawing the linework with a NomadBrush Compose stylus on the layer above that. 
He next added other layers to develop the colors for the piece. To further enhance 
the image in Illustrator, he emailed the ﬁle to himself (he could have used the 
Creative Cloud to sync with his computer instead). Ideas produced an Illustrator-
compatible PDF, which Yap then opened in Illustrator. Every stroke he made in 
Ideas became a ﬁlled object with no stroke (similar to the Blob Brush, but without 
the ability to merge strokes). To simplify and merge similar paths, he selected all 
strokes of the same appearance, clicked Pathﬁnder> Unite, and then used Object> 
Path> Simplify and the Smooth tool to clean up paths and get rid of excess vector 
points. To ﬁnalize the image for silkscreen printing, Yap also took advantage of 
Illustrator’s robust color editing and transparency tools, adding gradient ﬁlls, 
applying blending modes, and adjusting transparency. Because Ideas runs on his 
lightweight, portable iPad, Yap can begin conceptualizing images wherever 
inspiration strikes, and then later use Illustrator’s advanced tools to bring his initial 
Ideas concept to fruition.

Janet Stoppee
Kuler, Adobe Ideas, Adobe Illustrator
Artist Janet Stoppee enjoys creating with a wide range of tools, from mobile devices 
to computers. For this image, she photographed holly berries with an iPhone. 
Stoppee used the iPhone Kuler app to create color palettes from the scene. On her 
iPad, Stoppee signed into Creative Cloud (CC), opened Ideas, and clicked the New 
From icon to select her holly image from the iOS My Photo Stream album. Stoppee 
reduced the image’s opacity so she could trace over it. In a layer above she drew 
the shapes of leaves and berries with the Pencil tool and then deleted the 
photograph. Next, she uploaded the drawing to CC and then opened the ﬁle in 
Illustrator from her synced Creative Cloud Files folder. In Illustrator, Stoppee used 
the Kuler panel to import the Kuler palettes she had made on the iPhone. She 
merged the imported Ideas artwork to a single layer and created a new layer below 
it for her Illustrator work using the Layers panel. Stoppee selected the Bristle Brush 
tool and began adding color and shading to the leaves and berries. She ﬁnished 
the image using variants of the brush with different opacities. (See the Expressive 
Strokes chapter for more about using brushes.)
579

STEUER
Sharon Steuer
Illustrator & Adobe Ideas
How do you get Ideas ﬁles from one CC account to another? When Sharon Steuer’s 
client asked for an illustration of a miniature sequoia leaf (less than 1" at full size) to 
use as a backdrop motif for a business card logo, she used the project as an 
opportunity to test tracing a template on an iPad with Adobe Ideas. She had used 
Ideas for quick ﬁnger drawings on both her iPhone and her husband’s iPad, 
creating quick, painterly sketches, but with a Wacom Intuos Stylus for iPad she now 
had pressure-sensitive controls. However, she still wasn’t able to draw with very 
much precision using the pen’s wide rubber tip. Then, at a Bay Area Illustrator User 
Group meeting, artist Brian Yap demonstrated how he creates high-resolution Ideas 
sketches—zoomed in very close using transparent strokes that feel like pencil or 
watermedia (see his gallery earlier in this chapter). Armed with Yap’s advice, she 
posted a template that she’d created in Photoshop to a ﬁle-sharing app. On the 
iPad, she opened it and added it to the device’s photo app, where Ideas could 
access it and place it into the semi-transparent Photo layer. She zoomed in tight on 
a small area of the top right corner and painted into layers above. Zooming out, 
she roughed in the outline of the leaf, named the ﬁle, and returned to the sharing 
screen where she emailed a PDF version of the image to herself. She downloaded 
the PDF to her computer and opened it in Illustrator, where each Ideas layer had 
become a <Clip Group> containing a <Clipping Path> along with her painted 
paths. Opening up each group, she targeted the <Clipping Path> and deleted it in 
the Layers panel. She also separately targeted groups of colors to change 
blending modes. Although she greatly admires Yap’s Ideas projects, when free of 
her own client restraints Steuer prefers drawing more ﬂuidly at 100% scale.

LARRETT
 Edge Animating
Layer Prep for Adobe Edge Animate
Illustrator & Edge Animate
Overview: Determine pixel dimensions of animation and create an AI ﬁle that conforms to 
that size; build the elements of the animation as a series of layers; export these layers as indi-
vidual ﬁles in the appropriate format; import the layers into Adobe Edge for animation. 
Artist, designer, and publisher Raymond Larrett has been exploring ways to add rich 
content to his digital publications. For the latest issue of his iPad magazine Thünk(a), 
Larrett turned to Adobe Edge Animate, the HTML5-based animation program 
included with a full subscription to Creative Cloud (if you don’t have full CC access, 
you can download a demo from adobe.com).
1 Sizing the artboard and building art in layers. Since the animation is intended for 
use in an iPad magazine, Larrett created a new document (  -N/Ctrl-N) and in the 
New Document panel chose Profile> Devices and Size> iPad Air (many standard 
docu-ment formats are available in the Profile and Size presets, or you can enter a 
custom size manually in the Height and Width boxes). He then named the document 
and clicked OK. 
581

Size the artboard to the pixel dimensions of the planned animation
Next he created layers in preparation for each element that would be separately 
animated. Files imported into Edge display in alphabetical order, so he began each 
layer name with a letter prefix, followed by a descriptive title. To create the first layer 
he double-clicked the default Layer 1, renamed it “a-hand” and clicked OK. For the 
rest of the layers he pressed 
-Option/Ctrl-Alt and clicked on the Create New Layer 
icon in the Layers panel to create a new layer below the first. He repeated the 
process of assigning a sequential letter prefix and name to his layers, building from 
foreground to background, until the layer structure was complete.
582

Make a new layer for each individual element to be animated
2 Exporting the layers. After drawing the set of objects to be animated on appropriate 
layers, Larrett exported each layer to a separate file for import into Edge Animate.
In order to do this, Larrett turned off visibility for all layers except the first, then 
chose File> Save For Web (
-Shift-Option-S/Ctrl-Shift-Alt-S). Because he needed to 
preserve transparency he selected PNG-24 in the Preset drop-down menu (with 
transparency enabled) and clicked Save, being careful to match the filename to the 
layer name. He then repeated this sequence for each of his other layers, saving the 
files in the same folder.
2
Click on the eye icon to turn off visibility of all layers except 
the one to be exported 
583

3 Importing the art into Edge Animate. Larrett opened the Edge Animate application, 
then selected Create New (
-N/Ctrl-N). In the Properties panel he set the pixel di-
mensions of the Stage to match the size of his file’s art-board in Illustrator.
To bring his Illustrator layers into Edge Animate, he chose the Library> Images 
panel, clicked the plus sign (+) on the upper right of the panel, and navigated to the 
directory where the exported files had been saved. Selecting the first file, he held 
down the Shift key, selected the last, then clicked Open (to import multiple non-
contiguous files, click while holding 
/Ctrl). Larrett then dragged each file onto the 
Edge Animate Stage, starting from the bottommost layer to the top. Now, with all the 
elements of the art available as separate objects, he could begin to create his 
animation.

In the Edge Images Library> Images panel, imported ﬁles appear 
in alphabetical order
Layer export scripts
Exporting layers can be tedious and time- consuming work, but an online search for 
“Illustrator layer export script” will display various JavaScript files (often free) 
designed to automate the export of your layers to any file format you need.

JACKSON (for The Orange County Register)
Lance Jackson
Illustrator & SVG
Artist Lance Jackson created this dystopian illustration for the opinion special report 
“Climate Change: A Rising Tide,” in the Orange County Register. When creating 
illustrations for use on the web, Jackson often prefers to save the art in the vector-
based SVG format rather than PNG, GIF, or JPEG ﬁles, which are pixel-based. Used 
properly, SVG ﬁles are faster-loading and scalable, with no loss of resolution. While 
drawing, Jackson was careful to use the fewest number of points possible, as these 
make the SVG more bulky (though the Object> Path> Simplify controls can help). 
Once the art was ﬁnished, he selected the Artboard panel, chose Artboard Options, 
then Fit To Artwork Bounds in the Preset drop-down menu, and clicked OK. This 
sizes the artboard to the exact dimension of the art. To export the art as SVG, 
Jackson selected File> Save As ( -Shift-S/Ctrl-Shift-S), named the ﬁle, and clicked 
Save. In the SVG Options panel, Jackson set the SVG Proﬁles drop-down menu to 
SVG 1.1 (the optimal setting for most situations). In the Fonts section he set Format 
to SVG and Subsetting (which controls how fonts are handled in SVG ﬁles) at None 
(use system fonts), as there was no text in his image. In the Options section he 
enabled Embed, since he planned to insert the SVG code directly into his HTML 
document, rather than link to an external ﬁle. The Preserve Illustrator Editing 
Capabilities option increases the ﬁle size, so he made sure it was disabled. Jackson 
then clicked the More Options button at the bottom of the panel, made sure 
Responsive was enabled, and clicked OK. Jackson then opened the SVG ﬁle in a 
text editor, copied the code to the clipboard, and pasted it directly into the HTML 
ﬁle. The responsive SVG image automatically gets larger or smaller, adapting to the 
size of the browser window with no loss of resolution (Responsive SVG). This is 
important for responsive websites, which are designed to rescale their content on 
mobile devices. When an SVG image is not responsive, it will get cut off when the 
browser window changes size (Non-Responsive SVG).

Sharon Steuer
Illustrator & Photoshop
After creating a chard leaf forest from raster art brushes (see her “chard forest” 
gallery in the Mastering Complexity chapter), Sharon Steuer was able to quickly 
correct an error and then make a new variation on her composition. When a friend 
spotted a mistake in the mask of a leaf, she opened the original leaf in Photoshop, 
repaired the mask, and saved the new ﬁle. Back in Illustrator, she selected the 
problem leaf, opened the Links panel, clicked the Relink button, and selected the 
new image, which then automatically resized to match the original dimensions. After 
applying Rasterize to this version at 150 ppi, she held Option/Alt as she dragged 
the repaired leaf over the original. After making sure her Options settings were 
correct, she clicked OK and then enabled Apply to Strokes to automatically update 
all instances of that brush. To create a variation on the composition, Steuer ﬁrst 
duplicated her chard forest artboard. She opened the Brushes panel, then selected 
each leaf and clicked on a different brush to apply that brush to the selected path. 
By nudging a few paths with the cursor keys, using the Bounding Box to scale or 
slightly rotate a leaf, or moving a leaf up and down in the stacking order using the 
Layers panel, in just a few minutes she was able to create a variation on the chard 
forest arrangement. In the image directly above she also used the Pencil and 
Smooth tools to create hills; applied gradients to copies of the background 
rectangles (Fading Sky for the blue, a customized Foliage gradient from the Swatch 
Libraries menu for the greens); and adjusted the angle and range of each gradient 
using the Gradient tool. Finally, locking the background layer, Steuer selected all the 
leaves and enlarged the leaves as a unit using the Bounding Box. (For links to 
movies demonstrating this process with a 7-day free trial, go to sharonsteuer.com/

Production Notes for The Adobe 
Illustrator WOW! Book for CS6 and CC
Interior Book Design and Production
This book was produced primarily Illustrator CC and CS6, Photoshop CC, and 
InDesign CC, using Adobe’s Minion Pro and Frutiger LT Std OpenType fonts. 
Barbara Sudick is the artist behind the original Illustrator WOW! design and 
typography, using Jill Davis’s QuarkXPress layout of The Photoshop WOW! Book as a 
starting point. Cary Norsworthy and Mimi Heft (who also designed our book cover) 
contributed to new page-design specs. Victor Von Salza led the porting of our 
templates from QuarkXpress to InDesign CS and modernized our style sheets. 
Cristen Gillespie keeps our copy-writing guidelines updated. Jean-Claude Tremblay 
is not only our technical editor, but his company Proficiografik produces (and 
troubleshoots) all the commercial and press-ready PDFs for the book. Although most 
of the WOW! team uses Macintosh computers, we now have testers and writers who 
do Windows (or both Mac and Win). We produced the book in Adobe InDesign CC, 
Adobe Illlustrator CS6 and CC, and Adobe Photoshop CC, mostly using Ambrosia 
Software’s Snapz Pro X for the screenshots. We used Adobe Acrobat XI for 
distribution of the book pages to each other, to testers, the editor and proofreader, 
the indexer, and Peachpit. Premedia Systems wrote custom scripts to help us update 
and sync the many InDesign files. Many of us use Wacom tablets and Art Pens.
Our fabulous WOW! testers for this edition: G Federico Platón likes to re-create urban 
scenes and common objects using the wide variety of Illustrator tools, using a close 
realism approach. Victor van Dijk is a Web and Multimedia Enthusiast, and you can 
find him via www.victorvandijk.nl, facebook.com/vfvandijk, @vfvandijk (twitter), 
and vfvandijk@gmail.com. Nini Tjäder is a Mac nerd (since 1984) with a love for pho-
tography, imaging, flowers, the Internet... and a lot of other things. She is a former 
educator in most Adobe applications since the end of the 80s. Chana Messer is an 
artist; designer; Adobe Certified Expert in Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and 
Lightroom, and the manager of the LA Adobe Illustrator User Group. Monika Gause is 
a graphic designer, illustrator, teacher, and author of books on Adobe Illustrator 
published in Germany and is a featured artist in The Adobe Illustrator WOW! Book.
