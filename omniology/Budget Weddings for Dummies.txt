About the Author
Meg Schneider is an award-winning writer with more than two 
decades of experience in journalism and public relations. She has 
authored or coauthored several books, including COPD For 
Dummies and Making Millions For Dummies (both published by 
Wiley). When she married in 1999, she and her fiancé had just 
closed a restaurant and had very little money to work with, so they 
looked for creative ways to keep wedding costs down while still 
having the kind of ceremony and reception they wanted. The final 
tally was less than $6,000 for a wedding with 100 guests that 
included professional musicians, butler-passed hors d’oeuvres, a 
three-course meal, professional photography, and a professionally 
baked cake.
Meg’s journalism honors include awards from the Iowa Associated 
Press Managing Editors, Women in Communications, the Maryland-
Delaware-D.C. Press Association, Gannett, the New York State 
Associated Press, and the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.
A native of Iowa, Meg now lives in upstate New York.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to Mark Dixon, whose favorite saying comes 
from a Geico commercial: “I saved. I thought that meant something 
to you.”
Author’s Acknowledgments
No man is an island, and no book comes to market through the 
efforts of a single person. I gratefully acknowledge the support and 
contributions of:
Barb Doyen, my agent and ardent cheerleader, and a fierce propo-
nent of saving money where you can.
Tracy Boggier and Sarah Faulkner, my editors. I thank Tracy for her 
skills in coming up with interesting projects, and Sarah for her abil-
ity to take reasonably good text and make it even better.
Copy editor Jessica Smith and technical reviewer Gloria Boyden. 
Jessica, thanks for keeping my voice active. Gloria, thanks for 
making sure my advice is sound.
Mark Dixon, who makes me laugh, and who has adapted remarkably 
well to the loopiness that so often accompanies life with a writer. 
(Plus, he buys me cheesecake when I finish writing a book.)
Jan and Dick Schneider, my parents, who, among other things, 
made planning my wedding as nearly stress-free as possible, and 
who have encouraged me to express my personality (even when 
that means breaking the rules) in every venture of life.

Introduction
W
hen I began planning my wedding in earnest, I bought a 
copy of a wedding planning guide for working women. I 
assumed, from the title, that it was aimed at women who didn’t 
have a lot of time or interest in planning a spectacularly formal and 
lavish wedding. Imagine my chagrin when I began flipping through 
it and came across a section on hand-rolled, personalized, indi-
vidually written (in calligraphy, no less) thank-you-for-attending 
scrolls for each guest’s dinner setting. Appalled, I flipped some 
more, gaping at advice about fancy bridal party breakfasts, in-law 
cocktail receptions, and hot-house orchids for a winter wedding.
I immediately called my mother, demanding to know whether I was 
expected to do any of this blankety-blank nonsense for my wed-
ding and who on earth was supposed to pay for it. My mother, who 
is a wonderful mother, said (this is a direct quote), “P’fft.”
“In the first place, you’re on a budget, so you have to set your pri-
orities,” she continued. “But, even more important, your wedding 
should express your personality. Don’t do anything you don’t feel 
comfortable with.” I don’t know when I’ve loved her more.
A year later, I had the wedding of a lifetime — personal and lots 
of fun for our guests — and affordable. It was in an atrium rather 
than a church because neither of us was particularly religious. We 
gave our guests kazoos imprinted with our names and the date and 
invited them to serenade us during the recessional (which they 
did, with exceptional vim if not precise harmony). We had butler-
passed hors d’oeuvres and pink flamingos on the wedding cake, 
including a flamingo bride and groom that I fashioned myself out 
of swizzle sticks, black ribbon, and lace from the local craft store. 
The final price tag for the wedding was less than $6,000, but my 
husband and I never felt that we had cut corners for the event — 
and neither did our 100 guests.
About This Book
Budget Weddings For Dummies is about making your wedding 
memorable and fun without going into hock up to your eyeballs. 
Contrary to what the wedding industry would like you to believe, 
you can have the fabulous day you’ve always dreamed of for far

less than the down payment on a house. Your wedding should be a 
reflection of what matters to you, not what matters to the wedding 
industry.
So you won’t find tips here on how to snag that designer wedding 
gown for only $5,000; instead, you find ways to look beautiful for a 
tenth of that price or less. This book examines every facet of plan-
ning a wedding and applies practical, real-world advice for getting 
the most out of every wedding dollar you spend. After all, let’s face 
it: Money matters. And there’s no point in racking up a bunch of 
wedding bills that will give you and your new spouse indigestion 
for months after you exchange your vows.
What’s great about this book is that you don’t have to read it from 
cover to cover. It’s organized in such a way that you can read what 
you need when you need it without feeling like you’re jumping in 
blind. All the chapters stand alone, so jump around as you wish.
Conventions Used in This Book
For the sake of consistency and readability, I use the following con-
ventions throughout the text:
 
✓ Terms I introduce for the first time are in italics, with a plain-
English definition or explanation nearby.
 
✓ Keywords in bulleted lists and the action part of numbered 
steps are in bold.
 
✓ Web addresses are in monofont.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have been 
split into two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I 
haven’t inserted any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indi-
cate the break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just 
type in exactly what you see in this book as though the line break 
doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Occasionally I include information that doesn’t directly relate to 
saving money on your wedding, such as the history behind certain 
wedding traditions and the meanings of various flowers. These fun 
(but nonessential) tidbits are generally set off from the main text in 
shaded boxes; you can skip them if you like.

 Introduction

And, of course, you can ignore any information in this book that 
doesn’t apply to your situation. If you’re already planning a church 
wedding, for example, you clearly don’t need to read the sections 
in Chapter 4 about other ceremony locations. (However, the infor-
mation about combining ceremony and reception sites may be 
useful to you.) Likewise, if you’ve already decided to wear your 
mother’s (or other relative’s or friend’s) wedding gown, you can 
save yourself the time and trouble of reading the gown information 
in Chapter 6.
Foolish Assumptions
When researching and writing this book, I made some assumptions 
about you, the reader. For instance, I assume that you
 
✓ Are getting married, are related to someone who’s getting 
married (and probably are footing at least some of the bill), or 
are helping a friend plan an affordable wedding.
 
✓ Don’t have unlimited funds to spend on your wedding, and 
you don’t want to go into debt to pay for it.
 
✓ Don’t want to elope.
 
✓ Don’t want to give your guests the impression that you’re 
skimping or cutting corners on your wedding.
 
✓ Are looking for creative ideas to keep costs down.
 
✓ Want suggestions on where to look for bargains.
 
✓ Have a computer (or access to one) and are familiar with 
online shopping and other online functions.
 
✓ Are more interested in simplicity and convenience than in 
complexity and unnecessary work.
One thing I don’t assume is that I know what your wedding priori-
ties are — aside from keeping expenses under control. That’s for 
you and your betrothed to determine (and I show you how to do it 
in Chapter 1). This book is designed to show you how to have the 
wedding you want at a price you can afford.
How This Book Is Organized
For Dummies books are known for breaking a topic down into 
broad subtopics so you can easily find the information you need 
without having to slog through a lot of information you don’t. This 
book breaks up the concept of budget weddings into five main 
pieces, with chapters that explore specific topics in detail.

Budget Weddings For Dummies  
4
Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan
This part provides you with the basics, such as coming up with a 
vision for your wedding, establishing a budget, and getting your 
timeline in order. I also offer a sample budget to help you get 
started.
Part II: Planning the Ceremony
In this part, I get into the nuts and bolts of your wedding 
ceremony — the who, what, and where for exchanging your 
vows. Chapter 4 focuses on ceremony locations, from the tradi-
tional church wedding to really offbeat sites (and everything in 
between). Chapter 5 focuses on ways to keep your wedding-party 
costs down. Chapter 6 is devoted to the marrying couple’s attire, 
including options for lowering wardrobe expenses. Chapter 7 
covers the ceremony details, from selecting a celebrant and hiring 
musicians to decorating the ceremony site. Chapters 8 and 9 
explore ideas for keeping floral and photography and videography 
costs under control. Chapter 10 looks at invitations and other 
printed materials.
Part III: Celebrating 
with Your Guests
The reception typically carries the biggest price tag of anyone’s 
wedding because so much goes into it: food and drinks, entertain-
ment, favors, and decorations. This part shows you how to host a 
terrific party on a budget as well as how to make the most of other 
wedding events. Chapter 11 takes you through selecting a recep-
tion site, and Chapter 12 addresses your food and beverage needs. 
Chapter 13 looks at entertainment and décor options. Chapter 14 
covers the rehearsal dinner, bachelor and bachelorette parties, 
and other pre- and post-wedding get-togethers. And, finally, 
Chapter 15 wraps up the part by providing advice for getting 
good deals for your honeymoon.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
I love the Part of Tens, because it’s such a convenient way to get 
a lot of information into an easy-to-read format. Here you find ten 
ways to get the biggest bang for your wedding buck, ten inexpen-
sive (but still classy) wedding favors, and ten wedding traditions 
you can ditch if you’re pinching pennies.

Part V: Appendixes
This part serves as your own personal workbook for keeping track 
of everything related to your wedding. With the pages in this part, 
you can fill out a planning calendar, keep a record of prices from 
various vendors, keep track of what’s been done and what still 
needs to be done, and write down your budget. Whew! You better 
get busy!
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the text, you’ll see icons that alert you to certain types 
of information. These can help you find exactly what you’re look-
ing for. Here’s a glossary of those icons and what they mean:
 
This icon indicates a better, cheaper, or more convenient way of 
doing something.
 
This icon highlights important information you should keep in 
mind, especially when you’re making plans, researching, or signing 
up vendors for various elements of your wedding.
 
In all likelihood, nothing will actually explode if you ignore the bits 
of text next to this icon. But you could end up spending more than 
you need to (or making another kind of mistake) if you don’t heed 
my warnings.
Where to Go from Here
The beauty of For Dummies books is that you can go straight to the 
info you want and ignore everything else. If you haven’t figured out 
your wedding budget yet, turn to Chapter 2. If you haven’t even 
decided what you really want for your wedding, start with Chapter 1.
Otherwise, check out the table of contents or index to find the 
topic you’re most interested in at the moment. For example, if 
you’re trying to save money on your wedding attire, Chapter 6 is 
for you. If you’re interested in low-cost photography and video-
graphy options, turn to Chapter 9.
One last thing before you dive in: We were a budget wedding 
couple, and many of our friends and family members commented 
on how elegant and fun our wedding was. So don’t let anybody — 
and especially not the $40 billion wedding industry — tell you that 
the measure of a “perfect wedding” is how much money you spend. 

Budget Weddings For Dummies

The true measure of your perfect day is how you express your love 
for and commitment to each other, and how you make your guests 
feel welcome and valued as participants in your celebration.

Game Plan

In this part...
P
lanning your wedding can be a lot of fun, but it can 
be extremely stressful, too. Before you get caught up 
in the hype of so-called “must-haves” for your perfect 
day, you need to fi gure out what your own dreams and 
limitations are. In this part, I show you how to focus by 
con centrating on what really matters to you and your 
spouse-to-be. I also show you how to create your wedding 
budget, taking into consideration the things that are high 
priorities for you.
A lot of wedding experts tell you that you need a year to 18 
months to properly plan a wedding. But you can do it in a 
much shorter time frame. I show you the tasks that need to 
be done and the best order in which to do them (regard-
less of whether you have two years or two months to pull 
it all together). Finally, I take you through the often baffl ing 
task of lining up vendors and other assistance to make 
your wedding as seamless and snag free as possible.

s soon as you announce your engagement, you’re inundated 
with advice and exhortations to make your wedding all that 
it can be: romantic, elaborate, perfect. This generally well-meaning 
advice can, and usually does, come from every quarter — parents, 
friends, the media, and (not least of all) vendors. As a result, plan-
ning your wedding can easily become an all-consuming venture 
that exhausts all your resources — mental, emotional, physical, 
and financial.
In this chapter, you can discover how to separate your own 
dreams and desires from the pressures you get from outsiders. 
You also can get tips for setting goals and priorities with your 
fiancé(e), for deciding how much you want to spend on your 
wedding, and for staying focused on what really matters to you 
as a couple.
Embracing the Real 
Magic of Weddings
People in the wedding industry call it “white blindness” — the 
tendency of so many brides and grooms to succumb to the glitz 
and fantasy of “the perfect wedding” regardless of the price tag. Of 
course, many wedding vendors encourage this response; after all, 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
10
they can’t count on your repeat business (despite the ever-higher 
divorce rate), so they try to make as much money as they can from 
each customer. And they do it by selling emotion as well as their 
product or service.
Unfortunately, many couples readily buy into the idea that their 
love for each other is rightfully measured by the expense and 
extravagance of their wedding day. This belief doesn’t hold sway 
because the couples aren’t smart or otherwise savvy consumers. 
It occurs because of a marketing ploy in which the wedding indus-
try keeps hounding you with emotionally charged messages like 
“You’ll look like a princess!” or “You only get married once!”
 
If you want an excuse to throw a fancy party and wear a princess-
bride get-up, wait until October and host a Halloween party. For 
your wedding, remember that you won’t find magic in orchids 
or tiered cakes. The real magic lies in the fact that you and your 
betrothed want to build a life together as partners, and you want 
to publicly proclaim your love for and commitment to each other.
 
Make a pact with your spouse-to-be: Whenever one of you seems 
to be suffering from white blindness, the other is authorized to say, 
“What matters is that we’re getting married,” until the symptoms 
abate.
Establishing Goals and Identifying 
Your Priorities
Planning a wedding is a big project, but few couples have anything 
but the vaguest idea of what they want to accomplish with their 
ceremony and reception. Even fewer can identify what they want 
to accomplish in their first year of marriage. As a result, many cou-
ples spend money on things that aren’t really important to them 
and, therefore, end up exceeding their budget to get the things that 
are on their priority lists.
Like any major undertaking, a well-planned wedding requires a 
mission — a reason for being (beyond the obvious one of entering 
into a legal and spiritual union, of course). Read on to find out how 
setting goals and determining your priorities for your big day can 
help you stick to your budget.
Setting goals together
You may find the idea of setting goals for your wedding rather 
strange. After all, isn’t the goal of any wedding to get married? 

 Chapter 1: Bringing Your Wedding Dream to Life 11
Well, yes and no. Certainly, the primary purpose of any wedding 
is to join two loving hearts in wedlock. But most couples also want 
to have a celebration that their guests enjoy and that allows them 
to express their own tastes and personalities. These desires may 
be goals for your wedding as well. To minimize stress and misun-
derstandings during your wedding planning, and to make sure you 
set a budget you can stick to, you and your spouse-to-be need to 
discuss the goals you have for your big day.
Your wedding goals won’t necessarily be practical or realistic. 
Your fiancé’s main goal, for example, may be for everything to be 
perfect for you. So, when the inevitable snags and snafus arise 
during the planning, he may worry about your reaction. However, 
if you talk about your goals beforehand, you can reassure him that 
you don’t expect a perfect day, and he’ll feel less stress. At that 
same time, you can set a new goal together — say, to enjoy your-
selves even if not every detail is perfect.
 
Here are some ideas for starting your own goals discussion:
 
✓ List what you’ve liked and disliked about weddings you’ve 
attended. Making this type of list helps you visualize your 
wedding from your guests’ points of view. Plus, it’s an easy 
way to identify any pet peeves you and your betrothed have 
about weddings (“The Chicken Dance” and smashing cake in 
each other’s faces, for example).
 
✓ Talk about wedding traditions and whether you want to 
follow them. You may choose to ignore the traditions of 
throwing the bouquet and the garter, for example — and, of 
course, doing so saves money on those items. Or you may 
forgo the traditional wedding garb or agree not to have any 
attendants. See the nearby sidebar, “Putting wedding tradi-
tions in perspective,” to understand the real reasons behind 
some popular wedding customs. You may decide you don’t 
really want to devote money to some of these things.
 
✓ Think about how you want to remember your wedding. 
Focus on how you want to feel when you look back on your 
big day. Do you want an intimate gathering so you can remem-
ber every guest and nearly every moment? Do you want to 
feel that you included everyone you possibly could? Do 
you want to recall how your creativity kept your celebration 
under budget? Do you want to feel that you had fun doing 
the planning and that you were relaxed enough to enjoy your 
wedding?
 
✓ Consider how you want your guests to remember your wed-
ding. Naturally, you want them to have a good time; other-
wise, why would you be throwing a party? So go a little deeper 
into what you want your guests to experience. Maybe you 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
12
want to make sure everyone is well fed, personally welcomed, 
or pampered a little. Maybe you want to ensure that they 
don’t feel obligated to take home a favor, to stay to the very 
end of the reception, or to participate in a “dollar dance.”
 
✓ Discuss what you want to accomplish in the year after the 
wedding. This discussion is a good way to break out of the 
fairy tale mind-set that so often surrounds wedding planning; 
it forces you to recognize that, after the wedding is over, you 
still have to build a life together. So talk about what each of 
you wants to do during your first year of marriage. Do you 
want to buy a house? Replace one of your aging cars? Start 
a business? Start a savings account for any of these things? 
Listing your financial goals for your first married year helps 
you keep the reins on your wedding spending.
 
Begin this discussion when the two of you are alone and can focus 
your attention on your wedding goals — perhaps during a walk 
or over a quiet dinner. Encourage each other to be honest and to 
listen to what the other one says.
Figuring out your priorities
Talking about your goals makes it easier to decide what really mat-
ters to each of you, and identifying your priorities makes it easier 
to create your wedding budget and stick to it.
To figure out your priorities and whether you need to compromise 
(see the next section for tips on compromising), each of you should 
sit down and list five specific things (like fresh flowers, your favor-
ite DJ, or professional video — not vague items like “everyone 
having a good time”) that you really want for your wedding and 
five things you don’t care much about. Compare your lists; cross 
off anything that’s on both your “don’t care” lists and highlight any 
matching priorities on your “really want” list. Finally, discuss the 
remaining items, noting how important they are to each of you and 
ways you can make sure each of you gets your top priorities.
Another option is to go through the wedding checklist in Appendix 
C and assign a number to each item — using a scale from 1 to 5, 
with 1 being least important and 5 being most important. You and 
your betrothed can do this together or separately. Either way, 
when you identify different degrees of importance, that’s your cue 
to start talking about compromises.

 Chapter 1: Bringing Your Wedding Dream to Life 13
Putting wedding traditions in perspective
Most people take wedding traditions for granted. Some are sweet and romantic, 
some have odd or spooky origins, and still others are just traditional because it was 
the fashion hundreds of years ago. The ones I list here have costs associated with 
them, so if you’re trying to decide which traditions you want to follow and which 
you can do without, this primer may help.
 ✓ The best man: In the days when men raided neighboring villages for their 
brides, a prospective groom often took with him a buddy who was skilled in 
hunting and warfare to help him fight off any angry kin of the bride’s. (By the 
way, the bride originally stood to the left of the groom so he could use his right 
hand to defend himself — and her — if her family showed up and demanded 
her return. In many early churches, weapons even were hidden beneath the 
altar in preparation for such a scenario.) See Chapter 5 for details on minimizing 
the costs associated with the wedding party.
 ✓ The diamond engagement ring: Engagement rings may be vestiges of times 
when women were considered property; even today, a ring on the third finger 
of a woman’s left hand indicates she’s “spoken for.” Until the 1940s, diamonds 
were seldom, if ever, used in engagement rings.
 ✓ The ring pillow: Since ancient times, crowns were carried on lush pillows at 
the coronations of new kings and queens. Eventually, this custom was adapted 
to weddings to present the most precious element of the ceremony: the rings 
that symbolize a new unity and unending love.
 ✓ The veil: In ancient Rome, brides wore full-length veils that later served as their 
burial shrouds. Veils also were common in societies that arranged marriages; 
the bride’s identity was hidden until the end of the marriage ceremony so the 
groom couldn’t back out if he didn’t find her attractive.
 ✓ The wedding cake: Wedding cake started out as rice or wheat cakes that 
guests broke over the bride’s head (or tossed at the couple) to ensure fertility. 
By the Middle Ages, guests simply tossed rice at the couple and brought their 
own scones or biscuits to the wedding; leftovers were distributed to the poor 
after the ceremony. In the British Isles, the guests piled their biscuits together 
and the couple exchanged a kiss over the top; the bigger the pile, the more 
good fortune the couple was supposed to have. The elaborate tiered wedding 
cakes we know today didn’t come into being until the mid-1600s.
 ✓ The white wedding dress: Before Queen Victoria’s time, people simply wore 
their best clothes when they were married; color didn’t matter. Queen Victoria 
popularized the white wedding gown in the mid-1800s, and Empress Eugenie 
(wife of Napoleon III) set the standard for the elaborate styling and details of 
wedding dresses.

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
14
Ban the phrase, “Whatever you want,” from your priorities talk, 
because that just puts pressure on the other one (usually the 
bride-to-be) to take responsibility for every aspect of planning, 
without really knowing what her partner prefers. Instead, discuss 
what really does — and doesn’t — matter to each of you. The areas 
you should discuss include
 
✓ The ceremony location: Do you want to get married in a 
church, or do you have another location in mind? Do you 
want an indoor or outdoor ceremony? Religious or civil? 
Formal or informal? See Chapter 4 for information on choos-
ing a ceremony site you can afford.
 
✓ The wedding party: How many attendants do you want (if any 
at all)? Will you pay for their clothing and accessories, hotel 
rooms, and other expenses? See Chapter 5 for ways to keep 
your wedding-party costs under control.
 
✓ Your attire: Do you want a fancy, traditional wedding gown 
and black tuxedo? Do you want to buy, rent, or make your 
own gown, or do you want to borrow your mother’s? Chapter 
6 covers clothing options for the bride and groom as well as 
ways to minimize these expenses.
 
✓ The ceremony itself: Do you have a minister, priest, or other 
clergy member in mind, or do you want a friend or relative to 
officiate? Do you want live or recorded music? Do you want a 
soloist? How will you decorate the ceremony site? See Chapter 
7 for more on working out the details of your ceremony.
 
✓ Flowers: Do you want fresh or artificial flowers? Do you want 
fancy bouquets and floral centerpieces for the reception? 
Chapter 8 provides information on how the kind of flowers 
you select and the quantity you buy can affect your budget. It 
also offers some less expensive alternatives to flowers.
 
✓ Photography and video: What kind of photos and video do 
you want? Do you want to hire a professional, and, if so, how 
long do you want her to shoot? Or are you okay allowing your 
cousin to handle the photography or videotaping? Check out 
Chapter 9 for ways to keep these expenses under control.
 
✓ Invitations and other printed materials: Formal weddings 
dictate formal invitations, which typically are more expensive 
than less formal options. Discuss whether you want other 
materials like save-the-date cards, response cards, announce-
ments, ceremony programs, printed napkins for the reception, 
place cards, and thank-you notes. For money-saving tips on 
your printed materials, refer to Chapter 10.
 
✓ The reception: What kind of party do you want to throw? Do 
you want a sit-down meal or a buffet, a cocktail reception, a 
picnic, or a brunch? How many guests can you afford to fete? 

 Chapter 1: Bringing Your Wedding Dream to Life 15
Will you serve alcohol, and, if so, will you offer a full bar or 
wine and beer only? Will it be a cash bar or an open bar? Do 
you want to provide traditional wedding cake or a different 
dessert? Will you party to a DJ or a band?
 
 The reception often is the main expense of a wedding, so flip 
to Chapters 11, 12, and 13 to find ways to cut costs and make 
smart decisions.
 
✓ Related events: Do you want to throw an engagement party 
or a luncheon for your bridesmaids? How about a hometown 
reception for people who can’t make it to the wedding? Will 
you invite guests to a gift-opening party the day after the wed-
ding? Chapter 14 discusses a variety of pre- and post-wedding 
events and how they can affect your budget.
 
✓ The honeymoon: Do you want to take your honeymoon imme-
diately after your wedding, or do you want to wait a while? 
What kind of trip do you envision? See Chapter 15 for informa-
tion on planning and paying for your honeymoon.
Talk about the vision you have for your wedding day and related 
events. You and your affianced may have different mental pictures 
of what your wedding and reception will look and feel like. Maybe 
you’ve always imagined an elegant evening wedding with a string 
quartet and butler service, and your fiancé(e) pictures a backyard 
ceremony followed by a pool party. Bounce ideas off each other, 
and don’t be afraid to combine elements from different kinds of wed-
dings to create a celebration that expresses both your personalities.
 
If you have a difficult time choosing among competing priorities, try 
running them through the Prioritizer tool at the CNN/Money Web site 
(cgi.money.cnn.com/tools/prioritize/prioritize_101.
jsp). You enter the financial items that you’re trying to decide 
among, and the tool asks you to select the most important ones 
among various pairings. When you finish your selections, the tool 
ranks your priorities for you. (This tool is great if you’re having 
trouble balancing your wedding wishes with your other financial 
goals, too.)
When you get your priorities in order, write them down and post 
them in a place where you’ll see them often. You may even want to 
make a copy to carry with you in your wallet so you can refer to it 
when you’re doing your wedding shopping.
Working out compromises
Unless you and your fiancé(e) have nearly identical tastes and 
priorities, you’ll probably identify one or more areas of your 
wedding where you need to compromise. You also may need to 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
16
compromise if one (or more) of your priorities turns out to be a 
budget buster.
 
The key to an effective compromise is fairness. Each of you should 
be willing to give up something that’s only of moderate importance 
to get something that you really want. Say you really want your 
favorite local band for the reception, and your future spouse really 
wants the matching platinum wedding rings with the diamond 
chips. You may be willing to use artificial flowers instead of fresh 
so you have more money for the wedding rings, and your partner 
may be willing to limit the dinner menu so you can afford the band.
Estimating Your Budget
Much of the stress that accompanies wedding planning can be 
traced straight to money issues — how much to spend, what to 
spend it on, and where it’s coming from. (Family feuds over guest 
lists come in a close second.) Chapter 2 covers wedding budget-
ing in detail. But before you and your intended get too far along in 
your planning, agree on a ballpark figure by asking each other how 
much your wedding day is worth to you in dollars.
You may be surprised at your answers. Here’s why: When one of 
you says or even thinks, “I want to spend $20,000 on our wedding,” 
you’re almost bound to start thinking about what $20,000 repre-
sents in your life. If you make $30,000 a year at your job, for exam-
ple, $20,000 represents eight months of your salary. Do you really 
want to work eight months to pay for a single day? Or, similarly, 
you may realize that you can buy a really nice car for that much 
money — or put a down payment on a house.
 
Putting a dollar estimate on your plans prevents you from suc-
cumbing to tunnel vision, because you’ll see your wedding budget 
in relation to your other financial goals and obligations. Your finan-
cial big picture acts as a natural brake on your wedding spending.
So how do you come up with a dollar estimate? Try one or more of 
these methods:
 
✓ Limit your budget to between 10 percent and 20 percent of 
your annual combined income.
 
✓ Find out what wedding goods and services cost in your area 
and use those numbers to build your estimated budget. This 
is useful if you really have no idea what’s realistic. Keep in 
mind that you still have to focus on your priorities, not just 
expand your budget to accommodate prices in your area.

 Chapter 1: Bringing Your Wedding Dream to Life 17
 
✓ My preferred method is less scientific than the preceding 
options but more personal. I recommend that you say dollar 
figures for the overall budget out loud in descending order 
until you get to one that doesn’t make you feel like you’ve 
been kicked in the stomach.
 
 I’m serious. Your emotions are more tied up in money issues 
than you realize, and it’s difficult to sort through your feel-
ings, especially when they’re mixed together with your emo-
tions about getting married. This technique is a quick way to 
determine your breaking point for your wedding budget. The 
highest dollar figure you can say out loud without flinching is 
the upper limit of your wedding budget comfort zone.
 
As you get deeper into your planning, you’ll fill in the details of 
your budget, such as who’s paying for what and so on. At the 
beginning, though, you and your future spouse should agree on a 
maximum so both of you know what your limits are.
Staying Focused and in Control
When it comes to your wedding budget, impulse is your enemy, 
and pressure is its co-conspirator. Wedding vendors — and some-
times family and friends — may do their best to get you to spend 
more, and it’s easy to get swept away by the glitz and emotion.
So how do you arm yourself against impulse and pressure? Think 
WEDDING:
 
✓ Wait: Give yourself at least 24 hours to consider a purchase 
before you sign a contract or fork over the cash.
 
✓ Evaluate: Get quotes from at least three vendors, and be sure 
the quotes have as much detail as possible so you can com-
pare prices, services, and value.
 
✓ Define: Identify how each purchase or expense helps you 
create the wedding of your dreams. If a purchase doesn’t 
quite fit your vision, it’s expendable.
 
✓ Discuss: Talk with your spouse-to-be, a friend, or a relative 
about the pros and cons of various options. A third party’s 
viewpoint can help you clarify your own thoughts and feelings.
 
✓ Insure: Have a backup plan in case of glitches or unexpected 
expenses. For example, have a good suit for the groom in case 
the rented tux doesn’t fit, or start a slush fund to cover items 
that go over budget.

✓ Negotiate: Ask for what you want, and know what you’re will-
ing to give on and what you want to stand firm for.
 
✓ Get away: Take a break from wedding planning and do some-
thing else you enjoy, even if it’s just an hour in the garden or 
watching a favorite TV show. Take a break at least once a 
week — and more often if you can — just to remind yourself 
that a whole world exists that has nothing to do with weddings.
 
Here are some other ways to help yourself stay focused on your 
priorities and within your budget:
 
✓ Keep your budget, list of priorities, and financial goals 
in easy view. The more you see what you and your future 
spouse have agreed upon, the less likely you are to forget 
those things in the excitement of a bridal show or vendor 
meeting. Use the forms in the appendixes at the end of this 
book, and post them prominently on the fridge, your com-
puter monitor, the bathroom mirror, or any other place 
where you’ll see them regularly.
 
✓ Take your wedding budget with you when you shop. Refer 
to it as often as necessary to remind yourself of what you 
agreed to spend. It’s even useful to get vendors to ease up on 
their hard-sell approach; just show them your budget for their 
service or product and say, “I’m sorry, but this is really our 
absolute limit.” If your wedding is at a low-demand time, the 
vendor may shade his prices to fit your budget.
 
✓ Pass the buck. Tell vendors, family members, and friends that 
you have to discuss things with your future spouse before 
making decisions. This tactic buys you time, which is the best 
antidote for impulses and pressure. (Besides, it should be 
true; after all, it’s your future spouse’s wedding, too.)
 
✓ Leave your checkbook and credit cards at home or in the 
car when you meet with vendors. Doing so forces you to take 
a break from the excitement, even if only for a few minutes, so 
you’re less likely to make a decision you’ll regret later.
 
Your wedding day is a big day, but it is only one day. More impor-
tant is the foundation you and your fiancé(e) build for your life 
together. Discussing goals and priorities, working out compro-
mises, and sticking to the plan you’ve created are skills that will 
serve you well throughout your married life, helping to ensure that 
your own “happily ever after” really does come to pass.

onsider this sad, but true story: In 2009, a groom-to-be in 
Austria robbed four banks to get the money he needed to 
pay for his fiancée’s lavish fantasy wedding. (Her must-have list 
included a Chanel wedding gown, a new car to drive to the cer-
emony, a 500-person guest list, and a Caribbean honeymoon.) The 
man stole nearly $500,000 before he was caught. He told the court, 
“The money from the first robbery went in a day, so I just kept 
going.”
Most couples, of course, don’t resort to crime to pay for their wed-
dings. But plenty go overboard with their wedding spending, rack-
ing up thousands of dollars in debt and starting their married lives 
that much further behind in the financial security game.
This overspending isn’t entirely the couples’ fault. Not only does 
the word “wedding” add a price premium of between 10 percent 
and 30 percent to virtually any item or service, but the wedding 
industry itself persistently promotes ideals of lavish spending to 
achieve a “perfect, special day.” It takes stamina and determina-
tion to stand firm against the hype and pressure you’re bound to 
encounter as you put the pieces of your wedding together. And 
you must know upfront what you and your intended really want 
and what you can do without.

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan

In this chapter, I show you how to figure out how much you have 
available to spend on your wedding and how to decide where that 
money should go. I also give you tips on helping your family and 
others who may be involved in the planning process understand 
the financial limits you’ve set. Even more important, I provide 
pointers on how to say no — without hurting anyone’s feelings — 
when a relative, friend, or vendor presses for an extravagance that 
you don’t want to pay for. Finally, I show you how to match the 
size of your wedding to your budget and provide a sample budget 
for you to review. You can plug your own numbers into a budget 
form in Appendix D.
Figuring Out the Cash Flow
The traditions of the groom’s family paying for the rehearsal 
dinner and honeymoon and the bride’s family paying for just about 
everything else are solidly behind us. These days, a third of mar-
rying couples pay all the wedding bills themselves; another third 
get some financial help from their parents and other relatives but 
bear the brunt of the costs on their own. In this section, I help you 
determine where your wedding funds are coming from.
Establishing who’s paying for what
Before you begin planning your wedding in earnest, you need to 
know where the money will come from. It’s all too easy to assume, 
for example, that your parents will pay for your reception, only to 
get a shock when it’s time to put down the deposit on the venue. So 
gently broach the subject as early as you can after the engagement.
Maybe your parents do want to pay for your reception — or maybe 
they aren’t in a position to help with expenses. No matter how it 
works out, you need to know upfront whether either set of parents 
plans to contribute to the wedding, how much they intend to give, 
and whether they want to pay for specific things or let you use the 
cash as you see fit. You can’t create your wedding budget without 
this information.
 
Sometimes people who give you money to pay for some or all 
of your wedding expenses think that the gesture gives them the 
authority to make decisions about your wedding. Of course, you 
should be flexible, but don’t let the generous offer force you into 
something you don’t feel comfortable with.
The best way to counter this is to be clear from the beginning 
about what you want and how that person’s money will be spent. 
For example, if your parents offer to give you $1,000, you may tell 

 Chapter 2: Working with a Wedding Budget 21
them that you’ll use that money to pay for the photographer or put 
it toward the reception. If, for some reason, your parents would 
rather pay for the invitations and the flowers, they can say so 
upfront, and you can adjust your own budget accordingly.
Calculating what you can afford
No matter who’s paying the bills or contributing funds, you and 
your intended need to have an honest discussion about what 
you want and what you can realistically afford. And, if you aren’t 
combining your bank accounts right away (or at all), you need to 
decide whether to split every cost 50-50 or whether to divvy up the 
items or services each of you is paying for.
Most important, however, you need to figure out where the wed-
ding funds that you’ll be offering up are going to come from. Do 
you have savings that can be used for wedding expenses? If not, 
or if your savings account won’t cover your costs, how will you 
finance the rest of your wedding budget? In the following sections, 
read about three common ways to come up with the money you 
need — and the potential dangers with each method.
Agreeing on a savings and spending plan
Depending on how much time you have before your wedding day, 
you may be able to create a monthly savings plan that will cover 
your wedding budget. Go over your finances together and discuss 
areas where you can cut back temporarily to meet your wedding 
budget goals. Maybe you can agree to limit or cut back on a few 
things, such as eating out, clothes shopping, the daily morning 
mochas, or cable, in order to divert the money to your wedding 
budget.
 
Consider opening a joint checking or savings account specifically 
for wedding expenses so that each of you can keep track of how 
much wedding money you have and how much you’ve spent.
Even if you do have a significant amount of money in your savings 
account, you and your fiancé(e) should discuss how much of it you 
want to use for your wedding. Check out Chapter 1 for tips on set-
ting goals and priorities for your big day.
 
Here are two potential hazards you may run into if you plan to 
save for your wedding:
 
✓ Life happens, and it wipes out your savings account. To 
paraphrase the old saying, unexpected snags can smash the 
best-laid plans to hash. Car repairs, medical bills, unplanned 
travel expenses — any of these or a dozen other inconvenient 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
22
problems can decimate your savings, leaving you without the 
funds you planned on for your wedding.
 
✓ One or both of you fail to live up to your wedding savings 
agreement. In this case, you end up with not only less money 
than you budgeted for, but you also have a great strain on 
your relationship. Money is one of the top three stressors 
in any marriage, and you certainly don’t want to spend your 
engagement with that stress. Make sure you’re both commit-
ted to your savings plan and be realistic about what you’re 
willing and able to save. (And make sure you keep track of 
what each of you contributes, just in case the wedding is post-
poned or canceled.)
Come up with a Plan B to cover either of the preceding scenarios. 
Your Plan B may be using credit cards, taking out a personal loan, 
or even putting the wedding off for a few months to give you more 
time to save. Or you can go over your list of priorities (see Chapter 
1) and do some further weeding to trim expected costs.
Using credit cards
Many couples charge their wedding expenses on credit cards. 
Under certain circumstances, this may be a good option. For 
instance, it may make sense if you
 
✓ Have a credit card with a low interest rate (lower than you’d 
pay for a personal loan, for example)
 
✓ Get useful rewards when you use your credit card — cash 
back, frequent flyer miles, or points you can exchange for 
hotel stays or other goods you’ll actually use
 
✓ Will be able to pay off the wedding bills within your first year 
of marriage
 
Credit cards are chock-full of pitfalls, however, including the 
following:
 
✓ Your interest rate may rise. Don’t think you’re safe if you 
pay all your bills on time and never exceed your credit limit; 
credit card companies have the right to raise your interest 
rate at any time.
 
✓ You may spend more than you planned. Researchers have 
proved that your brain reacts differently depending on 
whether you pay with cash or plastic. Using cash activates 
the brain’s pain center, which acts as a brake on spending. 
But your brain doesn’t register that same “pain” when you 
use a credit card, so the spending brake doesn’t engage 
automatically.

 Chapter 2: Working with a Wedding Budget 23
 
✓ You may fool yourself into thinking you can pay off your 
credit card debt with cash gifts from your wedding guests. 
The truth is that most couples receive far less in cash gifts 
than they spend on their weddings. Indeed, most couples 
receive far less cash than they expect even if they don’t plan 
to use it to pay off wedding bills.
 
✓ The “best-laid plans” adage that I mention earlier can wreak 
havoc after your wedding, too. Unexpected expenses can 
delay your pay-off plans, which will cost you more in finance 
charges.
Borrowing money
If you don’t have savings available to cover your wedding plan 
and don’t want to rack up charges on your credit cards, you can 
explore borrowing money — either from relatives or from your 
bank or credit union.
Lots of couples feel shy about asking their families for wedding 
money, and this can be especially true if you’re older and have 
been out on your own for several years. Making it more of a busi-
ness transaction can help ease your discomfort: Ask for a loan 
rather than an outright gift.
 
Explain to your families what you intend to use the money for. 
Better yet, give them a copy of your proposed budget. It’ll likely 
make both of you feel better to know that you have a plan based 
on your own priorities.
When you make your request, propose a repayment plan with a 
modest interest rate. This approach gives your relatives a chance 
to offer the money as a gift, to decline the offer of interest, or to 
make part of the money a loan and part a gift.
If your relatives can’t help out, look into getting a personal loan 
from your bank or credit union. In most cases, you can take up to 
five years to pay it back, and you may get a break on the interest 
rate if you agree to have payments automatically deducted from 
your checking or savings account.
Some lenders market “wedding loans” to help couples finance the 
day of their dreams. The problem is that interest rates on these 
loans — like anything else that has the word “wedding” in front of 
it — are often astronomical. You’re better off using a credit card or 
personal loan.
 
Never, never, never borrow against your home or from your 401(k) 
to finance your wedding. If you default on any kind of loan that 
uses your home as collateral, you could lose your house. And 
when you borrow from your 401(k), you can lose far more than the 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
24
amount of the loan because you have less principal working for 
you — which can seriously affect your retirement plans no matter 
how young you are.
 
If you’re thinking of taking on a great deal of debt for your 
wedding — no matter where you’re borrowing from — it’s time to 
sit down with your beloved and revisit your goals and priorities. 
Yes, your wedding is an important occasion, but it’s not worth dig-
ging yourself into a financial hole. In the long run, both of you will 
be happier if you have a wedding you can truly afford.
Calling for a Reality Check
 
Consider yourself forewarned: This section may depress you and 
make you feel that your dream wedding is out of reach. After all, 
weddings aren’t cheap — at least, they aren’t if you don’t follow 
the advice in this book.
However, knowing what other couples pay for their weddings is 
useful when you’re crafting your own budget, because it forces 
you to think about what’s most important to you. You may look 
at some of the dollar figures here and think, “There’s no way I’m 
paying $400 for invitations!” Or you may say to yourself, “If I need 
to budget $850 for flowers, I’ll have to look for other places to cut 
costs.”
Read on to see what the average engaged couple spends on their 
wedding and how to use those numbers to start creating your own 
budget. And, because budgeting on paper is different from com-
plying with it in your daily life, check out the tips to stick to your 
financial plan.
Understanding average 
wedding costs
How can a wedding cost as much as a new car or the down pay-
ment on a house? Where on earth do couples spend all that money? 
According to The Wedding Report (www.theweddingreport.
com), an industry research site, the top three expenses are the 
reception, the honeymoon, and the engagement ring. Together, 
these account for 70 percent of a $25,000 wedding.
Actual wedding costs depend mainly on size, scale, and location. 
A formal wedding with 250 guests obviously costs more than a 
backyard fete with 60 guests. And a wedding in New York City 

 Chapter 2: Working with a Wedding Budget 25
costs more than the same function in Iowa City. So before you get 
too discouraged, do some research to find out the average costs in 
your area.
 
Doing some legwork early in the wedding planning process can 
save you money later. Attend a bridal show or two and make a note 
of the prices vendors advertise. Or call around to several wedding 
vendors in your area and ask what the average package costs and 
what it includes. Vendors should be able to give you a range of 
prices. A print shop manager, for example, may say that his wedding 
customers spend an average of $250, but that he’s had some who 
have spent as little as $75. With this information, you’d know that 
your stationery budget should be somewhere between $75 and $250, 
depending on the quantity and kind of materials you have printed.
Knowing the average costs for vendors in your area gives you 
a basis for constructing your budget. It also helps you identify 
whether a given vendor’s prices are out of line.
Budgeting for tips and gratuities
Believe it or not, many of the vendors you pay for your wed-
ding expect tips on top of their fees, and, in any case, etiquette 
demands that you give tips to certain people.
 
Tips and gratuities can easily run into the hundreds of dollars, 
which makes them a real budget-buster if you don’t plan for them 
in advance.
Some tips are required and others are optional. For instance, 
tips are required for the following people (when gratuities aren’t 
already included in the contract):
 
✓ Altar boys/girls: $10 to $15 each
 
✓ Bartenders: 10 percent of the liquor bill
 
✓ Chauffeurs: 10 percent to 15 percent of the bill
 
✓ Coat check/restroom attendants: 50 cents to $1 per guest
 
✓ DJ: $50 to $100
 
✓ Hair stylist/makeup artist: 10 percent to 15 percent of the bill
 
✓ Valet parking attendants: 50 cents to $1 per car
 
✓ Waitstaff: 15 percent of the catering bill
 
Check your contract with the reception site to see if gratuities for 
bartenders and waitstaff are included with the fees. If they are, 
you don’t have to tip these folks extra. However, if one of the staff 
delivers exceptional service at your reception, you may want to 
show your appreciation with an extra tip.

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
26
Generally, you don’t need to tip business owners; for them, a sin-
cere thank-you note is appropriate. However, if the person actu-
ally providing the service is an employee, or if the service greatly 
exceeds your expectations, you may want to offer a tip. Tips are 
optional for the following professionals:
 
✓ Baker/cake designer: $10 to $20
 
✓ Catering/reception manager: $50 to $100
 
✓ Musicians: $5 to $10 per hour for each musician
 
✓ Florist: $10 to $20 per staff member
 
✓ Officiant: $75 to $200 (which may be in the form of a contribu-
tion to the church)
 
✓ Photographer/videographer: $50
 
✓ On-site wedding coordinator: $50
 
✓ Wedding planner: 10 percent of her total bill
Pay tips in cash. Place them in envelopes and arrange for them to 
be distributed right before the vendor or staff person leaves. This 
way, you can better judge how much of a tip she’s earned. The 
best man usually takes charge of distributing tips and final vendor 
payments; if you don’t have a best man, designate a trusted person 
to take care of this for you.
Insuring against budget-busters
The tighter your budget, the more important it is to build in a 
cushion for unanticipated expenses. A slush fund of between 10 
percent and 15 percent of your total budget gives you breath-
ing room when one of your line items costs a bit more than you 
expect. Plus, by setting this money aside upfront, you don’t have 
to frantically redo your budget to find the extra funds.
 
Keep your slush fund separate from your regular wedding fund so 
you only tap into it when you need it. This way you’re more likely 
to reach your wedding day at or below your budget — a great way 
to start your married life!
Agreeing on limits
Nearly half of all couples go over their set wedding budgets. In 
some cases, cost overruns may be unavoidable. If fuel prices 
spike, for example, your wedding vendors may raise their rates 

 Chapter 2: Working with a Wedding Budget 27
to compensate for their extra expenses. This is a good reason to 
include a slush fund in your budget (see the preceding section for 
details).
In many other cases, however, extra expenses arise because 
couples give in to impulses or requests from family members 
and close friends. Or they simply don’t keep a close eye on what 
they’re spending.
 
Here are some tricks to help you stick to your budget:
 
✓ Make sure you both understand and agree to the budget 
you’ve worked out. Think of it as good practice for merging 
your finances after the wedding.
 
✓ Post your budget in a place where you’ll see it often, such 
as on the refrigerator. If you and your fiancé(e) don’t live 
together, make sure each of you has a copy of the budget 
you’ve agreed on.
 
✓ Discuss any adjustments before you include them in your 
budget (or pay vendors more than the budgeted amount). 
For example, if you find a cake topper you love, but it costs 
$50 more than you budgeted for, talk to your intended before 
you commit to spending the extra money.
 
✓ Look for other areas you could trim to compensate for an 
additional expense. Say you forgot to include your great-aunt 
and her husband in your guest list, and your mother insists 
that you invite them. If your reception cost is $40 per guest, 
you’ll need to shave $80 from somewhere else in the budget — 
perhaps by deciding on a less expensive bouquet or choosing 
less expensive centerpieces.
 
✓ Write down any changes or adjustments you’ve agreed to. 
That way, you won’t experience misunderstandings later.
Getting Others on Board 
with Your Budget
It’s one thing for the two of you to establish your budget. Getting 
others to respect it is a different challenge altogether. As soon 
as you announce your engagement, you’ll get (often unwanted) 
advice and questions about your wedding. And when you meet 
with vendors, they may be far too busy painting roseate pictures of 
wedding-day bliss to pay attention to your financial limits.

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
28
Dealing with pushy 
friends and family
 
Anytime someone begins a sentence with, “Are you going to . . .?” or 
“You should have . . .” be on guard for suggestions that are likely to 
wreak havoc with your budget.
Of course, when these suggestions come from people far removed 
from your inner circle, you can easily shrug them off. Just listen 
politely, say, “That’s an interesting idea,” and then go ahead and 
do what you already planned to do. But when the advice or ideas 
come from family members and close friends, you may feel pres-
sured to give in — perhaps because you aren’t sure how to politely 
tell them that their suggestions don’t fit your financial reality. 
Plus, saying no to these family members and friends goes against 
the almost universal desire to please and be considered a “good 
person.” Many people feel so guilty at the thought of saying no that 
they say yes far more often than they should.
 
You may be able to preempt some of these awkward discussions by 
sharing your written budget with those who have a financial stake 
in your wedding — any family member or friend who’s contributing 
money. In fact, these stakeholders may be more comfortable if they 
have a clear idea of the limits you’ve set; most people won’t offer sug-
gestions that are out of your range if they know what your range is.
Here are some ways to say no without feeling guilty or like a “bad” 
person:
 
✓ “I wish I could, but our budget is really tight.” This response 
avoids the appearance of singling out a request for denial and 
explains the reason you’re saying no. If the person making the 
request urges that it wouldn’t cost that much extra, you can 
counter with the research you’ve done. Or you can even let 
the requester see your budget.
 
✓ “I haven’t seen Aunt Tilly since I was seven. I think I’ll just 
send her an announcement.” When others urge you to add 
virtual strangers to your guest list, this response alerts them 
to your actual relationship. The suggestion of a more appro-
priate gesture — sending an announcement — also makes 
clear that you aren’t ignoring the family tie.
 
✓ “We’ve decided that we only want to invite family and close 
friends.” This statement is useful if a family member or friend 
wants to invite business associates or clients — a surefire 
way to bloat your guest list and shatter your carefully crafted 
budget. It also reaffirms that this is your wedding, and you 
have the final say.

 Chapter 2: Working with a Wedding Budget 29
 
✓ “We’ve made so many tough decisions on the guest list 
already, and we really can’t squeeze anyone else in. Maybe 
we can all get together for dinner after we get back from 
our honeymoon.” Use this response when someone you’ve 
invited asks to bring an extra guest (commonly a boyfriend- 
or girlfriend-of-the-moment). It offers a peek at the thought 
you’ve put into your guest list as well as a hospitable 
alternative.
 
✓ “That’s a good idea, but I don’t have the time or money to 
do it.” If your mother or your best friend wants you to create 
elaborate favors or centerpieces, pleading lack of time is the 
perfect answer. The requester is sure to understand that you 
have lots to do. Plus, it may prompt her to offer to do it her-
self, which also could ease the strain on your budget (as long 
as that person pays for the supplies, of course).
 
It’s your celebration, your wallet, and your sanity. Say yes when 
you can, but don’t be afraid to say no when it’s in your best 
interests.
Handling overzealous vendors
Don’t count out wedding vendors when it comes to unwanted 
advice. They almost always try to up-sell clients — that is, convince 
them to spend more than they were planning to. They usually play 
on your emotions: “Aren’t you worth the super-deluxe package? 
You’ll look just like Princess Diana!” or “I’ve known so many brides 
who regretted not having the four-tier cake they really wanted.”
It’s often easier to say no to vendors than it is to those nearest 
and dearest to you, but if you’ve ever been in the same room as 
an overzealous wedding vendor, you know how difficult it can be 
to decline their services or suggestions. So be sure to take your 
budget with you when you meet with the vendors. Having your 
budget in hand can do wonders for your common sense; it’s the 
only known antidote to emotion-based overspending.
Matching Your Guest 
List to Your Budget
The question of whether you should set your guest list or your 
wedding budget first is sort of like deciding whether the chicken or 
the egg came first.

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
30
If you set your budget first, you can figure out the per-guest cost, 
which gives you your guest list limit. Say, for example, your recep-
tion budget is $2,500, and the cost per person at the site you want 
is $25 for food and $15 for the bar (wine, beer, and soda). That 
limits your guest list to about 60 people (60 × $40 = $2,400).
On the other hand, you can figure that you’ll have 100 guests, 
which means you need to keep reception costs at $25 or less per 
person. That per-guest cost likely rules out most traditional recep-
tion halls, so you may have to start brainstorming nontraditional 
ideas for your reception.
 
Neither method is better than the other; it depends on your 
circumstances and priorities. If you and your betrothed have 
large families, maybe you’d rather have a cookout reception so 
you can invite all your relatives. If you expect your guest list to 
be smaller, though, you can let your budget dictate the number 
of people you invite.
Ballpark figures also help you eliminate venues that are out of your 
price range or are too small or too big for the number of guests 
you expect. Whether you start with your budget or your expected 
guest list, you should come up with at least a ballpark figure for 
your guest list before you start visiting possible ceremony and 
reception sites. No matter what kind of ceremony and reception 
you have, the site should fit both the ambience you want to create 
and the number of people you expect to host.
A vast church sanctuary is the wrong place for an intimate cer-
emony, for example, and even a mid-sized ceremony may feel small 
in a church that can seat several hundred people. On the other 
hand, stuffing 100 people into a space intended for 50 makes every-
one uncomfortable (including your community’s fire marshal).
Knowing the rough size of your guest list helps you eliminate sites 
that don’t fit your vision, allowing you to spend your time and 
energy looking at appropriate sites for your ceremony and 
reception.
 
With most ceremony and reception sites, you can get by with a 
handful more guests than you originally expected. But if that hand-
ful grows too much, it may push you out of those affordable sites 
and force you to come up with a new plan for your celebration. 
And reworking your plan definitely creates a lot more work and 
may cause stress overload.

 Chapter 2: Working with a Wedding Budget 31
 
Before you get too far into your planning, share your budget and 
your ballpark guest list figure with your parents and your future in-
laws; they’re the people who are most likely to insist on additional 
guests. If they know upfront what you can afford and what you 
have in mind, they’re more likely to curb their own requests.
If either set of parents still insists, tactfully remind them of your 
limits and suggest that you’d be happy to invite their extra guests 
if they’re willing to cover the additional expenses (assuming, 
of course, that your site can accommodate extra guests). If you 
need guidance in the best ways to say no, see the earlier section 
“Dealing with pushy friends and family.”
Looking at a Sample Budget
The sample budget in this section uses the form from Appendix 
D, which has been modified to reflect the priorities of a bride and 
groom. (In the interests of conserving space, this sample doesn’t 
include the items the couple decided against.)
The budget is for an evening wedding with 100 guests. The couple 
has chosen to have the ceremony and reception at the same loca-
tion. The bride will wear an ivory bridesmaid dress rather than a 
traditional wedding gown, and the groom will wear a suit. The con-
tract for the reception includes gratuities for bartenders and serv-
ers, table linens, and decorations for the ceremony area. Friends of 
the bride’s family are to provide the ceremony music, and a friend 
of the groom has agreed to DJ the reception for a modest fee. This 
couple also has decided to delay their honeymoon until after their 
first year of marriage. As you can see, this couple used less than 
$100 of their cushion — a result of good planning and shopping 
around for the best deals.

Deciding When to Get 
Married and Organizing 
Your Timeline
In This Chapter
▶ Planning the best time for your special day
▶ Working on your guest list
▶ Being the first to book your ceremony and reception sites
▶ Staying on schedule with some important milestones
P
lanning a wedding is kind of like looking at a class syllabus 
at the beginning of a new school semester: There’s so much 
to do that your brain freezes, stunned by the enormity of the 
task. But, just like when you were in school, all these tasks don’t 
have to be done at once. Some, like getting your marriage license, 
even have to wait until you get much closer to your wedding date. 
Organizing your timeline thaws out your brain and allows you to 
break this massive project into manageable pieces.
Creating a timeline also can save you money. Everything about 
your wedding — from the date you exchange vows and the time 
you dance your first dance, to the number of people you invite and 
the lavishness of your decorations — has a price tag attached. So 
how does following a timeline save you money? It stops you from 
procrastinating, which can cause you to have to settle on high-
priced alternatives.
The average span between getting engaged and getting married is 
16 months, and the conventional wedding planning timeline is a 
year. But lots of people pull together lovely weddings in a quarter 
of the conventional time, even if they’re on a budget. No matter 
how much time you have to plan your wedding, the key to stay-
ing organized and within your budget is to set your priorities (see 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
36
Chapter 1) and do first things first. The timeline in Appendix A 
shows you which tasks need to be completed first and which can 
wait; if you have less than a year to plan your wedding, simply 
compress the tasks in the appendix to fit your timeline.
In this chapter, I show you how setting and following your timeline 
can ensure that you get what you want at a price you can handle.
Choosing a Date and Time 
to Suit Your Wallet
Perhaps it has never occurred to you to have your wedding on any 
day other than a Saturday evening in June. But, then again, maybe 
you didn’t realize that you can save quite a bit of money by choos-
ing a Tuesday afternoon in April or a Friday evening in October.
The sooner you decide on a wedding date, the sooner you can 
begin researching locations that fit with your vision for your wed-
ding. Maybe you’ve always dreamed of a spring wedding that’s all 
daisies and sunshine. Or maybe (especially if you suffer from hay 
fever) you’ve always thought a winter wedding would be nice, with 
crackling wood fires and warming drinks. Whatever your vision is, 
you’re more likely to score the venue you want (at a price you can 
afford) if you start your search early.
 
Begin with your ideal date, day, and time, and then research the 
basic costs for it — location rental and catering. If the costs strain 
your budget too far, look into how changing the day of the week 
and the time of day would affect the price.
In the following sections, I show you how to choose a date and 
time that are less expensive than that traditional Saturday evening 
in June.
Understanding how dates 
and times affect prices
Your wedding date and the time of your reception can affect prices 
for everything from the catering to the photography bill by 30 per-
cent or more. June and September are the most popular wedding 
months in the U.S., which means more couples are competing for 
ceremony and reception space and the usual wedding services. In 
basic supply-and-demand fashion, vendors naturally charge their 
highest prices when their services are most in demand; the cou-
ples who are willing and able to pay those prices get the contracts.

 Chapter 3: Deciding When to Get Married and Organizing Your Timeline 37
Evening weddings are the most popular and usually the most 
expensive. An evening wedding typically is more formal, which 
means more expensive attire, accessories, flowers, decorations, 
and food. And, of course, Saturdays are the most popular days for 
weddings. So a Saturday evening in June or September is likely to 
be the most expensive option for your wedding.
You can stick to your budget if you get married on a Saturday 
evening in June; I did. If the date or time of the wedding is one of 
your top priorities, you simply need to look for other ways to save 
in order to balance out the more expensive wedding date. See the 
sample budget in Chapter 2 to figure out where you can save.
Selecting cheaper months
June and September are the most popular wedding months in large 
part because, in most areas of the country, the weather is neither 
too cold nor too hot. You gamble more on the weather earlier in 
the spring or later in the fall, especially if you want an outdoor 
location.
 
January, March, April, and November can be far less expensive 
months for marrying. Venue prices may be lower, and vendor 
prices are likely to be significantly lower simply because the 
demand isn’t as great.
Notice that this list of cheaper months doesn’t include February, 
May, July, August, October, or December. February and December 
aren’t value priced because of St. Valentine’s Day and Christmas. 
Lots of couples get married on or around the lover’s holiday, 
which means more competition for venues and vendors. In 
December (and on New Year’s Eve), your competition may not 
be other marrying couples but holiday parties that use many of 
the same venues and vendors that weddings do. July and August 
dates tend to fill up fast with couples who didn’t book their June or 
September dates early enough. And May and October are popular 
wedding months in the Midwest.
 
Meetings and conventions can ruin your plans, too. Call your local 
chamber of commerce or convention bureau to find out when 
these kinds of gatherings are scheduled so you can plan around 
them. Also check dates for local college or high school reunions 
and homecoming weekends. If you live in or are getting married in 
a Spring Break hot spot like the Florida Keys or Mexico, you may 
want to avoid planning a February, March, or April wedding.
Some wedding experts recommend Memorial Day and Labor Day 
as good weekends to get married, because venues and vendors 
often are cheaper and guests have more time to travel. However, 
travel is more difficult and more costly on these holidays, which 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
38
may prevent some guests from attending. Plus, holiday crowds 
may overrun hotels, beauty salons and spas, and other locations 
like parks and beaches. Be sure to weigh the pros and cons before 
you settle on a holiday wedding date.
Selecting cheaper days of the week
Ceremony and reception site rental rates are typically least expen-
sive on weekdays and Sundays. Hotel rates usually are lower 
Sunday through Thursday, too — something to consider if you’ll 
be paying for your own wedding suite or for a room for a VIP guest 
from out of town (such as a relative or friend who’s serving as 
officiant).
 
Airfares are typically cheaper on weekdays, too, so you could save 
money on your honeymoon travel costs if you get married on, 
say, a Tuesday and leave for your honeymoon on Wednesday. See 
Chapter 15 for more on saving money on your honeymoon.
Other vendor rates also may be lower on these days, especially 
photographers, florists, DJs, and bakers or cake designers. Fridays 
and Saturdays are busy days for these folks, so they can charge 
more. But the weekdays, especially Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 
and Sunday are usually slower business days, so you may be able 
to negotiate a lower rate even if the vendor doesn’t automatically 
offer a discount. (Refer to Chapters 8, 9, 11, and 13 for more on 
getting the best prices from specific vendors.)
 
The main reason most couples get married on a Saturday is 
because they figure it’s easier for guests to attend. But if you get 
married on a Thursday, your out-of-town guests can get cheaper 
airfares, and your local guests should be able to arrange to take 
the day off from work if you give them the usual six to eight weeks’ 
notice.
Selecting cheaper times of the day
Food and drink gobble up the lion’s share of most wedding bud-
gets. However, you can cut these costs dramatically simply by 
changing the time of your wedding. For example, you can explore 
the following options:
 
✓ A 9 a.m. ceremony followed by an elegant brunch: Breakfast 
food is much cheaper than lunch or dinner fare, and you can 
fill out the menu with fresh fruit, made-to-order omelet sta-
tions, and delicious breads and pastries. Because of the lower 
food cost, you can even invite more guests or provide a wider 
variety of food and still stick to your budget.
 
✓ A 2 p.m. wedding with a cake reception: Serve cake and a 
variety of beverages (punch, coffee, tea, and soda, for example) 

 Chapter 3: Deciding When to Get Married and Organizing Your Timeline 39
and supplement it with a sweet-and-salty snack buffet. You 
also can include a chocolate fountain with fresh fruit, graham 
crackers, pretzels, and potato chips for dipping.
 
✓ A 4 p.m. wedding followed by a cocktail party: Arrange for 
butler-passed hors d’oeuvres and stations with cheese, crack-
ers, fruit, and veggies.
 
If you get the timing right, you can give your guests a wonderful 
(and appropriately filling) experience at a fraction of the price 
you’d pay for a traditional sit-down meal — or even a buffet 
dinner. Of course, timing is key: You don’t want to serve only hors 
d’oeuvres when your guests expect a full meal. If you’ve set your 
heart on a 6 p.m. ceremony, you have to give your guests dinner 
afterwards. Chapter 12 provides everything you need to know 
about figuring out a food budget.
Avoiding expensive wedding dates
No matter what month in which you choose to get married, you 
may be competing with holidays, religious observances, and even 
sporting events — all of which can punch big holes in your budget. 
You may pay a hefty surcharge for opening a venue or using a 
vendor that’s normally closed on a secular or religious holiday, for 
example. In addition, travel arrangements may be more challeng-
ing and costly, and accommodations for out-of-town guests may be 
scarce and pricey.
 
Here are some dates you may want to avoid:
 
✓ Federal holidays: In addition to the expense of the following 
dates, the people you most want to share in your celebra-
tion may have other plans for popular travel holidays like 
Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day:
 
• New Year’s Day (January 1)
 
• Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (third Monday in January)
 
• President’s Day (third Monday in February)
 
• Memorial Day (last Monday in May)
 
• Independence Day (July 4)
 
• Labor Day (first Monday in September)
 
• Columbus Day (the Monday closest to October 12)
 
• Veteran’s Day (November 11)
 
• Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November)
 
• Christmas Day (December 25)

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
40
 
✓ Religious observances: The days and/or dates of these holi-
days change from year to year, so be sure to check the calen-
dar for the year you intend to get married:
 
• Ash Wednesday
 
• Christmas Day
 
• Christmas Eve
 
• Easter Sunday
 
• Good Friday
 
• Hanukkah
 
• Kwanzaa
 
• Muharram
 
• Orthodox Easter
 
• Palm Sunday
 
• Passover
 
• Ramadan
 
• Rosh Hashanah
 
• Tisha B’Av
 
• Yom Kippur
 
✓ Major sporting events: If you’re getting married in or near a 
city that’s hosting a big sporting event (or that has a team 
playing in the event), reception halls, hotel rooms, and cater-
ers may be hard to come by. Here are some of the biggest 
sporting events to be aware of:
 
• Super Bowl (late January/early February)
 
• NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament (March/April)
 
• NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs (May/June)
 
• NBA Championship (June)
 
• World Series (October/early November)
 
• College football bowls (November through January)
 
✓ Other observances: St. Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, and 
Father’s Day aren’t official holidays, but consider the poten-
tial problems before scheduling your wedding on one of these 
days. Flowers — especially red roses — are at their most 
expensive around Valentine’s Day, and florists are busy for 
both Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day. Plus, your guests may 
have other plans for these dates and may be less likely to 
attend.

 Chapter 3: Deciding When to Get Married and Organizing Your Timeline 41
Starting (And Finalizing) 
Your Guest List
The number of people you expect to have at your wedding is 
closely tied to both your budget (see Chapter 2) and the kind of 
locations you need for the ceremony and reception. To come up 
with a starting figure, make a list of guests that you, your spouse-
to-be, and both sets of parents want to invite, and then add 
another 10 to 20 slots for later additions. Use this number as your 
rough estimate to determine what size venues you need for the 
ceremony and reception. (Check out Chapter 2 for more on setting 
your guest limits and matching your venues with the number of 
guests you anticipate inviting.)
 
Unless you plan to have a small, intimate wedding, you’ll undoubt-
edly invite people who won’t attend. Most wedding experts put the 
no-show list at between 10 percent and 20 percent of your guest 
list. So you can plan to invite up to 120 people if you expect 100 
people to actually attend. However, make sure your budget and 
your location can accommodate everyone you invite in case they 
all decide to show up.
You don’t need to finalize your guest list until it’s time to send out 
the invitations, usually six to eight weeks before the wedding. You 
need an estimate for the caterer, and you have to provide a final 
head count the week before the wedding.
Reserving the Venue(s) Early 
to Cushion Your Budget
Popular wedding venues are booked a year or more in advance, 
so if you have your heart set on a particular site, book it as soon 
as possible and secure your reservation with a deposit. Shopping 
early also helps you lock in prices and may even net you discounts 
or extra services as an incentive for reserving the space. Also, the 
earlier you make your reservation, the more leeway you may have 
in the amount and terms of the deposit. Of course, you need to get 
all these terms in writing so misunderstandings and unpleasant 
surprises don’t spring up later on.
 
If you don’t have a year to plan, don’t panic: Just make finding and 
reserving a venue the first item on your to-do list. You may have to 
be more flexible with dates and times to get the venue you want, 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
42
but you could save money by choosing a less common wedding 
schedule (see the section “Understanding how dates and times 
affect prices” earlier in this chapter).
Locking in prices
Wedding prices don’t typically fluctuate dramatically, but inflation 
and other economic pressures can make waiting to reserve your 
venue a costly proposition. Today’s $15-a-person dinner may cost 
$17 per plate a few months from now. However, if you start early 
enough, you may be able to lock in today’s prices — even if your 
wedding is a year or more away.
If a venue’s prices aren’t guaranteed, ask to see a list of estimated 
prices for your wedding date. Most venues prepare estimated price 
lists a year in advance; even though they’re only estimates, they do 
give you a fairly solid idea of what your actual costs will be.
 
Get a written estimate for each venue you visit, and ask whether a 
deposit locks in the prices you’ve been quoted. If the venue has no 
price guarantee, ask whether it places a cap on any price increase; 
some venues offer a “not to exceed” limit on any increases between 
the time you book the site and the day of your wedding.
Exploring early-bird extras
Reception sites don’t make any money when they aren’t full of 
people partying, so site managers like their event calendars to be 
as full as possible as early as possible. This haste to book on the 
venue’s part can give you an edge in negotiating everything from 
deposits to extra services. For example, the manager may agree 
to waive the rental fee for table linens or centerpieces. Or she 
may offer a discount on the bar rate if you guarantee a minimum 
number of guests for the meal.
 
You can further strengthen your negotiating position by setting 
your wedding on a weekday, a Sunday afternoon, or a Saturday 
morning, when the site is less likely to be booked. Be sure to check 
out newly opened venues, too; they’re usually eager for business 
because they aren’t as well-known as established venues.
 
Generally, the closer you get to your wedding date, the less likely 
you are to score extras from the venue — unless, of course, your 
wedding is on a typically slow day for the site.

 Chapter 3: Deciding When to Get Married and Organizing Your Timeline 43
Wheeling and dealing: Negotiating 
your deposits
No matter what venue you choose, you’ll have to secure your 
reservation with a deposit. However, keep in mind that the site 
managers may allow some slack in the amount and terms of initial 
deposits if you book early. So, for example, you may be able to put 
down half the normal deposit now and pay the remainder in 30 or 
60 days — a great advantage if your cash flow is tight.
When you’re ready to reserve a site, get answers to these questions:
 
✓ How much is the deposit, and when does it have to be paid? 
Depending on the venue’s policies, you may be able to put a 
modest deposit down now if you agree to pay the rest of the 
normal deposit by a specified date. This kind of arrangement 
buys you time to investigate other venues and save up to pay 
the remaining deposit if you decide to stick with this venue. 
Just make sure you understand the refund policy on any 
deposit you make (see the next bullet).
 
✓ What’s the refund policy on deposits? Some sites refund 
your money if you cancel your reservation more than 90 days 
before your wedding; others pro-rate refunds depending on 
when you cancel; and still others don’t offer deposit refunds 
at all. Make sure you know the site’s policy before you make 
any payments. For example, if you aren’t ready to make a final 
decision on your venue, you don’t want to pay a nonrefund-
able deposit.
 
✓ Will the deposit be credited toward the final bill? Believe 
it or not, some sites treat deposits as additional income; the 
rationale is that your deposit pays for taking the site off the 
market, not for your event. You may be able to negotiate this 
policy, especially if you’re booking a normally slow day or 
time of year. If the site manager refuses to apply your deposit 
to your final bill, look for another venue.
 
✓ What payment methods do you accept? Nearly all recep-
tion sites accept major credit cards; churches and other 
ceremony sites may accept only cash or checks. How you pay 
is an important point to keep in mind as you work with your 
budget, because you need to know which items you need cash 
for and which you can charge to your (low-interest, reward-
offering) credit card.

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
44
Set it in stone: Getting your 
contract in writing
 
When you reserve a venue for either your ceremony or your recep-
tion, the items you’ve talked about with the site manager mean 
nothing unless they’re included in the reservation contract. Make 
sure your contract includes the following information:
 
✓ A description of your event, including times, setup informa-
tion, the number of people expected, and the location
 
✓ Gratuity and tax charges (as a percentage of the total bill)
 
✓ Deposit due dates and refund terms
 
✓ Due dates for information you need to supply, including the 
menu selections and the final head count
 
✓ A list of contingency fees, such as additional charges if your 
final head count falls below a certain number
 
✓ Any other terms or special instructions you’ve discussed with 
the site manager
Read the contract carefully and make sure you understand it 
before you sign it or hand over a deposit. The time to resolve ques-
tions or misunderstandings with the contract is before you clinch 
the deal; afterwards, you may just be stuck with whatever you get, 
and your budget may suffer for it.
Filling In Other Details on 
Your Planning Timeline
When you and your future spouse have agreed on your goals and 
priorities for your wedding (see Chapter 1), you can start filling in 
other important details in your plans — choosing your attendants, 
finding vendors, selecting your wedding attire, and making sure 
your union is legal.
The planning calendar in Appendix A provides guidelines on when 
you should start and finish various tasks for the typical 12-month 
planning timeline; all you have to do is plug in the appropriate 
dates for your wedding.
 
If you have less than a year to plan your wedding, just adjust your 
timeline to make sure first things come first. If you’re getting mar-
ried in 4 months, for example, first do the tasks in the “12 to 9 
Months in Advance” section and so on.

 Chapter 3: Deciding When to Get Married and Organizing Your Timeline 45
 
When you figure out your planning dates, mark them on a calendar 
or post the list of dates where you and your betrothed can refer to 
them easily.
A written timeline helps you stick to your budget in several ways. 
If you’re paying cash as you go, knowing when specific items have 
to be paid for helps you follow your savings plan. If you’re using a 
credit card, your timeline can help you estimate monthly charges, 
payments, and balances. Perhaps most important, keeping track 
of when your wedding-planning tasks need to be completed pre-
vents last-minute panic buying — and the overspending that often 
accompanies haste.
Building your wedding party
You probably already know who you want to stand up with you at 
your wedding. If not, you and your intended should discuss your 
attendants soon. Either way, after you and your soon-to-be spouse 
have decided on the wedding party, all that remains is to make the 
invitation official — and make sure your preferred attendants are 
available on your wedding day.
 
As you choose your attendants, keep in mind the costs associated 
with your wedding party (see Chapter 5). Immediately after your 
engagement, you may want every friend you can remember to 
stand up with you. However, your budget may tell you that you’re 
better off limiting your bridal party to a maid of honor and best 
man — or to not having a bridal party at all.
Enlisting the help of 
family and friends
The saying, “It’s not what you know — it’s who you know,” may be 
cynical when you’re talking about finding a job, but it’s an abso-
lute godsend when you’re planning a wedding, especially when 
funds are limited. Family members and friends represent a wealth 
of knowledge and skills that you can put to work for you in your 
quest to save money. For example, you may be able to elicit ideas 
that wouldn’t have occurred to you — everything from possible 
vendors and inexpensive shopping tips to alternatives that are fun 
and budget-friendly.
Family and friends may be able to do some of the wedding work, 
too — another way to cut down on expenses. Most people are 
happy to help with general planning and relatively minor tasks 
like addressing invitations or helping to put favors together. If 

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
46
you’re fortunate, however, you may have relatives or friends who 
have the necessary talents, interests, and time to save you a ton of 
money on major tasks.
 
Canvass family and friends early in your planning so you have a 
better idea of which vendors you can forego and which you need 
to line up (see the following section). Getting early commitments 
also helps you tweak your budget; for example, if your sister will 
make your bouquets and centerpieces, you don’t have to set 
money aside for a florist.
Here are a few things people in your circle may be able to do:
 
✓ Arrange bouquets and floral decorations
 
✓ Bake your wedding cake or other dessert
 
✓ Cater your reception
 
✓ Create customized invitations
 
✓ Make the alterations to your wedding attire
 
✓ Provide entertainment
 
✓ Take photos or video
Tell friends and family members you’d like to have their services in 
lieu of a traditional wedding gift. It’s a simple way to let them know 
how much you value their participation. If they want to give you a 
traditional gift anyway, that’s okay, but you’ve made it clear that 
you don’t expect one.
 
When you enlist a relative or friend to do something for your 
wedding, write a quick thank-you note saying how much you 
appreciate the help and look forward to the result. It’s more than 
a nice gesture; it serves as a polite reminder of the commitment 
they made to you and the success of your wedding day. (You 
need to write a second thank-you note, accompanied by a gift if 
appropriate, after the wedding, too.)
Lining up vendors before all 
the good ones are booked
You can eliminate a lot of wedding-planning stress by choosing 
your major vendors early in the process. By deciding on these ven-
dors early, you’ll know what they’ll cost and have plenty of time to 
make any necessary adjustments to your budget. You just might be 
able to score a discount by booking early as well. (Refer to the ear-
lier section “Exploring early-bird extras” for more on scoring some 
extra deals.)

 Chapter 3: Deciding When to Get Married and Organizing Your Timeline 47
 
If you get married during a popular wedding month, lining up ven-
dors early is even more important. The closer you get to your wed-
ding day, the more you risk your preferred vendors being booked. 
Your second or third choices may be substantially more expen-
sive, so clearly it pays to avoid procrastination.
Here are the vendors you need to line up as early as possible
 
✓ Caterer (see Chapter 12)
 
✓ DJ or band (see Chapter 13)
 
✓ Photographer and videographer (see Chapter 9)
You can wait to select a baker and a florist as long as your wedding 
doesn’t compete with busy times like graduation, St. Valentine’s 
Day, or Mother’s Day. (The planning calendar in Appendix A pro-
vides guidelines on when to book these vendors.)
Deciding whether to hire a planner
Most budget-minded couples don’t hire independent wedding 
planners, but if you and your spouse-to-be are pressed for time or 
overwhelmed by the thought of finding and interviewing individual 
vendors, you may decide the expense of a planner is worth the 
aggravation you’ll avoid. In general, the earlier you decide whether 
to hire a planner, the more value you get for your money.
 
Before you determine that you need a planner, though, find out 
whether your ceremony and reception venues have on-site wed-
ding coordinators, whose services likely won’t cost you anything. 
The following sections discuss what you can expect from on-site 
coordinators and independent wedding planners.
Taking advantage of an on-site coordinator
The on-site coordinator’s sole job is to ensure that everything goes 
smoothly for your ceremony or reception, and her services usually 
are included in the rental fee. She also can put you in touch with 
reputable vendors, saving you some legwork.
At most venues, an on-site coordinator will
 
✓ Meet with you (free of charge) to discuss ideas for your 
ceremony or reception
 
✓ Explain what the venue provides
 
✓ Help you plan a menu that fits your budget
 
✓ Arrange food tastings (you may pay a fee for this)

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
48
 
✓ Create a floor plan for your reception, or provide floor plan 
options you can choose from
 
✓ Provide a written cost estimate based on the size and scale of 
your wedding
 
✓ Explain deposit policies and payment schedules
 
✓ Oversee the setup for the ceremony or reception
 
Hotels and reception halls often have high turnover rates when it 
comes to their staff, so keep in mind that the on-site coordinator 
you meet with early in your wedding planning may move on by the 
time your wedding date arrives. In most cases, the transition to a 
new employee doesn’t present any problems; usually the venue 
management takes care to make sure all staff members are well-
trained and professional. However, at your initial meeting, you 
may want to ask the coordinator how your arrangements will be 
handled if she leaves her job.
 
If you’re worried about sounding rude when asking about this, say, 
“What if you move on to a better job between now and my wedding 
date?” The assumption that the coordinator would only go on to 
bigger and better things takes any sting out of the question.
Choosing an independent wedding planner
Independent wedding planners — who also call themselves bridal 
consultants or wedding coordinators — provide a full range of ser-
vices, from simple consultations to the arrangement of every detail 
of your wedding and reception.
The service you get from a planner depends on what kind of plan-
ner you hire. Consider which of these three types of planners may 
be the best fit for you:
 
✓ A planner who offers one-time-only initial consultations: 
This type of planner helps you establish your budget and 
timeline and gives you tips for working with vendors. He also 
may offer referrals to vendors in the area. These consultants 
typically charge on an hourly or per-meeting basis, so it’s 
pretty easy to keep costs under control.
 
✓ A planner who offers partial planning: These planners usu-
ally come into the picture a couple weeks before the wedding 
and make sure all the details are finalized. Some only come 
in for the rehearsal and the wedding itself to make sure the 
festivities run smoothly. Partial planning services typically are 
billed either by the hour or on a flat-fee basis that includes a 
set number of hours.

 Chapter 3: Deciding When to Get Married and Organizing Your Timeline 49
 
✓ A full-service planner who offers beginning-to-end service: 
This type of planner will get to know you, your tastes, and 
your needs, and he’ll help you craft a budget and timeline. 
He’ll make recommendations for food and drink, help you 
choose flowers and decorations that suit your budget and 
style, and organize the theme, colors, and other details you 
choose. He has connections with a broad range of vendors 
and can help you find ones that fit your budget.
 
 Full-service planners are the most expensive of the three 
options. They usually charge between 10 percent and 20 per-
cent of your total wedding budget. Some won’t even commit 
to weddings with budgets of less than $25,000.
 
Theoretically, a wedding planner’s job is to get you the best deal 
with other vendors so you can have the wedding of your dreams 
while staying on budget. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always work that 
way in practice. The “recommended” vendors a wedding planner 
deals with often pay fees to the planner to get on his list. Even if 
the planner offers a referral as a “free” service to you, chances are 
the vendor pays the planner a commission — which, naturally, is 
passed on to you in the vendor’s bill.
 
To avoid the shady side of the wedding planning business, look 
for a planner who either is a member of the Association of Bridal 
Consultants or who follows the association’s code of ethics. The 
code requires planners to disclose any referral fees before clients 
sign a contract; most association members don’t take referral fees 
from vendors. Use the search function on the ABC Web site (www.
bridalassn.com) to find member planners in your area.
Ordering wedding attire so you 
have plenty of time to spare
If you and your betrothed are planning to wear traditional wedding 
attire, including a gown and tuxedo or suit, start your search early. 
For the perfect gown, start looking six to eight months before your 
wedding. This timeframe ensures that you have enough time to 
shop, order, and have alterations made without rushing. After all, 
you’re sure to pay a premium for rush orders, and alterations can 
take weeks, depending on how extensive they are. (If you have 
less than a year to plan your wedding, see Chapter 6 for other, less 
time-consuming attire options.)
If you intend to find your gown at a discount bridal shop, a con-
signment store, or online through sites like eBay, you can delay 
starting your search a little longer. However, be sure that you 
leave enough time for shipping and alterations if necessary.

Part I: Coming Up with a Game Plan  
50
It hardly seems fair, but finding the groom’s attire is less compli-
cated and generally requires less time. For a 12-month planning 
timeline, you can start looking for a tuxedo (either to rent or pur-
chase) or suit about 3 months before your wedding; that leaves 
plenty of time for measurements and alterations. If your timeline is 
shorter, I recommend starting your search no later than a month 
in advance, if possible. I say this because rental places and tailors 
may be booked.
Make it legal: Taking care 
of your marriage license
Depending on where you live, getting your marriage license may be 
one of the last things on your list. In many states, licenses are only 
valid for 30 to 60 days, so you don’t want to get yours until you’re 
much closer to your wedding date.
However, for planning and budgeting purposes, call the county 
clerk or marriage bureau to find out how much the fee is, how 
long the license is valid, and whether you have to fulfill any other 
requirements, such as blood tests, waiting periods, residency, or 
proof of divorce (in the case of a previous marriage).
Here’s another reason to call your county marriage bureau early 
on in the process: In many states, marriage licenses are issued in 
the county in which the wedding takes place, regardless of whether 
the couple lives in that county. Other states allow their county 
governments to issue licenses that are valid anywhere in the state.

Part II
Planning the 
Ceremony

In this part...
T
he ceremony is the heart of any wedding celebration. 
Everything about it — your venue, your wedding 
party, your wardrobe, the music and readings you select, 
and even the wording of your vows — speaks symbolically 
or literally of your attitudes, hopes, and expectations for 
your marriage. And most of it affects your wallet.
In this part, you can read about each aspect of planning 
your budget-friendly ceremony: selecting a site, deciding 
on your wedding party, choosing attire that suits your 
taste and budget, and fi guring out the details of music and 
décor. Also in this part are chapters on fl owers, photogra-
phy, and printing — all of which are major expenses for 
most marrying couples — and information on how to keep 
costs down without sacrifi cing your priorities.

D
eciding where to exchange their vows challenges lots of 
couples. For some, the question is a matter of religious 
beliefs. Interfaith ceremonies, for example, often require extra 
coordination and meetings with the couples’ respective clergy 
members. And when one half of the couple has strong ties to a 
particular church and the other doesn’t, that can raise planning 
issues as well. When neither of you belongs to a church, the mere 
range of ceremony site options can induce a sort of wedding-
planning paralysis.
In many ways, the site you and your spouse-to-be choose sets the 
tone for your entire wedding day, reflecting your attitudes and 
beliefs about marriage as well as your tastes, personalities, and 
sense of style.
The site also affects your pocketbook; after all, no matter where 
you get married, you’ll fork over at least a little cash. The trick is 
finding a site that offers the atmosphere you want at a price you’re 
willing (and able) to pay. In this chapter, I cover the most common 
and some not-so-common wedding venues, explaining the usual 
costs associated with each and the extra expenses you may have 
to budget for.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
54
 
You can save money by having your ceremony and reception at 
the same location. I cover reception site selection in Chapter 11 on 
the assumption that you want to hold your ceremony in one place 
and your reception in another (as most couples do). But the ben-
efits of having the ceremony and reception at the same location 
include the following:
 
✓ You don’t have to worry about transportation between sites.
 
✓ You can cut back on your decorations budget.
 
✓ You may save money on rental fees.
Beginning the Search for 
the Perfect Location
For many couples, the ceremony location is a given; they’ve always 
wanted to be married in their place of worship. However, if you 
and your betrothed haven’t already chosen a ceremony site, your 
first task is to decide where you want to exchange your vows. No 
matter which kind of venue you want, you need to investigate avail-
ability, costs, and any restrictions that may affect your ceremony.
Unfortunately, it’s easy to lose track of which venues offer what 
amenities. I’ve created a list of questions that can help you stay 
organized — and avoid unpleasant financial shocks. Ask these 
questions of each venue you consider:
 
✓ What hours are available for a wedding?
 
✓ Is the site available for a rehearsal? When, and for how long?
 
✓ What does the rental fee include?
 
✓ What is not included in the rental fee?
 
✓ Do you offer any packages or discounts?
 
✓ Do you require a deposit? How much, and when is it due?
 
✓ When is the balance due?
 
✓ What’s your refund policy on deposits?
 
✓ Do you have an on-site coordinator to help plan and execute 
the ceremony?
 
✓ Do you have any restrictions on bringing in outside vendors?
 
✓ How much parking is available?
 
✓ Do you have restrooms, trash receptacles, and electrical 
service for the ceremony?

 Chapter 4: Deciding Where to Get Married 55
 
✓ Will you provide a written estimate and contract?
 
✓ Is there a cancellation clause in the contract?
 
Always, always, always get the rental terms in writing, and make a 
note of any verbal agreements you reach with the site manager or 
representative. If a venue won’t provide a written estimate, look 
elsewhere for your ceremony site.
Choosing an Indoor Location
Even though lots of couples choose to exchange vows in parks, 
gardens, and other outdoor settings, indoor ceremony sites remain 
the most popular choice — mainly because most couples get mar-
ried in churches, temples, or other places of worship.
Staying indoors has practical advantages, too. For one, you don’t 
have to worry about rain or wind ruining your ceremony. You 
also run less risk of having to swat away a mosquito or bee in the 
middle of your vows. And you can keep your guests comfortable 
with heat or air conditioning.
Of course, you aren’t limited to a church ceremony if you decide 
on an indoor venue. Many hotels, reception halls, museums, and 
historic sites also are equipped to host charming nuptials. In this 
section, I tell you about places of worship and reception halls. (See 
the later section “Holding to your budget at historic places and 
civic sites” for more about museums and similar indoor sites.)
Going to the chapel
Most couples have their ceremonies in churches or other places of 
worship, and then they move to banquet halls for their receptions. 
But great church weddings don’t just happen (for convenience, I 
use the term “church” here, but the advice applies to any place of 
worship). Like every other aspect of your wedding planning, you 
need to select a church that’s a good fit for you — in terms of both 
the ceremony and the cost.
 
If you and your betrothed have decided to get married in your 
home church, obviously you don’t need to go shopping for a cer-
emony site. However, you do need to budget for the expenses of 
using the church — and any extra costs. Check out the list in the 
later section “Gathering some basic information” for guidance on 
what you need to know. Then use the answers you gather to make 
any necessary adjustments to the rest of your wedding budget.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
56
If you aren’t a member of a church, or if you and your betrothed 
are members of different churches, finding a religious site for your 
ceremony can be a challenge. Here are some of the rules you may 
come across:
 
✓ Some churches don’t permit interfaith ceremonies.
 
✓ Some require that either the bride or groom be a member.
 
✓ Some insist that both the bride and the groom be members.
 
✓ Some allow weddings for members’ children but don’t require 
the marrying couple to join.
The bottom line is this: If you have no affiliation with a particular 
church, synagogue, or mosque, chances are you won’t be able to 
have your wedding there unless you’re willing to join the congre-
gation. The main exception is the Unitarian Universalist Church, 
which welcomes a wide range of spiritual and religious beliefs. 
This church often opens its facilities to nonmembers who wish to 
be married there.
 
You also may want to check out chapels at local colleges or uni-
versities; they usually have less strict membership requirements 
and often are quite inexpensive to rent, especially if you or your 
intended (or any of your parents) attended the school.
Gathering some basic information
Before you book a church, you need some basic information. Ask 
about the following items before putting any money down:
 
✓ Size: Determine whether the church is the right size for your 
guest list. Fifty guests can look like a puny crowd in a vast 
cathedral, for example, and 100 guests will be cramped in a 
space built to hold 75.
 
✓ Availability: Ask whether the church is available at the 
time you want on the date you want and whether any other 
functions are scheduled for that day. If so, find out how 
this will affect your ceremony. Check availability for your 
rehearsal, too.
 
✓ Religious requirements: Find out whether the church 
requires that both of you become members or that only one 
of you converts to the church’s denomination. Ask whether 
you must go through premarital counseling as well. If so, only 
you and your fiancé(e) can determine whether you’re willing 
to meet those requirements.
 
✓ Ceremony restrictions: Some churches limit your ability to 
personalize your service, in many cases by prohibiting secular 
music and readings or by offering only a standard ceremony. 

 Chapter 4: Deciding Where to Get Married 57
Some require you to use their organist, which may limit your 
music selection. Others have restrictions on photography and 
videography.
 
 Some churches also have rules regarding attire. They may 
forbid bare arms and legs, for example. If the church you 
choose has such rules, you may have to invest in a bridal 
jacket or wrap to wear during your ceremony. (Check out 
Chapter 6 for more on “temple-ready” wedding gowns.)
 
✓ Included services: Some churches offer pew decorations, 
aisle runners, and even the use of altar decorations. However, 
you may be slapped with an additional fee, so be sure to ask 
whether these things are included in the rental fee.
 
✓ Extra services: Some churches charge a cleaning fee, which 
may be refunded if you take charge of cleaning up after the 
ceremony. Other services like parking and coat check may 
cost extra, too.
When you’ve gathered the info you need, you and your spouse-to-
be may need to discuss the pros and cons of each church you’ve 
researched. Depending on your priorities, you may decide that 
the answers to some of the preceding questions are deal-breakers; 
others may fall under the category of “the cost of doing business” 
with the church you prefer. As always, only you and your intended 
can decide what matters and what doesn’t.
Understanding typical costs
According to the Bridal Association of America, the average rental 
cost for a church runs between $400 and $450. Churches in large 
cities typically charge more, and some churches charge around 
$1,000 for a wedding. Depending on the site, that price may include 
the officiant’s fee and a refundable cleaning deposit. The cost will 
likely include rental of the church for three to five hours for the 
ceremony itself (to allow for setup time) and a rehearsal, which 
usually is held the evening before the wedding.
Some churches offer wedding packages that include the services 
of the officiant and organist as well as decorations. Prices vary 
widely — depending on the church and region — from around 
$600 on the low end to $2,000 or more on the high end.
 
Even with a package deal, you still may run into extra fees. 
Decorations may not include altar flowers or an aisle runner, for 
example. If you want to use a unity candle or chuppa (a wedding 
canopy) in your ceremony, you’ll pay extra. And you may incur an 
extra charge if you want the church bells to ring at the conclusion 
of your ceremony.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
58
You may get a substantial discount if you, your intended, or 
your parents are church members. Many churches charge only a 
nominal rental fee — mainly to cover clean-up — for members. Of 
course, an additional donation to the church is always welcome 
(and sometimes expected).
 
Places of worship book up fast, so start your search early to 
ensure that you get the date and time you want. You may have to 
pay a deposit — usually around $200 — so be sure to ask about 
refund policies.
Saying “I do” in a reception hall
Holding your ceremony in a reception hall provides budget-
conscious couples several advantages, including the following:
 
✓ You typically pay one rental fee for both the ceremony and 
reception.
 
✓ You don’t have to worry about transporting the wedding 
party or guests between ceremony and reception venues.
 
✓ You can hire the officiant you want (and thus personalize 
your ceremony as much as you like).
 
✓ You don’t have to pay for decorations for multiple sites.
Unfortunately, reception halls have their disadvantages, too.
 
✓ You may not be able to choose your caterer or bring in your 
own alcohol.
 
✓ You may find room turning — changing the setup from cere-
mony to reception — to be awkward for you and your guests.
 
✓ Deposits often are nonrefundable or only partially refundable.
 
✓ You may pay the same amount in mandatory gratuities and 
other miscellaneous charges that you would for a church 
rental fee.
Turn to Chapter 11 for more on vetting and selecting reception 
sites.
Exchanging Vows Outdoors
Outdoor ceremonies are lovely and can be extremely cost-effective — 
or they can cause frustration and empty your wallet. On the one 
hand, you can keep decoration expenses to a minimum, because 

 Chapter 4: Deciding Where to Get Married 59
nature provides your designer backdrop. On the other hand, 
nature can be a heartless practical joker, leaving you and your 
guests uncomfortable and disappointed. And it costs money — 
sometimes a lot of it — to guard against the unpredictable tricks 
of nature.
 
Outdoor ceremonies (and receptions, for that matter) require 
special amenities that you take for granted in an indoor site. In 
fact, the issues and challenges for any outdoor location are simi-
lar to those for a home wedding. (See the later section “Backyard 
Nuptials: Getting Married at Home.”)
Among other things, you may have to provide the following items 
for your outdoor fete:
 
✓ Level walkways and seating areas
 
✓ Pest control
 
✓ Power supply
 
✓ Restroom facilities
 
✓ Site clean-up
 
✓ Tents
 
✓ Trash cans
 
A large tent (or multiple smaller ones) is an absolute must if you 
don’t have an adjacent indoor facility you can use if your wedding 
day turns out to be miserable weatherwise. And keep in mind that 
the tent is likely to be your biggest expense.
The following sections discuss some outdoor options that won’t 
break the bank as well as special preparations you need to con-
sider for an outdoor ceremony.
Reviewing some inexpensive 
outdoor options
The cost of renting some outdoor sites can rival the fanciest recep-
tion hall in town. But there are plenty of affordable options, too. 
Because rates, restrictions, and policies differ greatly from site to 
site, you need to do some research to find out whether a particular 
location suits your needs.
Public parks usually offer the lowest rental rates — sometimes as 
low as $25, which may be refundable if you clean up afterwards. 
And many parks have pavilions or enclosed spaces so you can 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
60
shelter yourselves and your guests from the elements. Rates vary 
depending on the season and day of the week, so do your home-
work before selecting a site.
Check out these sources for ideas and information about reserva-
tion policies and rates:
 
✓ Your local parks and recreation department for municipal 
parks, gardens, and other facilities
 
✓ Your state parks department for properties owned by the 
state
 
✓ The administrative office of any National Park Service sites 
you may be interested in
 
 Many national parks allow wedding ceremonies, but most 
require permits and nonrefundable deposits. Policies and 
procedures vary from park to park, too, so be sure to call the 
specific site to get current information.
 
✓ Your local convention or visitor’s bureau, which is useful for 
information about private and not-for-profit sites
 
✓ Any local historic sites, which often offer their grounds and 
gardens for weddings
 
✓ Libraries, community theaters, and museums
 
When you call site offices, ask whether they have any permit 
requirements (and the fees associated with permits). Be sure to 
ask about restrictions, too, such as noise limits, maximum number 
of people, and “clearing out” times. Some sites charge clean-up 
fees, and some charge extra if you want to reserve the site for a 
rehearsal. Finally, be sure to ask about restroom and parking 
facilities; you don’t want the unexpected expense of arranging 
transportation or portable toilets for your guests.
Considering the climate
Rain isn’t the only thing you have to worry about on your wedding 
day. A blistering hot sun can suck the joy right out of the day, too. 
And wind can wreak havoc with clothing, hairdos, decorations, and 
table settings. Tents and park pavilions provide shade, and a tent 
with side panels can mitigate the effects of a too-lively breeze.
In the following sections, I tell you how to best outsmart Mother 
Nature with tents, other covers, and sources of heating and 
cooling.

 Chapter 4: Deciding Where to Get Married 61
Renting tents
The easiest way to provide cover for your ceremony (assuming 
the site doesn’t have a pavilion or other shelter) is to rent a tent. 
You can get side panels for any tent style; these can be rolled up 
to allow for greater air circulation in good weather, or lowered to 
provide protection from wind, rain, and cold.
 
Depending on the size and amenities of the tents you’re 
considering — such as heating or air conditioning, temporary 
flooring, and so on — tent rental can cost you anywhere from 
around $300 to $10,000 and up.
The following list includes four tent styles you can choose from:
 
✓ Frame tents: Frame tents (also known as clear-span frame 
tents) require minimal staking, so they work well over asphalt 
and other hard surfaces. These tents have no center poles, so 
they offer a clear span beneath the canopy.
 
✓ Pole tents: Pole tents have stakes and tension lines at every 
perimeter pole, so they’re a poor choice for driveways, patios, 
and other hard surfaces. In addition, the stakes and tension 
lines can present a safety hazard, especially at night; you may 
want to decorate them with balloons or strings of miniature 
lights so guests don’t trip over them. The canopy is supported 
with four corner poles, two or more center poles, and smaller 
poles on each side.
 
✓ Century tents: Century tents are identifiable by the peaks in 
their roofs. They can be erected over either frame or pole 
setups. Because of their more elegant silhouette, they’re a 
popular choice for weddings and other celebrations.
 
✓ Pop-up canopies: Pop-up canopies are smaller — usually 10 
feet by 10 feet or 12 feet by 12 feet — so you’ll probably need 
several unless your guest list is short. They also usually don’t 
come with side panels — and it can be inconvenient to impro-
vise side panels.
 
 This style of tent is much cheaper than heavy canvas party 
tents, and you can hit up friends and relatives to borrow any 
they have. If the tents you gather are different colors, you 
can color-code your ceremony and reception: exchange vows 
under the white canopy, place the gift table and guest book 
under the blue canopy, serve food under the green canopy, 
and set out drinks under the red canopy.
 
Ask friends and family if they know anyone who has a large party 
tent. If it’s in good shape, you may be able to borrow it for your 
wedding, or the person may allow you to rent it for significantly 
less than a rental company charges.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
62
Looking at other shelter options
If tents don’t turn you on, or if their cost doesn’t fit your budget, 
look for venues that provide shelter. Pavilion rentals at local or 
state parks usually are quite reasonable — sometimes as low as 
$50 for the day — and you may get your money back if you clean 
up the site after your wedding. If you want a more elegant outdoor 
feel, some parks and gardens also have gazebos for rent.
 
The main disadvantage to pavilions and gazebos is that the sides 
are open, affording minimal protection in a shower accompanied 
by winds and none at all against gusty breezes. They also can get 
crowded quickly; some are built to accommodate only one or two 
dozen people.
 
Look for an outdoor site with indoor facilities you can use in case 
of bad weather. That way, you don’t have to rent tents. (However, 
keep in mind that you may need to rent chairs and other furnish-
ings for the ceremony — and tables if you combine your ceremony 
and reception in one location.)
Taking heating and air conditioning into account
Sided tents are relatively easy to heat (assuming you aren’t getting 
married in the Alps in January) with gas or electric heaters. Air 
conditioning is less effective; you’ll suck up a lot of power for only 
moderate relief from heat and humidity. Of course, to use electric 
heat, air conditioning, and fans, you need a power source — either 
a generator (which can be extremely noisy) or nearby electricity 
and heavy-duty extension cords.
 
Cords can present a safety hazard, so make sure they’re secured 
under cord covers, flooring, or even duct tape.
On a hot day, help guests stay cool by crafting your ceremony pro-
grams into hand-held fans (which can double as favors and save 
you money). If your budget allows, also hand out ice-cold bottled 
water as guests enter your ceremony area.
Backyard Nuptials: Getting 
Married at Home
Many home weddings are a combination of indoor and outdoor 
functions, and they’re appealing for several reasons:
 
✓ You save on deposits and site rental fees.
 
✓ You won’t have any problems with conflicting events.

 Chapter 4: Deciding Where to Get Married 63
 
✓ You can freely enlist the help of family and friends.
 
✓ You get an intimate ambience that’s difficult to replicate 
elsewhere.
 
If having your entire wedding day at home sounds like too much 
work (or too much money), you can follow the example of many 
couples who looked into home weddings: Have only your cer-
emony at home, with the guest list limited to immediate family and 
one or two close friends (who may serve as attendants). Then you 
can have your reception at another location where things like rest-
rooms, tables and chairs, electricity, parking, and shelter from the 
elements are all included in the rental price.
 
Costs for a home wedding can quickly hit the stratosphere. Unless 
you live in a mansion with a full complement of maintenance, gar-
dening, cleaning, and cooking help, you’ll likely have to fork over 
some significant cash to get your home — or the home you want to 
use — in shape to handle a wedding.
Here are some potential costs to think about:
 
✓ Exterior maintenance: You don’t want your guests’ first sight 
to be of peeling paint, crumbling steps, or a sagging front 
porch. Take an honest look at the home’s facade and figure 
out whether any repairs need to be made before the wedding. 
If the home needs extensive repairs, it probably isn’t a good 
choice for a budget-friendly wedding.
 
✓ Facilities: That half bath on the ground floor of your home 
can handle only so many visitors, so you may have to rent 
portable toilets to accommodate your guests. Usually you 
need one for every 50 guests; more if you plan to party all day 
long and into the night. And if you have a septic system, you 
may have to pay someone to empty the tank before your 
wedding.
 
✓ Interior cleaning and maintenance: Cleaning before the wed-
ding (and after) is an absolute must, and if you don’t have the 
time or inclination to do it yourself, you’ll have to pay some-
one to do it for you. You also may need to do some interior 
repairs, such as fix torn wallpaper or get rid of the bump in 
the living room carpet that you automatically step over but 
that could seriously trip up your guests.
 
✓ Lawn care, landscaping, and terrain: At the very least, you 
have to make sure the lawn is mowed several days before the 
wedding. Don’t cut it any closer to the date than that, how-
ever, because freshly cut grass can stain shoes (especially 
pretty white wedding shoes!). Shrubs, bushes, and even trees 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony

may need trimming, and flower beds may need weeding. And 
if your yard is rocky or uneven, or if it has poor drainage, it 
may not work well for a wedding. You don’t want guests to 
sprain their ankles, and you certainly don’t want to wade 
through standing rainwater on your way to the altar.
 
✓ Parking: If you don’t have enough parking on your street, you 
may need to provide a shuttle bus between your home and 
a central parking location. Buses can cost $400 or more per 
hour, and you may need to get permission — and pay a fee — 
for your guests to use a parking lot.
 
✓ Power supply: You may need to rent a generator to power 
commercial-grade appliances like coffee urns or to provide 
power for lights, music, and a loudspeaker or microphone 
system.
 
✓ Tables and chairs: You may have to rent tables for the guest 
book and gifts and chairs for your guests — and that can get 
pricey quickly. Some tent rental companies provide tables 
and chairs (for a fee, of course). The setup and tear-down ser-
vice may cost extra.
 
 Some caterers provide tables and chairs, and their prices 
may be better than a tent rental company’s. Also check out 
local churches, fraternal organizations like the Elks Club or 
American Legion, and even libraries and fire departments; 
they may rent tables and chairs for even lower fees. Ask 
around and get quotes before you place your order.
 
✓ Tent rental: Backyard ceremonies can be lovely when the 
weather cooperates; but, of course, it doesn’t always behave. 
So, if your home isn’t large enough to accommodate your 
guests in case of rain, wind, or uncomfortable temperatures, 
you need to rent a tent to provide some protection from the 
elements.
 
 You’ll likely want to rent a tent for a couple of days. That 
way you can use the tent for your rehearsal and any day-
after gatherings (see Chapter 14). Refer to the earlier section 
“Considering the climate” for more information on tent rental.
 
✓ Trash removal: You may have to schedule an extra garbage 
pick-up or pay for your service to take away the extra trash 
that your wedding generates.
 
You may be wondering how you can have the home wedding you 
want without taking out a second mortgage. Just remember that it 
can be done, but it takes planning, preparation, and legwork. Shop 
around for the best deals on anything you have to rent. Ask for 
discounts if you rent multiple items from the same outfit (such as 

 Chapter 4: Deciding Where to Get Married 65
tables and chairs from the tent rental company). Last but not least, 
enlist family and friends to help with some of the prep chores, and 
pick their brains for vendor referrals.
Saving Money with Destination 
Weddings
To most people, having a destination wedding means going to 
Mexico or the Caribbean. These are certainly popular options 
(especially for people looking to escape the dreariness of winter), 
but you can have a destination wedding virtually anywhere. 
Consider a Great Camp in the Adirondacks, a ski lodge in Aspen, a 
golf resort in Arizona, or even a glitzy Vegas wedding.
What’s the appeal of traveling long distances to a site you’ll likely 
book without ever visiting in person and trusting the arrangements 
to a coordinator you’ve never met? Two words: romance and 
value. What better way to celebrate your own personal fairy tale 
than against the exotic backdrop of majestic mountains or azure 
seas? And if you can get both your wedding and your honeymoon 
for the price of one, what’s not to like?
 
Destination weddings sound great, but because we don’t live in 
the ideal world portrayed by fairy tales and bridal magazines, you 
have to remember that there are trade-offs to a romantic and cost-
effective destination wedding. Consider the following:
 
✓ Financial and time constraints likely will severely curtail your 
guest list; many of your friends and relatives simply won’t 
have the money or time to attend your wedding.
 
✓ If you like to be in charge of arrangements, trying to pull all 
the details together from hundreds or thousands of miles 
away can be frustrating and time-consuming.
 
✓ If you imagine hosting an American-style wedding and recep-
tion in a foreign country, you’ll probably be disappointed in 
the results (or appalled at the extra expense).
 
Destination Weddings For Dummies by Susan Breslow Sardone 
(Wiley) takes you step by step through planning a destination 
wedding virtually anywhere in the world on virtually any budget. 
Like any wedding, a destination event can easily run into the tens 
of thousands of dollars. But, also like any wedding, you can save 
a ton of money by shopping around and being flexible with your 
time frame.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
66
Also check out Chapter 15; much of the information about honey-
moon travel applies to planning a destination wedding, too. And if 
you want to have a small ceremony in an exotic locale and then a 
bigger celebration back home, flip to Chapter 14 for more informa-
tion on celebrating with friends and family who can’t attend your 
wedding.
 
As destination weddings become more popular, venues fill up 
faster and faster; many are booked more than a year in advance. 
To get the venue you want for the dates you want, start your 
search early — ideally 12 to 18 months before your wedding.
If you have your heart set on a destination that fills up quickly and 
is more expensive than you’d like, schedule your wedding for the 
off-season to save money. For example, airfares and hotel rates are 
at their highest in the Caribbean from November to April, but both 
often are steeply discounted after April 15. In Las Vegas, March 
and October are the months when conventions descend on Sin 
City, jacking up airfares and hotel rates. Chapter 15 has more infor-
mation on off-seasons for various locations.
 
Resorts and cruises that specialize in destination weddings often 
give decent discounts when you reserve a minimum number of 
rooms for your guests. Add those discounts to the destination’s 
slow period, and you can reap significant savings over high-season 
prices.
Off the Beaten Path: Exploring 
Nontraditional Sites
Nontraditional ceremony sites are popular with couples who like 
to take the unbeaten path or who aren’t particularly religious or 
members of a specific church or other place of worship.
 
As always, the key is matching your tastes with your budget. The 
options covered here — boats, castles, and historic sites — won’t 
fit every budget, every style, or every vision. But they may get 
your own creative juices flowing as you decide what you want 
your wedding to look like.
Ahoy, mate: Finding deals 
onboard boats
If you live near a lake or river of any size, chances are you’ll easily 
find an outfit that offers dinner cruises — and wedding packages. 

 Chapter 4: Deciding Where to Get Married 67
Costs can run $50 per person or more, but that often is an all-inclu-
sive price that covers food, drinks, the ceremony, and, of course, 
the cruise itself. And what could be more fun than having a boat 
captain officiate your wedding?
For couples on a budget, boat-based weddings offer a number of 
advantages:
 
✓ You can’t go over your budget by inviting too many people, 
because boats have strict capacity limits (and reputable boat-
ing companies carefully adhere to these limits).
 
✓ You have a slim chance of being socked with overtime charges, 
because the boat returns to its dock on a preset schedule, forc-
ing the closure of the bar and the disembarkation of guests.
 
✓ You don’t have to worry about shuttling guests between dif-
ferent ceremony and reception sites. In fact, if your guests’ 
hotel offers a shuttle service, you may even be able to arrange 
free or discounted shuttle service to and from the dock.
 
✓ Your decoration budget won’t explode. There simply isn’t 
enough room on most dinner-cruise boats for extravagant 
decorations. Depending on how crowded the table settings 
are, you may not even have room for centerpieces.
 
As with any other venue, you’re more likely to get a price break if 
you book your wedding for an off-peak time. This may mean a mid-
week sailing rather than Saturday at sunset.
Keeping costs down at castles
What better place for your fairy-tale wedding than a genuine 
castle? And don’t think you have to travel to Europe to get that 
authentic Old-World, regal atmosphere. North America is dotted 
with impressive castles, many of which make weddings their 
specialty.
Of course, costs at castles can be over the top. But you have plenty 
of reasonably priced options, too. Research a variety of castle 
options around the world at Love Tripper (www.lovetripper.
com/castle-weddings/castle-weddingvenues.html).
Holding to your budget at historic 
places and civic sites
Many exquisite historic and civic buildings are owned by govern-
ments or nonprofit groups, so their rental fees tend to be quite 
reasonable — even as low as $25 per hour in some cases. Some 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
68
have facilities to host both your ceremony and reception; however, 
you may be limited in the kind of food and drink you can bring in. 
Possible venues include libraries, museums, art galleries, and even 
stately government buildings.
Check with your local chamber of commerce or visitor’s bureau; 
these agencies can put you in touch with historic sites that host 
weddings and other functions. They may even recommend certain 
sites based on your needs.
Going Even Further From 
the Beaten Path
Regardless of what your families may tell you, you can get mar-
ried practically anywhere. Couples have exchanged vows in group 
skydives, at fast-food joints, on roller coasters, and in bowling 
alleys, carwashes, and movie theaters. These are what I call “AP 
weddings” — they involve sites and themes so unusual that they’re 
reported by the Associated Press and carried by news organiza-
tions all over the world.
The cool thing about an AP wedding is the freedom you have to 
express your individuality. You can integrate any traditional ele-
ments you want, toss the ones that don’t matter to you, and wrap 
the whole thing up in something intensely personal — a shared 
hobby, a favorite hang-out, or a passion for a particular movie. 
Even cooler is the fact that these offbeat options often cost a frac-
tion of traditional weddings. Imagine having the wedding of your 
dreams for $2,000 instead of $20,000!

Minimizing Wedding 
Party Costs
In This Chapter
▶ Budgeting for your attendants
▶ Selecting attendant attire and accessories
▶ Grooming for the big day
▶ Giving great gifts you can afford
B
ack in the day (and I mean way back — 1,000 years ago or 
more), the purpose of bridesmaids and groomsmen was to 
confuse ex-lovers and evil spirits who may have wanted to harm 
the bride and groom. The wedding party was instructed to wear 
outfits similar to those of the marrying couple so that malevolent 
mortals or spirits wouldn’t know who to attack. Unless you feel evil 
spirits are likely to be lurking in the shadows on your wedding day, 
you don’t really need to have attendants. In fact, many couples on 
tight budgets choose to forgo the traditional wedding party to save 
money.
Most couples don’t think of the costs involved in gathering a group 
of attendants — partly because, in many cases, the attendants pay 
for their own attire. But attire isn’t the only expense. In addition 
to pampering and thank-you gifts, you have to include your atten-
dants in your head counts for the rehearsal dinner and reception. 
And chances are that each of your attendants will bring a date, 
which adds more folks to your guest list. See Chapter 14 for details 
on the rehearsal dinner; for now, though, be sure to budget enough 
money to feed your wedding party and their dates the evening 
before your wedding.
You also may have to provide attendant bouquets and bouton-
nieres (see Chapter 8 for info on flowers and alternatives) and 
arrange transportation between the ceremony and reception sites, 
which may mean a bigger (or extra) limo or rental car. And you 
may incur other expenses, such as a wedding party brunch.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
70
 
I’m not telling you all this to talk you out of having attendants. Just 
remember that when it comes to weddings, nothing — including 
having your best friends stand up with you — is truly cost free. 
If having attendants is important to you, include these expenses 
in your budget and trim costs in other areas if necessary. In this 
chapter, I show you how attendants affect your budget and how 
you can minimize these expenses without sacrificing style or 
etiquette.
Choosing Members of 
Your Wedding Party
In the post-engagement glow, you naturally want to share your joy 
with everyone. If you decide to gather a wedding party, you may 
even be tempted to include the minor branches of your family tree 
in it. Curb that impulse, though. It could easily throw your budget 
seriously out of whack, and skew your wedding dreams to boot.
 
Even though the maid of honor and best man traditionally serve 
as witnesses on the marriage license, you can designate anyone 
you like to fulfill that duty. If you opt not to have attendants in 
order to save money, ask your nearest and dearest to be witnesses 
so they still feel included. In fact, in ancient times, everyone who 
attended a wedding was a witness, and each person had to sign in 
when arriving at the ceremony; this is the origin of the wedding 
guest book.
Calculating the number of 
bridesmaids and groomsmen
When deciding how many attendants you should have, take a look 
at the size of your wedding. For a small ceremony — 50 guests or 
fewer — many couples choose to have only a maid of honor and a 
best man. But you could have two attendants each without looking 
out of balance with your guest list.
For mid-sized weddings — more than 50 guests, but fewer than 
200 — you can have between one and six attendants each, with the 
number of attendants increasing as your guest list increases. Large 
and formal weddings (more than 200 guests) often have ten or 
more bridesmaids and groomsmen, plus additional ushers.
Groomsmen often double as ushers, and the general rule of thumb 
is to have one usher for every 50 guests. So if you’re unsure how 
many attendants you should have, figure out how many ushers you 

 Chapter 5: Minimizing Wedding Party Costs 71
need; doing so gives you the appropriate number of bridesmaids 
and groomsmen for your wedding size. Or you can choose to have 
ushers but no attendants, which will save you money on flowers, 
gifts, and reception costs.
Deciding on a ring bearer 
and flower girl
Traditionally, ring bearers and flower girls are most often included 
in formal weddings, but they make appearances at less-formal cer-
emonies, too. Child attendants are a good way to include beloved 
nieces and nephews or children from previous relationships into 
your ceremony. But keep in mind that expenses are associated 
with these roles.
 
When including child attendants, you need to purchase a flower 
basket for the flower girl and a ring pillow for the ring bearer. And 
if you have definite ideas about what you want the children to 
wear, you may decide to pay for their outfits, too. Depending on 
the kind of food at your reception and the ages of your child atten-
dants, you may need to arrange for child-friendly meals, which may 
cost extra. If they’re very young, you may want to arrange for child 
care so they don’t disrupt the reception — and, of course, that’s 
another added cost.
 
Many couples incorporate four-legged family members into their 
ceremonies, enlisting the family dog to serve as ring bearer, for 
example. If you’re getting married in a church, this probably isn’t 
an option. But if your wedding is at a park or in your back yard, 
having a canine ring bearer is an inexpensive alternative.
Outfitting the Wedding Party
Most couples ask their attendants to pay for their own wedding 
outfits, but many brides who shelled out lots of money for a brides-
maid dress that they never wore again are loathe to put their own 
attendants in that irksome situation. Especially if they want spe-
cific colors and styles, many brides feel they, and not their brides-
maids, should pay. Many grooms feel the same way about rental 
tuxedos; they don’t want their friends to resent paying high rental 
fees, so they pick up the bill themselves.
However, paying for your wedding party’s attire is entirely a per-
sonal choice. Most bridesmaids and groomsmen expect to pay for 
their own, so you don’t have to worry about breaching etiquette if 
you ask them to do so. And, of course, this is the cheapest way to 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
72
dress your attendants when you’re on a budget. Though, if you’re 
set on a specific style and have room in your budget, you and your 
intended may want to bear this cost yourselves.
Many couples simply give their attendants guidelines as to color and 
general style, and let them select their own outfits. This approach 
defuses money issues between you and your friends. Letting your 
attendants choose their own outfits also gives them the freedom to 
shop within their own budgets — which may be as tight as your own.
Dressing up your bridesmaids
Your bridesmaids can wear traditional bridesmaid dresses, formal 
dresses, or cocktail dresses. All these options allow you to get the 
look you want, no matter how formal or informal you need to go. 
Bridesmaid dresses usually are more expensive, so if you want to 
save money, go with formal or cocktail dresses. Costumes also are 
an inexpensive option.
Gussying up with traditional maid attire
Depending on how elaborate your bridesmaids’ dresses are, costs 
can range anywhere from about $50 to $250 or more. The more 
expensive dresses are made of satin or silk, and they usually have 
handcrafted details like beading or embroidery.
But the purchase price is by no means the end of the dress bill. 
Bridal shops almost always charge extra for alterations, which can 
run anywhere from $20 to $100. Even if you purchase the dresses 
at a department store or online, you’ll still likely have to pay a 
seamstress for alterations.
 
Some department stores offer free minor alterations, such as hem-
ming. If you find attendant dresses you like at a department store, 
ask about their alterations policy before you place your order.
 
Procrastination can cost you money. A delay in ordering the 
dresses can add an extra rush delivery fee to the outfits. So be 
sure to order bridesmaid dresses (or have your bridesmaids order 
them) as soon as you decide on a style and color. It’s far better — 
and cheaper — to have too much time for alterations than not 
enough. Besides, the earlier they have their dresses, the more 
time they’ll have to find the right shoes at the right price.
Increasing your savings with formal 
gowns or cocktail dresses
You don’t have to confine your choices to traditional bridesmaid 
dresses. Formal dresses often are much cheaper. Plus, your 
bridesmaid will be able to wear the dress again after the wedding. 

 Chapter 5: Minimizing Wedding Party Costs 73
You can get great-looking informal or formal dresses by buying 
at department stores or online retailers, such as Amazon.com or 
Overstock.com.
If you want a more formal look, check out cocktail or party 
dresses. To get a less formal look, select simple sleeveless, knee-
length dresses for your summer wedding. This choice won’t cost 
you (or your bridesmaids) a fortune, and it allows them to wear 
the dresses again for any number of summer occasions.
Going dramatic with a costume
Some couples incorporate elaborate themes into their weddings, 
dressing themselves and their attendants in the appropriate cos-
tumes. Costume rentals and purchases can be much less expensive 
than traditional wedding finery.
If you don’t have a local costume shop, look online for ideas and 
good prices on purchases. Moon Costumes (www.mooncostumes.
com), for example, has galleries of costume themes, and several of 
their costumes are less than $50. If you know what kind of costume 
you want, conduct an online search (“Star Trek costumes,” for 
example) to suss out the best prices.
 
Some online costume shops offer rentals as well as purchases, 
but I don’t recommend renting from an online retailer. You can’t 
make alterations to a rental costume, and rentals are usually lim-
ited to five days, giving you little time to resolve fitting or other 
issues. If you’d rather rent, stick with a bricks-and-mortar store in 
your area.
Finding the best attire for 
the groom’s buddies
Unless you’re planning a theme wedding, your groomsmen and 
ushers likely will wear tuxedos or suits. Either option is appropri-
ate; it just depends on the formality of the event and how much 
you want to spend. Of course, tuxes are the more formal and 
expensive option.
Opting for tuxes
Most men rent tuxedos because they have few occasions that are 
appropriate to wear one to, and purchasing a tux can cost $300 to 
more than $1,500. For that kind of money, a guy can buy a good 
suit that he can wear again to work or to other more formal 
functions.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
74
 
In most areas, a basic tuxedo rental costs between $50 and $100. 
This price typically includes a vest or cummerbund, a shirt, and a 
tie or ascot. Measurement and fitting services, as well as cleaning 
and pressing, will also likely be included in the rental fee. If you 
have the tuxes delivered (instead of picking them up), you may pay 
extra. Shoes also usually cost extra.
Some formalwear stores waive the groom’s rental fee if a minimum 
number of tuxes are rented by the groomsmen and ushers. I don’t 
recommend increasing the size of your wedding party just to score 
a free rental; after all, the other expenses of adding attendants 
would make that “free” tux quite costly. But if you’re already plan-
ning to have that minimum number of male attendants, ask the 
store manager whether he offers such a deal. If he doesn’t, look for 
another store in the same price range that does.
 
Look at formalwear store Web sites for online coupons or specials. 
And be sure to ask store personnel about any promotions or spe-
cials they offer.
Saving money with suits
Unless you’re planning a very formal affair, a good suit is a per-
fectly appropriate alternative to the traditional tux. The most 
common wedding suit colors are black, charcoal, and gray. But 
nothing says that the groom and male attendants can’t wear navy 
or another color of your choice. In fact, you can coordinate suit, 
shirt, and tie colors to accentuate the color scheme you’ve chosen 
for your nuptials.
If you decide to go the suit route, you have many options for dress-
ing your groomsmen. You can
 
✓ Ask that they wear suits they already own
 
✓ Purchase or rent suits for them
 
✓ Ask that they purchase or rent new suits
 
Men’s stores often run two-for-one specials on suits and accesso-
ries like shirts and ties, so you can get more value for your money. 
You can either get two suits for yourself or you can often pair up 
groomsmen to get the deal.
 
Ask whether the suit retailer does alterations and find out how 
much it charges. Simple tailoring, like hemming pants and shorten-
ing sleeves, often is free. More extensive alterations, however, may 
carry an additional charge.

 Chapter 5: Minimizing Wedding Party Costs 75
Having fun (and saving money) with costumes
Costume rental prices often are comparable to tuxedo rental costs. 
Purchased costumes can be quite inexpensive, especially if you 
search online. See “Going dramatic with costumes” earlier in this 
chapter and Chapter 6 for costume Web sites to check out.
Costume rentals usually work best when your attendants live 
nearby because they can go to the costume shop in advance to try 
on costumes and get a good fit. For purchases, though, you’ll prob-
ably find better prices online.
Helping the ring bearer and flower 
girl look as sweet as sugar
The families of the ring bearer and flower girl usually pay for their 
little one’s attire. But, as with your other attendants, if you have 
very specific ideas about what you want them to wear, consider 
picking up the cost yourself. Also, if the child’s family isn’t in good 
financial shape — and you have room in your own budget — you 
may want to pick up the tab.
Fortunately, children’s wedding attire can be quite inexpensive. 
Department stores and discount retailers typically have a good 
selection of lovely dresses for your flower girl and sharp-looking 
suits for your ring bearer. Renting a tuxedo for the ring bearer may 
be more expensive than purchasing a suit, so do your research 
before deciding on one or the other.
 
Check out used clothing stores or thrift shops for kids’ outfits. 
These outlets are often chock-full of gently used dresses and suits 
that their original owners outgrew, and prices are much lower than 
retail.
Accessorizing: It’s all about the bling
As any fashion follower knows, no outfit is complete until you 
have just the right accessories to create the look you want. But 
you don’t have to go overboard on your budget to create a styl-
ish, pulled-together look for your wedding party. The trick lies in 
expanding your ideas of how to accessorize your attendants’ attire.
Most accessories will be for the women in your wedding party. 
Men’s accessories, at least for traditional weddings, typically are 
limited to color-coordinated ties and sometimes vests or cummer-
bunds. Depending on the shirt style, the men also may need cuf-
flinks, but they’re less common these days.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
76
Coordinating bridesmaid jewelry
As brides have moved away from the tradition of dressing their 
bridesmaids exactly alike, they’ve begun leaning toward match-
ing jewelry. As you can imagine, these jewelry costs can add up 
quickly. Even a few cultured-pearl necklaces can cost you several 
hundred dollars or more. Add in matching bracelets and earrings, 
and you could easily be looking at a four-figure expense.
One way to save is to avoid focusing on earrings or rings as acces-
sories, because they’re too easily hidden in photos. If you can’t 
see them, why spend the money? Instead, concentrate on bolder 
pieces — necklaces, brooches, and bracelets — that stand out 
much more clearly.
 
Consider hosting a jewelry party at your home two or three months 
before your wedding. The hostess at these parties typically gets 
credits based on what her guests purchase, and you can use those 
credits to buy matching jewelry for your bridesmaids. Package the 
jewelry as your thank-you gift to your attendants to save even more. 
You also can find great (although not always matching) jewelry at 
vintage shops, thrift stores, and even garage or estate sales.
Fortunately, you can move the decimal point at least one place 
to the left and still get a stylish, coordinated look for your brides-
maids. Illusion necklaces, made of clear twine and a few colored 
glass beads or faux pearls, create a cool effect, and you can make 
them yourself for about $5 a piece with materials from your local 
craft store. Add coordinating bracelets for another $10 a piece, and 
you’ve got a lovely ensemble for an exceptionally reasonable price.
 
Before you buy or make costume jewelry, make sure none of your 
attendants is allergic to low-quality metals. Some people break out 
in hives or rashes when they wear this type of jewelry — that’s 
definitely not a look you want on your wedding day.
Exploring other accessory options for your wedding party
Jewelry isn’t the only way to tie your wedding party’s look 
together. You could save some money, for example, by having 
your bridesmaids carry beaded clutches or evening bags instead 
of flowers while the groomsmen wear ties in colors that coordinate 
with the bags. Or you could have the women wear colorful shawls 
or wraps and, again, coordinate the men’s ties with them. You can 
use inexpensive brooches to pin the bridesmaids’ wraps. You also 
can use affordable costume jewelry pins, which look great without 
breaking your budget.
The less formal your wedding, the more whimsical you can be with 
accessories. For a beach wedding, for example, the bridesmaids 
could carry plastic pails and shovels and the groomsmen could 

 Chapter 5: Minimizing Wedding Party Costs 77
wear beach towels draped over one shoulder — all of which you 
can buy at a discount retailer for far less than you’d pay for more 
traditional accessories. Use shell pendants and bracelets (you can 
buy them or make them yourself) to finish the ensemble.
 
If you choose accessories that your attendants are likely to use 
again, they can serve double duty as thank-you gifts — a great way 
to save money. Plus, you can spend a little more on accessories 
without feeling guilty; you can get linen wraps, for example, or use 
better-quality beads for the jewelry. (See the later section “Gifting 
Your Attendants” for more money-saving ideas.)
Pampering Your Wedding Party
Brides want their attendants to look and feel their best, so bridal 
spa parties have become popular. But they can be expensive, too. 
Simple facials and manicures at a salon can cost $100 or more per 
person; add in professional makeup, hairstyling, pedicures, and 
massages, and the cost easily reaches into the stratosphere.
The groom and groomsmen usually take care of their own groom-
ing expenses, such as haircuts. However, coed spa parties are 
becoming more popular, with the men getting manicures and per-
haps even facials or massages.
Who pays for these services depends on how adamant you are that 
your attendants have a specific look on your wedding day. If you 
insist on every woman having a fancy hairstyle and coordinated 
makeup, you should pay for those services. If the bridal spa party 
is just for fun, though, each bridesmaid can pay her own way — or 
choose not to attend if the cost is beyond her resources. The same 
rules apply to the male attendants: If you insist they take part, 
you should build this expense into your budget. If participation is 
optional, each member can pay his own way.
 
You can pay for spa and beauty treatments as a thank-you gift for 
your attendants. Doing so helps you get extra value out of your 
budget.
Here are some money-saving ideas to help you cut down on the 
hair and makeup costs:
 
✓ If your bridesmaids live near you, have practice parties 
together to experiment with hairstyles and makeup. Take 
pictures of the results you like so you can re-create them on 
your wedding day. Not only is this fun for the ladies in your 
wedding party, but it saves lots of money to boot.

✓ Schedule a makeup party with an independent beauty 
representative. For example, you can check with an Avon or 
Mary Kay salesperson for details. Even if no one purchases 
the products, you’ll pick up useful techniques for your wed-
ding day, and the beauty rep doesn’t charge for the party.
 
✓ Ask a friend or relative who’s a makeup expert to do your 
bridal party’s hair and makeup. This person doesn’t neces-
sarily have to be a professional; an amateur who’s great with 
beauty products also is an option. If a friend or relative is a 
professional stylist or cosmetologist, she may provide her ser-
vices for free as a wedding gift.
 
 If you do receive hair and makeup services as a wedding gift, 
you shouldn’t offer a cash tip. However, a personal thank-you 
gift is appropriate and should be accompanied, of course, by 
a thank-you note.
 
If you schedule a spa party, be sure you understand the terms and 
fees. Many spas and salons include staff gratuities in their pric-
ing, but sales taxes may not be included. Deposits are commonly 
required, usually 50 percent of the total, and the refund policy may 
have strict conditions attached. You’ll also pay more for a private 
party outside the facility’s normal operating hours or to have the 
staff come to your home or another location for the party.
Gifting Your Attendants
Your attendants provide support throughout your wedding plan-
ning process, so you probably want to show your appreciation for 
their friendship and commemorate the occasion with a thank-you 
gift. Gifts are a nice gesture, but don’t get wrapped up in the wed-
ding industry hype and go over budget.
 
Wedding vendors know you want to provide gifts for your atten-
dants, and, not surprisingly, they’ve turned this tradition into big 
business. You can find wedding-party gifts that range in price from 
a few bucks to thousands of dollars — along with the peddling of 
guilt that so many wedding vendors employ to get you to spend 
more than you really want to.
 
You don’t have to buy into the thank-you gift hype any more than 
you have to accept any other overpriced wedding product or 
service. This gift, like any other that you give, should reflect your 
knowledge of and affection for the recipient. And, most important, 
it should fit your budget.

 Chapter 5: Minimizing Wedding Party Costs 79
If you decide to give separate thank-you gifts — rather than using 
accessories or events like a spa day to serve as gifts — try to 
spend roughly the same amount for each attendant. Here are some 
ideas for fun, inexpensive gifts:
 
✓ Gift baskets: You can make these baskets yourself, incorpo-
rating any theme you like: bath and beauty, tea time, coffee 
lover, sports fan, cinema freak, and so on. Get the basket 
and wrapping paper — and perhaps even some items for the 
basket — at your local dollar store or discount retailer to 
keep costs down.
 
 You can have metal gift baskets engraved for a small cost — 
usually $10 or less — at places like Things Remembered or 
even a jewelry store. Or you can get engraved metal key rings 
to add to the gift basket as a memento of the day.
 
✓ Scrapbooks: A scrapbook can commemorate your friendship 
and your wedding if you include favorite photos of yourself 
and your attendant together, along with a copy of your cer-
emony program and other mementos from your wedding. 
Pick up inexpensive scrapbook kits at your local craft store, 
or look at your local dollar store for photo albums that can 
accommodate your mementos.
 
✓ A special outing: If your schedule allows, treat each of your 
attendants to a few hours of one-on-one time with you — 
perhaps a lunch, a round of golf, or an afternoon at the mall.
 
✓ Gift cards: Some people think gift cards are too impersonal, 
but if you know your best man is never happier than when 
he’s prowling the history section at his favorite bookstore, 
a gift card may be more appreciated than anything else you 
could give him.
 
If you need help thinking of appropriate gifts for your attendants, 
check out Surprise.com (www.surprise.com). This site scours 
the Internet for gifts and then categorizes them according to gender, 
personality traits, interests, and life situations. It also gives you 
prices and links to the sites that sell the items.
 
Don’t forget your flower girl and ring bearer, if you include these 
attendants. These little tykes deserve a gift of thanks as well. Some 
age-appropriate ideas for these special guests include personalized 
T-shirts, baskets filled with candy or other goodies, and gift cards 
for things like music downloads or cell phone ringtones.

Chapter 6
Dressing for Your Big Day
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a great dress at a great price
▶ Outfitting the groom
▶ Choosing affordable wedding rings
T
he wedding is all about the dress, right? Well, yeah, that stuff 
about uniting two loving hearts in matrimony, two families 
becoming one, and building a new life as partners is important, too. 
But the dress often seems to be the star of the show. Everything 
else — including the groom’s attire — is an accessory.
At least that’s the way you may feel when you’re trying to decide 
what you and your betrothed should wear for your wedding and 
how much you want to spend. The choices — and price ranges — 
seem infinite and bewildering.
Relax. In this chapter, you can discover the factors that affect wed-
ding dress prices and find out how to avoid common pitfalls at 
bridal shops. I also help you explore less expensive alternatives to 
traditional gowns and get ideas for adding your own personal flair 
to your wedding-day look. You also can check out some options for 
groom’s attire, including traditional and nontraditional tuxedos, 
suits, and more. Finally, I show you how to find wedding rings that 
won’t strain your wallet.
Looking Like a Princess 
on a Pauper’s Budget
If you flip through any bridal magazine, you may begin to imag-
ine that only the wealthy can afford to get married these days. 
Featured gowns in these magazines often carry four-figure price 
tags; when your entire wedding budget amounts to four figures, a 
$2,000 dress really is the stuff of fantasy.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
82
However, don’t despair. Frugal brides-to-be have all kinds of 
options for realizing their princess-for-a-day dreams on a realistic 
budget. Thanks to discount bridal stores and the Internet, you can 
snag your perfect dress at the price you want to pay more easily 
than ever. I show you how in this section.
Understanding average 
wedding gown costs
Wedding industry research puts wedding gown costs at anywhere 
from $800 to $2,500 for the average wedding (and the average wed-
ding costs between $20,000 and $25,000).
 
These averages are just for the gown. Accessories — including 
shoes, a veil and headpiece, and underclothing — can add another 
$200 to $300 to the cost. If you need alterations (most brides do), 
expect to pay out another hefty sum. And these figures don’t 
include jewelry.
Several factors determine the cost of a wedding gown, including 
the following:
 
✓ The designer: A Vera Wang design costs more than an Alfred 
Angelo design, which costs more than a little-known design-
er’s gown at a department store.
 
✓ The fabric: Both the quality and the amount of fabric play a 
significant role in determining the cost of a wedding gown. 
Real silk costs more than silky polyester, for example. And a 
full, poufy gown that requires yards and yards of fabric often 
costs more than a simple sheath.
 
✓ The quality: Finished seams, linings, and hand-sewn beading 
and lace accents cost more than ragged seams, no lining, and 
glued-on accents.
 
✓ The time of year: Just like any other fashion, this year’s unsold 
wedding gown models go on sale — usually in November and 
December — to make room for next year’s hot, new styles.
 
✓ The seller: You often pay more at bridal shops than at depart-
ment stores like Macy’s or Saks Fifth Avenue. Similarly, you 
usually pay more at department stores than you do at discount 
bridal shops, online retailers, or auction sites like eBay.
 
Generally, the simpler the gown, the less expensive it is. Lightly 
adorned tea-length gowns are typically less expensive than elabo-
rately accented, floor-length ones. Those with trains are even more 

 Chapter 6: Dressing for Your Big Day 83
expensive. (See the nearby sidebar for more information on the 
added expense of going with a train.) Figure 6-1 shows different 
styles and lengths of weddings gowns.
Figure 6-1: Wedding gown styles.

84
 
As with everything else associated with weddings, the very word 
“wedding” raises the price of a gown. You can pay a premium of 30 
percent or more to buy a wedding gown as opposed to an evening 
gown or dress of comparable quality. Be aware that bridal shops 
employ a ton of tricks to get as much money as they can out of 
their customers; they can’t rely on repeat business, so they try to 
make the most of their one-time opportunities. (See the later sec-
tion “Shopping smarter by avoiding common sales tactics” to find 
out how to deal with the tactics bridal shops use to raise the price 
tag on wedding attire.)
Finding a bridal outfit that both 
you and your budget love
Fortunately, you don’t have to deal with traditional bridal shops if 
you don’t want to. You can purchase a formal gown or dress from 
a department store or clothing chain and still look great. Even if 
you want a traditional wedding gown, you have lots of options for 
saving money. For instance, you can make your own headpiece and 
veil for a fraction of what they cost in bridal shops, and you can 
avoid the ubiquitous “wedding” markup on shoes by looking for 
the perfect pair at discount retailers. I discuss these money-saving 
tips and more in the following sections.
Saving money on the gown or dress
Frugal brides have lots of resources for finding the dress of their 
dreams at down-to-earth prices. Aside from seeking out discount 
bridal shops, you can put the Internet, your family and friends, and 
your creativity to work.
Here are some money-saving avenues to explore as you’re search-
ing for the perfect gown or dress:
To train or not to train
Depending on the style of your gown, you may have to decide whether you want a 
train. Usually, only floor-length gowns require a train, but modern designers have 
attached tulle or lace trains to street-length dresses as well. Some gowns have 
detachable trains that fasten to the back (in this case, you may have to pay extra if 
you order the train). Other trains are sewn into the gown, and you bustle them after 
the ceremony with buttons or ties. Traditionally, the more formal your wedding, the 
longer the train. A longer train usually means extra expense, however, because you 
pay for the additional fabric and detailing.

 Chapter 6: Dressing for Your Big Day 85
 
✓ Buy a gown online. The Internet has made finding a deal on 
a quality wedding gown or formal dress easier than ever. For 
instance, the Web is home to any number of discount bridal 
retailers. Check out www.bridalonlinestore.com and 
www.lilywedding.com, both of which get high marks for 
quality, value, and service from brides who have purchased 
from them. Similarly, you can find reasonably priced formal 
gowns and dresses through department store Web sites like 
www.macys.com and even Amazon (www.amazon.com).
 
 And, of course, there’s always eBay (www.ebay.com), where 
you can either bid on dresses or, often, use the “Buy It Now” 
feature for a set price. Many independent and discount bridal 
shops have stores on eBay, so you aren’t limited to second-
hand gowns.
 
 Use caution when buying on eBay. Look at pictures carefully, 
and ask the seller for additional photos if you can’t make out 
details. Always remember to check the seller’s ratings and 
return policies before you place a bid or order.
 
✓ Borrow a gown. Wearing a relative’s or friend’s gown adds a 
personal touch to your wedding ensemble. Plus, chances are 
that your mother, aunt, or best friend will be charmed and 
honored to loan it to you.
 
✓ Rent a gown. Renting may be a good option if you have your 
heart set on a designer dress but your budget says “no way.” 
Check in your local phone book for shops that rent wedding 
gowns or formal dresses. You also can call traditional bridal 
shops and ask whether they offer rentals. Depending on 
where you live and what kind of gown you rent, the cost can 
run anywhere from $100 for dresses that retail in the $300 to 
$500 range, to $1,000 for dresses with price tags of $3,000 or 
more. The rental price should include the headpiece and veil, 
train, crinoline, and other accessories (except shoes and jew-
elry), and you don’t have to worry about cleaning or storing 
the dress after your wedding.
 
✓ Buy a white, ivory, or cream bridesmaid’s dress. Brides-
maids’ dresses often cost less than $100, and you can get 
great styles. Embellish the dress with a colorful sash or wrap, 
ribbons, or sequins and synthetic gemstones.
 
 Bridal shops have caught on to the money-saving tactic of 
ordering a white bridesmaid’s dress in lieu of a traditional 
gown. Many of them now either charge an exorbitant fee or 
require you to purchase at least three (the idea being that you 
won’t order that many unless you really intend to have your 
bridesmaids wear white). You may have better luck — and 
better savings — looking online or in mail-order catalogs if 
you choose this route.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
86
 
✓ Make your own gown, or have one made. If you enjoy 
sewing, or if you have a friend or relative who sews, making 
your own dress may be an affordable option. Most fabric 
shops have wedding dress patterns. You also may be able to 
hire a professional seamstress to make your dress; many tal-
ented seamstresses can make designer-looking dresses for far 
less than you’d pay at a bridal shop.
Cutting costs on the veil and headpiece
You wouldn’t think a fabric-covered headband and a wisp of net-
ting could run you hundreds of dollars. But, believe it or not, the 
average bridal-shop cost for the headpiece and veil is $250.
If you gasped or rolled your eyes at the previous paragraph, take 
heart: You don’t have to shell out that kind of money. In fact, you 
don’t even have to wear a veil if you don’t want to. As a reasonable 
alternative, you can ask your florist to attach fresh flowers to a 
headband, barrette, or comb. Or consider making your own floral 
headpiece with silk flowers.
Online retailers like www.veilubridal.com offer steep discounts 
on all kinds of veils and tiaras; you can purchase plain veils for as 
little as $30 or $40. You can save money on fancier headpieces and 
veils online, too — prices can run between $100 and $150, com-
pared with $200 or $250 in a traditional bridal shop.
 
Even if you aren’t the crafty type, you still can make your own 
headpiece and veil for around $20 (or less) in materials. You can 
find do-it-yourself instructions for just about any style of head-
piece and veil online. Or follow these instructions:
 
1. Cover a plastic headband with fabric (white, cream, or 
colored to match your color scheme).
 
 Secure the fabric with glue, and make sure the fabric seam 
is on the underside of the headband.
Considering temple-ready gowns
If you’re getting married in a church, be aware that some places of worship have 
strict rules on bare arms, backs, and legs. You may need to take that into account 
when selecting your dress. Just be sure to avoid putting money down on a gown or 
dress that you won’t be able to wear (at least not without potentially budget-busting 
additions). You can still have your strapless or halter-type gown; just budget for a 
bolero jacket, shrug, or wrap to wear during the ceremony. Or look for so-called 
“temple-ready” gowns that include the wrap or jacket in the price.

 Chapter 6: Dressing for Your Big Day 87
 
2. Glue artificial flowers and a few pearl sprays, colored 
glass beads, or rhinestones onto the headband.
 
 Glue guns work well for this step. You can glue each piece 
individually, or you can run a strip of glue along the head-
band and attach the embellishments. Either way, be sure 
to hold the decorations in place for a few seconds to make 
sure the glue holds.
 
3. Glue a length of tulle or other veil fabric to the underside 
of the headband.
 
 The veil can be as short or as long as you like. Most veils 
fall somewhere between the shoulders and the floor; some 
even trail on the floor like a train. For a more whimsical 
look, you can glue ribbons to the back of the headband 
instead of a traditional veil.
Finding affordable bridal shoes
Even if your gown is floor-length, your shoes will be visible for 
much of your wedding day — as you walk down the aisle, if you’re 
kneeling at an altar, when you dance, and during the garter toss, 
for example. So you don’t want to wear any old shoes. You want 
shoes that are attractive, comfortable, and reasonably priced.
 
You don’t have to pay bridal shop prices for your wedding shoes. 
Instead, after you’ve decided on your dress, check out discount 
shoe retailers like the following:
 
✓ Amazon (www.amazon.com)
 
✓ Overstock (www.overstock.com)
 
✓ Payless ShoeSource (www.payless.com)
 
✓ Target (www.target.com)
 
✓ Wal-Mart (www.walmart.com)
You can search these sites by style, size, or color, and they have a 
variety of wedding-appropriate shoes for less than $30 (compared 
to an average of $80 for comparable shoes from a bridal shop). 
Even if you have to pay shipping, you still can save $40 or more. 
Keep in mind that Wal-Mart has shoes that may suit your bridal 
outfit, but their site’s search function isn’t as user-friendly as the 
ones on the Payless and Target sites. So you may just want to take 
a trek to your local store instead.
Depending on your style and taste, you can add a splash of color 
to your bridal ensemble by selecting shoes in a color that matches 
or complements your wedding colors. Or you can give inexpensive 
plain white or cream shoes a personal touch by adding colorful

bows, sequins, glitter, or ribbons — a cinch with the aid of a local 
craft store and a glue gun. (Think of Annie Bank’s kicked-up sneak-
ers in the movie Father of the Bride.)
Cutting back by opting for a nontraditional wedding dress
Only tradition and the wedding industry insist that brides wear 
an elaborate, expensive, some-shade-of-white gown in the current 
fashion.
Okay, your family members may raise their eyebrows, or even a 
ruckus, if you inform them that you intend to wear a nontraditional 
dress, but it could be fun, right? However, only you can determine 
whether a potential row with relatives would outweigh the benefits 
of walking down the aisle less traveled.
You can save a lot of money by ignoring tradition and the wedding 
industry. Here are some ideas for an elegant, one-of-a-kind bridal 
outfit:
 
✓ Go for color. Choose a cocktail dress, bridesmaid dress, or 
evening gown in a color that matches your wedding décor. 
Ruby red, royal purple, and sapphire blue are popular alterna-
tives to white. Opening yourself to a range of colors makes it 
easier to find a dress that fits your budget and complements 
your skin tone and body shape.
 
✓ Shop vintage clothing stores. Retro is chic, and you can find 
dresses that impart a unique flair to your wedding. You can 
stay within your budget by spending just a couple hundred 
bucks for an evening gown from the 1950s. Other pros: Your 
dress will be unique, and your guests will have an automatic 
conversation starter at the reception.
 
✓ Modify an heirloom dress. Maybe you have no interest in 
wearing your mother’s wedding gown as is, but what if you 
added a new skirt to the bodice or a new bodice to the skirt? 
By doing this, you end up with a unique dress that combines 
sentimentality with your own taste and style — all at a frac-
tion of the cost of a traditional wedding dress. You can do this 
with vintage clothing from a secondhand shop, too.
 
 Unless you’re handy with a sewing machine (or have a rela-
tive or friend who is), you should hire a seamstress to make 
the modifications. Just be sure to factor alteration costs into 
your budget; you may decide another option is better for your 
wallet.
 
✓ Have fun with a costume. Go back to the Renaissance, and 
walk down the aisle in a richly colored velvet gown (perfect 
for a winter wedding) or a simple evening gown accented with 
a velvet cape or cloak. You can find Renaissance gowns at 

 Chapter 6: Dressing for Your Big Day 89
ridiculously low prices. For example, Renaissance Costumes 
Clothing (www.renaissancecostumesclothing.com) has 
a burgundy velvet gown, complete with veiled headdress, or 
a Princess Monaco outfit, also with headdress, each for less 
than $50. You also can consider renting these types of cos-
tumes from a local costume shop.
 
 Some costumes look cheap and cheesy, so be careful if you 
decide to go this route. Check return policies carefully and 
order your costume well in advance of your wedding so you 
have time to look for something else if the costume doesn’t 
live up to your expectations.
Shopping smarter by avoiding 
common sales tactics
Shopping for a wedding dress is unlike any other clothes shopping 
you’ve ever done. For one thing, many bridal shops require you to 
make an appointment to try on dresses. (However, many accept 
walk-ins, too, which means, even if you make an appointment, the 
sales clerks may be busy with walk-ins when you arrive.) When you 
do walk through the doors, you may be subjected to confusing — 
and potentially costly — sales tactics.
 
Here are some common tricks to beware of in the bridal shop 
along with some solutions so you aren’t duped:
 
✓ Charging try-on fees: Many bridal shops charge fees for trying 
on their dresses — something no other clothing retailer does.
 
 Solution: Call ahead and ask whether the shop charges a 
try-on fee. If it does, move on to the next shop.
 
✓ Bait-and-switch advertising: Many bridal shops advertise “$99 
dresses” or “sample sales” of their merchandise. The problem 
here is that when you get to the shop, the $99 dresses often 
are mysteriously gone, and the sample dresses often are 
stretched, stained, and even torn from having been tried on 
several times. Naturally, then, the salesperson steers you to 
the more expensive, good-looking dresses.
 
 Another dishonest technique is using inflated retail prices 
before applying a discount. For example, a gown that normally 
retails for $1,000 may be tagged at $1,100 and then offered at 
10 percent off, bringing the price down to $990. So, in the end, 
you save a whopping $10.
 
 Solution: Go to the shop when it’s convenient for you, not 
because it’s supposedly having a sale. Also, do your research 
before you shop so you have an idea of what normal prices are.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
90
 
✓ Starting with higher-priced gowns: Think the salesclerks are 
going to bring out the inexpensive dresses first? No way. They 
know that many brides buy the first gown they try on. And, 
because salesclerks work on commission, they have a vigor-
ous incentive to bring out the priciest models first.
 
 Solution: Understate your budget by about 25 percent when 
you first discuss styles and price with the salesperson. If 
you’ve budgeted $500 for your gown, tell her that you want to 
look at models priced between $300 and $400. And refuse to 
try on anything priced above your real budget.
 
✓ High-pressure sales tactics: Salesclerks are trained to get you 
to sign the order form the same day that you try on dresses. 
They’ll tell you your dress will be gone or discontinued if you 
don’t order today, for example. But even if the dress you like 
is discontinued, chances are you’ll be able to find it some-
where — even online — at a lower price.
 
 Solution: Leave your wallet and credit cards at home so you 
can’t give in to the pressure — even if you’re tempted.
 
✓ Nonrefundable deposits: Most bridal shops require a 50 per-
cent nonrefundable deposit on any order. So, if you change 
your mind or the wedding is canceled or postponed, you don’t 
get your deposit back.
 
 Solution: Make your deposit with a credit card. Even though 
the shop won’t refund your money, you may be able to get a 
refund through the credit card company. Many credit cards 
won’t reverse charges unless they’re disputed within 60 days. 
However, if the shop goes out of business, that 60-day limit 
may not apply. (And this happens more often than you might 
think, by the way.)
 
✓ Dress substitutions: Believe it or not, some bridal shops 
charge brides for the dresses they order and then substitute 
cheaper dresses when the brides pick up their orders. They 
can get away with this because of the long gap between order-
ing and pick-up — often six months. Many brides forget the 
details of their dress in that time and may never notice that 
the dress they pick up isn’t the one they fell in love with and 
ordered.
 
 Solution: Take photos of the sample dress you try on and 
bring them with you when you pick up your dress. This way 
you can make sure you have the right dress in hand. Keep in 
mind that most shops won’t allow you to take photos until 
you’ve placed an order (they don’t want you to comparison 
shop). However, they should let you take pictures after you 
place an order.

 Chapter 6: Dressing for Your Big Day 91
 
✓ Hidden fees: The price on the dress isn’t necessarily the price 
you pay. For example, some bridal shops charge a “rush” 
fee if your wedding is less than six months away, and many 
charge extra for plus sizes. Most shops charge a fee to press 
your gown, and virtually all charge for alterations. For an 
additional fee, the shop also may deliver your gown to the 
ceremony site. And the clerk will be happy to complete your 
bridal outfit, from crinoline to jewelry — at additional cost, of 
course.
 
 Solution: Before you place an order, ask for an itemized list 
of any additional charges. Tell the clerk you won’t order the 
dress until you get that information in writing.
 
✓ Unauthorized add-ons: Some shops automatically add the veil 
and headpiece, shoes, and even slips, crinolines, and other 
undergarments, to the bill — even when you specifically tell 
them all you want is the dress.
 
 Solution: Get a receipt for your deposit that clearly spells 
out what you’ve ordered — including the dress style number, 
size, fabric, and delivery or pick-up date. When you go to pick 
up your dress, refuse to sign anything until you see an item-
ized list of charges. If you sign before you see the itemized 
list, you may not be able to dispute any unauthorized charges 
with your credit card company.
Dapper and Debonair: 
Dressing the Groom
Grooms traditionally wear tuxedos, but that isn’t necessary these 
days. Even if a bride wears a traditional wedding gown or dress, 
the groom can wear a suit — as long as the wedding isn’t ultra-
formal. And, of course, if the bride decides to wear a Renaissance 
gown (see the earlier section “Cutting back by opting for a non-
traditional wedding dress” for more about this option), it makes 
sense to dress the husband-to-be as a dashing knight or nobleman. 
In this section, I provide the groom everything he needs to know to 
decide what to wear on his special day.
Picking out your penguin 
suit: Wearing a tux
Tuxes come in different styles and degrees of formality, from the 
super-formal tailcoat to the more common notched lapel coat. 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
92
Morning-coat tuxes usually have waistcoats or vests instead of cum-
merbunds. Some styles use ascots instead of the more common 
bow ties. (Figure 6-2 shows different tuxedo styles as well as a 
business suit.) Unless your wedding is an extremely formal affair, 
you can choose whichever style you like best.
Most grooms rent their wedding tuxedos, which is much less 
expensive than purchasing one. Buying a good-quality tux with all 
the accoutrements — shirt, cummerbund or waistcoat, tie, and 
cufflinks — costs $500 or more, depending on the designer. 
Renting a tux of similar quality, with all the accessories, costs 
about a tenth of the price of buying one.
Figure 6-2: The common tuxedo styles and a typical business suit.
 
To buy or to rent is your choice. Base your decision both on how 
much you’ve budgeted for this wedding item and how much use 
you expect to get out of a tuxedo. If you’re a fixture at charity 
balls or have season tickets to the ballet, buying a tuxedo may be 
a better value. However, if the most formal event you expect to 

 Chapter 6: Dressing for Your Big Day 93
attend (other than your wedding) is opening day at the ballpark, 
renting your tux makes more sense.
Assuming you decide to rent your tux, here are some things to 
keep in mind:
 
✓ Rental shop inventory: Most couples want all the men in the 
wedding party to wear matching tuxes, with the same shirts, 
same ties, and so on. So before you commit to renting from a 
particular shop, make sure it can provide matching items for 
every man in your wedding party. Otherwise, you may end up 
having to pay more at another shop to get what you want.
 
✓ Measurements: A good rental shop trains its staff on how to 
take and record measurements to ensure a good fit. Ideally, 
they even have tailors on staff to make the alterations (instead 
of shipping the tuxes off-site for the work or ordering from a 
warehouse). However, if the alterations aren’t right, you may 
have to scramble for alternatives — such as buying a suit at 
the last minute — that can put a severe strain on your budget.
 
 Typically, you don’t pick up your rental tux until two days 
before the wedding — Thursday for a Saturday wedding, for 
example. That leaves little time to find a suitable substitute if 
your tux doesn’t fit.
 
✓ Package deals: The tuxedo rental fee will likely include every-
thing for the outfit — shirt, tie, cummerbund or vest, suspend-
ers, and cufflinks (if needed). Most rental shops also offer 
shoes, but you may have to pay an extra charge for them.
 
Many rental shops won’t charge for the groom’s rental if you 
reserve a minimum number of tuxedos for the wedding party. 
I don’t recommend expanding your wedding party just to get a 
free rental (you have to feed those extra ushers, you know), but if 
you’re planning to have five men rent tuxes anyway, ask whether 
the shop will give you a break on the groom’s package.
Considering other clothing options
More and more these days, budget-conscious couples are forgoing 
traditional wedding attire for more practical garb that they can 
wear again. If the bride opts for a simple evening gown or brides-
maid dress, it’s perfectly appropriate for the groom to wear a good 
suit or even a blazer and dress pants or khakis instead of a tux. In 
fact, many couples choose to dress the groom and ushers in suits 
even when the bride wears a traditional gown.
Even if you don’t already have a nice suit hanging in your closet, 
you can take advantage of sales at menswear stores to find one 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
94
that you can wear for your wedding and then to the office after 
your honeymoon. You may even find two-for-one deals that offer 
extra value — two suits you can wear to the office.
You also need comfortable, nice-looking dress shoes to go with 
your tuxedo or suit. See the earlier section “Finding affordable 
bridal shoes” for Web sites that offer inexpensive footwear; all the 
sites listed offer men’s shoes as well.
 
For good-quality men’s clothes at really good prices, check out 
online retailers like Overstock (www.overstock.com) and 
Amazon (www.amazon.com). These and other sites offer every-
thing from suits, blazers, and dress pants to coordinated shirt-and-
tie combos, dress shoes, and even socks. Prices for suits start at 
less than $100, and you can save anywhere from 10 percent to 35 
percent on shoes.
Secondhand clothing stores also can be a good source for low-
priced quality men’s clothing. Or you can hit the vintage clothing 
stores and look for a zoot suit to complement the bride’s retro 
gown.
Costumes are options for men, too. You can buy a Renaissance 
nobleman’s costume for less than $100 at www.renaissance
costumesclothing.com. Rental fees at your local costume shop 
may be even lower.
With This Ring: Selecting 
the Symbols of Your Love
Even though the groom often selects an engagement ring on his 
own, couples usually consult with each other about their wedding 
rings. Many couples choose matching rings, but you don’t have to. 
If you want a plain gold band and your betrothed wants something 
a little fancier, there’s no reason you can’t both have what you 
want — as long as you stick to your budget, of course!
 
Some couples purchase inexpensive rings for their ceremony and 
then upgrade them later when they have more money to spend. 
Other couples are appalled at the idea of replacing their wedding 
bands. Whatever way you decide to go, just be sure that you and 
your intended talk about your feelings on this topic.
The good news is that it isn’t difficult to trim your ring costs. Here 
are some money-saving options to explore:

 Chapter 6: Dressing for Your Big Day 95
 
✓ Choose a less expensive metal. Gold, either yellow or white, 
is the most common wedding band metal, but you also can 
get rings in titanium, silver, or platinum. The price curve, 
from least expensive to most expensive, looks like this: Silver, 
titanium, gold, and platinum. Keep that curve in mind if you’re 
trying to cut your ring costs. And remember that the material 
of the ring means nothing; it’s the symbolism that’s important.
 
 You can get silver wedding bands for as little as $20 a piece. 
Aircraft-grade titanium is durable, but it isn’t as easy to work 
with for sizing or repair as gold. Prices for gold bands depend 
on weight: 14 karat gold is less expensive than 18 karat or 24 
karat, and 14 karat is harder and more durable, which makes 
it more suitable for lifetime wear. Platinum runs $300 or more 
per ring; however, it’s very durable and develops a unique 
patina over years of wear.
 
 White gold is coated with rhodium to make it whiter. With 
use, the rhodium coating wears away, so most jewelers rec-
ommend having white-gold wedding rings recoated every 
couple of years. This maintenance adds to the long-term cost 
of a white-gold ring.
 
✓ Consider used jewelry. A good jeweler can adapt heirloom 
pieces — your grandparents’ wedding rings, for example — 
to suit you and your fiancé(e). If you don’t want to use family 
heirlooms, look in pawn shops and at estate auctions; you 
may find something you love for a fraction of its retail value. 
Dusty or dull rings can be cleaned, but make sure you inspect 
pieces carefully for scratches or other damage.
 
 If you have old, broken jewelry, you may be able to get a jew-
eler to melt it down and create your wedding bands from it. 
You’ll pay for the jeweler’s time and expertise, but you’ll save 
money on the materials. Plus, you’ll have rings that are unique 
to you as a couple.
 
✓ Search online. In the past few years, online jewelry stores 
have captured more than $2 billion of the retail jewelry 
market, accounting for 1 in every 20 purchases — a good indi-
cation that consumers are happy with the goods and services 
these retailers provide. Prices at online jewelry stores often 
are significantly lower than those in their bricks-and-mortar 
counterparts, too.
 
 As with any online retailer, be sure to check return policies 
and any guarantees before you buy from an online jewelry 
store. According to Top Consumer Reviews (www.top
consumerreviews.com), Blue Nile (www.bluenile.com), 
Diamond.com (www.diamond.com), and Mondera (www.
mondera.com) rank highest in terms of selection, pricing, 
and customer service.

You may think that locally owned jewelry shops can’t compete 
on price with the large chains. However, depending on the local 
store’s target clientele, some may be able to. Certainly, some small 
shops cater to wealthier shoppers, but many are in direct com-
petition for the same people who shop the large chains. Because 
of this competition, many of these shops may be more affordable 
with their pricing, and they usually offer superior service, includ-
ing on-site jewelry designers.

onventional wisdom says that couples have to attend to 1,001 
details in any wedding. Your final “detail tally” may not be 
that high, but you can’t afford to overlook certain details if you’re 
on a budget. You’d be surprised at how many engaged couples 
forget to plan for expenses for the officiant, the music for the cer-
emony, and decorations for the ceremony site. As a result, many 
of these couples exceed their budgets before they even put down 
their first deposits on their weddings.
In this chapter, I give you tips on keeping your ceremony costs in 
line with your budget, while still having the kind of ceremony you 
want. The form in Appendix D includes lines for these budget items 
so you won’t forget to plan for them.
Selecting an Officiant on a Budget
If you and your spouse-to-be are members of the same church, 
temple, mosque, or other place of worship, you may have already 
decided you want your wedding performed by one of the clergy 
there. In that case, all you have to do is find out the policies on 
paying the officiant — and, of course, whether he’s willing and 
available to perform your ceremony.
But if neither of you belongs to a religious group, you’re of differ-
ent faiths, or you think you’d prefer a civil ceremony, you have 
more legwork to do. The most important thing you need to know 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
98
is who’s authorized to perform weddings in your state. Every state 
allows clergy members and judges, as well as justices of the peace 
(in the areas that have this office), to perform weddings. Some 
states allow other officiants, too, and these others may charge 
quite a bit less than a minister or judge. (See the later sidebar 
“Who can perform wedding ceremonies?” for more details.)
However, keep in mind that the definition of “clergy member” can 
vary from one state to the next. For example, many states allow 
people who have been ordained online to perform marriage cer-
emonies, but Arizona doesn’t permit marriages officiated by 
“e-ministers.” Other states require officiants who have been ordained 
online to register before they can legally perform weddings.
 
To be absolutely sure your officiant — and therefore your 
marriage — is legal, call your county clerk’s office or marriage 
license bureau and ask. Make this contact well in advance of 
your wedding so you have time to make other arrangements if 
necessary.
Here are some places to start your search:
 
✓ Your local newspaper: Check out the wedding announce-
ments section; officiants sometimes advertise their services 
there.
 
✓ Your county clerk’s office or marriage license bureau: In 
addition to knowing who’s authorized to officiate weddings, 
these offices often know who actually offers these services in 
your area and may provide referrals.
 
✓ Online: Organizations like the National Association of 
Wedding Officiants (www.nawoonline.com) and the National 
Association of Wedding Ministers (www.aministry.net) 
offer searchable databases of nondenominational officiants in 
your area.
 
Start your search for an officiant at least six months in advance, 
especially if you’re planning a religious ceremony or have a high-
demand date like a Saturday in June. Religious officiants often 
require premarital counseling sessions or other preparation work 
(which may or may not be included in their fees) with the couples 
they marry. And many officiants, civil or religious, are booked sev-
eral months ahead for popular wedding dates.
Getting the skinny on general costs
After you’ve determined who you want to officiate your wedding 
ceremony, you can explore the costs associated with your prefer-
ence. I help you do just that with the information in this section.

 Chapter 7: Hammering Out the Ceremony Details 99
Officiant fees typically range from about $50 to $400 or more, 
depending on the type of officiant you use and the services he or 
she provides. Justices of the peace (and, where allowed, county 
clerks and notaries public) usually have the lowest fees, in the $50 
to $100 range. Sitting and retired judges may charge $100 to $200. 
Clergy fees run the gamut, and are often based on experience. A 
newly ordained or intern minister may charge only $100, but a 
more experienced minister may charge $300 or more.
Clergypersons often leave their “fee” up to the couple. If you aren’t 
sure how much of a fee is appropriate, contact the church secre-
tary or administrative office and ask how much couples usually 
give the officiant.
 
Some clergy members perform weddings at no charge. Similarly, 
friends or relatives who get ordained online often officiate for free 
as well. However, in both cases, etiquette dictates that you offer an 
honorarium to the officiant. The minimum appropriate honorarium 
is $100. If the officiant is from out of town, you should consider 
paying for her hotel room, too. If your funds allow, you may also 
consider helping to cover some of her other travel expenses.
You can hire a professional celebrant, too. But consider yourself 
warned: These professionals are usually much more expensive 
than more traditional officiants, often charging $500 or more. And 
they may provide services you don’t want or need, which doesn’t 
give you a lot of value for your money.
 
If you get married in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin, you 
and your betrothed can officiate your own wedding — which is the 
least expensive option of all. You may have to get a special type of 
marriage license, so contact your county clerk or marriage license 
bureau to find out what you have to do if you choose this route.
Breaking down the fees
Officiant fees include different services depending on the type 
of professional you choose. Those officiants who perform civil 
ceremonies — judges, justices of the peace, and other public 
officials — typically charge less because they don’t do much 
more than actually perform the wedding. Clergy fees, on the other 
hand, may include premarital counseling or planning sessions, the 
rehearsal, and even travel to and from the ceremony site. These 
services may cost extra, so you need to understand exactly what 
your officiant’s fees include.
The following questions can help you bring to light extra fees that 
often aren’t included in an officiant’s set rate:

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
100
 
✓ If this is a package fee, what exactly does the package 
cover? Write down everything that’s included, such as the 
number and length of planning meetings, maximum mileage, 
any time limits for the rehearsal or ceremony, and any other 
services, such as supplying an organist or singers for the 
ceremony.
 
 If the officiant is responsible for lining up singers or musi-
cians, be sure to note whether the fees for their services are 
included in your package. Sometimes the package only covers 
the administrative costs of reserving the organist or soloist, 
not the performance fees.
 
✓ What if I don’t want some of the services in your package? 
You may not get a discount if you elect not to use some of 
the officiant’s services; in fact, you may be charged extra. For 
example, some churches charge an extra fee if you choose to 
use outside musicians, especially if they aren’t pros.
 
✓ What happens if you can’t make the ceremony? Officiants 
can get sick or injured or face unexpected family emergencies 
just like anyone else. Ask about the officiant’s backup plan, 
and, if possible, meet the person who will fill in if the officiant 
is unable to perform his duties.
 
✓ Do you charge extra for additional planning meetings, coun-
seling sessions, or overtime at the rehearsal or ceremony? 
You don’t want the unpleasant surprise of an extra expense if 
the rehearsal runs late or you and your spouse-to-be want to 
meet with the officiant one last time to go over final details.
 
✓ Do you charge extra for customizing our ceremony? Many 
officiants allow you to choose from a selection of ceremony 
structures, readings, and so on. Others offer a standard cer-
emony and charge extra if you want to make changes.
 
✓ Do you charge for things like phone calls or e-mail responses? 
Some officiants charge on an hourly basis, so the more time they 
spend with you before and during your wedding, the higher the 
bill will be.
 
✓ Do you require a deposit, and, if so, how much? Some offici-
ants require a 50 percent deposit, with the balance due the 
day of the wedding. Others require full payment up front. 
Make sure you have the terms in writing, and ask for a receipt 
for any payments you make.
 
✓ What is your refund policy? As with all your wedding ven-
dors, you want to know whether you can get your deposit 
back if you change your mind about this officiant before the 
wedding — or if the wedding is postponed or canceled.

 Chapter 7: Hammering Out the Ceremony Details 101
Who can perform wedding ceremonies?
Every state allows clergy and judges (and justices of the peace, in states that have 
them) to perform weddings. Some states allow other officiants, too, and these 
others may charge quite a bit less than a minister or judge. Here’s a list of states 
that, as of this writing, have other authorized officiants.
Alaska: Salvation Army commissioned officers; marriage commissioners; “deputy 
marriage commissioner for a day” (if you want a friend or relative to officiate).
California: Marriage commissioners; “deputy marriage commissioner for a day” (if 
you want a friend or relative to officiate).
Colorado: Couples themselves (check with your county clerk for requirements).
Florida: Notaries public.
Idaho: Designated public officials such as mayors.
Illinois: Certain public officials.
Indiana: Circuit Court clerks; city or town clerks or clerk-treasurers.
Massachusetts: Out-of-state clergy who received a Certificate of Authorization 
from the Secretary of the Commonwealth; anyone with special one-time authoriza-
tion from the governor (if you want a friend or relative to officiate).
Michigan: Nonresident clergy; mayors (in their own cities); county clerks.
Minnesota: Clerks of court; court commissioners.
Mississippi: Mayors; local Board of Supervisors members.
New Hampshire: Out-of-state clergy who receive a special license from the sec-
retary of state.
New York: Mayors; city clerks; deputy city clerks; appointed marriage officers.
Oregon: County clerks; deputy county clerks.
Pennsylvania: Couples who obtain a “self-uniting” license; county clerks and their 
appointed deputies; mayors.
Rhode Island: Court clerks; certain former court clerks; Police Court in the town of 
Johnston; wardens in the town of New Shoreham.
Vermont: Nonresident clergy who get a permit from the appropriate county probate 
court.
Virginia: Marriage commissioners.
West Virginia: Court-appointed authorized officiants.
Wisconsin: Couples may officiate themselves if this is part of their religion’s “estab-
lished customs or rules.”

Most professional officiants offer contracts that spell out their 
responsibilities and fees. Make sure the contract also includes 
details such as the dates and times of your ceremony and 
rehearsal as well as deposit and refund policies.
 
The officiant’s fee doesn’t include the following costs:
 
✓ The fee for the marriage license: You have to pay this fee 
(which can be anywhere from $10 to $100, depending on 
where you live) to your local government clerk or marriage 
license bureau.
 
✓ The officiant’s tip: The customary officiant gratuity is $75 to 
$150, depending on where you live and the breadth of the ser-
vices the officiant provides for you. (If the officiant performs 
the ceremony for free, the honorarium counts as the gratuity.)
 
✓ The officiant’s meal: If your officiant will attend your reception, 
you need to budget for the cost of feeding him (and perhaps his 
spouse).
Remember to include these costs in your budget. You don’t want 
to have to scramble for money to cover them at the last minute.
Hearing the Music of Your 
Dreams — for Less
Ceremony music is a great way for you to express your per-
sonality, tastes, and feelings about the person you’re marrying. 
Unfortunately, it also can cost much more than you’d expect — 
especially if, like many couples, you focus heavily on the reception 
music and then add the ceremony music to your budget as an 
afterthought.
You can have live or recorded music — or a combination of both — 
for your ceremony. For example, you could play recorded music 
for 30 minutes before the ceremony, as your guests arrive and are 
being seated, and then have live music for the ceremony itself.
 
Some places of worship don’t allow recorded music, and others 
don’t allow secular music. Be sure to ask about the venue’s music 
policies and restrictions before you make a deposit.
Generally, recorded music is less expensive than hiring live musi-
cians and singers, and it has the added advantage of predictability; 
assuming the equipment works as it’s supposed to, you’ll get the 
same rendition of, say, “At Last” every time it plays. But live musi-
cians and singers add a certain panache to a wedding ceremony. 

 Chapter 7: Hammering Out the Ceremony Details 103
Luckily, you can have that extra fillip without breaking your piggy 
bank. For money-saving tips for both recorded and live ceremony 
music, read on.
Opting for recorded music
Unless you have a close friend or relative who’s an outstanding 
singer or instrumentalist — and who’s willing to share her 
musical gift for free (or at least in exchange for a free meal at 
the reception) — pre-recorded music is the least expensive way 
to have the melodies you want for your ceremony.
Recorded music also may be the easiest way to mix and match 
music — for example, if you want to walk down the aisle to 
Pachelbel’s Canon in D, have The Beatles’ “In My Life” for the solo, 
and walk back up the aisle to the theme from “Star Wars.” If you’re 
asking yourself, “Can I do that?” the answer is of course you can. 
But you may have to select a nonreligious venue for your cer-
emony, because some churches, temples, and mosques have fairly 
strict rules about music. At other venues, though, there are no 
wedding music rules, so you can choose whatever songs you like.
 
If your ceremony site is cramped — a gazebo, a boat, or some 
other small area — recorded music is definitely the way to go. Not 
only is it cheaper, but it also saves a lot of space.
In the following sections, I explain your options for broadcasting 
recorded music to your audience and tell you how to compile a 
playlist that your budget will love.
Broadcasting your tunes
 
Whether you’re using a portable stereo or your ceremony site’s 
sound system, be sure to check the sound quality before your big 
day. You want the music to be plainly audible without sounding 
tinny or distorted, and you want to make sure the playback system 
you use is powerful enough to fill the space. A tiny portable stereo 
probably won’t be able to project the music throughout a large 
chapel, for example, and you’ll likely be disappointed — even if 
you do save money.
If you don’t have access to a good-quality portable stereo or a 
sound system at the ceremony site, consider renting a sound 
system for the day. This route is especially cost-effective if you 
decide to have a friend act as the DJ during your reception. In most 
areas of the country, you can rent the equipment for the entire day 
for about half (or less) of what a professional DJ costs just for the 
hours of the reception.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
104
 
If you decide to hire a DJ for your reception (see Chapter 13), ask 
how much she’d charge to play the music at your ceremony, too. 
If she can use the site’s sound system and doesn’t have to spend 
time setting up and breaking down her own equipment, she may be 
willing to do it for a small fee.
Another option: Ask a friend or relative to run the sound system 
for your ceremony. You won’t have to pay him, though you should 
plan to give him a thank-you gift.
Deciding on a playlist
If you decide to be your own DJ for the ceremony (or you have 
a friend do the honors), you have to collect the tunes that you 
want to play. You can shop for wedding music CDs, which usually 
contain several selections you can use as processional and reces-
sional music as well as a variety of love songs for use during the 
ceremony. If you’re a music buff or have eclectic taste, you also 
can create your own wedding mix CD, which allows you to include 
the music you and your affianced really want.
 
To create your own wedding mix, you can download music from 
the iTunes store (www.apple.com/itunes) to your iPod or MP3 
player; costs range from less than $1 for a single song to about 
$10 for an album. Wedding Music Central (www.weddingmusic
central.com) has entire ceremony packages starting at less 
than $20.
Hiring musicians and singers
It would be great fun to walk down the aisle as Yo-Yo Ma renders 
sweet cello music at the foot of the altar and to look into your 
betrothed’s eyes as Celine Dion sings “My Heart Will Go On.” But, 
even if Mr. Ma and Ms. Dion performed at weddings, I’m pretty 
sure their fees could in no way be considered budget options.
On the other hand, a gifted cellist and a talented singer from your 
local high school or college can provide lovely music for very little 
cost. Some high school and college music programs even have 
small instrumental and vocal groups you can hire to perform for 
your wedding; contact the music director and ask if he can recom-
mend any students. Or ask to post a notice on the department’s 
bulletin board, asking interested students to call you to arrange an 
audition.
The following are some other places to look for ceremony musi-
cians and singers. You can check all these sources and compare 
the costs and quality of the candidates you find, or you can set a 

 Chapter 7: Hammering Out the Ceremony Details 105
range you’re willing to pay and then go down the list until you find 
someone whose prices match your budget:
 
✓ At your church or place of worship: The church organist or 
pianist may be available to play at your wedding. In fact, he 
may already have a batch of standard wedding pieces that 
you can select from for your wedding. Other members of 
your congregation may have musical talents, too — perhaps 
a guitarist or clarinetist who could work alone or with the 
organist or pianist. Don’t forget that outstanding singer from 
the church choir.
 
✓ Among music teachers and tutors: Folks who teach piano, 
guitar, and singing also play piano and guitar and sing. They 
may be the perfect fit for your ceremony, so don’t overlook 
these musicians.
 
✓ In your local newspaper: Musicians often run newspaper ads 
announcing their services. You also can place your own ad 
seeking services and setting up auditions.
 
✓ Online: Several Web sites offer localized searches for musi-
cians. Start with Wedding Music USA (www.weddingmusic
usa.com), which allows you to search for local musicians, 
bands, DJs, and singers. You also can search craigslist (www.
craigslist.org) for the city nearest you; look under 
Community/Musicians, or post an ad stating what you’re 
looking for (an acoustic guitarist, pianist, and so on).
 
Whether you choose students, amateurs, or pros to perform at 
your wedding, always audition the musicians before you hire 
them. Ask for either a live audition or a recording. If the music you 
want isn’t already in their repertoire, provide sheet music and ask 
them to play or sing a portion of it; doing so gives you an idea of 
whether they’ll be able to learn the piece(s) in time for your wed-
ding. Auditioning also gives you a chance to assess whether the 
musicians’ skills match the prices they charge you.
 
You may be able to save money by having the same musicians 
perform for both your ceremony and your reception, especially if 
you don’t have a long wait between the two events. Alternatively, 
you could hire one or two band members to handle the ceremony 
music, and then pay the entire band for the reception only.
Like all other wedding services, prices for musicians and DJs are 
usually higher in the summer. However, you often can get a price 
break — perhaps a substantial one — for a weekday or Sunday 
ceremony, or for a wedding date in January, March, or November. 
February can be expensive because of Valentine’s Day, but you 
may get a break if you avoid setting your date close to the 14th. 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
106
December is a terrible time both to book musicians and to get a 
price break; private and corporate holiday parties place them in 
high demand, so the musicians can charge peak rates.
When you’re ready to sign up your ceremony musicians, keep the 
following things in mind. And note that even though I use the term 
“musician” throughout this list, all these points apply to any sing-
ers you hire, too.
 
✓ Familiarity with the music: If the church organist will play 
at your wedding, you’ll only have to provide sheet music if 
you want her to play a piece outside her repertoire. Give her 
as much time as possible to learn and practice new pieces 
(and remember that she may have to transpose sheet music 
that’s written for other instruments). For other musicians, 
make sure they either know or have plenty of time to learn the 
music you want them to play.
 
✓ Familiarity with the ceremony site: If you’re bringing in out-
side musicians to play at your church ceremony, or if your 
ceremony site is something other than a church, make sure 
the musicians are familiar with the setup. If they haven’t per-
formed at your site before, arrange a walk-through to check 
for things like outlets for electrical equipment.
 
✓ The number of hours they’ll play: You need between 30 and 
45 minutes of pre-ceremony music, plus the time for the cer-
emony. Most ceremony musicians charge by the hour, and 
hourly rates average between $80 and $200. Keep in mind that 
students’ rates usually are about 30 percent lower than the 
rates for professional musicians. Some musicians charge for a 
minimum number of hours; a two- or three-hour minimum is 
typical.
 
 Find out whether the musicians will attend your ceremony 
rehearsal and whether they charge extra for that. Also, if 
you’re combining, say, the church organist and outside musi-
cians, ask about how they’ll rehearse together. And find out 
whether you’ll be charged any fees associated with music 
rehearsals.
 
✓ The musician’s attire: You don’t want your musician dressed 
in a T-shirt and torn jeans at your ceremony. So be sure to 
talk about what she’ll wear, and include this agreement in the 
contract.
As with all your wedding vendors, make sure you get all the details 
you work out with your ceremony musicians in writing. The 
church organist or student musician may not require a formal con-
tract, but you still should have a written agreement noting dates 
and times for rehearsals and your ceremony, the music you want 

 Chapter 7: Hammering Out the Ceremony Details 107
performed and when each piece should be played (pre-ceremony, 
processional, and so on), payment arrangements (total charges, 
deposits, and when the balance is due), and any other special 
instructions.
Decorating on a Dime
The site you choose for your ceremony (see Chapter 4) affects 
the kinds of decorations you need. At some venues, you may not 
need to supply ceremony decorations at all. For instance, you may 
choose to have your ceremony in the atrium of a hotel that already 
has trees and shrubs decked out with clear miniature lights — 
perfect for an evening wedding.
 
When you’re looking at ceremony sites, ask whether the venue 
provides decorations. Some churches and other locations offer 
packages that include the rental fee and decorations. Choosing 
such a package may be less expensive than providing your own 
decorations. And if you get married near a holiday like Christmas 
or Easter, the church may already be decorated, so you don’t have 
to provide anything.
 
You and your spouse-to-be should be the focal point of the cer-
emony; you don’t want to be upstaged by decorations. You also 
don’t want elaborate decorations blocking your guests’ view of the 
ceremony.
If you do want to decorate your venue, you don’t have to spend a 
lot to get a festive, celebratory look. Consider the following low-
cost ideas and see whether they spark any of your own:
 
✓ Balloons are an inexpensive way to decorate the entrance of 
a church or other building; for an outdoor wedding, use bal-
loons to cover a garden arch at the entrance to the ceremony 
site. Check your local party goods or dollar store for balloons 
and blow them up yourself; helium is expensive and helium-
filled balloons present an environmental hazard when they 
float away.
 
✓ Simple bows, which you can purchase ready-made or make 
yourself with materials from your local craft store, serve as 
lovely pew markers or seat decorations. If your ceremony site 
allows it, you also can line the aisle with fresh or silk flower 
petals or wedding confetti.
 
✓ For an evening wedding, place luminarias next to the seats on 
each side of the aisle. Just be sure to secure them so guests 
don’t knock them over. (See the nearby sidebar “Making lumi-
narias” for more on this do-it-yourself project.)

✓ Wrap pillars in garland (matching one or more of your wed-
ding colors) and clear miniature lights. Or use the garland and 
lights to decorate the rafters of a gazebo, park pavilion, or 
garden bower.
 
✓ For the altar, check into renting potted plants or trees and 
decorating them with lights and ribbon. Or, if you have a 
green thumb, save some money and plant some pots yourself. 
Just be sure to plant them early enough that they have time to 
grow before the wedding.
Making luminarias
Luminarias are tealight or votive candles placed in paper bags weighted with 
sand. They’re popular Christmas decorations in the Southwest, but they can make 
a lovely addition to your wedding ceremony, too — and they’re inexpensive. You 
can find all the materials you need at your local craft or dollar store. Depending on 
your tastes, you can cut designs into the bags or decorate them, or you can simply 
choose white bags or ones that match your wedding colors.

(Or Fun Alternatives)

F
lowers have been an integral element of wedding celebra-
tions at least since the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations 
thrived, and probably since long before that. In old Athens and 
Rome, brides wore garlands of fresh herbs or ivy in their hair; it 
was believed that the fragrant greens kept evil spirits from getting 
too close to the maiden. The garlands also symbolized fertility, 
unity, and good fortune for the marrying couple.
Over time, the garland of herbs evolved into a bouquet of flowers. 
In the 1300s, brides began tossing their bouquets just before leav-
ing on their wedding trips as a way to avoid having their gowns 
ripped apart by guests who were anxious to grab a souvenir — 
and, presumably, a bit of the newlyweds’ good fortune. (This also 
is believed to be part of the reason behind the tradition of the 
groom tossing his bride’s garter.)
Like nearly everything else wedding-related, the specific flow-
ers, bouquets, and centerpieces that are favored change with the 
times. In Victorian times, for example, orange blossoms — either 
in a headdress or a bouquet — were more or less a required acces-
sory for brides around the world. Today, however, red or white 
roses are a wedding staple, as are lilies and baby’s breath.
 
You don’t have to limit yourself to these standbys for your wed-
ding. Nor do you have to follow the latest (often most expensive) 
trends. In this chapter, I show you how to get stunning flowers or 
other accents to match both your taste and your bank balance.

I also tell you what you need to know to research and hire a florist 
and help you explore ways to keep your costs down without sacri-
ficing style, elegance, or your credit rating. And if you’d prefer not 
to have fresh flowers, I give you some information on artificial flow-
ers and other fun alternatives.
Thinking About Your Floral Budget
Fresh flowers are everywhere at most weddings. The bride and 
bridesmaids typically carry bouquets; sometimes they wear flow-
ers in their hair, too. The men in the wedding party all wear bou-
tonnieres. The mothers and sometimes grandmothers of the happy 
couple wear corsages. The flower girl’s very job may be to carry a 
bouquet or flower basket, and she may scatter fresh flower petals 
along the aisle. Flowers also are used as decorations at both the 
ceremony and reception.
 
The bill for all these fresh flowers can add up quickly. According 
to The Wedding Report, an industry research group, the aver-
age amount spent on wedding flowers is just under $1,300. Other 
research indicates that the average price tag for reception center-
pieces alone is $1,300. Whether you spend this much (or more, or 
less) depends on where flowers fall on your list of priorities and 
what kinds of flowers and arrangements you want. (Chapter 1 can 
help you rank your priorities. Flip there for more information.)
Envisioning the flowers you’ll select
Calla lilies, orchids, irises, and gardenias are all popular — and 
expensive — choices for weddings. But you can get spectacular 
effects from virtually any kind of flower. So, unless you have your 
heart set on a certain type, it’s smart to look at all your options. As 
you’re reviewing your choices, keep the following elements in mind:
 
✓ Color: If you have a traditional white or ivory gown or dress, 
you can use your bouquet to provide color and dimension 
to your overall look. Flowers also complement and accentuate 
your overall color scheme.
 
 You can get carnations, a popular inexpensive flower, in 
nearly any color you want. Carnations also provide lots of 
texture, making them a perfect complement to a less ornate 
wedding gown or dress.
 
✓ Fragrance: Some flowers have bold fragrances, and these 
heady scents could cause problems if you, your wedding 
party, or even your guests suffer from allergies. Lilacs are 

 Chapter 8: Picking Flowers (Or Fun Alternatives) 111
beautiful, but they’ll detract from your ceremony if they set 
everyone along the aisle sneezing as you make your way to 
the altar. Gardenias, some varieties of lilies, and freesia also 
are, shall we say, exceptionally aromatic. If you like the looks 
of these flowers but not the scent, consider using artificial 
versions (which probably will be cheaper than the real thing). 
Or ask your florist about inexpensive, lightly scented options.
 
✓ Maintenance: Be sure to choose flowers that will hold up well 
in the environment of your ceremony and reception sites. 
Some flowers tolerate heat and humidity well and will look 
lovely at your outdoor ceremony, for example. Others will 
shrivel up like salted snails if the conditions aren’t perfect — 
which means you’ll be paying money for a look you definitely 
don’t want.
 
✓ Meaning: So much of your wedding ceremony is symbolic, 
and the selection of flowers can be, too, if you want. In 
Victorian times, the language of flowers was well known: 
Yellow roses signified jealousy, for example, and lily of the 
valley suggested happiness. (See the nearby sidebar “Flowery 
language” for more on the meanings of different blooms — 
and how to say what you want with an inexpensive flower.) 
These days, few guests will know what the tulips in your bou-
quet stand for (love and passion), but you and your spouse-
to-be can make this a romantic secret between the two of you. 
Besides, when they’re in season, tulips are much less expen-
sive than, say, calla lilies.
Selecting a style for 
the bridal bouquet
 
The true cost of any flower arrangement lies in the labor to create 
it. However, the types of flowers you choose and the size and style 
of your bouquet influence its price, too.
If you want to carry a bouquet, you have several styles to choose 
from. Here’s a quick primer on the most popular styles (see Figure 
8-1 for examples):
 
✓ Biedermeier: A type of nosegay (see the later entry) consist-
ing of concentric circles of different kinds of flowers (for 
example, white roses alternating with red carnations). The 
circles give the bouquet a striped or bull’s-eye look. Because 
of the number of flowers used, Biedermeiers tend to be more 
expensive than some other bouquet styles.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
112
 
✓ Cascade: A waterfall of flowers and greenery. The flowers 
can be all one kind or varied. A cascade-style bouquet offers 
an elegant look that works best with more formal gowns and 
tall or medium-tall brides; cascades can emphasize smaller 
brides’ lack of height. Labor costs make prices on cascades 
generally higher than some other, simpler bouquet styles.
Flowery language
In the mid to late 1800s, flowers held messages for those who knew the code. Men 
and women who would never dare say such things aloud could tell each other how 
they felt by giving a gift of flowers. Here are the meanings of some popular wedding 
flowers and greens, along with where they fall in the pricing scale:
Baby’s breath: Innocence; purity (inexpensive)
Calla lily: Magnificent beauty (expensive)
Carnation: Devotion (general); woman’s love (pink); pure love (white) (inexpensive)
Chrysanthemum: Love (red); truth (white) (inexpensive)
Daffodil: Regard; respect (inexpensive)
Daisy: Loyal love (inexpensive)
Fern: Magic; fascination (inexpensive)
Forget-me-not: True love (inexpensive)
Freesia: Innocence; trust (inexpensive)
Gardenia: Secret love; refinement (expensive)
Iris: Passion (yellow) (expensive)
Ivy: Wedded love; fidelity (inexpensive)
Lily of the valley: Happiness (expensive)
Orange blossom: Eternal love; fruitfulness (inexpensive)
Orchid: Love; beauty (expensive)
Peony: Happy marriage (expensive)
Phlox: Our souls are united (inexpensive)
Rose: Love; beauty; joy; passion (price depends on type and time of year)
Color changes the meaning of certain flowers. For a comprehensive list of 
what flowers of different colors mean, check out victorianbazaar.com/
meanings.html.

 Chapter 8: Picking Flowers (Or Fun Alternatives) 113
 
✓ Composite: A technique in which flowers or petals are wired 
together on a single stem to create the illusion of one large 
blossom. You can opt for one or more kinds of flowers for this 
style bouquet. Price depends on the number of flowers you 
use (which also affects the labor cost).
 
✓ Hand-tied: A dense bunch of flowers wired or tied together or 
anchored in a holder. This is usually the least expensive bou-
quet option.
 
✓ Nosegay: A cluster of blooms, all the same length, gathered to 
form a round bouquet and often bound with ribbon or lace. 
Nosegays usually have one dominant flower or color. Like 
hand-tied bouquets, nosegays tend to be less expensive than 
other styles.
 
✓ Pomander: A ball covered with blossoms and carried by a 
ribbon. This style of bouquet is commonly used for child 
attendants, but brides have been known to carry them as well. 
Depending on the size and the kind of flowers you choose, 
pomanders can cost anywhere from around $25 to $75 or 
more.
 
✓ Posy: A small nosegay. Posies are usually quite inexpensive 
because they don’t require as many flowers.

Check out bridal magazines and Web sites for photos of various 
bouquets to see which styles you like. The Knot (www.theknot.
com) and OneWed (www.onewed.com) have good representative 
photos. Also look at nonbridal bouquets for less traditional (and 
often less expensive) inspiration.
Of course, you don’t have to carry a bouquet if you don’t want to. 
See “Considering alternatives to fresh flowers,” later in this chap-
ter, for more ideas.
Choosing flowers for 
the wedding party
Like the bride, the wedding party traditionally carries or wears 
some type of fresh flowers for the ceremony. The following list 
shows the most common and traditional options:
 
✓ Bridesmaids: Like the bride, the bridesmaids usually carry 
bouquets; the maid or matron of honor’s bouquet is usually a 
bit larger than the others (but not as big as the bride’s).
 
✓ Male wedding party members: The groom, his best man and 
other attendants, the ushers, and the fathers of the bride and 
groom traditionally wear boutonnieres. This custom dates to 
the days when a knight wore his lady’s colors — in the form of 
a small scarf or handkerchief — at jousting tournaments.
 
 The groom’s boutonniere usually is one of the colors of the 
wedding color scheme, and the ushers’ or groomsmen’s 
boutonnieres are a complementary color. Boutonnieres for 
the father of the bride and father of the groom typically are 
a third color, which distinguishes them from the ushers and 
denotes their special place of honor.
 
✓ The flower girl: The flower girl usually carries a basket of 
flowers or a basket of petals that she tosses along the aisle. 
The latter custom comes from old England, when the entire 
bridal party would make its way to the church behind the 
flower girl, who strewed petals from a basket along the route.
 
✓ Mothers and grandmothers: The mothers of the bride and 
groom usually wear corsages of different styles. Couples often 
provide corsages for their grandmothers as well.
 
The price tag for all these flowers averages about $360 — and that 
doesn’t include the bridal bouquet, altar flowers, or other cer-
emony decorations.

 Chapter 8: Picking Flowers (Or Fun Alternatives) 115
 
Boutonnieres from a florist average around $10 a piece, and 
corsages can run anywhere from $10 to $20 each. But you can 
get them much cheaper online. Costco (www.costco.com), for 
example, has a package of 15 boutonnieres and 15 corsages for 
about $160, which comes to $5.33 a piece. If you don’t need that 
many, you can always use the materials from the extras to make 
your own bouquets or other decorations. (Remember that places 
like Costco and Sam’s Club charge either a membership fee or 
a premium of between 15 percent and 20 percent if you’re not a 
member, so these options are most cost-effective if you’re already 
a member.)
Start your search for the perfect wedding-party flowers by looking 
at what everybody’s wearing. Unless you’re getting white roses 
for everyone (white roses go with just about anything), it’s nearly 
impossible to pick out flowers that will work no matter what 
clothes a person is wearing. After you have the wardrobe nailed 
down, you can select in-season, locally grown flowers in colors 
that will look good on each person. And be sure to choose arrange-
ments that are appropriate to your venue and that don’t require a 
lot of labor.
Bridesmaids don’t have to carry flowers; like the bride, they can 
carry pretty much anything. Some brides have their attendants 
carry small purses, bouquets of antique buttons, or, for a winter 
wedding, faux fur muffs.
Arranging flowers for 
the ceremony venue
Ceremony flowers — including altar flowers and floral pew 
decorations — average $286. But you can trim that cost by doing 
the following:
 
✓ Use inexpensive flowers and greens to fill out larger decora-
tions. If you’re getting married in a church or other large cer-
emony site, you may want to opt for large floral arrangements 
for the altar; small arrangements will be lost in all the space. 
However, because no one but the wedding party will see your 
altar arrangements up close, you can fill them with inexpen-
sive flowers and greens, such as carnations, ferns, and phlox.
 
✓ Share the decorations expense with another couple. If 
another couple (or two) is getting married at the same venue 
on the same day as you and your betrothed, you may be able 
to share ceremony decorations and split the cost, which 
could be a huge money-saver. Ask at the church’s adminis-
trative office or ask the venue’s on-site coordinator how to 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
116
get in contact with the other couple(s); some will make the 
initial contact, and others will give you contact information. 
You may have to use mostly white flowers and decorations to 
avoid clashing with different color schemes, but if you’re flex-
ible on this point, you can save quite a bit of money.
 
✓ Skip pew or chair decorations. Guests won’t miss them, and 
you’ll save money.
 
✓ Grow your own potted flowers or plants for decorations. Of 
course, doing so takes some time (and a bit of a green thumb), 
but it’s less expensive than having a florist create displays, 
and you can enjoy the flowers or plants at home long after 
your wedding.
 
✓ Rely on existing decorations, especially around the holi-
days. If your wedding falls around a holiday — Christmas, 
Easter, or even Thanksgiving — the venue may already be 
decorated, so you won’t have to provide flowers or other dec-
orations. Also, if your ceremony venue is ornate, you can cut 
back dramatically on decorations and let the existing architec-
ture and artwork shine.
 
Some brides keep a lid on their floral budgets by moving their cer-
emony flowers to the reception site. This flower swap is an option, 
but be aware of the downsides: Some flower arrangements don’t 
travel well, so you may end up with wilted or bruised blooms at 
your reception. Consider any delays for your guests, too; you don’t 
want them milling around outside the reception hall, griping about 
the delay while they wait for the flowers to be set up.
Deciding on reception flowers
Traditionally, couples purchase flower arrangements for the head 
table, the cake table, and each guest table. As you can imagine, this 
number of arrangements can increase your floral budget consider-
ably. In fact, the Wedding Report indicates that reception flower 
arrangements average $385; the Bridal Association of America 
reports that some floral centerpieces alone average $1,272. Of 
course, the more elaborate your arrangements and the more of 
them you have, the higher your bill.
The following sections outline some of the most common areas for 
flowers at the reception.
Centerpieces
The good news is that you don’t have to spend a lot of money 
on floral centerpieces to give your party a chic, elegant feel. 
Designers today are trending toward streamlined, simple-elegance 

 Chapter 8: Picking Flowers (Or Fun Alternatives) 117
arrangements. For example, here are some less expensive options 
you can try:
 
✓ A clear vase with a few blooms, perhaps surrounded by 
tealights or votive candles
 
✓ A bowl of floating blossoms, petals, or candles, or a combina-
tion of the three
 
✓ A pillar candle placed in the middle of the table with flower 
petals scattered over the tabletop. Just keep in mind that 
many venues don’t allow real flower petals to be placed on 
their tablecloths because they can stain the fabric; however, 
you can use artificial flowers or petals.
 
Many reception venues provide centerpieces, so if your venue 
offers something you like, don’t feel like you have to spend extra 
money to buy or make your own. By saving money on the center-
pieces, you can concentrate your floral/decoration budget on the 
cake table and head table.
For more alternatives to floral centerpieces, see Chapter 13.
Floral sprays for the head table
Floral sprays are commonly used to dress up the front of the head 
table; these wide, usually large, arrangements often have a holder 
in the center for the bride’s bouquet. Like bouquets, you can make 
sprays as simple or elaborate as you care to, but simpler is usually 
cheaper. To save some money on your spray, choose one that’s 
made of greenery accented with the occasional blossom. You also 
can use local and in-season flowers, which are less expensive — or 
even artificial flowers, which are cheaper yet.
Of course, you don’t have to use a spray, even if you have a tradi-
tional head table. Some couples find that sprays are inconvenient, 
leaving you and the wedding party little room to enjoy your meal. If 
you want some sort of decoration, but don’t want a spray, consider 
using ribbons, miniature lights, or big bows on the front of the table.
 
If your bridesmaids carry bouquets, save yourself some cash and 
have those bouquets do double duty as head table decorations. 
Tell your florist what you want to do; he’ll design the bouquets so 
they fit into holders on the front of the head table. If you decide 
to forego the traditional long head table and either sit with your 
wedding party at a round table or by yourselves at a small “sweet-
heart” table, you can use the bridal and bridesmaids’ bouquets as 
centerpieces. Your florist likely will provide small bouquet holders 
at the ceremony site that can serve as vases at your reception. 
(Just remember, if you’re creating your own bouquets, to include 
the holders on your supply list.)

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
118
Cake table flowers
Some couples choose to decorate their cake table with fresh flow-
ers and petals; others choose to trim the table with greenery and 
flowers. Because the cake is the focal point, floral and greenery 
decorations are merely accents; you don’t need anything elaborate 
(and therefore expensive). You can even eliminate this expense if 
you like.
 
You can decorate the cake itself with fresh flowers — a small vase 
of flowers as the cake topper, for example (which may be cheaper 
than a traditional cake topper), or flowers lining the base or 
arranged on the top of each tier. If you don’t want to fork over the 
cash for fresh flowers, you can use artificial flowers or other alter-
native decorations. Most bakers can make frosting flowers in dif-
ferent colors for you, and that option may be significantly cheaper 
than the fresh-flower route.
Ribbons also are a popular alternative; many brides choose to 
have their main cake “connected” to side cakes with ribbons in 
their wedding colors. You can scatter bows and pieces of ribbon 
on the tabletop, and drape wider ribbons and bows from the table 
edges to complete the look.
Choosing a Florist
As with all your wedding vendors, you want a florist who’s going 
to give you value for your money, especially if you’re on a budget. 
You want someone who will listen to your ideas, offer sensible 
alternatives, and stay within your budget.
 
Some florists admit to jacking up their prices if they sense that 
the couple or the couple’s family has a lot of money. So leave the 
expensive jewelry and designer suits at home when you meet with 
florists. Make sure whoever accompanies you doesn’t flash a lot of 
bling, either.
When looking for a florist, start your search by checking in with 
a local florist who has previously impressed you with reasonable 
prices and quality products. If you don’t have a local florist you 
like, do the following to find some candidates:
 
✓ Ask your friends and family for referrals.
 
✓ Check your local phone book.
 
✓ Do online searches for local florists at The Knot (www.the
knot.com) and My Wedding (www.mywedding.com).

 Chapter 8: Picking Flowers (Or Fun Alternatives) 119
 
✓ Attend bridal shows. Most exhibitors will have a combination 
of fresh arrangements and portfolios showing their work.
 
 If you find a florist you like at a bridal show, ask whether 
he offers a discount for signing a contract that day. You may 
be able to shave between 5 percent and 10 percent off the 
price. Just be sure to ask him the questions in the upcoming 
section first.
When you have a list of potential florists, follow up by interviewing 
the candidates and getting a written contract. I show you how in 
the upcoming sections.
Knowing what questions to ask
When you hire a florist, you aren’t just purchasing flowers from 
her; you’re also purchasing services. But florists differ widely 
in the level of service they provide. Full-service florists typically 
consult with you, order and arrange your flowers, deliver them 
to your ceremony and reception sites, and set them up. Discount 
florists often don’t do these things, and that means you have to 
make other arrangements for getting your flowers to your wedding 
venue and making sure they’re set up the way you want.
 
It’s essentially a trade-off between time and money. If you don’t 
want to add another task to your wedding-day to-do list, paying 
a full-service florist may be the best choice for you. On the other 
hand, if your budget is tight, saving a few dollars may be more 
important to you.
Here are some questions to ask when you’re interviewing florists:
 
✓ Who will actually be creating my arrangements? If you 
aren’t interviewing the person who will create (or supervise 
the creation of) your arrangements, make an additional 
appointment with that person at a later date; that way, there’s 
less room for misunderstandings about what you want.
 
✓ Does your price include delivery and setup? If not, find 
out how much extra those services cost, and make sure the 
charges are included in the contract (see “Getting the details 
in writing,” later in this chapter). If you’re responsible for 
picking up the flowers, make sure that’s spelled out in the 
contract, too. If delivery and setup are included, you may be 
able to negotiate a lower fee if you decide to do those things 
yourself.
 
✓ Have you decorated my venue before? If the florist isn’t 
familiar with your ceremony or reception location, ask 
whether she’ll make the time to visit it before your wedding. 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
120
If she says no, I suggest continuing your search; you may end 
up with arrangements that are out of scale with your venue, 
which is a waste of money.
 
✓ How long before my wedding will you deliver and setup the 
flowers? You want to make sure your flowers will be deliv-
ered and set up before the photographer arrives. Especially 
if you’re having formal photos taken before the wedding, you 
want to have your bouquet and other flowers ready.
 
 You may have to coordinate with your ceremony or reception 
site to make sure the florist can get in to set up the flowers 
early.
 
✓ What local flower growers do you work with? If the florist 
has business relationships with a variety of local produc-
ers, chances are better that your final bill will be within your 
budget. Why? Because locally grown blooms are less expen-
sive than exotic flowers that have to be shipped from far-away 
locations.
 
If, after interviewing your candidates and choosing one, you find 
that the price is right, you may want to consider using her for sev-
eral pieces of your wedding plan. Many florists go far beyond flow-
ers in their services; they may offer balloons, streamers, and other 
decorations as well. Some even rent tables and chairs for events.
Getting the details in writing
Any contract you sign with a florist — and you definitely want a 
contract — should include the following information:
 
✓ Detailed list of all the floral arrangements you’re buying, 
including size, color, and number of pieces (for example, 
three white rose boutonnieres)
 
✓ Acceptable flower substitutions in case your preferred flow-
ers aren’t available; also list any flowers you absolutely don’t 
want
 
✓ Itemized list of any other items the florist is supplying, such 
as vases, bouquet holders, balloons, trellises, and so on
 
✓ Logistical information, including where and when the flowers 
will be delivered (or picked up, if your florist doesn’t do deliv-
ery and setup); who’s responsible for ensuring site access and 
how (for example, you’ll deliver a key and a permission letter 
to the florist at least 24 hours before your wedding); and the 
name and cellphone number of the person who will do the 
setup as well as a backup phone number for the florist in case 
there are problems on your wedding day

 Chapter 8: Picking Flowers (Or Fun Alternatives) 121
 
✓ Total cost, including taxes and any extra fees (delivery, setup, 
and so on)
 
✓ Deposit and payment schedule and amounts
 
✓ Clear statement of the florist’s cancellation or refund policy
 
Make sure you get a copy of the contract; it should be signed and 
dated by both you and the florist and should have no blank lines.
Keeping Your Floral Costs Down
Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to cut your flower costs. You can 
save money by purchasing only locally grown flowers that are in 
season. You can buy flowers in bulk and make your own bouquets 
and centerpieces. Or you can forgo fresh flowers altogether and 
use either artificial ones or creative (and low-cost) alternatives. I 
provide more information on these money-saving tips in the follow-
ing sections.
Going seasonal
In our global marketplace, you can get pretty much any kind of 
flower you want at any time of year — for a price. But you can save 
money by concentrating on flowers that are in season for your 
wedding.
Some flowers, like roses, baby’s breath, carnations, orchids, and 
calla lilies, are available year-round, and their prices don’t really 
fluctuate much with the seasons. But others are much cheaper in 
season. Here are some common wedding flowers and the seasons 
in which they’re available in the United States at the lowest cost:
 
✓ Spring: Anemones, daffodils, delphiniums, hyacinths, lilies, 
peonies, sweet peas, and tulips
 
✓ Summer: Asters, chrysanthemums, daisies, English lavender, 
forget-me-nots, hydrangea, irises, larkspur, lilies, zinnias
 
✓ Fall: Asters, chrysanthemums, dahlias, marigolds, zinnias
 
✓ Winter: Amaryllis, anemones, camellias, Casablanca lilies, 
daffodils, forget-me-nots, hollies, poinsettias, stargazer lilies, 
sweet peas, tulips
 
Nearly all flower prices, and especially prices for roses, go 
up during the first two weeks of February in the lead-up to St. 
Valentine’s Day. Flower prices also may be higher in the two or 
three weeks leading up to Mother’s Day.

Creating your own arrangements
More and more brides are buying flowers in bulk and creating their 
own bouquets, corsages, boutonnieres, and centerpieces. The 
Internet has helped this trend along in two ways:

Buying flowers in bulk
You can order bulk flowers from virtually anywhere and have 
them delivered to your door — in some cases, without even paying 
extra for shipping. You don’t have to go with an outfit you’ve 
never heard of, either. Costco (www.costco.com) and Sam’s Club 
(www.samsclub.com) both sell bulk flowers, as do other Internet 
retailers like Fresh Roses (www.freshroses.com). As of this writ-
ing, Sam’s Club has 100 or more roses starting for less than $100 
including shipping.
 
Your local florist may be willing to order bulk flowers for you, too. 
You may even be able to snag close-to-wholesale prices on those 
bulk orders. If necessary, you may be able to arrange for the florist 
to store your flowers until you’re ready to make your pieces as 
well. Storage is important, because most flowers need to be refrig-
erated to stay fresh-looking.
 
No matter where you buy your bulk flowers from, make sure you 
give yourself enough time to receive your order and make your 
bouquet, centerpieces, and so on. Depending on the vendor, that 
may mean placing your order three or four weeks before your 
wedding. And, when you buy bulk flowers, remember that you’re 
responsible for trimming them and keeping them alive and looking 
fresh for your wedding. You need appropriate storage space and a 
block of time to put together your arrangements — two essentials 
that often convince couples they’d rather spend the money on a 
professional florist.
Making your own floral projects
Even if you’ve never so much as arranged a vase of flowers before, 
plenty of online resources can help you make your own bouquets, 
centerpieces, and other decorations. The following Web sites can 
help you get started:
 
✓ Save-on-crafts (www.save-on-crafts.com) has both tutori-
als and supplies, but you may be able to get less-expensive 
supplies by shopping at your local craft, hobby, or dollar 
store.

 Chapter 8: Picking Flowers (Or Fun Alternatives) 123
 
✓ The Flower Exchange (www.theflowerexchange.com) has 
instructions for making bouquets, headpieces, corsages, and 
centerpieces.
 
✓ Do It Yourself Weddings (www.do-it-yourself-weddings.
com) has photos and instructions for centerpieces.
 
✓ eHow (www.ehow.com) has step-by-step instructions for 
making bridal and bridesmaids’ bouquets and a list of sup-
plies you need for each bouquet. The site also has a selection 
of how-to videos.
 
✓ About.com (weddings.about.com) provides helpful how-to 
articles and videos on floral arrangements
 
✓ YouTube (www.youtube.com) has how-to videos from sev-
eral sources, including Martha Stewart.
If you prefer one-on-one instruction, check with craft stores in your 
area to see whether they offer classes or seminars; many do. Some 
craft stores also have instruction sheets for various projects.
 
The more practice you can get, the better — especially if you’ve 
never made bouquets or other floral arrangements before. Use 
inexpensive artificial flowers to experiment with styles, and when 
you come up with one you like, take pictures of it so you can re-
create it with real flowers for your wedding.
Considering alternatives 
to fresh flowers
Flowers may be a wedding tradition, but the wedding police aren’t 
going to arrest you if you decide to do something different. In 
fact, if you or your betrothed suffer from allergies, fresh flowers 
just may not be practical. That’s okay, and quite in keeping with 
today’s trends. These days, more couples are using alternatives as 
they try to keep costs down while still expressing their personali-
ties in their weddings.
Artificial flowers, of course, are the obvious choice for the allergy-
prone bud lover, and today’s artificial flowers are a far cry from 
the tacky plastic creations of days gone by. Craft stores are stuffed 
to the rafters with an incredible variety of real-looking artificial 
flowers and greens, perfect for making your own bouquets, cen-
terpieces, and other decorations. If you aren’t savvy with flower 
arranging, you can use the Web sites in the preceding section, 
“Making your own floral projects,” for guidance.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
124
You can make your own artificial flowers, too. At eHow (www.
ehow.com), you can find step-by-step instructions, including 
supply lists, for making things like satin roses and origami flowers.
No rule says that a bouquet — or a centerpiece — has to be made 
of flowers at all. Brides today are carrying bouquets made of feath-
ers, crystals, candy, antique buttons, and even origami birds.
Try incorporating a hobby into your bouquet and decorations. 
If you love poetry, for example, you can fashion a bouquet from 
scrolls of faux parchment paper with some of your favorite lines 
inscribed in an ink that complements your color scheme. Following 
the poetry theme, pew decorations could be posies of feathered 
pens from the dollar store, and centerpieces could comprise note-
pads, pens, and a small basket so guests can leave notes for you.
Or ditch the bouquet idea altogether and carry a fan, a small para-
sol, a loved one’s Bible, a rosary, or even a fancy clutch or evening 
bag. Some brides who have a unity candle in their ceremony walk 
down the aisle with a lit candle, instead of placing it on the altar. 
Irish custom calls for the bride to carry a horseshoe for good luck 
(with the open end up, so the luck doesn’t fall out); the horseshoe 
is then hung over the newlyweds’ door for continued good fortune. 
The Offbeat Bride (offbeatbride.com) has a gallery of bouquet 
substitutes other brides have chosen for their weddings; maybe 
their ideas will inspire a great idea for you. To see the gallery, go to 
offbeatbride.com/2009/03/wedding-bouquets#referrer.
 
You could opt to carry nothing, too, of course. (Talk about saving 
money!) But many people get nervous when they’re the center of 
attention, and carrying something down the aisle gives you some-
thing to do with your hands.

Videography

I
f you’re like most couples, photography is the one area where 
you don’t want to skimp on your wedding budget. After all, 
photos (and, if you choose, videos) will be around long after the 
last morsel of wedding cake has been savored. You may fondly 
remember your great-aunt Mildred on the rare occasions when you 
break out the silver-plated chafing dish she gave you as a wedding 
gift, but only photos can bring back the full glory of your ceremony 
and celebration. And only videos can capture the sounds and 
movement of the day.
I’m sure you’ve heard plenty of the many horror stories of couples 
who hired cut-rate photographers or videographers — or enlisted 
the family Ansel Adams–wannabe — with disastrous results. 
Wedding photos and videos are irreplaceable. If your photogra-
pher or videographer doesn’t get the shot on the day, it’s lost 
forever. So, if having these photos or videos is important to you, 
you need to devote an adequate portion of your wedding budget to 
professionals or skilled amateurs who are sure to deliver beautiful 
mementos of your big day.
However, you shouldn’t blindly pay whatever a professional asks. 
You can easily save money without sacrificing the quality you 
deserve. In this chapter, I show you how to choose a photographer 
and videographer you can afford — where to look, what questions 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
126
to ask, and what to beware of. I also give you ideas for getting your 
guests involved and making sure everyone has an opportunity to 
see the photos they take.
Deciding What Kinds of Photos 
and Videos You Want
 
No matter how much you spend to capture memories of your wed-
ding day, it’s a waste of money if you don’t get the kind of photos 
or video you want. So before you start interviewing photographers 
and videographers — even before you set your budget for these 
professionals — you and your spouse-to-be should talk about what 
you want to see in your wedding album.
There are no wrong answers here. It’s simply a matter of what 
you prefer. My husband and I, for example, didn’t want formal, 
traditional photos; that wasn’t our style. So we hired a photogra-
pher from the newspaper I worked for at the time and asked him 
to chronicle our ceremony and reception as they happened. My 
friend Jill, on the other hand, has more traditional tastes, so she 
chose a photographer who was skilled at setting up formal shots.
The same is true for video: You simply have to decide what type 
of video memories you want to have when the day is done. I chose 
not to spend the money for a professional videographer, but your 
priorities may be different. And, depending on what you plan to 
do with your wedding video — if you intend to post it online, for 
example, or present copies to friends and relatives — you may 
decide it’s worth the cost to hire a pro.
I provide you with a rundown of the photo and video options in the 
following sections.
Selecting from the many 
photography styles
When you and your honey sit down to talk about what you’d like 
your wedding album to look like, you have lots of photography 
styles to choose from. Generally, from least to most expensive, 
your options include the following:
 
✓ Candid shots: These are photos taken as things happen. In 
fact, the people in the photos often aren’t even aware that 
anyone’s taking a picture. If you ask your guests to take 

 Chapter 9: Capturing It for Posterity 127
pictures during your ceremony or reception (see “Getting 
Your Guests Involved” later in this chapter), most of them will 
take candids.
 
✓ Photojournalism style: This style of photography chronicles 
an event as it happens, without any posed or staged shots. The 
main difference between candids and photojournalism is that 
candid shots typically are taken by amateur photographers, 
while photojournalism denotes a professional. In recent years, 
photojournalism has become a hot trend for wedding photogra-
phy. (Bud and I didn’t know we were setting a trend!) However, 
some wedding experts bemoan the lack of formal, posed shots.
 
✓ Informal shots: Some wedding photographers take informal 
shots of intimate moments between members in the wedding 
party, such as the bride’s mother adjusting the bouquet, the 
groom and his father talking before the ceremony, or the maid 
of honor fixing the bride’s hair or dress. These shots often 
are staged rather than spontaneous; that is, the photographer 
asks the best man to look at his notes for the toast instead of 
capturing him doing it on his own.
 
 Informals usually are part of a photography package, but you 
should always ask potential photographers whether they take 
informal shots and whether they’re included in the pricing.
 
✓ Traditional style: Traditional wedding photography comprises 
the iconic wedding photos you’re probably most familiar with: 
the bride showing off her gown; the bride and groom posed at 
the altar or other location; and group shots of the wedding party 
and of the bride’s and groom’s families. Often these photos are 
taken at the ceremony site, but sometimes couples prefer to 
have their formal shots taken in a park or in another setting.
 
✓ Portraiture: This style of photography is the most formal, 
and the most expensive, option. It involves tons of equip-
ment: lights, backdrops, screens, and often at least a couple 
assistants to help the photographer get everything just right. 
In the U.S., portraits seem to be more popular in the South, 
but they’re a tradition for many families across the country. 
Sometimes a bride has a portrait taken four to six weeks 
before the wedding; it’s then enlarged (usually to 16 inches by 
20 inches, but sometimes larger), framed, and displayed at the 
reception. These bridal portraits can cost as little as $500 and 
as much as $2,000, depending on the size and the framing.
 
If you’re considering a bridal portrait, remember to factor the extra 
expenses into your budget. Those expenses may be for more than 
just the portrait, too: If you want your hair and makeup done pro-
fessionally, you’ll have to budget for those expenses. And, depend-
ing on when you order your wedding dress, you may have to pay a 
“rush” fee to have it in time for the portrait.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
128
You aren’t limited to just one style of photography. You can hire a 
traditional wedding photographer to take formal shots of the wed-
ding party and families, for example, and then hire a photojournal-
ist to shoot the reception — or ask the family shutterbug to get 
certain shots at the reception. Or you can seek out a photojournal-
ist who also captures posed shots. If you and your betrothed have 
trouble agreeing on the kind of photos to go with, these options 
can be good compromises.
 
Photography contracts often include an exclusivity clause — that 
is, you promise not to hire another photographer for the same 
event. I’d argue that the ceremony and reception are separate 
events, so you’re perfectly free to hire separate photographers 
if you choose. But make sure the limits of each photographer’s 
“exclusivity” are spelled out clearly in the contracts.
Considering video options
Unlike still photography, video style lies mostly in the editing, not 
in how the raw footage is shot. That said, you can choose what you 
want to have on video. Here are some options, from least to most 
expensive:
 
✓ No video
 
✓ Video of the ceremony only
 
✓ Video of the reception only
 
✓ Video of the ceremony and highlights of the reception, such 
as toasts, your first dance, and so on
 
✓ A complete video record of your day, perhaps even including 
video interviews with or messages from guests and the wed-
ding party
 
Generally, the more video you have shot, the more it’ll cost you; 
even if the videographer uses a digital camcorder, you’ll probably 
pay for the time he spends shooting and editing.
You can hire a professional videographer or go with an amateur. 
Pros obviously cost more, but if video is a priority for you, it may 
be worth the price. On the other hand, if you just want a simple 
record of your special day, amateur videographers cost less — even 
nothing, if you have a relative or friend do it. However, remem-
ber that you may not get the final product you envision with an 
amateur; the quality of both the raw video and the editing may be 
lacking. The following sections outline the pros and cons of profes-
sionals and amateurs.

 Chapter 9: Capturing It for Posterity 129
Using a pro
A professional videographer charges anywhere from $1,000 to 
more than $10,000, depending on what kind of package you buy. 
The advantage to using a pro is in the quality of the video; it’s 
unlikely a pro will miss important moments, and sophisticated 
editing can make your wedding video look like an entry in the 
Sundance Film Festival — a pleasure to watch again and again.
 
You may find a videographer who charges less than the average 
for your area, but remember the adage, “You get what you pay 
for.” Like other wedding vendors, the best professional videogra-
phers often are booked a year or more in advance, and prices tend 
to be higher for the most in-demand dates. If a videographer is will-
ing to shoot your Saturday-evening-in-June wedding for less than 
$1,000, he may not be able to deliver the quality you expect.
Professional equipment is less cumbersome than ever, so you don’t 
need to worry about bulky cameras, lights, and microphones getting 
in the way. (Of course, this lightweight, high-tech equipment costs 
big bucks, which is one reason pros are fairly expensive.)
Going with an amateur
If your budget is tight, or if video isn’t a high priority for you, you 
may want to ask a friend or relative to videotape your ceremony 
and reception for you. You can buy good-quality hand-held digital 
video cameras for about $250, and these cameras are generally as 
easy to use as digital still cameras. You may be able to rent one for 
even less; look in your local phone book for video recorders and 
players.
 
With Windows Moviemaker for PCs or iMovie for Apple computers, 
you can do a fair amount of editing to create a presentation video 
instead of just settling for the raw footage.
The downside of going with an amateur, of course, is that the qual-
ity of the video may be poor — wobbly or jerky, out of focus, or 
filled with annoyingly unnecessary pans and zooms. The audio 
quality also may be poor; professional videographers often use 
wireless microphones to capture vows, toasts, and other spoken 
moments, but your Uncle Fred’s video camera may miss those 
audio cues and instead pick up the motorcycle roaring by outside.
 
The less experience your amateur videographer has, the worse 
your video quality will be. If possible, choose an amateur who 
makes videography a serious hobby, and pass over the person 
who’s only taken home videos of their children or pets.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
130
A tripod eliminates much of the wobble of hand-held video. For 
the ceremony, have your amateur videographer set up a tripod 
in an unobtrusive place where she can capture all or most of the 
important parts of your ceremony. For example, you might place 
the camera next to the aisle in the front pew at the church or to 
one side in back of the altar. Some churches allow you to use the 
choir area for this; others don’t allow any video or photography 
equipment behind the altar, so check with your officiant or church 
coordinator.
 
Be sure to place the camera so it won’t get in the way of your still 
photographer — a tripod is less than romantic when it shows up in 
the best shot of your first kiss as husband and wife.
Choosing Photographers and 
Videographers You Can Afford
You can hire a photographer or videographer to fit almost any 
budget. On the low end, these services generally begin at around 
$1,000 (that’s $1,000 each for a photographer and a videographer). 
Much of the cost depends on how fancy and extensive you want 
to get with your wedding photos and videos. Here are the general 
guidelines to keep in mind:
 
✓ Photography: Costs generally increase as the photographer 
spends more time and takes more pictures at your wedding. 
Costs also increase as you order more prints (more on this 
cost in the later section “Negotiating a good deal”).
 
✓ Video: Costs typically go up as you get fancier with the edit-
ing; skillful editing is a time-consuming process, requiring 
both the equipment and the artistic talent to produce a qual-
ity final video. The amount of time the videographer spends 
with you also may affect the pricing.
 
Photographers and videographers who work out of their homes or 
modest studios typically charge less than those with big fancy stu-
dios in the heart of town. Remember that those plush carpets and 
leather couches cost the photographer or videographer money, 
and he’s going to figure those overhead costs into his prices.
In the following sections, I guide you through the process of choos-
ing professionals to capture your wedding on camera, including 
finding referrals, interviewing candidates, and negotiating a 
contract.

 Chapter 9: Capturing It for Posterity 131
Beginning your search
When you’ve decided what kind of photography and video (if any) 
you want for your wedding, you can start shopping around for 
photographers and videographers who create the kind of visual 
memories you’re looking for. Most wedding experts recommend 
that you interview at least three photographers or videographers, 
but you have to find them first. (I tell you more about interviewing 
them in the later section, “Interviewing candidates.”) You can look 
for candidates in all kinds of places, but not all of them will yield 
satisfactory results. I recommend structuring your search in the 
order of the following sections.
 
If you live in or near a large metropolitan area, expand your search 
to the suburbs. Photographers and videographers in smaller com-
munities often charge less, because they have lower overhead 
costs. Even if you have to pay them mileage to travel to your wed-
ding site, you may still reap significant savings.
Asking family and friends for referrals
Many of the best photographers and videographers don’t advertise; 
they rely on word of mouth to build their businesses. If you know 
any recently married couples, ask them about their photographer 
and videographer — whether they were pleased with the results, 
whether they liked them personally (no matter what you think, 
personality is important — see “Finding a good match” later in this 
chapter), and whether they felt they received value for their money. 
If you feel comfortable doing so, ask the couple how much their pho-
tographer and videographer charged and what the prices included.
Searching online
The Internet has made finding professional photographers and 
videographers easier than ever. Here are some sites to get you 
started:
 
✓ Professional Photographers of America (www.ppa.com): At 
this Web site, you can search by geographic location, and you 
also can narrow your search by specialty. If you want to track 
down a photographer recommended by someone else, you 
can search by name and studio as well.
 
✓ Wedding and Portrait Photographers (www.wppionline.
com): This site allows you to search photographers by loca-
tion and specialty.
 
✓ Wedding and Events Videographers Association 
International (www.weva.com): At this site, you submit your 
e-mail address and information about your event, and then an 
association member responds to your request.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
132
Only pros who are members of the organizations listed in these 
bullet points are included in any searches you conduct on these 
sites. The upside of this is that members typically are interested in 
keeping their skills and equipment up to date. The downside is that 
membership doesn’t necessarily mean a particular photographer 
or videographer is right for you.
One additional Web site you may want to try is craigslist (www.
craigslist.org). Many local — and affordable — photographers 
and videographers post ads on craigslist; click on the city or state 
in which you want to search, and then go to Services/Creative to 
read ads from local photographers and videographers. You also 
can post a help wanted ad under Gigs/Creative.
 
Just as important as knowing where to start your online search is 
knowing where not to look online. Whatever you do, don’t look for 
a photographer or videographer on online wedding advertising 
sites or print wedding ad “magazines.” These outlets have a shady 
reputation among professionals, and the best candidates don’t 
waste their marketing budget on advertising in these resources. 
Also steer clear of “featured photographers” on wedding planning 
sites; photographers often pay tons of money to “earn” this slot, 
which means they’re featured because of their deep pockets, not 
because of their skill or talent.
Contacting your local newspaper
Most news photographers do freelance work on the side, and many 
of them are old hands at photographing weddings. A bonus: Local 
news photographers often are much cheaper — and give you more 
for your money — than traditional wedding photographers. Hiring 
a news photographer is a good option if you decide you want a 
photojournalism approach to your wedding pictures. (Refer to 
the earlier section, “Selecting from the many photography styles,” 
for more information on the photojournalism approach.) Some 
photojournalists do posed shots, so you may be able to get a mix 
of styles from one photographer. Or you can hire a less expensive 
photographer to do your traditional shots.
You may be able to find a photojournalist who’s skilled in videog-
raphy at your local newspaper as well. The idea may seem counter-
intuitive, but more and more newspapers are expanding their Web 
sites to include video, which means more and more still photogra-
phers are learning the ropes as videographers.
 
As tempting as it may be to save money by hiring one person to 
take both still shots and video, don’t do it. It’s nearly impossible 
for one person to take both the video and still shots of important 
moments, and you’ll end up disappointed in your pictures, your 
video, or both.

 Chapter 9: Capturing It for Posterity 133
Checking out local colleges
If your area university or community college has a photography 
or film program, you may be able to find a student to shoot your 
wedding at a fraction of the cost of a professional. The trade-off is 
in experience; there are lots of important moments to capture at 
a wedding, and if you hire a newbie, you run the risk of her miss-
ing some of those shots. On the other hand, students often bring a 
fresh, creative element that veterans may lack. Depending on the 
student’s equipment and experience, you can expect to pay a quar-
ter to half of what you’d pay a pro.
To find a student, contact the school’s department or program 
office (usually available on the school’s Web site) and tell them 
what you’re looking for. They can tell you whether they do this 
sort of referral and help you arrange next steps.
 
You should meet student photographers and videographers in 
person, just as you would professionals. For one thing, you want 
to gauge how well you and the student will get along on your wed-
ding day. For another, you want to discuss the kinds of shots and 
overall style you want — and see whether the student listens and 
understands, or goes off into his own vision of how he wants to 
shoot your wedding.
Attending bridal shows
Bridal shows are a great place to start your list if you just arrived 
in town and don’t know a soul, but you should never hire a photog-
rapher or videographer based solely on what she displayed at one 
of these events.
 
Some wedding experts put bridal shows at the top of their “in 
search of” list for vendors, but they’re really a good option only 
if none of the others listed in this chapter pan out. Why? Because 
bridal shows only introduce you to what the photographer or vid-
eographer considers her best work; they don’t really give you the 
(pardon the pun) full picture of what she would do at your wed-
ding. They only give you an idea of that particular pro’s taste and 
style.
That said, if you’re unsure what kind of photos or video would suit 
you, you can get a feel for the different styles at bridal shows.
Interviewing candidates
Getting the names of possible photographers and videographers is 
only the beginning of your quest. You still have some homework to 
do. Here’s what you need to do:

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
134
 
✓ Review the professional’s work.
 
✓ Find out about his experience and what kind of equipment he 
uses by asking the right questions.
 
✓ Get a feel for the pro’s style and personality.
 
✓ Obtain pricing information you can actually use in comparing 
one candidate with another.
Make sure your interviews include each of these tasks, which I 
explain in the following sections.
 
Set up interviews by phone or e-mail, and try to meet at the pho-
tographer’s or videographer’s studio; that’s where you’re most 
likely to see a good cross section of the work. Don’t try to hire 
someone over the phone without reviewing the work; you’re likely 
to be disappointed. Besides, you need to meet in person to draw 
up a written contract to head off any misunderstandings.
Reviewing the work
Never base your opinion of a photographer’s or videographer’s work 
on a “best of” portfolio (the kind you’re most likely to see at bridal 
shows, bridal shops, and other marketing locations). Instead, go to 
the studio and ask to see the albums or videos of entire weddings. 
You want to get a feel for both the type and quality of the shots.
 
Don’t get carried away by the special effects you may see in many 
photos or videos — things like sepia tones, star filters, superim-
posed shots, and the like. Those effects may cost money (and 
sometimes a lot of it). So when you’re reviewing a pro’s work, 
focus your attention on the shot itself, not the fripperies around it.
When reviewing still photography, check the following things:
 
✓ Exposure: Seeing many photos that are underexposed or 
overexposed indicates a lack of skill in different lighting condi-
tions. Processing can correct some of these issues, but you 
should consider poor exposure a red flag.
 
✓ Poses: Do the posed shots look awkward? Do the subjects 
look stiff or uncomfortable? Even in posed shots, you want 
your subjects to look relaxed, like they’re pleased to be in the 
moment. If they don’t, the photographer’s people skills may 
be lacking.
 
✓ Framing: A real pro will never frame a shot where it looks 
like you have a candelabra sprouting from your head. So pay 
attention to the backgrounds of the shots. Likewise, remem-
ber that the best shots include only what’s necessary to com-
plete the scene; a lot of extraneous scenery on the sides or in 
the foreground is a sure indication of an inexpert shot.

 Chapter 9: Capturing It for Posterity 135
 
If a photographer refuses to show you albums of complete wed-
dings, walk away and continue your search elsewhere. It’s not 
worth your time to figure out what she might be hiding.
When reviewing a pro’s videos, keep an eye on these elements:
 
✓ Technical quality: Look for sharp focus, good lighting, and a 
variety of tight and wide shots.
 
✓ Audio quality: Can you hear the celebrant and the vows 
clearly? If the video contains a musical score, does it over-
power the spoken parts?
 
✓ Storytelling: Even the best video in terms of technical qual-
ity can be painful to watch if the final product seems discon-
nected. Good videographers spend a great deal of time editing 
their raw footage to tell the story of a wedding in a seamless, 
easy-to-follow flow. However, remember that the more elabo-
rate the editing, the more expensive the video is likely to be, 
because you pay for the time the editing takes.
Many professional videographers post sample videos on their Web 
sites, and sometimes you’ll find testimonials from satisfied clients, 
too. Be aware, though, that this is a marketing tool, so you’re only 
going to see videos that the pro is particularly proud of.
 
You’ll probably fast-forward through most of the videos you watch, 
but don’t be shy about watching or even replaying the segments 
that are important to you. Ask to watch two or three videos, so you 
can get a good feel for what this videographer likes to produce.
Asking the right questions
When you interview photographers and videographers, you need to 
know a few things before you decide which one to hire. Be sure to ask 
these questions (in addition to any others that may occur to you):
 
✓ Who will actually take the photos or video? Ask whether the 
person you’re meeting with is the one who will be shooting 
your wedding; if not, ask to meet the person who will be there. 
For photographers, ask if he’ll have an assistant and whether 
the assistant also will take photos. For videographers, ask 
how many people will be in the crew.
 
 For both, ask whether the labor cost for the extra people is 
included in the package and whether you’re expected to pay 
any other expenses for them, such as mileage or meals.
 
✓ Is the work you’re seeing from the person(s) who will be at 
your wedding? Make sure you’re viewing samples from the 
pro you’re thinking of hiring — not a collection of the studio’s 
work. You want to see exactly what you’ll be receiving.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
136
 
 Don’t buy the line that all the photographers or videogra-
phers in a studio have the same training. Even if that state-
ment is true, it doesn’t mean that Annie’s work will have the 
same look and feel as John’s. Personality, talent, and creativ-
ity all affect the final product.
 
✓ What’s the cost structure? Make sure you understand hourly 
fees and the prices for prints, albums, and tapes or DVDs. 
Also be sure to know upfront what is and isn’t included in 
various packages. (See “Negotiating a Good Deal” later in this 
chapter for more details on costs.)
 
 Ask each candidate whether he offers a no-frills package, and 
then find out what it includes and what it costs compared to 
the fancier packages. For photographers, a no-frills package 
may include unretouched proofs and the negatives; for vid-
eographers, it may include a lightly edited version or simply 
the raw video.
 
✓ What will cost extra? This question allows you to confirm 
what’s covered in packages. Extras may include things like 
additional prints or tape copies, overtime pay if you ask the 
pro to stay longer than you contracted him for, parking and 
travel fees, and special effects for prints or video.
 
✓ What kind of equipment does the pro use? Ask the pro how 
many cameras he uses and about the format of those cameras 
(see the nearby sidebar “Understanding photo and video for-
mats”). Also ask about lighting and, for video, microphones. 
You want to get a feel for how cumbersome the equipment 
will be and whether it’ll interfere with your or your guests’ 
enjoyment of the day.
 
✓ How many proofs will you have to choose from? You gener-
ally want to have between 60 and 80 photos in your final wed-
ding album; it takes that many shots to tell the full story of 
an average wedding and reception. But you want 200 or more 
still shots to make your final selections from.
 
 For video, ask whether the videographer will cover the entire 
ceremony and reception, and whether he charges extra if you 
also want him to cover things like the rehearsal dinner and 
preparations on the day of the wedding.
 
 Ask whether the photographer/videographer charges extra 
for taking more pictures or video. Those who use digital 
equipment typically won’t charge more, because they don’t 
have to worry about using up film or tape. But these extra 
charges could add significantly to your final costs if your pro-
fessional uses physical film or tape.

 Chapter 9: Capturing It for Posterity 137
 
✓ Who owns the proofs/negatives/master tape/raw video? If 
the photographer or videographer retains ownership, you 
have to get all copies through him — and the cost will be sig-
nificantly higher than if you could make copies on your own. If 
you own the negatives or raw video, you can shop around for 
the best deal on professionally made copies. Refer to the later 
section, “Negotiating a good deal” for more on haggling with 
the photographer to purchase the original materials.
 
✓ How long does it take to get the final prints, albums, or 
tapes after the wedding? Don’t be surprised if the answer is 
three or four months; that’s pretty common. But be wary if 
you don’t get a firm delivery timeline, or if the timeline seems 
excessively long.
 
✓ What kind of deposit does the photographer or videogra-
pher require? Also find out whether the deposit is refundable 
(in case you find another pro you like better) and how much 
notice is required to get your deposit refunded.
Understanding photo and video formats
Technology is a wonderful thing, but it can be confusing when you’re deciding 
which format you want for your wedding. Photographers typically use one (or more) 
of the following three formats:
 ✓ 35 mm film: This format is inexpensive to process, but because the negatives 
are small, enlargements bigger than 8 x 10 can look grainy.
 ✓ Medium format, or 21/4 film: This format is better for enlargements because the 
negatives are bigger; you don’t lose sharpness the way you do with 35 mm film. 
Medium format also produces richer colors than 35 mm.
 ✓ Digital: This format has become quite common, and new printers even produce 
photos that last just as long as traditional film prints.
A photographer’s base prices may not differ much among these different formats; 
after all, the equipment for all of them is expensive. You may save money on actual 
prints with digital or 35 mm, but, depending on your priorities, you may prefer to 
pay a little more for the richer colors and better enlargement quality of medium 
format.
Videographers have four common formats available to them. Betacam and digi-
tal video recorders produce broadcast-quality footage. A format called SVHS is 
the next best thing in terms of quality. And VHS is the standard consumer video 
format. Generally, VHS is the cheapest option, and Betacam or digital video is 
more expensive.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
138
 
✓ Are you expected to feed the photographer or videographer 
and assistants? Believe it or not, this sometimes turns up in 
the contract, and it definitely affects your budget. If you’re 
paying $20 or more a plate for dinner, a couple extra mouths 
can add up fast. I’m not saying you shouldn’t feed them — 
if they’re spending the entire day with you, you certainly 
should. But you do need to know how many meals you have 
to provide and how many people you have to provide them 
for if you want to stick to your budget.
 
 If you do provide meals for the photographer and video grapher 
(and crew, if there is one), talk to the caterer or the coordinator 
at your reception site about arranging a less expensive meal for 
them. You also may want to arrange for the photographer and 
videographer to eat before your reception officially gets under 
way, so they’ll be available to shoot important moments like 
your entrance, your first dance, and so on.
Finding a good match
You’ll be spending a lot of time with your photographer or videog-
rapher on your wedding day, and it’ll be much more enjoyable for 
everyone if you and your professional share a vision of what you 
want the record of your wedding to look like.
 
Personality matters, too; you probably won’t be happy with the 
most talented photographer in the world if her personality gets 
on your nerves. So it’s important to conduct your interviews in 
person; you just can’t get a good feel for how you’ll get along 
through e-mail or over the phone.
During your interview, ask the photographer or videographer 
these two questions to judge whether you’ve found a good match:
 
✓ What do you think are the most important elements to cap-
ture at a wedding? This question isn’t so much about making 
sure she gets the first dance on film as it is about affinities. 
Some photographers may be more interested in the staging 
and décor; others may be more interested in the human inter-
action. If her priorities don’t match yours, you probably want 
to continue your search.
 
 Professionals will ask you for a shot list, which is a written 
note of the photos or scenes you want them to shoot (and, 
sometimes, what you want them to avoid — especially if you 
have a camera-hog friend or relative). Even if you choose an 
amateur, you should prepare a shot list to make sure she 
doesn’t miss important shots.

 Chapter 9: Capturing It for Posterity 139
 
✓ What are your favorite kinds of shots? If you’re looking for a 
traditional feel and the photographer or videographer prefers 
to shoot offbeat poses or unusual scenes, no one is likely to 
be happy with the end result.
Comparing packages and pricing
Ideally, of course, every photographer and videographer would 
offer the same packages so you could easily see who provides 
the better value. Unfortunately, that’s not the way it works. 
Photography and videography packages can vary greatly, and 
that can make it difficult to figure out which deal is best for you. 
Following are two methods to help you make comparison shopping 
easier:
 
✓ Ask each candidate for a list of a la carte prices. These lists 
tell you how much each item would cost if you decided to pur-
chase a set number of prints or copies rather than one of the 
packages. Remember that cheaper packages may not include 
everything you want or need. Use the a la carte price list to 
come up with the cost of your own ideal package, and then 
compare photographers’ packages to see which ones come 
closest to meeting your needs.
 
✓ Make a list of the items in each candidate’s package and 
assign a number value — say, from 1 to 5 — to each ele-
ment. For example, if having the film negatives is important to 
you, you’d put a 5 next to that part of a photographer’s pack-
age. If the leather-covered album isn’t a priority for you, you’d 
put a 1 next to that. Ranking elements in this way allows you 
to see which candidate offers more of the things that matter 
most to you.
Negotiating a good deal
Photographers and videographers have to eat and pay their bills 
just like anybody else, so most of them structure their pricing to 
ensure that they can cover their expenses (including investment in 
equipment) and be reasonably compensated for their time, talent, 
and expertise. Still, you may be able to negotiate certain aspects of 
the contract.
 
Know the going rate for your area before you open negotiations. 
This information helps you judge how reasonable a given pro’s 
prices are and can give you an idea of how much of a price break 
you may be able to get.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
140
Some areas that may be open to haggling include the following:
 
✓ Getting a lower rate for an off-peak wedding date: If you’re 
getting married on a Saturday in June, you can’t expect a 
break on rates, because this is high-demand time for all wed-
ding vendors. But for a Thursday afternoon in August or a 
Saturday morning in January, you may be able to negotiate 
a lower rate because it’s less likely that the photographer or 
videographer will be able to book a gig at his full price. (Refer 
to Chapter 3 for more on choosing off-peak wedding dates.)
 
✓ Buying a la carte services instead of a package: Most wed-
ding photographers and videographers have a variety of 
packages to choose from; very few offer a la carte pricing up 
front. However, if the packages don’t meet your needs or your 
budget, ask about picking and choosing the services you do 
want. For example, you may hire the photographer or videog-
rapher for the ceremony only, instead of for the entire day.
 
✓ Purchasing the negatives or master video: You may pay a 
premium for these originals, because many photographers 
and videographers earn a good portion of their income from 
selling prints and copies of the video. However, if you can 
negotiate the purchase of the originals, you’ll still likely save 
money in the long run; if you have the negatives and master 
video, you can make your own copies for a fraction of the 
price. Plus, you don’t have to worry about tracking down the 
photographer or videographer years later if your own prints 
or video copies are lost or damaged.
 
 If you do buy the negatives or master video, be sure to store 
them properly. Heat and moisture can damage film, video-
tapes, CDs, and DVDs. Keep them in a cool, dry place, pref-
erably in a fire-safe container. You also can keep them in a 
safe-deposit box (and you may be able to deduct the rental 
fee on your income taxes if you itemize).
 
✓ Buying the photography proofs: You can save money on 
prints by arranging to buy the photography proofs and using 
them to fill gaps in your wedding album or to send mementos 
to family and friends. The proofs won’t have the same fully 
polished look of retouched prints, but most professional 
proofs are good enough.
 
✓ Combining orders: Your photographer or videographer may 
be willing to offer a discount if you place one large order 
instead of having friends and relatives all place their own 
separate orders.

 Chapter 9: Capturing It for Posterity 141
 
 Ask if your photos or video will be posted online. Many pros 
offer this feature, which allows your family and guests to look 
through the photos (or get a preview of the finished video) 
and decide whether they want to buy copies. If you’re offered 
a discount for combining orders, you can then send the link 
to your friends and family along with a deadline for placing an 
order with you.
 
✓ Getting a discount for cash. If you can pay cash, ask for a 
discount. When you pay cash, the photographer or videogra-
pher doesn’t have to pay the fee that credit card companies 
charge businesses for each transaction, and he doesn’t have 
to wonder whether a check will bounce. Just remember to get 
a receipt for any cash you hand over.
 
✓ Buying albums elsewhere. If a package includes a photo 
album, ask how much the price would drop if you bought your 
own. You can always tell the photographer that you don’t 
care for the album choices he offers. Many retailers carry 
lovely photo albums at a fraction of the price of traditional 
wedding albums from the photographer.
 
When you negotiate a contract with any vendor, remember that 
the worst that can happen is that he’ll say “no.” Give the photog-
rapher or videographer a chance to explain why something isn’t 
negotiable; it may give you a better idea of whether others might 
be willing to give in a little. If, for example, the response is, “I don’t 
negotiate,” you may be able to find a better deal elsewhere. But if 
the response is more about the pro’s own costs, it may not be rea-
sonable to expect a price break from him or any other candidate.
Getting Your Guests Involved
Your guests are going to take pictures whether you ask them to 
or not, so why not take advantage of the additional record of your 
wedding?
Many couples provide disposable cameras at the reception to 
encourage their guests to take photos. Often the problem is that 
the guests take the cameras with them, and the happy couple 
never gets to see the pictures.
You have a couple of ways around losing out on the cameras. You 
can ask a member of your wedding party to be in charge of collect-
ing them at the end of the reception. (You’ll likely still lose some, 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
142
however, because not every guest will stay until the very end). Or 
you can ask your guests to have the film developed and post the 
pictures online so everyone can see them.
 
With photo-sharing sites like Flickr (www.flickr.com), Shutterfly 
(www.shutterfly.com), and Kodak Gallery (www.kodakgallery
.com), you and your guests can share photos for free. The Kodak 
site even lets you order prints and specialty items like photo mugs, 
T-shirts, and other keepsakes.
You also can ask your guests to share their photos by lending you 
the memory cards from their digital cameras. If you have access 
to a laptop computer, you can assign someone to download the 
memory cards right at the reception; then you don’t have to worry 
about keeping track of which memory card belongs to whom or 
about having to return the cards to their owners. Alternatively, 
you can appoint someone to collect the cards and make sure each 
one has the owner’s name and address. After you have the photos, 
you can post them online and invite your guests to view them.
 
Here’s one caveat about having your guests take photos: Especially 
in dimly lit sites, multiple flashes can ruin the shots your profes-
sional photographer or videographer is trying to take. Ask your 
guests to refrain from taking flash pictures during your ceremony.
At the reception, try setting up a photo corner — maybe even with 
a fun backdrop — where your guests can flash away without inter-
fering with the pros.
 
Although lots of digital cameras also have video capabilities, I 
don’t recommend encouraging your guests to take their own video 
of your ceremony or reception. For one thing, it’s difficult enough 
to keep snapshot-happy guests out of the photographer’s way; you 
don’t want to have to police your guests’ behavior around the vid-
eographer, too. For another, inexpert video is just plain painful to 
watch. So, unless you want amateur videos of your wedding posted 
on YouTube, don’t encourage your guests to take video. (Some 
probably will do it anyway, of course.)

Putting It in Print: Invitations, 
Programs, and Miscellany
In This Chapter

▶ Assessing the various costs involved in printing invitations
▶ Dealing with programs, save-the-dates, and other paper goods
▶ Using your creativity to make your own printed materials
M
any couples are surprised at how much wedding invitations 
can cost, and especially at how quickly seemingly small 
extras — like having your return address printed on the back flap 
of the envelope — can add up.
The average cost for 100 invitations is around $225 to $250. If you 
choose an expensive printing option, such as engraving or hand 
calligraphy, costs can easily shoot into the $1,500 to $2,000 range.
Fortunately, couples looking to save money on their printed mate-
rials have plenty of options. In this chapter, I explain those options 
and give you ideas for trimming costs on every piece of printing 
you need for your dream wedding.
 
Invitations should be mailed six to eight weeks before the wedding, 
so start your search for the perfect, affordable invitation at least 
three or four months in advance. See Chapter 3 and Appendix A for 
more on getting your wedding planning timeline in order.
Shopping for the Best Deals
You have many more purchasing choices for invitations than your 
parents did. But that can be a double-edged sword. Sure, you 
can order invitations and all the accessories you want for a song, 

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
144
but you may sacrifice quality. Worse, if you go with a catalog or 
Internet company, you may not find out about a problem until you 
have your invitations in hand.
 
Regardless of where you buy your invitations, the pricing structure 
is usually a la carte. That means you pay a base price for invita-
tions and envelopes, and virtually everything else — from special 
printing processes to inserts — costs extra.
Here are some things to keep in mind when you’re comparing ven-
dors and prices:
 
✓ Buy for the number of households, not the total number of 
guests. Forgetting this guideline and ordering twice as many 
invitations as you need is a common mistake, and one I made 
myself. Most of your guests will likely be couples, so you need 
only one invitation per address. The exception is when you 
invite an adult who lives at the same address as a couple (your 
college-age nephew, for example, who still lives at home). In 
that case, the couple receives one invitation, and the other 
adult guest at the same address receives a separate invitation.
 
✓ Round your order to the next lot size. Invitations are usu-
ally sold in lots of 25, 50, or 100, and the price per invitation 
is usually lower for larger lot sizes. If your guest list has 130 
people, order 150 invitations. You’ll save money in the long 
run because you’ll have extra invitations if you need them; if 
you have to go back and order extras, you’ll pay a hefty fee 
because the company likely will treat it as a new order.
 
✓ Extra envelopes cost extra. Don’t assume that the printer will 
throw in extra envelopes; most of them, including catalog-
based and online print services, charge extra. It’s worth it, 
though, because who hasn’t made a mistake once or twice in 
writing an address? Order enough envelopes to cover your 
guest list, plus an extra pack of 25 (the way envelopes are 
typically packaged).
 
Skip the foil-lined envelopes, especially if money is tight. They’re 
a nice detail, but they add to your costs. Besides, your guests will 
never miss them.
The following sections list the pros and cons of various types of 
invitation sources.
Bricks-and-mortar print shops
The main advantages to working with a local print shop include 
the following:

 Chapter 10: Putting It in Print 145
 
✓ The shop probably does a lot of wedding printing, so its 
employees can help you choose styles and even wording.
 
✓ Such shops usually let you take sample books home for a few 
days so you and your spouse-to-be can look over different 
invitation styles at your leisure.
 
The biggest disadvantage to traditional print shops is price. Most 
charge full retail for paper stock and special printing requests. 
However, they may offer price breaks on packages — if you pur-
chase your thank-you notes at the same time as your invitations, 
for example, or if you order a certain quantity.
Mail-order catalogs
Catalog companies cater to virtually every budget, although most 
of them are owned by the same parent company — a printing 
giant called Taylor Corporation. Not coincidentally, Taylor also 
owns many of the major invitation brands, including Carlson Craft, 
Celebration, and Royal.
 
Just because many companies are owned by Taylor doesn’t mean 
you’ll pay the same price everywhere. You can find the same 
Taylor-made invitation in a mail-order catalog for half the price 
that a retail shop charges. You can find these deals in the follow-
ing Taylor-owned catalogs: Wedding Invitations by Rexcraft, Current, 
and The American Wedding. Check out www.catalogs.com to 
order free copies of these (and other) catalogs.
The variety in pricing is the biggest advantage of using mail-order. 
The main disadvantage is that you can’t see and touch the product 
unless you order samples, which may cost you. Timing also may 
be problematic, depending on whether you can fax proof changes 
instead of mailing them. And, if you aren’t sure how to word your 
invitation, you won’t have a store employee to help you.
Web sites
The Internet has exploded with printing sites in recent years. 
Again, Taylor Corporation owns most of the major ones, but as 
with mail-order catalogs, pricing is all over the board.
Some sites have virtual design studios that let you experiment with 
different papers, ink colors, and type styles, which is nice if you’re 
looking to create something that really complements your wed-
ding vision. And as with mail-order catalogs, some will send you 
physical samples, although you may have to pay for them. You can 
approve proofs online at many of these sites, too.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
146
Here are some sites worth checking out:
 
✓ Custom Shots (www.customshots.com) lets you upload 
photos to personalize your invitations.
 
✓ eInvite (www.einvite.com) has hundreds of invitation 
styles, including an eco-friendly category. Some styles run less 
than $1 a piece.
 
✓ IndianWeddingCard (www.indianweddingcard.com) has 
unique, handmade paper invitations at a fraction of the cost 
you’d pay for handmade paper in the U.S. Even though the 
invitations are handmade in India, you will have a two-week 
maximum shipping wait.
 
✓ Wedding Invitations 411 (www.weddinginvitations411.
com) uses Carlson Craft invitations (a brand owned by Taylor) 
and offers styles starting at less than $1 per invitation.
 
Be sure to check prices carefully. Some Web sites (and catalogs) list 
prices “per 100” invitations, and others list them “per 50,” making 
straight price comparisons a little challenging. After all, $67.50 looks 
pretty good compared with $98 — until you discover that you only 
get 50 invitations in the first instance and 100 in the second.
 
Some sites let you design e-mail invitations, which are much 
cheaper than traditional printed invites (and, of course, they’re 
eco-friendly). Etiquette mavens look down their noses at this, but 
unless you’re having a formal wedding, you can ignore traditional 
etiquette on this point.
Choosing an Invitation Style 
to Fit Your Budget
Etiquette dictates that your invitation reflect the kind of wed-
ding you’re having; that is, the more formal your wedding, the 
more formal your invitation should be. Beyond this rule of thumb, 
though, you have free rein in choosing invitations. It comes down 
to your budget and your style. I can’t help you figure out your 
style, but I can show you how your choices — in everything 
from paper to printing process to inserts to the very size of 
your invitation — affect your finances.
Picking out paper
You have literally hundreds (perhaps even thousands) of paper 
possibilities to choose from. Wedding invitations come in all colors 
these days; you aren’t restricted to basic white or cream. You can 

 Chapter 10: Putting It in Print 147
have royal blue paper with white or silver ink, or pale green paper 
with maroon ink, or . . . well, you get the idea.
The factors that influence the price of paper stock include
 
✓ Weight: Paper weight, which affects the price more than 
any other factor, is measured in pounds. Generally, the 
higher the poundage, the thicker the paper — and the more 
expensive it is. (As a baseline, the plain white paper you 
use in your computer printer or office copier is typically 
20-pound stock.)
 
 Vellum is one exception to the general higher-weight-equals-
higher-price rule; this sheer paper, often used to protect let-
tering on an invitation from the other envelope contents, can 
be more expensive per sheet than standard 20-pound paper.
 
 Wedding invitations should be on paper that’s 80-pound 
or heavier. Lighter-weight papers look and feel cheap and 
amateurish — not the impression you want to give your 
guests. Heavier paper has a rich, indulgent feel that tells 
your guests they’re being invited to a truly special event.
 
✓ Composition: The materials used to make the paper affect 
its price. Pulp paper is generally the cheapest; linen paper, 
with its cotton content, is more expensive. And paper with 
recycled content may cost more than regular paper.
 
✓ Finish: Finish is the surface texture of paper. Fancy finishes, 
like shimmery effects, usually bump up the basic cost.
 
✓ Artistic edging: Invitations with rough-cut or beveled edges 
are typically more expensive than straight-edged ones.
 
✓ Texturing: Textured papers don’t have the smooth feel of the 
paper you use in your home printer. Some textured papers 
are actually made from woven fibers, and they, of course, are 
usually costlier. Some embed seeds or other elements to get a 
different texturing effect. Others, like faux parchment, are less 
expensive than the real version.
 
✓ Manufacturing method: How a paper is made also affects 
cost. Handmade papers like rice paper and yuzen (a silk-
screened Japanese paper) are substantially more expensive 
than mass-produced papers.
 
✓ Shipping: Believe it or not, you can order unique, imported 
papers from countries all over the world. Not surprisingly, 
these papers are usually pricier than more traditional stock, 
and international shipping can cost a bundle.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
148
Comparing printing process costs
How your invitations are printed affects the price almost as much 
as your paper choice. Fortunately, the days when wedding invita-
tions were considered gauche if they weren’t engraved are long 
gone. Today, you can get lovely printing from a variety of methods 
without paying a small fortune.
Whether you make your invitations or have them done profes-
sionally, select a printing process that works with the paper you 
choose. Digital printing works best on smooth paper, for example; 
it doesn’t work well with textured paper. Most catalogs and profes-
sional printers note which printing processes are available for vari-
ous paper types. Or ask at your local copy center or office supply 
store for do-it-yourself advice on matching printing and paper.
Common printing processes, from least to most expensive, include 
the following:
 
✓ Digital printing: These days, you’re as likely to encounter 
digital printing as you are offset printing (see the next bullet). 
Computer technology allows for more precise resolution and 
color matching, in hues just as vibrant as offset printing.
 
 Short of using your own computer and printer (see the later 
section “DIY: Indulging Your Creativity (And Saving Money)” 
for details), digital printing is the most economical option. 
It works best on smooth or lightly textured paper; text and 
designs often don’t transfer well to heavily textured stock.
 
✓ Offset printing (lithography): Many printed materials you 
see are created through offset printing, or lithography. An 
inked plate or roller transfers the text or design to the paper, 
creating a flat (not raised) printed image. Materials that use 
more than one color of ink are more expensive because each 
color of ink requires its own plate. Offset printing works well 
with either smooth or textured paper, and it’s one of the less 
expensive options available.
 
✓ Thermography: Thermography involves a combination of 
ink, resin, and heat to create raised lettering that looks the 
same as engraving at a much lower price. Thermography is 
the most popular option for wedding invitations today. Aside 
from the lower cost, thermography allows you to choose dif-
ferent ink colors (engraving works best with black ink, not so 
well with other colors), so you can combine the level of for-
mality you want with your own flair.
 
✓ Foil stamping: Like engraving, foil stamping involves etching 
the text or design onto a copper plate. The “foil” is a special 
material that’s applied to the paper, and the heated copper 

 Chapter 10: Putting It in Print 149
plate is placed on top of the paper, stamping the foil into the 
paper. The result is similar to the now-rare letterpress process, 
but foil stamping offers a much wider range of type styles.
 
 Because of the customization, foil stamping is comparable in 
price to engraving. It’s usually used for formal weddings and 
with heavily textured paper.
 
✓ Engraving: Engraving is the oldest form of printing. Paper is 
sandwiched between an etched copper plate and an inked 
plate; the etched plate forces the paper onto the inked 
plate, creating raised lettering on the front of the paper and 
dimples, or “bruises,” on the back. Engraving is expensive 
because the copper plate has to be custom-etched and can be 
used only once; in fact, you may be given the copper plate as 
a keepsake.
 
 If you’re having a very formal wedding and your guest list 
is quite long (more than 250 people), engraving may be 
both appropriate and cost-effective. For smaller weddings, 
engraved invitations can cost anywhere from $100 to $500 
more than other printing methods, depending on inserts and 
other options.
 
✓ Calligraphy: Handwritten calligraphy is a lovely choice for 
wedding materials, but it’s quite expensive — which is why 
most couples use it only to address their invitations (typi-
cally both the inner and outer envelopes). You can expect to 
pay $1.50 to $2.50 per invitation (in addition to the cost of the 
invitations themselves); however, you may be able to find a 
calligraphy student who will do it for less. Computerized cal-
ligraphy is also a cheaper option — about $1 per invitation — 
and allows you to match the printing on the envelopes with 
the printing on your invitations.
Including inserts (or not)
Wedding invitations used to be elaborate, seven-piece collections: 
the invitation itself, an inner and outer envelope, a response card 
and return envelope, vellum or tissue paper inside the invitation, 
and a reception card. You still can purchase this kind of set, but eti-
quette no longer demands it except for the most formal weddings.
 
Inserts cost extra. The base price for invitations typically includes 
only the invitation and mailing envelope. Everything else has an 
additional fee, including services like having your return address 
stamped on the back flap of the outer envelope. Plus, the more 
inserts you stuff into your invitation, the more expensive postage 
is likely to be (see the later section “Adding postage” for more on 
factors that affect mailing costs).

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
150
Here are some ways you can keep costs under control without vio-
lating any rules of etiquette:
 
✓ Skip the reception card. If your ceremony and reception 
are at the same site, simply have the printer add “Reception 
immediately following” in the lower left corner of the invita-
tion. If the reception is at a different location, you can say 
something like “Dinner and dancing, 7 p.m., Highland Country 
Club.” If guests need a map or driving directions, print them 
on lightweight paper (or even do it yourself on your home 
computer) to keep the postage weight down.
 
✓ Give guests alternatives to RSVP. Some wedding experts esti-
mate that only about 30 percent of guests use response cards 
to let you know whether they’ll attend. So you can ask them 
to respond via e-mail or on your wedding Web site instead. 
You can put this information on a simple card, and you save 
on postage because the invitation itself will be lighter and you 
won’t have to provide stamps for the response envelopes.
 
✓ Use postcards for RSVPs. If you want to include response 
cards, postcards are a good option: They don’t require enve-
lopes, and postcard stamps are about 15 cents cheaper than 
regular first-class stamps.
 
 The U.S. Postal Service decides every year whether to raise its 
postage rates in May. But you can buy “forever” stamps at the 
current price and use them no matter what the new rate is, 
thus saving yourself a few bucks.
 
✓ Determine whether you really need to provide maps and 
driving directions. If most of your guests are local, you prob-
ably don’t need to provide maps or driving directions to your 
ceremony and reception locations; the name of the site and an 
address are sufficient. The exception is if your site isn’t well-
known or is difficult to find.
 
 For out-of-town guests, maps and driving directions are a 
thoughtful touch. But you don’t have to make them fancy. 
Simple (and inexpensive) options include
 
• Providing the information on your wedding Web site.
 
• Having copies made at your local copy center or office 
supply store. Stores like Staples and FedEx Office (for-
merly Kinko’s) have high-quality black-and-white and 
color printers, and copies cost a few cents each.
 
✓ Resist the urge to tell your guests where you’re registered 
for gifts. Registry cards are tacky, no matter what kind of 
wedding you’re planning, so don’t order them. Instead, list 
registries on your wedding Web site, or let family and friends 
spread the word on where you’re registered.

 Chapter 10: Putting It in Print 151
Adding postage
 
Even if you stay within your budget on your invitations, you may 
experience sticker shock when it’s time to mail them. Contrary to 
what you may have heard, weight isn’t the only factor that affects 
postage costs. Even if your invitations weigh less than an ounce, 
you’ll have to pay extra if your invitations:
 
✓ Are oversized or perfectly square
 
✓ Are addressed along the shorter dimension instead of the 
longer one
 
✓ Contain anything that makes the surface uneven
 
✓ Have wax seals, ribbons, or other unusual elements on the 
outer envelope
Check out the U.S. Postal Service Web site (www.usps.com) to see 
whether you need to adjust your postage budget.
Creating Programs and 
Other Materials
Invitations aren’t necessarily the only printed materials you need 
for your wedding. Couples commonly provide save-the-date cards, 
programs for the ceremony, place cards for meals, and napkins 
emblazoned with wedding bells or rings, the couple’s names, and 
the date. And don’t forget about thank-you cards. Expenses for 
all these things can add up quickly. But you can find easy ways 
to keep costs down and still communicate effectively with your 
guests. I show you how in the following sections.
Sending save-the-date cards
Unless you’re planning a destination or holiday wedding, or the 
majority of your guests are from out of town and need to make 
travel arrangements, save-the-date cards aren’t necessary. And 
even under those supposedly required circumstances, you can 
accomplish the same goal by sending out an e-mail. It’s free and 
eco-friendly.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
152
Getting your guests 
with the program
Ceremony programs are quite common these days. They list the 
order of the ceremony and all the participants (usually identifying 
how the participant is connected to the couple, as in “friend of the 
bride” or “groom’s brother”).
You can order programs from your printer, but that’s likely to be 
expensive. You don’t need anything fancy; a simple 81/2-x-11 sheet 
folded in half is perfectly acceptable. Design your program on your 
home computer and make inexpensive copies at your local copy 
center or office supply store.
 
Microsoft Office has free downloadable templates for their Word 
program; go to office.microsoft.com and look through the 
Templates tab. Or you can purchase complete do-it-yourself wed-
ding kits, available from stores like Target and Wal-Mart as well as 
countless online retailers.
With a little creativity, you can turn your ceremony program into a 
keepsake favor for your guests (and forgo traditional favors at the 
reception to save money.) One couple I know created fans, using 
heavy card stock and colorful plastic handles, with the ceremony 
program on one side and a personalized crossword puzzle on the 
back. The puzzle encouraged socialization during the reception, 
as guests consulted one another on the answers to the clues. For 
more creative, do-it-yourself ideas, see the later section “DIY: 
Indulging Your Creativity (And Saving Money).”
Showing guests to their seats
Some couples include pew cards in their printed materials so that 
ushers will know who’s to be seated in the front rows. This is usu-
ally reserved for very large or formal weddings.
More common are place cards for the reception, and they’re a 
good idea even if you have a buffet dinner because they encourage 
mingling and prevent guests who don’t know many other people 
from awkwardly looking for a place to sit.
Again, you can have place cards professionally printed or you can 
make them yourself. All you need is a good quality card stock that 
stands on its own when folded. Or you can use miniature photo 
frames as both a place card and favor; just print the guest’s name 
and table number on a piece of paper and place it in the frame.

 Chapter 10: Putting It in Print 153
 
If you hire a calligrapher to address your invitations, ask her how 
much she charges to do place cards. You’ll have to provide the 
paper, but your place cards will have an elegant look, and the cost 
may be comparable to having them printed.
It’s a napkin! No, it’s a souvenir!
At one time, personalized paper napkins were pretty much a given 
for any wedding, and they’re still quite a common accessory. They 
aren’t terribly expensive, either. Depending on the size and how 
elaborate you get with the design, you can find them as low as $25 
for 100 or upwards of $75 for the same quantity.
Under certain circumstances, you want to provide paper napkins — 
if you’re serving appetizers or nuts and mints, for example. But 
there’s no rule that says the napkins have to be personalized. This 
is strictly a matter of choice and your budget priorities.
Saying thank you to your guests
 
The one etiquette rule you can’t ignore is the one that requires 
handwritten thank-you notes after the wedding. Partly this is 
because my mother would be appalled if I advocated anything less, 
but mainly it’s because, no matter how casual your wedding is, it’s 
still a special occasion, and special occasions demand a special 
effort in the way of thank-yous. The good news: You don’t have to 
have special wedding thank-you notes printed up. A package of 
notecards from your local stationer or drugstore will do just fine.
 DIY: Indulging Your Creativity 
(And Saving Money)
Except for napkins, which don’t work well on home printers, 
you can make virtually all your printed materials yourself, if you 
choose. Printing design software is affordable and makes design-
ing unique materials easy; check out Target (www.target.com) 
or Staples (www.staples.com) for software packages, or look at 
your local Costco or other warehouse club for better prices.
 
If you have a PC with Internet access at home, you can download 
free templates for all kinds of wedding materials from Microsoft’s 
Web site (www.microsoft.com). If you use an Apple computer, 
you can get the Microsoft templates if you purchase Microsoft 
Office for Mac.

Part II: Planning the Ceremony  
154
Office supply stores carry a variety of quality papers, as do many 
online sites. To make shopping around easier, start with price 
comparison sites like Nextag (www.nextag.com), which also offer 
reviews of products and sellers. Laser printers, which are rela-
tively inexpensive, create clean, professional-looking printing. If 
you don’t own a printer, you can save your designs to a CD or flash 
drive and take it to your local copy center for printing.
Homemade invitations and other materials also let you express 
your personality and creativity in ways you just can’t get from the 
pros. You can create one-of-a-kind materials with stamps, sten-
cils, paints, and pencils — even ribbons and dried flowers, if you 
choose. Find materials at your local craft store; you may even be 
able to take a free crafting class there.
 
Although most supplies for doing your own printing are inexpen-
sive, ink cartridges for your printer are not. Depending on how 
much printing you do and how elaborate you get with color, ink 
can easily swallow up any savings you may expect from doing 
it yourself. Even if you purchase less expensive (and more eco-
friendly) refill kits, you still can shell out a lot of money for ink. 
Another potential issue is getting a good imprint on paper if you’re 
using an inkjet printer. Inkjet printers don’t work as well as laser 
printers, especially on textured paper; laser printers produce a 
better imprint.
 
Online printers like PrintRunner (www.printrunner.com) or 
iPrint (www.iprint.com) allow you to upload your design — 
or even create your own using the site’s tools — and order the 
number of invitations you need. Prices start at less than $1 per 
invitation, which may be less expensive than buying multiple ink 
cartridges.
The main downside to doing it yourself, of course, is time. If other 
commitments are slopping over the edges of your already-full 
plate, paying a pro may be a good investment for your sanity.

Chapter 11
Selecting the Reception Site
In This Chapter
▶ Sizing up your chosen reception sites
▶ Picking from among the many types of reception venues
▶ Organizing transportation to and from your wedding venues
T
he perfect party doesn’t just happen. And what is a wedding 
reception but a fabulous party marking a most special occa-
sion? A successful party requires the right combination of space, 
atmosphere, and menu. These items are the foundation for all the 
other elements of your reception.
In this chapter, I share tips on all things reception venues, from 
choosing the right space to accommodate your guests to compar-
ing fees and charges at the different kinds of venues. I also provide 
a checklist of amenities to make sure your guests are comfortable 
and well cared for. Finally, I address the practical issue of moving 
yourself and your guests from your ceremony to your reception.
 
You can save money — and make your wedding day more conve-
nient for your guests — by combining your ceremony and recep-
tion sites. See Chapter 4 for information on ceremony sites that 
can serve double duty.
Matching Sites with 
Your Guest List
Just as a few dozen guests can seem insignificant in a massive 
cathedral, a too-large or too-small reception site can suck all the 
energy and fun out of your post-ceremony celebration. Most wed-
ding experts recommend that you come up with an estimated head 
count before you start shopping for reception venues, but you can 
work it either way.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
158
If, for instance, you love a particular site, you can resolve to limit 
your guest list to fit that site. However, keep in mind that limit-
ing your guest list can be tough (see Chapter 2 for tips on setting 
your guest list). The easier option may be to figure out how many 
people you expect to fete and then go looking for sites that are big 
enough (or small enough) to fit your head count.
 
Large spaces can be “sized down” in several ways, but you can’t 
make a small space bigger. If you’re torn between a site that’s a 
bit too big and one that may squeeze your guests, you need to 
decide whether you’re willing to pay more for a bigger site or trim 
your guest list to fit a smaller one. Larger venues often have higher 
minimum-charge requirements; you may have to commit to paying 
for 200 guests, for example, even if you only intend to invite 175.
How much space you need depends both on how many people 
you’re hosting and what activities you’re providing. A cocktail 
reception, for example, requires less space than a sit-down dinner, 
and a buffet dinner with dancing requires more space than a tea-
and-cake reception. Table 11-1 offers further guidelines for match-
ing square footage with the expected activities of your reception.

Finding the Best Venue 
for Your Reception
Reception sites come in all shapes, sizes, service levels, and price 
ranges. Unfortunately, figuring out which site offers the best value 
can be tricky, because services, amenities, and pricing structures 
vary widely among the different kinds of sites.

 Chapter 11: Selecting the Reception Site 159
Word-of-mouth may be the best way to come up with ideas and 
recommendations for reception sites. Ask friends and relatives for 
suggestions; between attending business functions and other wed-
dings, they’re sure to have firsthand knowledge of at least some 
of the possibilities in your area. Plus, their experience is a handy 
guide in gauging whether a particular venue is worth considering. 
After all, if friends had a lousy meal there, you probably don’t need 
to spend your precious time looking at it yourself.
 
Even though food and drinks constitute the major portion of most 
couples’ wedding budgets (see Chapter 12 for food and drink 
details), more goes into a successful reception than just a great 
meal. The ideal reception site is capable of attending to all your 
guests’ needs for the day. So, regardless of the type of facility 
you choose, pay attention to the following amenities when you’re 
scouting potential venues:
 
✓ Acoustics: If a site can host more than one event at a time, 
find out whether the reception rooms are adequately sound-
protected to prevent audio bleeding from other events.
 
✓ Bathrooms: Check out these important facilities to make sure 
they’re clean, convenient, and plentiful enough to accommodate 
your guests. If the site hosts more than one event at a time, 
determine whether there are enough bathrooms to go around.
 
✓ Coat check: Ask whether the venue has a place for guests to 
check their coats (or at least a secure place to hang them). If 
the venue does offer a coat check service, find out whether 
you can cover the expense for your guests so they don’t have 
to pay (and figure this cost into your budget). A coat check 
service may not be critical for a summer wedding, but for 
other seasons, it’s an amenity that means a lot to your guests.
 
✓ Parking: Estimate whether the venue has enough parking for 
your guests and whether the site offers valet parking. If it does 
have a valet service, is the fee included in your rental contract 
or do you or your guests have to pay extra?
Read on for a primer on what you can expect from several of the 
most common reception venues. Keep in mind that you can work 
around virtually every shortfall for every potential site if the ben-
efits outweigh what’s lacking.
Church fellowship halls
If you’ve already decided to have your ceremony in a church or 
other place of worship, one of the most common — and least 
expensive — options is to have your reception in that church’s fel-
lowship hall immediately following your ceremony.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
160
Some of the pros of using this type of venue include the following:
 
✓ You often can use the hall for free or for a small clean-up fee, 
especially if you’re a member of the congregation.
 
✓ You don’t have to rent tables and chairs.
 
✓ You can bring in outside caterers without being slapped with 
a surcharge (see Chapter 12 for more on catering).
 
✓ You don’t have to provide transportation to a separate loca-
tion for yourselves, your wedding party, or your guests.
 
You may run into a few of these potential downsides, however:
 
✓ Fellowship halls tend to be pretty Spartan, requiring a lot of 
decoration to create an inviting atmosphere.
 
✓ Some houses of worship have restrictions on the hours their 
halls can be used, the noise levels, and the serving of alcohol.
 
✓ Fellowship hall policies may prohibit the use of candles, bird-
seed (for throwing in lieu of rice), or other elements you may 
want to include in your celebration.
You can work around some of these cons. Consider borrowing 
decorations from church members who’ve recently hosted wed-
dings, for example. Instead of a cocktail reception, you can have a 
brunch, which is perfectly appropriate (dry!) for a fellowship hall. 
Besides, cheaper food and beverage choices, such as those avail-
able for brunch, may allow you to expand your guest list. As for 
prohibitions on candles and the like, you can brainstorm with your 
betrothed and others for alternatives (such as electric candles, for 
example) — assuming those prohibited things aren’t high on your 
priority list, of course.
Hotel ballrooms
After church weddings and receptions, hotel ballrooms are the 
next most common venues for nuptial celebrations. As with church 
celebrations, you often can have both your ceremony and recep-
tion at this type of venue.
The pros of hosting your reception at a hotel include the following:
 
✓ Some hotels waive the ballroom rental fee if you agree to a 
minimum food-and-beverage charge.
 
✓ Nearly all hotels give you breaks on room rates for you and 
your out-of-town guests.

 Chapter 11: Selecting the Reception Site 161
 
✓ Tables, chairs, place settings, and linens are usually included 
in the package. Some even throw in centerpieces and wedding 
arches (for those who have ceremonies at the venue). Most 
have a range of color options so you can at least complement, 
if not match, your wedding colors.
 
✓ They often have on-site wedding coordinators who make sure 
your reception goes smoothly. The good news is that you usu-
ally don’t pay extra for this service.
 
✓ If you have both your ceremony and reception in the hotel, 
you’ll save money on transportation.
 
✓ Hotels often can recommend other local wedding vendors, 
such as entertainers, florists, and bakers. However, be careful, 
because some try to steer you to vendors who pay a “commis-
sion” to get on the hotel’s preferred vendor list.
 
Some potential pitfalls of celebrating in a hotel ballroom include 
the following:
 
✓ You may be competing with other events, including other 
wedding receptions, at the same time as yours. Multiple 
events can mean problems with service, noise carryover 
between reception rooms, and crowded parking lots, coat 
check facilities, and restrooms.
 
✓ You may have to use the in-house caterer, or pay a hefty sur-
charge to bring in an independent one. (Chapter 12 provides 
more catering information.)
 
✓ You may end up paying hidden fees. Some fees that are com-
monly excluded from the price quote (but are noted in the 
fine print) include mandatory gratuities for the staff, cake-
cutting fees, and even sales taxes.
You may be able to save yourself some legwork — and money — 
by calling your local convention and visitors bureau and asking 
for hotel recommendations for your reception. The bureau may 
even send out a sort of “request for proposals” to potential sites, 
essentially opening up your reception to bidding. This strategy is 
particularly effective if you have lots of out-of-town guests; after 
all, the primary purpose of a convention and visitors bureau is to 
fill hotel rooms.
 
Include in your search hotels that cater to business travelers. They 
often have the same reception facilities as hotels that cater to 
other clientele, but, unlike other hotels, weekends tend to be their 
slow times. You may be able to get a deal for your Saturday eve-
ning wedding that no other hotel would think of offering.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
162
 
If your town hosts a lot of conventions, competition for reception 
space, caterers, and other services can be stiff. So the earlier you 
start looking for an appropriate site, the better your chances of 
getting the one you want on the date you want.
Banquet halls
Banquet halls specialize in wedding receptions and other food-ori-
ented events, so usually they prohibit you from bringing in outside 
caterers or alcohol. Bakers are the exception; most halls allow you 
to hire an outside baker to make your wedding cake.
Here are some pros of going with a banquet hall:
 
✓ Because they specialize in events like wedding receptions, 
they have lots of experience in setting up rooms to improve 
traffic flow and efficiently serve food and drinks.
 
✓ Many have in-house wedding coordinators whose services 
are included in the package price and who stage-direct your 
reception to make sure everything happens when it should.
 
✓ The décor in halls is usually attractive and tasteful, but it’s 
neutral enough that it doesn’t clash with any embellishments 
you want to add.
 
The following are some of the not-so-great points of banquet halls:
 
✓ Prices can be significantly higher than with other venues, and 
you may not have as much negotiating power as with other 
sites.
 
✓ The food and service at these venues may be mediocre.
 
✓ Depending on the facility, yours may be only one of several 
events taking place at the same time, which can make you feel 
less special on your wedding day.
Clubs
Country clubs offer some of the poshest facilities around. Despite 
popular belief, you may not even have to be a member to use these 
sites. Some clubs open their reception doors to anyone; others 
only require that a member — who may be a mere acquaintance — 
sponsor your reception. (In essence, that person promises to pay 
in the event that you stiff the club.)
You may be able to have both your ceremony and reception at a 
country club, thus cutting down on transportation and other costs. 

 Chapter 11: Selecting the Reception Site 163
Most country clubs have terraces or patios that can accommodate 
a ceremony setup.
Municipal-owned clubs usually are much cheaper than private 
clubs, and they tend to have less restrictive policies on bringing in 
outside caterers and alcohol. Other inexpensive options include 
civic clubs, such as the Elks, Junior League, and Lions, or military 
clubs (if you or a relative is serving in or has retired from the 
armed services). Remember, though, these clubs usually aren’t as 
fancy as private clubs, and some may require a good deal of deco-
ration to look appropriately festive.
 
Food and beverage costs may be significantly higher at country 
clubs, and most won’t allow you to bring in outside caterers. A 
price difference of even $2 or $3 per person can raise your total bill 
substantially, so be sure to weigh the extra cost against your other 
wedding priorities.
Restaurants
Restaurants can be an excellent alternative to some of the other 
venues that I mention in this section. Many have private dining 
rooms that can accommodate groups of 50 or more; some even 
have stunning views of city skylines or natural landscapes. 
Decoration costs are minimal, and you can treat your guests to 
really excellent food. Best of all, the same menu that costs $45 per 
person at a hotel or banquet hall may run you $30 or less at a res-
taurant. However, most restaurants charge a mandatory gratuity 
(usually 18 percent) for large parties, so be sure to factor that into 
your budget.
 
The main downside of opting for this type of venue is that most 
restaurants aren’t equipped to handle dance parties. So, if you 
really want to do the Macarena with your guests until the wee 
hours, a restaurant probably won’t work for you.
Considering Transportation
If your ceremony and reception are being held at the same 
location, you don’t have to worry about paying for additional 
transportation — unless you just can’t bear the thought of pulling 
up to the site in your everyday car.
However, if you have separate ceremony and reception sites, you 
have to decide how to get from one to the other. And this applies 
not just to you and your new spouse, but perhaps to your wedding 

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
164
party and even your guests, too. Hiring a limousine is the tradi-
tional solution. But you’re limited only by your creativity — and, of 
course, distance.
In this section, I help you weigh the costs and benefits of limou-
sines, buses, and alternative modes of transportation.
Hiring a limousine service
Depending on where you live, limo rentals average between $65 
and $100 an hour for a standard six-passenger car. If you want 
a specialty limo — a Rolls Royce, for example — the price can 
leap to $200 or more per hour. Party limos, such as the 20- to 30-
passenger stretch Hummer, can run you thousands of dollars for a 
three- or four-hour rental — the minimum at most limo services.
When you’re figuring out how much you want to spend on a limo 
service, keep these things in mind:
 
✓ How the rental fees are calculated: Most services have a 
three-hour minimum rental, so even if you only use the limo 
for an hour, you pay for three. Other companies charge in 
15-minute increments, so if you go over the contracted time 
by even a few minutes, you’ll pay a hefty overtime charge.
 
 Find out when the clock starts (and stops) ticking on your 
rental. Some companies start counting down from when the 
limo leaves their garage; others don’t start the clock until the 
limo arrives at your site. It may be a difference of only a few 
minutes, but it could cost you dearly in overtime fees.
 
 Weigh the minimum cost against your actual usage of the limo 
service. If your reception site is only a five-minute drive from 
your ceremony site, you may decide it isn’t worth paying the 
three-hour minimum — especially if your guests won’t even 
see you drive up.
 
✓ Extra amenities (and the associated fees): Some limos are out-
fitted with leather interiors, wet bars, televisions, and even red 
carpets. All those special touches cost extra, so be sure you 
know how much you’re paying on top of the standard rate.
 
✓ Hidden costs: The following are some hidden costs to be 
on the lookout for. When you shop around for prices, ask 
whether the limo service charges any extra fees, such as the 
following:
 
• Fuel surcharges: When gas hit $4 a gallon in 2008, many 
limo companies added fuel surcharges to their standard 
rates to recoup some of the expense. However, even 

 Chapter 11: Selecting the Reception Site 165
though gas prices dropped significantly in the following 
12 months, not all companies dropped this extra charge.
 
• A mandatory tip for the driver: This tip is usually 10 
percent to 20 percent of the total bill.
 
• Per-stop fees: These fees are usually charged for mul-
tiple pick-up and drop-off locations; fees range from $15 
to $30 per stop.
 
✓ Deposit, cancellation, and refund policies: Most companies 
require a 50 percent deposit to hold the make and model of 
limo you want for the date and times you specify. Find out 
when you have to cancel to avoid a service fee. Also deter-
mine how you go about getting a refund if the driver is late or 
doesn’t show up at all.
 
Many limo rental companies offer wedding packages that include 
streamers, “Just Married” signs, and even Champagne for the 
happy couple. If the package is a flat rate, you may want to go with 
it and save yourself the potential worry of incurring overtime fees 
with a traditional hourly rental.
Arranging bus transport

At most weddings, guests are left to find their own way from the 
ceremony to the reception; there’s nothing wrong with expecting 
them to do so at your wedding, especially if money is tight.
However, couples who can afford it like to offer their guests the 
option of provided transportation — especially if many of their 
guests are from out of town, or if the reception site is difficult to 
find or has limited parking facilities.
In most areas, buses are the most efficient ways to transport lots 
of people. Average charter rates for a full-sized motor coach are 
about $90 an hour; most charter bus companies have a five-hour 
minimum, which is appropriate for most weddings. Some com-
panies charge a mandatory gratuity for the driver (usually 10 
percent); if this fee isn’t included in the rental price, plan to pay it 
directly to the driver at the end of his shift.
 
To find charter bus services, skip the Internet and look to your 
local phone book first. Many of the sites you’ll find on the Web are 
actually brokers, not charter companies. So they often tack on a 
hefty commission — sometimes as much as 40 percent — to hook 
you up with a local company.

Exploring alternative options
The most obvious (and generally the cheapest) alternative to 
hiring transportation is to let your attendants and guests arrange 
their own. But if that route doesn’t appeal to you, you have plenty 
of other options. If your reception site is on a lake or river, you 
could arrange to arrive in a boat, for example.
Brides and grooms before you have made their way from the cer-
emony to the reception via
 
✓ Horse and carriage (may be more expensive than a limo)
 
✓ Antique or classic car (least expensive if you can borrow a 
friend’s)
 
✓ Motorcycle (due to safety concerns, not advisable if you don’t 
have your own)
 
✓ Inline skates (quite inexpensive, though possibly too strenu-
ous when wearing wedding togs)
 
✓ Tandem bicycle (quaint and budget-friendly)
 
✓ Pedicab (generally less expensive than a limo)
 
Choose whatever mode of transportation appeals to you (and fits 
your budget). Just remember that, with all the excitement and 
commotion of the day, comfort and convenience may be your high-
est priorities.

M
ost people have deeply ingrained preconceptions about 
what a wedding reception should look like, and these pre-
conceptions can cause you to spend more than you really want to. 
But don’t worry; you have hope in your corner. Budget-conscious 
couples are finding creative ways to throw memorable parties 
without spending a small fortune. It’s a matter of coming up with 
the right combination of timing, place, formality, and size to craft a 
celebration that everyone will enjoy.
In this chapter, I show you how various options can fit into your 
budget, how you can save money on food and drink (and where 
you shouldn’t try to scrimp), and how you can express your sense 
of style and taste with outside-the-cake-box ideas.
Setting a Food Budget
Food (and alcohol) represents the single biggest expense for 
virtually any wedding, and you may be shocked when you first 
begin researching caterers in your area. Prices on the coasts and 
in large metro areas are higher than in smaller cities or in the 
middle of the country. Even so, you can expect to pay anywhere 
from $20 to $300 per guest just on the food. Alcohol and the cake, 
of course, are extra.
 
In general, food and alcohol (if you choose to provide it) take up 
between 40 percent and 50 percent of your total wedding budget. 
So, if your wedding budget is $5,000, plan to devote between $2,000 
and $2,500 to your catering bill.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
168
The factors that have the biggest impact on your food budget are
 
✓ The number of guests you have: Of course, as your guest 
list grows, your catering bill increases proportionately. If you 
want to invite a bigger crowd, be sure you’re ready to choose 
a less expensive menu.
 
✓ The kind of food you serve: As you probably expected, a 
fancier meal is going to cost you more than a simple one. So, 
if you want to wow your guests’ palates, be prepared to invite 
fewer people.
 
✓ The way you serve it: Buffet-style meals can be much less 
expensive than sit-down meals, so if you’re looking to cut 
costs, consider setting up a buffet instead.
When you’re figuring out your budget, you have a choice of start-
ing with the number of guests you want to invite, the kind of food 
and service you want, or the amount of money that’s in your esti-
mated budget (see Chapter 2).
To decide where to start, break out the list of priorities you and 
your betrothed identified for your wedding (see Chapter 1). Would 
you rather have a fancy, formal meal for 50 people, or would you 
rather invite more of your friends and family and go with a less 
expensive, less formal menu to accommodate the extra people? 
(See the following section, “Adjusting the Formality Dial,” to see 
what different meal options can look like.)
There’s no right or wrong answer here; it’s entirely up to you and 
your spouse-to-be. If you’re willing to pay $5,000 for your recep-
tion, for example, and you have your heart set on a formal prime-
rib-and-lobster dinner, chances are you’ll have to pare your guest 
list down to the bone. On the other hand, if you want a big, boister-
ous celebration, $5,000 will pay for one heck of a barbeque.
Adjusting the Formality Dial
Generally, the less formal your reception, the lower your food bill 
will be. But you don’t have to sacrifice style and elegance to limit 
your spending — you only have to broaden your idea of what a 
stylish and elegant wedding reception looks like. In the follow-
ing sections, I help you do just that by explaining the many meal 
options you have.

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 169
Sophisticated and relaxed: 
Daytime receptions
 
Daytime celebrations tend to be less expensive for a number of 
reasons:
 
✓ Demand for reception sites is lower, so rental the fees are 
typically lower.
 
✓ Food is less expensive, in much the same way that you spend 
less on an entree at a restaurant during the lunch hour than at 
dinnertime. (Of course, portions are usually smaller at lunch-
time, too.)
 
✓ You aren’t expected to provide much in the way of alcohol 
(see the later section “Answering the Alcohol Question” for 
more on serving adult beverages).
 
✓ Entertainment isn’t as expensive, because there’s less 
demand. Plus bands or DJs often can book an afternoon and 
evening gig for the same day (see Chapter 13).
 
✓ Often, the event won’t be as lengthy.
Even though daytime functions are less expensive, they can be 
among the most sophisticated events you’ll encounter. Plus, 
because the food is less expensive, you get more for your money. 
In this section, I tell you what you need to know to throw a suc-
cessful brunch, tea, or garden party.
Of course, you aren’t limited to brunch, garden parties, and teas. 
You also can have a lunch reception that’s formal or informal or 
indoors or out; no matter what, your costs will be significantly 
lower than the same event in the evening. Have a picnic, a clam-
bake, or a potluck meal to keep food costs down.
Let’s do brunch!
Brunch, which is usually served between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m., 
combines breakfast foods and light lunch fare. These menus are 
among the least expensive catering options. You can provide a 
variety of specialty buffets — for example, a fruit and salad bar, 
finger sandwiches, and a sweets buffet — along with made-to-order 
omelet and pasta stations and perhaps a carved meat station.
You can have a traditional wedding cake, too, if you like. Or you 
can choose something lighter, such as sponge cake and fruit com-
pote, cookies, pies, or sweet fruit crepes.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
170
Offer a coffee bar, juices, and soft drinks. If you want to serve alco-
hol, stick with mimosas and bloody marys. Because they’re mixed, 
the alcohol for these drinks doesn’t have to be high-quality.
Entertainment for a wedding brunch doesn’t have to be elaborate, 
because these types of weddings often don’t include dancing. 
Instead of a DJ or dance band, you can use recorded music or hire 
a small band, harpist, or pianist to play background music.
Decorations for a brunch should be light and sparse — not nearly 
as elaborate as for a formal dinner. And, of course, limiting your 
decorations saves you money. Stick to centerpieces on the tables 
and some decorations for the head table, cake table, and gift table; 
a few fresh, in-season flowers along with ribbons or streamers will 
suffice for the latter tables.
 
You can do a straight breakfast reception (which usually is served 
from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.), but you run the risk of feeling rushed — 
and having sleepy guests — if you have the ceremony immediately 
before the reception.
With a brunch reception, you can have the ceremony at 10 a.m. 
or 10:30 a.m., which means that you (and your guests) can set the 
alarm for a less ungodly hour that morning.
 
Brunch fare can cost less than half — even as little as a third — of 
a full dinner menu. Depending on where you live and the caterer 
you use, you may be able to keep your per-guest cost to around 
$10 to $15 for a brunch.
Meet me in the garden
Garden parties (which can be held indoors) usually are afternoon 
affairs, starting after 1 p.m. and ending around 4 p.m. The key advan-
tage here is that no one expects you to provide full meals during this 
time frame. Instead, you can offer light appetizers — either butler-
passed or at stations — which are far less expensive than a full buffet 
or sit-down meal. In fact, you may be able to afford more expensive 
appetizers, like bacon-wrapped scallops or handmade mini ravioli, 
because you don’t have to worry about providing a meal, too.
Traditional wedding cakes work well at garden parties, but other 
dessert options are just as good. Less expensive options include 
fancy cookies, chocolate truffles, parfaits, and tarts.
Coffee, tea (iced and hot), lemonade, and soda all go well with light 
afternoon fare. Alcohol, if you choose to provide it, can be limited 
to beer, wine, and a signature drink like Planter’s Punch or apple 
martinis; no one will remark on the absence of a full bar at this 
kind of function.

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 171
 
As with brunches (see the previous section), entertainment and 
decoration requirements are minimal with garden parties, which 
can save you a bundle. Depending on the venue and the kind of 
appetizers you offer, your cost per guest can be around $15 or less.
You’re invited to tea
Afternoon teas are classy affairs that are similar to garden parties 
but have an emphasis, naturally, on tea. They usually run from 2 
p.m. to 5 p.m. However, “high tea,” which has a larger menu, tra-
ditionally is served at 5 p.m. A traditional English afternoon tea 
consists of scones with cream and strawberries, fruit tarts, finger 
sandwiches, and petit fours. You can have a traditional wedding 
cake, too, but you can get by with a smaller version because so 
much of the menu is sweet; some guests won’t have cake at all, and 
those who do will likely prefer smaller portions.
Alcohol is seldom served at tea receptions, except for Champagne 
for toasts. Coffee, lemonade, and soda round out the drink menu. 
Entertainment usually consists of background music — classical 
or light jazz — and can be recorded or live. And decorations usu-
ally take an understated slant — decorous small centerpieces, for 
example, and perhaps a few flowers or petals on the dessert table. 
Catering expenses for an afternoon tea can be less than $10 per 
person, depending on the site and the extent of the menu.
Other daytime celebrations
If you want to keep things casual, you have several options. Picnics 
are among the least expensive meals to host, for example. You can 
provide hot dogs and hamburgers and enlist family members and 
friends to provide signature dishes. Limit decorations to table-
cloths and balloons, and have a sheet cake, cupcakes, cookies, or 
other desserts in lieu of the traditional tiered wedding cake.
Other casual daytime options include
 
✓ A clambake, with corn on the cob and a variety of salads
 
✓ A luau, with pulled pork (or a whole roasted pig, if you 
prefer), tropical fruit salad, rice or poi, banana bread, and 
sweet potatoes
 
✓ A lunch spread, with meat and cheese platters, rolls, raw veg-
gies, potato chips, dips, and cold salads
 
With any of these menus, you can feed 100 people for $500 or less. 
Check out restaurant suppliers or club warehouses like Costco or 
Sam’s Club to get deals on bulk foods, and hit party supply stores 
for paper goods and decorations to fit your theme.

172
A sweet affair: Dessert receptions
Dessert receptions are a great way to satisfy couples with a sweet 
tooth, and they also help you get around big food bills. Usually 
held later in the evening — starting between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. — 
these functions focus on a plethora of sweets, such as truffles, 
tortes, cheesecakes, and crème brûlée. Like cocktail receptions, 
dessert receptions are shorter affairs, typically lasting only two 
hours.
Coffee is a given at dessert receptions; you can even provide a 
coffee bar with different flavors (don’t forget the decaf). Other typi-
cal beverages include tea (iced and hot) and soda. Alcohol is usu-
ally limited and often available only in specialty coffee drinks.
 
The potential disadvantage to dessert receptions is finding a site 
that isn’t booked for a traditional dinner reception.
However, keep in mind that you don’t need a dance floor or formal 
seating, so you probably can use a smaller meeting room or restau-
rant. Not only are these venues more cozy for a dessert reception, 
but they also may be cheaper. Per-guest costs for dessert recep-
tions are typically between $10 and $20.
Cocktail receptions: 
A social alternative
If you and your intended aren’t big on dancing and you’re beer or 
wine buffs, a cocktail reception may be just the right function to 
celebrate your wedding. Cocktail receptions emphasize mingling 
and socializing rather than entertainment, so you can use inexpen-
sive recorded music or an inexpensive DJ. If needed (depending 
on the size of the room and the number of guests), you can rent 
a microphone and loudspeaker for announcements and toasts. 
Decoration costs are minimal, too; you can use simple candles as 
centerpieces and decorate the guest book, gift, and cake tables 
with ribbons and artificial flowers or petals.
Alcohol will consume the biggest part of your budget with this 
type of reception, because you’ll be expected to provide a rela-
tively full bar. You don’t have to provide top-shelf liquor; recogniz-
able brands are fine (although they, too, can add up to a significant 
bill). On the other hand, your food costs are limited to appetizers 
and the cake (or other dessert option).

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 173
 
Even though your beverage menu is more extensive, you don’t 
have to provide that full bar for as many hours as you would 
during a dinner reception. A typical cocktail reception lasts two 
hours — usually 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. or 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. — compared 
with four hours for the average dinner reception.
A two-hour cocktail reception with light appetizers may cost $20 to 
$30 per person — but you don’t have to pay for the $20-per-guest 
meal on top of the cocktails.
Formality at its finest: 
Dinner receptions
Dinner receptions, which usually begin between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. 
and end between 10:30 p.m. and midnight, are typically the most 
formal and most expensive option. The expensive nature of these 
events is due to the fact that, in addition to expecting a full meal 
(as opposed to only appetizers or light fare), your guests also 
expect alcohol and entertainment — two big expenses. (Alcohol 
is covered later in this chapter; see Chapter 13 for info on keeping 
entertainment costs down.)
Another reason dinner receptions can be so expensive is because 
etiquette usually forces couples to include a beginning cocktail 
hour, complete with alcohol and hors d’oeuvres. Even though 
etiquette says you need a cocktail hour, if your budget can’t with-
stand the added expense, feel free to do without.
 
You can keep your food expenses down by choosing a buffet-style 
dinner, which is generally cheaper than a sit-down meal. Buffet 
dinners are cheaper because labor costs are lower. For sit-down 
meals, you need one server for every 20 to 25 guests; for buffets, 
you need one server for every 50 to 75 guests. Plus you don’t have 
the labor of preparing individual plates for each guest.
Here’s the lowdown on what you generally get with these two 
options:
 
✓ Buffet service: With a buffet dinner, you can offer your guests 
a wider variety of main and side dishes often at a lower cost 
per guest. For example, a typical buffet offers at least three 
main dishes and three or four side dishes.
 
✓ Sit-down dinners: With a sit-down dinner, guests usually have 
their choice among one or two meat entrees and a vegetarian 
option. Side dishes typically are the same for each entree.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
174
 
 To make sure your food budget doesn’t explode with a sit-
down dinner, choose entrees that are the same or nearly the 
same in price. For example, you may give guests their choice 
of pork medallions, chicken, or pasta primavera, all of which 
may be priced at $14.95. But if you offer, say, prime rib at $25 
a plate and chicken at $14.95, and 90 percent of your guests 
choose the prime rib, your budget could easily shatter.
You can save money on either a buffet or sit-down dinner by 
decreasing the number of courses. If you have a cocktail hour, for 
example, you don’t really need a soup or salad course at dinner.
Selecting a Caterer to 
Cook for the Crowd
The food is arguably what your guests will remark on the most at 
your reception. So, no matter what kind of reception you decide to 
have, you want the food to be as memorable and plentiful as your 
budget allows. Choosing a caterer to provide this all-important 
feature of your big day can be a challenge, and the price tag can 
induce something akin to heart failure if you aren’t prepared for 
the shock.
The following sections outline the basics of selecting a caterer, 
starting with knowing what you’re expected to pay for. I also offer 
tips on asking potential caterers key questions so you can make an 
informed decision.
Having an international affair 
with ethnic cuisine
Selecting an ethnic theme is a good way to keep both food and alcohol costs down. 
Italian, Mexican, and Chinese buffets are usually cheaper than buffets that offer 
beef, pork, and chicken entrees. For sit-down dinners, give your guests a sampler 
plate of ethnic cuisine (which eliminates the need for choosing similarly priced 
entrees).
Limit alcohol to drinks that fit with the cuisine. If you’ve chosen an Italian theme, for 
example, offer Chianti and limoncello. For Asian cuisine, offer sake and Asian beer. 
Serve wine and Greek ale with a Mediterranean meal, and margaritas and Mexican 
beer with enchiladas and chimichangas.

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 175
Knowing what you’re paying for
Some reception sites require you to use their in-house caterer; 
others allow you to bring in outside caterers. No matter which way 
you go, you need to understand what you’re paying for. And that’s 
not always easy, because there are lots of charges and fees that 
you don’t know about until you’re presented with the final bill. Of 
course, these hidden fees are in addition to the standard fees you 
expect.
 
Caterers generally charge on a per-guest or per-meal basis. Many 
of them offer a variety of choices within specific price categories. 
For example, you may be able to choose one of three kinds of 
salad, up to three entrees from a list of six, and so on — and what-
ever you choose will cost so much per guest.
 
In addition to the per-guest charge, here are some expenses that 
you may not expect:
 
✓ Cake-cutting fees: Most often charged by hotels and recep-
tion halls, this fee can add $1.50 or more per slice to your cake 
cost.
 
✓ Catering surcharges: Sites that allow you to bring in outside 
caterers may charge your caterer a surcharge of 7 percent to 
15 percent for the privilege of using the facility. Most caterers 
pass these surcharges along to their customers, so you end 
up paying that extra money.
 
✓ Corkage fees: Sites that allow you to bring in your own alco-
hol don’t often let you do so for free. They charge you for 
opening the bottles and serving the drinks — a fee that can be 
as high as $10 per bottle.
 
✓ Mandatory gratuities: This fee typically is 18 percent of the 
total food and beverage bill.
 
✓ Sales tax: In some areas, the sales tax on catered affairs may 
be close to 10 percent — adding nearly $500 to a $5,000 food 
and beverage tab.
You can’t negotiate away sales taxes or mandatory gratuities, but 
some of these other fees may be open for discussion. For example, 
you may be able to negotiate a cap on catering surcharges or cork-
age fees. If you can’t negotiate a better deal, weigh these costs 
against the alternatives; you may find that, even with the corkage 
fee, you can save money by providing your own alcohol.
Keep your priorities in mind, too. If having that fabulous caterer from 
across town is high on your list of must-haves, perhaps you’d rather 
adjust other areas of your budget to account for the surcharge.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests

Get every detail in writing before you sign a contract or make a 
deposit. Make sure any verbal promises are noted in the signed 
contract, too. Keep written records — a journal of conversations 
and copies of e-mails — of any changes or promises made after 
you sign the contract. These records provide you some insur-
ance in case the person you deal with stops working at the facility 
before your wedding day; you can show the new staff member the 
details you worked out and thus stand a better chance of getting 
the deal you planned for.
Asking caterers the right questions
Whether you’re going with an in-house caterer at a hotel or an 
independent outfit, you need certain information to help you make 
a final decision. The best way to get the information you need is to 
interview potential caterers. Here are some questions you should 
ask every caterer you’re considering:
 
✓ Do you offer taste tests, and is there a charge for them? 
Some caterers offer free taste tests for groups of potential cli-
ents once or twice a month; others make individual appoint-
ments, but charge a small fee (which makes sense, because 
they incur costs in preparing the food). If a caterer tries to tell 
you a taste test isn’t necessary, look for another professional.
 
✓ Do you specialize in specific cuisines or menu types? Some 
caterers have the popular Italian buffet down to a science, 
which is great if you want Italian food. If you want a sit-down 
Mediterranean dinner, though, look for a caterer that special-
izes in that cuisine.
 
✓ Where is the food prepared? It’s particularly important to 
ask off-site caterers where they prepare the food, because it 
may affect your choice of reception sites. If the caterer pre-
pares all the food at her own kitchen and only needs to set up 
serving areas, you don’t have to worry about whether your 
reception site has adequate kitchen facilities. But if some or 
all the food needs to be prepared on-site, you need to make 
sure your reception site has the proper facilities.
 
✓ How do you charge for servers, and how many do I need? 
Find out whether the labor charge is included in the caterer’s 
price, or whether the caterer charges a mandatory gratuity 
based on the total food and beverage bill. Buffet dinners 
require fewer servers than sit-down dinners; ask whether 
the cost of additional staff for a sit-down meal is included 
in the price.

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 177
 
✓ Do you provide alcohol/bar service, and how is the cost 
calculated? Some caterers charge per drink; some charge per 
opened bottle; and others charge an hourly rate per guest. 
To avoid paying more than you budgeted for, make sure 
you understand the price structure as well as the types and 
brands of alcohol that will be served.
 
 Even though etiquette warns against cash bars at wed-
ding receptions, budget-conscious couples (and those who 
want to put an extra brake on overindulgence) often choose 
this option. Even with a cash bar, though, you have some 
expenses. Most caterers, whether in-house or independent, 
require you to pay a minimum gratuity for the bartenders. 
Often, an extra charge kicks in if bar receipts don’t meet a 
preset minimum.
 
✓ What are your policies on deposits, cancellations, and final 
payments? Get these policies, along with the due dates for 
deposits and cancellation notices, in writing.
Managing Menu Choices
Your menu should generally reflect the formality and overall theme 
of your wedding. You can get away with more elegant food in a 
casual setting, but too-casual food in a formal setting comes across 
as miserly. You don’t want to serve hot dogs and cold cuts at an 
elegant banquet hall, for instance. Beyond that, though, you have 
pretty wide latitude in menu options. (Refer to the earlier section 
“Adjusting the Formality Dial” for examples of matching your menu 
with your venue, time of day, and budget.)
 
Here are some considerations you should keep in mind when 
choosing your menu:
 
✓ Tastes: You may love pan-seared marlin, but what if your 
guests aren’t big on seafood? Be sure to provide a variety of 
foods (while staying within the same general per-guest cost) 
so all your guests can find something they like. Be especially 
careful when you’re serving ethnic cuisine.
 
✓ Dietary needs: If any of your guests are vegetarian, vegan, dia-
betic, or otherwise restricted in their diets, try to take those 
needs into account. If you know of any food allergies among 
your guests (nuts, eggs, and so on), find out whether the 
caterer can accommodate those special needs too. And, as 
always, ask whether the caterer charges for special requests.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
178
 
✓ Ages: If children will attend your reception, ask whether 
you can order special meals for them. You may even want to 
arrange for them to eat first; hungry children can easily dis-
rupt special moments at the beginning of your reception.
 
✓ Seasons: Rich, hearty dishes hit the spot in the fall and winter; 
light fruit salads and crisp veggies are refreshing in the 
summer. Matching your menu to the season helps strike the 
right note for the reception — and it may even save you money, 
because, like flowers, in-season foods are less expensive.
No matter what kind of reception you have, you should be able to 
incorporate any special needs into your menu without breaking 
your budget. Ask your caterer for ideas on cost-effective ways to 
accommodate your guests’ needs and preferences.
Variety is the key to pleasing the greatest number of guests. Even 
with a sit-down meal, you can offer a choice of entrees so your 
guests can find something they like. And you can do it without 
wrecking your budget.
Answering the Alcohol Question
Alcohol: To serve or not to serve? This is a tricky question for 
many couples. After all, alcohol is expensive, it’s a potential party-
wrecker, and it can raise liability concerns.
 
Forgoing alcohol altogether is always an option, especially if you, 
your fiancé(e), and most of your guests are nondrinkers (or if 
you’re committed to saving big bucks on your nuptials). If you don’t 
include alcohol, you can use sparkling cider for the toasts and pro-
vide a full range of soft drinks, coffee, tea, and juices. Even this full 
range of beverages is much cheaper than a beer-and-wine bar.
Most couples choose to provide at least some alcohol at their 
receptions. If you fall into this category, read the following sections 
to find out how alcohol is priced, to discover tips for keeping costs 
down and overindulgence at a minimum, and to understand how 
much legal responsibility you may bear for your guests’ actions 
after they leave the reception.
Understanding how you 
pay for alcohol
At most reception sites, you pay for bar service either by the opened 
bottle or by a flat per-person-per-hour rate. Some charge by the 
number of drinks poured, which makes it financially imperative that 

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 179
you tell the waitstaff to leave half-full glasses alone (see “Keeping a lid 
on drunkenness” later in this chapter).
No matter which way you pay, alcohol is likely to represent a big 
chunk of your per-guest cost. Plan to spend between $10 and $45 per 
guest on the bar bill. In addition to the alcohol charges, you’ll most 
likely have to pay mandatory gratuities for the bartenders, and you 
may have to pay sales taxes. (See “Selecting a Caterer to Cook for 
the Crowd” earlier in this chapter for more on catering fees.)
 
If the venue or caterer allows you to supply your own alcohol, you 
can save a ton of money by purchasing cases of wine and liquor 
and kegs of beer from wholesalers or discount clubs like Costco 
and Sam’s Club. The venue or catering employees serve the drinks, 
but you get to keep any leftovers.
 
Some reception sites don’t allow you to bring in your own liquor or 
outside bar services. And those that do allow these options often 
charge a corking fee, which is really just a penalty for not using the 
on-site service. Be sure to ask about policies and fees when you’re 
scouting reception locations, because the corking fee may eat up 
any savings you’d realize by providing your own alcohol.
Slashing your booze bill
Traditional etiquette says that if you serve alcohol at your recep-
tion, it’s tacky to ask your guests to pay for it. However, budget-
conscious couples often defy traditional etiquette and provide a 
cash bar. In some circles, having a cash bar won’t raise a single 
eyebrow; in others, it’s considered a serious breach of manners. 
If you’re considering a cash bar, be sure to weigh potential social 
consequences against your budget constraints.
 
If your funds won’t cover a full open bar and you don’t want to 
forgo alcohol or have a cash bar, consider these options to keep 
costs down:
 
✓ Serve only beer and wine. This common compromise doesn’t 
violate any etiquette rules. As a variation, you can serve beer, 
wine, and a signature drink. This variation gives your guests 
more drink choices but still keeps expenses down.
 
✓ Close the bar during dinner. At many receptions, the bar is 
open for the cocktail hour, closed for dinner, and reopened for 
two to three hours after the meal. This pattern reduces over-
all consumption. And most guests won’t even notice that the 
bar is closed while they eat because, well, they’re busy eating. 
Besides, if you decide to have Champagne for the toasts, the 
staff will serve it to your guests at the end of the meal.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
180
 
✓ Give the caterer a consumption or dollar limit and ask to be 
alerted when your guests approach it. The bartenders can 
keep a running tab, and then you can decide whether to con-
tinue serving above and beyond the cap you set. If you choose 
this option, be sure to build a cushion into your preset limit; 
if your budget is $750, for example, set the cap at $500. That 
way, you can gracefully accommodate your guests without 
fretting about the extra expense.
 
✓ Close the bar an hour before your reception officially 
ends. Alcohol consumption usually slows down after dinner 
because people are full and busy dancing. (Consumption is 
highest during the cocktail hour.)
 
✓ Offer fewer choices later in the evening. For example, try 
switching from a full bar to beer and wine only after dinner. 
Another option would be to offer only coffee drinks — with 
Irish cream, Kahlua, or other liqueurs — after dinner. You also 
can save by closing the bar as dinner is winding down.
 
✓ Don’t offer Champagne. If you aren’t a big fan of Champagne 
(and many people aren’t), skip the bubbly and let your guests 
raise glasses filled with the beverages of their choice when 
it’s time for the toast. Alternatively, serve only Champagne — 
especially for a brunch or afternoon reception.
 
✓ Serve more affordable liquor. Even if you have a full bar, you 
don’t have to provide top-shelf liquors. Opt for recognizable 
brands, but don’t feel compelled to provide “only the best” 
(which often translates into the priciest).
 
✓ Skip the cocktail hour before dinner. Offer coffee, tea, and 
soft drinks for early arrivals at the reception site, but hold 
off on opening the bar until about 15 minutes before dinner 
is served. Most people drink less during and after a meal, so 
your consumption costs will be lower.
Keeping a lid on drunkenness
 
Unfortunately, overindulgence at wedding receptions isn’t just a 
stereotype. Sometimes an open bar seems like an invitation to drink 
as heavily as possible, and the results are never enjoyable. (Brawls 
make your wedding memorable — just not in the way that you 
hoped.) Plus, hearty drinkers can seriously inflate your bar bill.
Follow these tips to keep the flow of alcohol at reasonable levels:
 
✓ Pass the drinks. Instead of letting your guests line up at the 
bar, have waitstaff circulate with trays of wine, beer, and sig-
nature drinks. This touch of elegance controls both costs and 
consumption because you can limit how frequently the serv-
ers circulate through the crowd.

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 181
 
✓ Make your guests ask for refills during dinner. It’s easy to 
drink too much when someone continually tops off your wine 
glass every time you take a sip. Tell servers to hold off on 
refills until they’re requested. Remember, lower consumption 
means lower costs.
 
✓ Tell servers not to clear half-full glasses. Clearing glasses 
that aren’t empty is a huge money-waster, because a guest 
whose drink is gone when she returns from the dance floor 
will go to the bar and get another one — and, of course, you 
have to pay for all those extra drinks. Besides, there’s an even 
chance that, if your guests finish that half-full glass, they’ll 
decide they’ve had enough.
Considering liability issues
Liability laws regarding serving alcohol vary from state to state 
and even from city to city. Ask the caterer and reception site man-
ager about liability insurance, and check with your local govern-
ment and state liquor authority about your potential liability.
 
In some areas, you and your caterer could be held at least partly 
responsible if a guest at your wedding overindulges and is involved 
in a car accident after your reception.
Also ask the caterer what kind of training the bar and waitstaff has 
in recognizing the signs of intoxication and how they’ll handle it 
if any of your guests exhibit those signs. Intoxication isn’t a pleas-
ant issue to bring up, but it’s important, especially if you could be 
sued for damages as a result of serving alcohol at your reception.
Making Your Cake the Star
The cake is, traditionally, the centerpiece of the wedding recep-
tion. It gets its own table. Guests and the wedding photographer 
incessantly snap its picture. It’s the focal point of the cake-cutting 
ceremony. And many guests feel it’s inappropriate to leave a recep-
tion until the cake is cut.
Unfortunately, all this attention means the cake is expensive, too. 
The average wedding cake costs about $550. Add in fondant decora-
tions, cake-cutting fees, and multiple tiers with different flavors and 
fillings, and you could easily spend $1,000 or more for your cake.
However, if you know what drives up the cost of wedding cake 
(besides the word “wedding,” which increases the cost of every-
thing), you can figure out how to keep your cake expenses under 

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
182
control. And if you aren’t excited about traditional wedding cake, 
you have a range of lower-cost options to choose from.
 
Creating a multitiered masterpiece isn’t the same as baking a birth-
day cake at home. It takes real skill and care to set up the elabo-
rate mountains of cake and frosting you see in bridal magazines. 
And the higher the cake, the higher the price: A four-tier cake that 
serves 100 people costs more than a three-tier cake with the same 
number of servings.
In this section, I tell you about the average cake costs, give you 
tips on selecting a baker, and offer some less-expensive alterna-
tives to the traditional tiered cake. Figure 12-1 shows some tradi-
tional wedding cakes and some less-expensive options.
Figure 12-1: Dessert options for your reception.
Getting the skinny on average 
cake expenses
Most bakeries and pastry chefs charge by the slice for wedding 
cakes, and the cost per slice depends in large part on the amount 
of labor involved in decorating and setting up the cake.

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 183
 
For about $1.50 a slice, you can get a small tiered white or choco-
late showing cake along with a sheet cake for serving your guests. 
For around $5 a slice, you can get a two- or three-tiered cake in 
standard flavors like white, chocolate, carrot, or lemon. Cakes with 
lots of tiers, unusual fillings or flavors like red velvet, and lots of 
confectionary decoration can run $10 a slice or more.
The following sections help you navigate the many factors that go 
into wedding cake pricing.
Decorating factors
 
When it comes to cake decorations, the most important thing to 
remember is that fancy, detailed decoration takes time and skill — 
and time and skill cost money. Even the type of frosting can add to 
costs, mainly because of the labor involved. This section aims to 
help you control these costs.
Fondant, a concoction of sugar, corn syrup, and gelatin, gives cakes 
a shiny, smooth finish. But getting that smooth, silky finish takes 
a lot of time and manual labor. Usually, the cake is made, frozen, 
iced with fondant, frozen again, and topped with another layer of 
fondant to get the tops and sides perfectly smooth. All that labor 
means higher costs for you — an average of an extra $1 per slice.
 
Fondant is pretty, but it doesn’t taste very good. Opt for old-
fashioned buttercream frosting. This type of frosting is much less 
labor intensive, is a lovely ivory color (when the baker uses yellow 
butter instead of expensive imported white butter), and is more 
pleasing to the palette. And the best part is that it’s much cheaper 
than fondant. Whipped cream is another inexpensive option. It’s 
not as sweet as buttercream frosting, so it’s a nice complement to 
cakes with sweet fruit fillings.
Fondant and sugar decorations in shapes of things like flowers 
and strands of pearls also add to the labor and cost of a cake. To 
cut these costs, consider asking your baker to decorate with fresh 
flowers, ribbons, or strings of faux beads from your local craft, 
party, or dollar store; you can save a lot on your baker’s bill and 
still have a beautiful, unique centerpiece for your reception.
Setup and delivery factors
 
Delivery and setup fees can add $50 to $100 or more to your total 
cost, depending on the distance from the bakery to your reception 
site and how complex the setup is. Generally, these fees are lower 
if your cake display is simple; however, some bakeries charge a flat 
rate regardless of distance or setup difficulty. Ask about the deliv-
ery radius, too; the baker may charge extra if your site is outside a 
certain range, because of the extra travel time and fuel costs.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
184
Other cost-adding factors
How many ways can you bump up the cost of a wedding cake? 
They’re almost endless. Here are some of the most common 
“extras” that add significantly to the price:
 
✓ Multiple flavors and fillings: The trend lately has been to 
make each tier a different combination of cake and filling fla-
vors. This adds to the labor, which in turn can add $0.50 to $1 
to the per-slice cost. Stick with standard flavors and fillings to 
keep costs down.
 
✓ Nuts and dried fruits: Adding nuts and dried fruits is another 
way to break from the traditional white wedding cake, but 
it’s also another way to add up to $1 per slice. Besides, if 
any of your guests have nut allergies, this option can cause 
problems. Buck the trend and opt for cream filling and simple 
frosting adornments.
 
✓ Caterer’s markups: Some caterers, hotels, and reception 
halls have their own pastry chefs, but many don’t. So when 
they suggest you purchase your cake through them, they 
outsource the job and then charge you a hefty markup — 
sometimes as much as 30 percent. Compare the caterer’s or 
venue’s per-slice prices with independent bakeries before 
making your decision.
 
✓ Cake-cutting fees: If you dodge the caterer’s markup by hiring 
your own baker, you’ll likely encounter a cake-cutting fee, usu-
ally a minimum of $1 per slice. You may be able to negotiate 
a lower fee; if you can’t, be sure to factor this cost into your 
budget.
Selecting a baker
Price, skill, and service can vary widely among bakeries, so it’s 
important to do some comparison shopping before you hire a 
baker.
 
Because they don’t have the staff to set up dozens of cakes every 
Saturday, smaller bakeries often do only a handful of weddings per 
day. So their slots fill up fast. To make sure you get the vendor you 
want, start your search early.
Here are some tips to help you in your quest for the perfect baker:
 
✓ Ask to see a portfolio of the baker’s work. Even the small-
est bakeries should have a photo album of wedding cakes 
they’ve made. Look for pleasing decorations and professional 
setup. Even in amateur snapshots, you should be able to see 
whether the cake display looks good.

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 185
 
✓ Find out how many wedding cakes the baker or his staff set 
up on a typical day. Large bakeries may deliver a dozen or 
more cakes per day, especially at the height of the wedding 
season. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but you do want 
to know whether your cake display will be left unattended for 
hours before your reception. If so, move on to another baker, 
because long periods of inattention could be disastrous. Ask 
when your cake will be delivered (you want it set up no more 
than two hours before your reception) and how the staff will 
coordinate with the reception site to make sure the display is 
protected from accidental damage.
 
 If your wedding is on a weekday, a Sunday afternoon, or a 
holiday weekend, ask whether the bakery slaps you with a 
surcharge for overtime. Some bakeries don’t regularly provide 
delivery and setup staff on these less traditional wedding 
days, so you may have to pay extra.
 
✓ Ask for a breakdown of fees. Some bakeries charge a flat 
per-slice fee plus delivery and setup, and others break down 
their fees for each component — cake flavor, filling, fondant, 
decorations, and so on. Either way, get a written estimate that 
identifies what’s included for the quoted price. Also find out 
about deposit requirements and refund policies.
 
✓ Request a taste test. Most bakeries let you try different cake 
flavors before you decide which one you want. However, 
many only offer taste tests on days when they’re baking wed-
ding cakes. Some may charge a nominal fee.
 
✓ Ask who’s responsible for non-confectionery decorations. If 
you want to use fresh flowers, ribbons, or other decorations, 
find out the logistics of getting those decorations to the baker 
for setup. Some bakers coordinate with your florist; others 
ask you to make sure the florist delivers the cake flowers to 
the right place at the right time. If you’re providing ribbon or 
other decorations, plan to drop them off at the baker’s shop 
a few days before the wedding — and be sure to get written 
confirmation that you’ve delivered them.
Cutting your cake costs
Many brides and grooms have come up with creative — and tasty — 
ways to keep their wedding cake costs under control. Some choose 
“regular” cakes instead of traditional wedding cakes; many grocery 
store bakeries and even discounters like Wal-Mart have delicious 
and beautifully decorated cakes that cost far less than a traditional 
wedding cake. Here are some other ideas to keep cake costs down:

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
186
 
✓ Save the cost of building a tiered cake, but still have a 
beautiful display. For example, instead of paying your baker 
to set up an elaborate tiered cake, have her make several 
round cakes. You can then place one on a tall cake stand and 
the others at varying heights on the table (to achieve visual 
depth). For extra decoration, run ribbons in your wedding 
colors from the central cake to the side cakes. While a tiered 
cake may cost $400 or more, a selection of nicely decorated 
rounds may cost less than $200.
 
✓ Ask your caterer or reception site coordinator whether 
she has an in-house pastry chef. You may find that it’s less 
expensive to have your caterer supply your cake if it’s done 
in-house. (If the caterer contracts with an outside bakery, 
you’ll pay a markup.) With an in-house pastry chef, you’ll save 
on — or be able to negotiate away — delivery and setup fees 
and the cake-cutting fee that most companies charge when 
you bring in a cake from another baker.
 
✓ Check out cakes at places like Wal-Mart, Costco, Sam’s Club, 
or even your favorite grocery store. You can get cakes of dif-
ferent sizes (and different flavors) and then display them on a 
multilevel dessert tray or cake stands of varying heights. Your 
costs may be half — or less — the expense of a traditional 
wedding cake.
 
✓ Hire a cake-baking/decorating instructor. Check out your 
local community college or craft store to see whether either 
offers a cake-decorating class; if so, the instructor may be will-
ing to create your cake at a significant discount from a tradi-
tional baker.
 
✓ Use small cakes as centerpieces. Instead of one big, elaborate 
cake, have your baker make a small cake for each table — or 
purchase them from your favorite grocery store. Buy glass 
cake stands from your local dollar or discount store, or shop 
thrift stores and garage sales for inexpensive and unique cake 
plates. Small cakes require less labor to decorate, so the per-
slice cost can be 30 percent to 50 percent lower. And, after 
the wedding, you can donate the extra cake stands to a non-
profit thrift shop (and possibly deduct the donation on your 
income taxes).
 
✓ Bypass the groom’s cake. I guarantee your guests won’t miss 
it. Another option is to purchase a birthday cake from your 
favorite grocery store bakery — minus the “Happy Birthday” 
message, of course — to use as your groom’s cake. You’ll 
avoid the inevitable wedding markup if you go this route.

 Chapter 12: Feeding the Hordes 187
 
✓ Order enough cake for only three-quarters of your guests. 
Some people will leave before the cake is served, and others 
just won’t have dessert. This option is especially helpful if you 
plan to have a sweets table in addition to the cake.
 
✓ Ask the caterer to cut smaller slices. A 2-inch slice is still a 
substantial dessert portion, and you’ll get more servings out 
of your cake.
 
Plan for you and your new spouse to personally serve trays of cook-
ies or biscotti to your guests after dinner and before the cake is 
served. It’s a nice way for you to ensure that you greet each of your 
guests and thank them for being there. Plus, cookies are less expen-
sive than wedding cake, and many people prefer to have a small 
cookie instead of a big piece of cake, especially after a heavy meal.
 
Some bridal experts recommend having your baker make only the 
top tier of your cake — the one you’ll cut into — and decorating a 
Styrofoam dummy for the rest of the tiers. The idea is that you can 
save money by having sheet cakes (which don’t require the same 
labor-intensive decoration) to serve your guests. Your guests prob-
ably won’t know the difference, but this tactic doesn’t always save 
you money. After all, you still have to pay for the materials and 
labor involved in decorating the dummy cake, and you have to pay 
for the sheet cake as well. In some cases, a real tiered cake can be 
significantly less expensive.
However, you can save money if you have a small “show” cake 
for cutting and a sheet cake for serving to guests. Ask your baker 
about price differences so you can decide whether the savings out-
weigh your vision of a grand edifice of a wedding cake.
Looking at low-cost alternatives
Of course, no law exists that says you have to have a traditional 
wedding cake. Other dessert options can be significantly cheaper — 
as little as half the per-serving cost of cake — and more fun and 
unique.
Some simple, low-cost alternatives include the following:
 
✓ Cheesecake
 
✓ Chocolate fountain with fruit, pretzels, and potato chips for 
dipping
 
✓ Cookies, bars, and brownies
 
✓ Cupcake trees

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
188
 
✓ Ice cream novelties
 
✓ Mini tarts
 
✓ Pies
Grocery-based bakeries and independent shops can make deli-
cious desserts for virtually any budget; you just have to commu-
nicate your wishes and budget limits to the baker. The baker may 
even have ideas beyond the options listed here.
 
To save even more money, consider enlisting the help of friends 
and family to create your dessert buffet. Building and decorating 
a traditional wedding cake takes skill and experience, and well-
meaning friends who offer to “do your cake” may get in over their 
heads. But cookies, tarts, and pies don’t require specialized deco-
ration or setup, and they lend a wonderful homemade touch to 
your celebration.
You can serve alternative desserts in any number of ways: as a 
dessert buffet, as centerpieces on your tables, or as butler-passed 
treats. For ice cream desserts, a self-serve freezer or staffed ice 
cream bar work best.
 
Cupcakes in lieu of the traditional wedding cake are trendy, but 
they aren’t always cheaper. Remember that much of the cost lies 
in the labor, and elaborately decorated cupcakes are just as labor-
intensive as a traditional cake — and maybe even more so. If you 
want cupcakes, consider simple colored frosting instead of elabo-
rate details to keep costs down.

L
ots of things go into a memorable wedding, but couples and 
guests don’t always have the same perspective on what really 
matters at a reception. Various surveys over the past decade have 
shown that couples tend to put the highest priority on food and 
drink, but guests tend to remember the entertainment first, food 
second, and decorations last.
Interestingly, couples and guests’ views align more closely after the 
wedding: Within a week after their receptions, 78 percent of brides 
say they wish they’d put more emphasis on choosing their enter-
tainment, and 81 percent of guests cite entertainment as the most 
memorable element of a wedding.
This chapter focuses on getting the best entertainment and deco-
ration values without sacrificing style or fun. After all, the impor-
tant thing is not how much you spend but how what you do spend 
helps everyone have a good time.
Using Music to Set the Tone 
for the Reception
Your DJ or band leader is more than an entertainer: He’s the 
master of ceremonies for your reception. He makes sure the 
entire event flows smoothly, covers all the elements (your first 
dance, the cake cutting, and so on), and involves your guests. 

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
190
So, whether you choose live or recorded music, you want an 
emcee who knows how to make a party go.
 
Aside from personal preference, your budget may dictate whether 
you hire a DJ or a band. DJs usually are less expensive than a band, 
but make sure your DJ is skilled in keeping things moving so your 
guests don’t get bored. Even though bands typically cost more, 
good ones get the crowd fired up and keep the dance floor filled.
You don’t have to hire a DJ or band for your reception, because no 
rule says that you have to even offer dancing. For a brunch, tea, 
or cocktail reception, for example, you may only want background 
music, in which case a friend or relative can be in charge of making 
sure the CDs or MP3 player keep playing. (See Chapter 12 for 
details about these and other kinds of receptions.)
If you do decide to hire a DJ or band, read on, because in the fol-
lowing sections, I give you the lowdown on choosing a music pro-
fessional who’s a good match for you and your reception.
Enlisting a DJ
DJ rates vary widely depending on the market and the DJ’s experi-
ence, equipment, and showmanship. For a four-hour reception, you 
may pay anywhere from $400 to $2,000 for a professional, but the 
general range is between $100 and $300 an hour — again, depend-
ing on several variables. The following sections help you choose a 
DJ and understand how payments work.
Selecting a good match
The DJ’s personality and professionalism — or lack thereof — can 
have a bigger impact on how you remember your wedding than any 
other single factor. That’s because the DJ sets the tone for the party.
She can be a polished emcee, imperceptibly guiding the timing and 
flow of the event, reading the crowd to decide whether they’re in 
the mood for a slow dance or the Electric Slide, and making sure all 
the high points are covered. Or she can be ineffectual and unable 
to gain the guests’ attention. Worst of all, she could be an obnox-
ious boor, helping herself too frequently to the open bar, making 
ill-timed and ill-mannered jokes, and generally turning off your 
guests and prompting them to leave early.
 
The latter situation shows why it’s so important to meet potential 
DJs in person. You want to assess the DJ’s personality, her speaking 
style (not just the quality of her voice), her attitude toward her job, 
and even her attitude toward weddings and marriage. (Refer to the 
later section “Asking the right questions” for more information.)

 Chapter 13: Arranging Entertainment and Preparing the Venue 191
 
Ask to see video of the DJ at a wedding. You don’t want a compi-
lation or fancily produced video, just footage of the DJ directing 
the show. Pay attention to both the newlyweds’ and the guests’ 
reactions, and get a feel for the energy and “vibe” of the reception. 
Seeing the DJ in action helps you gauge how well she’ll fit in with 
your vision for your own wedding.
Understanding what you’re paying for
To avoid unpleasant surprises, make sure you know what’s 
included in a DJ’s quoted price and what costs extra. You may not 
be able to negotiate away extras, but at least your budget won’t 
crack under an unexpected strain.
A typical wedding DJ package should include
 
✓ At least one consultation to plan your reception
 
✓ A customized music list
 
✓ At least four hours of music
 
✓ At least one audio mixer
 
✓ At least one microphone
 
✓ Multidisc CD player(s)
 
✓ Setup/tear-down time
 
If a package doesn’t include these things, you may be dealing with 
an inexperienced DJ. In that case, ask lots of questions about the 
DJ’s equipment and music library to make sure he can handle the 
gig. If either the equipment or music selection seems inadequate to 
you, look for another DJ.
Items that usually cost extra include
 
✓ Overtime: The DJ’s overtime charges may be either time-
and-a-half or double time. Overtime for a $100-per-hour DJ, 
for example, may be between $150 and $200. Find out when 
overtime is triggered — some DJs start the OT clock if they 
go 15 minutes over the contracted time, and some give you a 
30-minute grace period. You may have to pay overtime fees in 
cash; this policy should be spelled out in your contract.
 
✓ An assistant: The cost for an assistant may or may not be 
included in the package. If it isn’t, make sure you know how 
much you’re paying for the assistant and how much overtime 
for the assistant costs (see the preceding bullet).
 
✓ Meals and drinks: Some DJs ask that they (and any assistants) 
be fed before or during the reception. You can arrange with your 
caterer to provide box lunches and bottled water or soft drinks.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
192
 
 Common sense dictates that the DJ shouldn’t drink alcohol at 
your reception. After all, he’s supposed to be a professional, 
and you’re paying him to entertain your guests, not party with 
them. Unfortunately, DJs have been known to overindulge at 
weddings. So make it clear to your DJ that the bar is off-limits 
at your reception. If he argues with you, find another DJ.
 
✓ Mileage: You’ll usually only encounter this extra fee if the 
DJ is traveling a long distance to spin at your wedding. Find 
out whether your DJ charges for mileage and how much he’ll 
charge.
 
✓ Additional time: You may pay for additional time if the DJ 
also is handling your ceremony music and has to attend the 
rehearsal, for example.
 
✓ The tip: Tips are generally required for DJs. The average tip is 
$50 to $100. (See Chapter 2 for more on which vendors usually 
get tips.)
As with any vendor, make sure the terms of your contract are in 
writing before you hand over a deposit. Check out the later section 
“Asking the right questions” to find out more about deposits.
Hiring a band
Bands are generally more expensive than DJs; hourly rates can 
easily range from $450 to $750. As with DJs, though, actual rates 
vary widely, particularly in large metropolitan areas, which can 
support more live bands. So make sure you do your research 
before settling on a band.
 
The bandleader should be able to act as emcee for your reception, 
the same way a DJ does. So personality matters. Even if you’re 
familiar with the band, make a point of interviewing the leader in 
person so you can decide whether his style meshes with yours. 
(The later section “Asking the right questions” provides some tips 
for successfully interviewing the bandleader.)
 
Some bands may try to impress you with slick music videos. But 
keep in mind that the skills required for making a high-quality 
video don’t necessarily translate into a good live performance. 
If you haven’t heard the band in person, ask for an audition. Or 
ask for a video of the band actually performing at a wedding; raw, 
unedited footage gives you the truest sense of how the band acts 
and sounds in front of a live audience.
In the upcoming sections, I help you determine the type of band 
music you’d like to have at your reception, and I also tell you 
what’s included in an average wedding band package.

 Chapter 13: Arranging Entertainment and Preparing the Venue 193
Getting the sound you want
Cover bands, which typically play a variety of music from a variety 
of artists, are the most popular for weddings. Some cover bands 
specialize in certain types of music, such as ’80s tunes or country 
music. Others have a more general repertoire and play everything 
from Nat King Cole to Carrie Underwood.
Specialty bands can really bring a theme wedding to life. A calypso 
band is a great choice for a beach wedding, for example. A jazz 
trio, a swing band, or a Big Band group can provide just the right 
musical ambience for a cocktail reception. And karaoke bands are 
increasingly popular for weddings, because guests get to choose 
songs and serenade the newlyweds.
 
Keep your guests in mind when deciding on a particular style of 
music. If your friends and family don’t even sing in the shower, a 
karaoke band probably isn’t the best choice for a fun, memorable 
reception. Similarly, if most of your guests are into current music, 
a 1950s cover band will likely flop, too.
Knowing what’s included — and what’s not
Wedding band packages may vary a great deal, so it’s important 
to understand what the quoted price includes and what you have 
to pay extra for. In this section, I give you a general idea of what is 
and isn’t covered, but be sure to check with your prospective band 
before signing anything.
The package price for the average wedding band will likely cover
 
✓ At least one consultation to go over your music list and other 
details
 
✓ The musicians’ playing time (excluding overtime)
 
✓ Amplifiers and other equipment
 
✓ Sheet music
 
✓ Emcee services (including microphone and loudspeaker)
 
✓ Setup and tear-down time
 
Even though setup and tear-down is usually included in the price, 
you may be charged extra if your reception site presents signifi-
cant extra labor — if the band members have to carry their instru-
ments and equipment up several flights of stairs or across the 
equivalent of a football field, for example. Be sure to discuss any 
potential setup issues at your first meeting to avoid an unexpected 
expense later.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests

The list of extras — which come with additional price tags — may 
include the following:
 
✓ Overtime fees (which may be charged if you want the band 
to play for five hours instead of the standard four, or if your 
reception goes past the closing time specified in your contract)
 
✓ Meals and drinks for band members
 
✓ Backdrops or stage lighting
 
✓ Additional microphones for karaoke, toasts, and so on
Make sure you have the contract details in writing before you give 
the band a deposit.
Asking the right questions
If you’re like most people, your wedding is the only occasion when 
you’ll hire a DJ or a band. Your lack of experience in this depart-
ment can make interviewing candidates a little intimidating. But if 
you know what questions to ask, you can feel more confident that 
the entertainer you select will deliver what you want — and what 
you expect — for the price that fits your budget.
Here are some things you need to know, whether you’re interview-
ing DJs or live bands:
 
✓ Who will actually be performing at my reception? If you’re 
going through an agent or company for DJ services, make sure 
you get to speak with the DJ who will be at your reception, 
and ask whether that person is guaranteed to be there. For 
bands, ask which band members will be at your reception, 
and, of course, whether they’re guaranteed to be there.
 
 DJs sometimes bring assistants, and the typical wedding band 
has five members, so be sure to budget for all of them to be 
included in your meal count for the caterer.
 
✓ Do you take breaks during the evening? DJs don’t usually 
take breaks, but bands typically split a four-hour reception 
into three sets, with roughly 15-minute breaks in between. If 
a band or DJ does take breaks, find out whether they provide 
recorded music (and the equipment to play it) during those 
breaks. Experienced pros provide recorded music during 
breaks because they know that guests tend to leave when the 
music stops. If your candidate doesn’t provide break music, I 
suggest looking elsewhere.

 Chapter 13: Arranging Entertainment and Preparing the Venue 195
 
✓ What kind of experience do you have? Ask how long the 
DJ or band has been performing at weddings and how many 
weddings they do in a typical year. Lack of experience isn’t 
necessarily a deal-breaker, but your reception may not flow 
quite as seamlessly as it would with a seasoned pro.
 
✓ What was your favorite wedding gig like? This question 
gives you a chance to find out what a DJ or band really enjoys 
about doing weddings and provides a natural springboard to 
talking about what you do and don’t want for your reception. 
This type of chat is an easy way to gauge whether this per-
former is a good fit for you.
 
✓ When and how would you go over the details of my recep-
tion? The DJ or bandleader should meet with you a couple 
weeks before your wedding to confirm your music list, the 
roll of people to be announced, your expected toasts, and 
the special moments you’ve chosen, such as the cake cutting 
and special dances. You can meet in person or talk over the 
phone, but you may prefer the face-to-face meeting if your 
instructions are complicated or if you have more questions. 
This final meeting should be included in the quoted price.
 
✓ Have you performed at my reception site? If the DJ or band 
isn’t familiar with the site, ask for a list of setup require-
ments; you can then consult with the venue to find out what 
it provides. This question opens the discussion to any special 
needs the DJ or band may have, such as extension cords for 
outdoor venues or hand trucks for moving equipment over 
long distances.
 
✓ Do you provide any additional services? Some DJ companies 
offer slide shows, video services, and even live video moni-
toring of the dance floor and moments like the cake cutting. 
These services typically cost extra, so make sure you know 
what the fees are before you sign a contract.
 
✓ Do you have insurance? Professionals should always carry 
insurance that covers accidents involving themselves and 
others. For instance, find out who’s responsible for medical 
bills and other damages if the performer is injured at your 
reception site. Similarly, discuss what happens if one of your 
guests trips on the DJ’s power cord and injures himself.
 
✓ How much of a deposit do you require, and when does it have 
to be paid? Most DJs and bands ask for a 50 percent deposit. 
Few will hold the date unless you put down a deposit — 
especially if your wedding date is at the height of wedding 
season. Be sure to find out whether deposits are refundable. 
Policies on this vary, and the closer you get to the wedding 
date, the less likely you are to get the full deposit back.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
196
 
 If you like a DJ or band but aren’t quite ready to put down a 
deposit, ask whether you can have “right of first refusal” for 
your wedding day. That way, if someone else wants to book 
the same day and time, the DJ or bandleader will call you and 
ask whether you’re still interested. If you are, you have to pay 
the deposit; if not, you just say, “No, thank you,” and the DJ or 
band can then book the other client.
 
✓ What happens if you don’t show up? This may sound like 
a rude question, but it’s a vital one. You want to find out 
whether the DJ will provide a replacement if she gets sick, or 
whether the band has a backup in case a member is injured in 
an accident. And, last but not least, if somebody just doesn’t 
show (a horrifying thought, I know, but it does happen), who 
should you contact and what happens to your deposit?
Pay attention to the questions the DJ or bandleader asks you, 
too. Pros will want to make sure they understand your tastes and 
desires; they’ll make an effort to learn a little about you and your 
fiancé(e). Candidates who seem more interested in telling you 
what they play or reminding you of what a great deal you’re getting 
may disappoint you on your big day.
 
After you get the answers to the questions in the preceding list, ask 
for a detailed written estimate that spells out what’s included in the 
fee, the deposit policies, and any additional services you may be 
charged for, such as overtime, mileage, extra setup costs, and so on. 
And, of course, be sure all this information is included — along with 
specific dates and times — in any contract you sign.
Trimming Entertainment Costs
Entertainment is an important expense that you don’t want to 
scrimp on, but that doesn’t mean you can’t save a little cash along 
the way. In this section, I show you how your wedding date and 
time can save you big bucks, and I also provide some other tips for 
cutting your entertainment costs.
Choosing a budget-friendly 
wedding date and time
Like anything else wedding-related, the easiest way to cut your 
entertainment expenses is to get married at an off-peak time: a 
weekday afternoon or evening, a Saturday in November or January, 
or a Sunday in June. (See Chapter 3 for more information on select-
ing an off-peak time for your wedding.)

 Chapter 13: Arranging Entertainment and Preparing the Venue 197
 
Even DJs and bands that do a lot of weddings often perform at 
other functions, too, so you may run into nonwedding conflicts 
with your date. High-demand times for these entertainers include 
the winter holiday season, graduation parties in June and July, and 
social dances in the fall and spring. Friday and Saturday nights are, 
naturally, the most likely to be booked first.
The time of your reception matters, too. Many DJs and bands book 
two events on high-demand days: one in the afternoon and one in 
the evening. Afternoon events typically end by 5 p.m., and evening 
events usually don’t start until 7 p.m. The time in between allows 
the performer to move and reset his equipment.
Events that end later than 5 p.m. or begin earlier than 7 p.m. are 
called crossovers, and they can be significantly more expensive than 
a typical afternoon or evening gig. It makes sense from the per-
former’s point of view, because if you plan to end your reception at 
7 p.m. or start at 5 p.m., you eliminate the DJ’s or band’s ability to 
book another paying gig that day. So it’s only fair that you compen-
sate the performer, at least partially, for that lost potential income. 
You can save yourself the extra expense by scheduling your recep-
tion to end by 5 p.m. or to start no earlier than 7 p.m.
Saving a bundle with 
some helpful hints
Beyond choosing a frugal wedding date and reception time (see 
the preceding section), you have several other options for keeping 
your entertainment expenses down. Here are a few:
 
✓ Have your DJ or band do double duty. Hiring one DJ or band 
for both the ceremony and the reception may save you some 
money in your overall budget, especially if you don’t have a 
long gap between the two. Ask whether the band’s singer is 
willing to be the soloist for your ceremony, or whether the 
DJ is willing to run the music for you. Find out what the extra 
service would cost, and then compare it to the cost of using 
separate services (including things like buying a gift for a rela-
tive or friend to sing at your ceremony).
 
 Some places of worship don’t allow you to bring in outside 
music or musicians. Be sure to check with your ceremony site 
before building this potential savings into your budget.
 
✓ Rent a sound system and enlist a friend to emcee. You can 
rent equipment for around $300; the price likely will include 
a multidisc CD player, a mixer, two speakers, and a wireless 
microphone. To find a rental company, look under the Audio 
Visual Equipment category in the phone book.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
198
 
 If you decide to go this route, make sure the speakers are 
powerful enough to fill the space at your reception. Even 
though small speakers can put out wonderful sound, you may 
need extras to make the sound big enough for your reception 
hall. The rental company should be able to help you deter-
mine the number of speakers to use.
 
✓ Rent a karaoke machine. A package with all the bells and 
whistles — an extensive song list, several microphones, a 
projector and monitor so guests can sing along, and even 
tambourines — can cost less than $1,000 (including delivery 
fees) for a Saturday evening in big cities. Weekday prices usu-
ally are cheaper except during December, when holiday par-
ties drive up demand. Ask a friend to emcee for the reception 
highlights and be in charge of the karaoke sign-up sheet.
 
 To ensure variety and the best experience for your guests, 
a karaoke package should have a minimum of 5,000 songs to 
choose from.
 
✓ Buy or rent an MP3 sound system. This type of system is a great 
way to customize your music list and save money. You can rent 
a system for around $200 a day, or you can purchase one for 
around $750 — and have it to use in your newlywed home, to 
boot. Some of these systems work best in smaller rooms, but 
customers on review sites report using them for large outdoor 
events and being quite satisfied with the performance.
Creating a Party Atmosphere 
with Reception Decorations
Ask any seasoned party thrower and she’ll tell you that there are 
three main ingredients to a great party: entertainment, which is 
covered earlier in this chapter; food and drink, which I discuss in 
Chapter 12; and décor, which is the focus of this section.
Depending on the site you choose, you may not need much in 
the way of decoration. But even if you intend to transform a plain 
meeting hall into an elegant party room, you can do it without 
straining your budget.
 
To get started, take some snapshots of your reception site and 
ask the site manager for a floor plan. These materials can help you 
decide where you want to focus your decorating and visualize how 
the site will look when you’re done dressing it up. They also can 
help you identify decoration ideas that won’t work as well.

 Chapter 13: Arranging Entertainment and Preparing the Venue 199
In this section, I help you determine the best centerpieces and 
other decorations for your wedding reception.
Deciding on centerpieces
Floral centerpieces are the most common choice for wedding 
receptions (see Chapter 8), but they’re by no means the only 
option. In fact, you have nearly unlimited alternatives that often 
are much less expensive — and more fun for you and your guests.
 
If you choose floral centerpieces, keep costs down by opting for 
simple, smaller arrangements with a few in-season flowers and 
lots of greenery (which is usually less expensive than blooms). 
Figure 13-1 shows some floral centerpiece designs.
Figure 13-1: Some floral centerpiece options.
When it comes to centerpieces, keep in mind that it isn’t how they 
look but how they affect your guests’ experience that is important. 
Your wedding reception is a social occasion, and your guests want 
to talk and make eye contact with each other. A bulky centerpiece 
that blocks the line of sight across the table is awkward and irritat-
ing. Instead, go for something that won’t stifle the “feast of reason 
and flow of soul.”

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
200
 
Many reception halls provide centerpieces at no extra charge; 
they’re often included in the setup fee. For example, the venue 
may provide you with centerpieces of mirrored tiles and tealights 
in frosted glass holders — a simple and elegant arrangement that 
doesn’t interfere with guests’ eye contact or conversation.
As noted earlier, centerpiece possibilities are virtually endless. 
The following sections represent just a few fun and inexpensive 
ideas that may fit both your vision and your budget. Figure 13-2 
provides illustrations of some of these ideas.
Figure 13-2: Inexpensive centerpieces.
Going seasonal
You don’t have to use a particular season as a theme throughout 
your wedding to make good use of seasonal items in your table 
decorations. For example, you can turn a simple glass bowl and a 
candle that matches your color scheme into several different cen-
terpieces depending on the season. The following are just a few of 
the many options you have:
 
✓ In the winter: Fill the bowl with pine cones and a few sprigs of 
holly or mistletoe and then place the candle in the center.

 Chapter 13: Arranging Entertainment and Preparing the Venue 201
 
✓ In the fall: Use the same display but choose small gourds and 
colored leaves or fall flowers like asters or mums instead of 
pine cones and holly.
 
✓ In the summer: Place your candle in the center and then fill 
the bowl with real or wax fruit. Lemons, limes, and oranges 
are especially colorful and summery.
 
✓ In the spring: Scatter colored glass stones or pastel-colored 
crepe streamers around your candle. Just be sure the candle 
won’t burn down far enough to ignite the paper.
You can get most of these materials from your local craft or dollar 
store, and the total cost will be around $5 per centerpiece. Not bad!
Another option that you can adapt to any season: Wrap empty 
boxes in paper, ribbons, and bows that match or complement your 
wedding colors, and stack a few in the middle of each table.
Opting for edible arrangements
Edible centerpieces are gaining popularity, partly because they’re 
different from the usual floral centerpiece, and partly because they 
can be much less expensive. Here are a few suggestions, but don’t 
be afraid to let your imagination off the leash:
 
✓ Give guests dessert up front. Fill a tiered serving tray with 
mini cupcakes, fruit tarts, bite-sized pieces of cheesecake, 
cookies, or other sweets. You can do this in addition to or in 
lieu of a traditional wedding cake. Keep in mind that it may be 
cheaper to have sweet-filled centerpieces and a small wedding 
cake for cutting.
 
✓ Make snacking easy. Fill glass serving bowls (provided by 
your caterer or reception site, or purchased from your local 
dollar store) with candy or snack mix and colorful plastic 
scoops. Or have the caterer provide appetizer platters for 
each table.
 
 This centerpiece idea could save you money by doubling as 
favors for your guests. Simply leave treat bags at each place 
setting and guests can dip up some goodies to take home. 
(See Chapter 17 for more fun and inexpensive favor ideas.)
 
✓ Go for the at-home feel. Make the food the centerpiece by 
asking the caterer to serve the meal family-style. Most cater-
ers set condiments or serving chargers in the middle of the 
table for family-style serving. This serving style is a good way 
to promote conversation among your guests; it’s difficult to 
remain silent when you’re passing platters of food around 
the table.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
202
Giving guests something to talk about
Many couples create photo collages for their receptions, show-
ing themselves growing up and during their courtship. It’s easy to 
turn this idea into an unusual (and inexpensive) centerpiece by 
creating photo pyramids. It’s a great conversation starter for your 
guests. For a broader personal touch, consider using photos of the 
couples in your wedding party, including attendants, parents, and 
grandparents.
Follow these steps to make your own photo pyramids:
 
1. Make copies of the photos you want to use.
 
 Office supply stores and retailers like Wal-Mart make 
copies for a few cents each.
 
2. For each centerpiece, collect three boxes of different sizes.
 
 The largest should be about the size of a shoe box. The 
smallest should be about the size of a wristwatch box — no 
smaller, because smaller boxes won’t provide enough sup-
port for the photos.
 
3. Cover each box with wrapping paper or fabric that 
complements your color scheme. Then stack the covered 
boxes three high, with the largest at the base and the 
smallest at the top.
 
 Glue or tape the boxes together so they don’t move.
 
4. Glue or tape your photos to posterboard that’s cut to fit 
the photo.
 
 Placing your photos on the posterboard helps to prevent 
the photos from curling and sagging, so don’t skip this 
seemingly unnecessary step.
 
5. Arrange the photos around the tiers formed by the 
stacked boxes, and tape or glue them in place so they 
don’t fall off.
 
 If you want, you can place the photo pyramids on Lazy 
Susans to allow guests to easily look at all the pictures. You 
can get plastic Lazy Susans at your local dollar or discount 
store and dress them up with ribbon or with the same 
wrapping paper or fabric you use for the boxes.
If photo pyramids seem like too much effort, try this adaptation: 
Buy three 8 x 10 photo frames per table, fill them with your favorite 
prints, and arrange them in a triangle in the middle of the table. 
You can get inexpensive frames at your local dollar store. To add 
flair and texture, purchase a mix of styles. Also consider using mul-
tiple smaller prints in the frames.

 Chapter 13: Arranging Entertainment and Preparing the Venue 203
Putting favors in the center spot
Many couples save money by having their favors do double duty 
as centerpieces. Here are a couple quick ideas:
 
✓ Use clay flower pots (paint them with your wedding colors), 
rocks, and branches to create “favor trees.” Then you can 
hang your favors on the branches with ribbon or fishing line. 
Get artificial dried branches, as well as floral foam to secure 
them, at your local craft store.
 
✓ Place your favors around a grouping of pillar candles of vary-
ing heights.
 
✓ Buy glass cake plates from your local dollar store and arrange 
the favors on them; drape ribbons or beads over and around 
the cake plate to add color.
Flip to Chapter 17 for ideas on inexpensive favors and more ways 
to make them do double duty as part of your décor.
Choosing other decorations
Centerpieces aren’t the only decorations you want for your recep-
tion. You also want to consider sprucing up the entryway, the cake 
and gift tables, the guest book table, and perhaps even the walls 
and ceilings, depending on the existing decoration of the venue.
Here are some inexpensive options to dress up your venue:
 
✓ Balloons: Choose balloons that go with your color scheme, 
and then group them in bunches at the corners of your gift 
and cake tables. You can string a series of balloons along the 
front of your head table, too, instead of having a floral spray.
 
✓ Ribbons, bows, and streamers: Bring out your wedding 
colors by draping coordinating ribbons, bows, or crepe 
streamers along table tops or around the edges of tables.
 
✓ Miniature lights: If your venue has lots of pillars, railings, or 
potted plants, create a festive atmosphere by stringing them 
with miniature lights. Clear lights go with any color scheme, 
but you also can find them in solid colors, too. Wrap them in 
lengths of tulle from your local craft or fabric store.
 
 If your timeline allows, shop for miniature lights immediately 
after Christmas. At this time, you probably can get them for 
half or a quarter of the regular price. If that won’t work for 
your schedule, ask friends and family if they have lights you 
can use.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
204
What about the walls and ceiling? If your site is a reception hall, 
don’t worry about dressing up the perimeter; your guests will be 
focused on the food and entertainment and probably won’t even 
notice if you drape the chandeliers with ivory cloth that matches 
your gown.
 
Chair bows and covers are lovely accents, but they’re a lot more 
expensive than you may think. Many reception halls charge you 
$2 to $3 for the covers, plus another per-chair fee for ironing and 
installing them. If you’re planning on 100 guests, you could easily 
spend $500 or more just on chair covers, which may not fit well in 
your budget or your list of priorities.
If your site is less upscale, though — say a park pavilion or a meet-
ing room — you may want to consider ways to soften fluorescent 
lights or cover wall decorations that can’t be moved (such as 
trophy cases and portraits of club leaders). Some sites provide 
pipe and drape — a system of poles and cloth — for an additional 
fee (although you may not have a choice of drape colors). You may 
be able to rent pipe and drape from another vendor as well. You 
can attach balloons, ribbons, and streamers to the drape if you feel 
as if it needs dressing up.
Soften harsh fluorescent lighting by attaching cloth or closely 
grouped streamers to the overhead fixtures. Be sure to let the 
material sag several inches below the lights; this creates a pretty 
draping effect and prevents the material from getting too hot.

Chapter 14
Making the Most 
of Prewedding and 
Postwedding Events
In This Chapter
▶ Managing costs for the rehearsal dinner
▶ Spending time with your wedding party
▶ Playing the perfect host to out-of-town guests
▶ Including those who can’t attend your wedding
W
ith all the focus on the ceremony and reception, it’s easy 
to forget that your wedding encompasses a whole collec-
tion of activities. The rehearsal dinner, of course, is near the top of 
that list, but you may end up planning several other events as well. 
For instance, you and your intended may want to have special get-
togethers for your respective attendants, parents, and siblings. You 
also may want to invite family and guests to a day-after gathering — 
a great way to spend a little more time with people you may not see 
very often. And you may want to travel back to your hometown a 
few months after the wedding to see the people who didn’t attend.
None of these functions is free, naturally. But in this chapter, I share 
tips for stretching your wedding budget to include these expenses.
Keeping Costs Down for 
the Rehearsal Dinner
Traditionally, the groom’s family pays for the rehearsal dinner — 
a get-together the evening before the wedding for the bride’s 
and groom’s immediate families, attendants and their spouses or 

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
206
significant others, and others integrally involved in the ceremony 
(such as the officiant, soloist, or readers, if they’re friends or rela-
tives). These days, though, the bride and groom are just as likely 
to pay for the rehearsal dinner, and keeping these expenses under 
control is a vital part of sticking to your wedding budget.
Like your wedding and reception, your rehearsal dinner can be 
as lavish and expensive (or as modest and inexpensive) as you 
want. Costs range from $10 per person or less to as high as $250 
per person, or even more. Your cost depends on three things: the 
number of guests, the location, and the menu.
Considering the guest list
Depending on the size of your families and wedding party, you can 
easily have 30 or more people at your rehearsal dinner. At $10 a 
head, you’re looking at a $300 bill, and when money is tight, that 
$300 may as well be $3,000.
 
Just as it’s tempting to invite everyone you’ve ever considered a 
friend to your wedding, you may be inclined to include everyone 
who’s in town to your rehearsal dinner. But if Cousin Millie and 
Uncle Frank aren’t part of the actual ceremony, consider leaving 
them off the guest list for this event. Limit the invitees to immedi-
ate family — parents, siblings, and perhaps grandparents — and 
those who have a role to play in the ceremony (including the offici-
ant, if appropriate). See “Feting Out-of-Town Guests,” later in this 
chapter, for ideas on getting together with guests who won’t attend 
the rehearsal dinner.
Keep attendance from ballooning by issuing invitations to those 
who should be at your rehearsal dinner. If it isn’t a formal affair, 
your invitations don’t have to be formal; a verbal or e-mail invita-
tion is enough. If you want to send professionally printed invita-
tions, check whether your printer offers a discount; some do when 
you order rehearsal dinner invitations along with your wedding 
invitations.
Choosing a location
The least expensive option is to host your rehearsal dinner at 
home — either your home or, if you don’t have room for a hefty 
crowd, the home of a friend or relative. In warm weather, you can 
set up a party tent in the backyard and decorate it with Japanese 
lanterns or party lights and balloons.

 Chapter 14: Making the Most of Prewedding and Postwedding Events 207
 
If you don’t have enough outdoor space, look into renting a pavil-
ion at a local park. Rental fees usually are quite reasonable — often 
$50 or less — and you may even get your deposit back if you clean 
up the site after the dinner.
Another option is to rent a clubhouse. Apartment complexes and 
mobile home parks often have meeting or party rooms that tenants 
can reserve for a small — often refundable — deposit; if you don’t 
have access to one yourself, see if any local friends or relatives can 
reserve such a facility. Or you may be able to use facilities at your 
church or local firehouse.
Restaurants are, naturally, the most expensive sites for rehearsal 
dinners. Even if you choose a relatively inexpensive buffet, the cost 
per person can easily top $20. See the next section, “Planning the 
menu,” for tips on keeping costs down if you decide to hold your 
rehearsal dinner at a restaurant.
 
Don’t obsess about (or spend money on) floral decorations or flashy 
centerpieces for the rehearsal dinner. If you want to dress up a club-
house or meeting room, use inexpensive balloons and streamers. 
The rehearsal dinner is a much less formal affair than your wedding, 
so it doesn’t require the same level of decorative detail.
Planning the menu
Food and drink are the major expenses for a rehearsal dinner. If 
you’re having the event in a home or rented space rather than in 
a restaurant, you can keep those costs low by planning a simple 
menu. Some inexpensive options include the following:
 
✓ A cookout with burgers, hot dogs, chips, salads, soda, and beer
 
✓ An Italian buffet with lasagna, breadsticks, salad, soda, and 
Chianti
 
✓ A pizza party
 
✓ An informal cocktail party with hors d’oeuvres, soda, beer, 
and wine
 
✓ A potluck dinner (ask only in-town guests to bring a dish; 
out-of-town guests can bring wine or soda if they want)
 
Does a local friend or relative make a fabulous signature dish? Ask 
him to cater your rehearsal dinner in lieu of buying a traditional 
wedding gift. For our backyard rehearsal dinner, my fiancé’s sister 
and brother-in-law provided their famous barbequed chicken, and 
his mother made her signature macaroni and potato salads. We 
supplied beverages, fresh veggies and dip, and all the tableware, 
for less than $100.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
208
Don’t feel bad if you decide not to hire a professional caterer for 
your rehearsal dinner. Out-of-town guests especially may appreci-
ate a home-cooked meal; they’ll be eating plenty of restaurant food 
during their stay.
If you choose to have your rehearsal dinner at a restaurant (or 
to bring a caterer to your home or rented dining space), you can 
keep costs down by simplifying the menu. Choose a buffet instead 
of a sit-down dinner, limit (or eliminate) alcohol service, and skip 
extras like hors d’oeuvres. Opt for self-serve platters of cookies or 
brownies for dessert.
 
When you investigate restaurant locations for your rehearsal 
dinner, find out whether the site charges any fees in addition to 
the food. Most restaurants add a gratuity of around 20 percent for 
large groups. Some charge a rental fee for private dining rooms, 
and some require a minimum food bill that you pay regardless of 
how many people actually attend your dinner.
Hosting Gatherings for 
Your Wedding Party
Some religious traditions stipulate that men and women have sepa-
rate wedding-party get-togethers. However, even many nonreligous 
couples find that segregated activities help them recharge and 
refocus in the hours leading up to the wedding.
In this section, I offer some ideas for getting the women and men in 
your wedding party together — separately.
Bachelor and bachelorette parties
Traditionally, the honor attendants (best man and maid or matron of honor) organize 
bachelor/bachelorette parties and either pay for the party themselves or arrange 
for the rest of the bridal party to chip in. When funds are tight, though, it isn’t uncom-
mon for everyone — including the bride and groom — to pay their own way. If 
you’re in this situation, remember to budget for your last outing with your pals.
Remember, too, that you don’t have to have a stereotypical final fling. Maybe you 
and your buddies would rather play a round of golf or spend an evening watch-
ing your favorite movies together, which may be more meaningful and easier on 
everyone’s wallet.

Bridal brunch
Bridal party brunches — hosted by the bride on her wedding day — 
are popular in some circles. A brunch is a nice way for the bride to 
relax with her attendants and female family members in the midst 
of the hectic wedding day schedule. It’s also an opportunity for the 
bride to thank her attendants and relatives for their wedding help 
and to present them with gifts before the ceremony.
 
Such brunches can be expensive. Some wedding experts insist that 
the bridal brunch be an elegant affair, with elegant decorations and 
elegant food in an elegant setting. A champagne brunch at the best 
restaurant in town can easily run $30 or more per person. Add in 
decorations and perhaps transportation and your brunch bill can 
begin to rival costs for the rehearsal dinner.
Of course, you don’t have to get all fancy to have a good time 
with your bridesmaids. Consider these alternatives to an upscale 
brunch:
 
✓ A spa party: See Chapter 5 for more on this idea.
 
✓ A casual lunch the day before the wedding: You also can 
dine the day of, if you’re having an evening ceremony.
 
✓ A sleepover party the night before your wedding: This 
sleepover can double as your bachelorette party.
 
If you prefer the idea of a bridal brunch, go for a more casual feel 
to minimize costs. Host it at your home or a friend’s or relative’s 
house. Set out a selection of pastries and fresh fruit and serve 
coffee, tea, and juice. If you want to include alcohol, make pitch-
ers of mimosas (orange juice and champagne) or bloody marys. 
You can use a less expensive champagne brand for the mimosas 
because it’ll be mixed with the orange juice.
Groom get-together
What about the guys? Although their traditional get-together is the 
bachelor party, some grooms like to plan a special wedding-week-
end outing with their buddies, father, and father-in-law-to-be — a 
round of golf, perhaps, a game of hoops at the park, or some other 
activity that helps everyone relax and puts the stresses of wedding 
planning aside for a few hours.
If you want to arrange this kind of activity for the male members of 
your wedding party and your respective families, etiquette dictates 
that you pay for it (just as etiquette dictates that the bride pay for the 
brunch for her half of the wedding party). As with the bride’s brunch, 

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
210
though, you can choose to host a less expensive guys’ outing — say, 
lunch at your favorite sports bar. If funds are especially tight, you may 
opt to worry less about etiquette; tell the guys how much the planned 
activity costs and give them the option of declining.
 
Any of the activities in this section can double as a bachelor party — 
which may be an attractive option if money and time are scarce.
Feting Out-of-Town Guests
When people travel to your wedding, it’s natural to feel an obliga-
tion to entertain them. This is one reason that so many couples 
end up spending a small fortune on the rehearsal dinner: They 
expand the guest list to include all their out-of-town guests rather 
than just the wedding party and immediate family.
You have other options to include these important people — as 
well as local guests — and these options can be much less expen-
sive than a full-fledged party. Consider the following:
 
✓ Arrange activities for the day before or the day of the wed-
ding. If time allows, plan a softball game, a board game party, 
or some other inclusive activity. Make attendance optional; 
your guests may have other ideas for their free time. And keep 
the formality dial at 0; remember that your wedding is still the 
main event.
 
✓ Invite them for coffee and dessert after the rehearsal 
dinner. This gives you a chance to socialize without all the 
commotion of your reception and keeps food and beverage 
costs on a short leash. It also provides a nice balance between 
time with your immediate family and the wedding party and 
time with friends and family who you may not see often.
 
✓ Host a day-after brunch or picnic. Depending on travel 
arrangements (yours and your guests’), a next-day brunch 
or picnic may be the perfect way to wind down your wed-
ding weekend. This should be a casual affair — comfortable 
clothes, not-too-fancy food, and a relaxed atmosphere. (See 
the nearby sidebar, “Sample day-after menus,” for inexpensive 
food ideas.) Limit spending for this function to no more than 
$100; after all, it’s an extra, not the main event.
 
 Make the day-after event a gift-opening get-together for all who 
want to attend. Lots of guests enjoy seeing the happy couple 
open their gifts, and the activity provides natural conversation 
starters. Ask your honor attendant or a family member to keep 
a list of the gifts you receive and who they came from; this is 
essential when it’s time to write thank-you notes.

 Chapter 14: Making the Most of Prewedding and Postwedding Events 211
 
Tell your guests as soon as possible about any extracurricular 
activities on your wedding weekend so they can make their travel 
arrangements accordingly. You don’t want to spend the next few 
years hearing great-aunt Sally lament that she would have loved to 
attend your gift-opening get-together if only she had known about 
it in advance.
Sample day-after menus
If you host a postwedding brunch or picnic, you should be prepared to feed your 
guests. Fortunately, this kind of gathering isn’t nearly as expensive as a wedding 
reception. You don’t have to serve alcohol at your day-after event. Your guests 
likely will be tired from the previous day, and perhaps planning to travel, so they 
may not be inclined to imbibe anyway.
Here are some ideas for affordable brunch menus:
 ✓ Bagels, English muffins, and specialty breads like cinnamon raisin or banana 
nut
 ✓ Spreads such as cream cheese, preserves, and ham, tuna, shrimp, or chicken 
salad
 ✓ Fresh fruit
 ✓ Mini quiches (available at warehouse stores like Costco and Sam’s Club)
 ✓ Coffee, tea, and fruit juices
 ✓ Sweets like cookies are always a safe choice, and biscotti goes well with 
coffee at brunch
If you’re planning a picnic, consider the following food and drink ideas:
 ✓ Hamburgers, hot dogs, and chicken drumsticks
 ✓ Fruit salad
 ✓ Raw veggies
 ✓ Chips
 ✓ Dip
 ✓ Soda, iced tea, and water
 ✓ Cookies or a bowl of individually wrapped miniature candy bars for dessert

Partying with Those Who 
Can’t Make the Wedding
Unless you’re very fortunate, not everyone you invite will attend 
your wedding. This is especially true if guests have to travel a 
long distance, or if your wedding is on a high-traffic weekend like 
Memorial Day or another holiday. Hosting a postwedding get-
together is a great way to celebrate with those guests who were 
unable to attend your wedding.
 
If your budget limits your dream wedding to only a few dozen 
guests, a postwedding celebration can be the perfect way to 
include all those you had to leave off your guest list. Host a party 
after you return from your honeymoon (or a few weeks after your 
wedding, if you delay or skip the honeymoon) and invite those who 
didn’t make the cut for the actual wedding. Call it a housewarming 
party or a newlywed party — whatever you like. Just remember to 
follow two etiquette rules: Don’t expect your guests to bring gifts 
(you didn’t invite them to the wedding, after all), and don’t deco-
rate in a wedding theme.
Even if you don’t get married in your hometown, you still can 
plan to celebrate with your hometown friends. Ask one of those 
friends to host a cocktail reception a few months after your wed-
ding, or plan a get-together at a local restaurant. This takes a little 
extra effort and planning, of course, but you’ll avoid the wedding 
markup. Plus, you don’t have to include this in your wedding 
budget, because you’ll have those additional months to save for it 
(and for your own travel expenses, of course).
 
If you send out invitations to a postwedding get-together, make 
it clear that you don’t expect your guests to give you gifts. A 
simple “No gifts, please” in the corner of the invitation will suffice. 
Chances are, if you invited them to your wedding, they already 
sent a gift. And those you didn’t invite to the wedding may view 
your postnuptial invitation as a crass grab for more wedding loot.

T
he honeymoon industry, although puny by general wedding 
industry standards, takes in about $8 billion a year. According 
to The Wedding Report (www.theweddingreport.com), an indus-
try analysis Web site, 99 percent of marrying couples take a honey-
moon, and they spend an average of $3,800 — three times more than 
the average for any other vacation. Honeymoon expenses account 
for about 14 percent of the average $20,000 wedding budget.
Of course, you don’t have to spend that much to have a super hon-
eymoon. In fact, even if you choose an overseas location, you can 
still keep your honeymoon costs in check. The first step is estab-
lishing a budget for your getaway. After you know how much you 
want to spend, you can begin researching locations that fit your 
budget. Then you’re ready for the fun part: tweaking your plans to 
get the most value for your dollar.
Thinking About the Kind of 
Honeymoon You Want
Just as you envision the kind of wedding you want, draw up a 
mental picture of how you want to spend your postnuptial get-
away. Do you want to be pampered on a cruise or at a full-service 
tropical resort? Or would you and your new spouse prefer to hop 
in the car and go on your ultimate road trip? Maybe you’re more 
interested in mountain biking than in Mayan ruins, or maybe a 

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
214
week in Venice or Prague appeals to you more than sunbathing on 
a Caribbean beach.
The point is that there’s no such thing as a “proper” honeymoon. 
The best honeymoon is the one that you and your sweetie will 
enjoy without overdrawing your bank accounts or overextend-
ing your credit limits. In the following sections, I explore some 
common honeymoon options, including the popular cruise or 
resort vacation and some lesser-known alternatives.
Saving money on cruises and resorts
All-inclusive packages are becoming more and more popular with 
honeymooners, because, in theory, you know upfront exactly how 
much lodging, food, beverages, and entertainment are going to 
cost. Having that all-inclusive figure at your fingertips can make 
budgeting easier.
 
But the term “all-inclusive” is, at best, elastic. At some resorts, the 
all-inclusive rate does indeed cover your room, all meals, your bar 
tab, snacks at the poolside bar, and the bands and other entertain-
ers who perform around the resort. Many resorts even offer free use 
of nonmotorized land and water vehicles like bicycles and kayaks. 
Even at these resorts, though, you’ll pay extra to rent a personal 
watercraft or motorized scooter, and some resorts charge extra if 
you want to have dinner at their specialty restaurants. Most resorts 
also charge you if you fail to return the “free” beach towel it pro-
vides. (And, of course, all-inclusive doesn’t include purchases at 
the resort’s convenience store or gift shop.)
At other resorts, the all-inclusive label doesn’t cover your entire 
bar tab. It may only cover domestic beers, wines, and liquors. And 
remember that when you’re in a foreign country, your native beer 
is imported beer.
Cruises don’t typically use the all-inclusive label, but that doesn’t 
stop many travelers from experiencing sticker shock when they 
board their ship. Most cruise lines charge for alcoholic beverages; 
only soft drinks, coffee, tea, juice, and milk are included in your 
cabin rate. On many ships, the charge for a drink includes an auto-
matic tip for the bartender or server, too. You’ll also be charged a 
daily room-cleaning fee, typically $10 per person — or $140 for a 
seven-day cruise for the two of you.
 
Whether you’re at a land-based resort or on a cruise ship, you’ll 
pay extra for excursions — tours or activities in the area you’re vis-
iting. Even if you decide to explore on your own, be sure to factor 
certain excursion expenses — such as cab or bus fare, car rental, 
off-site meals, and souvenirs — into your travel budget.

 Chapter 15: Honeymooning in Style — and in the Black 215
 
Even though cruise lines and many resorts can book excursions 
for you, you may save money by making reservations on your own. 
Check the excursions available on your cruise or at your resort, 
and then search the Internet to find the Web sites of the compa-
nies that provide the excursions. Check the companies’ listed 
prices against the prices that the cruise line or resort offers; then 
you can go with the least expensive alternative.
Also look into packages that combine bus tours, for example, and 
museum passes. You may not always save money with these deals, 
but you can save a lot of time, especially at popular sites; tour 
bus companies often arrange with sites to get their passengers in 
ahead of “walk-ups.”
Considering hotels, condos, and 
other alternatives
Weeklong cruises and resort stays may be stereotypical honey-
moon vacations, but they are by no means the only way to travel. 
Here are some less costly options to think about:
 
✓ Book a regular hotel instead of a room at a resort. Some 
hotels offer complimentary breakfast, so you only have to 
budget for two meals a day instead of three; depending on 
where you go and what kinds of eateries you prefer, you can 
lunch and even dine inexpensively. However, you also have to 
budget for other expenses — such as bike rentals, use of the 
beach, and, naturally, drinks (even soda) — that are typically 
included in the room rate at all-inclusive resorts.
 
✓ Rent an apartment or condo instead of staying at a hotel. A 
week’s rent at a beachfront condo may cost less than a stan-
dard room in a resort. Cost aside, with a condo you also get a 
sense of privacy and space that hotels lack. And because you’ll 
likely have a kitchen, you can save money on meals, too, by 
cooking breakfast, lunch, and even romantic dinners yourself.
 
 Check out www.vacationrentals.com for apartments, 
condos, and even houses in popular vacation spots.
 
✓ Stay at a campground. Some campgrounds have cabins, so 
you don’t even need your own tent or RV. Cabins also are 
more fun for those couples who don’t like to rough it in a tent 
with the bugs and other critters.
 
✓ Look for a getaway close to home. Destinations within a six- 
to eight-hour drive can be a lot cheaper than a cross-country 
or international location simply because transportation is less 
expensive. Pull out the atlas and see what’s in your region 
that you and your sweetie would like to see.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
216
 
✓ Check out bed-and-breakfast inns. B-and-Bs tend to be more 
personal — and often more lavishly furnished — than hotels, 
and prices often are comparable to other local hotels. Many 
B-and-Bs are in historic buildings, which adds to their charm.
Budgeting for Your Postwedding 
Getaway
Unfortunately, honeymoons, like weddings, don’t pay for them-
selves. And, like weddings, you can easily be blindsided by unan-
ticipated expenses. In this section, I point out some common, but 
often overlooked, expenses that you need to budget for as well as 
tips on saving for your honeymoon — including the relatively new 
phenomenon of honeymoon registries.
Covering all your travel expenses
The typical honeymoon costs go beyond just the destination (and 
the transportation to get there). If you’re like most soon-to-be-
married couples, you probably intend to purchase new clothes, 
luggage, and incidentals like bathing suits, sunglasses, and sun-
screen for your honeymoon. You may even buy a new camera or 
video camera.
How much do these purchases add to your honeymoon costs? If 
you and your spouse-to-be are true to the averages, you’ll likely 
spend more than $1,600 before you even buy your airline tickets 
and hotel room or purchase that weeklong cruise.
 
One way to avoid some of these expenses is to add items such as 
luggage and cameras to your wedding registry — just be sure you 
make time to open your gifts before you leave on your trip. You 
also can register for gift cards at your favorite clothing stores. 
(However, if you leave for your honeymoon immediately after your 
wedding, you probably won’t have time to use those gift cards to 
buy honeymoon attire.)
 
When you’re figuring out how much you can or want to spend on 
your postnuptial trip, make sure you factor in all the expenses 
you’re likely to have, including activities, airfare, entertainment, 
transportation, lodging, meals, passports, visas, vaccinations, and 
incidentals (souvenirs, toiletries, snacks, tips, clothes, and so on).

 Chapter 15: Honeymooning in Style — and in the Black 217
 
Use the “Budget Cruncher” worksheet at Honeymooner’s Review 
Guide (www.honeymoonersreviewguide.com/planning/
Budget_Cruncherpdf.pdf) to make sure you’ve covered all 
your expenses. You can print the blank form as often as you like to 
compare costs for different honeymoon destinations.
Saving for the trip
The best way to make sure you have enough money for your 
dream honeymoon is to open a honeymoon savings account as 
soon as you get engaged. The average engagement lasts 16 months, 
so if each of you contributes $100 a month to the honeymoon 
account, you’ll have $3,200 saved (plus any interest) by the time 
you’re ready to leave. If you’re both confident that you can stick 
to your savings plan, you can start looking for destinations that fit 
your budget.
If you don’t have enough room in your monthly budget to set 
aside a specific amount for your honeymoon, consider “giving up” 
certain nonessentials (brown-bag your lunch, for example, or skip 
that afternoon latte) for the months leading up to your honey-
moon; reassessing your wedding priorities and budget to come up 
with honeymoon funds; or scaling back your honeymoon plans to 
something more affordable — perhaps a weekend at a nearby bed-
and-breakfast instead of a week in Cancun. And, if you like, you can 
begin planning (and saving for) a more spectacular trip for your 
first anniversary.
 
Some couples pay for their honeymoon with credit cards. I’m not 
a big fan of this option, because you can easily end up paying 
thousands more in interest if you don’t pay the cards off promptly. 
However, if you’re expecting a bonus from your job or some other 
one-time payment, or if your household budget allows you to pay 
off your honeymoon charges within 3, 6, or 12 months, using a 
credit card may work for you. If possible, use a card that offers 
cash back on all purchases (the most useful kind of reward card) 
or one that has a low interest rate.
Even if you decide to save so you can pay for your honeymoon 
in cash, you’ll probably end up putting at least some expenses — 
especially booking fees or reservation deposits — on a credit card. 
The trick is to make sure you include any credit card charges in 
your overall budget. In other words, charging your $1,000 resort 
bill to your credit card means you have to reserve $1,000 of your 
honeymoon money to pay off that charge — not that you have an 
extra $1,000 spending cash for the trip.

Registering for your honeymoon
A relatively new trend in the wedding industry is honeymoon 
registries. Instead of giving you traditional gifts from a traditional 
registry, guests can use a honeymoon registry to pay for part of 
your postnuptial trip. They may pay one night’s stay in the hotel, 
for example, or provide money toward airfare. Most sites convert 
these gifts into points or credits that you can use toward your trip.
Some of these registries are available through hotel and resort 
chains. Several hotels cover their registry programs on their own 
Web sites. Others set up their honeymoon registries through 
Weddingchannel.com (weddings.weddingchannel.com/
default.aspx?MsdVisit=1).
 
Here are a couple of catches to honeymoon registries that you 
need to be aware of:
 
✓ Fees: All honeymoon registry sites charge some sort of fee, 
either to the registering couple or to those who purchase gifts 
through the site. Some charge registering couples a percent-
age of the value of gifts others buy for them through the site. 
Others charge a flat rate to set up the registry (say, $150 or 
so), and then charge gift-givers an additional percentage fee.
 
✓ Deposits: Unless you’re planning to hold off on your honey-
moon until well after your wedding is over (see “Delaying 
your honeymoon” later in this chapter), you’ll have to pay for 
deposits and any other charges yourselves and then wait to 
see whether your guests choose to ante up for honeymoon 
costs.
 
 Most couples get a lot less than they expect in both cash gifts 
and these relatively new honeymoon gifts. So be prepared to 
pay for the honeymoon yourselves; then, if you do receive 
gifts to offset those costs, you’ll be ahead of the game.
 
✓ Expiration dates: On some sites, registry credits or points 
expire. For example, at this writing, one hotel’s credits are 
only good for two years from the date of purchase.
 
To avoid any of these surprises, make sure you know how a reg-
istry works, including all costs, expiration dates, and limitations, 
before you sign up. Be sure to explain to your wedding guests how 
the registry works, too, including any extra fees they may incur. 
Even though it’s tacky to include registry information in your wed-
ding invitations, you can post links to your gift registries on your 
wedding Web site, along with a brief description of the registry 
and, if necessary, instructions on how to use it.

Researching Honeymoon Spots 
with Cost in Mind
Being on a budget doesn’t mean you can’t have a wonderful honey-
moon. There are lots of romantic getaways that won’t flatten your 
wallet. And the Internet has made deals easy to find — although 
you may want to consult a travel agent, too.
Turning your Internet know-how 
into travel savings
You can visit countless travel sites online, including popular 
ones like Expedia (www.expedia.com) and Travelocity (www.
travelocity.com). Most travel sites have links to the airlines, 
hotels, resorts, and cruise lines they list. Be sure to use these links 
to complete your research. Why? An airline site may offer a better 
price than the travel site, or it may give you an idea of how much 
you’d save by going through a particular travel site.
 
Be sure to check out reviews of any vacation spot you’re 
considering — either on the company’s own site or on sites 
like Trip Advisor (www.tripadvisor.com) or Virtual Tourist 
(www.virtualtourist.com). Pay attention to the negative 
comments and weigh them against the positive ones. If a place 
gets only so-so reviews overall, you may be happier if you continue 
your search. No matter how inexpensive a vacation spot is, you 
aren’t getting a good deal if your experience is miserable.
Enlisting a travel agent
The reports of the death of travel agents, to borrow from Mark 
Twain, have been greatly exaggerated. Certainly the Internet has 
made agents’ jobs more challenging, but sometimes you just can’t 
find a substitute for a live, breathing, and talking person who’s 
experienced in all the aspects of travel.
Besides knowing what kind of documentation and vaccines you 
need when you’re going overseas, a good travel agent may know of 
special deals that aren’t available online. Plus, he may have been 
to the place you’re planning to visit and can give you valuable info 
about what to really expect. And when you know what to expect, 
you can plan and budget better — and thus save some bucks.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
220
 
Start your search for the perfect honeymoon spot online with the 
preceding section, and then make an appointment with a travel 
agent to see whether you can get a better deal — or get the inside 
scoop on places you’re considering. If you know what you’ll be 
charged online, you can better judge the prices an agent will quote. 
You don’t have to pay for the appointment or the services that an 
agent provides; travel agents are paid by the airlines, hotels, and 
other travel-related companies they book (not by the people who 
make reservations through them).
Tweaking Your Plans for Value
You can stretch your honeymoon dollars without giving up the 
things you really want. Honest! The first, and most obvious, tactic 
is scheduling your honeymoon when fewer people will be at your 
destination. But you also can save money by traveling on slower 
days of the week, by booking early, or by waiting for last-minute 
deals. I explain all this and more in the following sections.
 
Don’t be shy about telling agents or staff at your destination that 
you’re on your honeymoon. You may bag some extras reserved 
just for newlyweds — things like complimentary champagne, 
breakfast in bed, or a fruit basket or flowers in your room.
Hitting hot spots in the off-season
Nearly every vacation spot has an off-season — usually a time when 
the weather isn’t ideal and when many attractions in the area close 
down because there aren’t enough visitors to justify staying open. 
You can save a ton of money by visiting during the off-season, but 
I don’t recommend it unless both of you have intense hermitlike 
characteristics.
However, vacation destinations also have shoulder seasons, which 
are the few weeks leading up to the season and the few weeks after 
the season “officially” ends before the hot spot becomes a virtual 
ghost town. Prices typically are lower during shoulder seasons, 
and popular spots usually are less crowded, so you may find your 
honeymoon more enjoyable.
 
“High season” doesn’t always refer just to the destination’s best 
weather. Convention business can drive prices up just as much as 
terrific weather can, so be sure to contact your destination’s tour-
ism or convention bureau to find out whether you’ll be competing 
with thousands of conventioneers for lodging and amenities.

 Chapter 15: Honeymooning in Style — and in the Black 221
Here are the shoulder seasons for some of the most popular hon-
eymoon locations:
 
✓ Alaska: May and September are the best months to find deals 
on Alaskan cruises.
 
✓ Australia and New Zealand: In May and June, Australia’s 
northern section has great weather, and airfares from the 
U.S. are usually at their lowest during these months. New 
Zealand is lovely in April (before winter begins there) and in 
November and December (early spring in that country).
 
✓ The contiguous United States: Get great deals at ski resorts in 
the Rockies in April. Nantucket still has summer-like weather, 
but virtually none of the crowds, in September and October. 
Golf courses in Arizona aren’t nearly as full in November and 
December, but the weather is still warm and sunny.
 
✓ Europe: April, May, and September are good times to visit 
major European cities like London, Paris, and Rome. These 
months are on the shoulders of the high summer season, 
so popular attractions will be less crowded. You’ll also be 
more likely to find good deals on airfare and lodging during 
these months. If you’re interested in a European ski vacation, 
December is the time to go.
 
✓ Hawaii: You’re likely to find the best Hawaiian deals in 
September as the summer crowds leave the islands.
 
✓ Latin America and the Caribbean: April and November are 
the shoulder months for the Caribbean islands — just before 
and just after the official hurricane season (of course, weather 
systems don’t read calendars, so you can’t completely 
rule out a hurricane). You can find deals for Mexico’s Baja 
Peninsula (below California) in June and October. May and 
December are good times to visit Belize and Costa Rica.
 
✓ The Mediterranean: You’re likely to find the best deals at 
Mediterranean resorts in April and October, before and after 
the summer crowds. The Greek Islands’ shoulder months are 
September and October.
 
✓ The Pacific Rim: India is more temperate in March than later 
in the spring or summer. The beaches in Malaysia are less 
crowded in March and April; December is a good time to visit 
here, too. Visit Bali in September and October, before the 
rainy season begins. The South Pacific islands are best in May 
and November.
You won’t find any significant shoulder seasons in January, 
February, July, or August. However, many destinations drop their 
prices right after New Year’s Day and offer lower rates until their 

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
222
shoulder seasons begin in earnest. The exception often is mid-
February, when demand for romantic getaway spots is spurred by 
Valentine’s Day.
Choosing cheaper days of the week
Sometimes you can save money — or get more value for the same 
money — by adjusting your travel plans. For example, it’s usually 
less expensive to fly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and you may 
get another price break for staying over until at least the following 
Sunday.
Lots of hotels, particularly in hot honeymoon or vacation spots 
like Las Vegas, offer significantly lower room rates Sunday through 
Thursday. So you could save money by trimming your stay to four 
days. Or you could use the savings from midweek flights to finance 
the higher room rates on Friday and Saturday and still spend a full 
week at your honeymoon destination.
 
On weekdays, early-morning and late-afternoon flights often are 
more expensive than mid-day or evening flights, because these are 
prime slots for business travelers. You may save $100 or more per 
ticket by leaving at 10 a.m. or 10 p.m. instead of 6 a.m. or 4 p.m.
Looking into other transportation 
options
Unless you live near your honeymoon destination — say, within a 
few hundred miles — the only practical way to get there may be to 
fly. If that’s the case, your job is relatively simple: You just need to 
use your computer skills or your travel agent to compare the costs 
of different flight options.
However, if flying isn’t the only way to get where you’re going, 
you should check out options — train service, bus travel, or even 
driving — to see whether you can save money.
 
Driving or taking the train may be cheaper than flying, but often 
the trade-off is time. If you have to spend eight hours driving or 
riding on a train, you may decide that the extra expense of flying 
is worth the time you’ll save. Also, remember that these modes of 
transport have their own hidden costs: meals, tolls, and (if you’re 
taking a train) cab fare to your lodgings.

 Chapter 15: Honeymooning in Style — and in the Black 223
The early bride gets the deal: 
Booking early
If you want to honeymoon in a popular vacation spot at the height 
of the season, booking early — 9 to 12 months in advance — is the 
way to go. Prices for both flights and lodging typically go up as 
supply dwindles. Plus, the earlier you book, the more likely you are 
to get exactly what you want.
 
You face potential downsides to booking early, though. You may 
forfeit part or all of your deposit if you cancel your flight or reser-
vation; this is especially true of cruises. You also may miss out on 
special deals or promotions if you book too early. However, many 
companies will arrange for you to take advantage of these deals, so 
be sure to call and ask.
Flights are typically cheapest when they’re booked at least three 
weeks in advance. However, if you’re heading to a popular destination 
at a popular time — Cancun during spring break, for example — book 
your flight as early as possible to make sure you get what you want.
 
Some online booking sites like Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) offer 
price guarantees on their airfares. If the price on a flight you book 
through Orbitz drops by more than $5 before your trip, Orbitz 
automatically refunds the difference, up to $250. You’ll get a check 
about a month after your trip. See the earlier section “Turning your 
Internet know-how into travel savings” for more online tips.
If you don’t live near a major airline hub and can’t get a direct 
flight to your destination, try booking each leg of your flight sepa-
rately; you may save money over the automatic routing of your 
itinerary. Just remember to take into account connection times 
and travel-through-the-terminal time if you book with different 
airlines. Missing your honeymoon flight would definitely ruin the 
moment.
When being late pays off: Booking 
your trip at the last minute
Sometimes you can get great deals by waiting until the last minute 
to book your trip. Of course, “last minute” is a fluid term. For air-
lines, you typically get the best deals if you book at least three 
weeks in advance. For cruises, resorts, and hotels, you may be 
able to score great deals as little as a week in advance. Generally, 
though, “last minute” is anywhere between 30 and 90 days before 
your planned departure date.

Part III: Celebrating with Your Guests  
224
The leading online travel sites all have sections devoted to special 
deals for last-minute travelers, and some companies actually target 
those travelers. Vacations To Go (www.vacationstogo.com), 
for example, sends out regular (and free!) e-mail newsletters with 
last-minute deals on cruises, safaris, and resort vacations. Cruise 
lines are especially prone to offering deep discounts in the 90 days 
before a ship sails; they want their cabins filled even if they have to 
slash their regular prices to do it.
 
Even though waiting until the last minute to book your trip can 
save you a lot of money, you do risk not being able to go to your 
top-choice hotel or destination. If your heart is set on a week in the 
Bahamas, you’re better off booking as early as possible to make 
sure you get the dates and accommodations you want.
Delaying your honeymoon
For numerous reasons, many couples decide to delay their honey-
moons. Maybe it isn’t convenient for one or both of you to take the 
time off from work right after your wedding. Maybe you’d rather 
wait so you can save up for the really lavish honeymoon you want. 
Or maybe you want to get married in January but would rather 
wait until April for your Caribbean honeymoon so you can take 
advantage of lower prices and less crowded beaches.
Whatever the reason, there’s nothing wrong with putting your 
honeymoon on hold for a while. In fact, if trying to cram your hon-
eymoon in right after your wedding would strain your finances, the 
smart thing to do is to delay it until you can afford it.

Ten Ways to Get the Most for 
Your Wedding Dollar
In This Chapter
▶ Spending time to save money
▶ Using the talents of friends and relatives
▶ Discovering tips that save you a bundle
I
n your quest for the perfect budget wedding, you may have 
realized that the word “wedding” pumps up the price of just 
about everything. But when you’re trying to stick to a budget, you 
want to make every dollar you spend go as far as it can. So in this 
chapter, I give you my top ten suggestions for stretching your 
money so you can have a fabulous wedding that you won’t regret 
paying for.
Shop Around and Get Several 
Different Quotes
Legwork costs you some time, but it can save you a bundle of cash. 
When you’re looking for wedding vendors — caterers, photogra-
phers, florists, bakers, and so on — get price quotes from at least 
three of each. Then compare the values — what you’re getting 
in return for your money. A florist may seem inexpensive at first 
glance, for example, until you add delivery and setup fees into 
the quote. Similarly, another florist’s higher price may actually be 
quite reasonable if it includes those fees.
 
Getting several quotes helps you judge whether a vendor’s prices 
are close to the average for your area or way out of line. You also 
avoid making impulse decisions that you may regret later.

Part IV: The Part of Tens  
228
Get Referrals from Trusted Sources
A bargain is no bargain at all if you don’t get what you expect. So 
ask family and friends to recommend trustworthy vendors. And 
ask the vendors whether you can speak to a couple of their clients 
or at least see some thank-you letters from satisfied customers. 
You want to get a sense of whether others have had good experi-
ences with this vendor. If they haven’t, or if the same issues come 
up with several clients, you may want to look elsewhere.
When talking with a vendor’s former clients, get answers to these 
questions:
 
✓ Did the vendor provide the appropriate level of service?
 
✓ Were items delivered correctly and on time?
 
✓ Did you have any problems with this vendor? If so, how were 
they resolved?
 
✓ Did you discover any unexpected charges on your bill?
 
✓ Did you feel the price you paid was fair for what you received?
Hit the Suburbs
Vendors in suburbs and small towns often charge significantly less 
than their big-city counterparts, so it’s worth checking them out. If 
you’re searching for vendors online, many sites let you set a range 
for your search — within 10, 20, or 50 miles, for example. Many 
metropolitan telephone books include suburbs and outlying areas. 
So you shouldn’t have trouble finding some vendors in these less 
expensive areas.
Some vendors may charge mileage or an extra delivery fee for 
going out of their primary service area. Depending on how much 
extra they charge, you still may save 5 percent to 15 percent on 
your total bill for that vendor. You then can put those savings 
toward another wedding day priority or keep them in the bank for 
a rainy day.
Search the Internet for 
Deals and Advice
The Internet is an astounding tool for finding products at rock-bot-
tom prices. It’s an especially good option for bulk purchases, such 

 Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Get the Most for Your Wedding Dollar 229
as fresh or artificial flowers (see Chapter 8 for do-it-yourself floral 
ideas); materials for making centerpieces, decorations, and favors; 
and candy and nuts.
 
If you aren’t careful, shipping charges can erase a good portion of 
the savings you can gain by ordering online. Delivery times also 
can be problematic, especially if you’re on tight deadlines. Be 
familiar with the prices in your local bricks-and-mortar stores so 
you can judge whether ordering from a Web site makes sense.
Of course, you also can get tons of free information, including 
step-by-step instructions and even demonstration videos for do-it-
yourself wedding projects, on the Internet.
Ask Vendors for Extras
You won’t be able to negotiate a 50 percent discount on the cake 
or photos, but you may be able to convince the vendor to waive 
the delivery fee or give you an extra 30 minutes of service at little 
or no charge.
You’re more likely to get extras thrown in if you aren’t getting 
married at the height of wedding season. A vendor who can book 
her goods or services at full price during June or October prob-
ably won’t be in a mood to negotiate much. But if you’re getting 
married on a Saturday morning in August or a Friday evening in 
January, you have the advantage of offering the vendor business at 
a slow time, making negotiation much more attractive to her. (See 
Chapter 3 for information on how to save money by tweaking the 
timing of your wedding.)
 
Wedding vendors are trying to make a living like everyone else, so 
don’t expect them to give away their service or product for noth-
ing. Make sure the extras you ask for are reasonable. In general, 
the most you should ask for — or expect — is the equivalent of a 5 
percent to 10 percent discount.
Negotiate Discounts with Vendors
Knowing what the competition offers is your best weapon when 
negotiating discounts, giving you another reason to shop around 
(see the earlier section “Shop Around and Get Several Different 
Quotes” for details). Say, for example, that the reception site you 
really like charges a banquet hall rental fee in addition to the cater-
ing, cake-cutting, and other charges. If another reception site in the 

Part IV: The Part of Tens  
230
area waives the rental fee for a minimum guaranteed number of 
guests, point that out to the manager of the first site and ask for a 
similar deal.
 
The trick to successful negotiating is offering something in return 
for something else. In the preceding reception example, the trade 
is a guaranteed head count in exchange for waiving the rental fee; 
you’re offering to pay for a minimum of, say, 100 guests, so the 
vendor is still making money.
Use this approach with all your vendors. For example, ask the 
photographer if he’ll give you all the proof sets for free if you order 
a certain number of albums. Or ask him to throw in a few free 
enlargements if you agree to purchase the negatives.
Again, timing is everything when asking for discounts. You’ll be 
more successful getting vendors to shave prices if you aren’t 
competing with other marrying couples for the same resources. In 
other words, although it never hurts to ask, don’t expect to score 
deep discounts in the height of wedding season.
Use Your Social Network 
to Your Advantage
You know the theory that everyone is connected to everyone 
else by no more than six other people? Well, that theory, broadly 
speaking, is what using your network is all about. You may not 
know any singers personally, but your family or friends may have 
direct or indirect contacts with singers. More important, such 
personal contacts often lead to discounts you wouldn’t get — and 
couldn’t expect — in a strictly vendor-client relationship. So don’t 
be shy about putting out a call for help among your family and 
friends. It could net you great talent at a low cost.
Opt for Services Instead of Gifts
Do you have a friend who’s a whiz at cake baking and decorating? 
Ask her whether she’d be willing to make your wedding cake as a 
gift. Similarly, your artistic niece may be thrilled to do the calligra-
phy for your invitations as a special gift to you and your betrothed. 
And your computer geek buddy from college may be willing to put 
together digital photo albums or design your wedding Web site in 
lieu of buying you towels or a crystal bowl.

 Chapter 16: Ten Ways to Get the Most for Your Wedding Dollar 231
 
Having friends and relatives lend their talents to your celebration 
saves you money, makes those friends and relatives feel good 
about being an important part of your day, and lends a uniquely 
intimate and personal touch to your wedding.
Become a DIY Expert
Unless you’re having a super-formal wedding, you can do many of 
the things that go into a nuptial celebration yourself — and save 
a lot of money. You can buy bulk flowers and create your own 
arrangements for bouquets and centerpieces, for example. If you 
have a computer and a good printer, you can create your own invi-
tations, programs, and place cards.
You can even save money by making, instead of purchasing, gifts 
for your intended, your wedding party, and other important people. 
You can make scrapbooks of your history together for your maid 
of honor and earrings or bracelets for your bridesmaids. For the 
best man and groomsmen, decorate canning jars with photos of 
them with the groom, and then fill the jars with homemade trail mix. 
Check with your local crafts store for kits and other ideas.
Pay with a Rewards Credit Card
If you don’t have the cash saved when deposits are due, consider 
putting those deposits on a credit card that gives you rewards like 
cash back or frequent flyer miles. Then use the reward to help pay 
for other aspects of your wedding or honeymoon.
 
It’s easy to go over your budget when you don’t actually see the 
cash you’re handing over or have to deduct a huge amount from 
your checking account register.
To avoid unintended splurging, follow these steps:
 
✓ Earmark one credit card for wedding expenses, and don’t use 
it for anything else.
 
✓ Keep a running tally of charges, so you don’t get any unpleas-
ant surprises when the statement arrives.
 
✓ Commit to paying off that credit card as soon as possible. 
Finance charges alone can throw your wedding budget way off 
and put you into much more debt than you anticipate.

Chapter 17
Ten Inexpensive 
Wedding Favors
In This Chapter
▶ Saying thanks to your guests without going over budget
▶ Exploring inexpensive favor options
T
he cost of wedding favors can get out of control quickly. 
Something that looks like a bargain at $3 per unit translates 
into a $300 bill if you have 100 guests. And don’t forget sales taxes 
and shipping costs. Go for a $10 favor, and suddenly you’ve added 
at least $1,000 to your 100-guest wedding budget. Yikes!
Fortunately, if you want to give favors (but remember that you 
don’t have to; see Chapter 18), you have lots of inexpensive 
options to choose from. The ten listed here can be found (as of this 
writing) for less than $2 a piece, but they still provide a nice thank-
you to your guests. Many of the ideas here have even cheaper do-
it-yourself alternatives, too.
 
For most favors, and particularly those you order online, the per-
unit cost goes down as your total quantity goes up. So, for exam-
ple, if you decide to order 50 personalized shot glasses, each one 
may cost $1.10. But if you order 150, the per-unit price may drop 
to $0.60. I’m not suggesting you order twice as many favors as you 
need. However, if your order is close to a price-reduction thresh-
old — say you need 130 units, and the price drops significantly 
if you order 144, it may be more cost-effective to place a slightly 
larger order. (By the way, an order of 144 is called a gross, and 
many vendors offer discounts if you purchase a gross.)

Part IV: The Part of Tens  
234
 
The Internet makes shopping and price comparisons easier than 
ever. Here are a few general Internet tips before you start browsing 
the thousands of favor options out there:
 
✓ Crash the online clearance bins. Many favor Web sites have 
“clearance” tabs, where you can find great deals on more 
expensive favors. Here’s the catch: If an item is being cleared 
out, the e-tailer may not have enough in stock to meet your 
needs. However, don’t fret; you can always mix and match 
favors, collecting great bargains from the virtual clearance 
bins.
 
✓ Set aside money to order samples. If you’re leery about 
ordering favors online — or if you just prefer to see and touch 
what you buy, no matter what it is — set aside $50 to order 
samples. Most Web sites allow you to order one item as a 
sample. You won’t get the discount for quantity, obviously, 
but it’s better to spend $5 or $10 to be sure a favor is what 
you want rather than be disappointed in what you get (and be 
out $100 or $150). Remember, many personalized items can’t 
be returned.
Bookmarks
Bookmarks are useful and inexpensive. Wedding-themed metal 
bookmarks can be had for less than $1 each at the many wedding 
favor Web sites I mention in this chapter. Or you can order cus-
tom-printed bookmarks from online sites like www.printingfor
less.com, where the base price for 500 2- by 6-inch bookmarks 
with full color and scuff-resistant coating on the front is less than 
$125 — or $0.25 a piece.
 
If you have a home computer, printer, and laminating machine (or 
access to one), you can create and print your own bookmarks for 
even less money.
Candles and Candle Holders
You can get candles and candle holders in any number of styles, so 
you can fit virtually any theme or hobby. Want to go really roman-
tic? Lay a long-stemmed rose candle across each place setting at 
your reception. Wedding Favors Unlimited (www.weddingfavors
unlimited.com) has white and red rose candles for less than $2 
each when you buy 96 or more.

 Chapter 17: Ten Inexpensive Wedding Favors 235
Dollar stores are good places to shop for candles and candle hold-
ers, too, especially if you want to mix and match styles, colors, and 
scents.
Candy
Sites like the Candy Wrapper Store (www.candywrapperstore.
com) offer full- and fun-size candy bars in personalized wrappers; 
most have a variety of designs to choose from. You also can order 
Jordan almonds, Hershey Kisses, and other confections with per-
sonalized stickers or packaging. Prices vary widely, depending on 
the size and quantity you order. Personalized fun-size or miniature 
candies typically start at less than $1 a piece.
Many sites allow you to buy either the candy with the custom 
wrapper, or just sets of wrappers or stickers. For example, at 
Custom Candy Bar Wrapper (www.customcandybarwrapper.
com), you can buy a set of 120 personalized stickers for the bot-
toms of Hershey Kisses for less than $20, or you can get 120 Kisses 
with the stickers affixed for a few dollars more. If you can get a 
good deal on candy locally — and you have the time to do the 
wrapping yourself — you can save at least a few bucks.
Another option is to purchase favor tins and fill them with candy 
that you buy in bulk or on sale. The Web site www.wrapwithus.
com has tins and other favor containers for less than $1 each.
 
Buy glass serving bowls at your local dollar store, fill them with 
bulk candy and use them as centerpieces at your reception. 
Provide a scoop and small plastic bags or favor tins so your guests 
can take the candy home.
Coasters
Coasters come in all kinds of materials and themes; you can even 
find photo coasters. A set of four cork coasters, including packag-
ing, such as a clear plastic box or tulle bag, runs about $1 to $1.20. 
You can find glass coasters for less than $2 a piece. Stoneware 
coasters usually cost more, but you may be able to find bargains 
online. Check out the wedding-themed coasters at American Bridal 
(www.americanbridal.com), for example, or look at discount 
stores for deals.

236
Drink Mix Packets
Coffee, tea, lemonade, hot cocoa, and other drink mixes are popu-
lar favors, and you can get them personalized for your wedding 
at reasonable prices. Wedding Favors Unlimited (www.wedding
favorsunlimited.com) offers personalized cosmopolitan and 
margarita drink mix packets for $1.25 a packet (minimum order is 
30 pieces). This site offers other drink mix packets as well.
 
Buy your favorite coffee, tea, hot cocoa, or lemonade mix in bulk, 
and fill snack-sized plastic bags with four to eight scoops of the 
mix. Then put the bagged portions in mini gift bags from your local 
dollar store (you usually can get three or four bags for $1). Don’t 
forget to tag the favors with directions for use. This do-it-yourself 
project takes more time, but you may be able to save a few bucks.
Magnets
Nearly everyone has a magnet or two on the refrigerator, so this 
is a useful and universal favor idea. Price depends in large part on 
what kind of magnet you choose, but you can find them for less 
than $1.50 a piece. Remember that personalized magnets usually 
are sold in lots of 50 or 100, so you may see a total price for the lot, 
rather than a per-unit price.
Check out Web sites like Zazzle (www.zazzle.com) — which 
offers discounts on larger orders but doesn’t require a minimum 
purchase — and Memory Magnets (www.memorymagnets.com).
 
“Save the date” magnets are a cool substitute for traditional 
wedding announcements, and, as long as they aren’t oversized, 
postage is the same as for paper announcements. Plus, if you use 
magnets as your announcement, you may decide not to buy sepa-
rate favors: Everybody you invited already has your wedding sou-
venir on their fridge!
Photo Frames and Keychains
Miniature photo frames are popular wedding favors, and you can 
get nice ones for around $1 a piece. Use your home computer to 
print your names and the date — and any message you care to 
include, such as “Thank you for coming” or “We’re glad you’re 
here” — on paper that complements your color scheme, and slip it 
into the frame.

 Chapter 17: Ten Inexpensive Wedding Favors 237
Photo keychains are another inexpensive option (also less than 
$1 each). Again, you can put your own message in the photo slot — 
or you can even use your engagement picture or another photo 
of you and your new spouse. E-Favors (www.efavors.com) has 
a variety of inexpensive favors, including photo frames and key-
chains.
 
Buy wood or metal coffee mug trees at your local dollar store or 
discount retailer, and decorate them with the keychains and rib-
bons as centerpieces for your reception tables.
Plantable Favors
Miniature pots of herbs, cacti, or lucky bamboo are quite expensive —
typically $4 or more a piece. But you can give your guests seed pack-
ets or plantable paper for a much more reasonable price.
Milkweed Café (www.milkweedcafe.com) offers “Confetti to 
Grow” — special paper laced with wildflower seeds that your 
guests can plant after your wedding. You can choose from eight 
shapes (which are about 1-inch square) and a rainbow of colors. 
Six hundred pieces of confetti costs $50. Place a few pieces (along 
with planting instructions) in an inexpensive “Thank you for 
attending” note at each place setting.
Milkweed Café also has larger plantable paper favors at reasonable 
prices. Their Celebration Grows and Share & Blossom favors cost 
between $1 and $2 per unit.
Botanical Paperworks (www.botanicalpaperworks.com) also 
has inexpensive plantable favors, including a wedding cake–
shaped plantable card (available in six colors and customizable 
with five ink colors) for less than $2, including matching envelopes.
Soaps
Many favor Web sites offer good prices on wedding-themed soaps 
packaged in pretty gift boxes. Wedding Favors Unlimited (www.
weddingfavorsunlimited.com), for example, has a broad vari-
ety of soaps starting at less than $1 a piece.
 
You often can find miniature soaps at dollar stores and discount 
retailers; you can then personalize them with paper tags or self-
stick labels that you create on your home computer.

Part IV: The Part of Tens  
238
Swizzle Sticks
Swizzle sticks are inexpensive and unusual favors. You can buy 
different styles in bulk at your local party supply store, or you can 
order personalized swizzle sticks from countless online favor sites. 
At Only Wedding Favors (www.onlyweddingfavors.com), for 
example, you can get 50 personalized swizzle sticks for about $25. 
If you’re planning for 100 guests, you could order 200 swizzle sticks 
for about $100 and give two — tied together with a ribbon — to 
each guest.

Chapter 18
Ten Traditions to Reconsider 
When You’re on a Budget
In This Chapter
▶ Opting out of wedding industry propaganda
▶ Choosing to forgo the usual wedding traditions
T
he wedding industry is built on the premise that every bride 
and groom must do certain things to have the wedding of their 
dreams — and the businesses in this industry do their best to con-
vince you that your day just won’t be complete if you don’t con-
form to their ideas of what’s appropriate.
The truth is that you can make your wedding whatever you want it 
to be. If you don’t have much money and don’t want to start your 
newly married life with a lot of wedding debt, you can find lots of 
ways to save. Regardless of what wedding professionals would like 
you to believe, here are ten things you can do without or find inex-
pensive alternatives for. For details on deciding what’s most impor-
tant to you and your intended — and what you can do without — see 
Chapter 1.
A Traditional Location
More and more couples are forgoing the church-and-reception-hall 
wedding in favor of less traditional sites. Sometimes it’s simply a 
matter of personal preference, but it also can be a way to signifi-
cantly trim your costs. After all, renting a pavilion in a public park 
is a lot cheaper than renting a ballroom at a fancy hotel.
These days, you can go pretty much as far afield as you like in 
choosing a location for your ceremony and reception. Couples 
have been married in bowling alleys and fast-food restaurants, on 
beaches and golf courses, and even in carwashes and in midair 

Part IV: The Part of Tens  
240
while skydiving. If you and your betrothed share a hobby or met 
in unusual circumstances, you may be able to save a lot of money 
by choosing a site that reflects your interests and your history 
together. (See Chapter 4 for more on selecting ceremony sites.)
 
The reception typically eats up at least half of a wedding budget, 
because you’re paying for food, entertainment, and decorations 
(and alcohol, if you decide to have it). If your budget is particularly 
tight, you can ease the strain substantially by looking for fun alter-
natives to a conventional reception hall, such as a clambake on 
the beach or a backyard barbeque. (Chapter 11 tells you what you 
need to know to choose the best reception site for you.)
Traditional Wedding Clothes
Brides get married wearing everything from prom-style dresses to 
business suits, and plenty of grooms bypass the traditional tuxedo 
for a suit or even less formal wear. All these options are much 
cheaper than traditional wedding garb, and most of them can be 
worn again.
In fact, until the end of the 19th century, most marrying couples 
wore outfits that later became their “Sunday best” clothes. Even 
Queen Victoria reused part of her wedding dress; she wore the lace 
overskirt many times, including as part of the outfits she wore for 
her Diamond Jubilee celebrations nearly 50 years after her nuptials.
Your wedding outfit should reflect your style and personality — 
not the wedding industry’s conventions. Why spend $800 or more 
on a traditional wedding dress if you can look stunning in a $150 
evening gown — especially if you can wear that same gown again? 
(Refer to Chapter 6 for more on inexpensive wedding gown and 
tuxedo options.)
A Romantic Limo Ride
No rule says that you have to be whisked away from your cer-
emony to your reception in a spotless white (or black, or pink, or 
baby blue) limousine. Instead of paying $75 an hour or more (plus 
the tip for the chauffeur) for a traditional fancy ride, look into rent-
ing a cool convertible or a luxury sedan and having the best man 
act as your driver. In many areas, you can get a 24-hour rental for 
around $100, compared with an average of $500 to hire a limo for 
a measly four hours. (Chapter 11 provides more information on 
transportation options.)

 Chapter 18: Ten Traditions to Reconsider When You’re on a Budget 241
 
Check out free-standing car rental agencies — ones that aren’t 
located at airports, train stations, or other transportation hubs, 
where rental fees are often higher. If you live in a metro area, look 
to the suburbs for a car rental; you could save a lot by going out 
of town.
Does a friend or relative have a car you just love? If so, ask about 
borrowing it for the day. Or you can eliminate this expense entirely 
if you have your ceremony and reception at the same place.
Professional Photography 
or Videography
If you’re reluctant to pay $1,000 or more for professional photogra-
phy or video services, you’re in luck; you have lots of reasonable 
alternatives to choose from. If all you really want is a collection of 
candid shots, for example, you can supply your guests with single-
use cameras and encourage them to take pictures at will. Or you 
can ask your guests to take pictures with their digital cameras and 
then drop off their memory cards with a designated person at the 
reception.
If you have your heart set on group shots of your wedding party 
and families, but want to be kind to your budget, you can ask a 
friend to take those pictures for you. Friends or family members 
also may be willing to take video of the ceremony and reception; if 
no one has a decent video camera, you can rent one for a fraction 
of what hiring a professional costs.
 
These are all valid alternatives you may want to try, but do remem-
ber that the quality will likely decrease if you decide to use them. 
Chapter 9 goes in depth into your options and provides pros and 
cons of using a professional versus going the friends and family 
route.
The Tossing of the Bouquet 
(Or the Garter)
Not only do you not have to throw a bouquet or garter, you don’t 
even have to include these two traditional items in your wedding. 
In fact, a great way to trim your budget is to cut down on the 
number of fresh flowers you use.

Part IV: The Part of Tens  
242
For example, instead of carrying a bridal bouquet down the aisle, 
consider carrying something that holds sentimental or symbolic 
value for you, such as a family member’s Bible. This item also can 
count as your “something old” or “something borrowed” from 
the traditional bridal adage. Or you can carry a simple bouquet 
of three of your favorite flowers. You can discover some more 
money-saving tips on picking flowers in Chapter 8.
A Traditional Reception
The wedding reception is really just a party — a way for your 
guests to help you celebrate your marriage. But you don’t have 
to confine yourself to traditional ideas about what your wedding 
reception should look like. Instead, focus on what you, your new 
spouse, and your family and friends enjoy.
For instance, maybe all of you are more comfortable at a backyard 
barbeque than in a vast ballroom. Or maybe you’d rather play 
board games than dance. I heard of one couple that took their 
guests to a college basketball game after the ceremony. Another 
exchanged vows at a park, and then changed clothes and cap-
tained softball teams with their guests. Yet another couple held a 
potluck dinner in a barn they decorated for the occasion.
 
You also can elect not to have a reception at all; instead throw 
a party at home on your first anniversary. Such a party is a lot 
cheaper, simply because it doesn’t have the word “wedding” in 
front of it: Your guests won’t expect a wedding cake, for example, 
or floral centerpieces, or even formal invitations, for that matter. 
Even if you decide to have a more wedding-like reception at a hotel 
ballroom or other facility, you can save as much as 30 percent by 
calling it a reunion instead of a wedding celebration.
A Traditional Tiered Cake
According to The Bridal Association of America, the average wed-
ding cake costs $543. But, of course, no rule says you have to have 
a cake for your wedding. You can serve whatever dessert you like; 
you can even opt for a dessert buffet. Some popular (and often less 
expensive) options include the following:
 
✓ A chocolate fountain with fruit and other foods for dipping
 
✓ Doughnuts or cupcakes (which can be arranged in tiers to 
resemble a cake)
 
✓ Ice cream novelties

 Chapter 18: Ten Traditions to Reconsider When You’re on a Budget 243
 
✓ Italian cookies
 
✓ Pie (even a variety of flavors)
 
✓ Truffles
If you choose a dessert from the caterer’s menu, you probably 
won’t even pay extra for it. The per-person price usually includes 
dessert.
 
Anytime you put the word “wedding” in front of a product, the 
price goes up — often by 25 to 50 percent or more. If you want to 
have a cake, ask to see party cakes instead; you may find one you 
really like for much less money. (For more ways to trim cake costs, 
see Chapter 12.)
Professional Musicians
You don’t have to pay an organist, harpist, or another musician to 
serenade you up and down the aisle or to provide dance music at 
the reception. Today’s portable CD players have excellent sound 
quality, and virtually every store that sells CDs has wedding collec-
tions for $25 or less. (See Chapter 13 for other ways to trim music 
costs.)
At Wedding Music Central (www.weddingmusiccentral.com), 
you can download entire wedding programs — all the music you 
need for your ceremony and reception — for a fraction of what 
you’ll pay professional musicians or DJs. This site even provides 
you with a guide to an iPod wedding (with packages starting at 
$18) and guidance on selecting the right music for every phase of 
your ceremony and reception.
Monogrammed Napkins
People who sell monogrammed napkins argue that they’re an easy 
way to incorporate your wedding colors into your reception décor. 
Compared with other wedding paraphernalia, napkins emblazoned 
with your names and wedding date are relatively cheap; you can 
get 100 embossed cocktail or dinner napkins for about $50 to $100. 
But if your budget is tight, this is one item you can cut without any-
body noticing. Plain cocktail napkins work just fine, and they’re a 
lot cheaper; depending on where you shop, you can get 100 for $5 
or less.

Part IV: The Part of Tens  
244
 
Most reception sites offer different colors of table linens, so you 
can select colors that match or complement your wedding colors. 
Best of all, the reception site’s linens are nearly always included in 
the cost of using the facility.
Expensive Favors
Back in the day — that is, since ancient times — newly married 
couples gave out favors to their guests as a way of sharing their 
good fortune. In the 15th century, guests at weddings (and other 
celebrations) were sent home with trinket boxes made of crystal, 
porcelain, or precious metal. Inside these boxes were five sugared 
almonds or other sweets to represent health, wealth, fertility, hap-
piness, and longevity.
These days, I’m sure few people know the meaning behind that 
little mesh bag of Jordan almonds at each place setting. And I 
doubt guests come home bragging about the good luck they expect 
to get from the miniature silver picture frame or heart-shaped mea-
suring cup they were given at the reception. In fact, many wedding 
guests leave the favors behind, simply because it’s something they 
won’t use and don’t want cluttering up their own homes.
 
If you really want to give your guests favors, check out Chapter 17 
for inexpensive ideas. But, really, this is one area you can safely 
cut without worrying about offending anyone. Concentrate your 
efforts (and limited funds) on making the party as fun as it can be; 
that’s the best way to favor your guests.

Part V
Appendixes

In this part...
S
o many details are involved in planning a wedding 
that it’s easy to lose track of what tasks you still 
have to complete and where you are in your spending 
plan. So in this part, I provide worksheets to help keep 
you organized.
With these worksheets, you can plan when things need 
to be completed, record prices from different vendors, 
and even make a to-do list for you and your betrothed 
(and anyone else who’s taking charge of an element of 
your wedding). You also can stay on top of your budget 
with these worksheets by plugging in actual costs or 
vendor estimates, comparing them with your original 
budget, and adjusting your budget as needed.

Appendix A
Your Planning Calendar
T
he planning calendar in this appendix is based on a 12-month 
timeline leading up to a wedding. If you have less time to plan 
your wedding, you can still use this calendar; just do upfront tasks 
more quickly, and be a little more ruthless in what you decide to 
forgo. For example, if you have only three months to plan your 
wedding, tackle the tasks under “12 to 9 Months in Advance” first. 
However, in this circumstance, I suggest you skip the expense of 
an engagement photo, newspaper announcement, and party.
No matter how long your planning calendar is, I recommend giving 
yourself a starting date and completion deadline for each task to 
help counter any tendencies toward procrastination.
 
You don’t have to do everything on this list. If you don’t want to 
go through premarital counseling or send announcements to your 
local newspaper, just cross it off your list.

Price Comparison 
Worksheets
A
lways get written estimates when you interview wedding ven-
dors. Then you can use the information on those estimates 
to fill out this worksheet, which allows you to compare what is and 
isn’t included with each vendor and see at a glance which pack-
ages and pricing best suit your needs.
 
Refer to the appropriate chapters to discover pointers on the 
questions to ask vendors and the information you need to make an 
informed decision.
 
Amend any of the following worksheets to suit your needs. If, for 
example, you want to serve something other than a traditional 
wedding cake at your reception, ask bakers for a cost-per-guest 
figure to make your comparisons as accurate as possible.

Appendix C
Your Wedding Checklist
T
he checklist in this appendix is designed to help you keep 
track of the things you need and want for your wedding. Use 
the checkboxes to mark things off as you purchase or line them up.
 
You probably don’t need or want everything on this list, so I sug-
gest you cross out the things that you don’t want and highlight the 
ones that top your priority list. Doing so makes it easier to remind 
yourself — at a glance — what really matters for your wedding and 
what you can do without. Use the blank lines to fill in items that 
are important to you but aren’t included here.

Appendix D
Your Wedding Budget
F
iguring out how much you can spend may be the most stress-
ful aspect of planning a wedding, especially if you don’t take 
the time to set a budget and identify your priorities. At the begin-
ning of your planning process, write down ballpark estimates 
for the things that you want for your wedding in the “Estimated” 
column of the following table. As you get more reliable informa-
tion, such as written quotes from vendors, plug those numbers 
into the “Actual” column. Don’t forget to make any necessary 
adjustments to other budget lines when you make changes. Build 
a cushion (of between 10 percent and 15 percent) into your overall 
budget to account for unexpected expenses.
 
Fill out the columns in pencil so you can easily make changes if 
your priorities shift — if, for example, you decide you’d rather put 
money toward the cake than pay for the fancy aisle runner you ini-
tially envisioned.
 
If others are involved in financing your wedding, give them a copy 
of your budget so they know where you do and don’t want to 
spend money.
