hether or not you’re an
accomplished pianist,
Google’s intriguing new
experiment in artiﬁcial intelligence will
be music to your ears. AI Duet lets you
play a tune by clicking the onscreen
keyboard or pressing keys on your
physical one, then picks up on your
melody and works out a musical
response so it can play along. This
creates a duet with your computer
and, although it’s seldom perfectly in
tune, it uses the power of neural
networks to improve over time.
To do this, the online app has
learned scores of melodies, including
keys, rhythm and timing. Built by
Yotam Mann in collaboration with
Google’s music and art project,
Magneta and Creative Lab, it can also
be used with a MIDI keyboard if you
want to take things to another level.
AI Duet is fundamentally about
machine learning and pushing the
technology to ever greater heights.

As if the internet didn’t have enough cats, this feline
generator adds a bunch more. Draw a cat in the left-hand
box, then click the ‘process’ button and the software will sift
through 2,000 stock images of moggies to fill in your
outline. Some results look very strange indeed and many
users are already saving and sharing their images on social
media. But the experiment isn’t just confined to cats: you
can do the same thing for building facades, shoes and
handbags. The tool makes great use of TensorFlow, the
open-source software library for machine intelligence, and
we have to tip our hat to Christopher Hesse for creating
these highly addictive image-to-image demos.
bit.ly/travel418
Rather than finding out how long it will take you to get to
a particular location, TravelTime Maps shows where you can
travel to within a set amount of time. Type in your location,
select a mode of transport – be it train, car, bike or your own
two legs – and indicate how long you’ve got (between 15
and 90 minutes). The tool will then calculate your boundary
and you can tell it what you’d like to do, such as visit a
museum, cinema or coffee shop. It will list the destinations
within reach, taking into account the time constraints, and
give you the option to get directions. You can also set up
multiple starting points and perform another search
from each
destination,
which is
particularly
handy when
you’re
planning a
whistle-stop
tour of an
area or want
to find
a spot to
congregate
with friends.
In that sense, it complements other
AI musical experiments such as The
Infinite Drum Machine (bit.ly/drum418),
which lets you play around with
endless drum-sound combinations,
and Giorgio Cam (bit.ly/giorgio418),
which cleverly lets you capture a

about
Instagram
– aside
from users who

makes sharing your holiday highlights
incredibly tedious. Thankfully, that
irritation has now been removed, and
the updated Instagram app lets you

Need to Know
8 8 - 21 March 2017
What happened?
Passwords for a host of major websites
were leaked after the systems of the
web-services company Cloudflare
suffered a far-reaching bug that
allowed data to slip out of
secure areas.
The memory-leak bug,
dubbed ‘Cloudbleed’ in
reference to the infamous
‘Heartbleed’ breach in
2014, was spotted by
Google security researcher
Tavis Ormandy, who revealed
that bits of data that should
have been secured were actually
being saved and leaked. Ormandy
said that he was able to view private
messages from dating sites,
password-manager data, hotel
bookings and more.
The bug is in a tool from Cloudflare
that is supposed to securely send data
such as login details between browsers
and websites. Anyone aware of the flaw
could in theory harvest the data, and
Cloudflare said as many as 120,000
websites were affected. The bug was
around for at least six months, but
Cloudflare patched it in under an hour
after being made aware of it.
How will it affect me?
First of all, don’t panic. Because the bug
was spotted by an industry researcher
– rather than a hacker – it’s unlikely
that any leaked data has fallen into
criminal hands.
If you have an account with a site that
uses Cloudflare, you may want to
consider changing your password.
Affected companies include Uber, Fitbit
and OkCupid, but because Cloudflare’s
services are widely used by online
companies, many more are likely to be
affected. 1Password data was also
leaked, but the password manager
has stressed that its user information
was safe.
Unlike a traditional hack or password
leak, Cloudbleed hasn’t led to a tranche
of login credentials being dumped
online or held by criminals. Instead,
random bits of data were leaked, such
as usernames and passwords, photos
and the security details for sending
such information.
There remains the threat that hackers
were indeed aware of the bug over the
six months it was leaking data and
managed to collect some of it. Plus,
some of the leaked information was
cached by search engines, so it’s
possible it could be harvested, though
Cloudflare has worked with Google and
Bing to purge that data.
In such instances, all you can do is
change your password for any affected
sites, and update passwords on other
sites where your login details are
reused, so hackers can’t try the
credentials across all your accounts.
If the services and sites you use offer
two-factor authentication, enable it
now. This will prevent a new device from
accessing your account and stop
any hacking attempts.
For sensitive sites, such as
dating services, that don’t
offer extra login protection, it
may be worth contacting the
company to say you’d
appreciate an added layer of
security. You could also consider
buying your own two-factor key,
such as Yubico’s Fido.
That aside, there’s very little you can
do, but the good news is that this
incident is unlikely to lead to any online
victimisation. You can check if any sites
you’ve visited recently are affected by
Cloudbleed by using Cloudbleed Simple
Checker (cloudbleed.github.io).
What do we think?
This incident highlights the perpetual
difficulty with staying safe online. Even
if you use sites with HTTPS and have
strong and complex passwords that you
regularly change, you can still be caught
out by mistakes made not only by the
company you choose to work with but
also by the suppliers they hire. All the
companies in the chain need to do a
better job, but there’s little any of us can
do to make sure this happens. Even if
you stop using Uber because of the
security breach, plenty of other sites
and services you use will be Cloudflare
customers, too.
Of course, as much as companies can
be a weak link, so too can users. Do
what you can to stay safe by using
secure passwords, not reusing them
across sites and enabling two-factor
authentication where possible. Beyond
that, all you can do is stop worrying –
there’s no point fearing such attacks
when they’re unlikely to affect you and
there’s nothing you can do to avoid the
repercussions in the first place. So stay
vigilant, but don’t panic.

Need to Know
What happened?
The House of Lords has
suggested that the
government raise its
minimum broadband
pledge from 10Mbps to
30Mbps. Reading through
the Digital Economy Bill on
its way to becoming law,
peers argued that the
10Mbps universal service
obligation (USO) wasn’t
enough – especially as the
guarantee won’t come into
force until 2020.
Regulator Ofcom has
previously said that
10Mbps is a suitable USO
for current broadband use,
but high-quality video
streaming and other
data-hungry uses will
eventually mean that
minimum speed will need
to be pushed higher. In his
proposal to the House,
Labour peer Lord
Mendelsohn said: “This
[10Mbps] may be sufficient
today, but not by the time
the USO is proposed to be
delivered”.
How will it affect you?
The amendment may still
be removed by the
government, meaning the
USO will slide back to
10Mbps. Either way, by
2020 Brits will be
guaranteed the right to
Lords want 30Mbps
broadband for all
request a line of whichever
minimum speed is decided
upon, meaning broadband
providers will have to step
up and roll out the
necessary infrastructure to
the 1.4 million people
around the country on
speeds below 10Mbps.
What do we think?
Regardless of the figure
the government eventually
decides on, those Brits on
speeds below 10Mbps –
and some are well below
that – should remain the
priority. While 10Mbps is
far below what many of us
already expect from
broadband, getting those
1.4 million people who
suffer snail-pace speeds up
to a connection that can
support BBC iPlayer and
Skype is more crucial than
boosting those on already
usable speeds to
something faster.
ISPs shouldn’t wait for
the Lords and MPs to sort
out the figure, either. Much
effort has been made to
get more UK households
on superfast lines –
officially, those over
24Mbps – but more should
be done for those suffering
on the far side of the digital
divide, with all but useless
connections.
What happened?
Sick of smartphone frailty
and poor battery life?
Perhaps it’s time you got
yourself an old classic
phone such as the Nokia
3310. The best-selling
handset was officially
relaunched at Mobile
World Congress 2017 and
looks more or less identical
to the original device, with
a few notable differences.
For starters, the old
Nokia 3310 didn’t have a
camera of any sort, but the
2017 model features a
2-megapixel rear snapper,
plonked just above the
Nokia logo on the back. It
also has a 2.4in colour
display and boasts 22
hours of talk time and one
month of standby time on
a single charge. That’s a lot
of games of Snake.
The Nokia 3310 will cost
around £50 and is available
in four colours – Warm Red
and Yellow, both with a
gloss finish; and Dark Blue
and Grey, both with a
matte finish.
How will it affect you?
If you feel nostalgic for
your old Nokia phone,
which slipped easily into
your pocket and lasted
for days without
charging, then the revival
of the 3310 is sure to
delight you. That said,
you should be aware that
the specs aren’t great:
there’s no 3G or 4G, the
camera is poor and it runs
Nokia’s proprietary Series
30+ software.
Although the new 3310
has Opera Mini installed
alongside Snake, don’t

all about the battery life.
What do we think?
With its limited features,
we don’t see many Android
and iPhone users switching
to this handset – not even
hipsters! Nostalgia aside,
the Nokia 3310 is only likely
to appeal to complete
technophobes on an
extremely low budget who
baulk at managing the bells
and whistles that clutter
modern phones. Still, it
would make an ideal spare
handset, and you may feel
it’s worth the £50 asking
price for Snake alone.

Nintendo Switch
nintendo.com/switch
Versatility is the name of the game
with the Nintendo Switch – a
console like no other that blurs the
line between couch gaming and
on-the-go play. If you’re at home,
you can just slip it in its TV dock,
grab a controller and use it as a
TV-connected console; when you set
off on your travels, simply lift it out of
its dock, slide the pair of controllers
into either side and you’re all set to
enjoy the full console experience in
the palm of your hand, playing Zelda
on an otherwise tedious train journey.
The Switch dispels any doubts
about its ability to manage the
transition between living-room and
mobile gameplay. Moving from the
big screen to its surprisingly bright
line-up of games that will be available
at launch. If it wasn’t for the flagship,
system-selling title Zelda: Breath of
the Wild, there would be nothing
much to get your teeth into. In time,
however, we’re confident that the
Switch will deliver plenty of family-
friendly competitive gameplay.
What happened?
Installations of ad-blocking software had
skyrocketed in recent years, but the use
of the add-ons to avoid seeing online
advertising has now flatlined at about
22% of web users. That’s according to
the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) –
which, naturally, has a stake in the fight
and releases a research report into
ad-blocking software every year.
From 2015 to 2016, use of tools such
as Adblock Plus, uBlock Origin and
Ghostery leapt from 15% to 21%, but
over the past year it’s climbed by only a
single point to 22% of those surveyed.
The IAB said that’s partially down to
publishing companies banning users
from accessing their sites when ad
blockers are enabled.
The figures come as Shine, an
ad-blocking tool that Three trialled
across its mobile network last year, has
revamped its business model from
banning ads to offering them. Now
rebranded Rainbow, it no longer bans
ads but verifies which ones are good
enough to show to consumers, in an
effort to improve online advertising.
How will it affect you?
Shine isn’t the first ad blocker to switch
sides. Last year, Adblock Plus started
whitelisting ads it deemed “acceptable”
and – rather hypocritically – started
selling ad space itself. Ad blockers
Fewer web users taking up ad blockers
siding with advertisers makes it difficult
for users to find a tool that truly blocks
all marketing material. We look at two of
the best tools in the final section of our
cover feature on page 46.
What do we think?
On one hand, advertising is the main
way that journalists and content makers
get paid online, and ad blockers put a
dent in that income. On the other hand,
online advertising is intrusive, slows
page-load times and has even been
known to spread malware, so it’s
understandable that people are keen to
block them. Making advertising less
annoying is one solution, but the less
intrusive it is, the less effective it’s
believed to be.
Paying directly for content is another
route, but web users have shown they’re
not always keen to shell out for access.
The good news from the IAB’s report is
that use of blockers has flatlined –
although no publisher will happily
ignore losing 22% of their ad income.
Still, the fact that blocking is no longer
increasing at the same rate at least buys
companies more time to solve the
advertising conundrum.
6.2in, 1,280 x
720-pixel resolution
display is seamless.
There are no load
times and no pause
as your game
reloads at the
different resolution,
whether you’ve just
docked or
undocked the
console. We’ve had
almost a week to
play around with it
(albeit with no games) and our initial
impressions are fantastic.
You get plenty of stuff for your £280
outlay, including the Switch itself, its
dock, a pair of Joy-Con controllers (with
straps) and the controller grip. There’s
also an AC adapter and an HDMI cable.

When you need an emergency haircut, but can’t face the trip
to the barber’s, you can now arrange one through this
innovative mobile service. Like an Uber for your hair, Capelli
lets you quickly find and book a barber in your area via its
mobile app, then call them out to your home, hotel or
workplace. You can earn £5 a head by referring friends to the service and choose
from a range of professional hairdressers. Capelli eventually hopes to cover
every major city in the UK. Help it reach its £10,000 funding target by 23 March.
Although Android 7.0 Nougat
is only just out of the gates,
the focus of attention has
already moved on to the next
version of Android, which
will be the eighth major
release of the world’s most
popular mobile operating
system. If Google’s past
penchant for alphabetising
is anything to go by, it’s very
likely that it will be
colloquially known as
‘Android O’.
As for its full name, in
keeping with the tradition
of sweet-treat inspiration,
it’s rumoured that Android
8 will be called Oreo.
Indeed, Google has already
teamed up with the US biscuit
manufacturer on a game called Oreo
Dunk Challenge, in which you throw a
virtual Oreo cookie around the world to
try to dunk it in a glass of milk. You can
play the game by visiting the website
(oreospacedunk.com) and scanning an
Oreo cookie with your phone’s camera.
The game asks you to swing your phone
in your hand to chuck the Oreo into
earth’s orbit and around the planet.
What isn’t clear is whether this is the
entire cause for the leaks and rumours
surrounding an Oreo-Google
partnership, or if there’s something
deeper going on that will tie into
Android O later.
Will the next Android
version be called Oreo?
What’s new on Kickstarter

Other than speculation over the
name, we don’t yet know much about
Android 8, but considering that most
phones are still waiting for Android 7,
this is hardly surprising.

It seems logical that Google
would choose Oreo as the name
for Android 8, even if the brand
isn’t as well known here as it is in
the US. After all, what other
sweet treat could the company
use – oatmeal? Orange? Ovaltine?

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:
Robert Capps, VP of
business development
at NuData Security
(nudatasecurity.com)
Q
Why can’t more
be done to stop
phishing scams
stealing our money?
Alan Holloway, via email
A
It’s not surprising
that phishing
scams are still a
valid concern. The internet
is awash with stolen
consumer data ripe for
malicious use, providing
Chrome malware poses
as missing font
A security researcher
has discovered a
new hacking tactic
in Chrome that
manipulates websites
into displaying missing
font prompts in order to trick users
into downloading malicious files.
The infection was first spotted on
an unnamed WordPress website by
Mahmoud Al-Qudsi, a researcher
at cybersecurity firm NeoSmart
Technologies, who detailed the
process in a blog post. The attack
involves a hacker exploiting
JavaScript to alter the rendering
of content on a webpage, causing
it to resemble mis-encoded text,
which appears as a jumble of
symbols and shapes.
The code then prompts you to
fertile soil in which fraudsters
can grow innovative
attacks using
purloined
black-market
data.
Victims of
stolen data are
a natural target
for phishing,
since most major
data breaches target
login credentials, email
addresses and passwords.
This data allows
cybercriminals to concoct
nearly flawless phishing
attacks, often by
impersonating major
organisations or financial
institutions that victims
normally interact with online.
Educating people about
online risks is an uphill battle,
and one that
inevitably finds
even the
savviest web
user ensnared by
some fraud schemes.
As such, we need to take
a step back and start
respecting that may people
cannot be expected to learn
how to avoid clicking
something designed
specifically to lure them in
and empty their accounts.
Instead of blaming the
victims, who are unlikely to
become more adept at
protecting their data, we
security companies must
find ways to do our jobs
better. We need to draw on
our collective ability to
innovate and invent
solutions that don’t cost
consumers the money that
fraudsters are suckering
them into giving up.
In fact, there are many
solutions out there right
now that could render
most phishing attacks
obsolete by devaluing any
benefit the fraudsters get
out of them. Let’s get on
with it and stop this threat
for good.

download the missing fonts through a
Chrome language pack to decipher the
text. Clicking Update results in a file
being downloaded and you’re then
invited to run the file, which all the while
appears to be a perfectly safe Chrome
download. The attack is particularly well
disguised and makes every attempt to
look like a legitimate Chrome pop-up.
Al-Qudsi has forwarded the discovery
to Google’s security team, but pending
an update patch, at the time of writing,
Chrome still fails to identify the file
as malware.

Microsoft patches critical
Flash flaw
Microsoft has released a critical update
to Adobe Flash Player, which could allow
hackers to use it to perform remote-code
execution processes if left unpatched.
“This security update resolves
vulnerabilities in
Adobe Flash Player
when installed on all
supported editions of
Windows 8.1, Windows
Server 2012, Windows
Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1,
Windows 10 and Windows Server
2016,” Microsoft said. It added that
the update should be installed
immediately, but will require a restart
to take effect.
The update was supposed to be
rolled out in February’s Patch Tuesday
security update, but that was delayed
due to a “last minute issue”. The
updates scheduled for release will now
be rolled out in the 14 March update
instead. However, this part of the
update has appeared much sooner,
presumably because it could cause
major problems if left unpatched.

LinkedIn’s revamp is obviously inspired
by Facebook, but given how familiar
most of us are with that social network,
this is no bad thing. A thorough declutter
has resulted in a streamlined navigation
bar, a more personalised news feed and
a single search engine for people, jobs,
companies, groups and schools. It’s now
possible to chat to people in real-time via
a pop-up messaging window and you’re
better able to see who is looking at your
content, which helps you gauge how
effective it is. Thankfully, it’s still easy to
configure your privacy settings and there
are helpful suggestions for improving
your profile and expanding your network.
Backyard Worlds

This NASA-funded site wants your help

hopes that human eyes will cut through
the fuzzy visuals and recognise new
brown dwarfs and the elusive Planet 9,
and will include contributors’ names in
scientific papers and posters. We love
the slick design and visuals, the
opportunity to discuss potential finds
and the simple classification tools. The

Retro Gear sells old consoles, computers

navigation feels cumbersome because
several sections are empty and include
unnecessary submenus. On the plus side,
the site includes live customer support,

Finding activities to entertain children
is no mean feat but this beautifully
designed website makes light work of it.
Aside from suggesting fun things to do
at home, it offers a search engine for
local attractions and lets you narrow

age range, facilities and whether you
want an indoor or outdoor venue. The
results neatly summarise the important
information about each activity, and let

some good competitions to enter, too.
Visit Kendal

shops, get a taste of the nightlife, explore
the great outdoors and enjoy a flavour
of the local culture, thanks to a dizzying
number of links and an insightful blog full
of suggestions and insights. Visit Kendal
certainly covers all bases, right down to

in any order you want. Different notes can be coloured and linked together using
arrows while boards can be shared with other people for viewing or collaboration.
It’s extremely easy to use and there’s plenty of help if you get stuck. You can also
export your work as a PDF, plain text, HTML or Word document, and get more than
the standard 100 notes by upgrading your plan or referring friends.

Make Wix more secure
Any Wix (www.wix.com) website
can now be hosted using HTTPS,
the more secure version of the
web. While this is only strictly
necessary if you’re collecting
information such as passwords or
payment details from visitors, it’s
good practice to operate a secure
site, not least because Google has
hinted that it may start penalising
sites that don’t use it, causing
them to drop down the rankings
of a search result. For Wix users,
setting up the service should
involve nothing more than flicking
a control-panel switch. The

T
he Alcatel Pixi 4 (5)
is a 5in quad-core
phone that comes with
4G connectivity, Android 6
Marshmallow and a microSD-
card expansion slot. What
really sets eyebrows rising,
though, is that it can be
bought on the High Street
from just £44.99 (Argos,
bit.ly/alcatel418, locked to
EE). Even free of an operator
contract, it’s cheap, costing
just £59 for an unlocked
model from Giffgaff (www
.giffgaff.com). That’s more
than £100 cheaper than the
Motorola G4 budget
smartphone, which we
reviewed in Issue 404 (bit.ly/
webuser404).
The Pixi 4 comes in
different sizes and
specifications, but Alcatel
hasn’t made it easy to
distinguish between the
different models. There’s the
Alcatel Pixi 4 (4), the Pixi 4
(5) and the Pixi 4 (6), all of
which have different internal
components and different
sized screens (four, five and
six inches, respectively).
To make matters even more
confusing, there are also 3G
and 4G models of the Pixi 4
(5). Here, we’re reviewing the
Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) 5045X
4G-enabled model.
Alcatel Pixi 4 (5)
Build and design
We found the 5in
model provided a good
compromise between
a pocketable size and
enough screen space
for media browsing,
videos and one-handed
operation. However it is
a tad heavy, weighing
148g, and chunky –
9.5mm from front to
back – so it’s not the
most comfortable
device to hold.
The screen is framed
by a slim bezel, with
three touch buttons
positioned below.
You’ll find a microUSB
charging and data port at the
bottom; volume rocker and
power button on the right;
and a 3.5mm headphone jack
at the top of the phone. The
rear cover is made entirely
out of plastic and is easily
removed. Underneath, there’s
a removable 2,000mAh
lithium-ion battery, along with
micro-SIM and microSD
storage slots. The phone has
a single front-facing speaker
which we found delivered
an acceptable level of volume.
Disappointing screen
We expected a phone with
a 5in screen to provide 720p
of 356cd/m2 (candles per
square metre) means that the
phone is bright enough to be
used outdoors, but you’re not
going to be able to read it in
blazing sunlight. Also, it only
managed to display 70.6% of
the standard sRGB colours in
our tests, which left images
looking grainy and dull.
At maximum brightness,
resolution (720 x 1,280 pixels)
but, unfortunately, the Pixi 4
only provides a disappointing
480 x 854 pixels, resulting in
a low pixel density of 196ppi.
This means you won’t be
watching those YouTube
videos in HD, and will see
pixelated text when reading
web pages.

8 - 21 March 2017 21
Discuss this review at forum.webuser.co.uk
It would be unreasonable
to expect a phone at this
price not to have some
shortcomings. The big
question is whether you’re
prepared to live with these
problems in exchange for
paying well below the
standard price for a phone.
The Pixi 4 (5) has a 5in
screen, works with 4G
networks and performs
reasonably well, but it falls
short on the screen quality,
camera and battery life,
and you’ll undoubtedly get
a better phone if you spend
a bit more. However, you
can’t have everything and
the Pixi 4 (5) is a good
enough device if you’re on
a really low budget.
Vodafone Smart Prime 7,

Moto G4 2016,

bit.ly/moto418
the screen has an
underwhelming 0.4cd/m2
black level, and the 868:1
contrast ratio is poor. To cap
it all, the colours shift when
you view the screen from
different angles.
Given the very low price
of this phone, we’d expect
a screen that’s a bit below par,
but it’s still disappointing.
Performance, camera
and battery power
The Pixi 4 (5) is a budget
phone so it’s no surprise that
it performs like one. Housing
a quad-core, 1GHz MTK6735M
Mediatek processor and a
scant 1GB of RAM, it only
managed a score of 416 in our
Geekbench 3 single-core tests
and 1,173 in the multi-core
tests. To put this into
perspective, the Samsung
Galaxy J5 (around £200)
managed 555 and 1,948
respectively, while the
mid-range OnePlus 3T (£399)
scored an impressive 1,903
and 4,274 in these tests.
These results have a
noticeable impact on the
Pixi’s performance and apps
don’t feel as slick as they
would on faster phones.
Gaming results were poor,
too, with GFXBench
(gfxbench.com) recording
a score of 5.4fps. That’s
nothing out of the ordinary
at this price and is better than
some larger-screened phones
we’ve previously tested
because the Pixi’s smaller
screen doesn’t place as much
strain on its graphics chip.
We weren’t impressed with
the battery either. It lasted
only 8 hours and 17 minutes
in our looping video test,
so heavy users might end up
running out of power before
getting home.
We didn’t expect the
camera on the device to
match those on flagship
phones but the rear-facing
5-megapixel and front-facing
2-megapixel cameras were far
from impressive. With or
without flash, the Pixi 4 (5)
struggled to take acceptable
photos, and every shot we
captured was marred by
noise. The colours appear
slightly washed out and it
doesn’t cope well with
background shadows, unless
your object is well lit.
Enabling HDR mode
improved things a little,
but no matter what the
conditions, the Pixi 4 (5)’s
photos looked grainy and
murky. To make matters
worse, you can’t touch-to-
focus, meaning you have to
rely on the camera software
to pick the correct spot to
focus on, which we found
to be hit and miss.
Android 6 Marshmallow
On the plus side, the phone
comes with Android 6
Marshmallow. While this isn’t
the newest version of
Google’s mobile OS (Nougat
is), it’s very easy to use and
has a slick interface that’s
responsive, even on the Pixi
4’s relatively low specification.
Better still, the device
doesn’t hit you with an
alternative Android skin or
lots of bloatware.
It come pre-installed with
Alcatel’s OneTouch Launcher,
which is the only extra
supplied and can easily be
changed if you wish. As with
any standard Android device,
you get the entire suite of
Google apps pre-installed,
including Maps, Gmail,
YouTube and Google Drive.

Andy Shaw tests a double-ended USB memory
stick for solving mobile-storage problems
accompanying
printed
instructions
to the letter,
we couldn’t
see our
Android
backup at all.
However,
Exploring
the device
manually, we
discovered that
you can
circumnavigate
the software
and access the
files directly
in Windows Explorer.
This suggests that the
pre-installed software is
superfluous and is taking up
room that could otherwise
be used as extra storage.
When it comes to the
crunch, this is an expensive
device for the amount of
designed to provide external
storage for devices that don’t
have a memory-card slot.
It looks like a standard USB
memory stick with a full-sized
USB connector at one end
and a Lightning connector at
the other to fit an iPhone or
iPad. It also comes with
a Micro-USB adapter to
connect to an Android device.
We tested the Picture
Keeper Connect on both an
Android tablet and an iPhone.
It requires you to install an
app on your phone or tablet,
but once you’ve done that,
making a backup is relatively
straightforward.
Picture Keeper Connect
doesn’t back up videos by
default because they can
quickly fill the device, but you
can turn on the option via
its menu. The app also lets
you choose whether to back
up all your files or select
individual ones, including
photos, videos, contacts,
music and documents.
Once you set it running, the
app keeps you informed of
the backup’s progress. Files
transferred to the Picture
Keeper Connect aren’t
deleted from your phone or
tablet automatically but the
option is there if you need it
– for example, if you run out
of space on your mobile
device while enjoying a day
out and need to free up
storage to take more photos.
We ran into problems the
first time we tried to transfer
our images from the Picture
Keeper Connect to a PC. The
device comes with portable
PC software installed but
despite following the
storage you get. You’re
paying a premium for the
Lightning connector and the
link to the apps, both of which
are mainly of use to Apple
devices, and it’s very
expensive when you consider
that a standard 16GB USB
stick costs less than £10.
T
he storage on your
phone or tablet can
quickly fill up with
photos and videos, and you
can easily run out of room.
Some Android devices have
a memory-card slot so you
can side-step the problem
by moving your files across
to a card and save them
elsewhere. But if you have an
Apple device or an Android
phone with no expandable
memory, you need to
carefully manage your
storage.
The Picture Keeper Connect
is a USB memory stick
This is an expensive device for the
amount of storage you get

If you’re looking for a simple way to convert a
video file from one format to another – so you
can watch downloaded HD videos on your
iPhone, for example – Eusing Free Video
Converter is worth a look. All you need to do is
click the Profile box in the centre of the main
screen and choose a format to save the file in.
This can be a general video (or audio) format
such as AVI or MOV, or a type of device such as
Apple iPhone or Google Android.
Choose a folder to output the file to, then click
Convert to select your file. It’s very easy to use
and free of the bundled rubbish that comes with
many video converters (yes, we’re talking about
you, Freemake Video Converter).
Black Bird Cleaner is a new, lightweight
system cleaner that removes junk files and
frees up space on your hard drive. You can
choose which areas to target, and select all
the cleaning options or just the recommended
ones. In addition, there are sections for
PC optimisation, image optimisation (which
reduces the file size), a disk analyser, services
manager and system information screen.
The program can also find old installers and
ZIP files for you to delete.
Note that some of the features, such as the
options to compress unused directories and
delete cached thumbnail files, are only
available in the paid-for Pro edition.
BurnAware Free is one of the better free
disc-authoring tools, and can write to all types
of optical media, including Blu-rays. It can

so you can use them again. The latest version
gains a new user interface – the first major
update in quite some time – and adds much-

support to the ‘Copy to Image’ tool.

See at a glance where
emails come from
It’s obviously important to know who
sent you an email, but it can also be
useful to see which company or website
the message came from. Perhaps, for
example, you can’t remember the name
of the customer-support person who
contacted you, or you suspect that
a security warning may actually be a
phishing scam. A new extension called
Gmail Sender Icons (bit.ly/gmail418)
makes life easier by adding information
about the sender and an accompanying
favicon (usually the company logo) to
every email you receive. Not only does
this make your inbox and Gmail search
results look more colourful,
it means you no longer have to open
a message to find out which domain
it was sent from.
The information
won’t interfere with
Chrome’s extensions manager is pretty basic, consisting of little
more than a list of add-ons that you can enable, disable or
remove. For a superior alternative, meet NooBoss (bit.ly/
noob418), which is decidedly different to the old boss and makes
managing dozens of extensions a lot easier. It displays all your
installed add-ons in a pop-up panel, either as a list or as icons.
NooBoss lets you quickly filter entries by typing a letter or
two, and shows you at a glance which extensions are active. You
can opt to receive Desktop notifications when they’re updated,
and enable or disable them all with a single click. Best of all,
NooBoss lets you create rules so that specific add-ons become
active only when you visit particular websites – for example, you
could set your ad blocker to kick in on a particularly ad-stuffed
site – which stops Chrome using too much memory.
Note that NooBoss automatically adds you to its community
when you install the extension, but you can easily leave by
deselecting the relevant option.
it’s a handy way to gauge people’s
views on what you’re viewing.
Scale web pages for
perfect printing
The latest version of Chrome (56)
adds a useful new Print Scaling
feature that should help reduce
paper wastage when you’re printing
web pages and PDFs. By default, the
feature rescales pages to 100% of
the selected paper size so nothing
will spill over onto extra sheets, but
you can adjust the scale manually by
clicking the ‘More settings’ link in the
Print panel. Use the arrow buttons to
increase or decrease the size of the
printed content. This is a welcome
addition to Chrome – especially as
similar features have long been
available in other browsers – but we
still miss the ‘Simplify page’ option,
which the developers removed in
version 53 of the browser.

When you’re watching a video on
YouTube, do you ever find yourself
scrolling down to read the user
comments and getting distracted from
your viewing? If so, you’ll appreciate
a new add-on called Comment Mode
(bit.ly/comment418), which moves the
comments section to the top of the
page and the video player to the right,
so you can watch and read at the same
time. Just click the speech-bubble icon
on the video bar to activate comment
mode or turn it off again. Currently,
Comment Mode doesn’t work when
you watch videos full-screen, and it’s
a shame that comments can only be
displayed to the left of the player, but

Find and remove expired
bookmarks
Clicking an old bookmark only to be
told that “the page does not exist”
is as disheartening as revisiting a
favourite pub and finding that it’s
been knocked down. But who knows
how many dead links are lurking in
your Bookmarks folder, waiting to
disappoint you? Find out by
installing 404 Bookmarks (bit.ly/
book418), a new Firefox add-on that
scans your bookmarks collection for
links to expired pages and lets you
remove each one with a single click
(although not all in one go). It isn’t the prettiest of tools and, annoyingly,
it rescans your entire collection of bookmarks every time you click its toolbar,
but we were glad to be rid of such now-useless entries as ‘50 ways to make
Vista faster’ and ‘Travel directions from Multimap’.
Get reminders to take
screen breaks
It’s amazing how long you can stare at
your computer screen without blinking
– and without even realising you haven’t
blinked. This can lead to dry, tired eyes
and long-term vision problems, which is
why Blink Reminder (bit.ly/blink418) is
such a great idea. As you can probably
guess from its name, this add-on
reminds you to blink and look away
from your monitor at regular intervals –
every 20 minutes by default, although
you can change the frequency in its
settings. Reminders appear as Desktop
notifications that are easy to close, and
the add-on also nudges you take a
10-minute break once an hour, which
sounds like a sensible idea to us!
Keep using plugins in

The latest version of Firefox is the
first to drop support for plugins that
use the Netscape Plugin Application
Programming Interface (NPAPI) – with
the exception of Adobe Flash, which
Switch off
JavaScript with
one click
As we explained in our feature
‘What your browser leaks about
you’, in Issue 416 (bit.ly/
webuser416), JavaScript is
essential to many websites, but
it also poses a threat to your
privacy and security. We
recommended two tools for
turning JavaScript on and off in
Chrome and Firefox, and now
there’s
one for
Opera,
too, in the
form of
JavaScript
On/Off
(bit.ly/
js418).
Click the
toolbar button once to disable
JavaScript and again to enable
it. You can also add specific sites
to a whitelist so that JavaScript
is always allowed on them.
View your history
in a side panel
All browsers keep a
record of the sites you visit, but
accessing your history (which
you do by pressing Ctrl+H in
most browsers) usually involves
leaving the page you’re viewing
and opening a new tab. Vivaldi’s
latest innovation is to display
your browsing history in a side
panel that doesn’t take you away
from what you’re doing. You can
filter the panel’s contents to
show only entries from today,
the past seven days or the past
30 days;
search
for a
specific
page;
and see
how
many
pages
you visited on a particular day.
To open the panel, click the clock
icon on the left of the browser.
OTHER BROWSERS
This fortnight’s most useful tips and add-ons to help you get the
most from Chrome, Firefox, Opera and more
is (unfortunately) still widely used
across the web. To see for yourself,
open the Add-ons Manager and click
Plugins, and you’ll notice that the
list is now bare. If a favourite site still
relies on a plugin – which indicates
that it’s pretty old – you can continue
to use the likes of Java, QuickTime
and Silverlight by downloading the
Extended Support Release (bit.ly/
extended418) edition of Firefox. This
is aimed at businesses and schools
rather than individuals “who always
want the latest features, performance
enhancements and technologies”.
The Extended Support Release will
continue to support plugins, although
some newer Firefox extensions
(note the distinction) may not work.
Also bear in mind that the reason
Mozilla abandoned plugins in the first
place is because they pose serious
security and stability problems, so
switch to ESR at your own risk.

Flipboard 4

Flipboard, which lets you
read articles from
millions of news sources
for free, was named one
of our 50 favourite apps
in Issue 403’s cover
feature (bit.ly/
webuser403). It’s now
gone back to the
drawing board and
relaunched with a new
Smart Magazines tool
that makes its content
much easier to navigate.
Smart Magazines is the latest example of a trend for
personalised news, following the likes of Google Play
Newsstand (bit.ly/newsstand411) and the BBC News app
(bit.ly/bbcnews418). Flipboard has always let you create
customised magazines by combining favourite articles, but
Smart Magazines now does the customising for you. It gets
to know your tastes the more you use it, and employs
real-life editors working alongside algorithms to show you
more content that’s of interest to you and less that isn’t.
Some say this ‘echo chamber’ trend is unhealthy but with
Flipboard, it’s a practical necessity because it had grown
too large to be manageable. In six years, it has amassed
30 million magazines in 34,000 topics, with new articles
added almost constantly. Few of us have the time or
inclination to wade through it manually.
This glut of content doesn’t
slow Flipboard down. Pages
and search results load instantly
and the ‘flip’ method of swiping
up through pages works better
than ever. Text and photos are
rendered clearly, and video and
audio support is seamless.
Even in Airplane Mode, we
were able to flip through page
after page of headlines, though
articles won’t load unless
you’re online.
If you’re not enjoying using
the app, you can
set up and use
Flipboard in
your browser
(flipboard.com).

Alexa has broken out of
Amazon’s Echo speaker in a bid
to conquer the world
36
8 - 21 March 2017
Amazon’s voice assistant
Alexa is growing up fast
and expanding to areas
its rivals haven’t yet
reached. David Crookes
explains what’s new
Our guide to Alexa
Haven’t we already met?
Yes, it’s quite likely. Alexa, Amazon’s
voice-activated virtual assistant, was
released in November 2014 and is best
known for living inside the Echo smart
speaker, where she obeys commands
to play music, place online orders, read
recipes and perform other tasks. She’s
already proved a versatile rival to Apple’s
Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google
Assistant, and now she appears to be
on the path to digital domination.
Blimey. What’s changed?
Alexa’s reach has been
growing as more and more
developers build and publish
skills for her. Skills are similar
to apps, and they expand
Alexa’s capabilities by
allowing her to perform lots
of new tasks, whether it’s
ordering a pizza or calling for
an Uber taxi (for a full list, see
bit.ly/skills418). That’s just half
the story, though. Not content
with being a central part of
Amazon’s own products,
whether that’s the Echo or Fire TV, Alexa
is being built into a growing number of
devices. By interacting with scores of
third-party smart-home products, Alexa
is taking automation to another level.
Why is Alexa growing so fast?
In June 2015, Amazon made the
important decision to open its voice-
recognition technology to third-party
developers and manufacturers. It did this
by releasing two free products. The first
was the Alexa Skills Kit (bit.ly/skillskit418),
which allows professionals and hobbyists
to create new skills and integrate
Alexa into existing products.
The second was Alexa Voice
Service (AVS, bit.ly/voice418),
which lets manufacturers embed
Alexa in their devices so users
don’t need to buy an Echo to
issue voice commands.
Which types of products
have Alexa built in?
Anything and everything,
it seems. One of the most
illuminating items is the stylish
C by GE Lamp (cbyge.com).
This has AVS inside and works
like an Echo, so you can issue all
manner of commands, such as “Alexa,
what’s the news?” and “Alexa, wake me
up at 8am”. The difference is that it has
a large circular lamp on top that you can
turn on and off using your voice.
Just as impressive is LG’s Smart
InstaView Refrigerator (bit.ly/
lgfridge418), which has a 29in
touchscreen as well as Alexa built in.
What other devices does it work
with?
Among the many
devices with Alexa
built in are the
thermostats made
by Nest (nest
.com) and British
Gas’ Hive (www
.hivehome.com).
So, for example,
you can say
“Alexa, tell Hive
to put the heating
on at 25 degrees”.
In fact, Alexa is
ideally suited to
home automation because the
technology has gained support from
companies such as Belkin Wemo,
Samsung SmartThings and LIFX.

ALEXA, WHAT’S THE NEWS?
8 - 21 March 2017 37
Amazon Alexa
Discuss Alexa at forum.webuser.co.uk
Does it work with
portable gadgets?
Yes. Fitbit was the first
wearable-technology
company to work with
Alexa, so users can ask
how many calories
they’ve burned, the
number of steps taken
and how much water
they’ve consumed.
Meanwhile, phone
manufacturer Huawei has installed Alexa
in its Mate 9 handset – making it the first
mobile company to do so.
So, can Alexa follow me about?
Yes, and she can even take you for a ride.
Ford, Volkswagen and Hyundai are
building Alexa into their vehicles, while
BMW’s Connected phone app allows
Alexa to check fuel levels and lock
vehicles remotely. Then there’s Logitech’s
ZeroTouch dock and app, which lets
drivers plug in their Android phone to
receive traffic alerts, listen to music and
make calls without using their hands.
Are there any unusual
Alexa devices?
Of course. There’s an
Alexa-enabled robot
called Lynx by Ubtech,
which can tell who
it’s talking to just by
looking. Then there’s
Hubble Hugo, a robot
that’s reportedly able
to detect emotions
accurately. Odd skills
abound, too. You can
try the Sixties computer
program Eliza to
engage with a virtual
psychotherapist,
and read out your
email address to
Have I Been Pwned
(haveibeenpwned.com) to see if your
account has been compromised in a
data breach. You can even ask Alexa
to look up the rules of board games.
Doesn’t this mean Amazon is
gathering data about me?
Yes, and the company has admitted as
much. Nikko Strom, one of the founding
members of Amazon’s Alexa and Echo
team, said, “we get an insane amount
of data coming in that we can work on.”
But before you consider ditching Alexa,
it’s worth knowing what kind of data the
company is gathering. When you
ask Alexa a question, your audio is
encrypted and sent to the cloud for
processing. These recordings are
analysed, together with any
information from third-party
services, so that over time the
results you receive become more
accurate. The data Amazon retains
includes the location of your Alexa
device. In the spirit of transparency,
however, you can go to Settings,
History in the Alexa app to review
everything you’ve said, and delete
anything you don’t like.
But isn’t it always listening
to my conversations?
Alexa is ‘always on’, but doesn’t
record and store everything you say. It’s
simply listening for the ‘wake word’,
which by default is “Alexa”. Only when
it hears that word does it start to record.
The recording includes the fraction
of a second before you say “Alexa”
and stops as soon as your request is
processed. On an Echo speaker, you can
tell when Alexa is recording by the
rotating blue light that runs around the
top. You can stop Alexa listening at any
time by pressing the microphone button
on the top of your device.
Still, it’s all about getting us to
buy more from Amazon, isn’t it?
Not according to Amazon CEO Jeff
Bezos. Although Alexa can certainly be
used to buy goods from Amazon, Bezos
told Billboard: “Alexa is primarily about
identifying tasks in the household that
would be improved by voice”. He says
that music and home automation are its
big selling points. One thing’s
for sure, though: it’s only
set to become more
widespread, at least in
the short term. Martin
Garner, an analyst at CCS
Insight, told the BBC that
Amazon is pushing Alexa
hard and “building out
the ecosystem quickly”.
Considering Alexa is said
to have cost the
company $330m (around £265m)
in 2016 – a figure that’s forecast to rise
to $600m (about £480m) this year –
it can’t afford not to make money back.
Accidental orders
Alexa hit the headlines in January when a TV news
anchor in San Diego activated viewers’ devices
while discussing the story of a girl who had
inadvertently ordered a toy through her parents’
Amazon Echo. He said, “I love the little girl, saying
‘Alexa ordered me a dollhouse’,” which activated
lots of Echoes in and around the Californian city,
each of which tried to order a dollhouse of its own.
How rude!
Manners don’t cost anything, but when it comes
to Alexa, there’s no need to say please and thank
you. This, however, is causing concern as some
parents suggest she’s teaching their kids to be
rude (bit.ly/alexarude418). Still, it’s not as bad
as the moment, captured on video, when a child
asked, “Alexa, play ‘Digger, Digger’” and
received the reply, “You want to hear a station
for porn”, followed by a string of rude words.
Alexa, whodunnit?
Last December, Amazon refused to hand over
information recorded by an Echo speaker after police
in Arkansas obtained a warrant for a device belonging
to suspect James Bates. Officers believed it may have
contained voice evidence that would prove Bates had
strangled his friend in a hot tub. “Amazon objects to
over-broad or otherwise inappropriate demands as
a matter of course,” the company said.

You’re never alone on the web – there’s always someone or something
watching you. Jane Hoskyn, Edward Munn and Robert Irvine explain
how to beat the snoopers and be completely invisible online
S
pammers, scammers and other snoopers have
devious ways of tracking your every online move.
Google knows more about what you’ve been up to
than you do, and eavesdroppers have become adept at
piecing together your so-called digital ‘fingerprint’ or
‘footprint’ from even your most mundane web activity –
then using it to work out who you are, what you do and
even where you live.
Fortunately, there are ways to dodge these spies,
without sacrificing the pleasure and convenience of
life online. We’re not about to tell you to delete your
Facebook account, stop using Google tools altogether
or turn to the Dark Web – well, you can if you want, but
these extreme measures aren’t the only ways to guard
your identity.
In our complete guide to staying anonymous online,
you’ll discover how to safeguard your details against even
the most persistent privacy invaders, using settings,
tweaks and free tools that let you go about your usual
browsing business as easily and quickly as ever – but
without being spied on. We also pick our nine essential

see this stuff, so can anyone – easily.
You become even easier to identify
and track if you stay logged into online
accounts all the time. Your Social Media
Fingerprint (bit.ly/social418) is an
open-source web tool that reveals
where you’re signed in right now. When
we tried it, it reminded us that we’re still
logged into a Blogger account we’d
forgotten about years ago.
SEE HOW MUCH INFO YOU’RE LEAKING
Discover what Google knows
about you
Google’s new My Activity tool
(myactivity.google.com) is based on
a searchable timeline of your every
move, as tracked by Google. If you
use Chrome, Android and Windows
10, and sign into third-party services
using your Google account, your
timeline will cover nearly everything
you do on your computer, phone and
tablet. It’s quite unsettling.
To its credit, Google has loaded
My Activity with ways to limit the
tracking – and to block advertisers
from using the data it collects. Find
out how in our Mini Workshop below.
Find out how easily you can be
identified
Off the top of your head, can you
name your ISP (internet service
provider), browser version and internet
connection type? Your browser can.
It also knows where you live and the
configuration of your PC, such as the
operating system you’re using and
your screen resolution.
This information creates what’s
known as your online fingerprint
(or footprint). It’s available to every
website you load in your browser,
so it can tailor content to suit you,
for example by displaying the correct
language and currency. But if
websites can see and use this data,
so can advertisers, eavesdroppers,
government agencies and hackers.
The free online tool MyBrowserInfo
(mybrowserinfo.com) reveals how
much fingerprint data you’re
broadcasting right now. First, it
displays your IP (internet protocol)
1
Go to myactivity.google.com in any
browser. Sign into Google
and click through the introductory
screens (they won’t appear again),
then scroll through your timeline. 1
To remove any items from it, and also
from Google’s servers, click the
three-dots icon, 2 then Delete. 3 Click
OK in the box that opens, then click
Delete. To configure your tracking
settings, click ‘Activity controls’. 4
2
By default, Google tracks all your
‘Web & App Activity’, which includes
Chrome browsing, Android apps and
even Cortana activity. To limit this
tracking, untick ‘Include Chrome
browsing history and activity…’, 1
then click Pause. To switch it off
completely, click the toggle so it turns
grey, 2 then click Pause. This doesn’t
delete previously collected data from
your timeline or from Google’s servers.
3
To manage the data Google shares
with advertisers, scroll to the
bottom of the ‘Activity controls’ page,
then click Ads. You’ll see a list of your
interests, as determined by Google.
Untick any to remove them 1
or untick ‘Also use Google Account
activity…’ to remove them all. 2
To prevent Google from using your
data to ‘personalise’ its services,

LOCK DOWN YOUR BROWSER
Enable Do Not Track
Your first line of defence against
trackers is to enable Do Not Track,
a kind of auto-response feature
designed to fend off nosy parkers.
To do this in Chrome, click the
three-dots icon, then Settings, then
‘Show advanced settings’ and tick the
option ‘Send a “Do Not Track” request
with your browsing traffic’. In Firefox,
open the menu, then select Options
(or type about:preferences in the
address bar), then click Privacy. Click
‘manage your Do Not Track settings’
then tick ‘Always apply Do Not Track’.
Do Not Track doesn’t slow down
Just below the
Do Not Track tick
box in your
Chrome settings
you’ll see a
useful-sounding
option, ‘Enable
Auto-fill to fill in
web forms in
a single click.’
Don’t tick it!
It recently
emerged that
auto-fill tools
in browsers
including Chrome, Safari and Opera
can easily be exploited by hackers
to extract your phone number,
address and bank card number.
Finnish developer Viljami
Kuosmanen discovered that when
you use auto-fill to enter basic info
such as your email address on a
phishing website, other sensitive
profile data stored by your browser
WHY NOT TO USE AUTO-FILL
– such as your bank
card – can be made
to appear
automatically in
hidden text boxes.
Easy pickings for
a hacker. See for
yourself in
Kuosmanen’s
online
demonstration
(bit.ly/autofill418).
Firefox, Edge
and Internet
Explorer don’t
suffer this problem because they
don’t have built-in auto-fill, but
Firefox is planning to add it soon.
For your own safety and privacy,
don’t enable it. If you really can’t
be bothered to type your details
manually, use a secure password

LastPass (lastpass.com) or Dashlane

– but that’s because it’s not particularly
powerful. It’s a request, not a rule. In
fact, it might as well be called Do Not
Track If That’s OK Oh Go On Then.
A properly configured browser should
be using other ways to protect your
identity as well. To check if it’s doing
this, run the free online test Panopticlick
(panopticlick.eff.org), created by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF,
www.eff.org). Panopticlick reveals
whether your browser blocks tracking
adverts; whether it blocks invisible
trackers; and whether it takes steps to
protect your fingerprint data. Brace
yourself for a ‘Mixed results’ verdict at
best. We got just one ‘yes’, and we owe
that to our ad-blocking extension.
Get rid of cookies and plugins
Cookies and plugins speed up your
browsing and generally make the web
work properly, but they’re also used to
track you as a matter of course. If
privacy is your priority, get rid of them.
In Chrome, go to Privacy in Settings
and click ‘Content settings’ (or type
chrome://settings/content in the
address bar). Set it to keep cookies
‘until you quit your browser’ and ‘Block
third-party cookies and site data’. Then
click ‘All cookies and site data’ and go
through the list of data-storing files
downloaded to your computer by
a website or advertiser. There may be
hundreds. Hover over one, then click the
cross to remove it, or click ‘Remove all’.
Next, scroll down the Content
Settings window and disable JavaScript
and Flash. You can also disable
‘Background sync’ to prevent closed
tabs sending and receiving data;
prevent sites from tracking your
location; block all pop-ups; and block
access to your webcam and
microphone.
In Firefox, go to Options then Privacy.
Click ‘Remember history’ then select
‘Use custom settings for history’. In the
options that appear, click Always to
open the drop-down menu, then select
Never to block third-party cookies.
In Internet Explorer, you can manage
cookies under the Privacy tab in Internet
Options. In Edge, go to Settings then
click ‘Choose what to clear’.

Browse in incognito mode
All the big browsers have a private-
browsing mode. In Chrome, it’s
incognito mode (press Ctrl+Shift+N to
open an incognito window); in Firefox
it’s Private Mode (Ctrl+Shift+P) and in
Edge it’s InPrivate (also Ctrl+Shift+P).
Whatever you call it, this mode –
which you can use in one window while
you browse normally in another window
– lets you search and visit websites
without leaving a trace. No history is
saved, no content is cached, and all
cookies and
temporary files
are cleared
when you close
the window.
Anyone using
the same
computer
won’t know
what you’ve
looked at or
searched for.
Well, we say
“without
leaving
a trace”, but incognito browsing isn’t
anonymous. It doesn’t hide your
browsing from your ISP, the police
or even the websites you visit. Snoopers
and advertisers can still use trackers
and other cookies; they just can’t leave
them behind.
Set Firefox Private Mode to block
all trackers
Firefox now enables basic Tracking
Protection by default in Private Mode.
This blocks advertising, analytics and
social-sharing trackers included in the
‘basic protection’ list compiled
by security firm Disconnect.me
(disconnect.me) but it still doesn’t block
all trackers, because some are
necessary for websites to work.
If you want to block all known
trackers, go to Options in Firefox,
then Privacy, then click Change Block
List. Tick ‘Disconnect.me strict
protection’, click Save Changes and
then click OK to restart Firefox. This
means you won’t be tracked at all in
Private Mode, but the trade-off is that
some websites may not work properly.
If this happens, you can temporarily
disable Tracking Protection by clicking
the shield icon on the address bar.
Learn Facebook’s privacy secrets
Facebook and anonymity go together
like a horse and roller skates, but that’s
no reason to leave your privacy at the
door – as the social network’s new
Privacy Basics page (www.facebook
.com/about/basics) is keen to remind
you. Privacy Basics is an online user
manual of slideshows containing tips
about your Facebook Settings (www
.facebook.com/settings) along with
useful links. For example, the Manage
Your Privacy section contains a dozen
slideshows including Search (‘What do
people who aren’t my friend see when
they search for me?’) and ‘Photos &
Videos I’m In’ (‘How do I control whether
Facebook recognises me in photos and
videos?’). The Advertising section
explains how to control Facebook’s
infernal targeted ads. Every slideshow
ends with an invitation to ‘Take the
Privacy Checkup’, which confirms just
how anonymous your Facebook activity
isn’t. Click the Edit links to limit the
audience and choose ‘Only me’ for all
personal details – your Facebook friends
don’t need to know your phone number.
Stop Facebook sharing your data
with advertisers
Isn’t it amazing how well Facebook’s
ads seem to know you? ‘Amazing’ as in
‘creepy’. That’s because Facebook hands
over details about your interests,
employment and even relationship status
to its business partners.
To put a stop to this nonsense, go to
Settings and click Adverts. Click a section
(‘Your interests’, ‘Advertisers you’ve
interacted with’, ‘Your information’ and
‘Advert settings’) to see what’s being
shared, then make your changes.
Some sections have on/off toggles
(for example ‘Relationship status’
under ‘Your information’), while
others can be edited by clicking Yes
or No and selecting options from a
drop-down menu. Be sure to click
‘Advert settings’ then Yes next to ‘Ads
on apps and websites…’, then click the
Yes button at the bottom of the small
print, then click No. It’s every bit as
convoluted as it sounds, but essential
if you’d rather not be public property.
Chrome’s incognito
mode hides where
you’ve been, but it’s
not anonymous
If you’re not happy about being
asked to ‘Enter your email address,’
for no good reason, you can get an
anonymous, temporary address from
Guerrilla Mail (www.guerrillamail
.com). Go to the site and copy the
address it currently displays. It’ll
display a new one every 10 seconds.
Use the temporary address to
confirm you’re a real person as and
when needed, and then dispose of it.
There’s a free Guerrilla Mail Android
app, too (bit.ly/guerrilla418).

See (some of) what Microsoft
knows about you
Unlike previous versions of Microsoft’s
operating system, Windows 10 is as
much online as your browser.
Microsoft’s ‘telemetry’ technology
constantly tracks your activity,
showing “blatant disregard for user
choice and privacy,” to quote the
Electronic Frontier Foundation
(bit.ly/eff418).
So Microsoft, like Google and
Facebook, is playing privacy catch-up.
It recently launched a web-based
privacy dashboard (account
.microsoft.com/privacy) that lets you
see what it knows about you. Well,
some of it. Officially, the dashboard
includes Bing and Edge activity, and
data gathered by GPS, Cortana
Notebook and Microsoft Health.
In practice, it doesn’t reveal much
at all (“We don’t have any data
associated with this Microsoft account
at the moment” is its current
catchphrase). Google’s My Activity
timeline reveals far more about our
Windows 10 activity than Microsoft’s
privacy dashboard does – at the time
of writing, at least. These may be
teething troubles, so we’ll stay tuned
for improvements.
Tweak your Windows 10
privacy settings
Microsoft tracks you far more than its
privacy dashboard suggests. To limit
the snooping, configure your PC
settings carefully. Type privacy into
Start and click ‘Privacy settings’, then
click the toggles to enable and disable
the options, some of which you may
not realise were switched on. For
example ‘Send Microsoft info about
how I write’ and ‘Let websites provide
locally relevant content’ are enabled
by default, so switch them off. To
manage targeted ads, click ‘Manage
my Microsoft advertising and other
personalisation info’, then click the
toggle on the web page that opens.
Since the Windows 10 Anniversary
Update, you can no longer remove
Cortana using the native Windows
settings. You can use it without signing
in (click ‘Maybe later’ when asked), but if
you want to remove it completely you’ll
need to use a third-party tool.
Block Microsoft’s snooping using
free tools
Between them, Microsoft’s privacy
dashboard and your Windows 10
‘Privacy options’ screen are frustratingly
limiting. They make no mention of
passwords, Wi-Fi connections, webcam
data or biometrics, which are all vital
chinks in your Windows 10 privacy
armour.
The best tool for controlling these and
umpteen more items that compromise
your anonymity is O&O ShutUp10
(bit.ly/shutup418). It’s free, portable and
very easy to use. The program window
is far more detailed and useful than
your Windows 10 settings page and
uses simple on/off toggles. To quickly
set all toggles to O&O ShutUp10’s
recommended settings for maximum
privacy without sacrificing
convenience, click Actions then
‘Apply all recommended settings’.
To reapply Windows 10’s default
settings, click ‘Undo all changes
(factory settings)’. Some settings
prompt O&O ShutUp10 to suggest
you save a system restore point,
in case you want to roll back your
Windows 10 settings; click Yes in
the pop-up to go ahead.
Microsoft is not a fan of third-party
tools that give you control over your
own privacy, or indeed over your own
PC, so it often blocks programs that
give you deep system access. One
great telemetry-blocking tool, Win10
SpyStop, mysteriously disappeared
from the internet within days of its
launch last August, even though it
worked very well. Was Microsoft
involved in its demise? We’ll leave
you to decide.
STOP MICROSOFT SNOOPING ON YOU
Many privacy-leaking options are enabled
by default in Windows 10’s settings

“Keep calm while we steal your data” went
the slogan for Scroogled, Microsoft’s
anti-Google privacy campaign (you could
even buy the T-shirt: bit.ly/keepcalm418).
The campaign was launched after
Google claimed the right to read your
Gmail messages and then “provide you
with personally relevant product features”,
which is still part of Google’s Terms of
Service (bit.ly/gterms418). But Scroogled
has now been ditched (see what happens
when you go to www.scroogled.com).
And guess what? Microsoft now claims
the right to read users’ emails too.
Following an update in February 2017,
Cortana automatically scans your private
Outlook.com messages and then nags
you to keep any promises you’ve
made in them (bit.ly/nag418). The
good news for us, at least for now,
is that the new feature only applies
to Cortana users in the US.

Switch to a private search site
If you’d rather not spend ages
tweaking your Google settings to
make your searches more private,
use DuckDuckGo (duckduckgo.com)
instead. Unlike many alternative
search sites, it’s not connected to
Google in any way and isn’t interested
in tracking you at all. It doesn’t save
your history or log your IP address,
and there’s no such thing as a
DuckDuckGo account. There are no
ads, and your search results aren’t
skewed according to who or where
the site thinks you are. So as well as
being more private, the search results
it delivers are more objective.
DuckDuckGo uses HTTPS by default
and SSL for extra privacy and
security. To translate the jargon,
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol
Secure) is a standard that adds
security by encrypting all data to and
from some websites; and SSL (Secure
Socket Layer) means that whatever
you type is hidden from anyone who
might be monitoring traffic between
your browser and the server. You can
force websites to use HTTPS by
installing HTTPS Everywhere (bit.ly/
https418) – see page 46 for details.
Send self-destructing encrypted
texts
WhatsApp (www.whatsapp.com) now
uses end-to-end encryption to ensure
that your messages can’t be read in
transit, and it’s significantly more
private than SMS. But in the privacy
stakes, it’s trounced by Signal Private
Messenger (Android bit.ly/sigdroid418,
iOS bit.ly/sigios418). Like WhatsApp,
Signal also uses end-to-end encryption,
but it dispenses with privacy-invading
paraphernalia such as accounts,
tracking and cloud backups. It even
lets you set all incoming and outgoing
messages to self-destruct after
a chosen number of seconds, minutes
or hours. Signal now works in your
browser, too – provided that browser
is Chrome (bit.ly/sigchrome418).
Fake your location using a VPN
A VPN (virtual private network) such as
CyberGhost (www.cyberghostvpn.com)
is your private tunnel through the public
internet. It spoofs your location to
pretend you’re browsing from another
country and encrypts all your data.
As well as making you anonymous and
untrackable, it also unblocks content
you’d normally only be able to access
in other countries, such as US Netflix.
CyberGhost will try to get you to sign
up for its paid-for version (from £3.74
per month), but the basic version is free
and works on Android and iOS as well
as Windows.
Alternatively, you could install Opera
(www.opera.com) as a second browser
– or just switch to it completely. Opera
is completely free and comes with its
own VPN and ad-blocker built in. We
also like Hotspot Shield’s browser
add-on VPN, which works with Firefox
and Chrome – see page 47 for details.
Use Tor for complete anonymity
Tor (www.torproject.org) is the
ultimate – and ultimately difficult –
way to browse anonymously. This free
open-source program is not just
a whole new browser but a
completely private network –
effectively a separate operating
system. It cloaks everything you do,
offline as well as online.
Tor is legal to use, but there is a
slightly dodgy whiff about it because
it lets people access the unpoliced
Dark Web and conduct criminal
activities such as drug dealing and
illegal pornography. But if you want
total anonymity, you may decide that
Tor is worth the effort. Turn to the
next page to find out exactly who
you’re protecting your privacy from.

Who’s Watching
You Online?
To stay anonymous online, it’s useful to know who you’re
hiding your activities from. Here, we reveal exactly who’s
spying on you and how worried you should be
ANALYTICS
Whenever you visit a website, it’s
more than likely you’re being tracked
by an analytics tool, which enables
the site’s owner to understand more
about who you are and how you’re
using the site. An embedded piece
of code is used to collect a range of
data including your location, the
browser you’re using, the keywords
you used to find the web page and
the amount of time you spent viewing
it. This information is collected
primarily so that site owners can see which pages are most popular
and continue to produce engaging content.
There’s no need to worry, because all the data is collected
anonymously, but if you’re unhappy about being analysed in this way, you
can block Google Analytics – the most popular analytics tool – by using
the official browser add-on from Google (bit.ly/optout418).
Worry factor:
SOCIAL NETWORKS
Like search engines, social
networks including Facebook and
Twitter aim to build user profiles
so they can offer tailored
advertising and show you engaging
content that keeps you coming
back. Every time you react to a
post – by clicking a ‘Like’ button for
example – you’re helping the social
network understand what sort of
posts you want to see. You can
review and edit what Facebook
thinks your interests are at www
.facebook.com/ads/preferences.
The excellent browser add-on
Privacy Badger (bit.ly/privacy418,
see page 46) lets you protect your
privacy by replacing the buttons on
social networks with ones that do
the same thing but don’t track you.
Worry factor:
y
SEARCH ENGINES
Google and Bing keep a record of every search you make so they can better
understand your interests, which in turn lets them offer more useful search
results and more relevant advertising. You might think two people making the
same search would see the same results, but the search engines organise their
results according to a number of factors including your location and the sites
you’ve visited previously. To see this weighting, try making identical searches
while logged into your Google account and
while logged out, then compare the results.
To stop search engines tracking you and
saving your searches, you can switch to
DuckDuckGo (duckduckgo.com, see page 43)
or add Disconnect Search (disconnect.me/
search) to your browser so that your searches
with Google and Bing are anonymised.

ISPs
Your ISP can not only see which
websites you visit but also read
anything that you send over the
web that’s not encrypted.
Ordinarily, they’re only interested
if you’re abusing their service in
some way, either for criminal
activity or by simply putting too
much strain on the network. If you
are up to no good, they can share
information with the government
and the police, when requested.
If you feel uncomfortable knowing
that your ISP can see everything
you do online, the easiest way to
keep your activity secret is by using
a VPN (provided you trust the VPN
itself). We’ve recommended some
of our favourite VPNs on page 43.
Tor can also stop your ISP tracking
your browser habits, but it has a
steeper learning curve than the
other services we’ve listed.
Worry factor:
ADVERTISERS
If you’ve ever visited a site and seen ads
related to something you looked at
elsewhere, then you know you’re being
successfully tracked by advertisers.
Advertising firms place ads across
thousands of sites and use cookies to
track which websites you’ve visited and
which ads you’ve seen. This allows them
to tailor new ads for you, tempting you
to buy their products and services.
Most major ad providers let you opt out of behaviour tracking and you
can choose which advertisers you block cookies from by visiting bit.ly/
adchoice418. To opt out of interest-based advertising from Google, visit
bit.ly/gadsettings418. You can do the same for Microsoft at choice.microsoft
.com and Yahoo at bit.ly/yahooad418. Using an ad blocker (see page 46)
also lets you disable tracking to make you more anonymous to advertisers.
Worry factor:
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES
The government spies on individuals and companies to prevent crime and
acts of terror, and new laws passed in last year’s Investigatory Powers Bill
mean that it has greater surveillance privileges than ever before. Dozens
of government bodies including the Home Office and GCHQ now have
the power to force communications companies (including ISPs and
service providers such as Google) to keep records of every website and
messaging service you access over a 12-month period. The same agencies
can also hack phones, computers and servers, and bulk-collect and retain
data. They don’t even need a warrant, although there are controls on
how they use the information.
The simplest way to go undercover
and avoid such surveillance is to use
encryption. Use a VPN to make sure
your online communications are
encrypted and follow our Workshop
on page 54 to protect sensitive files
on your hard drive.
Worry factor:
CYBERCRIMINALS
Cybercriminals write and spread malware
for many reasons, but more often than
not they’re trying to make money, which
can be achieved by spying on you and
stealing your sensitive data. Keyloggers,
for example, allow criminals to watch
everything you type, and steal personal
information such as your passwords and
credit card details. These type of threats
are the most worrying, but you can
protect yourself by making sure you
don’t open suspicious looking emails and
by avoiding software from unknown
sources. You should use strong antivirus software such as Avast Free (www
.avast.com – see page 26) and install SpyDetect Free (bit.ly/spydetect393)
to identify any processes that might be recording your keystrokes. You should
also enable 2-step verification for online services, where available.

Best Add-Ons For
Anonymity
Lots of browser add-ons claim to keep
you anonymous online, but many are
ineffective. Here, we pick the nine tools
you need to guarantee your privacy
AnonTab
bit.ly/anon418
Most browsers now have
a private mode (see page
41), which stops details of
the sites you visit and the
things you search for
being saved to your PC,
but this doesn’t make you anonymous online. A better
way to shield what you’re doing is to use AnonTab, which
is a cross between the popular add-ons NoScript and
HTTPS Everywhere (see below, right).
This useful tool lets you open a web page in a secure
and private environment, masking your IP address,
blocking scripts and encrypting all incoming and
outgoing connections. Not only does this prevent your
data from being leaked and your activities monitored,
it also safeguards you against malware infection.
To use AnonTab, simply right-click a link and choose
‘Open Link in AnonTab’ to view the page securely in
a new tab. You can also click its toolbar button and
type a URL to open it in a safe environment.
Note that although AnonTab works with Chromium
browsers, it isn’t available from the Chrome Web Store.
Privacy Badger
bit.ly/privacy418
We’ve recommended
Privacy Badger so often
that you probably already
use it to block hidden
trackers and spying ads as
you browse the web. Even
so, it’s worth us bigging up
the Badger again because
its developer, EFF, recently
added several useful new features. For example, you can
now prevent WebRTC technology from leaking your
IP address when you make audio and video calls; transfer
your anti-tracking preferences to another browser; and
use the extension in incognito/private mode, so your data
is protected both online and off. Unlike similar tools,
Privacy Badger gives you total control over which
trackers are blocked and allowed, with a handy colour-
coded system that shows what’s safe and what’s not.
An Edge version of the add-on is reportedly in the works.
HTTPS Everywhere
bit.ly/https418
Any website worth its salt
should use HTTPS to encrypt
its traffic and protect its users’
data. Sadly, many don’t
bother and either default to
their unsecure HTTP versions
or use a combination of
encrypted and unencrypted
pages. You can ensure you
always get the safest
connection possible by
installing this excellent tool from the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF, www.eff.org), which forces thousands
of sites to use HTTPS, whether they like it or not. HTTPS
Everywhere works automatically and is regularly updated
with new ‘rules’ to keep you safe from online surveillance
and account hijacking. You can create your own rules so
that specific sites always use their encrypted versions,
and block all unencrypted requests.
Ghostery
www.ghostery.com
While we were writing
this feature, news came
that this popular privacy
tool had been acquired
by a German company
called Cliqz (bit.ly/
cliqz418), which promises
to take the add-on’s
anti-tracking technology to a “completely new level”.
In the meantime, it’s still worth installing Ghostery, if you
haven’t already, because its latest version is the best yet.
As we explained in our workshop in Issue 409 (bit.ly/
webuser409), Ghostery 7 colour-codes trackers into
categories such as advertising, analytics, social media
and ‘essential’, so you can decide precisely which types
of spy to block. Further data tells you if a tracker is likely
to slow your browser, stop a page loading properly or
leak personal information on a supposedly secure site,
and you can block and unblock all or individual pests
with a single click.
If you’d like to see how Cliqz plans to make Ghostery
even better, join the public beta at bit.ly/gbeta418.

AdNauseum
adnauseam.io
If you’ve heard of Adblock Plus (adblockplus.org), you’ll
probably be aware that it allows ‘acceptable’ ads on
websites that pay to be whitelisted. This controversial
policy, coupled with excessive
memory usage, has made many
users switch to alternative
ad blockers, of which these two
are our current favourites.
AdNauseum strikes a
compromise between blocking
annoying adverts and depriving
small websites (which can’t afford
to pay Adblock Plus) of the
revenue they need to survive.
When it filters ads (it’s based on uBlock Origin), it also
clicks them in the background, so the sites still get paid
by the advertising networks. To stop companies using
those clicks to track you, AdNauseum “obfuscates” the
data, rendering their targeting and surveillance futile.
PureVPN’s Bad Ad Johnny extension takes a tougher
approach by blocking all adverts
on all websites, regardless of
whether they’re acceptable or
not. It’s very light on resources
and its hard-line stance against
ads and trackers is tempered by
the options to disable it on
specific sites and only target
certain elements rather than
everything on a page. Bad Ad
Johnny will soon be available for
Firefox, Opera and Safari.
Hotspot Shield
Free VPN Proxy
bit.ly/hsschrome418
bit.ly/hssfirefox418
There’s something slightly
suspicious about browser-
extension VPNs – after all, why
would companies with paid-for
Desktop programs make things
free and easy for you? However,
Hotspot Shield’s add-on for
Chrome and Firefox offers
everything you need from
a VPN in terms of security and speed, but without the
need to download any software.
You can pretend to be in nine different countries,
including Canada, Germany and Spain; bookmark your
favourite sites for easy access; and connect and
disconnect with a single click. You need to pay to unlock
the US and UK options, so it’s not ideal for accessing
restricted content, and you get nagged to upgrade to the
Elite version – including a seven-day free trial. But if your
main objectives are to hide who and where you are, and
what you’re doing, this extension performs brilliantly.
Fake Data
bit.ly/fake418
What’s in a name? An alarming amount when you share
you real moniker online, especially when combined with
your real email address and phone number. Rather than
signing up with websites using your genuine details, you
can maintain your anonymity via Fake Data. This Chrome
extension fills in registration forms with bogus but
real-looking info, without you needing to type anything.
Simply right-click a text box - be it a first or last name,
email or postal address, phone number, company name or
location - and choose the relevant option from Fake Data’s
side menu. By default, the extension is set to use US data,
but you can change this to ‘en_GB’ in its Options.
For Firefox, it’s worth
installing Fake Name
Generator Panel, which
provides you with instant
fake identities – including
postcodes, email
addresses, birthdays, jobs
and card numbers – so you
can safeguard your
genuine details.

Your Complete Guide To Staying Anonymous

48 8 - 21 March 2017
What we liked:
MusicBee won the Gold
Award in our last round-
up of music software
back in Issue 349 (bit.ly/
webuser349) and, two
years on, it’s still our
favourite, thanks to its
combination of excellent features,
fast performance and usability.
When you first launch the program,
it displays a simple wizard for adding
all your existing music to your library.
Alternatively, you can rip music directly
from CD and the program’s ‘auto-
tagging’ tool automatically finds the
album metadata and artwork.
MusicBee’s default codec is FLAC
(the fastest and most popular lossless
audio format), which should appeal to
those who want to listen to music at
the highest quality. It also works with
high-end sound cards and offers a
built-in equaliser, volume normalisation
and gapless playback for the very best
listening experience.
As well as letting you create and
manage your own playlists, MusicBee
supports internet radio, podcasts and
audiobooks, so you’ll always find
something to listen to. You can switch
between these different modes using its
simple tabbed interface, which can be
customised and rearranged
according to your tastes.
At times when you want a tool that
doesn’t take up your whole screen,
MusicBee offers Mini and Compact
players, both of which can be assigned
hotkeys of your choice. There’s also
a good variety of skins to choose from.
We particularly like the way
MusicBee displays images of the artists
in its Now Playing area (along with
biographies and song lyrics), and its
Music Explorer, which lets you preview
tracks from Microsoft Groove (formerly
Xbox Music).
MusicBee also supports syncing
to Android and Windows Phone.
How it can be improved:
We found very little to fault with
MusicBee, but its tabbed interface could
be a little more intuitive on first use.
Also, if you want to rip CDs as MP3s,
you need to install an add-on.
OUR VERDICT
MusicBee offers everything you
could want from a music player.
It’s fast, easy to use and can be
customised according to your
tastes. Free software doesn’t get
much better than this.
If you don’t want to pay
for Spotify, there are
still plenty of excellent
free programs you can
use to rip and play CDs,
and manage your MP3s.

Discuss music players at forum.webuser.co.uk
What we liked:
MediaMonkey boasts
many of the same
features that make
MusicBee great, including
excellent library-
management tools and
support for podcasts and
internet radio. What separates it from
its competitors is that you can use it to
share your entire music library over your
network (to DNLA and UPnP clients)
without installing any additional plugins.
Opting to install it as a ‘service’ also
makes the media server accessible when
you’re not logged into your Windows
account and MediaMonkey isn’t running.
Other standout features include the
option to sync your library to Android
devices via Wi-Fi (although you’ll need
to pay £2.89 for MediaMonkey Pro
to do this) and support for syncing to
iOS devices, provided you already have
iTunes installed. We also like its Folder
Monitoring feature, which continuously
scans specific folders so your music
library is always up to date.
Like our Gold Award winner, you can
choose from a number of different skins
What we liked:
If you’re looking for a
simple music manager
without a load of menus
and tools that you’ll never
use, AIMP is an excellent
choice. You can quickly open
files from its main menu or opt to
add them permanently to your library
by clicking the ‘+’ symbol and choosing
the relevant folders. Like MediaMonkey,
you can also set it to monitor these
folders for changes so that your library
is always up to date.
The program’s DSP Manager provides
an equalizer, volume normalisation and
mixing options to help you achieve a
seamless listening experience. AIMP
also comes with an Audio Converter
that lets you rip tracks using a number
of different codecs, as well as a Tag
Editor for automatically changing your
files’ metadata
There’s a range of plugins that let you
add extra tools and you can also choose
from a number of different skins to
change how the player looks. We
particularly like AIMP’s Mini Player,
which sits above the taskbar when you
minimise the program, and its handy
alarm clock and sleep functions.
How it can be improved:
AIMP has a refreshingly simple interface
but it could still be easier to use. The
lack of tools for podcast and audiobook
playback is also frustrating.
and there are also handy Mini and Micro
player interfaces.
How it can be improved:
You need MediaMonkey Gold (a lifetime
licence costs £52.97) to unlock certain
features including automatic tagging
and file organisation, and MP3
encoding. Elements of the program’s
interface are also a little cluttered and
more fiddly than MusicBee.
OUR VERDICT
MediaMonkey withholds some of its
best features for the paid-for version
but it’s still a very impressive music
player, especially because
it doubles as a media server.
OUR VERDICT
AIMP covers all the important bases,
but we’d struggle to recommend
it over our other award winners
unless you’re particularly drawn
to its slimmed-down interface.
Foobar2000
www.foobar2000.org
Foobar2000 is a fast music player
that provides a vast range of
customisation options, but most
users will find its modular design
too much hard work because you
need to install add-ons to use even
some basic tools. However, if you’re
prepared to persevere, you can
transform Foobar2000 into the
music player of your dreams.
Clementine
clementine-player.org
Clementine’s simple interface makes
it easy to use from the word go.
Like our Gold and Silver award
winners, it has an impressive range
of tools, including strong library
management and internet radio
support. There’s also an Android
app you can use to remotely control
the player and download songs to
your phone. Unfortunately, we found
the program too buggy and the
design doesn’t look anywhere near
as attractive as our award winners.
iTunes
www.apple.com/uk/itunes
Apple’s iTunes gets a lot of stick for
being slow and bloated, and after
testing it again, we have to agree
with its critics. We love the Library
section, which has a simple design
and performs well, but its Radio and
Store sections were so slow and
buggy, even on a new laptop, that
they were barely functional.

vernote (evernote.com) has been
through a lot of changes since its
debut in 2008. The note-taking tool
is available for use online and through
software for Windows, Mac, Android,
iOS, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry and
other platforms. Now, the iOS version
has been completely redesigned to
make capturing ideas even easier and
to reduce the amount of time you need
to spend organising and searching
for saved items. The new version is
currently only available for iPhone, iPad
and iPod Touch, but this is reported
to be the first step in a major overhaul
for Evernote and a sign of how the
service will look across all versions
and devices in the coming months.

Stop hackers and snoopers
spying on your files
2
Before you start encrypting, you need to create a key.
Hyper Crypt can do this for you – click Other Tools, then
Key Generator. 1 For a standard key, choose a ‘Key
length’ by typing it into the box. 2 Eight characters is the
minimum length but 16 is better. Click the Generate button, 3
then Copy. 4
1
Go to bit.ly/hyper418 and click the Downloads link. 1
If you’re running Windows 10, click the ‘Get it on Windows
10’ button 2 to download the app from the Store. If you’re
running an earlier version of Windows, download the ZIP file 3
and run the portable version by copying it from the ZIP.
3
Close the Key Generator and click Encryption Options. 1
Paste the key you created into the ‘Enter key here’ box. 2
The key’s strength is shown as a percentage. 3 You can
use any string of text as a key but randomly generated ones are
more secure. Note that keys aren’t saved when the software
is closed, so make a note of any you want to use.
4
With its default settings, the software will create a new,
encrypted version of the file. This is useful if you’re going
to send it to someone and want it secured while it’s in
transit. If you want to make sure the file is completely secure
on your own PC, selecting the ‘Overwrite original file’ box 1
will replace the original with the encrypted version.
I
t’s wise to hide private data, such as bank details
and personal journals, but encrypting it is even
safer because it makes the information virtually
impossible to read, even if a determined snoop
gains access. Encryption uses a ‘key’ – a string of
random characters – to mathematically scramble
data, which can only be unscrambled (decrypted)
by the same key. Hyper Crypt is a great new tool
designed to simplify the process.
Remember – once you’ve used the software to lock
your files, you need the key to unlock them again,
so make sure you’re comfortable with the balance
between your desire for privacy and the potential for
rendering your files unreadable if you lose that key.

Andy Shaw says
If you’re encrypting something to send
to someone, use asymmetric encryption
to make a pair of keys: one public and
one private. The recipient sends you a
public key to encrypt the data, which
can only be decrypted with their private
key. Asymmetric keys are longer than
the data they encrypt, so are best
suited to short text items, such as
passwords. You can set up Asymmetric
Encryption from the Key Generator.

5
When you’re ready to encrypt a file, click the File
Encryption tab, 1 then click the Encrypt File button. 2
A standard Open window appears, in which you can
browse for your file. Click Open and the software will encrypt it.
When it’s finished, the folder that held the original file will have
a file with the same name but with ‘_Enc’ appended.
6
To reverse the process, click the Decrypt File button 1
and select the file you want to decrypt from the folder.
A second file will be created, this time with ‘_Dec’
appended to its filename. 2 Instead of clicking the buttons and
choosing files, you can also drag and drop files from Explorer
to either of these buttons.
7
You can perform the same encryption and decryption with
entire folders. Click the Encrypt Folder button 1 or drag
a folder to the button to encrypt it. To reverse the process,
do the same using the Decrypt Folder button. 2 This will
encrypt and decrypt entire folders and their contents, including
subfolders.
8
To encrypt a message or some text, click the Other Tools
tab and select Phrase Crypt. Click Encryption Options 1
and enter a key as you would with File or Folder
encryption. Go to Text Encryption, 2 paste the text you want to
encrypt in the Plain Text box 3 and press Encrypt. 4 To reverse
the process, paste into Encrypted Text and press Decrypt. 5
10
The Hyper Hash button, in Other Tools, lets you
create a unique code from a particular file or piece of
text. You can then use this code to verify whether
a file has been tampered with. Under File Hashing, 1 choose
a file and a hash will be computed. 2 Compare this with a file 3
or hash. 4 If they match, the file has not been changed.
9
To double your security, create an HCV (Hyper Crypt
Variable) file. Click Other Tools, 1 Key Generator, 2
then the HCV tab. 3 Click Generate 4 and choose where
to save the .hcv file. To use it during encryption, click the
‘Use HCV file’ option in the Encryption Options tab. Both the
HCV file and the key will be required to unlock the encryption.

To stop HTML5 videos playing automatically in Firefox,
type about:config into the address bar, press Enter,
then click ‘I accept the risk!’. Use the search box 1 to find
‘media.autoplay.enabled’, 2 then double-click it to set it as
false. 3 HTML5 videos will no longer start automatically.
2
To do the same in Chrome, you need to install an
add-on, such as Disable HTML5 Autoplay (bit.ly/html418).
Once installed, the extension is enabled by default but
you can disable it temporarily from chrome://extensions, should
you need to. 1
3
Chrome asks you for permission to use Flash, but you
can improve your security by blocking it. In the advanced
settings, under Privacy, click ‘Content settings...’. Scroll
down to Flash 1 and click ‘Block sites from running Flash’. 2
Click ‘Manage exceptions’ 3 to allow Flash on specific sites. 4
To set Firefox to ask for permission before playing
Flash content, click the menu button and choose Add-ons,
then Plugins. Find Shockwave Flash 1 and choose ‘Ask to
Activate’ 2 from its menu. Click Options 3 and make sure the
box next to ‘Enable Adobe Flash protected mode’ is ticked.
5
To block annoying animated GIFs completely in
Firefox, try the ESCapeFromThemGIFs add-on (bit.ly/
esc418). 1 Once you’ve installed this handy extension,
you can toggle it on and off (enabling or disabling all GIFs)
simply by pressing the Esc key.
6
Google’s Animation Policy addon for Chrome (bit.ly/
animation418) lets you set animations to play just once
or not at all. After installing it, click the lightning-bolt icon
next to the address bar 1 and choose the option you want.
You may need to refresh the page for this to take effect.
Block annoying videos and animated GIFs
V
ideos that suddenly start playing when you open a web
page can be irritating, distracting and unexpectedly
loud. In this Workshop, we show you how to stop videos
and animated GIFs playing automatically by using add-ons and

to manage our email. Email programs still have their
advantages, though, especially if you have several

Get to grips with some serious PC DIY to boost
your computer’s performance

£10 and £20 (check the listing carefully
to make sure the device is in good
working order before buying it).
How to...
Rescue your videos from
old, obsolete file formats
Wayne Williams digs out his VHS and camcorder footage and shows
you how to digitise your old home movies while you still can
Copying from VHS
If you have a video recorder to play your
tapes on, then digitising the contents
is actually very straightforward. If you
don’t, find out if a friend or family
member has a VHS recorder you can
use. Otherwise, you should be able
to pick one up on eBay for between
T
echnology moves at such a pace these days that
media stored in a once common format may now be
difficult to access. A lot of people have treasured
memories stored on VHS (or old camcorder tapes) with
no way of watching them, and some newer PCs don’t
come with optical drives, which makes viewing or
copying videos on CDs and DVDs much harder. Not so
long ago, digital video would have been stored in
formats such as AVI or WMV, but they have been
superseded by better, more modern formats, such as
MP4 and MKV.
While you can pay someone to recover old video for
you – transferring analogue video on tape to digital files,
for example – it’s easy enough to perform the task
yourself, and you’ll have the added benefit of being able
to tweak and improve the quality of the finished result.
Electrovid (www.electrovid.co.uk)
also offers a selection of refurbished
VHS players and recorders.

A DVD recorder lets you easily record
VHS content directly to DVD

Weekend Project
8 - 21 March 2017 59

If you are willing to spend a little
more money, you could buy a
standalone DVD recorder, which will
have a line-in connection; or a
combination DVD recorder and VHS,
which lets you record the contents
of a tape directly to a disc.
If you opt for a regular VHS player,
you’ll need a hardware-capture
device to digitise the analogue video
ready for viewing, editing and
converting on your PC or Mac. There
are lots of different capture devices
to choose from, but the most
common ones are dongles which
have composite RCA and S-Video
cables at one end and a USB plug
at the other – expect to pay
somewhere between £10 and £30.
The quality of your results will
depend on a host of factors. VHS
has a low resolution, equivalent to
335 x 576 pixels, and the quality of
the original recording, the capture
hardware, and the capture software
will all play a big part in how the
digitised video looks. The more
times a tape has been played, the
worse the quality will get over time.
Also, always work from an original
copy because each successive
version (copies of copies) will be
poorer than
the previous
one due to
“generational
decay.”
The capture
process will
differ depending
on the software
that you receive
with the device,
but it usually
involves starting
the video
playing, then
clicking the
record button
when the scene you want appears
in the preview window.
You don’t have to stick with the
supplied software because there are
free programs that should work just
as well, if not better, with your
device. We recommend VideoPad
Video Editor (bit.ly/vpve418).
Another interesting option is the
DigitNow Video Grabber Box, which
does away with the need for a PC.
You connect your VHS player or
camcorder directly to the device,
then start a tape playing. The video
will be shown on the device’s built-in
LCD screen and you can start
recording any time. The digitised
footage is saved directly to the
supplied 4GB memory card (you can
switch to a larger card if you prefer).
At £89.99 on Amazon (bit.ly/
digit418), it is a lot more expensive
than other capture solutions, but it’s
a good choice if your priorities are
simplicity and portability.
Copying from a camcorder
The process of digitising video from
a camcorder that uses tapes (such
as Hi-8) is much the same as for
VHS. You will need a camcorder that
plays the tapes, a hardware capture
You can digitise analogue
video using a USB video-
capture device
VideoPad lets you capture and edit old video footage
MINI WORKSHOP
Transfer video to a PC using
a DVD recorder
1
The Recorder should have a ‘Line in’
or ‘Decoder’ port, which will probably be
a SCART socket. 1 If possible, use the cables
and connectors that came with your camera
2 because we found our camcorder didn’t
get on with generic cables. Connect the
AV port on the camera to the DVD recoder.
2
Turn on the TV, DVD and camcorder, then
set the TV to the DVD’s input so you can
see it on the screen. Start the camcorder
playing and select the correct source on the
DVD (ours was ‘Line 1’) to see what you’re
recording. 1 When your camcorder footage
is at the right point, start recording on your
DVD, then set the camcorder playing.
3
Once you’ve finished recording, finalise
the disc by choosing the option from the
DVD player’s menu. 1 This will ensure that it
can be played in any player. You can then
transfer this to your PC using HandBrake.
Click the Source button and choose your DVD
drive, then set the software up by following
our Mini Workshop on page 61.

Open HandBrake, then drag and
drop a video to the program
window. Choose a save destination for
the converted file. 1 By default, you
can choose between MP4 and MKV as
the video container. 2 There’s also
a long list of video presets available
to browse. 3
2
The preset video profiles include
general, web-optimised and device-
specific (Fire TV, Android, Chromecast
and so on). There are also options for
Matroska (MKV) and legacy devices.
Make any required changes to the
picture including adjusting the width and
height, 1 and cropping. 2 In most cases,
it’s wisest to leave things as they are.

the conversion process.
MINI WORKSHOP | Convert old videos into a digital format using HandBrake
device, and the relevant cables.
If you have a DV camcorder, this will
connect directly to your PC via USB or
IEEE 1394 FireWire. If your computer
doesn’t have a FireWire port – and, if it’s
new, there’s a good chance it won’t –
you can pick up a card (and cable, if
required) on Amazon for around £20.
Copying from CD and DVD
There’s been some concern about
optical media regarding ‘disc rot’ –
the physical degradation of CDs and,
to a lesser degree, DVDs, which can
prevent them from being read – but this
is often overstated and shouldn’t worry
you. Provided the discs are of a decent
quality and have been handled with care,
they should play for many, many years.
However, it doesn’t hurt to make
a backup copy of the video on your
discs for safety purposes. You can write
the video to a new disc, store it on
a hard drive or upload it to the cloud
or YouTube.
If your PC or Mac has a CD/DVD drive,
you can copy the files from the disc
to your hard drive. If it’s a video DVD,
then you can use free software such
as HandBrake (handbrake.fr) to rip
the contents.
Choosing a new video format
You’re probably familiar with video
formats such as AVI and MKV, but you
may not appreciate that these are simply
‘containers’. The key thing to know is that
the video itself is compressed using
‘codecs’. There are a lot of codecs to
choose from, but we would recommend
either H.264 (which offers great quality)
or MPEG-4 (for faster compression).
Similarly, there are many containers
to choose from. Ideally, you should go
for Matroska (with the MKV extension)
or MP4. While MKV is an excellent format
that supports most codecs and offers
a lot of features, it’s not as popular as
MP4, so not every media player will be
able to handle it.

TV shows and movies it thinks you’ll
like based on your interests and
viewing history. But if your partner or
kids also use Netflix, their viewing
history will skew the results, so you

them. Luckily, there are several websites
that provide links to them.
Visit bit.ly/genre418 and you’ll see a list
containing dozens of categories. Click the
link at the top to view the extended list,
which contains many more. Not every link
works because Netflix sometimes deletes
categories, but many still function and
contain fascinating movies you might
otherwise miss. You’ll find an alternative

Use the Add button to add a new profile
for each member of the household.
It’s important that each person
switches to their profile when they start
the app or visit the website, so the items
they view are added to their profile and
not yours.
Avoid extra charges on
Amazon
Some Amazon TV shows and movies
aren’t included in Prime Video and have
to be bought. To avoid accidentally
buying something instead of watching
it as part of your subscription, go to
Prime Video on the website, click
Settings and turn on Purchase
Restrictions. Create a PIN or enter the
one you use for parental controls.
Stop Auto Play
When one episode of a TV series ends,
the next one starts automatically. This
can be irritating, unless you’re planning
to binge watch the whole series,
because if you forget to press stop, the
series plays to the end and flags all the
episodes as watched, even if you just
fell asleep or went to bed. Go to
Settings in the Amazon app, press Auto
Play and turn it off. On the Netflix
website, go to My Account, ‘Playback
settings’ and remove the tick.
Are you still there?
If you binge watch Netflix all day, you
might see a message asking if you’re
still there or awake. A Chrome extension
called Flix Assist (bit.ly/flix418) can stop
this, but it doesn’t work for everyone.
Create a watch list
When browsing for something to watch,
you can save any interesting items you
come across and continue browsing.
To do this on Amazon, click the button
below Watch Now. Use the Watch List
button at the bottom of the screen in
the app or go to Prime Video on the
Amazon website and click Your
Watchlist.
On Netflix, the MyList button under
each movie does the same thing. Press it
to save an item and continue browsing.
Your MyList selections appear at the top
of the home screen. On the website,
click the Browse link and select MyList.
Netflix interface experiments. Go to
your account page, click ‘Test
participation’ and turn it off.
When video is streaming, a set of
Super Netflix icons appears on the
right. Right-click the video to view
technical information including the
frame rate, frames dropped, the bit
rate and other data. The Fast-forward
and Rewind buttons jump a little at
a time, making it easier to skip
forward and back. The TV icon cycles
through different image modes,
such as black and white, bright and
darker, and more.
Click the gear icon and a window
appears containing different audio
and video bit rates. If your internet
connection is poor, selecting lower bit
rates will smooth out playback and
prevent buffering.
Sign out remotely
You can access your Netflix account
on more than one device, which
means you may have enabled it on
devices you no longer use or that
belong to other people. Go to Your
Account and click ‘Sign out of all
devices’. Now, anyone who tries to use
your Netflix account will need to log
in, which they won’t be able to do
without your username and password.
Watch movies offline
If you’re going on holiday or
somewhere that doesn’t have Wi-Fi,
you can download films and
TV programmes to watch later
on your phone or tablet.
In Netflix, select a movie
or TV show and look for the
Download button under the
image. Before you do that,
however, open the menu,
select App Settings and
choose a suitable video quality
for your downloads. Standard
uses less storage space, which
means you can download
more titles.
Amazon users have a button
under Watch Now. First, go to
Settings, Streaming &
Downloading, Download
Quality and select Best, Better or
Good. Again, this will affect the
viewing quality and how much
storage space you need. Video at
Good quality uses around 0.3GB an
hour, while Best uses 0.9GB.
Clear your Netflix history
Netflix tracks the content you watch
and saves it in your profile. If you’ve
been indulging in too many guilty
pleasures and are embarrassed by
what’s displayed in your profile, go to
your account page on the website and
click ‘Viewing activity’. Click the cross
next to any items you want to remove.
Alternatively, you can create a new
profile and use that instead. You can’t
delete your own profile but you can
delete any you’ve added, along with
their data.
Set the video quality
Go to your Netflix account on the
website and click ‘Playback settings’.
Here, you’ll find Auto, Low, Medium
and High settings. Auto sets the video
quality and data rate automatically,
but if you need to limit the amount of
data used, choose the Low setting. If
you have unlimited fibre broadband
and a 4K TV, choose High. An hour of
video at the High setting uses up to
7GB of data, but it’s the best quality.
Amazon Prime Video’s quality is set
to Good by default, but its Better and
Best settings offer improvements. Use
the Good setting if you have a slow
internet connection or limited data
– when watching on a phone using
mobile data, for example. Tap
Settings, Streaming & Downloading,
Streaming Quality. Choose Best if you
have fast, unlimited broadband.

EMAIL
Email web pages
Q
For years, I’ve used the ‘Send Page
by Email’ tool in Internet Explorer 11
as a convenient way of creating a
monthly newsletter for a village website,
which I email to more than 200 people.
With the web page open, selecting the
option would bring up the message:
“A Web site wants to open web content
using this program on your computer”.
Since the Anniversary Update, this is
broken and I just see “Program: Microsoft
Windows. Publisher: Microsoft
Corporation. Effects Outlook Email in
both Office 2007 and Office 2016.”
I sometimes use the Edge browser but
I still find Internet Explorer 11 fast and
easy to use, as long as no add-ons or
extra toolbars are present and only one
search provider is active. As an added
benefit, Internet Explorer 11 can display
two or more web pages side by side.
I’m a full believer in moving forward
with technology, but in this case I’m
having to resort to an old Windows 7 PC.
David Eversden, via email
A
When we tried a few websites
in Internet Explorer 11, the ‘Send
page by email’ menu was disabled.
This feature may no longer work,
but Windows 10 provides a new
way of doing a similar thing.
Microsoft Edge doesn’t offer the
option to send a web page by email, but
you can share it instead. This works well
and is easy to do. It uses the Mail app
(which we have a workshop on – see
page 57) so if you haven’t done so
already, set it up by adding your email
account to it. Then go to a website in
Edge and click the Share button in the
toolbar. A panel opens on the right of
the screen with sharing options. Select
Mail, and an email is created with the
page title, image and link. You can
customise this by adding your own
headings and text. Then fill in the To box
and send the email.
It’s not a good idea to send one email
to 200 people, because your internet
provider and other email servers may
blacklist you as a spammer. Instead, use
a legitimate email marketing tool.
MailChimp (mailchimp.com) is one of
many but it lets you email up to 2,000
people with a total of 12,000 emails a
month for free. Once you get used to it,
you’ll find it quick and easy to use.
Edge can also display two or more
pages side by side. Open two tabs, then
click and drag one out and into its own
window. Position and resize them.
MEDIA
Change Kodi’s media player
Q
I am trying to replace Kodi’s default
media player with my all-time
favourite, VLC media player (www
.videolan.org), which is the most reliable
and versatile player I have ever used. It’s
incredibly advanced for a free program,
and I find its picture sharpener and
aspect ratio setting extremely useful
when I’m watching a low-quality video
file, because it lets me improve the size
and crispness of the file being played.
I’ve looked for instructions for this
online, but most how-to guides aren’t
detailed enough to help. I find your
magazine very helpful in lots of other
computer-related matters, so I wonder
if you could take me through the process
step by step.

Q
Is the Post Office’s free internet
security software effective
enough to protect my PC, or would
you advise me to purchase something
like Kaspersky or McAfee instead?
Jagtar Singh, via email
A
The free security software
provided with Post Office’s
broadband internet service (bit
.ly/po418) appears to be supplied
by Fujitsu Internet Security. Fujitsu
doesn’t make its own security
software, so this is a rebadged
version of another company’s
product. A quick search for the files
online indicates that the security
element is provided by Bitdefender
(www.bitdefender.co.uk).
Bitdefender is one of the best-
performing antivirus programs
available, so it should offer good
security, provided it’s up to date.
However, paid-for security software
often has more features than free
software and tends to include extra
tools such as a password manager, file
encryption, secure file erasing, identity
protection, a firewall and so on.
Kaspersky Internet Security 2017
(bit.ly/kaspersky2017) is an excellent
choice if you decide to buy software,
but McAfee didn’t perform as well in
recent tests run by AV-Test (www.av-

ONLINE STORAGE
Using web space as storage
Q
Many web-hosting options offer
unlimited storage for a relatively low
monthly fee. If I were to put up a basic
one-page website, could I then use the
unlimited storage to store my own files?
It would be like having my own personal
online drive.
J Evans, via email
A
Yes, this is possible, but there are
limitations. OneDrive, Google Drive,
Dropbox and other dedicated online-
storage services provide a folder on
your PC’s hard drive that acts like any
other folder on your PC and
Notepad. Set the player name in the
third line to VLC.
The fourth line contains the path to
the media player you want to use.
Delete everything between <filename>
and </filename>, then enter the path to
VLC on your PC. The line will then look
something like this:
<filename>C:\Program Files
(x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe
</filename>
Change the line that’s third from the
end to tell Kodi which file types VLC
player should play. You can add more
file types, but this should be sufficient:
<rule filetypes=”mkv|mp4|avi”
player=”VLC”/>
Now you just have to save this file in
the right place. Press Windows+R and
type %appdata%\kodi\userdata.
Explorer opens and displays a folder.
Save the Notepad file to this folder with
the name ‘playercorefactory.xml’. Start
Kodi and it will use VLC.

Protect your router from
Wi-Fi hacks
Q
I used to leave my Wi-Fi on all the
time, but I read an article in the Daily
Mail saying that Wi-Fi passwords can be
hacked easily if someone sets up their
PC as a hotspot with the same name.
Now I switch mine off when I’m not
using it, even though most of my friends
and relatives keep theirs switched on.
How can I make my router safer so
I can keep it switched on for my phone,
laptop, iPad and TV streaming?
Peter Day, via email
A
It’s easy to set up a laptop or phone
as a Wi-Fi hotspot. If someone were
to do this in a public place such as a
café, others might think it was the café’s
free Wi-Fi and connect to it, allowing
that person to spy on their web use.
If you have an evil next-door
neighbour, they could give their Wi-Fi
network the same name as yours so that
your devices connect to it by mistake,
although this isn’t particularly likely.
Another way to spy on your internet
activities is to hack the router. If you
suspect someone has done this, you
should change the router’s password,
especially if you haven’t done so before.
Press Windows+R, type cmd and
press Enter. Type ipconfig, press Enter
and look for the Default Gateway. Type
the IP address (which should look
something like 192.168.1.254), and the
router’s homepage will appear. Log in,
find the router’s password setting and

I have 500 fonts on my PC. I use
around 15 of them regularly but
I have to scroll through them all to

10 loads only those I use regularly, but
the others are still available if needed?
Jim Mellor, via email
A
You can’t have two lists of fonts,
but there are other options. Open
the Control Panel and click Fonts to
see a list of fonts on your PC. Double-
click a font to see some example text
showing what it looks like.
When you find a font you don’t
want, click to select it and click the
Hide link in the menu bar at the top.
Most programs don’t show hidden
fonts, so this is a useful way to reduce
the number on display. You can click
to show them again if you need them.
You can also delete fonts from here,
but you should only do this for fonts
you know you’ll never use and that
aren’t needed by Windows or other
programs for menus, links and so on.
Clear out
unnecessary fonts
GENERAL PC
Fonts can be hidden or deleted from
the Control Panel
automatically syncs with your online
storage. They also provide easy-to-use
web interfaces, mobile apps and so on.
Access to a website’s online storage is
often limited to a File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) program, which is a tool for
uploading and downloading files. These
are clunky and inconvenient for files
that need to be accessed frequently.
Files stored on a website are publicly
accessible, too, so you’d need to
encrypt them before uploading them.
Many services described as unlimited
aren’t actually unlimited and have terms
and conditions that prevent excessive
use. They may even expressly forbid
using the service as an online drive. It’s
an interesting idea, but it’s not practical.

Sorry, the tip you mention is for

Make your laptop battery last
longer
Here’s a quick tip for owners of Windows
10 laptops that will make their batteries
last longer. Open the Settings app, click
System and select Battery. If the Battery
saver isn’t enabled, tick the box. Battery
Saver switches on automatically when
the laptop’s battery level drops to around
20%, but if you drag the slider to
somewhere around 50%, it will kick in
sooner and save even more power.

Receive news by email
If you haven’t tried Google Alerts yet, go
to www.google.com/alerts and check it
out – I find it really useful. Enter a topic
and you’ll receive a list of relevant news
stories by email every day. For example,
you can enter your home town, a football
team, your favourite music and so on.
When you type a word or phrase,
a preview of a news story appears. If you
like what you see, click Create Alert. The
‘Show options’ link is useful and the ‘How
often’ option lets you choose between
‘As it happens’, ‘At most once a day’ and
‘At most once a week’. It saves you
having to browse multiple websites for
interesting news stories, because they all
appear as an email in your inbox.

Remove spammers from your
inbox
I’ve often heard that you shouldn’t
respond to junk emails or click anything
in them because it tells the spammer you
exist and that you’re reading the emails,
which encourages them to send more. In
my experience this isn’t completely true.
There are two types of spammer:
responsible ones who put unsubscribe
links in their emails and those who don’t.
These are the worst kind. If junk mail has
an unsubscribe link, my advice is to click
it, because it almost always works.
If you use Outlook.com for email, you’ll
see a link to unsubscribe at the top of
the message just under the title. Outlook
puts it there. I click both the unsubscribe
link in the email and Outlook’s link.
If there is no unsubscribe link, there’s
not much you can do except select the
message and click Junk in Outlook.

TOP TIP
Spotify recently added a new feature that
automatically plays similar songs once your
chosen album, playlist or collection has
finished. While some users might like this,
I find it frustrating because I can’t necessarily
tell when my original selection has ended, and
it can consume excessive amounts of mobile
data. Luckily, it can be turned off.
In Spotify’s Android app, tap Your Library
and select the Settings cog. Scroll down
the page until you see an option called
AutoPlay. Switch this off and tracks will
no longer play when the music you’ve
chosen ends. In the iOS app, you’ll find the
same option in the Playback sub-menu.
To disable it in the Desktop version of

Save your phone’s battery
with black wallpaper
Some mobile phone screens are made
with light-emitting diodes (LEDs). When
you pass a current through them, they
glow in different colours to produce an
image. The thing is, when no current is
flowing, the LEDs are black. So if you set
your home screen background to black,
it reduces power consumption and your
battery lasts longer.
You’ll still have icons and widgets on
the screen, but having 50% of the screen
black will preserve battery power. Find
a black wallpaper to download or take a
photo with the lens covered and use that.

My other half recently fired up an old
Nexus 7 tablet that had been gathering
dust on the shelf, but it was so long
since she’d used it that she’d forgotten
her pass pattern and couldn’t get past
the lock screen. As Edward Munn
mentioned in ‘Undo your mobile
mistakes’, Issue 416, after several
incorrect attempts, the tablet gives
you the option to log in with a Google

router since we’d last used the device,
so the tablet wouldn’t connect to the
internet to let us log in.
Once we’d resigned ourselves to
wiping the device to regain access,
I tried booting into Recovery Mode,
but even this wouldn’t work.
I was close to giving up when
I suddenly thought it might be possible
to use the ‘Mobile hotspot’ feature on
my Samsung S6 to imitate our old
router, thereby giving the tablet the
internet connection it required. I used

connection active, we could log into

Having come so close to throwing the
device away, it was hugely satisfying to
give it another lease of life.

MicroKid, Web User Forums

Having searched Google for OSIRIS

victim to the Locky Ransomware virus.
Ransomware need not be a disaster,
provided you have created a backup to
an external drive that is not normally
connected to your computer, or if
you have backups of your important
documents and photos. If you have
made a backup, make sure you boot
up with a system repair disk (see bit
.ly/repair418 for more info), so you
are outside Windows when you
restore the image. Restoring a
backup should not only restore your
files but also remove the ransomware.
Unfortunately, if you don’t have
a backup, you may have lost the
encrypted files forever, but you
should follow the tips at bit.ly/osiris418
to remove the virus and attempt to
recover the files with free file-recovery
software such as Recuva (www.piriform

Avoid opening emails from unknown

Don’t fall for BT Call Protect
scam
After reading your news story in Issue
415, I signed up to BT’s Call Protect
nuisance-call blocker (www.bt.com/
callprotect). This morning I received
a call from an Asian lady who asked if
I’d had any more nuisance calls, to which
I said no. She claimed to be from BT and
wanted to conﬁrm my card details.
I used to work in a bank so I know not
to give this information over the phone,
but she said she already had my card
details and just wanted to check that
they were up to date. She said that my
card number began with a ‘4’ but when I
asked her for the rest of the numbers,
she changed the subject.
The woman said that there was a
charge for BT Call Protect and asked for
my details so that BT could debit my
account. I told her that if there was a
charge then I didn’t want the service,
to which she replied that in that case
I would continue to get nuisance calls.
I said that was ﬁne and said goodbye.
I have since contacted BT, which said
that the call wasn’t from them. I asked
them how someone found out so quickly
that I had signed up to this service, and
why Call Protect allowed this call to get
though to me. Also, I dialled 1471 to ﬁnd
out where this call had come from –
it was an 003030 number.
I do hope you pass on this information
to your readers because I am sure that
there are vulnerable people out there
who will give their card details.

A
bout four weeks ago,
I was taken very ill.
I will not be crude, but
suffice to say I had bad back
pain and was very sick. I was
taken into hospital and put
in an unsuitable ward full of
bedridden people, some of
whom kept waking me up in
the night. No sleep for a week.
Eventually, I was allowed to
go home and, despite my
weakness, I had to manage
my own care. On the internet,
I ordered special ready meals
and groceries for two weeks, spending
over £150 on food.
I then realised I did not have enough
room in my freezer. On the Saturday
morning, I called a well-known
appliance store at 9am and ordered
The internet is a life-saver for me
a chest freezer and a larder fridge for
£432. My bank card did not work, even
though it had the day before, so I tried
my credit card, which did work. I called
my bank, which said it had put a
restriction on my card because of the
amount spent. I said: “You are
killing me because
I need to rely on my card”.
The bank did take the
restriction off, but I was very
worried as I cannot get out
or drive at the moment.
The ability to use the
internet and order the things
I need such as light pyjamas
and a dressing gown made
all the difference.
I am 71. I did not see a
computer until I was 44. It is
a life-saver for me now, and
any old people who can take
advantage of it should do. I am on the
mend because being able to use the
internet has taken a load off my mind
and I can get everything I need online.

In praise of Opera Neon
Thank you for the article about Opera
Neon in Issue 416 in your Best New
Browser Tools section, and the workshop
in issue 417. I’d already decided to try this
browser, so your information has been
very welcome and useful.
All the same, I don’t
think I’ll be using
Opera Neon much

Yes, you can duplicate tabs
in Firefox!
I am very puzzled. Your Best New
Browser Tools section in Issue 416
laments the “shameful situation” that
Firefox has no means to duplicate tabs.
I have been using Tab Mix Plus (bit.ly/
tabmix418) for many years, which gives
me this option. Simply right-click the tab
and you’ll see Duplicate Tab with the
alternative keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T
shown as well. I would have thought this
add-on is essential for anyone serious
about using tabs in Firefox. It gives you
exceptional control over them.
Even without Tab Mix Plus, I believe
your assertion is still wrong because
Mozilla offers the following options
to duplicate tabs: press Ctrl and click or
middle-click the Reload button to open
the current page in a new tab. Press Ctrl
and click or middle-click items in the
history of the Back and Forward buttons
to open a page from that list in a new
tab. You can duplicate a tab with its
history by pressing Ctrl and dragging
the tab to a new position on the tab bar.

Walter Tull, who was the ﬁrst black

Retro gaming request
In Issue 416, I read an item on page 27
about a piece of software called Image to
ZX Sec 2, which can be used to produce
a ZX Spectrum-style slant on any image.
It got me wondering whether something
existed that could do the opposite?
Not long ago, I used an Atari ST
emulator to play The Pawn – one of a
series of adventure games produced by
Magnetic Scrolls back in the Eighties. It
was one of the ﬁrst games available for
those early 16-bit computers and the
graphics accompanying the game were
beautifully cutting-edge at the time.
However, more than 30 years later, the
images that once took my breath away
now look very basic. Does anyone know
of a free piece of software that can bring
the wow factor back to early graphics?

Contactless cards lack

Regarding your

I have one thing to

Why not to upgrade PHP
In Build a Better Site in Issue 417, your
advice is to upgrade to PHP v7, but this
could lead to problems for some users.
One of the changes between PHP v5
and v7 (there was no v6) is that the way
PHP connects to databases has been
removed. MySQL directives must be
replaced by MySQLi or PDO code in PHP
programs. There’s a lot of old code out
there that still uses the MySQL code
no longer supported in PHP 7. The
replacement involves rather more than
just ﬁnding any MySQL directives and
replacing them with MySQLi or PDO.
There are good reasons (including
security improvements) to rewrite the
PHP programs to use MySQLi or PDO,
but it can be expensive. A well-known
hosting company I’d been using
announced a monthly £5.30 surcharge
for providing ongoing PHP5 support,
just two months after PHP7 was released.
If you don’t have a problem with
MySQL code then you should certainly
upgrade to PHP 7 because it introduces
new functionality that some new
programs may need.

Electricity costs money but the
amount each customer would use
would be well under one penny.

Minecraft and therefore spend
an unhealthy
amount of my time
searching for free
Minecraft goodies
for kids to

with adverts like
the one above, as well as ads promoting
gambling sites, and they are littered
with big Download buttons that could
easily fool a child into thinking they’re
downloading a Minecraft game, when
in fact they’re getting an insidious,
impossible-to-remove piece of adware.

strange pop-ups and toolbars, a tenner

The sites offer the excuse that you’re
getting their
downloads for free
and they have to
pay to maintain the
site somehow, but
that excuse doesn’t
butter my parsnips.
If your business
model relies on conning your own
customers, you need to rethink your
business.
And while there are so many of these
adverts out there that any attempt by
the authorities to quash individual ads
would become the world’s largest game
of whack-a-mole (hit one and five
others pop their heads above the
surface), they should be
targeting the dealers. None
of the websites in question
has an individual
relationship with these
fake-ad suppliers – they’re
all bought through widely
used networks such as
Adf.ly (which runs the Brit
Method ads). I tried to
contact Adf.ly to find out
what it had to say for itself,
but the firm’s Contact Us
page displays no telephone
numbers, email addresses
or contact forms, and
simply invites you to log in
with a Facebook account or
register your details.
Well, thanks, but I’m not
about to take up that kind
offer. However, a watchdog
such as the Advertising
Standards Authority most
definitely should. If only to
save my monitor screen.

“W

If you’re anywhere near as volatile as
me, the only thing that’s “blown away”
by that pack of lies is your computer
monitor, when you put your fist through
it every time this dreadful internet
advert blares out of your speakers.
Despite all the fuss about “fake news”
at the moment, it’s fake ads that really
need to be dealt with – like the one
above, promoting the so-called Brit
Method, a get-rich-quick share-trading
scheme that’s about as likely to make
you wealthy as setting fire to your own
wallet. Not least because, as the brilliant
Dave Gorman pointed out on
his television show recently,
the ‘traders’ used for the
various international versions
of this advert all
coincidentally reap the exact
same amount in their first
month’s trading!
The Brit Method is just one
of a series of fake ads that
appears all over sites offering
free software downloads.
At the risk of a lengthy
conversation with the Web
User lawyers, it’s an outright
con, as are all those adverts
with big flashing ‘Download
Here’ buttons that try to
wrong-foot you into believing
they are the software you
came to the site for in the
first place. It’s pathetic,
pernicious and long past time
it was put to a stop – not least
because many of these ads
specifically target children.
