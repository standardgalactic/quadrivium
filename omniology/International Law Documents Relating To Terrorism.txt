Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the Financial Action Task Force Revised
Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering, the Special Recommendations on

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
Following the 11 September attacks in the United States, both the Security Council
and the General Assembly adopted resolutions condemning the attacks and calling
on all States to co-operate in bringing the perpetrators to justice. The Security Council
expresses its determination to combat, by all means, threats to international peace
and security caused by terrorist acts. The Council also reaﬃrmed the inherent right of
individual or collective self-defence in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations.
The Security Council also adopted unanimously a broad resolution – resolution
1373 – aimed at targeting terrorists and those who harbour, aid or support them. That
resolution requires Member States to co-operate in a wide range of areas – from sup-
pression of the ﬁnancing of terrorism to providing early warning, co-operating in
criminal investigations, and exchanging information on possible terrorist acts. As
a result all Member States now make greater eﬀorts to exchange information about
practices that have proved eﬀective, and lessons that have been learned, in the ﬁght
against terrorism.
The Security Council has also established a committee consisting of all members
of the council to monitor the implementation of resolution 1373. To this end, the
‘Counter – Terrorism Committee’ has received reports from Member States of the UN
on the steps that have taken by them to implement the resolution. Submissions have
also been made by some of the credible international organisations.
The 12 Conventions and Protocols on combating terrorism which have already been
adopted by the General Assembly have been reproduced in this book. It is hoped that
when the Assembly completes its work on a comprehensive Convention on terrorism,
Member States will sign, ratify and implement it very quickly. It has to be said that the
Security Council and General Assembly actions are providing a common legal frame-
work for international co-operation in the ﬁght against terrorism. In the long term
hopefully this will achieve the desired result.
Many international organisations have taken action after the 11 September attacks.
Some organisations have a regional focus; others are international in scope. These are
both international intergovernmental organisations and non-governmental groups that
have acted in support of the global war against terrorism. Since there are so many
actions by the international organisations involved, only actions by some of the more
signiﬁcant ones can be illustrated in the book.
The victims of the attacks on 11 September were, ﬁrst and foremost, the innocent
civilians who lost their lives. The victims were also their families who now grieve for
xxii

them. But peace, human rights, the rule of law, and the global economy are all
threatened by the terrorists’ acts. In order to restore trust among peoples and cultures,
a concerted international response can make the work of terrorists much harder to
accomplish. The unity born out of this tragedy should bring all nations together in
defence of the most basic right – the right of all peoples to live in peace and security.
This is the challenge before us as we seek to eliminate terrorism in every part of the
world.
This edition includes the most relevant international law instruments relating to
terrorism up to 1st October 2006.

INTRODUCTION
Background
During the Cold War, terrorism was not a major overriding intelligence priority and, in
many cases terrorism groups were perceived as acting on behalf of, or at best with the
support of Communist Parties. The focus was on the USSR as a superpower and not
terrorism per se. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw pact,
terrorism began to be perceived with even greater concern, especially when US military
forces and installations were repeatedly attacked by terrorist groups as in the 1996
Khobar towers barracks in Saudi Arabia, the August 1994 bombing of American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the attack on the USS Cole in October 2000.
It follows from that, that the threat posed by international terrorism to the United
States had become more apparent well before September 11. Pertinent to this,
Mr George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence, stated in his testimony before the
Senate Intelligence Committee on 6 February 2002, as follows:
the threat appears to have declined over the past ﬁve years, but Trans-national
groups—with decentralized leadership that makes them harder to identify and
disrupt—are emerging.
Furthermore,
[Osama] Bin Ladin and his global network of lieutenants and associates remain
the most immediate and serious threat.
In this testimony, Tenet stated that Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups will con-
tinue to plan to attack the United States and its interests, and have sought to acquire
dangerous chemical agents and toxins as well as nuclear devices.
It is diﬃcult to assess how successful the overall counter-terrorism eﬀort had been.
Sadly, the September 11, 2001 attacks were carried out, but other terrorist plans were
thwarted although very few details had been revealed. The foiling of multi-faceted
attacks on Los Angeles airport and other US-related targets to coincide with millen-
nium celebrations in January 2000 come to mind. Likewise, attacks on US embassies
and facilities in Paris, Singapore, and other parts of the world have reportedly been
averted as a result of counter-terrorism eﬀorts.
Following public discussion on the question of whether September 11 was an
xxiv
 
www.ebook3000.com

‘intelligence failure’, a joint investigation by the House of Representatives and the
Senate Intelligence Committee was undertaken in 2002. Congress also established an
independent commission to review the evidence presented by government agencies
surrounding the 9/11 attacks. Reports by both bodies are now publicly available and
they make a number of ﬁndings and recommendations in which they describe
inadequacies in the organisation of the Intelligence community. The President of the
USA has immediately ordered the adoption of the aforesaid recommendations. This
will obviously enhance the implementation of the USA Patriot Act, passed by Con-
gress in the immediate wake of 9/11. It would be recalled that the principal purpose of
that Act was to remove perceived restrictions on closer law enforcement—intelligence
co-operation in order to support counter-terrorist eﬀorts.
On the other hand, the passage of the USA Patriot Act and related legislation in
the wake of 9/11 has been criticised as a fundamental weakening of civil liberties
protections. Closer ties between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, particularly
in relation to gathering intelligence against US citizens and resident aliens, are viewed
with grave suspicion.
Deﬁning terrorism
Attempts have been made over the last few decades to elaborate a deﬁnition of inter-
national terrorism such as would meet the requirements of the principle of legality and
be ideologically neutral.
Participating States were unable to agree on a deﬁnition of terrorism, as one per-
son’s terrorist is often another person’s freedom ﬁghter. To circumvent this political
constraint, Member States have taken the approach of creating networks of Conven-
tions, which outlaw speciﬁc acts or conduct such as kidnapping, detonating bombs
or hijacking of aircraft. It is noteworthy that the 1999 International Convention on
the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism provides a near enough deﬁnition by
criminalising collection or provision of funds with intent of killing or injuring civilians
where the purpose is to intimidate a population or coerce a government.
Furthermore attempts by the UN ad hoc Committee, set up in 1996 to draft a
Comprehensive Convention on terrorism, have failed. Due to diﬃculties encountered
by political and ideological diﬀerences, the Committee could not reach a universal
deﬁnition of international terrorism. For example, States could not agree on basic
issues such as what the purpose of terrorism is, or who can commit terrorism. Not only
that, but no consensus could be reached on whether the deﬁnition should encompass
State-sponsored terrorism. To complicate matters further, there was no agreement as to
the demarcation line between terrorism and the legitimate ﬁght against oppression.
Whatever deﬁnition is sought, it will have to include a description of who may be the
perpetrator, what the motive is, the character of his act and on what basis he chooses
his target (property or the public). In short, there is a need to identify what makes
the terrorist diﬀerent. This will obviously involve a value judgment, and hence the
diﬃculty of reaching an objective deﬁnition. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur on
Terrorism, K. Koufa has observed that,
it may be that the deﬁnition problem is the major factor in the controversy
regarding terrorism. This is all the more true when considering the high
I N T RO D U C T I O N
xxv
 

political stakes attendant upon the task of deﬁnition. For the term terrorism is
emotive and highly loaded politically. It is habitually identiﬁed by an implicit
negative judgment and is used selectively. In this connection, some writers
have aptly underlined a tendency amongst commentators in the ﬁeld to mix
deﬁnitions with value judgments and either qualify as terrorism violent activity
or behaviour which they are opposed to or, conversely, reject the use of the
term when it relates to activities and situations which they approve of; hence,
the famous phrase ‘one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom ﬁghter’.
(‘Terrorism and Human Rights’, Progress report prepared by Ms.kalliopi
K.Koufa, Special Rapporteur of the Sub-commission on the Promotion and
Protection of Human Rights, UN document E/CN.4/Sub.2/2001/31,27
June 2001, para.25, p.8).
Plan of action to combat terrorism
Developing international instruments
In order for terrorism to be abated, the world community should continue the promo-
tion and adoption of international legal documents as they represent the most eﬀective
and legitimate response to the threat of terrorism.
Obviously, the eﬀectiveness of these legal instruments depends on their implementa-
tion and support by States. The UN system should intensify eﬀorts to raise awareness
of these instruments.
Moreover, notice should be taken of the fact that the existing instruments do not
create an integrated system and are full of major gaps. A general convention against
international terrorism should be framed with a view to enhancing the impact of the
measures taken over the last 25 years under UN aegis.
As concerns combating nuclear terrorism, it is vital that terrorists are denied access
to nuclear material. This can only be achieved by consolidating, securing and, when
possible, eliminating hazardous materials and implementing eﬀective export controls.
Although the Security Council and the Group of Eight Major Industrialized Countries
(G8) have taken important steps to do this, we still need to ensure that these measures
are fully enforced. It is time that the countries of the world conclude an international
convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.
Turning to biological terrorism, it must be recognized from the outset that its threat
diﬀers from that of nuclear terrorism. It is anticipated that in the very near future there
will be thousands of laboratories around the world capable of producing designer bugs
with awesome lethal potential. The best defence against this danger lies in strengthen-
ing our existing global public health response. In this respect, substantial resources
must be made available to the World Health Organisation (WHO) in order to monitor
and respond to outbreaks of suspicious deadly infectious disease.
Combating the funding of terrorism
Putting an end to the funding of terrorism is a decisive aspect. The international
community will have to be aware of the close inter-relation and connection between
international terrorism and trans-national organised crime. Examples of this would be
I N T RO D U C T I O N
xxvi
 
www.ebook3000.com

the traﬃcking of drugs and arms, and money-laundering. All Member States of the
United Nations should ratify as a matter of urgency the UN Convention for the
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Moreover, they should take steps to cut oﬀ
terrorists’ access to the international ﬁnancial system by implementing standards and
agreements on combating terrorist ﬁnancing and money laundering, as called for in
UN Resolutions 1373 and 1390. These measures include:
(a) eﬀective blocking of terrorist assets;
(b) criminalization of the ﬁnancing of terrorism;
(c) increased eﬀorts to investigate and prosecute money launderers and terrorist
ﬁnanciers;
(d) regulation and supervision of the ﬁnancial sector consistent with international
standards;
(e) compliance with FATF’s Eight Special Recommendations on terrorist ﬁnancing;
(f)
protection of non-proﬁt organisations and well meaning donors from having their
funds misused by terrorist ﬁnanciers;
(g) implementation of the FATF’s best practices for preventing abuse of charitable
institutions by terrorists; and
(h) implementation of steps with regard to regulation of alternative remittance
systems according to FATF standards embodied in FATF’s Eight Special
Recommendations.
Strengthening of air transport security
Eﬀective and uniform application of air security measures should be the subject of
regular reviews. The measures should cover in particular:
(a) improving airline passenger and crew safety by introducing highly eﬀective baggage
screening procedures and equipment in all international airports;
(b) accelerating implementation of standards for reinforced ﬂight deck doors for
passenger aircraft wherever possible;
(c) supporting International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Mandatory aviation
security audits;
(d) enhancing air cargo security by promoting adoption of the guidelines developed by
ICAO;
(e) strengthen joint eﬀorts to curb terrorist threats against mass transportation and
confront the threat posed by terrorists’ acquisition and use of Man-Portable Air
Defence Systems (MANPADS) against international aviation by committing to:
adopt strict domestic export controls on MANPADS; secure stockpiles; take
domestic action to regulate production, transfer and brokering; ban transfers to
non-state end-users; and exchange information in support of these eﬀorts;
(f)
cooperation to develop electronic movement records systems that will enhance
border security by implementing ‘Advanced Passenger Information System’, a
‘Regional Movement Alerts List System’ and issuing machine-readable travel
documents; and ﬁnally
(g) to ensure the safety and security of tourists by developing a standardized strategic
safety and security master plan, a crisis management model and promoting the
I N T RO D U C T I O N
xxvii
 

development by industry of simple-to-use safety and security measures for tourism
business.
Enhancing police and judicial cooperation
In line with the EU introduction of a European arrest warrant, States in other regions
of the world should supplant their current systems of extradition with comparable
instruments. This will make it possible to hand over wanted persons directly from one
jurisdiction to another. This will of course have to be consistent with fundamental
rights and freedom.
Global co-operation on the ﬁght against terrorism
The ﬁght against terrorism requires the more powerful and aﬄuent States of the world
to play a greater part in the eﬀorts of the international community to prevent and
stabilise regional conﬂicts. In particular, the European Union, in close collaboration
with the United States, the Russian Federation, and regional organizations in the
Muslim and Arab world, should make every attempt possible to put an end to the
Middle East conﬂict on the basis of the relevant UN resolutions. Pertinent to this, it
should be emphasized that there is an urgent need to combat any racist and xeno-
phobic drift, and by the same token, to reject any equation of terrorism with the Arab
and Muslim world.
The focus of all nations should be on dismantling trans-national terrorist groups.
This entails eliminating the severe and growing danger posed by the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery by strengthened non-
proliferation regimes, and adopting and enforcing eﬀective export controls. Finally,
States should strengthen collaboration, technical assistance and capacity building
with Counter-Terrorism Action Group of the G8, the UN Security Council Counter-
Terrorism Committee and other relevant international regional and functional
organisations.
Stabilising the world economy
The events of September 11 have caused the world economy to suﬀer from the shocks
associated with monetary ﬂuctuation. Countries with a rich economy such as the
Member States of the EU are sheltered from that. Countries with stable economies
are placed under a moral obligation to contribute to the economic salvation of less
fortunate countries.
Compatibility of counter-terrorism measures with human
rights obligations
The prevention of terrorism is also tied up with the protection and promotion of
human rights. This is because terrorism often thrives in environments in which human
rights are violated. Individuals who engage in terrorism invariably exploit human
rights abuses to gain support for their cause. It must be understood clearly that terrorism
itself is a violation of human rights, and that serious crimes committed by terrorists
I N T RO D U C T I O N
xxviii
 
www.ebook3000.com

should be tried before the International Criminal Court (ICC). The Statute of the ICC
covers crimes against humanity such as murder and extermination committed as part
of a widespread or systematic attack on any civilian population, and many of the
terrorist acts fall under the ambit of the ICC Statute.
Be that as it may, universal and regional systems frequently observe that the lawful-
ness of counter-terrorism measures depends upon their conformity with international
human rights law.
The Human Rights Committee has stressed that legislation enacted pursuant
to Security Council Resolution 1373 must be in conformity with the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The following six citations conﬁrm the position
of the Committee in this respect:
1.
The Committee is concerned that the relatively broad deﬁnition of the crime of
terrorism and of membership of a terrorist group under the State party’s Criminal
Code may have adverse consequences for the protection of rights under article 15
of the Covenant, a provision which signiﬁcantly is non-derogable under article 4,
paragraph 2. The State party is requested to ensure that counter-terrorism meas-
ures, whether taken in connection with Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) or
otherwise, are in full conformity with the Covenant. CCPR/CO/77/EST, para. 8
(2003)
2.
The State party is under an obligation to ensure that measures taken to implement
Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) are in full conformity with the Covenant.
The State party is requested to ensure that the deﬁnition of terrorism does not lead
to abuse and is in conformity with the Covenant. CCPR/CO/75/NZL, para.11
(2002)
3.
While understanding the security requirements associated with eﬀorts to combat
terrorism, the Committee voices concern at their eﬀects on the human rights
situation . . ., particularly in relation to articles 6, 7, 9 and 14 of the Covenant. . . .
The State party must ensure that steps taken in the campaign against terrorism are
fully in accordance with the Covenant. It should ensure that legitimate action
against terrorism does not become a source of violations of the Covenant. CCPR/
CO/76/EGY, para. 16 (2002).
4.
The Committee expresses its concern that . . . the State party indicated that no
study had been undertaken to ensure that legislative and other measures in pursu-
ance of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) were in compliance with its obliga-
tions under the Covenant. The State party is under an obligation to ensure that
counter-terrorism measures taken under Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)
are in full conformity with the Covenant. CCPR/CO/75/MDA, para. 8 (2002)
5.
While it understands the security requirements connected with the events of
11 September 2001, the Committee expresses its concern . . . at the attitude of the
security forces, including Political Security, which arrests and detains anyone
suspected of links with terrorism, in violation of the guarantees set out in the
Covenant (art. 9). The State party should ensure that the measures taken in the
name of the campaign against terrorism are within the limits of Security Council
resolution 1373 (2001) and fully consistent with the provisions of the Covenant. It
is requested to ensure that the fear of terrorism does not become a source of abuse.
CCPR/CO/75/YEM, para. 18 (2002)

6.
The Committee notes with concern that the State party, in seeking inter alia to give
eﬀect to its obligations to combat terrorist activities pursuant to Security Council
resolution 1373 (2001), is considering the adoption of legislative measures which
may have potentially far-reaching eﬀects on rights guaranteed in the Covenant and
which, in the State party’s view, may require derogations from human rights obliga-
tions. The State party should ensure that any measures it undertakes in this regard
are in full compliance with the provisions of the Covenant, including, when applic-
able, the provisions on derogation contained in article 4 of the Covenant. CCPR/
CO/73/UK, para. 6 (2001).
Mutual assistance
The requirement that parties aﬀord assistance in criminal proceedings appeared ﬁrst in
the 1970 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft. It is repeated
in all of the subsequent penal conventions (meaning all except the 1991 Plastic Explo-
sives Convention). In the 1979 Hostages Convention and subsequent instruments, that
assistance is speciﬁed as including the obtaining of evidence at a party’s disposal.
Beginning with the 1971 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the
Safety of Civil Aviation, the conventions all obligate parties to take measures to pre-
vent oﬀences against other parties. This obligation was broadened in the 1973 Inter-
nationally Protected Persons Convention to a duty to exchange information and
coordinate administrative and other preventive measures. All subsequent instruments
incorporate such a duty, except the 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful
Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation extending the 1971
Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation,
as the original Convention had not contained such an obligation.
In the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the chief
executives of a number of States issued decrees instructing governmental bodies to
increase their involvement in international co-operation. Since much non-judicial co-
operation can be accomplished by the executive branch within its existing powers, these
orders may be an expeditious and eﬀective means of implementing basic mutual assist-
ance requirements. More formal and binding arrangements can be secured by ratiﬁcation
and implementation of the universal anti-terrorism Conventions and by negotiation of
bilateral or multilateral mutual assistance treaties (see the Model Treaty on Mutual
Assistance in Criminal Matters (General Assembly resolution 45/117, annex)).
Extradition provisions
All of the penal conventions since 1970 (meaning all except the 1991 Plastic Explosives
Convention) contain a provision that the oﬀences which they deﬁne shall be deemed to
be included as extraditable oﬀences in any existing treaty between States parties, who
undertake to include such oﬀences in future extradition treaties. If a treaty is required,
the Convention may be relied upon between parties. If no treaty is required, the oﬀence
shall be treated as if it had been committed not only in the place where it occurred, but
also in the territory of the States that have established jurisdiction under that Convention
or Protocol (or in a place within the jurisdiction of the party requesting extradition, a
formulation used only in the 1988 Safety of Maritime Navigation Convention).

Exceptions made on grounds of political oﬀence
or discriminatory purposes
The 1963 Convention on Oﬀences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board
Aircraft expressly exempted from its application oﬀences against penal laws of a polit-
ical nature or those based on racial or religious discrimination. Any reference to an
exception based on political or discriminatory grounds was omitted from the sub-
sequent conventions between 1970 and 1991 (the 1970 Convention for the Suppression
of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, the 1971 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful
Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation and its 1988 Protocol for the Suppression of
Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, the 1980
Nuclear Material Convention, the 1988 Safety of Maritime Navigation Convention
and its 1988 Fixed Platforms Protocol and the 1991 Plastic Explosives Convention,
which in any event has no penalization obligation), but included in the 1979 Hostages
Convention, as explained below.
The 1997 Terrorist Bombings Convention and the 1999 Financing of Terrorism
Convention contain similar articles requiring the parties to deny any validity, in their
domestic political and legal institutions, to any political oﬀence, defence or justiﬁcation
for the acts of terrorism deﬁned in those conventions. In article 5, the 1997 Terrorist
Bombings Convention states:
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary, including,
where appropriate, domestic legislation, to ensure that criminal acts within the
scope of this Convention, in particular where they are intended or calculated
to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or
particular persons, are under no circumstances justiﬁable by considerations or
a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar
nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature.
This provision would seem to dictate that such considerations should not be allowable
as mitigating circumstances for punishment purposes and that they should not be
allowed to be presented or argued as a defence to criminal liability.
In addition, article 11 of the 1997 Terrorist Bombings Convention and article 14 of
the 1999 Financing of Terrorism Convention provide that:
None of the oﬀences set forth in article 2 [the oﬀence-deﬁning article in both
Conventions] shall be regarded, for the purposes of extradition or mutual legal
assistance, as a political oﬀence or as an oﬀence connected with a political
oﬀence, or as an oﬀence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request
for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such an oﬀence may not
be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political oﬀence or an oﬀence
connected with a political oﬀence or an oﬀence inspired by political motives.
The articles eliminating the political oﬀence exception are immediately followed in
both conventions by anti-discrimination provisos in identical language. Article 12 of
the 1997 Terrorist Bombings Convention and article 15 of the 1999 Financing of
Terrorism Convention provide that:
I N T RO D U C T I O N
xxxi
 

Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to
extradite or to aﬀord mutual legal assistance, if the requested State Party has
substantial ground for believing that the request for extradition for oﬀences set
forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such oﬀences has
been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of
that person’s race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or
that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person’s position
for any of these reasons.
Similar language, although referring only to extradition, is found in the 1979 Hostages
Convention. Those anti-discrimination articles that accompany the articles eliminating
the political oﬀence exception correspond to and embody the principles of non-
discrimination and impartiality of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (General
Assembly resolution 217 A (III)). Article 7 of the Declaration recognizes that:
All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to
equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any
discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to
such discrimination.
Article 10 of the Declaration establishes that:
Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an
independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and
obligations and of any criminal charge against him.
An example of domestic legislation implementing these principles and the require-
ments of the Convention with respect to extradition is the Extradition Act 1988 No. 4
of Australia, amended by the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Act 2002 No. 66,
2002. Section 5 of the amended act excludes from the deﬁnition of the 1999 Financing
of Terrorism Convention. That article incorporates the other nine anti-terrorism
instruments which deﬁne oﬀences. Section 5 also excludes crimes declared by national
regulation not to be oﬀences of a political nature. The anti-discrimination elements of
the 1999 Financing of Terrorism Convention are implemented in section 7, which lists
possible extradition objectives, including a discriminatory purpose for the request or
such an eﬀect if extradition is granted.
It should be noted that, in addition to the prohibitions set out in the 1997 Terrorist
Bombings Convention and the 1999 Financing of Terrorism Convention on the recog-
nition of a political oﬀence exception for crimes deﬁned by those Conventions, the
Security Council, in paragraph 3(g) of its resolution 1373 (2001), calls upon all
States to:
Ensure, in conformity with international law, that refugee status is not abused
by perpetrators, organizers or facilitators of terrorist acts, and that claims of
political motivation are not recognized as grounds for refusing request for the
extradition of alleged terrorists.

11. UN Security Council Resolution 1456 (2003)
High level meeting of the Security Council: combating terrorism
ADOPTED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL AT ITS 4688TH MEETING, ON 20 JANUARY 2003
The Security Council,
Decides to adopt the attached declaration on the issue of combating terrorism.
Annex
The Security Council,
Meeting at the level of Ministers for Foreign Aﬀairs on 20 January 2003 reaﬃrms
that:
—
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious
threats to peace and security;
—
any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustiﬁable, regardless of their motivation,
whenever and by whomsoever committed and are to be unequivocally condemned,
especially when they indiscriminately target or injure civilians;
22
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
 
www.ebook3000.com

— there is a serious and growing danger of terrorist access to and use of nuclear,
chemical, biological and other potentially deadly materials, and therefore a need to
strengthen controls on these materials;
—
it has become easier, in an increasingly globalized world, for terrorists to exploit
sophisticated technology, communications and resources for their criminal
objectives;
—
measures to detect and stem the ﬂow of ﬁnance and funds for terrorist purposes
must be urgently strengthened;
—
terrorists must also be prevented from making use of other criminal activities
such as transnational organized crime, illicit drugs and drug traﬃcking, money-
laundering and illicit arms traﬃcking;
—
since terrorists and their supporters exploit instability and intolerance to justify
their criminal acts the Security Council is determined to counter this by contribut-
ing to peaceful resolution of disputes and by working to create a climate of mutual
tolerance and respect;
—
terrorism can only be defeated, in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations and international law, by a sustained comprehensive approach involving
the active participation and collaboration of all States, international and regional
organizations, and by redoubled eﬀorts at the national level.
The Security Council therefore calls for the following steps to be taken:
1.
All States must take urgent action to prevent and suppress all active and passive
support to terrorism, and in particular comply fully with all relevant resolutions
of the Security Council, in particular resolutions 1373 (2001), 1390 (2002) and
1455 (2003);
2.
The Security Council calls upon States to:

representative government, and calling for the warring factions to cooperate fully with
those eﬀorts to conclude a ceaseﬁre and begin discussions leading to a political settle-
ment, by moving forward promptly in the process of dialogue to which they have
committed themselves,
Noting the December 2000 meeting of the Afghan Support Group which emphasized
that the situation in Afghanistan is a complex one that requires a comprehensive,

human rights, and international humanitarian and development aid,
Recalling the relevant international counter-terrorism conventions and in particular
the obligations of parties to those conventions to extradite or prosecute terrorists,

trol of the Afghan faction known as Taliban, which also calls itself the Islamic Emirate

AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  NAT I O N S  S E C U R I T Y  C O U N C I L
 

Reaﬃrming also its resolution 635 (1989) of 14 June 1989, in which it condemned all
acts of unlawful interference against the security of civil aviation and called upon
all States to cooperate in devising and implementing measures to prevent all acts of
terrorism, including those involving explosives,
Recalling the statement made on 30 December 1988 by the President of the Security
Council on behalf of the members of the Council strongly condemning the destruction
of Pan Am ﬂight 103 and calling on all States to assist in the apprehension and
prosecution of those responsible for this criminal act,
Deeply concerned over the results of investigations, which implicate oﬃcials of
the Libyan Government and which are contained in Security Council documents

29. UN Security Council Resolution 748 (1992)
On sanctions against Libya
ADOPTED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL AT ITS 3063RD MEETING, ON 31 MARCH 1992
The Security Council,
Reaﬃrming its resolution 731 (1992) of 21 January 1992,
Noting the reports of the Secretary-General of 11 February and 3 March 1992
submitted pursuant to paragraph 4 of Security Council resolution 731 (1992),
Deeply concerned that the Libyan Government has still not provided a full and
eﬀective response to the requests in its resolution 731 (1992),
Convinced that the suppression of acts of international terrorism, including those in
which States are directly or indirectly involved, is essential for the maintenance of
international peace and security,
Recalling that, in the statement issued on 31 January 1992 on the occasion of the
meeting of the Security Council at the level of heads of State and Government, the
56

members of the Council expressed their deep concern over acts of international terror-
ism, and emphasized the need for the international community to deal eﬀectively with
all such acts,
Reaﬃrming that, in accordance with the principle in Article 2, paragraph 4, of the
Charter of the United Nations, every State has the duty to refrain from organizing,
instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in
organized activities within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts,
when such acts involve a threat or use of force,
Determining, in this context, that the failure by the Libyan Government to demon-
strate by concrete actions its renunciation of terrorism and in particular its continued
failure to respond fully and eﬀectively to the requests in resolution 731 (1992) constitute
a threat to international peace and security,

cant humanitarian need by the Security Council Committee established by
paragraph 9 below;
(b) Prohibit, by their nationals or from their territory, the supply of any aircraft or
aircraft components to Libya, the provision of engineering and maintenance
servicing of Libyan aircraft or aircraft components, the certiﬁcation of air-

5.
Decides further that all States shall:

sult the organization concerned on the measures required to implement this
subparagraph;
(b) Prevent the operation of all Libyan Arab Airlines oﬃces;
(c) Take all appropriate steps to deny entry to or expel Libyan nationals who have
been denied entry to or expelled from other States because of their involvement
in terrorist activities;
7.
Calls upon all States, including States not members of the United Nations, and all
international organizations, to act strictly in accordance with the provisions of the
present resolution, notwithstanding the existence of any rights or obligations con-
ferred or imposed by any international agreement or any contract entered into or
any licence or permit granted prior to 15 April 1992,
8.
Requests all States to report to the Secretary-General by 15 May 1992 on the
measures they have instituted for meeting the obligations set out in paragraphs 3 to
7 above,
9.
Decides to establish, in accordance with rule 28 of its provisional rules of pro-

30. UN Security Council Resolution 635 (1989)
Marking of plastic or sheet explosives for the purpose of detection
ADOPTED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL AT ITS 2869TH MEETING, ON 14 JUNE 1989
The Security Council,
Conscious of the implications of acts of terrorism for international security,
Deeply concerned by all acts of unlawful interference against international civil
aviation,
Mindful of the important role of the United Nations in supporting and encouraging
eﬀorts by all States and intergovernmental organizations in preventing and eliminating
all acts of terrorism, including those involving the use of explosives,

(Signed ) Jeremy Greenstock
Enclosure
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Report to the
Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to paragraph 6 of Security
Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001
1.
The unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) (SCR 1373)
(www.UN.org/Docs/scres/2001/res1373e.pdf) on 28 September 2001 was an historic
event. This was the ﬁrst resolution to impose obligations on all states to respond to
the global threat of terrorism.
2.
The United Kingdom has taken a full range of legislative and executive measures
to ensure compliance with SCR 1373. We are also fully committed to the work of
the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in ensuring global implementation of
this resolution.
LEGISLATIVE ACTION
3.
Before September 11 the United Kingdom had a wide range of legislative measures
in place to counteract terrorist activity. The centrepiece of this legislative framework
was the United Kingdom Terrorism Act 2000. Other relevant legislation included
the Immigration Act 1971, the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, the
Extradition Act 1989 and the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994. Following the
events of September 11 it was decided to enhance the UK’s existing Anti-Terrorism
legislation. This resulted in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 which
received royal assent on 14 December 2001.
Legislation has also been adopted under the United Nations Act 1946.
4.
In implementing SCR 1373 the United Kingdom has been careful to ensure that
its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention, The European Convention on
Human Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments are fully
respected.
5.
Detailed responses as to how the above legislative framework relates to speciﬁc
concerns raised by SCR 1373 are set out below.
EXECUTIVE ACTION
6.
The United Kingdom has established an Interdepartmental Group to oversee the
implementation of SCR 1373. The group consists of representatives of:
—
The Foreign and Commonwealth Oﬃce
—
The Treasury
—
The Home Oﬃce
— The Department of Trade and Industry
— Customs and Excise
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

— Department for Transport and the Regions
— The Bank of England
7.
The Group has met on a number of occasions to discuss support for the work
of the CTC; the preparation of the United Kingdom’s response to the CTC and
possible ways of providing assistance to other States.
IN EUROPE
8.
The United Kingdom has always participated actively in counter-terrorism action
within the EU and will continue to do so. The special European Council on 20 and
21 September 2001 agreed that counterterrorism should be a priority for the
Union, both internally and in its relations with third countries. Heads of State and
Government endorsed an EU Action Plan on 21 September to help member States
step up the ﬁght against global terrorism and to improve practical co-operation
among member States. To date, 68 concrete measures under the Action Plan have
been identiﬁed and taken forward. These measures include:
(a) creation of fast-track extradition and an EU arrest warrant, which should
signiﬁcantly reduce obstacles to extradition within EU;
(b) agreement on common EU oﬀences and penalties for terrorist activity;
(c) setting up a team of EU Member States’ anti-terrorist experts who can ensure
timely collection and analysis of information and intelligence and draft threat
assessments;
(d) conclusion of the US/Europol agreement on 6 December;
(e) the rapid implementation of the UN Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism by all EU Member States;
(f)
a requirement that the potential impact on the ﬁght against crime and terrorism
is fully considered in the drafting EC legislation;
(g) measures on freezing of assets and evidence;
(h) a review of the EU’s relations with third countries in the light of their support
for counter-terrorism.
9.
On 10 December, the Council of the EU agreed a Common Position and Regulation
to implement the UNSCR 1373 provision relating to the suppression of terrorist
ﬁnancing.
ACTION IN THE OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND CROWN DEPENDENCIES
10. The UK is responsible for the international relations of its Overseas Territories and
Crown Dependencies.
11. Three Overseas Territories (Bermuda, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands) have
indicated that they will apply the relevant provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000 and
the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act by local legislation. The remaining
Overseas Territories have opted for the United Kingdom to do so on their behalf,
through an Order in Council.
12. A ﬁrst draft of the Overseas Territories model legislation will be ready in early
January 2002, for consultation with the Overseas Territories shortly thereafter. The
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
63
 

Government hopes that the Overseas Territories will, by Spring 2002 be in a
position to
(a) bring the necessary legislation to their local legislature for approval (in the
cases of Cayman, Bermuda, Gibraltar), or (b) agree that the United Kingdom
should make an Order In Council on their behalf (for the remainder).
13. The Crown Dependencies (the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) are intro-
ducing their own domestic legislation to apply measures equivalent to those in the
United Kingdom’s Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security
Act 2001.
14. Action in relation to the to the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies has
also been taken under the United Nations Act 1946 (through SI Numbers 3363,
3364 and 3366).
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO OTHER STATES
15. The United Kingdom has a wide-ranging programme of bilateral assistance in
counter terrorism, aimed at preventing terrorism, apprehending terrorists and con-
tributing to stability and preventing conﬂicts. In the past ﬁve years, activities
covered by this programme have included visits, seminars and training projects in
the following ﬁelds:
•
hostage negotiations;
•
explosive and ordinance disposal;
•
aviation and maritime transport security;
•
bomb scene management;
•
crisis management.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Oﬃce employs a part-time Hostage and Crisis
Management Consultant to support this programme.
16. The United Kingdom also supports the establishment of a Global Trust Fund to
provide technical assistance to countries that need help in implementing SCR 1373.
This could cover advice on drafting relevant legislation; assessment of precise needs
for training; advice on protective security measures; and training and advice for
ﬁnancial control authorities. The CTC has already done much valuable work in
collating information on what expertise, including from the UK, is already avail-
able in these areas. The United Kingdom would be willing to make a signiﬁcant
contribution to such a fund should it be established.
COORDINATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE
17. The CTC will also need to work closely with other international actors who are
involved in the ﬁght against terrorism, including the Vienna-based UN organisa-
tions, the International Financial institutions, regional organisations such as the
EU and the OIC, the OECD and the G8 (including the FATF). The UK has
actively promoted the work of the CTC in all these organisations and encouraged
them to coordinate closely to prevent the waste of scarce human and ﬁnancial
resources.

Comments in relation to the speciﬁc questions posed by the
Counter-Terrorism Committee:
Operative Paragraph 1
Sub-paragraph (a)—What measures if any have been taken to prevent and suppress the
ﬁnancing of terrorist acts in addition to those listed in your responses to questions on 1 (b)
to (d)
•
The United Kingdom moved quickly to freeze the assets of those involved in the
ﬁnancing of terrorism following adoption of SCR 1373(2001). Lists were issued on
12 October, 2 November and 7 November 2001 identifying 48 individuals and 77
organisations whose accounts would be frozen pursuant to SCR 1373. These lists
included individuals listed by the US under President Bush’s Executive Order,
the US list of 22 most wanted terrorists; the list of United Kingdom proscribed
terrorist organisations; and the individuals and organisations listed by the United
States on 7 November 2001. Those lists have been communicated to some 600 banks
and other ﬁnancial institutions in the United Kingdom, and have been published in
a Bank of England Press Release (www.bankofengland.co.uk).
Sub-paragraph (b)—What are the oﬀences and penalties in your country with respect to
the activities listed in this sub-paragraph?
•
The Terrorism Act 2000 describes four main oﬀences in relation to terrorist funding.
—Fund raising: it is an oﬀence to invite anyone to provide money or property;
receive money or property; or provide money or property for the purposes of
terrorism.
—Use and possession of money or property for the purposes of terrorism.
—Funding arrangements: involvement in arrangements whereby money or property
is made available for terrorism.
—Money laundering: facilitating the retention or control of terrorist property in
any way, including concealment; removal from the jurisdiction; and transfer to
nominees.
•
All of these apply in situations where a person intends, or has reasonable cause
to suspect, that money or property will be used for the purposes of terrorism. The
maximum penalty for each of these oﬀences is 14 years imprisonment and/or a ﬁne.
•
There is also an obligation to disclose knowledge or suspicion of terrorist funding,
based on information arising from one’s trade, profession, business or employ-
ment. Failure to disclose such information is an oﬀence subject to penalties of up
to ﬁve years imprisonment and a ﬁne. The Anti Terrorism, Crime and Security
Act modiﬁed the Terrorism Act 2000 so that failure to disclose is an oﬀence, in
the regulated ﬁnancial sector, wherever there are ‘reasonable grounds’ to suspect
terrorist funding.
Sub-paragraph (c)—What legislation and procedures exist for freezing accounts and
assets at banks and ﬁnancial institutions? It would be helpful if States supplied examples
of any relevant action taken.
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
65
 

•
Paragraph 1(c) of SCR 1373 is implemented in the United Kingdom by an Order in
Council (SI 2001 No. 3365), made under section 1 of the United Nations Act 1946.
This Order, which became eﬀective on 10 October 2001, empowers the Treasury to
direct banks and ﬁnancial institutions to freeze the accounts of individuals and
entities suspected of involvement in terrorism. Failure to do so is an oﬀence. Since
the adoption of SCR 1373, seven accounts have been frozen containing £7.2 million.
Prior to the making of SI 2001 No. 3365, accounts in the United Kingdom of those
associated with the Taliban and Usama bin Laden were frozen in accordance with
the orders made pursuant to UNSCR 1267 and 1333, which are still in force. Parallel
legislation has been adopted for the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories
Sub-paragraph (d)—What measures exist to prohibit the activities listed in this sub-
paragraph?
•
In addition to the legislation referred to above in relation to sub-paragraph 1(b)
SI 2001 No. 3365 makes it an oﬀence to provide funds to persons involved in
terrorism. The term ‘funds’ has a broad deﬁnition and includes the making
available of ﬁnancial assets and economic beneﬁts of any kind.
Operative Paragraph 2
Sub-paragraph (a)—What legislation or other measures are in place to give eﬀect to this
sub-paragraph?
What other measures help prevent such activities? In particular what oﬀences in your
country prohibit
(i) recruitment to terrorist groups
•
The Terrorism Act 2000 includes powers to proscribe terrorist organisations con-
cerned in international and domestic terrorism, in addition to those organisations
concerned in terrorism connected with the aﬀairs of Northern Ireland. Under the
Act it is an oﬀence to belong to or invite support for a proscribed organisation.
More generally the provisions of the Terrorism Act apply to all those involved
in terrorism, irrespective of whether the organisation they claim to represent is
proscribed.
•
The Act also includes provisions for speciﬁc oﬀences of providing weapons training
for terrorist purposes and of recruitment for such training.
and
(ii) the supply of weapons to terrorists?
•
The United Kingdom’s export control legislation contributes towards the elimin-
ation of the supply of weapons to terrorists. The export of conventional weapons
from the United Kingdom is not permitted unless the exporter is in possession of a
valid export licence.

•
The Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, as amended, (http://www2.dti.gov.
UnitedKingdom/export.control/legislation/egco.htm) prohibits the export to all
destinations of military, security, and para-military goods and arms, ammunition
and related material listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Order (the ‘Military
List’) (http://www2.dti.gov.United Kingdom/export.control/pdfs/egco.ddf) without
an export licence.
•
The United Kingdom also controls the export of certain goods which may be used
in the ﬁght against terrorism (to ensure that such goods do not fall into the hands
of terrorists). Controls are also applied to certain industrial explosives that could
be used as components of improvised explosive devices.
•
The Export Control Bill, (www.parliament.the-stationeryoﬃce.co.uk/pa/1d200102/
1dbills/020/2002020.htm) currently under consideration by Parliament, will provide
powers to control traﬃcking and brokering. It sets out various purposes for which
controls may be imposed, which include ‘the carrying out anywhere in the world of
(or of acts which facilitate) acts of terrorism or serious crime anywhere in the world’.
•
Controls are also in place on nuclear-related items; chemical weapons precursors
and related equipment and technology; certain micro-organisms, biological equip-
ment and technology, goods used in weapons of mass destruction programmes;
and missiles used for their delivery; and those dual-use items designed for civil use
that can be used for military purposes. These [latter] items are listed in an Annex
to Council Regulation (EC) 1334/2000 (www.dti.gov.uk/export.control/legislation/
ecreg.htm, as amended, which establishes a regime for the control of exports
of dual-use items and technology in the European Community. It implements
agreed dual-use controls including those of the Wassenaar Arrangement, Missile
Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers’ Group, the Australia Group and
the Chemical Weapons Convention. See (http://www2.dti.gov.United Kingdom/
export.control/legislation/ecreg.htm). The Council Regulation also includes a catch-
all control which brings items not included in the dual-use list under control if the
prospective exporter is informed, or if they are aware, that the items they propose
to export are intended for use in connection with a number of Weapons of Mass
Destruction activities.
Oﬀences and penalties relevant to export controls
•
The main oﬀences relate to export, or attempted export, of goods contrary to any
restriction in force in relation to these goods. Thus any export of controlled goods
without the necessary licence gives rise to an oﬀence.
•
Section 68(1) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (annex) provides
penalties of up to £1000 for any export, or attempted export, without the necessary
licence and renders the goods liable to forfeiture.
•
Sections 68(2) and 68(3) of the same Act provides for penalties of up to 7 years
imprisonment and an unlimited ﬁne where there is a deliberate breach of, or
attempt to breach, the restriction.
•
The above penalties apply to exports controlled under the Export of Goods (Control)
Order 1994 (www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/si/si1994/Uksi_19940534_en_1.htm) and
Council Regulation (EC) 1334/2000 (www.dti.gov.uk/export.control/legislation/
ecreg.htm).
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E

•
Some dual use items, not speciﬁcally controlled under Council Regulation (EC)
1334/2000 are controlled under the Dual Use Items (Export Control) Regulations
2000 (SI 2000/2620). The penalty for deliberate breach of these controls is an
unlimited ﬁne and 2 years imprisonment.
•
The Export Control Bill, currently before Parliament, will enable the United
Kingdom to increase the maximum sentence for the most serious oﬀences to
10 years imprisonment. This will apply both to oﬀences that currently attract a
maximum sentence of 7 years imprisonment and those that currently attract
a maximum sentence of 2 years imprisonment under SI 2000/2620.
Licensing policy
•
Applications to export arms and dual-use goods are assessed against the Consoli-
dated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria (http://ﬁles.fco.gov.
UnitedKingdom/und/sanctions/summary.pdf). This assessment takes into account,
among other criteria, the record of the buyer country with regard to its support or
encouragement of terrorism and the risk of diversion of the equipment within the
buyer country or its re-export under undesirable conditions.
The United Kingdom pays particular attention to the need to avoid diversion of
exports to terrorist organisations.
Sub-paragraph (b)—What other steps are being taken to prevent the commission of
terrorists acts, and in particular, what early warning mechanisms exist to allow exchange
of information with other states?
•
Countering the activities of those who may be seeking to assist terrorism outside
the United Kingdom is a high priority for the Police and Security Service. The
United Kingdom is active in promoting international co-operation on terrorism
bilaterally and in multinational fora (EU, UN and G8). The United Kingdom also
seeks to enhance practical and eﬀective co-operation with other countries to deny
terrorists a safe haven and bring them to justice.
Sub-paragraph (c)—What legislation or procedures exist for denying safe haven to
terrorists such as laws for excluding or expelling the types of individuals referred to in
this sub-paragraph? It would be helpful if States supplied examples of any relevant action
taken.
•
Under the United Kingdom’s immigration control mechanisms, including the
Immigration Acts, the Home Secretary has a personal power to exclude people
from the United Kingdom. This power is usually exercised under one of three justi-
ﬁcations—national security, public order or foreign relations. Anyone excluded
because of possible terrorist links/involvement would fall into the national security
category. The power is used sparingly, but regularly. Since 1990, 273 people have
been excluded on national security grounds.
•
As far as removal is concerned, the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended) makes
provision for the deportation of those whose presence in the United Kingdom is
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
68
 
www.ebook3000.com

deemed not to be conducive to the public good. There is a right of appeal against
any decision of this sort, and a special body, the Special Immigration Appeals
Commission, set up to deal with security cases, which hears the appeal. The dif-
ﬁculty with removal is that Article 3 of the European Convention on Human
Rights prevents removal to countries where there is a real risk of torture, or
inhuman or degrading treatment. This has meant that very few people are removed
on national security grounds.
•
The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act provides that, where removal from
the UK is not a realistic possibility, those involved in terrorist activities may be
detained indeﬁnitely in the UK.
This procedure involves a ﬁve-year derogation from Article 5 of the European
Convention on Human Rights.
Sub-paragraph (d)—What legislation or procedures exist to prevent terrorists acting from
your territory against other states or citizens? It would be helpful if States supplied
examples of any relevant action taken.
•
As well as proscribing twenty-one international terrorist organisations, the provi-
sions of the Terrorism Act 2000 also contain an oﬀence of incitement to commit
an act of terrorism wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom, where that act, if
committed in the United Kingdom, would constitute one of a number of oﬀences,
including murder. The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 also
makes it an oﬀence to conspire in the United Kingdom to commit terrorist oﬀences
overseas. The Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act strengthens these antiterror-
ism laws and includes further measures that increase police powers to investigated
suspected terrorist ﬁnances
•
From an immigration point of view, the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security
Act enables the state to detain people indeﬁnitely, where the Home Secretary has
certiﬁed that they are a threat to United Kingdom national security and are
suspected international terrorists, and where they cannot be removed to another
country.
Sub-paragraph (e)—What steps have been taken to establish terrorist acts as serious
criminal oﬀences and to ensure that the punishment reﬂects the seriousness of such
terrorist acts? Please supply examples of any convictions obtained and the sentence
given.
•
The Terrorism Act 2000 deﬁnes terrorism as the use or threat, for the purpose of
advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, of action which involved ser-
ious violence against a person or serious damage to property, endangers a person’s
life, creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or section of the
public, or is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic
system. Criminal oﬀences falling within this deﬁnition can be investigated by the
police using the powers contained in the Act. The question of the appropriate
punishment for those convicted of criminal oﬀences is a matter for judicial discre-
tion and is based on the guidelines available to the trial judge and the individual
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
69
 

circumstances of the case. The United Kingdom courts do, however, regularly
impose strong penalties for terrorist-related criminal oﬀences.
Sub-paragraph (f)—What procedures and mechanisms are in place to assist other states?
Please provide any available details of how these have been used in practice.
•
The United Kingdom is committed to strengthened international co-operation to
deal with the terrorist threat and considers that it is important to share information
and best practice in this area. The United Kingdom is always ready to co-operate
with other like-minded countries on counter-terrorism issues, both in bilateral con-
tacts and in international fora such as the EU, UN and G8. For example, within the
EU the United Kingdom supported the extension of Europol’s remit to include
counter-terrorism activity. This has enabled EU Member States to build on the
excellent counter-terrorism co-operation that already exists between their police/
intelligence agencies.
Sub-paragraph (g)—How do border controls in your country prevent the movement of
terrorists? How do your procedures for issuance of identity papers and travel documents
support this? What measures exist to prevent their forgery etc?
•
The UK concentrates most of its immigration control at sea and airports, using
Visa regimes and examination on arrival, backed by intelligence, to prevent the
movement of terrorists. The United Kingdom does not issue ‘identity papers’ and
does not have an internal system of identity cards or similar. The only form of
identity document issued is the British Passport.
•
Passports are issued only to UK. Measures are in place to reduce the possibility
of fraud, and forgery to a minimum.
•
Those who are recognised as refugees by the United Kingdom are issued with a
United Kingdom Travel Document. Only those who are settled in the United
Kingdom are eligible and they will have gone through the processes outlined in
the answer to Operative Paragraph 3, sub-paragraph (f).
Operative Paragraph 3
Sub-paragraph (a)—What steps have been taken to intensify and accelerate the exchange
of operational information in the areas indicated in this sub-paragraph?
•
The United Kingdom is committed to the rapid exchange between countries of
operational information regarding terrorism. Within the EU, the United Kingdom
authorities are fully engaged in supporting Europol’s new Counter-Terrorism
task force. The United Kingdom authorities also continue, in accordance with the
terms of the Europol Convention, to transmit to Europol information on counter-
terrorism related activity, and relevant threat assessment and protective security
measures. The establishment of Europol’s Counter-Terrorism Task Force will serve
to promote the existing positive cooperation between Europol and EU Member
States’ police, and security and intelligence services.
•
The United Kingdom conducts a number of export control outreach activities
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
70
 
www.ebook3000.com

in the form of bilateral talks and awareness raising seminars. Dedicated export
control bilateral meetings address practical issues surrounding export licensing
and enforcement in detail. All states that are new additions to our programme of
bilateral talks on export controls are oﬀered seminars focusing on their speciﬁc
operational needs and interests.
Sub-paragraph (b)—What steps have been taken to exchange information and co-operate
in the areas indicated in this sub-paragraph?
•
The United Kingdom is active in promoting international co-operation both
bilaterally and in multilateral fora, participating energetically in Counter Terror-
ist activity in the European Union (see Paragraph 8 above); fully supported
the Commonwealth Secretary General’s initiative to establish a Commonwealth
Committee on Terrorism; working with G8 colleagues to produce an Action Plan
on Terrorism; and active in the Vienna based organisations of the UN, NATO
and the OSCE. In all these fora the UK have encouraged practical and eﬀective
co-operation with the aim of denying terrorists a safe haven and bringing them to
justice.
Sub-paragraph (c)—What steps have been taken to co-operate in the areas indicated in
this sub-paragraph?
•
As described in section 3 (b) the United Kingdom plays an active role in the cam-
paign against terrorism in a wide range of international organisations. The United
Kingdom also discusses counter terrorism issues with a wide range of countries on
a bilateral basis (see Paragraph 12 above).
Sub-paragraph (d)—What are your government’s intentions regarding signing and/or
ratifying the conventions and protocols referred to in this sub-paragraph?
•
The United Kingdom has signed and ratiﬁed all twelve international global con-
ventions and protocols on terrorism. It is also a Party to the European Convention
on the Suppression of Terrorism (1977). Action is in hand to extend these Con-
ventions to the Overseas Territories, in the few cases where this has not already
occurred. Details of signature and ratiﬁcation by the United Kingdom are provided
in attachment I.
Sub-paragraph (e)—Provide any relevant information on the implementation of the
conventions, protocols and resolutions referred to in this sub-paragraph.
•
The United Kingdom has fully implemented the twelve international con-
ventions and protocols on terrorism and the European Convention on the
Suppression of Terrorism, along with Security Council Resolutions 1269 and
1368. The Terrorism Act 2000, which came into force in February 2000, enabled
the UK to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist
Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing
of Terrorism.
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E

Action is in hand to prepare model legislation to enable the Overseas Territories
similarly to implement these Conventions.
Sub-paragraph (f)—What legislation procedures and mechanisms are in place for ensuring
asylum seekers have not been involved in terrorist activity before granting refugee status.
Please supply examples of any relevant cases.
•
All asylum applicants in the UK are interviewed and their ﬁngerprints taken before
any grant of status is made. Where someone is shown, either through interview or
other methods, to have connections with terrorist organisations, consideration will
be given to whether they are excluded from the protection of the 1951 Convention,
and to removing them from the United Kingdom. The Anti-Terrorism, Crime
and Security Act gives the Home Secretary the power to certify that a person with
terrorist connections should not be entitled to the protection of the 1951 Con-
vention. It is United Kingdom Government policy not to reveal details of an
individual’s immigration status to any third party.
Sub-paragraph (g)—What procedures are in place to prevent the abuse of refugee status
by terrorists?
•
Under the provisions of Article 1 (f) of the 1951 Convention refugee status is not
available to those who have committed serious crimes such as terrorism. In the
context of Article 33 of the Convention, terrorists cannot beneﬁt from the prin-
ciple of non-refoulement. In cases where removal is precluded by Article 3 of the
European Convention on Human Rights, terrorists will be detained indeﬁnitely
under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act.
Please provide details of legislation and/or administrative procedures which prevent claims
of political motivation being recognised as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition
of alleged terrorists.
Please supply examples of any relevant cases.
•
Extradition to and from the United Kingdom is governed by the Extradition Act
1989 (‘the 1989 Act’). This can be found at http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.United
Kingdom/acts/acts1989
•
Section 6 of, and Schedule 1, paragraph 1(2) to, the 1989 Act provide that a fugitive
shall not be extradited for an ‘oﬀence of a political character’. However, this basic
provision is qualiﬁed in a number of ways:
(a) Section 23 of the 1989 Act provides that acts of genocide may not be regarded
as oﬀences of a political character;
(b) Section 24 of the 1989 Act (attachment II), as amended by section 64 of the
Terrorism Act 2000, provides that in respect of extradition requests from
designated countries certain oﬀences cannot be regarded as oﬀences of a politi-
cal nature. The oﬀences are those listed in Schedule 1 to the Suppression of
Terrorism Act 1978 (‘the 1978 Act’) (attachment III) and in section 22(4)(m)
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

and (n) of the 1989 Act which refer to the International Conventions on the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism;
(c) By designating states, the United Kingdom disapplies the political oﬀence
exception for those oﬀences listed in Schedule 1 of the 1978 Act. 18 European
Convention on Extradition (ECE) states and the USA and India are so
designated (attachment IV).
•
The United Kingdom intends to introduce further legislation on extradition
early in 2002 to ensure that its legislation complies fully with the terms of SCR
1373.

Enclosure
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: second
report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to paragraph 6 of
Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001*
Sub-paragraph 1 (c): As requirements under this sub-paragraph refer to freezing of not
merely funds and other ﬁnancial assets, please could the UK make clear whether existing
measures allow for the freezing of economic resources and other related services of
individuals and entities connected with terrorist acts.
The provisions of UNSCR 1373 (2001) were implemented in UK law by the Terrorism
(United Nations Measures) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/3365). This provided for the freezing
of ‘funds’, deﬁned as ‘ﬁnancial assets and economic beneﬁts of every kind’. The
Al-Qa’ida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2002 (SI 2002/111) amended
the deﬁnition of ‘funds’ in the 2001 Order to mean ‘ﬁnancial assets, economic beneﬁts
and economic resources of any kind’, thereby providing for the freezing of economic
resources.
Sub-paragraph 1 (d): Please clarify whether SI 2001 No. 3365 extends to persons engaged
in legitimate activities inside the UK who are involved in terrorism outside the UK.
Article 2 of SI 2001 No. 3365 deﬁnes terrorism as meaning the use or threat of action,
which is designed to inﬂuence the government or intimidate the public or a section of
the public, and which is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or
ideological cause. Such action is terrorism when it involves serious violence against a
person or serious damage to property, endangers another person’s life, creates a serious
risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or is designed
seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system. The same article
goes on to make it clear that such action includes action outside the United Kingdom;
that references to a person or property include a person or property wherever situated;
and that references to the public include the public of a country other than that of the
United Kingdom.
Paragraph 3 of SI 2001 No. 3365 prohibits the making available of funds to any
person who commits, attempts to commit, facilitates or participates in the commission
of acts of terrorism, or to persons controlled or owned by them or acting on their
behalf or at their direction. Article 4 of the order provides for the freezing of funds
held by such persons. In accordance with article 2, such acts of terrorism include acts
of terrorism outside the United Kingdom.
Are there any regulations concerning alternative remittance systems?
UK legislation covers all payment systems. The Money Laundering Regulations 2001
provide for the regulation of all money service operators, including bureaux de change
and operators of alternative remittance systems.
*
The annexes are on ﬁle with the Secretariat and are available for consultation.
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
79
 

Under these regulations, money service operators are required to register their oper-
ation with Customs authorities. They are also required to report on their transactions
and fulﬁl other requirements established by regulation. Customs authorities have the
power to inspect their operations at any time. A copy of these regulations can be found
at http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/si/si2001/20013641.htm
How does the ﬁnancial tracking system ensure that funds received by bodies such as
charities are not diverted from their stated purposes to terrorist activities?
The Charity Commission has certain powers to undertake investigations into UK reg-
istered charities under the Charities Act 1993. Under this law the Charity Commission
will consider complaints and concerns which are supported by evidence. Among those
areas which may lead to complaints are:
the funds or other assets of the charity are being used in improper ways;
the charity is undertaking improper political activities.
The Charity Commission has the power during the course of its investigations to freeze
the bank accounts of any registered UK charity.
Are natural or legal persons other than banks (e.g. attorneys, notaries and other inter-
mediaries in general) required to report suspicious transactions to the public authorities,
and if so, what are the penalties attached if such persons omit to report either wilfully or
by negligence?
Yes. Under Section 38 of the Terrorism Act 2000, as amended by section 117 of the
Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, if a person believes or suspects that a
transaction is suspicious based on information that comes to his or her attention in the
course of trade, profession, business or employment, he or she is obliged to report it
as soon as is reasonably practicable to a constable. However, information obtained in
privileged circumstances by a professional legal adviser:
from a client’s representative, in connection with the provisions of legal advice by the
adviser to the client;
from a person seeking legal advice from the adviser, or from the person’s representative,
or;
from any person, for the purpose of actual or contemplated legal proceedings is
exempt. Any person found guilty of the oﬀence shall be liable to imprisonment of up
to ﬁve years, a ﬁne, or both.
Under a further enhancement to the disclosure provision enacted in the Anti-Terrorism,
Crime and Security Act 2001, if a person has reasonable grounds to suspect (or knows
or suspects) the fund-raising, use, possession, or laundering of money related to terror-
ism based on information which comes to the person in the course of business in the
regulated ﬁnancial sector, he or she is obliged to report this as soon as is practicable to
a constable.

• Sub-paragraph 2 (a): The report outlines restrictions on the export of weapons from the
UK but does not indicate how UK law regulates the sale of weapons within the UK. The
CTC would be grateful for information on this.
The main control is the Firearms Act 1968, which divides ﬁrearms into four broad
categories: Prohibited Weapons under Section 5 of the Act. This includes machine
guns, most self-loading riﬂes, rocketlaunchers, and weapons that ‘discharge any nox-
ious liquid, gas or other thing’. These can only be held under the authority of the
Secretrary of State for Home Aﬀairs, granted by the Home Oﬃce to those who have
need to trade in or handle these weapons (e.g. defence manufacturers). Following the
Dunblane shootings, most handguns were raised to this category by the Firearms
(Amendment) Act 1997.
Firearms described in Section 1 of the Act may be held on a ﬁrearms certiﬁcate,
which is issued by the local police. This includes most hunting and target riﬂes, long
barrelled pump-action shotguns and muzzle-loading pistols. The police must be satis-
ﬁed that the applicant can be trusted to possess ﬁrearms, and that he has a ‘good
reason’ for possessing them. Target shooting and game shooting are generally con-
sidered good reasons. Firearms certiﬁcates are not issued for self-defence to residents
of mainland Britain.
Shotguns described in Section 2 of the 1968 Act may be held on a shotgun certi-
ﬁcate, which is issued by the local police. Shotguns of this kind must be long-barrelled
and have a limited or no magazine. The police must be satisﬁed that the applicant can
be trusted to have a shotgun, but the applicant does not have to prove that he has a
particular good reason to possess the gun. Shotguns of this kind are commonly used
for vermin control, game shooting, and for shooting at clay targets.
Low-powered air guns, that is to say guns with a muzzle energy of less than 6ft/1bs
for pistols and 12 ft/1bs for other guns, are not subject to certiﬁcate control, though
there are controls on their use by young people. A person wishing to trade in ﬁrearms
must be registered as a ﬁrearms dealer with his local police. The police must be satisﬁed
that the person concerned can be trusted to deal in guns, that he has a genuine proposed
business, and that the security of his premises is suﬃcient. A dealer must keep records
of the ﬁrearms he trades in.
Please outline the measures, both legislative and practical, preventing entities and indi-
viduals from recruiting, collecting funds or soliciting other forms of support for terrorist
activities to be carried out inside or outside the United Kingdom, including, in particular:
—
the carrying out, within or from the UK, of recruiting, collecting of funds and soliciting
of other forms of support from other countries; and
—
deceptive activities such as recruitment based on a representation to the recruit that
the purpose of the recruitment is one (e.g. teaching) diﬀerent from the true purpose
and collection of funds through front organisations.
Thirty-four terrorist organisations are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. Under
the Act it is an oﬀence for a person to:
belong to or profess to belong to a proscribed organisation;
invite support for a proscribed organisation;
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
81
 

dress or to wear, carry or display an article in such a way or in such circumstances as to
arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a member of a proscribed organisation.
The maximum sentence for these oﬀences in 10 years’ imprisonment. The oﬀences in
the Act more generally apply to anyone planning or supporting in the UK terrorist acts
anywhere in the world, whether or not the organisation to which they belong has been
proscribed. It is also an oﬀence under the Act to recruit people in the UK in order for
them to receive training abroad in the use of ﬁrearms and explosives for terrorist
purposes. It is also an oﬀence to raise funds, or provide money where it is intended
or suspected that the money will be used for a terrorist purpose. See also the reply to
question 1(d), third tiret, on charities.
Sub-paragraph 2 (c): The CTC would be grateful to know whether there is a conﬂict
between the use of the Immigration Act 1971 for the removal of individuals mentioned
in this sub-paragraph and the requirements of Article 3 of the European Convention on
Human Rights.
As the UK’s report S/2001/1232 pointed out, the international obligations of the
United Kingdom under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights pre-
vent deportation in certain circumstances, including in some cases where the relevant
powers of the Immigration Act 1971 would otherwise be exercisable. In such cases,
deportation is not carried out.
The report states that where removal is not a realistic possibility, the Anti-Terrorism and
Security Act provides for indeﬁnite detention of such persons in the UK. Does this mean
indeﬁnite detention in prison?
Yes. Because of the limited nature of the derogation form Article 5 ECHR, which
underpins the power to detain indeﬁnitely, the power is only exercised when detention
is a measure strictly required by the exigencies of the public emergency threatening the
life of the nation.
• Sub-paragraph 2 (e): Please could the UK provide a list of the minimum and maximum
penalties as provided for under the laws which give eﬀect to this sub-paragraph.
In general, apart from a few speciﬁc oﬀences under the Terrorism Act 2000 and Anti-
Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, there are no ‘terrorist’ oﬀences under UK law.
Terrorists are usually tried under ‘normal’ criminal legislation. Attachment III of the
UK’s earlier response to the Counter-Terrorism Committee of 19 December 2001 lists
the criminal oﬀences covered by the Suppression of Terrorism Act 1978, which enabled
the UK to ratify the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.
It is a general principle that the UK does not have minimum sentences, apart from
murder, which has a mandatory minimum sentence of life. However, there are a limited
number of mandatory sentences set for serious repeat oﬀending. These include an
automatic life sentence for a second serious violent or sexual oﬀence.
With regard to the oﬀences listed in Attachment III of the UK response of
19 December 2001, the following are examples of the maximum sentence available for
those oﬀences:

See also the reply to the question on sub-paragraph 3 (d) below, which includes, in the
case of relevant international conventions and protocols against terrorism, a description
of the relevant criminal oﬀences in UK law and the appropriate penalties.
Sub-paragraph 2 (f): Is there any legislative enactment governing mutual assistance, or is
this only governed through bilateral and multilateral arrangements?
The Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 provides the general
framework for provision of mutual legal assistance, and we do not require the existence
of a bilateral or multilateral agreement in order to provide assistance to another coun-
try (although we would normally expect reciprocity). The exception is for restraint and
conﬁscation of assets, for which we do require the existence of a bilateral or multilateral
agreement.
The 1990 Act will shortly be amended in order to enable the UK to ratify the 2000
EU Convention on Mutual Assistance.
Sub-paragraph 2 (g): Please outline the measures in place to give eﬀect to this sub-
paragraph.
The Government informally sought clariﬁcation from the CTC’s independent experts
on the information required that, in their opinion, was not adequately covered in
S/2001/1232. The experts explained that in the context of several European countries
having legislation on personal identity cards, the lack of this in the UK could be seen
as a vulnerability in the ﬁght against terrorism, with particular regard to the movement
of terrorists. The answer below therefore addresses this issue. After the terrorist atroci-
ties in the United States on 11 September 2001, the issue of introducing an identity
card scheme was raised by many people and attracted a considerable degree of media
comment. At the time the Government was not planning to introduce an identity card
scheme as part of its response to the events of 11 September 2001, but the policy was
being kept under review. It was considering whether a universal entitlement card,
which could allow people to prove their identity more easily and provide a simple way
to access a range of public services, would be beneﬁcial. The Government also said
that a scheme could help to combat illegal working and it could also reduce fraud
against individuals, public services and the private sector.
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
83
 

The Government has made clear that the introduction of an entitlement card would
be a major step and that it would not proceed without consulting widely and consider-
ing all the views expressed very carefully. It announced on 5 February 2002 that it
intends to publish a consultation paper by the summer. This will cover the whole issue
of identity fraud and a range of possible responses in the short, medium and long-
term, including the advantages and disadvantages of an entitlement card scheme—but
also other measures which might be taken to improve the security of existing forms of
identiﬁcation issued by the Government. One of the options, which the Government
has already ruled out, is making the failure to carry an entitlement card an oﬀence.
The Government does not consider that an entitlement card scheme would have
a signiﬁcant eﬀect in combating terrorism in the United Kingdom, although in the
long term, a scheme might make it more diﬃcult for terrorists to operate under false
identities. However, in the short to medium term entitlement cards would not have a
signiﬁcant eﬀect in combating terrorism due to the fact that it would be many years
before cards were widely held. In addition some terrorists would be able to hold a card
legitimately and there is the possibility that cards could be counterfeited by highly
organised terrorists with suﬃcient resources.
Sub-paragraph 3 (a), (b) and (c): The report sets out the machinery for the exchange of
operational information within the European Union (EU) and with the UN, NATO and
OSCE. Please also describe how the UK exchanges information with countries which
are not members of the EU, NATO or OSCE. Is information exchanged under bilateral
treaties or are other administrative arrangements used?
The UK Central Authority (UKCA), based in the Home Oﬃce, is the designated
central authority for all requests for mutual assistance in criminal (including terrorist)
investigations both in and outside the UK. Requests for assistance (both in and out-
side) come to the Home Oﬃce and are examined and then acted upon by staﬀ in the
UKCA.
Requests going overseas from the UK are relatively simple to aciton. The request
is reviewed and (if all is found to be in order) it is transmitted overseas, usually to a
Ministry of Justice in the country concerned, although certain requests are sent out via
the UK’s Embassy or High Commission overseas.
Requests coming into the UK require an assessment as to the assistance sought, and
how it can best be provided.
There are a number of options, depending on the nature of the assistance required.
For example, the request may be best dealt with by the police if it related to an alleged
criminal oﬀence having been committed overseas, or Her Majesty’s Customs and
Excise if the information requested related to an illegal drugs matter. When evidence is
obtained within the UK it is sent to the UKCA and then transmitted to the requesting
authority. Evidence obtained overseas is sent to the requesting authority in the UK,
also via the UKCA. As explained in the answer above to the question under sub-
paragraph 2 (f), the UK does not require the existence of a bilateral or multilateral
agreement in order to provide assistance to another country (although we would
normally expect reciprocity). There are however, a number of treaties (for example,
with most European States, the USA, and SAR Hong Kong) which govern the Mutual
Legal Assistance process between the parties. As referred to in the reply to the question
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
84
 
www.ebook3000.com

on sub-paragraph 2 (f) above, The Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) Act
1990 is the domestic legislation that provides the framework for the work of the UK
Central Authority.
Sub-paragraph 3 (d): It is noted that the UK has ratiﬁed all twelve of the relevant
international global conventions and protocols relating to terrorism. As the practice of
enforcing these ratiﬁed conventions diﬀers among countries, please explain how these
conventions and protocols are enforced (through separate enactments or by incorporation
into relevant existing laws)?
Treaties do not automatically form part of UK law, and, therefore, before ratifying any
treaty the UK must consider whether any amendment of domestic law is required to
give eﬀect to the obligations that it contains.
This will involve an examination of whether the existing common law or statutory
provisions are suﬃcient to implement the treaty in question, and, if not, legislation
will be required to make the necessary amendments. The way in which the main provi-
sions of the twelve international Counter-Terrorism Conventions and the European
Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism are implemented, is set out in Annex I of
this report.
Sub-paragraph 3 (e): Please could the UK provide a copy of the pieces of model legisla-
tion mentioned in the report and a progress report on their implementation in the overseas
territories.
The UK intends to have the Order made for all its Overseas Territories (except
Bermuda, Cayman and Gibraltar, which are legislating locally, but may use the order
as a model for their own legislation) in July. The UK shall send a copy of the Order to
the CTC once it has been made.
Please state whether the crimes referred to in the relevant international conventions
and protocols relating to terrorism are all extraditable oﬀences in bilateral extradition
treaties.
See the answer above to the question on sub-paragraph 3 (d). However it is important
to note that the UK is made of three diﬀerent law districts, namely (i) England and
Wales, (ii) Scotland, and (iii) Northern Ireland. Whilst primary legislation that has
been introduced speciﬁcally to implement treaty obligations will usually apply in all
three law districts, aspects of substantive and procedural criminal law diﬀer consider-
ably in each. For the sake of brevity, this reply sets out the position in England and
Wales. Implementation of the Conventions diﬀers in a number of respects in Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Furthermore, legislation needs to be enacted in order to extend
the conventions to the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories. The ﬁrst ﬁve
conventions detailed below have been extended to all of these territories; the process
of extending the remaining seven is on-going.
Sub-paragraph 3 (f): What is the remedy for a third country whose terrorists are by
mistake or otherwise admitted into the UK?
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
85
 

Third countries can request extradition. Extradition to and from the United Kingdom
is governed by the Extradition Act 1989 (‘the 1989 Act’). The UK has extradition
arrangements with its designated Commonwealth partners (schedule 3 of the Act), the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Republic of Ireland and foreign states
that have been designated by an order in council (schedule 4 of the Act). The UK can
make special extradition arrangements for requests from any state under section 15.
Requests to the United Kingdom can be made in two ways: a provisional arrest
warrant, which is generally made through police channels as a matter of urgency, or a
full order request, which is submitted through the diplomatic channel in advance of the
arrest. These should consist of the particulars of the person whose return is requested,
particulars of the oﬀence of which he is accused or was convicted, a warrant or a duly
authenticated copy of a warrant for his arrest issued in the requesting state, or for a
provisional arrest, details of such a warrant, in the case of a person unlawfully at large
after conviction of an oﬀence, a certiﬁcate or a duly authenticated copy of a certiﬁcate
of the conviction and the sentence, or for provisional arrest, details of the conviction.
Where a request is made for the provisional arrest of a fugitive, the fugitive will be
arrested before an authority or an order to proceed (ATP/OTP) is signed. He is
brought before the District Judge, who sets an initial period for the receipt of the
formal extradition request and supporting documents, and the signing of the ATP/
OTP by the Secretary of State. If the request is not received within this period, or if the
requisite supporting documents are not supplied, the fugitive is released immediately.
Where a full order request is made through the diplomatic channel, the ATP/OTP is
signed before the fugitive is arrested by the Secretary of State. At the resulting com-
mittal hearing, the request is considered. The District Judge must be satisﬁed that the
documents have been correctly authenticated and certiﬁed, that the ATP/OTP relates
to an extradition crime and that none of the prohibitions on return applies. If so, he is
required to commit the fugitive to await the Secretary of State’s decision as to whether
to order the fugitive’s return. In both Commonwealth and bilateral treaty cases, prima
facie evidence is required at the committal hearing. Following committal, the fugitive
has 15 days to appeal against the District Judge’s decision to commit him by applying
to the Divisional Court for a writ of habeas corpus. If this is dismissed, the fugitive can
appeal to the House of Lords, as can the requesting state. Once all the stages before the
courts have been completed, the case returns to the Secretary of State to make a
decision within two months on whether to order surrender. If the Secretary of State is
satisﬁed that there are no statutory bars to the fugitive’s extradition, and there appears
to be no other reason why extradition would be wrong, unjust or oppressive he may sign
an order for the fugitive’s return. The fugitive may apply for permission to seek judicial
review of the Secretary of State’s decision. If an application is made, the fugitive will
not be surrendered while the judicial review proceedings are pending. If evidence
becomes available after the grant of refugee status, which indicates that the person
concerned is a terrorist and had committed acts of terrorism prior to entry to the UK,
action to cancel refugee status would be considered under the exclusion provisions in
Article 1F of the 1951 Refugee Convention. If the exclusion criteria in Article 1F were
satisﬁed, refugee status would be withdrawn prior to the person’s being returned to
stand trial. Article 1F could be applied similarly if, in the course of considering an
asylum application, evidence was available to indicate that the person had engaged in
terrorist activity abroad. In either case removal to the extraditing country would be
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
86

subject to there being no infringement of the individual’s rights under the ECHR, in
particular Article 3, and to all appeal rights in the United Kingdom being exhausted.
Sub-paragraph 3 (g): Will the legislation on extradition to be introduced early in 2002
remove all geographical restrictions to the waiver of the political oﬀence exception?
The current position, under section 24 of the Extradition Act 1989, is that no oﬀence
to which section 1 of the Suppression of Terrorism Act 1978 applies shall be regarded
as an oﬀence of a political character. As amended by section 64 of the Terrorism
Act 2000, the Extradition Act 1989 provides that, in relation to requests from certain
countries, particular oﬀences cannot be regarded as oﬀences to which the political
oﬀence exception can apply. The oﬀences cover a wide variety of serious crimes such as
murder, manslaughter, rape, kidnapping, arson, various oﬀences against the person,
abduction, taking of hostages, explosives oﬀences, ﬁrearms oﬀences, oﬀences against
property, oﬀences in relation to ships, aircraft, oil rigs and the channel tunnel together
with attempts and conspiracy to commit such oﬀences. These provisions apply world
wide. The new extradition legislation, which has been delayed slightly beyond the
original timetable, will be consistent with this position.
Paragraph 4
The CTC would be grateful to know if the UK government has addressed any of the
concerns in paragraph 4, as far as it concerns money laundering and narcotics.
DRUGS
The United Kingdom is at the forefront of international eﬀorts to combat trans-
national organised crime and illicit drugs. Since September 11 we have enhanced our
eﬀorts to break the linkage between international terrorism and organised crime. In
particular the UK has established a Fund to provide technical assistance to countries
that wish to combat Drugs and Crime. The budget of this Fund has increased by 37%
in the last year. We have also signiﬁcantly increased our ﬁnancial contribution to the
UNDCP in Vienna (the UK has consistently been amongst the ﬁve largest donors).
The UK has also taken a particularly active role in combating the drugs industry in
Afghanistan which has in recent years been closely linked to terrorism. We have pro-
vided support to the Interim Administration for its crop eradication programme. We
are also working with the Afghan government to
•
create eﬀective drugs law enforcement
•
build the right institutions within Afghanistan to tackle addiction and provide
treatment and demand reduction
•
ensure that the peoples of districts previously dependent on opium cultivation are
oﬀered alternative livelihoods, not just in agriculture but also in other sectors.
The UK is a party to the three main drugs Conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988) and
lobbies for the widest possible adherence to these instruments which set the framework
for international co-operation in this ﬁeld. The UK was also one of the ﬁrst countries to
ratify the UN Convention against Transnational Crime (UNTOC) which provides for
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
87
 

what is potentially a world wide framework for co-operation against organised crime.
We have also organised a number of seminars to encourage its ratiﬁcation by others.
MONEY LAUNDERING
The United Kingdom is a leading member of the Financial Action Task Force and
fully supports its 40 Recommendations on money laundering and 8 Special Recom-
mendations on terrorist ﬁnancing. Apart from a wide-ranging bilateral programme on
technical assistance, the UK supports a number of multilateral initiatives.
•
The Caribbean Anti-money Laundering Programme (CALP) in partnership
with the US and EU
•
The ASEM anti-money laundering initiative in South East Asia in partnership
with the EU and the Netherlands
•
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) in partnership with the US,
Canada, France, Netherlands, Spain and Mexico
•
The Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG)
in partnership with the Commonwealth Secretariat and the US
•
The Council of Europe’s PC-R-EV Committee
•
The Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) in partnership
with Canada, US, IMF, UNDP, Caribbean Development Bank, Inter-American
Development Bank, and the World Bank
•
The Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) in partnership
with Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, the World Bank and the IMF.
Additionally, the UK has, on various occasions, provided technical experts to speak
in international fora to sensitise the international community on the challenges in the
battle against money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing.
Other matters:
Could the United Kingdom please provide an organisational chart of its administrative
machinery, such as police, immigration control, customs, taxation and ﬁnancial supervi-
sion authorities, established to give practical eﬀect to the laws regulations and other
documents that are seen as contributing to compliance with the Resolution.
The UK does not have an organisational chart as such, but hopes the following
information is useful. UK policy on international terrorism is co-ordinated by an inter-
departmental committee of oﬃcials (TIDO(O)), which is chaired by the Foreign &
Commonwealth Oﬃce. The Cabinet Oﬃce, the Home Oﬃce, the Ministry of Defence,
HM Treasury, HM Customs and Excise, the Department for Trade and Industry, the
Police Service and the Intelligence Agencies are all represented on the committee,
which reports to Ministers as necessary. Coordination of policy towards the ﬁnancial
aspects of terrorism is carried out by a diﬀerent oﬃcial committee (TIDO(TF)), which
is chaired by the Home Oﬃce, and whose membership includes: HM Treasury, the
Financial Services Authority, and the Bank of England. The committee reports regularly
to Ministers. In addition to these standing arrangements, in response to a particular
threat or emergency, and subject to a decision by Ministers, the Cabinet Oﬃce would

establish a permanently-manned crisis management centre (COBR) to co-ordinate the
UK’s response. The expertise of government departments, the intelligence agencies,
the police, the military, scientiﬁc and other specialist advice, local authorities and
the emergency services would be drawn on as appropriate. The Home Secretary has
ministerial responsibility for the police and Immigration Service, and counter-terrorist
policy within the UK. The Home Oﬃce is therefore the focal point for the response
to the terrorist threat, both through legislative measures and counter-terrorist contin-
gency planning. As part of this response, the Home Oﬃce is responsible for a set of
classiﬁed contingency plans that cover the full range of terrorist scenarios. These plans
are well prepared, regularly tested, reviewed and updated in the light of changing
domestic and international circumstances.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Oﬃce has responsibility for UK government
policy on counter-terrorism issues in international and regional fora and for the main-
streaming of counter-terrorism co-operation and assistance in UK bilateral relations
with other states.
HM Treasury is responsible in the UK for implementing ﬁnancial measures against
terrorists. SI 3365(2001) empowers the Chancellor of the Exchequer to freeze the assets
of individuals and organisations where there are reasonable grounds to suspect they
are involved in terrorist activities. The assets freeze list is published on the Bank of
England’s website. The Bank maintains a circulation list of over 600 banks and trade
associations to draw their attention to any changes in sanctions information published
on the Bank’s website. The Department of Trade and Industry has responsibility for
all aspects relating to export control matters including issues such as legislation and
licensing policy. HM Customs and Excise has the lead responsibility for detecting
prohibited and restricted goods at import and export, including those goods that may
be used by terrorists. Customs Oﬃcers are also Examining Oﬃcers under Anti-Terrorist
legislation under which they provide information and intelligence to the lead counter
terrorism agencies described above and have power to seize terrorist-linked cash
anywhere in the UK.

of Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001
Sub-paragraph 1.2: Please provide a report on the progress made in enacting the legislation
on extradition referred to in the ﬁrst report in relation to sub-paragraph 3 (g).
The Extradition Bill was introduced into the Houses of Parliament on the 14th
November 2002. The Extradition Bill should implement the fast track system of sur-
render between fellow EU Member States (the Council Framework Decision on the
European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States 2002/
584/JHA) and streamline the extradition procedure for all its other extradition partners.
It will be considered by both Houses of Parliament in the normal way.
The Extradition Bill proposes to remove the political oﬀence exception completely
from UK extradition law, in line with our commitments under UN Security Council
Resolution 1373.
Sub-paragraph 2.3: The CTC would be grateful to be kept informed of any bilateral or
multilateral (assistance) arrangements and their outcome, as well as any changes to the
oﬀer of assistance.
Over the past twelve months the UK has delivered counter-terrorism assistance to a
signiﬁcant number of countries around the world to improve their capabilities to deter,
detain or disrupt terrorist groups in support of full implementation of United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1373. This has been part of a broad programme of counter
terrorism-related assistance, worth some £1.5m.
The programme has included training in operational counter-terrorism policing
methods, crisis management, the drafting of counter-terrorism legislation, the counter-
ing of terrorist ﬁnancing, aviation security, and bomb disposal skills in countries from

to continue this programme in the coming Financial Year and to expand it to include
other areas such as charity regulatory mechanisms and law enforcement on terrorist
ﬁnancing.

1.1 Eﬀective implementation of sub-paragraph 1 (a) requires States to have in place
eﬀective executive machinery for preventing and suppressing the ﬁnancing of terrorist
acts. In this regard does the United Kingdom provide training to its administrative,
investigative, prosecutorial and judicial authorities on the enforcement of laws related to:
— typologies and trends in terrorist ﬁnancing methods and techniques:
Training to law enforcement oﬃcers in techniques for the investigation of terrorist
ﬁnancing is provided by the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit (NTFIU)
of the Metropolitan Police. The course is oﬀered to oﬃcers who have already been
trained, and have experience, as ﬁnancial investigators. The course covers UK counter
terrorist legislation, typologies, trends, and gives an awareness of the other agencies
and bodies that can have a role to play in countering terrorist ﬁnance. The course’s
aims and objectives are to enable students to eﬀectively undertake enquiries into
terrorist ﬁnancing and fundraising and be able, at the end of the course, to identify
legislation relevant to the investigation of terrorist ﬁnancing. Trained oﬃcers will have
an awareness of the practical aspects of the investigation of terrorist ﬁnancing and will
be able to use the legislation correctly, and specify and utilise correctly the structures/
organisations in the UK which target terrorist ﬁnancing.
— techniques for tracing property which represents the proceeds of crime or is being used
to ﬁnance terrorism with a view to ensuring that such property is seized, frozen and
conﬁscated?
Techniques for tracing property are taught to all UK ﬁnancial investigators as part of
their basic ﬁnancial investigators course. This course is now run by the Assets Recovery
Agency.
What mechanisms/programs does the United Kingdom have in place to train the diﬀerent
economic sectors as to how to detect suspicious and unusual transactions related to
terrorist activities and to prevent the movement of illicit money?
As part of the UK’s response to the attacks of 11 September 2001, a multiagency
working group, the Financial Services Contact Group (FSCG) was established. The
FSCG promotes an eﬀective two-way dialogue between the ﬁnancial services sector
and law enforcement/intelligence agencies in order to deny terrorist organisations
access to ﬁnancial systems and products.
Over the past two years the FSCG has established liaison points within many sectors
of the ﬁnancial industry, including the Insurance, Investment Banking, and Personal
Finance sectors. The FSCG has also been working particularly closely with the retail
banking sector in proﬁling and assisting the industry to detect and report potentially
terrorist-related suspicious ﬁnancial activity.
In order to increase the eﬀectiveness of the Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)
regime in combating the use of UK ﬁnancial systems by terrorist organisations, the
FSCG is extending its outreach programme to additional vulnerable sectors of the
ﬁnancial industry (including Money Services Businesses and Credit Card Providers) in
order to ensure that the industry is provided with relevant and timely indicators of
terrorist ﬁnance activity.

1.2 Could the United Kingdom please elaborate on the functions of the agencies, which are
responsible for the implementation of sub-paragraphs 1 (a), (c) and (d) of the Resolution
and the legislative provisions for whose enforcement they are responsible? Could the
UK provide similar information in relation to its Overseas Territories and Crown
Dependencies? How does the United Kingdom ensure that there is adequate co-operation
and sharing of information among the diﬀerent government agencies which may be
involved in investigating the ﬁnancing of terrorism (e.g. police, customs, Financial
Intelligence Unit (FIU) and/or other competent authorities)? Has the United Kingdom
established any appropriate mechanism (such as a ‘task force’) to this end?
In the UK, the bodies at the day to day forefront against terrorist ﬁnancing are the
Security Service, the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit (NTFIU) and
the Terrorist Finance Unit of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). The
importance of multi-agency co-ordination in this ﬁeld cannot be underestimated.
The Security Service is the lead agency for combating international terrorism in the
UK and Irish-related terrorism outside of Northern Ireland. It plays a key role in
informing Government policy on terrorist ﬁnance and in intelligence-led investigations.
The Service works closely with NTFIU, NCIS, HM Customs and Excise and the UK
police forces as well as overseas partners.
NTFIU is the law enforcement agency responsible for investigation of terrorist
ﬁnance in Great Britain. It supplies experienced terrorist ﬁnance investigators to the
terrorist Finance Team at NCIS. The Unit has two key objectives:
•
To examine ﬁnancial disclosures submitted to NCIS for possible terrorist connec-
tions and to combine this data with intelligence from other sources. The combined
ﬁnancial intelligence packages produced are referred for further investigative work
by the NTFIU and intelligence agencies.
•
To work with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to develop intelligence led
methodologies to help inform future work on terrorist ﬁnancing and where
appropriate share with and provide guidance to the ﬁnancial sector.
At the centre of the UK Government, leading roles in developing policies to combat
the ﬁnancing of terrorism are taken by HM Treasury, the Home Oﬃce and the Foreign
and Commonwealth Oﬃce. The Treasury implements United Nations ﬁnancial sanc-
tions regimes using their powers under the relevant Order in Council. Sanctions are
enforced by the Sanctions Unit at the Bank of England. Individuals and organisations
who have been listed or who are suspected of facilitating terrorist acts are listed on the
sanctions page of the Bank of England website (www.bankofengland.co.uk).
In the last two years new organisational networks and structures have been put in
place across all areas of Government involved in this issue providing more focus
for multi-agency initiatives to be brought to bear. All departments and agencies
involved in the ﬁght against terrorism are committed to eﬀective multilateral working
to enable eﬀective monitoring of progress and regular review of areas requiring further
development.
The UK ﬁnancial services industry also provides a vital contribution to the ﬁght
against terrorist activity. Financial institutions have directed signiﬁcant resources in
response to national and international enquiries and law enforcement oﬃcers have
worked closely and constructively with a wide range of compliance departments.

1.3 Could the United Kingdom please inform the CTC whether the relevant provisions of
the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 have been
implemented in the Overseas Territories, as indicated in its ﬁrst report (at page 4)? Is the
United Kingdom liable for the ﬁnancial system of the Overseas Territories?
An Order in Council (S.I. 2002/1822) making provision for certain Overseas Territories,
namely Anguilla, the Falkland Islands, Montserrat, St Helena and Dependencies, the
Turks and Caicos Islands and the British Virgin Islands, corresponding to various
provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security
Act 2001 came into force on 1 August 2002. The Cayman Islands, Bermuda and
Gibraltar are putting in place their own legislation corresponding to the 2000 and
2001 Acts.
1.4 The CTC notes from the schedule 2 of Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001
that some activities are excluded from the obligation to report to the UK’s competent
authorities about suspicious transactions. In this regard the CTC would appreciate an
outlining of the UK’s legal provisions and administrative mechanism which prevent those
activities, with particular regard to corporate services providers, from being used for the
purpose of the ﬁnancing of terrorism. In relation to money laundering and the ﬁnancing
of terrorism could the United Kingdom provide an outline of any special strategy which
may have developed with a view to enabling its investigation agencies to eﬀectively prevent
resources from being transferred to terrorists? (To prevent for example under-invoicing
of exports and the over-invoicing of imports, manipulation of transactions of real estate,
high value assets and insurance).
Under this schedule, those businesses excluded from the regulated sector are required
to report suspicious activity under section 19 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The ‘reason-
able grounds test’ does not apply as for the regulated sector. The Proceeds of Crime
Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000 require any such examples of suspicious activity
to be reported to NCIS. If deemed suitable, such reports would then be investigated by
the appropriate Law Enforcement Agency.
1.5 Sub-paragraph 1 (a) of the resolution requires ﬁnancial institutions and other inter-
mediaries to identify their clients and to report suspicious ﬁnancial transactions to the
relevant authorities. In this regard would the United Kingdom please provide the CTC
with the number of suspicious transactions reports (STRs) received by the UK’s com-
petent authorities since 2001, the number of STRs analysed and disseminated, as well as
the number of STRs which have led to investigations, prosecutions or convictions. The
CTC would appreciate receiving information as to whether any cases involving failure to
comply with reporting obligations have been detected and whether any sanctions have
been imposed.
The STR’s received by the NCIS Terrorist Finance Team are disclosed under either the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 or the Terrorism Act 2000. In 2002 the NCIS Terrorist
Finance Team had a total of 4,786 STRs referred to it which were judged to have
potential links to terrorism. Of this total, 556 were referred to NTFIU for further
investigation. In 2003 the number of STR’s referred to the TFT fell to 2,792, of which
632 were passed onto NTFIU.
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

In 2002 and 2003 almost 1,200 STRs have been allocated to the NTFIU for investi-
gation. All have been investigated to a greater or lesser extent. Between 20% and 30%
of those allocated have either initiated a longer-term investigation, or added substan-
tially to an existing investigation. Prosecutions and convictions have arisen from STRs,
but data is not held that would enable ﬁgures to be produced. It is worth noting that
the STR process contributes greatly to the acquisition and development of intelligence.
Concentrating on prosecutions and convictions falls short of looking at the value of
the system as a whole.
No cases involving failure to comply with reporting obligations have been detected
in relation to terrorist activity.
1.6 With regard to the eﬀective implementation of paragraph 1 (d) of the Resolution, the
CTC would be grateful to know whether the United Kingdom has taken judicial action
against a non-proﬁt organisation, based on suspected involvement in terrorist ﬁnancing?
If yes, please outline the relevant procedures as well as the outcome of such actions.
The CTC would also welcome examples of cases in which sanctions have been enforced
against such organisations.
The Charity Commission is the charity regulator for England and Wales. The regula-
tion regime encompasses some 180,000 charities, plus an unknown number of others,
which, mainly because of their small incomes do not need to register. The Commission
has extensive powers of regulation, including powers to require production of informa-
tion, to freeze bank accounts, to suspend or remove trustees and to investigate and
rectify wrongdoing in charities.
The Charity Commission is a quasi-judicial department in that it has a range of
powers that it can exercise on behalf of the High Court. Although the Commission has
used these powers against charities suspected of being involved in the ﬁnancing of
terrorism no cases have come before the Courts.
The Commission is not a prosecuting authority and does not investigate
criminal activities. Nevertheless the ﬁnancing of terrorism clearly cannot be
charitable and would amount to misconduct or mismanagement, which would
allow the Commission to act to protect a charity’s assets. It is important to realise
that the Commission’s role is not punitive in nature. Where misconduct or mis-
management are found, and there is a need to protect the future assets of a charity, the
Commission will use temporary powers to, for example, freeze assets, and then
remedial powers to, for example, appoint new trustees or to pass the assets to another
similar charity. If criminal oﬀences are suspected then information will be passed to
the police.
The assets of a handful of charities have been frozen whilst inquiries take place. In
the case of one charity that was suspected of funding terrorism in Iran, the assets were
eﬀectively conﬁscated and passed to another charity with similar objects. Although
the matter was passed to the police, along with allegation of various oﬀences under the
Charities Act 1993, the police declined to take any action.
In another case, where a charity is suspected of funding terrorism in Sri Lanka, the
charity has had its assets frozen for the last two years and a Receiver and Manager
appointed to run the charity and its activities. The Commission is currently considering
the appointment of a new body of trustees.

and in Northern Ireland by the Department for Social Development.
1.7 In regard to the implementation of sub-paragraphs 1 (a) and (c) of the Resolution, as
well as Article 8 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism, the CTC would be grateful if the United Kingdom could outline the principal
procedures embodied in its laws in relation to the conﬁscation of assets or the operation
of some other deprivation mechanism. Please describe how these procedures operate in
practice, indicating, inter alia, the authorities responsible for their implementation. Can
the UK conﬁscate the proceeds of a crime without ﬁrst obtaining the conviction of the
perpetrator (i.e. in rem conﬁscation)? If not, is the introduction of such a system envis-
aged? The CTC would also welcome an account of any appellate provisions allowing for
the review of decisions taken by any such authority or agency. Please indicate the ﬁnan-
cial magnitude of the assets frozen, seized or conﬁscated in regard to the prevention of
ﬁnancing of terrorism.
The legal provisions for asset freezing are determined at UN level ﬁrst and then imple-
mented at EU and domestic level. The relevant legal provisions at (i) UN, (ii) EU and
(iii) domestic level for (a) freezing assets of organisations/individuals linked to terrorism
in general (b) freezing assets of organisations/individuals linked to Al’Qaida and the
Taliban are:
•
Freezing assets of organisations/individuals linked to terrorism in general
•
European Council Regulation 2580/01—implements UNSCR 1373 at EU level.
Under these powers the assets of external terrorists (i.e. where the focus of operation
is external to the Community) can be frozen throughout the EU.
•
Terrorism Order 2001—implements UNSCR 1373 domestically. Article 4(1)
of the Terrorism Order states that where the Treasury have reasonable grounds
to suspect that the person by, for or on behalf of whom any funds are held is or
may be
(a) a person who commits, attempts to commit, facilitates or participates in the
commission of acts of terrorism,
(b) a person controlled or owned directly or indirectly by a person in (a),
(c) a person acting on behalf, or at the direction, of a person in (a), or
(d) a person on the list (of natural and legal persons, groups and entities) in Article
1 of the Council Decision 2003/646/EC which implements Article 2(3) of EC
Regulation 2580/01. The Treasury may by notice direct that those funds are
not made available to any person, except under the authority of a license
granted by the Treasury under this article. Article 3 of the Terrorism Order
makes it an oﬀence to make any funds available to a person/entity whose assets
have been frozen under Article 4(1) except under the authority of a licence
granted by the Treasury.
•
Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001—Part 2 of this Act creates a new
power which enables the Treasury to freeze the assets of overseas governments or
residents who have taken, or are likely to take, action to the detriment of the UK’s
economy or action constituting a threat to the life or property of a national or
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

resident of the UK. For freezing assets of organisations/individuals linked to
Usama bin Laden, Al’Qaida and the Taliban
•
Al’Qaida and Taliban Order 2002—implements UNSCR 1267, 1390, 1455, 1526
domestically. When acting under the Al’Qaida and Taliban Order, the Treasury has
to have reasonable grounds to suspect that the person by, for or on behalf of whom
funds are held is or may be
(a) Usama bin Laden,
(b) A person designated by the Sanctions Committee in its Consolidated list as:
(i)
a member of Al’Qaida
(ii) a member of the Taliban; or
(iii) an individual, group, undertaking or entity associated with any of the
persons covered by (a), (b)(i) or (b)(ii), a person acting on behalf of a
person in (a) or (b).
AMOUNTS FROZEN
There is currently £336,477.05 held frozen in 37 accounts in the UK ﬁnancial institu-
tions pursuant to EC Regulations No 2580/2001 and No 881/2002. Both before and
after September 11, 2001 the UK froze a total of around £70 ($100) million of terrorist
assets. Following the liberation of Kabul, the bulk has been unfrozen and made avail-
able to the legitimate Government of Afghanistan. N.B. The total funds frozen ﬁgure
includes £16,963.57 (GBP + USD) where banks have frozen funds of possible not
positive matches. In addition, some debit balances have been reported (i.e. credit cards
balances or overdrafts). These debit balances total £3,447.55. The total funds frozen
ﬁgure reﬂects credit balances only.
APPELLATE PROVISIONS
The UN Al’Qaida & Taliban Sanctions Committee may, at a member state’s request,
remove individuals and entities from its Consolidated List. If a UK national or resi-
dent wishes to be removed from the Consolidated List, he may apply to the Committee
through the UK Government. The UK keeps decisions on asset freeze cases under
review. In the event of appropriate evidence coming forward that demonstrated that an
individual or organisation had been wrongly identiﬁed as being involved in terrorism
the UK would be prepared to take necessary action to seek the removal of any such
individual or organisations from designation lists. UK law also allows for judicial
review of administrative decisions. It is therefore open to both individuals and organ-
isations to challenge decisions on asset freezing taken by the UK Government if they
regard the action as unjustiﬁed. Since the introduction of UK legislation implementing
UNSCR 1373 there have been no such challenges.
CONFISCATION
The UK can conﬁscate the proceeds of crime without ﬁrst obtaining a conviction from
the perpetrator. The Proceeds of Crime Act does state that a criminal conviction
should be obtained ﬁrst if possible, but if it is not possible then the proceeds of crime
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
101
 

can be recovered by other means. First, through civil recovery (this is only applicable if
criminal conviction is not possible). The Director of the Assets Recovery Agency
(established in February 2003 under the Proceeds of Crime Act) can sue in the High
Court to recover property (which includes cash) derived from unlawful conduct. It
should be made clear that the proceedings are against the property and not the person.
If the civil recovery route is not possible there is an additional route that can be taken
to recover criminal proceeds without conviction, this is through taxation. The Assets
Recovery Agency can take on the role of the Inland Revenue but do not have to source
money for tax assessment.
The Home Oﬃce has issued a guide for the ARA on the procedure they should
follow with regards to both the civil recovery procedure and the taxation procedure.
1.8 In regard to compliance with sub-paragraph 1 (c), could the United Kingdom provide
the CTC with statistics on the number of cases in which ﬁnancial assets or economic
resources have been frozen, seized or conﬁscated in relation to the ﬁnancing of terrorism.
Could the United Kingdom also provide the CTC with information concerning the number
of individuals and/or entities whose properties have been frozen because they featured in a
list drawn-up by:
—
the Security Council;
—
the United Kingdom;
—
other states or organisations.
In total the UK has, since before 11 September 2001, frozen the assets of over 100
organisations and over 250 individuals under lists drawn up by the Security Council.
In 2003 the Bank of England issued 26 Notices/news releases concerning Terrorist/
Al’Qaida asset freezes, covering 72 individuals and 12 entities.
The CTC would also appreciate it if the United Kingdom could also provide it with the
corresponding statistics concerning its Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies.
Such statistics are not available.
Eﬀectiveness of counter-terrorism machinery
1.9 Eﬀective implementation of 1373-related legislation, covering all aspects of the reso-
lution, requires states to have in place eﬀective and coordinated executive machinery. It
also requires states to create and utilise appropriate national and international counter-
terrorism strategy. In this regard, the CTC would appreciate hearing how the UK’s
counter-terrorist strategy and or policy targeting (at the national/or sub national levels)
deals with the following aspects or forms of counter-terrorist activity;—Physical
protection of potential terrorists targets
PROTECTION OF VIPs AND HIGH RISK BUILDINGS
The United Kingdom has a leading role in the physical protection of potential terrorist
targets, primarily ensuring the protection of the Royal Family and VIPs. This protection
is provided in a number of ways, ranging from tailored technical protective security
packages (such as alarm systems and CCTV installed at protected individuals’ residences
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
102
 
www.ebook3000.com

and Royal sites), through to the provision of personal protection (accompanying the
protected individual at all times) and static protection (guarding the protected person’s
residence). Along with these protection measures, the United Kingdom has been
engaged in a programme of counter-terrorist hardening at a number of sites, further
enhancing the physical protection of potential terrorist targets. Although there is no
speciﬁc UK legislation relating to these protective security measures, all work is con-
ducted under the auspices of a high-level committee, charged with exercising executive
authority for the national policy on protective security matters within the UK.
The UK has well-developed aviation and maritime security programmes, focused
upon preventing acts of violence being perpetrated against UK airports, aircraft, ports
and shipping, and those employed in these industries or using their services as travel-
lers or in moving goods. These security regimes include measures designed to prevent
unlawful control being taken of UK aircraft or ships with a view to them being used as
weapons directed against buildings or other infrastructure.
Critical Infrastructure Protection
Special physical and electronic protective security measures are also in place for the
UK’s Critical National Infrastructure (CNI). The CNI is composed of ten key sectors:
•
communications
•
emergency services
•
energy
•
ﬁnance
•
food and drink
•
government and public services
•
hazards and public safety
•
health
•
transportation
•
water and sewerage.
COUNTER-TERRORIST INTELLIGENCE (HUMAN AND TECHNICAL)
It is longstanding United Kingdom Government policy not to comment on speciﬁc
issues relating to the security and intelligence services. In the United Kingdom the
Security Service are responsible for the protection of national security and in parti-
cular the protection against threats from terrorism. These functions extend throughout
the United Kingdom, apart from Northern Ireland, where the lead responsibility for
investigating the threat from terrorism related to the aﬀairs of Northern Ireland lies
with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks
of 11 September 2001, the Security and Intelligence Agencies continue to provide a
signiﬁcant contribution to tackling the threat posed by terrorist organisations.
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTION
Within the UK, a Deputy Assistant Commissioner, based within the Metropolitan
Police, has been appointed as the National Co-ordinator for Terrorist Investigations.
The role of this post has been agreed at Chief Constables’ Council and provides that
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
103
 

the National Co-ordinator may, by invitation of the relevant Chief Constable, assume
responsibility for the coordination and direction of enquiries into terrorist and other
related activity. The remit of the National Co-ordinator includes the overall command
of the investigation with the authority to direct all aspects of police activity in each
and all of the police areas that may be aﬀected. He/she will also be responsible for the
management of intelligence and evidential matters to bring matters to the point of
trial, and decisions in respect of extradition proceedings.
Policing operations are intelligence led and the role of the National Co-ordinator
provides a formal mechanism for the formation of an Executive Liaison Group (ELG).
This group enables the joint consideration of any question relating to the exploitation
of intelligence leading to executive action.
Special forces operations
The UK does not comment on the activities of its Special Forces.
—
Information concerning counter terrorist operations (including: the storage and
exchange of data, propaganda and counter-propaganda.
The UK does not comment on its counter terrorist operations.
—
Strategic analysis and forecasting
The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) produces intelligence assessments on the
threat from international terrorism for a wide range of government departments and
agencies, at a wide range of levels, from the tactical to the strategic. JTAC assessments
contribute to assessments made by the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC). The JIC is
responsible for strategic assessment of the international terrorist threat and issues
relating to international terrorism.
—
Border and immigration controls, as well as the prevention of traﬃcking in drugs,
arms, biological and chemical weapons, their precursors and the illicit use of
radioactive materials.
PORTS POLICING
Ports policing is recognised as a ﬁrst line of defence against terrorism and international
organised crime. The three main control authorities, or Border Agencies, working at
seaports and airports are Police Special Branches, HM Customs & Excise (HMCE)
and the Immigration Service. These three Agencies operate joint intelligence cells, liase
regularly and co-ordinate the collection of passenger information.
THE ROLE OF THE POLICE AT PORTS
Police Special Branches make a signiﬁcant contribution to countering the terrorist threat
and maintaining national security by posting staﬀ to Special Branch units at airports,
seaports and international rail termini. The primary function of oﬃcers at ports is to
gather intelligence, by ‘examining’ travelling passengers, to identify persons who are or
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
104
 
www.ebook3000.com

have been engaged in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
This function extends also to gathering intelligence on other Special Branch priorities.
The principle tool at the oﬃcers’ disposal is Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Special Branch oﬃcers at ports also contribute to the generic police eﬀort towards
the reduction of serious and organised crime by monitoring passengers in order to
provide intelligence about criminal activity. Where appropriate the oﬃcers use their
other powers to arrest wanted criminals travelling through ports and to support other
policing objectives. They also play an active role in the disruption and prevention of
speciﬁc oﬀences relating to the abduction of children through ports and protection of
children or breaches of civil court orders.
SCREENING FOR RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS
Screening for radioactive materials forms a key element of the UK Government’s
Counter-Terrorism strategy and is one of a wide range of measures and activities to
reduce the country’s vulnerability to terrorist attack. The UK will introduce routine
screening of all traﬃc entering the country for the illicit importation of radioactive
materials.
In undertaking such a huge programme the Government is determined that the
security measures at UK borders are world class and take into account the latest
technological innovations and research.
THE ROLE OF HM CUSTOMS AND EXCISE AT PORTS
HM Customs & Excise work in close co-operation with the UK law enforcement agen-
cies at all ports and airports to ensure that eﬀective mechanisms are in place to counter
the threat from terrorist activity. Measures taken include risk proﬁling, national threat
assessments and the regular exchange of intelligence. Steps have been taken to ensure
that biological and chemical weapons are prevented from being smuggled into the
country. Customs works closely with the UK security services to ensure that controls
are targeted and intelligence driven to meet identiﬁed threats. This approach also
covers other prohibited goods such as drugs and arms.
Other initiatives include the seizure of assets where there are reasonable grounds to
suspect that they are connected to terrorist activity. All of the border agencies share
intelligence and information on a regular basis. This is facilitated by formal Memoranda
of Understanding that clearly set out the terms under which all parties work towards a
common purpose in the ﬁght against terrorism.
Customs work is governed by the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 that
provides extensive powers to Customs oﬃcers to carry out their duties. Customs organ-
ises its day-to-day work and frontier computer processing systems on the basis of risk
assessment supported by intelligence. Customs carries out criminal investigations and
prosecutes breaches of import and export controls.
THE ROLE OF THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE AT PORTS
The Immigration Service has, among other things, national responsibility for the inte-
grity of the UK’s border controls at air and seaports. It has primary responsibility for
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
105
 

processing applications for entry by persons arriving in the UK in accordance with the
various Immigration Acts and the Immigration Rules.
One of the tools available to the Immigration Service is a computerised index, which
comprises of a list of names, lost/stolen documents and organisations. This index is
used at approximately 250 locations around the world, 80 or so in the UK (including
all points of entry), and approximately 170 locations abroad (mostly UK visa issuing
posts). The system has been in use in the UK since 1995, and by visa issuing posts
since 1998. There are approximately 750,000 person names, one million documents and
500 colleges of interest on the Index, but we have the capacity to increase these numbers.
The Immigration Service also supports, strategically and tactically, a range of border
security measures and initiatives through joint working with the Police, HMCE and
other Government departments with responsibility for border security.
THE UK PASSPORT SERVICE (UKPS)
The UKPS has development plans in place with the FCO (who issue passports to
British Citizens abroad) so that its posts abroad can access the UKPS Lost, Stolen and
Returned Database. Development plans are in place to allow access by all posts when
secure links are in place. The UKPS is also in discussion with Interpol, the Schengen
Information System, the USA, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand Passport
Services and other interested parties on allowing them secure access to the UKPS Lost,
Stolen and Returned Database.
The major FCO Posts abroad can already access the UKPS database of issued
passports. This will be rolled out to all Posts abroad when secure links are in place.
With regard to the issuing of passports, the UKPS follow ICAO standards and EU
Guidelines. The minimum standards that UKPS use before issuing a passport are that
the applicant provides not only proof of identity, but also proof of nationality.
1.10 The CTC would be grateful if the United Kingdom could provide it with information
regarding its counter terrorist work, including an outline of any targeted programs and
the agencies involved. Could the United Kingdom also describe any mechanisms, which
it may utilise in order to secure eﬀective coordination between the various agencies
charged with the implementation of the provisions contained in paragraph 2 and 3 of the
resolution? The CTC is particularly interested in receiving information concerning the
following areas:
Where necessary, coordination is achieved interdepartmentally or through the Cabinet
Oﬃce.
—
Recruitment to terrorist groups The UK is developing its work in this area, but it is
still too early to provide the CTC with any ﬁrm conclusions.
—
Links between terrorism and criminal activities (in particular, with drug traﬃcking)
The main links concern small-scale crime including credit card fraud and cigarette
smuggling.
—
The provision, by any means, of access to CBN materials to terrorists or terrorist
group The United Kingdom devotes considerable resources to monitoring and
responding to the potential CBRN terrorist threat. They include the security and
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
106
 
www.ebook3000.com

intelligence agencies, the police, considerable military expertise, scientiﬁc and other
specialist advisers (including government scientiﬁc resources). The ability of police
forces to respond to a terrorist attack involving the use of CBRN materials has
been strengthened through the provision of specialist training at a national CBRN
Police Training Centre.
1.11 In the context of sub-paragraph 2 (f) of the Resolution what authority is responsible
for providing assistance in money laundering and ﬁnancing of terrorism investigations in
the Overseas Territories?
How long does it take to provide such assistance? Are the Overseas Territories
empowered to provide such assistance without authorisation or any other requirements of
the UK? Do they need the authorisation of the central government? Does the central
government need a treaty with the Overseas Territories in order to have assistance
granted? Do the Overseas Territories provide assistance to other States only on the basis
of international agreements? What happens if no treaty is in place?
Domestic ﬁnancial issues are the responsibility of the territories’ Governments and
HM Government in the United Kingdom has no direct responsibility for these matters.
Assistance granted to the UK Government by an Overseas Territory would not require
a treaty, as treaties do not exist between the UK and its Territories.
A number of mechanisms are in place within the Overseas Territories for providing
assistance in money laundering and ﬁnancing of terrorism investigations in the Over-
seas Territories, for example regulator to regulator exchanges and Mutual Legal
Assistance Treaties (MLATs) with other States. Formal agreements such as MLATs
have clear compliance time limits written in to the agreement. The Overseas Territories
can (and do) cooperate in investigations without reference to the UK. The Overseas
Territories have also shown themselves willing to co-operate with investigators in other
States with whom no formal agreement is in place to the extent that local legislation
permits this. Should further information be required on particular Territories, we
would be happy to provide it.
1.12 With regard to the eﬀective prevention of the establishment of the terrorist safe
havens and the provision of other forms of active or passive support for terrorists or
terrorist groups the CTC would appreciate an outlining of the UK’s legal procedures and
administrative mechanisms to prevent diﬀerent forms of such support, with particular
regard to:
—
the provision of logistical support for terrorists (including the use of computer
technology)
—
‘apologia’ for terrorists
—
incitement to terrorism
—
maintenance of contacts with and between terrorist organisations, terrorist groups
and individual terrorists.
It is an oﬀence to incite, support or recruit the commission of terrorist acts under the
Terrorism Act 2000. The following oﬀences are contained within the Act:
Support for a Proscribed Organisation: It is an oﬀence to invite support for a
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
107
 

proscribed organisation. Support is not restricted to the provision of money or other
property. It is an oﬀence to arrange, manage or assist in arranging or managing a
meeting (of three or more persons, in public or private) which is known to support or
further the activities of a proscribed organisation. It is also an oﬀence if it is known a
person belonging to or professing to belong to a proscribed organisation will address
the meeting. It is an oﬀence to address a meeting when the purpose of the meeting is to
encourage support for a proscribed organisation or to further its activities. A person
guilty of an oﬀence under this section of the Act shall be liable, on conviction on
indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, to a ﬁne or to both.
Directing a Terrorist Organisation: It is an oﬀence to direct, at any level, the activities
of an organisation involved in terrorist crime.
A person guilty of an oﬀence under this section is liable, on conviction on indictment,
to imprisonment for life.
Possession for Terrorist Purposes: It is an oﬀence to possess an article in circum-
stances that give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article in possession is for a
purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of
terrorism.
A person guilty of an oﬀence under this section of the Act shall be liable, on conviction
on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, to a ﬁne or to both.
Inciting Terrorism Overseas: It is an oﬀence to incite acts of terrorism, wholly or
partly outside the UK, where the act—if committed in the UK—would constitute a
number of oﬀences as listed in the Act, such as murder and wounding with intent. A
person found guilty under this section of the Act shall be liable to any penalty, on
conviction of the oﬀences listed in the Act, which correspond to the act which he incites.
It is an oﬀence to provide training, ﬁnancial or material support for the purposes of
terrorism under the Terrorism Act 2000. UK counter-terrorist legislation deﬁnes ter-
rorist property as money or other property which is likely to be used for the purposes
of terrorism; proceeds of the commission of acts of terrorism; and proceeds of acts
carried out for the purposes of terrorism. The proceeds of an act of terrorism include
any money paid in connection with the commission of terrorist acts. It also covers
property obtained by or in return for acts of terrorism or by or in return for acts
carried out for the purposes of terrorism. It also makes explicit that any resources of a
proscribed organisation are included; i.e. money set-aside for non-violent purposes
such as rent for accommodation and bills. The following oﬀences are contained within
the Act:
Fund-raising: It is an oﬀence to invite another to provide money or other property
intending or having reasonable cause to suspect that said money or property should or
may be used for the purposes of terrorism. It also makes it an oﬀence to receive or
provide money or other property in those circumstances.
Use and Possession: It is an oﬀence to possess money or other property intending or
having reasonable cause to suspect that said money or property should or may be used
for the purposes of terrorism.
Funding Arrangements: It is an oﬀence to enter into, or become concerned in, an
arrangement that will or may result in money or other property, which is known or
suspected, being made available to another (or is to be made available to another) for
the purposes of terrorism.
Money Laundering: It is an oﬀence to enter into or become concerned in an
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
108
 
www.ebook3000.com

arrangement which facilities the retention of or control by another of terrorist pro-
perty. For example, by concealing the property, removing it from the jurisdiction,
or transferring it to nominees.
A person guilty of an oﬀence under any of these sections within the Act shall be
liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years,
to a ﬁne or to both.
Training: Where it is for the purposes of terrorism, it is an oﬀence to provide instruc-
tion or training in the use of ﬁrearms, explosives or chemical, biological or nuclear
weapons; to receive instruction or training in the making or use of the above; and to
invite another to receive such instruction or training.
A person guilty of an oﬀence under this section of the Act shall be liable, on convic-
tion on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, to a ﬁne or to
both.
The CTC would also ﬁnd it helpful to receive information on recent successful operations
in the areas above. In supplying such examples, States are not expected to supply infor-
mation in respect of ongoing investigations or judicial processes if to do so would prejudice
the proper conduct of an investigation or judicial process.
Due to the complex nature of terrorist investigations and the length of time required
to progress these matters through the courts, it is not possible to provide details of
particularly recent individual cases as they are subjudice. One of the more recent
enquiries, which required the co-ordination of police activity over a wide geographical
area, and a protracted time period, was the investigation into a dissident Irish Repub-
lican terrorist cell responsible for bombings in Central London and Birmingham during
2001. Five men were convicted in April 2003 and given lengthy prison sentences.
Co-ordination was a key point in the investigation, led by the Metropolitan Police
Anti-Terrorist Branch but with the National Coordinator directing the activities of
West Midlands and West Yorkshire Police Services. This was a huge and meticulous
investigation with over 40,000 documents placed in evidence. During the enquiry over
8,000 closed-circuit videotapes were seized and examined. Through painstaking scene
management a wealth of forensic material was recovered which was to prove vital in
building a strong prosecution case.
1.13 As regards the eﬀective implementation of the requirements of the resolution, could
the United Kingdom also outline the legislative provisions, administrative mechanisms,
as well as the practical tools and procedures which are employed to combat terrorism in
the United Kingdom’s Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies? In particular, could
the United Kingdom indicate which bodies are charged with maintaining the appropri-
ate level of interaction and coordination in relation to counter-terrorist activities in
its Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies? In its response, the United Kingdom
may wish to refer to law enforcement agencies, intelligence gathering agencies and other
competent bodies.
It has not been possible to gather comprehensive information before the speciﬁed dead-
line. The UK will provide further information on the situation in the Overseas Territories
and Crown Dependencies as soon as possible.
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E

1.14 Sub-paragraph 2 (e) of the Resolution requires each Member State, inter alia, to
have in place eﬀective police, intelligence and/or other structures as well as adequate legal
provisions to detect, monitor and apprehend persons involved in terrorist activities and/or
supporting terrorist activities, with a view to ensuring that those persons are brought to
justice. In that regard could the UK please provide the CTC with information relating to
the number of persons prosecuted for:
—
terrorist activities
—
the ﬁnancing of terrorism
—
recruiting to terrorist organisations
—
providing support to terrorists or terrorist organisations
Records of the numbers of persons arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 since 11
September 2001 are kept within the Metropolitan Police Service. Work is currently
ongoing to build a database to provide details of speciﬁc charges arising from the
arrests and the subsequent disposal of each case, but it is not yet possible to provide
the breakdown requested. As of 20 January 2004, there have been a total of 534 arrests.
Of those, 93 people have been charged with oﬀences under the Terrorism Act and a
further 76 have been charged with other criminal matters.
The nature of the charges laid to date have included: membership of a proscribed
organisation; possession of an explosive substance with intent to endanger life; receiving,
possessing or arranging for money or other property to be made available for the purpose
of terrorism; and possession of an article in circumstances giving reasonable suspicion
that the purpose was for the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism.
In addition could the United Kingdom let the CTC know how many persons have been
prosecuted for inviting support (including furthering recruitment) to:
—
proscribed organisations
—
other terrorist groups or organisations
There have been three convictions in regard of proscription oﬀences. Other groups are
not covered by the membership oﬀences.
In this regard could the UK provide data on the number of terrorist organisations which it
has proscribed? On average, how long does it take to proscribe a terrorist organisation at
the request of another state?
The UK has proscribed 39 organizations—25 international and 14 relating to Northern
Irish terrorism. No data can be provided on how long it takes to proscribe at the behest
of another state—it varies dramatically depending on the organisation or state. The
state makes a request, which is considered by the Security Service and the Home
Secretary before being put before Parliament for consideration.
1.15 With a view to eﬀective implementation of sub-paragraph 2 (e) could the UK indicate
whether its laws permit, for investigative and evidentiary purposes, to resort to special
investigative techniques in the ﬁght against terrorism? Examples of the special investiga-
tive techniques referred to could include undercover operations; the use of informants; the
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

use of other forms of encouragement to persuade persons to supply counterterrorist
information to the competent authorities; the monitoring and or the interception of com-
munications (internet, radio, audio visual media and other advanced communications
techniques)? Are there any impediments to utilizing the intelligence data in criminal
investigations? Could the UK please elaborate on the legal provisions and administrative
procedures which it has put in place in relation to the protection, assistance and support
available to victims, witnesses and other persons providing information concerning terror-
ist activities in the course of investigation and judicial proceedings. Could the UK please
indicate whether such provisions can be utilized in cooperation with another state.
The Police and Security Service both use special investigative techniques. The extent to
which counter-terrorist competent authorities can carry out any of these special
investigative techniques is deﬁned by speciﬁc legislation, which includes the Regulation
of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000, the Data Protection Act 2000, the Human
Rights Act 1998, the Security Service Act 1989 and the Intelligence Services Act 1994.
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000 provides a European
Convention on Human Rights-compliant framework for the interception of communi-
cations, the use of both covert surveillance and covert human intelligence sources (agents,
informants and undercover oﬃcers), and, very shortly, access to communications data.
•
Interception of Communications: Under Part I, Chapter I of RIPA, interception
of communications is conducted by means of a warrant authorised by the Secretary
of State on application by law enforcement, security or intelligence agencies. The
purposes for which a warrant may be issued are in the interests of national security,
to prevent or detect serious crime, for the purpose of safeguarding the economic
well-being of the United Kingdom, or for the purpose of giving eﬀect to the
provisions of any international mutual assistance agreement. As regards the last of
these, interception warrants in response to, or for the making of, requests for
international mutual assistance in interception matters, can only be issued in
circumstances equivalent to the prevention or detection of serious crime. Part I,
Chapter I of RIPA deﬁnes the interception of communications as any communica-
tion in the course of its transmission by means of either a public postal service or a
public telecommunications system. The product of an intercepted communication
cannot be used in evidence.
•
Access to Communications Data: The UK deﬁnition of communications data
includes itemised telephone call records and subscriber details, what is commonly
referred to as ‘traﬃc data’, routing and location data. It does not include the
content of the communication. Currently, communications data may be supplied
voluntarily for speciﬁed reasons (e.g. investigation of crime) under the Data Protec-
tion Act 1998. It may additionally be supplied in obedience to a Production Order
authorised by a Crown Court judge.
•
In the near future, Part I, Chapter II of RIPA will introduce a statutory based
framework to regulate access to communications data by investigating bodies. It
explains the duties and responsibilities placed upon each party involved in the
process and creates a system of safeguards, reﬂecting the requirements of Article 8
of the European Convention on Human Rights. A strict test of ‘necessity’ must be
met before any communications data is obtained under RIPA. An authorising
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
111
 

oﬃcer must not only consider the communications data to be necessary, but must
also consider the conduct involved in obtaining the communications data to be
‘proportionate’ to what it seeks to achieve. The grounds on which it is necessary
include: in the interests of national security; for the purpose of preventing or
detecting crime, or of preventing disorder. Covert Surveillance: Part II of RIPA
provides two categories of covert surveillance:
•
Intrusive surveillance is deﬁned as covert surveillance inside residential premises or
private vehicles that is carried out by means of a surveillance device or involves a
person on the premises or in the vehicle.
•
Directed surveillance is deﬁned as covert surveillance that is not intrusive, but
which is undertaken for a speciﬁc investigation or operation that is likely to obtain
private information about a person.
•
Use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHIS)—Agents, Informants and
Undercover Oﬃcers: Part II of RIPA deﬁnes an Agent, Informant and Undercover
Oﬃcer as a Covert Human Intelligence Source (CHIS) which is deﬁned as a person
who establishes or maintains a personal or other relationship with a person to
covertly obtain and disclose information. A person who carries out ‘ﬁctitious pur-
chases’ would fall within the deﬁnition of a CHIS. Intrusive surveillance may only
be carried out by the police service and HM Custom and Excise if an independent
Surveillance Commissioner approves an authorisation. The authorisation must be
necessary on the grounds that it is to prevent or detect serious crime. Intrusive
surveillance by the security and intelligence services may only be carried out by
means of a warrant authorised by the Secretary of State in the interests of national
security, to prevent or detect serious crime or in the interests of the economic well-
being of the United Kingdom. All Intrusive Surveillance authorisations must also
be proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by carrying out the activity and
the information obtained could not be reasonably obtained by other less intrusive
means. The carrying out of Directed Surveillance and the use of a Covert Human
Intelligence Source is authorised internally at a senior level within the police
service, HM Customs and Excise and security and intelligence services. An author-
isation can be granted if it is necessary and proportionate for one of the following
purposes; in the interests of national security; for the purpose of preventing or
detecting crime or preventing disorder; in the interests of the economic well-being
of the United Kingdom; in the interests of public safety; or for the purpose of
protecting public health.
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 does not cover the ‘bugging of
premises’ or other such interference with property or wireless telegraphy. Part III
of the Police Act 1997 provides the lawful basis for the police service and HM
Customs and Excise to enter on or interfere with property or with wireless teleg-
raphy. Section 5 of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 provides the lawful basis for
the security and intelligence agencies to enter on or interfere with property or with
wireless telegraphy.
1.16 The CTC would appreciate learning whether all 12 international Conventions and
protocols relating to terrorism, referred to in resolution 1373, have been ratiﬁed by the
UK in respect of all its Overseas territories and Crown Dependencies.

A matrix is attached showing which Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies
have ratiﬁed the 12 UN Terrorism Conventions.
1.17 As regards the implementation of sub-paragraph 1 (a) and (c), as well as Article 5 of
the International Convention for the Suppression of the ﬁnancing of terrorism, please
indicate whether the UK has taken measures to establish the civil, criminal or administra-
tive liability of legal persons in relation to criminal oﬀences, in particular, in relation to
oﬀences linked to terrorist activities?
Please provide an outline of the relevant legal instruments. Is it possible to assign liability
to a legal person, including circumstances where no natural person has been convicted or
identiﬁed?
Legal persons are subject to the provisions of the Terrorism Act. There is a duty under
s 19 (1) of the Terrorism Act for a person to disclose information if he believes or
suspects a person of involvement in terrorist property oﬀences. In addition, a person
working in the regulated sector (business accepting deposits) is guilty of an oﬀence if
he knows or suspects a person—or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting a
person—has committed a terrorist property oﬀence and the information came to him
in the course of a business in the regulated sector and he did not disclose it to a
constable or a nominated person in his company as soon as practicable or the informa-
tion is subject to legal privilege.
Could the UK supply the CTC with statistics on the number of cases where sanctions were
imposed on ﬁnancial institutions for providing support to terrorists or terrorist
organisations?
This information is not available.
Eﬀectiveness of customs, immigration and border control
1.18 Eﬀective implementation of sub-paragraphs 2 (c) and (g) of the Resolution involves
maintaining eﬀective customs, immigration and border controls to prevent the movement
of terrorists and establishment of safe havens. In that connection, with regard to prevent-
ing the falsiﬁcation, counterfeiting or illegal use of identiﬁcation and travel documents,
have the authorities in the UK taken any action in relation to:
—
establishing standards for the collection and dissemination of information and
warnings about passengers:
The e-Borders programme envisages an Authority to Carry (ATC) scheme. This
scheme will allow UKIS to prevent speciﬁed categories of passenger from travelling to
the UK and provide advance information for other border control, law enforcement
and intelligence agencies by requiring carriers to request a check against Government
databases before departure.
—
establishing minimum standards concerning the issuance of identiﬁcation documents
and travel documents; establishing minimum standards and recommendations
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
113
 

concerning the use of biometry in the establishment of procedures and the production
of documents.
The UK has a program in place to implement ICAO standard for biometrics in pass-
ports. In addition, the UK is supporting the EU proposals for the introduction of
ICAO compliant biometrics in visas and residence permits. Biometric images will even-
tually support facial recognition proposals that will assist in detecting and reducing
fraudulent passport applications.
—
establishment of minimum standards in relation to equipment used to verify the
authenticity of documents at places of entry in or exit from a state.
All immigration oﬃcers have access to appropriate forgery detection equipment both
on the primary arrival control and in the back oﬃce. In addition, the computerised
Warnings Index terminal at most ports incorporates a swipe reader for reading and
checking ICAO standard machine-readable travel documents. All ports are provided
with up to date intelligence bulletins and alerts to provide details and images of
genuine documents for comparison and examples of fraud of documents. Centrally
organised training is available to all port immigration oﬃcers in forgery detection to
enable them to identify document fraud and utilize properly the forgery detection
equipment provided.
Does the UK exchange information with other States concerning lost or stolen passports
and the refusal of visas?
If the answer to the question is yes could the UK provide an outline of the relevant
standards and recommendations, including a description of any mechanisms used to further
their implementation. Does the UK exchange information with other States concerning
lost and stolen passports and the refusal of visas? If so please provide details.
The National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU) is the UK national contact point for
international exchanges of information between border control authorities on lost and
stolen travel documents.
The UK does not routinely and regularly share visa refusal information with
other countries. However, upon request, a UK visa oﬃce would usually provide
summary information as to why someone had been refused a visa if that same
applicant subsequently applied for a visa at another country’s embassy in the same
location.
In relation to sharing data with other states, the UK Passport Service is currently
working with both the Schengen Information System (SIS) programme in order to
make lost/stolen passport data available to appropriate authorities within Europe.
Additionally, UKPS is working with Interpol to make the same available for loading
onto their I 24/7 system, which is available across Europe and further aﬁeld. There has
been no formal commitment here by UKPS, but it is working closely with other
‘friendly’ nations (principally the ‘5 Nations’, i.e. accepting the UK, USA, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand) and sharing of data has and is being discussed.
UKPS uses lost/stolen information that it gathers to prevent fraudulent passport
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
114

issues. It is also making this information available to a number of parties, including but
not limited to the FCO, UKIS, DVLA, the SIS programme and Interpol, via a direct,
secure, system link to its passport database known as ‘OmniBase’.
1.19 Please outline the legal and administrative procedures utilised by the UK to protect
port facilities, ships, persons, cargo, cargo transport units and ships stores from the risks
of a terrorist attack. Please outline the procedures adopted in the UK to control access to
ships and to monitor restricted areas with a view to ensuring that only authorised persons
have access to and supervise the handling of cargo and ship’s stores. Does the UK
periodically review and update transport security plans? If yes, please outline.
The UK has long-standing aviation and maritime security regimes under the Aviation
and Maritime Security Act 1990 (AMSA). For the maritime sector, the AMSA security
regime applies to passenger ships and the ports serving them and includes UK ﬂagged
cruise ships operating worldwide. The regime consists of mandatory protective security
measures, which vary according to the prevailing level of threat and risk, as well as
security guidance and best practice. The UK is now making good progress on imple-
menting the new international ship and port facility security regime, agreed by the IMO
in December 2002, and expects to meet the deadline for implementation of 1 July 2004.
Under an EU Regulation currently being agreed, the UK will also apply the IMO
regime to domestic ships and port facilities by the deadlines to be agreed by the EU.
1.20 Has the UK given eﬀect to the standards and recommendations of the International
Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and whether the ICAO has conducted safety audits
of the UK’s international airports?
The UK gives eﬀect to the standards and recommended practices of the International
Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) (Annex 17). As far as ICAO safety audits are
concerned none have been conducted on the UK mainland and no security audits have
been conducted in the UK.
Eﬀectiveness of controls preventing access to weapons by terrorists
1.21 Sub-paragraph 2 (a) of the Resolution requires each Member State, inter alia, to
have in place appropriate mechanisms to deny terrorists access to weapons. In this regard,
could the United Kingdom outline how it co-ordinates the law enforcement agencies and
other competent authorities charged with implementing controls on the export of goods;
the transfer of technologies; the provision of technical assistance overseas and the trade in
controlled goods. In that respect, the CTC is particularly interested in hearing about
coordination between the agencies for denying terrorists access to weapons or hazardous
materials. The CTC would appreciate receiving statistics from the United Kingdom on the
implementation of the speciﬁc legal provisions relied on to prevent terrorists from gaining
access to such weapons.
The Restricted Enforcement Unit (REU) has a central role in co-ordinating the work
involved in countering potential breaches of export controls and procurement attempts
in support of overseas weapons programmes—in particular those relating to Weapons
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
115
 

of Mass Destruction (WMD). The REU is an interdepartmental committee of oﬃcials
drawn from interested departments and meets regularly to discuss information received
from a wide variety of sources including HM Customs and Excise—the enforcement
authority in the UK for export controls. Decisions on export licence applications and
ratings (an assessment of licensability), including—in particular—issues such as end
use and the risk of third party transfers are underpinned by the work of the REU. All
export licence applications and ratings are checked against terrorist lists.
Statistics under this sub-paragraph are not available.
1.22 With regard to the requirements of sub-paragraph 2 (a) of the Resolution as well as
to the provisions of the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the purpose
of Detection and the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing
please provide the CTC with information relevant to the following questions:
—
Please specify procedures of export control and existing mechanism of exchange of
information of sources, routs and methods of traders in arms.
Licences to export arms and other goods subject to control for strategic reasons
(including explosives) are issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
acting through the Export Control Organisation (ECO) of the Department of Trade
and Industry. All relevant licence applications are circulated by the DTI to other
Government Departments with an interest for advice as determined by these
Departments in line with their own policy responsibilities. This includes, principally,
the Foreign and Commonwealth Oﬃce (FCO), the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and
the Department for International Development (DFID). Goods that are subject to
strategic export control must be covered by a license issued by the Department of
Trade and Industry. When presenting the goods to Customs, the exporter must
declare the type of license used. Speciﬁc licenses must be presented with the goods.
Details of an open license must be given on the customs declaration and on com-
mercial documents.
Customs use a number of techniques to identify sensitive goods not declared at
export. Where the licensability of goods is obvious from the commodity code, Customs’
automatic entry processing system will not accept the entry without a licence. In other
cases proﬁles are set on the system based on the goods, the exporter, the destination and
the end-user. A regular programme of ‘awareness raising’ visits to customs staﬀ at UK
ports and airports is carried out. Customs and other agencies also visit exporters to
raise awareness about suspicious orders. The UK has fostered a culture of compliance
with exporters who see adherence to the controls as essential in maintaining their busi-
ness reputation. Specialist investigators regularly meet all agencies concerned in export
control at the Restricted Enforcement Unit, where they exchange information and
intelligence about procurement activities, suspicious routing, smuggling trends etc.
—
Please outline any appropriate mechanism to verify the authenticity of licensing or
authorisation documents for the import or export or transit movement of ﬁrearms.
Where there is reason to suspect the authenticity of licenses Customs check the details
with the Department of Trade and Industry. Customs receive copies of all open indi-
vidual export licenses. The Foreign and Commonwealth Oﬃce carries out veriﬁcation
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
116
 
www.ebook3000.com

checks on end-user certiﬁcates via UK embassies in the countries concerned. The UK
receives copies of ﬁrearms transfer documents from other states of the European
Union. A network of Customs Firearms and Explosives Oﬃcers carries out veriﬁcation
checks at the premises of Registered Firearms Dealers.
—
Has the UK’s Customs Service implemented intelligence-based risk management
on borders to identify high-risk goods? Please outline data elements required by
Customs Administration to identify high-risk consignment prior to shipment.
Border checks are based either on speciﬁc intelligence or on risk proﬁles as outlined
above. For exports the main focus is on sensitive destinations and suspect end-users.
Checks based purely on the types of goods are not always helpful—the majority of
commodity codes are too wide to identify most controlled goods; most controlled
goods are dual-use and present no risk when exported by responsible exporters to
responsible end-users. Import checks also are based on risk assessment and focus on
high-risk goods such as weapons and ammunition. Commodity codes and country of
origin are the main indicators used by Customs to base risk proﬁles.
—
Do legal provisions in place provide for sharing the information on import and export
licences or authorisation, or accomplishing documents, of names and location of
brokers involved in the transaction with foreign counterparts to enable co-operation
in preventing illegal shipments of ﬁrearms, their parts and components and
ammunition as well as explosives and their precursors.
The UK has provisions in place to share information in the event of breaches of
import and export controls on ﬁrearms, parts, and ammunition. This co-operation is
mainly carried out between enforcement authorities and the procedures have been in
place for a number of years. There is no routine sharing of licensing information that is
conﬁdential.
—
Has the UK implemented, using risk assessment principles, any special security
measures on the import, export and transit movement of ﬁrearms, such as conducting
security checks on the temporary storage, warehouses and means of transport carrying
ﬁrearms, and requiring persons involved in these operations to undergo security
vetting? If yes please give details.
In the UK the import, export and transit of weapons and ammunition is heavily regu-
lated. This includes carriers and transport operators. Security vetting is applicable and
is carried out by a specialist UK Agency.
—
What special measures are used by the UK to prevent and suppress illegal traﬃcking
in ﬁrearms, ammunition and explosives, utilised by terrorists.
The UK has fostered a culture of self-regulation and compliance among UK exporting
companies with the export controls that are in place. A Compliance Unit within the
ECO is responsible for ensuring compliance with the conditions of Open Licences.
Compliance teams visit holders of these licences to examine records (including end-use
documentation) that the exporters are required to maintain as a condition of the relevant
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
117
 

licence and to check that the systems and procedures for meeting the requirements of
the licences are working properly.
1.23 The CTC is aware that the United Kingdom may have covered some or all of the
points in the preceding paragraphs in reports or questionnaires submitted to other organ-
isations involved in monitoring international standards. The CTC would be content to
receive a copy of any such report or questionnaire as part of the United Kingdom’s
response to these matters as well as details of any eﬀorts to implement international best
practices and standards which are relevant to the implementation of resolution 1373.
A possible candidate would be the UK’s return for the 2002 OSCE Information
Exchange on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) (dated August 2003). The
return was HMG’s attempt to present a model return relating to export control matters
with the overall aim of establishing a level of international best practice for other
OSCE members.
2. Assistance and guidance
The United Kingdom shares the CTC’s view of the importance of the provision of
assistance and advice in connection with the implementation of Resolution 1373. The
United Kingdom welcomes the CTC’s recognition of the United Kingdom’s eﬀorts
to provide assistance to other States in connection with the implementation of the
Resolution and reiterates its determination to maintain and develop the constructive
dialogue with the CTC.
The United Kingdom will continue to review the current UK entries in the Directory
and will continue to supply the CTC with updates of its counter-terrorism assistance
matrix on a six-monthly basis. The latest such update is enclosed with this letter.

Annex
Introduction and summary
On the day after the heinous September 11 terrorist attacks in Washington and New
York, the General Assembly of the United Nations, by consensus of the 189 member
states, called for international cooperation to prevent and eradicate acts of terrorism
and to hold accountable the perpetrators and those who harbor or support them. That
same day, the United Nations Security Council unanimously determined, for the ﬁrst
time ever, any act of international terrorism to be a threat to international peace and
security. This determination laid the foundation for Security Council action to bring
together the international community under a common set of obligations in the ﬁght
to end international terrorism.
On September 28, 2001, the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1373
under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. This historic resolution
established a body of legally binding obligations on all UN member states. It deﬁned
the common core of the new international campaign to deal with international terror-
ists, their organizations, and those who support them. Its provisions require, among
other things, that all member states prevent the ﬁnancing of terrorism and deny safe
haven to terrorists. States will need to review and strengthen their border security
operations, banking practices, customs and immigration procedures, law enforcement
and intelligence cooperation, and arms transfer controls. All states are called upon to
increase cooperation and share pertinent information with respect to these eﬀorts.
Resolution 1373 also mandated that each state report on the steps it had taken, and
established a committee of the Security Council to monitor implementation. The
committee will highlight best practices, identify gaps, and help coordinate advice and
assistance to states that need it.
Full implementation of resolution 1373 will require each UN member state to take
speciﬁc measures to combat terrorism. Most states will have to make changes in their
laws, regulations, and practices.
Those with the capacity to assist in these changes will be needed to help those who
lack the expertise and resources to achieve full implementation. As this report that
follows makes clear, the United States is ready to provide technical assistance to help in
these eﬀorts. We will work closely with other nations who also have the capacity to
assist, and with those seeking assistance. Cooperation is key to success.
It will be especially important that these eﬀorts be sustained in the coming months
and years. The goal should be to ensure through the UN that enduring mechanisms are
created, and that existing institutions are utilized, to raise the capabilities of all nations
to confront the threat of terrorism. As UNSCR 1373 recognizes, there will be a need for
enhanced coordination of eﬀorts on national, subregional, regional and global levels.
The United States is waging a broad-ranging campaign both at home and abroad
against terrorism, including by taking military action in Afghanistan. As another way
of combating terrorism internationally, the United States strongly supports UNSCR
1373 and the Counter Terrorist Committee set up by the resolution, and wishes to see
full implementation by all states. As President Bush has promised: ‘We will direct every
resource at our command—every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every
instrument of law enforcement, every ﬁnancial inﬂuence, and every necessary weapon
of war—to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.’

Our report details only some of the many steps that we have been taking to combat
terrorism and comply with UNSCR 1373. But, we intend to do even more to ensure
that we have taken all appropriate measures. The following is a list of some of the steps
taken, which are detailed in this report.
STEPS TAKEN BY THE U.S.
On September 23, Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, froze all the assets of 27 foreign
individuals, groups, and entities linked to terrorist acts or supporting terrorism and
authorized the freezing of assets of those who commit, or pose a signiﬁcant threat of
committing, acts of terrorism.
On September 28, the U.S. sponsored the UN Security Council Resolution 1373,
calling on all UN members to criminalize the provision of funds to all terrorists,
eﬀectively denying terrorists safe ﬁnancial haven anywhere.
On October 5, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Attorney General and
the Secretary of the Treasury, redesignated 25 terrorist organizations (including
al-Qaeda) as foreign terrorist organizations pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Eﬀect-
ive Death Penalty Act of 1996. Giving material support or resources to any of these
foreign organizations is a felony under U.S. law.
On October 12, the U.S. added 39 names to the list of individuals and organizations
linked to terrorism or terrorist ﬁnancing under E.O. 13224.
On October 26, the U.S. enacted the USA PATRIOT Act, which signiﬁcantly
expanded the ability of U.S. law enforcement to investigate and prosecute persons who
engage in terrorist acts.
On October 29, the U.S. created a Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force aimed at
denying entry into the U.S. of persons suspected of being terrorists and locating,
detaining, prosecuting and deporting terrorists already in the U.S.
On November 2, the U.S. designated 22 terrorist organizations located throughout
the world under E.O. 13224, thus, highlighting the need to focus on terrorist organiza-
tions worldwide.
On November 7, the U.S. added 62 new organizations and individuals, all of whom
were either linked to the Al Barakaat conglomerate or the Al Taqwa Bank, which have
been identiﬁed as supplying funds to terrorists.
On December 4, the U.S. froze under E.O. 13224 the assets and accounts of the Holy
Land Foundation in Richardson, Texas, whose funds are used to support the Hamas
terrorist organization, and two other entities, bringing the total to 153.
On December 5, the Secretary of State designated 39 groups as ‘terrorist organiza-
tions’ under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the new USA
PATRIOT Act, in order to strengthen the United States’ ability to exclude supporters
of terrorism or to deport them if they are found within our borders. We call the list of
such designated organizations the ‘Terrorist Exclusion List.’
The U.S. has signed and expects to ratify in the near future the UN Convention
for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the UN Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.
The U.S. has met with numerous multilateral groups and regional organizations to
accelerate the exchange of operational information laid out in UNSCR 1373.
The U.S. has stepped up bilateral information exchanges through law enforcement
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
120
 
www.ebook3000.com

and intelligence channels to prevent terrorist acts and to investigate and prosecute the
perpetrators of terrorist acts.
Our Federal Bureau of Investigation has created an interagency Financial Investiga-
tion Group to examine the ﬁnancial arrangements used to support terrorist attacks.
The FBI headquarters houses this group, which includes analysts and investigators from
numerous federal agencies and federal prosecutors with backgrounds in investigating
and prosecuting ﬁnancial crimes.
The U.S. brought to conclusion the prosecution of four al-Qaeda members for
the bombing of U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi.
We have designed a new tamper-resistant U.S. visa, and we have upgraded passports
to prevent photo substitution.
We have intensiﬁed border discussions with Canada and Mexico to improve border
security.
UNSCR 1373 Operative paragraph 1
1(a): What measures if any have been taken to prevent and suppress the ﬁnancing of
terrorists acts in addition to those listed in your responses to questions on 1(b) to (d)?
The assault on the ﬁnancial underpinnings of terrorism is central to U.S. eﬀorts to ﬁght
terrorists and their supporters with every available weapon. Through the September 23
Executive Order freezing U.S. assets of designated individuals and organizations that
commit terrorist acts or fund terrorism, and other measures, the U.S. is taking concrete
actions internally to combat the ﬁnancing of terrorist entities. The U.S. also works
closely with governments around the world in identifying and freezing terrorists’ assets.
The U.S. has contacted almost every other UN Member State to encourage them to
identify and freeze terrorist assets through implementation of the UN Security Council
Resolutions and other means. A list of U.S. actions is set forth below.
Freezing of Terrorist Assets
President George W. Bush signed Executive Order (E.O.) 132241 on September 23 pur-
suant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(IEEPA). This order blocks all property and interests in property of foreign persons
and entities designated by the President in the Order, or designated by the Secretary of
State as committing, or posing a signiﬁcant risk of committing, acts of terrorism
threatening the security of U.S. nationals or U.S. national security, foreign policy, or
economy, if that property is either within the U.S. or within the possession or control
of U.S. persons.
The Order also blocks the property and interests in property of
persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to provide support or services to,
or to be associated with, any individuals or entities designated under the Order. The
Secretary of the Treasury may also block property and interests in property of per-
sons determined to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, persons

designated in or under the E.O. Any transaction or dealing by U.S. persons or within
the U.S. in property and interests in property blocked pursuant to the Order is
prohibited.
The Order directs the U.S. Government to cooperate and coordinate with foreign
governments to suppress and prevent terrorism, to deny ﬁnancial services and ﬁnancing
to terrorists, and to share intelligence about terrorist ﬁnancing.
Under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act2 (as amended by the
Antiterrorism and Eﬀective Death Penalty Act of 1996), the Secretary of State may, in
consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, designate an
organization as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (‘FTO’) if the organization is a ‘for-
eign organization’ that ‘engages in terrorist activity’ that ‘threatens the security of U.S.
nationals or the security of the United States’. The Department of the Treasury may
require U.S. ﬁnancial institutions possessing or controlling assets of designated FTOs
to block all ﬁnancial transactions involving these assets. Further, it is a federal crime to
provide material support to designated FTOs, and certain members of these FTOs are
not allowed to enter or remain in the U.S.
Under Executive Order 12947 of January 23, 1995, as amended by E.O. 13099 of
August 20, 1998, the President designated sixteen organizations, and authorized the
Secretary of State to designate additional foreign individuals or entities who have
committed, or pose a signiﬁcant risk of committing, acts of violence with the pur-
pose or eﬀect of disrupting the Middle East peace process, or who have provided
support for or services in support of such acts of violence. Designations of terrorism-
related organizations and individuals pursuant to the Order, as amended, have
continuing validity as actions taken in the U.S. consistent with the objectives of
UNSCR 1373.
The Order further authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to block the property of
persons determined to be owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, persons
designated in or under the Order. All property and interests in property of persons
designated under the Order in the U.S. or in the control of U.S. persons are blocked.
Any transaction or dealing in such blocked property is prohibited.
Designated Terrorists and Their Supporters E.O. 13224 includes an annex listing 27
organizations and individuals whose assets are blocked by the E.O. because of their
ties to terrorism. An additional 39 individuals and organizations were added on
October 12. On November 2, we added to the list 22 terrorist organizations already
designated as FTOs, but not previously designated under the Order; 62 more indi-
viduals and entities were added on November 7, and three additional entities were
listed on December 4, bringing the total to 153. The list will be updated periodically.
In addition, a total of 28 terrorist organizations have been designated as FTOs, and 16
individuals and entities have been designated under E.O. 12947.
Improved Coordination at Home
The U.S. is improving coordination and information sharing internally. The Foreign
Terrorist Asset Tracking Center (FTAT), in the Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control at the
Department of Treasury, identiﬁes the ﬁnancial infrastructure of terrorist organiza-
tions worldwide to curtail their ability to move money through the international

banking system. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has broadened its investi-
gative eﬀorts on the ﬁnancial front, in terrorists’ use of money laundering, electronic
transactions, cyberbanking, and traﬃcking in valuable gems.
Improving Domestic Tools to Stop Financing Terrorism
On October 26, President Bush signed into law the USA PATRIOT Act,3 providing
for broad new investigative and information sharing between law enforcement and
intelligence agencies with respect to terrorist ﬁnancing. It expands the scope of U.S.
regulations against money laundering by requiring securities brokers and dealers to
ﬁle suspicious activity reports and gives new power to act against money laundering
havens. The PATRIOT Act also expands the President’s powers to conﬁscate property
under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when the U.S. is
engaged in armed hostilities or has been attacked.
International Cooperation, Outreach and Coordination
The U.S. is working to improve international sanctions and anti-money laundering
coordination, notably through a multilateral sanctions administrators coordinating
group which meets regularly with the Treasury Department’s Oﬃce of Financial Assets
Control on U.S. and European Union sanctions.
The U.S. has strong outreach programs to encourage other nations to join this eﬀort.
Senior oﬃcials have urged strong action in support of the global eﬀort against terrorist
ﬁnancing, including removal of legal or other barriers that might hinder cooperative
eﬀorts.
The U.S. will seek to respond to requests for technical assistance to block terrorist
assets, cut oﬀ terrorist fund ﬂows, and prevent fund-raising activities which beneﬁt
terrorists.
The U.S. has signed and expects to ratify in the near future the UN Convention for
the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Also, the U.S. is a signatory to the UN
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.
Important International Initiatives in which the U.S. Plays a Role
The U.S. and European Union have developed unprecedented cooperation on coun-
terterrorism since September 11, including close cooperation on the freezing of the
assets of terrorists and their supporters, as well as increased assistance in investiga-
tions and the sharing of information among law enforcement authorities, increased
coordination of measures to strengthen aviation security, further exchanges of ideas
on tightening border controls, and increased contact between key judicial and police
organizations. Also, a U.S.-EUROPOL Agreement was signed in early December,
facilitating the exchange of analytical data.
The Secretary of State joined with the Foreign Ministers of the other members of
the Organization of the American States to approve a resolution on September 21
condemning the terrorist acts of September 11 and expressing the need for hemis-
pheric solidarity and eﬀective measures against terrorism. On October 15, the Inter-
American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) formed a sub-committee to increase

Terrorism Acts of 2001,’ Pub. L. No. 107–56, H.R. 3162, 107th Congress (2001)
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E

cooperation in tracking the ﬁnancial assets of terrorists and their supporters. These
recommendations will be approved at the CICTE Regular Session in January.
— In addition, the Foreign Ministers of States Parties to the Inter-American Treaty
of Reciprocal Assistance (‘Rio Treaty’) adopted a Resolution on September 21 restat-
ing their commitment of reciprocal assistance and aﬃrming that measures being taken
by the U.S. and other states in reaction to the terrorist attacks of September 11 were in
the exercise of their inherent right of individual and collective self-defense.
In Shanghai last October, leaders of the Asia Paciﬁc Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum responded to President Bush’s call for a coalition to defeat terrorism with a
strong statement condemning the terrorist attacks in the U.S. They also committed
APEC members to implement relevant UN conventions and resolutions and to take
speciﬁc steps to stop the ﬂow of funds to terrorists and their supporters, and to steps to
ensure aviation and maritime security, strengthen energy security, and enhance border
security and customs enforcement.
Among the other important initiatives that we participate in are:
The G-7 ﬁnance ministers issued a comprehensive action plan on terrorist ﬁnanc-
ing on October 6, calling for a special Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plenary
on October 29–30, and an Egmont Group meeting on October 31. G–7 countries
have called for increased international coordination and eﬀorts to combat terrorist
ﬁnancing.
At its plenary on October 29–30, FATF adopted eight special recommendations
focused on combating terrorist ﬁnancing, and then adopted an action plan to imple-
ment them. The overall FATF eﬀort will be reviewed when FATF next meets in
Hong Kong in January 2002.
At its October 31 meeting, the 58 member nations of the Egmont Group of ﬁnancial
intelligence units agreed to expand information sharing on terrorist ﬁnancing.
The Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the G–20 adopted on
November 17 a comprehensive action plan of multilateral cooperation to deny terror-
ists and their associates access to, or use of, their ﬁnancial systems, and to stop any
abuse of informal banking networks. The plan also calls on G–20 countries to make
public the lists of terrorists whose assets are subject to freezing, and the amount of
assets frozen. The Manila Framework Group formally endorsed the G–20 Action Plan
during its December 2001 meetings.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has expanded its activities to include eﬀorts
aimed at countering terrorist ﬁnancing. In its November 17 Communiqué, the Inter-
national Monetary and Financial Committee of the Board of Governors (the IMFC)
called on each IMF member to freeze all terrorist assets within its jurisdiction and to
implement fully UNSCR 1373. Members should publish monthly reports by February
1, 2002, listing terrorist assets subject to freezing and the amount of assets frozen. Also,
the IMF will expand eﬀorts to help countries review and optimize their ﬁnancial, legal,
and institutional frameworks to help ensure that all avenues are closed to terrorism.
Within the G–8, the Counter-terrorism Experts Group and the Lyon Group held a
second special joint session on November 18–20, adding concrete actions, timelines,
and responsibilities to the 25-point G-8 Counter-terrorism Action Plan developed earl-
ier by the two groups. The Plan would advance the ﬁght against terrorism in the areas
of aviation security, judicial cooperation, and law enforcement. The Groups meet again
in February.

In the area of international aviation security, we participate in the Aviation Security
(AVSEC) panel of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to enhance
worldwide aviation security standards. We will participate in the ICAO Ministerial
Conference next February to establish an ICAO audit plan for compliance with Annex
17 to the Chicago Convention (on safeguarding civil aviation against acts of unlawful
interference), to upgrade certain recommended security practices, and to seek a greater
level of participation in voluntary contributions to the AVSEC fund.
1(b): What are the oﬀences and penalties in your country with respect to the activities
listed in this sub-paragraph?
There are several sources of legal authority for the U.S. government to rely upon in
imposing civil and criminal penalties for the provision and collection of funds to pro-
vide support to terrorists. These include both laws prohibiting material or other support
to terrorists and their supporters, and money laundering laws addressing a variety of
criminal activity, including the unlawful movement of money without proper reports.
Providing Support to Terrorism
Providing ‘material support’ to terrorists or terrorist organizations has been pro-
hibited as a crime since the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Eﬀective Death
Penalty Act of 1996. As a result of the October 26, 2001 enactment of the antiterror-
ism bill known as the ‘USA PATRIOT Act’, there is now speciﬁc authority to forfeit
terrorist assets as well, thus providing a direct means to deprive terrorists of their
funds.
U.S. law makes it a crime to provide material support or resources within the U.S. to
a person intending that the support or resources will be used, or is in preparation
for, the commission of a wide variety of speciﬁed terrorism-related crimes.4 ‘Material
support or resources’ is very broadly deﬁned and means ‘currency or other ﬁnancial
securities, ﬁnancial services, lodging, raining, expert advice or assistance, safe houses,
false documentation or identiﬁcation, explosives, personnel, transportation, and other
physical assets, except medicine or religious materials.’5
Property provided as ‘material support’ to a terrorist in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 2339A is subject to forfeiture if it is involved in a transaction or attempted transac-
tion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956–57, or if it is the proceeds of a section 2339A
oﬀense.6
In addition, U.S. law7 prohibits the provision of ‘material support’ to a Foreign
Terrorist Organization.8 A Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) may be designated
pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.9 Al-Qaida has
been designated as an FTO. When a ﬁnancial institution becomes aware that it has

possession of, or control over, any funds in which a Foreign Terrorist Organization, or
its agent, has an interest, it shall retain possession or control over the funds, and report
the existence of such funds to the Secretary of the Treasury. Failure to do so may result
in civil penalties.
Finally, providing prohibited ‘material support’ is punishable criminally by 15 years
imprisonment and/or a ﬁne of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for
organizations.
MONEY LAUNDERING AND CURRENCY REPORTING
Property brought into or taken out of the United States with the intent to promote one
of the terrorist acts or other crimes constituting a Speciﬁed Unlawful Activity is sub-
ject to civil forfeiture.10 For example, if U.S. Customs agents learned during an investi-
gation that funds raised in the U.S. were sent, or were attempted to be sent, abroad to
fund a terrorist action, or funds came into the United States for such a purpose, the
funds would be forfeitable.
Currency and other monetary instruments, including a deposit in a ﬁnancial institu-
tion traceable to those instruments, may be forfeited11 when a required Currency
Monetary Instrument Report has not been ﬁled properly. Pursuant to the USA PAT-
RIOT Act, there is now speciﬁc authority to forfeit currency and other monetary
instruments if someone ‘knowingly conceals’ those instruments to evade a reporting
requirement.12 The U.S. plans to pursue that authority fully.
Any person who violates any license, order, or regulation issued pursuant to the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), i.e., the authority under
which the President issued Executive Orders 13224 and 12947, may be subject to civil
ﬁnes, and those who willfully violate, or willfully attempt to violate, any license, order
or regulation issued pursuant to IEEPA may be subject to criminal penalties including
ﬁnes or imprisonment.
1(c): What legislation and procedures exist for freezing accounts and assets at banks and
ﬁnancial institutions?
President George W. Bush signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13224 on September 23
pursuant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(IEEPA). This Order allows for the blocking of property and interests in property of
all persons designated pursuant to the Order. Such designations include terrorists, as
well as those who provide support or services to, or associate with, persons with terror-
ism-related links. (See the response to Paragraph 1.a in this report for further detail on
E.O. 13224 and other, related measures.)
E.O. 13224 also charged the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of State and the Attorney General, with responsibility for its implementa-
tion, including the promulgation of regulations related to the sanctions.
Therefore, designated terrorist property and interests in property, including funds

and ﬁnancial assets or economic resources, within the U.S. or in the possession or
control of a U.S. person, are blocked. Any transaction or dealing in the U.S. or by U.S.
persons in such blocked property and interests in property are prohibited. Transactions
intended to evade the prohibitions imposed in the Executive Order also are prohibited.
Between September 11 and December 6, 2001, the U.S. blocked a total of 79
ﬁnancial accounts within the U.S., pursuant to E.O. 13224. The accounts totaled $33.7
million.
Included in those actions was the November 7 blocking by the Department of the
Treasury of the property and interests in property of several ﬁnancial institutions and
accounts—primarily those of the ‘Al Barakaat’ organization.
Executive Order 13224 complements and builds upon other legal measures that
impose sanctions on terrorists and their supporters. In particular, several terrorists
designated under E.O. 13224, and subject to its sanctions, were previously designated
in or pursuant to E.O. 12947, as amended.13 (See the response to Paragraph 1.a in this
report for further detail.)
Blocked property, including blocked funds, that a U.S. person imports, exports,
or attempts to import or export may be seized and forfeited by the U.S. Customs
Service, as may any merchandise imported contrary to the sanctions.14 Any convey-
ance or thing (e.g., a container) facilitating such importation may be seized and
forfeited, and any person concerned in the unlawful activity is subject to a penalty
equal to the value of the imported goods.15 U.S. Customs also may seize and forfeit
arms, munitions, or ‘other articles’ exported, or attempted to be exported, in violation
of law.
1(d): What measures exist to prohibit the activities listed in this sub-paragraph?
President George W. Bush signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13224 on September 23 pur-
suant to his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(IEEPA). This Order allows for the blocking of property and interests in property of
all persons designated pursuant to the Order.
Such designations include terrorists, as well as those who provide support or ser-
vices to, or associate with, persons with terrorism-related links. (See the response to
Paragraph 1.a in this report for further detail on E.O. 13224 and other, related
measures.)
The U.S. Customs Service has formed a ﬁnancial anti-terrorism task force, known as
Operation GREEN QUEST, to identify, disrupt, and dismantle the ﬁnancial infra-
structure of terrorist organizations. In November 2001, Operation GREEN QUEST—
composed of investigators and analysts from U.S. Customs, the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Treasury Depart-
ment’s Oﬃce of Financial Assets Control (OFAC)—coordinated ﬁve search warrants.
Concurrently, several businesses had their activities and their bank accounts ($1.3
million USD) blocked, i.e., frozen. Intelligence and investigation had indicated the
businesses and accounts were paying fees to terrorist organizations. The funds were

frozen based on Executive Order 13324 and routine judicial procedures were used to
further the criminal prosecution of the individuals and businesses involved.
UNSCR 1373 operative paragraph 2
2(a): What legislation or other measures are in place to give eﬀect to this sub-paragraph?
In particular, what oﬀences in your country prohibit (i) recruitment to terrorist groups
and (ii) the supply of weapons to terrorists? What other measures help prevent such
activities?
RECRUITMENT
Conspiracy and other laws make it illegal to solicit a person to commit a terrorist act
or other crime.16 Recruiting for membership in a terrorist organization is grounds for
denying a visa.17 A foreign national who enters the United States and is later found in
violation of these prohibitions is subject to deportation.
WEAPONS
U.S. law contains criminal prohibitions on the acquisition, transfer and exportation of
certain ﬁrearms.18 Numerous state and local laws also apply.
The U.S. Government also requires licenses for the export of defense articles (which
includes technical data) and defense services pursuant to the Arms Export Control
Act (AECA),19 which counters the illicit transfer of U.S.-origin defense items to any
unauthorized person. Violations of the AECA or its implementing regulations can
result in civil and criminal penalties.
It is a crime under U.S. law to provide material support such as funding and
weapons for a terrorist act or to an organization designated by the Secretary of State as
a foreign terrorist organization.20 It is also grounds for denying a visa or removing an
individual from the U.S.21
The U.S. government also applies controls to exports and re-exports of sensitive
U.S.-origin dual-use items and nuclear-related items pursuant to the statutory author-
ities of the Department of Commerce and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic sanctions against
designated terrorists and those determined to be linked to such terrorists. These
sanctions prohibit any transactions or dealings in property or interests in property
of terrorism-related entities or individuals, including the exportation or re-exportation
of any goods or technology either from the U.S. or by U.S. persons. Violations of
these laws or their implementing regulations can result in civil or criminal penalties.

OTHER MEASURES
The U.S. uses a full range of counterterrorism and counterintelligence techniques in
preventing terrorist acts, including the use of human and technical sources; aggressive
undercover operations; analysis of telephone and ﬁnancial records; mail; and physical
surveillance.
The intelligence community also tracks terrorist organizations overseas, including
attempts to recruit members, and the movement of weapons intended for terrorists and
proposed sales to terrorist countries.
The Customs Service (USCS) exchanges information with companies involved in the
manufacture, sale, or export of: munitions or arms, explosive or sensitive materials,
restricted communication technologies or equipment, or components of weapons of
mass destruction. The USCS meets with industry experts to obtain their assistance
in controlling the export of U.S.-origin high technology and munitions items. This
partnership between government and industry enhances national security and fosters
eﬀective export controls.
2(b): What other steps are being taken to prevent the commission of terrorist acts, and
in particular, what early warning mechanisms exist to allow the exchange of information
with other states?
U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have many active and aggressive infor-
mation sharing programs to prevent terrorist acts. Congress has mandated expansion
of international information sharing on immigration and law enforcement matters in
support of worldwide anti-terrorism eﬀorts.
Many nations cooperate actively with the U.S. in ﬁghting terrorism.
Prior to September 11, the U.S. regularly exchanged information on terrorists and
speciﬁc indications of threats in other states with their intelligence agencies. Since
September 11, we have provided expanding streams of information regarding the
responsibility for those terrorist attacks, and information about speciﬁc terrorist
identities and activities through liaison channels. A principal objective is to share vital
anti-terrorist information in as timely and eﬀective a manner as possible.
With some allied governments we share data through bilateral arrangements on
known and suspected terrorists to prevent the issuance of visas and to strengthen
border security. Expansion of this program is anticipated. We use this program to
preclude visa issuance to terrorists, to warn embassies overseas about certain appli-
cants, to alert intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and to enable immigration
and customs oﬃcials at ports of entry to detect terrorists who may have obtained visas.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has law enforcement oﬃcers
stationed abroad who conduct liaisons with host government immigration, police and
security services. INS also maintains a fulltime presence at INTERPOL, working
actively with other federal agents in providing information to police agencies world-
wide. INS also has bilateral information-sharing arrangements with certain of its
counterpart immigration services.
The Legal Attaché program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) enables it
to share information on a broad and timely basis. Direct lines of communication have
been established between the U.S. and many countries to coordinate investigative
resources worldwide.
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
129
 

The private sector is included in the dissemination of information of possible terrorist
threats, particularly in international ﬁnancial and technology transfer matters related
to terrorist activity.
The FBI has established a Counterterrorism Division to further enhance the FBI’s
analysis, information-sharing, and investigative capabilities. The FBI is publicizing
wanted terrorists through various programs including the Top Twenty Terrorist
Program.
The FBI has created an interagency Financial Investigation Group to examine the
ﬁnancial arrangements used to support the terrorist attacks. The FBI headquarters
houses this group, which includes analysts and investigators from numerous federal
agencies and federal prosecutors with backgrounds in investigating and prosecuting
ﬁnancial crimes.
2(c): What legislation or procedures exist for denying safe haven to terrorists, such as
laws for excluding or expelling the types of individuals referred to in this sub-paragraph?
Our legislation contains provisions prohibiting admission of foreign nationals who
have engaged in terrorist activity. It provides for removal of such persons if they are
in the U.S. Also, foreign nationals who are closely associated with or who support
terrorist activity can also be denied admission or removed in certain circumstances
(e.g. foreign nationals who act as representatives of foreign terrorist organizations or
of certain groups that publicly endorse acts of terrorism).
For immigration purposes, the ‘terrorist activity’ deﬁnition includes any unlawful act
involving: hijacking; sabotage; detention under threat for the purpose of coercion
(of a government or an individual); violent attack on an internationally protected
person; assassination; the use of biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons; or the use
of explosives, ﬁrearms, or any other weapon or dangerous device with the intent to
cause harm to individuals or damage to property. The attempt or conspiracy to
commit these acts is also included as ‘terrorist activity.’
The law deﬁnes ‘engage in terrorist activity’ broadly to include committing, inciting,
preparing or planning a terrorist activity; gathering target information; soliciting
funds or resources for terrorist activity or a terrorist organization; soliciting an indi-
vidual to engage in terrorist activity or to join a terrorist organization; and aﬀording
material support (e.g. a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, funds
transfer), false documentation or identiﬁcation, weapons, or training for the com-
mission of terrorist activity to a person who has committed terrorist activity, or to a
terrorist organization.
The Department of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service work
together with other agencies to maintain a robust database of terrorists and terrorism
supporters, to prevent them from receiving visas or gaining access to the U.S.
There are additional terrorism-related grounds for denying admission to the U.S.
Terrorists are ineligible, for example, for temporary protected status, and asylum and
refugee status (see the response in this report to paragraph 3(f) below). There are also
provisions in the U.S. Criminal Code, and the Immigration and Nationality Act, to
prosecute those who harbor or smuggle alien terrorists, or who provide them with
material support (including immigration or other identity documents). In addition,
foreign nationals who provide material assistance to, or solicit it for, certain designated
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

terrorist organizations are inadmissible to the United States or may be deported if
previously admitted. Thirty-nine Terrorist Exclusion List organizations were designated
on December 5, 2001 for this purpose.
As an example of relevant actions, U.S. immigration authorities have excluded from
the U.S. foreign nationals based upon classiﬁed information relating to terrorist activ-
ity. Some of the cases involved attempted entry with fraudulent passports; others
involved immigrants without a valid immigrant visa.
2(d): What legislation or procedures exist to prevent terrorists acting from your territory
against other states or citizens?
Numerous laws address the threat of terrorists acting from U.S. territory against
citizens or interests of other states. Terrorist ﬁnancing and money laundering laws
(see section on paragraph 1 above) are very useful in countering such situations
as providing material support or resources. The provision, in the U.S., of material
support to a foreign terrorist organization is a serious crime under U.S. law and
allows us to take actions which also beneﬁt the anti-terrorist eﬀorts of our overseas
partners in the ﬁght against terrorism. Recently, the U.S. has damaged the
overseas operations of Mujahadin E-Khalq, the Provisional Irish Republican Army,
Hizballah and other foreign terrorist organizations by criminally charging people
in the U.S. with providing or attempting to provide material support or resources to
those organizations. On December 4, 2001 we shut down a Texas-based fundraising
operation whose activities beneﬁted the terrorist activities of Hamas in the Middle
East.
It is a crime to provide, attempt, or conspire to provide within the U.S. material
support or resources, or to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source or owner-
ship of resources, knowing or intending that they are to be used in the commission or
preparation of a wide variety of speciﬁed terrorist related crimes.22 Material support
or resources is very broadly deﬁned and includes, for example, monetary instruments,
ﬁnancial services, lodging, training, documentation, communications, weapons,
personnel, transportation, and other physical assets (except medicine or religious
materials).
It is a crime to knowingly provide or attempt or conspire to provide material support
or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. Again, material support or
resources is very broadly deﬁned.23 U.S. jurisdiction is extraterritorial and the statute
speciﬁcally contemplates the movement of material support or resources from the U.S.
to a foreign terrorist organization outside the U.S.
Providing or collecting funds for the use of terrorists or terrorist organizations is
also a violation of the law.24 Transactions need not be entirely domestic, but rather can

be, and in some cases must be, international to meet the elements of the violation.25
(See the response to paragraph 1 in this report for details.)
In addition to the substantial terms of incarceration and the criminal and civil ﬁnes
imposed for the above violations, the code also authorizes the U.S. to seize and forfeit
funds and other assets involved in violations of §§ 1956, 1957, 2339A, and 2339B and
funds or assets in which terrorists or terrorist organizations have an interest.26 The code
also includes numerous crimes that may be charged against individuals who act from
the U.S. against the citizens of another country or against the interests or facilities of
another country, regardless of whether those citizens, facilities or interests are located
within the U.S. or within that other country.27
Also, the 50 states each have criminal codes that may enable them to punish people
who conspire within their borders to commit serious, terrorist related crimes beyond
the borders of the U.S.
2(e): What steps have been taken to establish terrorist acts as serious criminal oﬀences
and to ensure that the punishment reﬂects the seriousness of such terrorist acts?
Terrorist acts are among the most serious oﬀenses under U.S. law. Violent, terrorist
related crimes generally carry substantially higher criminal penalties and can lead to
imposition of the death penalty, or life imprisonment.28
Earlier this year, after convicting four members of al-Qaida for the bombing of
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, a federal jury in New York City
recommended life imprisonment for all four.
Depending on the defendant’s acts, his criminal history, and his willingness to
cooperate with authorities, there is a range of sentences from which the sentencing
judge may select. In recent years, we have not imposed the death penalty in a federal
international terrorism prosecution.
Terrorist ﬁnancing statutes carry substantial criminal ﬁnes and considerable periods
of incarceration.29 There is only one such case in which a sentence has been imposed.
In that case, a U.S.-based individual was assisting immigrants (including at least one
25 Penalties for each violation can include enhanced criminal ﬁnes and incarceration of up to twenty years.
Section 1957 makes it a crime to engage in a monetary transaction in property derived from speciﬁed
unlawful activity, such as 18 U.S.C. §§ 2339A and/or 2339B. Transactions under § 1957 need not be
entirely domestic, but can be, and in some cases must be, international to meet the elements of the
violation. Penalties for each violation can include criminal ﬁnes and incarceration of up to ten years
26 18 U.S.C. §§ 981 and 982
27 For example, 18 U.S.C. § 956 makes it a crime to conspire to kill, maim, or injure persons or damage
property in a foreign country; 18 U.S.C. § 2332b makes it a crime to engage in acts of terrorism transcend-
ing national boundaries; 18 U.S.C. § 2332a(b) makes it a crime for a national of the United States to use
certain weapons of mass destruction outside the United States; 18 U.S.C. § 1116 the murder or man-
slaughter of foreign oﬃcials, oﬃcial guests, or internationally protected persons a crime; 18 U.S.C. § 1119
makes a foreign murder of a U.S. national a crime; 18 U.S.C. § 32 makes it a crime to destroy aircraft of
aircraft facilities within or outside the U.S.; and ﬁnally, 49 U.S.C. §§ 46502–46507 make it a crime to
engage in aircraft piracy or carry a weapon or explosive on an aircraft
28  E.g. 18 U.S.C. § § 2332a and 2332b
29 While the terrorist ﬁnancing statutes at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2339A and 2339B each authorize imposition of a
period of 15 years incarceration for each violation, under the Sentencing Guidelines, a multiple count
conviction could result in a sentence of considerably more time than 15 years

aﬃliated with a foreign terrorist organization) to fraudulently obtain enhanced
immigration status. The defendant pled guilty and agreed to cooperate with federal
authorities. This defendant received a sentence of two years of incarceration without
any possibility of parole and three years of supervision.
The money laundering statutes also carry considerable penalties.30 U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines provide for substantial enhancement of the prescribed period of incarcer-
ation in instances where terrorist activity is involved.
2(f): What procedures and mechanisms are in place to assist other states?
The U.S. provides assistance for criminal investigations or proceedings relating to
terrorist acts through bilateral programs and as an active participant in multilateral
programs.
The U.S. provides training and technical assistance on money laundering and ﬁnan-
cial investigations to law enforcement, regulatory, and prosecutorial counterparts. The
programs beneﬁt anti-terrorist eﬀorts by assisting other nations’ anti-money laundering
programs; assisting in creating ﬁnancial intelligence units; and training ﬁnancial
investigators, bank regulators, and prosecutors to recognize and investigate suspicious
transactions.
The U.S. maintains mutual legal assistance treaties and agreements with over 45
countries, with more in negotiation or signed and awaiting Senate approval. They
provide assistance in the investigation, prosecution, and suppression of criminal
oﬀenses, including those related to terrorism. For example, such treaties typically obli-
gate the U.S. to provide foreign investigators and prosecutors with ﬁnancial records,
witness statements and testimony, and assistance in freezing and forfeiting criminally
derived assets. Even in the absence of a treaty relationship, the U.S. may, under
appropriate circumstances, provide a host of evidential assistance to foreign countries
pursuant to our domestic law. The U.S. acts on hundreds of foreign requests for
assistance in criminal matters every year.
We assist in training other countries’ counterterrorism task forces. Training includes
major case management, terrorist crime scene management, advanced kidnapping
investigations, and ﬁnancial underpinnings of terrorism. Also, we make personnel
available for assistance on a case-by-case basis. Pertinent information is shared on a
regular basis with law enforcement entities around the world.
The U.S. also maintains overseas International Law Enforcement Academies. Their
courses include segments on ﬁnancial crime and money laundering.
2(g): How do border controls in your country prevent the movement of terrorists? How do
your procedures for issuance of identity papers and travel documents support this? What
measures exist to prevent their forgery etc?
With few exceptions, all non-U.S. citizens entering the U.S. must have a valid visa or be
exempted by holding a passport from one of 29 countries approved for visa waiver.
30 The maximum period of incarceration for a single violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 is 20 years. The maximum
period of incarceration for a single violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957 is 10 years

Every visa applicant is subject to a name check through a database containing nearly
six million records. At entry, everyone is subject to inspection. Inspectors are well
trained to determine counterfeit and altered documents, and to detect evasive or
untruthful responses. Every entering visitor is subject to checks in databases.
A new, tamper-resistant visa will shortly replace the current visa. We are also working
to improve the exchange of data among our agencies to ensure that anyone with a
history of involvement with terrorism is quickly identiﬁed.
Because of long common borders, movements to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico
are diﬃcult to control. Although cooperation with those governments is good, we are
engaged in renewed discussions with both governments to improve border controls.
American citizens must have a U.S. passport to enter the U.S. unless they have
been traveling in North, Central or South America, in which case they may use
other documents to verify their citizenship and identity. As we have no national
identity card, the INS may rely on several other documents to establish identity and
citizenship.
Applicants for U.S. passports are required to prove their citizenship and identity.
Those who fail to meet strict evidentiary requirements are not issued a passport.
In addition, a vigorous fraud prevention program trains staﬀ to identify attempts to
use valid or falsiﬁed documents to obtain a passport in another identity. We can track
how many passports one individual has received, and a system is being deployed to
better track lost and stolen passports. The U.S. passport itself has recently been
upgraded to prevent photographic substitution, the major form of alteration, and to
make counterfeiting of the document very diﬃcult. Visas are not issued to known
terrorists.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service also maintains a very proﬁcient Forensic
Document Laboratory (FDL), which helps other immigration services to identify
fraudulent documents and trends. It routinely prepares ‘Document Alerts’ on new,
revised, counterfeit, and altered U.S. and foreign documents. Such alerts have been the
basis for both criminal and administrative actions taken against individuals presenting
counterfeit or altered documents. The FDL also works very actively to ensure that
security marks and checks are embedded in travel and immigration documents, to
minimize counterfeiting or alteration.
The U.S. Border Patrol detects and prevents the smuggling and illegal entry of for-
eign nationals, primarily between the Ports of Entry. Agents perform their duties along,
and in the vicinity of, the 8,000 land and 2,000 coastal miles of U.S. boundaries. In all
its enforcement activities, the Border Patrol coordinates with counterterrorism eﬀorts.
In aviation security, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a series of
security advisories to U.S. and foreign air carriers to enhance passenger and baggage
screening requirements, to establish stricter controls on general aviation and tighten the
rules on belly cargo in passenger planes. These measures, along with hardening cockpit
doors, have upgraded the security of ﬂights to, from and within the U.S.
Threat assessments by U.S. agencies are continuous and the FAA passes information
about terrorists or suspected mala ﬁde passengers on a real time basis to airlines. Pas-
sengers are subject to multiple checks of their identity and bona ﬁdes from the time
they apply for a visa to the point that they enter the U.S. If derogatory information is
developed after the visa is issued, there are points at which the suspect can be appre-
hended and turned over to law enforcement services. In addition, the U.S. requires the
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

advance transmission of passenger (and crew) manifests from all U.S.-bound ﬂights.
To help ensure that cockpit crews operating to the U.S. are not compromised by terror-
ist elements, the FAA has instituted additional requirements for background checks on
pilots, co-pilots, and ﬂight engineers.
U.S. aviation security experts participate fully in the work of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) to strengthen the security annex (#17) to the Chicago
Convention. Many recommended practices in the current annex are expected to be
elevated to mandatory standards.
The U.S. is an active participant in the ICAO Working Group on Machine-Readable
Travel Documents, which has been working for more than a decade to establish inter-
national standards for passports, other travel documents, visas, and identity cards.
Current U.S. travel documents and visas conform to the standards developed by this
group and adopted by ICAO. Many countries have also improved their documents so
they are more reliable.
UNSCR 1373 Operative Paragraph 3
3(a): What steps have been taken to intensify and accelerate the exchange of operational
information in the areas indicated in this sub-paragraph?
The U.S. is making extensive eﬀorts to accelerate the exchange of operational informa-
tion in these areas with other states. Through a series of bilateral meetings and
multinational conferences since September 11, senior oﬃcials have discussed the need
for faster sharing of information.
Multilaterally we have particularly worked with the Financial Action Task Force, the
Egmont and Lyon Groups, the Group of 7 and Group of 20, the IMF and other
international ﬁnancial institutions and the Group of Eight (G-8) counter terrorism
dialogue (including the Counterterrorism Experts Group).
We have also worked with regional organizations such as the Organization of
American States, the Organization of African Unity, the Association of South East
Asian Nations, the European Union, the Council of Europe, the Asia Paciﬁc Economic
Cooperation forum, the Manila Framework Group and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
Exchanging Operational Information
Since September 11, contacts between U.S. law enforcement oﬃcials and prosecutors
and foreign oﬃcials have intensiﬁed. Legal Attaches overseas and foreign police
authorities regularly share criminal intelligence. Operational information is also
exchanged between U.S. and foreign prosecutors. Such exchanges are facilitated
through designated ‘central authorities’ under each of the U.S. Mutual Legal Assistance
Treaties (MLATs). U.S. authorities and international organizations, such as INTER-
POL, share operational information on the detection of fraudulent documents and
alerts on terrorist suspects.
Exchanging Information on Arms, Explosives and Weapons of Mass Destruction,
the U.S. works with other nations to exchange operational information on terrorists,
arms traﬃcking, explosives or sensitive materials, and weapons of mass destruction
threats.
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E

We participate in multilateral export control regimes and encourage information
sharing on weapons and associated technology that may be diverted to terrorists.
Wassenaar Arrangement members recently agreed that preventing terrorist access to
conventional weapons and associated dual-use items is an important new focus. We
continue to take the lead in stressing the value of data exchanges on small arms/light
weapons between OSCE and Wassenaar Arrangement countries.
The U.S. National Tracing Center assists other nations to trace U.S.-origin weapons
used in terrorist or criminal activities. Our assistance program for weapons stockpile
management and security and destruction of surplus weapons is further sharing of
information, focusing on countries with a high risk of illicit arms transfers, to keep
these weapons from terrorists.
The U.S. also exchanges information through bilateral, regional and multilateral
initiatives to eliminate opportunities for terrorists to acquire weapons of mass destruc-
tion (WMD). Over 30 countries have cooperated with us to make counterterrorism an
important new focus of the Australia Group (chemical/biological nonproliferation
regime).
The work of other regimes—the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear
Suppliers Group, and the Zangger Committee—also is relevant to keeping sensitive
technologies out of terrorists’ hands.
The U.S. works with the International Atomic Energy Agency and other organiza-
tions to increase the exchange of information aimed at strengthening controls over
WMD-related materials and technologies. This has included export control dialogues,
such as the Central Asian State Export Control and Border Security Program.
The G-8 Nonproliferation Experts Group (NPEG) develops action plans to
strengthen international instruments to prevent WMD proliferation, protect sensitive
materials and facilities, encourage wider adherence to the principles of international
export control arrangements, reinforce and better coordinate assistance programs, and
enhance information exchange on illicit traﬃcking of sensitive materials, technology
and expertise.
The U.S. is also a key participant in the G-7 Nuclear Safety Working Group
(NSWG), which works to strengthen controls on radiological sources.
Technology Transfer and Skills Training
The U.S. uses other programs to enhance exchanges of information among law
enforcement agencies. These include the Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP), which
provides information and training to identify terrorist suspects seeking to cross bor-
ders, and the Antiterrorism Assistance program, which provides assistance for border
patrol and airport security. The U.S. is also helping INTERPOL to modernize equip-
ment for faster transmission of ﬁngerprints and other graphics to TIP participants.
Customs Information and Enforcement
Under U.S. law, air carriers must provide advance passenger information to U.S. Cus-
toms by electronic transmission and prior to arrival in the United States. With this
information, law enforcement agencies should be able to screen passengers to obtain
information about the movement of suspected terrorists while reducing delays for
other passengers entering the United States.
U.S Customs maintains mutual assistance agreements with other countries’ customs
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

agencies, which allow the sharing of information during an investigation on the
movements of people and cargo across borders.
3(b): What steps have been taken to exchange information and cooperate in the areas
indicated in this sub-paragraph?
The U.S. has stepped up information exchanges through law enforcement and intelli-
gence channels to prevent terrorist acts.
We have mutual legal assistance treaties and agreements (see section 2 above for
details). These provide for the exchange of information and evidence in investigating
and prosecuting criminal oﬀenses, and for the suppression or prevention of such
oﬀenses. Law enforcement cooperation to prevent terrorist acts has been enhanced by
the broadened use of the U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force domestically and the Legal
Attaché Program internationally.
Our intelligence and national security organizations have active programs to detect,
preempt, disrupt, and defeat international terrorism. Many nations cooperate with us
in ﬁghting terrorism through information exchanges.
3(c): What steps have been taken to exchange information and cooperate in the areas
indicated in this sub-paragraph?
We have in place an extensive series of bilateral and multilateral agreements, such as
MLATs (see above) for cooperation in preventing terrorist attacks and investigating
and prosecuting perpetrators.
In addition, the U.S. is party to ten of the twelve international conventions and
protocols relating to terrorism, and expects to ratify the two most recent conventions
(Terrorist Bombings and Terrorism Financing) in the near future. U.S. law enforcement
authorities continue to cooperate with their counterparts in various countries around
the world on the prevention of terrorist attacks and the investigation and prosecution
of those who commit such acts, pursuant to the relevant agreements and other
arrangements.
The U.S. has prosecuted and convicted domestic and international terrorists in
dozens of cases.
Speciﬁcally the U.S. has prosecuted cases under U.S. laws implementing the Montreal
Convention (Aircraft Sabotage),31 the Hague Convention (Hijacking),32 the Hostages
Convention,33 and the Internationally Protected Persons Convention.34

In addition, the U.S. has signed and expects to ratify in the near future the Inter-
national Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the International
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Implementing legisla-
tion for both has been submitted to the Congress.
The U.S. has implemented Security Council resolutions 1269 and 1368 by working
to become a party to all twelve of the conventions and protocols relating to terrorism,
by fully implementing those agreements to which it is a party, and by establishing and
implementing the measures discussed elsewhere in this submission.
3(f): What legislation, procedures and mechanisms are in place for ensuring asylum
seekers have not been involved in terrorist activity before granting refugee status?
The U.S. has several measures to ensure that asylum seekers have not been involved in
terrorist activity before it grants them refugee status. A directive issued by President
Bush on October 29, 2001 creates a Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force strengthening
existing procedures. The Task Force will coordinate U.S. programs to: (1) deny entry of
foreign nationals associated with, suspected of being engaged in or supporting terrorist
activity; and (2) locate, detain, prosecute, or deport such foreign nationals in the U.S.
The U.S. grants refugee status in two diﬀerent forms: a) individuals applying from
abroad may be admitted as refugees; b) refugees in the U.S. may be granted asylum. To
be eligible for either status, an applicant must establish that he or she is unable or
unwilling to return home because of past persecution or well-founded fear of future
persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social
group, or political opinion.
The U.S. is a party to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, through
which it undertook obligations found in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of
Refugees. U.S. law contains several provisions that, together, implement the grounds
for exclusion of refugee status found in the 1951 Convention including denial of refugee
status to those involved in terrorist activity.
Under U.S. law, those who apply for refugee status from outside the country
are generally subject to the same grounds of inadmissibility as other applicants and
cannot be granted refugee status if those grounds apply. Under the law, foreign
nationals who engage in terrorist activity are inadmissible (see Section 2(c) above). This
provision is enforced in the overseas refugee program through a screening process
that relies on applicant interviews by U.S. immigration oﬃcials, checks of appropriate
information databases, and security referral procedures to review and investigate cases.
Experts provide consultative guidance on questionnaires, biometrics and other
security mechanisms to immigration oﬃcials who adjudicate refugee protection claims.
Slightly diﬀerent safeguards apply in the domestic program. The law excludes
from asylum any person who has engaged or may engage in terrorist activity,
who incites terrorist activity, or who is a knowing member of a terrorist organization.
Representatives of a terrorist organization, or of certain groups whose endorsement of
44 18 U.S.C. §§ 841(o)–(p), 842(l)–(o), 844 (a)(1) & 845(c), 19 U.S.C. § 1595a, 18 U.S.C. § 842(m)–(o)

terrorism undermines U.S. counterterrorism eﬀorts, are also barred from asylum. An
individual may also be excluded from asylum if there are good reasons for regarding
the individual as a danger to the security of the U.S., or for believing that the indi-
vidual has committed a serious non-political crime. U.S. law interpreting the serious
non-political crime provisions make clear that, even if the crime involves political
motivations, it is considered nonpolitical if it is grossly out of proportion to the polit-
ical objective, or if it involves acts of an atrocious nature. These provisions are enforced
by screening procedures relying on ﬁngerprint and identity checks and on databases
that have information on criminal and terrorist activity.
3(g): What procedures are in place to prevent the abuse of refugee status by terrorists?
Please provide details of legislation and/or administrative procedures which prevent claims
of political motivation being recognized as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition
of alleged terrorists.
Once refugee or asylum status has been granted, U.S. law prohibits the abuse of such
status by terrorists. The Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force created by Presidential
Directive in October 2001 (see 3(f) above) coordinates programs to locate, detain, pros-
ecute, or deport foreign nationals in the U.S. who are suspected of being engaged in or
supporting terrorist activity.
Persons admitted from abroad as refugees are subject to removal from the U.S. if
they have engaged, or are engaged, in any terrorist activity, notwithstanding their refu-
gee status. Also, in every case, a refugee is required to submit to inspection by INS at
the end of one year. An immigration oﬃcial examines the refugee to determine
whether any grounds of inadmissibility apply and may deny the refugee permanent
resident status on terrorism grounds.
Similar safeguards ensure terrorists do not abuse asylum. Asylum can be terminated
if it is determined that the asylee is subject to any of the bars to asylum, which include
speciﬁc provisions excluding terrorists, as well as provisions excluding those who have
committed serious nonpolitical crimes and those who can reasonability be regarded as
a danger to the security of the U.S.
Many modern U.S. extradition treaties provide that the political oﬀense exception
to extradition is not available for certain criminal oﬀenses associated with terrorism,
e.g. murder or other willful crimes against a head of state or family member and
terrorist oﬀenses speciﬁed in multilateral international agreements. These treaty provi-
sions are U.S. law and have been applied in a number of cases.
The U.S. also has signed and expects to ratify in the near future two multilateral
terrorism conventions, those relating to Terrorist Bombings and Terrorist Financing,
which have the eﬀect of limiting the political oﬀense exception to extradition.

Reply to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, 14 June 2002 Security
Council resolution 1373 (2001)
Paragraph 1(a): Improved Coordination at Home: Does the US have a specialist counter-
terrorism body or is that the responsibility of a number of departments or agencies? In the
latter case, how is coordination among the various entities eﬀected? Does each agency
deﬁne its strategy independently, or does it carry out measures that have been established
at a higher level? Who determines that policy and, if applicable, the distribution of tasks
among agencies?
The United States is engaged in an ongoing eﬀort to improve its ability to combat
terrorism. On June 6, 2002, President Bush announced that he would ask the Congress
to create a cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security. The new department
would include many functions now performed by existing departments, agencies and
bureaus. The creation of the new department will take time, especially since new legis-
lation will be required. We will inform the CTC when these changes are in place. In the
meantime, responsibility for combating terrorism is organized as follows: The National
Security Council (NSC), created by the National Security Act of 1947, coordinates the
President’s national security policies among the various Executive Branch departments
and agencies and ensures their eﬀective development and implementation. On October
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
141
 

8, 2001, through Executive Order 13228, the President created the Oﬃce of Homeland
Security (OHS) within the Executive Branch to develop and coordinate the implemen-
tation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the U.S. from terrorist threats or
attacks. OHS coordinates the Executive Branch’s eﬀorts to detect, prepare for, prevent,
protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States.
OHS works with executive departments and agencies, state and local governments, and
private entities to ensure that the national strategy is adequate. The same executive
order established the Homeland Security Council, as a counterpart to the NSC. The
Homeland Security Council advises and assists the President with all aspects of home-
land security. It also ensures the eﬀective coordination, development, and implementa-
tion of security policy. On October 9, 2001, the President established the Oﬃce for
Combating Terrorism under the direction of the National Director and Deputy
National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism. This person, who serves as the
President’s principal advisor on the international and domestic dimensions related to
combating global terrorism, reports to the Assistant to the President for National
Security Aﬀairs and to the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. He is
responsible for coordinating diplomatic, trade, ﬁnancial, foreign assistance, foreign
training and other programs to ensure support for counter-terrorism objectives. He
chairs an interagency group that supports this mission. On October 16, 2001, the
President established the President’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board (CIPB).
The CIPB recommends policies and coordinates programs for protecting critical infra-
structure such as power grids, bridges, dams and gas lines and the information systems
that support such assets. To ensure coordination between the NSC and the OHS, the
Chair of the CIPB reports to both the Assistant to the President for National Security
Aﬀairs and to the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. Many departments
and agencies have responsibilities and authorities for developing and managing
counter-terrorism initiatives, assistance or programs. These eﬀorts are guided by the
principles contained in the annual National Security Strategy, and by the forthcoming,
inaugural editions of the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism, the National
Strategy for Homeland Security, and the National Strategy for Cyber Security.
Responsibility for diﬀerent aspects of the war on terrorist ﬁnancing is also distributed
among many departments of the U.S. Government. The Treasury Department chairs
an inter-agency group that coordinates U.S. eﬀorts against terrorist ﬁnancing. This
process involves experts and policy makers from the Departments of State, Treasury,
Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the intelligence community, and the White
House (NSC). Additional subgroups support the work of the interagency committee
by establishing potential targets, deciding appropriate action for each of the targets,
and building international cooperation.
Please indicate the dates on which the International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organ-
ized Crime are to be ratiﬁed. Has a program of ratiﬁcation already been embarked on?
The Senate gave advice and consent to ratiﬁcation of the Terrorism Financing Conven-
tion on December 5, 2001, and the President has signed the instrument of ratiﬁcation.
Legislation necessary to implement the Convention passed the House of Representa-
tives on December 20, 2001, and currently is pending in the Senate. The United States
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
142
 
www.ebook3000.com

expects to deposit its instrument of ratiﬁcation as soon as the necessary implementing
legislation is enacted. The United States signed the Transnational Organized Crime
Convention on December 13, 2000, and expects to transmit the Convention very shortly
to the Senate for advice and consent to ratiﬁcation. No implementing legislation is
envisaged, so ratiﬁcation would follow directly after Senate action and signature of the
instrument of ratiﬁcation by the President.
Are natural or legal persons other than banks (e.g. attorneys, notaries or other intermedi-
aries) required to report suspicious transactions to the public authorities, and if so, what
are the penalties that apply to a person who omits to report, either willfully or by
negligence?
In addition to banks, the regulations (31 Code of Federal Regulations 103.18, 103.19)
implementing the Bank Secrecy Act (31 United States Code 5318(g)) require the
following persons and entities to ﬁle suspicious activity reports:
•
Thrifts, savings & loan associations, and credit unions (which the regulations deﬁne
as ‘banks’);
•
Money transmitters, issuers/sellers/redeemers of traveler’s checks, money orders,
and stored value; and
•
The United States Postal Service.
In addition, recent statutory amendments to 31 U.S.C. 5318 made by Section 356 of
the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, Public Law 107–56 (October 26, 2001—the
‘USA PATRIOT Act’), require Treasury to publish a ﬁnal rule by July 1, 2002, requir-
ing broker-dealers in securities to ﬁle suspicious activity reports. The rule has been
published for comment, 66 Federal Register 67670 (December 31, 2001), and is being
ﬁnalized for publication prior to July 1. A rule requiring casinos to report suspicious
activity was published March 29, 2002, 67 F.R. 15138, and is expected to be ﬁnalized
during the summer of 2002. Congress also has required the Treasury Department to
determine whether commodities brokers should be required to report suspicious trans-
actions pursuant to the Section 5318 amendments cited above, and to study whether
investment companies should be brought within the Bank Secrecy Act regulations,
including those requiring the reporting of suspicious transactions. Both projects are
ongoing. The investment company report is due October 25, 2002. The Bank Secrecy
Act provides both civil and criminal penalties for violations of the implementing
regulations, including those mandating suspicious activity reporting. Civil penalties
(31 U.S.C. 5321) can be based on willful violations, negligent violations, or patterns of
negligent violations. For willful violations, civil penalties may be imposed of up to the
greater of the amount of the transaction (not to exceed $100,000) or $25,000. For
negligent violations, civil penalties may not exceed $500. For a pattern of negligent
violations, a civil penalty of up to $50,000 may be imposed. A civil penalty may be
imposed notwithstanding the imposition of a criminal penalty for the same violation.
Criminal penalties (31 U.S.C. 5322) may be imposed for willful violations of the regula-
tions in an amount up to $250,000, the violator may be imprisoned for up to ﬁve years,
or both sanctions may be imposed. Where the violation is part of a pattern of any
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
143
 

illegal activity involving more than $100,000 in any twelve-month period, or occurs in
conjunction with the violation of another law of the United States, a ﬁne of $500,000,
or up to ten years’ imprisonment, or both, may be imposed.
Paragraph 1(b): Providing Support to Terrorists: Does the oﬀence of ‘support to a Foreign
Terrorist Organization’ arise only with regard to the terrorist organizations included in a
list drawn up under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act? Can proceed-
ings be instituted against the accomplices of a terrorist organization that is not yet listed?
If not, how would the United States deal with such a problem?
The United States Criminal Code has at least two distinct provisions that can be
applied to those who lend material support or resources to terrorists. Perhaps, the
most widely recognized provision is 18 U.S.C. 2339B, which makes it a federal crime to
knowingly provide or attempt or conspire to provide material support or resources to
a foreign terrorist organization, which has been designated as such by the Secretary of
State, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury.
Section 2339A enables the United States to prosecute those who provide, or attempt or
conspire to provide, material support or resources for use in the commission of a wide
variety of crimes, including terrorist related crimes. Those who conceal or disguise the
nature, location, source of ownership of materials for use in the commission of a crime
and those who aid in the escape of those committing such crimes can also be pros-
ecuted. (As with 2339B, the term ‘material support or resources’ is very broadly
deﬁned to mean ‘currency or monetary instruments or ﬁnancial securities, ﬁnancial
services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safe houses, false documentation
or identiﬁcation, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances,
explosives, personnel, transportation, and other physical assets, except medicine or
religious materials.) Charges under 2339A may be brought whether or not a designated
foreign terrorist organization is involved in the violation. (Penalties for each violation
can include criminal ﬁnes and incarceration of up to ﬁfteen years or life.)
In addition, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701–1706
(IEEPA), authorizes the President to exercise broad emergency powers when he has
declared a national emergency to deal with a threat to the national security, foreign
policy, or economy of the United States. Pursuant to IEEPA, the President issued
Executive Orders 12947 of January 23, 1995, and 13099 of August 20, 1998 (both
entitled ‘Prohibiting Transactions that Threaten to Disrupt the Middle East Peace
Process’), and Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001 (‘Blocking Property and
Prohibiting Transactions with Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support
Terrorism’), which designated terrorist groups and individuals, and delegated authority
to, as appropriate, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury, in consult-
ation with each other and the Attorney General, to designate further entities and
individuals (persons), including, among others, persons providing ﬁnancial, material,
or technological support for, or services in support of, terrorist acts or for other
designated persons, as well as persons the Secretary of the Treasury determines are
owned or controlled by, or act for or on behalf of other designated persons. The
Executive orders block the assets of and prohibit transactions with designated persons.
Knowing violation of these prohibitions is a federal crime, and civil remedies are also
provided.

Is the concept of ‘a Foreign Terrorist Organization’ to be understood as ‘a foreign organ-
ization’ that ‘engages in terrorist activity’ that ‘threatens the security of United States
nationals or the security of the United States’ (section 219 INA)? If so, what measures
are there to prevent or punish acts committed by terrorist organizations operating from
the United States, by fund-raising for example, but for a cause not likely to aﬀect United
States interests?
For the purposes of designation of foreign terrorist organizations in connection with
18 U.S.C. 2339B, a foreign terrorist organization is (1) a foreign organization, (2) that
engages in terrorist activity, which (3) threatens the security of United States nationals
or the security of the United States, as prescribed pursuant to 219 of the INA. Any
United States-based fund-raising activity on behalf of a terrorist organization, even
those organizations whose acts of terrorism did not target the United States, would
likely easily meet the threshold level of threat to the security of United States nationals
or the security of the United States, as prescribed pursuant to 219 of the INA. In
addition, the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 2339A, described above, and the provisions of the
IEEPA, also described above, are available to prevent and punish acts committed by
terrorist organizations operating from the United States.
Paragraph 1(d): Does the United States have any means of monitoring ﬁnancial activ-
ities, in particular fund-raising, by non-governmental associations or organizations? If so,
please provide an outline.
No single agency exclusively regulates fundraising. Federal or state government agencies
regulate aspects or fund-raising, depending on the subject matter and context Monitor-
ing non-governmental associations or organizations involves federal and state govern-
mental oversight and private sector self-regulation. Most fund-raising is conducted by
tax-exempt organizations, which must meet certain requirements of federal tax law to
establish and maintain their exemptions. The federal government administers the
federal income tax laws, as well as other federal laws that aﬀect charitable fund-raising.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) administers the federal tax law requirements that
apply to tax-exempt organizations. The IRS focuses on the operations of organizations
to determine whether their activities and funds further purposes recognized by the tax
law as eligible for exemption. The state governments also regulate other aspects of non-
proﬁt organizations, including fund-raising. A majority of states have adopted uniform
legislation entitled ‘Model Act Concerning the Solicitation of Funds for Charitable
Purposes.’ This act requires non-proﬁt organizations to register before raising funds
and to comply with consumer protection standards. The attorney general’s oﬃce of
each state has authority to enforce compliance with the state’s fund-raising laws as well
as its non-proﬁt corporation laws under which organizations are created.
The charitable and philanthropic sector complements governmental oversight
through ‘watchdog’ groups, management support organizations, and infrastructure
groups.

I. Federal regulation
A. Federal tax system
1. TAX REPORTING
•
In general, associations, organizations, and trusts are subject to income taxation
unless they are exempt under speciﬁc provisions of federal income tax law. Taxable
organizations ﬁle annual tax returns with the IRS, just as any other taxable entity
or individual. The tax return of a taxable organization that raised funds would
show little about the use of the funds apart from information needed to determine
tax liability.
•
Tax-exempt organizations, except for churches, small organizations, and certain
others, ﬁle annual information returns rather than tax returns. The information
return (Form 990 for most organizations; Form 990-PF for a private foundation)
requires organizations to report information about activities in addition to ﬁnancial
information, including assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
•
A signiﬁcant feature of the U.S. system is that information returns ﬁled by tax-
exempt organizations are not conﬁdential, as are tax returns. Thus, the information
organizations provide on Form 990 or Form 990-PF is available to the public.
2. TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS
•
Tax-exempt organizations do not normally pay taxes on their income.
•
Organizations eligible for tax-exempt status under section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal
Revenue Code include charitable, religious, educational, or scientiﬁc organizations.
They must be organized as not-for-proﬁt organizations, which means they cannot
have, or distribute income to, private owners. They must also meet an organiza-
tional test and an operational test:
•
The organizational test requires that the documents creating the organization (art-
icles of incorporation, trust documents, etc.) contain certain standard provisions.
For example, the documents must provide that the organization is created
exclusively for charitable purposes and that its assets will only go for charitable
purposes if the organization dissolves. The operational test looks at the organiza-
tion’s operations. It must primarily engage in activities that accomplish tax-exempt
purposes. It must operate for public rather than private purposes, and insiders may
not unduly beneﬁt from its operations. It cannot intervene in political campaigns,
and may do only a limited amount of lobbying.
•
There are two types of 501(c)(3) organizations: public charities and private founda-
tions. Public charities include churches, schools, hospitals, and organizations that
receive broad public support from public contributions. They are not subject to the
strict operational controls and special taxes that are imposed on private foundations.
•
Private foundations generally are charitable organizations supported by investment
income rather than contributions, and are often controlled by family members.
They are subject to a number of excise taxes to assure that their assets beneﬁt
charitable purposes rather than private interests. These taxes prevent insider deal-
ings and other speciﬁed activities, and mandate a minimum level of charitable
distributions.

3. REGULATION OF TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS
•
The IRS oversees tax-exempt organizations through the Oﬃce of the Director,
Exempt Organizations (‘EO’) in its Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division
(‘TE/GE’). EO has three primary functions: rulings, examinations, and customer
education and outreach.
•
The rulings program, among other functions, processes applications for recognition
of tax exemption to determine if organizations meet the requirements for exemp-
tion. Except for churches and certain small charities, all organizations must apply to
the Internal Revenue Service to be recognized as 501(c)(3) organizations. The IRS
will review the application to ensure that the requirements for exemption are met.
•
The examination program monitors compliance with the tax laws by reviewing and
verifying the annual information returns ﬁled by tax-exempt organizations. It
also conducts audits to determine whether organizations continue to operate as
required by the tax laws, and assesses taxes and imposes other sanctions for
non-compliance.
•
The customer education and outreach program works with tax-exempt organiza-
tions to help them understand and meet their responsibilities under the tax laws.
•
The IRS may deny an organization’s application for tax-exempt status, or revoke its
existing tax-exempt status, if the organization does not comply with federal tax law.
A revocation means that the organization becomes taxable and, in the case of a
section 501(c)(3) charity, that donors will receive no tax beneﬁts from contributions
to the organization. Revocation may also cause the state in which the organization is
organized to take action to ensure its assets are used for charitable purposes.
4. DATA AVAILABLE ON SPECIFIC TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS
•
In general, tax-exempt organizations ﬁle an application to obtain their status
(Form 1023 for 501(c)(3) organizations and Form 1024 for other exempt organiza-
tions). If the application is approved, a copy of the application is available to the
public from the IRS and should be available from the organization as well.
•
The application contains the organizational documents and description of the
organization’s intended activities as of the date of application. It will also disclose
the principal oﬃcers and recent ﬁnancial history. Once an application is approved,
no subsequent application is made even if the organization substantially changes
its activities. Consequently, it is possible that the information on the application
may be outdated and not indicative of the organization’s current activities. If an
organization changes its activities, it is asked to inform the IRS of the change, but
the IRS does not make the notice of change public.
•
As indicated above, the annual information returns prepared by tax-exempt organ-
izations (Forms 990 and 990-PF) are available to the public, except for the organ-
ization’s list of contributors. The returns list assets and liabilities, income and
expenses for each year.
•
Contribution income and fund-raising expenses are separately itemized.
•
Contribution income and fund-raising expense reporting has not always proven to
be reliable, or consistent from organization to organization. Tax exempt organiza-
tions may try to minimize reported expenses so that their operations appear to be
more eﬃcient than they actually are. This might be done by disguising fund-raising
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
147
 

expenses as charitable program expenses, or by ‘netting’ contribution income
against fundraising expenses (and not reporting the actual amounts netted).
•
Organizations must show the total amount of grants made, but do not necessarily
list particular recipients.
•
Forms 990 and 990-PF are available from the IRS, and the organization must
provide copies of its three most recent annual returns to anyone who asks. This
requirement has facilitated eﬀorts in the private sector to make information about
tax-exempt organizations widely available. (See, for example, www.guidestar.org, a
web site dedicated to making information returns and other information about
charitable organizations easily accessible.)
•
Tax returns and other documents that are not publicly available for inspection are
generally not available for any purpose other than for federal tax administration.
Examples of documents that are not publicly available are lists of contributors, ﬁles
concerning the denial or revocation of tax-exempt status, and tax returns of entities
that are subject to tax.
•
There are certain exceptions allowing disclosure of tax information to other federal
or state agencies for enforcement purposes.
B. Federal trade commission
•
The Federal Trade Commission (the ‘FTC’) regulates the practices of telemarketers
and direct mail advertisers that promote and sell products and services to the
public.
•
In the Crimes Against Charitable Americans Act of 2001 (signed into law on
October 26, 2001), the law extended the FTC’s jurisdiction over telemarketing and
consumer fraud to include charitable solicitations. It increases criminal sanctions
against persons who fraudulently solicit charitable contributions in connection
with the commission of other federal crimes.
II. State regulation
•
State regulation of charities vary among the 50 states, though 38 states have adopted
charitable solicitation statutes.
•
Charitable solicitation statutes provide the public with a means to obtain informa-
tion about charities that solicit contributions in the state. They also help protect the
public against solicitation fraud and misrepresentation.
•
Typically, charitable solicitation statutes require a charity to register with a state
agency before making any solicitation for contributions. Most states have certain
exceptions, often for religious organizations, but these exemptions are not uniform
among the states. Registration is generally done annually.
•
Some states require annual audited ﬁnancial statements to be submitted by the
soliciting charities. Generally, these are available for public review.
•
Some states also require individuals or contractors soliciting for contributions on
behalf of charities to register annually with state agencies, and provide copies of
their fund-raising contracts. Some states also require fund-raising counsel to register
with the state. Generally, registration forms and contracts are public.
•
34 states accept a Uniﬁed Registration Statement in lieu of their own registration
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
148
 
www.ebook3000.com

requirements. This makes registration more convenient for organizations that
solicit contributions in many states.
•
Most states with solicitation statutes authorize the state attorney general to
prosecute violations, including fraud and misrepresentation.
•
States currently are faced with the problem of solicitation through the internet.
•
State charity oﬃcials have formed the National Association of State Charities
Oﬃcials (‘NASCO’). It works for greater uniformity and cooperation among
the states, including promoting the ‘Model Act Concerning the Solicitation of
Funds for Charitable Purposes,’ and coordinates with IRS Exempt Organizations
Division. (NASCO’s web site is www.nasconet.org.)
III. Private sector institutions
•
The U.S. has a vibrant private charitable sector that complements government
oversight. A variety of watchdog groups, management support organizations, and
infrastructure organizations serve to increase visibility and accountability, increase
eﬀectiveness, and promote high standards in non-proﬁt organizations.
•
Watchdog organizations help donors make informed choices by providing
information about how eﬀectively or honestly a charity soliciting funds may be
operating. Examples include Guidestar, mentioned above, and the Better Business
Bureau Wise Giving Alliance, which collects and distributes information about
programs, practices, and ﬁnances of many charitable organizations soliciting
contributions nationwide. (See www.give.org.)
•
Some organizations focus on concerns of the non-proﬁt community or particular
segments of it. For example, Independent Sector is a coalition of more than 700
national organizations, foundations, and corporate philanthropy programs that
serves to promote, strengthen, and advance the non-proﬁt and philanthropic com-
munity to foster private initiative for the public good. Its broad mission includes
helping organizations improve both accountability and eﬀectiveness. (See, www.
independentsector.org.) Other organizations focus eﬀorts on a segment of the
non-proﬁt community. For example, the Evangelical Council for Financial
Accountability (‘ECFA’) comprises charitable, religious, social, and educational
organizations. It is an accreditation organization that grants or withholds member-
ship based upon its review of ﬁnancial practices and accomplishments of organiza-
tions that apply. (See www.ecfa.org. ECFA is the United States member of the
International Committee for Fundraising Organizations (‘ICFO’).)
Paragraph 2 (a): How does the United States control the establishment in its territory of
para-military groups that have the potential to engage in terrorist activities?
The FBI and other law enforcement agencies throughout the United States conduct
ongoing investigations regarding activities of paramilitary groups that may perpetrate
or support terrorist acts. Extensive liaison eﬀorts at all levels try to ensure that the
United States has current and thorough information regarding such groups and their
activities. In addition, the FBI has established Joint Terrorism Task Forces in 51 of its
56 ﬁeld oﬃces. Working in coordination with law enforcement communities, the FBI
uses a broad range of investigative techniques including human and technical sources,
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
149
 

aggressive undercover operations, analysis of telephone and ﬁnancial records, mail
covers and physical surveillance. All of these investigative eﬀorts are employed once
there is reason to believe that an individual or organization may intend to engage in
terrorist activity.
Weapons: What measures does the United States have to prevent terrorists [from] obtain-
ing weapons in its territory, in particular small arms or light weapons? What is the United
States legislation concerning the acquisition and possession of such weapons?
Under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44, it is with some
exceptions unlawful for non-immigrant aliens to receive or possess ﬁrearms in the
United States. 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(5). However, the statute provides a number of excep-
tions to this prohibition, including persons admitted under non-immigrant visas who
obtain a hunting license or permit issued by any State. 18 U.S.C. 922(y)(2). It is also,
with exceptions, unlawful for any person to transfer a ﬁrearm to a person whom they
know or have reasonable cause to believe has been admitted to the United States on a
non-immigrant visa or who is an illegal alien. 18 U.S.C. 922(d)(5). Further, non-
immigrant aliens must establish residency in a State for at least 90 days before they may
lawfully acquire a ﬁrearm from a Federal ﬁrearms licensee. 18 U.S.C. 922(a)(3),
922(a)(5), 922(b)(3). Moreover, attempted acquisitions of ﬁrearms from federal ﬁre-
arms licensees by any unlicensed purchaser, including aliens, is subject to a criminal
history background check and a check of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
database on immigration status. A check of these databases is designed to preclude
non-immigrant and illegal aliens, as well as other ‘prohibited persons’ (e.g. felons),
from acquiring ﬁrearms from licensees. In addition to the criminal prohibitions on the
acquisition, transfer and exportation of certain weapons that appear in the U.S. Code
(Chapter 44—Firearms), 18 U.S.C. 921, et seq., there are more speciﬁc provisions
against providing material support and resources to terrorists and designated foreign
terrorist organizations. Particularly, 18 U.S.C. 2339A and 2339B (as described in previ-
ous submissions and in response to the supplemental query regarding paragraph 1(b))
make it a crime to provide or to attempt or conspire to provide, material support or
resources, intending the material support or resources to be used in the commission of
a wide variety of speciﬁed terrorist related crimes (2339A) or to go to a designated
foreign terrorist organization (2339B). Material support or resources is very broadly
deﬁned and speciﬁcally includes not only funds and monetary instruments, but also
includes ‘training, expert advice or assistance . . . weapons, lethal substances, explosives,
personnel . . . and other physical assets . . .’ Penalties for violation can include criminal
ﬁnes and incarceration for life. The foregoing applies only to the federal government.
States and local governments also have numerous laws regulating purchase and
possession of ﬁrearms.
Other measures: Does the United States have any means of detecting at the local, as
distinct from the national, level activities preparatory to a terrorist act? Are there agen-
cies and procedures at the local level for monitoring sensitive activities, such as combat
sports and shooting with light weapons, paramilitary training, the piloting of aircraft,
biological laboratories and the use of explosives for industrial purposes?

The FBI, in coordination with other law enforcement agencies, conducts local investi-
gations to detect terrorist activity. Joint terrorism task forces, that include personnel
from the FBI, other federal agencies, and local law enforcement oﬃcials, jointly
investigate suspicious activity. After September 11, 2001, most states established oﬃces
to promote homeland security. These oﬃces coordinate and streamline eﬀorts of local
and state authorities to prevent terrorist activity.
Paragraph 2(e): Are the relevant provisions of the Penal Code of the United States
applicable in all of the following circumstances? Acts committed outside the United
States by a person who is a citizen of, or habitually resident in, the United States (whether
that person is currently present in the United States or not); acts committed outside the
United States by a foreign national who is currently in the United States?
The provisions of the criminal code directed against terrorist acts are among the most
serious oﬀenses under United States law. Not only do they carry substantial penalties,
including life imprisonment or, in certain circumstances, the death penalty, but many
of them also include extraterritorial jurisdiction that make them applicable to ‘acts
committed outside the United States by a person who is a citizen of, or habitually
resident in, the United States (whether that person is currently present in the United
States or not);’ and ‘acts committed outside the United States by a foreign national
who is currently in the United States’.
(See, for example, 18 U.S.C. 32 (relating to the destruction of aircraft), 37 (relating to
violence at international airports), 351 (relating to congressional or Cabinet oﬃcer
assassination), 831 (relating to prohibited transactions involving nuclear materials),
844(f) or (i) (relating to destruction by explosives or ﬁre of government property
or property aﬀecting interstate or foreign commerce), 875 (relating to interstate
communications), 956 (relating to conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim, or injure certain
property in a foreign country), 1111 (relating to murder), 1114 (relating to murder of
United States law enforcement oﬃcials), 1116 (relating to murder of foreign oﬃcials,
oﬃcial guests, or internationally protected persons), 1201 (relating to kidnapping),
1203 (relating to hostage taking), 751 (relating to Presidential assassination), 2280
(relating to violence against maritime navigation), 2281 (relating to violence against
maritime ﬁxed platforms), 2332 (relating to terrorist acts abroad against United States
nationals), 2332a (relating to use of weapons of mass destruction), 2332b (relating to
international terrorist acts transcending national boundaries), or 2339A (relating to
providing material support to terrorists).
Paragraph 3(c): Please indicate the date on which the International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings is to be ratiﬁed. Has a program of ratiﬁcation already
been embarked on?
The Senate gave advice and consent to ratiﬁcation of the Terrorist Bombings Conven-
tion on December 5, 2001, and the instrument of ratiﬁcation is before the President for
signature. Legislation necessary to implement the Convention passed the House of
Representatives on December 20, 2001, and currently is pending in the Senate. The
United States expects to deposit its instrument of ratiﬁcation as soon as the necessary
implementing legislation is enacted.

Please provide a list of the relevant bilateral agreements to which the United States is party.
As noted in the United States’ previous report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the
United States provides assistance for criminal investigations or proceedings relating to
terrorist acts pursuant to 47 bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties and agreements
currently in force. These are with Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Australia; Austria;
Bahamas; Barbados; Belgium; Brazil; Canada; China; Czech Republic; Dominica;
Egypt; Estonia; France; Greece; Grenada; Hong Kong; Hungary; Israel; Italy; Jamaica;
Korea; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg; Mexico; Morocco; Netherlands; Panama;
Philippines; Poland; Romania; Russian Federation; St. Kitts and Nevis; St. Lucia;
St. Vincent and the Grenadines; South Africa; Spain; Switzerland; Thailand; Trinidad
and Tobago; Turkey; Ukraine; United Kingdom (Cayman Islands); United Kingdom;
Uruguay.
Paragraph 3(e): Have the crimes mentioned in the relevant international conventions been
included as extraditable oﬀences in the bilateral treaties to which the United States is
party?
Each of the UN conventions and protocols that address a particular terrorist crime
also deem that criminal oﬀense to be included in any bilateral extradition treaty exist-
ing between States Parties to the UN instrument. Thus these multilateral instruments
themselves have the legal eﬀect of incorporating the oﬀenses they address into all
U.S. bilateral extradition treaties, and corresponding amendments to each individual
bilateral extradition treaty are unnecessary.
Paragraph 4: Has the United States addressed any of the concerns expressed in paragraph
4 of the resolution?
The United States is working domestically and with other countries and international
organizations to uncover and sever ties among terrorists, transnational organized
crime, illicit drugs, moneylaundering, and illegal arms traﬃcking. The U.S. is increas-
ingly concerned about the possibility of illegal movement of nuclear, chemical, bio-
logical, and other potentially deadly materials. For example, the United States is
working with its partners in G–8, OSCE, NATO, OAS, and other international organ-
izations to advance the ﬁght against terrorism through law enforcement and judicial
cooperation; aviation, border, container and document security; freezing of terrorist-
linked assets; non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other areas of
concern. The U.S. is also working with organizations, such as the Financial Action
Task Force, to help them expand their traditional role in helping to prevent money
laundering, including terrorist ﬁnancing. In addition, the United States has begun to
work with several countries on antiterrorist ﬁnancing technical assistance needs
assessments and on follow-on implementation programs. The United States is
incorporating a more robust anti-terrorism component into its international law
enforcement training curricula. The U.S. now includes a counter-terrorism segment in
the core courses of its International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs). It is also
in the process of creating a specialized anti-terrorism course to be taught in the
ILEAs. Moreover, the U.S. has begun oﬀering a seminar in Washington on drafting
anti-terrorism legislation for countries that need such assistance. The U.S.

Government is working with other countries bilaterally, regionally and in other multi-
lateral fora to address issues related to international crime and terrorism. For example,
the U.S. is assisting the Afghan Interim Authority to combat the production and traf-
ﬁcking of illicit drugs, with an emphasis on alternative development for poppy farmers.
The U.S. is working with the UN Oﬃce for Drug Control and Crime Prevention on an
appropriate role for its Terrorism Prevention Branch to play in facilitating legal assist-
ance and advice to states seeking to ratify and implement the 12 UN counter-terrorism
conventions. Finally, the U.S. Government is working with the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) on a comprehensive plan to address the threat of nuclear and
radiological terrorism, and to help member states protect and secure sensitive material
and facilities. The U.S. is also working with other countries to enhance the ability of
multilateral export control regimes to prevent terrorist groups and their supporters
from acquiring weapons of mass destruction (WMD) materials and technology.

Reply to the Counter-Terrorism Committee, 1 April 2004 Security
Council Resolution 1373 (2001) Implementation measures
1.1 Ratiﬁcation of international conventions: Sub-paragraph 3 d) of the Resolution calls
upon States to become parties as soon as possible to the relevant international conven-
tions and protocols relating to terrorism. In that regard, the CTC would be grateful for
a further progress report on the enactment and implementation in US law of the two
international instruments mentioned in the second report and recently ratiﬁed:
•
The UN Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Financing;
•
The UN Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings;
On June 25, 2002, President Bush signed into law legislation (Public Law 107–197) that
implemented two United Nations conventions relating to terrorism. Title I of Public
Law 107–197, the ‘Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation Act of 2002,’
created a new Section 2332f in Title 18, United States Code (Bombings of places of
public use, government facilities, public transportation systems and infrastructure
facilities). Title II of Public Law 107–197, the ‘Suppression of the Financing of Terror-
ism Convention Implementation Act of 2002,’ created a new Section 2339C in Title 18,
United States Code (Prohibitions against the ﬁnancing of terrorism). The United
States deposited its instruments of ratiﬁcation for both of these conventions on
June 25, 2002, and both conventions entered into force for the United States on
July 26, 2002. Both statutes supplement existing federal and state law and do not
supplant any other law.
Eﬀectiveness in the protection of the ﬁnancial system
1.2 In the context of the implementation of Sub-paragraph 1 d) which prohibits the
making of funds available to terrorists, the CTC is aware that the United States may have
recently been evaluated by organizations involved in the protection of ﬁnancial systems
against abuse by criminals and, in particular, against abuse by people or entities intent on
directing funds towards the ﬁnancing of terrorism.
The CTC would appreciate receiving a copy of any evaluation or reports produced by
these organizations.
No recent outside evaluations of the U.S. anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist
ﬁnancing (AML/CFT) system have been conducted.
1.3 In this regard, what measures have been taken by the United States to implement the
recommendations expressed by the FATF after the second mutual evaluation during
FATF-VIII (1996–1997)?
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

It is important to note that the second FATF mutual evaluation was based on a set of
Recommendations that have been subsequently updated. In June 2003, the FATF
endorsed a revised set of Forty Recommendations Against Money Laundering. In
addition, FATF developed the Eight Special Recommendations Against Terrorist
Financing in October 2001, elements of which overlap with UNSCR 1373 and have
been addressed in previous submissions to the CTC. That said, the United States has
made signiﬁcant progress in addressing weaknesses identiﬁed in the 1996–1997 Mutual
Evaluation. In fact, in many areas, measures taken to date exceed compliance with the
standards contained in the Revised 40 Recommendations. In response to this question,
areas of concern that will be addressed include the suﬃciency of AML requirements
for particular non-bank ﬁnancial institutions, suspicious transaction reporting and
‘know your customer’ rules. The 2001 USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107–56—the
‘Act’) contains a mandate for Treasury to expand its AML regime to all ﬁnancial
institutions as deﬁned by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The BSA deﬁnes ﬁnancial
institutions broadly to include such businesses as depository institutions; securities
brokers; futures brokers; mutual funds; insurance companies; investment companies;
travel agents; dealers in precious stones, metals and jewels; and vehicle sellers. In
particular, section 352 of the Act requires all ﬁnancial institutions to have an AML
program. Under the statute, the AML program must include: (1) the development of
internal policies and procedures; (2) the designation of a compliance oﬃcer; (3) an
employee training program; and (4) an independent testing function to verify that the
program is operating as required.
INSURANCE SECTOR
The U.S. Treasury Department issued a proposed regulation on September 26, 2002, to
extend AML controls to certain insurance companies (namely, companies that deal in
life insurance and annuities). (See, ‘Anti-Money Laundering Requirements for Insur-
ance Companies,’ http://www.ﬁncen.gov/352 insurance.pdf). The proposed rule will
require certain insurance companies to assess the money laundering and terrorist ﬁnan-
cing risks posed by its products, distribution channels, and customer base. The proposed
rule also requires insurance companies to incorporate policies, procedures, and internal
controls integrating its agents and brokers into its AML program. The rule sets forth the
minimum requirements of an insurance company’s AML program. For example, it
requires that an insurance company designate a compliance oﬃcer to be responsible for
the administration of the AML program, and provides for education and training of
appropriate persons. In addition, the rule requires that an insurance company provide
for independent testing of its program on a periodic basis to ensure that it complies with
the requirements of the rule and that the program functions as designated. On October
17, 2002, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a proposed rule that would require insur-
ance companies to ﬁle suspicious activity reports and stipulates that insurance com-
panies shall maintain a copy of any suspicious transaction report ﬁled, and the original
or business record equivalent of any supporting documentation for a period of ﬁve years
from the date of ﬁling. (See, ‘Requirement that Insurance Companies Report Suspicious
Transactions,’ http://www.ﬁncen.gov/insurance_sar.pdf). The proposed rule mirrors
existing suspicious activity reporting rules for other ﬁnancial institutions, and is
designed to encourage the reporting of transactions that appear relevant to violations of
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
155
 

law or regulation. Thus, if a transaction is unusual, complex or lacking any apparently
legal purpose, the transaction should be reported. Records would be kept for a variety of
transactions, beyond simply ‘large transactions.’ In addition, the proposed rule discussed
above requiring an anti-money laundering program would require all aﬀected insurance
companies to focus on transactions that are worthy of further scrutiny and keep. An
insurance company would be required to make all supporting documentation available
to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),
any other appropriate law enforcement agencies, or state regulators upon request.
BUREAUX DE CHANGE AND MONEY TRANSMITTERS
The U.S. Treasury Department issued on March 14, 2000, a ﬁnal rule requiring that all
money transmitters to ﬁle suspicious activity reports relevant to violations of law or
regulations, and encourages this even in cases falling below the threshold in the rule.
(See, ‘Requirement that Money Transmitters and Money Order and Traveller’s
Check Issuers, Sellers, and Redeemers Report Suspicious Transactions,’ http://www.
ﬁncen.gov/msbreg.pdf). An identical rule for bureaux de change was also issued in ﬁnal
form on February 10, 2003. (‘Requirement that Currency Dealers and Exchangers
Report Suspicious Transactions,’ http://www.ﬁncen.gov/sar_currency_exch021003.pdf).
Bureaux de change must be in full compliance with the rule by August 13, 2003. The
United States has issued extensive guidelines to money service businesses (MSBs),
including bureaux de change and money remyitters. This guidance includes the
following:
•

STOCKBROKERS
The U.S. Treasury Department issued a ﬁnal rule on July 1, 2002, requiring securities
brokers to ﬁle suspicious transaction reports with the U.S. government. (See,
‘Requirement that Brokers or Dealers in Securities Report Suspicious Transactions,’
http://www.ﬁncen.gov/brokerdealersarjuly2002.pdf).

Measures to Guard Against Criminals Gaining Control of Insurance Companies,
Bureaux de Change and Money Transmitters:
It is a crime in the United States for the oﬃcers of an insurance company to be
convicted felons, unless the government has explicitly granted a waiver in a particular
case. Additionally, money service businesses are required to be registered with FinCEN
(See, 31 U.S.C. 5330, http://www4.law.cornell. edu/uscode/31/5330.html and http://
www.ﬁncen.gov/msbreg1.pdf) and as of April 29, 2002 to have anti-money laundering
compliance programs. (See, ‘Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Programs for
Money Services Businesses,’ http://www.ﬁncen.gov/352msb.pdf). FinCEN has also
been engaged in a multi-year education program to disseminate information to MSBs
regarding registration and SAR requirements. FinCEN places a high priority on eﬀect-
ive and broad-reaching initiatives to facilitate the education of MSBs and their agents
in their responsibilities under the Bank Secrecy Act. Therefore in July 2003 FinCEN
proposed a survey intended to evaluate the success of the MSB education program
(http://www.ﬁncen.gov/msbﬁnsurveyfedreg072203.pdf). The U.S. Government regards
these measures as adequate to address the associated risks. An MSB Registration
List has also now been published including all entities that have registered as MSBs,
from December 2001 through January 9, 2004, pursuant to FinCEN’s Bank Secrecy
Act (BSA) rules at 31 CFR 103.41 (http://www.msb.gov/pdf/msbregistration_
introletter.pdf).
CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
In May 2003, the U.S. Treasury Department published several Final Rules requiring
new customer identiﬁcation programs for a variety of types of ﬁnancial institutions
and non-bank ﬁnancial institutions, several of which go beyond the Revised 40
Recommendations:

Eﬀectiveness of counter-terrorism machinery
1.4 Anti-terrorist strategy: Sub-paragraph 2 b) of the resolution requires States to take
steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts. In this regard, please outline any special
anti-terrorist policies which the United States has developed aimed at preventing the
commission of terrorist acts in the following areas:
•
Links between terrorism and other criminal activities;
•
Physical protection of potential terrorist targets;
•
Strategic analysis and forecasting of emerging threats: In October of 2001, the
United States passed the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the USA
PATRIOT Act), which seeks to provide tools to assist law enforcement and other
agencies in combating terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act does this in three pri-
mary ways: First, it closes gaps in the United States Government’s ability to
investigate terrorists. Second, the USA PATRIOT Act updates United States anti-
terrorism laws to meet the challenges presented by new technologies and new
threats. Third, the USA PATRIOT Act allows for expanded information sharing
among government agencies for purposes of terrorism-related investigations;
•
Criminal investigation and prosecution: The USA PATRIOT Act enhances the
ability of investigators to ﬁght terror. For instance, the Act allows federal agents
to conduct anti-terrorism investigations without immediately notifying the subject
of a search that the search has been conducted. If criminals learn too early of an
investigation, they might ﬂee, destroy evidence, intimidate or kill witnesses, cut oﬀ
contact with associates, or take other action to evade detection or arrest. Federal
courts in narrow circumstances have long allowed law enforcement agencies to
delay, for a limited time, informing the subject that a court-approved search war-
rant has been executed. Although delayed notiﬁcation search warrants have been
upheld by courts as fully consistent with the protections of the Constitution, not all
courts have been willing to issue them. This lack of uniform acceptance is corrected
by the USA PATRIOT Act. Of course, notice of searches is ultimately provided,
but the reasonable delay gives law enforcement agencies time to identify the sus-
pect’s associates, eliminate immediate threats to our communities, and coordinate
the arrests of multiple individuals without tipping them oﬀ prematurely. Another
tool the USA PATRIOT Act provides is court-approved access to business records
to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.
For example, investigators may need to look at records from chemical plants or
hardware stores to discover who bought materials that could be used to construct a
bomb, or law enforcement may need bank records to follow the trail of money
being sent to terrorist organizers abroad. For many years, prosecutors have been
able to obtain the business records in criminal cases by using grand jury subpoenas.
However, before the USA PATRIOT Act, agents had limited tools to obtain such
records in national security terrorism investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act
recognized that the same type of records should be available in national security
investigations as well as in criminal investigations, while providing special con-
sideration for activities protected by the First Amendment.
•
Links between terrorism and other criminal activities: The USA PATRIOT Act
aimed to address terrorism through the investigation and prosecution of other
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
159
 

criminal activities that are linked to or facilitate terrorist acts. One of the most
notable crimes linked to terrorism is money laundering, since revenues from illegal
acts have been used to ﬁnance terrorism in the past. Title III of the USA PATRIOT
Act, which is also know as the International Money Laundering Abatement and
Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, provides the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation (FBI) with the necessary tools to fully investigate money laundering cases
that have a terrorism nexus. In addition, the FBI has been restructured to better
address terrorist ﬁnancing matters. During the early stages of the 9/11 investiga-
tion, the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ) identiﬁed a critical need for a
more comprehensive, centralized approach to terrorist ﬁnancial matters. In
response, the FBI established an inter-agency Terrorism Financial Review Group
(TFRG), operating out of FBI Headquarters. The TFRG brought together vast
ﬁnancial, intelligence and other databases and made them available to the investi-
gatory experts in numerous federal agencies. The TFRG was expanded and then
renamed the Terrorist Financing Operations Section (TFOS). It is part of the
FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, and focuses a powerful array of resources on the
ﬁnancial dealings and interests of terrorist organizations.

Physical Protection of Potential Terrorist Targets: While the United States and our
allies continue to direct actions against terrorists and their infrastructures abroad,
we are simultaneously strengthening the security of the homeland. Since Septem-
ber 11, 2001, the President has signed numerous critical pieces of legislation into
law to improve homeland security, most notably the Homeland Security Act of
2002 (Public Law 107–296). The Act established a cabinet-level Department of
Homeland Security dedicated to preventing, mitigating, and responding to terrorist
attacks on the United States. The President also has developed a robust policy
framework to address terrorism in the United States. The cornerstone of this policy
framework is The National Strategy for Homeland Security, which served to mobil-
ize and organize the eﬀorts of federal, state, local, and private organizations
around the national goal of protecting the homeland, including the protection of
critical infrastructure and key assets. The major critical infrastructure protection
initiatives called for by the Strategy were the uniﬁcation of protection eﬀorts within
the Department of Homeland Security, building and maintaining assessments of
all critical infrastructure and key assets, developing eﬀective partnerships at all
levels of government and the private sector, developing a national plan for infra-
structure protection, harnessing the best analytic and modeling tools for protective
eﬀorts, guarding critical infrastructure and key assets against ‘inside’ threats, and
partnering with the international community. The National Strategy for the
Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets reﬁned the national
approach to protecting critical infrastructure and key assets from physical attack.
The policy adheres to the following strategic objectives: 1) identify and assure the
protection of those infrastructures and assets that are most critical in terms of
national-level public health and safety, governance, economic and national secur-
ity, and public conﬁdence consequences; 2) provide timely warnings and assure the
protection of infrastructures and assets that face a speciﬁc threat; and 3) foster a
collaborative environment in which all levels of government and the private sector
can eﬀectively protect the infrastructure and assets they control, according to their
speciﬁc responsibilities, competencies, and capabilities. The strategy complements

The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, which focuses on the identiﬁcation,
assessment, and protection, of interconnected information systems and networks.
Finally, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 7 established a national
policy for federal departments and agencies to identify and prioritize critical infra-
structure and key resources and to protect them from terrorist attacks. Protective
actions include a wide range of activities designed to reduce the vulnerability of
critical infrastructures in order to deter, mitigate, or neutralize terrorist attacks.
HSPD-7 assigns to the Department of Homeland Security the responsibility for
leading, integrating, and coordinating the implementation of protective eﬀorts
among federal departments and agencies, state and local governments, and the
private sector. It also tasks federal departments and agencies with protection
activities in designated critical infrastructure sectors. All of these eﬀorts will be
accomplished in cooperation with state and local governments and the private
sector. HSPD-7 includes an emphasis on the protection of terrorist targets, attacks
on which might result in catastrophic health eﬀects and mass casualties.

Strategic Analysis and Forecasting of Emerging Threats: Intelligence Analysts
assigned to the Department of Homeland Security Oﬃce of Information Analysis
(IA) within the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Direct-
orate monitor all source intelligence reporting on a daily basis. IA analysts monitor
three diﬀerent aspects of threat reporting. Terrorist network analysts research ter-
rorist plans, threat streams, organizations, activities, member cells, and forms of
support. Terrorist capabilities analysts monitor terrorist capabilities and develop
hypotheses and research on potential capabilities. They produce assessments on
attempts to develop or acquire nuclear, radiological, chemical, and biological
materials for use in attacks. Critical infrastructure analysts assess the viability of
terrorist threats, plans and intentions against key sectors and assets, and monitor
terrorist plans and activities against infrastructure worldwide. As a member of the
U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and in conjunction with other members of the
IC, DHS/IA analysts monitor a series of strategic ‘threat themes’ that address
prominent threats to the homeland. Each of these themes is routinely monitored
and updated in three areas: threat, vulnerabilities to threat, and actions taken to
address the vulnerabilities. The threat is characterized by the known tactics the
terrorists have used, the assessed capabilities of the terrorist to carry out the attack,
the reported targets, and information gaps in intelligence reporting. The risk
associated with each threat theme is assessed based on the intent and capabilities of
the terrorist, the vulnerabilities of the target(s), and the consequences of an attack.
When a speciﬁc threat or threat stream is identiﬁed through the daily monitoring
process, an assessment of the threat is evaluated from several diﬀerent perspectives.
The credibility of the reporting source is assessed. The intent and capabilities of the
terrorist to carry out the reported threat are analyzed. In the case of nuclear radio-
logical threats, the assessment includes the operational practicality of carrying out
the attack, the technical feasibility of the attack, and the behavioral resolve of the
terrorist(s). Based on the assessment, additional actions may be taken to develop
an advisory or information bulletin to distribute to other federal, and state, and
local agencies, and private industry.

1.5 Has the United States encountered any diﬃculties as regards law enforcement and/or
the gathering of intelligence in relation to the areas mentioned above? If so, please
provide a brief description of what the diﬃculties were. The CTC would also ﬁnd it
helpful to receive information on recent successful operations in the areas above. In
supplying such examples, States are not expected to supply information in respect of
ongoing investigations or judicial processes if to do so would prejudice the proper conduct
of an investigation or judicial process.
United States intelligence and law enforcement communities, and our partners, both
here and abroad, have identiﬁed and disrupted over 150 terrorist threats and cells.
Worldwide, more than 3,000 terrorist operatives have been incapacitated. Four terrorist
cells in Buﬀalo, Detroit, Seattle, and Portland (Oregon), have been broken up; 300
individuals have been criminally charged in the United States in terrorism investigations;
163 individuals have been convicted or have pled guilty in the United States, including
shoe-bomber Richard Reid and ‘American Taliban’ John Walker Lindh.
1.6 Improved coordination at home: The CTC is encouraged to note that the United
States is engaged in an eﬀort to improve its ability to combat terrorism and has set up
since 2001 a reorganization plan of its departments and agencies dealing with this issue.
The CTC would be grateful to receive an outline of the results of this new organization.
In particular, has the United States created appropriate mechanisms to ensure adequate
co-operation and information sharing among the diﬀerent government agencies which
may be involved in investigating the Financing of Terrorism?
A detailed reorganization plan (pursuant to section 1502 of the Department of
Homeland Security Act of 2002) was unveiled on November 25, 2002. The complete
plan can be found on the worldwide web at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/
2002/11/reorganization_plan.pdf. Also, see the information on the creation of TFOS
within the FBI as described under section 1.4, above.
Although based on broader considerations than terrorist ﬁnancing, the provisions of
the USA PATRIOT Act which address improved sharing of information between law
enforcement and intelligence components and agencies serve to facilitate the improved
integration of information relating to all aspects of terrorist activity.
Additionally, in early 2003, a Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) was cre-
ated pursuant to the direction of the President. TTIC institutionalizes the sharing of
threat-related information across federal agency lines, thereby enabling full integration
of terrorist threat information and analysis. Finally, the Attorney General’s Global
Justice Information Sharing Initiative Advisory Committee, in collaboration with law
enforcement executives and intelligence experts at the federal, state, and local levels,
developed the National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan to facilitate information
sharing among diﬀerent government agencies. The Plan outlines model policies, stand-
ards, and guidelines for developing a law enforcement intelligence function at the local
level, includes in-depth discussions and recommendations on key implementation
issues and barriers, and emphasizes better methods for developing and sharing critical
data. The Plan will improve the ability of the United States to respond to criminal
activity and terrorism, including the ﬁnancing of terrorism. Further information may
be obtained at http://it.ojp.gov/index.jsp.

1.7 Criminal proceedings: Sub-paragraph 2 e) requires States to ensure that terrorists
and their supporters are brought to justice. Are there any special counter-terrorist
measures applicable in criminal proceedings? Does the United States train its
administrative, investigative, prosecutorial and judicial authorities to enforce its laws in
relation to:
•
Typologies and trends in terrorist ﬁnancing methods and techniques?
•
Techniques for tracing criminal properties and funds with a view to seizing and
conﬁscating them?
Special counterterrorist measures:
The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) is responsible for the security of U.S. federal court
proceedings. Since 9/11, the USMS has provided security for several terrorist-related
proceedings. The USMS relies on three internal units to provide extra security, to
counter surveillance, and to detect and respond to a chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear or high-yield explosive situation within a courthouse. The USMS increased its
ability to respond to incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or
high-yield explosives in courthouses by expanding its Hazardous Response Unit
(HRU) from 2 to 14. HRU is a group of highly trained, self-sustainable deputies
capable of responding anywhere in the U.S. or its territories. All HRU members are
certiﬁed to operate in hazardous environments and each member is certiﬁed as an
Emergency Medical Technician or paramedic. HRU possesses highly technical
equipment capable of collecting, testing and mitigating chemical and biological
agents. It is capable of providing environmental screening, monitoring, rescue and
decontamination during these trials. HRU members are certiﬁed to conduct WMD
vulnerability assessments for courthouses holding terrorist or terrorist-related
proceedings.
The Special Operations Group (SOG) is a team of highly trained and mobile tactical
response personnel. One of its missions is to provide tactical support to judicial districts
holding terrorist or terrorist-related proceedings. It provides prisoner escort, personal
protection for court personnel and witnesses, and assists with physical security of the
courthouse.
The Technical Operations Group (TOG), as one of its missions, provides technical
support and counter-surveillance equipment for courthouses housing terrorist or
terrorist related proceedings.
Turning to pertinent eﬀorts of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
(ATF), one of its strategic goals is to reduce the rising trend in the illegal diversion of
alcohol and tobacco products and thereby decrease the resulting proﬁts that are used
to further criminal and terrorist schemes. In connection with the President’s Executive
Order on Terrorist Financing, ATF has been investigating individuals and businesses
involved in the traﬃcking of illicit cigarettes to determine any possible ties or associ-
ations with named terrorist groups or their supporters was occurring. Since the events
of September 11, 2001, ATF has investigated suspects in 223 cigarette diversion cases
to determine whether there is evidence of material support to terrorist organizations.
These schemes can generate tremendous cash proﬁts. For example, a truckload of
cigarettes will yield more than $1.2 million in proﬁt if federal and state taxes have been
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
163
 

avoided. U.S. and state cigarette tax losses are estimated by some at $1.4 billion. The
terrorist aspect of revenue loss attributed to illicit tobacco traﬃcking cannot be esti-
mated. Prior to the events of September 11, 2001, the World Bank estimated that
governments around the world would lose approximately $24 to $30 billion annually in
uncollected tax revenue. Current indications disclose that terrorist groups are engaged
in tobacco diversion and forming alliances with tobacco traﬃckers to generate monies
used to support their organizations and activities.
Within the past 5 years, ATF has initiated approximately 500 tobacco traﬃcking
investigations, seized more than $8.1 million in contraband cigarettes, and forwarded
286 defendants for prosecution. In one case, concluded in December 2003, Hassan
Makki was sentenced to 57 months’ imprisonment and ﬁned over $600,000 and Elias
Mohamad Akhdar of Dearborn, Michigan, was sentenced to 70 months in prison,
both for providing material support to the designated foreign terrorist organization,
Hizballah, and for conspiring to violate the Racketeering Inﬂuenced and Corrupt
Organization Act (RICO) as a result on involvement in the smuggling of contraband
cigarettes. In another case, concluded in March 2002, Haissam Nashar, of Charlotte,
North Carolina, pled guilty in federal court to transporting counterfeit cigarette tax
stamps and testiﬁed against Mohamad Hammoud in his use of illicit cigarette traﬃck-
ing to support the terrorist group Hizballah. Approximately $1.5 million in assets was
seized in this investigation.
ATF’s presence in the contraband cigarette traﬃcking arena is fundamental to dis-
rupting and eliminating criminal and terrorist organizations by identifying, investigating
and arresting oﬀenders who traﬃc in contraband cigarettes, and identifying for seizure
and forfeiture assets used and proceeds of these crimes.
Training:
The Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section (AFMLS) of the Criminal
Division of the Department of Justice conducts approximately 24 seminars per year
covering asset forfeiture, money laundering (including lectures on trends and tech-
niques in money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing), and ﬁnancial investigations. Parti-
cipants in these seminars include prosecutors, law enforcement agents and support
staﬀ. AFMLS attorneys are recognized as domestic and international experts in the
ﬁeld of money laundering, asset forfeiture and terrorist ﬁnancing. This area of the law
is technical and constantly changing, and the advice and training AFMLS oﬀers are in
high demand. AFMLS provides invaluable assistance to federal prosecutors and law
enforcement agents, as well as foreign law enforcement oﬃcials, in the areas of ﬁnan-
cial investigations, and money laundering and asset forfeiture laws. In addition to the
seminars sponsored by AFMLS, section attorneys routinely participate as speakers in
other agencies and countries’ conferences on terrorist ﬁnancing, money laundering and
asset forfeiture.
Examples of such training include:
Law Enforcement Training: In FY 2002 AFMLS conducted 12 seminars and trained
over 1,185 federal prosecutors, federal agents, foreign oﬃcials, and state and local
agents on forfeiture and money laundering law and ﬁnancial investigations. In FY
2003, it conducted 11 seminars, reaching approximately 1,286 individuals.

Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Training: AFMLS, in
partnership with the Executive Oﬃce for OCDETF, is currently undertaking a major
ﬁnancial investigations training initiative and will conduct 24 ﬁnancial investigations
conferences around the country in 2004 and 2005, training approximately 2,000 federal
law enforcement agents and prosecutors.
International Training and Forfeiture Sharing: AFMLS has developed signiﬁcant inter-
national contacts by conducting annual regional international conferences to foster
joint asset forfeiture and money laundering investigations. The most recent conference
was conducted in South Africa in February 2004, and focused on money laundering
and asset forfeiture related to political corruption cases. In the Fall of 2002, AFMLS
held a conference in London which focused on terrorist ﬁnancing and included repre-
sentatives from European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. Previous conferences
have been held in Hong Kong, Thailand, Costa Rica, and Argentina.
Development of Computer-Based Training: AFMLS is also developing computerbased
training in asset forfeiture, money laundering and ﬁnancial investigations for law
enforcement agents and prosecutors.
Publications: In 2002, as part of a corroborative eﬀort among the Counterterrorism
Section, AFMLS and the United States Attorney’s Oﬃce for the District of the Virgin
Islands, a book entitled Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing was prepared for
use by prosecutors and law enforcement. Additionally, AFMLS publishes the Asset
Forfeiture Quick Release (monthly), the Asset Forfeiture News (bi-monthly), and the
Money Laundering Monitor (semi-annually), as well as compendia of asset forfeiture
and money laundering cases, which give the law enforcement community the best and
most timely information and advice in money laundering and asset forfeiture law and
practice. The ever-growing demand for these resources makes clear that AFMLS will
continue these endeavors.
Additionally, the Oﬃce of Justice Program’s Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA),
Department of Justice, through the State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training (SLATT)
Program, provides specialized training for law enforcement personnel in combating
terrorism and extremist criminal activity. SLATT, a joint eﬀort with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, focuses on the prevention of terrorism in the United States by provid-
ing the tools necessary for state and local law enforcement oﬃcers to understand, detect,
deter, and investigate acts of terrorism in the United States by both international and
domestic terrorists.
Training is oﬀered in the following areas:
•
Investigative/Intelligence Workshops. Designed for state and local law enforcement
investigators, intelligence oﬃcers, and analytical personnel, this workshop includes
topics related to the unique peculiarities inherent in the investigation and prosecu-
tion of terrorist and criminal extremist activity.
•
Narcotics Task Force Anti-Terrorism Brieﬁngs. Designed for multi-jurisdictional
narcotics task force personnel, this brieﬁng combines terrorism awareness and
investigative training with the expertise, experience, and contacts of narcotics task
force groups to aid in the investigation, interdiction, and prevention of terrorist
and extremist-related crimes.
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E

•
Train-the-Trainer Workshops. Designed for qualiﬁed law enforcement trainers,
this workshop is intended to assist agencies in developing in-house anti-terrorism
training capabilities and provides law enforcement trainers with the ability and
information (i.e., lesson plans, sample notebooks, presentation materials, reference
materials, etc.) to train other law enforcement personnel.
To date, 40,000 law enforcement personnel have been trained.
Eﬀectiveness of customs, immigration and border controls
1.8 Sub-paragraph 2(g) requires States to have in place eﬀective border controls in order
to prevent the movement of terrorists and terrorist groups. In this regard:
(a) Would the United States please outline how it implements the common standards
set by the World Customs Organization in relation to electronic reporting and the
promotion of supply chain security?
The United States through Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) is an active participant in World Customs Organization
(WCO) activities related to Supply Chain Security. WCO Supply Chain Security consists
of several WCO initiatives: Advance Cargo Information (ACI) Guidelines, the WCO
Customs Data Model, and the WCO Unique Consignment Reference (UCR) Guide-
lines. CBP delegates to the WCO have ensured that United States requirements (24 hour
rule) are congruent with the ACI guidelines. In addition, data requirements for CBP’s
Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) and the International Trade Data System
(ITDS) will be included version 2.0 of the WCO Data Model in June 2005. At this
time, CBP and traders will be able to use WCO data and EDIFACT messages for the
receipt and transmission of the international harmonized data set.
CBP has been involved with automation of the cargo processing procedures since
the early 1980’s. Since then it has progressed to a state where over 99% of all cargo
entries (goods declarations) are received electronically, over 90% of all inward vessel
and rail manifests are electronic, and approximately 50% of air manifests as well. CBP
has also negotiated arrangements with the largest air courier companies to make use of
their internal computer systems to track and target many of the smaller shipments that
are not currently tracked in CBP’s Automated Commercial System.
CBP has incorporated the interchange of data on transportation and on goods within
its systems to keep carriers well informed on the release status of importers’ goods and
has also allowed carriers to submit information on transit merchandise as well.
Under the 24-Hour Cargo Declaration Rule, CBP has not only begun to receive
shipment data earlier in the transportation movement, but has also allowed more trade
parties to automate with CBP and has increased the level of electronic communication
among trade parties through CBP’s systems.
New legislation and regulation will soon mandate the submission of all manifest
information electronically. CBP is making the changes necessary to not only receive
data from carriers and couriers electronically, but also improve the level of communi-
cation between the government and the trade parties involved in each transaction.
This increased level of automation of data will be combined with new accomplish-
ments in electronic sealing and tracking of containers and vehicles. The data will be
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
166
 
www.ebook3000.com

shared with other U.S. government agencies, such as the Coast Guard, to aid in the
targeting and tracking of vessels and other conveyances as well. CBP utilizes a sophis-
ticated ‘layered defense’ strategy in protecting our borders against the threat of terrorism
and in promoting global supply chain security.
On November 27, 2001, U.S. Customs Service Commissioner Robert C. Bonner
introduced the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program at
the Customs Trade Symposium in Washington, D.C. Mr. Bonner challenged Customs
and the trade community to design a new approach to supply chain security that would
strengthen our borders while continuing to facilitate the legitimate ﬂow of persons,
cargo and conveyances. Since that time, the C-TPAT program has been implemented
and over 5,500 members of the international trade community have become members.
Under the C-TPAT initiative, Customs is working with importers, carriers, brokers,
and other industry sectors to develop a seamless security-conscious environment
throughout the entire commercial process. By providing a forum in which the business
community and Customs can exchange anti-terrorism ideas, concepts and information
both the government and business community will increase the security of the entire
commercial process from manufacturing through transportation and importation to
ultimate distribution. This program underscores the importance of employing best
business practices and enhanced security measures to eliminate the trade’s vulnerability
to terrorist actions.
C-TPAT is a cooperative endeavor. The program calls upon the trade community
to establish procedures to enhance their existing security practices and those of their
business partners involved in the supply chain. Once these procedures are in eﬀect,
imports of C-TPAT members may qualify for expedited Customs processing and
reduced exams at ports of entry.
In addition, there are several other CBP layers that are deployed simultaneously to
support supply chain security and substantially increase the likelihood that weapons of
mass destruction (WMD) will be detected:
•
The National Targeting Center (NTC)—A single location for targeting technology
and subject matter expertise;
•
The Automated Targeting System (ATS)—The premier tool employed by CBP per-
sonnel to identify high-risk targets in the ocean, as well as other cargo environments;
•
The 24-Hour Rule and the Trade Act of 2002—New regulations that give CBP the
authority and mechanisms needed to require advance electronic cargo information
prior to arrival or departure from the United States;
•
The Container Security Initiative (CSI)—A means of pushing our borders outward
by screening cargo overseas and working jointly with host nation customs agencies
on exams prior to lading U.S. bound cargo; and
•
Non-Intrusive Inspection Technology—Advanced inspection equipment to screen
shipments rapidly for WMD, nuclear or radiological materials, terrorist weapons,
and other contraband.
(b) Is the supervision of people and cargo in the United States undertaken by separate
agencies (immigration and customs) or is it undertaken by one and the same body? If
there is more than one agency involved, do these agencies share information and
coordinate their activities?
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E

The merger of the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Agriculture Plant & Health Inspection
Service, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the U.S. Border Patrol
in March 2002 created U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the newly
established Department of Homeland Security. As a result of the merger, for the ﬁrst
time in the history of the United States, all agencies of the United States Government
with authorities and responsibilities at our Nation’s borders have been uniﬁed into a
single federal agency. CBP is responsible for managing, controlling and securing the
border both at and between the oﬃcial ports of entry. This includes responsibility for
the movement of people and cargo arriving internationally to, and exiting internation-
ally out of, the United States. CBP also works closely with the Transportation and
Security Administration (TSA) by supporting and assisting TSA’s eﬀorts in the
supervision of people and cargo in the continental United States.
(c) How does the United States monitor its borders between ports of entry in order to
satisfy itself both that these areas are not being used to undertake terrorist activities
against its neighbours and to defend itself against possible inﬁltration by terrorists?
Does the United States have arrangements to cooperate with bordering States in
order to prevent cross-border terrorists’ acts? If so, please elaborate.
In March 2002, the U.S. Border Patrol became part of U.S. Customs and Border
Protection. CBP currently has approximately 11,000 Border Patrol agents whose pri-
mary responsibility is to monitor the borders of the United States between the oﬃcial
ports of entry to prevent the entry of terrorists or terrorist weapons into the United
States.
The Border Patrol apprehends approximately 1,000,000 people attempting to
illegally enter the United States every year. As part of CBP, the Border Patrol has
established a link to the National Targeting Center (NTC) in Reston, Virginia, which
has immediate access to databases that contain information regarding individuals
linked to terrorist activities. The Border Patrol uses the CBP National Targeting Center
as a viable resource when a person of interest is encountered while on patrol.
Over the last few years, the Border Patrol has signiﬁcantly increased its enforcement
presence along all our borders by deploying additional personnel, technology, and
infrastructure (fences and barriers) along the immediate border area. Headquarters
Border Patrol (HQBOR) is currently looking at the possibility of using Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) to help in patrolling the border.
The Border Patrol now has over 1,000 agents patrolling the northern border with
Canada and an additional 10,000 along the SW Border with Mexico. Border Patrol has
over:
•
8,000 vehicles of all types that we use to patrol the border;
•
100 plus aircraft are used to keep an eye on the sky;
•
118 Certiﬁed agents patrol on horseback;
•
294 Bike Patrol Agents are used along the border and in the city;
•
318 K-9 Units are used at the checkpoints and along the border; and
•
480 Agents on ATV’s (all terrain vehicles) are also used in rough terrain areas of
operation.

Technology:
•
Over 14,000 sensors are planted along the border (Seismic, infrared and magnetic);
•
300 RVS Cameras keep an eye on popular border crossings and areas of high
interest;
•
260 radio dispatchers work round the clock (24/7) and provide valuable communi-
cations services; and
•
120 electronic technicians help maintain the system.
Fencing:
•
Border Patrol has over 84 miles of primary and secondary fencing that extends
from San Diego, California to Arizona.
•
Does the United States have arrangements to cooperate with bordering States in
order to prevent cross-border terrorists’ acts? If so, please elaborate.
In addition to bilateral anti-terrorism initiatives with Mexico on the southern border
and Canada on the northern border, Customs and Border Protection works closely
with local and state law enforcement authorities using Memoranda of Understanding
and/or Memoranda of Agreement for the coordination of enforcement activities
including countering terrorism throughout the nation.
(d) As regards international ﬂights, does the United States use advanced passenger
manifest programs to check the list of inbound passengers against information,
contained in databases on terrorism, before they land?
CBP requires air carriers to transmit passenger and crew manifest data to CPB’s
Advance Passenger Information System (APIS). The carrier sends this data, elec-
tronically, to its data center in Newington, Virginia, where it is processed through our
law enforcement databases and run against terrorist indices, prior to the ﬂight’s arrival.
CBP uses this data as a risk management technique to identify targets and focus its
attention on speciﬁc passengers and crew, while facilitating the entry of those who pose
no risk.
(e) The CTC is encouraged to see that the United States has acceded to Annex 17 of the
Convention on International Civil Aviation. Could the United States inform the CTC
as to the agency or agencies which are responsible for Airport and Seaport security?
If this agency or these agencies are distinct from the United States’ police forces,
how is information concerning terrorist threats passed on to these organizations? Are
periodic security audits performed at airports and seaports? Is access to port facilities
controlled? If so, how? Are airport and seaport personnel screened and provided with
identity cards to prevent access by unauthorized personnel to these facilities.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS) has statutory responsibility for security of all U.S. airports. The
tools it uses include intelligence, regulation, enforcement, inspection and screening,
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
169
 

and education of carriers, passengers and shippers. DHS collects, analyzes and dis-
seminates relevant intelligence and threat information. When the information concerns
a U.S. airport, this information is passed on to TSA. Periodic inspections are per-
formed at all U.S. airports that have scheduled domestic and/or international ﬂight
service and airport identiﬁcation cards are required for all personnel with access to
non-public areas of all U. S. airports that have scheduled domestic and/or international
ﬂight service.
•
Are detection devices in place to screen passengers and cargo for weapons and
hazardous materials?
All CBP oﬃcers are equipped with personal radiation detectors. In addition, CBP
has deployed radiation portal monitors and radiation isotope identiﬁers as well as
technologies for detecting explosive materials. The CBP Canine Enforcement Program
is the ﬁrst Canine Program that has successfully deployed explosive detector dog teams
with the ability to search people along with the traditional conveyances and cargo. The
CBP Canine Enforcement Program also is the ﬁrst national canine program to test the
feasibility and practicality of deploying canines throughout the nation’s borders with
the capability of detecting chemical weapons.
•
Are hazardous materials segregated and secured in cargo movements both by air and
at sea?
Unless the hazardous material is selected for inspection, CBP is not responsible for the
actual movement and or segregation of hazardous materials in an airport or seaport
environment. In the event the material is chosen for inspection, CBP utilizes the ports’
Hazardous Materials Specialists to inspect and determine whether a material is safe.
1.9 Sub-paragraph 2 (c) of the Resolution requires States to deny safe heaven to terror-
ists and their supporters. In this regard, could the United States please provide the CTC
with an outline of the legislative provisions regarding the granting of citizenship or other
civic rights? Can a foreigner, who is granted citizenship, change his name? What precau-
tions are taken to establish the true identity of a person before new identity papers are
issued to that person?
Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, ‘[a]ll
persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.’ The
statutory provisions governing the granting of United States citizenship, a process
known as ‘naturalization,’ are found at Title 8, United States Code, sections 1421, et
seq. Until recently, the authority to grant citizenship to persons not born in the United
States was vested solely in the Attorney General. In 2003, that authority was trans-
ferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security, pursuant to the Homeland Security Act.
However, the naturalization process remains the same. Among the prerequisites
for naturalization, with certain limited exceptions, are that the applicant reside in the
United States as a permanent resident for at least ﬁve years immediately prior to apply-
ing for naturalization, continue that residency throughout the period of application,

and establish good moral character (8 U.S.C. sec. 1427). The burden of proof to dem-
onstrate lawful admission to the United States for the purpose of permanent residence
is upon the applicant for naturalization (8 U.S.C. sec. 1429). The law requires that
applicants furnish photographs (8 U.S.C. sec. 1444) in addition to the biographical
information sought in the application, which must be signed in the applicant’s own
handwriting (8 U.S.C. sec. 1445). Unless waived by the Secretary for Homeland
Security, a background investigation of the applicant is conducted by the relevant
authorities (8 U.S.C. sec. 1446). An applicant is permitted to petition a court to legally
change his or her name, and the new name will be entered on the certiﬁcate of naturali-
zation (8 U.S.C. sec. 1447). In general, subsequent name changes are handled in
accordance with requirements of state law. Any application for a new certiﬁcate of
naturalization, based upon a subsequent legal name change, must be accompanied by
photographs in accordance with the aforementioned federal statute (8 U.S.C. sec. 1444).
Controls on preventing access to weapons by terrorists
1.10 Sub-paragraph 2 (a) of the Resolution requires each Member State, inter alia, to
have in place appropriate mechanisms to deny terrorists access to weapons. In this con-
text, the legislation exposed by the United States in their two reports shows that the
violation of arms regulations can be prosecuted and punished. Nevertheless, it doesn’t
seem that any of these provisions practically deny access to weapons by individuals who
may commit terrorist acts:
•
If they are American citizens or legal aliens;
•
Or, people with no criminal background.
In these cases, how does the United States intend to meet with the requirement of
sub-paragraph 2 (a) of the Resolution?
The Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C. section 922(g) (GCA), sets forth nine categories of
persons who generally cannot legally possess ﬁrearms or ammunition in the United
States. These categories include felons, persons with misdemeanor crimes of domestic
violence (MCDV) convictions, illegal aliens, and non-immigrant aliens. While the CTC
is correct that the GCA would not prevent a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien
with no felony or MCDV convictions, or other GCA prohibitions, from possessing
ﬁrearms, the U.S. has taken numerous steps to prevent terrorists from accessing
ﬁrearms.
After September 11, 2001, the United States changed its background check system
to ensure prohibited illegal and non-immigrant aliens were not able to purchase ﬁre-
arms from federal ﬁrearms licensees (FFLs). The form individuals complete before
buying a gun from an FFL (ATF Form 4473, Firearms Transaction Record), was
amended to ask for any non-U.S. citizen’s Bureau of Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) alien or admission number. Any person who is a non-U.S. citizen is
now run through the ICE database as part of their National Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check System (NICS) check performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Moreover, all non-US citizens, including legal aliens, must show FFL documentation
demonstrating they have lived in a state for at least 90 days to be eligible to purchase
a ﬁrearm. These measures ensure that while permanent resident aliens can legally
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
171
 

obtain ﬁrearms in the U.S., they are given close scrutiny before such a purchase can
occur.
In addition, although a terrorist who did not fall within any of the prohibited
categories contained in the GCA would not be prohibited from receiving or possessing
ﬁrearms or ammunition in the United States, the United States has enacted a procedure
for reducing the chances of a terrorist obtaining such weapons. Now, as part of the
NICS check, a check is done of the Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File
database. If there is a data match, the ﬁrearm purchase is automatically delayed, giving
the government a chance to evaluate the purchaser. The purchaser’s record is carefully
scrutinized to determine whether it is at all possible that he falls within one of the
prohibited categories, allowing the purchase to be denied under the GCA. Furthermore,
after September 11, 2001, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
(ATF) imposed restrictions on non-US citizens temporarily importing ﬁrearms into
the United States. Eﬀective February 5, 2002, any non-U.S. citizen temporarily import-
ing ﬁrearms or ammunition for sporting purposes must obtain an approved ATF Form
6NIA from ATF before importing these items. Such persons previously were able to
bring ﬁrearms and ammunition into the United States without any permit. Now,
before the permit is approved, ATF reviews the speciﬁc ﬁrearms and ammunition the
person intends to bring into the United States and the identity of the person intending
to bring them in.
Finally, it should be noted that federal law in the United States generally prohibits
all persons from possessing certain ﬁrearms that are likely the most appealing to terror-
ists, including machineguns and semiautomatic assault weapons. 18 U.S.C. sec. 922(o)
and (v).
1.11 The ﬁrst explanations provided by the United States on ﬁrearms legislation seem
only applicable to the federal level, but it appears that the legislation could be very
diﬀerent at States level and eventually more ﬂexible. So, it is diﬃcult for the CTC to
evaluate what is the status of arms in the United States and what are in practice the
existing measures to eﬀectively prevent access to weapons by individuals who are intend-
ing to commit terrorist acts. The CTC would be grateful to the United States for any
explanations or precisions on that purpose.
Federal ﬁrearms restrictions apply to all covered individuals and dealers. While states
may enact additional laws, they can not be less restrictive. For example, federal law
does not restrict the number of ﬁrearms an individual may lawfully purchase. However,
some states restrict purchases to one ﬁrearm per month. In addition, under federal law
not all ﬁrearms are treated the same. The sale and possession of particularly dangerous
weapons that might be used by terrorists, such as automatic and sawn-oﬀ weapons,
ﬁrearms that have had their serial numbers altered or obliterated, and destructive
devices are restricted and subject to more stringent requirements.
1.12 In relation to its legal system on ﬁrearms, can the United States give more informa-
tion on the following items:
•
What are the conditions an individual (US national or legal alien) has to meet under
the United States’ law to entitle him to purchase ﬁrearms?
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
172
 
www.ebook3000.com

First, an individual must not fall into any of the nine prohibited categories under the
GCA discussed in the response to question 1.10. A purchase by a felon, or an
individual with an MCDV conviction, is prohibited under the GCA. Second, if the
individual is purchasing the ﬁrearm from an FFL, the individual must execute ATF
Form 4473, and successfully undergo a NICS background check by the FBI. As dis-
cussed above, this background check involves checks of immigration and terrorist
databases. Third, ATF Ruling 2004–1 requires that alien purchasers show that they
have resided in a State continuously for at least 90 days immediately prior to the FFL
conducting the NICS check. If an alien leaves the United States, the 90-day period
stops and restarts from day one when they enter the United States again. The NICS
check of the ICE database will show whether a non-immigrant alien has entered or
exited the United States in the last 90 days. If there is evidence that a non-immigrant
alien has entered or exited the country in the last 90 days, NICS will tell the FFL to
cancel the transaction
•
What type(s) of ﬁrearms may an individual possess? How many ﬁrearms of a particular
type may an individual possess? Are there any exceptions in that regard?
As discussed in the answer to 1.10, certain ﬁrearms are banned from civilian posses-
sion. Section 922(o) of the GCA provides that it is unlawful for any person to transfer
or possess a machine gun not lawfully possessed prior to May 19, 1986. Semiautomatic
assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices are also generally
banned under the GCA (See 18 U.S.C. sec. 922(v) and (w)). Certain ﬁrearms are regu-
lated under both the GCA and the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. Chapter 53
(NFA). Firearms subject to regulation under the NFA include machine guns, shotguns
having a barrel of less than 18 inches, riﬂes having a barrel of less than 16 inches,
silencers, and destructive devices such as bombs, grenades, rockets and missiles. All
NFA weapons must be registered with ATF in the National Firearms Registration and
Transfer Record unless they are in the possession or under the control of the United
States. See 26 U.S.C. sec. 5841(a). NFA weapons must be registered before they can be
lawfully possessed. Under Section 5812(b), NFA weapons cannot be transferred with-
out the approval of the Attorney General. An application must be ﬁled with ATF to
transfer an NFA weapon, and a ﬁngerprint based background check is conducted on
the transferee prior to transfer. See 26 U.S.C. sec. 5812(a). The purpose of this check
is to ensure that NFA weapons are not transferred to persons who cannot lawfully
possess them. In addition, taxes are imposed on the transfer and making of NFA
weapons under NFA sections 5811 and 5821.
There is no limit under federal law as to how many ﬁrearms an individual may pos-
sess. However, federal law does require FFLs to report the sales of multiple handguns to
one purchaser to ATF by close of business on the day of the transfer on an ATF Form
3310.4, Report of Multiple Sale or Other Disposition of Pistols and Revolvers.
•
What kind of federal measures have been taken by the United States to coordinate
the diﬀerent legislations on ﬁrearms adopted in the various States?
Under the United States Constitution, while the federal government may impose cer-
tain restrictions on the possession of certain types of ﬁrearms, the individual states
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
173
 

may also pass their own laws. Although state law can not authorize what the federal
law prohibits, it can be more restrictive. It should be noted that each individual state is
represented in both houses of the United States Congress.
ATF provides a publication for the use of FFLs and others listing all relevant state
laws entitled ATF Publication 5300.5, State Laws and Published Ordinances.
1.13 Does the United States Custom Service implement Recommendation of WCO
Concerning the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Traﬃcking in Firearms,
their Parts and Components and Ammunition, Supplementing the United Nations Con-
vention against Transnational Organized Crime (29th June 2002)? If yes, please outline
the measures applicable in the United States.
In response to how the Department of Homeland Security, ICE implements the
‘Recommendation of WCO Concerning the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing
of and Traﬃcking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition, Sup-
plementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.’
ICE has operational oversight over a broad range of investigative activities related to
the enforcement of U.S. export laws, including the illegal export of ﬁrearms and
ammunition. These laws pertain to the import and export of U.S. defense articles and
controlled commodities, and the enforcement of U.S. economic sanctions and embar-
goes, with an emphasis towards preventing international terrorists and hostile nations
from obtaining small arms and light weapon systems, ammunition, and weapons of
mass destruction components and related technology from U.S. and foreign sources.
ICE works closely with other U.S. law enforcement agencies, including ATF to
facilitate the coordination of joint ﬁrearms traﬃcking investigations; establish policy
and procedures through which ICE can exploit, for investigative purposes, the results
of ﬁrearms traces conducted by ATF; and participate in foreign ﬁrearms traﬃcking
conferences to provide international training in ﬁrearms traﬃcking investigative
techniques.
1.14 Is it necessary to lodge, register or check the Goods Declaration and supporting
documentation concerning ﬁrearms prior to their import, export or transit? In addition, is
it necessary to encourage importers, exporters or third parties to provide information to
the United States’ Customs authorities prior to the shipment of such goods?
Imports of handguns, riﬂes and shotguns require the importer to declare the weapons
and to have a permit (ATF-6 form) from ATF. The transit and export of handguns and
riﬂes requires either a Department of State license or license exemption for each ship-
ment, and the Shipper’s Export Declaration must be presented to CBP citing the
license or license exemption. Customs and Border Protection seeks informed compliance
with U.S. laws regarding ﬁrearms. Violations of the regulations may result in the
seizure of the weapons or further legal action.
With respect to importation of ﬁrearms by aliens, on February 5, 2002, ATF published
a rule requiring non-immigrant aliens bringing ﬁrearms and ammunition into the
United States for hunting or sporting purposes to obtain an import permit from ATF.
Prior to the publication of the rule, non-immigrant aliens could do so without a
permit. In the interest of national security and public safety, ATF now requires non-
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
174
 
www.ebook3000.com

immigrant aliens to obtain import permits for all importations of ﬁrearms and ammu-
nition into the United States. Non-immigrant aliens who wish to import ﬁrearms and
ammunition must submit to ATF an ATF Form 6NIA, Application and Permit for
Temporary Importation of Firearms and Ammunition by Non-immigrant Aliens. The
Form 6NIA requires alien applicants to list identifying information, including their
ICE alien or admission number.
1.15 Are there appropriate mechanisms in place to verify the authenticity of licenses and
other oﬃcial documents in relation to the import, export or transit of ﬁrearms?
The original ATF-6 form must be presented to CBP at time of import and the exporter
must present an original license and ﬁle the Shipper’s Export Declaration for the
export against that license. Additionally, CBP receives a download nightly of all
licenses issued by the Department of State.
1.16 Have the United States implemented, using risk assessment principles, appropriate
security measures concerning the import, export and transit movement of ﬁrearms? In
that context, does the United States conduct security checks on the temporary storage,
warehousing and transportation of ﬁrearms? Does the United States require persons
involved in these operations to undergo security vetting?
Persons engaged in the business of importing ﬁrearms must ﬁrst apply and be granted
a license as an importer of ﬁrearms under the GCA. Any person, including a licensed
importer, who wishes to import ﬁrearms must also obtain an approved import permit
(Form 6) from ATF as discussed above. The Form 6 requires the applicant to list their
name and address, as well as that of the broker, the foreign seller and any foreign
shipper. The Form 6 requires speciﬁc information about the ﬁrearms to be imported,
including serial number. Importers must also be registered pursuant to the Arms
Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. sec. 2778 (AECA). The export provisions of the AECA
are administered by the United States Department of State. To export ﬁrearms, per-
sons must ﬁrst obtain a valid export license from the State Department under the
AECA. Import shipments of ﬁrearms and other goods may be stored in Customs
Bonded Warehouses (CBWs) and Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs). Customs regulates
the functioning of CBWs and FTZs. Under its inspection authority granted by the
provisions of the GCA, ATF has the authority to inspect ﬁrearms shipments being
stored in CBWs.
Customs conducts security checks on carriers, and warehousing facilities for all com-
modities to ensure compliance with CBP regulations. Additionally, Customs requires
carriers and warehouse operations to carry bonds to cover any penalties or other
sanctions. Background checks are conducted on person involved in these operations.

Enclosure
Report by the Russian Federation to the Counter-Terrorism Committee
established pursuant to paragraph 6 of Security Council Resolution 1373
(2001) Introduction
The Russian Federation actively supports the eﬀorts to combat terrorism being made
by the international community, in which the United Nations and its Security Council
are playing a central coordinating role. Since it considers international terrorism to be
one of the main dangers threatening humanity, the Russian Federation favours united
eﬀorts by all States to combat this universal evil.
Moscow welcomed Security Council resolution 1373 of 28 September 2001, pursu-
ant to which the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee was established and
is successfully functioning, as a unique instrument for monitoring the fulﬁlment by all
States of their obligations to counteract international terrorism.

It is urgently necessary to reinforce the international legal basis for eﬀective counter-
terrorist cooperation among States. A top priority is to ensure the universality of all
12 global conventions on this subject. In addition, Russia hopes that agreement can be
reached as soon as possible on the draft comprehensive convention on international
terrorism and the draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear
terrorism.
The success of the war on terrorism declared by the international community
depends on the adoption of a whole series of complex decisions, including the rejection
of double standards. The war on terrorism must be waged equally strongly and
consistently in all regions of the world.
The war on terrorism must not be considered as a clash of civilizations. As a State
comprising many nationalities and faiths, Russia is convinced that it is completely
inadmissible to equate terrorism with any nationality, religion or culture.
The war on terrorism must unite all members of the international community and
become the catalyst for the creation under United Nations auspices of a global system,
based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the underlying norms of
international law, to deal with the new challenges and threats.
The ﬁnancing of terrorism is its Achilles heel. A crushing blow will be dealt to the
whole infrastructure of terrorism if the funds sustaining it can be cut oﬀ decisively.
One priority is to deprive terrorism of its social underpinning. This requires
increased eﬀorts to eliminate poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and discrimination on
racial, ethnic, religious and other grounds. Today it is more urgent than ever to ensure
the steady development of all regions of the world and to focus on the social aspects of
the globalization process.
Conﬂicts are the breeding ground of terrorism. In this connection, Russia has pro-
posed the formulation under United Nations auspices of a comprehensive strategy
for the elimination of external ﬁnancing of armed conﬂicts. We are ready to pursue
cooperation with all interested States to implement this initiative.
Eﬀorts must be made to promote active rejection of terrorism in the world. A vital
contribution to this work must be made not only by States but also by civil society,
including non-governmental organizations. Russia has made a timely proposal for the
convening under United Nations auspices of a universal forum to discuss the role of
civil society, and particularly of the mass media, in the war on terrorism.
As a champion of the cause of the eradication of terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations, the Russian Federation is fulﬁlling its obligations under Security
Council resolution 1373 (2001) and submitting its national report on the measures
taken to meet the requirements of that resolution. The report has been prepared in
accordance with the recommendations of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.
1 (a) What measures if any have been taken to prevent and suppress the ﬁnancing of
terrorist acts in addition to those listed in response to questions on 1 (b) to (d)?
In pursuance of Federal Act No. 115 of 7 August 2001 ‘On the prevention of the
legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (money-laundering)’, on 1 November
2001 the President of the Russian Federation signed Decree No. 1263 ‘On the organ
empowered to prevent the legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (money-
laundering)’, which provides for the creation of the Committee of the Russian Federation
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
177
 

for Financial Monitoring, responsible to the Russian Ministry of Finance. Work is
being done to devise an eﬀective mechanism for identifying and freezing sources of
terrorism ﬁnancing.
An interdepartmental working group on measures to prevent the ﬁnancing of
terrorism has been set up in the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. It is
composed of representatives of the Federal Security Service, the Ministry of Internal
Aﬀairs, the Ministry of Foreign Aﬀairs, the Federal Service of Tax Police, the Foreign
Intelligence Service, the Bank of Russia and the Procurator-General of the Russian
Federation. During the period when the Committee of the Russian Federation on
Financial Monitoring was being set up and starting its actual work, the following
questions were referred to this working group:
—
Interaction with overseas partners in the suppression of ﬁnancing of terrorism;
—
Coordination of the activities of law enforcement agencies and oversight
organizations;
—
Interaction with the Federal Counter-Terrorist Commission.
In December 2001, the State Duma of the Russian Federation adopted Federal Act
No. 95528–3 ‘On the introduction of amendments and additions to legislation of the
Russian Federation’, which provided for the introduction of a number of additions
to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, establishing increased liability for
creation of terrorist organizations, management of such organizations, recruitment to
terrorist groups, supply of weapons and training of persons to commit crimes of a
terrorist nature, as well as ﬁnancing of terrorist organizations.
Under this Act, the mere fact of collecting funds for the commission of terrorist
crimes is suﬃcient grounds for establishment of criminal liability. The Act also provides
for additions to the Code of Criminal Procedure, designed to ensure the safety of
judges and witnesses participating in criminal trials for ‘terrorist’ activities.
The Bank of Russia is working actively to implement Federal Act No. 115 of 7
August 2001 ‘On the prevention of the legalization of funds obtained by criminal
means (money-laundering)’. It has adopted a series of normative and other texts
concerning, inter alia:
— Recommendations to the eﬀect that credit institutions should formulate rules of
internal control in accordance with the Federal Act, including recordkeeping, data
conﬁdentiality guarantees, skills training for supervisors and criteria for exposing
and identifying unusual transactions;
—
Procedure for credit institutions to provide the responsible organ with information
on operations that involve money or other assets and are subject to compulsory
monitoring in accordance with the Federal Act and on other operations that
involve money or other assets connected with moneylaundering;
—
Procedure for the Bank of Russia to verify implementation of the Federal Act by
credit institutions as regards record-keeping and preservation and provision of
information on operations subject to compulsory monitoring and to verify the
existence of internal controls in credit institutions designed to prevent the
legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (money-laundering).

As immediate action to prevent the ﬁnancing of terrorism, in October 2001 the Bank
of Russia notiﬁed the Russian banking system of the measures adopted by the United
States to prevent the ﬁnancing of terrorism and brought to the attention of credit
institutions the list published by the United States of organizations and persons
suspected of being involved in the ﬁnancing of terrorism.
Since the lifeblood of terrorist and extremist organizations is the illegal arms and
drug trade, the Ministry of Foreign Aﬀairs, the Federal Border Service and the State
Customs Committee of the Russian Federation are taking practical measures in these
areas. In particular, in 2000–2001, law enforcement services of the Russian Federation
foiled 296 attempts to smuggle weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices.
In the course of these operations, they seized over 31 million pieces of ammunition, 97
ﬁre arms, about 9,000 explosives and 11 explosive devices. They uncovered instances
of smuggling of over 14 tons of narcotics, including almost 3 tons of heroin; over
300 tons of precursors were seized from illicit traﬃc.
At the outset of the counter-terrorist operation in Afghanistan, the Federal Border
Service sent additional staﬀ to close down the main drug traﬃcking route in the
Tajik-Afghan part of the border. During the ﬁrst 11 months of 2001, units of the
Federal Border Service on the Tajik-Afghan border seized over 5 tons of narcotics,
including 2.4 tons of heroin.
1 (b) What are the oﬀences and penalties in your country with respect to the activities
listed in this subparagraph?
Under article 3 of the Federal Act of 25 July 1998 ‘On measures to combat terrorism’,
the wilful ﬁnancing or provision of other assistance to a terrorist organization or
terrorist group is considered equivalent to terrorist activity. Persons guilty of providing
or collecting funds for the commission of terrorist acts bear criminal liability for the
crimes committed by the terrorists, as accessories to such oﬀences, in the manner
speciﬁed in articles 32 to 34 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. In
accordance with section 5 of article 33 of the Criminal Code, they are considered as
accomplices and are responsible for the commission of speciﬁc oﬀences under the same
article in the special section of the Criminal Code as the perpetrator of the terrorist
act. The extent of their liability is determined by the nature and extent of the actual
participation by each person in the commission of the oﬀence (section 1 of article 34
of the Criminal Code).
The need to increase the criminal liability of persons guilty of collecting funds for
the commission of terrorist acts led to the drafting of the legislation mentioned in the
answer under subparagraph 1 (a). According to this draft, the mere fact of collecting
funds for the commission of such oﬀences is suﬃcient grounds for establishing criminal
liability.
1 (c) What legislation and procedures exist for freezing accounts and assets at banks and
ﬁnancial institutions?
The procedure for the attachment of physical persons’ property, including monetary
deposits, following the commission of oﬀences is described in article 175 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, which is in
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
179
 

force in the Russian Federation. Property may be attached in the case of persons
accused or suspected of committing oﬀences, persons who under the law bear material
responsibility for their actions and other persons possessing property acquired by
criminal means. The purpose of attachment is to allow the introduction of a civil suit
or forfeiture of the property.
The situation as regards forfeiture of the property of organizations connected with
terrorism is much more complicated. Article 25 of the Federal Act ‘On measures to
combat terrorism’ provides for the possibility of a court decision recognizing that an
organization is a terrorist organization and ordering its liquidation. In this case, the
organization’s property is liable to be forfeited and returned to the State. Article 27 of
the Federal Act of 3 February 1996 ‘On banks and banking activity’ establishes the
procedure for attachment of juridical persons’ monetary assets on account with,
deposited with or in the safekeeping of credit institutions.
At this time, Russian ministries and departments are actively engaged in drafting
legislation whereby organizations could be more promptly held liable for supporting
terrorist activity.
1 (d) What measures exist to prohibit the activities listed in this subparagraph?
In the Russian Federation, a general prohibition on the provision to physical or
juridical persons of funds for the commission of terrorist acts exists in the form of
the establishment of criminal liability of physical persons for participation in oﬀences
of a terrorist nature (Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) and the liquidation
of organizations supporting terrorism (Federal Act ‘On measures to combat
terrorism’). However, the person concerned must be aware that he is providing
the funds speciﬁcally for terrorist purposes; otherwise the establishment of any kind
of liability would be contrary to the Russian Federation’s international obligations
in the matter of the protection of human rights (see, for example, article 11 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 6 of the European Convention
for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) and to the principle
of the presumption of innocence enshrined in article 49 of the Constitution of the
Russian Federation.
In order to block channels for the ﬁnancing of the activities of illegal armed units, in
2000–2001 the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation identiﬁed over 150
commercial entities engaged in foreign trade activities controlled by organized criminal
groupings. In cooperation with the relevant services of other countries, foreign inform-
ers were placed in these criminal groupings. The information on their activities is used
by Russian law enforcement agencies to halt their illegal activity and take the necessary
measures to that end.
2 (a) What legislation or other measures are in place to give eﬀect to this subparagraph?
In particular, what oﬀences in your country prohibit (i) recruitment to terrorist groups
and (ii) the supply of weapons to terrorists?
What other measures help prevent such activities?
Partial answers to these questions are given in the comment under 1 (a).

It should also be noted that at this time recruitment to terrorist groups and the
supply of weapons to terrorists by physical persons are considered as complicity in the
oﬀences committed by the terrorists. Persons who recruit terrorists may be held crim-
inally liable under articles 209 on ‘Banditry’ and 210 on ‘Organization of criminal
society’ (criminal organization) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
Persons who supply weapons to terrorists are liable under article 222 of the Criminal
Code on ‘Illegal acquisition, transfer, sale, storage, transport or carrying of weapons,
basic parts thereof, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices’. Organizations
engaged in similar activities are liable to liquidation, in accordance with article 25 of
the Federal Act ‘On measures to combat terrorism’.
In pursuance of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), draft Federal Act No.
52289–3 has been submitted to the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the
introduction of amendments and additions to the Federal Act ‘On measures to combat
terrorism’, concerning the issues of exchange of intelligence information, compensation
for damage caused by terrorist acts and additional measures to combat illegal trade in
weapons, explosives and ammunition.
2 (b) What other steps are being taken to prevent the commission of terrorist acts and, in
particular, what early warning mechanisms exist to allow exchange of information with
other States?
At present, the Russian Federal Security Service has oﬃcial contacts with over 80 law
enforcement agencies and special services of other States. In practice, an important
component of this cooperation is mutual assistance in the context of the war on inter-
national terrorism.
In 2001, practical mutual assistance involving foreign partners took an important
new form: cooperation in surveillance of the ﬁnancial activities of terrorist units (pri-
marily the Chechen ‘irreconcilables’), identiﬁcation of various banking structures,
non-governmental organizations and the funds subsidizing them.
Arrangements have been made to implement joint operational measures with certain
special services in order to identify ﬁrms sponsoring Chechen terrorists, channels for
the supply of weapons, mercenaries and ﬁghter training camps.
In order to provide early warning of terrorism, intelligence surveillance has been set
up of the activities of extremist organizations in Russia and in the member countries
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in conjunction with the law
enforcement agencies of those countries. At present, for example, six international
religious organizations with extremist leanings are under close scrutiny by the Russian
authorities. The authorities of Azerbaijan, in cooperation with Russian law enforce-
ment agencies, recently shut down a centre providing ﬁnancing to religious extremists
and identiﬁed 27 members of organizations actively participating in the ﬁghting in
Dagestan, nine of whom have been detained.
In the course of counter-terrorist operations in the Northern Caucasus Region,
preventive measures are being taken to ensure the safety of the population and the
local organs of authority; they have foiled attempts to provide ﬁnancial, material
and technical support, weapons and ammunition to illegal armed units for the
commission of terrorist acts both in the territory of the Russian Federation and
beyond its borders.

In order to enhance the eﬀectiveness of international and interdepartmental cooper-
ation, including early warning mechanisms for the exchange of information in the war
on terrorism, the Council of Heads of Customs Services of the CIS countries has, at
the initiative of the Russian Federation, established a special regional liaison centre for
CIS with the World Trade Organization (Moscow RILO).
2(c) What legislation or procedures exist for denying safe haven to terrorists, such as
laws for excluding or expelling the types of individuals referred to in this subparagraph?
The Federal Act ‘On procedures for leaving and entering the Russian Federation’
establishes that aliens and stateless persons are denied entry into the Russian Feder-
ation if this is necessary for reasons of national security and if during any previous
stay in the country they were sentenced under Russian legislation for the commission
of serious or particularly serious oﬀences, which include terrorism.
In accordance with articles 2 and 5 of the Federal Act of 28 July 1996 ‘On refugees’,
terrorists cannot be recognized as refugees.
According to paragraph 5 of the Statute on the procedure for granting of political
asylum by the Russian Federation, conﬁrmed by Decree of the President of the Russian
Federation of 21 July 1997, political asylum in the territory of the Russian Federation
is not granted to a person prosecuted for actions or omissions categorized as oﬀences
in the Russian Federation or a person guilty of committing actions contrary to the
purposes and principles of the United Nations. Thus it is impossible under Russian
legislation for asylum to be granted to terrorists or their accomplices.
As part of the joint war on terrorism and organized crime in CIS, in the course of
operations conducted since the beginning of 2001, 2,013 criminals were identiﬁed for
purposes of extradition in CIS countries and 1,443 persons were extradited.
During the same period, agencies of the Ministries of Internal Aﬀairs of the CIS
countries and the Baltic States identiﬁed 236 criminals for extradition in the Russian
Federation and 109 of them were extradited. In 2001, the Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs
of the Russian Federation transmitted to the relevant Ministries of the CIS member
countries 75 documents concerning anti-terrorist activity.
2(d) What legislation or procedures exist to prevent terrorists from acting from your
territory against other States or citizens?
See comments under paragraphs 1 (b) and 2 (a).
2(e) What steps have been taken to establish terrorist acts as serious criminal oﬀences
and to ensure that the punishment reﬂects the seriousness of such terrorist acts?
Under article 15 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, serious criminal
oﬀences are premeditated actions for which the maximum punishment does not exceed
10 years’ imprisonment and particularly serious premeditated actions for which the
maximum punishment is over ten years’ imprisonment or a more severe punishment.
Article 205 of the Criminal Code states that the punishment for ‘terrorism’ is
imprisonment for a period of from 5 to 10 years, for a period of from 8 to 15 years in
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
182
 
www.ebook3000.com

cases with aggravating circumstances and for a period of from 10 to 20 years in cases
with especially aggravating circumstances.
Terrorist acts are thus serious or especially serious oﬀences, a fact which has special
signiﬁcance in determining the maximum punishment for repeat oﬀenders (articles 18
and 68 of the Criminal Code).
See also the comments under paragraph 3 (a).
2(f) What procedures and mechanisms are in place to assist other States? Please provide
any available details of how these have been used in practice.
Existing Russian legislation allows the attachment, at the request of foreign partners,
of property and funds of physical and juridical persons only on the basis of properly
submitted requests for the provision of judicial assistance in criminal cases under
investigation by them.
In order to expedite the processing of such requests in cases involving oﬀences of a
terrorist nature, agreements have been reached with the representatives of certain
countries for coordinators from the two parties to be appointed to deal with issues of
mutual assistance in this area.
The Procurator-General has been given responsibility for coordinating the response
of the Russian Federation’s law enforcement agencies to requests for judicial assistance
in criminal cases concerning oﬀences of a terrorist nature.
In October and November 2001, following a request from the competent United
States agencies, the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation conducted a
search in Russian territory for the funds and assets of a number of representatives of
terrorist organizations and juridical persons connected with them.
See also the comments under paragraph 3 (c) and the section entitled ‘Additional
information’.
2(g) How do border controls in your country prevent the movement of terrorists? How do
your procedures for the issuance of identity papers and travel documents support this?
In accordance with paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) specifying
that terrorists and terrorist groups should not be allowed to move freely in its territory,
the Federal Border Service of the Russian Federation has established eﬀective border
control in the case of persons who have been properly denied entry into the country.
‘The Federal Border Service receives its instructions from the law enforcement agen-
cies conducting intelligence investigations of persons who have been prohibited from
entering and leaving the Russian Federation in the manner established by the laws of
the Federation.
Screening operations are conducted in the case of persons allegedly involved in the
activities of terrorist groups.
Certain aliens and stateless persons are questioned to determine whether the purpose
of their travel in the Russian Federation corresponds to the purpose which they stated
when they obtained Russian visas at consular missions abroad of the Russian Ministry
of Foreign Aﬀairs.
Thus, during the period from September to December 2001, the border control
agencies of the Russian Federation identiﬁed 32,292 persons (including 27,078 aliens)
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
183
 

without proper papers or with incorrectly issued papers authorizing them to cross the
State border.
3(a) What steps have been taken to intensify and accelerate the exchange of operational
information in the areas indicated in this subparagraph?
In order to prevent the commission of terrorist acts, the Federal Border Service of the
Russian Federation has instituted a regular exchange of information with neighbouring
States under bilateral and multilateral agreements on mutual assistance in the protection
of State borders.
With a view to intensifying and accelerating the exchange of information, a second
meeting was held in Moscow and Saint Petersburg of heads of border agencies of
Canada, the Republic of Korea, the United States, Japan and the Russian Federation,
at which speciﬁc areas were identiﬁed for mutual assistance in agreed areas of
cooperation.
The outcome of the meeting was a decision to establish national border coordinating
centres in each of the countries to provide liaison at the bilateral and multilateral levels.
In connection with the creation of an information system, the participants in the
meeting identiﬁed channels for the exchange of information and methods to ensure
its conﬁdentiality. It was decided, as an experiment, to have a bilateral exchange of
information between the north-east regional oﬃce of the Federal Border Service of the
Russian Federation and the 17th United States Coast Guard District.
3(b) What steps have been taken to exchange information and cooperate in the areas
indicated in this subparagraph?
The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has organized with the military of
the States participating in the anti-terrorist coalition regular exchanges of information
on the activities of armed terrorist groupings. Regular exchanges of information with
partners in the anti-terrorist coalition are also organized by other Russian ministries
and departments, particularly in the context of the special services.
In order to intensify and accelerate exchanges of operational information, as envis-
aged in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), it would be desirable to create an
international database of persons and structures providing ﬁnancial support to terror-
ism and methods by which such support is provided. It would also be important to
organize regular exchanges of information on sources and channels for the smuggling
to and from countries of currency, highly dangerous nuclear materials, chemical and
biological substances, weapons and drugs, as well as customs oﬀences and other
oﬀences in oﬀ-shore zones. Cross-checking of export-import contracts and of circuits
to prevent currency embezzlement and concealment of currency in foreign banks could
also be an eﬀective way of detecting and prosecuting oﬀences. This would also be
facilitated by the creation of a mechanism for the exchange of information between the
customs authorities of the Russian Federation and the corresponding authorities in
other countries concerning all types of banking operations for criminal cases being
tried and investigations being conducted.

3(c) What steps have been taken to cooperate in the areas indicated in this subparagraph?
The answer to this question is given in the comments under paragraphs 3 (a) and (b).
In addition, it was decided at the Yerevan session of the Council on Collective Security
(25 May 2001) to set up by 1 August 2001 collective rapid-deployment forces under the
Treaty on Collective Security in the Central Asian region, to include units and subdivi-
sions of the armed forces of four CIS States (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
the Russian Federation). The forces’ task is to provide military security for the States
parties to the Treaty on Collective Security in the Central Asian region; this includes
averting external military aggression and conducting joint anti-terrorist operations.
Moreover, as part of the speciﬁc measures (in view of the anti-terrorist operation
‘Enduring Freedom’) adopted in accordance with the decision of the President of the
Russian Federation and the decrees of the Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation
of 23 September 2001, an interdepartmental system of control and mutual assistance
was set up in the form of a Coordination Group headed by the Minister of Defence
of the Russian Federation. An Operational Headquarters headed by the chief of the
Main Intelligence Unit of the General Staﬀ of the Armed Forces of the Russian
Federation is a working body of the Coordination Group and an Intelligence Unit is
outposted to Dushanbe.
Mutual assistance to combat terrorism is being actively promoted within the Shang-
hai Cooperation Organization. For example, on 15 July 2001 the leaders of the six
member States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization signed the Shanghai Con-
vention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism. Work is continuing on
the drafting of constituent instruments for the regional anti-terrorist structure of the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
3(d) and (e) What are your intentions regarding signing and/or ratifying the conventions
and protocols referred to in this subparagraph? Provide any relevant information on
the implementation of the conventions, protocols and resolutions referred to in this
subparagraph.
The Russian Federation is a party to 10 of the 12 global anti-terrorist conventions. An
advanced stage has been reached in preparations for ratiﬁcation of the International
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999) and the Conven-
tion on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection (1990), which
have been signed by the Russian Federation.
In order to promote enforcement of Security Council resolutions 1267 of 15 October
1999 and 1333 of 19 December 2000, the President of the Russian Federation signed
Decrees on measures to implement those resolutions, providing, inter alia, for the
immediate freezing of the funds and other ﬁnancial assets of terrorist groups and
physical persons connected with the activities of the Taliban movement and the
Al-Quaeda organization.
3(f) What legislation, procedures and mechanisms are in place for ensuring asylum-seekers
have not been involved in terrorist activity before granting refugee status?
See comments under paragraph 3 (g).
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
185
 

3(g) What procedures are in place to prevent the abuse of refugee status by terrorists?
Please provide details of legislation and/or administrative procedures which prevent claims
of political motivation being recognized as grounds for refusing requests for the extradition
of alleged terrorists.
These paragraphs of the resolution are implemented by the procedures for recognizing
that persons are refugees or need to be granted political asylum that are established in
the Federal Act ‘On refugees’ and in the Statute on the procedure for granting political
asylum. The concept of ‘political crime’ does not exist in the Russian Federation.
In addition, reference may not be made to political motives for the commission of
the actions (which include terrorism) classiﬁed as crimes under Russian legislation
and the international treaties to which the Russian Federation is a party, even in con-
nection with the extradition of persons accused of committing or being involved in
terrorist acts.

Additional information
1.
In accordance with paragraph 4 of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), which
notes the close connection between international terrorism and transnational
crime, and in view of the need to improve the coordination of eﬀorts in this
connection at the national level, a Federal Anti-Terrorist Commission has been
established headed by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation and consisting
of the heads of the relevant departments. Similar commissions are being established
in the various parts of the Russian Federation.
2.
In order to meet more fully the requirements of Security Council resolution 1373
(2001), the Russian Federation is engaged in active multilateral and bilateral
cooperation to combat terrorism by means of:
—
Bilateral intergovernmental agreements on air traﬃc, containing special articles
on aviation safety;
— Universal and regional treaties on crime prevention, containing provisions on
measures to combat terrorism, in particular the 1998 Agreement between the
Governments of member States of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic
Cooperation on cooperation in combating crime, particularly organized forms
thereof, and the 1998 Treaty on Cooperation among the States Members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States in Combating Terrorism;
— Bilateral intergovernmental treaties on cooperation in combating crime (con-
cluded with Belgium, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland,
Israel, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom,
Uzbekistan). In 1996, the Agreement between the Government of the Russian
Federation and the Government of the United States of America on cooper-
ation in matters of criminal law entered into force;
— Bilateral interdepartmental agreements on cooperation with competent
departments in other countries (concluded with CIS countries and with
Albania, Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic,

Estonia, France, Hungary, India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Latvia, Lithua-
nia, Macedonia, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa,
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Vietnam, etc.);
— Inter-State treaties on extradition and judicial assistance in criminal cases
(the Russian Federation is currently party to three multilateral conventions
concluded under the auspices of the Council of Europe and CIS and 33
bilateral treaties on extradition and judicial assistance in criminal cases);
— Other international agreements (for example, the Memorandum of Under-
standing of 11 March 2000 between the Ministries of Internal Aﬀairs of the
Republic of Azerbaijan, the Republic of Armenia, Georgia and the Russian
Federation (the ‘Borzhomi Four’) on measures to combat terrorism and other
manifestations of extremism, the Memoranda of Understanding between the
Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs of the Russian Federation and the Ministries of
Internal Aﬀairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Georgia concerning meas-
ures to combat terrorism);

I have the honour to transmit herewith additional information in response to your
letter of 18 April 2002 regarding the report submitted by the Russian Federation to
the Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to United Nations Security Council
resolution 1373 (2001) (see enclosure).
(Signed) G. Gatilov
Permanent Representative a.i.
Enclosure
Additional information provided by the Russian Federation in response to the questions
prepared by the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council on the report of
the Russian Federation, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)
Subparagraph 1 (a)
—
Please outline the amendments and additions made to the Criminal Code of the
Russian Federation with reference to the requirements of resolution 1373 (2001).
Pursuant to subparagraph 1 (a) of the resolution, the State Duma of the Federal
Assembly of the Russian Federation on 28 June 2002 adopted Federal Act No. 97528–3
‘On the introduction of amendments and additions to the Criminal Code of the
Russian Federation’. This Act establishes increased liability for the recruitment and
training of terrorists and the ﬁnancing of terrorist activities and organizations.
Pursuant to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation which is in force, persons
who recruit, train or ﬁnance terrorists may be considered accessories to a criminal
oﬀence and prosecuted.
Inducing a person to commit a terrorist oﬀence (by recruiting the person) constitutes
incitement and the perpetrator is held liable under the relevant article of the special
section of the Criminal Code and article 33, section 4, of the Code. If a person has
facilitated the commission of a terrorist oﬀence by means of advice, directions, the
provision of information (for example, has provided training material or recommenda-
tions on how to carry out a terrorist act, or has supplied the means to carry it out—
money, valuables or other assets), that person may be considered an accomplice to the
oﬀence. The liability of such a person is stipulated in the relevant article of the special
section of the Criminal Code and article 33, section 5, of the Code.
— Please explain how the federal anti-terrorism laws are implemented by the various
federal units of the Russian Federation and how coordination is achieved amongst the
federal agencies and the agencies of the units on the one hand and amongst the
agencies of the units on the other hand.
Coordination of anti-terrorist activity amongst the federal agencies and the agencies of
the units of the Russian Federation on the one hand and amongst the agencies of the
units on the other is achieved in accordance with the law. The Federal Anti-Terrorist
Commission is the federal coordinating body which ensures cooperation among the
units working to combat terrorism named in article 6 of the Federal Act ‘On measures
to combat terrorism’ and contained in the list of federal executive authorities involved,
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
191
 

within their sphere of competence, in preventing, detecting and suppressing terrorist
activity (conﬁrmed by Decision No. 660 of the Government of the Russian Federation
of 22 June 1999).
Investigative jurisdiction and the procedure for coordination in the investigation of
terrorist oﬀences are governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian
Federation which came into force on 1 July 2002.
Subparagraph 1 (c)
— Please explain whether the Russian Federation is able, under its current laws, to
freeze funds, ﬁnancial assets and economic resources of resident and non-resident
persons and entities supporting terrorism either inside the Russian Federation or
outside its territory.
Under current Russian law, a decision to freeze (attach) the accounts of persons and
organizations linked to terrorist activity may be taken when criminal or civil proceed-
ings are instituted pursuant to the procedures provided for in the Code of Criminal
Procedure of the Russian Federation, the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian
Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and the Federal Act ‘On enforcement
proceedings’ (No. 119 of 21 July 1997). Such a decision may be taken by: (a) investiga-
tive bodies for criminal cases being tried; (b) a court (commercial or ordinary) in the
context of civil proceedings for the introduction of a civil suit; (c) investigative and
judicial bodies when they are carrying out international investigative instructions
(requests) in accordance with international agreements.
The legal mechanism for freezing funds which belong to citizens and which may be
used to commit criminal oﬀences, including terrorist oﬀences, is laid down in articles
115 and 116 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, which
entered into force on 1 July 2002.
These articles provide for the possibility of attaching the accounts of both individual
citizens and organizations for criminal cases being tried which involve terrorism and
other related oﬀences. The purpose of attaching an account may be to halt illegal
activity, introduce a suit or permit forfeiture of property on the basis of the results of
a criminal investigation.
Similarly, the question of suits against citizens or organizations which are being
heard by the courts is decided according to the procedure set out in the Code of Civil
Procedure of the RSFSR and the Federal Act ‘On enforcement proceedings’.
Additional possibilities for forfeiture of the property of organizations connected
with terrorism are provided for in article 25 of the Federal Act ‘On measures to combat
terrorism’ (No. 130 of 25 June 1998). Pursuant to this article, an organization may, by
a court decision, be recognized as a terrorist organization and liquidated. In this case,
its property is liable to be forfeited and returned to the State.
Article 27 of Federal Act No. 395–1 of 2 December 1990 ‘On banks and banking
activity’ establishes the procedure for attachment of juridical persons’ monetary assets
on account with, deposited with or in the safekeeping of credit institutions. Attach-
ment may be imposed by a court, a commercial court or a judge, or by a decision of the
pre-trial investigative bodies with the approval of the public prosecutor. Monetary
assets and other valuables may be forfeited on the basis of a court judgement which
has become enforceable.

In respect of actions to freeze, attach or forfeit accounts, Russian law does not
distinguish between citizens of the Russian Federation and foreign citizens who have
committed criminal oﬀences in the Russian Federation.

Please provide the CTC with a progress report on, and an outline of, the draft
legislation mentioned in reply to this subparagraph.
Draft Federal Act No. 152289–3 on the introduction of amendments and additions to
the Federal Act ‘On measures to combat terrorism’, initiated by members of the State
Duma, is aimed at bringing current Russian law into line with the obligations which
the Russian Federation has entered into by ratifying the International Convention
for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings (1997) and the International Convention for
the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999) and covers, in particular, the
issues of exchange of intelligence information, compensation for damage caused by
terrorist acts, and additional measures to combat illegal trade in weapons, explosives
and ammunition.
Subparagraph 1 (d)
—
Is there any law in the Russian Federation governing alternative money transfer
mechanisms such as Hawalah?
Russian law does not contain legal rules governing alternative money transfer mechan-
isms. It does not prohibit money transfers through the banking and credit system,
payment unions (such as Western Union), or by post or telegraph or via the Internet.
The laws and regulations existing in this ﬁeld are, in particular, Federal Act No. 176
‘On postal communications’ of 17 July 1999 and Decision No. 725 of the Government
of the Russian Federation ‘On conﬁrmation of the rules for the provision of postal
communication services’ of 26 September 2000.

Could the Russian Federation please describe what preventive controls and surveil-
lance measures are put in place to ensure that funds and economic resources collected
for religious, charitable or cultural purposes are not diverted from their stated
purposes?
Under Russian law, the activity of organizations established for religious, charitable or
cultural purposes is governed by the following laws and regulations: Federal Act No.
125 of 26 September 1997 ‘On freedom of conscience and religious associations’;
Federal Act No. 135 of 11 August 1995 ‘On charitable activities and charitable
organizations’; and Federal Act No. 82 of 19 May 1995 ‘On public associations’.
In accordance with these Acts, registration bodies check to ensure that the activities
of the organizations in question correspond to the purposes for which they were estab-
lished and which are enshrined in their statutes. In addition, public and charitable
organizations submit yearly activity reports to the registration bodies.

professional participants in the securities market; insurance and leasing companies;
postal and telegraphic organizations and other non-credit institutions which carry out
money transfers; and pawnshops. Lawyers and other ﬁnancial intermediaries are not
included on this list. If organizations which perform operations involving money or
other assets and which operate on the basis of a licence violate the requirements laid
down in the aforementioned Act, their licences may be revoked (nulliﬁed) in accordance
with the procedure stipulated by Russian law.
Persons guilty of violating the Act bear administrative, civil and criminal liability

Subparagraph 2 (a)
—
Please outline the relevant provisions of the Russian Federation’s laws (including any
recent amendments) and procedures for regulating the manufacture, sale, possession,
storage and transport of weapons and explosives within the Russian Federation.
The manufacture, sale, possession, storage and transport of weapons and explosives
within the Russian Federation are governed by a number of laws and regulations,
including Federal Act No. 150 of 13 October 1996 ‘On weapons’, Federal Act No. 128
of 8 August 2001 ‘On the licensing of individual types of activity’, Decision No. 814 of
the Government of the Russian Federation of 21 July 1998 ‘On measures to regulate
the circulation of civilian and service weapons and ammunition therefor in the terri-
tory of the Russian Federation’, Decision No. 1314 of the Government of the Russian
Federation of 15 October 1997 ‘On conﬁrmation of the rules governing the circulation
of oﬀensive small arms and other weapons, ammunition and cartridges therefor, and
steel weapons in State paramilitary organizations’, the Instruction ‘On the licensing of
activities relating to the storage, transport and destruction of chemical weapons and
the handling of toxic chemicals and waste formed during the destruction of chemical
weapons’ (conﬁrmed by Decision No. 199 of the Government of the Russian Feder-
ation of 19 March 2001) and Order No. 288 of the Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs of the
Russian Federation of 12 April 1999 ‘On measures to implement the Decision of the
Government of the Russian Federation’.
Under Russian law, tougher penalties have been introduced for oﬀences of this kind
and the number of provisions providing for criminal liability has increased. For
example, article 222, section 1, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation estab-
lishes criminal liability for the illegal acquisition, transfer, sale, storage, transport or
carrying of ﬁrearms, basic parts thereof, ammunition, explosives or explosive devices.
Sections 2 and 3 set out the deﬁning characteristics of a conspiracy and an organized
group, increasing the liability for such activity. Section 4 establishes liability for the
illegal acquisition, sale or carrying of gas or steel weapons, including throwing weapons,
except in those areas where the carrying of a steel weapon is part of national dress or is
connected with hunting. Article 223 of the Criminal Code establishes criminal liability
for the illegal manufacture or repair of the aforementioned types of weapon. In order to
ensure public safety and, in addition, to protect human life, health and, where appropri-
ate, property, article 224 of the Criminal Code establishes criminal liability, in the event
of serious consequences, for negligent storage of a ﬁrearm; article 225 establishes crimi-
nal liability for inadequate fulﬁlment of obligations to guard a ﬁrearm, ammunition,
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
195
 

explosives or explosive devices, in the event that this leads to their theft or destruction or
other serious consequences (section 1), and also for inadequate fulﬁlment of obligations
to guard nuclear, chemical, biological or other types of weapons of mass destruction, or
materials or equipment which could be used to create weapons of mass destruction,
in the event that this also causes serious consequences or threatens to cause them
(section 2). The theft or extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives or explosive
devices are also criminal oﬀences (article 226 of the Criminal Code).
In cases where violations of the rules for handling weapons, ammunition, radio-
active materials, explosives or other substances and objects create an increased risk to
people in the vicinity and, through negligence, this causes serious or moderately serious
damage to human health, the destruction of military equipment or other serious
consequences, or loss of human life, the perpetrators bear criminal liability under
article 349 of the Criminal Code. The rules deﬁning increased risk to people in the
vicinity are set out in military statutes, manuals, instructions and other regulatory acts.
Article 255 of the Criminal Code establishes liability for the manufacture, acquisi-
tion or sale of chemical, biological or other types of weapons of mass destruction
prohibited by the international agreements of the Russian Federation. With regard to
the regulation of the circulation of explosives and pyrotechnic articles, in accordance
with the decision of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Commission of 8 February 2002
(question 3, paragraph 2, of report No. 8), the Russian Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs has
prepared draft acts ‘On the circulation of explosives’ and ‘On the circulation of pyro-
technic articles for civilian purposes’ and has sent them to the relevant ministries and
agencies for study and submission of comments and suggestions.

Please explain how international trade in weapons and explosives is regulated by the
Russian Federation.
Foreign trade in manufactured articles for military use, in particular weapons and
explosives, is regulated by Federal Act No. 114 of 19 July 1998 ‘On military and
technical cooperation between the Russian Federation and foreign States’. The principal
means of State regulation and implementation of the State monopoly in the ﬁeld of
military and technical cooperation are:
—
Licensing of the development and manufacture of articles for military use;
—
Speciﬁcation of the procedure for the import, export, sale and/or purchase of
manufactured articles for military use;
—
A procedure for the authorization of activity in the ﬁeld of military and technical
cooperation;
—
Legal and organizational regulation of this activity;
—
Operation of an export control system;
—
Speciﬁcation of the procedure for granting Russian organizations the right to
engage in foreign trade activity relating to manufactured articles for military use;
—
Licensing of the import and export of manufactured articles for military use;
—
Not allowing any single entity to exercise a monopoly on military and technical
cooperation in the Russian Federation;
—
Customs regulation;
—
Coordination by the State authorities of the Russian Federation of the activity of

entities involved in military and technical cooperation and implementation of
proper control of this activity.
The Committee of the Russian Federation for Military and Technical Cooperation
with Foreign States was set up in accordance with the aforementioned Act for the
purpose of improving the eﬃciency of military and technical cooperation on the basis
of Decree No. 1953 of the President of the Russian Federation of 1 December 2000 on
‘Issues of military and technical cooperation between the Russian Federation and
foreign States’ and Decree No. 1417 of 10 December 2001 ‘On the introduction of
amendments and additions to the provisions and procedure conﬁrmed by Decree
No. 1953 of the President of the Russian Federation of 1 December 2000 on ‘Issues
of military and technical cooperation between the Russian Federation and foreign
States.’ It is the federal executive authority which implements, within its sphere of
competence, decisions of the President or Government of the Russian Federation relat-
ing to the regulation and control of activity in the ﬁeld of military and technical
cooperation between the Russian Federation and foreign States, and also implements
international agreements of the Russian Federation in the ﬁeld of military and
technical cooperation.
These Decrees conﬁrm the related Instructions ‘On the procedure for implementing
military and technical cooperation between the Russian Federation and foreign States’,
‘On the Committee of the Russian Federation for Military and Technical Cooper-
ation’, ‘On the Commission on Issues of Military and Technical Cooperation between
the Russian Federation and Foreign States’ and ‘On the procedure for granting organ-
izations in the Russian Federation the right to engage in foreign trade activity relating
to manufactured articles for military use’. The Decrees also establish a list of documents
to be submitted by an organization in the Russian Federation to the Russian Agency
for the Defence Industry (through the proper channels) to enable the Agency to
consider whether to grant the organization the right to engage in foreign trade activity
relating to manufactured articles for military use; a procedure for applications by
foreign clients and approval of draft decisions of the President or Government of the
Russian Federation or the Committee of the Russian Federation for Military and
Technical Cooperation with Foreign States on deliveries of manufactured articles for
military use; a procedure for the licensing in the Russian Federation of the import and
export of manufactured articles for military use (the import and export of such articles
are subject to control and carried out under licence); and a list of federal executive
authorities responsible for coordinating activity and exercising control in the ﬁeld of
military and technical cooperation between the Russian Federation and foreign States
and for addressing other aspects of State regulation in this ﬁeld.
The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of the Russian Federation is
responsible for the following functions (Order No. 127 of the Minister of 28 December
2000): organizing the export portion of a State defence order and fulﬁlling the inter-
national obligations of the Russian Federation regarding control of the export of
manufactured articles for military use and dual-use goods and technology for the
purpose of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles for delivering
them.

Subparagraph 2 (d)
— Are there any legal provisions that prohibit persons who are carrying on legitimate
activities in the Russian Federation from oﬀering support to terrorism elsewhere?
The prohibition on the provision by physical and juridical persons of funds for the
commission of terrorist acts is implemented through the establishment of criminal
liability of physical persons for participation in oﬀences of a terrorist nature (articles
33 and 34 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) and liability in the form of
liquidation of organizations which support terrorism, pursuant to the Federal Act
‘On measures to combat terrorism’. In June 2002, the State Duma of the Russian
Federation adopted Federal Act No. 97528–3 ‘On the introduction of amendments
and additions to legislation of the Russian Federation’, which provided for the intro-
duction of a number of additions to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,
establishing increased liability for creation of terrorist organizations, management of
such organizations, recruitment to terrorist groups, supply of weapons and training
of persons to commit oﬀences of a terrorist nature, as well as ﬁnancing of terrorist
organizations.
Under this Act, the mere fact of collecting funds for the commission of terrorist
oﬀences is suﬃcient grounds for establishment of criminal liability. Decree No. 393 of
the President of the Russian Federation of 17 April 2002 ‘On measures to implement
United Nations Security Council resolutions 1388 (2002) of 15 January 2002 and 1390
(2002) of 16 January 2002’ prohibits the supply, sale and transfer from the territory
of the Russian Federation, or by its nationals outside its territory, to members of the
al-Qaidah organization and the Taliban movement and other persons, groups, com-
panies and organizations connected with them, of manufactured articles for military
use, dual-use goods and technology, spare parts, assembled units and auxiliary equip-
ment for such articles and goods, and prohibits the provision of technical advice and
assistance related to military activities in this ﬁeld.

What is the mechanism available for inter-agency cooperation between the authorities
responsible for narcotics control, ﬁnancial tracking and border control?
Decision No. 660 of the Government of the Russian Federation of 22 June 1999
conﬁrmed the list of federal executive authorities involved, within their sphere of com-
petence, in preventing, detecting and suppressing terrorist activity.
Pursuant to Federal Act No. 115 ‘On the prevention of the legalization of funds
obtained by criminal means (money-laundering)’ and Decree No. 1263 of the President
of the Russian Federation of 1 November 2001 ‘On the organ empowered to prevent
the legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (moneylaundering)’, the Com-
mittee of the Russian Federation for Financial Monitoring was set up and began to
tackle the tasks assigned to it.
The list of federal executive authorities involved, within their sphere of competence,
in implementing United Nations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) (concerning
ﬁnancial tracking for the purpose of preventing the ﬁnancing of terrorism) is set out
in Decree No. 6 of the President of the Russian Federation of 10 January 2002 ‘On
measures to implement United Nations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) of
28 September 2001’.

On 7 May 1998, the Centre for Inter-agency Cooperation for the Suppression of
Illicit Drug Traﬃcking was set up in the Russian Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs, and
oﬃces for inter-agency cooperation were established in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Bryansk,
Krasnodar and Vladivostok, to which oﬃcials of the Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs, the
Federal Security Service, the Federal Border Service and the State Customs Committee
of the Russian Federation were recruited on a permanent basis. The Centre devotes
particular attention to promoting the formation of an organizational basis for cooper-
ation in the units of the Russian Federation, particularly in the border regions.
An increasing number of agencies are being included as sub departments respon-
sible for inter-agency cooperation to combat drug smuggling. In a number of regions,
oﬃcials of the Federal Service of Tax Police of the Russian Federation are being
recruited to the oﬃces with the aim of undermining the economic base of trans-
national drug rings. In addition, the operational possibilities of military counter-
intelligence are being used more and more actively in border regions. The Ministry of
Internal Aﬀairs, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Border Service and the State
Customs Committee of the Russian Federation have been considering the question of
establishing temporary subdepartments for interagency cooperation on the suppres-
sion of illicit drug traﬃcking in the border units of the Russian Federation. To date,
such sub departments have been established in 66 regions of the Russian Federation.
Moreover, in recent years, one of the ways in which the law enforcement agencies of
the Russian Federation have reacted to the change in operational conditions related to
illicit traﬃcking in narcotic substances has been to organize and carry out inter-agency
strategical-preventive operations under the code name ‘Channel’. The main objectives
of the operations are:
— Identiﬁcation and blocking of the channels for smuggling drugs into the Russian
Federation;
—
Use and maintenance of a single databank on drug traﬃckers and dealers and
eﬀorts to catch them in ﬂagrante delicto;
—
Further improvement of the mechanism for cooperation between regional subde-
partments of the Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs, the State Customs Committee, the
Federal Border Service and the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation
in the ﬁeld and similar law enforcement agencies of neighbouring States which are
taking part in a given operation.
This year, the Russian Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs considered the issue of conducting
a joint inter-agency ‘Channel’ operation in the distant approaches to the Russian
borders, in particular directly at the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
Discussions are currently under way with representatives of the Ministry of Internal
Aﬀairs of Finland on the signing of a joint plan for a strategical-preventive ‘Channel’
operation at the Russo-Finnish border, with a view to identifying and blocking the
channels for the supply of narcotics from the States of Central Asia through the
Russian Federation to the countries of Northern Europe. In 2001 and 2002 alone,
the Centre for Inter-agency Cooperation for the Suppression of Illicit Drug Traﬃcking
prepared and conducted 20 inter-agency ‘Channel’ operations.
The organization and practical measures taken made it possible to detect about
5,000 drug oﬀences. Some 1,377 kg of narcotics were seized from illicit traﬃc, including
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
199
 

more than 70 kg of heroin, along with property and smuggled goods worth 4.5 million
roubles or 83,000 United States dollars.
Similar operational plans have been developed and conﬁrmed with Azerbaijan and
Estonia.
Cooperation between the Federal Border Service of the Russian Federation and
other federal executive authorities on combating illicit drug traﬃcking and on border
controls is conducted in accordance with the requirements of joint orders, regulations
and instructions.
In action to combat drug smuggling, the Federal Border Service of the Russian
Federation cooperates closely with the Chief Directorate for Combating Illicit Drug
Traﬃcking of the Organized Crime Division of the Russian Ministry of Internal
Aﬀairs, the Chief Directorate for Combating Smuggling of the Russian State Customs
Committee, and the relevant subdepartments of the Russian Federal Security Service.
At the inter-State level, information is exchanged by the Federal Border Service of the
Russian Federation with neighbouring States on an ongoing basis in accordance with
bilateral and multilateral agreements on cooperation regarding State border controls,
for the purpose of preventing terrorist acts and combating illicit drug traﬃcking and
other transnational oﬀences at the stage of early warning. Regular oﬃcial meetings of
border service representatives are also used for the same purpose.
In Tajikistan, to combat illicit drug traﬃcking, a border group from the Russian
Federal Border Service cooperates at various levels with subdepartments of the State
Border Control Committee of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, the Drug
Control Agency under the Oﬃce of the President, the Tajik Ministries of Internal
Aﬀairs and Security and the State Customs Committee of the Government of the
Republic of Tajikistan.
Moreover, measures to strengthen action against drug smuggling are the constant
central focus of the Council of Commanders of Border Troops of Member States of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The Federal Border Service of the
Russian Federation has established close cooperation with the United Nations Oﬃce
for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP) in the Russian Federation and
Belarus.
In addition to its general border control tasks, the Federal Border Service of the
Russian Federation, in order to prevent identiﬁed terrorists from entering the country:
—
Exercises control in the case of persons who have been denied entry to the country
under established laws of the Russian Federation;
—
Carries out the instructions of the law enforcement agencies and the court bailiﬀs
service with regard to persons whose entry into and departure from the Russian
Federation are restricted in the manner established by law;
—
Conducts checks of persons who are reasonably suspected of involvement in the
activities of terrorist organizations;
—
Questions aliens and stateless persons to determine whether the purpose for
which they have crossed the State border corresponds to the purpose stated in
their visas issued by missions of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Aﬀairs in other
countries.

imprisonment for a period of three to eight years.
—
Are all the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation
applicable in all the following circumstances:
—
Acts committed outside the Russian Federation by a person who is a citizen of,
or habitually resident in, the Russian Federation (whether that person is currently
present in the Russian Federation or not);
—
Acts committed outside the Russian Federation by a foreign national who is currently

Article 12, section 1, of the Criminal Code establishes that citizens of the Russian
Federation and stateless persons habitually resident in the Russian Federation who have
committed oﬀences outside the Russian Federation are liable to prosecution under the
Criminal Code if the acts committed by them are oﬀences in the State in whose territory
they were committed and if the persons have not been convicted in the foreign State.
Foreign nationals and stateless persons not habitually resident in the Russian
Federation who have committed an oﬀence outside the Russian Federation are liable to
prosecution under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation if the oﬀence is directed
against the interests of the Russian Federation or if the case is covered by an inter-
national agreement of the Russian Federation, if the persons have not been convicted
in the foreign State and are prosecuted in the Russian Federation (article 12, section 3,
of the Criminal Code).
Subparagraph 2 (f)
—
Is there any law in the Russian Federation that allows mutual assistance in the
matters of criminal investigation and judicial proceedings?
International cooperation by the Russian Federation in the ﬁeld of criminal justice
currently takes place on a number of levels and in many areas. Relations between the
Russian Federation and other States regarding the provision of mutual assistance in
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

criminal matters are based on agreements (bilateral agreements or conventions) or
conditions of reciprocity.
The principle of reciprocity implies that, if the Russian Federation submits a request
for legal assistance to any State, the request will include an assurance that the Russian
law enforcement agencies, in accordance with international principles of mutual legal
assistance in criminal justice matters, are ready to assist the competent authorities of
the requested State with their requests to obtain evidence and carry out other pro-
cedural acts in territories under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. Bilateral
treaty relations between the Russian Federation and other countries in this ﬁeld are
based on existing treaties on the provision of mutual legal assistance and relevant
intergovernmental agreements. These include treaties with Algeria, Azerbaijan, Canada,
China, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Iran, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan,
Mongolia, Tunisia, Viet Nam, Yemen and Yugoslavia, and the Agreement between the
Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the United States of
America on cooperation in matters of criminal law. The Russian Federation is also
party to a number of multilateral treaties and conventions on combating crime and
implementing criminal justice, including the European Convention on Extradition
(1957), the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (1959)
and the Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and
Criminal Matters (1993). It should be noted that the Russian Federation has no special
law governing the provision of mutual assistance in the matters of criminal investiga-
tion and judicial proceedings. The main provisions governing the procedure for
cooperation between the courts, prosecutors, investigators and bodies which conduct
initial inquiries on the one hand, and the relevant competent authorities and oﬃcials
of foreign States and international organizations on the other, are laid down in chapter
53 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, which came into
force on 1 July 2002.
Subparagraph 2 (g)
—
Please explain how persons found to possess counterfeit identity papers are dealt with
in Russian law.
This procedure is set out in the criminal procedure and administrative law of the
Russian Federation and other regulatory acts establishing the competence of the
authorities and oﬃcials empowered, in particular, to check such papers. Forgery of
identity papers or other oﬃcial documents granting rights or relieving the holder of
obligations, for the purpose of using or selling such a document, and also the produc-
tion of such a document for the same purposes, are punishable by restriction of liberty
for up to three years, detention for a period of four to six months or imprisonment
for up to two years. If such acts are committed repeatedly, they are punishable by
imprisonment for up to four years. The wilful use of a false document is punishable by
a ﬁne equivalent to 100 to 200 times the minimum wage or equivalent to the salary or
other income of the convicted person for a period of one to two months, or compul-
sory labour for a period of 180 to 240 hours, or detention for three to six months. The
article in question is invoked by the bodies which conduct initial inquiries and falls
within the competence of the public order militia.

Under the law of the Russian Federation, persons who, when crossing the State
border of the Russian Federation, are found to be holding false papers or papers
belonging to another person are liable to prosecution for illegally crossing the State
border of the Russian Federation, and the false papers or papers belonging to another
person are conﬁscated and kept as material evidence for a prosecution. This oﬀence
is established by article 322 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation; the
penalties established for oﬀenders are a ﬁne or imprisonment for up to ﬁve years.
Cases arising under this article are investigated by the bodies of the Russian Federal
Border Service which are responsible for initial inquiries. While awaiting trial,
oﬀenders are held in short-term remand units of the Russian Federal Border Service
and remand units of the Russian Federal Security Service.
Foreign nationals and stateless persons are expelled from the Russian Federation
after serving their sentences, according to the procedure established by law.
Subparagraph 3 (d)
—
Please explain how the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism
which have been ratiﬁed by the Russian Federation are incorporated into its domestic
laws.
Article 15, paragraph 4, of the Constitution of the Russian Federation states that the
commonly recognized principles and norms of international law and the international
treaties of the Russian Federation shall be a component part of its legal system. If an
international treaty of the Russian Federation establishes principles which diﬀer from
those stipulated in domestic law, the principles of the international treaty shall apply.
Domestic law is brought into line with the provisions of the international treaties of
the Russian Federation through the drafting and adoption of appropriate federal laws.
Subparagraph 3 (e)
—
Please inform the CTC of the progress of the ratiﬁcation process of the remaining
two universal instruments on terrorism.
On 14 June 2002, the State Duma adopted the Federal Act ‘On ratiﬁcation of the
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999)’.
The preparation process for ratiﬁcation of the Convention on the Marking of Plastic
Explosives for the Purpose of Detection (1991), which has been signed by the Russian
Federation, is at an advanced stage.
—
Are all the oﬀences set forth in the relevant international conventions and protocols
included as extraditable oﬀences in the bilateral treaties to which the Russian
Federation is party?
The provisions of bilateral international treaties of the Russian Federation governing
extradition issues do not contain any lists of extraditable criminal oﬀences. As a rule, the
parties recognize as extraditable oﬀences those for which the established punishment is
imprisonment for a period of at least one year or a more serious punishment. Under
current Russian law, terrorist oﬀences belong precisely to this category of oﬀence.

Paragraph 4
— Has the Russian Federation addressed any of the concerns expressed in paragraph 4
of the resolution?
Given that the concerns under consideration are becoming increasingly pressing, a
number of internal aﬀairs bodies in the units of the Russian Federation have set up
special oﬃces and departments for the detection of terrorist acts. Such sub departments
are already operating in the Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs of the Republic of Dagestan,
the Stavropol territory and the Moscow region. In the remaining sub departments there
are sections, branches and groups whose oﬃcial duties include the organization of
work to detect oﬀences connected with illicit arms traﬃcking and criminal explosions.
In order to focus information about persons and acts of a terrorist complexion, the
Russian Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs operates relevant databases. Similar databases are
operated in the Ministries of Internal Aﬀairs and local internal aﬀairs oﬃces of the
units of the Russian Federation.
Joint conferences and working meetings have been held—involving the responsible
oﬃcials of sub departments of the Organized Crime Division of the Russian Ministry
of Internal Aﬀairs, the relevant internal aﬀairs oﬃces of the city of Moscow and the
Moscow region, and the Moscow air and sea transport internal aﬀairs oﬃce—on the
subject of developing joint action to combat illicit traﬃcking in arms, ammunition,
explosives and explosive devices, and to combat criminal explosions and terrorism.
Representatives of the Federal Security Service, the State Customs Committee and the
Federal Service of Tax Police of the Russian Federation were invited to these events.
In 2001, the centres for forensic expertise of the Russian Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs
and similar subdepartments of the internal aﬀairs bodies of the units of the Russian
Federation held courses and seminars for oﬃcials from criminal intelligence units,
oﬃcials responsible for combating organized crime, transport police oﬃcers and foren-
sic experts, on the subject of using the results of explosives tests in the detection and
investigation of criminal explosions and terrorist acts.
Cooperation has been organized between criminal intelligence units and the subde-
partments of the Russian Federal Security Service on matters relating to the detection,
documenting and exposure of the criminal activities of groups and individual terrorists
and the supposed channels for funds and supplies of weapons. In collaboration with
the National Central Bureau of the International Criminal Police Organization (Inter-
pol), the Russian Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs has checked a number of reports on
groups of ﬁghters from international terrorist organizations and channels for ﬁnancial
assistance and is collecting analytical information on radical Muslim organizations.
Information on persons and organizations involved in terrorist activities is passed on
to the relevant services.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs has submitted proposals to the Oﬃce of
the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation regarding consideration by the
Council of Heads of Government of CIS Member States of the issue of setting up
a single database on seized and conﬁscated weapons, ammunition and explosives,
and the issue of inter-agency exchange of intelligence information on transnational
groupings and illicit traﬃcking in armaments.
The criminal intelligence units of the Russian internal aﬀairs bodies are working on
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
205
 

an ongoing basis to obtain information on terrorist threats, including threats against
foreign nationals, and on ethnic criminal groups and extremist elements which are
planning to commit terrorist acts and obtain arms, ammunition, explosives and
explosive devices.
On 28 September 2001, the Russian Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs held a working
meeting with the heads of criminal intelligence from the Ministries of Internal Aﬀairs
of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, the
Criminal Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs of Kazakhstan and
the Criminal Police Oﬃce of the Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs of Moldova on the status
of cooperation between the Ministries of Internal Aﬀairs of the CIS Member States
regarding the detection of especially serious oﬀences, searches for criminals, information
exchange, and measures to strengthen such cooperation.
Measures have recently been taken to revitalize special operations designed to seize
arms, ammunition and explosives from illicit traﬃc and arrest persons who use them
when committing oﬀences.
In the ﬁeld of criminal intelligence, three large-scale and 137 regional strategical-
preventive ‘Arsenal’ operations were organized and carried out in 1999–2001, resulting
in the following seizures from illicit traﬃc: 20,501 ﬁrearms, including 2,313 with a riﬂed
barrel, 1,787 grenades and mines, more than 364,000 cartridges of various calibres and
more than two tonnes of explosives. Some 76 such operations were carried out in 2001
alone.
Measures have been taken to reinforce canine units. The number of specialist dog-
handlers with sniﬀer dogs trained to detect explosives increased from 551 in 1999 to
937 in 2001. With their help, more than 1.6 tonnes of explosives and 495 explosive
devices were detected and conﬁscated in 2001. In conjunction with the sub departments
of the Russian Federal Security Service, command-post exercises, special tactical exer-
cises and training are being carried out on cooperation between forces and the pooling
of resources involved in operations to arrest armed criminals; free hostages from build-
ings, means of transport and aircraft; and repel attacks and prevent terrorist acts
directed at strategically important sights. For example, in St. Petersburg in 2000, the
subdepartments of the Russian Federal Security Service and the local internal aﬀairs
oﬃces of the city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region conducted joint exercises
on developing cooperation between security and internal aﬀairs bodies when oﬀences
of a terrorist nature, in particular hostage-taking, are committed.
Similar command-post exercises took place in Karachaevo-Cherkessia in 2001. One
of the most important areas of action to combat terrorism—as is the case for any other
type of oﬀence, is the detection of terrorist acts committed and the investigation of
and arrest of the perpetrators. The closest cooperation in this regard is that between
the Federal Security Service and the Ministry of Internal Aﬀairs of the Russian
Federation.
In order to improve coordination and strengthen action against international terror-
ism, the Russian Federation, together with the other member States of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization, is playing an active role in the establishment of the Organ-
ization’s regional anti-terrorist structure. In addition, the issues mentioned above are
systematically discussed at meetings of the Russian Federation-Council of Europe
expert working group, the Council of Europe Multidisciplinary Group on Inter-
national Action against Terrorism and the Rome and Lyon groups of the Group of

1.2. It is stated on the one hand in the reply to subparagraph 1 (c) on the question of
freezing funds, etc., inter alia, that investigative and judicial bodies when they are carrying
out international investigative requests in accordance with international agreements could
decide to freeze accounts and on the other articles 115 and 116 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure provide for the possibility of attaching the accounts of both individual citizens
and organizations for criminal cases being tried which involve terrorism and other related
oﬀences (page 4 of the supplementary report). It is not clear therefore whether the
investigative authorities in the Russian Federation could decide to freeze assets of those
individuals and entities, both residents and non-residents, suspected of having links with
terrorism without any case being instituted in a court against the concerned individuals
and entities. The CTC would be grateful for an explanation of the relevant provisions of
law in this regard.
In accordance with Act No. 115 of the Russian Federation of 7 August 2001, ‘On the
prevention of the legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (moneylaundering)
and the ﬁnancing of terrorism’, operations involving money or other assets are subject
to mandatory control if even one of the parties involved is an organization or a physi-
cal person which, according to evidence obtained in accordance with this Federal Act,
has participated in extremist activities, or a legal person which directly or indirectly
owns or is under the control of such an organization.
The procedure for establishing a list of organizations carrying out operations involv-
ing money or other assets and bringing it to the attention of those organizations and
persons is determined by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Grounds for the inclusion of an organization or physical person in that list are:
— A decision by a court of the Russian Federation which has entered into force
abolishing, or banning the activities of, an organization in connection with its
extremist activities;
—
A judgement of a court of the Russian Federation which has entered into force that
a physical person is guilty of a criminal oﬀence related to terrorism;
—
A decision of the Public Prosecutor of the Russian Federation or a prosecutor
appointed by him to suspend the activities of an organization in connection with
an appeal before the court stating that the organization is responsible for terrorist
activities;
—
A decision of an investigator or prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings
against a person who has committed a crime of a terrorist nature;
—
Lists of organizations and physical persons connected with terrorist organizations
or terrorists compiled by international organizations involved in combating terror-
ism, or by their subsidiary organs, which are recognized by the Russian Federation;
—
Judgements (decisions) of courts and decisions of other competent organs of for-
eign States recognized in the Russian Federation in accordance with international
agreements to which the Russian Federation is a party and with Federal laws
regarding organizations or physical persons involved in terrorist activities.
Organizations conducting operations involving money or other assets shall suspend
such operations, with the exception of operations to enter money deposited in the
account of a physical or legal person, within two working days of the date on which
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
208
 
www.ebook3000.com

the client had requested that the operations should be carried out, and no later than
one working day following the date on which the operations were suspended they shall
present information on those operations to the competent organ in the event that one
of the parties is an organization or a physical person which, according to evidence
obtained in accordance with this Federal Act, has participated in terrorist activities, or
a legal person which directly or indirectly owns or is under the control of such an
organization or person, whether a legal or a physical person, and is acting on behalf of
or on the order of, such an organization or person.
The competent organ (article 8 of the Act), appointed by the President of the
Russian Federation, is the Federal executive authority whose purposes, functions and
authority in the area of combating the legalization of funds attained by criminal
means (money-laundering) and the ﬁnancing of terrorism have been established in
accordance with this Federal Act.
Decree No. 263 of the President of the Russian Federation of 1 January 2001 estab-
lished the Committee of the Russian Federation for Financial Monitoring, which is the
Federal executive organ authorized to take measures to combat the legalization of
funds obtained by criminal means (money-laundering) and to coordinate the activities
of the Federal executive organs in this area. By resolution No. 211 of 2 April 2002, the
Government of the Russian Federation conﬁrmed the establishment of the Committee
of the Russian Federation for Financial Monitoring.
Given suﬃcient grounds indicating that an operation or transaction is linked to the
legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (money-laundering) or the ﬁnancing
of terrorism, the competent organ shall transmit the relevant information and material
to the law enforcement organs according to their areas of competence (as stated in
Federal Act No. 131 of 30 October 2002).
The competent organ shall issue a decision suspending operations involving money
or other assets within ﬁve working days, if the information it has received in accordance
with the Act, as a result of a preliminary examination, is recognized to be well-founded
(in accordance with Federal Act No. 131).
In accordance with article 10 (‘Exchange of information and legal assistance’) of
Act No. 115 of the Russian Federation of 7 August 2001 ‘On the prevention of the
legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (money-laundering) and the ﬁnan-
cing of terrorism’, State organs of the Russian Federation involved in the prevention
of the legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (moneylaundering) and the
ﬁnancing of terrorism, in accordance with international agreements to which the
Russian Federation is a party shall cooperate with the competent organs of foreign
States in that area including at the stage of the preliminary investigation.
State organs of the Russian Federation involved in activities connected with the
prevention of the legalization of funds obtained by criminal means (moneylaundering)
and the ﬁnancing of terrorism, in accordance with international agreements to which
the Russian Federation is a party and Federal law, shall (within the limits of their
competence) comply with requests from the competent organs of foreign States
concerning the conﬁscation of funds obtained by criminal means which are used for
the ﬁnancing of terrorism, and concerning various procedural matters relating to the
detection of funds obtained by criminal means and the ﬁnancing of terrorism, the
attachment of property and the freezing of assets, and shall provide expertise, interro-
gate suspects, witnesses, victims and other persons, conduct searches and seizures,
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
209
 

transmit material evidence, attach property, serve summonses and transmit documents
(in accordance with Federal Act No. 131). Thus, the investigative organs of the Russian
Federation may take decisions to freeze the accounts of individuals or organizations,
both residents and non-residents, suspected of having links with terrorism, without any
criminal case having been instituted against them, while conducting interrogations or
providing legal assistance.
In accordance with article 146 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian
Federation, criminal proceedings may be instituted by investigating oﬃcials with the
agreement of the prosecutor, and also by the prosecutor. The courts do not have the
right to institute criminal proceedings.
The provisions of articles 115, 166 and 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of
the Russian Federation concerning the procedure for the attachment of property and
securities govern the pre-trial procedure in criminal cases in the territory of the
Russian Federation unless, in accordance with article 2, paragraph 1, of the Code, an
international agreement to which the Russian Federation is a party states otherwise.
In accordance with the international agreements to which the Russian Federation is
a party and federal laws, judgements (decisions) of the courts of foreign States, which
have entered into force, regarding persons possessing funds obtained by criminal
means are recognized.
In accordance with international agreements to which the Russian Federation is a
party, judgements (decisions) of the courts of foreign States, which have entered into
force, regarding the conﬁscation of funds obtained by criminal means or assets of
equivalent value are recognized and enforced.
Funds obtained by criminal means or assets of equivalent value which have been
conﬁscated may be transmitted in full or in part to the foreign State whose court
handed down the decision regarding conﬁscation, in accordance with the relevant
international agreement to which the Russian Federation is a party.
1.3. The CTC would be grateful to be informed whether the Federal Act No. 152289–3 on
the introduction of amendments and additions to the Federal Act ‘On measures to combat
terrorism’ received the assent of the State Duma and has become an enforceable law.
Draft Federal Act No. 152289–3 on the introduction of amendments and additions to
the Federal Act ‘On measures to combat terrorism’ (relating to operational informa-
tion and compensation for losses caused by terrorist acts), in connection with the
adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1373 (2001), was voted down by the
State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on 11 April 2003, by
its resolution No. 3880–111.
1.4. It is stated in the supplementary report (page 5) that the Russian Federation Law
does not contain legal rules governing alternative money transfer mechanisms. How does
the Russian Federation then propose to regulate illegal and clandestine transfer through
mechanisms such as Hawala?
Under the law of the Russian Federation, illegal and clandestine money transfer mech-
anisms such as Hawala can constitute oﬀences as unlawful business activities (article 171
of the Criminal Code) or unlawful banking activities (article 172 of the Criminal Code).
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

Article 172 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation establishes criminal
liability for the carrying out of banking activities (banking operations) without
registration or the necessary licence, or contrary to the conditions under which the
licence was issued (where serious loss is suﬀered or considerable income is derived).
Article 15.26 of the Code on administrative oﬀences establishes administrative liability
for breaking the law on banks and banking activities
1.5. It is stated in reply to subparagraph 1 (d) (at page 6) in the supplementary report
that lawyers and other ﬁnancial intermediaries are not required to report suspicious
transactions as required by the Federal Act No. 115. Article 18 of the Convention for the
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism requires that other professions involved in
ﬁnancial transactions also pay attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and report
suspicious transactions stemming from a criminal activity. As the Russian Federation has
become a party to the Convention, how does the Russian Federation propose to meet this
requirement of the Convention?
In accordance with the requirements of article 18 of the International Convention for
the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, persons professionally involved in
ﬁnancial transactions are also required to pay attention to unusual or suspicious
transactions, and to report on suspicious transactions stemming from criminal sources.
The Russian Federation is a party to that Convention. It has discussed with representa-
tives of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) the issue of
expanding the list of bodies and individuals required to report suspicious ﬁnancial
transactions to the appropriate organ.
In order to further improve Russian legislation to combat money-laundering, pro-
posals are being prepared to introduce amendments and additions to the corresponding
law on the monitoring of the activities of ﬁnancial intermediaries, obliging them to
report to the competent organ any unusual or suspicious transactions.
In January 2003, Federal Act No. 115 was amended to extend its application to
organizations which provide gambling services (totalizators, betting oﬃces, lotteries
and prize draws), buy and sell precious metals and stones, or manage investment funds
or non-State pension funds. As a result of these amendments, when one or more par-
ties to a transaction are known to be involved in extremist activities, credit institutions
may refuse to open an account or conduct a transaction if a physical or legal person
has not provided the necessary identiﬁcation or other information. The law directs the
credit institutions to report suspicious transactions or those subject to compulsory
monitoring to the Committee of the Russian Federation for Financial Monitoring.
Article 7 of the aforementioned Act obliges the reporting organizations to identify
the physical or legal persons on whose instructions they carry out transactions; to
collect detailed information on transactions which are subject to mandatory controls
and communicate this information to the Committee of the Russian Federation for
Financial Monitoring within one working day from the date of the transaction; to
provide information to the Committee of the Russian Federation for Financial Moni-
toring in response to written enquiries; and establish rules for internal monitoring and
appoint oﬃcials responsible for ensuring compliance with those rules. The Act also
requires that the internal monitoring rules should include a procedure to ensure
that important information is recorded, provide for the protection of conﬁdentiality,
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
211
 

establish the requirements in terms of qualiﬁcations for the preparation and training of
staﬀ and determine the criteria for the detection of unusual transactions. The internal
monitoring rules are worked out on the basis of recommendations adopted by the
Central Bank of the Russian Federation (in the case of credit institutions) and by the
Government of the Russian Federation (in the case of other reporting organizations).
Moreover, Russian legislation, in accordance with the recommendations of FATF,
requires that reports should be submitted when large currency transactions take place in
excess of a given sum. The Russian Federation uses a system of reporting on large cash
transactions. Article 6 of Federal Act No. 115 requires reporting organizations to submit
to the Committee of the Russian Federation for Financial Monitoring information on
transactions to the value of 600,000 roubles (approximately 16,700 or US$ 19,300 at
May 2003 rates) which involve: a cash deposit to or withdrawals from the account of a
legal person in circumstances which do not correspond to the nature of its economic
activity; the purchase or sale of cash sums in foreign currency; the acquisition of
securities for cash; the cashing of a cheque to the bearer which has been issued by a
non-resident; the changing of banknotes of one denomination for banknotes of a
diﬀerent denomination; or cash payments into the core capital of a legal person.
There are currently a number of supervisory organs which are responsible for ensur-
ing that reporting organizations which come under their authority comply with the
requirements of the Act in terms of preventing money-laundering and the ﬁnancing of
terrorism.
The Central Bank is responsible for the supervision of credit institutions (banks).
The Insurance Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Finance is responsible for
monitoring insurance companies and organizations which manage non-State pension
funds. The Assay Oﬃce of the Ministry of Finance monitors organizations which buy
and sell precious metals and stones, and the Ministry of Communications is respon-
sible for monitoring post oﬃces. The Federal Securities Commission of the Russian
Federation bears the responsibility for the monitoring of professional members of the
securities market. The Committee of the Russian Federation for Financial Monitoring
monitors pawnshops, leasing companies and gambling services.
1.6. It is not clear from the reply given to the question on subparagraph 2 (e) at page 14
of the supplementary report that a foreign national accused of a terrorist oﬀence commit-
ted outside the territory of the Russian Federation when found in Russian Federation
territory will be tried in the Russian Federation if, for some reason, the person is not
extradited. The CTC would be content to know the legal position in this regard.
As a party to the main international counter-terrorism conventions, the Russian
Federation adheres to the principle whereby it establishes its jurisdiction over terrorist
crimes in cases where those who have committed such crimes are in its territory; it does
not hand them over to any other State party. Criminal legal action in respect of per-
sons who have committed crimes outside the territory of the Russian Federation is
governed by article 12 of the Criminal Code. Under paragraph 3 of that article, if a
foreign national or stateless person not living permanently in the Russian Federation
has committed a crime outside the territory of the Russian Federation, that person is
subject to criminal penalties under the Code in cases where the oﬀence was directed
against the interests of the Russian Federation and in the cases provided for under an
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

international agreement to which the Russian Federation is a party, if the oﬀender has
not been sentenced in a foreign country and is criminally liable in the territory of the
Russian Federation.
1.7. The CTC would be grateful for a progress report on the ratiﬁcation of the one
remaining convention by the Russian Federation.
Preparations are being completed for the ratiﬁcation of the 1991 Convention on
the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, which the Russian
Federation has signed. The draft documents necessary for its submission to the Federal
Assembly of the Russian Federation for ratiﬁcation are currently being prepared.
1.8. The CTC would be content to know whether all the acts in the International
Instruments related to the Prevention and Suppression of International Terrorism have
been included as oﬀences under the relevant laws of the Russian Federation.
A new article 205–1 was added to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation by
means of a Federal Act of 24 June 2002. This article establishes liability for involve-
ment in the commission of an oﬀence of a terrorist nature or the provision of other
assistance in its commission. The provisions of the article deal with highly dangerous
acts: the recruitment and ﬁnancing of terrorists, and other oﬀences which are dealt with
as criminal oﬀences in international conventions on the prevention and suppression of
international terrorism.
1.9. The CTC is aware that the Russian Federation may have covered some or all of the
points in the preceding paragraphs in reports or questionnaires submitted to other organ-
izations involved in monitoring international standards. The CTC would be content to
receive a copy of any such report or questionnaire as part of the Russian Federation’s
response to these matters as well as details of any eﬀorts to implement international
best practice, codes and standards which are relevant to the implementation of resolution
1373 (2001).
Annexed to this document is a copy of the responses of the Russian Federation con-
cerning its compliance with the Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing of
FATF, which were submitted to that organization in August 2002.

Report by the European Union to the Committee established under
paragraph 6 of Resolution 1373 (2001) adopted by the Security
Council at its 4385th meeting on 28 September 2001
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 calls upon all States to report within
90 days to the Committee established under the provisions of the Resolution on the
steps taken to implement the Resolution. The following constitutes a report submitted
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

by the European Union which covers actions taken within the framework of the Treaty
on the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community. It does
not cover actions undertaken by individual EU Member States (Belgium, Denmark,
Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria,
Portugal, Finland, Sweden, United Kingdom) outside this framework. It is therefore
complementary to the reports which EU Member States are required to submit in their
national capacity.
This report is set out according to the guidelines circulated by the Chairman of the
Committee established under UNSCR 1373.
On 10 December the Council of the European Union reached agreement on a
Common Position which provides for the application of speciﬁc measures in order to
combat terrorism. This instrument is a basis for many of the measures which are
foreseen as the European Union’s response to the provisions of UNSCR 1373.
1
(a) What measures if any have been taken to prevent and suppress the ﬁnancing of
terrorist acts in addition to those listed in response to questions on 1 (b) to (d)?
The Special Recommendations on terrorist ﬁnancing adopted at the Extra-
ordinary Plenary Meeting of the Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering on 29–30 October 2001 relate to a number of the issues covered
in Operative Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Resolution. It is intended that these
recommendations be at least partly implemented by measures taken within the
framework of the Treaty on European Union (EU) and the Treaty establishing
the European Community (EC).
1
(b) What are the oﬀences and penalties in your country with respect to the activities
listed in this subparagraph?
This is a matter for EU Member States.
1
(c) What legislation and procedures exist for freezing accounts and assets at banks
and ﬁnancial institutions? In the framework of restrictive measures against
third States established under articles 301 and 60 of the Treaty establishing the
EC, the Council adopted a Regulation on 6 March 2001 (Council Regulation
(EC) 467/2001) providing for the freezing of all funds and other ﬁnancial
resources belonging to any natural or legal person, entity or body designated by
the ‘Afghanistan Sanctions Committee’ (established under UNSCR 1267) and
listed in one of the annexes to the Regulation. As provided for under the terms
of the Regulation, the European Commission has on four occasions amended
the list annexed to the Regulation on the basis of decisions made either by the
UN Security Council or the Sanctions Committee, adding new persons and
entities to the list. The last three amendments target Osama bin Laden and the
Al Qaida network. In order to adapt to the wider scope of measures covered by
UNSCR 1373, and in order to be able to reach those persons who commit,
attempt to commit, participate in or facilitate terrorist acts, but are not linked
to any one State, the Council of the European Union, at its meeting on
10 December, reached agreement on a common position and a Regulation
which together constitute a legal requirement to freeze and withhold the avail-
ability of funds, other ﬁnancial assets and economic resources, to any previously
identiﬁed natural or legal person, group or entity ﬁguring in lists annexed to the
legislation. It is expected that this legislation will enter into force early in 2002.

1
(d) What measures exist to prohibit the activities listed in this sub-paragraph?
These are covered in part by the response under point 1(c). In addition, existing
legislation (in the form of a Council Directive (91/308/EEC, adopted in 1991)
aims to prevent the use of the ﬁnancial system for money laundering. Its
provisions include an obligation on ﬁnancial institutions to maintain appropri-
ate records and to establish money-laundering programmes. It also provides
for the suspension of banking secrecy when necessary and an obligation to
report suspicious transactions to reporting authorities. The 1991 Directive was
amended on 19 November 2001. The new directive extends the prohibition
of money laundering to most organised and serious crime. It also extends the
coverage of the earlier directive to include a number of non-ﬁnancial activities
and professions which are vulnerable to misuse by money launderers. The EU
Member States have agreed that all oﬀences linked to the ﬁnancing of terrorism
constitute a serious crime under the directive.
2
(a) What legislation or other measures are in place to give eﬀect to this sub-
paragraph? In particular, what oﬀences in your country prohibit (i) recruitment
to terrorist groups and (ii) the supply of weapons to terrorists? What other
measures help prevent such activities? Measures aimed at prohibiting the supply
of weapons to terrorists are covered by a Council Directive (91/477/EEC) of
1991 on the control of the acquisition and possession of weapons. This imposes
a number of obligations on EU Member States, including the requirement
to ensure that those acquiring or possessing ﬁrearms are not likely to be a
danger to public order or safety. The directive also prohibits the acquisition
and possession of certain types of ﬁrearms. On 16 October 2001, the Council
adopted a decision authorising the signature of the UN Protocol on the illicit
manufacturing of and traﬃcking in ﬁrearms, their parts, components and
ammunition (annexed to the Convention against transnational organised crime)
on behalf of the European Community. This paves the way for implementation
of those aspects of the Protocol which are subject to Community competence.
The EU Code of Conduct on the exports of military equipment is an important
tool in minimising the risk of European armaments being diverted to terrorist
organisations. Further security is provided through the Council Regulation
(EC) No 1334/2000 of 22 June 2000 governing dual use goods. The European
Union has more generally been reconsidering its relations with third countries
in the light of the stand taken by those countries in combatting terrorism. On
17 October 2001, the Council adopted an objective set of indicators in order
to help the EU to evaluate systematically its relations with third countries. The
EU is undertaking a review of its relations with third countries in the light of
this evaluation.
2
(b) What other steps are being taken to prevent the commission of terrorist acts,
and in particular, what early warning mechanisms exist to allow exchange
of information with other states? At its meeting on 20 September 2001, the
Council agreed on a number of measures to intensify information exchange
between EU Member States. These include regular meetings of the heads of
Member States’ anti-terrorist units, as well as of their intelligence agencies.
Cooperation between EU Member States and Europol has also been stepped
up, and includes the detachment of anti-terrorist specialists from Member
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

States to work within Europol. The Council decision on 6 December 2001 to
make Eurojust fully operational will also facilitate the exchange of operational
information. (See under point 2 (e) below.)
2
(c) What legislation or procedures exist for denying safe haven to terrorists, such as
laws for excluding or expelling the types of individuals referred to in this sub-
paragraph? Article 23(1) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agree-
ment, which forms part of EC law, provides that aliens who do not fulﬁl or who no
longer fulﬁl the conditions applicable within the territory of a Member State
bound by the Schengen Agreement shall normally be required to leave the
Schengen Territory immediately. When departure is not voluntary, or if the
immediate departure of the alien is necessary for reasons of national security or
public order, removal is to be carried out in accordance with the national law of
the Member State in which the person was apprehended. Harmonisation of
legislation in this area should take place in the context of the Council Directive
(2001/40/EC) of 28 May 2001 on the mutual recognition of decisions on the
expulsion of third-country nationals, the aim of which is to ensure more eﬀect-
ive enforcement of these measures and better cooperation between EU Member
States.
2
(d) What legislation or procedures exist to prevent terrorists acting from your terri-
tory against other states or citizens? In addition to the measures given in response
under 2 (b), the Schengen Information (computer) System (SIS) oﬀers several
possibilities for preventing terrorists from using the territories of the EU Member
States. Eﬀorts are being made to improve the use of the SIS. For example: the
authorities will encourage the introduction of warnings by default, and national
warnings fulﬁlling the criteria for introduction into the SIS will be introduced as
automatically as possible and should not require any additional operation from
the initiating authority. In addition, the consultations foreseen about warnings
on persons for the purposes of discreet surveillance will be simpliﬁed. At
Europol, a task force composed of twenty specialists on anti-terrorism was
created at short notice after 11 September and is now fully operational.
2
(e) What steps have been taken to establish terrorist acts as serious criminal oﬀences
and to ensure that the punishment reﬂects the seriousness of such terrorist acts?
On 6 December 2001, the Council reached political agreement on a Framework
Decision on combating terrorism. This legislation includes a common deﬁnition
of various types of terrorist oﬀences and serious criminal sanctions. The legal
text will be adopted shortly, and EU Member States have until the end of 2002
to implement the measures in their own criminal law. Political agreement has
also been reached on a framework decision for a European arrest warrant. This
is designed to supplant the current procedures of extradition between EU
Member States and enable wanted persons to be surrendered to judicial author-
ities in other EU Member States without veriﬁcation of the double criminality
of the act for a wide range of oﬀences, subject to agreed swift judicial review
procedures. On 6 December 2001, the Council reached political agreement on a
text setting up the judicial cooperation unit Eurojust. Its objective is to improve
and encourage cooperation between the competent national authorities, in
particular by facilitating mutual legal assistance and the implementation of
extradition requests.

2
(f) What procedures and mechanisms are in place to assist other states? See
response given under 2 (d) above.
2
(g) How do border controls in your country prevent the movement of terrorists?
How do your procedures for issuance of identity papers and travel documents
support this? What measures exist to prevent their forgery etc? An Early Warning
System was established by Council Resolution of 11 May 1999 for the transmis-
sion of information on illegal immigration and facilitator networks. This system
is available to both EU Member States and candidate countries, and has been
used increasingly since 11 September 2001. A uniform format for visas issued
by EU Member States is required by a Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95
of 29 May 1995. It provides for procedures and speciﬁcations to prevent the
production and use of counterfeit or false visas.
3
(a) What steps have been taken to intensify and accelerate the exchange of oper-
ational information in the areas indicated in this sub-paragraph? See response
given under 2 (b) above. In addition, existing EC legislation regulating data
protection provides for ﬂexibility in the exchange of information where this
contributes to the ﬁght against terrorism.
3
(b) What steps have been taken to exchange information and cooperate in the
areas indicated in this subparagraph? The European Union is intensifying its
cooperation speciﬁcally with the United States in these areas. Following the
events of 11 September 2001, the United States submitted to the EU Strategic
Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum, at a joint meeting on
26 October 2001, proposals for cooperation in border control and migration
management. These proposals are currently under examination.
3
(c) What steps have been taken to cooperate in the areas indicated in this sub-
paragraph? In addition to the measures set out under 2 (b), the Council has
taken a number of steps to enhance EU cooperation with third countries. High
level contacts have led in particular to a stepping up of law enforcement and
judicial cooperation between the EU and US. On 6 December 2001 an agree-
ment was signed which provides for cooperation and the exchange of non-
personal information between Europol and the US, and negotiations have
begun on an agreement on the exchange of personal data. Speciﬁc emphasis has
been given to using the provisions in existing bilateral agreements to step up
cooperation on counter-terrorism. More generally, the European Commission
is examining the European Community’s external aid programmes, budget lines
and country strategies to establish what further assistance might be provided
within the framework of the EC’s existing assistance programmes. The EC is
already providing assistance to a number of third countries in areas such as
governance and the reinforcement of judicial and legal systems.
3
(d) What are your intentions regarding the signing and/or ratifying the conventions
and protocols referred to in this sub-paragraph? All EU Member States have
now signed the Convention on the Suppression of terrorism ﬁnancing.
3
(e) Provide any relevant information on the implementation of the conventions,
protocols and resolutions referred to in this sub-paragraph? The EU has been
promoting actively the signature and ratiﬁcation by all States of all the UN
conventions on terrorism (in particular the Convention on the Suppression of
terrorism ﬁnancing), as well as the completion of the negotiations on the draft
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

Comprehensive Convention on international terrorism. It has in particular
taken advantage of all its political dialogue meetings with third countries, where
terrorism now regularly features on the agenda, so as to address with those
countries the speciﬁc issue of the terrorism conventions.
3
(f) What legislation, procedures and mechanisms are in place for ensuring asylum
seekers have not been involved in terrorist activity before granting refugee
status?
The EU Council focused its work on the proposal for a Council Directive
on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and
withdrawing refugee status. At its meeting on 6 and 7 December 2001, the
Council adopted conclusions on this matter and took note of the Commission’s
intention to present a modiﬁed proposal. The Council also pursued its work
concerning the proposal for a Council Directive laying down minimum stand-
ards for the reception of applicants for asylum in EU Member States and the
proposal for a Council Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for
determining the EU Member State responsible for examining an asylum appli-
cation lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national. This
Regulation will replace the 1990 Dublin Convention between EU Member
States.
Existing EC instruments in the ﬁeld of asylum all contain standard provisions
to allow persons thought to be terrorists or to pose a terrorist threat to be
excluded from the right to international protection and residency or denied
access to certain beneﬁts.
3
(g) What procedures are in place to prevent the abuse of refugee status by terrorists?
See the response given under 3 (f) above.

Supplementary report by the European Union to the Committee
established under paragraph 6 of Security Council Resolution
1373 (2001)
On 28 December 2001 the European Union submitted its report on the implementa-
tion of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) to the Committee
established by the Security Council—the Counter Terrorism Committee. In a letter
dated 10 June 2002, the Counter Terrorism Committee requested clariﬁcation of some
aspects of the report. In the following supplementary report the European Union seeks
to provide the requested clariﬁcations.
As the ﬁrst report the supplementary report covers actions taken within the frame-
work of the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty Establishing the European
Community and not actions undertaken by individual Member States outside this
framework.

Review of the European Union of its relations with third countries in light of the stand
taken by those countries in combating terrorism (Sub-paragraph 2 a):
As set out in the ﬁrst report the European Union is reconsidering its relations with
third countries in the light of the stand taken by those countries in combating terrorism.
To this end, the European Union has initiated a systematic evaluation of its relations
with third countries. On the basis of the evaluation the Council considers whether
any operational measures should be taken in relation to third countries, which could
encompass cooperation and political dialogue, technical assistance, inclusion of terror-
ism clauses in agreements with the country in question etc. The European Union is still
in the process of reviewing its relations with third countries.
The Seville European Council of 21–22 June 2002 conﬁrmed the inclusion of counter-
terrorism clauses in agreements with third countries as an important instrument to be
used by the European Union in encouraging eﬀective policies to ﬁght terrorism in
other parts of the world.45 An understanding has been reached on a standard wording
to be used in such clauses. However, several agreements concluded prior to this also
include relevant provisions: EU agreements with Croatia, Egypt and FYROM thus
contain nonstandard provisions on counter-terrorism. Owing to agreements already
being in force, joint declarations addressing the issue of terrorism have moreover been
adopted or are under discussion with Canada, India, Japan, Pakistan and South
Korea. The standard wording for counter-terrorism clauses has already been used for
the counter-terrorism provisions in agreements with Algeria, Chile and Lebanon, and
is envisaged as the basis for other agreements to be concluded.
The wording used in agreements with Algeria, Chile and Lebanon sets out the obli-
gations of the Parties, ﬁrst of all by reaﬃrming the importance of the ﬁght against
terrorism. It is intended that thanks to the clause, better co-operation in the prevention
and suppression of acts of terrorism in accordance with international conventions and
with the Parties’ respective legislation and regulations can be achieved. In particular,
the agreements foresee co-operation in the framework of the full implementation of
Resolution 1373 and other relevant UN resolutions, international conventions and
instruments, by the exchange of information on terrorist groups and their support
networks in accordance with international and national law, by the exchange of views
on means and methods used to counter terrorism, including in technical ﬁelds and
training, and by the exchange of experiences in respect of terrorism prevention.
In practical terms, the clause makes it possible to address the issue of counter-
terrorism in a focused way for the beneﬁt of both Parties to the agreement.
The Danish Presidency plans to improve the evaluation of relations with third coun-
tries, in particular as regards the ﬁght against terrorism, in order to make best use of
the counter-terrorism clause as a tool in existing agreements or in the negotiation
of possible future agreements.
Proposals to consider European Union co-operation and exchange of information on
counter-terrorism measures with member countries of the United Nations other than

the United States and with international specialized or regional organizations
(Subparagraph 3):
In addition to negotiating an agreement on judicial co-operation in criminal matters
(mutual legal assistance/extradition) with the United States, the European Union is
interested in developing judicial co-operation with a number of other countries and
through international organisations. The objective of improving judicial cooperation is
included in Action Plans with Russia and the Ukraine, where the next step is to estab-
lish judicial contact points for exchange of information. The Joint Statement between
the European Union and Canada on combating terrorism highlighted the importance
of enhancing judicial co-operation, and similar joint declarations have been adopted
with other countries (see also the reply to the question concerning counter-terrorism
clauses). Moreover, Eurojust, the European judicial cooperation Unit, which was for-
mally created in March of this year, will be able to conclude cooperation agreements
with third countries.
Furthermore Europol can—in accordance with the Europol Convention—establish
and maintain co-operation with third States and third bodies. Against this background
Europol has concluded a number of co-operation agreements with third States and
third bodies, including agreements providing for the exchange of personal data.
With regard to co-operation with international organizations, the EU is actively
involved in the work of the OSCE, the implementation of the action plan of the
Ministers of the Council of Europe and the work of the Multi-Disciplinary Working
Group on Terrorism. The European Union is also developing close cooperation on
counter-terrorism with its partners in the biregional cooperation between the EU
and Latin America/the Caribbean, ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting), ARF (the ASEAN
Regional Forum), the Barcelona process, the Centre for international crime prevention
in Vienna, etc. With regard to the co-operation with ASEM, it is intended to comprise
concrete actions aimed, inter alia, at the implementation of international instruments
such as Resolution 1373, and build on existing ASEM initiatives on transnational
organized crime and law enforcement matters, in areas such as the ﬁght against
corruption, money-laundering and traﬃcking in women and children.
Furthermore, as was emphasized by the European Council in Seville, providing third
countries with appropriate assistance for taking eﬀective action against international
terrorism is an important priority for the EU in its contribution to the global coalition
against terror, and to the worldwide implementation of Resolution 1373 in particular.46
As was stated by the European Union in its initial report to the Counter-Terrorism
Committee, extensive assistance is already being provided to many third countries in
the areas covered by Resolution 1373. Since the submission of the ﬁrst report, the
European Commission has examined its external assistance programmes in the light of
Resolution 1373 to establish what kind of assistance facilitating its implementation is
already being provided, and what further assistance is possible. An overview of the
results of this review was provided to the Counter-Terrorism Committee in March
2002 and has been integrated into the CTC’s directory of available assistance.

The European Union will continue to work closely with the CTC, notably with a view
to establishing how relevant assistance can be targeted most eﬀectively to facilitate
implementation of the Resolution.
Freezing of funds of designated persons and entities (Sub-paragraph 1c):
Since the submission of the ﬁrst EU report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee,
the Security Council has adopted Resolution 1390(2002) concerning Al Qaida and the
Taliban. The restrictions foreseen by that Resolution are such that in the Community
they require a legal base in addition to those mentioned in that report (Article 308 of
the EC Treaty). Following the adoption of Common Position 2002/402/CFSP47 and after
consultation of the European Parliament, Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 was
adopted on 27 May 2002 which repeals the sanctions of Regulation (EC) No 467/2001.
In line with Resolution 1390(2002), Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 freezes both funds
and economic resources, belonging to or owned by a natural or a legal person, group
or entity designated by the UN Sanctions Committee.
On the basis of decisions made by the UN Security Council or the Sanctions
Committee, the European Commission regularly updates the list of targeted persons,
groups and entities. The list was last updated on 3 June 2002.
As indicated in the ﬁrst report, the European Union adopted Common Position
2001/931/CFSP48 on 27 December 2001 which is an instrument of the EU’s Common
Foreign and Security Policy and of Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal
Matters. At the same time, the Council also adopted Regulation (EC) No 2580/200149
implementing the freezing measures foreseen in that Common Position. The Regulation
does not include freezing measures that may be applied by Member States in respect
of persons, groups and entities which are not subject to foreign policy measures.
Moreover, according to Common Position 2001/931/CFSP, Member States shall,
through police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, aﬀord each other the
widest possible assistance in preventing and combating terrorist acts.
As of 18 June 2002, the freezing measures of Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 apply
to 8 natural persons and 20 groups and entities. The list is set out in Decision 2002/460/
EC and is being kept under review.50
The list is established by the Council acting by unanimity. The criteria that have to

14. ASEAN eﬀorts to Counter Terrorism (5 November 2001)
Introduction
ASEAN Leaders, at their 7th Summit on 5 November 2001 in Brunei Darussalam,
adopted the 2001 ASEAN Declaration on Joint Action to Counter Terrorism. The
ASEAN Leaders viewed terrorism as a profound threat to international peace and
security and “ ‘a direct challenge to the attainment of peace, progress and prosperity of
ASEAN and the realization of ASEAN Vision 2020’ ”. They expressed commitment
to combat terrorism in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other
international laws and relevant UN resolutions. They also underlined that ‘cooperative
eﬀorts in this regard should consider joint practical counter-terrorism measures in line
with speciﬁc circumstances in the region and in each member country’.
They also identiﬁed speciﬁc measures for ASEAN to implement the Declaration,
namely:
•
Review and strengthen national mechanisms to combat terrorism;
•
Call for the early signing/ratiﬁcation of or accession to all relevant anti-terrorist
conventions including the International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism;
•
Deepen cooperation among ASEAN’s front-line law enforcement agencies in
combating terrorism and sharing “ ‘best practices’ ”;
51 Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism (2002/475/JHA), published in
Oﬃcial Journal of the European Communities No. L 164/3 of 22 June 2002.

•
Study relevant international conventions on terrorism with the view to integrating
them with ASEAN mechanisms on combating international terrorism;
•
Enhance information/intelligence exchange to facilitate the ﬂow of information, in
particular, on terrorists and terrorist organisations, their movement and funding,
and any other information needed to protect lives, property and the security of all
modes of travel;
•
Strengthen existing cooperation and coordination between the ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting on Transnational Crime (AMMTC) and other relevant ASEAN bodies
in countering, preventing and suppressing all forms of terrorist acts. Particular
attention would be paid to ﬁnding ways to combat terrorist organisations, support
infrastructure and funding and bringing the perpetrators to justice;
•
Develop regional capacity building programmes to enhance existing capabilities of
ASEAN member countries to investigate, detect, monitor and report on terrorist
acts;
•
Discuss and explore practical ideas and initiatives to increase ASEAN’s role in and
involvement with the international community including extra-regional partners
within existing frameworks such as the ASEAN + 3, the ASEAN Dialogue Partners
and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), to make the ﬁght against terrorism a
truly regional and global endeavour;
•
Strengthen cooperation at the bilateral, regional and international levels in combat-
ing terrorism in a comprehensive manner and aﬃrm that at the international level
the United Nations should play a major role in this regard.
The speciﬁc measures outlined in the Declaration have been incorporated in the
Terrorism component of the Work Programme to Implement the ASEAN Plan of
Action to Combat Transnational Crime adopted in May 2002. The Work Programme
is based along 6 strategic thrusts namely:
•
information exchange;
•
cooperation in legal matters;
•
cooperation in law enforcement matters;
•
institutional capacity building;
•
training; and
•
extra-regional cooperation.
ASEAN is also carrying out training programmes and projects in counter terrorism
in 2003, including on psychological operation/psychological warfare courses for law
enforcement authorities and on intelligence procuring. Courses on bomb/explosive
detection, post-blast investigation, airport security and passport/document security and
inspection are also planned. In addition, ASEAN focal points on counter-terrorism
have also been established.
Stage A:
Several ASEAN Member Countries have already become the party to some of
the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism. In the Work
Programme, ASEAN Member Countries are also urged towards an early signing or
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
225
 

ratiﬁcation of or accession to all relevant anti-terrorist conventions including the
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
As part of the Terrorism Component of the ASEAN Work Programme, ASEAN
Member Countries are now working toward the establishment of a regional database
for disseminating information on respective national laws, regulations, bilateral and
multilateral treaties or agreements of respective countries.
The Terrorism Component, in addressing the issue of prevention and suppression of
terrorist ﬁnancing, calls for the enhancement of information or intelligence exchange
to facilitate the ﬂow of information, in particular, on terrorists and terrorist organiza-
tions, their movement and funding, and any other information needed to protect lives,
property and the security of all modes of travel.
Stage B:
The Annual Conference of ASEAN Chiefs of Police (ASEANAPOL) held in
May 2002, called for a joint cooperation among the ASEANAPOL members in ﬁght-
ing terrorism. ASEAN Chiefs of Police are committed to developing capacity-building
initiatives to ensure that each ASEANAPOL member has the capacity to eﬀectively
monitor, share information on and combat all forms of terrorist activities. They also
agreed to enhance cooperation among law enforcement agencies through the sharing
of experiences on counter-terrorism and the exchange of information on suspected
terrorists, organizations and their modus operandi.
In addition, ASEAN immigration authorities have committed to assist and to coor-
dinate with the other ASEAN law enforcement authorities to prevent the movement of
terrorists or cross-border terrorism by working toward the establishment of intelligence
units in their respective agencies on the issues of traﬃcking in persons, human smuggling
and terrorism. They have also set up an ASEAN focal point directory for ASEAN
immigration authorities to exchange information.
Stage C:
In May 2002, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines signed the Agreement on
Information Exchange and Establishment of Communication Procedures to cooper-
ate among them to combat transnational crime, including terrorism. Thailand and
Cambodia have also acceded to the Agreement.
ASEAN senior oﬃcials are also looking at the possibility of a regional convention to
combat terrorism. In addition, several Member Countries within ASEAN are looking
at a regional Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement.
In terms of information exchange, the Work Programme has put in place a com-
prehensive information exchange mechanism to facilitate sharing of information and
analysis of critical intelligence information such as “ ‘modus operandi’ ” and oﬀences
involving terrorist activities. ASEAN is taking a comprehensive and coordinated
approach in tackling the various areas of transnational crimes that have links to
terrorism as the Work Programme also has components on traﬃcking in small arms,
illegal drug traﬃcking and money laundering.
In January 2003, ASEAN police and law enforcement oﬃcials agreed that each
ASEAN Member Country shall establish an anti-terrorism task force to strengthen
cooperation on counter-terrorism and to collaborate with the aﬀected ASEAN mem-
ber country following a terrorist attack. Such assistance requested can be in the form
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

of, but not limited to identifying, pursuing and apprehending suspects, examination of
witness(es), searching and seizing evidence, evacuating and treating of victims, forensic
and crime laboratory.
In terms of cooperation at the international and regional levels, ASEAN and China,
in November 2002, issued a Joint Declaration of ASEAN and China on Cooperation
in the Field of Non-Traditional Security Issues where counter-terrorism has been
included as one of the priorities for ASEAN-China cooperation.
ASEAN is cooperating with China, Japan and the Republic of Korea under the
ASEAN+3 process of East Asia cooperation to address the threats of terrorism and
transnational crimes. The ASEAN Ministers on Transnational Crime will start holding
joint consultations with their counterparts from China, Japan and the Republic of
Korea (the AMMTC+3) in Thailand this year.
At the 9th ministerial meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Bandar
Seri Begawan on 30 July 2002, the ARF Statement on Measures Against Terrorist
Financing was adopted. The ARF participating states and organization (the EU)
agreed on concrete steps that included: freezing terrorist assets, implementation of
international standards, cooperation on exchange of information and outreach, and
technical assistance.
The 9th ARF also agreed to establish the inter-sessional meeting on counter-terrorism
and transnational crimes (ISM-CT/TC), which will be co-chaired in the 2002–2003
year by Malaysia and the U.S.A. Malaysia plans to convene the ﬁrst meeting of the
ISM-CT/TC in Sabah in March 2003.
ASEAN and the U.S.A. signed the Joint Declaration for Cooperation to Combat
International Terrorism during the 35th AMM/PMC in Bandar Seri Begawan on
1 August 2002. One of the objectives of the cooperation is to prevent, disrupt and com-
bat international terrorism through the exchange and ﬂow of information, intelligence
and capacity-building assistance.
ASEAN and the E.U. issued the Joint Declaration on Cooperation to Combat
Terrorism at the end of the 14th ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting in Brussels on
28 January 2003. The Joint Declaration reiterated the commitment of the two sides to
work together and contribute to the global eﬀorts to stamp out terrorism.
In addition, some ASEAN member countries have entered into bilateral cooperation
arrangements with other countries outside the ASEAN region to enhance their cap-
ability in counter-terrorism. Malaysia and the U.S.A., for example, have established the
Regional Counter-terrorism Center in November 2002 in Kuala Lumpur. Indonesia and
Australia have formed the joint task force to investigate the Bali terrorist bomb blasts.

I am pleased to submit to the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee a report
on OSCE positions and activities with regard to resolution 1373 (2001) (see enclosure).
From the time of establishment of the OSCE (then CSCE), the organization has rec-
ognized the problem of terrorism and has paid increasing attention to it. These eﬀorts
cumulated at the Ninth Meeting of the Ministerial Council, held from 3 to 4 December
2001, at which a decision and a comprehensive plan of action for combating terrorism
were adopted (see appendix).
As part of this Plan of Action, I was instructed to provide this report: ‘The Secretary
General will, by 27 December 2001, report to the United Nations Counter-Terrorism
Committee on action on combating terrorism taken by the OSCE . . .’. Attached you
will ﬁnd the report, structured according to the format and guidance developed by the
Counter-Terrorism Committee (SCA/20/01(6)).
I am also happy to inform the Committee that from 13 to 14 December the
Bishkek International Conference on Enhancing Security and Stability in Central
Asia: Strengthening the Comprehensive Eﬀorts to Counter Terrorism took place
and adopted a Declaration, as well as a Programme of Action (attached). This
conference, convened at the invitation of Kyrgyzstan, was jointly organized by the
OSCE and UN ODCCP. Over 300 participants attended, representing 54 States,
including some non-OSCE countries, as well as international, regional and subregional
organizations and institutions. The success of this conference highlighted once more
the importance of a concerted multifaceted and comprehensive eﬀort in countering
terrorism.
I would like to request that the report be circulated as a document of the Security
Council.

4.
International terrorism, violent extremism, organized crime and drug traﬃcking
represent growing challenges to security. Whatever its motives, terrorism in all its
form and manifestations is unacceptable. We will enhance our eﬀorts to prevent
the preparation and ﬁnancing of any act of terrorism on our territories and
deny terrorists safe havens. The excessive and destabilizing accumulation and
uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons represent a threat to peace
and security. We are committed to strengthening our protection against these
new risks and challenges; strong democratic institutions and the rule of law are the
foundation for this protection. We are also determined to co-operate more actively
and closely with each other to meet these challenges.
(. . .)
Concluding Document of the Madrid Meeting
(11 November 1980 to 9 September 1983)
Principles
The participating States conﬁrm that they will refrain from direct or indirect assistance
to terrorist activities or to subversive or other activities directed towards the violent
overthrow of the regime of another participating State. Accordingly, they will refrain,
inter alia, from ﬁnancing, encouraging, fomenting or tolerating any such activities.

attack on the whole of the international community, and on people of every faith
and culture. These heinous deeds, as well as other terrorist acts in all forms and
manifestations, committed no matter when, where or by whom, are a threat to inter-
national and regional peace, security and stability. There must be no safe haven
for those perpetrating, ﬁnancing, harbouring or otherwise supporting those respon-
sible for such criminal acts. Terrorism, whatever its motivation or origin, has no
justiﬁcation.

Participating States: Will consider how the OSCE may draw upon best practices
and lessons learned from other relevant groups, organizations, institutions and
fora in areas such as police and judicial co-operation; prevention and suppression
of the ﬁnancing of terrorism; denial of other means of support; border controls
including visa and document security; and access by law enforcement authorities to
information.

and entities linked to terrorist ﬁnancing;
III. ADDITIONAL NEEDS
Considering that the Central Asian region is a neighbour to Afghanistan and that it
requires support, also in connection with threats originating from Afghanistan, parti-
cipants, from both inside and outside Central Asia, pleaded that special eﬀorts should
be made by the international community to provide technical and ﬁnancial assistance
on the basis of comprehensive national and regional programmes of action, in the
following areas:
2.
To encourage sustainable economic development by, inter alia, fostering co-operation
between national banks in the region as well as within international banking
structures, in order to support on the one hand, economic processes, including the
attraction of foreign investment, and, on the other hand, to enhance their capacity
to control money laundering and to suppress the ﬁnancing of terrorism;

The problem of small arms should be an integral part of the OSCE’s wider eﬀorts
in early warning, conﬂict prevention, crisis management and post-conﬂict rehabili-
tation. The destabilizing accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms
are elements which can impede conﬂict prevention, exacerbate conﬂicts and, where
peaceful settlements have been attained, impede both peace-building and social
and economic development. In some cases, it may contribute to a breakdown in
order, fuel terrorism and criminal violence or lead to a resumption of conﬂict. This
section sets out the norms, principles and measures which the participating States
agree to follow. (. . .)

In contribution to the world-wide eﬀorts to combat terrorism, the OSCE will seek
to add value on the basis of the speciﬁcs of the Organization, its strengths and
comparative advantages: its comprehensive security concept linking the politico-
military, human and economic dimensions; its broad membership; its experience in
the ﬁeld; and its expertise in early warning, conﬂict prevention, crisis management,
post-conﬂict rehabilitation and building democratic institutions. In addition, many
eﬀective counter-terrorism measures fall into areas in which the OSCE is already

active and proﬁcient, such as police training and monitoring, legislative and judicial
reform, and border monitoring.
8.
The participating States will also use the Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC)
to strengthen their eﬀorts in combating terrorism through full and timely imple-
mentation of all relevant measures agreed by the OSCE. To this end they will
enhance implementation of existing politico-military commitments and agree-
ments, in particular the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security
and the Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).
The FSC will examine the relevance of its other documents to the ﬁght against
terrorism, and will assess whether there is a need to develop additional norms
and measures. The Security Dialogue may serve as a suitable basis for regular
consultations on these issues within the FSC.
The participating States will submit responses to the Code of Conduct Question-
naire that provide further transparency on international, regional and national
commitments in combating terrorism, especially relevant United Nation con-
ventions and resolutions. The FSC will consider ways to fully implement the
Document on SALW, inter alia, Section V on early warning, conﬂict prevention,
crisis management, and post-conﬂict rehabilitation. The FSC will examine the
possibility of enhancing transparency on national marking systems, exports and
imports, and national stockpile management and security procedures, primarily
by reviewing the information thus exchanged and developing best practice guides.
The follow-up conference on the Code of Conduct and the SALW workshop, both
of which will take place in 2002, could further enhance the application of these
documents in combating terrorism.

OUR COMMON CHALLENGES
(. . .)
4.
International terrorism, violent extremism, organized crime and drug traﬃcking
represent growing challenges to security. Whatever its motives, terrorism in all its
form and manifestations is unacceptable. We will enhance our eﬀorts to prevent
the preparation and ﬁnancing of any act of terrorism on our territories and
deny terrorists safe havens. The excessive and destabilizing accumulation and
uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons represent a threat to peace
and security. We are committed to strengthening our protection against these new
risks and challenges; strong democratic institutions and the rule of law are the
foundation for this protection. We are also determined to co-operate more actively
and closely with each other to meet these challenges.
Ministerial Council Bucharest 2001
Decision No. 1 Combating Terrorism
The Bucharest Plan of Action for Combating Terrorism
The 55 participating States of the OSCE stand united against terrorism, a scourge of
our times.
The OSCE participating States resolutely condemn the barbaric acts of terrorism
that were committed against the United States on 11 September 2001. They represented
an attack on the whole of the international community, and on people of every faith
and culture. These heinous deeds, as well as other terrorist acts in all forms and mani-
festations, committed no matter when, where or by whom, are a threat to international
and regional peace, security and stability. There must be no safe haven for those per-
petrating, ﬁnancing, harbouring or otherwise supporting those responsible for such
criminal acts. Terrorism, whatever its motivation or origin, has no justiﬁcation.

human rights and fundamental freedoms and emphasize the necessity to take reso-
lute measures to combat it. They express their determination to take eﬀective meas-
ures for the prevention and suppression of acts of terrorism, both at the national
level and through international co-operation including appropriate bilateral and
multilateral agreements, and accordingly to broaden and reinforce mutual co-
operation to combat such acts. They agree to do so in conformity with the Charter
of the United Nations, the United Nations Declaration on Principles of Inter-
national Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States and the
Helsinki Final Act.
In the context of the combat against acts of terrorism, they will take all appropriate
measures in preventing their respective territories from being used for the preparation,
organization or commission of terrorist activities, including those directed against
other participating States and their citizens. This also includes measures to prohibit
on their territories illegal activities of persons, groups and organizations that instigate,
organize or engage in the perpetration of acts of terrorism.

2. In contribution to the world-wide eﬀorts to combat terrorism, the OSCE will seek
to add value on the basis of the speciﬁcs of the Organization, its strengths and
comparative advantages: its comprehensive security concept linking the politico-
military, human and economic dimensions; its broad membership; its experience in
the ﬁeld; and its expertise in early warning, conﬂict prevention, crisis management,
post-conﬂict rehabilitation and building democratic institutions. In addition, many
eﬀective counter-terrorism measures fall into areas in which the OSCE is already
active and proﬁcient, such as police training and monitoring, legislative and
judicial reform, and border monitoring.
7. Participating States: Will consider how the OSCE may draw upon best practices
and lessons learned from other relevant groups, organizations, institutions and
fora in areas such as police and judical co-operation; prevention and suppression
of the ﬁnancing of terrorism; denial of other means of support; border controls
including visa and document security; and access by law enforcement authorities to
information.
21. Secretariat: Will assist participating States, on their request, through measures to
combat traﬃcking in human beings, drugs and small arms and light weapons,
in accordance with relevant Permanent Council decisions, and will undertake
eﬀorts to assist in facilitating increased border monitoring, where appropriate. Will
further assist participating States, on the request and with their agreement, through
provision of advice and assistance on restructing and/or reconstruction of police
services; monitoring and training of existing police services, including human
rights training; and capacity building, including support for integrated or multi-
ethnic police services. Will, to this end, reinforce its existing police-related activities
in conﬂict prevention, crisis management and post-conﬂict rehabilitation.

of terrorist individuals or groups through eﬀective border controls and controls on
issuance of identity papers and travel documents, as well as through measures for
ensuring the security of identity papers and travel documents and preventing their
counterfeiting, forgery and fraudulent use. Will apply such control measures fully
respecting their obligations under international refugee and human rights law. Will,
through the proper application of the exclusion clauses contained in the 1951
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, ensure that
asylum is not granted to persons who have participated in terrorist acts. Will pro-
vide for the timely detention and prosecution or extradition of persons charged
with terrorist acts, in accordance with their obligations under international and

1.
To strengthen the capacities of Central Asian states to control their borders and to

impeding the normal ﬂow of trade and free movement of people;
Operative Paragraph 3

We face serious challenges, but we face them together. They concern the security
and sovereignty of States as well as the stability of our societies. Human rights are
not fully respected in all OSCE States. Ethnic tension, aggressive nationalism,
violations of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities, as well as
serious diﬃculties of economic transition, can threaten stability and may also
spread to other States. Terrorism, organized crime, drug and arms traﬃcking,
uncontrolled migration and environmental damage are of increasing concern to the
entire OSCE community.

The participating States will also use the Forum for Security Co-operation
(FSC) to strengthen their eﬀorts in combating terrorism through full and timely
implementation of all relevant measures agreed by the OSCE. To this end they will
enhance implementation of existing politico-military commitments and agreements,
in particular the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security and the
Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).
The FSC will examine the relevance of its other documents to the ﬁght against
terrorism, and will assess whether there is a need to develop additional norms
and measures. The Security Dialogue may serve as a suitable basis for regular
consultations on these issues within the FSC.
The participating States will submit responses to the Code of Conduct Question-
naire that provide further transparency on international, regional and national
commitments in combating terrorism, especially relevant United Nation conven-
tions and resolutions. The FSC will consider ways to fully implement the Docu-
ment on SALW, inter alia Section V on early warning, conﬂict prevention, crisis
management, and post-conﬂict rehabilitation. The FSC will examine the possibility
of enhancing transparency on national marking systems, exports and imports, and
national stockpile management and security procedures, primarily by reviewing the
information thus exchanged and developing best practice guides. The follow-up
conference on the Code of Conduct and the SALW workshop, both of which will
take place in 2002, could further enhance the application of these documents in
combating terrorism.

national, bilateral and multilateral eﬀorts to combat terrorism.
International legal obligations and political commitments
4.
United Nations conventions and United Nations Security Council resolutions
(UNSCR) constitute the global legal framework for the ﬁght against terrorism.
UNSCR 1269 (1999), 1368, 1373 and 1377 (2001), along with the 12 relevant
United Nations conventions and protocols on anti-terrorism issues, provide the
basis for this framework and include a number of speciﬁc elements of combating
terrorism. In addition, a range of OSCE documents, including Summit declarations
from Helsinki to Istanbul, spell out the OSCE’s commitments to ﬁght terrorism,
in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. The widest and most
comprehensive participation in and implementation of existing instruments and
commitments to combat terrorism by the participating States must be pursued
and ensured.
5.
Participating States: Pledge themselves to apply eﬀorts to become parties to all
12 United Nations conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, by 31 December,
2002, if possible, recognizing the important role that parliamentarians may play
in ratiﬁcation and other anti-terrorism legislative processes. States are encouraged
to inform the Permanent Council of steps taken in this regard. Will participate
constructively in the ongoing negotiations at the United Nations on a Comprehen-
sive Convention against International Terrorism and an International Convention
for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, with a view to their early and
successful conclusion.
6.
Oﬃce for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR): Will, on formal
request by interested participating States and where appropriate, oﬀer technical
assistance/advice on legislative drafting necessary for the ratiﬁcation of international
instruments, in close co-operation with other organizations, including the United
Nations Oﬃce for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (UNODCCP).
8.
The participating States will also use the Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC)
to strengthen their eﬀorts in combating terrorism through full and timely implemen-
tation of all relevant measures agreed by the OSCE. To this end they will enhance
implementation of existing politico-military commitments and agreements, in
particular the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security and the
Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).
The FSC will examine the relevance of its other documents to the ﬁght against
terrorism, and will assess whether there is a need to develop additional norms
and measures. The Security Dialogue may serve as a suitable basis for regular
consultations on these issues within the FSC.
The participating States will submit responses to the Code of Conduct Question-
naire that provide further transparency on international, regional and national
commitments in combating terrorism, especially relevant United Nation conven-
tions and resolutions. The FSC will consider ways to fully implement the Document
on SALW, inter alia, Section V on early warning, conﬂict prevention, crisis
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
249
 

management, and post-conﬂict rehabilitation. The FSC will examine the possibility
of enhancing transparency on national marking systems, exports and imports, and
national stockpile management and security procedures, primarily by reviewing the
information thus exchanged and developing best practice guides. The follow-up
conference on the Code of Conduct and the SALW workshop, both of which will
take place in 2002, could further enhance the application of these documents in
combating terrorism.
16. Strengthening national anti-terrorism legislation: Participating States: Will commit
themselves to implementing all the obligations they have assumed under relevant
conventions and protocols relating to terrorism as well as the United Nations Con-
vention against Transnational Organized Crime and its additional protocols, sharing
information and methods in this regard and considering ways and means of co-
operation in implementation at bilateral, OSCE-wide and sub-regional meetings.
18. ODIHR: Will, on request by interested participating States and where appro-
priate, oﬀer technical assistance/advice on the implementation of international anti-
terrorism conventions and protocols as well as on the compliance of this legislation
with international standards, in accordance with Permanent Council decisions,
and will seek co-operation with other organizations, especially the UNODCCP, to
this end. Will consider facilitating contacts between national experts to promote
exchange of information and best practices on counter-terrorism legislation.

To work toward rapid ratiﬁcation and implementation of relevant international
instruments, including the 1999 UN International Convention for the Suppression
of the Financing of Terrorism, and consider implementing the standards of ﬁnan-
cial accountability and transparency embodied in the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) 40 Recommendations on Money Laundering and eight Special
Recommendations on Terrorist Financing; to take immediate steps in accordance
with UN Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001), to block the assets of individuals
and entities linked to terrorist ﬁnancing;
II: MEASURES TO COMBAT AND PREVENT TERRORISM
Taking into account the commitments of the OSCE participating States, as reﬂected in
the Bucharest Plan of Action and in line with Section VII of the Plan of Action for the
implementation of the Vienna Declaration, the following measures were identiﬁed:
1.
To request OSCE and ODCCP to enhance synergy and coordination in providing
necessary assistance. In this regard, initiatives of UN/ODCCP and OSCE/ODIHR,
such as organizing regional and sub-regional workshops for the promotion of the
ratiﬁcation and implementation of international conventions are strongly encour-
aged. The crucial role of parliaments, in particular, in the ratiﬁcation process, is
also to be taken into account as is the role of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in
encouraging dialogue among parliamentarians;

Appendix
Decision No. 1
Combating Terrorism
The 55 participating States of the OSCE stand united against terrorism, a scourge of
our times.
The OSCE participating States resolutely condemn the barbaric acts of terrorism
that were committed against the United States on 11 September 2001. They repre-
sented an attack on the whole of the international community, and on people of every
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
252
 
www.ebook3000.com

faith and culture. These heinous deeds, as well as other terrorist acts in all forms and
manifestations, committed no matter when, where or by whom, are a threat to inter-
national and regional peace, security and stability. There must be no safe haven for
those perpetrating, ﬁnancing, harbouring or otherwise supporting those responsible for
such criminal acts. Terrorism, whatever its motivation or origin, has no justiﬁcation.
The OSCE participating States will not yield to terrorist threats, but will combat
them by all means in accordance with their international commitments. This will
require a long and sustained eﬀort, but they take strength from their broad coalition,
reaching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. They will defend freedom and protect their
citizens against acts of terrorism, fully respecting international law and human rights.
They ﬁrmly reject identiﬁcation of terrorism with any nationality or religion and
reconﬁrm the norms, principles and values of the OSCE.
The OSCE participating States pledge to reinforce and develop bilateral and
multilateral co-operation within the OSCE, with the United Nations and with other
international and regional organizations, in order to combat terrorism in all its
forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed. As a regional
arrangement under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, the OSCE is
determined to contribute to the fulﬁllment of international obligations as enshrined,
inter alia, in United Nations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), and will act in
conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The
OSCE participating States pledge to become parties to all 12 United Nations conven-
tions and protocols related to terrorism as soon as possible. They call for a speedy
ﬁnalization of negotiations for a Comprehensive United Nations Convention on
International Terrorism.
The OSCE participating States have come together in political solidarity to take
joint action. They look forward to the substantive contribution that the Bishkek
International Conference on Enhancing Security and Stability in Central Asia, to be
held on 13 and 14 December 2001, can render to global anti-terrorism eﬀorts, and will
support, also through technical assistance, the Central Asian partners, on their request,
in countering external threats related to terrorism.
To that end, the OSCE Ministerial Council adopts The Bucharest Plan of Action for
Combating Terrorism, annexed to this Decision.
The Bucharest Plan of Action for Combating Terrorism
I. Goal of the action plan
1.
Terrorism is a threat to international peace and security, in the OSCE area as
elsewhere. The OSCE stands ready to make its contribution to the ﬁght against
terrorism in close co-operation with other organizations and fora. This contribu-
tion will be consistent with the Platform for Co-operative Security and will beneﬁt
from interaction between global and regional anti-terrorism eﬀorts under the aegis
of the United Nations. The OSCE participating States commit their political will,
resources and practical means to the implementation of their obligations under
existing international terrorism conventions and pledge themselves to intensify
national, bilateral and multilateral eﬀorts to combat terrorism.
2.
In contribution to the world-wide eﬀorts to combat terrorism, the OSCE will seek
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
253
 

to add value on the basis of the speciﬁcs of the Organization, its strengths and
comparative advantages: its comprehensive security concept linking the politico-
military, human and economic dimensions, its broad membership; its experience in
the ﬁeld; and its expertise in early warning, conﬂict prevention, crisis management,
post-conﬂict rehabilitation and building democratic institutions. In addition, many
eﬀective counter-terrorism measures fall into areas in which the OSCE is already
active and proﬁcient, such as police training and monitoring, legislative and judicial
reform, and border monitoring.
3.
The aim of the Action Plan is to establish a framework for comprehensive OSCE
action to be taken by participating States and the Organization as a whole to
combat terrorism, fully respecting international law, including the international law
of human rights and other relevant norms of international law. The Action Plan
seeks to expand existing activities that contribute to combating terrorism, facilitate
interaction between States and, where appropriate, identify new instruments for
action. The Action Plan, which recognizes that the ﬁght against terrorism requires
sustained eﬀorts, will identify activities to be implemented immediately as well as
over the medium and long term.
II. International legal obligations and political commitments
4.
United Nations conventions and United Nations Security Council resolutions
(UNSCR) constitute the global legal framework for the ﬁght against terrorism.
UNSCR 1269 (1999), 1368, 1373 and 1377 (2001), along with the 12 relevant United
Nations conventions and protocols on anti-terrorism issues, provide the basis for
this framework and include a number of speciﬁc elements of combating terrorism.
In addition, a range of OSCE documents, including Summit declarations from
Helsinki to Istanbul, spell out the OSCE’s commitment to ﬁght terrorism, in accor-
dance with the Charter of the United Nations. The widest and most comprehensive
participation in and implementation of existing instruments and commitments to
combat terrorism by the participating States must be pursued and ensured.
5.
Participating States: Pledge themselves to apply eﬀorts to become parties to all 12
United Nations conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, by 31 December,
2002, if possible, recognizing the important role that parliamentarians may play in
ratiﬁcation and other anti-terrorism legislative processes. States are encouraged to
inform the Permanent Council of steps taken in this regard. Will participate con-
structively in the ongoing negotiations at the United Nations on a Comprehensive
Convention against International Terrorism and an International Convention for
the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, with a view to their early and
successful conclusion.
6. Oﬃce for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR): Will, on formal
request by interested participating States and where appropriate, oﬀer technical
assistance/advice on legislative drafting necessary for the ratiﬁcation of inter-
national instruments, in close co-operation with other organizations, including the
United Nations Oﬃce for Drug Control and Crime Prevention (UNODCCP).
7. Participating States: Will consider how the OSCE may draw upon best practices
and lessons learned from other relevant groups, organizations, institutions and
fora in areas such as police and judicial co-operation; prevention and suppression
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
254
 
www.ebook3000.com

of the ﬁnancing of terrorism; denial of other means of support; border controls
including visa and document security; and access by law enforcement authorities
to information.
8. The participating States will also use the Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC)
to strengthen their eﬀorts in combating terrorism through full and timely imple-
mentation of all relevant measures agreed by the OSCE. To this end they will
enhance implementation of existing politico-military commitments and agree-
ments, in particular the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security
and the Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).
The FSC will examine the relevance of its other documents to the ﬁght against
terrorism, and will assess whether there is a need to develop additional norms
and measures. The Security Dialogue may serve as a suitable basis for regular
consultations on these issues within the FSC.
The participating States will submit responses to the Code of Conduct Question-
naire that provide further transparency on international, regional and national
commitments in combating terrorism, especially relevant United Nation conven-
tions and resolutions. The FSC will consider ways to fully implement the Document
on SALW, inter alia, Section V on early warning, conﬂict prevention, crisis man-
agement, and post-conﬂict rehabilitation. The FSC will examine the possibility of
enhancing transparency on national marking systems, exports and imports, and
national stockpile management and security procedures, primarily by reviewing the
information thus exchanged and developing best practice guides. The follow-up
conference on the Code of Conduct and the SALW workshop, both of which will
take place in 2002, could further enhance the application of these documents in
combating terrorism.
III. Preventive action against terrorism in the OSCE area
9. No circumstance or cause can justify acts of terrorism. At the same time, there
are various social, economic, political and other factors, including violent
separatism and extremism, which engender conditions in which terrorist organiza-
tions are able to recruit and win support. The OSCE’s comprehensive approach
to security provides comparative advantages in combating terrorism by
identifying and addressing these factors through all relevant OSCE instruments
and structures.
10. Institution building, strengthening the rule of law and state authorities: ODIHR:
Will continue and increase eﬀorts to promote and assist in building democratic
institutions at the request of States, inter alia, by helping to strengthen adminis-
trative capacity, local and central government and parliamentary structures, the
judiciary, ombudsman institutions and civil society. Will facilitate exchanges of
best practices and experience between participating States in this regard. Will
continue to develop projects to solidify democratic institutions, civil society and
good governance.
11. Promoting human rights, tolerance and multi-culturalism: Participating States/
Permanent Council/ODIHR/High Commisioner on National Minorities (HCNM)/
Representative on Freedom of the Media: Will promote and enhance tolerance,
co-existence and harmonious relations between ethnic, religious, linguistic and
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
255
 

other groups as well as constructive co-operation among participating States in
this regard. Will provide early warning of and appropriate responses to violence,
intolerance, extremism and discrimination against these groups and, at the same
time, promote their respect for the rule of law, democratic values and individual
freedoms. Will work to ensure that persons belonging to national minorities have
the right freely to express, preserve and develop their ethnic, cultural, linguistic or
religious identity.
12. Representative on Freedom of the Media: Will consider developing projects aimed
at supporting tolerance towards people of other convictions and beliefs through
the use of the media. Will promote measures aimed at preventing and ﬁghting
aggressive nationalism, racism, chauvinism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in
the media. Will continue to encourage pluralistic debate and increased media atten-
tion to promoting tolerance of ethnic, religious, linguistic and cultural diversity
and will, in this context, promote broad public access to media as well as monitor
hate speech.
13. Addressing negative socio-economic factors: Participating States/Secretariat: Will
aim to identify economic and environmental issues that undermine security, such
as poor governance; corruption; illegal economic activity; high unemployment;
widespread poverty and large disparities; demographic factors; and unsustainable
use of natural resources; and will seek to counter such factors with the assis-
tance, on their request, of the Oﬃce of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and
Environmental Activities (OCEEA), acting, among other things, as a catalyst for
action and co-operation.
14. Preventing violent conﬂict and promoting peaceful settlement of disputes: Drawing
on all its capacities, the OSCE will continue and intensify work aimed at early
warning and appropriate response, conﬂict prevention, crisis management and
post-conﬂict rehabilitation; will strengthen its ability to settle conﬂicts; will increase
eﬀorts to ﬁnd lasting solutions to unresolved conﬂicts, including through pro-
motion of the rule of law and crime prevention in such conﬂict zones through
increased co-operation with the United Nations, the European Union and other
international organizations; and will further develop its rapid deployment capability
(REACT) in crisis situations.
15. Addressing the issue of protracted displacement: Participating States/ODIHR/
HCNM/Representative on Freedom of the Media: Will explore strengthened OSCE
potential for contributing to durable solutions, supporting and closely co-operating
with other relevant organizations, primarily the Oﬃce of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees. Will closely monitor situations of protracted
displacement.
16. Strengthening national anti-terrorism legislation: Participating States: Will commit
themselves to implementing all the obligations they have assumed under relevant
conventions and protocols relating to terrorism as well as the United Nations Con-
vention against Transnational Organized Crime and its additional protocols, shar-
ing information and methods in this regard and considering ways and means of
co-operation in implementation at bilateral, OSCE-wide and sub-regional meetings.
17. OSCE Parliamentary Assembly: Will continue its eﬀorts to promote dialogue
among OSCE parliamentarians with a view to strengthening legislation essential
in combating terrorism.

18. ODIHR: Will, on request by interested participating States and where appro-
priate, oﬀer technical assistance/advice on the implementation of international anti-
terrorism conventions and protocols as well as on the compliance of this legislation
with international standards, in accordance with Permanent Council decisions, and
will seek co-operation with other organizations, especially the UNODCCP, to this
end. Will consider facilitating contacts between national experts to promote
exchange of information and best practices on counter-terrorism legislation.
19. Supporting law enforcement and ﬁghting organized crime: Participating States:
Noting the close connection between terrorism and transnational organized crime,
illicit traﬃcking in drugs, money laundering and illicit arms traﬃcking, will take
the necessary steps to prevent in their territory illegal activities of persons, groups
or organizations that instigate, ﬁnance, organize, facilitate or engage in perpetra-
tion of acts of terrorism or other illegal activities directed at the violent overthrow
of the political regime of another participating State. Will aﬀord one another the
greatest measure of assistance in providing information in connection with crim-
inal investigations or criminal extradition proceedings relating to terrorist acts, in
accordance with their domestic law and international obligations.
20. Permanent Council: Will consider arranging regular meetings of law enforcement
oﬃcials of participating States and, where applicable, of OSCE experts with
relevant experience in the ﬁeld to exchange best practices and ways of improving
co-operation.
21. Secretariat: Will assist participating States, on their request, through measures to
combat traﬃcking in human beings, drugs and small arms and light weapons, in
accordance with relevant Permanent Council decisions, and will undertake eﬀorts
to assist in facilitating increased border monitoring, where appropriate. Will fur-
ther assist participating States, on the request and with their agreement, through
provision of advice and assistance on restructuring and/or reconstruction of police
services; monitoring and training of existing police services, including human
rights training; and capacity building, including support for integrated or multi-
ethnic police services. Will, to this end, reinforce its existing police-related activities
in conﬂict prevention, crisis management and post-conﬂict rehabilitation.
22. ODIHR: Will provide continued advice to participating States, at their request, on
strengthening domestic legal frameworks and institutions that uphold the rule of
law, such as law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and the prosecuting author-
ities, bar associations and defence attorneys. Will expand its eﬀorts to combat
traﬃcking in human beings and to support victims of traﬃcking. Will, where
appropriate, support prison reform and improvements in criminal procedure.
23. Representative on Freedom of the Media: Will co-operate in supporting, on request,
the drafting of legislation on the prevention of the abuse of information technology
for terrorist purposes, ensuring that such laws are consistent with commitments
regarding freedom of expression and the free ﬂow of information.
24. Suppressing the ﬁnancing of terrorism. Participating States: Will, within the frame-
work of the United Nations Convention on the Suppression of Financing of
Terrorism and UNSCR 1373 (2001), take action to prevent and suppress the
ﬁnancing of terrorism, criminalize the wilful provision or collection of funds
for terrorist purposes, and freeze terrorist assets also bearing in mind UNSCR 1267
(1999). Will, in accordance with their domestic legislation and obligations under
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
257
 

international law, provide early response to requests for information by another
participating State and relevant international organizations.
25. Participating States/Secretariat: Will, in the realm of the Economic and Environ-
mental activities for 2002, also consider ways of combating economic factors which
may facilitate the emergence of terrorism, economic consequences of terrorism
as well as ﬁnancial support for terrorists. Will consider how the OSCE may con-
tribute, within the framework of its work on transparency and the ﬁght against
corruption, to the wider international eﬀort to combat terrorism. Will consider
taking on a catalytic role in providing targeted projects for the training of the
personnel of domestic ﬁnancial institutions in counter-terrorism areas, inter alia, on
monitoring of ﬁnancial ﬂows and on prevention of money laundering. Participating
States will participate constructively in the forthcoming negotiations at the United
Nations on a global instrument against corruption, with a view to their early and
successful conclusion.
26. Preventing movement of terrorists: Participating States: Will prevent the movement
of terrorist individuals or groups through eﬀective border controls and controls on
issuance of identity papers and travel documents, as well as through measures for
ensuring the security of identity papers and travel documents and preventing their
counterfeiting, forgery and fraudulent use. Will apply such control measures fully
respecting their obligations under international refugee and human rights law.
Will, through the proper application of the exclusion clauses contained in the 1951
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, ensure that
asylum is not granted to persons who have participated in terrorist acts. Will pro-
vide for the timely detention and prosecution or extradition of persons charged
with terrorist acts, in accordance with their obligations under international and
national law.
IV. Action under the platform for co-operative security – Co-operation
with other organizations
27. The United Nations is the framework for the global ﬁght against terrorism. Close
co-operation and co-ordination between all relevant actors must be secured. The
OSCE can take on a co-ordinating role for inter- and intra-regional initiatives.
The OSCE reaches out through close contacts to non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), civil society and parliamentarians, creating an ever-closer network for the
international coalition against terrorism.
28. Participating States/Secretariat: Will strengthen co-operation and information
exchanges, both formally and informally, with other relevant groups, organizations,
and institutions involved in combating terrorism. Will strengthen co-operation
with the European Union on analysis and early warning and reinforce synergy with
the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe and the Central European Initiative in
areas relevant to combating terrorism. Will promote dialogue within the OSCE area
on issues relating to new threats and challenges. Will broaden dialogue with part-
ners outside the OSCE area, such as the Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation
and Partners for Co-operation in Asia, the Shanghai Co-operation Organization,
the Conference on Interaction and Conﬁdence-Building Measures in Asia, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Arab League, the African Union, and
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

those States bordering on the OSCE area to exchange best practices and lessons
learned in counter-terrorism eﬀorts for application within the OSCE area.
V. Follow-up
29. The ‘Bishkek International Conference on Enhancing Security and Stability in
Central Asia: Strengthening Comprehensive Eﬀorts to Counter Terrorism’, to be
held on 13 and 14 December 2001 in Bishkek, will be a ﬁrst opportunity to:
—
discuss among a broad range of participants, on the basis of the present
Action Plan, concrete experiences and best practices in combating international
terrorism and
—
due to the speciﬁc security challenges to which this region is exposed, apply
relevant provisions of this Action Plan for practical support to participating
States in Central Asia, including ﬁnancial and technical assistance in concrete
areas of their interest.
30. The Secretary General will, by 27 December 2001, report to the United Nations
Counter Terrorism Committee on action on combating terrorism taken by the
OSCE, and will thereafter inform the United Nations as appropriate. In addition,
he will regularly inform the Permanent Council about OSCE activities under
this Plan of Action. He will prepare a report for submission to the next OSCE
Ministerial Council/Summit on activities of OSCE bodies in the anti-terrorism
ﬁeld, and thereafter as requested by the Permanent Council.
31. Each OSCE body called upon to take action under this Plan will prepare, for
submission to the Permanent Council, a ‘road map’ for implementation of these
tasks, including a timetable, resource implications, and indication of activities
requiring further Permanent Council decisions
On the basis of information provided by other OSCE bodies, the Secretariat will
prepare an indicative assessment of the administrative and ﬁnancial implications
of this Plan of Action, including the possible need for establishing an anti-
terrorism unit or focal point within the Secretariat, and make recommendations for
the approval by the Permanent Council of necessary resources within the 2002
budget. The Permanent Council, acting, inter alia, through the Chairman-in-Oﬃce
and assisted by the Secretariat, will monitor the implementation of this Action
Plan. It will further identify sources for assistance in implementing counter-
terrorism measures, including expert teams, and possible additional tasking by the
Permanent Council of OSCE ﬁeld presences in close co-operation and agreement
with host governments.

Resolutely condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations:
Acknowledging the primary role of the United Nations in the ﬁght against terrorism
and supporting resolutions no. 1377 (2001), 1373 (2001), 1368 (2001) and 1269 (1999)
of the UN Security Council, as well as General Assembly Resolution 56/1 as a basis and
framework for global co-operation to counter international terrorism:
Reaﬃrming the ‘Decision on Combating Terrorism’ and the ‘Bucharest Plan of Action
for Combating Terrorism’ adopted at the Ninth Meeting of the OSCE Ministerial Council
on 3–4 December 2001 in Bucharest:
Acknowledging the importance of the Declaration by the Central Asian states and the
document ‘Priorities for Co-operation to Counter Drugs, Organized Crime and Terrorism
in Central Asia’, as endorsed in Tashkent, 20 October 2000:
Committed to address political conﬂicts and economic and social problems which are
exploited by terrorists and violent extremists to mobilise support for their cause.
Determined to translate their political will into action by joining forces to combat
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
(1) Note the importance and timeliness of the Bishkek Conference 2001, as an inter-
national forum to strengthen understanding and share approaches in the struggle
against terrorism.
(2) Emphasise that terrorism is a global problem and that there must be no safe haven
for perpetrators of such crimes and their accomplices. It is a complex challenge
due to links with transnational organized crime, illicit drugs, traﬃcking in human
beings, money laundering, arms traﬃcking, computer and other high technology
crimes as well as other threats, including the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.
(3) Reject ﬁrmly the identiﬁcation of terrorism with any particular religion or culture
as well as the unacceptable attempts by terrorists and violent extremists to present
their cause as a struggle between religions or cultures.
(4) Conﬁrm that the struggle against terrorism requires joint and comprehensive
eﬀorts of the international community, in full conformity with the purposes
and principles of the UN Charter, their obligations under international law,
and the OSCE commitments they have undertaken, which closely link the OSCE’s
politico-military, human and economic dimensions.
(5) Express their determination to combat terrorism while fully respecting human
rights and the rule of law.
(6) Underline their commitment to address at the earliest possible moment political
conﬂicts and economic and social problems which are exploited and abused by
terrorists and violent extremists to mobilise support for their destructive causes.
(7) Call upon the international community, governments and civil societies to closely
co-operate in the struggle against acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifest-
ations on bilateral, regional and multilateral levels.
(8) Note that as a neighbor to Afghanistan, the Central Asian region is exposed to
speciﬁc challenges and threats to security; in this connection, they note the contri-
bution of the states in the region to the global coalition against international
terrorism and emphasized the necessity to render political support and ﬁnancial/
technical assistance to the states of Central Asia in this context, including support
for sustainable development.

at preventing and countering terrorism.

Express their gratitude to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for having
taken the initiative for this conference and for the excellent conference framework
and hospitality in Bishkek.
Bishkek International Conference on Enhancing Security and Stability in
Central Asia: Strengthening Comprehensive Eﬀorts to
Counter Terrorism
13–14 December 2001
‘Programme of action’
I: Framework for Co-operation
1.
The ‘Bishkek International Conference on Enhancing Security and Stability in
Central Asia: Strengthening Comprehensive Eﬀorts to Counter Terrorism’ (Bishkek
Conference), which was co-organized by UN ODCCP and OSCE, brought together,
in the spirit of the UN Charter and the OSCE Platform for Co-operative Security,
representatives of OSCE participating States and a broad range of oﬃcials from
international organisations, observers and experts.
2.
Discussions were based on United Nations resolutions, in particular, Security
Council Resolutions 1373 and 1377, the UN Plan of Action for the implementation
of the UN Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of
the Twenty-ﬁrst Century (April 2000), and on the OSCE Bucharest Plan of Action
for Combating Terrorism (4 December 2001). Considering the fact that the
‘Bishkek Conference’ is also a follow-up to the International Conference on
Enhancing Security and Stability in Central Asia (Tashkent, October 2000), the
outcome of the ‘Tashkent Conference’ was duly taken into account.
3.
The ‘Bishkek Conference’ strengthened the resolve of the participants to unite
in the ﬁght against terrorism and to support the key role of the United Nations.
4.
The participants invited international and regional organisations to strengthen
co-operation and co-ordination by undertaking the following steps:
•
To make full use of platforms, like the ‘Bishkek Conference’, to develop syner-
gies between their activities in order to maximise the eﬀectiveness of their
assistance. In this regard, participants welcomed the intention of ODCCP
and OSCE to further develop working contacts in order to strengthen their
complementary capacities; and
•
To build upon positive experiences gained in the development of the ODCCP
Programme for Central Asia, with the assistance of the donor community.
II: Measures to combat and prevent terrorism
Taking into account the commitments of the OSCE participating States, as reﬂected in
the Bucharest Plan of Action and in line with Section VII of the Plan of Action for the
implementation of the Vienna Declaration, the following measures were identiﬁed:
1.
To request OSCE and ODCCP to enhance synergy and coordination in providing
necessary assistance. In this regard, initiatives of UN/ODCCP and OSCE/ODIHR,
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
261
 

such as organizing regional and sub-regional workshops for the promotion of
the ratiﬁcation and implementation of international conventions are strongly
encouraged. The crucial role of parliaments, in particular, in the ratiﬁcation pro-
cess, is also to be taken into account as is the role of the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly in encouraging dialogue among parliamentarians;
2.
To enhance national interagency co-operation between anti-terrorist agencies and
agencies ﬁghting crime, including drug traﬃcking, by an exchange of operational
information between such agencies and law enforcement authorities charged with
combating terrorism:
3.
To foster regional and international co-operation between anti-terrorist agencies
and agencies ﬁghting crime, including the traﬃcking of arms and illicit drugs,
e.g. in the form of the establishment of channels of communication between
relevant agencies; to suggest to the OSCE Permanent Council to consider conven-
ing in Vienna a special expert meeting, with the participation of representatives
of law enforcement bodies, arranged by the OSCE while inviting the UN as
a co-organiser;
4.
To adopt national anti-money laundering legislation and create corresponding
structures, e.g. Financial Intelligence Units, which can be employed to prevent and
suppress the ﬁnancing of terrorism, as well as other relevant crimes. In this connec-
tion, the participants drew the attention of the international community to the
importance of providing assistance, upon request, to States in developing relevant
national legislative and administrative tools;
5.
To work toward rapid ratiﬁcation and implementation of relevant international
instruments, including the 1999 UN International Convention for the Suppression
of the Financing of Terrorism, and consider implementing the standards of ﬁnan-
cial accountability and transparency embodied in the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) 40 Recommendations on Money Laundering and eight Special
Recommendations on Terrorist Financing; to take immediate steps in accordance
with UN Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001), to block the assets of individuals
and entities linked to terrorist ﬁnancing;
6.
To have countries gather information on, and engage in the analysis of, criminal
activities carried out for the purposes of furthering terrorism, as well as collect and
update relevant information on terrorism and related activities. Subject to bilateral
or multilateral agreements, such information could also be shared with appropriate
international bodies and other countries;
7.
To increase funding for relevant research conducted by appropriate institutions,
including universities and non-governmental and governmental agencies;
8.
To prevent the destabilising accumulation and uncontrolled spread and illicit
traﬃcking of small arms and light weapons (SALW). In this context, the
experiences from the implementation of the OSCE Document on Small Arms and
Light Weapons, as well as from a series of national training workshops in all
ﬁve OSCE participating States of Central Asia on combating traﬃcking and
the stockpile management of SALW, should be taken into account. In addition,
states are encouraged to actively participate in the regional seminar to be held
in the spring of 2002 in Almaty. Moreover, the OSCE Conﬂict Prevention Centre
is encouraged to develop further activities in the implementation of the afore-
mentioned OSCE document;

9.
To prevent and to combat terrorism by increasing co-operation in the ﬁelds of
human rights and fundamental freedoms and by strengthening the rule of law and
the building of democratic institutions, based in part, on the funding of relevant
programmes of the UN as well as the OSCE;
10. To enhance the capacity of the judiciary to deal with all aspects of terrorism and
related crime, including by the provision of relevant expertise and training so as
further strengthen the independence and impartiality of the judiciary;
11. To address inter ethnic frictions at the earliest possible stage, thus contributing to a
comprehensive policy for the prevention of terrorism; to support, in particular, the
eﬀorts of the OSCE HCNM in addressing issues pertaining to his mandate; and to
foster dialogue and tolerance between majorities and minorities;
12. To promote active civil society engagement in the ﬁght against terrorism; and to
oﬀer young people opportunities to learn and practice tolerance, to enable them to
actively participate in civil society and to familiarize them with peaceful conﬂict
resolution methods;
13. To emphasize the importance of tolerance in all aspects of social relations and
the signiﬁcant role of dialogue among civilizations as a means of reaching under-
standing and removing threats to peace in the spirit of UN General Assembly
Resolution 53/22; and to foster continuous dialogue among all segments of society
(including political and religious leaders, parliamentarians and NGOs) in order to
prevent the marginalization of any segment of society; to recommend to the OSCE
Permanent Council to consider in 2002 the commencing of a dialogue between the
OSCE and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.
14. To assist in strengthening free media, including serving the legitimate information
needs of society without providing a platform for terrorists; to support the ongoing
ODCCP project, ‘Mass Media Training on Drug and Crime Related Issues’ which
is being implemented in co-operation with the OSCE, as well as to follow-up on the
result of the conference on media freedom in times of terrorist conﬂict, organized
in Almaty by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media; and to develop
further programmes in this area, to promote freedom of expression and to monitor
hate speech.
15. To provide psychological and social services to the victims of terrorism and to their
families; and
16. To address economic and social problems that are exploited by terrorists, by
encouraging the countries concerned to focus on sustainable development policies,
taking into account existing priorities within the donor community.
III. Additional needs
Considering that the Central Asian region is a neighbour to Afghanistan and that it
requires support, also in connection with threats originating from Afghanistan, parti-
cipants from both inside and outside Central Asia, pleaded that special eﬀorts should
be made by the international community to provide technical and ﬁnancial assistance
on the basis of comprehensive national and regional programmes of action, in the
following areas:
1.
To strengthen the capacities of Central Asian states to control their borders and
to prevent border crossing by terrorist and organised crime groups, by taking into
C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M  C O M M I T T E E
263
 

account the situation in Afghanistan with speciﬁc regard to illicit drugs, without
impeding the normal ﬂow of trade and free movement of people;
2.
To encourage sustainable economic development by, inter alia, fostering
co-operation between national banks in the region as well as within international
banking structures, in order to support on the one hand, economic process, includ-
ing the attraction of foreign investment, and, on the other hand, to enhance their
capacity to control money laundering and to suppress the ﬁnancing of terrorism;
3.
To undertake joint training and operational activities in various areas, including
training of specialists and considering the provision of appropriate equipment and
technologies; and
4.
To strengthen the capacity of governmental institutions to combat terrorism,
organized crime and illicit drugs.
5.
To consider providing such ﬁnancial and other assistance also with a view
to facilitate the ratiﬁcation and implementation of the relevant international
conventions.
Measures in these areas should be addressed in comprehensive frameworks. In order
to contribute to and ensure such frameworks, as well as to provide support for such
measures, consideration should be given – not least with an eye for due follow-up and
eﬀective implementation – to continuing the dialogue among concerned countries, with
the assistance of ODCCP and OSCE.

Annex
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of
Nuclear Terrorism
The States Parties to this Convention,
Having in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of
good-neighbourliness and friendly relations and cooperation among States,
265
 

Recalling the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United
Nations of 24 October 1995,
Recognizing the right of all States to develop and apply nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes and their legitimate interests in the potential beneﬁts to be derived from the
peaceful application of nuclear energy,
Bearing in mind the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material
of 1980,
Deeply concerned about the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism in all its forms
and manifestations,
Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annexed
to General Assembly resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994, in which, inter alia,
the States Members of the United Nations solemnly reaﬃrm their unequivocal con-
demnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustiﬁable,
wherever and by whomever committed, including those which jeopardize the friendly
relations among States and peoples and threaten the territorial integrity and security
of States,
Noting that the Declaration also encouraged States to review urgently the scope of
the existing international legal provisions on the prevention, repression and elimin-
ation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, with the aim of ensuring that
there is a comprehensive legal framework covering all aspects of the matter,
Recalling General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996 and the Declar-
ation to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International
Terrorism annexed thereto,
Recalling also that, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51/210, an ad hoc
committee was established to elaborate, inter alia, an international convention for the
suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism to supplement related existing international
instruments,
Noting that acts of nuclear terrorism may result in the gravest consequences and may
pose a threat to international peace and security,
Noting also that existing multilateral legal provisions do not adequately address
those attacks,
Being convinced of the urgent need to enhance international cooperation between
States in devising and adopting eﬀective and practical measures for the prevention of
such acts of terrorism and for the prosecution and punishment of their perpetrators,
Noting that the activities of military forces of States are governed by rules of inter-
national law outside of the framework of this Convention and that the exclusion of
certain actions from the coverage of this Convention does not condone or make lawful
otherwise unlawful acts, or preclude prosecution under other laws,
Have agreed as follows:
Article 1
For the purposes of this Convention:
1.
‘Radioactive material’ means nuclear material and other radioactive substances
which contain nuclides which undergo spontaneous disintegration (a process

Article 11
1.
The State Party in the territory of which the alleged oﬀender is present shall, in
cases to which article 9 applies, if it does not extradite that person, be obliged,
without exception whatsoever and whether or not the oﬀence was committed in its
territory, to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for
the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with the laws of
that State. Those authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the
case of any other oﬀence of a grave nature under the law of that State.
2.
Whenever a State Party is permitted under its national law to extradite or otherwise
surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be
returned to that State to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or
proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought, and
this State and the State seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option
and other terms they may deem appropriate, such a conditional extradition or
surrender shall be suﬃcient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 1 of
the present article.
Article 12
Any person who is taken into custody or regarding whom any other measures are taken
or proceedings are carried out pursuant to this Convention shall be guaranteed fair
treatment, including enjoyment of all rights and guarantees in conformity with the law
of the State in the territory of which that person is present and applicable provisions of
international law, including international law of human rights.
Article 13
1.
The oﬀences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable
oﬀences in any extradition treaty existing between any of the States Parties before
the entry into force of this Convention. States Parties undertake to include such
oﬀences as extraditable oﬀences in every extradition treaty to be subsequently
concluded between them.
2.
When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a
treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has
no extradition treaty, the requested State Party may, at its option, consider this
Convention as a legal basis for extradition in respect of the oﬀences set forth in
article 2. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of
the requested State.
3.
States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty
shall recognize the oﬀences set forth in article 2 as extraditable oﬀences between
themselves, subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested State.
4.
If necessary, the oﬀences set forth in article 2 shall be treated, for the purposes
of extradition between States Parties, as if they had been committed not only in
the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of the States that have
established jurisdiction in accordance with article 9, paragraphs 1 and 2.
5.

Convention.
Article 14
1.

States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 of the present
article in conformity with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal
assistance that may exist between them. In the absence of such treaties or arrange-
ments, States Parties shall aﬀord one another assistance in accordance with their
national law.
Article 15
None of the oﬀences set forth in article 2 shall be regarded, for the purposes of extradi-
tion or mutual legal assistance, as a political oﬀence or as an oﬀence connected with a
political oﬀence or as an oﬀence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request
for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such an oﬀence may not be
refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political oﬀence or an oﬀence connected
with a political oﬀence or an oﬀence inspired by political motives.
Article 16
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite
or to aﬀord mutual legal assistance if the requested State Party has substantial grounds
for believing that the request for extradition for oﬀences set forth in article 2 or for
mutual legal assistance with respect to such oﬀences has been made for the purpose of
prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person’s race, religion, national-
ity, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause
prejudice to that person’s position for any of these reasons.
Article 17
1.
A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State
Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of testimony,
identiﬁcation or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for the
investigation or prosecution of oﬀences under this Convention may be transferred
if the following conditions are met:

the present article so agrees, that person, whatever his or her nationality, shall not

consultations between the States concerned and any relevant international
organizations.
5.

Nations, as well as the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism,
Recalling also the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the
World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, in which the Conference reaf-
ﬁrmed that the acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifest-
ations, as well as its linkage in some countries to drug traﬃcking, are activities aimed
at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening
the territorial integrity and the security of States and destabilizing legitimately consti-
tuted Governments, and that the international community should take the necessary
steps to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism,
Recalling further the United Nations Millennium Declaration adopted by the General
Assembly,
Recalling, in this regard, the reference in the report of the Secretary-General on the

it must be pursued, however, in full compliance with established international norms,

Annex
International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism
PREAMBLE
The States Parties to this Convention,
Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of
good-neighbourliness and friendly relations and cooperation among States,
Deeply concerned about the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism in all its forms
and manifestations,
Recalling the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United
Nations, contained in General Assembly resolution 50/6 of 24 October 1995,
Recalling also all the relevant General Assembly resolutions on the matter, including
resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994 and the annex thereto on the Declaration on
Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, in which the States Members of the
United Nations solemnly reaﬃrmed their unequivocal condemnation of all acts,
methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustiﬁable, wherever and by
whomever committed, including those which jeopardize the friendly relations among
States and peoples and threaten the territorial integrity and security of States,
Noting that the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism also
encouraged States to review urgently the scope of the existing international legal provi-
sions on the prevention, repression and elimination of terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations, with the aim of ensuring that there is a comprehensive legal framework
covering all aspects of the matter,
Recalling paragraph 3 (f) of General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December
1996, in which the Assembly called upon all States to take steps to prevent and coun-
teract, through appropriate domestic measures, the ﬁnancing of terrorists and terrorist
organizations, whether such ﬁnancing is direct or indirect through organizations which
also have or claim to have charitable, social or cultural goals or which are also engaged
in unlawful activities such as illicit arms traﬃcking, drug dealing and racketeering,
including the exploitation of persons for purposes of funding terrorist activities, and in
particular to consider, where appropriate, adopting regulatory measures to prevent and
counteract movements of funds suspected to be intended for terrorist purposes without
impeding in any way the freedom of legitimate capital movements and to intensify the
exchange of information concerning international movements of such funds,
Recalling also General Assembly resolution 52/165 of 15 December 1997, in which
the Assembly called upon States to consider, in particular, the implementation of the
measures set out in paragraphs 3 (a) to (f) of its resolution 51/210,
Recalling further General Assembly resolution 53/108 of 8 December 1998, in
which the Assembly decided that the Ad Hoc Committee established by General
Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996 should elaborate a draft inter-
national convention for the suppression of terrorist ﬁnancing to supplement related
existing international instruments,
Considering that the ﬁnancing of terrorism is a matter of grave concern to the
international community as a whole,

Noting that the number and seriousness of acts of international terrorism depend on
the ﬁnancing that terrorists may obtain,
Noting also that existing multilateral legal instruments do not expressly address such
ﬁnancing,
Being convinced of the urgent need to enhance international cooperation among
States in devising and adopting eﬀective measures for the prevention of the ﬁnancing
of terrorism, as well as for its suppression through the prosecution and punishment of
its perpetrators,
Have agreed as follows:

(a) An act which constitutes an oﬀence within the scope of and as deﬁned in one
of the treaties listed in the annex; or
(b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian,

organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.
2.
(a) On depositing its instrument of ratiﬁcation, acceptance, approval or accession,

returned to that State to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or
proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought, and
this State and the State seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option

2.
When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a
treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has

or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such oﬀences has been made for the
purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person’s race,
religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the
request would cause prejudice to that person’s position for any of these reasons.
Article 16
1.

criminal activity. For this purpose, States Parties shall consider:

ectors and provisions regulating the power to bind the entity;

necessary records on transactions, both domestic and international.

Measures to eliminate international terrorism
The General Assembly,
Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
Recalling all its relevant resolutions, including resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994,
by which it adopted the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism,
and resolutions 50/53 of 11 December 1995, 51/210 of 17 December 1996 and 52/165
of 15 December 1997,
Recalling also the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the
United Nations,
Deeply disturbed by the persistence of terrorist acts, which have been carried out
worldwide,
Stressing the need to strengthen further international cooperation between States
and between international organizations and agencies, regional organizations and
arrangements and the United Nations in order to prevent, combat and elimin-
ate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever
committed,
Mindful of the need to enhance the role of the United Nations and the relevant
specialized agencies in combating international terrorism, and of the proposals of the
Secretary-General to enhance the role of the Organization in this respect,
Recalling that in the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism,
contained in the annex to resolution 49/60, the General Assembly encouraged States to
review urgently the scope of the existing international legal provisions on the preven-
tion, repression and elimination of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, with
the aim of ensuring that there was a comprehensive legal framework covering all
aspects of the matter,
Bearing in mind the possibility of considering in the near future the elaboration of a
comprehensive convention on international terrorism,
Bearing in mind also that the Twelfth Conference of Heads of State or Government of
Non-Aligned Countries, held at Durban, South Africa, from 29 August to 3 September
1998, reaﬃrmed its collective position on terrorism and as a recent initiative called
for an international summit conference under the auspices of the United Nations to

Recognizing the urgent need to enhance international cooperation to prevent terrorist
ﬁnancing and to develop an appropriate legal instrument,
Having examined the report of the Secretary-General,
1. Strongly condemns all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and
unjustiﬁable, wherever and by whomsoever committed;
2. Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in
the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes
are in any circumstances unjustiﬁable, whatever the considerations of a political,
philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may be
invoked to justify them;
3. Reiterates its call upon all States to adopt further measures in accordance with
the relevant provisions of international law, including international standards
of human rights, to prevent terrorism and to strengthen international coopera-
tion in combating terrorism and, to that end, to consider in particular the
implementation of the measures set out in paragraphs 3 (a) to (f) of its resolution
51/210;
4. Also reiterates its call upon all States, with the aim of enhancing the eﬃcient

5. Reiterates its call upon States to refrain from ﬁnancing, encouraging, providing
training for or otherwise supporting terrorist activities;
6. Reaﬃrms that international cooperation as well as actions by States to combat
terrorism should be conducted in conformity with the principles of the Charter of

becoming parties to relevant conventions and protocols as referred to in paragraph
6 of resolution 51/210, as well as the International Convention for the Suppression
of Terrorist Bombings, and calls upon all States to enact, as appropriate,
domestic legislation necessary to implement the provisions of those conventions
and protocols, to ensure that the jurisdiction of their courts enables them to bring
to trial the perpetrators of terrorist acts, and to cooperate with and provide support
and assistance to other States and relevant international and regional organizations
to that end;
8. Reaﬃrms the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism con-
tained in the annex to resolution 49/60 and the Declaration to Supplement the 1994
Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism contained in the
annex to resolution 51/210, and calls upon all States to implement them;

manifestations;

lution 51/210 of 17 December 1996 shall continue to elaborate a draft international
convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism with a view to complet-
ing the instrument, shall elaborate a draft international convention for the suppres-
sion of terrorist ﬁnancing to supplement related existing international instruments,
and subsequently shall address means of further developing a comprehensive legal
framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism, including consider-
ing, on a priority basis, the elaboration of a comprehensive convention on inter-
national terrorism;
12. Decides further that the Ad Hoc Committee shall meet from 15 to 26 March 1999,
devoting appropriate time to the consideration of the outstanding issues relating to
the elaboration of a draft international convention for the suppression of acts of
nuclear terrorism, and that it shall initiate the elaboration of a draft international
convention for the suppression of terrorist ﬁnancing, and recommends that the
work continue during the ﬁfty-fourth session of the General Assembly from
27 September to 8 October 1999, within the framework of a working group of the
Sixth Committee, and that the Ad Hoc Committee be convened in 2000 to continue
its work as referred to in paragraph 11 above;

Annex
Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate Inter-
national Terrorism
The General Assembly,
Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism adopted
by the General Assembly by its resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994,
Recalling also the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the
United Nations,
Deeply disturbed by the worldwide persistence of acts of international terrorism in
all its forms and manifestations, including those in which States are directly or
indirectly involved, which endanger or take innocent lives, have a deleterious eﬀect on
international relations and may jeopardize the security of States,
Underlining the importance of States developing extradition agreements or arrange-
ments as necessary in order to ensure that those responsible for terrorist acts are
brought to justice,
Noting that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, done at Geneva on
28 July 1951, does not provide a basis for the protection of perpetrators of terrorist
acts, noting also in this context articles 1, 2, 32 and 33 of the Convention, and
emphasizing in this regard the need for States parties to ensure the proper application
of the Convention,
Stressing the importance of full compliance by States with their obligations under
the provisions of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status
of Refugees, including the principle of non-refoulement of refugees to places where
their life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality,
membership in a particular social group or political opinion, and aﬃrming that the
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  NAT I O N S  G E N E R A L  A S S E M B LY

present Declaration does not aﬀect the protection aﬀorded under the terms of the
Convention and Protocol and other provisions of international law,
Recalling article 4 of the Declaration on Territorial Asylum adopted by the General
Assembly by its resolution 2312 (XXII) of 14 December 1967,
Stressing the need further to strengthen international cooperation between States in
order to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,
Solemnly declares the following:
1.
The States Members of the United Nations solemnly reaﬃrm their unequivocal
condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and
unjustiﬁable, wherever and by whomsoever committed, including those which
jeopardize friendly relations among States and peoples and threaten the territorial
integrity and security of States;
2.
The States Members of the United Nations reaﬃrm that acts, methods and prac-
tices of terrorism are contrary to the purposes and principles of the United
Nations; they declare that knowingly ﬁnancing, planning and inciting terrorist acts
are also contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations;
3.
The States Members of the United Nations reaﬃrm that States should take
appropriate measures in conformity with the relevant provisions of national and
international law, including international standards of human rights, before grant-
ing refugee status, for the purpose of ensuring that the asylum-seeker has not
participated in terrorist acts, considering in this regard relevant information as to
whether the asylum-seeker is subject to investigation for or is charged with or has
been convicted of oﬀences connected with terrorism and, after granting refugee
status, for the purpose of ensuring that that status is not used for the purpose of
preparing or organizing terrorist acts intended to be committed against other
States or their citizens;
4.
The States Members of the United Nations emphasize that asylum seekers who
are awaiting the processing of their asylum applications may not thereby avoid
prosecution for terrorist acts;
5.
The States Members of the United Nations reaﬃrm the importance of ensuring
eﬀective cooperation between Member States so that those who have participated
in terrorist acts, including their ﬁnancing, planning or incitement, are brought to
justice; they stress their commitment, in conformity with the relevant provisions of
international law, including international standards of human rights, to work
together to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism and to take all appropriate
steps under their domestic laws either to extradite terrorists or to submit the cases
to their competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution;
6.
In this context, and while recognizing the sovereign rights of States in extradition
matters, States are encouraged, when concluding or applying extradition agree-
ments, not to regard as political oﬀences excluded from the scope of those agree-
ments oﬀences connected with terrorism which endanger or represent a physical
threat to the safety and security of persons, whatever the motives which may be
invoked to justify them;
7.
States are also encouraged, even in the absence of a treaty, to consider facilitating
the extradition of persons suspected of having committed terrorist acts, insofar as
their national laws permit;

The States Members of the United Nations emphasize the importance of taking
steps to share expertise and information about terrorists, their movements, their
support and their weapons and to share information regarding the investigation
and prosecution of terrorist acts.

Welcoming the conclusion of regional agreements and mutually agreed declarations
to combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,
Convinced of the desirability of keeping under review the scope of existing inter-
national legal provisions to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,
with the aim of ensuring a comprehensive legal framework for the prevention and
elimination of terrorism,
Solemnly declares the following:
1.
The States Members of the United Nations solemnly reaﬃrm their unequivocal
condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, as criminal and
unjustiﬁable, wherever and by whomever committed, including those which jeop-
ardize the friendly relations among States and peoples and threaten the territorial
integrity and security of States;
2.
Acts, methods and practices of terrorism constitute a grave violation of the pur-
poses and principles of the United Nations, which may pose a threat to inter-
national peace and security, jeopardize friendly relations among States, hinder
international cooperation and aim at the destruction of human rights, fundamental
freedoms and the democratic bases of society;
3.
Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general
public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any
circumstance unjustiﬁable, whatever the considerations of a political, philo-
sophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be
invoked to justify them;
4.
States, guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
and other relevant rules of international law, must refrain from organizing, instigat-
ing, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in territories of other States, or from
acquiescing in or encouraging activities within their territories directed towards the
commission of such acts;
5.
States must also fulﬁl their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations
and other provisions of international law with respect to combating international
terrorism and are urged to take eﬀective and resolute measures in accordance
with the relevant provisions of international law and international standards of
human rights for the speedy and ﬁnal elimination of international terrorism, in
particular:
(a) To refrain from organizing, instigating, facilitating, ﬁnancing, encouraging or
tolerating terrorist activities and to take appropriate practical measures to
ensure that their respective territories are not used for terrorist installations

or training camps, or for the preparation or organization of terrorist acts
intended to be committed against other States or their citizens;
(b) To ensure the apprehension and prosecution or extradition of perpetrators of
terrorist acts, in accordance with the relevant provisions of their national law;
(c) To endeavour to conclude special agreements to that eﬀect on a bilateral,
regional and multilateral basis, and to prepare, to that eﬀect, model agreements
on cooperation;
(d) To cooperate with one another in exchanging relevant information concerning
the prevention and combating of terrorism;
(e) To take promptly all steps necessary to implement the existing international
conventions on this subject to which they are parties, including the harmoniza-
tion of their domestic legislation with those conventions;
(f) To take appropriate measures, before granting asylum, for the purpose of
ensuring that the asylum seeker has not engaged in terrorist activities and, after
granting asylum, for the purpose of ensuring that the refugee status is not used
in a manner contrary to the provisions set out in subparagraph (a) above;
6. In order to combat eﬀectively the increase in, and the growing international char-
acter and eﬀects of, acts of terrorism, States should enhance their cooperation in
this area through, in particular, systematizing the exchange of information concern-
ing the prevention and combating of terrorism, as well as by eﬀective implementa-
tion of the relevant international conventions and conclusion of mutual judicial
assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral, regional and multilateral basis;
7. In this context, States are encouraged to review urgently the scope of the existing
international legal provisions on the prevention, repression and elimination of
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, with the aim of ensuring that there is a
comprehensive legal framework covering all aspects of the matter;
8. Furthermore States that have not yet done so are urged to consider, as a matter of
priority, becoming parties to the international conventions and protocols relating
to various aspects of international terrorism referred to in the preamble to the
present Declaration;
9. The United Nations, the relevant specialized agencies and intergovernmental
organizations and other relevant bodies must make every eﬀort with a view to
promoting measures to combat and eliminate acts of terrorism and to strengthening
their role in this ﬁeld;
10. The Secretary-General should assist in the implementation of the present Declar-
ation by taking, within existing resources, the following practical measures to
enhance international cooperation:
(a) A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral,
regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism, including
information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal pro-
secutions and sentencing, based on information received from the depositaries
of those agreements and from Member States;
(b) A compendium of national laws and regulations regarding the prevention and
suppression of international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,
based on information received from Member States;
(c) An analytical review of existing international legal instruments relating to

international terrorism, in order to assist States in identifying aspects of this
matter that have not been covered by such instruments and could be addressed
to develop further a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing
with international terrorism;
(d) A review of existing possibilities within the United Nations system for assisting
States in organizing workshops and training courses on combating crimes
connected with international terrorism;
11. All States are urged to promote and implement in good faith and eﬀectively the
provisions of the present Declaration in all its aspects;
12. Emphasis is placed on the need to pursue eﬀorts aiming at eliminating deﬁnitively
all acts of terrorism by the strengthening of international cooperation and progres-
sive development of international law and its codiﬁcation, as well as by enhance-
ment of coordination between, and increase of the eﬃciency of, the United Nations
and the relevant specialized agencies, organizations and bodies.

Terrorism and human rights
The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights,
Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly
Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the
United Nations and other relevant international instruments on human rights and
humanitarian law,
Recalling the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World
Conference on Human Rights in June 1993,
Aﬃrming that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights
and fundamental freedoms, and that every individual should strive to secure their
universal and eﬀective recognition and observance,
Bearing in mind that the most essential and basic human right is the right to life,
Bearing in mind also that terrorism in many cases poses a severe challenge to
democracy, civil society and the rule of law,
Bearing in mind further that terrorism creates an environment that destroys the free-
dom from fear of the people,
Profoundly deploring the increasing number of innocent persons killed and maimed
by terrorists in indiscriminate and random acts of violence and terror, which cannot be
justiﬁed under any circumstances,
Mindful that acts of terrorism, in all their forms and manifestations, aimed at the
destruction of human rights have continued despite the eﬀorts and measures taken at
the international, regional and national levels,
Recalling its resolution 1998/29,

When any person has been disembarked in accordance with Article 8, paragraph 1,

to admit him, that State may, if the person in question is not a national or perma-
nent resident of that State, return him to the territory of the State of which he is a

journey by air.
2.
Neither disembarkation, nor delivery, nor the taking of custody or other measures
contemplated in Article 13, paragraph 2, nor return of the person concerned, shall
be considered as admission to the territory of the Contracting State concerned for
the purpose of its law relating to entry or admission of persons and nothing in this
Convention shall aﬀect the law of a Contracting State relating to the expulsion of
persons from its territory.
Article 15

criminal proceedings.

Without prejudice to its law as to entry and admission to, and extradition and
expulsion from its territory, a Contracting State in whose territory a person has
been disembarked in accordance with Article 8, paragraph 1, or delivered in
accordance with Article 9, paragraph 1 or has disembarked and is suspected of
having committed an act contemplated in Article 11, paragraph 1, shall accord to
such person treatment which is no less favourable for his protection and security
than that accorded to nationals of such Contracting State in like circumstances.
Chapter VI

Oﬀences committed on aircraft registered in a Contracting State shall be treated,
for the purpose of extradition, as if they had been committed not only in the place
in which they have occurred but also in the territory of the State of registration of

Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, nothing in this
Convention shall be deemed to create an obligation to grant extradition.

Have agreed as follows:

door is opened for disembarkation; in the case of a forced landing, the ﬂight shall
be deemed to continue until the competent authorities take over the responsibility
for the aircraft and for persons and property on board;

ation of the aircraft by ground personnel or by the crew for a speciﬁc ﬂight until

The States Parties to this Convention,
Having in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of
friendly relations and co-operation among States,
Recognizing in particular that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of
person, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
Reaﬃrming the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples as
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles
of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States
in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, as well as in other relevant
resolutions of the General Assembly,
Considering that the taking of hostages is an oﬀence of grave concern to the inter-
national community and that, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, any
person committing an act of hostage taking shall either be prosecuted or extradited,
Being convinced that it is urgently necessary to develop international cooperation
between States in devising and adopting eﬀective measures for the prevention, prosecu-
tion and punishment of all acts of taking of hostages as manifestations of international
terrorism,
Have agreed as follows:
Article 1
1.
Any person who seizes or detains and threatens to kill, to injure or to continue to
detain another person (hereinafter referred to as the ‘hostage’) in order to compel a
third party, namely, a State, an international intergovernmental organization, a nat-
ural or juridical person, or a group of persons, to do or abstain from doing any act as
an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the hostage commits the oﬀence of
taking of hostages (‘hostagetaking’) within the meaning of this Convention.
2.
Any person who:
(a) Attempts to commit an act of hostage-taking, or
(b) Participates as an accomplice of anyone who commits or attempts to commit
an act of hostage-taking
likewise commits an oﬀence for the purposes of this Convention.
Article 2
Each State Party shall make the oﬀences set forth in article 1 punishable by appropriate

take all measures it considers appropriate to ease the situation of the hostage, in
particular, to secure his release and, after his release, to facilitate, when relevant, his
departure.
2.
If any object which the oﬀender has obtained as a result of the taking of hostages
comes into the custody of a State Party, that State Party shall return it as soon as
possible to the hostage or the third party referred to in article 1, as the case may be,
or to the appropriate authorities thereof.
Article 4
States Parties shall co-operate in the prevention of the oﬀences set forth in article 1,
particularly by:
(a) Taking all practicable measures to prevent preparations in their respective territor-

ing measures to prohibit in their territories illegal activities of persons, groups and
organizations that encourage, instigate, organize or engage in the perpetration of
acts of taking of hostages;

it appropriate.

CONSIDERING that unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation jeop-
ardize the safety of persons and property, seriously aﬀect the operation of maritime
services, and undermine the conﬁdence of the peoples of the world in the safety of
maritime navigation,
CONSIDERING that the occurrence of such acts is a matter of grave concern to
the international community as a whole,
BEING CONVINCED of the urgent need to develop international co-operation
between States in devising and adopting eﬀective and practical measures for the
prevention of all unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation, and the
prosecution and punishment of their perpetrators,
RECALLING resolution 40/61 of the General Assembly of the United Nations of
9 December 1985 which, inter alia, ‘urges all States unilaterally and in co-operation
with other States, as well as relevant United Nations organs, to contribute to the pro-
gressive elimination of causes underlying international terrorism and to pay special
attention to all situations, including colonialism, racism and situations involving mass
and ﬂagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and those involv-
ing alien occupation, that may give rise to international terrorism and may endanger
international peace and security’,
RECALLING FURTHER that resolution 40/61 ‘unequivocally condemns, as crim-
inal, all acts, methods and practices of terrorism wherever and by whomever commit-
ted, including those which jeopardize friendly relations among States and their
security’,
RECALLING ALSO that by resolution 40/61, the International Maritime Organ-
ization was invited to ‘study the problem of terrorism aboard or against ships with a
view to making recommendations on appropriate measures’,
HAVING IN MIND resolution A.584(14) of 20 November 1985, of the Assembly
of the International Maritime Organization, which called for development of measures
to prevent unlawful acts which threaten the safety of ships and the security of their
passengers and crews,
NOTING that acts of the crew which are subject to normal shipboard discipline are
outside the purview of this Convention,
AFFIRMING the desirability of monitoring rules and standards relating to the
prevention and control of unlawful acts against ships and persons on board ships, with
a view to updating them as necessary, and, to this eﬀect, taking note with satisfaction
of the Measures to Prevent Unlawful Acts against Passengers and Crews on Board
Ships, recommended by the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime
Organization,
AFFIRMING FURTHER that matters not regulated by this Convention continue
to be governed by the rules and principles of general international law,
RECOGNIZING the need for all States, in combating unlawful acts against the
safety of maritime navigation, strictly to comply with rules and principles of general
international law,
HAVE AGREED as follows:

which have established jurisdiction in accordance with article [6] and which decides
not to prosecute shall, in selecting the State to which the oﬀender or alleged oﬀender

11. International Convention for the Suppression
of Terrorist Bombings
The States Parties to this Convention,
Having in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of
good-neighbourliness and friendly relations and cooperation among States,
Deeply concerned about the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism in all its forms
and manifestations,
Recalling the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United
Nations of 24 October 1995,
Recalling also the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism,
annexed to General Assembly resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994, in which, inter
alia, ‘the States Members of the United Nations solemnly reaﬃrm their unequivocal
condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustiﬁ-
able, wherever and by whomever committed, including those which jeopardize the
friendly relations among States and peoples and threaten the territorial integrity and
security of States’,
Noting that the Declaration also encouraged States ‘to review urgently the scope of
the existing international legal provisions on the prevention, repression and elimin-
ation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, with the aim of ensuring that
there is a comprehensive legal framework covering all aspects of the matter’,
Recalling further General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996 and
the Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate
International Terrorism, annexed thereto,
Noting also that terrorist attacks by means of explosives or other lethal devices have
become increasingly widespread,
Noting further that existing multilateral legal provisions do not adequately address
these attacks,
Being convinced of the urgent need to enhance international cooperation between
States in devising and adopting eﬀective and practical measures for the prevention of
such acts of terrorism, and for the prosecution and punishment of their perpetrators,
Considering that the occurrence of such acts is a matter of grave concern to the
international community as a whole,
Noting that the activities of military forces of States are governed by rules of inter-
national law outside the framework of this Convention and that the exclusion of cer-
tain actions from the coverage of this Convention does not condone or make lawful
otherwise unlawful acts, or preclude prosecution under other laws,
Have agreed as follows:

Upon being satisﬁed that the circumstances so warrant, the State Party in whose
territory the oﬀender or alleged oﬀender is present shall take the appropriate

purpose of prosecution or extradition.
3.
Any person regarding whom the measures referred to in paragraph 2 are being
taken shall be entitled to:

469
 

oﬀender is present, subject to the provision that the said laws and regulations must

The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be without prejudice to the right of

contemplated in paragraph 1 shall promptly inform the said States Parties of its
ﬁndings and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction.
Article 8
1.
The State Party in the territory of which the alleged oﬀender is present shall, in

without exception whatsoever and whether or not the oﬀence was committed in its
territory, to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for
the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with the laws of
that State. Those authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the
case of any other oﬀence of a grave nature under the law of that State.
2.
Whenever a State Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or other-
wise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will
be returned to that State to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial
or proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought,
and this State and the State seeking the extradition of the person agree with
this option and other terms they may deem appropriate, such a conditional
extradition or surrender shall be suﬃcient to discharge the obligation set forth in
paragraph 1.
Article 9
1.
The oﬀences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable
oﬀences in any extradition treaty existing between any of the States Parties before
the entry into force of this Convention. States Parties undertake to include such
oﬀences as extraditable oﬀences in every extradition treaty to be subsequently
concluded between them.
2.
When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a
treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has
no extradition treaty, the requested State Party may, at its option, consider this
Convention as a legal basis for extradition in respect of the oﬀences set forth in
article 2. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of
the requested State.

3.
States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a
treaty shall recognize the oﬀences set forth in article 2 as extraditable oﬀences
between themselves, subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested
State.
4.
If necessary, the oﬀences set forth in article 2 shall be treated, for the purposes
of extradition between States Parties, as if they had been committed not only in
the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of the States that have
established jurisdiction in accordance with article 6, paragraphs 1 and 2.
5.

with regard to oﬀences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be modiﬁed as
between State Parties to the extent that they are incompatible with this Convention.

States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 in conformity
with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance that may exist
between them. In the absence of such treaties or arrangements, States Parties shall
aﬀord one another assistance in accordance with their domestic law.
Article 11
None of the oﬀences set forth in article 2 shall be regarded, for the purposes of extradi-
tion or mutual legal assistance, as a political oﬀence or as an oﬀence connected with a
political oﬀence or as an oﬀence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request
for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such an oﬀence may not be
refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political oﬀence or an oﬀence connected
with a political oﬀence or an oﬀence inspired by political motives.
Article 12
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite
or to aﬀord mutual legal assistance, if the requested State Party has substantial
grounds for believing that the request for extradition for oﬀences set forth in article 2
or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such oﬀences has been made for the
purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person’s race,
religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the
request would cause prejudice to that person’s position for any of these reasons.
Article 13
1.
A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State
Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of testimony,
identiﬁcation or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for the

471
 

investigation or prosecution of oﬀences under this Convention may be transferred

those States may deem appropriate.

gation to keep the person transferred in custody, unless otherwise requested
or authorized by the State from which the person was transferred;

of the State to which he was transferred.
3.

this article so agrees, that person, whatever his or her nationality, shall not be
prosecuted or detained or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal
liberty in the territory of the State to which that person is transferred in respect of
acts or convictions anterior to his or her departure from the territory of the State
from which such person was transferred.
Article 14
Any person who is taken into custody or regarding whom any other measures are taken
or proceedings are carried out pursuant to this Convention shall be guaranteed fair

international law, including international law of human rights.

legislation, to prevent and counter preparations in their respective territories for the

to prohibit in their territories illegal activities of persons, groups and organizations
that encourage, instigate, organize, knowingly ﬁnance or engage in the perpetration
of oﬀences as set forth in article 2;

tion of explosives and other harmful substances that can cause death or bodily

on preventive measures, cooperation and transfer of technology, equipment and
related materials.

stood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are
not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by military forces
of a State in the exercise of their oﬃcial duties, inasmuch as they are governed by
other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.

12. International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism (1999)
Preamble
The States Parties to this Convention,
Bearing in mind the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations
concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of
goodneighbourliness and friendly relations and cooperation among States,
Deeply concerned about the worldwide escalation of acts of terrorism in all its forms
and manifestations,
Recalling the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United
Nations, contained in General Assembly resolution 50/6 of 24 October 1995,
Recalling also all the relevant General Assembly resolutions on the matter, including
resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994 and its annex on the Declaration on Measures to
Eliminate International Terrorism, in which the States Members of the United Nations
solemnly reaﬃrmed their unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices
of terrorism as criminal and unjustiﬁable, wherever and by whomever committed,
including those which jeopardize the friendly relations among States and peoples and
threaten the territorial integrity and security of States,
Noting that the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism also
encouraged States to review urgently the scope of the existing international legal provi-
sions on the prevention, repression and elimination of terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations, with the aim of ensuring that there is a comprehensive legal framework
covering all aspects of the matter,
Recalling General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, paragraph 3,
subparagraph (f), in which the Assembly called upon all States to take steps to prevent
and counteract, through appropriate domestic measures, the ﬁnancing of terrorists and
terrorist organizations, whether such ﬁnancing is direct or indirect through organiza-
tions which also have or claim to have charitable, social or cultural goals or which are
also engaged in unlawful activities such as illicit arms traﬃcking, drug dealing and
racketeering, including the exploitation of persons for purposes of funding terrorist
activities, and in particular to consider, where appropriate, adopting regulatory measures
to prevent and counteract movements of funds suspected to be intended for terrorist
purposes without impeding in any way the freedom of legitimate capital movements
and to intensify the exchange of information concerning international movements of
such funds,
Recalling also General Assembly resolution 52/165 of 15 December 1997, in which
the Assembly called upon States to consider, in particular, the implementation of the
measures set out in paragraphs 3 (a) to (f) of its resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996,
Recalling further General Assembly resolution 53/108 of 8 December 1998, in which
the Assembly decided that the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly
resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996 should elaborate a draft international con-
vention for the suppression of terrorist ﬁnancing to supplement related existing
international instruments,
Considering that the ﬁnancing of terrorism is a matter of grave concern to the
international community as a whole,
U N  C O N V E N T I O N S  O N  T E R RO R I S M
475
 

Noting that the number and seriousness of acts of international terrorism depend on
the ﬁnancing that terrorists may obtain,
Noting also that existing multilateral legal instruments do not expressly address such
ﬁnancing,
Being convinced of the urgent need to enhance international cooperation among
States in devising and adopting eﬀective measures for the prevention of the ﬁnancing
of terrorism, as well as for its suppression through the prosecution and punishment of
its perpetrators,
Have agreed as follows:

they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out:
(a) An act which constitutes an oﬀence within the scope of and as deﬁned in one
of the treaties listed in the annex; or
(b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or
to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of

organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.
2.
(a) On depositing its instrument of ratiﬁcation, acceptance, approval or accession,
a State Party which is not a party to a treaty listed in the annex may declare
that, in the application of this Convention to the State Party, the treaty shall be

criminal, civil or administrative sanctions. Such sanctions may include monetary

Any person regarding whom the measures referred to in paragraph 2 are being
taken shall be entitled to:

479

enable full eﬀect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under
paragraph 3 are intended.

When a State Party, pursuant to the present article, has taken a person into custody,
it shall immediately notify, directly or through the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, the States Parties which have established jurisdiction in accordance with
article 7, paragraph 1 or 2, and, if it considers it advisable, any other interested
States Parties, of the fact that such person is in custody and of the circumstances
which warrant that person’s detention. The State which makes the investigation
contemplated in paragraph 1 shall promptly inform the said States Parties of its
ﬁndings and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction.
Article 10
1.
The State Party in the territory of which the alleged oﬀender is present shall, in

without exception whatsoever and whether or not the oﬀence was committed in its
territory, to submit the case without undue delay to its competent authorities for
the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with the laws of
that State. Those authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the
case of any other oﬀence of a grave nature under the law of that State.

be returned to that State to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or
proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought, and
this State and the State seeking the extradition of the person agree with this
option and other terms they may deem appropriate, such a conditional extra-
dition or surrender shall be suﬃcient to discharge the obligation set forth in
paragraph 1.

2.
When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a

the requested State.

with a political oﬀence or an oﬀence inspired by political motives.
Article 15
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite

or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such oﬀences has been made for the
purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person’s race,
religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the
request would cause prejudice to that person’s position for any of these reasons.
Article 16
1.
A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State
Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of identiﬁca-

criminal activity. For this purpose, States Parties shall consider:

directors and provisions regulating the power to bind the entity;

procedures, they shall endeavour:
I. Preventive measure
1.
To prevent the use of their territories as a base for planning, organizing, executing,
attempting or taking part in terrorist crime in any manner whatsoever. This

To develop and strengthen systems for the detection of the movement, import-
ation, exportation, stockpilling and use of weapons, munitions and explosives and

those of each State in accordance with its information policy, with a view to expos-
ing the objectives of terrorist groups and organizations, thwarting their schemes
and demonstrating the danger they pose to security and stability;
8.
To establish, in each Contracting State, a database for the accumulation and
analysis of information relating to terrorist elements, groups, movements and
organizations and for the monitoring of developments with respect to the terrorist

We, the Heads and Members of the delegations of the Member States of the League of
Arab States, participating in the proceedings of the Arab Regional Symposium on
Combating Terrorism, held from 16 to 17 February 2005 in Cairo. Expressing our
gratitude to the General-Secretariat of the League of Arab States and the United
Nations Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Regional Oﬃce for the Middle East
and North Africa for organizing the Arab Regional Symposium on Combating Terror-
ism in order to coordinate international, regional, and sub-regional eﬀorts to combat
terrorism, and enhance the means of international cooperation in this ﬁeld, in accord-
ance with the relevant international and regional instruments and Security Council
resolutions pertinent to combating terrorism:
Expressing our desire to forge partnerships with international and regional organiza-
tions and fully integrate our eﬀorts in international endeavors geared at unifying eﬀorts
for combating terrorism, based on the collective responsibility and the participation of
all the sectors of the community and their cooperation with the relevant competent
authorities:
Expressing our grave concern about the increasing terrorist acts in the region and at
the international level, threatening the stability and security of the Arab communities,
jeopardizes the rule of law, democratic institutions, and social values, and impede and
paralyze development and reform programmes. Aﬃrming that terrorism threatens
international peace and security, and that all forms of terrorism should be condemned
and confronted by eﬀecting a global strategy aimed at the reform and development of
criminal justice systems and security institutions and mobilizing concerted eﬀorts at
the international level under the auspices and constant attention of the United Nations:
Aﬃrming that combating terrorism is not limited only to the adoption of legislative
and security measures, rather, it should be coupled with a preventive approach aiming
at eradicating extremism and activating a culture of dialogue, through the potential
role of religious and educational institutions as well as the mass media:
Recalling Security Council resolutions on the threat to international peace and
security as a result of evil terrorist acts, particularly resolutions 1267 (1999), 1373
(2001), 1535 (2004), 1540 (2004) and 1566 (2004):
Strongly emphasizing that combating terrorism should be in the context of respecting
human rights and the rule of law:
Recalling relevant General Assembly resolutions pertinent to the right of the people
for self-determination, especially resolution 1514 (1960): Considering the importance
of meeting the obligations contained in the international and regional instruments
AC T I O N  B Y  R E G I O NA L  O RG A N I S AT I O N S  O U T S I D E  E U RO P E
517
 

pertinent to combating terrorism, which have been ratiﬁed or acceded thereto, includ-
ing the Arab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism (1998), the Convention
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference on Combating Terrorism (1999), the
African Union Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism (1999), and

Welcoming the participation of the Assistant Secretary-General, the Director of the
Executive Directorate of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)
established by Security Council resolution 1535 (2004), to the Arab Regional
Symposium on Combating Terrorism, and appreciating the earnest and fruitful dia-
logue between the CTC and the representatives and experts of the Arab countries
regarding the implementation of the measures established by Security Council reso-
lution 1373 (2001), stemming from the concern of Arab countries to continue their
dialogue in light of their obligation to support the eﬀorts of the CTC and its Executive
Directorate:
Appreciating the eﬀorts exerted by the Arab States in the ﬁeld of preventing and
combating terrorism, the experiences presented in the Symposium and the reports
submitted as related to the CTC:
Commending the role of the UNODC Regional Oﬃce for the Middle East and
North Africa in the ﬁeld of crime prevention and criminal justice in general, and its
endeavors in coordinating eﬀorts at the regional and sub-regional levels in the ﬁeld of
combating terrorism and organized crime and endorsing the Regional Action Plan
prepared by the Regional Oﬃce, and encouraging Member States to cooperate with the
Regional Oﬃce to give errect to the provisions of the Regional Action Plan:
Reaﬃrming our commitments to prevent and combat terrorism worldwide and in
our region, as one of the most seriously harmed by terrorism and its direct or indirect
consequences and links, including transnational organized crime.
Recommend the following:
1.

vations and justiﬁcations, and coordinate eﬀorts in order to halt terrorist acts at all
international levels, reaﬃrming that terrorism does not belong to any speciﬁc
religion, nationality or geographic location, and determining to assist all parties
not to permit the use of their territories for terrorist purposes, and prevent terrorist
organizations from obtaining arms or funds;
2.
Striving to complete the negotiations of the draft United Nations Comprehensive
Convention on Combating Terrorism aiming to reach an international deﬁnition
of terrorism which takes into account the diﬀerence between terrorism and the
legitimate right to resist occupation, bearing in mind that the killing of innocent
civilians is condemned by all religions and international conventions;
3.
Considering the United Nations as the cornerstone for the uniﬁcation of cooper-
ation eﬀorts for combating terrorism, and commending the role of its main organs,
especially the CTC and its Executive Directorate and the Terrorism Prevention
Branch of the UNODC, and beneﬁting from the advisory services and technical
assistance provided by these organs and donors;
4.
Calling for the adoption of appropriate measures to prevent terrorists from poss-
essing mass destruction weapons or any of the components thereof: emphasizing

7. ASEAN Declaration on Joint Action to Counter
Terrorism (2001)
We, the Heads of State/Government of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) gathered in Bandar Seri Begawan for the Seventh ASEAN Summit,
Recalling the agreement among Heads of State/Government during the Second
Informal Summit in December 1997 in Kuala Lumpur to take ﬁrm and stern measures
to combat transnational crime,
Reaﬃrming our primary responsibility in ensuring the peaceful and progressive
development of our respective countries and our region,
Deeply concerned over the formidable challenge posed by terrorism to regional and
international peace and stability as well as to economic development,
Underlining the importance of strengthening regional and international cooperation
in meeting the challenges confronting us,
Do hereby,
Unequivocally condemn in the strongest terms the horrifying terrorist attacks in New
York City, Washington DC and Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001 and consider such
acts as an attack against humanity and an assault on all of us;
Extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the people and Government of the
United States of America and the families of the victims from nations all around the
world, including those of our nationals;
View acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed wherever,
whenever and by whomsoever, as a profound threat to international peace and security
which require concerted action to protect and defend all peoples and the peace and
security of the world;
Reject any attempt to link terrorism with any religion or race;
Believe terrorism to be a direct challenge to the attainment of peace, progress and
prosperity of ASEAN and the realisation of ASEAN Vision 2020;
Commit to counter, prevent and suppress all forms of terrorist acts in accordance
with the Charter of the United Nations and other international law, especially taking

speciﬁc circumstances in the region and in each member country;
Recommit ourselves to pursue eﬀective policies and strategies aimed at enhancing
the well-being of our people, which will be our national contribution in the ﬁght
against terrorism;

ing transnational crime and adopted an ASEAN Plan of Action that outlines a
cohesive regional strategy to prevent, control and neutralise transnational crime;

Approve fully the initiatives of the Third ASEAN Ministers Meeting on
Transnational Crime (AMMTC) held in October 2001 to focus on terrorism and deal
eﬀectively with the issue at all levels and endorse the convening of an Ad Hoc Experts
Group Meeting and special sessions of the SOMTC and AMMTC that will focus on
terrorism;
Warmly welcome Malaysia’s oﬀer to host the Special AMMTC on issues of terror-
ism in April 2002. This meeting would represent a signiﬁcant step by ASEAN to the
United Nations’ call to enhance coordination of national, sub-regional and inter-
national eﬀorts to strengthen a global response to this serious challenge and threat to
international security;
In strengthening further ASEAN’s counter-terrorism eﬀorts, we task our Ministers
concerned to follow-up on the implementation of this declaration to advance ASEAN’s
eﬀorts to ﬁght terrorism by undertaking the following additional practical measures.
1.
Review and strengthen our national mechanisms to combat terrorism;
2.
Call for the early signing/ratiﬁcation of or accession to all relevant anti-terrorist
conventions including the International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism;
3.
Deepen cooperation among our front-line law enforcement agencies in combatting
terrorism and sharing ‘best practices’;
4.
Study relevant international conventions on terrorism with the view to integrating
them with ASEAN mechanisms on combating international terrorism;
5.
Enhance information/intelligence exchange to facilitate the ﬂow of information, in
particular, on terrorists and terrorist organisations, their movement and funding,
and any other information needed to protect lives, property and the security of all
modes of travel;
6.
Strengthen existing cooperation and coordination between the AMMTC and other
relevant ASEAN bodies in countering, preventing and suppressing all forms of
terrorists acts. Particular attention would be paid to ﬁnding ways to combat terror-
ist organisations, support infrastructure and funding and bringing the perpetrators
to justice;
7.
Develop regional capacity building programmes to enhance existing capabilities of
ASEAN member countries to investigate, detect, monitor and report on terrorist
acts;
8.
Discuss and explore practical ideas and initiatives to increase ASEAN’s role in and
involvement with the international community including extra-regional partners
within existing frameworks such as the ASEAN + 3, the ASEAN Dialogue Part-
ners and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), to make the ﬁght against terrorism a
truly regional and global endeavour;
9.
Strengthen cooperation at bilateral, regional and international levels in combating
terrorism in a comprehensive manner and aﬃrm that at the international level the
United Nations should play a major role in this regard.
We, the Leaders of ASEAN, pledge to remain seized with the matter, and call on other
regions and countries to work with ASEAN in the global struggle against terrorism.

8. ASEAN–EU Joint Declaration on Co-operation to Combat
Terrorism (2003)
1.
We the Foreign Ministers of the European Union (EU) and the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), at our meeting in Brussels 27–28 January
2003, reaﬃrm our commitment to combat terrorism, which constitute a profound
threat to stability, peace and security in our regions and beyond.
2.
We stress the leading role of the UN in the ﬁght against terrorism and reaﬃrm our
strong commitment to the universal implementation of all the UN anti-terrorism
resolutions and conventions and remain fully committed to supporting the work
of the UN Counter Terrorism Committee and other pertinent UN bodies. We
acknowledge that the ﬁght against terrorism must be conducted in accordance with
international obligations, the UN Charter and general norms of international law,
including respect for human rights and humanitarian law.
3.
We reject any attempt to associate terrorism with any religion, race or nationality,
and stress that in the aftermath of the attacks of 11 September 2001 and in
other parts of the world, the need to strengthen dialogue and promote mutual
understanding between cultures and civilisations is greater than ever before.
4.
We acknowledge that terrorism, including its links with trans-national organised
crime, such as money laundering, arms-traﬃcking and the production of and traf-
ﬁcking in illicit drugs, as well as illegal movements of nuclear, chemical, biological
and other potentially deadly materials, forms part of a complex set of new security
challenges, which have to be addressed urgently in all aspects and in all fora,
including the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
5.
The trans-boundary character of terrorism calls for an international response.
The ﬁght against terrorism requires a comprehensive approach by the international
community comprising political, economic, diplomatic, military, and legal means
in accordance with our respective domestic laws, duly taking into account root
causes of terrorism without acknowledging these as justiﬁcations for terrorist
and/or criminal activities. We are determined to develop further EU–ASEAN
regional co-operation. Furthermore, we note the progress made towards implemen-
tation of the series of activities agreed in the ASEM Copenhagen Co-operation
Programme on Fighting Terrorism of September 2002 and agree to take further
urgent steps in this process, with a view to the full implementation of these
measures.
6.
We are determined to enhance our co-operation to ﬁght terrorism, most notably in
the following areas:
•
Universal implementation of all existing United Nations Security Council
Resolutions related to terrorism, in particular resolution 1373 (2001), 1377
(2001) and 1390 (2002);
•
Universal implementation of all existing United Nations Conventions and
Protocols against terrorism and encouraging the States to comply with them
and to take eﬀective measures to prevent and combat terrorism, and in
particular to prevent and combat the ﬁnancing of terrorism.
•
Early conclusion and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on Inter-
national Terrorism and the International Convention for the Suppression of
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.
AC T I O N  B Y  R E G I O NA L  O RG A N I S AT I O N S  O U T S I D E  E U RO P E
521
 

•
Early entry into force of the United Nations Convention against Trans-national
Organised Crime and its protocols.
•
Exchange of information on measures in the ﬁght against terrorism, including
on the development of more eﬀective policies and legal, regulatory and
administrative frameworks for the ﬁght against terrorism.
•
Strengthening links between Law Enforcement agencies of EU and ASEAN
member states, as well as with EUROPOL and ASEANAPOL, to promote
practical co-operation on counter terrorism and organised crime.
•
Co-operation to build capacity to assist ASEAN members to implement
UNSCR 1373, and to address the impact of terrorist activities.
7.
In this regard, we welcome the recent establishment of the South-East Asia
Regional Centre for Counter Terrorism in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
8.
We agree that our progress in this ﬁeld will be assessed at the next EU–ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting on the basis of a joint report.

Related Extortion that are of International Signiﬁcance (1971)
WHEREAS:
The defense of freedom and justice and respect for the fundamental rights of
the individual that are recognized by the American Declaration of the Rights and
Duties of Man and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are primary duties
of states;
The General Assembly of the Organization, in Resolution 4, of June 30, 1970,
strongly condemned acts of terrorism, especially the kidnaping of persons and extortion
in connection with that crime, which it declared to be serious common crimes;
Criminal acts against persons entitled to special protection under international law
are occurring frequently, and those acts are of international signiﬁcance because of the
consequences that may ﬂow from them for relations among states;
It is advisable to adopt general standards that will progressively develop inter-
national law as regards cooperation in the prevention and punishment of such acts; and

of Terrorism (1987)
THE MEMBER STATES OF THE SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION FOR
REGIONAL COOPERATION (SAARC)
Mindful of the principles of cooperation enshrined in the SAARC Charter;
Recalling that at the Dhaka Summit on December 7–8, 1985, the Heads of State or
Government of the Member States of the SAARC recognized the seriousness of the
problem of terrorism as it aﬀects the security and stability of the region;
Also recalling the Bangalore Summit Declaration of 17 November 1986, in which the
Heads of State or Government of SAARC agreed that cooperation among SAARC
States was vital if terrorism was to be prevented and eliminated from the region;
unequivocally condemned all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and
deplored their impact on life and property, socio-economic development, political sta-
bility, regional and international peace and cooperation, and recognized the importance
of the principles laid down in UN Resolution 2625 (XXV) which among others required
that each state should refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in
acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another state or acquiescing organized activities
within its territory directed towards the commission of such acts;
Aware of the danger posed by the spread of terrorism and its harmful eﬀect on
peace, cooperation, friendship and good neighbourly relations and which could also
jeopardize the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states;
Have resolved to take eﬀective measures to ensure that perpetrators of terroristic
acts do not escape prosecution and punishment by providing for their extradition or
prosecution, and to this end,
Have agreed as follows:

ACTION BY THE COUNCIL
OF EUROPE
1. European Convention on Extradition (13 December 1957)
The governments signatory hereto, being members of the Council of Europe,
Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity
between its members;
Considering that this purpose can be attained by the conclusion of agreements and
by common action in legal matters;
Considering that the acceptance of uniform rules with regard to extradition is likely
to assist this work of uniﬁcation,
Have agreed as follows:
Article 1
Obligation to extradite
The Contracting Parties undertake to surrender to each other, subject to the provisions
and conditions laid down in this Convention, all persons against whom the competent
authorities of the requesting Party are proceeding for an oﬀence or who are wanted by
the said authorities for the carrying out of a sentence or detention order.
Article 2
Extraditable oﬀences
1.
Extradition shall be granted in respect of oﬀences punishable under the laws of the
requesting Party and of the requested Party by deprivation of liberty or under a
detention order for a maximum period of at least one year or by a more severe
penalty. Where a conviction and prison sentence have occurred or a detention order
has been made in the territory of the requesting Party, the punishment awarded
must have been for a period of at least four months.
2.
If the request for extradition includes several separate oﬀences each of which is
punishable under the laws of the requesting Party and the requested Party by
deprivation of liberty or under a detention order, but of which some do not fulﬁl
the condition with regard to the amount of punishment which may be awarded,
the requested Party shall also have the right to grant extradition for the latter
oﬀences.
3.
Any Contracting Party whose law does not allow extradition for certain of the
561
 

oﬀences referred to in paragraph 1 of this article may, in so far as it is concerned,
exclude such oﬀences from the application of this Convention.
4.
Any Contracting Party which wishes to avail itself of the right provided for in
paragraph 3 of this article shall, at the time of deposit of its instrument of ratiﬁca-
tion or accession, transmit to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe
either a list of the oﬀences for which extradition is allowed or a list of those for
which it is excluded and shall at the same time indicate the legal provisions which
allow or exclude extradition. The Secretary General of the Council shall forward
these lists to the other signatories.
5.
If extradition is subsequently excluded in respect of other oﬀences by the law of a
Contracting Party, that Party shall notify the Secretary General. The Secretary
General shall inform the other signatories. Such notiﬁcation shall not take eﬀect
until three months from the date of its receipt by the Secretary General.
6.
Any Party which avails itself of the right provided for in paragraphs 4 or 5 of this
article may at any time apply this Convention to oﬀences which have been excluded
from it. It shall inform the Secretary General of the Council of such changes, and
the Secretary General shall inform the other signatories.
7.
Any Party may apply reciprocity in respect of any oﬀences excluded from the
application of the Convention under this article.
Article 3
Political oﬀences
1.
Extradition shall not be granted if the oﬀence in respect of which it is requested is
regarded by the requested Party as a political oﬀence or as an oﬀence connected
with a political oﬀence.
2.
The same rule shall apply if the requested Party has substantial grounds for believ-
ing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal oﬀence has been made
for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race,
religion, nationality or political opinion, or that that person’s position may be
prejudiced for any of these reasons.
3.
The taking or attempted taking of the life of a Head of State or a member of
his family shall not be deemed to be a political oﬀence for the purposes of this
Convention.
4.
This article shall not aﬀect any obligations which the Contracting Parties may
have undertaken or may undertake under any other international convention of a
multilateral character.
Article 4
Military oﬀences
Extradition for oﬀences under military law which are not oﬀences under ordinary
criminal law is excluded from the application of this Convention.

Article 5
Fiscal oﬀences
Extradition shall be granted, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, for
oﬀences in connection with taxes, duties, customs and exchange only if the Contracting
Parties have so decided in respect of any such oﬀence or category of oﬀences.
Article 6
Extradition of nationals
1.
(a) A Contracting Party shall have the right to refuse extradition of its nationals.
(b) Each Contracting Party may, by a declaration made at the time of signature or
of deposit of its instrument of ratiﬁcation or accession, deﬁne as far as it is
concerned the term ‘nationals’ within the meaning of this Convention.
(c) Nationality shall be determined as at the time of the decision concerning
extradition. If, however, the person claimed is ﬁrst recognised as a national of
the requested Party during the period between the time of the decision and
the time contemplated for the surrender, the requested Party may avail itself of
the provision contained in sub-paragraph (a) of this article.
2.
If the requested Party does not extradite its national, it shall at the request of the
requesting Party submit the case to its competent authorities in order that proceed-
ings may be taken if they are considered appropriate. For this purpose, the ﬁles,
information and exhibits relating to the oﬀence shall be transmitted without charge
by the means provided for in Article 12, paragraph 1. The requesting Party shall be
informed of the result of its request.
Article 7
Place of commission
1.
The requested Party may refuse to extradite a person claimed for an oﬀence which
is regarded by its law as having been committed in whole or in part in its territory or
in a place treated as its territory.
2.
When the oﬀence for which extradition is requested has been committed outside
the territory of the requesting Party, extradition may only be refused if the law of
the requested Party does not allow prosecution for the same category of oﬀence
when committed outside the latter Party’s territory or does not allow extradition
for the oﬀence concerned.
Article 8
Pending proceedings for the same oﬀences
The requested Party may refuse to extradite the person claimed if the competent
authorities of such Party are proceeding against him in respect of the oﬀence or
oﬀences for which extradition is requested.

Article 9
Non bis in idem
Extradition shall not be granted if ﬁnal judgment has been passed by the competent
authorities of the requested Party upon the person claimed in respect of the oﬀence or
oﬀences for which extradition is requested. Extradition may be refused if the com-
petent authorities of the requested Party have decided either not to institute or to
terminate proceedings in respect of the same oﬀence or oﬀences.
Article 10
Lapse of time
Extradition shall not be granted when the person claimed has, according to the law
of either the requesting or the requested Party, become immune by reason of lapse
of time from prosecution or punishment.
Article 11
Capital punishment
If the oﬀence for which extradition is requested is punishable by death under the law of
the requesting Party, and if in respect of such oﬀence the death-penalty is not provided
for by the law of the requested Party or is not normally carried out, extradition may
be refused unless the requesting Party gives such assurance as the requested Party
considers suﬃcient that the death-penalty will not be carried out.
Article 12
The request and supporting documents
1.
The request shall be in writing and shall be communicated through the diplomatic
channel. Other means of communication may be arranged by direct agreement
between two or more Parties.

tion order immediately enforceable or of the warrant of arrest or other order
having the same eﬀect and issued in accordance with the procedure laid down
in the law of the requesting Party;

place of their commission, their legal descriptions and a reference to the
relevant legal provisions shall be set out as accurately as possible; and
(c) a copy of the relevant enactments or, where this is not possible, a statement
of the relevant law and as accurate a description as possible of the person
claimed, together with any other information which will help to establish his
identity and nationality.

Article 13
Supplementary information
If the information communicated by the requesting Party is found to be insuﬃcient
to allow the requested Party to make a decision in pursuance of this Convention,
the latter Party shall request the necessary supplementary information and may ﬁx a
time-limit for the receipt thereof.
Article 14
Rule of speciality
1.
A person who has been extradited shall not be proceeded against, sentenced or
detained with a view to the carrying out of a sentence or detention order for any
oﬀence committed prior to his surrender other than that for which he was extra-
dited, nor shall he be for any other reason restricted in his personal freedom, except
in the following cases:
(a) when the Party which surrendered him consents. A request for consent shall
be submitted, accompanied by the documents mentioned in Article 12 and a
legal record of any statement made by the extradited person in respect of the
oﬀence concerned. Consent shall be given when the oﬀence for which it is
requested is itself subject to extradition in accordance with the provisions of
this Convention;
(b) when that person, having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the Party
to which he has been surrendered, has not done so within 45 days of his ﬁnal
discharge, or has returned to that territory after leaving it.
2.
The requesting Party may, however, take any measures necessary to remove the
person from its territory, or any measures necessary under its law, including
proceedings by default, to prevent any legal eﬀects of lapse of time.
3.
When the description of the oﬀence charged is altered in the course of proceedings,
the extradited person shall only be proceeded against or sentenced in so far as the
oﬀence under its new description is shown by its constituent elements to be an
oﬀence which would allow extradition.
Article 15
Re-extradition to a third state
Except as provided for in Article 14, paragraph 1(b), the requesting Party shall not,
without the consent of the requested Party, surrender to another Party or to a third
State a person surrendered to the requesting Party and sought by the said other
Party or third State in respect of oﬀences committed before his surrender. The
requested Party may request the production of the documents mentioned in Article 12,
paragraph 2.

the escape of the person sought.

Release shall not prejudice re-arrest and extradition if a request for extradition is
received subsequently.
Article 17
Conﬂicting requests

oﬀence or for diﬀerent oﬀences, the requested Party shall make its decision having
regard to all the circumstances and especially the relative seriousness and place of

person claimed and the possibility of subsequent extradition to another State.

treaty existing between Contracting States, it shall be deemed to be included as such

Article 5
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite

tion for an oﬀence mentioned in Article 1 or 2 has been made for the purpose of pro-
secuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political
opinion, or that that person’s position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.

motives.
2.
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to aﬀord
mutual assistance if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that
the request for mutual assistance in respect of an oﬀence mentioned in Article 1 or 2
has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of
his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or that that person’s position may
be prejudiced for any of these reasons.

inspired by political motives, provided that it undertakes to take into due consider-
ation, when evaluating the character of the oﬀence, any particularly serious aspects

(a) that it created a collective danger to the life, physical integrity or liberty of
persons; or

5. Second additional Protocol to the European Convention on
Extradition (17 March 1978)
The Member States of the Council of Europe, signatory to this Protocol,
Desirous of facilitating the application of the European Convention on Extradition
opened for signature in Paris on 13 December 1957 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the
Convention’) in the ﬁeld of ﬁscal oﬀences;
Considering it also desirable to supplement the Convention in certain other respects,
Have agreed as follows:
Chapter I
Article 1
Paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention shall be supplemented by the following
provision:
This right shall also apply to oﬀences which are subject only to pecuniary
sanctions.
Chapter II
Article 2
Article 5 of the Convention shall be replaced by the following provisions:
‘Fiscal oﬀences
1.
For oﬀences in connection with taxes, duties, customs and exchange extradition
shall take place between the Contracting Parties in accordance with the provisions
of the Convention if the oﬀence, under the law of the requested Party, corresponds
to an oﬀence of the same nature.
2.
Extradition may not be refused on the ground that the law of the requested Party
does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain a tax, duty,
custom or exchange regulation of the same kind as the law of the requesting
Party.’
Chapter III
Article 3
The Convention shall be supplemented by the following provisions:
‘Judgments in absentia

1.
When a Contracting Party requests from another Contracting Party the extradition
of a person for the purpose of carrying out a sentence or detention order imposed
by a decision rendered against him in absentia, the requested Party may refuse to
extradite for this purpose if, in its opinion, the proceedings leading to the judgment
did not satisfy the minimum rights of defence recognised as due to everyone
charged with criminal oﬀence. However, extradition shall be granted if the request-
ing Party gives an assurance considered suﬃcient to guarantee to the person
claimed the right to a retrial which safeguards the rights of defence. This decision
will authorise the requesting Party either to enforce the judgment in question if the
convicted person does not make an opposition or, if he does, to take proceedings
against the person extradited.
2.
When the requested Party informs the person whose extradition has been requested
of the judgment rendered against him in absentia, the requesting Party shall not
regard this communication as a formal notiﬁcation for the purposes of the criminal
procedure in that State.’
Chapter IV
Article 4
The Convention shall be supplemented by the following provisions:
‘Amnesty
Extradition shall not be granted for an oﬀence in respect of which an amnesty has
been declared in the requested State and which that State had competence to prosecute
under its own criminal law.’
Chapter V
Article 5
Paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the Convention shall be replaced by the following
provisions:
The request shall be in writing and shall be addressed by the Ministry of
Justice of the requesting Party to the Ministry of Justice of the requested
Party; however, use of the diplomatic channel is not excluded. Other means of
communication may be arranged by direct agreement between two or more
Parties.

This Protocol shall be open to signature by the member States of the Council
of Europe which have signed the Convention. It shall be subject to ratiﬁcation,
acceptance or approval. Instruments of ratiﬁcation, acceptance or approval shall

6. European Democracies facing up to Terrorism
Recommendation 1426 (1999) (23 September 1999)
1. In its Resolution 1132 (1997) the Assembly decided to invite parliamentarians and
experts to a conference aimed at strengthening democratic systems in Europe and
co-operation in the ﬁght against terrorism. In October 1997 this initiative received
the support of the 2nd Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Council
of Europe.
2. The parliamentary conference on European Democracies Facing Up to Terrorism,
which the Committee on Legal Aﬀairs and Human Rights was responsible for
organising, took place in Strasbourg from 14 to 16 October 1998.
3. Terrorism in Council of Europe member states assumes a variety of forms, but
its invariable aim is to undermine democracy, parliamentary institutions and
the territorial integrity of states. Terrorism represents a serious threat to demo-
cratic society, whose moral and social ﬁbre is aﬀected by it. It attacks the most
fundamental human right, the right to life, and for that reason must be totally
condemned.
4. The Assembly strongly and unequivocally condemns recent explosions of apart-
ment buildings in various cities of the Russian Federation and reiterates its position
that terrorist acts cannot have any justiﬁcation whatsoever. The Assembly expresses
sympathy to families of the victims of these barbaric acts and hopes that the
Russian Federation will be able to overcome the terrorist menace without deviation
from the democratic process and bring the criminals responsible for these attacks to
justice.
5. The Assembly considers an act of terrorism to be ‘any oﬀence committed by indi-
viduals or groups resorting to violence or threatening to use violence against a
country, its institutions, its population in general or speciﬁc individuals which,
being motivated by separatist aspirations, extremist ideological conceptions, fan-
aticism or irrational and subjective factors, is intended to create a climate of terror
among oﬃcial authorities, certain individuals or groups in society, or the general
public’.
6. The Council of Europe and its member states should take concrete steps to facili-
tate co-operation in combating terrorism. Anti-terrorist measures should include,
inter alia, exchanges of information, detention and extradition of persons accused
of terrorist crimes, and uncovering and cutting oﬀ the channels through which
terrorists are provided with weapons, explosives and ﬁnancial means.
7. To prevent the ethnic or religious tensions that are liable to give rise to terrorist
phenomena, democratic states should respect social and political pluralism by tak-
ing into account the legitimate aspirations of minorities and respecting cultural
characteristics.
8. However, the Assembly considers that no support, even of a moral kind, should be
given to any organisation advocating or encouraging violence as a method of
settling political, economic and social conﬂicts.
9. The prevention of terrorism also depends on education in democratic values and
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
592
 
www.ebook3000.com

tolerance, with the eradication of the teaching of negative or hateful attitudes
towards others and the development of a culture of peace in all individuals and
social groups.
10. The Assembly, recognising the vital importance of free media in a pluralistic
democracy, acknowledges that the media too have a responsible role to play by
reporting terrorist actions and by ﬁrmly refusing to allow themselves to be
exploited by terrorism.
11. The Assembly believes that the ﬁght against terrorism should be conducted on the
basis of respect for the rule of law and the fundamental rights and freedoms of
individuals, and it therefore regards recourse to special legislation as inadvisable.
12. Recognising the importance of respect for the rule of law, eﬀective judicial and
police co-operation on a continental scale is necessary to combat terrorism. The
Assembly therefore welcomes the creation of Europol, even though it is conﬁned to
the ﬁfteen member countries of the European Union. Furthermore, since terrorism
is not restricted to Europe, it is important to co-ordinate European initiatives with
other international initiatives.
13. The conventions of the Council of Europe, whether they be the 1977 European
Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism or the 1957 European Convention on
Extradition, should be reviewed in the light of experience to make them more
eﬀective in the ﬁght against terrorism.
14. The European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, by failing to cover all
criminal oﬀences capable of being considered terrorist actions or collaboration
with these actions, does not enable terrorism to be combated as eﬀectively as would
be desirable.
15. The European Convention on Extradition, by enabling extradition to be refused if
the oﬀence is a political one, should be modiﬁed to prevent abuses of the right to
asylum for terrorists.
16. The Assembly recommends that the Committee of Ministers:
(i)
revise the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, of
27 January 1977, by broadening the deﬁnition of criminal oﬀences of a ter-
rorist nature to include preparatory acts, the membership of associations and
the funding and setting up of logistics to perpetrate these kinds of oﬀences;
(ii)
consider as terrorist acts not only attacks against persons but also attacks
against property and material resources;
(iii)
delete Article 13 of the European Convention on the Suppression of
Terrorism;
(iv)
amend the European Convention on Extradition, of 13 December 1957,
by deﬁning the concept of a political oﬀence and proposing a simpliﬁed
extradition procedure, with measures to avoid abuse of the right of asylum;
(v)
consider the possibility of setting up a European criminal court to try
terrorist crimes in certain cases;
(vi)
consider the establishment of a procedure whereby, in certain cases, a person
accused of committing a terrorist oﬀence could be charged and tried for such
an oﬀence in a country other than the one in which the oﬀence was
committed;
(vii) initiate co-operation with the United Nations’ Special Committee on
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
593
 

Terrorism to consolidate the general legal framework of conventions on
international terrorism;
(viii) encourage member states to co-operate together more closely within Interpol,
and examine, in conjunction with the European Union, the possibility of
extending the Europol convention to all Council of Europe member states
and establishing a Europol judicial control system;
(ix)
envisage the preparation of a civic education textbook for all schools in
Europe so as to combat the spread of extremist ideas and advocate tolerance
and respect for others as an essential basis of community life;
(x)
consider the incorporation of the principle of fuller protection for victims of
terrorist acts at both national and international level;
(xi)
invite Council of Europe member states to incorporate the principle aut
dedere aut iudicare in their criminal legislation;
(xii) invite member states to strengthen bilateral co-operation in respect of their
judicial authorities, police forces and intelligence services.
7. Parliamentary Democracies facing Terrorism Recommendation
1534 (2001) (26 September 2001)
1.
The Parliamentary Assembly refers to its Resolution 1258 (2001) on democracies
facing terrorism.
2.
It strongly condemns all forms of terrorism as a violation of the most fundamental
human right: the right to life.
3.
It takes note of the declaration by the Committee of Ministers of 12 September
2001 and welcomes its decision of 21 September 2001 to include the ﬁght against
terrorism in the agenda for the 109th Session of the Committee of Ministers (7 and
8 November 2001).
4.
The Assembly regards the new International Criminal Court as the appropriate
institution to consider international acts of terrorism.
5.
The Assembly urges the Committee of Ministers to:
(i)
ask those member states who have not yet done so to sign and ratify
the existing relevant anti-terrorist conventions, especially the International
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism;
(ii)
invite member states to lift their reservations to anti-terrorist conventions,
which hinder international co-operation;
(iii)
ensure the full implementation of all existing Council of Europe conventions
in the penal ﬁeld;
(iv)
request those member and Observer states that have not done so to sign and
ratify, as rapidly as possible, the Treaty of Rome, which provides for the
establishment of the International Criminal Court;
(v)
make it possible for Observer and non-member states to accede to the
European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism at its 109th Minis-
terial Session, and invite them, as well as those member states who have not
yet signed and/or ratiﬁed this convention, to do so at this session;
(vi)
establish immediate, concrete and formal co-operation with the European
Union, the OSCE and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
594
 
www.ebook3000.com

the basis of the Council of Europe’s values and legal instruments, in order to
guarantee coherence and eﬃciency in Europe’s action against terrorism;
(vii) ask member states to review their education programmes in order to enhance
the role of democratic values, as children and the younger generation are
often used by the terrorists to achieve their aims;
(viii) reconsider the basis of international co-operation in criminal matters in
Europe, in order to ﬁnd new and more eﬀective means of co-operation which
take account of present-day realities and needs;
(ix)
extend the terms of reference of the Committee of Experts on the Criminali-
sation of Acts of a Racist or Xenophobic Nature Committed Through
Computer Networks (PC-RX) to terrorist messages and the decoding thereof;
(x)
as regards the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism,
remove as a matter of urgency Article 13, which grants contracting states
the right to make reservations which can defeat the purpose of the conven-
tion by enabling the states to refuse extradition for oﬀences otherwise
extraditable;
(xi)
give urgent consideration to amending and widening the Rome Statute to
allow the remit of the International Criminal Court to include acts of inter-
national terrorism;
(xii) review the relevant existing conventions in the light of the recent events
and declare terrorism and all forms of support for it to be crimes against
humanity.
6.
The Assembly recommends that the Committee of Ministers examine, in
co-operation with the European Union bodies, the modalities for extending the
European Union arrest warrant to all Council of Europe member states in the ﬁeld
of the ﬁght against terrorism.
7.
It reiterates its Recommendation 1426 (1999) on European democracies facing up
to terrorism and calls on the Committee of Ministers to provide a more substantial
reply to it as a matter of urgency.
8. Parliamentary Assembly democracies facing Terrorism
Resolution 1258 (2001) (26 September 2001)
1.
The members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the
800 million Europeans whom it represents were horriﬁed by the recent terrorist
attacks against the United States of America.
2.
The Assembly conveys its deepest sympathies to the people of the United States
and to the families of the victims, including citizens of other countries.
3.
The Assembly condemns in the strongest possible terms these barbaric terrorist
acts. It considers these attacks as a crime that violates the most fundamental
human right: the right to life.
4.
The Assembly calls on the international community to give all necessary support
to the Government of the United States of America in dealing with the con-
sequences of these attacks and in bringing the perpetrators to justice, in line with
existing international anti-terrorist conventions and United Nations Security
Council resolutions.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
595
 

5. The Assembly regards the new International Criminal Court as the appropriate
institution to consider terrorist acts.
6. The Assembly welcomes, supports and sharesthe solidarity shown by members of
the international community, which has not only condemned these attacks, but also
oﬀered to co-operate in an appropriate response.
7. These attacks have shown clearly the real face of terrorism and the need for a new
kind of response. This terrorism does not recognise borders. It is an international
problem to which international solutions must be found based on a global political
approach. The world community must show that it will not capitulate to terrorism,
but that it will stand more strongly than before for democratic values, the rule of
law and the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
8. There can be no justiﬁcation for terrorism. The Assembly considers these terrorist
actions to be crimes rather than acts of war. Any actions, either by the United
States acting alone or as a part of a broader international coalition, must be in line
with existing United Nations anti-terrorist conventions and Security Council reso-
lutions and must focus on bringing the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of
these crimes to justice, instead of inﬂicting a hasty revenge.
9. At the same time, the Assembly believes that long-term prevention of terrorism
must include a proper understanding of its social, economic, political and religious
roots and of the individual’s capacity for hatred. If these issues are properly
addressed, it will be possible to seriously undermine the grass roots support for
terrorists and their recruitment networks.
10. The Assembly supports the idea of elaborating and signing at the highest level an
international convention on combating terrorism, which should contain a com-
prehensive deﬁnition of international terrorism as well as speciﬁc obligations for
participating states to prevent acts of terrorism on a national and global scale and
to punish their organisers and executors.
11. The recent terrorist acts appear to have been undertaken by extremists who have
used violence with a view to provoking a serious clash between the West and the
Islamic world. Therefore, the Assembly emphasises that any action to prevent or
punish terrorist acts must not discriminate on ethnic or religious grounds and must
not be directed against any religious or ethnic community.
12. If military action is part of a response to terrorism, the international community
must clearly deﬁne its objectives and should avoid targeting civilians. Any action
should be taken in conformity with international law and with the agreement of the
United Nations Security Council. The Assembly therefore welcomes Security
Council Resolution 1368 (2001), which expresses the Council’s readiness to take all
necessary steps to respond to the attacks of 11 September 2001 and to combat all
forms of terrorism in accordance with its responsibilities under the United Nations
Charter.
13. The Assembly expresses its conviction that introducing additional restrictions on
freedom of movement, including more hurdles for migration and for access to
asylum, would be an absolutely inappropriate response to the rise of terrorism, and
calls upon all member states to refrain from introducing such restrictive measures.
14. The Assembly believes that international action against terrorism can only be
eﬀective if it is carried out with the broadest possible support. It calls for close co-
operation at a pan-European level, especially with the European Parliament, as
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
596
 
www.ebook3000.com

part of a global eﬀort and calls on the European Union, the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) and the OSCE to co-operate closely with the Council of
Europe in this regard.
15. The Assembly expresses support for the proposal to establish an international
anti-terrorist mechanism within the United Nations to co-ordinate and promote
co-operation between states in dealing with terrorism.
16. The Assembly recalls its report on terrorism of 1984, as well as Recommendation
1426 (1999) on European democracies facing up to terrorism. It reiterates the
proposals made in this recommendation, including the principle of aut dedere aut
judicare (either extradite or try), and instructs its relevant committees to update
them if necessary.
17. The Assembly calls on the Council of Europe member states to:
(i)
stand ﬁrmly united against all acts of terrorism, whether they are state spon-
sored or perpetrated by isolated groups or organisations, and show a clear
will and readiness to ﬁght against them;
(ii)
introduce economic and other appropriate measures against countries oﬀer-
ing safe havens to terrorists or providing ﬁnancial and moral support to
them;
(iii)
concentrate their eﬀorts on improving judicial co-operation and police co-
operation and on the identifying and seizing of funds used for terrorist pur-
poses in the spirit of the International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism;
(iv)
review the scope of the existing national legal provisions on the prevention
and suppression of terrorism;
(v)
take the necessary steps to ensure that appropriate domestic measures exist to
prevent and counteract the ﬁnancing of terrorists and terrorist organisations;
(vi)
lift their reservations to all existing conventions dealing with terrorism;
(vii) provide access to bank accounts for the authorities responsible for investigat-
ing international crime and terrorist networks in particular;

COUNCIL OF EUROPE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS
9. Declaration of the Committee of Ministers on the ﬁght against
international terrorism (12 September 2001)
1.
The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe condemns with the utmost
force the terrorist attacks of unprecedented violence committed against the
American people, to whom it expresses sympathy and solidarity.
These crimes do not strike only the United States but aﬀect us all. These barbaric
acts violate human rights, in particular the right to life, democracy and the search
for peace.
Such monstrous acts demand resolute reaction from all states committed to
uphold civilised values.
The Council of Europe, which unites the continent around these values, has a
particular interest and responsibility to contribute to such a reaction.
2.
The Committee of Ministers decides to hold a special meeting on 21 September
with the following agenda:
(i)
strengthening of the ﬁght against terrorism, using the speciﬁc expertise and
instruments of the Council of Europe, and improving the mechanisms and
means for co-operation with other international organisations and the
Observer states;
(ii)
inviting the member states to give increased eﬀectiveness to the existing pan-
European co-operation, for example, to accede, where they have not done so,
to conventions on mutual assistance in criminal matters;
(iii)
examining the scope for updating the European Convention on the Suppres-
sion of Terrorism;
(iv)
the inclusion of the ﬁght against terrorism in the Council of Europe’s inte-
grated project on the struggle against violence in everyday life in a democratic
society.
10. Council of Europe/European Union: Joint Action against
Terrorism agreed at Quadripartite meeting (20 November 2001)
Brussels, 20.11.2001—The united European contribution to international action
against terrorism came ﬁrst on the agenda of the 17th Quadripartite meeting between
the two Organisations today in Brussels. The European enlargement process with
regard to both the European Union and the Council of Europe was examined.
Emphasis was laid on the Copenhagen compliance criteria concerning candidates
for EU membership and on the pending applications for membership of the Council
of Europe (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). Finally, an
exchange of views was held on joint activities—namely, in the Russian Federation,
Ukraine, South Caucasus and Turkey.
Antanas Valionis, Lithuanian Minister for Foreign Aﬀairs and Chairman of the
Council’s Committee of Ministers, and Secretary General Walter Schwimmer, on
behalf of the Council of Europe itself, referred to the anti-terrorism package of the
Strasbourg-based Organisation which contains measures for intensifying legal co-
operation, for the safeguarding of fundamental values, including monitoring with
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

regard to the eﬀective implementation of existing Council of Europe Conventions.
Mr Schwimmer recalled the necessity to ‘uphold respect for human rights and the
rule of law’. ‘The anti-terrorism ﬁght is aimed to protect basic human rights and
democracy, not to undermine them’, he said.
Mr Chris Patten for the European Commission and the Belgian Minister of State for
Foreign Aﬀairs, Mrs Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, on behalf of the Union, underlined
that the EU would participate in the work of the Council of Europe Multidisciplinary
Group on International Action against Terrorism.
Both parties emphasised the need for increased multi-cultural dialogue within a pub-
lic awareness-raising process with other potential partners such as the United Nations,
the OSCE and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. It was agreed to set up a
common agenda for this purpose.
11. Parliamentary Assembly Combating Terrorism and Respect
for Human Rights Resolution 1271 (2002)
1.
Recalling its Recommendation 1426 (1999), its Resolution 1258 (2001) and its
Recommendation 1534 (2001) on democracies facing terrorism, the Parliamentary
Assembly considers it necessary to take stock of the means used to combat
terrorism.
2.
First of all, the Assembly would like to draw attention to the new nature of the
conﬂict that arose as a result of the terrorist acts of 11 September, which cannot be
classed as a ‘ “war” ’ in the traditional sense according to international law in so far
as there was no declaration of war, nor has it been proved that the terrorist acts
were carried out on the orders of a particular country. The military intervention
carried out in Afghanistan as a result of the attacks was directed not against a
country but against a terrorist organisation and against the former regime in
Afghanistan, suspected of supporting such organisations.
3.
The Assembly considers there is a need to study the causes of terrorism in order to
ﬁnd better ways of combating and, above all, of preventing them. It reiterates,
however, that there can never be any justiﬁcation for resorting to terrorism.
4.
Eliminating support for terrorism and depriving it of all sources of funding are
essential ways of preventing this form of crime.
5.
The combat against terrorism must be carried out in compliance with national and
international law and respecting human rights.
6.
The Assembly considers that higher levels of education, access to decent living
conditions and respect for human dignity are the best instruments for reducing
the support currently given to terrorism in certain countries.
7.
The Assembly, which has declared itself to be strongly opposed to capital punish-
ment and which has succeeded in ridding Europe of the death penalty, tolerates no
exceptions to this principle. Therefore, prior to the extradition of suspected terror-
ists to countries that still apply the death penalty, assurances must be obtained that
this penalty will not be sought.
8.
The Assembly also insists on the fact that member states should under no circum-
stances extradite persons who risk being subjected to ill-treatment in violation
of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights or being subjected to
a trial which does not respect the fundamental principles of a fair trial, or, in a
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
599
 

period of conﬂict, to standards which fall below those enshrined in the Geneva
Convention.
9. In their ﬁght against terrorism, Council of Europe member states should not
provide for any derogations to the European Convention on Human Rights.
10. The Assembly hopes that the statute of the International Criminal Court will be
rapidly ratiﬁed and its remit extended to acts of terrorism.
11. Concerning judicial co-operation, the Assembly considers that the European arrest
warrant to be introduced by the European Union, in so far as it applies to crimes
related to terrorism, should be extended to include all member states of the Council
of Europe, in full respect of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European
Convention on Human Rights.
12. The Assembly therefore calls upon all Council of Europe member states to:
(i)
ratify without delay, if they have not already done so:
— the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism;
— the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism;
— the European Convention on Extradition and its two additional protocols;
— the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and
its two additional protocols;
— the European Convention on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal
Matters;
— the Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure, and Conﬁscation of the
Proceeds from Crime;
— the Convention on Cybercrime;
(ii) ratify as soon as possible, if they have not already done so, the statute of the
International Criminal Court;
(iii) set up networks for co-operation between Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs)
and ensure the necessary means of co-operation are put in place;
(iv) refuse to extradite suspected terrorists to countries that continue to apply the
death sentence, in accordance with the decision of the European Court of
Human Rights in the Soering case and with Article 11 of the European Con-
vention on Extradition, unless assurances are given that the death penalty will
not be sought;
(v)
refrain from using Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights
(derogation in time of emergency) to limit the rights and liberties guaranteed
under its Article 5 (right to liberty and security).
13. The Assembly supports the proposal to convene an international conference on
the combating of terrorism in St Petersburg, to be held in co-operation with the
Interparliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth of Independent States as
well as other international parliamentary organisations, and believes that this con-
ference should pay special attention to legal issues related to the suppression of
terrorism.

12 Fight against Terrorism: No Extraditions if the Death Penalty
is Sought (24 January 2002)
In today’s debate on the report presented by Mr Michel Hunault (France, EDG) on
behalf of the Committee on Legal Aﬀairs and Human Rights, the Assembly expressed
its concerns about the threats to human rights resulting from some measures taken to
ﬁght terrorism since 11 September 2001.
The adopted resolution calls for all eﬀorts to combat terrorism to comply fully with
national and international law and to respect human rights.
Moreover, the Assembly calls upon Council of Europe member states to refuse
the extradition of suspected terrorists if the death penalty is sought and to amend the
European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism accordingly. The same principle
should apply if there is a risk of ill treatment or trials which disregard the fundamental
principles of fairness.
In their ﬁght against terrorism, Council of Europe member states should make no
derogations from the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Assembly also expressed its wish to see the Statute of the International Criminal
Court rapidly ratiﬁed and its competence extended to acts of terrorism.
Finally, the Assembly called upon Council of Europe governments to step up their
legal co-operation in the ﬁght against terrorism and adopted a series of concrete
recommendations in this respect.
In the course of the debate the Secretary General of the Council of Europe Walter
Schwimmer reported on the Organisation’s contribution to the international eﬀorts to
defeat terrorism, while preserving human rights and fundamental freedoms.

13. St Petersburg Final Declaration on Combating Terrorism
(28 March 2002)
International conference in St Petersburg on combating terrorism
Final declaration
The Saint Petersburg Interparliamentary Forum on Combating Terrorism
St Petersburg on 27 and 28 March 2002
Held at the joint initiative of the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations
of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe, in co-operation with the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE
and the European Parliament;
Supported by the Nordic Council, the Assembly of the Western European Union, the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation, the Interparlia-
mentary Assembly of the Eurasian Economic Co-operation and with the collaboration
of intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations;
FINAL DECLARATION
The participants:
Condemn strongly and without reservation terrorism in all its forms and state their
ﬁrm belief that acts of terrorism must be considered as crimes;
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
601
 

Consider that any terrorist act violates democratic values, the rule of law, human
rights and fundamental freedoms and that it cannot be justiﬁed on any political,
religious, economic or social grounds;
Express their conviction that the combat against international terrorism forms a
crucial part in defending international peace and security;
Underline that international action against terrorism can only be eﬃcient if it enjoys
the broadest possible support based on close co-operation at global, regional and
bilateral level;
Stress that measures to combat terrorism must be consistent with the requirements
of democracy, the rule of law and the respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms. They must be directed exclusively at the perpetrators of terrorist acts and
their accomplices and not against any national, ethnic or religious community as such;
Stress the inadmissibility of any double standards, stereotypes or selectivity on polit-
ical grounds in interpreting acts and manifestations of terrorism in various regions of
the world;
Express deep concern over a new dimension of terrorism that is increasingly trans-
national, and recognise that no country is sheltered from it;
Note with deep concern that terrorist networks appear to enjoy large funding,
mainly from extremist circles across the world as well as, increasingly, from organised
crime, and even, in some cases, direct or indirect support from States;
Underline the serious threat to international security posed by the close links
between, on the one hand, international terrorism and, on the other, trans-national
organised crime, in particular the illegal traﬃc of drugs and weapons, the traﬃc of human
beings, money-laundering and attempts to obtain weapons destined for mass destruc-
tion; and note with concern that, notwithstanding the diﬀering means and objectives
of criminal and terrorist organisations, they tend to forge alliances and, especially in
the case of trans-national criminal organisations, employ terrorist methods;
Stress the growing danger presented by technological terrorism aimed at enterprises
and industrial facilities that stock considerable amounts of energy supplies and explo-
sives, as well as radioactive, biological and chemical materials, some of which are toxic;
and underline the need to develop and fully implement active and passive protection
systems for such facilities at risk;
Re-aﬃrm the inherent right of each country to defend itself as recognised by
Article 51, Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations;
Underline that the most eﬀective way to combat international terrorism is through
the use of international and national legal instruments established to prevent terrorist
acts, to deprive terrorist networks of their sources of ﬁnance and to bring those
involved in terrorist acts to justice;
Underline that, should military action form part of any response to terrorism, it
must be taken in conformity with international law and with the agreement of the
United Nations Security Council; and stress in this connection that States must not
resort to any unilateral use of force that is inconsistent with international law;
Stress that no country must oﬀer safe haven, or ﬁnancial or moral support, to terror-
ists and call for international sanctions to be taken on the basis of a United Nations
Security Council resolution against countries which so proceed;
Recognise the leading role of the United Nations in combating terrorism, and in this
context support operative international treaties dealing with various aspects of inter-
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

national terrorism, including UN Security Council Resolutions Nos. 1377 (2001), 1373
(2001), 1368 (2001) and 1269 (1999), as well as Resolution 56/1 of the UN General
Assembly; and consider that these must form the basis for international co-operation
in the combat against international terrorism;
Consider it essential to undertake all possible eﬀorts to ﬁnalise and ensure the
approval by the United Nations of a Global Convention on Combating Terrorism, on
the understanding that this Convention should contain a universal deﬁnition of inter-
national terrorism, set out the obligations of member States as regards the prevention
of terrorist acts at national and global level, deﬁne the sanctions against their organ-
isers and perpetrators; and believe that similar eﬀorts should be deployed as regards
the International Convention on Combating Acts of Nuclear Terrorism;
Call on countries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the United Nations
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and to
halt any ﬁnancing of terrorists and terrorist organisations, whether direct or indirect,
through appropriate domestic measures;
Call on countries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Statute of the
International Criminal Court and give support to widening it to allow the remit of the
Court to include acts of international terrorism;
Recognise the valuable contribution that international regional organisations such
as the Council of Europe, the CIS and the OSCE can make to global eﬀorts in the ﬁght
against terrorism as stressed in Resolution 56/88 of the United Nations General
Assembly of 23 January 2002 on Measures to eliminate international terrorism;
Welcome in this connection the work of the Council of Europe Multidisciplinary
Group on International Action against Terrorism responsible for ensuring a coherent
and co-ordinated legal approach on combating terrorism and, in particular, support its
activities aimed at a speciﬁc follow-up to the implementation of anti-terrorist legal
instruments;
Recognise the contribution of the Council of Europe and the European Union to
international action against terrorism at the European level, in particular in the areas
of intensifying legal co-operation to combat terrorism, safeguarding human rights,
reinforcing democracy, fostering greater social justice and promoting intercultural and
inter-religious dialogue;
Underline in this respect the importance of Council of Europe Conventions in
this ﬁeld, especially the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, the
European Convention on Extradition and its Protocols, the European Convention
on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and its Protocols, the European Convention
on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters, the European Convention on
the Laundering, Search, Seizure and Conﬁscation of the Proceeds from Crime and the
Convention on Cyber Crime;
Call upon states that have not yet done so to become parties to these conventions as
soon as possible and support the opening for signature and ratiﬁcation of these Con-
ventions by all OSCE and CIS member States;
Welcome the readiness of the Council of Europe to provide expertise at short
notice to its member States as well as to OSCE and CIS member States regarding
the drafting of anti-terrorist legislation as well as with regard to the conformity of
their anti-terrorist instruments with the European Convention on Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms;
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
603
 

Welcome the framework decision recently taken by the European Union, with a
genuine contribution of the European Parliament, to introduce a European arrest war-
rant which permits direct and eﬃcient co-operation between the judicial and police
authorities of the EU member States with regard to extradition procedures.
Welcome the decision of the Standing Committee of the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly to devote its 2002 Annual Session in Berlin to the subject of ‘Confronting
Terrorism—A Global Challenge in the 21st Century’;
Note the important work of the CIS member States with a view to putting in place
agreed cooperation in the ﬁght against terrorism on the basis of the Treaty on cooper-
ation of CIS member States in combating international terrorism signed on 4 June
1999, the importance of the adoption, on 21 June 2000, of the Programme of CIS
member states to ﬁght international terrorism and other manifestations of extremism
for the period through the year 2003, as well as of the launching of the Anti-Terrorist
Centre of CIS member States;
Recognise the validity of repeated and persistent appeals by the Interparliamentary
Assembly of Member Nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States for
leading international organisations to consolidate eﬀorts in combating terrorism;
Call on States to step up international co-operation in combating the laundering of
the proceeds from crime, in particular with respect to ﬁnancial investigations, as well as
eﬀorts to combat the ﬁnancing of terrorism;
Stress the need for full co-operation between countries in providing judicial assist-
ance to each other and in ensuring extradition of terrorists, so that criminals cannot
escape responsibility for their acts;
Share the concern expressed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe and by the European Parliament that respect for human rights should not be
infringed when combating terrorism and, in particular, that suspected terrorists are not
extradited to countries that continue to apply the death penalty;
Stress that success in combating international terrorism will depend critically on the
degree of support that anti-terrorist actions enjoy in society at large, and on the shap-
ing of a public consensus uniting various political and religious views as well as civil
society, including non-governmental organisations;
Support in this respect the initiative launched by the Russian Federation at the 56th
session of the United Nations General Assembly, for the convening of a World Forum
under the aegis of the United Nations, to discuss the contribution of civil society and,
in particular, mass media to combating terrorism;
Stress that, in order to combat terrorism successfully over the longer term and
thereby be able to undermine support for it, there must be a proper understanding of
the social, economic, political and religious causes that may underlie it;
Call for a strengthening of the dialogue between diﬀerent civilisations and religions
and underline the role of the Council of Europe North-South Centre for Global
Interdependence and Solidarity in this regard;
Emphasise the role of parliamentarians in shaping legislative barriers against all forms
of terrorism and call on parliaments of all countries to ratify and implement all
appropriate international conventions and protocols concerning terrorism, to lift any
reservations against them still in force and to adapt their national legislation accordingly;
Resolve to continue jointly their eﬀorts to combat criminal and terrorist activities
and to ensure full respect for human rights and for cultural and religious diversity.

strengthening mutual understanding, and consider it advisable to have regular inter-
parliamentary dialogue on countering terrorism.
14. Communiqué of the 110th Session of the Committee of
Ministers (3 May 2002)
The Council of Europe conﬁrms its commitment to international action against terrorism
and stresses the importance of regional cooperation in consolidating democratic stability
in Greater Europe.
At their 110th Session (Vilnius, 3 May 2002), under the chairmanship of Antanas
Valionis, Minister for Foreign Aﬀairs of Lithuania, the Ministers concentrated their
discussion on the following subjects:
I. International action against terrorism—the contribution of the
Council of Europe
The Ministers assessed progress in the work carried out with regard to the three cor-
nerstones which they had deﬁned for the Council of Europe contribution to inter-
national action against terrorism: intensifying legal cooperation to combat terrorism,
safeguarding fundamental values and investing in democracy. On this basis, they
agreed on a number of guidelines for future action.
From the outset, the Ministers reiterated that States had an obligation to protect
their populations against all forms of terrorism. The main contribution of the Organ-
isation is to strengthen the legal basis of counter-terrorist measures, while fully respect-
ing human rights and complying with the demands of democracy and the rule of
law, as well as to help eradicate the roots of terrorism by ﬁghting discrimination,
intolerance and extremism and promoting multicultural and inter-religious dialogue.
The Ministers took note with satisfaction of the ﬁrst report of the Multidisciplinary
Group on international action against Terrorism (GMT) set up last November. They
expressed their political will that eﬀorts be sustained in the areas identiﬁed by the
GMT, including the strengthening of international cooperation, through the updating
of the 1977 European Convention on the suppression of terrorism.
The Ministers reaﬃrmed their support for the Organisation’s eﬀorts to combat
terrorism, in particular through examining the possibility of setting up a speciﬁc
follow-up mechanism to the Council of Europe’s action in this ﬁeld.
Accordingly, they instructed the GMT to prepare a draft protocol to the European
Convention on the suppression of terrorism, and noted that a new report will be
submitted to them for their next session.
The Ministers welcomed the work on draft guidelines on human rights and the ﬁght
against terrorism, which is being carried out by the Steering Committee on Human
Rights (CDDH). These are to be ﬁnalised by the latter in June 2002 and will lay down
the principles to be observed by the member States and all States intending to respect
human rights and the rule of law in the struggle against terrorism.
The Ministers recalled that the general principle that underlies these guidelines is
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
605
 

that respect for human rights is not an obstacle to the ﬁght against terrorism. The
obligation for States to protect the fundamental rights of everyone within their juris-
diction against terrorist acts, in particular the right to life, requires them to take eﬃ-
cient measures to ﬁght against terrorism. These measures must however be reasonable
and proportionate, and require striking a balance between the obligation to take pro-
tective measures against terrorism and the obligation to protect and defend human
rights and fundamental freedoms.
The Ministers noted the additional contribution made in the ﬁeld of prevention and
eliminating the causes of terrorism. This included the Council of Europe’s work to
foster greater social cohesion and pay more attention to cultural and religious diversity,
with full respect on all sides for the fundamental values of democracies. The Ministers
called for eﬀorts to develop pilot schemes aimed at multicultural and inter-religious
dialogue at diﬀerent levels (north-south, transfrontier, regional and local). They con-
ﬁrmed their interest in programmes geared to better control of migratory ﬂows and
integration of migrants, whose fundamental rights must be safeguarded.
The Ministers also welcomed the concerted action carried out—parallel to inter-
governmental work—in the ﬁeld of interparliamentary cooperation. In this respect,
particular reference was made to the recent Interparliamentary Forum in St Petersburg,
organised on the joint initiative of the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member
Nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Parliamentary Assembly
of the Council of Europe, in cooperation with the Parliamentary Assembly of the
OSCE and the European Parliament. The Ministers stressed that the support of
populations, through their elected representatives, is indispensable.
Lastly, the Ministers expressed their ﬁrm belief that the ﬁght against terrorism can
be well served by strengthening regional cooperation in this respect.
II. Regional co-operation: its impact on stability and democratic reforms
in Europe
The Ministers examined ways and means of strengthening cooperation between the
Council of Europe and regional mechanisms with a view to taking greater advantage
of their capabilities in enhancing the ideals and standards of the Council of Europe
through cooperation within their own structures.
At the close of the discussion, the Ministers adopted the Vilnius Declaration on
‘Regional Co-operation and the Consolidation of Democratic Stability in the Greater
Europe’. The Declaration emphasises the role regional co-operation can play in the
building of a Greater Europe without dividing lines.
The Ministers also agreed on a number of areas in which closer cooperation and
synergy between the Council of Europe and regional mechanisms could be particularly
fruitful. They invited the Secretary General to convene a working meeting of these
bodies in Strasbourg, as a follow-up to the Session.
They encouraged initiatives aiming at developing regional cooperation in those parts
of Europe where such co-operation does not yet exist and could be particularly useful
in providing for constructive approaches among the countries concerned. In this context,
they called on for the removal of existing obstacles to such cooperation.
The Ministers decided to transmit this Communiqué and the Vilnius Declaration to
the United Nations and the OSCE.

16. Parliamentary Assembly Need for Intensiﬁed International
Co-operation to Neutralise Funds for Terrorist Purposes.
Recommendation 1584 (18 November 2002)
1.
The terrorist attacks against the United States of America on 11 September 2001
demonstrated in the most dramatic and tragic fashion the vulnerability of civilisa-
tion vis-à-vis those seeking to destroy it, and the resulting need to take every
measure to prevent terrorist acts and apprehend the perpetrators, organisers and
sponsors, along the principles set out in Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation
1534 (2001) on democracies facing terrorism.
2.
The Assembly, referring in particular to its Recommendation 1550 (2002) on com-
bating terrorism and respect for human rights, underlines the importance in this
struggle of identifying and neutralising funds destined for terrorist purposes—an
undertaking which is possible only if the world community, and notably Europe,
reach a new degree of co-operation at the normative, operative and implementation
levels. While such an eﬀort may not ensure the prevention of all terrorist acts, it can
contribute signiﬁcantly to weakening terrorist infrastructure. This is so especially if
measures can neutralise terrorism’s legal sources of ﬁnancing, which in certain
cases operate under the cover of humanitarian, non-proﬁt or even charitable organ-
isations. It is also necessary to prevent general criminal activities that often serve to
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
610
 
www.ebook3000.com

ﬁnance terrorism, such as traﬃcking in human beings, drugs and weapons. The
systems and measures developed over the last few years to prevent the laundering
of proceeds from crime can, if conscientiously applied, play a signiﬁcant role in the
detection, freezing and conﬁscation of terrorist funds.
3.
The Assembly, with the above in mind, recommends strongly that the Committee
of Ministers of the Council of Europe undertake the following measures:
At the normative level
(i)
to work in favour of the ratiﬁcation, by all Council of Europe member states
and others, of the totality of international legal instruments concerned
with the ﬁght against terrorism and its ﬁnancing, and in particular the
1999 United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the
Financing of Terrorism;
(ii)
to reach immediately an agreement on a deﬁnition of terrorism, preferably
based on that adopted in December 2001 by the European Council of the
European Union in a common position;
(iii)
to render any ﬁnancial activity in support of terrorism thus deﬁned a
criminal oﬀence;
(iv)
further to strengthen domestic legislation and any international convention
in need thereof, by adapting them to new technological and other develop-
ments as well as to the growing sophistication of terrorists, for the purpose
of successfully tracing the origin—whether legal or illegal—as well as the
routing of funds intended for terrorist ends, with a view to their seizure or
conﬁscation. The Assembly in this connection welcomes the Committee of
Ministers’ decision taken in May 2002 that an additional protocol should be
drawn up to the 1997 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism
(ETS No. 90), and asks the Committee of Ministers also to envisage the
possibility of adapting the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering,
Search, Seizure and Conﬁscation of the Proceeds from Crime (ETS No. 141),
for instance through an additional protocol;
At the operative level
(v)
to intensify co-operation between national administration, police forces,
courts, ﬁnancial institutions, regulatory and other authorities in order to
uncover suspicious international transactions and thereby reach the organ-
isations and individuals behind them. The Assembly in this context wel-
comes the creation in 2001 of Euro Just and supports decisions taken to
widen the mandates of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the
Council of Europe’s Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-
Money Laundering Measures (PC-R-EV), to include also the detection of
terrorism ﬁnancing and welcomes in addition the establishment within
Europol of an international terrorism task force dealing also with its ﬁnancial
aspects;
At the level of monitoring implementation
(vi)
to ensure that international conventions and other agreements against terror-
ism ﬁnancing are eﬀectively implemented in Council of Europe member
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
611
 

states and other participating states—notably by strengthening the mandates
and increasing the resources of the FATF and other competent bodies such
as the PC-R-EV, and by rendering public any national shortcoming so as to
increase pressure for remedial action;
(vii) ﬁnally, the Assembly reiterates its belief, as expressed notably in its Reso-
lution 1271 (2002) on combating terrorism and respect for human rights, that
the ﬁght against terrorism must never be allowed to harm the Council of
Europe’s fundamental values of democracy, the rule of law and human
rights—including the provisions of the European Convention on Human
Rights and the prohibition of the death penalty it upholds.
17. Protocol amending the European Convention on the
Suppression of Terrorism (15 May 2003)
The Member States of the Council of Europe, signatory to this Protocol,
Bearing in mind the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe’s Declaration
of 12 September 2001 and its Decision of 21 September 2001 on the Fight against
International Terrorism, and the Vilnius Declaration on Regional Co-operation and the
Consolidation of Democratic Stability in Greater Europe adopted by the Committee
of Ministers at its 110th Session in Vilnius on 3 May 2002;
Bearing in mind the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe’s Recom-
mendation 1550 (2002) on Combating terrorism and respect for human rights;
Bearing in mind the General Assembly of the United Nations Resolution A/RES/51/
210 on measures to eliminate international terrorism and the annexed Declaration to
Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism,
and its Resolution A/RES/49/60 on measures to eliminate international terrorism and
the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annexed thereto;
Wishing to strengthen the ﬁght against terrorism while respecting human rights, and
mindful of the Guidelines on human rights and the ﬁght against terrorism adopted by
the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 11 July 2002;
Considering for that purpose that it would be appropriate to amend the European
Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism (ETS No. 90) opened for signature in
Strasbourg on 27 January 1977, hereinafter referred to as ‘the Convention’;
Considering that it would be appropriate to update the list of international conven-
tions in Article 1 of the Convention and to provide for a simpliﬁed procedure to
subsequently update it as required;
Considering that it would be appropriate to strengthen the follow-up of the imple-
mentation of the Convention;

18. Parliamentary Assembly Terrorism: A Threat to Democracies
Recommendation (29 January 2004)
1.
The Parliamentary Assembly refers to its previous texts, in particular Recom-
mendations 1534 (2001) on democracies facing terrorism and 1550 (2002) on
combating terrorism and respect for human rights, and replies of the Committee
of Ministers thereon, which were on the whole positive. The Assembly welcomes
the Guidelines on Human Rights and the Fight against Terrorism, adopted by the
Committee of Ministers on 11 July 2002, which formulate criteria for safeguarding
human rights in the ﬁght against terrorism.
2.
It observes that terrorist attacks of particular ferocity have been carried out
in diﬀerent parts of the world since the attacks of 11 September 2001, and the
existence of a global terrorist threat is now a well established fact.
3.
The Assembly conveys its deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and
to all those aﬀected or injured by the recent terrorist bombings in the Russian
Federation and in Turkey and, in general, by any terrorist attack.
4.
Whereas the improvement of international co-operation, the stepping up of
national security measures and the increase in the number of ratiﬁcations of various
international legal instruments are positive signs in the ﬁght against terrorism,
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
621
 

loopholes still exist in legislation, cross-border controls, prosecution and extradition
arrangements, and these are exploited by terrorists.
5. In this connection, the Assembly welcomes the setting up of the Counter-Terrorism
Committee in the United Nations, established pursuant to Security Council Reso-
lution 1373 (2001), the adoption of the Common Position and the Framework
Decisions by the Council of the European Union, which is a rather signiﬁcant
attempt to a structured approach in the ﬁght against terrorism, and the setting up
of the Committee of Experts on Terrorism (Codexter) in the Council of Europe,
with the aim of reinforcing and co-ordinating the Organisation’s action in this
ﬁeld.
6. The Assembly is convinced, however, that a new impetus is necessary in order to
give a clear signal to the public about the importance of multilateral eﬀorts. The
incorporation, therefore, of fragmented legal texts together with the necessary add-
itions in one comprehensive convention would present considerable added value to
the ﬁght against terrorism, as ﬁrst expressed in its Opinion No. 242 (2003) on
the draft protocol amending the European Convention on the Suppression of
Terrorism.
7. Despite the progress so far reached in this regard, the possibility of achieving this
in the framework of the United Nations is almost non-existent due to diﬃculties in
deﬁning terrorism. A more homogenous group of states, such as the Council of
Europe member states, should be able to overcome this obstacle.
8. The Assembly is convinced that the motive behind an act of terrorism does not
change the nature of that act. Terrorism has no justiﬁcation and it must be
considered illegal, abhorrent, unacceptable and a crime against humanity.
9. As the Assembly has consistently stated in the past, action against terrorism must
at all times be consistent with the fundamental freedoms and human rights which it
is designed to protect. This is particularly so in the member states of the Council of
Europe which should also be sensitive to the deep-rooted reasons of the changing
nature of terrorism and promote dialogue between cultures and religions.
10. The Assembly is convinced that the root causes – poverty, exclusion, disparity and
desperation – which provide a fertile ground for the emergence and spread of
terrorism should be addressed.
11. The Assembly asks the Committee of Ministers:
(i) to begin work without delay on the elaboration of a comprehensive Council of
Europe convention on terrorism, based on the normative acquis of the United
Nations’, Council of Europe’s and European Union’s legal instruments and
other texts, and develop them as much as necessary;
(ii) to invite, in the meantime, the member states:
(a) to ratify existing conventions, or inform the Committee of Ministers
and the Assembly about the grounds for not doing so, in particular: the
European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism (1977) in conjunc-
tion with its Protocol (2003), the European Convention on Extradition
(1957) and its Additional Protocols (1975 and 1978), the European Con-
vention on the Transfer of Proceedings in Criminal Matters (1972), and
the Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Conﬁscation of the
Proceeds from Crime (1990);
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
622
 
www.ebook3000.com

(b) to condemn strongly countries encouraging, helping, providing ﬁnancial
support, or oﬀering safe haven to terrorists and introduce economic and
other appropriate measures against them;
(c) to promote democracy and human rights in their foreign relations and
refrain from complacency towards despotic and obscurantist regimes for
reasons of strategic and economic interests;
(iii)
to study, in consultation with the European Union, the possibility of trans-
forming Europol into an eﬀective pan-European agency, with suﬃcient
means to challenge international terrorism;
(iv)
to repeat the appeal to the member states, as stipulated in Parliamentary
Assembly Recommendation 1534, to ‘give urgent consideration to amending
and widening the Rome Statute to allow the remit of the International
Criminal Court to include acts of international terrorism’.
19. Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (May 2005)
The member States of the Council of Europe and the other Signatories hereto,
Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater unity
between its members;
Recognising the value of reinforcing co-operation with the other Parties to this
Convention;
Wishing to take eﬀective measures to prevent terrorism and to counter, in particular,
public provocation to commit terrorist oﬀences and recruitment and training for
terrorism;
Aware of the grave concern caused by the increase in terrorist oﬀences and the
growing terrorist threat;
Aware of the precarious situation faced by those who suﬀer from terrorism, and in
this connection reaﬃrming their profound solidarity with the victims of terrorism and
their families;
Recognising that terrorist oﬀences and the oﬀences set forth in this Convention, by
whoever perpetrated, are under no circumstances justiﬁable by considerations of a
political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature,
and recalling the obligation of all Parties to prevent such oﬀences and, if not pre-
vented, to prosecute and ensure that they are punishable by penalties which take into
account their grave nature;
Recalling the need to strengthen the ﬁght against terrorism and reaﬃrming that all
measures taken to prevent or suppress terrorist oﬀences have to respect the rule of law
and democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as other provi-
sions of international law, including, where applicable, international humanitarian law;
Recognising that this Convention is not intended to aﬀect established principles
relating to freedom of expression and freedom of association;
Recalling that acts of terrorism have the purpose by their nature or context to ser-
iously intimidate a population or unduly compel a government or an international
organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act or seriously destabilise or
destroy the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a
country or an international organisation;

Whenever a Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or otherwise
surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be
returned to that Party to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or
proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought, and
this Party and the Party seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option
and other terms they may deem appropriate, such a conditional extradition or
surrender shall be suﬃcient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 1.
Article 19
Extradition
1.
The oﬀences set forth in Articles 5 to 7 and 9 of this Convention shall be deemed to
be included as extraditable oﬀences in any extradition treaty existing between any
of the Parties before the entry into force of this Convention. Parties undertake to
include such oﬀences as extraditable oﬀences in every extradition treaty to be
subsequently concluded between them.
2.
When a Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty
receives a request for extradition from another Party with which it has no extradi-
tion treaty, the requested Party may, if it so decides, consider this Convention as a
legal basis for extradition in respect of the oﬀences set forth in Articles 5 to 7 and 9
of this Convention. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by
the law of the requested Party.
3.
Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall
recognise the oﬀences set forth in Articles 5 to 7 and 9 of this Convention as
extraditable oﬀences between themselves, subject to the conditions provided by the
law of the requested Party.
4.
Where necessary, the oﬀences set forth in Articles 5 to 7 and 9 of this Convention
shall be treated, for the purposes of extradition between Parties, as if they had been
committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of
the Parties that have established jurisdiction in accordance with Article 14.
5.
The provisions of all extradition treaties and agreements concluded between
Parties in respect of oﬀences set forth in Articles 5 to 7 and 9 of this Convention
shall be deemed to be modiﬁed as between Parties to the extent that they are
incompatible with this Convention.
Article 20
Exclusion of the political exception clause
1.
None of the oﬀences referred to in Articles 5 to 7 and 9 of this Convention, shall be
regarded, for the purposes of extradition or mutual legal assistance, as a political
oﬀence, an oﬀence connected with a political oﬀence, or as an oﬀence inspired by
political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition or for mutual legal assist-
ance based on such an oﬀence may not be refused on the sole ground that it
concerns a political oﬀence or an oﬀence connected with a political oﬀence or an
oﬀence inspired by political motives.
2.
Without prejudice to the application of Articles 19 to 23 of the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 to the other Articles of this Convention,
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
630

any State or the European Community may, at the time of signature or when
depositing its instrument of ratiﬁcation, acceptance, approval or accession of the
Convention, declare that it reserves the right to not apply paragraph 1 of this
Article as far as extradition in respect of an oﬀence set forth in this Convention is
concerned. The Party undertakes to apply this reservation on a case-by-case basis,
through a duly reasoned decision.
3.
Any Party may wholly or partly withdraw a reservation it has made in accordance
with paragraph 2 by means of a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of
the Council of Europe which shall become eﬀective as from the date of its receipt.
4.
A Party which has made a reservation in accordance with paragraph 2 of this
Article may not claim the application of paragraph 1 of this Article by any
other Party; it may, however, if its reservation is partial or conditional, claim the
application of this Article in so far as it has itself accepted it.
5.
The reservation shall be valid for a period of three years from the day of the entry
into force of this Convention in respect of the Party concerned. However, such
reservation may be renewed for periods of the same duration.
6.
Twelve months before the date of expiry of the reservation, the Secretary General
of the Council of Europe shall give notice of that expiry to the Party concerned.
No later than three months before expiry, the Party shall notify the Secretary
General of the Council of Europe that it is upholding, amending or withdrawing
its reservation. Where a Party notiﬁes the Secretary General of the Council of
Europe that it is upholding its reservation, it shall provide an explanation of the
grounds justifying its continuance. In the absence of notiﬁcation by the Party
concerned, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe shall inform that Party
that its reservation is considered to have been extended automatically for a period
of six months. Failure by the Party concerned to notify its intention to uphold or
modify its reservation before the expiry of that period shall cause the reservation to
lapse.
7.
Where a Party does not extradite a person in application of this reservation, after
receiving an extradition request from another Party, it shall submit the case, with-
out exception whatsoever and without undue delay, to its competent authorities for
the purpose of prosecution, unless the requesting Party and the requested Party
agree otherwise. The competent authorities, for the purpose of prosecution in the
requested Party, shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any
oﬀence of a grave nature under the law of that Party. The requested Party shall
communicate, without undue delay, the ﬁnal outcome of the proceedings to the
requesting Party and to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, who shall
forward it to the Consultation of the Parties provided for in Article 30.
8.
The decision to refuse the extradition request on the basis of this reservation shall
be forwarded promptly to the requesting Party. If within a reasonable time no
judicial decision on the merits has been taken in the requested Party according to
paragraph 7, the requesting Party may communicate this fact to the Secretary
General of the Council of Europe, who shall submit the matter to the Consultation
of the Parties provided for in Article 30. This Consultation shall consider the
matter and issue an opinion on the conformity of the refusal with the Convention
and shall submit it to the Committee of Ministers for the purpose of issuing a
declaration thereon. When performing its functions under this paragraph, the
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  C O U N C I L  O F  E U RO P E
631
 

Committee of Ministers shall meet in its composition restricted to the States
Parties.
Article 21
Discrimination clause
1.
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extra-
dite or to aﬀord mutual legal assistance, if the requested Party has substantial
grounds for believing that the request for extradition for oﬀences set forth in Art-
icles 5 to 7 and 9 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such oﬀences has
been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of
that person’s race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion or that
compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person’s position for any
of these reasons.
2.
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extra-
dite if the person who is the subject of the extradition request risks being exposed
to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
3.
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted either as imposing an obligation to
extradite if the person who is the subject of the extradition request risks being
exposed to the death penalty or, where the law of the requested Party does not
allow for life imprisonment, to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole,
unless under applicable extradition treaties the requested Party is under the obliga-
tion to extradite if the requesting Party gives such assurance as the requested Party
considers suﬃcient that the death penalty will not be imposed or, where imposed,
will not be carried out, or that the person concerned will not be subject to life
imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
Article 22
Spontaneous information
1.
Without prejudice to their own investigations or proceedings, the competent
authorities of a Party may, without prior request, forward to the competent
authorities of another Party information obtained within the framework of their
own investigations, when they consider that the disclosure of such information
might assist the Party receiving the information in initiating or carrying out
investigations or proceedings, or might lead to a request by that Party under this
Convention.
2.
The Party providing the information may, pursuant to its national law, impose
conditions on the use of such information by the Party receiving the information.
3.
The Party receiving the information shall be bound by those conditions.
4.
However, any Party may, at any time, by means of a declaration addressed to the
Secretary General of the Council of Europe, declare that it reserves the right not to
be bound by the conditions imposed by the Party providing the information under
paragraph 2 above, unless it receives prior notice of the nature of the information
to be provided and agrees to its transmission.

(9 December 1998)
1. Objective
To intensify cooperation between the Member States in combating the ﬁnancing of
terrorist groups.
2. Union measure
Council Recommendation of 9 December 1999 on cooperation in combating the
ﬁnancing of terrorist groups.
3. Contents
The Council recommends that national security services should exchange information
on a regular basis on the structures and modus operandi used for ﬁnancing terrorist
groups operating in more than one Member State. The conﬁdential information should
be transmitted through Bureau de Liaison channels.
The terrorist groups identiﬁed by the competent Council Working Party as present-
ing a speciﬁc threat should be examined more closely. Thanks to the exchange of
information, the competent national authorities will be able to look into the possibility
of taking measures against these groups. Joint initiatives could also be proposed by the
Council Working Party to the Member States that so wish it.
Europol should participate in this cooperation as far as possible.

4. EU/US Agreement on Extradition and
Mutual Legal Assistance
Abstract
Scrutiny
We regret the limited time available to us to examine the major constitutional, legal
and political issues arising from the two Agreements. These were declassiﬁed only in
May and the decision authorising their signature was taken at the Justice and Home
Aﬀairs Council on 6 June.
The Committee pressed hard for the text of the Agreements to be made public. We
refused to scrutinize them in secret and (jointly with the House of Commons European
Scrutiny Committee) we invited the Presidency to supply the text to all the parliaments
in the Union.
The ‘conﬁdential’ classiﬁcation on the Agreements after the negotiations between
the EU and the US had been concluded was unnecessary. It was also contrary to the
democratic accountability that ought to inform decisions by the EU institutions
regarding access to documents. We hope that in future a clearer understanding of the
requirements and importance of open government will prevail.
Extradition
The Agreement does not provide explicitly for the possibility of extradition being
refused on ECHR grounds. This is regrettable.
The Agreement does not preclude the prospect of the EU deciding to give primacy
to European Arrest Warrants over extradition requests by the US.
Mutual legal assistance
The wording of Article 4(1)(b) (on the identiﬁcation of bank information) is broad and
could cover a wide range of information about legitimate every day transactions of
innocent third parties.
It is unclear whether the establishment and operation of joint investigation teams
will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
There appear to be major diﬀerences in the data protection systems of the EU and
the US. We urge the Government to ensure that a high level of data protection is
required as a condition for the provision of information to the US authorities.
The Government’s assurances
We welcome the Government’s assurances that extradition can be refused by our
courts in the event of a successful ECHR challenge to extradition, including breach of
fair trial rights.
We also welcome the Government’s clariﬁcation that it will always seek assurances
when responding to extradition requests from the US that the death penalty is not
imposed, or if imposed, not executed.
There is no speciﬁc treatment of the capital punishment issue in the Mutual Legal
Assistance Agreement.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N

We welcome the Government’s assurance that the UK could—should it ever so wish—
properly decline to assist in such cases or could properly subject any co-operation
to conditions.
Chapter 1: Background
1.
The events of 11 September 2001 elevated EU-US co-operation in combating ter-
rorism to the top of the EU political agenda. Only nine days after the attack on the
Twin Towers, the Justice and Home Aﬀairs Council of 20 September called for the
adoption of a series of measures aimed at enhancing co-operation in criminal
matters. These included proposing to the United States that an agreement be nego-
tiated between the EU and the US, on the basis of Article 38 TEU, in the ﬁeld of
penal cooperation on terrorism (p 12, para. 7). The US expressed an interest in the
proposal, and letters were exchanged between President Bush and Mr Verhofstadt,
then President of the European Council. The willingness of the Union to conclude
such agreements was conﬁrmed at the European Council of 19 October in Ghent.
The Declaration by the Heads of State of the EU and the President of the Com-
mission which followed stated that the Union is prepared to engage with the United
States in reciprocal initiatives such as ‘facilitation of mutual judicial assistance
between the competent authorities of the US and of the Member States, as well as
extradition in connection with terrorism in accordance with the constitutional rules
of the Member States’.
2.
Following the conclusions of its informal meeting at Santiago de Compostella on
28 February 2002, the Justice and Home Aﬀairs Council adopted on 26 April 2002
a negotiating mandate for an agreement on judicial co-operation in criminal mat-
ters on the basis of Articles 38 and 24 TEU. The mandate extended beyond terror-
ism to cover in particular ‘extradition, including the temporary surrender for trials
and mutual legal assistance including the exchange of data, the setting up of joint
investigation teams, the giving of evidence (via video conference) and the estab-
lishment of single contact points’. Reﬂecting calls for not allowing extradition to
take place if the defendant could be sentenced to death, the Council conclusions
expressly stated that ‘the Union will make any agreement on extradition con-
ditional on the provision of guarantees on the non-imposition of capital punish-
ment sentences, and the securing of existing levels of constitutional guarantees
with regard to life sentences’.
3.
Negotiations began in the summer of 2002. Despite calls for information on their
themes and progress to be made public, they were conducted in secrecy. The
conclusions of the Justice and Home Aﬀairs Council of 28 November 2002 indi-
cate that the Council took note of the state of play and agreed on the strategy that
the Presidency would have to follow for the further conduct of negotiations.
Negotiations continued until the end of February 2003, when the Justice and
Home Aﬀairs Council decided to suspend them in order to allow time for delega-
tions to examine all relevant aspects of the texts in view of concerns on speciﬁc
points. The Council conclusions noted that if possible the Agreements should be
concluded in May or June after having involved the parliaments in an appropriate
manner.

Chapter 2: Scrutiny history
4.
The Committee was ﬁrst informed about the negotiations by a letter from
Bob Ainsworth MP, then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Home Oﬃce, on
29 May 2002. Mr Ainsworth provided some information on the content of the
negotiating mandate, but noted that the latter was a conﬁdential document not
falling within the normal criteria for scrutiny. He conﬁrmed that the Agreements
resulting from those negotiations would be submitted for parliamentary scrutiny
when presented to the Council for approval.
5.
Mr Ainsworth next wrote to the Committee on 30 January 2003. He noted that at
the meeting of 28 November 2002 the JHA Council agreed to changes in the
negotiating mandate, with provisions relating to the extradition of own nationals
and the narrowing of the political oﬀence exception being withdrawn. The Minis-
ter reiterated that the documents in question were conﬁdential and could not be
deposited for scrutiny. He reassured the Committee that he would provide the draft
Council Decision authorising the Presidency to conclude the agreement when it
became available and added: ‘at that time you will of course have an opportunity to
scrutinise the text in full’. Mr Ainsworth further noted that the Greek Government
did not anticipate conclusion of the Agreement during its Presidency.
6.
The conclusions of the February JHA Council however indicated that the Council
contemplated that the Agreement would be concluded during the Greek Presidency
(in May or June) after having undergone scrutiny by national parliaments. In the
light of these conclusions, the Committee wrote to the Home Oﬃce on 24 March
2003. We made clear our expectation that the draft Agreements would be deposited
in Parliament for scrutiny and that both this Committee and the House of Com-
mons European Scrutiny Committee would be given suﬃcient time to examine the
texts. We asked for the texts to be deposited as soon as possible.
7.
Mr Ainsworth replied on 27 March. He provided the Committee with a copy of the
draft Agreements but asked for these documents to be treated as conﬁdential since
they had been given an EU conﬁdential classiﬁcation. The Minister said that he
would deposit for scrutiny the unclassiﬁed Decision authorising the Presidency
to sign the Agreements, but that this deposit would not be accompanied by the
texts of the Agreements. He further noted that the Council Secretariat had advised
that it might not be possible to declassify the texts of the Agreements until after
they had been signed.
8.
The Committee refused to examine the Agreements on this ‘conﬁdential’ basis. In
our response of 3 April, we told the Minister that such an approach ‘would be
inconsistent with the principles of parliamentary scrutiny and how they have been
practised in this Parliament for many years’. No explanation had been given as to
why the documents had to remain classiﬁed as conﬁdential (Lord Filkin claimed
that this was necessary in order to protect the negotiating position of the parties—
letter of 17 April). We accordingly insisted that the documents be deposited in
Parliament for scrutiny in the usual way and noted that the manner in which the
Council, the Greek Presidency and the Government were dealing with the
matter raised ‘issues of substantial constitutional signiﬁcance both for the Union
and the UK’.
9.
In addition to our correspondence with the Government, we took the
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
647
 

unprecedented step of also writing, jointly with the Commons European Scrutiny
Committee, a letter to the EU Presidency. The letter (dated 10 April) invited the
Presidency ‘to supply to this Parliament and to all the parliaments in the Union
copies of the draft Agreements so that they can undertake scrutiny of them in an
appropriate manner, namely publicly and meaningfully and with suﬃcient time to
consider the constitutional, legal and political issues raised by the Agreements’.
The letter also proposed that, consistently with the spirit of the Protocol on the
Role of National Parliaments annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, national
parliaments be allowed six weeks to consider the draft Agreements.
10. The Agreements were ﬁnally declassiﬁed in early May and deposited for scrutiny on
13 May.
We welcome the de-classiﬁcation of the documents but regret the tight deadlines
imposed on the Committee, which left limited time to examine the complex issues
arising from them. Time was limited because the Decision authorising the Presi-
dency to conclude the Agreements (also held under scrutiny by our Committee)
was on the agenda for adoption at the JHA Council of 5–6 June. The Committee
decided that the best way forward in these circumstances would be to invite the
Minister to give oral evidence on June 4. In his appearance before the Committee,
Mr Ainsworth conﬁrmed that the Government ‘will potentially be overriding scru-
tiny’ on June 6 (Q 1). This was the day on which the Justice and Home Aﬀairs
Council proposed to authorise the Presidency to designate the person to sign the
Agreements at the EU-US Summit on 25 June.
11. On the basis of the evidence given by the Minister and his team, and in particular
the assurances he provided on human rights aspects, the Committee decided to
clear the documents from scrutiny.
We have recorded these assurances in our letter to Mr Ainsworth of 12 June. We
nevertheless considered that it was important to examine some of the issues arising
from the Agreements in greater detail. That is the purpose of this Report. We are
grateful to our Specialist Adviser, Professor William Gilmore, for his assistance in
this task.
12. Before turning to these issues, however, we must record our opinion that the deci-
sion of the Presidency to retain the ‘conﬁdential’ classiﬁcation on these Agreements
after the negotiations between the EU and the US had been concluded and their
content had been agreed both by the EU Member States and by the US was unneces-
sary and contrary to the democratic accountability that ought to inform decisions by
EU institutions regarding access to documents.
The decision was also, of course, inimical to the proper conduct of scrutiny pro-
cedures by national Parliaments and was responsible for the time constraints within
which the Committee had to carry out its scrutiny. The decision is especially regret-
table in the context of the eﬀective parliamentary scrutiny of multilateral Treaties.
It is in marked contrast to the position in the United States where the Senate
advises on and consents to the ratiﬁcation of Treaties that are not self-executing.
We express the hope that in future a clearer understanding of the requirements and
importance of open government will prevail.

Chapter 3: The agreements—general
Added value
13. It is important to bear in mind that the EU-US Agreements here in question are
not intended to substitute existing bilateral arrangements between the US and
Member States but to supplement them.
All 15 Member States have bilateral extradition treaties in place with the US while
11 had, at the time when negotiations began, concluded mutual legal assistance
treaties with the US. Nor, as the Home Oﬃce pointed out in its Explanatory
Memorandum dated 13 May 2003, do the Agreements preclude the conclusion of
more favourable bilateral arrangements in the future (para. 15). It follows that the
EU-US Agreements will have a diﬀerent impact on each Member State. In other
words the ‘added value’ which they provide will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdic-
tion: the more recent the bilateral arrangements and the more comprehensive their
scope, the less the signiﬁcance of these Agreements.
14. In his evidence to the Committee, Mr Ainsworth stated that the Agreements ‘do
add value, probably not nearly as great to the United Kingdom as most other
European jurisdictions’ (Q 5). He further noted that the Extradition Agreement is
of procedural, rather than substantive value for the UK but of greater value for
other Member States as it extends extradition arrangements to a broader range of
oﬀences based on a penalty threshold and not on a list of oﬀences (QQ 7, 10).
15. UK/US extradition arrangements will be covered primarily by the new bilateral
extradition treaty signed on 31 March 2003 and laid before Parliament as a Com-
mand Paper in May. The Minister conﬁrmed that the Government’s intention to
enter into a new bilateral UK-US extradition treaty preceded the EU initiative and
that it was always intended that the bilateral treaty would go further than the EU/
US agreement. Bilateral negotiations were said not to have been inﬂuenced by
the discussions at the EU level (QQ 18, 19).
16. The conclusions of the JHA Council of 5–6 June also refer to the added value
brought by the Agreements. By way of illustration, the Extradition Agreement leaves
to the exclusive competence of the Member States the question of how to deal with
competing requests for surrender from the International Criminal Court and extra-
dition requests from the US; it also makes provision for consultations regarding the
protection to be given to sensitive information to be supplied by the requested State.
The Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement on the other hand would add value by
improving co-operation in the area of investigations into ﬁnancial elements of ser-
ious crime. It also includes provisions allowing the use of modern telecommunica-
tion techniques for the exchange of mutual legal assistance requests and replies.
Scope
17. As mentioned above, the political impetus for the conclusion of the agreements was
generated by the events of 11 September 2001. The link of the Agreements with the
war on terror was regarded as justifying the need to agree the authorising Decision
on 6 June and the potential overriding of the scrutiny reserve by the Government.
Mr Ainsworth told us:
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
649
 

‘We do not feel that it is appropriate on measures like this, which are part of
the counterterrorism package that was agreed at the Extraordinary Council in
September 2001, that we, the British Government, should be seen to be drag-
ging our feet, or failing in our commitment to introduce measures to ﬁght
organised crime and terrorism’ (Q 1).
18. We note, however, that the scope of the Agreements is much broader than terrorism
and organised crime. The penalty threshold is set so as to permit extradition in
cases of any oﬀence punishable by deprivation of liberty of one year or more
(Article 4(1) of the Extradition Agreement).
Mutual legal assistance in identifying bank information will apply when a nat-
ural or legal person is ‘suspected of or charged with a criminal oﬀence’ (Article
4(1)(a) of the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement). The Agreement enables the
establishment of joint investigation teams ‘for the purpose of facilitating criminal
investigations or prosecutions involving the US and one or more Member States’
(Article 5(1)). Generally speaking, mutual legal assistance arrangements may thus
apply without any penalty threshold to any oﬀence. In short, while the Agreements
may have been prompted by terrorist activity they are not conﬁned to or focused on
oﬀences in that category.
Inﬂuences
19. Viewed from a European perspective it is clear that measures concerning judicial
cooperation previously agreed within the Union constituted a major source of
inspiration in the formulation of the EU-US Agreements. In this regard it will be
recalled that the 2000 EU Convention on mutual assistance and its Protocol
focused on expanding the scope of judicial co-operation to new areas (such as the
creation of joint investigation teams and facilitating the identiﬁcation of bank
accounts and the exchange of information on the operation of such accounts) as
well as modernising procedures to render co-operation more eﬀective and timely.
Somewhat similar concerns have informed internal Union initiatives in the ﬁeld of
extradition culminating in the Framework Decision on the European Arrest
Warrant.
20. It was equally apparent, however, that these precedents could not be applied with-
out modiﬁcation to the somewhat diﬀerent circumstances and challenges posed in
regulating mutual assistance and extradition relationships with a third state. As the
Explanatory Memorandum of 13 May noted, for example, none of the ‘mutual
recognition’ provisions (such as the abolition of dual criminality or the recognition
of judicial decisions) contained in the European Arrest Warrant ﬁnd reﬂection in
the EU-US Extradition Agreement (para. 17). Similarly, while under the Arrest
Warrant there is to be surrender of ‘own nationals’ and the elimination of the
political oﬀence exception these two important features are not repeated in the text
here in question.
However, we note that the European Convention on the Suppression of
Terrorism of 1977 has been re-examined of late within a Council of Europe
context and that an amending Protocol has been concluded. It is relevant that this
has been formulated in such a way as to permit the United States to become a
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

party. Should it elect to do so this would, in part, address the ‘gap’ in the EU-US
text in relation to the operation of the political oﬀence exception in terrorism
cases.
Chapter 4: Extradition
Human rights safeguards
21. There is no substantive provision in the Agreement explicitly regulating instances
in which there may be a ECHR bar to extradition. The Preamble to the Agreement
refers to the Parties having ‘due regard for rights of individuals and the rule of law’
(third recital). Article 17(2) on the other hand enables ‘consultations’ to take place
between the requested and requesting States ‘where the constitutional principles of,
or ﬁnal judicial decisions binding upon, the requested State may pose an impedi-
ment to fulﬁlment of its obligation to extradite’. The reference to ‘ﬁnal binding
judicial decisions’ was added in the very last stages of the negotiations and may be
read as covering decisions by the European Court of Justice and the European
Court of Human Rights. The Greek Minister of Justice Mr Petsalnikos (who
chaired the JHA Council during the Greek Presidency) emphasised to the Euro-
pean Parliament’s Citizens’ Rights Committee that this provision ‘has no precedent
and it certainly constitutes the common point between these agreements and the
European Convention on Human Rights’.
22. In his evidence to the Committee, Mr Ainsworth repeatedly emphasised that noth-
ing in the Agreement was intended to disturb the current domestic law position in
the UK that extradition would be refused by our courts in the event of a successful
ECHR challenge to extradition (QQ 47, 56, 58, 59). The Minister further con-
ﬁrmed that Article 17(2) constituted an implied ground for refusal of extradition
on ECHR grounds (Q 67) and that that interpretation was shared by other
Member States (QQ 64, 65). We welcome the Minister’s assurances. It would be
preferable, however, if the Agreement explicitly provided for the possibility of extradi-
tion being refused on ECHR grounds, as the Convention forms an integral part
of Union law. Such express reference would constitute considerable ‘added value’ in
an agreement concluded between the EU (and not each Member State individually)
and the US. It might also enhance human rights safeguards in future bilateral agree-
ments between Member States and the US, which must, according to Article 18, be
consistent with this Agreement.
Capital punishment
23. Article 13 enables extradition to be granted ‘on the condition that the death penalty
shall not be imposed on the person sought, or if for procedural reasons such
condition cannot be complied with by the requesting State, on condition that the
death penalty if imposed shall not be carried out’. The wording is a departure from
the initial negotiating mandate, which envisaged guarantees on the non-imposition
(and not the non-execution) of capital punishment sentences (see para. 2 above).
By way of explanation Government oﬃcials indicated that the wording used
reﬂected the fact that in some states courts were obliged to impose the death
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
651
 

penalty for certain oﬀences but ‘it is then discretionary whether or not it is carried
out’ (Q 80).
24. Article 13 has been criticised by Amnesty International, on various grounds includ-
ing the leaving of what it considers ‘an unacceptable margin of discretion with
regard to conditioning and refusing extradition in the face of the death penalty’.
The Citizens’ Rights Committee of the European Parliament was, however, more
positive in its assessment. Its Report pointed out that ‘contrary to what is the case
at present under almost all bilateral extradition treaties, the non-execution of the
death penalty by the US Administration is not contingent upon assurances on a
case-by-case basis to be provided by the US Administration in every case on an ad
hoc basis, it may be imposed as a condition by an EU Member State from which the
United States seeks the extradition of a person’. This is a welcome step.
25. It should be noted that, pursuant to Article 3(i)(j), Article 13 ‘may be applied by the
requested State in place of, or in the absence of, bilateral treaty provisions govern-
ing capital punishment’. Consistent with UK practice the new bilateral treaty with
the US contains (in Article 7) such a provision. Under it extradition may be refused
‘unless the Requesting State provides an assurance that the death penalty will not
be imposed or, if imposed, will not be carried out’. In evidence to us the Government
emphasised that they will always seek appropriate assurances in death penalty cases.
This has been the practice for many years and it was stressed that there has never
been an instance in which such assurances have not been fully honoured (QQ 16,
80, 81). We welcome this clariﬁcation.
26. Death penalty concerns can also arise in the context of the relaxation of the protec-
tions aﬀorded by the doctrine of speciality (specialty). In contrast to Article 27 of
the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant the EU-US Extradition
Agreement does not contain detailed treatment of this important topic. We note,
however, that Article 18 of the new UK-US bilateral treaty does. In this regard we
welcome the indication that the relaxation of the rule of speciality contained in
Article 18(1)(a) is not intended to lessen protection for the individual in a capital
punishment context. It is our understanding from the Government’s oral evidence to
us that if, post extradition, a charge for a capital oﬀence were to be substituted for, or
added to, the extradition oﬀence not carrying such a penalty, even though based on the
same facts, the Government would regard it as an act of bad faith for the capital
oﬀence to be prosecuted otherwise than on the footing that the death penalty would
not be imposed or, if imposed, would not be executed (QQ 99, 100).
Military tribunals
27. There has been great concern over whether the extradition agreement would allow
extradition to the US of suspects who could face trial in a military tribunal. One of
the Recommendations of the European Parliament’s Citizens’ Rights Committee,
which was endorsed by the plenary, has been that the Agreements ‘should explicitly
exclude every form of judicial co-operation with American exceptional and/or
military courts and that all discrimination should be abolished between European
and American citizens which might arise from application of the Patriot Act and of
the Homeland Security Act’.
28. Along with the general human rights safeguards mentioned above (which would
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
652
 
www.ebook3000.com

include fair trial rights), the Preamble of the Extradition Agreement states that the
Parties are ‘mindful of the guarantees under their respective legal systems which
provide for the right to a fair trial to an extradited person, including the right to
adjudication by an impartial tribunal established pursuant to law’. This is a wel-
come (even if indirect) acknowledgement of this important matter, though its legal
force is debatable. This also departs from the wording of the ECHR which requires
an ‘independent’ and impartial tribunal (Q 62). Once more we note the Minister’s
assurances that extradition will be refused by our courts in the event of a successful
ECHR challenge to extradition including breach of fair trial rights (QQ 47, 56, 58,
59). We recommend that the Government adopt a practice of requiring, as a condition
of extradition in cases where trial before a military tribunal or other similar
exceptional court is an option under US or State law (as the case may be), an assur-
ance that the extradited person will be tried before a normal federal or State court.
Concurrent requests—relationship with the European Arrest Warrant
29. A controversial issue during the negotiation of the Agreement was whether
requests pursuant to the European Arrest Warrant should take precedence over
extradition requests by the US. The French Government has sought to delete
Article 10(2) which treated European Arrest Warrants as normal extradition
requests received by Member States for the purposes of the agreement. The Article
went through a last minute amendment to address these concerns. According to the
Government, the amendment is designed to ensure that should the EU decide in
the future that European Arrest Warrants should be aﬀorded primacy, the EU
would not be bound by this Agreement to set aside that primacy in the case of a
request by the US (Q 104). This has been reinforced by Article 21, which provides
for the agreement to be reviewed no later than ﬁve years after its entry into force
and that the review may include issues ‘such as the consequences of further devel-
opment of the European Union relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
including Article 10’. However, Article 11 envisages simpliﬁed extradition with the
consent of the individual concerned and stipulates that such consent may include
waiver of protection of the rule of speciality. ‘A person extradited under this Treaty
may not be detained, tried, or punished in the Requesting State except for: (a) any
oﬀence for which extradition was granted, or a diﬀerently denominated oﬀence
based on the same facts as the oﬀence on which extradition was granted, provided
such oﬀence is extraditable, or is a lesser included oﬀence’.
Chapter 5: Mutual legal assistance
Capital punishment
30. The Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement does not contain any provision equiva-
lent to Article 13 of the extradition instrument providing safeguards in death pen-
alty cases. There is only a reference in the Preamble to ‘due regard for rights of
individuals and the rule of law’. Mr Ainsworth noted that ‘this is a diﬃcult area’, as
it is not at all clear that assistance should be a priori refused in all cases that may
involve the imposition of the death penalty (which could include serious terrorist
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
653
 

oﬀences). The Minister noted that decisions will be taken on a case-by-case basis
(QQ 108, 110). We welcome the Minister’s assurance that, notwithstanding the
absence of speciﬁc treatment of the capital punishment issue in the Agreement, the
UK could—should it ever so wish—properly decline to assist in such cases or could
properly subject any cooperation to conditions.
Identiﬁcation of bank information and beyond
31. The 2001 Protocol to the EU Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance contains
several provisions on access to bank information. As the Explanatory Memo-
randum of 13 May 2003 points out, Article 4 of the EU-US Agreement on Mutual
Legal Assistance is designed, in eﬀect, to extend to the US certain of those Proto-
col provisions (para. 24). These are of particular relevance to international eﬀorts
to combat money laundering. However, Article 4(1)(b), which is not drafted with
elegance or clarity, has no direct parallel in the 2001 Protocol.
32. Article 4(1)(b) provides for mutual legal assistance for the purpose of identifying
information regarding natural or legal persons convicted ‘or otherwise involved in
a criminal oﬀence’, information in the possession of ‘non-bank ﬁnancial institu-
tions’ or ‘ﬁnancial transactions unrelated to accounts’. Mr Ainsworth was asked to
clarify the meaning of these rather vague terms. He understood the term ‘otherwise
involved’ to mean someone who is under investigation and conﬁrmed that the
Government would require ‘some assurance that there was an actual investigation
going on’ (QQ 112, 113). Identiﬁcation might also involve innocent third parties
whose accounts might be used for money laundering without their knowledge
(Q 114). ‘Non-bank ﬁnancial institutions’ would include organisations such as
bureaux de change (QQ 116, 117) and ‘ﬁnancial transactions unrelated to accounts’
would also involve bureaux de change (Q 118). We welcome the Minister’s partial
clariﬁcation of the terms included in Article 4(1)(b) and his assurance that assistance
would be provided only if an actual investigation was going on and the assistance
requested was proportionate. The terms, however, remain broad and the provision
as drafted could extend to a wide range of information about legitimate everyday
transactions of, as the Government admitted, ‘innocent third parties’.
Joint investigation teams
33. Article 5 enables the establishment of joint investigation teams to operate in the
respective territories of the US and the Member States involved. The procedures
under which these teams will operate will be ‘as agreed between the competent
authorities responsible for the investigation or prosecution of criminal oﬀences as
determined by the respective States concerned’ (Article 5(2)). It is therefore not
clear whether the operation of these teams, including aspects such as the liability of
participating members, would be determined by legislation—and would therefore be
subject to parliamentary scrutiny—or would merely take the form of an executive
agreement between prosecutors or law enforcement authorities. The approach here is
in sharp contrast with the regulation of joint investigation teams in the EU, where
speciﬁc rules on their powers, criminal and civil liability and data protection issues
have been established by Third Pillar legislation. The Minister’s response was not
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
654
 
www.ebook3000.com

entirely clear-cut. He noted that the UK/US mutual legal assistance treaty ‘does
not prevent joint investigations from being established’ and his oﬃcials noted that
it is ‘quite likely perhaps for the Chief Constable of the force here to be legally
answerable for torts’ (Q 121). It was then noted that there was provision in the
Police Act 1996 (as amended) to deal with such teams in relation to co-operation
with EU members and that ‘similar arrangements no doubt would be applied’
(Q 125).
Assistance to administrative authorities
34. Article 8 allows for mutual legal assistance to be provided to national and ‘other’
administrative authorities investigating a case with a view to a criminal prosecu-
tion, or to referral of the case to criminal investigators or prosecution authorities.
It is to be read in conjunction with the detailed Explanatory Note appended to
the Agreement. The Government conﬁrmed that assistance will not be provided if
the requesting authority does not have proper competence in criminal matters
(Q 126). We welcome this assurance.
Data protection
35. Article 9 contains a series of data protection safeguards, but no reference is made
to speciﬁc data protection instruments such as the 1981 Council of Europe Data
Protection Convention, the EC data protection Directive and the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights. This may be a cause of concern in view of the diﬀerent
systems of protecting data in the EU and the US. The issue was highlighted during
the scrutiny of the Agreement between Europol and the US on the exchange of
personal data which the Committee carried out last year and also by the European
Parliament Citizens’ Rights Committee, which said, in relation to the EU-US
Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement, that there were ‘no common principles on
which to act with regard to (a) the correct use of data (b) the integrity thereof and
(c) the rights of the data subject’. Article 9(2)(b) further states that ‘generic restric-
tions with respect to the legal standards of the requesting State for processing
personal data may not be imposed by the requested State as a condition . . . to
providing evidence or information’. We urge the Government to ensure that a high
level of data protection, consistent with EU legislation and the 1981 Council of
Europe Data Protection Convention, is required as a condition for the provision of
information to the US.
Recommendation
36. The Agreements raise important questions to which the attention of the House
should be drawn.
We make this Report to the House for information.

5. European Union Extradition Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/419)
(20 March 2002)
The European Union Extradition Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/419) came into force on
20 March 2002. They give eﬀect to the 1995 Convention on Simpliﬁed Extradition
Procedures between Member States of the European Union and the 1996 Convention
Relating to Extradition between Member States of the European Union. The two
Conventions modify the European Convention on Extradition (ECE) so far as the
European Union Member States are concerned.
The provisions of the Conventions only apply to requests made after the coming into
force of the Regulations. The arrangements are limited to those countries in respect of
which the Conventions are in force as between them and the UK. Belgium, France and
Italy have yet to ratify the 1995 Convention; France and Italy have yet to ratify the
1996 Convention.
The 1995 Convention sets out streamlined procedures for cases where the fugitive
and the requested state consent to extradition. When a person is arrested following an
extradition request, they are to be informed of the possibility of consenting to their
surrender under the simpliﬁed procedure and of the conditions under which consent
can be given. The individual must be surrendered within 20 days of the requested state
making its decision.
Consent may not be revoked and in consenting to extradition the fugitive is also
renouncing the protections of speciality – being tried only for oﬀences for which
extradited – and of not being re-extradited to another country.
The 1996 Convention:
•
reduces the extradition crime threshold, from 12 months in both states, to 12 months
in the requesting state, and just 6 months in the requested state;
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
656
 
www.ebook3000.com

•
abolishes the political oﬀence exception whereby an individual cannot be extra-
dited if the oﬀence for which their extradition is sought is an oﬀence of a political
character;
•
abolishes speciality so that a person may be prosecuted for an oﬀence committed
before surrender other than that upon which the request for extradition was based,
where the new oﬀence is not punishable by imprisonment or any other form of
detention or where the person will not be detained in connection with his trial,
sentence or appeal; and
•
relaxes authentication requirements, which is particular important for the UK
since it is widely recognised that the UK’s authentication requirements are amongst
the most onerous in Europe.
The Regulations make amendments to the Extradition Act 1989 in order to achieve the
above changes. There are also some provisions in the 1996 Convention which are being
implemented without the need to amend the 1989 Act. The main ones are:
•
relaxing the principle of dual criminality for the oﬀence of conspiracy or criminal
association to commit certain serious crimes, including terrorist oﬀences.
•
providing that extradition is not to be refused for oﬀences related to taxes, duties,
customs and exchange which correspond under the law of the requested Member
State to a similar oﬀence.
•
providing for the extradition of own nationals. The UK already has no bar upon
the extradition of own nationals. A number of the other Member States have made
reservations so that they will still not yet extradite own nationals, while others have
set conditions usually to the eﬀect that if convicted, their nationals will be returned
to serve their sentences in their own countries.
The provisions do not aﬀect our extradition arrangements with Ireland as these are
regulated by separate reciprocal legislation. However, for the ﬁrst time, it will be pos-
sible to extradite people for ﬁscal oﬀences between the United Kingdom and Ireland.
For the United Kingdom, this too came into force on 20 March 2002 as a result of the
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (Commencement No.13 Order) 2002, with
parallel legislation in Ireland expected to have come into force on the same date.
6. EU Action in Response to 11 September 2001: One year After
(Declaration on 11 September 2002)
The European Union responded swiftly to the terrorist attacks of the 11 September
2001. Within days of the attacks on America, a series of concrete measures were tabled
by the European Commission, which led to a Plan of Action adopted by a special
European Council on the 21st September.
Over the past year, the European Union has sustained its eﬀorts as one of the
leading partners in the global ﬁght against terrorism. Implementing the Plan of
Action, all EU eﬀorts are guided by:
•
continued solidarity with the US,
•
determination in the ﬁght against terrorism,
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
657
 

•
commitment to the security of all citizens in the EU,
•
eﬀorts to tackle root causes of terrorism, and
•
contributions to better understanding between civilisations.
The EU has focused on those areas where it can complement the eﬀorts made by
individual Member States:
•
Police and judicial co-operation.
•
Europe-wide and transatlantic co-operation in the ﬁght against international ter-
rorism and cross-border organised crime has been stepped up, including on extradi-
tion, mutual legal assistance, migration and border control.
•
The EU adopted a European arrest warrant, a common deﬁnition of terrorism and
a list of terrorist organisations. In addition, joint police investigation teams across
the EU and a special Europol anti-terrorism unit have been created, as well as
Eurojust, a co-ordinating body between Member States’ law enforcement agencies.
•
Global ﬁght against terrorism.
•
Diplomatic eﬀorts, supported by the quick mobilisation of trade and aid, have
focused on Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, the Middle East and the Euro-
Mediterranean Partnership. The EU is the main international donor to Afghani-
stan, providing generous ﬁnancial assistance to alleviate human suﬀering, to help
integrate returning refugees and to support the Transitional Authority.
The EU has incorporated the ﬁght against terrorism into all aspects of the EU’s
external relations. While implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1373 it went
beyond UN sanctions and froze the assets of an important number of terrorist organ-
isations. The EU has agreed joint law enforcement actions in the ﬁght against terrorism
with a great number of third countries throughout this year. At the same time the EU
has encouraged dialogue to promote mutual understanding with other civilisations.
Air transport security has been improved with Europe-wide measures to prevent
future terrorist attacks and the air transport industry has been supported.
Economic and ﬁnancial measures have been taken to dry up the sources of terrorist
funding through intensiﬁed money laundering directives.
Emergency preparedness has been increased to protect public health and enhance
civil protection in the event of terrorist attacks through the availability of medicinal
treatment and the creation of a Monitoring and Information Centre providing for
immediate response in the case of major emergencies 24 hours a day.
Police and judicial co-operation
By September 13, the Commission had tabled proposals for a European arrest warrant
to supplant the current system of extradition between Member States and a common
deﬁnition of terrorism and related penalties. Both proposals have been formally
adopted by the Council. They represent the ﬁrst of many measures against all forms of
cross-border organised crime, including terrorism. Other measures which are underway
include:
•
Joint investigation teams of police and magistrates from throughout the EU;
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
658
 
www.ebook3000.com

•
Routine exchange of information about terrorism between the Member States and
Europol;
•
The creation of a specialist anti-terrorist unit within Europol;
•
The establishment of Eurojust, a co-ordination body composed of magistrates,
prosecutors and police oﬃcers;
•
Political agreement of the Council on a framework directive on the mutual recogni-
tion between EU Member States judicial authorities on orders for the freezing of
assets and the preservation of evidence.
Closer transatlantic co-operation:
•
A co-operation agreement between Europol and the relevant US authorities was
signed on 6 December 2001. A second agreement to allow the exchange of personal
data is currently being negotiated;
•
The EU is also engaged in talks with the United States to establish closer co-
operation with Eurojust and the relevant US authorities;
•
Eﬀorts are underway to intensify co-operation in practical ways on border control
and migration management;
•
EU Justice Ministers agreed in April 2002 to begin negotiations with the US on
closer co-operation on extradition and mutual legal assistance; negotiations are
proceeding as planned;
•
Eﬀorts are being made to strengthen co-operation between relevant law enforce-
ment authorities in the US and in each of the EU member states.

Global ﬁght against terrorism
The EU has adopted the ﬁght against terrorism as a priority policy objective. It has
worked with the US to build a global coalition against terrorism, and to establish joint
initiatives designed to defeat international terrorism. The ﬁght against terrorism has
been incorporated into all aspects of the Union’s external relations:
Horizontal actions:
•
EC external assistance programmes support the eﬀorts of third counties to comply
with UNSC Resolution 1373 on the ﬁght against terrorism, and further consider-
ation is being given to how further technical assistance could be made available;
•
Freeze of terrorist assets: A Regulation freezing funds and prohibiting provision of
funds, assets, economic resources or ﬁnancial services to terrorists was adopted in
December 2001. Since 1999, over 100 million of terrorists’ assets have been frozen
throughout the EU;
•
The events of September 11 demonstrated the need for political and cultural
dialogue with those parts of the world where terrorism comes into being. The EU
has supported dialogue to counter racial, religious and cultural prejudice. A Euro-
Mediterranean Foundation is to be set up under the Barcelona Process Firm com-
mitments to enhanced inter-cultural dialogue have been made at a meeting of EU

Member States, Candidate Countries and the Organisation of the Islamic Confer-
ence in Istanbul on 12–13 February 2002.
Bilateral relations with third countries and regions:
The European Union has redoubled its diplomatic eﬀorts towards building an inter-
national coalition against terrorism:
•
Afghanistan: The EU is the main donor helping to rebuild Afghanistan through
reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. At the Tokyo donors’ conference in
January 2002, the contributions of the European Commission and of individual
EU Member States together, made Europe the most generous contributor. The EC
alone, has pledged 1 billion over the next ﬁve years;
•
In 2002 the EC will go beyond its Tokyo pledge for this year, giving 265 million
instead of 200 million. The sum available for humanitarian assistance has been
raised to 60 million from 25 million;
This money has not merely been committed, but is being deployed on the ground very
swiftly. The EC is contributing more than any other donor to the operating costs of
the new government (including salaries for police, nurses, doctors, teachers and civil
servants). It is supporting 450 primary schools, and 200 clinics, and cleaning up ﬁve
cities around the country to prevent diseases like cholera. It is also making a major
contribution to the clearance of mines and the ﬁght against poppy production.

(Humanitarian Assistance)
•
The EU responded to Pakistan’s changed position on the Taliban regime and its
commitments to return to democratic rule, with increased ﬁnancial assistance
and a new Co-operation Agreement. A package of trade measures designed to
signiﬁcantly improve access for Pakistani exports to the EU has been approved.
Furthermore, the Commission has mounted a major Election Observation
Mission in the run up to the Parliamentary elections on October 12 in order to
assist this country in its diﬃcult transition process towards restoration of full
democracy;
•
Negotiating directives for a Trade and Co-operation Agreement with Iran have
been adopted by the Council. Negotiations will start in Autumn 2002, including on
an intensiﬁed political dialogue. The EU calls on Iran to promote and protect
human rights and fundamental freedoms, to sign, ratify and fully implement inter-
national instruments pertaining to the non-proliferation of arms and to join in the
international ﬁght against terrorism;
•
The EU was already deeply involved in the search for peace and stability in the
Middle East long before the attacks of September 11 2001, but those events have
undoubtedly thrown into even sharper focus, the urgent need to tackle regional
problems that can give rise to terrorism. The EU plays a crucial role in preserving
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

the Paliestinian Authority as a negotiating partner, by providing substantial
ﬁnancial assistance. The EU is also a key player in the ‘Quartet’ (EU, US, UN and
Russia) eﬀorts to ﬁnd a way forward in the Middle East, and has just prepared a
‘road-map’ to guide actions on all sides towards the creation of a Palestinian State
in 3 years’ time;
•
Commitments to co-operate closely in the ﬁght against terrorism have been
included in or agreed alongside new Association Agreements between the EU,
Algeria, Lebanon and Chile;
•
Concrete international commitments to ﬁght against terrorism have been agreed
upon with the United States, Russia, the 13 accession candidates, Norway, Iceland
and Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and the western Balkan
countries, the 12 partner countries of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, Israel,
Canada, and India, as well as the Council of Europe. At the Ninth Ministerial
Council of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),
in December 2001 Ministers adopted a broad-ranging Action Plan on counter-
terrorism measures.
Air transport security
The air transport sector was the hardest hit by the consequences of the 11 September
2001 terrorist attacks in the US. Over the last twelve months, the European Commis-
sion has continuously acted to deal with the security, commercial and ﬁnancial
consequences of the attacks for the sector.
New proposals have been put forward to support the industry in areas such as insur-
ance, unfair competition and ﬁnancial compensations. New initiatives have also been
launched to increase security and prevent terrorist acts.
These measures were outlined in a Commission Communication of 10 October 2001
which explored the situation of the industry, gave an overview of measures taken by
Member States and looked speciﬁcally at the way the US was reacting. Based on this
analysis, the Commission made, concrete proposals for enhanced air security rules and
outlined areas of action in a number of ﬁelds, including air transport insurance, state
aid management, slots, capacity co-ordination and third country relations.
Prevention of illegal acts threatening security, notably through the International Civil
Aviation Organisation (ICAO):
•
New common rules on air security. The Commission proposed new common rules
for air security: control of access to sensitive areas of airports and aircraft; control
of passengers and their hand luggage; control and monitoring of hold luggage;
control of cargo and mail; training of ground staﬀ; classiﬁcation of weapons and
other items prohibited on board or into the sensitive areas of airports. These new
rules include the audit for such measures and will become EU legislation once the
Commission’s proposed Regulation is adopted (8);
•
The European Commission is co-ordinating the EU position in ICAO on new
regulations on access to the cockpit, including strengthened doors, and remote
surveillance of the cockpit.
Material support to the industry:
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
661
 

•
Financial compensation by member states for lost business during the four days
following 11 September was claimed and received by many airlines;
•
Governmental insurance schemes in many Member States have taken on insurance
cover which was lost when insurance companies cancelled their policies based on
war risk clauses. The Commission outlined the way forward in a Communication
in July 2002 and will propose soon an air insurance package dealing with both
insurable and non-insurable risks in the aviation industry;
•
Agreements between airlines: the Commission made clear that it would examine on
a case-by-case basis whether the conditions for an exemption under EC competi-
tion rules of the Treaty are met. It will also give favourable consideration to the
capacity co-ordination agreements designed to maintain a regular service on less
frequented routes or to co-ordinate schedules during oﬀ-peak periods of the day;
•
Slots: The Commission considered that the airlines were entitled to retain their
slots with grandfather status in EU airports during the summer 2002 and the
winter 2002/2003 seasons;
•
Unfair competition: The Commission proposed on 12 March 2003 (12) legal means
to react against unfair competition from subsidised third country airlines exploiting
subsidies to undercut normal market prices for air transport services.

Economic and ﬁnancial policy
One key EU aim is to dry up the sources of terrorist funding. The 19 October 2001
European Council in Ghent reiterated the importance of eﬀective measures to combat
the funding of terrorism by formal adoption of the Directive on money laundering and
the speedy ratiﬁcation by all Member States of the United Nations Convention for the
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
•
The EU Council of Ministers adopted in November 2001 a Commission proposal
to upgrade the EU’s money laundering Directive which will now be implemented by
national legislation in each EU Member State;
•
The Commission and the Member States are playing an active role in the work of
the Financial Action Task Force, the leading international body in the ﬁght against
money laundering and the ﬁnancing of terrorism. At its last plenary meeting in
October 2001 in Washington, the FATF adopted a series of recommendations to
combat the ﬁnancing of terrorism;
•
In the wake of moves by insurance companies drastically increasing the cost of
cover for acts of war or terrorism, for airlines and airports, the Commission asked
the Council of Finance Ministers to come up with a co-ordinated response. The
Council supported the Commission’s ﬂexibility, which allows Member States to
provide exceptionally, and as a short-term measure, cover or pay the higher pre-
miums. This possibility has been extended on a monthly basis until the end of the
year;
•
The Commission presented a report on the impact on the tourism sector of
the September 11 terrorist attacks. If properly implemented, measures recently
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

foreseen in a Communication on ‘the Future of European Tourism’, should help
alleviate the impact of any long-term negative eﬀects;
•
A Regulation regarding the freezing of funds of terrorists organisations was
adopted in December 2001;
•
The Finance Council reached political agreement in May 2002 on the proposed
Directive to counter insider dealing and market manipulation.

Emergency preparedness
PUBLIC HEALTH
In the event of a terrorist attack the public health response is critical in identifying the
nature of the attack and the appropriate response. Civil protection measures must be in
place to deal with these needs.
Since September 11, the Commission has promoted discussions on preparedness for
bioterrorist threats. Health ministers have met several times to discuss EU-wide co-
ordination of eﬀorts. Each Member State has appointed a senior representative to
discuss these measures, forming a Health Security Committee. The EU already has a
communicable disease network, including a rapid alert system for any outbreak of
infectious diseases. Their work focuses on:
•
co-ordination of public health emergency planning and preparedness;
•
availability of the appropriate treatments.
EU-wide action adds value by:
•
drawing on all Member States’ expertise (epidemiologists, microbiologists, logistics,
IT, etc.) to assess what measures are needed;
•
reinforcing warning systems, rapid response capacities, analytic capacity and
surveillance;
•
developing clear, authoritative communication with the general public;
•
increasing training for the ﬁrst line of alert: GPs, vets and pharmacists;
•
planning for burden sharing of costly logistics like stockpiles and equipment;
•
co-ordinating international co-operation with partner countries and organisations
such as the WHO and the OECD.
At the international level, a concerted global action to strengthen the public health
response to the threat of international biological, chemical and radio-nuclear terrorism
was agreed in Ottawa in November 2001 by the G7 Health Ministers, together with
Mexico and EU Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner Byrne. The WHO is
a key partner in this eﬀort. Risk assessment and management methodologies are being
prepared within this framework and exercises are organised to test current response
plans
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
663
 

Health Ministers of EU Member States agreed in November 2001 a set of priorities
to establish a health expert consultation mechanism, strategies on availability and
stocks of serums vaccines and antibiotics and a European network of experts for
evaluating managing and communicating risks.
AVAILABILITY OF MEDICINAL TREATMENT
•
Biological agents have already been prioritised for the various interventions
required under the health system response plans being promoted by the health
security programme. An assessment of medicine production capacities and
national stockpiles has been carried out and advice issued by the European Medi-
cines Evaluation Agency on antibiotics and vaccines. For antibiotics, it is estimated
that production capabilities are suﬃcient to meet demands in the event of
an emergency. The matter of creating a EU stockpile of vaccines, anti-toxins and
anti-virals is under consideration;
•
A 25-point action programme was swiftly agreed by the Health Security Committee,
exchanging information rapidly and co-ordinating health responses in case of
emergency;
•
A major eﬀort has since been undertaken at EU level to enhance co-operation in
health security through the implementation of this programme with the help of a
14-member strong Task Force comprising experts nominated by EU Member
States. Work is in hand to ensure that laboratory expertise and capacity is made
available to cope with high-risk agents and complex technology and methods, as
well as a surge in demand for analyses in case of threats or attacks. Proper and safe
arrangements are being put in place for transportation of samples, reagents and
specimens and for ﬁeld investigation teams to analyse relationships between cases,
establish common environmental exposures and co-ordinate additional case ﬁnd-
ing. This is key to determining potentially exposed groups of people who would
require antibiotic prophylaxis, vaccination and/or monitoring depending on the
agent.
CIVIL PROTECTION
The EU wide Community Civil protection action aims at protecting European citizens
in case of a terrorist attack. The mechanism is intended to facilitate reinforced co-
operation on civil protection assistance interventions. It entered into force on 1 January
2002 and provides for immediate response and support in the event of major emergen-
cies. On-site intervention teams, experts and other equipment can be dispatched
promptly via its Monitoring and Information Centre. There is a comprehensive data-
base with relevant contact details for intervention teams in Member States. Emergency
response requests can be dispatched 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
RESEARCH
The Commission has put in place a group of experts appointed by EU Member States
to identify means of combating biological and chemical threats. The group has the the
mandate to draw up an inventory of current research activities in this ﬁeld; examine
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
664
 
www.ebook3000.com

how these activities can be best exploited and co-ordinated; and identify what gaps
there are and what additional research is needed in the short and long-term. Most of
the research needs identiﬁed by the Research Expert Group will be addressed within
the 6th EU Research Framework Programme (FP6).
As regards long term research needs, the development of fundamental knowledge
and basic tools should help develop, amongst others, new rapid diagnostics for identi-
fying potential biological and chemical agents, new vaccines against potential bio
agents and novel therapeutics. Short and medium-term research needs in support to
policy will be addressed under a speciﬁc action within FP6, namely the one concerning
issues related to civil protection (including bio-security and protection against risks
arising from terrorist attacks), and crisis management.
Two studies have been launched by the Commission: a prospective study on EU
vulnerable sides and weaknesses in front of potential bio-chemical terrorist attacks,
and a Pilot study on the relationship between scientiﬁc advice on bio-chemical terrorism
and society at large.
The ﬁrst study includes a number of scenarios describing ways in which terrorists
might try to achieve their possible objectives, such as to create panic, to inﬂict a large
number of casualties, or to bring about economic damage for instance in the agri-
cultural sector. These scenarios are evaluated in terms of their likelihood and resources
needed to put them in action. The study emphasises how scientiﬁc advances are chan-
ging the prospects, either by using novel bio-agents, or by using existing ones in new
ways, as well as how these advances make it possible to improve countermeasures. The
work is directed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and involves a
consortium of European research institutions. An advisory group of high level experts
in biological and chemical weapons provides additional input. The results will be
available late in the autumn of 2002.

7. Fight Against Terrorism: Council Framework Decision
2002/475/JHA on Combating Terrorism (13 June 2002)
1. Objective
The approximation of the laws of the Member States by establishing minimum rules
relating to the constituent elements and penalties in the ﬁeld of terrorist oﬀences.
2. Act
Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism
[Oﬃcial Journal L 164 of 22 June 2002].
3. Summary
The issue of terrorist oﬀences was raised at the Tampere European Council in 1999
and again at the Santa Maria da Feira European Council in June 2000. Terrorism is
one of the most serious violations of fundamental freedoms, human rights and of the
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
665
 

principles of liberty and democracy. Faced with this problem, the Member States must
take the necessary steps to bring about a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.
In recent years, a number of measures against terrorism have been introduced in
legislation adopted by the Member States, such as:
•
the Europol Convention supplemented by the Council decision of 3 December
1998;
•
Joint Action 96/610/JHA on the creation of a Directory of specialised counter-
terrorist skills;
•
Joint Action 98/428/JHA on the creation of a European Judicial Network;
•
Joint Action 98/733/JHA on making it a criminal oﬀence to participate in a crim-
inal organisation;
•
the Council recommendation on combating the ﬁnancing of terrorism.
The framework decision is applicable to any terrorist oﬀence:
•
committed or prepared with intent in a Member State;
•
which may seriously damage a country or an international organisation.
These oﬀences must be committed with the aim of intimidating people and seriously
altering or destroying the political, economic, or social structures of a country (mur-
der, bodily injuries, hostage taking, extortion, the fabrication of weapons, committing
attacks, threatening to commit any of the above, etc.). The above oﬀences may be
committed by one or more individuals against one or more countries.
This Framework Decision deﬁnes a terrorist group as a structured organisation con-
sisting of more than two persons, established over a period of time and acting in
concert. Moreover, instigating, aiding, abetting and attempting to commit terrorist
oﬀences will also be punishable.
To punish terrorist oﬀences, Member States must make provision in their national
legislation for:
•
eﬀective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties, which may entail
extradition;
•
mitigating circumstances (collaborating with the police and judicial authorities,
ﬁnding evidence or identifying the other oﬀenders).
In addition, penalties will be applied against legal persons where it is shown that the
natural person has a power to represent the legal person or authority to exercise
control within the legal person.
The Member States undertake to take the necessary action to:
•
establish their jurisdiction with regard to terrorist oﬀences;
•
establish their jurisdiction if they do not, under their own law, extradite their own
nationals;
•
coordinate their action and determine which of them is to prosecute the oﬀenders
with the aim of centralising proceedings in a single Member State where several
states are involved.

They will also take all measures possible to ensure appropriate assistance for victims
and their families (in addition to the measures already provided for in Framework
Decision 2001/220/JHA).
Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with this Framework
Decision. They shall then notify the General Secretariat of the Council and the Com-
mission thereof so that the Commission can prepare a report. The Council will assess
whether the Member States have adopted all the necessary measures to comply with
this Framework Decision; this must be done by 31 December 2003.
This Framework Decision applies to Gibraltar.

8. Council Decision Setting Up Eurojust with a View to
Reinforcing the Fight Against Serious Crime (28 February 2002)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 31 and
34(2)(c) thereof,
Having regard to the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and to that
of the Portuguese Republic, the French Republic, the Kingdom of Sweden and the
Kingdom of Belgium,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
1.
It is necessary to improve judicial cooperation between the Member States further,
in particular in combating forms of serious crime often perpetrated by transnational
organisations.
2.
The eﬀective improvement of judicial cooperation between the Member States
requires the immediate adoption of structural measures at European Union level
to facilitate the optimal coordination of action for investigations and prosecu-
tions covering the territory of more than one Member State with full respect for
fundamental rights and freedoms.
3.
In order to reinforce the ﬁght against serious organised crime, the Tampere
European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999, in particular in point 46 of its
conclusions, decided on the setting up of a unit (Eurojust) composed of prosecutors,
magistrates or police oﬃcers of equivalent competence.
4.
This Eurojust unit is set up by this Decision as a body of the European Union with
legal personality and ﬁnanced from the general budget of the European Union,

except as regards the salaries and emoluments of the national members and
assisting persons, which are borne by their Member State of origin.
5. The objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the
European Anti-Fraud Oﬃce (OLAF) are also relevant to Eurojust. The Eurojust
College should adopt the necessary implementing measures to achieve those object-
ives. It should take full account of the sensitive work carried out by Eurojust in the
context of investigations and prosecutions. In this connection, OLAF should be
denied access to documents, evidence, reports, notes or information, in whatever
form, which are held or created in the course of these activities, whether under way
or already concluded, and the transmission of such documents, evidence, reports,
notes and information to OLAF should be prohibited.
6. In order to be able to attain its objectives as eﬃciently as possible, Eurojust should
fulﬁl its tasks either through one or more of its national members or acting as a
College.
7. The competent authorities of the Member States should be able to exchange
information with Eurojust in accordance with arrangements which serve and
observe the interests of public service.
8. Eurojust’s jurisdiction is without prejudice to the Community’s competence to
protect its own ﬁnancial interests and is also without prejudice to existing conven-
tions and agreements, in particular the European Convention on Mutual Assist-
ance in Criminal Matters (Council of Europe) signed in Strasbourg on 20 April
1959, and also the Convention on Mutual Assistance on Criminal Matters between
the Member States of the European Union adopted by the Council on 29 May
2000, and the Protocol thereto adopted on 16 October 2001.
9. In order to achieve its objectives, Eurojust processes personal data by automated
means or in structured manual ﬁles. Accordingly, the necessary steps should be
taken to guarantee a level of data protection which corresponds at least to that
which results from the application of the principles of the Convention for the
Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data
(Council of Europe) signed in Strasbourg on 28 January 1981, together with
subsequent amendments thereto, in particular the Protocol opened for signature
on 8 November 2001, once such amendments are in force between the Member
States.
10. In order to help ensure and check that personal data are processed properly by
Eurojust, a joint supervisory body should be set up which, given the composition
of Eurojust, should consist of a panel of judges or, if the constitutional or national
system of a Member State so requires, of persons exercising an equivalent function
which gives them suﬃcient independence. The powers of this joint supervisory
body should be without prejudice to the jurisdiction of national courts or to the
arrangements for any appeals which may be brought before them.
11. In order to ensure harmonious coordination of the various activities pursued by
the Union and the Community and having regard to Article 29 and Article 36(2) of
the Treaty, the Commission should be fully involved in Eurojust’s proceedings
concerning general questions and questions coming within its competence. Euro-
just’s rules of procedure should detail the arrangements for the Commission to
participate in Eurojust’s proceedings in areas within its jurisdiction.

12. Provisions should be laid down to ensure that Eurojust and the European Police
Oﬃce (Europol) establish and maintain close cooperation.
13. Eurojust and the European Judicial Network set up by Joint Action 98/428/JHA
should have a privileged relationship. To that end, the secretariat of the Network
should be placed within the Eurojust secretariat.
14. In order to facilitate activities of Eurojust, the Member States should put in place
or designate one or more national correspondents.
15. Insofar as is necessary for the fulﬁlment of its tasks, it should be possible for
Eurojust to initiate cooperation with non-Member States and for agreements to be
concluded to that eﬀect, primarily with the candidate countries for accession to the
Union and other countries with which arrangements have been agreed.
16. Since the adoption of this Decision means that major new legislative measures
must be approved in the Member States, provision should be made for certain
transitional provisions.
17. Point 57 of the Laeken European Council conclusions of 14 and 15 December 2001
provided for Eurojust to be able to begin operations in The Hague, pending overall
agreement on the seats of certain agencies.
18. This Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recog-
nised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty and reﬂected in the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1

a Member State’s competent authority or of the Commission, Eurojust may also
assist investigations and prosecutions concerning only that Member State and the
Community.

personal data at least equivalent to that resulting from the application of the prin-
ciples of the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 and subsequent
amendments thereto where they are in force in the Member States.
3.
Personal data processed by Eurojust shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive
in relation to the purpose of the processing, and, taking into account the informa-
tion provided by the competent authorities of the Member States or other partners
in accordance with Articles 13 and 26, accurate and up-to-date. Personal data

Such data may not be processed in the index referred to in Article 16(1).
Where such other data refer to witnesses or victims within the meaning of para-
graph 2, the decision to process them shall be taken by the College.
Article 16
Index and temporary work ﬁles

Article 20, may make a request to that eﬀect free of charge in the Member State of
his choice, to the authority appointed for that purpose in that Member State, and
that authority shall refer it to Eurojust without delay.
3.
The right of any individual to have access to personal data concerning him or to
have them checked shall be exercised in accordance with the laws and procedures
of the Member State in which the individual has made his request. If, however,
Eurojust can ascertain which authority in a State transmitted the data in question,
that authority may require that the right of access be exercised in accordance with
the rules of the law of that Member State.
4.
Access to personal data shall be denied if:
(a) such access may jeopardise one of Eurojust’s activities;

Eurojust shall establish and maintain close cooperation with OLAF. To that end,
OLAF may contribute to Eurojust’s work to coordinate investigations and pros-
ecution procedures regarding the protection of the ﬁnancial interests of the
Communities, either on the initiative of Eurojust or at the request of OLAF where
the competent national authorities concerned do not oppose such participation.

For purposes of the receipt and transmission of information between Eurojust and
OLAF, and without prejudice to Article 9, Member States shall ensure that the

the information shall give his consent to the transfer of that information. In
appropriate cases the national member shall consult the competent authorities of
the Member States.

to in paragraph 1(b) and (c) without concluding an agreement with them provided
that such cooperation does not involve the transmission of personal data to them
by Eurojust.
4.
Without prejudice to paragraph 3, the transmission of personal data by Eurojust to
the entities referred to in paragraph 1(b) and to the authorities referred to in
paragraph 1(c) of third States which are not subject to the Council of Europe
Convention of 28 January 1981 may be eﬀected only when an adequate level of
data protection is ensured.

States or entities referred to in paragraph 1(b) and (c) to meet the conditions
referred to in paragraph 4 shall immediately be communicated by Eurojust to the
Joint Supervisory Body and the Member States concerned. The Joint Supervisory
Body may prevent the further exchange of personal data with the relevant entities
until it is satisﬁed that adequate remedies have been provided.
6.
However, even if the conditions referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 are not ful-
ﬁlled, a national member may, acting in his national capacity, by way of excep-
tion and with the sole aim of taking urgent measures to counter imminent
serious danger threatening a person or public security, carry out an exchange of
information involving personal data. The national member shall be responsible
for the legality of authorising the communication. The national member shall
keep a record of communications of data and of the grounds for such communi-
cations. The communication of data shall be authorised only if the recipient
gives an undertaking that the data will be used only for the purpose for which it
was communicated.

On 19 October 2001 the European Council stated that it is determined to combat
terrorism in every form throughout the world and that it will continue its eﬀorts to
strengthen the coalition of the international community to combat terrorism
in every shape and form, for example by increased cooperation between the
operational services responsible for combating terrorism: Europol, Eurojust, the
intelligence services, police forces and judicial authorities.
5.
Article 4 of Council Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001 on
the application of speciﬁc measures to combat terrorism provides that Member
States shall, through police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, within the
framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, aﬀord each other the
widest possible assistance in preventing and combating terrorist acts. Such assist-
ance shall be based on and fully exploit the existing powers of the Member States in
accordance with acts of the European Union and other international agreements,
arrangements and conventions which are binding upon Member States. Assistance
will be provided in conformity with the national laws of the Member States, in
particular those with regard to conﬁdentiality of criminal investigations.
6.
Common Position 2001/931/CFSP and the additional measures contemplated in
this Decision concern particular persons, groups and entities listed in the Annex to
that Common Position, which is regularly being updated.
7.
Whilst Common Position 2001/931/CFSP sets out certain guarantees to ensure that
persons, groups and entities are listed only if there is suﬃcient cause to do so, the
Council shall draw the necessary consequences from any ﬁnal ﬁnding and enforce-
able interim orders to the contrary by a court of the Member States.
8.
This Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recog-
nised by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. Nothing in this Decision may
be interpreted as allowing infringement of the legal protection aﬀorded under
national law to the persons, groups and entities listed in the Annex to Common
Position 2001/931/CFSP,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
For the purposes of this Decision:
(a) ‘the listed persons, groups or entities’ means the persons, groups or entities listed in
the Annex to Common Position 2001/931/CFSP;

Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism;
(c) ‘Europol Convention’ means the Convention of 26 July 1995 on the establishment

10. Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 of 27 May 2002
imposing certain speciﬁc restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities
associated with Usama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network and the Taliban, and repealing
Council Regulation (EC) No 467/2001 prohibiting the export of certain goods and ser-
vices to Afghanistan, strengthening the ﬂight ban and extending the freeze of funds and
other ﬁnancial resources in respect of the Taliban of Afghanistan
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular
Articles 60, 301 and 308 thereof,

Having regard to Common Position 2002/402/CFSP concerning restrictive measures
against Usama bin Laden, members of the Al-Qaida organisation and the Taliban and
other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with them and repealing
Common Positions 96/746/CFSP, 1999/727/CFSP, 2001/154/CFSP and 2001/771/
CFSP,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
1. On 16 January 2002, the Security Council of the United Nations adopted Reso-
lution 1390(2002) determining that the Taliban had failed to respond to its
demands made in a number of previous resolutions and condemning the Taliban
for allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for terrorist training and activities
and also condemning the Al-Qaida network and other associated terrorist groups
for their terrorist acts and destruction of property.
2. The Security Council decided, inter alia, that the ﬂight ban and certain export
restrictions imposed on Afghanistan further to its Resolutions 1267(1999) and
1333(2000) should be repealed and that the scope of the freezing of funds and the
prohibition on funds being made available, which were imposed further to these
Resolutions, should be adjusted. It also decided that a prohibition on providing
the Taliban and the Al-Qaida organisation with certain services related to military
activities should be applied. In accordance with paragraph 3 of Resolution
1390(2002), those measures will be reviewed by the Security Council 12 months
after adoption of the resolution and at the end of this period the Security Council
will either allow the measures to continue or decide to improve them.
3. In this regard, the Security Council recalled the obligation to implement in full its
Resolution 1373(2001) with regard to any member of the Taliban and the Al-Qaida
organisation, but also with regard to those who are associated with them and have
participated in the ﬁnancing, planning, facilitation, preparation or perpetration of
terrorist acts.
4. These measures fall under the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, notably with a
view to avoiding distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to
implement the relevant decisions of the Security Council as far as the territory of
the Community is concerned. For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory
of the Community is deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to
which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty.
5. In order to create maximum legal certainty within the Community, the names and
other relevant data with regard to natural or legal persons, groups or entities whose
funds should be frozen further to a designation by the UN authorities, should
be made publicly known and a procedure should be established within the
Community to amend these lists.
6. The competent authorities of the Member States should, where necessary, be
empowered to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation.
7. UN Security Council Resolution 1267(1999) provides that the relevant UN Sanc-
tions Committee may grant exemptions from the freezing of funds on grounds
of humanitarian need. Therefore, provision needs to be made to render such
exemptions applicable throughout the Community.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
693
 

8. For reasons of expediency, the Commission should be empowered to amend the
Annexes to this Regulation on the basis of pertinent notiﬁcation or information by
the UN Security Council, the relevant UN Sanctions Committee and Member
States, as appropriate.
9. The Commission and Member States should inform each other of the measures
taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in
connection with this Regulation, and cooperate with the relevant UN Sanctions
Committee, in particular by supplying it with information.
10. Member States should lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of
the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those
sanctions must be eﬀective, proportionate and dissuasive.
11. Taking into account that the freezing of funds is to be adjusted, it is necessary to
ensure that sanctions for breaches of this Regulation can be imposed as of the date
of entry into force of this Regulation.
12. In view of the measures imposed under Resolution 1390(2002) it is necessary to
adjust the measures imposed in the Community by repealing Council Regulation
(EC) No 467/2001(4) and adopting a new Regulation,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
For the purpose of this Regulation, the following deﬁnitions shall apply:

2.
‘economic resources’ means assets of every kind, whether tangible or intangible,

3.

THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES to the present Convention, Member States
of the European Union,
REFERRING to the Council act of the twenty-sixth day of July in the year one
thousand nine hundred and ninety-ﬁve;
AWARE of the urgent problems arising from terrorism, unlawful drug traﬃcking
and other serious forms of international crime;
WHEREAS there is a need for progress in solidarity and co-operation between the
Member States of the European Union, particularly through an improvement in police
cooperation between the Member States;
WHEREAS such progress should enable the protection of security and public order
to be further improved;
WHEREAS the establishment of a European Police Oﬃce (Europol) was agreed in
the Treaty on European Union of 7 February 1992;
IN VIEW of the decision of the European Council of 29 October 1993 that Europol
should be established in the Netherlands and have its seat in The Hague;
MINDFUL of the common objective of improving police cooperation in the ﬁeld of
terrorism, unlawful drug traﬃcking and other serious forms of international crime
through a constant, conﬁdential and intensive exchange of information between
Europol and Member States’ national units;
ON THE UNDERSTANDING that the forms of cooperation laid down in this
Convention should not aﬀect other forms of bilateral or multilateral co-operation;
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N

CONVINCED that in the ﬁeld of police co-operation, particular attention must be
paid to the protection of the rights of individuals, and in particular to the protection
of their personal data;
WHEREAS the activities of Europol under this Convention are without prejudice
to the powers of the European Communities; whereas Europol and the Communities
have a mutual interest, in the framework of the European Union, in establishing types
of co-operation enabling each of them to perform their respective tasks as eﬀectively
as possible,
HAVE AGREED as follows:
Title I: Establishment and tasks
Article 1
Establishment
1.
The Member States of the European Union, hereinafter referred to as ‘Member
States’, hereby establish a European Police Oﬃce, hereinafter referred to as
‘Europol’.
2.
Europol shall liaise with a single national unit in each Member State, to be estab-
lished or designated in accordance with Article 4.
Article 2
Objective
1.
The objective of Europol shall be, within the framework of co-operation between
the Member States pursuant to Article K.1(9) of the Treaty on European Union, to
improve, by means of the measures referred to in this Convention, the eﬀectiveness
and co-operation of the competent authorities in the Member States in preventing
and combating terrorism, unlawful drug traﬃcking and other serious forms of
international crime where there are factual indications that an organized criminal
structure is involved and two or more Member States are aﬀected by the forms of
crime in question in such a way as to require a common approach by the Member
States owing to the scale, signiﬁcance and consequences of the oﬀences concerned.
2.
In order to achieve progressively the objective mentioned in paragraph 1, Europol
shall initially act to prevent and combat unlawful drug traﬃcking, traﬃcking in
nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, trade in human
beings and motor vehicle crime.
Within two years at the latest following the entry into force of this Convention,
Europol shall also deal with crimes committed or likely to be committed in the
course of terrorist activities against life, limb, personal freedom or property. The
Council, acting unanimously in accordance with the procedure laid down in Title
VI of the Treaty on European Union, may decide to instruct Europol to deal with
such terrorist activities before that period has expired.
The Council, acting unanimously in accordance with the procedure laid down in
Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, may decide to instruct Europol to deal
with other forms of crime listed in the Annex to this Convention or speciﬁc mani-
festations thereof. Before acting, the Council shall instruct the Management Board

to prepare its decision and in particular to set out the budgetary and staﬃng
implications for Europol.
3.
Europol’s competence as regards a form of crime or speciﬁc manifestations thereof
shall cover both:
(1) illegal money-laundering activities in connection with these forms of crime or
speciﬁc manifestations thereof;
(2) related criminal oﬀences.
The following shall be regarded as related and shall be taken into account in
accordance with the procedures set out in Articles 8 and 10:
•
criminal oﬀences committed in order to procure the means for perpetrating
acts within the sphere of competence of Europol;
•
criminal oﬀences committed in order to facilitate or carry out acts within the
sphere of competence of Europol;
•
criminal oﬀences committed to ensure the impunity of acts within the sphere
of competence of Europol.
4.
For the purposes of this Convention, ‘competent authorities’ means all public
bodies existing in the Member States which are responsible under national law for
preventing and combating criminal oﬀences.
5.
For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, ‘unlawful drug traﬃcking’ means the
criminal oﬀences listed in Article 3(1) of the United Nations Convention of
20 December 1988 against Illicit Traﬃc in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances and in the provisions amending or replacing that Convention.

2.
The computerized system of collected information operated by Europol must
under no circumstances be linked to other automated processing systems, except
for the automated processing systems of the national units.
Title II: Information system
Article 7
Establishment of the information system
1.
In order to perform its tasks, Europol shall establish and maintain a computerized
information system. The information system, into which Member States, repre-
sented by their national units and liaison oﬃcers, may directly input data in com-
pliance with their national procedures, and into which Europol may directly input
data supplied by third States and third bodies and analysis data, shall be directly
accessible for consultation by national units, liaison oﬃcers, the Director, the
Deputy Directors and duly empowered Europol oﬃcials.
Direct access by the national units to the information system in respect of the
persons referred to in Article 8(1), point 2 shall be restricted solely to the details of
identity listed in Article 8(2). If needed for a speciﬁc enquiry, the full range of data
shall be accessible to them via the liaison oﬃcers.
2.
Europol shall:
(1) have the task of ensuring compliance with the provisions governing cooper-
ation on and operation of the information system, and
(2) be responsible for the proper working of the information system in technical
and operational respects. Europol shall in particular take all necessary meas-
ures to ensure that the measures referred to in Articles 21 and 25 regarding the
information system are properly implemented.
3.
The national unit in each Member State shall be responsible for communication
with the information system. It shall, in particular, be responsible for the security
measures referred to in Article 25 in respect of the data-processing equipment used
within the territory of the Member State in question, for the review in accordance
with Article 21 and, insofar as required under the laws, regulations, administrative
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

provisions and procedures of that Member State, for the proper implementation of
this Convention in other respects.
Article 8
Content of the information system
1.
The information system may be used to store, modify and utilize only the data
necessary for the performance of Europol’s tasks, with the exception of data
concerning related criminal oﬀences as referred to in the second subparagraph of
Article 2(3). Data entered shall relate to:
(1) persons who, in accordance with the national law of the Member State con-
cerned, are suspected of having committed or having taken part in a criminal
oﬀence for which Europol is competent under Article 2 or who have been
convicted of such an oﬀence;
(2) persons who there are serious grounds under national law for believing will
commit criminal oﬀences for which Europol is competent under Article 2.
2.
Personal data as referred to in paragraph 1 may include only the following details:
(1) surname, maiden name, given names and any alias or assumed name;
(2) date and place of birth;
(3) nationality;
(4) sex; and
(5) where necessary, other characteristics likely to assist in identiﬁcation, including
any speciﬁc objective physical characteristics not subject to change.
3.
In addition to the data referred to in paragraph 2 and data on Europol or the
inputting national unit, the information system may also be used to store, modify
and utilize the following details concerning the persons referred to in paragraph 1:
(1) criminal oﬀences, alleged crimes and when and where they were committed;
(2) means which were or may be used to commit the crimes;
(3) departments handling the case and their ﬁling references;
(4) suspected membership of a criminal organization;
(5) convictions, where they relate to criminal oﬀences for which Europol is
competent under Article 2.
These data may also be input when they do not yet contain any references to
persons. Where Europol inputs the data itself, as well as giving its ﬁling reference it
shall also indicate whether the data were provided by a third party or are the result
of its own analyses.
4.
Additional information held by Europol or national units concerning the groups of
persons referred to in paragraph 1 may be communicated to any national unit or
Europol should either so request. National units shall do so in compliance with
their national law.
Where the additional information concerns one or more related criminal
oﬀences as deﬁned in the second subparagraph of Article 2(3), the data stored in
the information system shall be marked accordingly to enable national units and
Europol to exchange information on the related criminal oﬀences.

5.
If proceedings against the person concerned are dropped or if that person is
acquitted, the data relating to either decision shall be deleted.
Article 9
Right of access to the information system
1.
Only national units, liaison oﬃcers, and the Director, Deputy Directors or duly
empowered Europol oﬃcials shall have the right to input data directly into the
information system and retrieve it therefrom. Data may be retrieved where this is
necessary for the performance of Europol’s tasks in a particular case; retrieval shall
be eﬀected in accordance with the laws, regulations, administrative provisions and
procedures of the retrieving unit, subject to any additional provisions contained in
this Convention.
2.
Only the unit which entered the data may modify, correct or delete such data.
Where a unit has reason to believe that data as referred to in Article 8(2) are
incorrect or wishes to supplement them, it shall immediately inform the inputting
unit; the latter shall examine such notiﬁcation without delay and if necessary mod-
ify, supplement, correct or delete the data immediately. Where the system contains
data as referred to in Article 8(3) concerning a person any unit may enter add-
itional data as referred to in Article 8(3). Where there is an obvious contradiction
between the data input, the units concerned shall consult each other and reach
agreement. Where a unit intends to delete altogether data as referred to in Article
8(2) which is has input on a person and where data as referred to in Article 8(3) are
held on the same person but input by other units, responsibility in terms of data
protection legislation pursuant to Article 15(1) and the right to modify, supple-
ment, correct and delete such data pursuant to Article 8(2) shall be transferred to
the next unit to have entered data as referred to in Article 8(3) on that person. The
unit intending to delete shall inform the unit to which responsibility in terms of
data protection is transferred of its intention.
3.
Responsibility for the permissibility of retrieval from, input into and modiﬁcations
within the information system shall lie with the retrieving, inputting or modifying
unit; it must be possible to identify that unit. The communication of information
between national units and the competent authorities in the Member States shall be
governed by national law.
Title III: Work ﬁles for the purposes of analysis
Article 10
Collection, processing and utilization of personal data
1.
Where this is necessary to achieve the objective laid down in Article 2(1), Europol,
in addition to data of a non-personal nature, may store, modify, and utilize in other
ﬁles data on criminal oﬀences for which Europol is competent under Article 2(2),
including data on the related criminal oﬀences provided for in the second subpara-
graph of Article 2(3) which are intended for speciﬁc analyses, and concerning:
(1) persons as referred to in Article 8(1);
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
716
 
www.ebook3000.com

(2) persons who might be called on to testify in investigations in connection with
the oﬀences under consideration or in subsequent criminal proceedings;
(3) persons who have been the victims of one of the oﬀences under consideration
or with regard to whom certain facts give reason for believing that they could
be the victims of such an oﬀence;
(4) contacts and associates, and
(5) persons who can provide information on the criminal oﬀences under
consideration.
The collection, storage and processing of the data listed in the ﬁrst sentence of
Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 with regard to
Automatic Processing of Personal Data shall not be permitted unless strictly neces-
sary for the purposes of the ﬁle concerned and unless such data supplement other
personal data already entered in that ﬁle. It shall be prohibited to select a particular
group of persons solely on the basis of the data listed in the ﬁrst sentence of
Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 in breach of the
aforementioned rules with regard to purpose.
The Council, acting unanimously, in accordance with the procedure laid down in
Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, shall adopt implementing rules for data
ﬁles prepared by the Management Board containing additional details, in particu-
lar with regard to the categories of personal data referred to in this Article and
the provisions concerning the security of the data concerned and the internal
supervision of their use.
2.
Such ﬁles shall be opened for the purposes of analysis deﬁned as the assembly,
processing or utilization of data with the aim of helping a criminal investigation.
Each analysis project shall entail the establishment of an analysis group closely
associating the following participants in accordance with the tasks deﬁned in
Article 3(1) and (2) and Article 5(3):
(1) analysts and other Europol oﬃcials designated by the Europol Directorate:
only analysts shall be authorized to enter data into and retrieve data from the
ﬁle concerned;
(2) the liaison oﬃcers and/or experts of the Member States supplying the informa-
tion or concerned by the analysis within the meaning of paragraph 6.
3.
At the request of Europol or on their own initiative, national units shall, subject to
Article 4(5), communicate to Europol all the information which it may require for
the performance of its tasks under Article 3(1), point 2. The Member States shall
communicate such data only where processing thereof for the purposes of prevent-
ing, analyzing or combating oﬀences is also authorized by their national law.
Depending on their degree of sensitivity, data from national units may be routed
directly and by whatever means may be appropriate to the analysis groups, whether
via the liaison oﬃcers concerned or not.
4.
If, in addition to the data referred to in paragraph 3, it would seem justiﬁed for
Europol to have other information for the performance of tasks under Article 3(1),
point 2, Europol may request that:
(1) the European Communities and bodies governed by public law established
under the Treaties establishing those Communities;
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
717
 

(2) other bodies governed by public law established in the framework of the
European Union;
(3) bodies which are based on an agreement between two or more Member States
of the European Union;
(4) third States;
(5) international organizations and their subordinate bodies governed by public
law;
(6) other bodies governed by public law which are based on an agreement between
two or more States; and
(7) the International Criminal Police Organization,
forward the relevant information to it by whatever means may be appropriate. It
may also, under the same conditions and by the same means, accept information
provided by those various bodies on their own initiative. The Council, acting
unanimously in accordance with the procedure laid down in Title VI of the Treaty
on European Union and after consulting the Management Board, shall draw up
the rules to be observed by Europol in this respect.
5.
Insofar as Europol is entitled under other Conventions to gain computerized access
to data from other information systems, Europol may retrieve personal data by
such means if this is necessary for the performance of its tasks pursuant to Article
3(1), point 2.
6.
If an analysis is of a general nature and of a strategic type, all Member States,
through liaison oﬃcers and/or experts, shall be fully associated in the ﬁndings
thereof, in particular through the communication of reports drawn up by
Europol.
If the analysis bears on speciﬁc cases not concerning all Member States and has
a direct operational aim, representatives of the following Member States shall
participate therein:
(1) Member States which were the source of the information giving rise to the
decision to open the analysis ﬁle, or those which are directly concerned by that
information and Member States subsequently invited by the analysis group to
take part in the analysis because they are also becoming concerned;
(2) Member States which learn from consulting the index system that they need to
be informed and assert that need to know under the conditions laid down in
paragraph 7.
7.
The need to be informed may be claimed by authorized liaison oﬃcers. Each
Member State shall nominate and authorize a limited number of such liaison
oﬃcers. It shall forward the list thereof to the Management Board.
A liaison oﬃcer shall claim the need to be informed as deﬁned in paragraph 6 by
means of a written reasoned statement approved by the authority to which he
is subordinate in his Member State and forwarded to all the participants in the
analysis. He shall then be automatically associated in the analysis in progress.
If an objection is raised in the analysis group, automatic association shall be
deferred until completion of a conciliation procedure, which may comprise three
stages as follows:
(1) the participants in the analysis shall endeavour to reach agreement with the
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
718
 
www.ebook3000.com

liaison oﬃcer claiming the need to be informed; they shall have no more than
eight days for that purpose;
(2) if no agreement is reached, the heads of the national units concerned and the
Directorate of Europol shall meet within three days;
(3) if the disagreement persists, the representatives of the parties concerned on the
Management Board shall meet within eight days. If the Member State con-
cerned does not waive its need to be informed, automatic association of that
Member State shall be decided by consensus.
8.
The Member State communicating an item of data to Europol shall be the sole
judge of the degree of its sensitivity and variations thereof. Any dissemination or
operational use of analysis data shall be decided on in consultation with the parti-
cipants in the analysis. A Member State joining an analysis in progress may not, in
particular, disseminate or use the data without the prior agreement of the Member
States initially concerned.
Article 11
Index system
1.
An index system shall be created by Europol for the data stored on the ﬁles referred
to in Article 10(1).
2.
The Director, Deputy Directors and duly empowered oﬃcials of Europol and
liaison oﬃcers shall have the right to consult the index system. The index system
shall be such that it is clear to the liaison oﬃcer consulting it, from the data being
consulted, that the ﬁles referred to in Article 6(1), point 2 and Article 10(1) contain
data concerning the seconding Member State.
Access by liaison oﬃcers shall be deﬁned in such a way that it is possible to
determine whether or not an item of information is stored, but that it is not pos-
sible to establish connections or further conclusions regarding the content of the
ﬁles.
3.
The detailed procedures for the design of the index system shall be deﬁned by the
Management Board acting unanimously.
Article 12
Order opening a data ﬁle
1.
For every computerized data ﬁle containing personal data operated by Europol for
the purpose of performing its tasks referred to in Article 10, Europol shall specify
in an order opening the ﬁle, which shall require the approval of the Management
Board:
(1) the ﬁle name;
(2) the purpose of the ﬁle;
(3) the groups of persons on whom data are stored;
(4) the nature of the data to be stored, and any of the data listed in the ﬁrst
sentence of Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981
which are strictly necessary;
(5) the type of personal data used to open the ﬁle;
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
719
 

(6) the supply or input of the data to be stored;
(7) the conditions under which the personal data stored in the ﬁle may be com-
municated, to which recipients and under what procedure;
(8) the time-limits for examination and duration of storage;
(9) the method of establishing the audit log.
The joint supervisory body provided for in Article 24 shall immediately be advised
by the Director of Europol of the plan to order the opening of such a data ﬁle and
shall receive the dossier so that it may address any comments it deems necessary to
the Management Board.
2.
If the urgency of the matter is such as to preclude obtaining the approval of the
Management Board as required under paragraph 1, the Director, on his own
initiative or at the request of the Member States concerned, may by a reasoned
decision, order the opening of a data ﬁle. At the same time he shall inform the
members of the Management Board of his decision. The procedure pursuant to
paragraph 1 shall then be set in motion without delay and completed as soon as

and of Recommendation No R(87) 15 of the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe of 17 September 1987.
Europol shall also observe these principles in respect of non-automated data held
in the form of data ﬁles, i.e. any structured set of personal data accessible in
accordance with speciﬁc criteria.
Article 15
Responsibility in data protection matters
1.
Subject to other provisions in this Convention, the responsibility for data stored at
Europol, in particular as regards the legality of the collection, the transmission to
Europol and the input of data, as well as their accuracy, their up-to-date nature
and veriﬁcation of the storage time-limits, shall lie with:
(1) the Member State which input or otherwise communicated the data;
(2) Europol in respect of data communicated to Europol by third parties or which
result from analyses conducted by Europol.
2.
In addition, subject to other provisions in this Convention, Europol shall be
responsible for all data received by Europol and processed by it, whether such data
be in the information system referred to in Article 8, in the data ﬁles opened for the
purposes of analysis referred to in Article 10, or in the index system referred to in
Article 11, or in the data ﬁles referred to in Article 14(3).
3.
Europol shall store data in such a way that it can be established by which Member
State or third party the data were transmitted or whether they are the result of an
analysis by Europol.
Article 16
Provisions on the drawing up of reports
On average, Europol shall draw up reports for at least one in ten retrievals of personal
data—and for each retrieval made within the information system referred to in Article
7—in order to check whether they are permissible under law. The data contained in the
reports shall only be used for that purpose by Europol and the supervisory bodies
referred to in Articles 23 and 24 and shall be deleted after six months, unless the data
are further required for ongoing control. The details shall be decided upon by the
Management Board following consultation with the joint supervisory body.
Article 17
Rules on the use of data
1.
Personal data retrieved from the information system, the index system or data ﬁles
opened for the purposes of analysis and data communicated by any other appropri-
ate means, may be transmitted or utilized only by the competent authorities of the
Member States in order to prevent and combat crimes falling within the com-
petence of Europol and to combat other serious forms of crime.
The data referred to in the ﬁrst paragraph shall be utilized in compliance with the
law of the Member State responsible for the authorities which utilized the data.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
721
 

Europol may utilize the data referred to in paragraph 1 only for the performance
of its tasks as referred to in Article 3.
2.
If, in the case of certain data, the communicating Member State or the communi-
cating third State or third body as referred to in Article 10(4) stipulates particular
restrictions on use to which such data is subject in that Member State or by third
parties, such restrictions shall also be complied with by the user of the data except
in the speciﬁc case where national law lays down that the restrictions on use be
waived for judicial authorities, legislative bodies or any other independent body set
up under the law and made responsible for supervising the national competent
authorities within the meaning of Article 2(4). In such cases, the data may only be
used after prior consultation of the communicating Member State whose interests
and opinions must be taken into account as far as possible.
3.
Use of the data for other purposes or by authorities other than those referred to
in Article 2 of this Convention shall be possible only after prior consultation of
the Member State which transmitted the data insofar as the national law of that
Member State permits.
Article 18
Communication of data to third states and third bodies
1.
Europol may under the conditions laid down in paragraph 4 communicate personal
data which it holds to third states and third bodies within the meaning of Article
10(4), where:
(1) this is necessary in individual cases for the purposes of preventing or combat-
ing criminal oﬀences for which Europol is competent under Article 2;
(2) an adequate level of data protection is ensured in that State or that body; and
(3) this is permissible under the general rules within the meaning of paragraph 2.
2.
In accordance with the procedure in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union,
and taking into account the circumstances referred to in paragraph 3, the Council,
acting unanimously, shall determine the general rules for the communication of
personal data by Europol to the third States and third bodies within the meaning
of Article 10(4). The Management Board shall prepare the Council decision and
consult the joint supervisory body referred to in Article 24.
3.
The adequacy of the level of data protection aﬀorded by third States and third
bodies within the meaning of Article 10(4) shall be assessed taking into account all
the circumstances which play a part in the communication of personal data; in
particular, the following shall be taken into account:
(1) the nature of the data;
(2) the purpose for which the data is intended;
(3) the duration of the intended processing; and
(4) the general or speciﬁc provisions applying to the third States and third bodies
within the meaning of Article 10(4).
4.
If the data referred to have been communicated to Europol by a Member State,
Europol may communicate them to third States and third bodies only with the
Member State’s consent. The Member State may give its prior consent, in general
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
722
 
www.ebook3000.com

or other terms, to such communication; that consent may be withdrawn at any
time.
If the data have not been communicated by a Member State, Europol shall
satisfy itself that communication of those data is not liable to:
(1) obstruct the proper performance of the tasks falling within a Member State’s
sphere of competence;
(2) jeopardize the security and public order of a Member State or otherwise
prejudice its general welfare.
5.
Europol shall be responsible for the legality of the authorizing communication.
Europol shall keep a record of communications of data and of the grounds for
such communications. The communication of data shall be authorized only if the
recipient gives an undertaking that the data will be used only for the purpose for
which it was communicated. This shall not apply to the communication of personal
data required for a Europol inquiry.
6.
Where the communication provided for in paragraph 1 concerns information sub-
ject to the requirement of conﬁdentiality, it shall be permissible only insofar as an
agreement on conﬁdentiality exists between Europol and the recipient.
Article 19
Right of access
1.
Any individual wishing to exercise his right of access to data relating to him which
have been stored within Europol or to have such data checked may make a request
to that eﬀect free of charge to the national competent authority in any Member
State he wishes, and that authority shall refer it to Europol without delay and
inform the enquirer that Europol will reply to him directly.
2.
The request must be fully dealt with by Europol within three months following its
receipt by the national competent authority of the Member State concerned.
3.
The right of any individual to have access to data relating to him or to have such
data checked shall be exercised in accordance with the law of the Member State
where the right is claimed, taking into account the following provisions:
Where the law of the Member State applied to provides for a communication
concerning data, such communication shall be refused if such refusal is necessary to:
(1) enable Europol to fulﬁl its duties properly;
(2) protect security and public order in the Member States or to prevent crime;
(3) protect the rights and freedoms of third parties,
considerations which it follows cannot be overridden by the interests of the person
concerned by the communication of the information.
4.
The right to communication of information in accordance with paragraph 3 shall
be exercised according to the following procedures:
(1) as regards data entered within the information system deﬁned in Article 8, a
decision to communicate such data cannot be taken unless the Member State
which entered the data and the Member States directly concerned by
communication of such data have ﬁrst had the opportunity of stating
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
723
 

their position, which may extend to a refusal to communicate the data. The
data which may be communicated and the arrangements for communicating
such data shall be indicated by the Member State which entered the data;
(2) as regards data entered within the information system by Europol, the Member
States directly concerned by communication of such data must ﬁrst have had
the opportunity of stating their position, which may extend to a refusal to
communicate the data;
(3) as regards data entered within the work ﬁles for the purposes of analysis as
deﬁned in Article 10, the communication of such data shall be conditional
upon the consensus of Europol and the Member States participating in
the analysis, within the meaning of Article 10(2), and the consensus of the
Member State(s) directly concerned by the communication of such data.
Should one or more Member State or Europol have objected to a communication
concerning data, Europol shall notify the person concerned that it has carried out
the checks, without giving any information which might reveal to him whether or
not he is known.
5.
The right to the checking of information shall be exercised in accordance with the
following procedures:
Where the national law applicable makes no provision for a communication
concerning data or in the case of a simple request for a check, Europol, in close
cooperation with the national authorities concerned, shall carry out the checks and
notify the enquirer that it has done so without giving any information which might
reveal to him whether or not he is known.
6.
In its reply to a request for a check or for access to data, Europol shall inform the
enquirer that he may appeal to the joint supervisory body if he is not satisﬁed with
the decision. The latter may also refer the matter to the joint supervisory body if
there has been no response to his request within the time-limits laid down in this
Article.
7.
If the enquirer lodges an appeal to the joint supervisory body provided for in
Article 24, the appeal shall be examined by that body.
Where the appeal relates to a communication concerning data entered by a
Member State in the information system, the joint supervisory body shall take its
decision in accordance with the national law of the Member State in which the
application was made. The joint supervisory body shall ﬁrst consult the national
supervisory body or the competent judicial body in the Member State which was
the source of the data. Either national body shall make the necessary checks, in
particular to establish whether the decision to refuse was taken in accordance with
paragraphs 3 and 4(1) of this Article. On conﬁrmation of that, the decision, which
may extend to a refusal to communicate any information, shall be taken by the joint
supervisory body in close cooperation with the national supervisory body or
competent judicial body.
Where the appeal relates to a communication concerning data entered by
Europol in the information system or data stored in the work ﬁles for the purposes
of analysis, the joint supervisory body, in the event of persistent objections from
Europol or a Member State, may not overrule such objections unless by a majority
of two-thirds of its members after having heard Europol or the Member State
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

concerned. If there is no such majority, the joint supervisory body shall notify the
enquirer that it has carried out the checks, without giving any information which
might reveal to him whether or not he is known.
Where the appeal concerns the checking of data entered by a Member State in
the information system, the joint supervisory body shall ensure that the necessary
checks have been carried out correctly in close cooperation with the national
supervisory body of the Member State which entered the data. The joint super-
visory body shall notify the enquirer that it has carried out the checks, without
giving any information which might reveal to him whether or not he is known.
Where the appeal concerns the checking of data entered by Europol in the
information system or of data stored in the work ﬁles for the purposes of analysis,
the joint supervisory body shall ensure that the necessary checks have been carried
out by Europol. The joint supervisory body shall notify the enquirer that it has
carried out the checks, without giving any information which might reveal to him
whether or not he is known.
8.
The above provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to non-automated data held by
Europol in the form of data ﬁles, i.e. any structured set of personal data accessible
in accordance with speciﬁc criteria.
Article 20
Correction and deletion of data
1.
If it emerges that data held by Europol which have been communicated to it by
third States or third bodies or which are the result of its own analyses are incorrect
or that their input or storage contravenes this Convention, Europol shall correct or
delete such data.
2.
If data that are incorrect or that contravene this Convention have been passed
directly to Europol by Member States, they shall be obliged to correct or delete
them in collaboration with Europol. If incorrect data are transmitted by another
appropriate means or if the errors in the data supplied by Member States are due to
faulty transmission or have been transmitted in breach of the provisions of this
Convention or if they result from their being entered, taken over or stored in an
incorrect manner or in breach of the provisions of this Convention by Europol,
Europol shall be obliged to correct them or delete them in collaboration with the
Member States concerned.
3.
In the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Member States which are recipi-
ents of the data shall be notiﬁed forthwith. The recipient Member States shall also
correct or delete those data.
4.
Any person shall have the right to ask Europol to correct or delete incorrect data
concerning him.
Europol shall inform the enquirer that data concerning him have been corrected
or deleted. If the enquirer is not satisﬁed with Europol’s reply or if he has received
no reply within three months, he may refer the matter to the joint supervisory
body.

Article 21
Time limits for the storage and deletion of data ﬁles
1.
Data in data ﬁles shall be held by Europol only for as long as is necessary for the
performance of its tasks. The need for continued storage shall be reviewed no later
than three years after the input of data. Review of data stored in the information
system and its deletion shall be carried out by the inputting unit. Review of data
stored in other Europol data ﬁles and their deletion shall be carried out by Europol.
Europol shall automatically inform the Member States three months in advance of
the expiry of the time limits for reviewing the storage of data.
2.
During the review, the units referred to in the third and fourth sentences of para-
graph 1 above may decide on continued storage of data until the next review if this
is still necessary for the performance of Europol’s tasks. If no decision is taken on
the continued storage of data, those data shall automatically be deleted.
3.
Storage of personal data relating to individuals as referred to in point 1 of the ﬁrst
subparagraph of Article 10(1) may not exceed a total of three years. Each time
limit shall begin to run afresh on the date on which an event leading to the storage
of data relating to that individual occurs. The need for continued storage shall be
reviewed annually and the review documented.
4.
Where a Member State deletes from its national data ﬁles data communicated to
Europol which are stored in other Europol data ﬁles, it shall inform Europol
accordingly. In such cases, Europol shall delete the data unless it has further inter-
est in them, based on intelligence that is more extensive than that possessed by the
communicating Member State. Europol shall inform the Member State concerned
of the continued storage of such data.
5.
Deletion shall not occur if it would damage the interests of the data subject which
require protection. In such cases, the data may be used only with the consent of the
data subject.
Article 22
Correction and storage of data in paper ﬁles
1.
If it emerges that an entire paper ﬁle or data included in that ﬁle held by Europol
are no longer necessary for the performance of Europol’s tasks, or if the informa-
tion concerned is overall in contravention of this Convention, the paper ﬁle or data
concerned shall be destroyed. The paper ﬁle or data concerned must be marked as
not for use until they have been eﬀectively destroyed.
Destruction may not take place if there are grounds for assuming that the legit-
imate interests of the data subject would otherwise be prejudiced. In such cases, the
paper ﬁle must bear the same note prohibiting all use.
2.
If it emerges that data contained in the Europol paper ﬁles are incorrect, Europol
shall be obliged to correct them.
3.
Any person covered by a Europol paper ﬁle may claim the right vis-à-vis Europol
to correction or destruction of paper ﬁles or the inclusion of a note. Article 20(4)
and Article 24(2) and (7) shall be applicable.

Obligation of discretion and conﬁdentiality
1.
Europol organs, their members, the Deputy Directors, employees of Europol and

might be harmful to Europol or prejudice its activities.
2.
Europol organs, their members, the Deputy Directors, employees of Europol and
liaison oﬃcers, as well as any other person under a particular obligation of discre-
tion or conﬁdentiality, shall be bound not to disclose any facts or information
which come to their knowledge in the performance of their duties or the exercise of
their activities to any unauthorized person or to the public. This shall not apply to
facts or information too insigniﬁcant to require conﬁdentiality. The obligation of
discretion and conﬁdentiality shall apply even after leaving oﬃce or employment,
or after termination of activities. The particular obligation laid down in the ﬁrst
sentence shall be notiﬁed by Europol, and a warning given of the legal con-

Europol organs, their members, the Deputy Directors, employees of Europol and

the exercise of their activities, without reference to the Director or, in the case
of the Director himself, to the Management Board.
The Director or Management Board, depending on the case, shall approach
the judicial body or any other competent body with a view to taking the neces-
sary measures under the national law applicable to the body approached; such
measures may either be to adjust the procedures for giving evidence in order to
ensure the conﬁdentiality of the information, or, provided that the national law
concerned so permits, to refuse to make any communication concerning data
insofar as is vital for the protection of the interests of Europol or of a Member
State.
Where a Member State’s legislation provides for the right to refuse to give evi-
dence, persons asked to give evidence must obtain permission to do so. Permission
shall be granted by the Director and, as regards evidence to be given by the Dir-
ector, by the Management Board. Where a liaison oﬃcer is asked to give evidence
concerning information he receives from Europol, such permission shall be given
after the agreement of the Member State responsible for the oﬃcer concerned has
been obtained.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
733
 

Furthermore, if the possibility exists that the evidence may extend to informa-
tion and knowledge which a Member State has communicated to Europol or which
clearly involve a Member State, the position of that Member State concerning the
evidence must be sought before permission is given.
Permission to give evidence may be refused only insofar as this is necessary to
protect overriding interests of Europol or of a Member State or States that need
protection.
This obligation shall apply even after leaving oﬃce or employment or after
termination of activities.
4.
Each Member State shall treat any infringement of the obligation of discretion
or conﬁdentiality laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3 as a breach of the obligations
imposed by its law on oﬃcial or professional secrets or its provisions for the
protection of conﬁdential material.
Where appropriate, each Member State shall introduce, no later than the date of
entry into force of this Convention, the rules under national law or the provisions
required to proceed against breaches of the obligations of discretion or con-
ﬁdentiality referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3. It shall ensure that the rules and
provisions concerned apply also to its own employees who have contact with
Europol in the course of their work.

12. Declaration on Combating Terrorism (11 March 2004)
1. Introduction
The European Council, deeply shocked by the terrorist attacks in Madrid, expresses its
sympathy and solidarity to the victims, their families and to the Spanish people.
The callous and cowardly attacks served as a terrible reminder of the threat posed by
terrorism to our society. Acts of terrorism are attacks against the values on which the
Union is founded.
The Union and its Member States pledge to do everything within their power to
combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles of the
Union, the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the obligations set out
under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001).
The threat of terrorism aﬀects us all. A terrorist act against one country concerns
the international community as a whole. There will be neither weakness nor comprom-
ise of any kind when dealing with terrorists. No country in the world can consider
itself immune.
Terrorism will only be defeated by solidarity and collective action.
The European Council endorses the proposal of the European Parliament to declare
11 March a European day commemorating the victims of terrorism.
2. Solidarity clause
The European Council welcomes the political commitment of the Member States and
of the acceding States, taken as of now, to act jointly against terrorist acts, in the spirit
of the Solidarity Clause contained in Article 42 of the draft Constitution for Europe.
A separate Declaration is attached.
3. Security Strategy
The European Security Strategy, adopted by the European Council last December,
identiﬁed terrorism as one of the key threats to EU interests and requested the Presi-
dency and Secretary-General/High Representative Solana, in coordination with the
Commission, to present concrete proposals for implementing the Strategy, including
recommendations for combating the threat posed by terrorism and dealing with its
root causes.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N

In light of the events in Madrid, the European Council believes that full implemen-
tation of measures to combat terrorism is a matter of urgency.
The European Council calls for the development of an EU long-term strategy to
address all the factors which contribute to terrorism. As we stated in the Conclusions
of our meeting on 21 September 2001, the Union must increase its involvement in the
eﬀorts of the international community to prevent and stabilise regional conﬂicts and
promote good governance and the rule of law.
In addition, the European Council calls for work to be rapidly pursued to develop
the contribution of ESDP to the ﬁght against terrorism, on the basis of actions taken
since the Seville European Council.
The European Union will seek ways to improve the security of its citizens who are
resident, or travelling, in third countries and exposed to a terrorist threat.
4. Assistance to victims
The European Council calls for the adoption, before 1st May 2004, of the Council
Directive on compensation to crime victims.
The European Council invites the Commission to ensure the allocation, as a matter
of urgency, of the funds available in the 2004 budget for supporting victims of
terrorism.
5. Building on existing cooperation
At its meeting on 21 September 2001, the European Council adopted a Plan of Action
to Combat Terrorism which has since been supplemented by many important initia-
tives. The eﬀective combating of terrorism requires that measures adopted by the
Council be eﬀectively and comprehensively implemented by Member States.
(A) LEGISLATIVE MEASURES
The European Council acknowledges that the legislative framework created by the
Union for the purpose of combating terrorism and improving judicial cooperation has
a decisive role to play in combating terrorist activities. It urges all Member States to
take any measures that remain necessary to implement fully and without delay the
following legislative measures:
— Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant;
— Framework Decision on Joint Investigation Teams;
— Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism;
— Framework Decision on money laundering, the identiﬁcation, tracing, freezing and
conﬁscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime;
— Decision establishing Eurojust;
— Decision on the implementation of speciﬁc measures for police and judicial
cooperation to combat terrorism;
Any such measures should be in place no later than June 2004.
The European Council calls on Member States to implement the Framework
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
744

Decision on the execution of orders freezing property or evidence and to ratify the
Convention on the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, its Protocol and the three
Protocols to the Europol Convention by December 2004.
In addition, the Framework Decision on the Conﬁscation of Crime Related Pro-
ceeds, Instrumentalities and Property and the Framework Decision on Attacks against
Information Systems should be ﬁnalised by June 2004. Work on the Framework
Decision on the Mutual Recognition of Conﬁscation Orders should also be concluded
by June 2004 and work on the Framework Decision on a European Evidence Warrant
taken forward.
The European Council, with a view to the further development of the legislative
framework set out above, instructs the Council to examine measures in the following
areas:
—
proposals for establishing rules on the retention of communications traﬃc data by
service providers;
—
exchanges of information on convictions for terrorist oﬀences;
—
cross-border hot pursuit;
—
a European register on convictions and disqualiﬁcations;
—
a data base on forensic material; and
—
simplifying the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement
authorities of the Member States.
Priority should be given to the proposals under the retention of communication traﬃc
data and exchange of information on convictions with a view to adoption by June
2005.
Member States reaﬃrm their commitment to reinforce judicial cooperation. They
are invited to ensure the execution of any request for mutual legal assistance related to
terrorist oﬀences and to provide each other with the fullest cooperation.
The Commission is invited to bring forward a proposal aimed at the creation of a
European Programme for the protection of witnesses in terrorist cases.
(B) REINFORCING OPERATIONAL COOPERATION
The European Council calls on Member States to ensure that law enforcement agencies
(security services, police, customs etc.) cooperate with each other and exchange all
information relevant to combating terrorism as extensively as possible.
The European Council calls on Member States to ensure that the optimum and most
eﬀective use is made of existing EU bodies, in particular Europol and Eurojust, to
promote cooperation in the ﬁght against terrorism. It calls on Member States, to
ensure that:
—
Eurojust national correspondents for terrorist matters are designated by all
Member States and Eurojust is used to the maximum extent for the purpose of
cooperation in cross-border terrorism cases;
—
Europol and Eurojust representatives are associated with the work of Joint
Investigation Teams as far as possible;
—
The Europol/Eurojust agreement is adopted by May 2004.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
745
 

The European Council also calls on Member States to reinforce the role of Europol in
the ﬁght against terrorism by:
—
reinforcing its counter-terrorism capacities and reactivating the Counter-Terrorist
Task Force; and
—
ensuring that Europol is provided by Member States law enforcement authorities
with all relevant criminal intelligence related to terrorism as soon as it is
available.
The European Council calls on Europol to proceed with implementation of the
Europol Information System as quickly as possible.
In addition, the European Council underlines the role of the Police Chiefs’ Task
Force in coordinating operational measures in response to, and prevention of, terrorist
acts. The European Council calls on the Task Force to review how its operational
capacity can be reinforced and to focus on proactive intelligence. The Task Force is
invited to draw up, with the assistance of experts from intelligence services and from
Europol, a report on the terrorist attacks in Madrid.
The European Council calls on the Council to examine an interim report on the
outcome of the process of peer evaluation of national arrangements in the ﬁght
against terrorism by September 2004 and a ﬁnal report covering the Accession States
by September 2005.
The European Council, with a view to building on this cooperation, also instructs
the Council to put in place new committee structures capable of ensuring greater
operational cooperation on security and terrorism within the Union.
The European Council recognises that there is a need to ensure terrorist organisa-
tions and groups are starved of the components of their trade. In particular there is a
need to ensure greater security of ﬁrearms, explosives, bomb-making equipment, and
the technologies that contribute to the perpetration of terrorist outrages. It instructs
the Council to examine the scope for measures in this area.
(C) MAXIMISING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
The European Council calls on the Council to adopt the necessary measures to enable
the Draft Council Regulation and Draft Decision on the introduction of new functions
for the Schengen Information System (SIS), to come into force by June 2004.
Decisions should be taken on the location, management and ﬁnancing of SIS II by
May 2004 in order to allow the Commission to take forward its full development. The
Commission and the Council are urged to take forward work on the Visa Information
System (VIS) in line with the conclusions adopted in February 2004. The European
Council calls on the Commission to submit proposals for enhanced interoperability
between European databases and to explore the creation of synergies between existing
and future information systems (SIS II, VIS and EURODAC) in order to exploit their
added value within their respective legal and technical frameworks in the prevention
and ﬁght against terrorism.
The European Council invites the Commission to bring forward proposals to the
June European Council in relation to exchange of personal information (DNA, ﬁnger-
prints and visa data) for the purpose of combating terrorism. The Commission
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
746
 
www.ebook3000.com

proposals should also include provisions to enable national law enforcement agencies
to have access to the EU systems.
The Council is also invited to consider the criteria that should be applied for the
purposes of Article 96 of the Schengen Convention in relation to certain persons
reported for the purpose of being refused entry.
6. Strengthening border controls and document security
Improved border controls and document security play an important role in combating
terrorism.
The European Council therefore emphasises that work on measures in this area
needs to be expedited. In particular, work will be taken forward on:
—
the proposal for a Regulation establishing a European Borders Agency with a view
to adoption by May 2004 and the Agency made operational by 1 January 2005;
—
the proposed Council Directive on the obligation of carriers to communicate
passenger data with view to an early conclusion on this measure; and
—
the adoption of the Draft Strategy for Customs Cooperation and a related work
plan by May 2004, and the subsequent implementation of measures to combat
terrorism as a matter of urgency.
The European Council also instructs the Council to adopt by the end of 2004 the
Commission’s proposals for the incorporation of biometric features into passports and
visas, with a view to the ﬁnalisation of the technical speciﬁcation to be adopted by the
Commission by the same deadline.
The European Council, with a view to further developments of these measures
instructs the Council to take forward, on the basis of a proposal from the Commis-
sion, work on the creation by end 2005 of an integrated system for the exchange of
information on stolen and lost passports having recourse to the SIS and the Interpol
database.
It also invites the Commission to bring forward a proposal no later than June 2004
for a common EU approach to the use of passengers data for border and aviation
security and other law enforcement purposes.
7. EU Guidelines for a Common Approach to Combating Terrorism
The European Council welcomes the EU Guidelines for a Common Approach to
Combating Terrorism which demonstrate the commitment of the Union to prevent
and suppress terrorism in a visible and coherent manner.
8. Strategic objectives for a revised EU Plan of Action to
Combat Terrorism
Building on existing cooperation, the European Council agreed updated Strategic
Objectives to enhance the EU Plan of Action to Combat Terrorism (contained in
Annex I).
The following high level Strategic Objectives will be implemented:
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
747
 

— Deepen the international consensus and enhance international eﬀorts to combat
terrorism.
—
Reduce the access of terrorists to ﬁnancial and other economic resources.
—
Maximise capacity within EU bodies and Member States to detect, investigate and
prosecute terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks.
—
Protect the security of international transport and ensure eﬀective systems of
border control.
—
Enhance the capability of Member States to deal with the consequences of a
terrorist attack.
—
Address the factors which contribute to support for, and recruitment into,
terrorism.
—
Target actions under EU external relations towards priority Third Countries
where counter-terrorist capacity or commitment to combating terrorism needs to
be enhanced.
The European Council requests the Council to complete the adoption of the revised
Plan of Action and to report back to the June European Council.
9. Sharing of intelligence
Underlining the importance of more eﬃcient intelligence cooperation and improved
threat assessment, the European Council calls upon Member States to improve
mechanisms for cooperation and the promotion of eﬀective systematic collaboration
between police, security and intelligence services.
The ﬂow of intelligence in relation to all aspects of terrorism to Europol should be
improved.
The further development of the relationship between Europol and intelligence
services will also be taken forward.
The European Council endorses the eﬀorts of Secretary-General/High Representa-
tive Solana to integrate, within the Council Secretariat, an intelligence capacity on all
aspects of the terrorist threat with a view to informing EU policy and invites him to
make proposals in advance of the June European Council.
10. Preventing the ﬁnancing of terrorism
The European Council believes that strong preventive action must continue to be taken
on the sources of ﬁnancing of terrorist organisations and to swiftly disrupt the ﬂow
of ﬁnancial resources to terrorist groups and related entities and individuals, while
respecting the rule of law. In this regard, it invites the Council to identify measures to
improve the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of the mechanism set up to freeze the assets of
terrorists and terrorist organizations and to identify the holders and true beneﬁciaries
of bank accounts, irrespective of their place of residence.
The European Council calls on all Member States to ratify and fully implement the
1999 UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and to give
eﬀect to the provisions of UNSCR 1373 directed to the freezing of assets.
Member States are invited to increase cooperation between national competent
authorities, Financial Intelligence Units and private ﬁnancial institutions to facilitate
improved exchange of information on terrorist ﬁnancing.
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
748
 
www.ebook3000.com

The Commission will consider improvements on regulation and transparency of
legal entities, including charities and alternative remittance systems, which may be used
by terrorists to acquire funding for their activities.
The EU will pursue dialogue with third countries on this crucial issue in order to
step up the ﬁght against the ﬁnancing of terrorism.
11. Measures to protect transport and population
The European Council calls for the strengthening of the security of all forms of
transport systems, including through the enhancement of the legal framework and
the improvement of prevention mechanisms. The Commission is, in particular,
invited to bring forward a proposal for enhancing the security measures in harbours
and ships.
Further action is needed to strengthen capacity within Member States to alleviate
the consequences of attacks on the civilian population, including in the areas of health
security and civil protection, building on existing EU Health Security and CBRN
programmes.
The Commission, the Council and the Member States, as appropriate, should
develop policies to strengthen the protection of citizens, essential services (such as
water supplies, energy and communications) and production systems (agro-food and
process industries), as well as to establish mechanisms (surveillance, early warning,
alert and response systems and procedures) to deal with the consequences of any
terrorist attacks.
12. International cooperation
Supporting the key role of the United Nations, the European Council will continue to
work to ensure universal adherence to, and full implementation of, all UN Security
Council Resolutions, UN Conventions on Terrorism and related Protocols.
The European Union will work with and within international, regional and sub-
regional organisations to strengthen international solidarity in countering terrorism.
The European Union will ensure eﬀective and practical cooperation with Third
countries in combating terrorism, in particular through the following measures:
—
Development of technical assistance strategies, to facilitate vulnerable Third coun-
tries in enhancing their counter-terrorism capability, and by addressing counter-
terrorism concerns into all relevant external assistance programmes to promote
good governance and the rule of law.
—
ensure that counter-terrorism is a key element of political dialogue at all levels with
Third Countries, in particular those which represent a potential terrorist threat to
international peace and security.
—
The European Union will analyse and evaluate the commitment of countries to
combat terrorism on an ongoing basis. This will be an inﬂuencing factor in EU
relations with them.
The European Council calls for the optimum use of all EU police resources deployed
in Third countries, also in the context of EU crisis management.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
749
 

13. Cooperation with US and partners
Building on the solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the 2001 Plan of Action to
Combat Terrorism, the European Council will seek to further strengthen cooperation
with the US and other partners in countering the threat posed by terrorism.
14. Establishment of the position of a Counter-Terrorism Coordinator
The European Council emphasises that a comprehensive and strongly coordinated
approach is required in response to the threat posed by terrorism.
The European Council accordingly agrees to the establishment of the position of a
Counter-Terrorism Co-ordinator.
The Co-ordinator, who will work within the Council Secretariat, will co-ordinate the
work of the Council in combating terrorism and, with due regard to the responsibilities
of the Commission, maintain an overview of all the instruments at the Union’s
disposal with a view to regular reporting to the Council and eﬀective follow-up of
Council decisions.
The European Council welcomes the decision of Secretary General/High Represen-
tative Solana to appoint Mr. Gijs de Vries to the position of Counter-Terrorism
Coordinator.
15. The way forward
The European Council invites the Council, in cooperation with Secretary-General/High
Representative Solana and the Commission, to report in detail to the June European
Council on the state of implementation of these measures.

Draft Declaration on solidarity against terrorism
We, the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the European Union,
and of the States acceding to the Union on 1 May, have declared our ﬁrm intention as
follows:
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
752
 
www.ebook3000.com

In the spirit of the solidarity clause laid down in Article 42 of the draft Treaty
establishing a Constitution for Europe, the Member States and the acceding States
shall accordingly act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if one of them is the victim of a
terrorist attack. They shall mobilise all the instruments at their disposal, including
military resources to:
•
prevent the terrorist threat in the territory of one of them;
•
protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from any terrorist attack;
•
assist a Member State or an acceding State in its territory at the request of its
political authorities in the event of a terrorist attack.
It shall be for each Member State or acceding State to the Union to choose the most
appropriate means to comply with this solidarity commitment towards the aﬀected State.
13. Report from the Commission based on Article 11 of the
Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on Combating
Terrorism (8 June 2004)
1. Background
Under Article 11 of the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on combating
terrorism (hereafter ‘the Framework Decision’), the Commission has to establish a
written report on the measures taken by the Member States to comply with this
instrument.
Paragraph (1) of that Article obliges the Member States to take the necessary meas-
ures to comply with the provisions of the Framework Decision by 31 December 2002.
According to paragraph (2), by that same date Member States should forward to the
General Secretariat of the Council and to the Commission the text of the provisions
transposing into their national law the obligations imposed on them under this
Framework Decision. The Council should assess, by 31 December 2003, on the basis
of this information and the written report by the Commission, to what extent Member
States have taken the necessary measures to comply with the Framework Decision.
The quality and timeliness of the national information received by the Commission
inevitably inﬂuences the value and the punctuality of this report. The Commission
reminded Member States of their obligation by means of a letter sent 9 December
2002. By 31 December 2002, however, only ﬁve Member States (Austria, Germany,
Ireland, Italy and Portugal) had provided the Commission with information on
implementation and only two of them actually included the relevant transposing provi-
sions. A document drawn up on this basis would have been virtually meaningless, so
the Commission has had to admit late replies and gather complementary information
from the contact persons, when designated by Member States. By February 2003, seven
more Member States (Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Greece, Spain, and the
United Kingdom) had responded although two of them just referred to new draft
legislation. Sweden was the thirteenth Member State to reply, on 5 November 2003.
Luxembourg and the Netherlands did not reply.
Therefore, although the deadline for forwarding the text of implementing pro-
visions, as set in Article 11(2) of the Framework Decision, was 31 December 2002,
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  E U RO P E A N  U N I O N
753
 

additional information provided until the cut-oﬀ date of 15 February 2004 has been
taken into account. This report thus takes stock of the transposal situation deriving
from the legislation that had been forwarded to the Commission by that reference date.
A Commission staﬀ working paper associated with this report contains a detailed
analysis of national measures taken to comply with the Framework Decision, as well
as a table specifying, in accordance with the information received by the Commission,
the national provisions transposing each of the Articles. The Commission will, in a
supplementary report, take into account the information supplied after that date and
update, the case being, the information on national legislation.
2. Method and criteria for evaluation for this framework decision
2.1.1. FRAMEWORK-DECISIONS EX-ARTICLE 34, PARAGRAPH (2), POINT (B) OF THE
TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION
This Framework Decision is based on the Treaty establishing the European Union
(TEU), and in particular Articles 29, 31 (e), and Article 34(2) (b) thereof.
Framework decisions can best be compared with the legal instrument of a directive.
Both instruments are binding upon Member States as to the result to be achieved but
leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods. However, framework
decisions shall not entail direct eﬀect.
2.1.2. EVALUATION CRITERIA
To be able to evaluate on the basis of objective criteria whether a framework decision
has been fully implemented by a Member State, some general criteria are developed
with respect to directives which should be applied mutatis mutandis to framework
decisions, such as:
1.
form and methods of implementation of the result to be achieved must be chosen
in a manner which ensures that the directive functions eﬀectively with account
being taken of its aims;
2.
each Member State is obliged to implement directives in a manner which satisﬁes
the requirements of clarity and legal certainty and thus to transpose the provisions
of the directive into national provisions having binding force;
3.
transposition need not necessarily require enactment in precisely the same words in
an express legal provision; thus a general legal context (such as appropriate already
existing measures) may be suﬃcient, as long as the full application of the directive
is assured in a suﬃciently clear and precise manner;
4.
directives must be implemented within the period prescribed therein.
Both instruments are binding ‘as to the results to be achieved’. That may be deﬁned
as a legal or factual situation, which does justice to the interest, which in accordance
with the Treaty the instrument is to ensure.
The general assessment provided for in Article 11, of the extent to which the Member
States have complied with the Framework Decision, is – where possible – based on the
criteria mentioned above.

2.1.3. CONTEXT OF EVALUATION
A ﬁrst preliminary observation concerns the (legal) context and follow up of the evalu-
ation report. Whereas the Commission has within the ﬁrst pillar the authority to start
an infringement procedure against a Member State this possibility does not exist
within the TEU.
The nature and purpose of this report diﬀers, therefore, from a report on the imple-
mentation of a ﬁrst pillar directive by Member States. Nevertheless, as the Commission
fully participates in third pillar matters, it is coherent to confer on it a task of a factual
evaluation of the implementation measures enabling the Council to assess the extent to
which Member States have taken the necessary measures in order to comply with this
Framework Decision.
Secondly, the Framework Decision must not be regarded as a series of fragmentary
provisions, but as a whole: a global system whose elements are inevitably intertwined.
Basically, it requires Member States to incorporate the qualiﬁed concept of ‘terrorist
oﬀences’ to their legal systems and, in particular, to incorporate the speciﬁc terrorist
intent, which is also implicit in Articles 2 (‘Oﬀences relating to a terrorist group’) and 3
(‘Oﬀences linked to terrorist activities’). This requirement derives from the obligation,
set up in Article 5(2), to punish terrorist oﬀences with heavier custodial sentences than
those imposable under national law for the correspondent ‘common’ oﬀences. Add-
itionally, the obligations set up in Article 9 which provides for extended extraterritorial
jurisdiction without the possibility of making declarations and establishes a mechanism
of priority factors to be taken into account in case of positive conﬂicts of competence,
also go beyond the obligations ordinarily imposed by framework decisions. Although
structurally similar to other instruments aimed at the harmonisation of a particular
ﬁeld of criminal law, this Framework Decision thus diﬀers from those that do not
require the incorporation of ‘speciﬁc oﬀences’ as long as the conduct to be criminal-
ised is already covered by a generic incrimination. In these cases, obligations regard-
ing penalties can also be respected by applying the general rules on the matter.
Therefore although the evaluation can and will refer to each article these can not be
contemplated separately. Partial or inexistent implementation of an article or part of
an article will also reﬂect on linked provisions that considered independently might
seem to comply with the requirements of the Framework Decision and will aﬀect the
system as a whole.
Nonetheless, as divergences still exist the evaluation shall take, as far as appropriate,
account of the general criminal legal background of the Member States.
3. Assessment
Very few Member States have made a timely transmission to the Commission of all
relevant texts of their implementing provisions. The factual assessment and subsequent
conclusions drawn are therefore sometimes based on incomplete information. The
Commission received no information from Luxembourg and the Netherlands and no
speciﬁc information from Greece.
This being said, the situation regarding transposal of the speciﬁc provisions in the
twelve other Member States is as follows:
Article 1: Eight Member States have speciﬁcally incriminated terrorist oﬀences as a
separate category of crimes, although there are diﬀerences as to the extent and method

of implementation while Ireland is in the process of amending their legislation to this
end. Italy and the United Kingdom provide only for a limited number of speciﬁc terror-
ist oﬀences and then qualify common oﬀences by a terrorist intent either as an aggra-
vating circumstance (in Italy) or by applying a general deﬁnition of terrorism (United
Kingdom). Germany appears not to have transposed this provision as required.
Article 2: Most Member States have or will have legislation that separately incrimin-
ates terrorist acts committed in relation to terrorist groups. In Sweden and in Denmark
(except certain acts of participation) terrorist groups and directing or participating in
their activities have not been speciﬁcally incriminated, although in some cases those
who carry out such conducts may still be punished as principal or secondary parties to
the relevant terrorist oﬀence.
Article 3: Only four Member States appear to have legislation that fully complies
with the obligations under this Article. Ireland should be able to comply after its new
legislation enters into force. The rest of the Member States which provided information to
the Commission will be able to comply only partially with this provision.
Article 4: Although only some Member States have speciﬁc provisions on the matter,
it appears that by applying general rules on complicity and inchoate oﬀences they will
be able to comply implicitly with this Article, provided the preceding articles have been
fully implemented.
Article 5: Although only two Member States expressly referred to it in the informa-
tion provided to the Commission, it appears they all will be able to meet the terms of
paragraph (1). Eight Member States have or will have succeeded in meeting the obliga-
tion imposed by paragraph (2). For Germany, Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom
it cannot be concluded that enhanced penalties will be provided for all the relevant
oﬀences. As regards paragraph (3), when it comes to directing a terrorist group, seven
Member States provide for the required penalties and three more, in which this conduct
is not speciﬁcally incriminated, would also comply partially with this provision. Spain
only complies with this provision as regards directing a terrorist group that merely
threatens to commit terrorist acts. When it comes to participating in the activities of
a terrorist group eight Member States fully meet the required terms, which can be
considered as partially met in four more Member States.
Article 6: National legislation in six Member States speciﬁcally envisages the particu-
lar circumstances set up in this Article, whereas the rest have not referred to speciﬁc
measures to implement this optional provision.
Article 7: Eight Member States have or will have, after completing their legislative
procedure, legislation ensuring that legal persons can be held liable for terrorist
oﬀences.
From these, however, only four have provided enough information to demonstrate
that they will be able to comply with Article 7(2). Spain, Austria, Sweden and the
United Kingdom did not provide enough information to allow this Article to be
considered fully implemented.
Article 8: Seven Member States provide or will provide for criminal or non-criminal
ﬁnes for legal persons. Most of them also apply all or some of the optional penalties
indicated in this provision.
Article 9: All Member States will presumably be able to comply with this Article as
regards the application of the territoriality principle in Articles 9(1)(a), 9(1)(b) and
9(4). As regards extra-territorial jurisdiction, a majority of Member States have or will
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

have rules which to diﬀerent extents cover the principles of active and passive personal-
ity, as required in Article 9(1)(c) and (e). Article 9(1)(d) has only been expressly trans-
posed in Austria and will be in Ireland, although it appears that Italy, Portugal and
Finland would also be in line with this provision. Eight Member States have or will
have legislation complying with Article 9(3) and the other three will be able to comply
partially with this provision. Finally, whilst Ireland will partially transpose Article 9(2),
none of the Member States appear to have incorporated in their national legislations
the criteria for solving positive conﬂicts of jurisdiction referred to in this provision.
Article 10: Only Austria provided enough information to demonstrate compliance
with Article 10(1) although it seems likely that terrorist oﬀences are in all Member
States treated as public oﬀences for the purposes of investigation and prosecution.
Eight Member States provided information on additional measures to assist terrorist
victim’s families, to which Article 10(2) refers.
Article 12: The Commission has not received speciﬁc information on transposition
in Gibraltar. In view of the foregoing, the Commission invites the Member States
which have not yet done so to ensure a rapid and complete transposition of
the Framework Decision into their national law and to inform it immediately of the
measures taken with the text of the statutory or administration provisions in force
in support.

OSCE to assist participating States, at their request, in preventing and combating
terrorism in all its forms;
18. Undertake to fulﬁl their obligation, in accordance with the United Nations conven-

2. Ministerial Council Decision No. 7/03 (2 December 2003):
Travel Document Security
The Ministerial Council,
Recognizing United Nations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) as a major
element of the international legal framework for the ﬁght against terrorism,
Determined to further intensify eﬀorts in the implementation of existing OSCE
commitments on combating terrorism, as reﬂected in the OSCE Charter on Preventing
and Combating Terrorism, the Porto Ministerial Council Decision No. 1 on imple-
menting the OSCE commitments and activities on combating terrorism, and the
Bucharest Plan of Action for Combating Terrorism,
Reaﬃrming its commitment to implement eﬀective and resolute measures against
terrorism and to prevent the movement of terrorist individuals or groups through
eﬀective border controls and controls relating to the issuance of identity papers and
travel documents,
Acknowledging the important work on this issue done by other international organ-
izations, in particular the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the
Group of Eight (G8),
Decides:
—
That all OSCE participating States should aim to comply fully with the recom-
mended ICAO minimum security standards for the handling and issuance of pass-
ports as well as other travel documents by December 2004, pending the availability
of the necessary technical and ﬁnancial resources;
—
That all OSCE participating States should begin to issue machine-readable travel
documents, if possible with digitized photographs, by December 2005, pending the
availability of the necessary technical and ﬁnancial resources;
—
That all OSCE participating States should consider the possibility of providing
travel documents with one or more biometric identiﬁers as soon as technically
feasible and after the ICAO biometric standards are adopted.
Encourages participating States with the capability to do so to provide ﬁnancial and
technical assistance in implementing these measures to other participating States that
request it;
Tasks the Secretary General with convening in the ﬁrst quarter of 2004 an expert
workshop on implementation of this decision and needs for related assistance.
3. Ministerial Council Decision No. 6/03 (2 December 2003):
Terms of Reference for the OSCE Counter-Terrorism Network
The Ministerial Council,
Acknowledging the need to strengthen the co-ordination of counter-terrorism
measures and information sharing between OSCE participating States and within their
capitals,
Recalling Decision No. 1 (MC(10).DEC/1) of 7 December 2002 of the Tenth Meeting
of the Ministerial Council, on implementing the OSCE commitments and activities on
combating terrorism,
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
762
 
www.ebook3000.com

Decides to establish the OSCE Counter-Terrorism Network (CTN) in accordance
with the terms of reference for the Network contained in the annex to this decision.
The primary purpose of the OSCE Counter-Terrorism Network (CTN) is to promote
the strengthening of co-ordination of counter-terrorism measures and information-
sharing between OSCE participating States. In particular, it aims to strengthen the
liaison between the delegations of participating States, counter-terrorism oﬃcials in
capitals and the OSCE Action against Terrorism Unit (ATU). The Network facilitates
timely exchanges of information on counter-terrorism programmes, training and legal
developments initiated by the OSCE and participating States, as well as on open-
source analyses concerning trends in terrorist phenomena. The primary emphasis will
be placed on supporting and supplementing the work of the United Nations Security
Council Counter-Terrorism Committee in implementing Security Council resolution
1373. The CTN is not intended to be a conduit for intelligence or other sensitive
information, nor does it seek to duplicate functions of other international and regional
law-enforcement networks.
Each government will designate a principal liaison to serve, through its OSCE dele-
gation, as the principal contact point with the ATU on counter-terrorism matters. The
principal liaison will ensure that communications from the ATU are forwarded to the
appropriate government authorities in the capital concerned, and that the ATU and
delegations are similarly informed in a timely manner of relevant developments in the
participating State. In order to foster co-ordination, communications through the
Counter-Terrorism Network passing between the ATU and a principal liaison will in
principle be transmitted through the OSCE delegation of the State concerned.
Responsibilities of the ATU
1.
Inform participating States of bilateral as well as multilateral training opportun-
ities related to counter-terrorism matters, and work with principal liaisons to take
full advantage of such programmes.
2.
Co-ordinate and facilitate OSCE counter-terrorism activities, including capacity-
building assistance programmes, training and contingency-preparedness work-
shops, with a view to eﬀectively utilizing resources and averting duplication.
3.
Respond to information and requests for action from principal liaisons in a timely
manner.
4.
Ensure that, through the delegations, the principal liaisons are kept fully informed
of developments regarding signiﬁcant counter-terrorism matters that aﬀect the
OSCE region, by means of regular distribution by email of an ATU newsletter and
of regular updates of the OSCE ATU home page.
5.
Co-ordinate with the principal liaison, through the delegation concerned, when an
OSCE ATU oﬃcial travels to a participating State in connection with terrorism-
related matters.
Responsibilities of principal liaisons
1.
Ensure that communications from the ATU reach the appropriate government
oﬃces, and that responses to the ATU are forwarded in a timely manner.
2.
Provide information to the ATU about signiﬁcant national developments regarding
O RG A N I S AT I O N  F O R  S E C U R I T Y  A N D  C O - O P E R AT I O N  I N  E U RO P E
763
 

action to combat terrorism, including new counter-terrorism legislation, counter-
terrorism training or assistance programmes and examples of national ‘best
practices’.
3.
Communicate information on seminars, workshops and conferences related to
counter-terrorism concerns that participating States may host, and that are open to
outside participation.
4.
Serve as the principal co-ordinator for OSCE anti-terrorism seminars, workshops
and conferences involving the principal liaison’s participating State.
5.
Co-ordinate, prioritize and communicate, on behalf of the participating State con-
cerned, training and assistance needs and requests related to counter-terrorism
matters that the OSCE might support or facilitate.
Means of communication and support
The ATU will, where possible and appropriate, use Internet-based technologies to
communicate with principal liaisons and others on the CTN, with email being the most
common tool. Principal liaisons are, however, encouraged to consult the OSCE and
CTC web sites regularly. As needed, the ATU will recommend meetings of principal
liaisons to participating States, subject to authorization by the Permanent Council and
availability of funding, either on the margins of other annual OSCE meetings such as
the Annual Security Review Conference, or as a separate event.
One P–1 contracted position will be added to the ATU staﬀ in 2004 to support the
development and maintenance of the CTN.
The OSCE ATU relies on oﬃcial notiﬁcations of ratiﬁcation through the web
sites of the relevant depositories of anti-terrorism instruments for the most accurate
information on ratiﬁcation.

ACTION BY THE UNITED STATES
1. CRS Report for Congress the USA PATRIOT Act: A Sketch
Summary
Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act (the Act) in response to the terrorists’ attacks
of September 11, 2001. The Act gives federal oﬃcials greater authority to track and
intercept communications, both for law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering
purposes. It vests the Secretary of the Treasury with regulatory powers to combat
corruption of U.S. ﬁnancial institutions for foreign money laundering purposes.
It seeks to further close our borders to foreign terrorists and to detain and remove
those within our borders. It creates new crimes, new penalties, and new procedural
eﬃciencies for use against domestic and international terrorists. Although it is not
without safeguards, critics contend some of its provisions go too far. Although it
grants many of the enhancements sought by the Department of Justice, others are
concerned that it does not go far enough.
The Act originated as H.R.2975 (the PATRIOT Act) in the House and S.1510 in the
Senate (the USA Act). S.1510 passed the Senate on October 11, 2001, 147 Cong.Rec.
S10604 (daily ed.). The House Judiciary Committee reported out an amended version
of H.R. 2975 on the same day, H.R.Rep.No. 107–236. The House passed H.R. 2975
the following day after substituting the text of H.R. 3108, 147 Cong.Rec. H6775–776
(daily ed. Oct. 12, 2001). The House version incorporated most of the money launder-
ing provisions found in an earlier House bill, H.R. 3004, many of which had counter-
parts in S.1510 as approved by the Senate. The House subsequently passed a clean bill,
H.R. 3162 (under suspension of the rules), which resolved the diﬀerences between
H.R. 2975 and S.1510, 147 Cong.Rec. H7224 (daily ed. Oct. 24, 2001). The Senate
agreed to the changes, 147 Cong.Rec. S10969 (daily ed. Oct. 24, 2001), and H.R. 3162
was sent to the President who signed it on October 26, 2001.
This is an abbreviated version of The USA PATRIOT Act: A Legal Analysis, CRS
Report RL31377, stripped of its citations and footnotes.
Criminal investigations: tracking and gathering communications
Federal communications privacy law features a three tiered system, erected for the
dual purpose of protecting the conﬁdentiality of private telephone, face-to-face, and
computer communications while enabling authorities to identify and intercept criminal
765
 

communications. Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968 supplies the ﬁrst level. It prohibits electronic eavesdropping on telephone con-
versations, face-to-face conversations, or computer and other forms of electronic com-
munications in most instances. It does, however, give authorities a narrowly deﬁned
process for electronic surveillance to be used as a last resort in serious criminal cases.
When approved by senior Justice Department oﬃcials, law enforcement oﬃcers may
seek a court order authorizing them to secretly capture conversations concerning any
of a statutory list of oﬀenses (predicate oﬀenses). Title III court orders come replete
with instructions describing the permissible duration and scope of the surveillance as
well as the conversations which may be seized and the eﬀorts to be taken to minimize
the seizure of innocent conversations. The court notiﬁes the parties to any conversa-
tions seized under the order after the order expires. Below Title III, the next tier of
privacy protection covers telephone records, e-mail held in third party storage, and
the like, 18 U.S.C. 2701–2709 (Chapter 121). Here, the law permits law enforcement
access, ordinarily pursuant to a warrant or court order or under a subpoena in some
cases, but in connection with any criminal investigation and without the extraordin-
ary levels of approval or constraint that mark a Title III interception. Least demand-
ing and perhaps least intrusive of all is the procedure that governs court orders
approving the government’s use of trap and trace devices and pen registers, a kind of
secret ‘caller id.’, which identify the source and destination of calls made to and from
a particular telephone, 18 U.S.C. 3121–3127 (Chapter 206). The orders are available
based on the government’s certiﬁcation, rather than a ﬁnding of a court, that use of
the device is likely to produce information relevant to the investigation of a crime,
any crime. The devices record no more than identity of the participants in a tele-
phone conversation, but neither the orders nor the results they produce need ever be
revealed to the participants. The Act modiﬁes the procedures at each of the three
levels. It:
•
permits pen register and trap and trace orders for electronic communications
(e.g., e-mail);
•
authorizes nationwide execution of court orders for pen registers, trap and trace
devices, and access to stored e-mail or communication records;
•
treats stored voice mail like stored e-mail (rather than like telephone conversations);
•
permits authorities to intercept communications to and from a trespasser within a
computer system (with the permission of the system’s owner);
•
adds terrorist and computer crimes to Title III’s predicate oﬀense list;
•
reinforces protection for those who help execute Title III, ch. 121, and ch. 206
orders;
•
encourages cooperation between law enforcement and foreign intelligence
investigators;
•
establishes a claim against the U.S. for certain communications privacy violations
by government personnel; and
•
terminates the authority found in many of these provisions and several of the
foreign intelligence amendments with a sunset provision (Dec. 31, 2005).

Foreign intelligence investigations
The Act eases some of the restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the
United States, and aﬀords the U.S. intelligence community greater access to informa-
tion unearthed during a criminal investigation, but it also establishes and expands
safeguards against oﬃcial abuse. More speciﬁcally, it:
•
permits ‘roving’ surveillance (court orders omitting the identiﬁcation of the par-
ticular instrument, facilities, or place where the surveillance is to occur when the
court ﬁnds the target is likely to thwart identiﬁcation with particularity);
•
increases the number of judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
court from 7 to 11;
•
allows application for a FISA surveillance or search order when gathering foreign
intelligence is a signiﬁcant reason for the application rather than the reason;
•
authorizes pen register and trap & trace device orders for e-mail as well as tele-
phone conversations;
•
sanctions court ordered access to any tangible item rather than only business
records held by lodging, car rental, and locker rental businesses;
•
carries a sunset provision;
•
establishes a claim against the U.S. for certain communications privacy violations
by government personnel; and
•
expands the prohibition against FISA orders based solely on an American’s exer-
cise of his or her First Amendment rights.
Money laundering
In federal law, money laundering is the ﬂow of cash or other valuables derived from, or
intended to facilitate, the commission of a criminal oﬀense. It is the movement of the
fruits and instruments of crime. Federal authorities attack money laundering through
regulations, criminal sanctions, and forfeiture. The Act bolsters federal eﬀorts in each
area.
Regulation: The Act expands the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to regulate
the activities of U.S. ﬁnancial institutions, particularly their relations with foreign
individuals and entities. He is to promulgate regulations:
•
under which securities brokers and dealers as well as commodity merchants,
advisors and pool operators must ﬁle suspicious activity reports (SARs);
•
requiring businesses, which were only to report cash transactions involving more
than $10,000 to the IRS, to ﬁle SARs as well;
•
imposing additional ‘special measures’ and ‘due diligence’ requirements to combat
foreign money laundering;
•
prohibiting U.S. ﬁnancial institutions from maintaining correspondent accounts
for foreign shell banks;
•
preventing ﬁnancial institutions from allowing their customers to conceal their
ﬁnancial activities by taking advantage of the institutions’ concentration account
practices;
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S
767
 

•
establishing minimum new customer identiﬁcation standards and recordkeeping
and recommending an eﬀective means to verify the identity of foreign customers;
•
encouraging ﬁnancial institutions and law enforcement agencies to share informa-
tion concerning suspected money laundering and terrorist activities; and
•
requiring ﬁnancial institutions to maintain anti-money laundering programs which
must include at least a compliance oﬃcer; an employee training program; the
development of internal policies, procedures and controls; and an independent
audit feature.
Crimes: The Act contains a number of new money laundering crimes, as well as
amendments and increased penalties for earlier crimes. It:
•
outlaws laundering (in the U.S.) any of the proceeds from foreign crimes of violence
or political corruption;
•
prohibits laundering the proceeds from cybercrime or supporting a terrorist
organization;
•
increases the penalties for counterfeiting;
•
seeks to overcome a Supreme Court decision ﬁnding that the conﬁscation of over
$300,000 (for attempt to leave the country without reporting it to customs) consti-
tuted an unconstitutionally excessive ﬁne;
•
provides explicit authority to prosecute overseas fraud involving American credit
cards; and
•
endeavors to permit prosecution of money laundering in the place where the
predicate oﬀense occurs.
Forfeiture: The Act creates two types of forfeitures and modiﬁes several conﬁscation-
related procedures. It allows conﬁscation of all of the property of any individual or
entity that participates in or plans an act of domestic or international terrorism; it also
permits conﬁscation of any property derived from or used to facilitate domestic or
international terrorism. The Constitution’s due process, double jeopardy, and ex post
facto clauses may limit the anticipated breath of these provisions. Procedurally, the
Act:
•
establishes a mechanism to acquire long arm jurisdiction, for the purposes of
forfeiture proceedings, over individuals and entities;
•
allows conﬁscation of property located in this country for a wider range of crimes
committed in violation of foreign law;
•
permits U.S. enforcement of foreign forfeiture orders;
•
calls for the seizure of correspondent accounts held in U.S. ﬁnancial institutions
for foreign banks who are in turn holding forfeitable assets overseas; and
•
denies corporate entities the right to contest a conﬁscation if their principal
shareholder is a fugitive.
Alien terrorists and victims
The Act contains a number of provisions designed to prevent alien terrorists from
entering the United States, particularly from Canada; to enable authorities to detain

and deport alien terrorists and those who support them; and to provide humanitarian
immigration relief for foreign victims of the attacks on September 11.
Other crimes, penalties, and procedures
New crimes: The Act creates new federal crimes for terrorist attacks on mass trans-
portation facilities, for biological weapons oﬀenses, for harboring terrorists, for aﬀord-
ing terrorists material support, for misconduct associated with money laundering
already mentioned, for conducting the aﬀairs of an enterprise which aﬀects inter-
state or foreign commerce through the patterned commission of terrorist oﬀenses,
and for fraudulent charitable solicitation. Although strictly speaking these are new
federal crimes, they generally supplement existing law by ﬁlling gaps and increasing
penalties.
New penalties: The Act increases the penalties for acts of terrorism and for crimes
which terrorists might commit. More speciﬁcally it establishes an alternative maximum
penalty for acts of terrorism, raises the penalties for conspiracy to commit certain
terrorist oﬀenses, envisions sentencing some terrorists to life-long parole, and increases
the penalties for counterfeiting, cybercrime, and charity fraud.
Other procedural adjustments: In other procedural adjustments designed to facilitate
criminal investigations, the Act:
•
increases the rewards for information in terrorism cases;
•
expands the Posse Comitatus Act exceptions;
•
authorizes ‘sneak and peek’ search warrants;
•
permits nationwide and perhaps worldwide execution of warrants in terrorism
cases;
•
eases government access to conﬁdential information;
•
allows the Attorney General to collect DNA samples from prisoners convicted of
any federal crime of violence or terrorism;
•
lengthens the statute of limitations applicable to crimes of terrorism;
•
clariﬁes the application of federal criminal law on American installations and in
residences of U.S. government personnel overseas; and
•
adjust federal victims’ compensation and assistance programs.
A section, found in the Senate bill but ultimately dropped, would have changed the
provision of federal law which requires Justice Department prosecutors to adhere to
the ethical standards of the legal profession where they conduct their activities (the
McDade-Murtha Amendment), 28 U.S.C. 530B.

2. Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before
and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001
Abridged ﬁndings and conclusions
Factual ﬁndings
1.
Finding: While the Intelligence Community had amassed a great deal of valuable
intelligence regarding Usama Bin Ladin and his terrorist activities, none of it
identiﬁed the time, place, and speciﬁc nature of the attacks that were planned for
September 11, 2001. Nonetheless, the Community did have information that was
clearly relevant to the September 11 attacks, particularly when considered for its
collective signiﬁcance.
2.
Finding: During the spring and summer of 2001, the Intelligence Community
experienced a signiﬁcant increase in information indicating that Bin Ladin and
al-Qa ida intended to strike against U.S. interests in the very near future.
3.
Finding: Beginning in 1998 and continuing into the summer of 2001, the Intelli-
gence Community received a modest, but relatively steady, stream of intelligence
reporting that indicated the possibility of terrorist attacks within the United
States. Nonetheless, testimony and interviews conﬁrm that it was the general view
of the Intelligence Community, in the spring and summer of 2001, that the threat-
ened Bin Ladin attacks would most likely occur against U.S. interests overseas,
despite indications of plans and intentions to attack in the domestic United
States.
4.
Finding: From at least 1994, and continuing into the summer of 2001, the Intelli-
gence Community received information indicating that terrorists were contemplat-
ing, among other means of attack, the use of aircraft as weapons. This information
did not stimulate any speciﬁc Intelligence Community assessment of, or collective
U.S. Government reaction to, this form of threat.
5.
Finding: Although relevant information that is signiﬁcant in retrospect regarding
the attacks was available to the Intelligence Community prior to September 11,
2001, the Community too often failed to focus on that information and consider
and appreciate its collective signiﬁcance in terms of a probable terrorist attack.
Neither did the Intelligence Community demonstrate suﬃcient initiative in coming
to grips with the new transnational threats. Some signiﬁcant pieces of information
in the vast stream of data being collected were overlooked, some were not recog-
nized as potentially signiﬁcant at the time and therefore not disseminated, and
some required additional action on the part of foreign governments before a direct
connection to the hijackers could have been established. For all those reasons, the
Intelligence Community failed to fully capitalize on available, and potentially
important, information. The sub-ﬁndings below identify each category of this
information.
[Terrorist communications in 1999]
5.
a. [During 1999, the National Security Agency obtained a number of communica-
tions—none of which included speciﬁc detail regarding the time, place or nature
of the September 11 attacks—connecting individuals to terrorism who were

identiﬁed, after September 11, 2001, as participants in the attacks that occurred
on that day.]
Malaysia meeting and travel of al-Qa ida operatives to the United States
5.
b. The Intelligence Community acquired additional, and highly signiﬁcant, infor-
mation regarding Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi in early 2000. Crit-
ical parts of the information concerning al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi lay dormant
within the Intelligence Community for as long as eighteen months, at the very
time when plans for the September 11 attacks were proceeding. The CIA missed
repeated opportunities to act based on information in its possession that these
two Bin Ladin-associated terrorists were traveling to the United States, and to
add their names to watchlists.
[Terrorist communications in Spring 2000]
5.
c. [In January 2000, after the meeting of al-Qa ida operatives in Malaysia, Khalid
al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi entered the United States [ ]. Thereafter, the
Intelligence Community obtained information indicating that an individual
named ‘Khaled’ at an unknown location had contacted a suspected terrorist
facility in the Middle East. The Intelligence Community reported some of this
information, but did not report all of it. Some of it was not reported because it
was deemed not terrorist-related. It was not until after September 11, 2001 that
the Intelligence Community determined that these contacts had been made
from future hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar while he was living within the domestic
United States.]
[Two hijackers had numerous contacts with an active FBI informant]
5.
d. [This Joint Inquiry conﬁrmed that these same two future hijackers, Khalid al-
Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, had numerous contacts with a long time FBI
counterterrorism informant in California and that a third future hijacker, Hani
Hanjour, apparently had more limited contact with the informant. In mid- to
late- 2000, the CIA already had information indicating that al-Mihdhar had a
multiple entry U.S. visa and that al-Hazmi had in fact traveled to Los Angeles,
but the two had not been watchlisted and information suggesting that two
suspected terrorists could well be in the United States had not yet been given to
the FBI. The San Diego FBI ﬁeld oﬃce that handled the informant in question,
did not receive that information or any of the other intelligence information
pertaining to al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi, prior to September 11, 2001. As a
result, the FBI missed the opportunity to task a uniquely well-positioned
informant—who denies having any advance knowledge of the plot—to collect
information about the hijackers and their plans within the United States].

The Phoenix Electronic Communication
5.
e. On July 10, 2001, an FBI Phoenix ﬁeld oﬃce agent sent an ‘Electronic Com-
munication’ to 4 individuals in the Radical Fundamentalist Unit (RFU) and
two people in the Usama Bin Ladin Unit (UBLU) at FBI headquarters, and to
two agents on International Terrorism squads in the New York Field Oﬃce. In
the communication, the agent expressed his concerns, based on his ﬁrst-hand
knowledge, that there was a coordinated eﬀort underway by Bin Ladin to send
students to the United States for civil aviation-related training. He noted that
there was an ‘inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest’ in this
type of training in Arizona and expressed his suspicion that this was an eﬀort to
establish a cadre of individuals in civil aviation who would conduct future ter-
rorist activity. The Phoenix EC requested that FBI Headquarters consider
implementing four recommendations:
•
accumulate a list of civil aviation university/colleges around the country;
•
establish liaison with these schools;
•
discuss the theories contained in the Phoenix EC with the Intelligence
Community; and
•
consider seeking authority to obtain visa information concerning indi-
viduals seeking to attend ﬂight schools.
However, the FBI headquarters personnel did not take the action requested by the
Phoenix agent prior to September 11, 2001. The communication generated little
or no interest at either FBI Headquarters or the FBI’s New York ﬁeld oﬃce.
The FBI investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui
5.
f. In August 2001, the FBI’s Minneapolis ﬁeld oﬃce, in conjunction with the INS,
detained Zacarias Moussaoui, a French national who had enrolled in ﬂight
training in Minnesota. FBI agents there also suspected that Moussaoui was
involved in a hijacking plot. FBI Headquarters attorneys determined that there
was not probable cause to obtain a court order to search Moussaoui’s belong-
ings under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). However, personnel
at FBI Headquarters, including the Radical Fundamentalism Unit and the
National Security Law Unit, as well as agents in the Minneapolis ﬁeld oﬃce,
misunderstood the legal standard for obtaining an order under FISA. As a
result, FBI Minneapolis Field Oﬃce personnel wasted valuable investigative
resources trying to connect the Chechen rebels to al-Qa ida. Finally, no one at
the FBI apparently connected the Moussaoui investigation with the heightened
threat environment in the summer of 2001, the Phoenix communication, or the
entry of al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi into the United States.
Hijackers in contact with persons of FBI investigative interest
in the United States
5.
g. The Joint Inquiry conﬁrmed that at least some of the hijackers were not as
isolated during their time in the United States as has been previously suggested.
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

Rather, they maintained a number of contacts both in the United States and
abroad during this time period. Some of those contacts were with individuals
who were known to the FBI, through either past or, at the time, ongoing FBI
inquiries and investigations. Although it is not known to what extent any of
these contacts in the United States were aware of the plot, it is now clear that
they did provide at least some of the hijackers with substantial assistance while
they were living in this country.
Hijackers’ associates in Germany
5.
h. [Since 1995, the CIA had been aware of a radical Islamic presence in Germany,
including individuals with connections to Usama Bin Ladin. Prior to Septem-
ber 11, 2001, the CIA had unsuccessfully sought additional information on
individuals who have now been identiﬁed as associates of some of the hijackers.]
Khalid Shaykh Mohammad
5.
i. Prior to September 11, the Intelligence Community had information linking
Khalid Shaykh Mohammed (KSM), now recognized by the Intelligence Com-
munity as the mastermind of the attacks, to Bin Ladin, to terrorist plans to use
aircraft as weapons, and to terrorist activity in the United States. The Intelli-
gence Community, however, relegated Khalid Shaykh Mohammed (KSM) to
rendition target status following his 1996 indictment in connection with the
Bojinka Plot and, as a result, focused primarily on his location, rather than his
activities and place in the al-Qa ida hierarchy. The Community also did not
recognize the signiﬁcance of reporting in June 2001 concerning KSM’s active
role in sending terrorists to the United States, or the facilitation of their activities
upon arriving in the United States. Collection eﬀorts were not targeted on
information about KSM that might have helped better understand al-Qa ida’s
plans and intentions, and KSM’s role in the September 11 attacks was a surprise
to the Intelligence Community.
[Terrorist communications in September 2001]
5.
j. [In the period from September 8 to September 10, 2001 NSA intercepted, but did
not translate or disseminate until after September 11, some communications that
indicated possible impending terrorist activity.]
Conclusion—factual ﬁndings
In short, for a variety of reasons, the Intelligence Community failed to capitalize on
both the individual and collective signiﬁcance of available information that appears
relevant to the events of September 11. As a result, the Community missed opportun-
ities to disrupt the September 11th plot by denying entry to or detaining would-be
hijackers; to at least try to unravel the plot through surveillance and other investigative
work within the United States; and, ﬁnally, to generate a heightened state of alert and
thus harden the homeland against attack.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S

No one will ever know what might have happened had more connections been drawn
between these disparate pieces of information. We will never deﬁnitively know to what
extent the Community would have been able and willing to exploit fully all the
opportunities that may have emerged. The important point is that the Intelligence Com-
munity, for a variety of reasons, did not bring together and fully appreciate a range of
information that could have greatly enhanced its chances of uncovering and preventing
Usama Bin Ladin’s plan to attack these United States on September 11, 2001.
Systemic ﬁndings
Our review of the events surrounding September 11 has revealed a number of systemic
weaknesses that hindered the Intelligence Community’s counterterrorism eﬀorts before
September 11. If not addressed, these weaknesses will continue to undercut U.S.
counterterrorist eﬀorts. In order to minimize the possibility of attacks like September 11
in the future, eﬀective solutions to those problems need to be developed and fully
implemented as soon as possible.
1.
Finding: Prior to September 11, the Intelligence Community was neither well
organized nor equipped, and did not adequately adapt, to meet the challenge posed
by global terrorists focused on targets within the domestic United States. Serious
gaps existed between the collection coverage provided by U.S. foreign and U.S.
domestic intelligence capabilities. The U.S. foreign intelligence agencies paid
inadequate attention to the potential for a domestic attack. The CIA’s failure to
watchlist suspected terrorists aggressively reﬂected a lack of emphasis on a process
designed to protect the homeland from the terrorist threat. As a result, CIA
employees failed to watchlist al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi. At home, the counterter-
rorism eﬀort suﬀered from the lack of an eﬀective domestic intelligence capability.
The FBI was unable to identify and monitor eﬀectively the extent of activity by
al-Qa ida and other international terrorist groups operating in the United States.
Taken together, these problems greatly exacerbated the nation’s vulnerability to an
increasingly dangerous and immediate international terrorist threat inside the
United States.
2.
Finding: Prior to September 11, 2001, neither the U.S. Government as a whole nor
the Intelligence Community had a comprehensive counterterrorist strategy for
combating the threat posed by Usama Bin Ladin. Furthermore, the Director of
Central Intelligence (DCI) was either unwilling or unable to marshal the full range
of Intelligence Community resources necessary to combat the growing threat to the
United States.
3.
Finding: Between the end of the Cold War and September 11, 2001, overall Intelli-
gence Community funding fell or remained even in constant dollars, while funding
for the Community’s counterterrorism eﬀorts increased considerably. Despite those
increases, the accumulation of intelligence priorities, a burdensome requirements
process, the overall decline in Intelligence Community funding, and reliance on
supplemental appropriations made it diﬃcult to allocate Community resources
eﬀectively against an evolving terrorist threat. Ineﬃciencies in the resource and
requirements process were compounded by problems in Intelligence Community
budgeting practices and procedures.

4.
Finding: While technology remains one of this nation’s greatest advantages, it has
not been fully and most eﬀectively applied in support of U.S. counterterrorism
eﬀorts. Persistent problems in this area included a lack of collaboration between
Intelligence Community agencies, a reluctance to develop and implement new
technical capabilities aggressively, the FBI’s reliance on outdated and insuﬃcient
technical systems, and the absence of a central counterterrorism database.
5.
Finding: Prior to September 11, the Intelligence Community’s understanding of al-
Qa ida was hampered by insuﬃcient analytic focus and quality, particularly in
terms of strategic analysis. Analysis and analysts were not always used eﬀectively
because of the perception in some quarters of the Intelligence Community that they
were less important to agency counterterrorism missions than were operations
personnel. The quality of counterterrorism analysis was inconsistent, and many
analysts were inexperienced, unqualiﬁed, under-trained, and without access to crit-
ical information. As a result, there was a dearth of creative, aggressive analysis
targeting Bin Ladin and a persistent inability to comprehend the collective signiﬁ-
cance of individual pieces of intelligence. These analytic deﬁciencies seriously
undercut the ability of U.S. policymakers to understand the full nature of the
threat, and to make fully informed decisions.
6.
Finding: Prior to September 11, the Intelligence Community was not prepared to
handle the challenge it faced in translating the volumes of foreign language coun-
terterrorism intelligence it collected. Agencies within the Intelligence Community
experienced backlogs in material awaiting translation, a shortage of language
specialists and language-qualiﬁed ﬁeld oﬃcers, and a readiness level of only 30% in
the most critical terrorism-related languages used by terrorists.
7.
Finding: [Prior to September 11, the Intelligence Community’s ability to produce
signiﬁcant and timely signals intelligence on counterterrorism was limited by NSA’s
failure to address modern communications technology aggressively, continuing
conﬂict between Intelligence Community agencies, NSA’s cautious approach to
any collection of intelligence relating to activities in the United States, and insuﬃ-
cient collaboration between NSA and the FBI regarding the potential for terrorist
attacks within the United States].
8.
Finding: The continuing erosion of NSA’s program management expertise and
experience has hindered its contribution to the ﬁght against terrorism. NSA con-
tinues to have mixed results in providing timely technical solutions to modern
intelligence collection, analysis, and information sharing problems.
9.
Finding: The U.S. Government does not presently bring together in one place all
terrorism-related information from all sources. While the CIA’s Counterterrorist
Center does manage overseas operations and has access to most Intelligence Com-
munity information, it does not collect terrorism-related information from all
sources, domestic and foreign. Within the Intelligence Community, agencies did not
adequately share relevant counterterrorism information, prior to September 11.
This breakdown in communications was the result of a number of factors, includ-
ing diﬀerences in the agencies’ missions, legal authorities and cultures. Information
was not suﬃciently shared, not only between diﬀerent Intelligence Community
agencies, but also within individual agencies, and between the intelligence and the
law enforcement agencies.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S
775
 

10. Finding: Serious problems in information sharing also persisted, prior to September
11, between the Intelligence Community and relevant non-Intelligence Community
agencies. This included other federal agencies as well as state and local authorities.
This lack of communication and collaboration deprived those other entities, as well
as the Intelligence Community, of access to potentially valuable information in the
‘war’ against Bin Ladin. The Inquiry’s focus on the Intelligence Community
limited the extent to which it explored these issues, and this is an area that should
be reviewed further.
11. Finding: Prior to September 11, 2001, the Intelligence Community did not eﬀect-
ively develop and use human sources to penetrate the al-Qa ida inner circle.
This lack of reliable and knowledgeable human sources signiﬁcantly limited the
Community’s ability to acquire intelligence that could be acted upon before the
September 11 attacks. In part, at least, the lack of unilateral (i.e., U.S.-recruited)
counterterrorism sources was a product of an excessive reliance on foreign liaison
services.
12. Finding: During the summer of 2001, when the Intelligence Community was
bracing for an imminent al-Qa ida attack, diﬃculties with FBI applications for
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance and the FISA process led
to a diminished level of coverage of suspected al-Qa ida operatives in the United
States. The eﬀect of these diﬃculties was compounded by the perception that
spread among FBI personnel at Headquarters and the ﬁeld oﬃces that the FISA
process was lengthy and fraught with peril.
13. Finding: [ ].
14. Finding: [Senior U.S. military oﬃcials were reluctant to use U.S. military assets
to conduct oﬀensive counterterrorism eﬀorts in Afghanistan, or to support or
participate in CIA operations directed against al-Qa ida prior to September 11. At
least part of this reluctance was driven by the military’s view that the Intelligence
Community was unable to provide the intelligence needed to support military
operations. Although the U.S. military did participate in [ ] counterterrorism eﬀorts
to counter Usama Bin Ladin’s terrorist network prior to September 11, 2001, most
of the military’s focus was on force protection].
15. Finding: The Intelligence Community depended heavily on foreign intelligence
and law enforcement services for the collection of counterterrorism intelligence
and the conduct of other counterterrorism activities. The results were mixed in
terms of productive intelligence, reﬂecting vast diﬀerences in the ability and will-
ingness of the various foreign services to target the Bin Ladin and al-Qa ida network.
Intelligence Community agencies sometimes failed to coordinate their relationships
with foreign services adequately, either within the Intelligence Community or
with broader U.S. Government liaison and foreign policy eﬀorts. This reliance on
foreign liaison services also resulted in a lack of focus on the development of
unilateral human sources.
16. Finding: [The activities of the September 11 hijackers in the United States appear
to have been ﬁnanced, in large part, from monies sent to them from abroad and
also brought in on their persons. Prior to [page xix] September 11, there was no
coordinated U.S. Government-wide strategy to track terrorist funding and close
down their ﬁnancial support networks. There was also a reluctance in some parts
of the U.S. Government to track terrorist funding and close down their ﬁnancial

support networks. As a result, the U.S. Government was unable to disrupt ﬁnancial
support for Usama Bin Ladin’s terrorist activities eﬀectively.]
Related ﬁndings
17. Finding: Despite intelligence reporting from 1998 through the summer of 2001
indicating that Usama Bin Ladin’s terrorist network intended to strike inside the
United States, the United States Government did not undertake a comprehensive
eﬀort to implement defensive measures in the United States.
18. Finding: Between 1996 and September 2001, the counterterrorism strategy adopted
by the U. S. Government did not succeed in eliminating Afghanistan as a sanctuary
and training ground for Usama Bin Ladin’s terrorist network. A range of instru-
ments was used to counter al-Qa ida, with law enforcement often emerging as a
leading tool because other means were deemed not to be feasible or failed to
produce results. While generating numerous successful prosecutions, law enforce-
ment eﬀorts were not adequate by themselves to target or eliminate Bin Ladin’s
sanctuary. The United States persisted in observing the rule of law and accepted
norms of international behavior, but Bin Ladin and al-Qa ida recognized no rules
and thrived in the safe haven provided by Afghanistan.
19. Finding: Prior to September 11, the Intelligence Community and the U.S. Gov-
ernment labored to prevent attacks by Usama Bin Ladin and his terrorist network
against the United States, but largely without the beneﬁt of an alert, mobilized and
committed American public. Despite intelligence information on the immediacy of
the threat level in the spring and summer of 2001, the assumption prevailed in the
U.S. Government that attacks of the magnitude of September 11 could not happen
here. As a result, there was insuﬃcient eﬀort to alert the American public to the
reality and gravity of the threat.

Regarding Certain Sensitive National Security Matters.’
3. The 9/11 Commission Report Final Report of the National
Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States
(Executive Summary) (22 July 2004)
We present the narrative of this report and the recommendations that ﬂow from it to
the President of the United States, the United States Congress, and the American
people for their consideration. Ten Commissioners—ﬁve Republicans and ﬁve Demo-
crats chosen by elected leaders from our nation’s capital at a time of great partisan
division—have come together to present this report without dissent.
We have come together with a unity of purpose because our nation demands it.
September 11, 2001, was a day of unprecedented shock and suﬀering in the history of
the United States. The nation was unprepared.
A NATION TRANSFORMED
At 8:46 on the morning of September 11, 2001, the United States became a nation
transformed. An airliner traveling at hundreds of miles per hour and carrying some
10,000 gallons of jet fuel plowed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S
777
 

Lower Manhattan. At 9:03, a second airliner hit the South Tower. Fire and smoke
billowed upward. Steel, glass, ash, and bodies fell below. The Twin Towers, where up to
50,000 people worked each day, both collapsed less than 90 minutes later. At 9:37 that
same morning, a third airliner slammed into the western face of the Pentagon. At
10:03, a fourth airliner crashed in a ﬁeld in southern Pennsylvania. It had been aimed
at the United States Capitol or the White House, and was forced down by heroic
passengers armed with the knowledge that America was under attack. More than 2,600
people died at the World Trade Center; 125 died at the Pentagon; 256 died on the four
planes. The death toll surpassed that at Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
This immeasurable pain was inﬂicted by 19 young Arabs acting at the behest of
Islamist extremists headquartered in distant Afghanistan. Some had been in the
United States for more than a year, mixing with the rest of the population. Though
four had training as pilots, most were not well-educated. Most spoke English poorly,
some hardly at all. In groups of four or ﬁve, carrying with them only small knives, box
cutters, and cans of Mace or pepper spray, they had hijacked the four planes and
turned them into deadly guided missiles.
Why did they do this? How was the attack planned and conceived? How did the U.S.
government fail to anticipate and prevent it? What can we do in the future to prevent
similar acts of terrorism?
A shock, not a surprise
The 9/11 attacks were a shock, but they should not have come as a surprise. Islamist
extremists had given plenty of warning that they meant to kill Americans indiscrimin-
ately and in large numbers. Although Usama Bin Ladin himself would not emerge as a
signal threat until the late 1990s, the threat of Islamist terrorism grew over the decade.
In February 1993, a group led by Ramzi Yousef tried to bring down the World Trade
Center with a truck bomb. They killed six and wounded a thousand. Plans by Omar
Abdel Rahman and others to blow up the Holland and Lincoln tunnels and other New
York City landmarks were frustrated when the plotters were arrested. In October 1993,
Somali tribesmen shot down U.S. helicopters, killing 18 and wounding 73 in an inci-
dent that came to be known as ‘Black Hawk down.’ Years later it would be learned that
those Somali tribesmen had received help from al Qaeda. In early 1995, police in
Manila uncovered a plot by Ramzi Yousef to blow up a dozen U.S. airliners while
they were ﬂying over the Paciﬁc. In November 1995, a car bomb exploded outside the
oﬃce of the U.S. program manager for the Saudi National Guard in Riyadh, killing
ﬁve Americans and two others. In June 1996, a truck bomb demolished the Khobar
Towers apartment complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 U.S. servicemen and
wounding hundreds. The attack was carried out primarily by Saudi Hezbollah, an
organization that had received help from the government of Iran. Until 1997, the U.S.
intelligence community viewed Bin Ladin as a ﬁnancier of terrorism, not as a terrorist
leader. In February 1998, Usama Bin Ladin and four others issued a self-styled fatwa,
publicly declaring that it was God’s decree that every Muslim should try his utmost to
kill any American, military or civilian, anywhere in the world, because of American
‘occupation’ of Islam’s holy places and aggression against Muslims.
In August 1998, Bin Ladin’s group, al Qaeda, carried out near-simultaneous
truck bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

Tanzania. The attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and wounded
thousands more.
In December 1999, Jordanian police foiled a plot to bomb hotels and other sites
frequented by American tourists, and a U.S. Customs agent arrested Ahmed Ressam at
the U.S. Canadian border as he was smuggling in explosives intended for an attack on
Los Angeles International Airport.
In October 2000, an al Qaeda team in Aden, Yemen, used a motorboat ﬁlled with
explosives to blow a hole in the side of a destroyer, the USS Cole, almost sinking the
vessel and killing 17 American sailors.
The 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were far more elabor-
ate, precise, and destructive than any of these earlier assaults. But by September 2001,
the executive branch of the U.S. government, the Congress, the news media, and
the American public had received clear warning that Islamist terrorists meant to kill
Americans in high numbers.
Who is the enemy?
Who is this enemy that created an organization capable of inﬂicting such horriﬁc
damage on the United States? We now know that these attacks were carried out by
various groups of Islamist extremists. The 9/11 attack was driven by Usama Bin Ladin.
In the 1980s, young Muslims from around the world went to Afghanistan to join as
volunteers in a jihad (or holy struggle) against the Soviet Union. A wealthy Saudi,
Usama Bin Ladin, was one of them. Following the defeat of the Soviets in the late
1980s, Bin Ladin and others formed al Qaeda to mobilize jihads elsewhere.
The history, culture, and body of beliefs from which Bin Ladin shapes and spreads his
message are largely unknown to many Americans. Seizing on symbols of Islam’s past
greatness, he promises to restore pride to people who consider themselves the victims of
successive foreign masters. He uses cultural and religious allusions to the holy Qur an
and some of its interpreters. He appeals to people disoriented by cyclonic change as they
confront modernity and globalization. His rhetoric selectively draws from multiple
sources—Islam, history, and the region’s political and economic malaise. Bin Ladin also
stresses grievances against the United States widely shared in the Muslim world. He
inveighed against the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, which is the home of
Islam’s holiest sites, and against other U.S. policies in the Middle East. Upon this polit-
ical and ideological foundation, Bin Ladin built over the course of a decade a dynamic
and lethal organization. He built an infrastructure and organization in Afghanistan that
could attract, train, and use recruits against ever more ambitious targets. He rallied new
zealots and new money with each demonstration of al Qaeda’s capability. He had forged
a close alliance with the Taliban, a regime providing sanctuary for al Qaeda.
By September 11, 2001, al Qaeda possessed
•
leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of a
major operation;
•
a personnel system that could recruit candidates, indoctrinate them, vet them, and
give them the necessary training;
•
communications suﬃcient to enable planning and direction of operatives and those
who would be helping them;
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S

•
an intelligence eﬀort to gather required information and form assessments of
enemy strengths and weaknesses;
•
the ability to move people great distances; and
•
the ability to raise and move the money necessary to ﬁnance an attack.
1998 to September 11, 2001
The August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania established al
Qaeda as a potent adversary of the United States. After launching cruise missile strikes
against al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings, the Clinton administration applied diplomatic pressure to try to persuade
the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to expel Bin Ladin. The administration also devised
covert operations to use CIA-paid foreign agents to capture or kill Bin Ladin and his
chief lieutenants.
These actions did not stop Bin Ladin or dislodge al Qaeda from its sanctuary. By
late 1998 or early 1999, Bin Ladin and his advisers had agreed on an idea brought to
them by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) called the ‘planes operation.’ It would
eventually culminate in the 9/11 attacks. Bin Ladin and his chief of operations,
Mohammed Atef, occupied undisputed leadership positions atop al Qaeda. Within
al Qaeda, they relied heavily on the ideas and enterprise of strong-willed ﬁeld com-
manders, such as KSM, to carry out worldwide terrorist operations. KSM claims that
his original plot was even grander than those carried out on 9/11—ten planes would
attack targets on both the East and West coasts of the United States. This plan was
modiﬁed by Bin Ladin, KSM said, owing to its scale and complexity. Bin Ladin pro-
vided KSM with four initial operatives for suicide plane attacks within the United
States, and in the fall of 1999 training for the attacks began. New recruits included four
from a cell of expatriate Muslim extremists who had clustered together in Hamburg,
Germany. One became the tactical commander of the operation in the United States:
Mohamed Atta.
U.S. intelligence frequently picked up reports of attacks planned by al Qaeda. Working
with foreign security services, the CIA broke up some al Qaeda cells. The core of Bin
Ladin’s organization nevertheless remained intact. In December 1999, news about the
arrests of the terrorist cell in Jordan and the arrest of a terrorist at the U.S.–Canadian
border became part of a ‘millennium alert.’ The government was galvanized, and the
public was on alert for any possible attack. In January 2000, the intense intelligence
eﬀort glimpsed and then lost sight of two operatives destined for the ‘planes oper-
ation.’ Spotted in Kuala Lumpur, the pair were lost passing through Bangkok. On
January 15, 2000, they arrived in Los Angeles.
Because these two al Qaeda operatives had spent little time in the West and spoke
little, if any, English, it is plausible that they or KSM would have tried to identify, in
advance, a friendly contact in the United States. We explored suspicions about
whether these two operatives had a support network of accomplices in the United
States. The evidence is thin—simply not there for some cases, more worrisome in
others.
We do know that soon after arriving in California, the two al Qaeda operatives
sought out and found a group of ideologically like-minded Muslims with roots in
Yemen and Saudi Arabia, individuals mainly associated with a young Yemeni and
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

others who attended a mosque in San Diego. After a brief stay in Los Angeles about
which we know little, the al Qaeda operatives lived openly in San Diego under their
true names. They managed to avoid attracting much attention.
By the summer of 2000, three of the four Hamburg cell members had arrived on the
East Coast of the United States and had begun pilot training. In early 2001, a fourth
future hijacker pilot, Hani Hanjour, journeyed to Arizona with another operative,
Nawaf al Hazmi, and conducted his refresher pilot training there. A number
al Qaeda operatives had spent time in Arizona during the 1980s and early 1990s.
During 2000, President Bill Clinton and his advisers renewed diplomatic eﬀorts to
get Bin Ladin expelled from Afghanistan. They also renewed secret eﬀorts with some
of the Taliban’s opponents—the Northern Alliance—to get enough intelligence to
attack Bin Ladin directly. Diplomatic eﬀorts centered on the new military government
in Pakistan, and they did not succeed. The eﬀorts with the Northern Alliance revived
an inconclusive and secret debate about whether the United States should take sides in
Afghanistan’s civil war and support the Taliban’s enemies. The CIA also produced a
plan to improve intelligence collection on al Qaeda, including the use of a small,
unmanned airplane with a video camera, known as the Predator.
After the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole, evidence accumulated that it had
been launched by al Qaeda operatives, but without conﬁrmation that Bin Ladin had
given the order. The Taliban had earlier been warned that it would be held responsible
for another Bin Ladin attack on the United States. The CIA described its ﬁndings as a
‘preliminary judgment’; President Clinton and his chief advisers told us they were
waiting for a conclusion before deciding whether to take military action. The military
alternatives remained unappealing to them.
The transition to the new Bush administration in late 2000 and early 2001 took place
with the Cole issue still pending. President George W. Bush and his chief advisers
accepted that al Qaeda was responsible for the attack on the Cole, but did not like the
options available for a response.
Bin Ladin’s inference may well have been that attacks, at least at the level of the
Cole, were risk free. The Bush administration began developing a new strategy with
the stated goal of eliminating the al Qaeda threat within three to ﬁve years. During the
spring and summer of 2001, U.S. intelligence agencies received a stream of warnings
that al Qaeda planned, as one report put it, ‘something very, very, very big.’ Director
of Central Intelligence George Tenet told us, ‘The system was blinking red.’ Although
Bin Ladin was determined to strike in the United States, as President Clinton had been
told and President Bush was reminded in a Presidential Daily Brief article briefed
to him in August 2001, the speciﬁc threat information pointed overseas. Numerous
precautions were taken overseas.
Domestic agencies were not eﬀectively mobilized. The threat did not receive
national media attention comparable to the millennium alert. While the United
States continued disruption eﬀorts around the world, its emerging strategy to eliminate
the al Qaeda threat was to include an enlarged covert action program in
Afghanistan, as well as diplomatic strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The pro-
cess culminated during the summer of 2001 in a draft presidential directive and argu-
ments about the Predator aircraft, which was soon to be deployed with a missile of its
own, so that it might be used to attempt to kill Bin Ladin or his chief lieutenants. At a
September 4 meeting, President Bush’s chief advisers approved the draft directive of
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S
781
 

the strategy and endorsed the concept of arming the Predator. This directive on the al
Qaeda strategy was awaiting President Bush’s signature on September 11, 2001.
Though the ‘planes operation’ was progressing, the plotters had problems of their
own in 2001. Several possible participants dropped out; others could not gain entry
into the United States (including one denial at a port of entry and visa denials not
related to terrorism). One of the eventual pilots may have considered abandoning the
planes operation. Zacarias Moussaoui, who showed up at a ﬂight training school in
Minnesota, may have been a candidate to replace him. Some of the vulnerabilities
of the plotters become clear in retrospect. Moussaoui aroused suspicion for seeking
fast-track training on how to pilot large jet airliners. He was arrested on August 16,
2001, for violations of immigration regulations. In late August, oﬃcials in the intelli-
gence community realized that the terrorists spotted in Southeast Asia in January 2000
had arrived in the United States. These cases did not prompt urgent action. No one
working on these late leads in the summer of 2001 connected them to the high level of
threat reporting. In the words of one oﬃcial, no analytic work foresaw the lightning
that could connect the thundercloud to the ground.
As ﬁnal preparations were under way during the summer of 2001, dissent emerged
among al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan over whether to proceed. The Taliban’s chief,
Mullah Omar, opposed attacking the United States. Although facing opposition from
many of his senior lieutenants, Bin Ladin eﬀectively overruled their objections, and the
attacks went forward.
September 11, 2001
The day began with the 19 hijackers getting through a security checkpoint system that
they had evidently analyzed and knew how to defeat. Their success rate in penetrating
the system was 19 for 19. They took over the four ﬂights, taking advantage of air crews
and cockpits that were not prepared for the contingency of a suicide hijacking. On
9/11, the defense of U.S. air space depended on close interaction between two federal
agencies: the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD). Existing protocols on 9/11 were unsuited in every
respect for an attack in which hijacked planes were used as weapons. What ensued was
a hurried attempt to improvise a defense by civilians who had never handled a hijacked
aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transform-
ation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. A shootdown authori-
zation was not communicated to the NORAD air defense sector until 28 minutes after
United 93 had crashed in Pennsylvania. Planes were scrambled, but ineﬀectively, as
they did not know where to go or what targets they were to intercept. And once the
shootdown order was given, it was not communicated to the pilots. In short, while
leaders in Washington believed that the ﬁghters circling above them had been
instructed to ‘take out’ hostile aircraft, the only orders actually conveyed to the pilots
were to ‘ID type and tail.’
Like the national defense, the emergency response on 9/11 was necessarily impro-
vised. In New York City, the Fire Department of New York, the New York Police
Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the building employees,
and the occupants of the buildings did their best to cope with the eﬀects of almost
unimaginable events—unfolding furiously over 102 minutes. Casualties were nearly
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

100 percent at and above the impact zones and were very high among ﬁrst responders
who stayed in danger as they tried to save lives. Despite weaknesses in preparations for
disaster, failure to achieve uniﬁed incident command, and inadequate communications
among responding agencies, all but approximately one hundred of the thousands
of civilians who worked below the impact zone escaped, often with help from the
emergency responders.
At the Pentagon, while there were also problems of command and control, the
emergency response was generally eﬀective. The Incident Command System, a formal-
ized management structure for emergency response in place in the National Capital
Region, overcame the inherent complications of a response across local, state, and
federal jurisdictions.
Operational opportunities
We write with the beneﬁt and handicap of hindsight. We are mindful of the danger
of being unjust to men and women who made choices in conditions of uncertainty
and in circumstances over which they often had little control. Nonetheless, there were
speciﬁc points of vulnerability in the plot and opportunities to disrupt it. Operational
failures—opportunities that were not or could not be exploited by the organizations
and systems of that time—included:
•
not watchlisting future hijackers Hazmi and Mihdhar, not trailing them after they
traveled to Bangkok, and not informing the FBI about one future hijacker’s U.S.
visa or his companion’s travel to the United States;
•
not sharing information linking individuals in the Cole attack to Mihdhar;
•
not taking adequate steps in time to ﬁnd Mihdhar or Hazmi in the United States;
•
not linking the arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui, described as interested in ﬂight
training for the purpose of using an airplane in a terrorist act, to the heightened
indications of attack;
•
not discovering false statements on visa applications;
•
not recognizing passports manipulated in a fraudulent manner;
•
not expanding no-ﬂy lists to include names from terrorist watchlists;
•
not searching airline passengers identiﬁed by the computer-based CAPPS screening
system; and
•
not hardening aircraft cockpit doors or taking other measures to prepare for the
possibility of suicide hijackings.
General ﬁndings
Since the plotters were ﬂexible and resourceful, we cannot know whether any single
step or series of steps would have defeated them. What we can say with conﬁdence
is that none of the measures adopted by the U.S. government from 1998 to 2001
disturbed or even delayed the progress of the al Qaeda plot. Across the government,
there were failures of imagination, policy, capabilities, and management.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S

Imagination
The most important failure was one of imagination. We do not believe leaders under-
stood the gravity of the threat. The terrorist danger from Bin Ladin and al Qaeda was
not a major topic for policy debate among the public, the media, or in the Congress.
Indeed, it barely came up during the 2000 presidential campaign.
Al Qaeda s new brand of terrorism presented challenges to U.S. governmental
institutions that they were not well-designed to meet. Though top oﬃcials all told us
that they understood the danger, we believe there was uncertainty among them as to
whether this was just a new and especially venomous version of the ordinary terrorist
threat the United States had lived with for decades, or it was indeed radically new,
posing a threat beyond any yet experienced.
As late as September 4, 2001, Richard Clarke, the White House staﬀer long respon-
sible for counterterrorism policy coordination, asserted that the government had not
yet made up its mind how to answer the question: ‘Is al Qaeda a big deal?’ A week
later came the answer.
Policy
Terrorism was not the overriding national security concern for the U.S. government
under either the Clinton or the pre-9/11 Bush administration. The policy challenges
were linked to this failure of imagination. Oﬃcials in both the Clinton and Bush
administrations regarded a full U.S. invasion of Afghanistan as practically inconceivable
before 9/11.
Capabilities
Before 9/11, the United States tried to solve the al Qaeda problem with the capabilities
it had used in the last stages of the Cold War and its immediate aftermath. These
capabilities were insuﬃcient. Little was done to expand or reform them.
The CIA had minimal capacity to conduct paramilitary operations with its own
personnel, and it did not seek a large-scale expansion of these capabilities before 9/11.
The CIA also needed to improve its capability to collect intelligence from human
agents.
At no point before 9/11 was the Department of Defense fully engaged in the mission
of countering al Qaeda, even though this was perhaps the most dangerous foreign
enemy threatening the United States.
America’s homeland defenders faced outward. NORAD itself was barely able to
retain any alert bases at all. Its planning scenarios occasionally considered the danger
of hijacked aircraft being guided to American targets, but only aircraft that were
coming from overseas.
The most serious weaknesses in agency capabilities were in the domestic arena. The
FBI did not have the capability to link the collective knowledge of agents in the ﬁeld to
national priorities. Other domestic agencies deferred to the FBI.
FAA capabilities were weak. Any serious examination of the possibility of a suicide
hijacking could have suggested changes to ﬁx glaring vulnerabilities—expanding no-ﬂy
lists, searching passengers identiﬁed by the CAPPS screening system, deploying federal
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

air marshals domestically, hardening cockpit doors, alerting air crews to a diﬀerent
kind of hijacking possibility than they had been trained to expect. Yet the FAA did not
adjust either its own training or training with NORAD to take account of threats
other than those experienced in the past.
Management
The missed opportunities to thwart the 9/11 plot were also symptoms of a broader
inability to adapt the way government manages problems to the new challenges of the
twenty-ﬁrst century. Action oﬃcers should have been able to draw on all available
knowledge about al Qaeda in the government. Management should have ensured that
information was shared and duties were clearly assigned across agencies, and across the
foreign-domestic divide. There were also broader management issues with respect to
how top leaders set priorities and allocated resources. For instance, on December 4,
1998, DCI Tenet issued a directive to several CIA oﬃcials and the DDCI for Community
Management, stating: ‘We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this
eﬀort, either inside CIA or the Community.’ The memorandum had little overall eﬀect
on mobilizing the CIA or the intelligence community. This episode indicates the limita-
tions of the DCI’s authority over the direction of the intelligence community, including
agencies within the Department of Defense.
The U.S. government did not ﬁnd a way of pooling intelligence and using it to guide
the planning and assignment of responsibilities for joint operations involving entities
as disparate as the CIA, the FBI, the State Department, the military, and the agencies
involved in homeland security.
Speciﬁc ﬁndings
Unsuccessful diplomacy
Beginning in February 1997, and through September 11, 2001, the U.S. government
tried to use diplomatic pressure to persuade the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to stop
being a sanctuary for al Qaeda, and to expel Bin Ladin to a country where he could
face justice. These eﬀorts included warnings and sanctions, but they all failed.
The U.S. government also pressed two successive Pakistani governments to demand
that the Taliban cease providing a sanctuary for Bin Ladin and his organization and,
failing that, to cut oﬀ their support for the Taliban. Before 9/11, the United States
could not ﬁnd a mix of incentives and pressure that would persuade Pakistan to
reconsider its fundamental relationship with the Taliban.
From 1999 through early 2001, the United States pressed the United Arab Emirates,
one of the Taliban’s only travel and ﬁnancial outlets to the outside world, to break oﬀ
ties and enforce sanctions, especially those related to air travel to Afghanistan. These
eﬀorts achieved little before 9/11. Saudi Arabia has been a problematic ally in combat-
ing Islamic extremism. Before 9/11, the Saudi and U.S. governments did not fully
share intelligence information or develop an adequate joint eﬀort to track and disrupt
the ﬁnances of the al Qaeda organization. On the other hand, government oﬃcials
of Saudi Arabia at the highest levels worked closely with top U.S. oﬃcials in major
initiatives to solve the Bin Ladin problem with diplomacy.

Lack of military options
In response to the request of policymakers, the military prepared an array of limited
strike options for attacking Bin Ladin and his organization from May 1998 onward.
When they briefed policymakers, the military presented both the pros and cons of
those strike options and the associated risks. Policymakers expressed frustration with
the range of options presented.
Following the August 20, 1998, missile strikes on al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan
and Sudan, both senior military oﬃcials and policymakers placed great emphasis on
actionable intelligence as the key factor in recommending or deciding to launch mili-
tary action against Bin Ladin and his organization. They did not want to risk signiﬁ-
cant collateral damage, and they did not want to miss Bin Ladin and thus make the
United States look weak while making Bin Ladin look strong. On three speciﬁc
occasions in 1998–1999, intelligence was deemed credible enough to warrant planning
for possible strikes to kill Bin Ladin. But in each case the strikes did not go forward,
because senior policymakers did not regard the intelligence as suﬃciently actionable to
oﬀset their assessment of the risks.
The Director of Central Intelligence, policymakers, and military oﬃcials expressed
frustration with the lack of actionable intelligence. Some oﬃcials inside the Pentagon,
including those in the special forces and the counterterrorism policy oﬃce, also
expressed frustration with the lack of military action. The Bush administration began
to develop new policies toward al Qaeda in 2001, but military plans did not change
until after 9/11.
Problems within the intelligence community
The intelligence community struggled throughout the 1990s and up to 9/11 to collect
intelligence on and analyze the phenomenon of transnational terrorism. The combin-
ation of an overwhelming number of priorities, ﬂat budgets, an outmoded structure,
and bureaucratic rivalries resulted in an insuﬃcient response to this new challenge.
Many dedicated oﬃcers worked day and night for years to piece together the growing
body of evidence on al Qaeda and to understand the threats. Yet, while there were
many reports on Bin Laden and his growing al Qaeda organization, there was no
comprehensive review of what the intelligence community knew and what it did not
know, and what that meant. There was no National Intelligence Estimate on terrorism
between 1995 and 9/11.
Before 9/11, no agency did more to attack al Qaeda than the CIA. But there were
limits to what the CIA was able to achieve by disrupting terrorist activities abroad and
by using proxies to try to capture Bin Ladin and his lieutenants in Afghanistan. CIA
oﬃcers were aware of those limitations.
To put it simply, covert action was not a silver bullet. It was important to engage
proxies in Afghanistan and to build various capabilities so that if an opportunity
presented itself, the CIA could act on it. But for more than three years, through
both the late Clinton and early Bush administrations, the CIA relied on proxy forces,
and there was growing frustration within the CIA’s Counterterrorist Center and in
the National Security Council staﬀ with the lack of results. The development of the
Predator and the push to aid the Northern Alliance were products of this frustration.

Problems in the FBI
From the time of the ﬁrst World Trade Center attack in 1993, FBI and Department
of Justice leadership in Washington and New York became increasingly concerned
about the terrorist threat from Islamist extremists to U.S. interests, both at home and
abroad. Throughout the 1990s, the FBI’s counterterrorism eﬀorts against international
terrorist organizations included both intelligence and criminal investigations. The
FBI’s approach to investigations was casespeciﬁc, decentralized, and geared toward
prosecution. Signiﬁcant FBI resources were devoted to after-the-fact investigations of
major terrorist attacks, resulting in several prosecutions.
The FBI attempted several reform eﬀorts aimed at strengthening its ability to pre-
vent such attacks, but these reform eﬀorts failed to implement organization-wide
institutional change. On September 11, 2001, the FBI was limited in several areas
critical to an eﬀective preventive counterterrorism strategy. Those working counterter-
rorism matters did so despite limited intelligence collection and strategic analysis
capabilities, a limited capacity to share information both internally and externally,
insuﬃcient training, perceived legal barriers to sharing information, and inadequate
resources.
Permeable borders and immigration controls
There were opportunities for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al Qaeda s
travel vulnerabilities. Considered collectively, the 9/11 hijackers
•
included known al Qaeda operatives who could have been watchlisted;
•
presented passports manipulated in a fraudulent manner;
•
presented passports with suspicious indicators of extremism;
•
made detectable false statements on visa applications;
•
made false statements to border oﬃcials to gain entry into the United States; and
•
violated immigration laws while in the United States.
Neither the State Department’s consular oﬃcers nor the Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service’s inspectors and agents were ever considered full partners in a national
counterterrorism eﬀort. Protecting borders was not a national security issue before
9/11.
Permeable aviation security
Hijackers studied publicly available materials on the aviation security system and used
items that had less metal content than a handgun and were most likely permissible.
Though two of the hijackers were on the U.S.TIPOFF terrorist watchlist, the FAA did
not use TIPOFF data. The hijackers had to beat only one layer of security—the secur-
ity checkpoint process. Even though several hijackers were selected for extra screening
by the CAPPS system, this led only to greater scrutiny of their checked baggage. Once
on board, the hijackers were faced with aircraft personnel who were trained to be
nonconfrontational in the event of a hijacking.

Financing
The 9/11 attacks cost somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to execute. The
operatives spent more than $270,000 in the United States. Additional expenses
included travel to obtain passports and visas, travel to the United States, expenses
incurred by the plot leader and facilitators outside the United States, and
expenses incurred by the people selected to be hijackers who ultimately did not
participate.
The conspiracy made extensive use of banks in the United States. The hijackers
opened accounts in their own names, using passports and other identiﬁcation docu-
ments. Their transactions were unremarkable and essentially invisible amid the billions
of dollars ﬂowing around the world every day.
To date, we have not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the
9/11 attacks. Al Qaeda had many sources of funding and a pre-9/11 annual budget
estimated at $30 million. If a particular source of funds had dried up, al Qaeda could
easily have found enough money elsewhere to fund the attack.
An improvised homeland defense
The civilian and military defenders of the nation’s airspace—FAA and NORAD—were
unprepared for the attacks launched against them. Given that lack of preparedness,
they attempted and failed to improvise an eﬀective homeland defense against an
unprecedented challenge. The events of that morning do not reﬂect discredit on opera-
tional personnel. NORAD’s Northeast Air Defense Sector personnel reached out for
information and made the best judgments they could based on the information they
received. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and command center managers
were creative and agile in recommending a nationwide alert, groundstopping local
traﬃc, ordering all aircraft nationwide to land, and executing that unprecedented
order ﬂawlessly.
At more senior levels, communication was poor. Senior military and FAA leaders
had no eﬀective communication with each other. The chain of command did not
function well. The President could not reach some senior oﬃcials. The Secretary of
Defense did not enter the chain of command until the morning’s key events were
over. Air National Guard units with diﬀerent rules of engagement were scrambled
without the knowledge of the President, NORAD, or the National Military Command
Center.
Emergency response
The civilians, ﬁreﬁghters, police oﬃcers, emergency medical technicians, and emer-
gency management professionals exhibited steady determination and resolve under
horrifying, overwhelming conditions on 9/11.Their actions saved lives and inspired a
nation.
Eﬀective decisionmaking in New York was hampered by problems in command
and control and in internal communications. Within the Fire Department of New
York, this was true for several reasons: the magnitude of the incident was unforeseen;
commanders had diﬃculty communicating with their units; more units were actually
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
788
 
www.ebook3000.com

dispatched than were ordered by the chiefs; some units self-dispatched; and once units
arrived at the World Trade Center, they were neither comprehensively accounted for
nor coordinated. The Port Authority’s response was hampered by the lack both of
standard operating procedures and of radios capable of enabling multiple commands
to respond to an incident in uniﬁed fashion.The New York Police Department, because
of its history of mobilizing thousands of oﬃcers for major events requiring crowd
control, had a technical radio capability and protocols more easily adapted to an
incident of the magnitude of 9/11.
Congress
The Congress, like the executive branch, responded slowly to the rise of transnational
terrorism as a threat to national security. The legislative branch adjusted little and
did not restructure itself to address changing threats. Its attention to terrorism was
episodic and splintered across several committees. The Congress gave little guidance
to executive branch agencies on terrorism, did not reform them in any signiﬁcant way
to meet the threat, and did not systematically perform robust oversight to identify,
address, and attempt to resolve the many problems in national security and domestic
agencies that became apparent in the aftermath of 9/11.
So long as oversight is undermined by current congressional rules and resolutions,
we believe the American people will not get the security they want and need. The
United States needs a strong, stable, and capable congressional committee structure
to give America’s national intelligence agencies oversight, support, and leadership.
Are we safer?
Since 9/11, the United States and its allies have killed or captured a majority of
al Qaeda’s leadership; toppled the Taliban, which gave al Qaeda sanctuary in Afghani-
stan; and severely damaged the organization. Yet terrorist attacks continue. Even as we
have thwarted attacks, nearly everyone expects they will come. How can this be? The
problem is that al Qaeda represents an ideological movement, not a ﬁnite group of
people. It initiates and inspires, even if it no longer directs. In this way it has trans-
formed itself into a decentralized force. Bin Ladin may be limited in his ability to
organize major attacks from his hideouts. Yet killing or capturing him, while extremely
important, would not end terror. His message of inspiration to a new generation of
terrorists would continue. Because of oﬀensive actions against al Qaeda since 9/11, and
defensive actions to improve homeland security, we believe we are safer today. But we
are not safe. We therefore make the following recommendations that we believe can
make America safer and more secure.
Recommendations
Three years after 9/11, the national debate continues about how to protect our nation
in this new era. We divide our recommendations into two basic parts: What to do, and
how to do it.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S

What to do? A global strategy
The enemy is not just ‘terrorism.’ It is the threat posed speciﬁcally by Islamist terror-
ism, by Bin Ladin and others who draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance
within a minority strain of Islam that does not distinguish politics from religion, and
distorts both. The enemy is not Islam, the great world faith, but a perversion of Islam.
The enemy goes beyond al Qaeda to include the radical ideological movement, inspired
in part by al Qaeda, that has spawned other terrorist groups and violence. Thus our
strategy must match our means to two ends: dismantling the al Qaeda network and, in
the long term, prevailing over the ideology that contributes to Islamist terrorism.
The ﬁrst phase of our post-9/11 eﬀorts rightly included military action to topple the
Taliban and pursue al Qaeda. This work continues. But long-term success demands the
use of all elements of national power: diplomacy, intelligence, covert action, law
enforcement, economic policy, foreign aid, public diplomacy, and homeland defense. If
we favor one tool while neglecting others, we leave ourselves vulnerable and weaken
our national eﬀort.
What should Americans expect from their government? The goal seems unlimited:
Defeat terrorism anywhere in the world. But Americans have also been told to expect
the worst: An attack is probably coming; it may be more devastating still.
Vague goals match an amorphous picture of the enemy. Al Qaeda and other groups
are popularly described as being all over the world, adaptable, resilient, needing little
higher-level organization, and capable of anything. It is an image of an omnipotent
hydra of destruction. That image lowers expectations of government eﬀectiveness.
It lowers them too far. Our report shows a determined and capable group of plot-
ters.Yet the group was fragile and occasionally left vulnerable by the marginal, unstable
people often attracted to such causes. The enemy made mistakes. The U.S. government
was not able to capitalize on them. No president can promise that a catastrophic attack
like that of 9/11 will not happen again. But the American people are entitled to expect
that oﬃcials will have realistic objectives, clear guidance, and eﬀective organization.
They are entitled to see standards for performance so they can judge, with the help
of their elected representatives, whether the objectives are being met. We propose a
strategy with three dimensions: (1) attack terrorists and their organizations, (2) prevent
the continued growth of Islamist terrorism, and (3) protect against and prepare for
terrorist attacks.
Attack terrorists and their organizations
•
Root out sanctuaries.The U.S. government should identify and prioritize actual or
potential terrorist sanctuaries and have realistic country or regional strategies for
each, utilizing every element of national power and reaching out to countries that
can help us.
•
Strengthen long-term U.S. and international commitments to the future of Pakistan
and Afghanistan.
•
Confront problems with Saudi Arabia in the open and build a relationship beyond
oil, a relationship that both sides can defend to their citizens and includes a shared
commitment to reform.

Prevent the continued growth of Islamist terrorism
In October 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked if enough was being
done ‘to fashion a broad integrated plan to stop the next generation of terrorists.’ As
part of such a plan, the U.S. government should
•
Deﬁne the message and stand as an example of moral leadership in the world. To
Muslim parents, terrorists like Bin Ladin have nothing to oﬀer their children but
visions of violence and death. America and its friends have the advantage—our
vision can oﬀer a better future.
•
Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not oﬀer opportunity,
respect the rule of law, or tolerate diﬀerences, then the United States needs to stand
for a better future.
•
Communicate and defend American ideals in the Islamic world, through much
stronger public diplomacy to reach more people, including students and leaders
outside of government. Our eﬀorts here should be as strong as they were in
combating closed societies during the Cold War.
•
Oﬀer an agenda of opportunity that includes support for public education and
economic openness.
•
Develop a comprehensive coalition strategy against Islamist terrorism, using a
ﬂexible contact group of leading coalition governments and fashioning a common
coalition approach on issues like the treatment of captured terrorists.
•
Devote a maximum eﬀort to the parallel task of countering the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.
•
Expect less from trying to dry up terrorist money and more from following the
money for intelligence, as a tool to hunt terrorists, understand their networks, and
disrupt their operations.
Protect against and prepare for terrorist attacks
•
Target terrorist travel, an intelligence and security strategy that the 9/11 story
showed could be at least as powerful as the eﬀort devoted to terrorist ﬁnance.
•
Address problems of screening people with biometric identiﬁers across agencies
and governments, including our border and transportation systems, by designing
a comprehensive screening system that addresses common problems and sets com-
mon standards. As standards spread, this necessary and ambitious eﬀort could
dramatically strengthen the world’s ability to intercept individuals who could pose
catastrophic threats.
•
Quickly complete a biometric entry-exit screening system, one that also speeds
qualiﬁed travelers.
•
Set standards for the issuance of birth certiﬁcates and sources of identiﬁcation,
such as driver’s licenses.
•
Develop strategies for neglected parts of our transportation security system. Since
9/11, about 90 percent of the nation’s $5 billion annual investment in transporta-
tion security has gone to aviation, to ﬁght the last war.
•
In aviation, prevent arguments about a new computerized proﬁling system from
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S
791
 

delaying vital improvements in the ‘no-ﬂy’ and ‘automatic selectee’ lists. Also, give
priority to the improvement of checkpoint screening.
•
Determine, with leadership from the President, guidelines for gathering and shar-
ing information in the new security systems that are needed, guidelines that inte-
grate safeguards for privacy and other essential liberties.
•
Underscore that as government power necessarily expands in certain ways, the
burden of retaining such powers remains on the executive to demonstrate the value
of such powers and ensure adequate supervision of how they are used, including a
new board to oversee the implementation of the guidelines needed for gathering
and sharing information in these new security systems.
•
Base federal funding for emergency preparedness solely on risks and vulnerabilities,
putting New York City and Washington, D.C., at the top of the current list. Such
assistance should not remain a program for general revenue sharing or pork-barrel
spending.
•
Make homeland security funding contingent on the adoption of an incident com-
mand system to strengthen teamwork in a crisis, including a regional approach.
Allocate more radio spectrum and improve connectivity for public safety com-
munications, and encourage widespread adoption of newly developed standards for
private-sector emergency preparedness—since the private sector controls 85 percent
of the nation’s critical infrastructure.
How to do it? A diﬀerent way of organizing government
The strategy we have recommended is elaborate, even as presented here very brieﬂy. To
implement it will require a government better organized than the one that exists today,
with its national security institutions designed half a century ago to win the Cold War.
Americans should not settle for incremental, ad hoc adjustments to a system created a
generation ago for a world that no longer exists.
Our detailed recommendations are designed to ﬁt together. Their purpose is clear: to
build unity of eﬀort across the U.S. government. As one oﬃcial now serving on the
front lines overseas put it to us: ‘One ﬁght, one team.’ We call for unity of eﬀort in ﬁve
areas, beginning with unity of eﬀort on the challenge of counterterrorism itself:
•
unifying strategic intelligence and operational planning against Islamist terrorists
across the foreign-domestic divide with a National Counterterrorism Center;
•
unifying the intelligence community with a new National Intelligence Director;
•
unifying the many participants in the counterterrorism eﬀort and their knowledge
in a network-based information sharing system that transcends traditional gov-
ernmental boundaries;
•
unifying and strengthening congressional oversight to improve quality and
accountability; and
•
strengthening the FBI and homeland defenders.
Unity of eﬀort: A national counterterrorism center
The 9/11 story teaches the value of integrating strategic intelligence from all sources into
joint operational planning—with both dimensions spanning the foreign-domestic divide.
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

•
In some ways, since 9/11, joint work has gotten better. The eﬀort of ﬁghting terror-
ism has ﬂooded over many of the usual agency boundaries because of its sheer
quantity and energy. Attitudes have changed. But the problems of coordination
have multiplied. The Defense Department alone has three uniﬁed commands
(SOCOM, CENTCOM, and NORTHCOM) that deal with terrorism as one of
their principal concerns.
•
Much of the public commentary about the 9/11 attacks has focused on ‘lost
opportunities.’ Though characterized as problems of ‘watchlisting,’ ‘information
sharing,’ or ‘connecting the dots,’ each of these labels is too narrow. They describe
the symptoms, not the disease.
•
Breaking the older mold of organization stovepiped purely in executive agencies,
we propose a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) that would borrow the
joint, uniﬁed command concept adopted in the 1980s by the American military in a
civilian agency, combining the joint intelligence function alongside the operations
work.
•
The NCTC would build on the existing Terrorist Threat Integration Center and
would replace it and other terrorism ‘fusion centers’ within the government. The
NCTC would become the authoritative knowledge bank, bringing information to
bear on common plans. It should task collection requirements both inside and
outside the United States.
•
The NCTC should perform joint operational planning, assigning lead responsi-
bilities to existing agencies and letting them direct the actual execution of the plans.
•
Placed in the Executive Oﬃce of the President, headed by a Senate conﬁrmed
oﬃcial (with rank equal to the deputy head of a cabinet department) who reports
to the National Intelligence Director, the NCTC would track implementation of
plans. It would be able to inﬂuence the leadership and the budgets of the counter-
terrorism operating arms of the CIA, the FBI, and the departments of Defense and
Homeland Security.
•
The NCTC should not be a policymaking body. Its operations and planning should
follow the policy direction of the president and the National Security Council.
Unity of eﬀort: A National Intelligence Director
Since long before 9/11—and continuing to this day—the intelligence community is not
organized well for joint intelligence work. It does not employ common standards and
practices in reporting intelligence or in training experts overseas and at home. The
expensive national capabilities for collecting intelligence have divided management.
The structures are too complex and too secret.
•
The community’s head—the Director of Central Intelligence—has at least three
jobs: running the CIA, coordinating a 15-agency confederation, and being the
intelligence analyst-in-chief to the president. No one person can do all these
things.
•
A new National Intelligence Director should be established with two main jobs: (1)
to oversee national intelligence centers that combine experts from all the collection
disciplines against common targets—like counterterrorism or nuclear proliferation;
and (2) to oversee the agencies that contribute to the national intelligence program,
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S
793
 

a task that includes setting common standards for personnel and information
technology.
•
The national intelligence centers would be the uniﬁed commands of the intelligence
world—a long-overdue reform for intelligence comparable to the 1986 Goldwater-
Nichols law that reformed the organization of national defense.The home services—
such as the CIA, DIA, NSA, and FBI—would organize, train, and equip the
best intelligence professionals in the world, and would handle the execution of
intelligence operations in the ﬁeld.
•
This National Intelligence Director (NID) should be located in the Executive Oﬃce
of the President and report directly to the president, yet be conﬁrmed by the
Senate. In addition to overseeing the National Counterterrorism Center described
above (which will include both the national intelligence center for terrorism and the
joint operations planning eﬀort), the NID should have three deputies:
•
For foreign intelligence (a deputy who also would be the head of the CIA)
•
For defense intelligence (also the under secretary of defense for intelligence)
•
For homeland intelligence (also the executive assistant director for intelli-
gence at the FBI or the under secretary of homeland security for information
analysis and infrastructure protection).
•
The NID should receive a public appropriation for national intelligence, should
have authority to hire and ﬁre his or her intelligence deputies, and should be able to
set common personnel and information technology policies across the intelligence
community.
•
The CIA should concentrate on strengthening the collection capabilities of its
clandestine service and the talents of its analysts, building pride in its core
expertise.
•
Secrecy stiﬂes oversight, accountability, and information sharing. Unfortunately,
all the current organizational incentives encourage overclassiﬁcation. This balance
should change; and as a start, open information should be provided about the
overall size of agency intelligence budgets.
Unity of eﬀort: Sharing information
The U.S. government has access to a vast amount of information. But it has a weak
system for processing and using what it has. The system of ‘need to know’ should be
replaced by a system of ‘need to share.’
•
The President should lead a government-wide eﬀort to bring the major national
security institutions into the information revolution, turning a mainframe system
into a decentralized network.The obstacles are not technological. Oﬃcial after
oﬃcial has urged us to call attention to problems with the unglamorous ‘back
oﬃce’ side of government operations.
•
But no agency can solve the problems on its own—to build the network requires an
eﬀort that transcends old divides, solving common legal and policy issues in ways
that can help oﬃcials know what they can and cannot do. Again, in tackling
information issues, America needs unity of eﬀort.

Unity of eﬀort: Congress
Congress took too little action to adjust itself or to restructure the executive branch to
address the emerging terrorist threat. Congressional oversight for intelligence—and
counterterrorism—is dysfunctional. Both Congress and the executive need to do more
to minimize national security risks during transitions between administrations.
•
For intelligence oversight,we propose two options: either a joint committee on the
old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy or a single committee in each
house combining authorizing and appropriating committees. Our central message
is the same: the intelligence committees cannot carry out their oversight function
unless they are made stronger, and thereby have both clear responsibility and
accountability for that oversight.
•
Congress should create a single, principal point of oversight and review for home-
land security.There should be one permanent standing committee for homeland
security in each chamber.
•
We propose reforms to speed up the nomination, ﬁnancial reporting, security
clearance, and conﬁrmation process for national security oﬃcials at the start of an
administration, and suggest steps to make sure that incoming administrations have
the information they need.
Unity of eﬀort: Organizing America’s defenses in the United States
We have considered several proposals relating to the future of the domestic intelligence
and counterterrorism mission. Adding a new domestic intelligence agency will not
solve America’s problems in collecting and analyzing intelligence within the United
States. We do not recommend creating one.
•
We propose the establishment of a specialized and integrated national security
workforce at the FBI, consisting of agents, analysts, linguists, and surveillance
specialists who are recruited, trained, rewarded, and retained to ensure the devel-
opment of an institutional culture imbued with a deep expertise in intelligence
and national security. At several points we asked: Who has the responsibility
for defending us at home? Responsibility for America’s national defense is shared
by the Department of Defense, with its new Northern Command, and by the
Department of Homeland Security. They must have a clear delineation of roles,
missions, and authority.
•
The Department of Defense and its oversight committees should regularly assess
the adequacy of Northern Command’s strategies and planning to defend against
military threats to the homeland.
•
The Department of Homeland Security and its oversight committees should
regularly assess the types of threats the country faces, in order to determine the
adequacy of the government’s plans and the readiness of the government to
respond to those threats.
We call on the American people to remember how we all felt on 9/11, to remember not
only the unspeakable horror but how we came together as a nation—one nation. Unity
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  S TAT E S
795
 

of purpose and unity of eﬀort are the way we will defeat this enemy and make America
safer for our children and grandchildren.
We look forward to a national debate on the merits of what we have recommended,
and we will participate vigorously in that debate.

ACTION BY THE UNITED
KINGDOM
1. Explanatory Notes on the Terrorism Act 2006
Explanatory notes
1.
These explanatory notes relate to the Terrorism Act 2006 which received Royal
Assent on 30 March 2006. They have been prepared by the Home Oﬃce to assist
the reader of the Act and to help inform debate on it. They do not form part of the
Act and have not been endorsed by Parliament.
2.
The notes need to be read in conjunction with the Act. They are not, and are
not meant to be, a comprehensive description of the Act. So where a section or
part of a section does not seem to require an explanation or comment, none is
given.
Summary
3.
The purpose of this Act is to reform and extend previous counter-terrorist legisla-
tion to ensure that the UK law enforcement agencies have the necessary powers to
counter the threat to the UK posed by terrorism. A number of these changes are
also required to implement diﬀerent international Conventions, which the UK is a
party to. The Act also amends previous legislation relating to investigatory powers
and the intelligence services.
4.
The measures in the Act include both those that were already envisaged prior to the
terrorist incidents in London on 7 July 2005 and 21 July 2005 and those that have
been included following those incidents.
5.
Previous counter-terrorism legislation provided a range of measures designed to
prevent terrorism and support the investigation of terrorist crime. These were
placed on a permanent footing in the Terrorism Act 2000 (c.11) (‘the TACT’).
These include a power for the Secretary of State to proscribe terrorist organisa-
tions, backed up by a series of oﬀences connected with such organisations; other
speciﬁc oﬀences connected with terrorism; and a range of police powers. Further
additions to counter-terrorism legislation were made in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime
and Security Act 2001 (c.24) (‘the ATCSA’) and the Prevention of Terrorism Act
2005 (c.2) (‘The PTA’).
6.
The Act creates a number of new oﬀences. These new oﬀences include the oﬀence
of encouragement of terrorism, an oﬀence relating to bookshops and other
797
 

disseminators of terrorist publications, an oﬀence of the preparation of terrorist
acts, and further terrorist training oﬀences. The Act also creates a number of
oﬀences relating to radioactive material or devices, and nuclear facilities, and
amends the penalty for certain oﬀences relating to nuclear material.
7. The Act alters the existing legislative framework by amending the TACT in a
number of ways. Firstly, the Act makes some changes to terrorist oﬀences (for
example raising the penalty for the oﬀence of possession for terrorist purposes).
Secondly, it extends powers currently available to the Secretary of State relating to
proscription, to allow for the proscription of groups which glorify terrorism or
the activities of which associate it with acts that glorify terrorism, and to deal
with proscribed organisations that change their names. The Act also extends police
and investigatory powers in relation to terrorism (such as allowing the extension
of detention of terrorist suspects with judicial approval for up to 28 days, and
enabling all premises search warrants to be issued).
8. With reference to the powers of the security and intelligence services, the Act also
amends the Intelligence Services Act 1994 (‘the ISA’) (c.13) with respect to
warrants to carry out acts both overseas and in the UK. It also amends the Regula-
tion of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (‘the RIPA’) (c.23) in a number of ways.
Firstly, it increases the penalties for refusal to obey a notice to provide an encryp-
tion key, as set out in Part 3 of that Act. Secondly, it amends investigatory powers,
extending the period that warrants for intercept (and related authorisations) under
that Act are issued for, and further delegating the authority to modify warrant
schedules.
9. Finally, the Act amends the deﬁnition of terrorism as contained in the TACT.
Overview
10. The Act’s Parts and Schedules are as follows.
11. Part 1 (Oﬀences) provides for new oﬀences, amendments to existing oﬀences, and
makes incidental provisions about terrorism oﬀences. Part 1 creates oﬀences relat-
ing to the encouragement of acts of terrorism, and to the dissemination of terrorist
publications. Part 1 makes speciﬁc provision about how these two new oﬀences are
to apply to those providing and using the internet and other electronic services. It
also creates oﬀences relating to the preparation of terrorist acts and terrorist train-
ing; the making, possession or use of radioactive devices and materials; the making
of terrorist threats relating to radioactive devices, materials, or nuclear facilities;
and trespass on nuclear sites. The Act increases penalties for possession for terrorist
purposes; oﬀences relating to nuclear material; and oﬀences relating to the contra-
vention of a notice relating to encrypted information. Part 1 also sets out new
procedures to be followed in the preparation of terrorist cases for trial. Schedule 1
sets out a list of ‘Convention oﬀences’ that are referred to in Part 1. These represent
the parallel oﬀences in UK law to those oﬀences mentioned in the Council of
Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.
12. Part 2 (Miscellaneous provisions) includes an amendment to the grounds on
which the Secretary of State is empowered to proscribe organisations, a process
through which a proscribed organisation may be identiﬁed by another name, and
amendments to police and investigatory powers. These changes aﬀect:

•
Powers to detain terrorist suspects under the TACT, and the grounds on which
such detention may be authorised. The provisions extending the maximum
length of time a person can be detained under Schedule 8 to the TACT from 14
to 28 days will have eﬀect for one year after their commencement but they can
be extended by order made by the Secretary of State for periods of up to a year
each
•
Powers to search premises, and seize material under Schedule 5 to the TACT
•
Powers to seize, and seek forfeiture of, terrorist publications
•
Powers to search at ports under Schedule 7 to the TACT, and to issue authori-
sations to stop and search under Section 44 of the TACT
•
Powers to issue authorisations or warrants to carry out acts under the ISA
•
Powers to issue, and amend the schedules of intercept warrants
•
Powers to seek disclosure notices under the Serious Organised Crime and
Police Act 2005
•
The deﬁnition of terrorism, as set out in the TACT
•
The process under which terrorist cash-seizure hearings are heard under the
TACT
13. Schedule 2 sets out the method by which forfeiture proceedings should be carried
out, following a seizure of terrorist publications.
14. Part 3 (Supplemental provisions) provides for the oversight of the operation
of Part 1 of the Act and the TACT through an independent annual review to
Parliament. It also includes a number of consequential amendments and repeals.
Territorial extent
15. The Act extends to the whole of the UK except the provisions in section 17 relating
to the use of explosives in a manner that does not relate to terrorism. These provi-
sions do not extend to Scotland (since oﬀences relating to the use of explosives
other than in relation to terrorism is a devolved matter).
Commentary
Deﬁnitions
16. The Act relies on a number of deﬁnitions that appear in the TACT. The deﬁnition
of terrorism appears in section 1 of the TACT. The deﬁnition covers the use or
threat of action that meets the three elements set out in section 1(1). The ﬁrst of the
elements is that the action must fall into section 1(2). An action falls in section 1(2)
if it involves serious violence against a person or serious damage to property; it
endangers a person’s life (but this does not include the life of the person commit-
ting the action); it creates a serious risk to the health and safety of the public or a
section of the public; or it is designed to seriously interfere with or seriously to
disrupt an electronic system. The second element is that the use or threat is either
designed to inﬂuence the government or is designed to intimidate the public or a
section of the public. Section 34 of the Act amends this element to include cases
where the use or threat is desgined to inﬂuence an international governmental
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
799
 

organisation. The second element does not have to be satisﬁed if the use or threat
falling into subsection (2) involves the use of ﬁrearms or explosives (section 1(3)).
Explosives and ﬁrearms are deﬁned in section 121 of the TACT. The third element
is that the threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or
ideological cause.
17. Section 1(4) of the TACT makes it clear that the deﬁnition of terrorism is not
limited to things taking place in the UK or related to things in the UK. Action is
deﬁned in section 1(4)(a) as including actions outside the UK. Section 1(4)(b)
provides that a reference in the deﬁnition to a person or property means a person or
property wherever he or it is situated. Section 1(4) (c) makes it clear that the public
can be the public of a country other than the UK. Section 1(4)(d) provides that the
reference to government is not limited to the central government of the UK but can
also mean a government of part of the UK (such as of Scotland) and a foreign
government.
18. Property is deﬁned in section 121 of the TACT as including property wherever
situated and whether real or personal, heritable or moveable, and things in action
and other intangible or incorporeal property.
19. The Act also makes use of the term acts (or act) of terrorism. Act and action are
both deﬁned in section 121 of the TACT as including an omission. Section 1(5)
makes it clear that, as well as including an act that falls under the deﬁnition in
section 1, an act is also for the purposes of terrorism if it is taken for the beneﬁt of
a proscribed organisation. Section 20(2) of the Act makes it clear that acts (or act)
of terrorism as used in the Act includes an act taken for the purposes of terrorism
and so includes an act taken for the beneﬁt of a proscribed organisation.
Section 1 – Encouragement of terrorism
20. Section 1 creates an oﬀence of encouragement of acts of terrorism or Convention
oﬀences. The oﬀence has been introduced to implement the requirements of Article 5
of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (‘the Con-
vention’). This requires State parties to have an oﬀence of ‘public provocation to
commit a terrorist oﬀence’. This new oﬀence supplements the existing common law
oﬀence of incitement to commit an oﬀence.
Subsection (1)
21. The oﬀence in section 1 is concerned with the publication of statements and subsec-
tion (1) sets out the type of statements to which it applies. These are statements
that are likely to be understood by some or all of the members of the public to
whom they are published as a direct or indirect encouragement or other induce-
ment to them to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism or
Convention oﬀences.
Subsection (2)
22. Subsection (2) sets out the conduct and mental element of the oﬀence. Article 5 of
the Convention requires parties to have an oﬀence of public provocation to commit
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
800
 
www.ebook3000.com

a terrorist oﬀence. Terrorist oﬀence is deﬁned in Article 1 of the Convention as any
oﬀence within the scope of, or deﬁned in, one of the treaties listed in the Appendix
to the Convention. The Appendix lists a number of treaties the oﬀences from which
have been translated into UK law through legislation, as a consequence the concept
of terrorist oﬀence in Article 5 (and Article 1) of the Convention becomes the
concept of Convention oﬀence in the Act. Convention oﬀences are set out in
Schedule 1 to the Act which consists of a list of the UK provisions implementing
the treaties listed in the Appendix to the Convention.
23. The new oﬀence is committed if a person publishes a statement (as deﬁned in
subsection (1)) or causes another to publish such a statement and he has the neces-
sary mens rea. The mens rea is that, at the time of publishing or causing to publish,
he either intends members of the public to be directly or indirectly encouraged or
otherwise induced, by the statement to commit, prepare or instigate acts of terror-
ism or Convention oﬀences, or he is reckless as to whether members of the public
will be so directly or indirectly encouraged by the statement. A number of def-
initions relating to this oﬀence, including the deﬁnition of act of terrorism, publish,
statement and public, are set out in section 20 of the Act. The eﬀect of those
deﬁnitions is set out in paragraphs 16–19 and 94 and 95 of these notes.
Subsection (3)
24. Subsection (3) provides that indirect encouragement of terrorism includes a
statement that gloriﬁes the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism or
Convention oﬀences but only if members of the public could reasonably be
expected to infer that what is being gloriﬁed in the statement is being gloriﬁed as
conduct that should be emulated by them in existing circumstances. Gloriﬁcation is
deﬁned in section 20(2) as including praise or celebration. Section 20(7) clariﬁes
that references to conduct that should be emulated in existing circumstances
includes references to conduct that is illustrative of a type of conduct that should
be so emulated. For example, if it was reasonable to expect members of the public
to infer from a statement glorifying the bomb attacks on the London Underground
on 7 July 2005 that what should be emulated is action causing severe disruption to
London’s transport network, this will be caught.
Subsection (4)
25. Subsection (4) speciﬁcally provides that when the questions of how a statement is
likely to be understood, and what members of the public might reasonably infer
from it, are determined, regard should be had to both the contents of the statement
as a whole, and the circumstances and manner of its publication.
Subsection (5)
26. Subsection (5) sets out that the statement, or how it is likely to be understood, need
not relate to a speciﬁc act of terrorism or Convention oﬀence. It also sets out that
an oﬀence is committed whether or not any person is actually encouraged or
induced to commit, prepare or instigate an act of terrorism or Convention oﬀence.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
801
 

It follows from this that it is not necessary in order for the oﬀence to be committed
for an act of terrorism or a Convention oﬀence actually to take place.
Subsection (6)
27. Subsection (6) sets out a defence to the oﬀence created by this section. It is a
defence for a person accused of the oﬀence, where it has not been proved that he
intended the statement to encourage or otherwise induce the commission, prepar-
ation, or instigation of acts of terrorism or Convention oﬀences, to show that the
statement published neither expressed his views, nor had his endorsement and that
it was clear in all the circumstances of the statement’s publication that it was not
his view and did not have his endorsement. The defence is intended, for example, to
cover news broadcasters. However, a person will not be able to take advantage of
this defence if he is deemed to endorse a statement because he has failed to comply
with a notice issued under section 3 (see paragraphs 39 to 45 of these notes).
Subsection (8)
28. Subsection (8) provides a transitional provision in respect of the period before the
commencement of section 154(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c.44). At the
moment a Magistrates’ Court can only give a penalty of up to six months’
imprisonment. Once section 154(1) is in force this will increase to 12 months’
imprisonment. Subsection (7), which sets out the penalties for the oﬀence, is
drafted as if section 154 is in force but as it is not in force a provision is needed to
make it clear that, until such time as it is in force, the Magistrates’ Court only has
its existing powers to give a penalty of imprisonment.
Section 2 – Dissemination of terrorist publications
29. Section 2 creates oﬀences relating to the sale and other dissemination of books and
other publications, including material on the internet, that encourage people to
engage in terrorism, or provide information that could be useful to terrorists.
Subsection (1)
30. Subsection (1) focuses on the mental element of the oﬀence. This is an oﬀence
which must be committed intentionally or recklessly. For an oﬀence to be commit-
ted, it is necessary for an individual to carry out any of the actions set out in
subsection (2), which outlines various methods of dissemination, and for him either
to have an intention that an eﬀect of his conduct will be a direct or indirect
encouragement or other inducement to terrorism, an intention that an eﬀect of his
conduct will be the provision of assistance in the commission or preparation of
acts of terrorism, or for him to be reckless as to whether his conduct has one of
these two speciﬁed eﬀects.

Subsection (2)
31. Subsection (2) provides the conduct that will amount to an oﬀence under section 2.
The conduct is: distributing or circulating a terrorist publication; giving, selling, or
lending a terrorist publication; oﬀering a terrorist publication for sale or loan;
providing a service to others that enables them to obtain, read, listen to or look at
such a publication, or to acquire it by means of gift, sale, or loan; transmitting the
contents of a terrorist publication electronically; and possessing a terrorist publica-
tion with a view to making it available in any of the ways listed. This means that the
oﬀence will cover not only bookshops but also those that sell books and publica-
tions over the internet whether the publication is in hard copy or electronic. It will
also cover libraries and the distribution of leaﬂets and ﬂyers.
Subsection (3)
32. Subsection (3) sets out the deﬁnition of terrorist publication. A publication will be
considered a terrorist publication if it meets one of two tests. The ﬁrst test is if
matter contained in it is likely to be understood by some or all of the persons to
whom it is or may become available as a consequence of the conduct in subsection
(2) as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission,
preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The second test is if it contains any
matter which is likely to be useful in the commission or preparation of such acts and
it is likely to be understood by some or all of the persons to whom it is or may
become available as being contained in the publication, or made available to them,
wholly or mainly for the purposes of being so useful to them. The ﬁrst reason for a
book or other publication being a terrorist publication relates to the new oﬀence
under section 1. In either case, only a small part of a publication needs to satisfy the
test for the publication to be a terrorist publication. As the whole publication will be
a terrorist publication if a small part of it satisﬁes the test this means that the whole
publication can be seized under the powers set out in section 28 and Schedule 2
(which provide for search, seizure and forfeiture of terrorist publications). However,
in relation to the defence in subsection (9) of section 2, in order to establish part (a)
of the defence, the defendant need only show that the part of a publication which
satisﬁes the test did not express his views or have his endorsement.
Subsections (4) and (5)
33. Subsection (4) sets out that, as in section 1, indirect encouragement of terrorism
includes gloriﬁcation of terrorism, so long as the person who understands the
statement to be indirect encouragement could reasonably be expected to infer
that the conduct that is gloriﬁed is gloriﬁed as conduct that should be emulated by
him in existing circumstances. Subsection (5) provides that whether or not a publi-
cation is a terrorist publication must be determined at the time of the particular
conduct in question, and having regard to the content of the publication as a
whole and the circumstances in which the particular conduct occurred. This means
that account can be taken of the nature of the bookseller or other disseminator of
the publication.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
803
 

Subsection (6)
34. Subsection (6) sets out that references to an eﬀect of a person’s conduct in relation
to a terrorist publication includes references to an eﬀect of the publication on
one or more of the persons to whom it is or may become available as a consequence
of that conduct. This means that the eﬀect of a person holding a publication
intending to disseminate it (for example, by oﬀering it for sale) will include the
eﬀect on the audience to whom it is intended it will be made available by a later
act of dissemination (i.e. the sale itself). This is intended to cover the fact that if
a person only, for example, holds a publication with the intention of disseminating
it, the eﬀect of that conduct is not to encourage terrorism or to be useful to
terrorists, because only once the publication is disseminated can it have one of
those eﬀects.
Subsections (7) and (8)
35. Subsection (7) provides that a terrorist publication need not encourage or induce, or
be useful for, the commission, preparation, or instigation of a speciﬁc act of terror-
ism, but may instead be an encouragement or inducement for, or be useful for, acts
of terrorism in general. Subsection (8) provides that whether or not an individual
actually is encouraged or induced to commit, prepare, or instigate terrorist acts, or
makes use of the publication in the commission or preparation of such acts, is
irrelevant to the question of whether or not an oﬀence has been committed.
Subsections (9) and (10)
36. Subsection (9) provides a defence to the oﬀence in section 2. The defence is only
available if it has not been proved that the defendant engaged in conduct with the
intention that his conduct would encourage terrorism and if the publications in
question are terrorist publications by virtue of containing material that encourages
terrorism, not ones that are useful for the purposes of terrorism (subsection (10)).
The defendant can take advantage of the defence if he can show that the material
that encourages terrorism did not express his views or have his endorsement and it
was clear in all the circumstances that it did not express his views or have his
endorsement. A defendant will not be able to rely on the defence in subsection (9) if
he is deemed to have endorsed the terrorist material in a publication because he has
failed to comply with a notice issued under section 3 (see paragraphs 39 to 45 of
these notes).
Subsection (12)
37. Subsection (12) provides a transitional provision in respect of the period before the
commencement of section 154(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. At the moment
a Magistrates’ Court can only give a penalty of up to six months’ imprisonment.
Once section 154(1) is in force this will increase to 12 months’ imprisonment.
Subsection (11), which sets out the penalties for the oﬀence, is drafted as if section
154 is in force but as it is not in force a provision is needed to make it clear that,
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
804
 
www.ebook3000.com

until such time as it is in force, the Magistrates’ Court only has its existing powers
to give a penalty of imprisonment.
Subsection (13)
38. Subsection (13) deﬁnes publication for the purposes of section 2 as an article or
record of any description which contains matter to be read, matter to be listened to,
or matter to be looked at or watched. This means that as well as covering books the
section will also cover, amongst other things, ﬁlms and videos (with or without
sound), cassette tapes, electronic books, material contained on CD-ROMs and
photographs. This deﬁnition of publication is diﬀerent from that provided for
in section 20 of the Act. Article and record are deﬁned in section 20(2) and (8).
Article includes anything for storing data such as a CD-ROM. Record means
anything that is not an article, including a temporary electronic record that only
exists for the purpose of, and during the transmission of, its contents. Under
section 20(8) if there is a reference to what is contained in an article or record
this includes anything embodied or stored on or in it and anything that may be
reproduced from it.
Section 3 – Application of sections 1 and 2 to internet activity etc.
39. Under sections 1 and 2 a person has a defence to the oﬀences in those sections if he
can show amongst other things that a statement or publication did not express his
views and did not have his endorsement (see sections 1(6) and 2(9)). The eﬀect of
section 3 is to deem a person providing or using an electronic service to have
endorsed a statement if he has received a notice under section 3 and he has failed to
comply with it. If the person is accused of an oﬀence under section 1 or 2 then the
eﬀect of section 3 is that he cannot take advantage of the defence in sections 1(6),
or 2(9) respectively.
40. Section 3 contains a number of references to ‘publishing’, ‘records’, ‘article’ and
‘statement’, the deﬁnitions of which are contained in section 20 (Interpretation of
Part 1).
Subsection (1)
41. Subsection (1) applies the section to services provided electronically. Subsection
(1)(a) relates to statements that are published under section 1. Subsection (1)(b)
relates to conduct that amounts to an oﬀence under section 2. In both cases the
publishing or conduct that amounts to the oﬀence must occur in the course of, or in
connection with the provision or use of an electronic service.
Subsection (2)
42. Subsection (2) provides that any statement or conduct in question is regarded as
having the endorsement of a person if he has been given a notice under subsection
(3), two working days or more have elapsed since the notice was given, and the
relevant person has failed without a reasonable excuse to comply with the notice.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
805
 

The ﬁnal part of this test speciﬁcally provides that if a person has a good reason for
not complying with the notice he will not be caught by section 3.
Subsection (3)
43. Subsection (3) relates to the form of a notice under section 3. A notice can only be
given by a constable and that constable must have formed the opinion that the
statement, article or record concerned is unlawfully terrorism-related. Those things
are unlawfully terrorism-related if they are likely to be understood as a direct or
indirect encouragement or other inducement to acts of terrorism, or Convention
oﬀences, by any one or more of the persons to whom it is or may become available;
or if the article or record contains information that is likely to be useful to any one
or more of those persons in the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism,
and is in a form or context as may be likely to be understood by those persons as
being wholly or mainly for such a purpose (subsection (7)). As in sections 1 and 2,
subsection (8) provides that indirect encouragement of terrorism includes gloriﬁca-
tion of terrorism, but only if it can be understood as a suggestion that what is being
gloriﬁed is gloriﬁed as conduct to be emulated in existing circumstances.
44. A notice issued under this section must declare that the statement, article, or record
in question is unlawfully terrorism-related in the opinion of the constable. The
notice must require the relevant person (for example, a webmaster) to ensure that
the statement, article or record is removed from public view or amended to ensure
that it is no longer unlawfully terrorism-related. The notice must warn the person
that he has two working days to comply with the notice, and that failure to do so
will lead to that person being regarded as having endorsed the statement, article or
record. Working day is deﬁned in subsection (9) as any day that is not a Saturday, a
Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday or a bank holiday within the meaning of the
Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 (c. 80) in any part of the UK. This ﬁnal
part of the deﬁnition means that a bank holiday in any part of the UK will not
be a working day for the purposes of the provisions in any part of the UK. The
notice must also explain how the relevant person may be liable if the statement,
article or record becomes available to the public again, following compliance with
the notice. This ﬁnal element relates to repeat statements which are covered in
subsections (4) to (6).
Subsections (4) to (6)
45. Subsections (4), (5) and (6) deal with the situation in which a person is given a
notice, he takes down the oﬀending statement and then another statement that is
the same or very similar is posted again. These are referred to as repeat statements.
In such a situation it may be diﬃcult to tell if the statement is the statement to
which the notice relates or a new one. A mechanism is needed to ensure that a
person is only liable for statements that he knows about. Subsection (4) provides
that the person against whom the notice was issued will be regarded as having
endorsed repeat statements but this is subject to subsections (5) and (6). Subsec-
tions (5) and (6) provide that a person is not deemed to endorse a repeat statement
if he has taken every reasonable step to prevent repeat statements becoming
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
806
 
www.ebook3000.com

available to the public, and he has taken every reasonable step to ascertain if a
repeat statement is available to the public; and he is not aware that the repeat
statement had been published or he was aware that it had been published but he has
taken every reasonable step to ensure it is removed or modiﬁed.
Section 4 – Giving of notices under s.3
46. This section sets out the procedure for the giving of notices under section 3.
Subsection (1)
47. Subsection (1) sets out that, other than in the cases dealt with by subsections (2) to
(4) of section 4, a notice may be given to a person only by delivering it to him in
person, or by sending it, by means of recorded delivery, to him at his last known
address.
Subsections (2) to (4)
48. Subsection (2) sets out the manner of giving a notice to a body corporate. Sub-
section (3) sets out the manner of giving a notice to a ﬁrm. Subsection (4) sets out
the manner of giving a notice to an unincorporated body or association.
Subsection (7)
49. Subsection (7) sets out that the time that a notice is given will be taken as the time
of delivery of that notice, if given in person, or the time recorded as the time of
delivery, if sent by post. This provides the time that is relevant for the purposes of
section 3(2)(b).
Section 5 – Preparation of terrorist acts
50. Section 5 creates an oﬀence of the preparation of terrorist acts. This oﬀence adds
to existing common law oﬀences of conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts, and
attempting to carry out such acts. At the moment the law does not cover prepara-
tory acts: the oﬀence of attempt provides that the acts done must be more than
merely preparatory and the oﬀence of conspiracy provides that an agreement to
commit an oﬀence must have occurred. In addition both oﬀences require that a
speciﬁc oﬀence is attempted or planned rather than just a general intention to carry
out acts that amount to terrorism. Under the new oﬀence created by this section
acts of preparation with the relevant intention will be caught, for example if a
person possesses items that could be used for terrorism even if not immediately and
that person has the necessary intention he will be caught by the oﬀence.
Subsections (1) and (2)
51. Subsection (1) creates an oﬀence of preparing to commit or assist others to commit
one or more acts of terrorism with the intent of committing or assisting others to
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
807
 

commit such acts. Subsection (2) states that this is an oﬀence whether or not there
are speciﬁc plans, or solely an intention to carry out such acts generally.
Section 6 – Training for terrorism
52. This section implements Article 7 of the Convention. Article 7.2 requires parties to
create an oﬀence of training for terrorism. Training for terrorism is deﬁned in
Article 7.1. Article 7 is already partially implemented by section 54 of the TACT,
this new oﬀence covers matters that are not already dealt with by section 54.
Section 54 relates to training in the use or making of ﬁrearms, explosives and
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Convention oﬀences as referred to in
this section are set out in Schedule 1 to the Act.
Subsections (1) and (2)
53. These subsections create a new oﬀence of giving or receiving training in certain
skills, as deﬁned in subsection (3). Subsection (1) provides that in respect of giving
training, an oﬀence is committed if the person giving it knows that the person
receiving training intends to use the skills he acquires for, or in connection with, the
commission or preparation of acts of terrorism or Convention oﬀences, or assist-
ing others in the commission or preparation of such acts or oﬀences. Subsection (2)
provides that in respect of receiving training an oﬀence is committed if a person
receives instruction in one of a number of skills listed in subsection (3) and, at the
time of the training, he intends to use the skills acquired for, or in connection with,
the commission or preparation of acts of terrorism or Convention oﬀences, or
assisting others in the commission or preparation of such acts or oﬀences.
Subsection (3)
54. Subsection (3) deﬁnes the skills in which it is an oﬀence to give or receive training
under this section. The skills are split into three categories, the ﬁrst is deﬁned as the
making, handling, or use of a hazardous or noxious substance. An example of this
would be how to make a bomb to disperse a virus. The second is deﬁned as the use
of any method or technique for the doing of anything, other than things falling
into the ﬁrst category, that is capable of being done for the purposes of terrorism,
or in connection with the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism or
Convention oﬀence, or with assisting the commission or preparation of such acts.
An example of this would be a technique for causing a stampede in a crowd. The
third is deﬁned as the design or adaptation, for the purposes of terrorism, or in
connection with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism
or Convention oﬀence, of any method or technique for doing anything. An
example of this third category would be giving instructions about the places where
a bomb would cause maximum disruption.

www.ebook3000.com

Subsection (4)
55. Subsection (4) provides that for the purposes of this section it does not matter how
many people training is provided to. It also sets out that the person receiving
training need not intend to commit speciﬁc acts of terrorism or Convention
oﬀences, rather than such acts or oﬀences in general, and that he does not need to
be intending to provide assistance to a speciﬁc person, rather than persons whose
identities are not yet known, in the commission of any such act or oﬀence.
Subsection (6)
56. Subsection (6) provides a transitional provision in respect of the period before the
commencement of section 154(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. At the moment
a Magistrates’ Court can only give a penalty of up to six months’ imprisonment.
Once section 154(1) is in force this will increase to 12 months’ imprisonment.
Subsection (5), which sets out the penalties for the oﬀence, is drafted as if section
154 is in force but as it is not in force a provision is needed to make it clear that,
until such time as it is in force, the Magistrates’ Court only has its existing powers
to give a penalty of imprisonment.
Subsection (7)
57. Subsection (7) deﬁnes ‘noxious substance’, and ‘substance’, for the purpose of the
oﬀence of terrorist training. The deﬁnition of noxious substance includes the deﬁn-
ition of dangerous substance in Part 7 of the ATCSA. The deﬁnition of dangerous
substance is included in section 58 of that Act. Section 58 gives eﬀect to Schedule 5
of the ATCSA, which lists a number of pathogens and toxins. A dangerous sub-
stance means anything which consists of or includes a substance listed in Schedule 5
or anything which is infected or otherwise carries any such substance.
Section 7 – Powers of forfeiture in respect of oﬀences under s.6
58. This section provides for powers of forfeiture in respect of items considered by the
court to be connected with the carrying out of an oﬀence under section 6. This
could, for example, include various noxious substances and equipment designed for
the handling, and production, of such substances. Subsection (1) gives a power to
the court to order the forfeiture, on conviction of any individual for an oﬀence
under section 6, of any items the court considers to have been in the possession of
the person convicted for purposes connected with the oﬀence. Subsection (2) sets
out that before such an order can be made, the court must give any person, in
addition to the person convicted, a chance to be heard if they claim that they are
the owner of the items. Subsection (3) ensures that an order of this kind can only
come into force once there is no further possibility of the order being varied or set
aside on appeal. Subsections (4) and (5) provide that the court may, in the case of an
order for forfeiture being made under subsection (1), make any other provision it
sees as necessary to give eﬀect to the forfeiture, including provision about retention,
handling, destruction and other disposal of what is forfeited.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
809
 

Section 8 – Attendance at a place used for terrorist training
59. Section 8 creates a new oﬀence of attending a place used for terrorist training.
This adds to oﬀences relating to terrorist training contained in Section 54 of the
TACT, and section 6 of this Act. The oﬀence will apply whether the place is inside
the United Kingdom, or abroad. Although section 8 refers to Convention oﬀences
(as deﬁned in Schedule 1) it does not implement a provision in the Convention.
Subsections (1) to (3)
60. Subsection (1) creates an oﬀence of attending any place in the UK or abroad at
which terrorist training is taking place. Terrorist training for these purposes is
deﬁned by reference to the kind of training that may be given under the oﬀence in
section 6(1) of this Act, and those oﬀences in section 54(1) of the TACT (which
relates to weapons training). For an oﬀence to have been committed, all or part of
the training in such a place would need to have been provided for purposes con-
nected with terrorism or Convention oﬀences. It is also an element of the oﬀence
that the oﬀender either knows or believes that training for those purposes is taking
place or that a person attending the place throughout the period of that person’s
attendance could not have reasonably failed to understand this (subsection (2)).
Subsection (3) provides that the person concerned need not have received training
himself in order for the oﬀence to have been committed. It also sets out that the
oﬀence occurs whether the training is for a speciﬁc act of terrorism or Convention
oﬀence, or such acts or oﬀences in general.
Subsection (5)
61. Subsection (5) provides a transitional provision in respect of the period before
the commencement of section 154(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. At the
moment a Magistrates’ Court can only give a penalty of up to six months’
imprisonment. Once section 154(1) is in force this will increase to 12 months’
imprisonment. Subsection (4), which sets out the penalties for the oﬀence, is
drafted as if section 154 is in force but as it is not in force a provision is needed to
make it clear that, until such time as it is in force, the Magistrates’ Court only has
its existing powers to give a penalty of imprisonment.
Section 9 – Making and possession of devices or materials
62. The oﬀences in section 9, section 10 and section 11 are needed in order for the UK
to ratify the UN Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism,
which the UK signed in September 2005. The new oﬀences which this section and
sections 10 and 11 create relate in particular to the use, possession and making of
radioactive devices, particularly radioactive material dispersal devices and radi-
ation emitting devices, and use and possession, or the threat of use or possession,
of radioactive materials or nuclear facilities for terrorist purposes.
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
810
 
www.ebook3000.com

Subsections (1) and (2)
63. Subsection (1) of section 9 makes it an oﬀence to make or possess a radioactive
device or to possess radioactive material with the intention of using the device or
material in the course of, or in connection with, the commission or preparation of
an act of terrorism, or for the purposes of terrorism. It is also an oﬀence if the
intention is to make the device or material available to be used in such a way.
Subsection (2) sets out that for the purposes of the oﬀence being committed, it does
not matter whether an intention relates to a speciﬁc act of terrorism, or acts of
terrorism in general.
Subsection (4) and (5)
64. The deﬁnitions in subsections (4) and (5) and other deﬁnitions in sections 10 and 11
are based on Article 1 of the UN Convention that these sections are intended to
implement. ‘Radioactive device’ is deﬁned in subsection (4) as either a nuclear
weapon or nuclear explosive device; a radioactive material dispersal device; or any
other radiation emitting device. This deﬁnition can include (under ‘radioactive
material dispersal device’) a ‘dirty bomb’ in which an explosive causes radioactive
material to disperse, with the eﬀect that the radiation causes danger.
65. Subsection (4) deﬁnes ‘radioactive material’ as nuclear material, or any other
radioactive substance which contains nuclides that undergo spontaneous disinte-
gration in a process accompanied by the emission of one or more types of ionising
radiation and, due to its radiological or ﬁssile properties, it is capable of causing
serious bodily injury or damage to property, endangering life or creating a serious
risk to public health and safety. Nuclear material is deﬁned in subsection (5) as
having the same meaning as in the Nuclear Material (Oﬀences) Act 1983 (c.18).
Section 6 of that Act deﬁnes such material as nuclear material, within the meaning
of the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which is used for
peaceful purposes. The deﬁnition of nuclear material in Article 1(A) and (B) of
that Convention is set out in the Schedule to the 1983 Act. It covers particular types
of plutonium and uranium, such as uranium-233 and any material containing such
uranium or plutonium. ‘Device’ is deﬁned in subsection (5) to include machinery,
equipment, appliances, tanks, containers, pipes and conduits, whether or not these
are ﬁxed to the land.
Section 10 – Misuse of devices or material and misuse and damage
of facilities
Subsections (1) and (2)
66. Subsection (1) creates an oﬀence of using radioactive material or a radioactive
device in the course of or in connection with the commission of an act of terrorism
or for the purposes of terrorism. Subsection (2) creates a similar oﬀence of using or
damaging a nuclear facility in a manner that releases radioactive material or creates
or increases the risk that such material will be released, in the course of or in
connection with the commission of an act of terrorism or for the purposes of
terrorism.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
811
 

Subsections (4) and (5)
67. Subsections (4) and (5) are deﬁnitions provisions. Nuclear facility means a nuclear
reactor, including a reactor installed in or on a transportation device, or a plant or
conveyance being used for the production, storage, processing or transport of
radioactive material. Nuclear reactor and transportation device are both deﬁned in
subsection (5). Nuclear reactor is deﬁned by reference to the Nuclear Installations
Act 1965 (c.57). Section 26 of that Act provides that the term means any plant
designed or adapted for the production of atomic energy by a ﬁssion process in
which a controlled chain reaction can be maintained without an additional source
of neutrons.
Transportation device means any vehicle or any space object. Vehicle is deﬁned in
section 121 of the TACT as including aircraft, hovercraft, train or vessel. Space
object is deﬁned by reference to the Outer Space Act 1986 (c.38). The deﬁnition of
space object appears in section 13(1) of that Act and is deﬁned to include not only
the object itself, but also its component parts, its launch vehicle and the component
parts of that vehicle.
Section 11 – Terrorist threats relating to devices, materials or facilities
Subsection (1)
68. Subsection (1) makes it an oﬀence in the course of or in connection with the
commission of an act of terrorism, or for the purposes of terrorism, to demand the
supply of a radioactive device or of radioactive material, or that a nuclear facility
or access to a nuclear facility is made available, if this demand is supported with a
threat to take action if the demand is not met. The oﬀence only takes place if the
threat is credible, in that the circumstances and manner of the threat are such that it
is reasonable for the person to whom it is made to assume there is a real risk of the
threat being carried out if the demand is not met.
Subsection (2)
69. Subsection (2) makes it an oﬀence to make one of a number of threats, listed in
subsection (3), in the course of or in connection with the commission of an act of
terrorism, or for the purposes of terrorism. Again it is an element of the oﬀence
that the circumstances and manner of the threat are such that it is reasonable for
the person to whom it is made to assume there is a real risk of the threat being
carried out if the demand is not met.
Subsection (3)
70. Subsection (3) provides those threats which it will be an oﬀence to make under
subsection (2). It will be an oﬀence to make a threat to use radioactive material;
to use a radioactive device; or to use or damage a nuclear facility in a manner
that releases radioactive material, or creates or increases a risk that such material
will be released.

Section 12 – Trespassing etc. on nuclear sites
71. This section amends sections 128 and 129 of the Serious Organised Crime and
Police Act 2005 (‘the SOCAP’) to extend those sections to include nuclear sites.
Section 128 covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland and section 129 covers
Scotland. They make it an oﬀence to enter or to be on a designated site as
a trespasser. The maximum penalty for the oﬀence under these provisions is, in
England and Wales, 51 weeks’ imprisonment, a ﬁne up to level 5 on the standard
scale, or both, in Scotland, 12 months’ imprisonment, a ﬁne up to level 5 on the
standard scale, or both and in Northern Ireland, six months’ imprisonment, a ﬁne
up to level 5 on the standard scale or both. The reference to 51 weeks in relation to
England and Wales is subject to a transitional provision as set out in section 175(3)
of the SOCAP, which provides that, in relation to oﬀences committed before the
commencement of section 281(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the reference to
51 weeks is to be read as a reference to six months.
Subsection (2)
72. Subsection (2) amends sections 128 and 129 of SOCAP to refer to protected site
rather than designated site.
Subsection (3)
73. Subsection (3) amends section 128 of the SOCAP so that it applies to protected
sites. A protected site is either a designated site (the type of site that section 128
already applied to) or a nuclear site. A nuclear site is deﬁned within section 128 (as
amended) and as a consequence there is no need for the Secretary of State to make
an order deﬁning a nuclear site as there is with a designated site. A nuclear site is
deﬁned, in new subsection (1B) of section 128, as so much of any premises for
which a nuclear site licence is in force as lies within the outer perimeter fence, wall
or other obstacle securing the protection of the site, plus any other permises falling
within this outer perimeter fence etc. This is to make clear that in cases where there
are diﬀerences between the alignment of the outer perimeter fence etc. and the area
of the licensed site, it is an oﬀence to be inside the outer perimeter fence etc.
Conversely, where there is land that is part of a licensed nuclear site, but which falls
outside the outer perimeter fence etc., it is not an oﬀence to be on this land. The
powers of a constable to arrest a person suspected of committing the oﬀence in
section 130 of the SOCAP apply.
Subsection (4)
74. Subsection (4) amends section 129 of the SOCAP in the same manner as section 128.

Section 13 – Maximum penalty for possessing for terrorist purposes
Subsection (1) and (2)
75. Subsection (1) increases the maximum sentence for the existing oﬀence of possess-
ing an item in circumstances that may give rise to a reasonable suspicion that it is
possessed for a purpose connected to the commission, preparation or instigation of
an act of terrorism. This amends section 57(4)(a) of the TACT. The maximum
penalty is increased from 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment. Subsection (2) makes it
clear that this is not a retrospective amendment, and that oﬀences committed before
this section comes into force will only attract the maximum penalty of 10 years’
imprisonment.
Section 14 – Maximum penalty for certain oﬀences relating to
nuclear material
76. Section 14 increases the maximum sentence for the existing oﬀences involving pre-
paratory acts and threats set out in section 2 of the Nuclear Material (Oﬀences)
Act 1983. That section creates oﬀences relating to receiving, holding or dealing
with nuclear material, or making threats in relation to nuclear material, with intent
to commit certain oﬀences or enabling others to commit those oﬀences. These
include, among other oﬀences, those of murder, manslaughter, culpable homicide,
assault to injury, malicious mischief or causing injury, certain oﬀences against the
person, theft, or extortion. The previous maximum penalty was fourteen years’
imprisonment, or (if lower) the maximum sentence for the carrying out of such
acts. Subsection (1) sets out the new maximum penalty for these oﬀences, which on
conviction on indictment, will be imprisonment for life. Subsection (2) makes it
clear that this is not a retrospective amendment, and that oﬀences committed
before this section comes into force will not invite the higher penalty.
Section 15 – Maximum penalty for contravening notice relating to
encrypted information
77. Section 15 amends section 53 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
Part 3 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 provides a power to
enable properly authorised persons (such as members of the law enforcement,
security and intelligence agencies) to serve notices on persons requiring the dis-
closure of protected (e.g. encrypted) information in an intelligible form. Section 53
sets out the penalties for failing to make the disclosure required by the notice.
Subsection (1) increases the maximum penalty for conviction on indictment of
contravening a notice issued on national security grounds from two to ﬁve years’
imprisonment.
Section 16 – Preparatory hearings in terrorism cases
78. Under section 29 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (c.25)
(‘the CPIA’) a judge has power to order a preparatory hearing in cases of such
seriousness or complexity that substantial beneﬁts are likely to accrue from such a
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
814
 
www.ebook3000.com

hearing. A similar power to order preparatory hearings in cases of serious or
complex fraud is in section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987. The purpose of a
preparatory hearing is to identify the material issues, assist the jury’s comprehen-
sion of those issues, expedite the proceedings before a jury, deal with questions of
severance and joinder, and otherwise assist the trial judge’s management of the
case. Section 16 amends the CPIA to make preparatory hearings mandatory in
terrorism cases.
Subsection (2)
79. Section 29(1) of the CPIA provides a power to order a preparatory hearing in
cases of suitable complexity, seriousness or which are likely to have a long trial
if holding a hearing for a particular purpose, such as assisting the judge in the
management of the trial, would result in substantial beneﬁt. Section 29(1A) pro-
vides a power to hold a preparatory hearing in a case in which the trial may
proceed without a jury under section 45 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (this
provision is yet to be commenced). Section 16 of the Act amends section 29 of the
CPIA to place an obligation on the judge to order a preparatory hearing in two
particular circumstances concerning terrorism. The ﬁrst, set out in new subsection
(1B), is where at least one person in the case is charged with a terrorism oﬀence.
The second, set out in new subsection (1C), is where at least one person in the case
is charged with an oﬀence that carries a penalty of a maximum of at least 10 years’
imprisonment and it appears to the judge that the conduct in respect of that
oﬀence has a terrorist connection.
Subsections (3) to (5)
80. Subsection (3) inserts a new subsection (3) into the CPIA that deals with when the
respective provisions on preparatory hearings in the CPIA and the Criminal
Justice Act 1987 should apply. It provides that in a case of serious or complex
fraud a judge should ﬁrst decide whether to order a preparatory hearing under
the 1987 Act. If he decides not to he cannot order a preparatory hearing under the
CPIA, unless a preparatory hearing would be mandatory under new subsections
(1B) or (1C).
81. Subsection (5) inserts new subsections into section 29 of the CPIA to deﬁne terms
introduced by this section. The new subsection 29(6) of the CPIA deﬁnes ‘terror-
ism oﬀence’. The deﬁnition includes certain speciﬁed oﬀences in the TACT and
this Act, and the oﬀences of conspiracy or attempting to carry out such an
oﬀence, or incitement to commit such an oﬀence. New subsection 29(7) CPIA
provides that an oﬀence will be considered to carry a penalty of 10 years or more
if the maximum penalty for conviction on indictment is 10 years or more or life
imprisonment. New subsection 29(8) of the CPIA deﬁnes terrorist connection
for the purposes of the new provisions and new subsection 29(9) of the CPIA
provides that terrorism in the new provisions has the same meaning as in section 1
of the TACT.

Section 17 – Commission of oﬀences abroad
82. Subsections (1) to (4) of section 17 make provision in relation to extra-territorial
jurisdiction for the UK courts for the new oﬀences contained in sections 1, 6, and 8
to 11 of this Act, and two oﬀences in the TACT. Sections 1 and 6 are only covered
by this section in as much as they relate to Convention oﬀences as opposed to
acts of terrorism. The overall eﬀect of the section is that if, for example, an indi-
vidual were to commit one of these oﬀences in a foreign country, they would
be liable under UK law in the same way as if they had committed the oﬀence in
the UK.
83. The extra-territorial jurisdiction in section 17 is needed in order to give eﬀect to
Article 14 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism
(as respects the oﬀences in sections 1 and 6) and Article 9 of the International
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (as respects the
oﬀences in sections 9 to 11). Article 14.1 of the Council of Europe Convention on
the Prevention of Terrorism requires State Parties to take jurisdiction in respect of
oﬀences committed anywhere by nationals of that State. In addition, Article 14.3
requires State Parties to take jurisdiction in respect of anyone present in their
territory if they do not extradite that person to the state where the oﬀence was
committed. Paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 9 of the Nuclear Convention set out the
same requirements. Extra-territorial jurisdiction is appropriate for the oﬀence in
section 8 because the places at which terrorist training is taking place are more
likely to be located abroad rather than in the UK.
Subsections (1) to (3)
84. Subsection (2) provides that this section applies to a number of oﬀences. Firstly,
it applies to the oﬀences created by sections 1 and 6 of this Act, so far as those
oﬀences are committed in relation to any statement, instruction or training in
relation to which those sections have eﬀect by reason of their relevance to the
commission, preparation, or instigation of one or more Convention oﬀences. Sec-
ondly, it applies to all the new oﬀences outlined in sections 8 to 11 of this Act.
Thirdly, it applies to an oﬀence under section 11(1) of the TACT (membership of
proscribed organisations) and section 54 of that Act (weapons training). Fourthly,
it applies to oﬀences of conspiracy, incitement and attempt in respect of the
speciﬁc listed oﬀences.
85. Under subsection (1) if a person does anything outside the UK and, if he had acted
in a part of the UK it would have been an oﬀence listed in subsection (2) in that
part of the UK, he is guilty of that oﬀence, in that part of the UK. The jurisdiction
in respect of oﬀences committed abroad extends to all persons not just British
citizens or companies incorporated in the UK (subsection (3)).
Subsection (4)
86. Subsection (4) sets out that in the case of oﬀences occurring wholly or partly
abroad, proceedings may be brought in any place in the United Kingdom, and that
for incidental purposes, the oﬀence may be treated as having been committed in
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
816
 
www.ebook3000.com

that place. This is to ensure that court and other criminal proceedings provisions
can operate properly and eﬀectively.
Subsections (5) and (6)
87. Subsection (5) amends section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883 (c. 3). Under
section 3(1)(a) of that Act it is an oﬀence to carry out certain acts preparatory to
causing an explosion. The preparatory acts must take place in the UK or its
dependencies, or, in the case of a citizen of the UK or colonies, anywhere in the
world. At the moment in order for the oﬀence to be committed the explosion
must be intended to take place in the UK or the Republic of Ireland. This means
that it is not an oﬀence to do acts preparatory to an explosion in a country other
than the UK or the Republic of Ireland. Subsection (5) amends section 3 so that the
explosion can be planned to take place anywhere in the world. Subsection (6)
provides that the amendment to the Explosive Substances Act 1883 only applies to
Scotland so far as the act that may be considered an oﬀence is an act of terrorism,
an act for the purposes of terrorism, or that any possession or control of a
substance is for the purposes of terrorism. The provision is so limited because
section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883 is only a reserved matter, within the
meaning of the Scotland Act 1998, insofar as it relates to terrorism.
Section 18 – Liability of company directors etc.
88. This section provides that oﬀences under Part 1 of this Act that are committed
by corporate bodies will also be committed by a senior oﬃcer of that body if
the oﬀence was committed by the corporate body with his consent or connivance.
Of the oﬀences in Part 1 a corporate body is most likely to be prosecuted for
an oﬀence under section 2 of disseminating terrorist publications. Both the senior
oﬃcer (or oﬃcers, if consent or connivance can be proved against each) and the
body corporate will be liable for the oﬀence. Subsection (1) relates to bodies
corporate and provides that a director, manager, secretary or other similar oﬃcer of
the body can be held liable under this section on the stated grounds. Subsection (2)
makes a similar provision in relation to Scottish ﬁrms. Subsection (3) provides that
the term ‘director’ includes members of a corporate body if that body is managed
by its members rather than directors as such.
Section 19 – Consents to prosecutions
Subsection (1)
89. Subsection (1) sets out that prosecutions for oﬀences in Part 1 of this Act may
only be carried out in England and Wales with the consent of the Director of
Public Prosecutions or, in Northern Ireland, with the consent of the Director
of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. This is subject to a case falling
into subsection (2).
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
817
 

Subsections (2) and (3)
90. Subsection (2) provides that, in a case where it appears to the Director of Public
Prosecutions, or Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, that the
oﬀence has been committed for a purpose wholly or partly connected with
the aﬀairs of a foreign country, a prosecution may only be brought if the Attorney
General, or, in the case of Northern Ireland, the Advocate General for Northern
Ireland, agrees with the DPP’s, or the DPP for Northern Ireland’s, decision to give
consent. Subsection (3) provides a transitional in relation to the time before the
commencement of Section 27(1) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c. 26).
Prior to that time the Advocate General for Northern Ireland will not be in
existence and so the Attorney General for Northern Ireland must agree with the
DPP for Northern Ireland’s decision to consent instead.
Section 20 – Interpretation of Part 1
91. Section 20 provides interpretation provisions and other deﬁnitions for Part 1 of
the Act.
Subsection (1)
92. Subsection (1) provides that deﬁnitions used in the TACT also apply to Part 1 of
this Act. Such deﬁnitions that are generally relevant to the Act are discussed at
paragraphs 16–19.
Subsection (2)
93. Subsection (2) contains a number of deﬁnitions including the deﬁnition of Conven-
tion oﬀence as set out in Schedule 1 to the Act.
Subsection (3)
94. Subsection (3) clariﬁes references to the public. In particular it makes it clear that
public can mean the public of a country other than the UK. It also makes it clear
that, other than in section 9(4) (deﬁnition of radioactive material), it includes a
meeting or other group of persons that the public can attend. A meeting or group
will be included in the deﬁnition even if payment must be made or other conditions
must be satisﬁed before a person will be admitted.
Subsections (4) and (6)
95. Subsections (4) deﬁnes the term ‘publishing a statement’, for the purposes of Part 1
of the Act. This deﬁnition covers references to publication in the oﬀence of
encouragement of terrorism in section 1. The deﬁnition does not include references
to publication in section 2, due to the fact that publication for the purposes of
section 2 is already deﬁned in section 2(13). The deﬁnition in subsection (4) includes
publishing a statement in any manner to the public, providing an electronic service
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
818
 
www.ebook3000.com

by which means the public have access to the statement, or using an electronic
service provided by another in relation to the material supplied by him so as
to enable the public to have access to the statement. The second limb of the
deﬁnition will include internet service providers. The third limb of the deﬁnition
will include those who run websites that contain message boards and those that
post messages on such message boards. Subsection (6) clariﬁes references to a
statement, detailing that these are references to a communication of any descrip-
tion and are not limited to words. This means that images such as videos will be
covered.
Subsections (9) to (11)
96. Subsection (9) enables the Secretary of State to modify Schedule 1 (Convention
oﬀences) to add or remove oﬀences, and make such supplemental, incidental,
consequential and transitional provisions as are needed as a consequence of
amendments to the list. Subsection (10) sets out that any such order may only
add an oﬀence in or as regards Scotland if the provision creating the oﬀence
would be outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. Sub-
section (11) sets out that such an order is subject to the aﬃrmative resolution
procedure.
Schedule 1 – Convention oﬀences
97. The deﬁnition of Convention oﬀence is set out in section 20(2) and it covers the
oﬀences listed in Schedule 1 and any oﬀence equivalent to the listed oﬀences under
the law of a country or territory outside the UK. Schedule 1 deﬁnes Convention
oﬀences for the purposes of Part 1 of this Act. References to Convention oﬀences
can be found in sections 1 (encouragement of terrorism), 3 (application of sections 1
and 2 to internet activity, etc.), 6 (training for terrorism) and 8 (attendance at a
place used for terrorist training). The new oﬀences in sections 1 and 6 implement
provisions of the Council of Europe Convention for the Prevention of Terrorism.
The Convention oﬀences are intended to cover the concept of terrorist oﬀence
in the Convention. Terrorist oﬀence is deﬁned in Article 1 of the Convention as
all the oﬀences covered by the treaties listed in the Appendix to the Convention.
As those treaties have been implemented in UK law, Schedule 1 lists the oﬀences
in UK law.
98. The following categories of oﬀences are included: explosives oﬀences, oﬀences
relating to biological weapons, oﬀences against internationally protected persons,
hostage taking, hijacking and other oﬀences against aircraft, oﬀences involving
nuclear material, oﬀences under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990,
oﬀences involving chemical weapons, oﬀences relating to terrorist funds, directing
a terrorist organisation, oﬀences involving nuclear weapons, and inchoate oﬀences
(such as conspiracy, incitement and attempting to commit an oﬀence) relating
to Convention oﬀences. As well as being drafted in terms of Convention oﬀences
the provisions of the Act that refer to Convention oﬀences are also drafted by
reference to the wider concept of acts of terrorism.

Part 2
Section 21 – Grounds of proscription
99. Section 3 of the TACT gives the Secretary of State power to add an organisation
to the list of proscribed organisations in Schedule 2 of that Act if he believes that
the organisation is concerned in terrorism. The term ‘concerned in terrorism’ is
deﬁned in section 3(5), and includes that the organisation promotes or encour-
ages terrorism (section 3(5)(c)). Organisation is deﬁned in section 121 of the
TACT as including any association or combination of persons. A number of the
oﬀences in the TACT are dependent on an organisation being proscribed, for
example, the oﬀences in section 11 (membership of a proscribed organisation)
and section 12 (support for a proscribed organisation). Also some of the powers
in the TACT can be exercised on the basis that an organisation is proscribed, for
example, the resources of a proscribed organisation can be seized as terrorist cash
under Part 3 of the TACT (see in particular section 25).
100. Section 21 widens the grounds of proscription. It provides that a group may be
considered to promote or encourage terrorism under section 3(5)(c) if its activ-
ities include the unlawful gloriﬁcation of terrorism or its activities are carried out
in a manner that ensures that it is associated with statements containing unlawful
gloriﬁcation of terrorism. Gloriﬁcation of conduct is unlawful if persons who
may become aware of it could reasonably be expected to infer that the conduct is
gloriﬁed as conduct that should be emulated in existing circumstances. As in Part 1
of the Act conduct and conduct that is illustrative of a type of conduct are both
covered. Gloriﬁcation and statement are both deﬁned in similar terms to Part 1 of
the Act. Gloriﬁcation is deﬁned to include praise and celebration. Statement is
deﬁned to include a communication without words consisting of sounds, images
or both.
Section 22 – Name changes by proscribed organisations
101. Section 3 of the TACT deﬁnes a proscribed organisation for the purposes of
the TACT as an organisation listed in Schedule 2 to that Act or an organisation
that operates under the same name as a listed organisation. Various oﬀences
under the TACT depend on an organisation being proscribed. This section deals
with the situation in which an organisation is the same as an organisation that
appears in Schedule 2 to the TACT but it is operating under a name that is
diﬀerent to that listed in Schedule 2 and the situation in which an organisation
listed in Schedule 2 is operating under several names not all of which appear in
Schedule 2.
Subsection (2)
102. Subsection (2) amends section 3 of the TACT. New subsection (6) of section 3
provides that, if the Secretary of State believes that an organisation that is listed in
Schedule 2 is operating under a name that is not speciﬁed in Schedule 2, or that
an organisation is operating under a diﬀerent name but is the same as a listed
organisation, he can make an order to the eﬀect that the name that does not
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
820
 
www.ebook3000.com

appear in Schedule 2, is another name for the listed organisation. The eﬀect of
such an order is that the organisation included in the order will be treated as if it
were listed in Schedule 2 under both the name already speciﬁed for it in the
Schedule and the other name given in the order (new subsection (7)). This eﬀect
continues while the order is in force and the organisation is listed in Schedule 2.
The Secretary of State has the power to revoke the order in new subsection (8) of
section 3.
103. An order under these provisions is subject to the negative resolution procedure.
This is in contrast to an order amending Schedule 2 which is subject to the
aﬃrmative resolution procedure.
Subsections (3) to (7)
104. These subsections apply the existing provisions in the TACT for review of and
appeal against proscription to an order that a name be treated as another name
for a listed organisation. Section 4 of the TACT allows those who have an interest
in an organisation being proscribed to apply to the Secretary of State to have
an organisation de-proscribed. Subsections (3) and (4) of this section amend
section 4 to allow similar applications in respect of an order that a name be
treated as another name for a listed organisation. Subsection (5) includes orders
to treat a name as another name for a listed organisation in section 5 of the
TACT, which allows an appeal to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commis-
sion (POAC), if the Secretary of State refuses to revoke an order following an
application under section 4. An appeal is also possible against POAC’s decision
under section 6 of the TACT although this does not require speciﬁc amendment
by the section.
105. If an appeal is successful under section 5 then the Secretary of State is obliged
to revoke his order as provided for in new section 5(5A) of the TACT to be
inserted by subsection (6) of the section. Subsection (7) includes the new orders
into section 7 of the TACT. Section 7 sets out the eﬀect of a successful appeal on
a conviction that was dependent on an organisation being proscribed.
Subsections (8) to (11)
106. Subsections (8) to (11) make a number of amendments to the TACT that are
consequential on the creation of the new type of order and its inclusion in the
appeal process.
Section 23 – Extension of period of detention of terrorist suspects
107. This section contains amendments to Schedule 8 to the TACT, which deals,
among other things, with extension of detention prior to charging of those
arrested under section 41 of the TACT. The original maximum period of deten-
tion of seven days was extended to a maximum of 14 days by section 306 of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
821
 

Subsections (2), (5) and (11)
108. Subsection (2) widens the group of people who may apply for a warrant of further
detention under paragraph 29 of Schedule 8 and for an extension of detention
under paragraph 36 of Schedule 8. At the moment only a police oﬃcer of at least
rank of superintendent may make those applications. As amended, in England
and Wales a Crown Prosecutor, in Scotland a procurator ﬁscal or the Lord Advo-
cate, in Northern Ireland the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland,
and anywhere in the UK a police oﬃcer of the rank of superintendent or above
may apply for a warrant of further detention or for extension of the period of
detention. As a consequence of this change subsection (5) makes an amendment
to paragraph 34(1) of Schedule 8 to the TACT. It substitutes the word ‘person’
for ‘oﬃcer’ in that provision, ensuring that all those listed in subsection (2) have
the power to apply to the judge presiding over the extension of detention hearing
to have information that forms part of that application withheld from a person to
whom an application relates. Subsection (11) makes a further consequential
change to substitute a new paragraph 37 into Schedule 8. Paragraph 37 provides
that any detained person must be released if the grounds on which his continued
detention was authorised are no longer met and there is no other reason for him
to be held. The new paragraph 37 is expanded so that as well as referring to a
police oﬃcer deciding if continued detention is justiﬁed it also refers to other
people that may be in charge of the case.
Subsections (3) and (4)
109. Subsection (3) amends paragraph 29(3) of Schedule 8 so that when a court agrees
to an extension of the period of detention, the period of the extension will
normally be seven days. This is subject to new sub-paragraph (3A). At the
moment the extension can be for anything up to seven days. Subsection (4) inserts
a new subparagraph (3A) into paragraph 29 that provides that the court may
issue a warrant of further detention for less than seven days if either the applica-
tion for the warrant speciﬁes a shorter time period or the judicial authority is
satisﬁed that there are circumstances that mean that an extension for as long as
seven days is inappropriate.
Subsection (6)
110. Subsection (6) amends, and inserts new sub-paragraphs (1A) and (1B) into
paragraph 36 of Schedule 8, which deals with the extension of warrants of further
detention. The new sub-paragraphs provide that, if an application is to extend
detention beyond 14 days from the relevant time it must be made to a senior judge.
If an application is to extend detention for no more than 14 days from the relevant
time the application must be made to a judicial authority, unless an application
has previously been made to a senior judge. At the moment all applications under
paragraph 36 are made to a judicial authority. Subsection (10) inserts a deﬁnition
of senior judge into paragraph 36. Senior judge is deﬁned, in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland as a judge of the High Court and, in Scotland as a judge of the
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

High Court of Justiciary. A judicial authority is already deﬁned in paragraph
29(4) of Schedule 8 as, in England and Wales, a District Judge (Magistrates’
Courts) who is designated for the purposes of Part 3 of Schedule 8 by the Lord
Chancellor, in Scotland, a sheriﬀ and, in Northern Ireland, a county court judge
or a resident magistrate designated for the purposes of Part 3 of Schedule 8 by the
Lord Chancellor. The relevant time is deﬁned in paragraph 36(3B) of Schedule 8
as either, the time of a person’s arrest under section 41 of the TACT or, if he was
detained under Schedule 7 to the TACT when he was arrested under section 41,
the time his examination under that Schedule began.
Subsection (7)
111. Subsection (7) further amends paragraph 36 of Schedule 8. The amendments have
two eﬀects. Firstly, each period of extension must be for seven days unless the
application asks for a shorter period or the judicial authority (or senior judge) to
which the application is made is satisﬁed that there are circumstances which mean
that it would be inappropriate to detain the suspect for a further seven days.
Secondly, the maximum period that a warrant of further detention can last in
total is extended from 14 days to 28 days. In cases where detention for a further
seven days would exceed the 28 day limit, the senior judge can only authorise
continued detention up to the 28 day limit.
Subsections (8) and (9)
112. Subsection (8) amends paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 8 to provide that paragraphs
30(3) and 31 to 34 of Schedule 8 (which deal with notice of applications, grounds
for extension, representation and withholding of information) are to apply to
applications to senior judges as they apply to applications to judicial authorities
but references to judicial authority are to be read as references to senior judge.
Subsection (9) makes a consequential amendment to paragraph 36(5).
Subsection (12)
113. Subsection (12) sets out that the amendments made to the procedures for exten-
sion of detention under Schedule 8 of the TACT shall not apply if the arrest of
the person under detention occurred before the commencement of this section of
the Act, or if his examination under Schedule 7 to the TACT began before the
commencement of this section of the Act.
Section 24 – Grounds for extending detention
114. This section amends the grounds for authorising extended detention under
Schedule 8 to the TACT, for review oﬃcers (during the ﬁrst 48 hours of detention)
and for the judicial authority or senior judge (thereafter).
Subsection (1)
115. At the moment paragraph 23(1) of Schedule 8 lists a number of grounds on which
a review oﬃcer can decide to continue to detain a person. Subsection (1) adds to
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
823
 

that list. It sets out that a review oﬃcer may extend detention if he is satisﬁed that
it is necessary pending the result of an examination or analysis of any relevant
evidence or an examination or analysis of anything that may result in relevant
evidence being obtained. An examination or analysis would include a DNA test.
Subsections (2) and (3)
116. Subsections (2) and (3) make the same change to the grounds for issuing a warrant
of further detention in paragraph 32 of Schedule 8. By virtue of paragraph 36(4)
of Schedule 8 this new ground will also apply in relation to an application for
extension of a warrant of further detention.
Subsection (6)
117. Subsection (6) sets out that the amendments made to the grounds for extension
of detention under Schedule 8 to the TACT shall not apply if the arrest of
the person under detention occurred before the commencement of this section of
the Act, or if his examination under Schedule 7 to the TACT began before the
commencement of this section of the Act.
Section 25 – Expiry or renewal of extended maximum detention period
118. The eﬀect of section 25 is that, insofar as they extend the maximum period a
terrorist suspect may be detained under the TACT prior to charge, the amend-
ments made by section 23 will cease to have eﬀect one year after their com-
mencement unless continued in force by an order made by the Secretary of State.
In other words, if the Secretary of State does not make an order the maximum
period of detention will revert to 14 days.
Subsections (1) to (6)
119. Subsection (1) provides that section 25 shall apply if more than a year has passed
since the commencement of section 23, and an order is not currently in force
disapplying this section. Subsection (2) sets out that the Secretary of State may
make an order by statutory instrument to disapply this section for up to a period
of one year. The power can be used more than once. Subsection (3) provides
that, if no order disapplying this section is made under subsection (2), the
maximum period that an individual can be detained under the TACT is limited
to 14 days. It further provides that in that situation the consequential modiﬁca-
tions to paragraphs 36 and 37 of Schedule 8, as set out in subsection (4), will
have eﬀect. The eﬀect of those modiﬁcations is that if the maximum period of
detention reverts to 14 days all applications for extension of detention will be
made to a judicial authority. This is because under the provisions inserted into
Schedule 8 to the TACT by section 23 a senior judge is only concerned in
applications for extension of detention beyond 14 days. If it is not possible to
extend detention beyond 14 days then there is no need for a senior judge to be
involved. Subsection (5) sets out that in the case of an individual who has been
detained for a period longer than 14 days under the TACT at any point in time
at which this section applies, the person with custody of that individual must
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

release him immediately, even if his detention had been authorised to continue
for longer at a time prior to this section applying. Subsection (6) sets out that the
order disapplying section 25 of the Act will be subject to the aﬃrmative reso-
lution procedure.
Section 26 – All premises warrants: England and Wales and
Northern Ireland
120. Under paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the TACT a constable can apply to a justice
of the peace for a warrant to enter and search premises for the purposes of a
terrorist investigation. At the moment that application and warrant must specify
the set of premises to which it relates. Under paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 a
constable may apply to a Circuit judge for a warrant to enter and search premises
for excluded and special procedure material. Once paragraph 9(a) of Schedule 4
to the Courts Act 2003 is commenced it will also be possible for a constable to
make an application under paragraph 11 to a District Judge (Magistrates’ Courts),
the amendments made by section 26 take account of this change. The terms
excluded material and special procedure material are deﬁned in paragraph 4
of Schedule 5 and are given the same meaning as in the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984. Under section 11 of that Act, excepted material means per-
sonal records that a person has acquired or created in the course of any trade,
business, profession or other occupation, or for the purpose of any paid or unpaid
oﬃce and which he holds in conﬁdence; human tissue or tissue ﬂuid that has been
taken for medical diagnosis or treatment and which a person holds in conﬁdence;
and journalistic material which consists of documents, or records other than
documents, and which a person holds in conﬁdence. Under section 14 of that Act,
special procedure material means journalistic material that is not excluded
material; and material acquired or created in the course of any trade, business,
profession or other occupation, or for the purpose of any paid or unpaid oﬃce
and which is held subject to an express undertaking of conﬁdence or an obligation
of conﬁdence imposed by any enactment. As with a warrant under paragraph 1, at
the moment a warrant in relation to excluded or special procedure material must
relate to speciﬁc premises. This section amends Schedule 5 to allow all premises
warrants to be issued. These provisions are based on the provisions in sections 113
and 114 of the SOCAP which amend the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
to allow all premises warrants to be granted under that Act.
121. A number of terms that are used in sections 26 and 27 are deﬁned in the TACT.
Premises is deﬁned in section 121 as including any place and in particular
including a vehicle, an oﬀshore installation within the meaning given in
section 44 of the Petroleum Act 1998 and a tent or moveable structure. Vehicle is
deﬁned later in section 121 as including an aircraft, hovercraft, train or vessel.
Section 44 of the Petroleum Act 1998 covers various installations that are
maintained in the water or on the foreshore or other land that is intermittently
covered with water and which do not have a link with dry land such as oil or gas
rigs. Dwelling is deﬁned in section 121 of the TACT as a building or part of a
building used as a dwelling and a vehicle which is habitually stationary and is
used as a dwelling.

825
 

Subsections (2) and (3)
122. Subsections (2) and (3) amend paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the TACT to provide
that search warrants under that Schedule may authorise the searching not just of
named premises but also any premises occupied or controlled by a speciﬁed
person (known as an ‘all premises’ warrant).
Subsection (4)
123. Subsection (4) amends paragraph 1(5) to provide that an all premises warrant
may only be granted where it is not reasonably practicable to specify in the
application for the warrant all the premises which the person to which the appli-
cation relates occupies or controls and which might need to be searched. This
subsection also makes a number of consequential changes.
Subsections (5) and (6)
124. Subsection (5) amends the TACT to provide that paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 only
applies to speciﬁc premises warrants and subsection (6) goes on to insert a para-
graph 2A into Schedule 5 for an all premises warrant that corresponds to
paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 cannot apply to all premises warrants because it refers
to an application not relating to residential premises and with an all premises
warrant the premises to which it relates will not be known at the time of the
application. Under paragraph 2A if the justice of the peace is not convinced of
the necessity of the warrant he may still grant it if the other conditions are met,
so long as the application is made by a police oﬃcer of at least the rank of
superintendent, the warrant is not executed in respect of residential premises and
the warrant is executed within 24 hours of being issued. The new paragraph
includes a deﬁnition of residential premises as any premises which the constable
exercising the power to enter and search has reasonable grounds for believing are
used wholly or mainly as a dwelling.
Subsections (7) and (8)
125. Subsections (7) and (8) amend paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 to the TACT, which
allows for applications for search warrants involving excluded or special pro-
cedure material following an order under paragraph 5, or where it is not
appropriate to make such an order, for access to and production of such material,
to allow all premises warrants to be made in such cases.
Subsections (9) and (10)
126. Subsections (9) and (10) amend paragraph 12 of Schedule 5 to the TACT, which
sets out the test for granting a warrant under paragraph 11. The tests for an all
premises warrant are the same as for a speciﬁc premises warrant but are modiﬁed
to take account of the fact that there are no premises to be speciﬁed.

Section 27 – All premises warrants: Scotland
127. This section provides for similar changes to those made in section 26 to provide
for all premises warrants in terrorist investigations in Scotland.
Section 28 – Search, seizure and forfeiture of terrorist publications
128. This section creates a power of seizure and forfeiture in relation to terrorist
publications within the meaning of section 2.
Subsections (1) and (2)
129. Subsection (1) grants a justice of the peace the power to issue a warrant authoris-
ing a constable to enter and search premises and seize any article on those prem-
ises that meets the test in subsection (2) if he is satisﬁed that there are reasonable
grounds for suspecting that an article that meets the test in subsection (2) is on
those premises. The test in subsection (2) is that the article is likely to be subject to
conduct of the kind mentioned in section 2(2)(a) to (e) (distribution etc.) and it
would be treated as a terrorist publication (as deﬁned in section 2(3)).
Subsection (3)
130. Subsection (3) entitles the person exercising the power conferred by the warrant
to use reasonable force in doing so.
Subsections (4) and (5)
131. If a warrant is granted on the basis of an information laid by or on behalf of the
Director of Public Prosecutions (‘the DPP’), or, in Northern Ireland, the Director
of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, the articles seized under it are liable
to be forfeited under the procedure in Schedule 2 (as introduced by subsection
(8)). Subsection (4) states that items seized under the authority of a warrant may
be removed by a constable to such a place as he thinks ﬁt, and may be retained
there until returned or otherwise disposed of in accordance with procedures
outlined. Subsection (5) sets out that only those items seized under a warrant
issued following an information laid by the DPP or the DPP for Northern Ireland
shall be liable to forfeiture. Subsection (5) also provides that if forfeited, articles
may be destroyed or disposed of by a constable in whatever manner he sees ﬁt.
Subsections (6) and (7)
132. Subsection (6) amends the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 to include the
powers of seizure in this section in Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule 1 of that Act. This
will enable a bulk of material to be taken away to be read, rather than being
examined on the premises, to see if it should be seized. This is needed for cases
where large numbers of publications are held at a set of premises. Subsection (7)
sets out that existing rules for seized property contained in the Police (Property)
Act 1897, and the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 shall not apply to articles
seized under authority of the powers outlined in this section as the Act provides
speciﬁc powers for the treatment of seized property.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
827
 

Subsections (9) and (10)
133. Subsection (9) provides a number of deﬁnitions. ‘Article’ is deﬁned as having the
same meaning as in Part 1 of this Act (deﬁned in section 20 (interpretation of
Part 1)). ‘Premises’ is deﬁned as having the same meaning as in section 23 of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (c.60). The deﬁnition in that Act deﬁnes
premises as including any place and in particular including any vehicle, vessel,
aircraft, hovercraft, oﬀshore installation, renewable energy installation, tent or
movable structure. Subsection (10) modiﬁes section 28 in its application to
Scotland.
Schedule 2 – Seizure and forfeiture of terrorist publications
134. Schedule 2 sets out the procedure for forfeiture of terrorist publications seized
under section 28 of this Act. Schedule 2 is closely based on the forfeiture provisions
in Schedule 3 to the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (c.2).
Paragraph 2
135. Paragraph 2 sets out that notice must be given by the constable responsible for
the seizure to every person whom he believes to be the owner of any article
seized. If there is no such person, or it is not reasonably practical for such notice
to be given, it should be given to the person the constable believes is the occupier
of the premises where the article was seized. The notice must set out what has
been seized, and the grounds for seizure. Only if a notice has been properly given
under paragraph 1 or it was not reasonably practicable to comply with para-
graph 1 can an article be forfeited (sub-paragraph (5)). Sub-paragraphs (3), (4)
and (6) further set out requirements about the manner in which the notice must
be given.
Paragraphs 3 and 4
136. These paragraphs set out that a person claiming that any seized article is not
liable to forfeiture may give notice of such a claim to a constable at any police
station in the police area in which the seizure took place. Such a notice, which
must be given in writing, must be given within one month of the notice of the
seizure, or the seizure itself if no notice has been given.
Paragraph 5
137. Paragraph 5 provides that forfeiture is automatic if no claim is made under
paragraphs 3 and 4 within the time for making a claim under those paragraphs
(one month), or if an attempt is made to make a claim but the requirements of
3 and 4 are not complied with.
Paragraph 6
138. Paragraph 6 provides for forfeiture by the court in cases where a claim is made.
When a notice claiming that an article seized is not liable to forfeiture has been
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
828
 
www.ebook3000.com

received, the relevant constable must decide whether to take proceedings to ask
the court to condemn the article as forfeited. This decision should be taken as
soon as reasonably practicable following the notice of the claim. For the court to
order the condemnation of an article to forfeiture, it must be satisﬁed of two
matters: ﬁrstly, that the item was liable for forfeiture when seized, and secondly,
that its forfeiture would not be inappropriate. If the court is not satisﬁed that
these tests have been met, it must order the return of the item to the person it
believes is entitled to it. If the constable decides not to take proceedings for
condemnation, then the constable must return the article to the person who
appears to be the owner of it as soon as reasonably practicable following the
decision not to take proceedings for condemnation.
Paragraphs 7 to 11
139. These paragraphs set out the procedure for forfeiture proceedings in court. These
proceedings will be civil proceedings. Paragraph 7 sets out the courts in which
such proceedings may be instituted. Paragraph 8 states that such proceedings may
only be instituted in a Magistrates’ Court, the sheriﬀ court or a court of sum-
mary jurisdiction if it has jurisdiction in relation to the place where the article to
which they relate was seized. Paragraph 10 sets out the procedure for appeals
against decisions of summary jurisdiction courts to higher courts. Paragraph 11
sets out that for the duration of any appeal the seized items will remain in the
possession of the constable who seized them.
Paragraphs 12 to 17
140. Paragraph 12 sets out that if an article is condemned as forfeited by the court, it
will be deemed to have been forfeited from the time of the seizure. If 12 months
after a requirement to return property arises an article that should have been
returned is still with a constable and it is not reasonably practicable for it to be
returned the constable can dispose of it (paragraph 13). Paragraphs 14 and 15 set
out provisions of proof, detailing that the fact, form and manner of seizure is to
be assumed to have been by the process set out in this Act, unless the contrary is
shown. They also detail how the condemnation of an article as forfeited may be
proved. Paragraph 16 sets out special provisions for the property of a body cor-
porate, two or more partners, and more than ﬁve persons. Paragraph 17 provides
that the returning of an item to a person in line with requirements in this Schedule
does not aﬀect the rights of any other person in respect of that article. This
ensures that property and ownership rights in an article are not aﬀected by its
return to a particular individual.
Section 29 – Power to search vehicles under Schedule 7 to the Terrorism
Act 2000 (c.11)
141. This section extends paragraph 8(1) of Schedule 7 to the TACT to allow an
examining oﬃcer (i.e. a constable, an immigration oﬃcer or a customs oﬃcer) to
search a vehicle at a port which is on a ship or aircraft, or which the examining
oﬃcer reasonably believes has been or is about to be on a ship or aircraft for the
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
829
 

purposes of determining whether a person the examining oﬃcer is questioning
under paragraph 2 of Schedule 7 falls within section 40(1)(b) of the TACT. A
person falls within section 40(1)(b) of the TACT if he is or has been concerned
in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. At the
moment an examining oﬃcer does not have the power to search vehicles in
these circumstances, even though he does have the power to search vehicles
in the Northern Ireland border area (see paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 7). The
deﬁnition of vehicle in section 121 of the TACT (which provides that ‘vehicle’
includes an aircraft, hovercraft, train or vessel) does not extend to Schedule 7.
Section 30 – Extension to internal waters of authorisations to stop
and search
142. This section amends sections 44 and 45 of the TACT. Section 44 provides that an
authorisation may be given for a particular police area or part of a police area
and under the authorisation a constable may stop a vehicle in the area and search
the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle, a passenger in the vehicle and anything on or
in the vehicle or carried by the driver or a passenger. Subsection (2) adds a new
subsection to section 44 to enable an authorisation under section 44 to include
internal waters adjacent to any area or place speciﬁed under section 44(4) or part
of such internal waters. Subsections (3) and (4) make amendments to sections 44
and 45 to ensure that ‘driver’ in those sections makes sense in the context of a
vehicle which is not a car. ‘Driver’ is deﬁned in section 52 of the TACT as
including the person who was driving the vehicle when it was left on a road, if it
was left on a road. Under section 45 a constable may seize an article found during
a search under section 44.
Section 31 – Amendment of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 (c.13)
143. Section 31 makes amendments to the ISA in relation to the powers of the security
and intelligence services with respect to warrants to carry out acts both overseas
and in the UK.
Subsection (2)
144. Subsection (2) grants the Secretary of State the power to nominate speciﬁed
senior oﬃcials who will then be entitled in urgent cases to authorise warrants
under section 5 of the ISA (warrants authorising actions of the security and
intelligence services).
Subsection (3)
145. Subsection (3) provides that such warrants issued by the senior oﬃcials nomin-
ated by the Secretary of State may only authorise actions that would, if done
outside the British Islands, be covered by a current authorisation issued by a
Secretary of State under section 7 of the ISA (authorisations of acts outside the
British Islands). It further provides that the person issuing any such warrant must
inform the Secretary of State as soon as practicable after such a warrant is issued.
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

Subsection (4)
146. Subsection (4) amends the duration for which warrants issued by senior oﬃcials
may last from two to ﬁve working days.
Subsection (5)
147. Subsection (5) amends the duration for which authorisations issued by senior
oﬃcials under section 7 of the ISA may last from two to ﬁve working days. These
warrants relate to the authorisation of actions outside the British Islands that
would otherwise be contrary to UK law.
Subsection (6)
148. Subsection (6) adds a provision to section 7 of the ISA that actions carried out in
relation to property overseas that have been authorised by the Secretary of State
under that section, and that are capable of being authorised by a warrant under
section 5, may continue after a certain change of circumstances for up to ﬁve
working days. These changes of circumstances are the discovery that the property
to which the actions relate was actually in the British Islands, when it was previ-
ously believed that it was outside, or the discovery that the target had been
brought into the British Islands. The period of ﬁve working days is deemed to
have begun at the point that it ﬁrst appears to a member of the Intelligence
Service, or to GCHQ, that a change of circumstances has occurred.
Section 32 – Interception warrants
149. Section 32 makes amendments to the provisions concerning the duration and
modiﬁcation of, and safeguards attached to, interception warrants issued pursuant
to Part 1 of RIPA.
150. Subsection (2) amends section 9(6) of RIPA, bringing into line the duration of the
initial interception warrant issued in the interests of national security or for the
purpose of safeguarding the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom with
the duration of any such warrant when renewed. Previously, these warrants lasted
only for three months when ﬁrst issued, but could be renewed for a six month
period. This amendment provides that both initial and renewed warrants will
now last for a maximum of six months.
151. Subsections (3) and (4) amend section 10 of RIPA, to allow modiﬁcations of the
schedules of an intercept warrant, issued in the interests of national security, to
be made by a senior oﬃcial who is either the person to whom it is addressed, or
one of their subordinates. Such modiﬁcations cease to have eﬀect at the end of
the ﬁfth working day.
152. Subsections (5), (6) and (7) amend section 16 of RIPA, which provides extra
safeguards in the case of warrants to which section 8(4) certiﬁcates apply. One of
these safeguards is a general prohibition on examining material intercepted under
such warrants selected by reference to an individual who is known to be for the
time being in the British Islands or by a factor which has as its purpose the
identiﬁcation of material contained in communications to or from such an indi-
vidual. However, section 16(3) of RIPA allows such selection, provided certain
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
831
 

conditions are met. One of those conditions is that the material relates only to
communications sent during the period speciﬁed in the section 8(4) certiﬁcate,
such period having a maximum of 3 months. Subsections (5)(a) and (6) make
amendments such that, in cases where the section 8(4) certiﬁcation has been
issued in the interests of national security, that maximum period is increased
from three to six months.
153. Section 16(5) of RIPA further allows such selection where there has been a
change of circumstances which would otherwise mean that selection for examin-
ation would no longer be possible because an individual is found to have entered
the British Islands. Selection can only continue pursuant to this provision for
one working day after the day on which the change of circumstances became
apparent. Subsections (5)(b) and (7) make amendments such that, in cases where
the section 8(4) certiﬁcation has been issued in the interests of national security,
that period is increased from one to ﬁve working days.
Section 33 – Disclosure notices for the purposes of terrorist investigations
154. This section extends the regime contained in Part 2, chapter 1 of the SOCAP
under which a disclosure notice may be issued by the Investigating Authority,
requiring those on whom such a notice is served to provide speciﬁc information
as set out in the notice. Refusal to provide information is an oﬀence, punishable
by imprisonment for up to 51 weeks, or a ﬁne. Providing false or misleading
information is an oﬀence, punishable by imprisonment for up to two years, or a
ﬁne, or both. The Investigating Authority is deﬁned as the Director of Public
Prosecutions, the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions, or the Lord
Advocate.
Subsections (1) and (2)
155. Subsection (1) amends section 60(1) of the SOCAP to extend the powers of the
Investigating Authority to enable the issuing of disclosure notices in terrorist
investigations. At the moment a disclosure notice can only be issued in connec-
tion with the investigation of speciﬁc oﬀences. Subsection (2) inserts a deﬁnition
of terrorist investigation into section 60 of the SOCAP.
Subsection (3)
156. Subsection (3) amends section 62 of the SOCAP to provide that a disclosure
notice may be given where the Investigating Authority believes that a person has
information that relates to a terrorist investigation. There must also be reasonable
grounds for believing both that the person to whom the notice is issued has relevant
information and that any information provided is likely to be of substantial value
to that investigation.
Subsection (4)
157. Subsection (4) inserts deﬁnitions of ‘act of terrorism’, ‘terrorism’, and ‘terrorist
investigation’, into section 70 of the SOCAP for the purpose of the disclosure
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

notice provisions. The ﬁrst two of these terms are deﬁned by reference to the
TACT. The deﬁnition of terrorism and act of terrorism are discussed at para-
graphs 16–19 of these explanatory notes. The deﬁnition of terrorist investigation
is set out in section 60(7) of the SOCAP (as inserted by subsection (2) of this
section). The deﬁnition covers the investigation of the commission, preparation
or instigation of acts of terrorism, the investigation of acts or omissions that
appear to be carried out for the purposes of terrorism and which consist of
the commission, preparation or instigation of an oﬀence and the investigation
of an oﬀence under the TACT or Part 1 of this Act (except an oﬀence under
section 1 (encouragement of terrorism) or section 2 (dissemination of terrorist
publications)).
Section 34 – Amendment of the deﬁnition of ‘terrorism’ etc.
158. This section amends two deﬁnitions. These amendments are required to eliminate
the disparity between deﬁnitions of terrorism in UK law and the equivalent
deﬁnitions in various international Conventions which the UK aims to implement.
Examples of international agreements in which the disparity exists are the
EU Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on Combating Terrorism, and the
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Terrorism. These
Conventions allow for actions to be termed as terrorist if, among other tests,
the use or threat of action is designed to inﬂuence international governmental
organisations (such as the United Nations), in addition to State parties’
governments.
159. The section amends the deﬁnition of ‘terrorism’, in section 1 of the TACT to
include the carrying out of acts where the use or threat is designed to inﬂuence an
international governmental organisation. The new deﬁnition, as amended will
read:
1.— (1) In this Act ‘terrorism’ means the use or threat of action where–
(a) the action falls within subsection (2),
(b) the use or threat is designed to inﬂuence the government or an inter-
national governmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section
of the public, and
(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious
or ideological cause.
(2) Action falls within this subsection if it–
(a) involves serious violence against a person,
(b) involves serious damage to property,
(c) endangers a person’s life, other than that of the person committing the
action,
(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the
public, or
(e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic
system.
Secondly, the section amends section 113 of the ATCSA in a similar way. Section 113
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
833
 

makes it an oﬀence to use noxious substances in a way likely to cause violence against a
person, serious damage to property or to endanger life or to make members of the
public fear their life is endangered. The action must be designed to intimidate the
public or to inﬂuence a government. The amendment extends this to international
governmental organisations.
Section 35 – Applications for extended detention of seized cash
160. This section amends Schedule 1 to the ATCSA. That Schedule makes provision
for the forfeiture of terrorist cash. Under paragraph 2 of the Schedule an author-
ised oﬃcer may seize any cash if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it
is terrorist cash. Terrorist cash means cash that is intended to be used for terrorist
purposes, cash which consists of resources of a proscribed organisation and
property that is earmarked as terrorist property.
161. Once terrorist cash has been seized paragraph 3 of the Schedule governs the
length of time it can be detained. Initially the cash can be detained for 48 hours
after which the authorised oﬃcer must apply to a Magistrates’ Court (or in
Scotland a sheriﬀ) to extend the period of detention. The ﬁrst application for
extension can also be made, outside Scotland, to a justice of the peace (paragraph
3(3)). This section adds a new subparagraph to paragraph 3 that provides that if
the ﬁrst application for extension of detention of terrorist cash is made to a
justice of the peace (or the sheriﬀ, in the case of Scotland) it can be heard without
notice being given to the person aﬀected by the order or that person’s legal
representative and can be heard in private in the absence of the aﬀected person
and his legal representative. The person aﬀected will have the opportunity to
challenge the making of the order at a later date because he will be served with a
copy of it (paragraph 3(4)) and can apply for it to be discharged (paragraph 5).
Subsection (2) provides that this amendment will not be retrospective, and may
only be applied to applications to extend detention of seized cash made after the
commencement of this section.
Part 3
Section 36 – Review of terrorism legislation
Subsections (1) to (6)
162. Subsection (1) provides that the Secretary of State must appoint a person to review
the operation of the provisions of the TACT and of Part 1 of this Act. This will
replace section 126 of the TACT that provides for the annual review of the TACT.
Subsection (2) sets out that such a person may carry out such reviews from time to
time and the outcome of such a review must be reported to the Secretary of State.
Under subsections (3) and (4) the ﬁrst review and report must be completed in the
year following the laying before Parliament of the last report under section 126 of
the TACT and subsequently reviews and reports must be conducted and produced
at least annually. Subsection (5) sets out that the Secretary of State must lay a copy
of any report before Parliament. Subsection (6) allows for the reimbursing of the
reviewer for costs incurred in the course of his duties.

Section 37 – Consequential amendments and repeals
163. Section 37 makes a number of consequential amendments to the TACT and
introduces Schedule 3 to the Act which makes a number of repeals. All of these
repeals are consequential on the substantive changes made elsewhere in the Act.
Subsections (1) to (4)
164. Subsection (1) amends the deﬁnition of ‘terrorist investigation’ in the TACT to
include investigation of the oﬀences in Part 1 of this Act, other than sections 1
and 2. Subsection (2) amends section 117 of the TACT relating to consents to
prosecutions. The amendment provides that, if it appears to the Director of
Public Prosecutions or the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland,
that an oﬀence to which the consent to prosecutions provisions in the TACT
apply, has been carried out for a purpose wholly or partly connected with the
aﬀairs of a country other than the UK, prosecution will only proceed if the
Attorney General, or, in Northern Ireland, the Advocate General for Northern
Ireland, agrees with the DPP’s or the DPP for Northern Ireland’s decision to
consent. The subsection also provides a transitional provision in relation to sec-
tion 27(1) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. Before that provision
comes into force the Advocate General for Northern Ireland will not be in exist-
ence and so during that time the Attorney General for Northern Ireland must
agree with the DPP for Northern Ireland instead. Subsection (3) amends the
TACT to provide for supplemental powers of the courts in respect of forfeiture
orders made under sections 54, 58 and 103 of that Act, entitling the courts to
make any such provision as appears to be necessary for giving eﬀect to forfeiture.
Subsection (4) adds the oﬀences in Part 1 of this Act to the list of Scheduled
Oﬀences in Schedule 9 to the TACT. These are oﬀences in respect of which
special procedures, such as trial without jury, apply in Northern Ireland.
Section 39 – Short title, commencement and extent
165. Under section 39(5) the Act extends to the whole of the United Kingdom except
the provisions in section 17 relating to the use of explosives for non terrorist
purposes do not extend to Scotland (since this is a devolved matter). The section
provides for the extension of any provisions of the Act, with such modiﬁcations
as are seen ﬁt, to the Channel Islands or Isle of Man by Her Majesty by Order in
Council.
Commencement
166. Section 39 of the Act provides for commencement. That section will come into
force on Royal Assent and the remainder of the provisions of the Act will be
brought into force by means of commencement orders made by the Secretary of
State.

2. Explanatory Notes on the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005
The Government has repealed the Part 4 powers under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime
and Security Act 2001 and replaced them with a system of control orders under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005.
The Prevention of Terrorism Act allows for control orders to be made against any
suspected terrorist, whether a UK national or a non-UK national, or whether the
terrorist activity is international or domestic.
The Home Secretary is required to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably pos-
sible after the end of the relevant three-month period on how control order powers
have been exercised during that time.
The facts about control orders
1. Control orders enable the authorities to impose conditions upon individuals ran-
ging from prohibitions on access to speciﬁc items or services (such as the Internet),
and restrictions on association with named individuals, to the imposition of
restrictions on movement or curfews. A control order does not mean ‘house arrest’.

2. Speciﬁc conditions imposed under a control order are tailored to each case to
ensure eﬀective disruption and prevention of terrorist activity.
3. The Home Secretary must normally apply to the courts to impose a control order
based on an assessment of the intelligence information. If the court allows the
order to be made, the case will be automatically referred to the court for a judicial
review of the decision.
4. In emergency cases the Home Secretary may impose a provisional order which
must then be reviewed by the court within 7 days.
5. A court may consider the case in open or closed session—depending on the nature
and sensitivity of the information under consideration. Special Advocates will be
used to represent the interests of the controlled individuals in closed sessions.
6. Control orders will be time limited and may be imposed for a period of up to
12 months at a time. A fresh application for renewal has to be made thereafter.
7. A control order and its conditions can be challenged.
8. Breach of any of the obligations of the control order without reasonable excuse is
a criminal oﬀence punishable with a prison sentence of up to ﬁve years and/or an
unlimited ﬁne.
9. Individuals who are subject to control order provisions have the option of applying
for an anonymity order.
10. To date the Government has not sought to make a control order requiring
derogation from Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Explanatory notes
Introduction
1.
These explanatory notes relate to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 which
received Royal Assent on 11 March 2005. They have been prepared by the Home
Oﬃce in order to assist the reader in understanding the Act. They do not form part
of the Act and have not been endorsed by Parliament.
2.
The notes need to be read in conjunction with the Act. They are not, and are not
meant to be, a comprehensive description of the Act. So where a section or part of
a section does not seem to require an explanation or comment, none is given.
Summary
3.
The purpose of this Act is to provide for the making of ‘control orders’ imposing
obligations on individuals suspected of being involved in terrorism-related activity.
These are preventative orders which are designed to restrict or prevent the further
involvement by individuals in such activity.
4.
A control order may impose any obligations necessary for purposes connected with
preventing or restricting an individual’s further involvement in terrorism-related
activity. The intention is that each order will be tailored to the particular risk posed
by the individual concerned. Obligations that may be imposed include, for example,
prohibitions on the possession or use of certain items, restrictions on movement
to or within certain areas, restrictions on communications and associations, and
requirements as to place of abode. It will be possible to make control orders against
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
837
 

any individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity, irrespective
of nationality, or terrorist cause.
5.
Control orders that do not involve derogating from the European Convention on
Human Rights (ECHR), called ‘non-derogating control orders’, will be made by
the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State must seek permission from the
court to make a non-derogating control order. However, in cases of urgency,
the Secretary of State can make an order without ﬁrst seeking the permission
of the court but he must refer it immediately to the court for conﬁrmation. Control
orders that do involve derogating from the ECHR will be made by the court
itself on application from the Secretary of State. Such control orders are called
‘derogating control orders’. All control orders will be subject to full hearings by
the High Court or Court of Session. There will be a right of appeal on a point of
law from a decision of the High Court or Court of Session.
6.
Breach of an obligation imposed by a control order, without reasonable excuse, will
be a criminal oﬀence punishable, following conviction on indictment, with a prison
sentence of up to 5 years, or a ﬁne, or both; or, following summary conviction, to
a prison sentence of up to 12 months (or six months in Scotland or Northern
Ireland), or a ﬁne, or both.
7.
Features of the new scheme will include:
•
Supervision by the court of the making of non-derogating control orders;
•
Power of the court to make derogating control orders on application from the
Secretary of State;
•
Control order proceedings involving the hearing of evidence in open and closed
session with Special Advocates representing the interests of the individuals
concerned in the latter;
•
The application of a judicial review test in hearings relating to non-derogating
control orders;
•
The application of the civil standard of proof on the question of involvement
in terrorism-related activity in hearings relating to derogating control orders;
•
Independent review of the operation of the Act with the ﬁrst review to be
carried out after the Act has been in operation for nine months and subsequent
reviews to be carried out annually;
•
Reports by the Secretary of State to Parliament every three months on his
exercise of the control order powers during that period;
•
Where a derogation is in place which has been approved by Parliament, the
need for further annual Parliamentary approval of the continuing need to rely
on the derogation to make derogating control orders.
Overview
8. The Act is arranged as follows:
Control orders
9. Sections 1–9 relate to the circumstances in which control orders may be made, their
duration and the obligations (including penalties) attached to them.

10. This part of the Act describes the tests which the Secretary of State or court must
apply in determining whether a control order may be made against an individual,
and the obligations which may be imposed by the order. The Act provides an
illustrative list of the obligations to which an individual may be subject and speci-
ﬁes penalties for failing, without reasonable excuse, to observe any obligations so
imposed and for intentionally obstructing a person delivering a notice setting out
the terms of the order.
11. The Act provides that the Secretary of State must obtain permission from the
court before making a non-derogating control order. However, if a non-derogating
control order has to be imposed urgently, the Secretary of State can make the
order straight away but must refer it to the court immediately for the court to
consider whether to conﬁrm it. When considering whether to grant permission for
a non-derogating control order to be made, and when considering whether to
conﬁrm a non-derogating control order that was made urgently, the court may
hold an ex parte hearing and must consider whether the Secretary of State’s
decision in each case was obviously ﬂawed. If it ﬁnds that it was, the order cannot
be made or must be quashed; if it ﬁnds that it was not, the court must refer the
control order to a full inter partes hearing which will apply a judicial review test to
the control order in order to decide if it, and the obligations it imposes, should
continue in force.
12. At a full hearing of a non-derogating order, the Court must consider whether any
of the following decisions of the Secretary of State were ﬂawed:
•
his decision that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person
was involved in terrorism-related activity;
•
his decision that a control order is necessary for purposes connected with
protecting members of the public from the risk of terrorism; and
•
his decisions on the imposition of each of the obligations imposed by the
order.
13. The Act provides that the Secretary of State will apply to the court to make a
derogating control order. At a preliminary hearing (which may be ex parte), the
court will decide if there is a prima facie case for the order to be imposed. If it ﬁnds
that there is not, it will not make the order; if it ﬁnds that there is, it will make the
order and give directions for a full inter partes hearing to be held.
14. The court will conﬁrm a derogating control order at a full hearing if:
•
it is satisﬁed, on the balance of probabilities, that the controlled person is or
has been involved in terrorism-related activity;
•
it considers that the obligations imposed as part of the control order are neces-
sary for purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk
of terrorism;
•
it appears to the court that the risk arises out of or is associated with a public
emergency in respect of which there is a designated derogation from the whole
or a part of Article 5 of the ECHR; and
•
the obligations imposed by the control order are in a list of derogating
obligations set out in the designation order.

839
 

15. In full hearings on control orders, the court can quash the control order, modify
the obligations which it imposes or, in the case of non-derogating control
orders, give directions to the Secretary of State to revoke or modify the
control order.
16. The Secretary of State or court (in the case of non-derogating and derogating
control orders respectively) may revoke or modify an order at any time.
17. The Act lists the oﬀences associated with breaching an order or obstructing
those exercising statutory powers in relation to an order and the relevant
penalties.
Appeals and other proceedings
18. Sections 10–12 deal with appeals and other proceedings. A person subject to a non-
derogating control order may appeal to the court against the following decisions of
the Secretary of State:
•
his decision to renew the control order;
•
his decision to modify the control order;
•
his decision not to revoke or modify the control order on an application from
the controlled person.
19. These provisions set out the powers of the court on such appeals.
20. They also deal with the jurisdiction of the court in relation to control order
decisions and derogation matters and the eﬀect of the court’s decisions on earlier
convictions.
Supplemental
21. This part of the Act makes provision for the general oversight of the operation
of the Act including independent annual review and three monthly reporting to
Parliament on the exercise of his control order powers by the Secretary of State
and annual renewal of the provisions.
22. It also contains general provisions concerning interpretation, repeals, commence-
ment, the title of the Act and extent.
Commentary
Section 1: Power to make control orders
Subsections (1) to (3)
23. Subsection (1) deﬁnes control orders. Subsection (2) explains that control orders
may be made by the Secretary of State unless they involve obligations that are
incompatible with Article 5 of the ECHR. If they involve such obligations, they
can be made only by the court on an application by the Secretary of State.
Subsection (3) states that the obligations that may be imposed as part of a
control order must be those considered necessary for purposes connected with
preventing or restricting involvement by the controlled person in terrorism-related
activity.

Subsections (4) to (8)
24. Subsection (4) sets out an illustrative list of obligations that may be imposed as part
of a control order. Subsection (5) conﬁrms that a control order may restrict a
person’s movements by, for example, requiring him to stay in a particular place at
particular times or generally. Subsection (6) explains that controlled persons may be
required to cooperate with practical arrangements for monitoring control orders,
such as wearing and maintaining apparatus as directed. Subsection (7) provides that
information that the controlled person may be required to provide under a control
order includes advance information about his proposed movements or other activ-
ities. Subsection (8) provides that a particular obligation imposed by an order may
be expressed so that it can be waived (on a single or on multiple occasions) if the
individual seeks and obtains prior permission for this from a speciﬁed person.
25. Subsection (9) deﬁnes ‘involvement in terrorism-related activity’ for the purposes
of the Act as:
(a) the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism;
(b) conduct which facilitates or is intended to facilitate the commission, prepar-
ation or instigation of such acts;
(c) conduct which gives encouragement or is intended to give encouragement to
the commission, preparation or instigation of such acts;
(d) conduct which gives support or assistance to those known or believed to be
involved in terrorism-related activity;
and applies regardless of whether these relate to speciﬁc acts or to terrorism in
general. By virtue of section 15(1), ‘terrorism’ has the same meaning as in the
Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11).
26. Subsection (10) deﬁnes the terms ‘derogating obligation’ (an obligation incompat-
ible with Article 5 which is of a description set out in a designation order), ‘desig-
nated derogation’ (by reference to the Human Rights Act 1998) and ‘designation
order’(the order under section 14(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 by which the
derogation is designated).
Section 2: Making of non-derogating control orders
Subsections (1) and (2)
27. Subsection (1) provides that the Secretary of State may make a non-derogating
control order if he—
(a) has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the individual is or has been
involved in terrorism-related activity; and
(b) considers that it is necessary, for purposes connected with protecting members
of the public from a risk of terrorism, to make a control order imposing
obligations on the individual.
28. Subsection (2) explains that the Secretary of State can impose a control order on an
individual already subject to a control order imposed by the court, only if the court
has decided to revoke its control order but has postponed that revocation in order
to allow the Secretary of State to decide whether to impose his own.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
841
 

Subsections (4) and (5)
29. Subsection (4) states that a non-derogating control order will last for 12 months
and may be renewed. Subsection (5) says that a non-derogating control order must
state when it will cease to have eﬀect.
Subsections (6) to (8)
30. Subsection (6) provides that a non-derogating control order may be renewed for
12 months where the Secretary of State considers that it is necessary for the order
to continue in force, for purposes connected with protecting members of the public
from a risk of terrorism, and that any obligations imposed by the renewed order are
necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting involvement by the
controlled person in terrorism-related activity. Subsection (7) makes further provi-
sion about the time from which the 12 month renewal period will begin to run.
Subsection (8) states that the instrument renewing a non-derogating order must
specify the expiry date of the renewed order.
Subsection (9)
31. Subsection (9) provides that obligations may be imposed as part of control orders
in order to prevent involvement in any terrorism-related activity, not just the activ-
ity which gave rise to the grounds for the Secretary of State’s suspicion that the
controlled person was or had been involved in terrorism-related activity.
Section 3: Supervision by court of making of non-derogating
control orders
Subsection (1)
32. Subsection (1) provides that the Secretary of State can only make a non-derogating
control order if:
(a) he has been granted permission to do so by the court;
(b) he has made, and included in the control order, a statement saying that the
urgency of the case required him to make the control order without permission
from the court; or,
(c) the order is made before 14 March 2005 against an individual who, at the time
it is made, is certiﬁed under section 21(1) of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and
Security Act 2001 (c. 24).
Subsections (2) to (4)
33. Subsection (2) provides that when the Secretary of State applies to the court for
permission to make a non-derogating control order against an individual, the court
must decide if the Secretary of State’s decision that there are grounds to make the
order is obviously ﬂawed. If it determines that the decision is not obviously
ﬂawed it will give its permission for the order to be made, and give directions for a
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

full hearing to take place to consider the order as soon as reasonably practicable
after it is made. Subsection (3) says that if the Secretary of State makes a control
order without permission from the court, he must refer it to the court immediately.
Subsection (4) states that the court must begin considering such a reference not
later than seven days after the day on which the control order was made.
Subsections (5), (6) and (8)
34. Subsection (5) provides that the ﬁrst hearings in connection with non-derogating
control orders, in which the court will decide whether to grant permission for the
order to be made or will consider the Secretary of State’s decision to impose
the order without the court’s permission, may be ex parte and may take place
without the knowledge of the person upon whom the control order will be made.
Subsection (6) explains that, in initial hearings on control orders made without the
court’s permission, the court will consider if the Secretary of State’s decision to
impose the order was obviously ﬂawed. If it determines that the decision was
obviously ﬂawed, the court will quash the order; if it determines that it was not, but
that the decision to impose a particular obligation was obviously ﬂawed, it must
quash that obligation; in all other cases, it must conﬁrm the order and give direc-
tions for a full hearing in relation to the control order to take place. Subsection (8)
provides that, in initial hearings on control orders made without the court’s per-
mission, the court may quash the certiﬁcate which the Secretary of State included
in the control order stating that the urgency of the case required that the order be
made without ﬁrst seeking permission from the court.
Subsection (7)
35. Subsection (7) provides that when the court gives directions for a full hearing
in connection with a non-derogating control order to take place, it must make
arrangements for the individual in question to be given an opportunity to make
representations about the directions already given or the making of further
directions, within seven days of the court’s decision.
Subsections (10) and (11)
36. Subsection (10) explains that in a full hearing on a non-derogating control order,
the court will determine whether any of the following decisions of the Secretary of
State was ﬂawed:
(a) his decision that he had reasonable grounds for suspecting that the controlled
person was or had been involved in terrorism-related activity and his decision
that the control order was necessary for purposes connected with protecting
members of the public from a risk of terrorism;
(b) his decision to impose each of the obligations in the control order.
37. Subsection (11) states that in considering the matters coming before it in relation to
non-derogating control orders, the court must apply the principles applicable on an
application for judicial review.

Subsections (12) to (14)
38. Subsections (12) and (13) explain that, in a full hearing on a non-derogating control
order, if the court decides that a decision of the Secretary of State was ﬂawed, it may:
(a) quash the control order;
(b) quash one or more of the obligations contained in the control order;
(c) give directions to the Secretary of State for him to revoke or modify the order;
(d) decide that the control order should continue in force.
39. Subsection (14) provides that the court must discontinue the full hearing on a
non-derogating control order if requested to do so by the controlled person.
Section 4: Power of the court to make derogating control orders
Subsections (1) to (4)
40. Subsection (1) provides for the court to hold an immediate preliminary hearing on
an application from the Secretary of State to decide whether to make a derogating
control order against an individual. If it determines to make such an order, it is
required to give directions for a full hearing to take place to determine whether to
conﬁrm the order, with or without modiﬁcations.
41. Subsection (2) states that the preliminary hearing may be ex parte and may take
place without the knowledge of the person upon whom the control order will
be made.
42. Subsection (3) sets out the tests which the court must consider when deciding if a
derogating control order can be made. It must appear to the court that:
(a) there is material which (if not disproved) is capable of being relied on by
the court as establishing that the individual is or has been involved in
terrorism-related activity.
(b) there are reasonable grounds for believing that the obligations in the control
order are necessary for purposes connected with protecting members of the
public from a risk of terrorism.
(c) the risk in question arises out of or is associated with a public emergency in
respect of which there is a designated derogation from all or part of Article 5
of the ECHR.
(d) that the obligations in the control order are of a description set out in the
designation order.
43. Subsection (4) provides that the obligations the court may impose between the time
when the order is made and the time when the court makes its determination at the
full hearing include any obligations which it has reasonable grounds for believing to
be necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting involvement by
the controlled person in terrorism-related activity.
Subsection (5) to (7)
44. Subsection (5) provides that, at a full hearing on a derogating control order, the
court may conﬁrm or revoke the control order. If it revokes the order, it may direct
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

that the order be treated as having been quashed under the terms of this Act.
Subsection (6) states that, when conﬁrming a derogating control order, the court
may modify the obligations imposed by the order and direct that the obligation be
treated as having been quashed under the terms of this Act.
45. Subsection (7) explains the tests which the court must apply when considering
whether to conﬁrm a derogating control order at a full hearing. It can only conﬁrm
the order if:
(a) it is satisﬁed on the balance of probabilities that the person is or has been
involved in terrorism-related activities;
(b) it considers that the imposition of a control order is necessary for
purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of
terrorism;
(c) it appears to the court that the risk arises out of or is associated with a public
emergency in respect of which there is a designated derogation from all or part
of Article 5; and
(d) the obligation(s) are of a description set out in the designation order.
Subsections (8) to (13)
46. Subsection (8) provides that a derogating control order will last six months, unless
it ceases to have eﬀect either because it is revoked or because it would otherwise
continue beyond the period provided for in section 6 (ie there has been no order
within the relevant period conﬁrming that it continues to be necessary for the
Secretary of State to have the power to impose derogating obligations). It can also
continue for more than six months if the court renews it. The renewal procedure is
described in subsection (9).
47. As subsection (10) explains, when the court is considering whether to renew a
derogating control order on an application from the Secretary of State, it may only
do so if:
(a) the court considers that it is necessary for the derogating control order to
continue in force for purposes connected with protecting members of the
public from a risk of terrorism;
(b) it appears to the court that the risk arises out of or is associated with a public
emergency in respect of which there is a designated derogation from all or part
of Article 5 ECHR;
(c) the obligations are of a description that continues to be set out in a designation
order; and,
(d) the court considers that the obligations imposed in the renewed order are
necessary for purposes connected with preventing or restricting the controlled
person’s involvement in terrorism-related activity.
48. Subsection (11) provides that the court may extend a control order in order to allow
it to continue to operate while proceedings on an application for renewal take place.
Subection (12) notes that if a control order is extended under subsection (11) the
renewed control order will be valid for six months from the date at which the order
would have ceased to have eﬀect.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
845
 

49. Subsection (13) states that obligations may be imposed as part of a control order in
order to prevent involvement in any terrorism-related activity, not just the activity
which led the court to conclude that the individual was or had been involved in
terrorism-related activity.
Section 5: Arrest and detention pending derogating control order
Subsections (1) to (6)
50. Subsections (1) to (4) provide for the arrest and detention of an individual in
respect of whom the Secretary of State is seeking a derogating control order.
He may be arrested and detained for 48 hours in the ﬁrst instance, with the possibil-
ity of the court extending the detention for a further 48 hours. A constable
may arrest someone under this section if the Secretary of State has applied to the
court for a derogating control order to be made and the constable considers that
the individual’s arrest and detention are necessary to ensure the individual is
able to receive notice of the order when it is made. The constable must take the
arrested individual to an appropriate ‘designated place’ (as deﬁned in paragraph
1(1) of Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000). If it considers it necessary to ensure
that the individual is available to receive any notice, the court may during the
ﬁrst 48 hours of such detention, extend the period of detention for up to a further
48 hours. Subsection (5) provides that the power of detention shall cease once
a person becomes bound by a derogating control order (ie once it has been served)
or once the court dismisses the application from the Secretary of State. Subsection
(6) provides that an individual who has the powers of a constable in one part
of the UK can exercise the power of arrest under this section in any part of
the UK.

Act 2001
Explanatory notes
Introduction
1.
These Explanatory Notes relate to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001
which received Royal Assent on 14 December 2001. They have been prepared by
the Home Oﬃce, Her Majesty’s Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry,
the Ministry of Defence, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the
Regions and the Foreign and Commonwealth Oﬃce, in order to assist the reader of
the Act and to help inform debate on it. They do not form part of the Act and have
not been endorsed by Parliament.
2.
The notes need to be read in conjunction with the Act. They are not, and are not
meant to be, a comprehensive description of the Act. So where a section or part of
a section does not seem to require any explanation, none is given.

Summary and background
3.
The purpose of this Act is to build on legislation in a number of areas to ensure
that the Government, in the light of the new situation arising from the September 11
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, have the necessary powers to
counter the threat to the UK. The measures are intended to:
•
Cut oﬀ terrorist funding
•
Ensure that government departments and agencies can collect and share
information required for countering the terrorist threat
•
Streamline relevant immigration procedures
•
Ensure the security of the nuclear and aviation industries
•
Improve the security of dangerous substances that may be targeted or used by
terrorists
•
Extend police powers available to relevant forces
•
Ensure that we can meet our European obligations in the area of police and
judicial co-operation and our international obligations to counter bribery
and corruption
•
Update parts of the UK’s anti-terrorist powers.
Overview
4.
The Act is in 14 Parts.
Terrorist property
5.
Part 1 and Schedules 1 and 2 of the Act contain provisions to prevent terrorists from
gaining access to their money. They complement provisions in the new Proceeds of
Crime Bill and ensure that investigative and freezing powers are available wherever
funds could be used to ﬁnance terrorism.
6. The introduction of account monitoring orders enable the police to require ﬁnan-
cial institutions to provide information on accounts for up to 90 days. The existing
requirement to report knowledge or suspicion of terrorist ﬁnancing has been
strengthened, for the regulated sector, so that it is an oﬀence not to report where
there were ‘reasonable grounds’ for suspicion.
7. The Act gives law enforcement agencies the power to seize terrorist cash anywhere
in the UK, and the power to freeze assets at the start of an investigation, rather
than when the person is about to be charged, reducing the risk that funds will be
used or moved before they can be frozen.
Freezing orders
8. Part 2 creates a new power which enables the Treasury to freeze the assets of
overseas governments or residents who have taken, or are likely to take, action to
the detriment of the UK’s economy or action constituting a threat to the life or
property of a national or resident of the UK. The Treasury’s previous power to
freeze assets, contained in the 1964 Act, is repealed.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
847
 

Disclosure of information
9. Part 3 and Schedule 4 of the Act deal with information disclosure provisions for
public authorities.
10. Section 17 clariﬁes and extends a number of existing provisions for disclosure of
information from public authorities to agencies involved in criminal investigations
and proceedings. The gateways ensure that public authorities can disclose informa-
tion which is subject to a statutory restriction on disclosure for the purposes of a
criminal investigation or criminal proceedings.
11. Section 19 creates a new gateway giving HM Customs and Excise and the Inland
Revenue a general power to disclose information held by them for law enforcement
purposes and to the intelligence services for their purposes.
Immigration and asylum
12. Part 4, sections 21 to 32 (‘Suspected international terrorists’) allows the detention
of those the Secretary of State has certiﬁed as threats to national security and who
are suspected of being international terrorists where their removal is not possible at
the present time. Such detention would be subject to regular independent review by
the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). These provisions change
the current law, which allows detention with a view to removal only where removal
is a realistic option within a reasonable period of time. The detention powers will
cease to have eﬀect on 10 November 2006.
13. It is also intended to speed up the asylum process for suspected terrorists. The Act
excludes substantive consideration of asylum claims where the Secretary of State
certiﬁes that their removal would be conducive to the public good. This would not
be in breach of the 1951 Refugee Convention because they are excluded from the
protection of that Convention.
14. It also prevents judicial review of decisions of the SIAC, which is the body that
deals with suspected terrorists’ appeals against immigration decisions: it has three
members hearing an appeal, one of whom holds or has held high judicial oﬃce
and another of whom is or has been an immigration judge. The Act makes SIAC
a superior court of record. There remains an avenue of appeal from SIAC to the
Court of Appeal on a point of law.
15. The Act allows for the retention, for 10 years, of ﬁngerprints taken in asylum and
certain immigration cases. This helps prevent applicants who have had their case
resolved from re-applying and creating multiple identities, which can be used in the
perpetration of terrorism or other serious crimes.
Race and religion
16. Part 5 of the Act extends the racially aggravated oﬀences contained in the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to cover oﬀences aggravated by religious hostility.
It amends the provisions in the Public Order Act 1986 concerning incitement
to racial hatred to include cases where the hatred is directed against groups abroad,
and increases the maximum penalty for such oﬀences from two to seven years’
imprisonment.

Weapons of mass destruction
17. Part 6 of the Act strengthens current legislation controlling chemical, nuclear and
biological weapons.
Control of pathogens and toxins
18. The provisions set out in Part 7 (and Schedules 5 and 6) places an obligation on
managers of laboratories and other premises holding stocks of speciﬁed disease-
causing micro-organisms and toxins to notify their holdings, and to comply with
any reasonable security requirements which the police may impose.
19. It also requires managers of laboratories and other premises, on request, to furnish
the police with details of people with access to the dangerous substances held there.
The Secretary of State is given power to direct that a named individual must not be
allowed access to such disease strains or the premises in which they are held.
Nuclear security
20. The provisions in Part 8 reinforce and update the regulatory regime for security in
the nuclear industry.
21. They also extend the jurisdiction for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
Constabulary (AEAC) so that their constables can protect nuclear sites and nuclear
material more eﬀectively. They are now able to be deployed in all civil licensed
nuclear sites, rather than at present only on premises of speciﬁed nuclear operators,
and within ﬁve kilometres of such sites.
22. They also strengthen sanctions against the unauthorised disclosure of sensitive
information on the security of nuclear sites, nuclear material and proliferation-
sensitive nuclear technology.
Aviation security
23. Part 9 improves enforcement of aviation security requirements and the ability of
the police, Government Inspectors, and the aviation industry, to handle potentially
dangerous situations at airports and on board aircraft. It includes provisions in
respect of dealing with unauthorised persons in airports and on aircraft; enables
the detention of aircraft if there are serious security concerns; introduces enabling
legislation for the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government & the
Regions to ‘list’ providers of aviation security services; and introduces a new
oﬀence of falsely claiming to be a security approved air cargo agent.
24. Part 9 amends existing legislation, in particular the Aviation Security Act 1982, the
Civil Aviation Act 1982 and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
Police powers
25. In a small group of cases detainees in police custody will refuse to co-operate with
the police as to their identity. Part 10 contains powers which give the police the
authority to search for identifying marks, to take ﬁngerprints of suspects solely for
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
849
 

the purpose of identifying them and to photograph suspects and where necessary
to demand the removal of facial coverings or face paint in order to take a positive
photograph. It also strengthens police powers to require the removal of face cover-
ings worn for the purpose of concealing identity and to seize any such items.
26. Sections 98 to 101 and Schedule 7 allow the British Transport Police (‘BTP’) to act
outside their railways jurisdiction when asked to assist with a speciﬁc incident by a
constable from the local police force, the UKAEA constabulary or a Ministry of
Defence Police (‘MDP’) oﬃcer, and in an emergency. The changes also give BTP
oﬃcers certain powers available to local police oﬃcers, including powers under the
Terrorism Act 2000 and powers to enter into mutual aid agreements with other
forces.
27. Similarly, the MDP is now able to act outside Ministry of Defence land when asked
to assist with a speciﬁc incident by a constable from the local police force, the BTP
or the UKAEA constabulary, and in an emergency. The changes allow MDP to
provide assistance, on request, to other forces, and extend to them certain powers in
the Terrorism Act 2000.
Retention of communications data
28. Part 11 contains provisions facilitating the retention by communications providers
of data about their customers’ communications for national security purposes
so that they can be accessed by the security, intelligence and law enforcement
agencies by means of a statutory code of practice to be drawn up in consultation
with industry and the Information Commissioner and approved by Parliament by
aﬃrmative resolution procedure.
29. The Act ensures that data which communications service providers would other-
wise be obliged to erase when it is no longer needed for billing purposes may be
retained if it is necessary to safeguard national security or to prevent, detect or
prosecute crimes related to national security.
30. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Part 1, Chapter 2) sets out limits
on the purposes for which the security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies
may request access to data relating to speciﬁc communications. These provisions
complement the 2000 Act by clarifying the lawful basis for the retention of data by
communications service providers. They do not aﬀect the access framework and
safeguards set out in RIPA.
31. There is also a reserve power to review the voluntary arrangements under the code
of practice and issue directions if necessary. If still needed, it must be renewed by
an aﬃrmative order every two years, unless the power is exercised.
Bribery and corruption
32. Part 12 brings in provisions to strengthen the law on international corruption. The
sections put beyond doubt that the law of bribery applies to acts involving oﬃcials
of foreign public bodies, Ministers, MPs and judges; and to ‘agents’ (within the
meaning of the 1906 Act) of foreign ‘principals’. They give courts jurisdiction over
crimes of bribery committed by UK nationals and UK incorporated bodies over-
seas. There is also a technical provision, to ensure that the existing presumption
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
850
 
www.ebook3000.com

of corruption in the Prevention of Corruption Act 1916, which it is intended to
abolish, does not apply any more widely as a result of these new provisions.
Miscellaneous
33. Measures on police and criminal judicial co-operation agreed by the JHA Council
of the EU (third pillar) can currently only be implemented in the UK by primary
legislation. This section will enable speciﬁed measures, that are closely related to
the EU’s anti-terrorism action plan, to be implemented by secondary legislation by
the aﬃrmative resolution procedure. Measures agreed on European Community
matters (for example the environment or the internal market) can already be
implemented by secondary legislation.
34. Part 13 also contains measures relating to the use or threatened use of noxious
substances, (including biological agents or toxins, toxic chemicals or radioactive
material) for terrorist and other similar purposes.
35. It introduces a new oﬀence of hoaxing involving apparently noxious substances.
36. Provisions amending the Intelligence Services Act 1994 introduce greater ﬂexibility
for intelligence gathering outside the British Islands and adapt the scope and
deﬁnition of serious crime. They achieve this through extending the powers of
GCHQ.
37. The Act reintroduces the oﬀence of a general failure to disclose information about
terrorism. Such an oﬀence in relation to Northern Ireland was previously con-
tained in the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. The new
provision will extend the provision to domestic and international terrorism.
38. The Act amends Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000 to include internal journeys.
It equalises provisions to stop, detain and search people who journey internally
with those travelling to and from the UK and Common Travel Area.
39. It gives a power to require carriers to supply information about passengers and
freight to enforcement agencies and allow sharing between the agencies. Details
of the information that carriers will be required to provide is to be decided in
secondary legislation.
Supplemental
40. Part 14 includes provision for review of the Act, for consequential and supplemen-
tary provision to be made by secondary legislation, and for the commencement and
extent of the Act.
Commentary on sections
Part 1: Terrorist property
Section 1 Forfeiture of terrorist cash
41. Section 1 introduces Schedule 1, which expands and replaces the current provisions
in the Terrorism Act 2000 for the seizure and forfeiture of terrorist cash at the
borders in civil proceedings.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
851
 

42. Terrorist cash is cash which is intended to be used for the purposes of terrorism,
cash which consists of the resources of a proscribed organisation or cash which
is or represents property obtained through terrorism. ‘Terrorism’ and ‘proscribed
organisation’ are deﬁned in paragraph 19 of Schedule 1. Property obtained
through terrorism is deﬁned as property obtained by or in return for acts of terror-
ism or by or in return for acts carried out for the purposes of terrorism (paragraph
11(1) of Schedule 1).
43. Subsection (2) makes it clear that the powers of seizure and forfeiture are exercis-
able whether or not any criminal proceedings have been brought for an oﬀence in
connection with the cash.
44. Schedule 14 to the Terrorism Act 2000 (as amended by section 2 to the Act) pro-
vides for a code of practice to be made in relation to the operation of powers
under Schedule 1 to this Act. The code is subject to a consultation process and
to the aﬃrmative resolution procedure. Subsection (5) of section 1 provides that,
in this instance, the modiﬁcations to the existing code may be made in the order
commencing Schedule 1.
Section 2 Amendments relating to section 1
45. Subsections (1) to (3) amend the Access to Justice Act 1999 so that Community
Legal Service funding is available for proceedings under Schedule 1.
46. Subsections (4) to (7) amend Schedule 14 to the Terrorism Act 2000 so that it
applies to Schedule 1 to this Act.
47. Subsection (8) amends the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern
Ireland) Order 1981 so that legal aid is available for proceedings under
Schedule 1.
Section 3 Terrorist property: amendments
48. Section 3 introduces Schedule 2 to this Act.
Part 2: Freezing orders
49. Part 2 contains measures to allow the United Kingdom to take action to freeze the
assets of overseas persons or governments who are threatening the economic inter-
ests of the United Kingdom or the life or property of United Kingdom nationals
or residents.
50. These provisions allow the United Kingdom to impose sanctions in cases of
urgency, where neither the United Nations nor the European Union has yet agreed
a course of action, or in cases where it is appropriate for the United Kingdom to
impose sanctions unilaterally.
The provisions replace section 2 of the Emergency Laws (Re-enactments and
Repeals) Act 1964. Under that section, the United Kingdom can freeze the assets
of an overseas government and overseas residents if the country or the persons in
question is (or are) acting to the detriment of the United Kingdom economy.
Under the provisions in this Act, the Treasury is able to freeze the assets of overseas
governments or residents, including of groups or individuals, when there is a threat
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
852
 
www.ebook3000.com

to the United Kingdom economy or to the life or property of United Kingdom
nationals or residents.
Orders
Section 4 Power to make order
51. This section allows the Treasury to make a freezing order if two conditions are
satisﬁed. First, the Treasury must reasonably believe that action threatening the
United Kingdom’s economy (or part of it) or the life or property of United
Kingdom nationals or residents has taken place or is likely to take place. Secondly,
the persons involved in the action must be resident outside the United Kingdom
or be an overseas government.
Section 5 Contents of order
52. A freezing order prohibits all persons in the United Kingdom, and all persons
elsewhere who are United Kingdom nationals, bodies incorporated in the United
Kingdom or Scottish partnerships from making funds available to or for the beneﬁt
of a person or persons speciﬁed in the order. The order may specify the persons
taking the action referred to in section 4 and any person who has provided or is
likely to provide assistance (directly or indirectly) to those persons. The speciﬁca-
tion may be by name or by description of persons set out in the order. Where a
person is speciﬁed by description, the description must be such that a reasonable
person would know whether he fell within it.
Section 6 Contents: further provisions
This section introduces Schedule 3, which makes further provision about the contents
of freezing orders.
Section 7 Review of order
53. This section requires the Treasury to keep under review whether any freezing order
should be kept in force or amended.
Section 8 Duration of order
54. This section speciﬁes that a freezing order lapses two years after it was made.
Interpretation
Section 9 Nationals and residents
55. This section sets out the persons who are nationals or residents of the United
Kingdom for the purposes of this Part. It also sets out who is a resident of a
country outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of this Part.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M

Orders: procedure etc.
Section 10 Procedure for making freezing orders
56. A freezing order must be made by statutory instrument. The order must be laid
before Parliament and ceases to have eﬀect after 28 days unless it is approved by
each House of Parliament.
Section 11 Procedure for making certain amending orders
57. This section applies where a freezing order has already been made. Where a further
order speciﬁes additional persons of the same description as those speciﬁed in the
original order, or amends the order to specify fewer persons, it is instead subject to
the negative resolution procedure.
Section 12 Procedure for revoking orders
58. This section provides that an order revoking a freezing order (without-re-enacting
it) is subject to the negative resolution procedure.
Section 13 De-hybridisation
59. This section provides that an order that would otherwise be treated as hybrid under
Parliament’s standing orders is not to be subject to the special procedure for hybrid
instruments.
Section 14 Orders: supplementary
60. This section provides that a power under the Part to make a freezing order or an
order amending or revoking a freezing order may be exercised so as to make diﬀer-
ent provision for diﬀerent purposes. A freezing order or an order amending or
revoking one may also include supplementary, incidental, saving or transitional
provisions. Nothing in this Part aﬀects the generality of this power.
Miscellaneous
Section 15 The Crown
61. Freezing orders bind the Crown and Crown servants, but the Crown is not crimin-
ally liable for breaches of freezing orders. The orders do not bind the Queen in Her
personal capacity.
Section 16 Repeals
62. This section repeals the Treasury’s existing power to freeze assets under section 2
of the Emergency Laws (Re-enactments and Repeals) Act 1964. The repeal of
section 2 does not aﬀect any references to that provision in other subordinate
legislation.

Part 3: Disclosure of information
Section 17 Extension of existing disclosure powers
63. This section clariﬁes and extends a number of information disclosure provisions
available to public authorities. The powers are listed in Schedule 4. It permits
disclosure to assist any criminal investigation or criminal proceedings being carried
out in the UK or abroad or to facilitate determinations of whether or not such
investigations or proceedings should begin or end. The section does not limit any
power to disclose that exists apart from this section. In determining whether they
may disclose information, public authorities must ensure that their disclosure is
proportionate to that which is intended by disclosing.
Section 18 Restriction on disclosure of information for overseas purposes
64. This section enables the Secretary of State to prohibit the disclosure of information
for the purposes of overseas criminal investigations or criminal proceedings that
would otherwise be permitted by section 17 or without section 17 by the provisions
modiﬁed by that section. This power may be exercised where it appears to him that
the overseas investigation or proceeding relates to a matter in respect of which it
would be more appropriate for any jurisdiction or investigation to be exercised or
carried out by the authorities of the United Kingdom or a third country.
65. Any person who knowingly makes a disclosure prohibited by the Secretary of State
pursuant to section 18 will be guilty of an oﬀence. The person will be liable on
conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term of up to two years or a ﬁne or
to both, and on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term of up to three
months or a ﬁne of up to the statutory maximum (which is currently set at £5000).
Section 19 Disclosure of information held by revenue departments
66. This section applies to information held by or for the Commissioners of the Inland
Revenue and Customs and Excise Departments. The section provides that no
obligation of secrecy, excepting the Data Protection Act 1998 requirements, pre-
vents the voluntary disclosure of information on the authority of the relevant
Commissioners made for the following purposes: to assist any criminal investiga-
tion or criminal proceedings being carried out in the UK or abroad or to facilitate
whether or not such investigations or proceedings should begin or end. In addition,
the section allows for disclosure to the intelligence services (the Security Service,
the Secret Intelligence Service and GCHQ) in support of their functions. These
functions include the protection of national security and the prevention and
detection of serious crime.
67. Disclosed information cannot be further disclosed by the recipient except for the
purposes permitted for original disclosures and with the consent of the relevant
Commissioners. Bodies who receive information from Customs and the Inland
Revenue may not further disclose that information to the intelligence services
except for the purposes of criminal investigations or proceedings. The section does
not limit any power to disclose that exists apart from this section. In determining
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
855
 

whether they may disclose information, public authorities must ensure that their
disclosure is proportionate to that which is intended by disclosing.

Introduction
1.
These explanatory notes relate to the Terrorism Act 2000, which received Royal
Assent on 20 July 2000. They have been prepared by the Home Oﬃce and the
Northern Ireland Oﬃce in order to assist the reader in understanding the Act.
They do not form part of the Act and have not been endorsed by Parliament.
2.
The notes need to be read in conjunction with the Act. They are not, and are not
meant to be, a comprehensive description of the Act. So where a section or part of
a section does not seem to require any explanation or comment none is given.
Summary
3.
The Act reforms and extends previous counter-terrorist legislation, and puts it
largely on a permanent basis. The previous legislation concerned is:
•
the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (c. 4) (‘the
PTA’);
•
the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 (c. 22) (‘the EPA’); and
•
sections 1 to 4 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998
(c. 40).
4.
The Act builds on the proposals in the Government’s consultation document Legis-
lation against terrorism (Cm 4178), published in December 1998. The consultation
document in turn responded to Lord Lloyd of Berwick’s Inquiry into legislation
against terrorism (Cm 3420), published in October 1996.
5.
Previous counter-terrorist legislation provided a range of measures designed to
prevent terrorism and support the investigation of terrorist crime. These fall into
three broad categories: a power for the Secretary of State to proscribe terrorist
organisations, backed up by a series of oﬀences connected with such organisations
(membership, fundraising etc); other speciﬁc oﬀences connected with terrorism
(such as fund-raising for terrorist purposes, training in the use of ﬁrearms for
terrorist purposes, etc); and a range of police powers (powers of investigation,
arrest, stop and search, detention, etc).
6.
The Act repeals the PTA and re-enacts those of its provisions which remain neces-
sary, with a number of modiﬁcations. The previous counter-terrorist legislation was
subject to annual renewal by Parliament. Under the Act this will in general no
longer be the case. The main provisions in the Act are to be permanent. There will,
however, continue to be an annual report to Parliament on the working of the Act;
this is required under section 126.
7.
The EPA would have repealed itself on 24 August 2000. The consultation docu-
ment expressed the Government’s hope that the special provision it makes for
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

Northern Ireland might not be needed after that date, an objective to be kept under
review in the light of developments in the security situation. The Government takes
the view that the time is not yet right to remove all of these provisions. Part VII of
the Act therefore provides additional temporary measures for Northern Ireland
only. These are subject to annual renewal and are time-limited to 5 years.
8.
The previous counter-terrorist legislation was originally designed in response to
terrorism connected with the aﬀairs of Northern Ireland (‘Irish terrorism’), and
some of its provisions had subsequently been extended to certain categories of
international terrorism. It did not apply to any other terrorism connected with UK
aﬀairs (‘domestic terrorism’). Under the Act these restrictions have been lifted, so
that counter-terrorist measures are to be applicable to all forms of terrorism: Irish,
international, and domestic.
Overview
9.
The Act’s Parts and Schedules are as follows.
•
Part I (Introductory) sets out the deﬁnition of terrorism for the purposes of the
Act, repeals the PTA and, with Schedule 1, deals with the continuation of
certain temporary provisions of the EPA until Part VII of the Act is brought
into force.
•
Part II (Proscribed organisations) provides a power for the Secretary of State
to proscribe organisations and sets out the associated oﬀences. Schedule 2 lists
the organisations which are currently proscribed and Schedule 3 details the
functions of the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission (POAC) which
the Act sets up.
•
Part III (Terrorist property) provides oﬀences relating to fund-raising and
other kinds of ﬁnancial support for terrorism, together with power for a court
to order forfeiture of any money or other property connected with the oﬀences.
Schedule 4 gives details of forfeiture procedures.
•
Part IV (Terrorist investigations) provides the police with a power to set up
cordons. Schedule 5 sets out further powers to investigate terrorism by search-
ing premises and seeking explanation of items found; and Schedule 6 provides
a power to investigate terrorist ﬁnance based on an existing Northern Ireland
power to investigate proceeds of crime.
•
Part V (Counter-terrorist powers) provides the police with powers to arrest and
detain suspected terrorists, and broader powers to stop and search vehicles and
pedestrians, and to impose parking restrictions. Schedule 7 provides examin-
ation powers at ports and borders; and Schedule 8 provides for the treatment
of suspects who are detained and for judicial extension of the initial period of
detention.
•
Part VI (Miscellaneous) provides ancillary oﬀences of
•
weapons training for terrorist purposes, including recruitment for such
training,
•
directing a terrorist organisation,
•
possessing articles for terrorist purposes,
•
possessing information for terrorist purposes, and
•
incitement of overseas terrorism.

857
 

Part VI also includes provisions on extraterritorial jurisdiction and extradition
which will enable the UK to ratify the UN Conventions for the Suppression of
Terrorist Bombings and for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
•
Part VII (Northern Ireland) provides for the system of non-jury trials in
Northern Ireland for the oﬀences listed in Schedule 9. Together with Schedules
10–13, this Part also provides additional police and Army powers for Northern
Ireland, and regulates the private security industry in Northern Ireland.
•
Part VIII (General) contains further technical provisions and includes a list
of terms deﬁned in the Act. Schedule 14 provides general powers for police,
customs and immigration oﬃcers including powers for them to exchange
information. Schedules 15 and 16 list consequential amendments and repeals.
Commentary
Part I: Introductory
Section 1: Terrorism: interpretation
10. Under the PTA, terrorism ‘means the use of violence for political ends, and
includes any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of
the public in fear’ (section 20). The deﬁnition in the PTA is limited in that the
powers and oﬀences in that Act only apply to terrorism connected with the aﬀairs
of Northern Ireland (‘Irish terrorism’) or Irish and international terrorism. The
Act, as suggested in the consultation document, adopts a wider deﬁnition, recog-
nising that terrorism may have religious or ideological as well as political moti-
vation, and covering actions which might not be violent in themselves but which can,
in a modern society, have a devastating impact. These could include interfering
with the supply of water or power where life, health or safety may be put at risk.
Subsection (2)(e) covers the disrupting of key computer systems. Subsection (3)
provides that where action involves ﬁrearms or explosives, it does not have to be
designed to inﬂuence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of
the public to be included in the deﬁnition. This is to ensure that, for instance, the
assassination of key individuals is covered.
11. Subsection (4) provides for the deﬁnition to cover terrorism not only within the
United Kingdom but throughout the world. This is implicit in the PTA deﬁnition
but the Act makes it explicit.
Section 2: Temporary legislation
12. Subsection (1) repeals the PTA and EPA. Subsection (2), together with Schedule 1,
preserves certain provisions of the EPA, in some cases with amendment, until the
date on which Part VII (Northern Ireland) of the Act is brought into force: see
further notes on Schedule 1 below.

Part II: Proscribed organisations
13. Part II is based on Part I of the PTA (which has eﬀect in Great Britain only) and
on sections 30–31 of the EPA (which have eﬀect in Northern Ireland only). The
proscription regime under the Act diﬀers from those it replaces as follows:
•
The PTA and EPA provide separate proscription regimes for Great Britain
and Northern Ireland. Under the Act proscription will no longer be speciﬁc
to Northern Ireland or Great Britain, but will apply throughout the whole of
the UK.
•
Under the PTA and EPA proscription is only applicable to organisations con-
cerned in Irish terrorism. Under the Act it will also be possible to proscribe
organisations concerned in international or domestic terrorism.
•
Under the PTA and EPA an organisation or an aﬀected individual wishing to
challenge a proscription can only do so in the UK via judicial review (no
proscribed organisation has ever done this). Under the Act, organisations and
individuals will be able to apply to the Secretary of State for deproscription
and, if their application is refused, to appeal to the Proscribed Organisations
Appeal Commission (‘POAC’; see below).
Section 3: Proscription
14. Schedule 2 lists all organisations proscribed under the PTA and the EPA at the
time the Act received Royal Assent. Some organisations were at that point pro-
scribed in Northern Ireland under the EPA but not in Great Britain under the
PTA. Under the Act, any organisation deemed to merit proscription will be
proscribed throughout the whole of the UK. The Government is considering which
organisations involved in international terrorism might be added to the Schedule.
15. The power to proscribe and deproscribe in subsection (3), including deproscription
following a successful appeal, will be subject to the aﬃrmative resolution procedure.
Sections 4–6: Deproscription: application and appeals
16. These sections set out the route by which an organisation which thinks it should
not be proscribed, or an aﬀected individual, may seek a remedy. The ﬁrst step is
to ask the Secretary of State to deproscribe; the Secretary of State will be obliged
to consider such applications within a period of time speciﬁed in regulations to be
made under subsection (3) of section 4. If the Secretary of State refuses to depro-
scribe, then the organisation or individual may appeal to POAC as set out in
section 5 and Schedule 3.
17. The grounds on which POAC will allow an appeal are set out in subsection (3) of
section 5. The reference to ‘the principles applicable on an application for judicial
review’ allows that once the Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) is fully in force, it
will be possible for an appellant to raise points concerning those rights under
the European Convention on Human Rights which are ‘Convention rights’ under
the 1998 Act.
18. Subsections (4)–(5) of section 5 deal with the consequences of an appeal to POAC
being successful. Where POAC makes an order, this has the eﬀect of requiring the
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
859
 

Secretary of State either to lay a draft deproscription order before Parliament or to
make a deproscription order on the basis of the urgency procedure (see below).
19. Section 6 allows a further appeal from a decision of POAC on a question of law.
Sections 7–8: Appeal: eﬀect on conviction
20. If an appeal to POAC is successful, and an order has been made deproscribing the
organisation, anyone convicted of one of the oﬀences listed in subsection (1)(c)
in respect of the organisation, so long as the oﬀence was committed after the
date of the refusal to deproscribe, may, in England and Wales, appeal against his
conviction to the Court of Appeal or Crown Court, and the Court will allow the
appeal. Subsection (8) ensures that he can seek compensation for the conviction.
Corresponding provision is made for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Section 9: Human Rights Act 1998
21. Since it is intended that the Lord Chancellor will make rules under section 7(2) of
the Human Rights Act so that proceedings under section 7(1)(a) of that Act may be
brought before POAC, this section of the Act applies provisions in the Act relating
to appeals to POAC to such proceedings under the Human Rights Act.
Section 10: Immunity
22. An individual who seeks deproscription by way of application or appeal, either on
behalf of the proscribed organisation or as a person aﬀected, might be discouraged
from pursuing either course, or from instituting proceedings under section 7 of the
Human Rights Act, by the risk of prosecution for certain oﬀences, for example
the oﬀence of membership of a proscribed organisation. This section therefore
ensures that evidence of anything done, and any document submitted for these
proceedings, cannot be relied on in criminal proceedings for such an oﬀence except
as part of the defence case.
Sections 11–12: Membership and support
23. These oﬀences are based on those in section 2 of the PTA and section 30 of the
EPA, and have similar eﬀect. The oﬀence in section 12(1) is not conﬁned to support
by providing ‘money or other property’, because that kind of support is dealt
with in Part III of the Act. Subsection (4) of section 12 is intended to permit the
arranging of genuinely benign meetings.
Section 13: Uniform
24. This section replicates the oﬀence at section 3 of the PTA and section 31 of the
EPA. The PTA version, which has eﬀect in England and Wales and in Scotland, is
summary only with a maximum custodial penalty of 6 months. The EPA version,
which has eﬀect in Northern Ireland is an either way oﬀence with a maximum
custodial penalty on indictment of 1 year. In the Act, the oﬀence is summary
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
860
 
www.ebook3000.com

only, as in the PTA. Thus in consolidating the legislation the Act aligns the
situation in Northern Ireland with that in Great Britain.
Part III: Terrorist property
25. This Part corresponds to Part III of the PTA (‘Financial assistance for terrorism’)
and was discussed in Chapter 6 of the Government’s consultation document under
the heading ‘Terrorist ﬁnance’. The name has been changed to ‘Terrorist property’
to make it clear that in the Act—just as in the PTA—the Part III oﬀences apply
not only to money but also to other property. While Part III of the PTA applies
only to Irish and certain kinds of international terrorism, Part III of the Act
applies to all forms of terrorism.
26. In addition to replicating Part III of the PTA, Part III of the Act also introduces a
new power for the police, customs oﬃcers and immigration oﬃcers to seize cash at
borders and to seek forfeiture of the cash in civil proceedings. This is modelled on
a power which already exists in Part III of the Drug Traﬃcking Act 1994 (c. 37).
Section 14: Terrorist property
27. This deﬁnition comes into play in the ‘money laundering’ oﬀence (section 18) and
the power to seize and forfeit cash at borders (sections 25 and 28). Subsection (1)
makes it clear that terrorist property can include both property to be used for
terrorism and proceeds of acts of terrorism. Subsection (2)(a) makes explicit that
the proceeds of an act of terrorism covers not only the money stolen in, say, a
terrorist robbery, but also any money paid in connection with the commission of
terrorist acts. Subsection (2)(b) makes explicit that any resources of a proscribed
organisation are covered: not only the resources they use for bomb-making, arms
purchase etc but also money they have set aside for non-violent purposes such as
paying rent.
Sections 15–17: Fundraising, use, possession and funding arrangements
28. These sections correspond to sections 9 and 10 of the PTA. By virtue of section
1(5) of the Act the words ‘for the purposes of terrorism’ can be taken to include ‘for
the beneﬁt of a proscribed organisation’. As a result, the oﬀences of fund-raising,
and using and possessing money, and entering into funding arrangements for a
proscribed organisation (section 10 of the PTA) are subsumed into these sections.
Section 18: Money laundering
29. This section corresponds to section 11 of the PTA and has the same eﬀect.
Although it is entitled ‘money laundering’ and is most likely to be used for
money, it also applies to ‘laundering’ type arrangements in respect of other
property.
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
861
 

Section 19: Disclosure of information: duty
30. This section is based on section 18A of the PTA and has the same eﬀect. It requires
banks and other businesses to report any suspicion they may have that someone is
laundering terrorist money or committing any of the other terrorist property
oﬀences in sections 15–18. Subsection (1)(b) ensures the oﬀence is focused on
suspicions which arise at work. Subsection (5) preserves the exemption in respect
of legal advisers’ privileged material.
31. Suspicions arising in home life were covered by section 18 of the PTA which the
Government has decided, following Lord Lloyd, not to replicate.
Sections 20–21: Disclosure of information: permission; co-operation
with the police
32. These sections correspond to section 12 of the PTA and have the same eﬀect.
Section 20 ensures that businesses can disclose information to the police without
fear of breaching legal restrictions. Subsection (1) of section 21 allows for the
activities of informants who may have to be involved with terrorist property if they
are not to be found out and protects others who may innocently become involved.
Subsection (2) makes it possible for someone involved with such property to avoid
prosecution by telling the police as soon as is reasonably practicable (subsection (3))
and discontinuing his involvement if asked to do so by the police (subsection (4)).
Sections 22–23: Penalties and forfeiture
33. Section 22 corresponds to section 13(1) of the PTA and has the same eﬀect.
Section 23 is based on section 13(2) of the PTA and has similar eﬀect subject to one
substantive modiﬁcation. Subsection (6) allows for forfeiture of the proceeds of a
terrorist property oﬀence. This could arise in a case where an accountant prepared
accounts on behalf of a proscribed organisation—thus facilitating the retention or
control of the organisation’s money—and was paid for doing so. The money he
received in payment could not be forfeited under section 13(2) of the PTA because
it was not intended or suspected for use in terrorism. It could not be conﬁscated
under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (c. 33) because that conﬁscation regime
excludes terrorist property oﬀences. Subsection (6) closes this loophole between the
conﬁscation scheme in the 1988 Act and the counter-terrorist forfeiture scheme.
Sections 24–31: Seizure, detention and forfeiture of terrorist
cash at borders
34. These sections are based on sections 42–48 of the Drug Traﬃcking Act 1994
(c. 37) which relate to drug traﬃcking money imported or exported in cash. The
main diﬀerence (apart from applying the powers to terrorist rather than drug
traﬃcking cash) is that the powers in the Drug Traﬃcking Act only apply to cash
being taken across the UK’s external borders, while those in the Act also apply to
cash being taken from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and vice versa. As with
drug traﬃcking, no criminal conviction is required.

Section 24: Interpretation
35. Subsection (1) allows the power to seize cash to be exercised by any of the agencies
operating at borders: police, customs and immigration. This is to allow for the
event that a customs or immigration oﬃcer is the ﬁrst to ﬁnd the cash. However, it
is expected that for the most part the power will be exercised by the police. The
deﬁnition of cash in subsection (2) is intended to cover the most readily realisable
monetary instruments used by terrorists; the order-making power in subsection
(2)(e) will enable the Secretary of State to add further monetary instruments as the
need arises.
Section 25: Seizure and detention
36. Once cash has been seized, then under this section it can be detained for up to
48 hours. During that time the authorities must either seek continued detention or
forfeiture. If neither of these occurs during the ﬁrst 48 hours, the cash will be
returned.
Sections 26–27: Continued detention of cash
37. A magistrate can allow continued detention for up to 3 months under subsection
(2)(b) of section 26. A further application can be granted after the 3 months
has expired, and so on, up to a maximum of two years (subsection (4)). In
section 27, subsection (1) provides for any interest accruing on the cash, and
subsections (2)–(5) for application to the court for a direction that the cash be
released.
Sections 28–29: Forfeiture and appeal
38. This section provides for civil forfeiture proceedings in relation to the seized
cash. Evidence that the cash is terrorist property is required to the civil standard
(subsection (2) of section 28); proceedings for a criminal oﬀence are not needed
(subsection (4)) and the proceedings themselves are civil as opposed to criminal.
Appeals must be lodged within 30 days, and the route of appeal is in England
and Wales to the Crown Court; in Northern Ireland to the county court; and in
Scotland to the Court of Session. A successful appeal will result in the cash being
paid back, together with any accrued interest.
39. Subsections (6)–(7) provide for the situation where an organisation is depro-
scribed following a successful appeal to POAC, and a forfeiture order has been
made in reliance (in whole or in part) on the fact that the organisation was pro-
scribed. In such cases, the person whose cash has been forfeited may appeal at any
time before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the date on which the
deproscription order comes into force.

Part IV: Terrorist investigations
Section 32: Terrorist investigation
40. This deﬁnition applies to the power in sections 33–36 to use cordons, to the powers
in Schedule 5 to obtain search warrants, production orders and explanation orders;
and to the power in Schedule 6 to make ﬁnancial information orders. There is also
an oﬀence in section 39 of ‘tipping oﬀ’ in relation to a terrorist investigation.
Sections 33–36: Cordons
41. These sections make similar provision to that inserted into the PTA, at section 16C
and Schedule 6A, by the Prevention of Terrorism (Additional Powers) Act 1996
(c. 7). They give the police the power for a limited period to designate and demarcate
a speciﬁed area as a cordoned area for the purposes of a terrorist investigation—for
instance in the wake of a bomb. They also make it an oﬀence to breach a cordon.
Section 37: Powers
42. See notes on Schedule 5 below.
Section 38: Financial information
43. See notes on Schedule 6 below.
Section 39: Disclosure of information, &c.
44. This section corresponds to section 17(2)–(6) of the PTA and has similar eﬀect. The
oﬀences it sets out, including that at subsection (2)(a) which is sometimes called
‘tipping oﬀ’, are essential to the disclosure regime and have a powerful deterrent
eﬀect. The defence at section 39(5)(a) is listed in section 118(5) and therefore
imposes an evidential burden only on the defendant.
Part V: Counter-terrorist powers
Sections 41–43: Arrest power and related search powers
45. These sections make similar provision to the arrest and detention provisions at
sections 14 and 15 of the PTA. There is a special arrest power for use in terrorist
cases because experience continues to show that it is necessary to make provision
for circumstances where, at the point when the police believe an arrest should take
place, there is not enough to charge an individual with a particular oﬀence even
though there is reasonable suspicion of involvement with terrorism. Sections 42
and 43 give the police powers to search people liable to arrest under section 41.
Subsection (9) of section 41 and subsection (5) of section 43, respectively, give
constables the power to make an arrest under section 41(1) of the Act in any Part
of the United Kingdom, and to search people under section 43 (these subsections
in other words confer ‘cross border’ powers of arrest and search).
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
864
 
www.ebook3000.com

Sections 44–47: General powers to stop and search
46. These sections make similar provision to the following sections of the PTA: section
13A (inserted by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (c. 33)) and
section 13B (inserted by the Prevention of Terrorism (Additional Powers) Act 1996
(c. 7)). They give the police powers to stop and search vehicles and their occupants,
and pedestrians, for the prevention of terrorism. As with the powers under the
PTA, authorisations apply to a speciﬁc area and are for a maximum of 28 days
(though that period may be renewed). The main diﬀerence is that vehicle stop and
search authorisations, as well as pedestrian authorisations, will have to be con-
ﬁrmed or amended by a Secretary of State within 48 hours of their being made, or
they will cease to have eﬀect.
Sections 48–52: Parking
47. These sections make similar provision to that inserted by the Prevention of
Terrorism (Additional Powers) Act 1996 (c. 7) as section 16D of the PTA. This
gives the police the powers to restrict or prohibit parking for a limited period in
a speciﬁed area for the prevention of terrorism and makes it an oﬀence to park
in or refuse to move from such an area.
Section 53: Port and border controls
48. This section brings into eﬀect Schedule 7 on port and border controls, and by
subsection (2) allows for the Secretary of State to repeal by order the provision at
paragraph 16 of the Schedule, which enables him to bring in by order a requirement
for passengers in the Common Travel Area to complete cards.
Part VI: Miscellaneous
49. This Part deals, among other things, with the oﬀences which were discussed in
Chapter 12 of the Government’s consultation paper under the heading ‘Ancillary
oﬀences’.
Sections 54–55: Weapons training
50. These sections correspond to the oﬀence at section 34 of the EPA. Whereas that
oﬀence applied only in Northern Ireland, the new version applies throughout the
UK. It has also been extended to cover chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
and materials as well as conventional ﬁrearms and explosives; and to cover
recruitment for training (subsection (3)) as well as the training itself. Subsection (5)
of section 54 provides a defence for persons who are acting for non-terrorist
purposes, such as the armed forces. This defence is listed in section 118(5) and
therefore imposes an evidential burden only on the defendant.
51. A further modiﬁcation concerns the need for a recipient of the training. Under
subsection (1) of section 54, by contrast with its predecessor in the EPA, no recipi-
ent is needed for the oﬀence to be committed. This means that the oﬀence could
AC T I O N  B Y  T H E  U N I T E D  K I N G D O M
865
 

cover someone who makes weapons instruction for terrorist purposes generally
available, for example via the Internet.
52. The deﬁnitions of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and materials are
based on other statutes.
•
Under section 1 of the Chemical Weapons Act 1996 (c. 6), ‘chemical weapons’
are toxic chemicals and their precursors; munitions and other devices designed
to cause death or harm through the toxic properties of toxic chemicals released
by them; and equipment designed for use in connection with such munitions
and devices.
•
Section 1(1)(b) of the Biological Weapons Act 1974 (c. 6) applies to any
weapon, equipment or means of delivery designed to use biological agents or
toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conﬂict.
•
The meaning of ‘nuclear material’ set out in the Schedule to the Nuclear
Material (Oﬀences) Act 1983 (c. 18), is ‘plutonium except that with iso-
topic concentration exceeding 80% in plutonium-238; uranium-233; uranium
enriched in the isotopes 235 or 233; uranium containing the mixture of iso-
topes as occurring in nature other than in the form of ore or ore-residue; any
material containing one or more of the foregoing’. The Schedule also further
deﬁnes ‘uranium enriched in the isotopes 235 or 233’.

G8 STATEMENT ON
COUNTER-TERRORISM
1. G8 Statement on Counter-Terrorism
1.
We, the leaders of the G8, are united in condemning in the strongest terms the
terrorist attacks in London. We express our deepest condolences to the victims and
their families. We assure the people of the United Kingdom of our solidarity in the
continuing struggles against terrorism. We denounce all terrorist acts as criminal,
and reiterate that there can be no excuse, no justiﬁcation for such slaughter. As
we and our fellow leaders said yesterday, we are striving to combat poverty and to
save and improve lives. The perpetrators of yesterday’s attacks were intent on
destroying lives. We will respond resolutely, together and severally, to this global
challenge and work to bring terrorists to justice wherever they are.
2.
We have carried forward initiatives to prevent the spread of weapons of mass
destruction to terrorists and other criminals, reinforce international political will to
combat terrorism, secure radioactive sources and—as announced at Sea Island—
ensure secure and facilitated travel. Today we commit ourselves to new joint eﬀorts.
We will work to improve the sharing of information on the movement of terrorists
across international borders, to assess and address the threat to the transportation
infrastructure, and to promote best practices for rail and metro security. We leave
Gleneagles with a renewed commitment to work with partners in the UN and in
other key international and regional fora. This tragedy strengthens our resolve to
reach early agreement on a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism
Disrupting terrorists now
3.
The immediate imperative is to reduce the threat from those already intent on
terrorism. We have had considerable success, but must continue to enhance our
eﬀorts. We are working relentlessly to track down known and suspected terrorists
and their collaborators, cut oﬀ their funding, impede their planning, disrupt their
networks, deny them safe haven and bring them to justice. Collectively, we are
developing a common understanding of the threat and assessing links between
crime and terrorism and analysing how terrorists prepare for attacks.
4.
As terrorists operate ﬂexibly and internationally, so must we. Government, police
and intelligence responses must be more eﬀectively co-ordinated—both within
and between States. Co-operation between external and internal intelligence and
security agencies must be further improved. Law enforcers, intelligence collectors
867
 

and analysts, policy makers and practitioners must co-operate and share informa-
tion. Within the G8, we have developed common language on intelligence products,
promoted sharing data on terrorists, especially to prevent terrorists’ travel, and
identiﬁed procedures to extract counter-terrorism intelligence from documents and
other forms of information.
Preventing new generations of terrorists
5.
But if we are to succeed in the long term, we must not only disrupt current terrorist
activity: it is equally important to prevent more people turning to terrorism. Knowl-
edge of the terrorists and their networks helps us to understand how and why
individuals join these networks. Together we are analysing why individuals have
chosen the path of violence and how, for example, terrorists use the internet to
promote radicalisation and pursue recruitment.
6.
Conﬂict, oppression and poverty do not excuse or justify terrorism: the vast
majority of people aﬀected by these scourges do not choose the path of violence.
Terrorism itself exacerbates, often deliberately, the problems it claims to address. It
remains our duty to do all we can to resolve conﬂict, confront oppression, reduce
poverty and promote good governance. We must promote social and political rights
and democratic reform, counter intolerance, encourage public debate and tolerant
education, and foster understanding between cultures. These are important in
themselves, but will also serve to undermine the terrorists’ propaganda. One of our
primary tasks is to work with civil society to foster the total rejection of terrorism
by people at large.
Protecting communities against terrorist attack
7.
As well as reducing the terrorist threat, we must reduce our vulnerability to attack.
We must make ourselves a harder target at home and abroad through better
protective security.
8.
At Sea Island, we announced the Secure and Facilitated International Travel Initia-
tive (SAFTI)—a 28-point action plan, much of which we have already completed.
Over the last twelve months, the G8 has worked on measures to counter attacks on
aviation using surface to air missiles, to restrict the proliferation and smuggling of
these weapons, and to improve ﬂight-deck security. We are improving screening of
individuals and baggage at airports, and States’ enforcement of aviation security
regimes. We have helped spread best practice on the use of sky marshals. We
have established a G8 aviation security contact network, and are enhancing our
co-operation against trans-national document fraud. We have developed a meth-
odology to assess port security. We will continue to strengthen and broaden this
co-operation, encouraging the active engagement of the relevant international
organisations, to raise international standards of transport security.
Minimising the consequences of attacks
9.
We must also be well prepared to minimise the human and economic consequences
of terrorist attacks. Governments and businesses must have continuity plans in
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
868

place, including for eﬀective protection of economic and ﬁnancial systems. The
public should be kept informed and, when necessary, alerted and warned. We have
worked collectively on best practice to respond to terrorist attacks, particularly
chemical, biological and radiological attacks. We have agreed principles for
responding to a crisis, held G8 exercises on critical infrastructure protection and
are sharing best practice on the management of attack sites.
The terrorist threat and the rights of individuals
10. Many terrorists aspire to use violence on a massive scale, and some even to use
weapons of mass destruction. Our response must remain proportionate and respect
our common democratic values. We must protect individuals while upholding
human rights in accordance with international law. We express our deepest sym-
pathy for all those who have been injured or bereaved by terrorist attacks.
Building international capacity
11. We are committed to work together with the UN and other international and
regional organisations to build the political will and capacity of other countries
to counter terrorism. Since its establishment at Evian, the Counter-Terrorism
Action Group (CTAG) has maximised the impact of our resources by co-ordinating
counter-terrorism assistance wherever such assistance is needed. It collaborates
with the Financial Action Task Force and the international ﬁnancial institutions to
help combat terrorist ﬁnancing. So far this year, it has focussed particularly on
enhancing co-ordination in Africa and the Middle East. It will focus on South East
Asia later in the year. The engagement of regional organisations is vital to our
eﬀorts. Regional counter-terrorism mechanisms and centres of excellence must be
adequately resourced.
Enhancing international partnership
12. We welcome the adoption of the International Convention for the Suppression
of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, initiated by the Russian Federation, and look for-
ward to its early entry into force. We call on our partners at the UN Summit
in September to reiterate the international community’s clear condemnation of
terrorist acts. We also urge our partners to capitalise on the new momentum at the
UN and conclude swiftly the draft Comprehensive Convention for the Suppres-
sion of International Terrorism. These instruments will complement the broad
legal framework set out in Security Council resolutions and the 12 UN counter-
terrorism conventions and protocols. We urge universal compliance with all these
international obligations, norms and standards. It is vital that States engage fully
with the Security Council in monitoring their implementation.
Conclusion
13. Today, we commit to new joint eﬀorts to advance our counter-terrorism coop-
eration. These will include work to improve the sharing of information on the
G 8  S TAT E M E N T  O N  C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M
869
 

movement of terrorists across international borders; to assess and address the
threat to the transportation infrastructure; and to promote best practices for rail
and metro security. We will continue to strengthen and broaden this co-operation,
and report our progress in St. Petersburg in 2006.
14. As G8 leaders, we pledge the sustained commitment required to identify and
reduce the terrorist threat, to promote freedom and security, to protect democracy
and to ensure the rule of law. We call upon all States to join us in this crucial
endeavour.
Sharing of ﬁnancial records between jurisdictions in connection with the
ﬁght against terrorist ﬁnancing Summary of a meeting of representatives
of Supervisors and Legal Experts of G10 Central Banks and Supervisory
Authorities on 14 December 2001, Basel, Switzerland
(a) Introduction
1.
On 14 December 2001, bank supervisors and legal experts of G10 central banks
and supervisory authorities met at the BIS to discuss how to prevent the abuse of
the ﬁnancial system when it is used to ﬁnance terrorism, and, speciﬁcally, issues
relating to the sharing of ﬁnancial records between jurisdictions to assist in the
ﬁght against terrorism. The meeting provided an opportunity for participants
to review international developments directed at terrorism, and to consider speciﬁc
assistance that central banks and banking supervisors might provide. The partici-
pants discussed measures that had been taken in their jurisdictions to combat
terrorist ﬁnancing and surveyed mechanisms for the sharing of ﬁnancial records
between national jurisdictions. In many of the countries represented at the meeting,
legislation has been or is in the course of being amended to provide for sanctions to
deter terrorist activities, including measures to deter terrorist ﬁnancing.
2.
All participants fully embraced the goal of combating terrorism and shared the
view of the Chairman of the Basel Committee that measures to impede terrorist
ﬁnancing are critical. The participants agreed with the Chairman that the Basel
Committee should add its voice condemning terrorism to that of the United
Nations Security Council and the Financial Action Task Force of the OECD.
3.
Participants agreed that the size and geographical scope of the international ﬁnan-
cial system make it imperative to signiﬁcantly improve coordination and collabora-
tion between all the parties involved if measures to identify and prevent terrorist
ﬁnancing are to succeed. Central banks and bank supervisors are typically not in
the front line of these eﬀorts. Nevertheless, because terrorism is a threat to ﬁnancial
stability, the participants agreed that central banks and banking supervisors should
lend their expertise and resources to those that are more directly involved, includ-
ing treasuries, judicial authorities and law enforcement authorities such as ﬁnancial
intelligence units. The collaboration needs to operate both at a domestic level
between all parties concerned and also, to the extent possible, at an international
level. This means that gateways need to exist for information to be transmitted
within and across national borders.
4.
Participants reported that even at the domestic level there had been clear evidence
of intelligence failures because diﬀerent strands of information had not been
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
870

centrally collected and analysed. Many countries have created inter-agency task
forces in order to remedy this problem and have become more eﬀective in halting
terrorist ﬁnancing (including improving their responses to the lists of suspected
terrorist names being circulated).
5.
The focus of the 14 December 2001 meeting was on banking activities and on the
possibilities of preventing the global ﬁnancial system from being misused to sup-
port terrorist activities. The participants noted that this cannot be achieved unless
ﬁnancial services providers have eﬀective “know your customer” (KYC) and cus-
tomer due diligence (CDD) procedures and that some of the methods that might be
used by terrorists to move money, such as the postal giro network and private wire
transfer systems, may not be within the jurisdiction of central banks or banking
supervisors. This underscores the need to introduce or improve KYC and CDD
standards for all categories of institutions that provide ﬁnancial services.
6.
Participants emphasized the need to share information about terrorist ﬁnancing—
including the identities of those who might use the global ﬁnancial system to
support terrorism and the patterns of ﬁnancing activities associated with such
support—between diﬀerent national jurisdictions. Discussion focused on two
mechanisms for information ﬂows
(a) from a governmental body in one country to a governmental body in another
country, using an oﬃcial gateway or some less formal channel; and
(b) within a single ﬁnancial group (i.e. between a ﬁnancial entity operating in one
country and its head oﬃce or parent institution in a diﬀerent country).
(b) Oﬃcial gateways for cross-border information sharing
7.
The participants identiﬁed three oﬃcial gateways for sharing information between
national jurisdictions:
(i)
The classical gateway, usually embodied in a treaty for mutual legal assistance
(“MLAT”), provides a legal basis for transmitting evidence that can be used
for prosecution and judicial procedures. This is of course not conﬁned to
ﬁnancial crime. This gateway, which typically involves formalised procedures,
is not customarily used for supervisory or regulatory matters.
(ii)
The second oﬃcial gateway involves a communication between ﬁnancial
intelligence units (FIUs) or other bodies set up to ﬁght ﬁnancial crime. The
FIUs, with the task of receiving and analysing suspicious transaction reports
on an ongoing basis and maintaining close links with police and customs
authorities, are presently mostly engaged in tracking terrorist funds and fol-
lowing up reports of potential terrorist accounts. FIUs share information
between themselves informally in the context of investigations, usually on the
basis of memoranda of understanding (MOU). The Egmont Group of FIUs
has established a model for such MOU. Unlike the MLAT, this gateway is not
ordinarily used for obtaining evidence, but it is used for obtaining intelligence
that might lead to evidence.
(iii)
The third oﬃcial gateway is the supervisory channel. In relation to banking
activities, the information is normally of a general character, designed to
monitor the soundness of the banking group. Increasingly in the recent past,
G 8  S TAT E M E N T  O N  C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M
871
 

however, enquiries have related more to speciﬁc asset or liability accounts
because of concerns about reputation and legal risk. A recent example con-
cerns accounts for politically exposed persons. The ability to share informa-
tion is often deﬁned in the legal framework under which the supervisor
operates, but it may also be supported by a MOU. Unlike the MLAT, the
MOU is not a treaty and usually is not binding on the governments. Instead,
it reﬂects the mutual understanding of the signing supervisory authorities’
policies. The MOU may be especially valuable where other types of entities,
such as securities or trading ﬁrms, are within the jurisdiction of a speciﬁc
authority, because that authority could share information on customer
transactions throughout a larger segment of the ﬁnancial market. Informa-
tion communicated through the supervisory gateway usually is communi-
cated for supervisory purposes only, and may therefore not ordinarily be used
as evidence, nor be shared widely among governmental entities.
8.
While each of these gateways is used to communicate ﬁnancial information across a
national border, the information received through each respective gateway serves a
diﬀerent purpose. Of course, these purposes may also complement one another
with respect to an overall objective like ﬁghting terrorism. If a prosecutor needs
information to prosecute a criminal case of terrorism, the prosecutor will ordinar-
ily use a MLAT. If a FIU in a host country learns information suggesting that a
branch or subsidiary of a banking group has an account for a known terrorist
organisation, the FIU may pass that intelligence information to the FIU in the
home country for the group. If a bank supervisor in the jurisdiction where such a
branch or subsidiary has the account learns about it, then that host supervisor may
well pass the information along to the home supervisor for the Group. The overall
ﬁght against terrorism needs coordination among prosecutors, ﬁnancial intelli-
gence units, and banking supervisors in the aﬀected jurisdictions. While the spirit
and level of cooperation demonstrated in the aftermath of September 11th far
exceeded past experience, many of the participants in the meeting felt that further
work needed to be done to coordinate between interested governmental bodies,
within a jurisdiction and, particularly, across national boundaries.
9.
The participants felt that this need was demonstrated recently in the case of the
circulation of “control lists” of individuals suspected to be involved in terrorism. In
particular, both the circulation of the lists within ﬁnancial groups and the reporting
mechanisms for feedback did not operate uniformly. Participants were of the view
that the FIU channel is in most cases the most eﬀective gateway in such circum-
stances. The eﬃciency of this gateway would, however, be impaired if the involved
authorities did not collaborate closely. A breakdown in communication could
occur between FIUs, or between an FIU and a banking supervisor within the same
country. The participants believed that further work delineating sharing arrange-
ments is desirable, particularly with respect to the ﬁght against terrorism.
(c) Information ﬂow from a ﬁnancial entity to its head oﬃce/parent
10. The ﬁrst line of defence against terrorist ﬁnancing is for those involved in terrorism
to be denied all support, which includes a denial of access to the ﬁnancial system.

Strenuous eﬀorts have been made over recent years to prohibit the use of the
ﬁnancial system by criminal elements and these eﬀorts are now being reviewed to
ensure they reﬂect the terrorist threat. The identiﬁcation of the customer is key and
this is the object of the Customer Due Diligence paper issued in October 2001 by
the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision.
That paper emphasises the signiﬁcant risks, notably reputational risk, for banks
that do not have suﬃcient KYC procedures. The procedures should apply both to
the initial identiﬁcation process and the ongoing monitoring of higher risk
accounts. Responsibility for this task lies with the banks’ compliance oﬃcers under
the overall direction of top management and subject to review in the supervisory
process.
11. The monitoring of reputational risk needs to be conducted for an institution on a
worldwide basis. For that reason, the CDD paper stresses that the risk management
process must embrace all foreign branches and subsidiaries, even if they are subject
to lower KYC standards in some jurisdictions. Banks require a centralised risk
management system that is overseen by the group’s chief compliance oﬃcer. The
centralised risk management system can utilise one of two approaches in obtaining
its information:
(i) The ﬁrst is the creation of a centralised database or register at the parent bank.
However, many foreign branches and subsidiaries are not permitted to transmit
the customer ﬁles outside of their jurisdiction. In some cases, this may be
forbidden by the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch or subsidiary is
located. In other cases, particularly where oﬀshore centres oﬀering private
banking services are concerned, the local branch or subsidiary may maintain
that its business with nationals of its home country will be handicapped if
ﬁnancial records containing customer names ﬁnd their way back to the author-
ities at the headquarters of the parent bank. The reason for this is usually
tax-related, but there are other reasons why customers may wish to keep their
ﬁnancial records conﬁdential.
(ii) In the second approach, a centralised database would not be maintained at the
parent bank, but information would be kept at branches and subsidiaries and
made available to the parent bank on request, or at the initiative of the
branches and subsidiaries when the reputation or liability of the group could be
threatened by the relationship. This approach would allow ﬁnancial groups to
determine their own organisational structure, yet branches and subsidiaries
would be expected to maintain rigorous risk management systems for due
diligence purposes, and the adequacy of these systems would be reviewed by
home supervisory authorities. In the case of a relationship with a person
believed to be involved in terrorism, the participants felt the relationship
should be disclosed to the centralised risk manager. The participants felt that a
banking group should require such disclosure as a matter of policy.
12. Participants recognise that the Basel Committee already has taken a number
of steps to persuade banks to adopt centralised risk management systems. How-
ever, they felt that further attention should be paid to this practice in the light of
recent developments, with speciﬁc reference to the ability of the group compliance
oﬃcer to access names of all the bank’s customers in its overseas branches and
G 8  S TAT E M E N T  O N  C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M
873
 

subsidiaries, especially if any of those names were suspected to be associated with
terrorism.
(d) Conclusions
13. Participants suggested that the Basel Committee add its voice condemning terror-
ism to that of the United Nations Security Council and the FATF. The Basel
Committee should also acknowledge that terrorism threatens ﬁnancial stability,
and the threat needs to be met with collective actions to identify and halt terrorist
ﬁnancing.
14. The participants believed that adequate means for group wide centralised risk
assessment is essential, as the provision of ﬁnancial services to terrorists would
expose the group to material reputational and legal risk. Furthermore, best prac-
tices of consolidated home country supervision require that a home country super-
visor must know if any foreign branch or subsidiary of a group for which it acted as
consolidated supervisor were providing ﬁnancial services to terrorists. This kind of
signiﬁcant supervisory information needs to reach the consolidated supervisor, in
the view of the participants, and must ﬂow across the national border.
15. Participants suggested the Basel Committee consider further work to be done on
best practices for controlling reputational and legal risk arising from a relationship
with a terrorist organisation by any part of a banking group, such as by remitting
the matter to the Cross-border Banking Working Group 1 to provide additional
guidance regarding, for example, in October 2001, the Basel Committee released
the Customer Due Diligence for Banks paper that was drafted by the Working
Group on Cross-border Banking. This paper explored the risks associated with
customer account relationships and established essential elements of know your
customer standards, which highlighted the appropriate roles and responsibilities of
individual oﬃces and subsidiaries of a banking organisation and those of its cen-
tralised risk management function in detecting and communicating any relation-
ship with a possible terrorist organisation, and to consider the responsibilities and
practices to be followed by supervisory authorities to ensure that bank processes in
this regard work eﬀectively.
16. Participants suggested further that the Basel Committee consider asking the legal
experts of the G10 central banks and supervisory authorities and/or other legal
experts (including, if appropriate, FIU experts) to explore current impediments to
(i) sharing information on terrorist ﬁnancing and develop guidelines for passing
information across borders to other interested parties, particularly in the case of
sharing information between host and home supervisors, and (ii) treating ﬁnancial
groups as single entities for the purpose of sharing information within the group.
Other areas for additional work could include developing best practices for the
sharing of information by an FIU with a banking supervisor within the same
country where the banking supervisor acts as the consolidated supervisor for a
banking group where a component of that group has a ﬁnancial relationship with
an identiﬁed terrorist, as well as best practices for collecting and sharing informa-
tion where no FIU exists within a particular country.

2. Excerpts from the Report on 2005 World Summit Outcome
Terrorism
81. We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by
whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes, as it constitutes one of the most
serious threats to international peace and security.
82. We welcome the Secretary-General’s identiﬁcation of elements of a counter-
terrorism strategy. These elements should be developed by the General Assembly
without delay with a view to adopting and implementing a strategy to promote
comprehensive, coordinated and consistent responses, at the national, regional
and international levels, to counter terrorism, which also takes into account the
conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. In this context, we commend the
various initiatives to promote dialogue, tolerance and understanding among
civilizations.
83. We stress the need to make every eﬀort to reach an agreement on and conclude a
comprehensive convention on international terrorism during the sixtieth session of
the General Assembly.
84. We acknowledge that the question of convening a high-level conference under the
auspices of the United Nations to formulate an international response to terrorism
in all its forms and manifestations could be considered.
85. We recognize that international cooperation to ﬁght terrorism must be conducted
in conformity with international law, including the Charter and relevant inter-
national conventions and protocols. States must ensure that any measures taken
to combat terrorism comply with their obligations under international law, in par-
ticular human rights law, refugee law and international humanitarian law.
86. We reiterate our call upon States to refrain from organizing, ﬁnancing, encour-
aging, providing training for or otherwise supporting terrorist activities and to
take appropriate measures to ensure that their territories are not used for such
activities.
87. We acknowledge the important role played by the United Nations in combating
terrorism and also stress the vital contribution of regional and bilateral coopera-
tion, particularly at the practical level of law enforcement cooperation and technical
exchange.
88. We urge the international community, including the United Nations, to assist
States in building national and regional capacity to combat terrorism. We invite
the Secretary-General to submit proposals to the General Assembly and the
Security Council, within their respective mandates, to strengthen the capacity of
the United Nations’ system to assist States in combating terrorism and to enhance
the coordination of United Nations activities in this regard.
89. We stress the importance of assisting victims of terrorism and of providing them
and their families with support to cope with their loss and their grief.
90. We encourage the Security Council to consider ways to strengthen its monitoring
and enforcement role in counter-terrorism, including by consolidating State report-
ing requirements, taking into account and respecting the diﬀerent mandates of its
counter-terrorism subsidiary bodies. We are committed to cooperating fully with
the three competent subsidiary bodies in the fulﬁlment of their tasks, recognizing
G 8  S TAT E M E N T  O N  C O U N T E R - T E R RO R I S M
875
 

that many States continue to require assistance in implementing relevant Security
Council resolutions.
91. We support eﬀorts for the early entry into force of the International Convention
for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and strongly encourage States
to consider becoming parties to it expeditiously and acceding without delay to
the twelve other international conventions and protocols against terrorism and
implementing them.

MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE
FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE
1. Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Trends and
Indicators: Initial Perspectives
Attempting to describe current and emerging money laundering trends has been one
of the principal goals of the FATF typologies eﬀort since the beginnings of the Task
Force in the ﬁrst years of the 1990s. The early emphasis on case studies and more
recent focus on a thematic approach in examining typologies helped the FATF to build
up a signiﬁcant expertise in the methods used for money laundering. This emphasis on
the methods—the ‘how-to’—of money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing has however
meant less emphasis on identifying new or potential ML/TF trends in an accurate and
consistent manner. While the importance of studying ML/TF methods and techniques
cannot be overstated—such studies provide decision makers and operational experts
with the material toward which to target policies and strategies for combating ﬁnancial
crime—the ‘how-to’ of ML/TF is only part of the picture.
Understanding the evolution and prevalence over time of particular ML/TF
methods—the current and emerging trends—provides the rest of the picture. The study
of known or perceived trends enables the development and reﬁnement of indicators
that law enforcement and supervisory authorities and especially the private sector can
use to help detect speciﬁc ML/TF activity. Identifying trends ensures that, in the longer
term, the relevant ML/TF methods are themselves examined in a systematic manner
and understood and acted on with reference to their context. It is this extra context
that also allows the identiﬁcation of further links between apparently diﬀerent ML/TF
methods. The experience gained through past FATF typologies work has shown that
individual topics (or now projects) often identify similar or overlapping ML/TF
methods. In this year’s exercise, we can cite as an example alternative remittance sys-
tems that, besides being the subject of a speciﬁc project also appeared as a factor in
some human being traﬃcking operations, another of this year’s topics. The typologies
process should ensure that value is added by linking together these common methods
or techniques and make sure our understanding is complete. It is through looking
at such activity over time that emerging methods or trends may be identiﬁed and
potential new areas of vulnerability can be addressed.
The FATF decided to place additional emphasis within its overall typologies eﬀort
to identify and describe ML/TF trends at the international level and on a systematic
basis. A dedicated project team would carry out this work, which would be based
on ML/TF activity detected by national AML/CFT authorities and international
877
 

organisations. Initially, the project would have as one of its objectives to develop basic
indicators related to identiﬁed trends. As the initiative matures, the project will be
able to start judging the extent to which ML/TF methods and techniques occur and
ultimately the importance of particular trends over time. The results of this work could
then possibly provide policy makers at national and international levels with additional
useful information for prioritising the development of relevant AML/CFT measures.
The Methods and Trends Project Team began its work in 2004 by attempting to
develop an inventory of known ML/TF methods and techniques. The basic sources
creating this inventory were to include already existing FATF typologies material
(including annual typologies reports and written submissions provided by countries
during the yearly typologies exercises), ﬁnished typologies reports prepared by national
and international authorities, national indicator lists developed to aid ﬁnancial institu-
tions in detecting and reporting ML/TF activities, etc. The use of a broad range
of sources was intended to ensure that the methods inventoried would not only include
ML/TF activity detected through AML/CFT reporting systems. Upon completion
of the inventory, the Methods and Trends Project Team would turn to develop-
ment of a ‘methodology’ that could provide a system for further analysing these
techniques.
Very quickly it became clear that the Project Team needed ﬁrst to build a common
analytical framework in order to create an inventory of ML/TF methods. Such a
framework was necessary given the diversity of potential sources of information and
diﬀering national approaches to analysis of ML/TF phenomena. The Team thus used
the workshop held during joint meeting of ML/TF experts in Moscow on 6–8 December
2005 to focus its eﬀorts on agreeing basic concepts and initial common approaches to
the analysis of ML/TF activities.
Deﬁning basic concepts
The Moscow workshop provided the opportunity to deﬁne key terms and concepts
relating to analysis of ML/TF activities. Participants in the workshop provided most
of the input on these deﬁnitions; however, it was also clear that participants were
agreeing to ‘working deﬁnitions’ that would likely be modiﬁed and further reﬁned as
the work of the Project Team progresses. From these working deﬁnitions, a ﬁrst and
very preliminary analytical approach for ML/TF methods and trends would develop,
which in turn would be subject to further modiﬁcation.
In the ﬁrst group of terms, the workshop/project team concentrated on concepts
relating to methods and trends.
•
Method: In the ML/TF context, a method is a particular procedure for carrying out
ML or TF activity. It was felt useful to consider further distinctions in the concept
of ML/TF method:
•
Technique: A ML or TF technique is a particular action or way that the ML or TF
activity is carried out. Techniques in the ML/TF context could include, for example,
depositing funds into a bank account, transmission of funds by international wire
transfer, exchanging funds in one currency for another, purchasing a cashier’s
cheque, over- and under-invoicing as part of an import/export transaction.
•
Mechanism: A ML or TF mechanism is a system or thing that carries out part of the
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
878
 
www.ebook3000.com

ML or TF process. Examples of ML or TF mechanisms might include a ﬁnancial
institution, a money remitter, an Internet casino, a legal entity or arrangement (used
as a cover for illegal activity or established for the purpose of hiding ownership or
control), etc.
•
Instrument: A ML or TF instrument is an object of value (or representing value)
that is somehow used in the ML or TF process. Examples of ML/TF instruments
include cash funds, cheques, travellers’ cheques, letters of credit, precious stones,
real estate, securities, etc.
There is a certain amount of overlap between these last three concepts. For example,
the action of depositing funds into a bank account relates to all three concepts:
(1) depositing funds is a technique, (2) the ﬁnancial institution managing the account
is a mechanism and (3) the funds deposited are an instrument. It should be noted as
well that, for the most part, the examples provided for each of these concepts may
not in and of themselves be illegal activities. Indeed, it is only when these techniques,
mechanisms and instruments are put together to form a ML or TF operation that they
may become illegal.
•
Scheme: A ML or TF scheme is the particular ML/TF process that combines
various methods (techniques, mechanisms and instruments) into a unique operation.
In some instances, such schemes are described as cases, since an individual investi-
gation or case may uncover a unique scheme. However, using the latter term tends
to confuse the concept with investigative case;
•
Some examples of techniques, mechanisms and instruments that could be con-
sidered inherently illegal include structuring or smurﬁng to avoid reporting require-
ments or bribing a bank employee not to undertake usual AML obligations
(techniques), use of an unlicensed money remitter where such use is illegal (mechan-
ism) and third party (endorsed) cheques used as means of payment when such use
is illegal (instrument).
Often schemes are not detected through investigations alone, and investigations can
uncover more than one ML/TF scheme.
•
Typology: When a series of ML or TF schemes appear to be constructed in a
similar fashion or using the same or similar methods, then the similar scheme can
be classiﬁed as a typology. It is from the study of ML/TF typologies then that
experts can detect the weaknesses that will allow appropriate counter-measures to
be developed. Furthermore, a typology, when well-understood, will provide some
indication of particular weak points in already existing AML/CFT measures.
Deﬁning a trend
It is also important to diﬀerentiate clearly between ML/TF trends and from ML/TF
methods and typologies. While a method or typology still refers to unique processes at a
particular point or period in time, a trend could be considered the evolution of a method
or typology over time. For this reason, in trying to identify and describe ML/TF trends,
experts must take into account the temporal aspect (frequency and repetition) and
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
879
 

geographic aspect (pervasiveness), as well as the transformation over time of individual
methods and typologies.
In practically all areas, deﬁning and then describing a trend is often diﬃcult. In the
ML/TF area, there are particular diﬃculties in trying to identify trends because of
the illegal or clandestine nature of such activity. ML/TF activity cannot be observed
through easily available information or statistics. To determine a trend, the analyst
must rely on what are often indirect indicators. Some examples of information that can
be used includes:
•
‘Intelligence’ provided by law enforcement agencies, FIUs and other competent
authorities
•
Law enforcement investigations
•
Criminal prosecutions/convictions/attachments and conﬁscation orders
The diﬃculties in using these sources of information to identify or conﬁrm a ML/TF
trend is that it does not provide a complete picture of the situation. For example, the
number of prosecutions or convictions in a particular location may indicate a high
(or low) concentration of ML activity.
However, high numbers of prosecutions—taken out of context—could represent a
single large-scale case with a number of persons involved in the same operation
rather than a high concentration of activity overall. A small number of convictions—
again, taken out of context—could mean not that there is a low concentration of ML
activity but that there are perhaps other factors that limit the numbers of prosecutions
under the ML oﬀence (for example, the predicate or ancillary ML oﬀence is easier
to prove).
First step on developing an analytical approach: Determining
categories/classiﬁcations
After creating a series of working deﬁnitions for relevant basic concepts, the Moscow
workshop turned to laying the groundwork for a common approach to typologies
analysis generally and to the identiﬁcation of ML/TF trends in particular. One of the
basic elements of any analysis is the process of classiﬁcation. In the case of ML/TF,
some of the concepts deﬁned above—technique, mechanism, instrument and typology—
can already be used for classifying the various activities described in ML/TF case
examples. Besides these categories, however, there are a number of others ways in
which ML/TF activity can be classiﬁed. For example:
•
By ML/TF stage: For money laundering, these stages include placement, layering
and integration. For terrorist ﬁnancing, the stages include collection, transmission/
dissimulation and use. Examples of techniques at the placement stage might include
conversion of one currency for another or structuring of cash deposits. An example
of methods relevant to the layering and/or transmission stages might include the
use of wire transfers or money remittance systems.
•
By predicate or other related oﬀence: Certain ML activity may be more closely
related to speciﬁc predicate oﬀences. For example, in some jurisdictions, structur-
ing or smurﬁng was traditionally associated with narcotics traﬃcking. The ML
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
880
 
www.ebook3000.com

activity associated with certain types of large-scale frauds may be particularly
associated with the use of shell companies or banks.
•
By country or region: Some types of ML/TF activity may be associated with speciﬁc
countries or regions. For example, the nature and degree of misuse of alternative
remittance systems is linked to some countries or regions more than others.
•
By ﬁnancial or other sector involved: Speciﬁc ML/TF methods are associated with
certain sectors of the economy. Structuring or smurﬁng is generally associated with
the banking sector, for example.
•
By development stage of the ﬁnancial market: The ML/TF methods that might
be used in a highly developed ﬁnancial sector will diﬀer from those used in a
cash-based economy, for example.
•
By weak point or vulnerability in the AML/CFT system: Bureaux de change might
be exploited for ML/TF purposes in a particular jurisdiction because they fall
outside of that jurisdiction’s regulatory regime. Trusts or other legal arrangements
are often used in schemes that attempt to take advantage of diﬀerences between
jurisdictions that have or do not have them.
None of these ways of classifying ML/TF methods could be considered individually as
an analytical method; rather, categorising such activity in these ways can serve as the
ﬁrst step in identifying common elements that could in turn help in the detection of
patterns or eventually in the development of relevant indicators. As an initial step in
building on these basic analytical processes, the Moscow workshop proposed that a
few potential methods/trends would be looked at informally using the simple methods
of categorisation indicated above. This would serve to test the utility of classifying and,
it is hoped, help provide additional analytical procedures that could also be useful in
examining ML/TF subjects.
ML/TF indicators
Looking forward to ways that the project team on methods and trends could eventually
develop ML/TF indicators, the Moscow workshop focussed again on deﬁning basic
concepts. The term indicator itself initially posed some problem, as there is sometimes
confusion between a ML/TF indicator and a ML/TF method. While it is sometimes
true that the methods deﬁned earlier in this chapter could indicate ML or TF activity,
they are not synonymous. For example, exchanging one currency for another is not
by itself and indicator of ML. By the same token, indicators are not all necessarily
ML/TF methods. The concept of indicator also presents a few other problems. For
example, speciﬁc indicators might point the way toward a particular ML/TF methods
or typologies; however, it is from the study of these methods and typologies that
indicators are ultimately derived. Indicators can thus have diﬀerent roles depending on
who is working with them.
When developed from concrete examples, indicators help in detecting ML/TF
activity. As such they are a necessary tool for ﬁnancial institutions, other ﬁnancial
intermediaries and gatekeepers who are on the front line in confronting activities that
may or may not be suspicious (and thus may or may not be related in some way to
money laundering, terrorist ﬁnancing or some other ﬁnancial crime). For the private
sector, valid ML/TF indicators are therefore essential in establishing and ‘calibrating’
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
881
 

mechanisms that help to identify suspicious or unusual transactions which must then
be reported to a ﬁnancial intelligence unit.
For law enforcement and other investigative authorities, ML/TF indicators can also
play a role. Indicators viewed along with other information may help such authorities
to detect speciﬁc types of criminal oﬀences or may otherwise help in orienting a par-
ticular ML/TF investigation. If we take into account that indicators can be derived
from analysis of concrete cases, it becomes apparent that indicators are part of a
continuous process that can start and ﬁnish with indicators. The Moscow workshop
discussed this process—usually described in more general terms as the ‘intelligence
cycle’—and noted that it is particularly useful for explaining how ML/TF indicators
can start the process and at the same time be one of the ultimate products.
Conclusion and next steps
The study of ML/TF trends in an accurate and systematic manner is becoming ever
more essential in order to acquire a fuller understanding of the vulnerabilities of the
ﬁnancial system to exploitation by criminals and terrorists. To acquire this ‘whole
picture’ of ML/TF, it is necessary to go beyond the ‘how-to’ of this activity and
attempt to determine the larger context in which such activity occurs—the current and
emerging ML/TF trends. The FATF has with the establishment of its project on ML/
TF methods and trends taken the ﬁrst steps in developing analytical processes that will
lead to the identiﬁcation of credible and relevant ML/TF trends. The resulting pro-
cesses, which will take time to develop fully, should also be useful for the analytical
component of research undertaken as part of other typologies projects. This work
should also result in the development of both generic and speciﬁc ML/TF indicators
that could be used by the private sector (ﬁnancial institutions and other intermediaries),
law enforcement and other investigative authorities.
From the start, this work is viewed as a long-term initiative. The project is intended
to develop processes that will necessarily be tested and then improve as experience
increases and as the FATF acquires more information on ML/TF methods from a
broader range of sources. Working more closely, for example, with the various FATF-
style regional bodies, the Egmont Group and other international partners is likely to
prove a valuable source of information as well as providing a key forum for dialogue
on emerging trends. The methods and trends project could also play a role in initial
development of certain typologies topics before they are assigned to individual project
groups.
2. FATF on Money Laundering: The Forty Recommendations
Introduction
Money laundering methods and techniques change in response to developing counter-
measures. In recent years, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has noted increas-
ingly sophisticated combinations of techniques, such as the increased use of legal persons
to disguise the true ownership and control of illegal proceeds, and an increased use
of professionals to provide advice and assistance in laundering criminal funds. These
factors, combined with the experience gained through the FATF’s Non-Cooperative
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

Countries and Territories process, and a number of national and international initiatives,
led the FATF to review and revise the Forty Recommendations into a new comprehen-
sive framework for combating money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing. The FATF
now calls upon all countries to take the necessary steps to bring their national systems
for combating money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing into compliance with the new
FATF Recommendations, and to eﬀectively implement these measures.
The review process for revising the Forty Recommendations was an extensive one,
open to FATF members, non-members, observers, ﬁnancial and other aﬀected sectors
and interested parties. This consultation process provided a wide range of input, all of
which was considered in the review process.
The revised Forty Recommendations now apply not only to money laundering but
also to terrorist ﬁnancing, and when combined with the Eight Special Recommendations
on Terrorist Financing provide an enhanced, comprehensive and consistent framework
of measures for combating money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing. The FATF rec-
ognises that countries have diverse legal and ﬁnancial systems and so all cannot take
identical measures to achieve the common objective, especially over matters of detail.
The Recommendations therefore set minimum standards for action for countries to
implement the detail according to their particular circumstances and constitutional
frameworks. The Recommendations cover all the measures that national systems
should have in place within their criminal justice and regulatory systems; the preven-
tive measures to be taken by ﬁnancial institutions and certain other businesses and
professions; and international co-operation.
The original FATF Forty Recommendations were drawn up in 1990 as an initiative
to combat the misuse of ﬁnancial systems by persons laundering drug money. In 1996
the Recommendations were revised for the ﬁrst time to reﬂect evolving money launder-
ing typologies. The 1996 Forty Recommendations have been endorsed by more than
130 countries and are the international anti-money laundering standard.
In October 2001 the FATF expanded its mandate to deal with the issue of the
ﬁnancing of terrorism, and took the important step of creating the Eight Special
Recommendations on Terrorist Financing.
These Recommendations contain a set of measures aimed at combating the funding
of terrorist acts and terrorist organisations, and are complementary to the Forty
Recommendations.
A key element in the ﬁght against money laundering and the ﬁnancing of terrorism
is the need for countries’ systems to be monitored and evaluated, with respect to these
international standards. The mutual evaluations conducted by the FATF and FATF-
style regional bodies, as well as the assessments conducted by the IMF and World Bank,
are a vital mechanism for ensuring that the FATF Recommendations are eﬀectively
implemented by all countries.
1.
The FATF is an inter-governmental body which sets standards, and develops
and promotes policies to combat money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing. It
currently has 33 members: 31 countries and governments and two international
organisations; and more than 20 observers: ﬁve FATF-style regional bodies and
more than 15 other international organisations or bodies. A list of all members
and observers can be found on the FATF website at http://www.fatf-gaﬁ.org/

2.
The FATF Forty and Eight Special Recommendations have been recognised by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as the international standards
for combating money laundering and the ﬁnancing of terrorism.
The Forty Recommendations
A. Legal systems
Scope of the criminal oﬀence of money laundering
1.
Countries should criminalise money laundering on the basis of the United
Nations Convention against Illicit Traﬃc in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances, 1988 (the Vienna Convention) and the United Nations Convention
against Transnational Organized Crime, 2000 (the Palermo Convention).
Countries should apply the crime of money laundering to all serious oﬀences, with
a view to including the widest range of predicate oﬀences. Predicate oﬀences may
be described by reference to all oﬀences, or to a threshold linked either to a category
of serious oﬀences or to the penalty of imprisonment applicable to the predicate
oﬀence (threshold approach), or to a list of predicate oﬀences, or a combination of
these approaches.
Where countries apply a threshold approach, predicate oﬀences should at a min-
imum comprise all oﬀences that fall within the category of serious oﬀences under
their national law or should include oﬀences which are punishable by a maximum
penalty of more than one year’s imprisonment or for those countries that have a
minimum threshold for oﬀences in their legal system, predicate oﬀences should
comprise all oﬀences, which are punished by a minimum penalty of more than
six months’ imprisonment.
Whichever approach is adopted, each country should at a minimum include a
range of oﬀences within each of the designated categories of oﬀences.
Predicate oﬀences for money laundering should extend to conduct that occurred in
another country, which constitutes an oﬀence in that country, and which would
have constituted a predicate oﬀence had it occurred domestically. Countries may
provide that the only prerequisite is that the conduct would have constituted a
predicate oﬀence had it occurred domestically.
Countries may provide that the oﬀence of money laundering does not apply to
persons who committed the predicate oﬀence, where this is required by fundamental
principles of their domestic law.
2.
Countries should ensure that:
(a) The intent and knowledge required to prove the oﬀence of money launder-
ing is consistent with the standards set forth in the Vienna and Palermo
Conventions, including the concept that such mental state may be inferred
from objective factual circumstances.
(b) Criminal liability, and, where that is not possible, civil or administrative liabil-
ity, should apply to legal persons. This should not preclude parallel criminal,
civil or administrative proceedings with respect to legal persons in countries in
which such forms of liability.

Provisonal measures and conﬁscation
3.
Countries should adopt measures similar to those set forth in the Vienna and
Palermo Conventions, including legislative measures, to enable their competent
authorities to conﬁscate property laundered, proceeds from money laundering or
predicate oﬀences, instrumentalities used in or intended for use in the commission
of these oﬀences, or property of corresponding value, without prejudicing the
rights of bona ﬁde third parties. Such measures should include the authority to:
(a) identify, trace and evaluate property which is subject to conﬁscation; (b) carry
out provisional measures, such as freezing and seizing, to prevent any dealing,
transfer or disposal of such property; (c) take steps that will prevent or void actions
that prejudice the State’s ability to recover property that is subject to conﬁscation;
and (d) take any appropriate investigative measures.
Countries may consider adopting measures that allow such proceeds or instrumen-
talities to be conﬁscated without requiring a criminal conviction, or which require
an oﬀender to demonstrate the lawful origin of the property alleged to be liable to
conﬁscation, to the extent that such a requirement is consistent with the principles
of their domestic law.
B. Measures to be taken by ﬁnancial institutions and non-ﬁnancial
businesses and professions to prevent money laundering and
terrorist ﬁnancing
4.
Countries should ensure that ﬁnancial institution secrecy laws do not inhibit
implementation of the FATF Recommendations.
Customer due diligence and record-keeping
5.
Financial institutions should not keep anonymous accounts or accounts in
obviously ﬁctitious names.
Financial institutions should undertake customer due diligence measures, including
identifying and verifying the identity of their customers, when:
— establishing business relations;
— carrying out occasional transactions: (i) above the applicable designated
threshold; or (ii) that are wire transfers in the circumstances covered by the
Interpretative Note to Special Recommendation VII;
— there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing; or
—
the ﬁnancial institution has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously
obtained customer identiﬁcation data.
The customer due diligence (CDD) measures to be taken are as follows:
(a) Identifying the customer and verifying that customer’s identity using reliable,
independent source documents, data or information.
(b) Identifying the beneﬁcial owner, and taking reasonable measures to verify the
identity of the beneﬁcial owner such that the ﬁnancial institution is satisﬁed that
it knows who the beneﬁcial owner is. For legal persons and arrangements this
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
885
 

should include ﬁnancial institutions taking reasonable measures to understand
the ownership and control structure of the customer.
(c) Obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business
relationship.
(d) Conducting ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and scrutiny of
transactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure
that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution’s
knowledge of the customer, their business and risk proﬁle, including, where
necessary, the source of funds.
Financial institutions should apply each of the CDD measures under (a) to (d)
above, but may determine the extent of such measures on a risk sensitive basis
depending on the type of customer, business relationship or transaction. The
measures that are taken should be consistent with any guidelines issued by com-
petent authorities. For higher risk categories, ﬁnancial institutions should perform
enhanced due diligence. In certain circumstances, where there are low risks,
countries may decide that ﬁnancial institutions can apply reduced or simpliﬁed
measures.
Financial institutions should verify the identity of the customer and beneﬁcial
owner before or during the course of establishing a business relationship or con-
ducting transactions for occasional customers. Countries may permit ﬁnancial
institutions to complete the veriﬁcation as soon as reasonably practicable following
the establishment of the relationship, where the money laundering risks are eﬀect-
ively managed and where this is essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of
business.
Where the ﬁnancial institution is unable to comply with paragraphs (a) to (c) above,
it should not open the account, commence business relations or perform the trans-
action; or should terminate the business relationship; and should consider making
a suspicious transactions report in relation to the customer.
These requirements should apply to all new customers, though ﬁnancial institu-
tions should also apply this Recommendation to existing customers on the basis of
materiality and risk, and should conduct due diligence on such existing relationships
at appropriate times.
6.
Financial institutions should, in relation to politically exposed persons, in addition
to performing normal due diligence measures:
(a) Have appropriate risk management systems to determine whether the customer
is a politically exposed person.
(b) Obtain senior management approval for establishing business relationships
with such customers.
(c) Take reasonable measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds.
(d) Conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.
7.
Financial institutions should, in relation to cross-border correspondent banking
and other similar relationships, in addition to performing normal due diligence
measures:
(a) Gather suﬃcient information about a respondent institution to understand
fully the nature of the respondent’s business and to determine from publicly
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
886
 
www.ebook3000.com

available information the reputation of the institution and the quality of
supervision, including whether it has been subject to a money laundering or
terrorist ﬁnancing investigation or regulatory action.
(b) Assess the respondent institution’s anti-money laundering and terrorist
ﬁnancing controls.
(c) Obtain approval from senior management before establishing new correspond-
ent relationships.
(d) Document the respective responsibilities of each institution.
(e) With respect to ‘payable-through accounts’, be satisﬁed that the respondent
bank has veriﬁed the identity of and performed on-going due diligence on the
customers having direct access to accounts of the correspondent and that it
is able to provide relevant customer identiﬁcation data upon request to the
correspondent bank.
8.
Financial institutions should pay special attention to any money laundering threats
that may arise from new or developing technologies that might favour anonymity,
and take measures, if needed, to prevent their use in money laundering schemes. In
particular, ﬁnancial institutions should have policies and procedures in place to
address any speciﬁc risks associated with non-face to face business relationships or
transactions.
9.
Countries may permit ﬁnancial institutions to rely on intermediaries or other third
parties to perform elements (a)–(c) of the CDD process or to introduce business,
provided that the criteria set out below are met. Where such reliance is permitted,
the ultimate responsibility for customer identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation remains with
the ﬁnancial institution relying on the third party. The criteria that should be met
are as follows:
(a) A ﬁnancial institution relying upon a third party should immediately obtain
the necessary information concerning elements (a)–(c) of the CDD process.
Financial institutions should take adequate steps to satisfy themselves that
copies of identiﬁcation data and other relevant documentation relating to the
CDD requirements will be made available from the third party upon request
without delay.
(b) The ﬁnancial institution should satisfy itself that the third party is regulated and
supervised for, and has measures in place to comply with CDD requirements in
line with Recommendations 5 and 10.
It is left to each country to determine in which countries the third party that meets
the conditions can be based, having regard to information available on countries
that do not or do not adequately apply the FATF Recommendations.
10. Financial institutions should maintain, for at least ﬁve years, all necessary records
on transactions, both domestic or international, to enable them to comply swiftly
with information requests from the competent authorities. Such records must
be suﬃcient to permit reconstruction of individual transactions (including the
amounts and types of currency involved if any) so as to provide, if necessary,
evidence for prosecution of criminal activity. Financial institutions should keep
records on the identiﬁcation data obtained through the customer due diligence
process (e.g. copies or records of oﬃcial identiﬁcation documents like passports,
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
887
 

identity cards, driving licenses or similar documents), account ﬁles and business
correspondence for at least ﬁve years after the business relationship is ended.
The identiﬁcation data and transaction records should be available to domestic
competent authorities upon appropriate authority.
11. Financial institutions should pay special attention to all complex, unusual large
transactions, and all unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent
economic or visible lawful purpose. The background and purpose of such transac-
tions should, as far as possible, be examined, the ﬁndings established in writing,
and be available to help competent authorities and auditors.
12. The customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements set out in Recom-
mendations 5, 6, and 8 to 11 apply to designated non-ﬁnancial businesses and
professions in the following situations:
(a) Casinos—when customers engage in ﬁnancial transactions equal to or above
the applicable designated threshold.
(b) Real estate agents—when they are involved in transactions for their client
concerning the buying and selling of real estate.
(c) Dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious stones—when they engage
in any cash transaction with a customer equal to or above the applicable
designated threshold.
(d) Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants
when they prepare for or carry out transactions for their client concerning the
following activities:
—
buying and selling of real estate;
—
managing of client money, securities or other assets;
—
management of bank, savings or securities accounts;
—
organisation of contributions for the creation, operation or management
of companies;
—
creation, operation or management of legal persons or arrangements, and
buying and selling of business entities.
(e) Trust and company service providers when they prepare for or carry out trans-
actions for a client concerning the activities listed in the deﬁnition in the
Glossary.
Reporting of suspicious transactions and compliance
13. If a ﬁnancial institution suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that funds
are the proceeds of a criminal activity, or are related to terrorist ﬁnancing, it should
be required, directly by law or regulation, to report promptly its suspicions to the
ﬁnancial intelligence unit (FIU).
14. Financial institutions, their directors, oﬃcers and employees should be:
(a) Protected by legal provisions from criminal and civil liability for breach of
any restriction on disclosure of information imposed by contract or by any
legislative, regulatory or administrative provision, if they report their suspi-
cions in good faith to the FIU, even if they did not know precisely what the
underlying criminal activity was, and regardless of whether illegal activity
actually occurred.
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
888
 
www.ebook3000.com

(b) Prohibited by law from disclosing the fact that a suspicious transaction report
(STR) or related information is being reported to the FIU.
15. Financial institutions should develop programmes against money laundering and
terrorist ﬁnancing. These programmes should include:
(a) The development of internal policies, procedures and controls, including
appropriate compliance management arrangements, and adequate screening
procedures to ensure high standards when hiring employees.
(b) An ongoing employee training programme.
(c) An audit function to test the system.
16. The requirements set out in Recommendations 13 to 15, and 21 apply to all
designated non-ﬁnancial businesses and professions, subject to the following
qualiﬁcations:
(a) Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants
should be required to report suspicious transactions when, on behalf of or for
a client, they engage in a ﬁnancial transaction in relation to the activities
described in Recommendation 12(d). Countries are strongly encouraged to
extend the reporting requirement to the rest of the professional activities of
accountants, including auditing.
(b) Dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious stones should be required to
report suspicious transactions when they engage in any cash transaction with a
customer equal to or above the applicable designated threshold.
(c) Trust and company service providers should be required to report suspicious
transactions for a client when, on behalf of or for a client, they engage in a
transaction in relation to the activities referred to Recommendation 12(e).
Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals, and accountants
acting as independent legal professionals, are not required to report their sus-
picions if the relevant information was obtained in circumstances where they
are subject to professional secrecy or legal professional privilege.
Other measures to deter money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing
17. Countries should ensure that eﬀective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions,
whether criminal, civil or administrative, are available to deal with natural or legal
persons covered by these Recommendations that fail to comply with anti-money
laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing requirements.
18. Countries should not approve the establishment or accept the continued operation
of shell banks. Financial institutions should refuse to enter into, or continue, a cor-
respondent banking relationship with shell banks. Financial institutions should also
guard against establishing relations with respondent foreign ﬁnancial institutions
that permit their accounts to be used by shell banks.
19. Countries should consider the feasibility and utility of a system where banks and
other ﬁnancial institutions and intermediaries would report all domestic and inter-
national currency transactions above a ﬁxed amount, to a national central agency
with a computerised database, available to competent authorities for use in money
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
889
 

laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing cases, subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper
use of the information.
20. Countries should consider applying the FATF Recommendations to businesses
and professions, other than designated non-ﬁnancial businesses and professions,
that pose a money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing risk. Countries should further
encourage the development of modern and secure techniques of money management
that are less vulnerable to money laundering.
Measures to be taken with respect to countries that do not or insuﬃciently
comply with the FATF Recommendations
21. Financial institutions should give special attention to business relationships and
transactions with persons, including companies and ﬁnancial institutions, from
countries which do not or insuﬃciently apply the FATF Recommendations. When-
ever these transactions have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose,
their background and purpose should, as far as possible, be examined, the ﬁnd-
ings established in writing, and be available to help competent authorities.
Where such a country continues not to apply or insuﬃciently applies the FATF
Recommendations, countries should be able to apply appropriate countermeasures.
22. Financial institutions should ensure that the principles applicable to ﬁnancial
institutions, which are mentioned above are also applied to branches and majority
owned subsidiaries located abroad, especially in countries which do not or insuﬃ-
ciently apply the FATF Recommendations, to the extent that local applicable laws
and regulations permit. When local applicable laws and regulations prohibit this
implementation, competent authorities in the country of the parent institution
should be informed by the ﬁnancial institutions that they cannot apply the FATF
Recommendations.
Regulation and supervision
23. Countries should ensure that ﬁnancial institutions are subject to adequate regula-
tion and supervision and are eﬀectively implementing the FATF Recommenda-
tions. Competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory meas-
ures to prevent criminals or their associates from holding or being the beneﬁcial
owner of a signiﬁcant or controlling interest or holding a management function in
a ﬁnancial institution. For ﬁnancial institutions subject to the Core Principles, the
regulatory and supervisory measures that apply for prudential purposes and which
are also relevant to money laundering, should apply in a similar manner for anti-
money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing purposes. Other ﬁnancial institutions
should be licensed or registered and appropriately regulated, and subject to super-
vision or oversight for anti-money laundering purposes, having regard to the risk
of money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing in that sector. At a minimum, businesses
providing a service of money or value transfer, or of money or currency changing
should be licensed or registered, and subject to eﬀective systems for monitoring
and ensuring compliance with national requirements to combat money laundering
and terrorist ﬁnancing.

24. Designated non-ﬁnancial businesses and professions should be subject to regulatory
and supervisory measures as set out below.
(a) Casinos should be subject to a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory
regime that ensures that they have eﬀectively implemented the necessary
anti-money laundering and terrorist-ﬁnancing measures. At a minimum:
—
casinos should be licensed;
—
competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory meas-
ures to prevent criminals or their associates from holding or being the bene-
ﬁcial owner of a signiﬁcant or controlling interest, holding a management
function in, or being an operator of a casino;
—
competent authorities should ensure that casinos are eﬀectively super-
vised for compliance with requirements to combat money laundering and
terrorist ﬁnancing.
(b) Countries should ensure that the other categories of designated non-ﬁnancial
businesses and professions are subject to eﬀective systems for monitoring and
ensuring their compliance with requirements to combat money laundering
and terrorist ﬁnancing. This should be performed on a risk-sensitive basis. This
may be performed by a government authority or by an appropriate self-
regulatory organisation, provided that such an organisation can ensure that
its members comply with their obligations to combat money laundering and
terrorist ﬁnancing.
25. The competent authorities should establish guidelines, and provide feedback which
will assist ﬁnancial institutions and designated non-ﬁnancial businesses and profes-
sions in applying national measures to combat money laundering and terrorist
ﬁnancing, and in particular, in detecting and reporting suspicious transactions.
C. Institutional and other measures necessary in systems for combating
money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing
Competent authorities, their powers and resources
26. Countries should establish a FIU that serves as a national centre for the receiving
(and, as permitted, requesting), analysis and dissemination of STR and other
information regarding potential money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing. The FIU
should have access, directly or indirectly, on a timely basis to the ﬁnancial, adminis-
trative and law enforcement information that it requires to properly undertake its
functions, including the analysis of STR.
27. Countries should ensure that designated law enforcement authorities have res-
ponsibility for money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing investigations. Countries
are encouraged to support and develop, as far as possible, special investigative
techniques suitable for the investigation of money laundering, such as controlled
delivery, undercover operations and other relevant techniques. Countries are also
encouraged to use other eﬀective mechanisms such as the use of permanent or
temporary groups specialised in asset investigation, and co-operative investigations
with appropriate competent authorities in other countries.
28. When conducting investigations of money laundering and underlying predicate
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
891
 

oﬀences, competent authorities should be able to obtain documents and informa-
tion for use in those investigations, and in prosecutions and related actions. This
should include powers to use compulsory measures for the production of records
held by ﬁnancial institutions and other persons, for the search of persons and
premises, and for the seizure and obtaining of evidence.
29. Supervisors should have adequate powers to monitor and ensure compliance by
ﬁnancial institutions with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist
ﬁnancing, including the authority to conduct inspections. They should be author-
ised to compel production of any information from ﬁnancial institutions that is
relevant to monitoring such compliance, and to impose adequate administrative
sanctions for failure to comply with such requirements.
30. Countries should provide their competent authorities involved in combating
money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing with adequate ﬁnancial, human and
technical resources. Countries should have in place processes to ensure that the
staﬀ of those authorities are of high integrity.
31. Countries should ensure that policy makers, the FIU, law enforcement and super-
visors have eﬀective mechanisms in place which enable them to co-operate, and
where appropriate coordinate domestically with each other concerning the devel-
opment and implementation of policies and activities to combat money laundering
and terrorist ﬁnancing.
32. Countries should ensure that their competent authorities can review the eﬀective-
ness of their systems to combat money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing systems
by maintaining comprehensive statistics on matters relevant to the eﬀectiveness
and eﬃciency of such systems. This should include statistics on the STR received
and disseminated; on money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing investigations,
prosecutions and convictions; on property frozen, seized and conﬁscated; and on
mutual legal assistance or other international requests for co-operation.
Transparency of legal persons and arrangements
33. Countries should take measures to prevent the unlawful use of legal persons by
money launderers. Countries should ensure that there is adequate, accurate and
timely information on the beneﬁcial ownership and control of legal persons that
can be obtained or accessed in a timely fashion by competent authorities. In
particular, countries that have legal persons that are able to issue bearer shares
should take appropriate measures to ensure that they are not misused for money
laundering and be able to demonstrate the adequacy of those measures. Countries
could consider measures to facilitate access to beneﬁcial ownership and control
information to ﬁnancial institutions undertaking the requirements set out in
Recommendation 5.
34. Countries should take measures to prevent the unlawful use of legal arrangements
by money launderers. In particular, countries should ensure that there is adequate,
accurate and timely information on express trusts, including information on the
settlor, trustee and beneﬁciaries, that can be obtained or accessed in a timely fash-
ion by competent authorities. Countries could consider measures to facilitate
access to beneﬁcial ownership and control information to ﬁnancial institutions
undertaking the requirements set out in Recommendation 5.

D. International co-operation
35. Countries should take immediate steps to become party to and implement fully the
Vienna Convention, the Palermo Convention, and the 1999 United Nations Inter-
national Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Countries
are also encouraged to ratify and implement other relevant international conven-
tions, such as the 1990 Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search,
Seizure and Conﬁscation of the Proceeds from Crime and the 2002 Inter-American
Convention against Terrorism.
Mutual legal assistance and extradition
36. Countries should rapidly, constructively and eﬀectively provide the widest possible
range of mutual legal assistance in relation to money laundering and terrorist
ﬁnancing investigations, prosecutions, and related proceedings. In particular, coun-
tries should:
(a) Not prohibit or place unreasonable or unduly restrictive conditions on the
provision of mutual legal assistance.
(b) Ensure that they have clear and eﬃcient processes for the execution of mutual
legal assistance requests.
(c) Not refuse to execute a request for mutual legal assistance on the sole ground
that the oﬀence is also considered to involve ﬁscal matters.
(d) Not refuse to execute a request for mutual legal assistance on the grounds that
laws require ﬁnancial institutions to maintain secrecy or conﬁdentiality. Coun-
tries should ensure that the powers of their competent authorities required
under Recommendation 28 are also available for use in response to requests for
mutual legal assistance, and if consistent with their domestic framework, in
response to direct requests from foreign judicial or law enforcement authorities
to domestic counterparts. To avoid conﬂicts of jurisdiction, consideration
should be given to devising and applying mechanisms for determining the best
venue for prosecution of defendants in the interests of justice in cases that are
subject to prosecution in more than one country.
37. Countries should, to the greatest extent possible, render mutual legal assistance
notwithstanding the absence of dual criminality. Where dual criminality is required
for mutual legal assistance or extradition, that requirement should be deemed to be
satisﬁed regardless of whether both countries place the oﬀence within the same
category of oﬀence or denominate the oﬀence by the same terminology, provided
that both countries criminalise the conduct underlying the oﬀence.
38. There should be authority to take expeditious action in response to requests by
foreign countries to identify, freeze, seize and conﬁscate property laundered, pro-
ceeds from money laundering or predicate oﬀences, instrumentalities used in or
intended for use in the commission of these oﬀences, or property of corresponding
value. There should also be arrangements for co-ordinating seizure and conﬁsca-
tion proceedings, which may include the sharing of conﬁscated assets.
39. Countries should recognise money laundering as an extraditable oﬀence. Each
country should either extradite its own nationals, or where a country does not do so
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
893
 

solely on the grounds of nationality, that country should, at the request of the
country seeking extradition, submit the case without undue delay to its competent
authorities for the purpose of prosecution of the oﬀences set forth in the request.
Those authorities should take their decision and conduct their proceedings in the
same manner as in the case of any other oﬀence of a serious nature under the
domestic law of that country. The countries concerned should cooperate with each
other, in particular on procedural and evidentiary aspects, to ensure the eﬃciency
of such prosecutions. Subject to their legal frameworks, countries may consider
simplifying extradition by allowing direct transmission of extradition requests
between appropriate ministries, extraditing persons based only on warrants of
arrests or judgments, and/or introducing a simpliﬁed extradition of consenting
persons who waive formal extradition proceedings.
Other forms of co-operation
40. Countries should ensure that their competent authorities provide the widest possible
range of international co-operation to their foreign counterparts. There should be
clear and eﬀective gateways to facilitate the prompt and constructive exchange
directly between counterparts, either spontaneously or upon request, of information
relating to both money laundering and the underlying predicate oﬀences. Exchanges
should be permitted without unduly restrictive conditions. In particular:
(a) Competent authorities should not refuse a request for assistance on the sole
ground that the request is also considered to involve ﬁscal matters.
(b) Countries should not invoke laws that require ﬁnancial institutions to maintain
secrecy or conﬁdentiality as a ground for refusing to provide co-operation.
(c) Competent authorities should be able to conduct inquiries; and where possible,
investigations; on behalf of foreign counterparts.
Where the ability to obtain information sought by a foreign competent authority
is not within the mandate of its counterpart, countries are also encouraged to
permit a prompt and constructive exchange of information with non-counterparts.
Co-operation with foreign authorities other than counterparts could occur directly
or indirectly. When uncertain about the appropriate avenue to follow, competent
authorities should ﬁrst contact their foreign counterparts for assistance.
Countries should establish controls and safeguards to ensure that information
exchanged by competent authorities is used only in an authorised manner, consistent
with their obligations concerning privacy and data protection.

very limited basis (having regard to quantitative and absolute criteria) such that there
is little risk of money laundering activity occurring, a country may decide that
the application of anti-money laundering measures is not necessary, either fully or
partially.
In strictly limited and justiﬁed circumstances, and based on a proven low risk of
money laundering, a country may decide not to apply some or all of the Forty
Recommendations to some of the ﬁnancial activities stated above.

Reference in this document to ‘countries’ should be taken to apply equally to
‘territories’ or ‘jurisdictions’.

2.
Recommendations 5–16 and 21–22 state that ﬁnancial institutions or designated
non-ﬁnancial businesses and professions should take certain actions. These refer-
ences require countries to take measures that will oblige ﬁnancial institutions or
designated non-ﬁnancial businesses and professions to comply with each Recom-
mendation. The basic obligations under Recommendations 5, 10 and 13 should be
set out in law or regulation, while more detailed elements in those Recommenda-
tions, as well as obligations under other Recommendations, could be required
either by law or regulation or by other enforceable means issued by a competent
authority.
3.
Where reference is made to a ﬁnancial institution being satisﬁed as to a matter, that
institution must be able to justify its assessment to competent authorities.
4.
To comply with Recommendations 12 and 16, countries do not need to issue
laws or regulations that relate exclusively to lawyers, notaries, accountants and the
other designated non-ﬁnancial businesses and professions so long as these busi-
nesses or professions are included in laws or regulations covering the underlying
activities.
5.
The Interpretative Notes that apply to ﬁnancial institutions are also relevant to
designated non-ﬁnancial businesses and professions, where applicable.
Recommendations 5, 12 and 16
The designated thresholds for transactions (under Recommendations 5 and 12) are as
follows:
—
Financial institutions (for occasional customers under Recommendation 5)—
USD/EUR 15,000.
—
Casinos, including internet casinos (under Recommendation 12)—USD/EUR 3,000
—
For dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious stones when engaged in any
cash transaction (under Recommendations 12 and 16)—USD/EUR 15,000.
Financial transactions above a designated threshold include situations where the trans-
action is carried out in a single operation or in several operations that appear to be
linked.
Recommendation 5
CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE AND TIPPING OFF
1.
If, during the establishment or course of the customer relationship, or when
conducting occasional transactions, a ﬁnancial institution suspects that trans-
actions relate to money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing, then the institution
should:
(a) Normally seek to identify and verify the identity of the customer and the
beneﬁcial owner, whether permanent or occasional, and irrespective of any
exemption or any designated threshold that might otherwise apply.
(b) Make a STR to the FIU in accordance with Recommendation 13.
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
898
 
www.ebook3000.com

2.
Recommendation 14 prohibits ﬁnancial institutions, their directors, oﬃcers and
employees from disclosing the fact that an STR or related information is being
reported to the FIU. A risk exists that customers could be unintentionally tipped
oﬀ when the ﬁnancial institution is seeking to perform its customer due diligence
(CDD) obligations in these circumstances. The customer’s awareness of a possible
STR or investigation could compromise future eﬀorts to investigate the suspected
money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing operation.
3.
Therefore, if ﬁnancial institutions form a suspicion that transactions relate to
money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing, they should take into account the risk of
tipping oﬀ when performing the customer due diligence process. If the institution
reasonably believes that performing the CDD process will tip-oﬀ the customer or
potential customer, it may choose not to pursue that process, and should ﬁle an
STR. Institutions should ensure that their employees are aware of and sensitive
to these issues when conducting CDD.
CDD FOR LEGAL PERSONS AND ARRANGEMENTS
4.
When performing elements (a) and (b) of the CDD process in relation to legal
persons or arrangements, ﬁnancial institutions should:
(a) Verify that any person purporting to act on behalf of the customer is so
authorised, and identify that person.
(b) Identify the customer and verify its identity—the types of measures that would
be normally needed to satisfactorily perform this function would require
obtaining proof of incorporation or similar evidence of the legal status of the
legal person or arrangement, as well as information concerning the customer’s
name, the names of trustees, legal form, address, directors, and provisions
regulating the power to bind the legal person or arrangement.
(c) Identify the beneﬁcial owners, including forming an understanding of the
ownership and control structure, and take reasonable measures to verify the
identity of such persons. The types of measures that would be normally needed
to satisfactorily perform this function would require identifying the natural
persons with a controlling interest and identifying the natural persons who
comprise the mind and management of the legal person or arrangement.
Where the customer or the owner of the controlling interest is a public com-
pany that is subject to regulatory disclosure requirements, it is not necessary
to seek to identify and verify the identity of any shareholder of that company.
The relevant information or data may be obtained from a public register, from
the customer or from other reliable sources.
RELIANCE ON IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION ALREADY PERFORMED
5.
The CDD measures set out in Recommendation 5 do not imply that ﬁnancial
institutions have to repeatedly identify and verify the identity of each customer
every time that a customer conducts a transaction. An institution is entitled to rely
on the identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation steps that it has already undertaken unless it
has doubts about the veracity of that information.
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
899
 

Examples of situations that might lead an institution to have such doubts could be
where there is a suspicion of money laundering in relation to that customer, or
where there is a material change in the way that the customer’s account is operated
which is not consistent with the customer’s business proﬁle.
TIMING OF VERIFICATION
6.
Examples of the types of circumstances where it would be permissible for veri-
ﬁcation to be completed after the establishment of the business relationship,
because it would be essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of business
include:
—
Non face-to-face business.
—
Securities transactions. In the securities industry, companies and intermediar-
ies may be required to perform transactions very rapidly, according to the
market conditions at the time the customer is contacting them, and the per-
formance of the transaction may be required before veriﬁcation of identity is
completed.
— Life insurance business. In relation to life insurance business, countries may
permit the identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation of the beneﬁciary under the policy to
take place after having established the business relationship with the policy-
holder. However, in all such cases, identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation should occur
at or before the time of payout or the time where the beneﬁciary intends to
exercise vested rights under the policy.
7.
Financial institutions will also need to adopt risk management procedures with
respect to the conditions under which a customer may utilise the business relation-
ship prior to veriﬁcation. These procedures should include a set of measures such
as a limitation of the number, types and/or amount of transactions that can be
performed and the monitoring of large or complex transactions being carried out
outside of expected norms for that type of relationship. Financial institutions
should refer to the Basel CDD paper (section 2.2.6.) for speciﬁc guidance on
examples of risk management measures for non-face to face business.
REQUIREMENT TO IDENTIFY EXISTING CUSTOMERS
8.
The principles set out in the Basel CDD paper concerning the identiﬁcation of
existing customers should serve as guidance when applying customer due diligence
processes to institutions engaged in banking activity, and could apply to other
ﬁnancial institutions where relevant.
SIMPLIFIED OR REDUCED CDD MEASURES
9.
The general rule is that customers must be subject to the full range of CDD
measures, including the requirement to identify the beneﬁcial owner. Nevertheless
there are circumstances where the risk of money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing is
lower, where information on the identity of the customer and the beneﬁcial owner
of a customer is publicly available, or where adequate checks and controls exist
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
900
 
www.ebook3000.com

elsewhere in national systems. In such circumstances it could be reasonable for a
country to allow its ﬁnancial institutions to apply simpliﬁed or reduced CDD
measures when identifying and verifying the identity of the customer and the
beneﬁcial owner.
10. Examples of customers where simpliﬁed or reduced CDD measures could apply
are:
—
Financial institutions—where they are subject to requirements to com-
bat money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing consistent with the FATF
Recommendations and are supervised for compliance with those controls.
10
‘Basel CDD paper’ refers to the guidance paper on Customer Due Diligence for
Banks issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in October 2001.
— Public companies that are subject to regulatory disclosure requirements.
— Government administrations or enterprises.
11. Simpliﬁed or reduced CDD measures could also apply to the beneﬁcial owners of
pooled accounts held by designated non ﬁnancial businesses or professions provided
that those businesses or professions are subject to requirements to combat money
laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing consistent with the FATF Recommendations
and are subject to eﬀective systems for monitoring and ensuring their compli-
ance with those requirements. Banks should also refer to the Basel CDD paper
(section 2.2.4.), which provides speciﬁc guidance concerning situations where an
account holding institution may rely on a customer that is a professional ﬁnancial
intermediary to perform the customer due diligence on his or its own customers
(i.e. the beneﬁcial owners of the bank account). Where relevant, the CDD Paper
could also provide guidance in relation to similar accounts held by other types of
ﬁnancial institutions.
12. Simpliﬁed CDD or reduced measures could also be acceptable for various types
of products or transactions such as (examples only):
—
Life insurance policies where the annual premium is no more than USD/EUR
1,000 or a single premium of no more than USD/EUR 2,500.
—
Insurance policies for pension schemes if there is no surrender clause and the
policy cannot be used as collateral.
—
A pension, superannuation or similar scheme that provides retirement beneﬁts
to employees, where contributions are made by way of deduction from wages
and the scheme rules do not permit the assignment of a member’s interest
under the scheme.
13. Countries could also decide whether ﬁnancial institutions could apply these sim-
pliﬁed measures only to customers in its own jurisdiction or allow them to do for
customers from any other jurisdiction that the original country is satisﬁed is in
compliance with and has eﬀectively implemented the FATF Recommendations.
Simpliﬁed CDD measures are not acceptable whenever there is suspicion of money
laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing or speciﬁc higher risk scenarios apply.

Recommendation 6
Countries are encouraged to extend the requirements of Recommendation 6 to indi-
viduals who hold prominent public functions in their own country.
Recommendation 9
This Recommendation does not apply to outsourcing or agency relationships. This
Recommendation also does not apply to relationships, accounts or transactions
between ﬁnancial institutions for their clients. Those relationships are addressed by
Recommendations 5 and 7.
Recommendations 10 and 11
In relation to insurance business, the word ‘transactions’ should be understood to refer
to the insurance product itself, the premium payment and the beneﬁts.
Recommendation 13
1.
The reference to criminal activity in Recommendation 13 refers to:
(a) all criminal acts that would constitute a predicate oﬀence for money laundering
in the jurisdiction; or
(b) at a minimum to those oﬀences that would constitute a predicate oﬀence as
required by Recommendation 1.
Countries are strongly encouraged to adopt alternative (a). All suspicious trans-
actions, including attempted transactions, should be reported regardless of the
amount of the transaction.
2.
In implementing Recommendation 13, suspicious transactions should be reported
by ﬁnancial institutions regardless of whether they are also thought to involve tax
matters. Countries should take into account that, in order to deter ﬁnancial institu-
tions from reporting a suspicious transaction, money launderers may seek to state
inter alia that their transactions relate to tax matters.
Recommendation 14 (tipping oﬀ)
Where lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants acting
as independent legal professionals seek to dissuade a client from engaging in illegal
activity, this does not amount to tipping oﬀ.
Recommendation 15
The type and extent of measures to be taken for each of the requirements set out in the
Recommendation should be appropriate having regard to the risk of money laundering
and terrorist ﬁnancing and the size of the business.
For ﬁnancial institutions, compliance management arrangements should include the
appointment of a compliance oﬃcer at the management level.

Recommendation 16
1.
It is for each jurisdiction to determine the matters that would fall under legal
professional privilege or professional secrecy. This would normally cover informa-
tion lawyers, notaries or other independent legal professionals receive from or
obtain through one of their clients: (a) in the course of ascertaining the legal
position of their client, or (b) in performing their task of defending or representing
that client in, or concerning judicial, administrative, arbitration or mediation
proceedings. Where accountants are subject to the same obligations of secrecy or
privilege, then they are also not required to report suspicious transactions.
2.
Countries may allow lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals
and accountants to send their STR to their appropriate self-regulatory organisa-
tions, provided that there are appropriate forms of co-operation between these
organisations and the FIU.
Recommendation 23
Recommendation 23 should not be read as to require the introduction of a system of
regular review of licensing of controlling interests in ﬁnancial institutions merely for
anti-money laundering purposes, but as to stress the desirability of suitability review
for controlling shareholders in ﬁnancial institutions (banks and non-banks in partic-
ular) from a FATF point of view. Hence, where shareholder suitability (or ‘ﬁt and
proper’) tests exist, the attention of supervisors should be drawn to their relevance for
anti-money laundering purposes.
Recommendation 25
When considering the feedback that should be provided, countries should have regard
to the FATF Best Practice Guidelines on Providing Feedback to Reporting Financial
Institutions and Other Persons.
Recommendation 26
Where a country has created an FIU, it should consider applying for membership in
the Egmont Group. Countries should have regard to the Egmont Group Statement of
Purpose, and its Principles for Information Exchange Between Financial Intelligence
Units for Money Laundering Cases. These documents set out important guidance
concerning the role and functions of FIUs, and the mechanisms for exchanging
information between FIU.
Recommendation 27
Countries should consider taking measures, including legislative ones, at the national
level, to allow their competent authorities investigating money laundering cases to
postpone or waive the arrest of suspected persons and/or the seizure of the money
for the purpose of identifying persons involved in such activities or for evidence gather-
ing. Without such measures the use of procedures such as controlled deliveries and
undercover operations are precluded.

Recommendation 38
Countries should consider:
(a) Establishing an asset forfeiture fund in its respective country into which all or a
portion of conﬁscated property will be deposited for law enforcement, health,
education, or other appropriate purposes.
(b) Taking such measures as may be necessary to enable it to share among or between
other countries conﬁscated property, in particular, when conﬁscation is directly or
indirectly a result of co-ordinated law enforcement actions.
Recommendation 40
1.
For the purposes of this Recommendation:
— ‘Counterparts’ refers to authorities that exercise similar responsibilities and
functions.
— ‘Competent authority’ refers to all administrative and law enforcement author-
ities concerned with combating money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing,
including the FIU and supervisors.
2.
Depending on the type of competent authority involved and the nature and pur-
pose of the cooperation, diﬀerent channels can be appropriate for the exchange of
information. Examples of mechanisms or channels that are used to exchange
information include: bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements, memo-
randa of understanding, exchanges on the basis of reciprocity, or through appro-
priate international or regional organisations. However, this Recommendation is
not intended to cover co-operation in relation to mutual legal assistance or
extradition.
3.
The reference to indirect exchange of information with foreign authorities other
than counterparts covers the situation where the requested information passes from
the foreign authority through one or more domestic or foreign authorities before
being received by the requesting authority. The competent authority that requests
the information should always make it clear for what purpose and on whose behalf
the request is made.
4.
FIUs should be able to make inquiries on behalf of foreign counterparts where this
could be relevant to an analysis of ﬁnancial transactions. At a minimum, inquiries
should include:
—
Searching its own databases, which would include information related to
suspicious transaction reports.
—
Searching other databases to which it may have direct or indirect access, includ-
ing law enforcement databases, public databases, administrative databases and
commercially available databases.
Where permitted to do so, FIUs should also contact other competent authorities
and ﬁnancial institutions in order to obtain relevant information.

3. FATF Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing
Recognising the vital importance of taking action to combat the ﬁnancing of terror-
ism, the FATF has agreed these Recommendations, which, when combined with the
FATF Forty Recommendations on money laundering, set out the basic framework to
detect, prevent and suppress the ﬁnancing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
I. Ratiﬁcation and implementation of UN instruments
Each country should take immediate steps to ratify and to implement fully the 1999
United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism.
Countries should also immediately implement the United Nations resolutions relat-
ing to the prevention and suppression of the ﬁnancing of terrorist acts, particularly
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373.
II. Criminalising the ﬁnancing of terrorism and associated money
laundering
Each country should criminalise the ﬁnancing of terrorism, terrorist acts and terrorist
organisations. Countries should ensure that such oﬀences are designated as money
laundering predicate oﬀences.
III. Freezing and conﬁscating terrorist assets
Each country should implement measures to freeze without delay funds or other assets
of terrorists, those who ﬁnance terrorism and terrorist organisations in accordance
with the United Nations resolutions relating to the prevention and suppression of the
ﬁnancing of terrorist acts.
Each country should also adopt and implement measures, including legislative ones,
which would enable the competent authorities to seize and conﬁscate property that
is the proceeds of, or used in, or intended or allocated for use in, the ﬁnancing of
terrorism, terrorist acts or terrorist organisations.
IV. Reporting suspicious transactions related to terrorism
If ﬁnancial institutions, or other businesses or entities subject to anti-money launder-
ing obligations, suspect or have reasonable grounds to suspect that funds are linked
or related to, or are to be used for terrorism, terrorist acts or by terrorist organisa-
tions, they should be required to report promptly their suspicions to the competent
authorities.
V. International co-operation
Each country should aﬀord another country, on the basis of a treaty, arrangement or
other mechanism for mutual legal assistance or information exchange, the greatest
possible measure of assistance in connection with criminal, civil enforcement, and
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
905
 

administrative investigations, inquiries and proceedings relating to the ﬁnancing of
terrorism, terrorist acts and terrorist organisations.
Countries should also take all possible measures to ensure that they do not provide
safe havens for individuals charged with the ﬁnancing of terrorism, terrorist acts
or terrorist organisations, and should have procedures in place to extradite, where
possible, such individuals.
VI. Alternative remittance
Each country should take measures to ensure that persons or legal entities, including
agents, that provide a service for the transmission of money or value, including trans-
mission through an informal money or value transfer system or network, should be
licensed or registered and subject to all the FATF Recommendations that apply to
banks and non-bank ﬁnancial institutions. Each country should ensure that persons or
legal entities that carry out this service illegally are subject to administrative, civil or
criminal sanctions.
VII. Wire transfers
Countries should take measures to require ﬁnancial institutions, including money
remitters, to include accurate and meaningful originator information (name, address
and account number) on funds transfers and related messages that are sent, and the
information should remain with the transfer or related message through the payment
chain.
Countries should take measures to ensure that ﬁnancial institutions, including
money remitters, conduct enhanced scrutiny of and monitor for suspicious activity
funds transfers which do not contain complete originator information (name, address
and account number).
VIII. Non-proﬁt organisations
Countries should review the adequacy of laws and regulations that relate to entities that
can be abused for the ﬁnancing of terrorism. Non-proﬁt organisations are particularly
vulnerable, and countries should ensure that they cannot be misused:
(i)
by terrorist organisations posing as legitimate entities;
(ii) to exploit legitimate entities as conduits for terrorist ﬁnancing, including for the
purpose of escaping asset freezing measures; and
(iii) to conceal or obscure the clandestine diversion of funds intended for legitimate
purposes to terrorist organisations.

4. Sharing of Financial Records between Jurisdictions in
Connection with the Fight against Terrorist Financing
Summary of a meeting of representatives of supervisors and legal experts
of G10 central banks and supervisory authorities on 14 December 2001,
Basel, Switzerland
(a) Introduction
1.
On 14 December 2001, bank supervisors and legal experts of G10 central banks
and supervisory authorities met at the BIS to discuss how to prevent the abuse of
the ﬁnancial system when it is used to ﬁnance terrorism, and, speciﬁcally, issues
relating to the sharing of ﬁnancial records between jurisdictions to assist in the
ﬁght against terrorism. The meeting provided an opportunity for participants to
review international developments directed at terrorism, and to consider speciﬁc
assistance that central banks and banking supervisors might provide. The partici-
pants discussed measures that had been taken in their jurisdictions to combat
terrorist ﬁnancing and surveyed mechanisms for the sharing of ﬁnancial records
between national jurisdictions. In many of the countries represented at the meeting,
legislation has been or is in the course of being amended to provide for sanctions to
deter terrorist activities, including measures to deter terrorist ﬁnancing.
2.
All participants fully embraced the goal of combating terrorism and shared the
view of the Chairman of the Basel Committee that measures to impede terrorist
ﬁnancing are critical. The participants agreed with the Chairman that the Basel
Committee should add its voice condemning terrorism to that of the United
Nations Security Council and the Financial Action Task Force of the OECD.
3.
Participants agreed that the size and geographical scope of the international
ﬁnancial system make it imperative to signiﬁcantly improve coordination and
collaboration between all the parties involved if measures to identify and prevent
terrorist ﬁnancing are to succeed. Central banks and bank supervisors are typically
not in the front line of these eﬀorts. Nevertheless, because terrorism is a threat to
ﬁnancial stability, the participants agreed that central banks and banking super-
visors should lend their expertise and resources to those that are more directly
involved, including treasuries, judicial authorities and law enforcement authorities
such as ﬁnancial intelligence units. The collaboration needs to operate both at a
domestic level between all parties concerned and also, to the extent possible, at
an international level. This means that gateways need to exist for information to be
transmitted within and across national borders.
4.
Participants reported that even at the domestic level there had been clear evidence
of intelligence failures because diﬀerent strands of information had not been cen-
trally collected and analysed. Many countries have created inter-agency task forces
in order to remedy this problem and have become more eﬀective in halting terrorist
ﬁnancing (including improving their responses to the lists of suspected terrorist
names being circulated).
5.
The focus of the 14 December 2001 meeting was on banking activities and on
the possibilities of preventing the global ﬁnancial system from being misused to
support terrorist activities. The participants noted that this cannot be achieved
unless ﬁnancial services providers have eﬀective ‘know your customer’ (KYC) and
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
907
 

customer due diligence (CDD) procedures and that some of the methods that
might be used by terrorists to move money, such as the postal giro network and
private wire transfer systems, may not be within the jurisdiction of central banks or
banking supervisors. This underscores the need to introduce or improve KYC and
CDD standards for all categories of institutions that provide ﬁnancial services.
6.
Participants emphasized the need to share information about terrorist ﬁnancing—
including the identities of those who might use the global ﬁnancial system to
support terrorism and the patterns of ﬁnancing activities associated with such
support—between diﬀerent national jurisdictions. Discussion focused on two mech-
anisms for information ﬂows (a) from a governmental body in one country to a
governmental body in another country, using an oﬃcial gateway or some less for-
mal channel and (b) within a single ﬁnancial group (i.e. between a ﬁnancial entity
operating in one country and its head oﬃce or parent institution in a diﬀerent
country).
(b) Oﬃcial gateways for cross-border information sharing
7.
The participants identiﬁed three oﬃcial gateways for sharing information between
national jurisdictions:
(i)
The classical gateway, usually embodied in a treaty for mutual legal assistance
(‘MLAT’), provides a legal basis for transmitting evidence that can be used
for prosecution and judicial procedures. This is of course not conﬁned to
ﬁnancial crime. This gateway, which typically involves formalised procedures,
is not customarily used for supervisory or regulatory matters.
(ii)
The second oﬃcial gateway involves a communication between ﬁnancial
intelligence units (FIUs) or other bodies set up to ﬁght ﬁnancial crime. The
FIUs, with the task of receiving and analysing suspicious transaction reports
on an ongoing basis and maintaining close links with police and customs
authorities, are presently mostly engaged in tracking terrorist funds and fol-
lowing up reports of potential terrorist accounts. FIUs share information
between themselves informally in the context of investigations, usually on the
basis of memoranda of understanding (MOU). The Egmont Group of FIUs
has established a model for such MOU. Unlike the MLAT, this gateway is not
ordinarily used for obtaining evidence, but it is used for obtaining intelligence
that might lead to evidence.
(iii)
The third oﬃcial gateway is the supervisory channel. In relation to banking
activities, the information is normally of a general character, designed to
monitor the soundness of the banking group. Increasingly in the recent past,
however, enquiries have related more to speciﬁc asset or liability accounts
because of concerns about reputation and legal risk. A recent example
concerns accounts for politically exposed persons. The ability to share infor-
mation is often deﬁned in the legal framework under which the supervisor
operates, but it may also be supported by a MOU. Unlike the MLAT, the
MOU is not a treaty and usually is not binding on the governments. Instead,
it reﬂects the mutual understanding of the signing supervisory authorities’
policies. The MOU may be especially valuable where other types of entities,
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
908
 
www.ebook3000.com

such as securities or trading ﬁrms, are within the jurisdiction of a speciﬁc
authority, because that authority could share information on customer trans-
actions throughout a larger segment of the ﬁnancial market. Information
communicated through the supervisory gateway usually is communicated
for supervisory purposes only, and may therefore not ordinarily be used as
evidence, nor be shared widely among governmental entities.
8.
While each of these gateways is used to communicate ﬁnancial information across
a national border, the information received through each respective gateway serves
a diﬀerent purpose. Of course, these purposes may also complement one another
with respect to an overall objective like ﬁghting terrorism. If a prosecutor needs
information to prosecute a criminal case of terrorism, the prosecutor will ordinar-
ily use a MLAT. If a FIU in a host country learns information suggesting that a
branch or subsidiary of a banking group has an account for a known terrorist
organisation, the FIU may pass that intelligence information to the FIU in the
home country for the group. If a bank supervisor in the jurisdiction where such a
branch or subsidiary has the account learns about it, then that host supervisor may
well pass the information along to the home supervisor for the Group. The overall
ﬁght against terrorism needs coordination among prosecutors, ﬁnancial intelli-
gence units, and banking supervisors in the aﬀected jurisdictions. While the spirit
and level of cooperation demonstrated in the aftermath of September 11th far
exceeded past experience, many of the participants in the meeting felt that further
work needed to be done to coordinate between interested governmental bodies,
within a jurisdiction and, particularly, across national boundaries.
9.
The participants felt that this need was demonstrated recently in the case of the
circulation of ‘control lists’ of individuals suspected to be involved in terrorism. In
particular, both the circulation of the lists within ﬁnancial groups and the reporting
mechanisms for feedback did not operate uniformly. Participants were of the view
that the FIU channel is in most cases the most eﬀective gateway in such circum-
stances. The eﬃciency of this gateway would, however, be impaired if the involved
authorities did not collaborate closely. A breakdown in communication could
occur between FIUs, or between an FIU and a banking supervisor within the
same country. The participants believed that further work delineating sharing
arrangements is desirable, particularly with respect to the ﬁght against terrorism.
(c) Information ﬂow from a ﬁnancial entity to its head oﬃce/parent
10. The ﬁrst line of defence against terrorist ﬁnancing is for those involved in terrorism
to be denied all support, which includes a denial of access to the ﬁnancial system.
Strenuous eﬀorts have been made over recent years to prohibit the use of the
ﬁnancial system by criminal elements and these eﬀorts are now being reviewed to
ensure they reﬂect the terrorist threat. The identiﬁcation of the customer is key and
this is the object of the Customer Due Diligence paper issued in October 2001 by
the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision.
That paper emphasises the signiﬁcant risks, notably reputational risk, for banks
that do not have suﬃcient KYC procedures. The procedures should apply both
to the initial identiﬁcation process and the ongoing monitoring of higher risk
M E A S U R E S  A D O P T E D  B Y  T H E  F I NA N C I A L  AC T I O N  TA S K  F O RC E
909
 

accounts. Responsibility for this task lies with the banks’ compliance oﬃcers under
the overall direction of top management and subject to review in the supervisory
process.
11. The monitoring of reputational risk needs to be conducted for an institution on a
worldwide basis. For that reason, the CDD paper stresses that the risk management
process must embrace all foreign branches and subsidiaries, even if they are subject
to lower KYC standards in some jurisdictions. Banks require a centralised risk
management system that is overseen by the group’s chief compliance oﬃcer. The
centralised risk management system can utilise one of two approaches in obtaining
its information:
(i) The ﬁrst is the creation of a centralised database or register at the parent bank.
However, many foreign branches and subsidiaries are not permitted to transmit
the customer ﬁles outside of their jurisdiction. In some cases, this may be
forbidden by the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch or subsidiary is
located. In other cases, particularly where oﬀshore centres oﬀering private
banking services are concerned, the local branch or subsidiary may maintain
that its business with nationals of its home country will be handicapped if
ﬁnancial records containing customer names ﬁnd their way back to the author-
ities at the headquarters of the parent bank. The reason for this is usually
tax-related, but there are other reasons why customers may wish to keep their
ﬁnancial records conﬁdential.
(ii) In the second approach, a centralised database would not be maintained at
the parent bank, but information would be kept at branches and subsidiaries
and made available to the parent bank on request, or at the initiative of the
branches and subsidiaries when the reputation or liability of the group could be
threatened by the relationship. This approach would allow ﬁnancial groups to
determine their own organisational structure, yet branches and subsidiaries
would be expected to maintain rigorous risk management systems for due dili-
gence purposes, and the adequacy of these systems would be reviewed by home
supervisory authorities. In the case of a relationship with a person believed to
be involved in terrorism, the participants felt the relationship should be dis-
closed to the centralised risk manager. The participants felt that a banking
group should require such disclosure as a matter of policy.
12. Participants recognise that the Basel Committee already has taken a number of
steps to persuade banks to adopt centralised risk management systems. However,
they felt that further attention should be paid to this practice in the light of recent
developments, with speciﬁc reference to the ability of the group compliance oﬃcer to
access names of all the bank’s customers in its overseas branches and subsidiaries,
especially if any of those names were suspected to be associated with terrorism.
(d) Conclusions
13. Participants suggested that the Basel Committee add its voice condemning terrorism
to that of the United Nations Security Council and the FATF. The Basel Committee
should also acknowledge that terrorism threatens ﬁnancial stability, and the threat
needs to be met with collective actions to identify and halt terrorist ﬁnancing.

14. The participants believed that adequate means for group wide centralised risk
assessment is essential, as the provision of ﬁnancial services to terrorists would
expose the group to material reputational and legal risk. Furthermore, best prac-
tices of consolidated home country supervision require that a home country
supervisor must know if any foreign branch or subsidiary of a group for which
it acted as consolidated supervisor were providing ﬁnancial services to terrorists.
This kind of signiﬁcant supervisory information needs to reach the consolidated
supervisor, in the view of the participants, and must ﬂow across the national
border.
15. Participants suggested the Basel Committee consider further work to be done on
best practices for controlling reputational and legal risk arising from a relationship
with a terrorist organisation by any part of a banking group, such as by remitting
the matter to the Cross-border Banking Working Group to provide additional
guidance regarding, for example, the importance of an eﬀective centralised risk
management program to eﬀectively control reputational, compliance and legal
risks.
16. Participants suggested further that the Basel Committee consider asking the legal
experts of the G10 central banks and supervisory authorities and/or other legal
experts (including, if appropriate, FIU experts) to explore current impediments to
(i) sharing information on terrorist ﬁnancing and develop guidelines for passing
information across borders to other interested parties, particularly in the case of
sharing information between host and home supervisors, and (ii) treating ﬁnancial
groups as single entities for the purpose of sharing information within the group.
Other areas for additional work could include developing best practices for the
sharing of information by an FIU with a banking supervisor within the same
country where the banking supervisor acts as the consolidated supervisor for a
banking group where a component of that group has a ﬁnancial relationship
with an identiﬁed terrorist, as well as best practices for collecting and sharing
information where no FIU exists within a particular country.

[1] At 1903 hours on 22 December 1988 PanAm ﬂight 103 fell out of the sky. The 259
passengers and crew members who were on board and 11 residents of Lockerbie where
the debris fell were killed. The Crown case is that the cause of the disaster was that an
explosive device had been introduced into the hold of the aircraft by the two accused
whether acting alone or in concert with each other and others. This device exploded
when the aircraft was in Scottish air space thus causing the aircraft to disintegrate. In
these circumstances it was originally contended that the accused were guilty of con-
spiracy to murder, alternatively murder, alternatively a contravention of section 2(1) and
(5) of the Aviation Security Act 1982. At the conclusion of the Crown’s submissions,
however, the libel was restricted to the charge of murder.
[2] It is not disputed, and was amply proved, that the cause of the disaster was
indeed the explosion of a device within the aircraft. Nor is it disputed that the person
or persons who were responsible for the deliberate introduction of the explosive device
would be guilty of the crime of murder. The matter at issue in this trial therefore is
whether or not the Crown have proved beyond reasonable doubt that one or other
or both of the accused was responsible, actor or art and part, for the deliberate
introduction of the device.
[3] After the disaster a massive police operation was mounted to recover as much as
possible of the debris in order to ascertain the cause of the crash. Tens of thousands of
items were recovered, sifted and recorded, and any that appeared to be of particular
interest as indicating a possible cause of the explosion were examined by the relevant
specialists.
[4] All the parts of the aircraft that were recovered were taken initially to a hangar in
Longtown where they were examined by inspectors of the Air Accidents Investigation
Board (‘AAIB’). Subsequently the relevant part of the aircraft was reconstructed as
far as possible at Farnborough. It was found that the majority of the fractures in the
skin of the fuselage were overload fractures consistent with the type of damage to be
expected from the airborne break-up of an aircraft structure. There was however an
area where the fracture failure characteristics were not typical. This area was on the
port side of the lower fuselage in the forward cargo bay area. The basic structure of the
aircraft consisted of substantial vertical frames set 20’’ apart and horizontal stringers
about 10’’ apart, with the fuselage skin being attached to the outside. A small region of
the structure bounded approximately by frames 700 and 720 and stringers 38 left and
40 left, thus approximately 20’’ square, had been completely shattered. The fractures
around the shattered area were granular in character, whereas further away the frac-
tures were typical tearing fractures. Around the shattered area there were signs of
pitting and sooting. The skin panels in the area immediately surrounding the shattered
area had been bent and torn in a starburst pattern and were petalled outwards. From
the nature of this damage the conclusion was reached, and it is one which we accept,
that the cause of the damage was the detonation of an explosive device within the
fuselage, with the initial shattered area forming the focus for the subsequent petalling
mode of failure. Further processes led on from that which caused the total disruption
and disintegration of the aircraft.
[5] The port side forward cargo bay was loaded with luggage in containers. These
containers were approximately 5’ by 5’ by 5’, with an overhang of approximately 18’’
angled up from the base on the outboard side designed to make maximum use of the
curved space in the cargo hold. Most of the containers were made of aluminium apart
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E

from the after side which was open for loading and then covered by a plastic curtain. A
few of the containers were made of glass-reinforced ﬁbre. The containers were loaded
on to the aircraft through a door in the hold, and then slid on rollers into a pre-
arranged position where they were clamped. As part of the reconstruction process, the
recovered pieces of containers were reassembled, principally by Mr Claiden, an engin-
eering inspector with the AAIB. When this was done, it was ascertained that with two
exceptions there was no damage to containers other than was to be expected from the
disintegration of the aircraft and the containers’ fall to the ground. It was however
found that there was unusual damage to an aluminium container AVE 4041 and a ﬁbre
container AVN 7511. From the loading plan of the containers it was ascertained that
AVE 4041 was situated immediately inboard of and slightly above the shattered area of
the fuselage, and AVN 7511 was situated immediately aft of AVE 4041. The recon-
struction of AVE 4041 demonstrated severe damage to the ﬂoor panel and outboard
base frame member in the outboard aft quadrant, and also on the internal aspect of
that part of the container there were some areas of blackening and pitting. There was
also damage to the panels and frame members at the lower aft side of the overhang,
and again areas of blackening and pitting. The full details of the nature and extent of
the damage are to be found in the evidence of Mr Claiden, and are conﬁrmed in the
evidence of Dr Hayes and Mr Feraday, forensic scientists with the Royal Armaments
Research and Development Establishment (‘RARDE’). The nature of the damage
indicated a high-energy event, and the sooting and pitting indicated an explosion.
Mr Claiden, whose evidence was given in an impressively careful and restrained man-
ner, stated ‘I have no doubts in my mind that such an event occurred from within the
container’, the only occasion on which he stated an absolutely unqualiﬁed opinion.
Because of the distribution of the areas of sooting and pitting, and in particular the
absence of any such signs on the base of the container, it appeared to Mr Claiden that,
assuming that an explosive device was contained in a piece of luggage in the container,
the likelihood was that that piece of luggage was not lying on the ﬂoor of the container
but was lying probably on top of a case on the ﬂoor and projecting into the overhang
of the container. Ascertainment of the precise location of the explosive device was
assisted by consideration of the damage to the adjacent container AVN 7511. The
forward face of that container had a hole approximately 8’’ square about 10’’ up from
the top of the base radiating out from which were areas of sooting extending up to the
top of the container. This indicated that a relatively mild blast had exited AVE 4041
and impinged at an angle on the forward face of AVN 7511. Combining that informa-
tion with the damage to AVE 4041, the likely position of an explosive device was about
13’’ above the ﬂoor of AVE 4041. On that assumption allied to the previous assump-
tion that the piece of luggage containing the device was projecting into the overhang,
the position of the device would be approximately 25’’ from the skin of the fuselage.
We found the evidence of Mr Claiden wholly credible, reliable and compelling so far as
it went. He was not however an expert on explosives or the eﬀects of explosives. The
conclusion reached by Dr Hayes and Mr Feraday as to the position of the explosive
device coincided with that of Mr Claiden, and in addition Mr Feraday was present
at tests in the USA. These tests involved the use of luggage ﬁlled metal containers and
the placing of plastic explosives within Toshiba radio cassette players in a garment
ﬁlled suitcase. The tests conﬁrmed the opinion he expressed as to the position of the
explosive device and the quantity of explosive involved.

[6] Technical evidence relating to the eﬀects of explosives was given by Dr Cullis
and Professor Peel. Dr Cullis is an expert on the eﬀects of blast and the development
of computer codes to simulate the eﬀects of blast in particular diﬀerent situations, and
has been employed at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (‘DERA’) since
1978. Professor Peel is the chief scientist for DERA, specialising in materials and
structures used in aircraft, and leader of a team conducting research into inter alia the
assessment of the eﬀect of detonation of explosives in aircraft. They conﬁrmed that
the presence of pitting and carbon deposits which would look like a very ﬁne soot
indicated a chemical explosion. The areas in which this would occur would have to be
in line of sight with the explosive, and in particular, as far as pitting was concerned,
there would have to be no intervening structure of suﬃcient mass to prevent explosive
fragments impacting on the pitted area. The nature of the cracking in the ﬂoor panel
of the container is typical of the sort of deformation which would be seen from blast
loading, but the absence of pitting or sooting in that area would indicate that there
must have been something such as another suitcase situated between the explosive
device and the ﬂoor panel. On the other hand the pitting and sooting seen on the inner
aspect of the horizontal base frame member of the container combined with down-
ward deformation of that member conﬁrms the view that the explosive device was
situated above and in direct line of sight of that member and thus was likely to be
situated partly at least in the overhang where the presence of a suitcase on the ﬂoor of
the container would not inhibit the explosive products from striking that member.
Further conﬁrmation of the position of the explosive device came from the observa-
tion of crushing to the upper surface of the aircraft fuselage frame 700 and pitting and
sooting of the two neighbouring frames, this being the area adjacent to the lower after
end of the container. Professor Peel’s evidence also included a substantial complex
section on the nature of impulse loading, the critical level of impulse for failure of
aluminium alloy sheet of the type used for the fuselage skin, and the calculation of
both the stand-oﬀ distance and the size of the explosive charge from the size of the
shattered zone and the petalled zone. These calculations indicated a charge of about
450 grammes and a stand-oﬀ distance of 610 millimetres, which would take the explo-
sion 200 millimetres inside the container. We do not consider it necessary to go into
detail about these complex calculations, as the physical evidence of damage to the hull,
the container, and, as we shall see later, the contents of the container satisﬁes us
beyond any doubt that the explosion occurred within the container, and the calcula-
tions serve merely to conﬁrm that view. We should add that this section of his evidence
also dealt with the eﬀect, if any, of the concept of Mach stem formation, but we do not
consider it necessary to go into any detail about that, as we accept his evidence that
although that concept was considered as a means of assessing stand-oﬀ distance, it was
not actually used.
[7] In addition to the evidence of these experts who were all clear that the damage to
the aircraft was caused by an explosion, there was also evidence from Dr Douse, who
has specialised for many years in the trace analysis of drugs and explosives and in 1988
worked with RARDE. He pioneered the use of capillary gas chromatography, which is
now a well recognised procedure. He examined for the presence of explosive residues
two pieces of metal (labels 270.1 and 270.3) which had been identiﬁed as the two major
parts of the outboard base frame member of container AVE 4041. The procedures
involved, which were described in great detail in Dr Douse’s evidence, ended with
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E

traces on which peaks at particular points may indicate the presence of diﬀerent
types of explosives. These include diﬀerent variations of nitrotoluene, nitroglycerin,
PETN and RDX. There may also be other peaks which result from non-explosive
co-extractives. The traces relating to 270.1 and 270.3 indicated the presence of PETN
and RDX. These are chemicals used in the manufacture of plastic explosives, including
Semtex. In cross-examination it was suggested to him that a report by Professor Caddy
presented to Parliament in 1996 on the possible contamination of a centrifuge used at
RARDE vitiated his conclusions. However, while that report did indeed suggest that a
centrifuge was contaminated with RDX, it also made clear that certain examinations
carried out in the period which included December 1988 were not aﬀected, and in the
list of such examinations was included the examination of the Lockerbie debris carried
out by Dr Douse. It was further suggested to him that the traces disclosed peaks which
were consistent with the presence of TNT, DNT and nitroglycerin, but for the detailed
reasons which he gave in his evidence he was entirely satisﬁed that the peaks in ques-
tion related not to these forms of explosive but to non-explosive co-extractives. We see
no reason to doubt the conclusion to which this very experienced expert came. Finally
it was submitted that inadequate precautions were taken at the laboratory by way of
the use of control swabs of clothing and equipment to prevent the risk of distorted
results because of contamination. There was however a description both by Dr Douse
and Dr Hayes of the precautions taken to prevent contamination, and we are satisﬁed
that these precautions were adequate to prevent any risk that Dr Douse’s tests were
vitiated by any contamination.
[8] From this evidence we are entirely satisﬁed that the cause of the disaster was
the explosion of a device which was contained within the aircraft. We would also be
satisﬁed that the device was within container AVE 4041, but any possible doubts about
that would be dispelled by the evidence relating to the examination of the apparent
contents of that container, to which we now turn.
[9] During the course of the massive ground search, a large quantity of luggage and
clothing was collected and labelled. Within a few days of the disaster it was established
that an explosion had occurred, and accordingly the searchers were asked in particular
to recover any items which appeared to be scorched or blackened or otherwise had the
appearance of having been involved in an explosion. Any such items were then submit-
ted to the Forensic Explosives Laboratory at RARDE for detailed examination, the
principal forensic scientists involved being Dr Hayes and Mr Feraday. Fifty-six frag-
ments which showed various signs of explosives damage were identiﬁed as forming
part of what had been a brown hardshell Samsonite suitcase of the 26’’ Silhouette 4000
range (‘the primary suitcase’). The nature of the damage indicated that it had been
inﬂicted from within the suitcase. A further twenty-four items of luggage were identi-
ﬁed by their characteristic explosives damage as having been in relatively close proxim-
ity to the explosive device. Within many of these items there were found fragments
of what appeared to be parts of the primary suitcase, and also fragments of what
appeared to have been a radio cassette player. Other similar fragments were found in
clothing which from their charred appearance were considered to have been contained
in the primary suitcase. In addition, when examining a data plate which had been
attached to AVE 4041, Mr Claiden recovered a piece of debris which appeared to be a
small piece of circuit board. The number of fragments associated with the clothing in
close contact with the explosion and the extent of the shattering of these fragments
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

indicated that the explosive charge had in all probability been located within the radio.
It was known at that time that in October 1988 the West German police had recovered
a Toshiba radio cassette player which had been modiﬁed to form an improvised explo-
sive device. Mr Feraday visited West Germany to examine this device, and ascertained
that the fragments in his possession and in particular the piece of circuit board
recovered by Mr Claiden did not originate from the same model. However, he con-
sidered that there was a suﬃcient similarity to make it worth investigating other
models of Toshiba players. It was found that there were seven models in which the
printed circuit board bore precisely the same characteristics as the fragments. Sub-
sequently, when the blast damaged clothing was examined in detail there were found
embedded in two diﬀerent Slalom brand shirts, a Babygro, and a pair of tartan checked
trousers, fragments of paper which on examination proved to be from an owner’s
manual for a Toshiba RT-SF 16 BomBeat radio cassette player. All the other fragments
thought to have originated from the radio containing the explosive were consistent
with having come from an RT-SF 16. Other fragments of plastic associated with the
radio were found in other items of clothing considered to have been in the primary
suitcase, namely a white T-shirt, cream pyjamas, a herringbone jacket, and brown
herringbone trousers, as well as in the four items in which the fragments of paper were
found. The conclusion reached by the forensic scientists was that the nature of the
fragments and their distribution left no doubt that the explosive charge was contained
within the Toshiba radio, and we agree with that conclusion. Having regard to the
presence of fragments of an RT-SF 16 owner’s manual, we also accept that it was that
model of Toshiba radio that was involved.
[10] As we have noted, a substantial quantity of clothing was examined at RARDE.
The primary concern was to ascertain what clothing showed signs of explosion damage,
and then, if possible, to diﬀerentiate between clothing likely to have been contained
within the suitcase that contained the explosive device and clothing in adjacent suit-
cases. The method adopted by the forensic scientists was to treat as a high probability
that any explosion damaged clothing which contained fragments of the radio cassette
player, the instruction manual, and the brown fabric-lined cardboard partition from
within the suitcase to the exclusion of fragments of the outer shell, was within the
primary suitcase. Where clothing carried neither fragments of the explosive device
nor of one or more of the suitcase shells that would have surrounded it, or where it
variously carried fragments of the suitcase shells with or without fragments of the
explosive device, its speciﬁc location was problematic, although the possibility that it
was contained in the primary suitcase could not be discounted. There were twelve
items of clothing and an umbrella of which fragments were recovered and examined
which fell within the ﬁrst category and accordingly in their opinion had been contained
within the primary suitcase. These items were:—
1.
A charred fragment of white cotton material which from the details of the stitching
and method of assembly appeared most likely to have originated from a white
T-shirt of Abanderado brand. Contained within this fragment there were found a
piece of loudspeaker mesh and eleven plastic fragments which could have come
from a Toshiba radio, and some blue/white fragments consistent with having come
from a Babygro (see item 5).
2.
Explosion damaged fragments of brown tartan patterned material two of which
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
919
 

still retained parts of labels which identiﬁed them as having formed part of a pair
of Yorkie brand trousers size 34. Contained within one of these fragments there
were found fragments of the lining and internal divider of the primary suitcase,
ﬁve black plastic fragments which could have come from a Toshiba radio, four
fragments of an RT-SF 16 owner’s manual, and ﬁve clumps of blue/white ﬁbres
consistent with having come from a Babygro.
3.
Four charred and disrupted fragments of grey cloth which in terms of colour,
weave and texture appeared to have a common origin. One of these fragments had
sewn on to it a ‘Slalom’ label, and all the fragments were consistent with having
come from a grey Slalom brand shirt. Contained within one of these fragments
(bearing the police label PI/995) there were found a number of items. We shall
return to this fragment later, as the defence contended that there were a number of
factors surrounding its ﬁnding and examination which aﬀected the reliability of the
evidence relating to it.
4.
Six charred fragments of white material with a ﬁne blue pin-stripe. Although there
were no identifying marks on any of these fragments, their colour, weave, texture
and construction indicated that their origin was from a shirt closely similar to a
Slalom brand shirt. Contained within these fragments there were found sixteen
fragments of black plastic and four fragments of loudspeaker mesh which could
have come from a Toshiba radio and fragments of an RT-SF 16 owner’s manual.
5.
Four explosion-damaged fragments of light brown herringbone woven cloth.
Although there were no identifying marks on any of these fragments, their colour,
weave, texture and construction indicated that their origin was from a pair of
Yorkie brand trousers. Six pieces of black plastic and a fragment of the divider
of the primary suitcase were found contained therein.
6.
Three explosion-damaged fragments of herringbone patterned brown tweed cloth.
Although there were no identifying marks on any of these fragments, their colour,
weave, texture and construction indicated that their origin was from a tweed jacket
similar in all respects to a control sample obtained by police oﬃcers. These
fragments contained fragments of black plastic and suitcase divider.
7.
Four fragments of cream coloured material with a pattern of brown stripes. One of
these was a substantial item clearly identiﬁable as the remains of a pair of pyjama
trousers. Although there were no identifying marks on any of these fragments, their
colour, pattern and construction indicated that their origin was from a pair of
Panwear brand pyjamas. They contained fragments of black plastic and fragments
of lining from the primary suitcase.
8.
Thirteen very severely damaged fragments, many extremely small, of blue ﬁbrous
material. One fragment consisted of two overlaid pieces of material, one being a
blue ﬁbrous material and the other being knitted white ribbed material. Between
these two pieces there was trapped the remains of a label printed in diﬀerent
colours containing information about age, height, composition and ‘made in
Malta’. This composite fragment matched closely in all signiﬁcant respects the
labelled neck section of a Babygro Primark brand. The material of the other
fragments also matched the material of the same brand.
Adhering to these various fragments were fragments of black plastic, wire, paper
fragments from the Toshiba owner’s manual, and fragments of the divider of the
primary suitcase.

9. Three fragments of a black nylon umbrella. The major fragments comprised part
of the canopy, ribbing and handle stem, shredded and partly collapsed indicating
close involvement with an explosion. Strongly adherent to the canopy material
were blue and white ﬁbres, similar in appearance to the Babygro ﬁbres. A second
fragment was a piece of silver coated black plastic with ﬂuted surface corrugations
similar to part of the locking collar of the umbrella, and this was found in a
fragment of the tartan checked trousers (item 2 above).
10. A fragment of an explosion damaged knitted brown woollen cardigan. This item
had sewn on to it a label inscribed ‘Puccini design’.
The remaining three items had clearly been very closely involved with the explosion,
but there was insuﬃcient material to enable identiﬁcation to be made of their origin.
[11] The nature and extent of the damage to this clothing together with the items
embedded therein conﬁrmed, if conﬁrmation were necessary, that the explosion had
occurred within container AVE 4041, and also established beyond doubt that the
explosive device was contained within a Toshiba RT-SF 16 radio cassette player which
had been within a brown Samsonite suitcase which also contained the items of clothing
enumerated above.
[12] It will be recalled that four of the items identiﬁed as having been in the primary
suitcase were identiﬁable by labels as having been of Yorkie, Slalom, Primark and
Puccini brands. In August 1989 police oﬃcers visited Malta in an attempt to trace the
source of these items. After a visit to Yorkie Clothing, on 1 September they went to
Mary’s House, Tower Road, Sliema. This was a shop run by the Gauci family, Tony
Gauci being one of the partners. Mr Gauci’s evidence was that he was visited by police
oﬃcers in September 1989. He was able to tell them that he recalled a particular sale
about a fortnight before Christmas 1988, although he could not remember the exact
date. His recollection was that the Christmas lights were just being put up. It was
midweek, possibly Wednesday. The time was about 6.30pm. The purchaser was a man,
and the witness recognised him as being a Libyan. The conversation with the purchaser
was probably in a mixture of Arabic, English and Maltese. Many Libyans visit his
shop, and when he hears them speaking he can tell the diﬀerence between a Libyan
and, say, a Tunisian or an Egyptian. He bought an assortment of clothing, but it did
not appear to the witness that the nature of what he was buying was of importance.
Amongst the items which the witness remembered selling were two pairs of Yorkie
trousers, two pairs of striped pyjamas of the same brand as the Panwear fragment, a
tweed jacket, a blue Babygro, two Slalom shirts collar size 16½, two cardigans, one
brown and one blue, and an umbrella. The order number seen on the fragment of one
of the pairs of Yorkie trousers was 1705, and the delivery note for this order showed
that it was delivered on 18 November 1988. The police obtained either from Mr Gauci
or from the manufacturers samples of all of these items, and these were the samples
which were used by the forensic scientists when comparing them with the fragments. It
may seem surprising that he was able to remember this particular sale in such detail
some nine months afterwards, but he explained that the purchaser appeared to be
taking little interest in the items he was buying. We are satisﬁed, however, that his
recollection of these items is accurate. While it was never suggested to him that his
recollection might have been assisted by the police oﬃcers, it is perhaps a measure
of his accuracy that he was clear that the purchases did not include an Abanderado
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
921
 

T-shirt, even though he did stock such items and it would be one in which the police
were interested. While no doubt individual items could have been purchased in many
other shops in Malta, or indeed in other parts of the world as many of them were
exported, the exact match between so many of the items and the fragments found at
Lockerbie is in our view far more than just a coincidence. We are therefore entirely
satisﬁed that the items of clothing in the primary suitcase were those described by
Mr Gauci as having been purchased in Mary’s House. We shall return to Mr Gauci’s
evidence in more detail in connection with the date of the sale and the identiﬁcation of
the purchaser.
[13] We now turn to another crucial item that was found during the search of the
debris. On 13 January 1989 DC Gilchrist and DC McColm were engaged together in
line searches in an area near Newcastleton. A piece of charred material was found by
them which was given the police number PI/995 and which subsequently became label
168. The original inscription on the label, which we are satisﬁed was written by DC
Gilchrist, was ‘Cloth (charred)’. The word ‘cloth’ has been overwritten by the word
‘debris’. There was no satisfactory explanation as to why this was done, and DC
Gilchrist’s attempts to explain it were at worst evasive and at best confusing. We are,
however, satisﬁed that this item was indeed found in the area described, and DC
McColm who corroborated DC Gilchrist on the ﬁnding of the item was not cross-
examined about the detail of the ﬁnding of this item. This item was logged into the
property store at Dextar on 17 January 1989. It was suggested by the defence that there
was some sinister connotation both in the alteration of the original label and in the
delay between the ﬁnding of the item and its being logged in to Dextar. As we have
indicated, there does not appear to be any particular reason for the alteration of the
label, but we are satisﬁed that there was no sinister reason for it and that it was not
tampered with by the ﬁnders. As far as the late logging is concerned, at that period
there was a vast amount of debris being recovered, and the log shows that many other
items were only logged in some days after they had been picked up. Again therefore we
see no sinister connotation in this. Because it was a piece of charred material, it was
sent for forensic examination. According to his notes, this item was examined, initially
on 12 May 1989, by Dr Hayes. His notes show that it was found to be part of the
neckband of a grey shirt, and when the control sample was obtained it appeared simi-
lar in all respects to the neckband of a Slalom shirt. It was severely explosion damaged
with localised penetration holes and blackening consistent with explosive involvement.
Embedded within some of the penetration holes there were found nine fragments of
black plastic, a small fragment of metal, a small fragment of wire, and a multi-layered
fragment of white paper (subsequently ascertained to be fragments from a Toshiba
RT-SF 16 and its manual). There was also found embedded a fragment of green col-
oured circuit board. The next reference to that last fragment occurs in a memorandum
sent by Mr Feraday to CI Williamson on 15 September 1989 enclosing a Polaroid
photograph of it and asking for assistance in trying to identify it. Again the defence
sought to cast doubt on the provenance of this fragment of circuit board, for three
reasons. In the ﬁrst place, Dr Hayes’ note of his examination was numbered as page 51.
The subsequent pages had originally been numbered 51 to 55, but these numbers had
been overwritten to read 52 to 56. The suggestion was put to Dr Hayes that the original
pages 51 to 55 had been renumbered, the original page 56 had been removed, and that
thus space was made for the insertion of a new page 51. Dr Hayes’ explanation was
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
922
 
www.ebook3000.com

that originally his notes had not been paginated at all. When he came to prepare his
report based on his original notes, he put his notes into more or less chronological
order and added page numbers at the top. He assumed that he had inadvertently num-
bered two consecutive pages as page 51, and after numbering a few more pages had
noticed his error and had overwritten with the correct numbers. Pagination was of
no materiality, because each item that was examined had the date of examination
incorporated into the notes. The second reason for doubt was said to be that in most
cases when a fragment of something like a circuit board was found in a piece of
clothing, Dr Hayes’ practice was to make a drawing of that fragment and give it a
separate reference number. There was no drawing of this fragment on page 51, and the
designation of the fragment as PT/35(b) was not done until a later date. Finally it was
said that it was inexplicable that if this fragment had been found in May 1989 and
presumably photographed at the time, his colleague Mr Feraday should be sending a
memorandum in September 1989 enclosing a Polaroid photograph as being ‘the best
I can do in such a short time’. Dr Hayes could not explain this, and suggested that the
person to ask about it would be the author of the memorandum, Mr Feraday, but this
was not done. While it is unfortunate that this particular item which turned out to be
of major signiﬁcance to this enquiry despite its miniscule size may not initially have
been given the same meticulous treatment as most other items, we are nevertheless
satisﬁed that the fragment was extracted by Dr Hayes in May l989 from the remnant of
the Slalom shirt found by DC Gilchrist and DC McColm.
[14] Over the ensuing months extensive investigations were carried out by CI
Williamson and other police oﬃcers within the printed circuit board industry in an
attempt to trace the origin of the fragment, but these were fruitless. In about June 1990
CI Williamson received information from an FBI oﬃcer named Thurman as a result of
which he and Mr Feraday visited FBI headquarters in Washington. They were there
shown a timing device known as an MST–13 (label 420). On examination it was found
that there was an area on a printed circuit board within that timer which was identi-
cal to the recovered fragment except that the Washington device had double-sided
solder masking whereas the fragment PT/35(b) was solder masked on one side only.
Subsequent enquiries led to a commission rogatoire being obtained, which enabled
judicial and police authorities in Switzerland to carry out enquiries on behalf of the
Scottish police. In November 1990 and January 1991 there were judicial interviews of
two persons, Edwin Bollier and Erwin Meister, the partners in the ﬁrm of MEBO, a
ﬁrm which was engaged in the design and manufacture of various electronic items.
There was a further interview with Scottish police oﬃcers in May 1991. During the
course of these interviews, a number of items were handed over including a quantity
of documentation, three timers (two MST–13s and an Olympus), and various com-
ponents of timers including circuit boards. The detailed examination of these items by
Dr Hayes and Mr Feraday and comparison with the fragment of green circuit board
left them in no doubt that the fragment originated from an area of the connection pad
for an output relay of a circuit board of single solder-mask type of an MST–13 timer.
We accept the conclusion to which the forensic scientists came.
[15] The evidence which we have considered up to this stage satisﬁes us beyond
reasonable doubt that the cause of the disaster was the explosion of an improvised
explosive device, that that device was contained within a Toshiba radio cassette player
in a brown Samsonite suitcase along with various items of clothing, that that clothing
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
923
 

had been purchased in Mary’s House, Sliema, Malta, and that the initiation of the
explosion was triggered by the use of an MST–13 timer.
[16] We now turn to consider the evidence relating to the provenance of the primary
suitcase and the possible ways in which it could have found its way into AVE 4041. This
involves consideration of the procedures at various airports through which it may have
passed.
[17] The Crown case is that the primary suitcase was carried on an Air Malta ﬂight
KM180 from Luqa Airport in Malta to Frankfurt, that at Frankfurt it was transferred to
PanAm ﬂight PA103A, a feeder ﬂight for PA103, which carried it to London Heathrow
Airport, and that there, in turn, it was transferred to PA103. This case is largely
dependent on oral and documentary evidence relating to the three airports. From this
evidence, it is alleged, an inference can be drawn that an unidentiﬁed and unaccompan-
ied item of baggage was carried on KM180 and transferred to PA103A at Frankfurt
and PA103 at Heathrow.
[18] When an intending passenger checks in baggage for carriage in an aircraft hold,
a numbered tag is attached to each item. Part of the tag is removed and given to the
passenger to act as a receipt. The portion attached to the item of baggage bears,
ordinarily, the name of the airline, or the ﬁrst airline, on which the passenger is to
travel and the destination. Where the journey is to be completed in more than one leg
or stage, the tag also carries the name of any intermediate airport. The purpose of the
tag is to enable the baggage handlers at the airport of departure, at any intermediate
airport and at the destination to deliver or transfer the item to the correct ﬂight and
return it to the passenger at the ﬁnal destination. In 1988, tags preprinted with the
name of the destination airport were sometimes used when the journey was to be
completed in one stage. Where there was more than one stage, the names of the destin-
ation and of any intermediate airport were normally written on the tag by hand at the
time of check-in. Baggage checked in at the airport of departure is referred to as local
origin baggage. Baggage which has to be handled at an intermediate airport is gener-
ally referred to as transit baggage. A distinction is normally made between two groups
of transit baggage. Online baggage is baggage which arrives at and departs from an
intermediate airport on aircraft of the same carrier: interline baggage arrives on an
aircraft of one carrier and departs with a diﬀerent carrier. The terminology is, however,
not always used consistently. Baggage is intended to be carried on the same aircraft as
the passenger to whom it belongs, but from time to time baggage is misdirected or
delayed and has to be carried on a diﬀerent ﬂight. Such items are identiﬁed by an
additional special tag, known as a rush tag, and are normally only sent in response to a
request from the destination airport, following a claim made by a passenger for bag-
gage which has not been delivered at the destination. The evidence led on this point
related only to practice at Luqa airport, but seemed to reﬂect international practice. A
passenger aircraft may also carry items of mail and other freight.
[19] In 1988, and for some time before, airline operators and airport authorities
generally were well aware of the risk that attempts might be made to place explosive
devices on passenger aircraft and had in place systems intended to minimise that risk.
In particular, it was normal to take steps to prevent items of baggage travelling on an
aircraft unaccompanied by the passenger who had checked them in, unless there was
suﬃcient reason to regard the items as safe. It was normal to put certain questions to
passengers who checked in baggage for a ﬂight and to ensure that every passenger who
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

had checked in baggage at the departure airport had boarded the aircraft, or that
safety was otherwise assured, before it was allowed to depart. Similarly, steps were
taken to check that transit baggage did not travel without the accompanying passenger.
These steps varied between diﬀerent airports and diﬀerent carriers. By 1988, PanAm
had brought into operation a system of x-raying interline baggage at Frankfurt and
Heathrow. The availability of that facility led to changes in the way in which interline
passengers and baggage were handled.
[20] PA103 took oﬀ from Heathrow shortly before 1830 on 21 December 1988. It
was the last transatlantic PanAm ﬂight to depart on that day. Heathrow was therefore
the last place at which an explosive device could have been introduced into the hold of
the aircraft. Before its departure, the aircraft was parked at stand K14. It had previ-
ously been checked and an airworthiness sheet had been completed for it. PA103A
arrived at stand K16 and passengers proceeding to New York were instructed to go
direct to gate 14. The boarding of passengers, both those originating at Heathrow and
those transferring from PA103A, proceeded normally except that one passenger who
had checked in two items of baggage at Heathrow failed to appear at the gate. The
passenger was an American citizen and a decision was taken that the aircraft could
depart despite his non-appearance. It was later found that he had been drinking in a
bar at the airport and missed the boarding call. There is no reason to connect that
passenger or the items checked in by him with the explosive device.
[21] At Heathrow, as at Frankfurt, PanAm baggage was handled by employees of
PanAm. Security duties for PanAm were carried out by employees of Alert Security,
an aﬃliate company of PanAm. Baggage checked in at Heathrow was sent to an area
known as the baggage build-up area before being taken to the aircraft when it was
ready for loading. The build-up area was adjacent to a roadway extensively used by
persons within the airport. In December 1988 it was busier than usual because con-
struction work was in progress at the airport. If, as was the case with a Boeing 747
aircraft, the baggage, or any of it, was to be loaded into containers to be placed in the
aircraft, that was done in the build-up area. Interline baggage arriving at Heathrow was
unloaded by airport employees and was sent to an area called the interline shed. This
shed was a separate building within the airport terminal area. Baggage removed from
incoming ﬂights was brought to the outside of the shed by employees of a company
called Whyte’s, employed by the airport authority, and placed on a conveyor belt,
which carried it into the shed. There was no security guard outside the shed, so that the
placing of items on the conveyor belt was unsupervised. The interline shed dealt with
baggage for other airlines, as well as baggage for PanAm. Within the shed, interline
baggage for a PanAm ﬂight was identiﬁed and separated from other airline baggage.
It was taken to the PanAm x-ray machine, where it was examined by x-ray by an
employee of Alert. After x-ray, it was placed in a container or set aside to await the
outgoing ﬂight.
[22] On 21 December 1988 the x-ray operator was Sulkash Kamboj. John Bedford, a
loader-driver employed by PanAm, and Mr Parmar, another PanAm employee were
working in the interline shed. Mr Bedford set aside container AVE 4041 to receive
interline baggage for PA103. The container was identiﬁed as the container for PA103
by Mr Bedford who wrote the information on a sheet which was placed in a holder ﬁxed
to the container. A number of items were placed in that container. Later Mr Bedford
drove the container to a position near the baggage build-up area and left it there. From
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
925
 

there, the container was taken out to stand K16, and baggage for New York unloaded
from PA103A was loaded into it. The incoming plane carried baggage loose in its hold,
not in containers. The evidence of Mr Bedford together with that of Peter Walker, a
supervisor in the baggage build-up area, and Darshan Sandhu, a chief loader, and with
the container build-up sheet (production 1217), shows that container AVE 4041 con-
tained both interline baggage which had been placed in it in the interline shed, and
baggage unloaded from PA103A. When it was full, container AVE 4041 was driven
directly to stand 14 and loaded into the hold. The evidence of Terence Crabtree,
another driver-loader employed by PanAm, who was the crew chief for the loading of
PA103, together with the load plan (production 1183), shows that the container was
loaded in position 14 left, which corresponds to the position established by the forensic
evidence. The plan also shows that container AVN 7511 was loaded in the adjacent
position 21 left, again corresponding to the forensic evidence. There was also some
baggage from PA103A which was loaded loose into the hold of PA103.
[23] Mr Bedford said that he recalled that on 21 December 1988 he had set aside
container AVE 4041 for baggage for PA103. He recalled also that he had placed a
number of suitcases in the container. These cases were placed on their spines in a row
along the back of the container. He said that he had left the interline shed to have a
cup of tea with Mr Walker in the build-up area. On his return, he saw that two cases
had been added to the container. These cases were laid on their sides, with the handles
towards the interior of the container, in the way that he would normally have loaded
them. The arrangement of these cases was shown in a set of photographs (production
1114) taken in early January 1989 in Mr Bedford’s presence. Mr Bedford said that he
had been told by Mr Kamboj that he had placed the additional two suitcases in the
container during his absence. Mr Kamboj denied that he had placed any suitcases in
the container and denied also that he had told Mr Bedford that he had done so. Both
witnesses were referred to a number of police statements which they gave at various times
and to their evidence at the Fatal Accident Inquiry into the disaster, and it appears that
each of the witnesses has consistently given the same account throughout. Mr Kamboj
eventually conceded in evidence, in a half-hearted way, that what Mr Bedford said
might be correct, but the contradiction is not resolved. Mr Bedford was a clear and
impressive witness and he had no reason to invent what he said. Mr Kamboj was a less
impressive witness, and he might have been anxious to avoid any possible responsibil-
ity. In our view, the evidence of Mr Bedford should be preferred on this point. The
diﬀerence between the witnesses is not, however, material since for the purposes of this
case what is important is that there is evidence that when the container left the interline
area it had in it the two suitcases positioned as described above. Mr Bedford agreed
that in statements to police oﬃcers and in evidence at the Fatal Accident Inquiry he
had described one of the two cases lying on their sides as a brown or maroony-brown
hardshell Samsonitetype case. He could not recollect that when he gave evidence in
this case, but said that he had told the truth in his statements and earlier evidence.
Mr Bedford also said that he had arranged with Mr Walker that because the incoming
ﬂight PA103A was a little delayed, and to wait for it would take him beyond his normal
ﬁnishing time, he should take the container to the baggage build-up area and leave it
there, and that he did so before leaving work soon after 5.00pm. Mr Walker could not
recall what had happened, but accepted that he had told investigating police oﬃcers
soon after the event that he recalled seeing Mr Bedford at about 5.00pm and that
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

Mr Bedford had said that he was going home, but that there was no conversation about
leaving a container at the build-up area. Mr Walker’s evidence at the FAI in regard to
whether or not he was aware of a container being brought to the build-up area diﬀered
from his original police statement and he was unable to explain the diﬀerence. There is,
however, no reason to doubt Mr Bedford’s evidence that he did take AVE 4041 to the
build-up area and leave it there.
[24] It emerges from the evidence therefore that a suitcase which could ﬁt the foren-
sic description of the primary suitcase was in the container when it left the interline
shed. There is also a possibility that an extraneous suitcase could have been introduced
by being put onto the conveyor belt outside the interline shed, or introduced into the
shed itself or into the container when it was at the build-up area. To achieve that, the
person placing the suitcase would have had to avoid being detected, but the evidence
indicates that a person in possession of a pass for the airside area would not be likely
to be challenged, and there were a very large number of passes issued for Heathrow, a
substantial number of which were not accounted for. The person placing the suitcase
would also have required to know where to put it to achieve the objective.
[25] It was argued on behalf of the accused that the suitcase described by Mr Bedford
could well have been the primary suitcase, particularly as the evidence did not disclose
that any fragments of a hard-shell Samsonite-type suitcase had been recovered, apart
from those of the primary suitcase itself. It was accepted, for the purposes of this
argument, that the eﬀect of forensic evidence was that the suitcase could not have been
directly in contact with the ﬂoor of the container. It was submitted that there was
evidence that an American Tourister suitcase, which had travelled from Frankfurt,
fragments of which had been recovered, had been very intimately involved in the
explosion and could have been placed under the suitcase spoken to by Mr Bedford.
That would have required rearrangement of the items in the container, but such
rearrangement could easily have occurred when the baggage from Frankfurt was being
put into the container on the tarmac at Heathrow. It is true that such a rearrangement
could have occurred, but if there was such a rearrangement, the suitcase described by
Mr Bedford might have been placed at some more remote corner of the container, and
while the forensic evidence dealt with all the items recovered which showed direct
explosive damage, twenty-ﬁve in total, there were many other items of baggage found
which were not dealt with in detail in the evidence in the case.
[26] At Frankfurt Airport, baggage for most airlines was handled by the airport
authority, but PanAm had their own security and baggage handling staﬀ. Frankfurt
had a computer controlled automated baggage handling system, through which bag-
gage was passed. Each item of baggage was placed in an individually numbered tray as
it was taken into the system. The trays were placed on conveyor belts and instructions
were fed into the computer to identify the ﬂight to which the baggage was to be sent,
the position from which the aircraft was to leave and the time of the ﬂight. The trays
were dispatched to a waiting area where they circulated until an instruction was fed in
to summon the baggage for a particular ﬂight, whereupon the items would be auto-
matically extracted from the waiting area and sent to the departure point. Local origin
baggage was received at check-in desks. There was no detailed evidence as to how the
check-in staﬀ dealt with it, but such baggage was passed into the system. Transit
baggage was taken to one of two areas, identiﬁed as V3 and HM respectively, where it
was fed into the system at points known as coding stations. All baggage at the airport
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
927
 

went through the automated system, with the exception of transit baggage when there
was less than 45 minutes interval between ﬂights. In that case, baggage might be taken
from one aircraft to another without going through the system.
[27] There were seven coding stations in V3. One such station is shown in photographs
in production 1053. The general practice was that baggage from an incoming ﬂight was
brought either to HM or to V3 in wagons or containers. On arrival, the baggage from a
ﬂight would be directed by an employee called the interline writer to one or more of
the coding stations. The proper practice was that each coding station should not deal
with baggage from more than one incoming ﬂight at a time. Normally there were two
employees at each coding station. One would lift the items of baggage from the wagon
or container and place each item in a tray. The other would enter into the computer, in
a coded form, the ﬂight number and destination for the outgoing ﬂight, taking the
information from the tag attached to the item. There was evidence that from time to
time there might be an additional employee at a coding station, who would assist in
removing the baggage and placing it in trays, and that the details from the tag might be
read out to the coder by the person putting the item into a tray. Rush tag items were
dealt with in the same way as other items. Items which arrived at a coding station
without a legible tag were sent to an error area to be dealt with there. Records were
kept identifying the staﬀ working at particular stations, the arrival times of aircraft,
the arrival times of consignments of baggage at HM or V3, and the station or stations
to which the baggage from a particular ﬂight was sent. The computer itself retained a
record of the items sent through the system so that it was possible, for a limited period,
to identify all the items of baggage sent through the system to a particular ﬂight. After
some time, however, that information would be lost from the system. The baggage
control system contained its own clock, and there was a tendency for the time recorded
by that clock to diverge from real time. The baggage control clock was therefore reset
at the start of each day, by reference either to the main computer clock or to the
employee’s watch. The divergence was progressive and by 4.00pm or 5.00pm the dis-
crepancy might be as much as two or three minutes. Times entered in other records
were obtained by the staﬀ from the airport clock or from their own watches.
[28] PanAm had x-ray equipment at Frankfurt, which was used to x-ray interline
baggage. The system was that baggage arriving at the departure gate for a PanAm
ﬂight would be separated into categories, according to the ﬂight programme. In the
case of PA103A, that meant that the loaders would separate baggage for London,
baggage for New York, and interline baggage. The last category would be taken to the
x-ray equipment and examined and returned to be loaded. The practice of PanAm at
Frankfurt was to carry out a reconciliation between local origin passengers and bag-
gage and online passengers and baggage, to ensure that every such passenger who had
baggage on the ﬂight was accounted for, but there was no attempt to reconcile interline
passengers and their baggage. Reconciliation of interline passengers would have been
diﬃcult because the staﬀ at the gate would not have any knowledge of an interline
passenger until the passenger appeared to check in at the gate and receive a boarding
card there. There was evidence from two witnesses, Roland O’Neill, the load master for
PA103A, and Monika Diegmuller, a check-in supervisor, that there was a reconcili-
ation of interline passengers and baggage, but there was overwhelming evidence to the
contrary and their evidence on this point is not acceptable. The evidence that there was
no reconciliation came from Herbert Leuniger, PanAm’s director at Frankfurt, and

Wolf Krommes, a duty station manager with PanAm. Further, in March 1988, Alan
Berwick, the head of security for a wide area including the Middle East, after discussion
with Martin Huebner, the security oﬃcer for PA at Frankfurt, sent a memorandum
(production 1170) to Mr Sonesen, the company oﬃcer in New York to whom he
reported, requesting a corporate decision on the question whether, in view of the exist-
ence of the x-ray facility, there should be any reconciliation. The reply (production
1171) emphatically instructed that if baggage had been x-rayed, the aircraft should
leave, even if the interline passenger to whom it belonged had not boarded, and that
there should be no reconciliation. In early 1989, Mr O’Neill gave a statement to two
FAA investigators in terms which implied that there was normally no reconciliation.
[29] The evidence of Joachim Koscha, who was one of the managers of the baggage
system at Frankfurt in 1988, taken with production 1068, shows that ﬂight KM180
reached its parking position at 1248 on 21 December 1988. Since it was not a PanAm
ﬂight it was unloaded by employees of the airport authority. According to the record,
it was unloading between 1248 and 1300. Andreas Schreiner was in charge of monitor-
ing the arrival of baggage at V3 on 21 December 1988. He made the following record
on a document called the interline writer’s sheet (production 1092):—
Flug
no.
Pos. ONB Ank. DW/V
w-Nr.
Anzahl Wag. Direkt
Pos.
Von
V3
KM180 141 1248 1301 146 1
That bears to record one wagon of baggage from KM180, in position at 1248, arriving
at V3 at 1301. Mr Schreiner’s evidence was that coding would generally begin three to
ﬁve minutes after the arrival of the baggage at V3. Mr Schreiner also said that luggage
was always delivered from one ﬂight only. Mr Schreiner and Mr Koscha further identi-
ﬁed production 1061 as a work sheet completed by a coder to record baggage with
which he dealt. The name of the coder in question was Koca, who was not called as a
witness. The relevant part of production 1061 is as follows:—
Intestell Flug Nr. Kodierzeit
Beginn Ende
Cont. Nr. Wag. Kodierer
Name
206 KM180 1304 1310—1 Koca
That record bears to show that one wagon of baggage from KM180 was coded at
station 206 in V3 between 1304 and 1310. It was suggested that the ﬁgure for the
completion of coding might be 1316, but Mr Schreiner preferred the reading 1310,
which is more consistent with what can be seen on the document. There is also docu-
mentary evidence (production 1062) that the aircraft used for PA103A arrived from
Vienna (as ﬂight PA124) and was placed at position 44, from which it left for London
at 1653.

[30] Mrs Bogomira Erac, a computer programmer employed at the airport, was
on duty on 21 December 1988. She heard of the loss of PA103 during the evening of
that day and realised that PA103A had departed during her period on duty. She was
interested in the amount of baggage on the Frankfurt ﬂight, and on the following
morning she decided to take a printout of the information as to baggage held on the
computer in case it should contain any useful information. She did not at once identify
any such information, but retained the printout, which later was given to investigators.
The printout is production 1060, and includes the following entry:—
Container no. Flight no. Counter no. Time leave store Time at gate
B8849 F1042 S0009+Z1307 TO HS33+Z1517 B044+Z1523
The document itself contains no column headings, and those set out above are derived
from the evidence showing how the printout is to be interpreted, by reference to the
codes in operation at the time. The document therefore bears to record that an item
coded at station 206 at 1307 was transferred and delivered to the appropriate gate to be
loaded on board PA103A.
[31] The documentary evidence as a whole therefore clearly gives rise to the infer-
ence that an item which came in on KM180 was transferred to and left on PA103A.
Evidence led in connection with KM180 established that there was no passenger who
had an onward booking from Frankfurt to London or the United States and that all
the passengers on KM180 retrieved all their checked-in baggage at their destinations.
The Malta documentation for KM180 does not record that any unaccompanied bag-
gage was carried. Defence counsel submitted that there was no evidence that baggage
sent to the gate was actually loaded onto the ﬂight, nor was there any count of the
number of bags loaded. There was however evidence from Mr Kasteleiner that it could
be taken from the documents that no baggage was left at the gate and it can be inferred
that all items sent there were loaded. It follows that there is a plain inference from the
documentary record that an unidentiﬁed and unaccompanied bag travelled on KM180
from Luqa airport to Frankfurt and there was loaded on PA103A.
[32] Defence counsel submitted that for a number of reasons that inference could
not, or not safely, be drawn. In the ﬁrst place, it was submitted that there was room for
error because the computer time could diverge from real time and because the times
entered by the operators could be inaccurate, either because the clock or watch relied
on was inaccurate or because the entries were not correctly made. It was further sug-
gested that recording of the place from which an item had come would have been of
less importance to the operators than ensuring that it went to the right ﬂight, and that
the operators would have an interest to suggest that they had been fully occupied while
the accuracy of the records was not a matter of material importance to them. It was
also pointed out that the person who made the critical entry in production 1061 had
not been called to give evidence, although his name was on the Crown witness list, and
that there was no explanation for his absence. We accept that the possibilities of error
exist, but the computer clock was reset at the start of each day (although the precise
time at which it was reset was not stated) and there was an interest in accurate time-
keeping since one of the purposes of keeping records was to be able to trace baggage
consignments through the system. The records were records regularly kept for the
purposes of the airport business, and can be accepted in the absence of some reason to
doubt their accuracy. It was also argued that a very minor discrepancy in the time
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
930
 
www.ebook3000.com

recording could mean that the inference which the Crown sought to draw would be
erroneous, particularly since there might be errors the eﬀect of which was cumulative.
Again this is true, but the suspect case was recorded as being coded in the middle of
the time attributed to baggage from KM180, so that the possible signiﬁcance of such
errors is reduced.
[33] A further point made by the defence was that the records themselves displayed
errors which demonstrated that they could not be relied on. Counsel for the defence
referred to two particular matters. The ﬁrst concerned entries relating to interline bag-
gage which arrived at V3 between 1221 and 1237 on 21 December 1988. It is recorded
that four wagons of baggage came from LH669, a Lufthansa ﬂight from Damascus.
The worksheets in production 1061 record that one and a half wagons from that ﬂight
were coded at station 202 between 1258 and 1307 and one wagon was coded at station
207 between 1303 and 1309. There is no other record of coding of baggage from that
ﬂight, so that on the face of the records one and a half wagons are not accounted for.
In view of the timing, it was submitted, it was possible that baggage from LH669 was
being dealt with at the same time as baggage from KM180 and that the suspect bag
might have come from the Damascus ﬂight. The witness Joachim Koscha, however,
referred to notes in the records which indicated that wagons of luggage from that ﬂight
had been taken to Customs, as happened from time to time, and gave evidence that
wagons taken to Customs might be reloaded in diﬀerent ways, which might account for
the discrepancy. Reference was also made to a number of other instances in which the
records showed small discrepancies in the commencing and ﬁnishing times entered for
coding particular consignments, which on their face seem to show that baggage from
more than one ﬂight might have been coded at the same station at the same time.
Reference was also made to another item in production 1060. In this instance, the entry
is as follows:—
Container no. Flight no. Counter no. Time leave store Time at gate
B5620 F1042 S0074+Z1544 HV20+Z1546 BO44+Z1549
When interpreted in the same manner as the entry previously referred to, this bears to
show that an item coded at a station in HM at 1544 on 21 December also was sent to
PA103A, and reference to the coders’ records bears to show that baggage from ﬂight
LH1071 from Warsaw was being encoded at that station at that time. It was agreed that
no passenger from that ﬂight transferred to PA103A, so that the records seem to show
the presence of another unaccompanied bag on that ﬂight. In addition it was suggested
that the records and other evidence showed, or might show, that additional items of
baggage were carried on PA103A, besides those listed on production 1060. The total
number of items listed on production 1060 is 111 but production 199, which is a
printout of the passenger manifest for PA103A, bears to show that a total of 118 items
were checked in. Further, Mr O’Neill spoke of 21 items of online baggage which
arrived on a ﬂight from Berlin and it was suggested therefore that there were additional
items beyond those listed in the documents. Production 199 was not scrutinised in
much detail in the evidence and the discrepancy in numbers was not explored. It can,
however, be seen that 21 of the items on the passenger manifest are marked with the
letters TXL, and in the course of questions with regard to one of those items, directed
to a diﬀerent issue, Monika Diegmuller read those letters as indicating that the item
had come from Tegel Airport, Berlin. It seems likely, therefore, that Mr O’Neill’s 21
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
931
 

items are included in the 118 on the passenger manifest. The remaining discrepancy
might be accounted for as late arrival luggage which, according to some of the evidence,
might not go through the automated system.
[34] There were other comments on the operation of the system to the eﬀect that
there were indications that there might be informal working practices, such as one
coder giving assistance to another which might lead to inaccurate recording. There was
also evidence as to how individual bags which were found in the wrong place were dealt
with, which might have the same result. In this connection, emphasis was placed on the
evidence of Lawrence Whittaker, an FBI special agent who was present when enquiries
were being made at V3, and who observed a person, whom he described as dressed
appropriately for the area, bringing a suitcase to a coding station and coding it in,
but did not see any record being made. Mr Whittaker could not be absolutely certain
that no record was made. Apart from pointing to the possibility of errors in recording,
defence counsel drew attention to the fact that the records showed that a consignment
of interline baggage for PA103A had been taken to the x-ray machine and examined
before loading. If the Crown theory is correct, this consignment should have included
the suspect item from KM180. It was submitted that the x-ray would, in all probability,
have detected any explosive device in a case, particularly as the staﬀ at Frankfurt were
aware of warnings to look out for explosive devices hidden in radio cassette players.
One such warning was issued after the Autumn Leaves operation in October 1988.
Another, more limited, warning was issued because there was understood to be a threat
that a woman from Helsinki would attempt to smuggle a device on board an aircraft.
It was submitted that that examination would have revealed the presence of the radio
cassette player and its contents, particularly in view of the fact that there had been a
warning to look out for explosive devices hidden in radio sets. The x-ray operator,
Kurt Maier, was not ﬁt through illness to give evidence, but reference was made to
statements by him to the investigators from which it appeared that he had x-rayed the
consignment in question. One statement was spoken to by Naomi Saunders, one of the
FAA investigators, the other by Hans Fuhl of the BKA. In both, Mr Maier explained
that he had had some limited training in the use of the machine, but said that in the
course of using it he had taught himself to distinguish various sorts of electrical
equipment, and that he knew how to tell if explosives were present, from their appear-
ance. Neither statement directly dealt with the question whether, and if so how,
Mr Maier would detect explosives hidden in a radio cassette player. What he said was
that the approach in dealing with electrical equipment was to see whether it presented
a normal appearance, for example whether it had a plug. Other evidence, however,
particularly that given by the witness Oliver Koch, Alert’s trainee manager at the time,
shows that the standard of training given to Alert employees was poor. That was
also the view of the FAA investigators who visited Frankfurt in 1989. Mr Maier’s
description of what he looked for does not suggest that he would necessarily have
claimed to be able to detect explosives hidden in a radio cassette player. There was no
expert evidence as to the ease or diﬃculty of detecting such hidden devices. The x-ray
examination is one of the factors to be taken into account but it is only one factor to be
weighed along with the others.
[35] The evidence in regard to what happened at Frankfurt Airport, although of
crucial importance, is only part of the evidence in the case and has to be considered
along with all the other evidence before a conclusion can be reached as to where the
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
932
 
www.ebook3000.com

primary suitcase originated and how it reached PA103. It can, however, be said at this
stage that if the Frankfurt evidence is considered entirely by itself and without refer-
ence to any other evidence, none of the points made by the defence seems to us to cast
doubt on the inference from the documents and other evidence that an unaccompanied
bag from KM180 was transferred to and loaded onto PA103A.
[36] Luqa Airport was relatively small. The evidence did not disclose the exact
number of check-in desks but the photographs in production 871 suggest that there
were not very many. Behind the check-in desks there was a conveyor belt, and behind it
there was a solid wall, separating the check-in area from the airside area. Behind the
check-in desks there were three glass doors, again between the public area and airside,
but these were kept locked. There were other doors between the airside and the open
area, but at Luqa these were guarded by military personnel, who also dealt with secur-
ity at other entrances to the airside area of the airport. The conveyor belt carried items
of baggage along behind the check-in desks and passed through a small hatch into
the airside baggage area. The hatch was also under observation by military personnel
and there were Customs oﬃcers present in the baggage area. The baggage area was
restricted in size. As items of baggage passed along the conveyor belt they were
checked for the presence of explosives by military personnel using a sniﬀer device. The
device could detect the presence of many explosives but would not normally detect
Semtex, although it might detect one of its constituents under certain circumstances.
The only access from the check-in area to the sniﬀer area was through the hatch or
through a separate guarded door.
[37] Air Malta acted as handling agents for all airlines ﬂying out of Luqa. That
meant that the check-in desks for all ﬂights were manned by Air Malta staﬀ. There
were station managers and other staﬀ of other airlines present at the airport. Some
airlines insisted on the use of their own baggage tags, but Air Malta tags could be used
for ﬂights of other airlines, in certain circumstances. Whatever the purpose for which
they were to be used, Air Malta tags were treated as a security item. They were kept in
a store and supplies were issued to the check-in agents when a ﬂight was due to start
check-in. The same applied to interline tags. All remaining tags were returned to the
supervisor after the check-in was completed.
[38] Luqa airport had a relatively elaborate security system. All items of baggage
checked in were entered into the airport computer as well as being noted on the pas-
senger’s ticket. After the baggage had passed the sniﬀer check, it was placed on a
trolley in the baggage area to wait until the ﬂight was ready for loading. When the
ﬂight was ready, the baggage was taken out and loaded, and the head loader was
required to count the items placed on board. The ramp dispatcher, the airport oﬃcial
on the tarmac responsible for the departure of the ﬂight, was in touch by radio-
telephone with the load control oﬃce. The load control had access to the computer and
after the ﬂight was closed would notify the ramp dispatcher of the number of items
checked in. The ramp dispatcher would also be told by the head loader how many
items had been loaded and if there was a discrepancy would take steps to resolve it.
That might require a check of the ticket coupons, a check with one or more check-in
agents or, in the last resort, a physical reconciliation by unloading the baggage and
asking passengers to identify their own luggage. Interline bags would be included in the
total known to load control, as would any rush items. It was suggested by the Crown
that there might at one time have been a practice of allowing the aircraft to leave in
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
933
 

spite of a discrepancy, if the discrepancy was less than ﬁve items, but the records
referred to by the Crown did not bear out that this was a regular practice and the
suggestion was ﬁrmly denied by the Air Malta and airport witnesses. In addition to the
baggage reconciliation procedure, there was a triple count of the number of passengers
boarding a departing ﬂight, that is there was a count of the boarding cards, a count by
immigration oﬃcers of the number of immigration cards handed in, and a head count
by the crew. On the face of it, these arrangements seem to make it extremely dif-
ﬁcult for an unaccompanied and unidentiﬁed bag to be shipped on a ﬂight out of
Luqa. It was suggested that there were occasions, particularly when an LAA ﬂight was
being checked in, when conditions at the check-in desks were crowded and chaotic
because a great deal of miscellaneous and unusual baggage was brought to the desks
and because the queues were not orderly. It was therefore suggested that on such
an occasion a bag might have been slipped onto the conveyor belt behind the desks
without anyone noticing. Again, evidence was led that on occasions airline representa-
tives, such as the second accused, would assist favoured passengers by helping them to
obtain special treatment at the check-in and immigration desks and placing baggage on
the conveyor. Evidence to that eﬀect was given by Dennis Burke and Nicholas Ciarlo
who worked as travel agents at the airport but none of the evidence went further than
suggesting that a case might have been placed on the conveyor belt, from where it
would have gone to the explosives check and the baggage area, but not escaping the
baggage reconciliation system. The evidence of the responsible oﬃcials at the airport,
particularly Wilfred Borg, the Air Malta general manager for ground operations at the
time, was that it was impossible or highly unlikely that a bag could be introduced
undetected at the check-in desks or in the baggage area, or by approaching the loaders,
in view of the restricted areas in which the operations proceeded and the presence of
Air Malta, Customs and military personnel. Mr Borg conceded that it might not be
impossible that a bag could be introduced undetected but said that whether it was
probable was another matter.
[39] As regards the ﬂight itself, the check-in for KM180 opened at 0815 and closed
at 0915. There were two other ﬂight check-ins open during that period or part of it.
Flight KM220 was checking in between 0835 and 0930 and an LAA ﬂight, LN147, was
checking in between 0850 and 0950. The records relating to KM180 on 21 December
1988 show no discrepancy in respect of baggage. The ﬂight log (production 930) shows
that ﬁfty-ﬁve items of baggage were loaded, corresponding to ﬁfty-ﬁve on the load
plan. There was a good deal of evidence led in relation to the number of items noted
on the ticket counterfoils for the ﬂight, and especially in regard to the number of items
checked in by a German television crew who travelled on the ﬂight. It does not seem to
us to be necessary to examine that evidence in detail. A discrepancy might have masked
the presence of an additional item, but the evidence is inconclusive as to whether or
not there was any discrepancy and in any event it is diﬃcult to suppose that a person
launching a bomb into the interline system would rely on such a chance happening. If
therefore the unaccompanied bag was launched from Luqa, the method by which that
was done is not established, and the Crown accepted that they could not point to any
speciﬁc route by which the primary suitcase could have been loaded. Counsel for the
defence pointed out that neither the head loader nor the other members of the loading
crew were called to give evidence, and submitted that, in their absence, the Crown
could not ask the court to draw any inference adverse to them. The absence of any

explanation of the method by which the primary suitcase might have been placed
on board KM180 is a major diﬃculty for the Crown case, and one which has to be
considered along with the rest of the circumstantial evidence in the case.
[40] We turn now to consider what evidence there is to establish any involvement on
the part of either or both of the accused.
[41] In relation to the ﬁrst accused, there are three important witnesses, Abdul
Majid, Edwin Bollier and Tony Gauci.
[42] Abdul Majid in 1984 joined the Jamahariya Security Organisation (‘JSO’),
later named the External Security Organisation. His initial employment was in the
vehicle maintenance department for about eighteen months. In December 1985 he was
appointed as assistant to the station manager of LAA at Luqa airport. This post was
one which was normally ﬁlled by a member of the JSO. He gave evidence about the
organisation of the JSO in 1985. In particular he said that the director of the central
security section was Ezzadin Hinshiri, the head of the operations section was Said
Rashid, the head of special operations in the operations department was Nassr Ashur,
and the head of the airline security section was the ﬁrst accused until January 1987
when he moved to the strategic studies institute. The second accused was the station
manager for LAA at Luqa from 1985 until about October 1988. While Abdul Majid
was only a junior member of the JSO, we are prepared to accept that he was aware of
the hierarchy and that his evidence on these matters can be accepted. In August 1988
he contacted the US embassy in Malta, and indicated a willingness to provide them
with information. His evidence was that he disapproved of Libyan involvement in
terrorism, but the ﬁnal straw was that he had been summoned back to Tripoli in
connection with an incident at the airport involving an Egyptian woman. He said that
at that stage he wanted to go to America, but he agreed to stay in position to give
information to the Americans about terrorist activities. Thereafter he had regular
meetings at about monthly intervals with his CIA handlers. Eventually during 1990 he
returned to Libya when the Americans stopped making payments to him. In July 1991
however he ﬁnally left Libya for Malta from where he was taken on board a US navy
ship. Over a period of about three weeks he was questioned by members of the US
Justice Department and provided certain information to them. Since then he has been
in America on a witness protection scheme. During the period in Malta when he was
having meetings with the CIA, his handlers reported by cable to their headquarters the
information he provided. These cables also dealt with the ﬁnancial arrangements. Such
information as he provided during that period does not appear to have been of much
value, being mainly conﬁned to the comings and goings of various people through
Luqa. We do not ﬁnd it necessary to go into much detail about his dealings with the
CIA in Malta. What emerged from the evidence quite clearly in our view was that
he endeavoured from the outset to give a false impression of his importance within
the JSO in the hope of persuading the CIA that he was a valuable asset who might
in the future be able to provide valuable information. Thus he initially told them that
when he joined the JSO he was in the secret ﬁles section, when in fact he was in vehicle
maintenance; he claimed to be related to King Idris, which he was not; he claimed
long-standing friendship with Ezzadin Hinshiri and Said Rashid, and acquaintance
with Abdullah Senussi, the head of operations administration. We are satisﬁed that
these suggestions were at best grossly exaggerated, at worst simply untrue. It is also in
our view clear that whatever may have been his original reason for defection, his
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
935
 

continued association with the American authorities was largely motivated by ﬁnancial
considerations. In addition to receiving a monthly salary, initially $1000 increasing
to $1500, he also persuaded the CIA to pay for sham surgery to his arm with a view to
preventing the risk that he would have to do military service in Libya, and tried to
persuade them to ﬁnance a car rental business which at one stage he said he wanted
to set up in Malta. Information provided by a paid informer is always open to the
criticism that it may be invented in order to justify payment, and in our view this is a
case where such criticism is more than usually justiﬁed. It is in this context that we turn
to consider particular items in his evidence upon which the Crown sought to found.
[43] At an early meeting with the CIA in October 1988 he was asked if he knew
anything of weapons on Malta. He said that he was aware of eight kilos of explosives
which had been stored for months at the LAA oﬃce. He understood that they had
been introduced some time in 1985 when Abd Al Baset Megrahi was in Malta. They
were not kept in a safe, merely in a locked drawer in the desk. He had been asked to
help in transferring them to the oﬃce of the Libyan Peoples’ Bureau. A further report
shortly thereafter indicated that they were kept in the Valletta oﬃce. In July 1991 he
added the information that the second accused was the custodian of these explosives,
this being the ﬁrst time the second accused was mentioned in connection with this
matter. He further added that it was the second accused who told him that it was the
ﬁrst accused who had brought the explosives. Finally he said that at some stage the ﬁrst
accused told him to ‘look after’ the second accused, and to take control of the explo-
sives when the second accused left his post as station manager. It is quite clear that the
details of this story only emerged some two and a half years after the initial account,
and contained a number of inconsistencies with the ﬁrst account. It is also highly
signiﬁcant that the details only emerged at a stage when it had been made clear to
him that unless he came up with some useful information, he was liable simply to be
returned to Malta. Even taken at its best, the whole story sounds improbable, and in
view of the late introduction of very material detail we are unable to place any reliance
on this account. This was the only matter of any signiﬁcance that was reported to the
CIA by Abdul Majid prior to 21 December 1988. Another matter upon which the
Crown founded was that in July 1991 Abdul Majid told investigators that he had seen
the ﬁrst accused and the second accused arriving at Luqa oﬀ the Tripoli ﬂight some
time between October and December 1988. This comparatively innocuous statement
gradually enlarged until by the time he gave evidence he said that he saw them at the
luggage carousel, that the second accused collected a brown Samsonite type suitcase
which he took through Customs, that then he met the two accused who were accom-
panied by two other people one of whom was introduced to him by the ﬁrst accused
as Abougela Masoud, a technician, that Vincent Vassallo (an associate of the second
accused) was also present having arrived in the second accused’s new car, and that they
then drove oﬀ. As other evidence established that the date of delivery of the second
accused’s car was 14 December 1988, it follows that if Abdul Majid’s story is true this
incident must have occurred on 20 December. He maintained that he had told his CIA
handlers about this incident at the time. The cables for this period disclose no mention
of this incident at all, and the Crown made no attempt to support the proposition that
the incident was mentioned at all prior to July 1991. If it had been mentioned, it would
be quite inexplicable that the CIA would have failed to appreciate the signiﬁcance of
the information and failed to report it. Furthermore, Mr Vassallo in evidence said that
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
936
 
www.ebook3000.com

on 20 December he was not at the airport, and that in fact both accused came to his
house that evening. We are therefore quite unable to accept the veracity of this belated
account by Abdul Majid. A third matter on which the Crown founded was an account
given by Abdul Majid of a conversation in about 1986 with Said Rashid in which the
latter asked if it would be possible to put an unaccompanied bag on board a British
aircraft. Abdul Majid said he would investigate, and asked his assistant Ahmed Salah,
also said to be a JSO oﬃcer, if it could be done. Ahmed Salah later reported that it
could be done, and Abdul Majid wrote a report to Said Rashid to this eﬀect, sending
the report through his superior, the ﬁrst accused. He said that the ﬁrst accused later
visited Malta and this matter was discussed, the ﬁrst accused saying ‘don’t rush things’.
In his evidence he accepted that he had never reported this to the CIA even when they
asked him if he knew anything about the possibility of the bomb which blew up PA103
being sent from Luqa. He said that his reason for not reporting it was for personal
security reasons. Once again, we are quite unable to accept this story when the infor-
mation was supplied so belatedly. Putting the matter shortly, we are unable to accept
Abdul Majid as a credible and reliable witness on any matter except his description of
the organisation of the JSO and the personnel involved there.
[44] The next important issue is that relating to MST–13 timers. The evidence relat-
ing to this came essentially from Edwin Bollier, Erwin Meister, Ulrich Lumpert and
those who supplied the circuit board components of the timers from Thuring AG,
Zurich. MEBO AG was formed in the early 1970s by Edwin Bollier and Erwin Meister.
In 1985 it had its oﬃces in the Novapark Hotel (now the Continental Hotel) in Zurich.
By then it had for some years supplied electrical, electronic and surveillance equip-
ment. At that time, according to Mr Bollier, its principal customer was the Libyan
Government and in particular the Libyan military security, and in connection with
that business he made fairly frequent visits to Libya. Mr Lumpert was employed by
the company as an engineer and in that capacity he was involved in the design and
production of such equipment.
[45] We have assessed carefully the evidence of these three witnesses about the
activities of MEBO, and in particular their evidence relating to the MST–13 timers
which the company made. All three, and notably Mr Bollier, were shown to be
unreliable witnesses. Earlier statements which they made to the police and judicial
authorities were at times in conﬂict with each other, and with the evidence they gave in
court. On some occasions, particularly in the case of Mr Bollier, their evidence was
self-contradictory.
[46] Mr Bollier gave evidence that one Badri Hassan came to MEBO’s oﬃces in
Zurich at the end of November or early in December 1988 and asked the ﬁrm to supply
forty MST–13 timers for the Libyan Army. Mr Bollier checked with Mr Lumpert
whether they had suﬃcient material in stock to make that number of timers.
Mr Lumpert, he said, advised that they had not and so, since timers were urgently
required by the Libyan Army and Mr Bollier bought timers on the open market. He
bought sixteen Olympus timers on 5 December 1988 and the balance of twenty-four
such timers on 15 December 1988. On 16 December 1988 he booked his ﬂight from
Zurich to Tripoli and back. He ﬂew to Tripoli on 18 December 1988, taking the timers
with him. He expected to deliver them to Ezzadin Hinshiri in person on the day of his
arrival. Instead, on that day he was taken to Hinshiri’s oﬃce and left the timers there.
On the following day he saw Ezzadin Hinshiri in his oﬃce about 10.00am. Hinshiri
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
937
 

said that he wanted MST–13 timers and that the Olympus timers were too expensive.
Nevertheless, he retained the timers and directed Mr Bollier to go to the ﬁrst accused’s
oﬃce in the evening in order to get payment for them. From about 6.00pm Mr Bollier
sat outside that oﬃce for two hours. While he did not see the ﬁrst accused, he did see
Nassr Ashur sitting at a meeting. On 20 December 1988 he again saw Ezzadin Hinshiri
who repeated his view that the timers were too expensive, although he wished to keep
them and to pay for them later. Mr Bollier however took the timers back and left
Tripoli later on the same day, ﬂying by direct ﬂight to Zurich rather than via Malta
(as he had expected) where he would have had to spend that night. It was submitted
by the Crown that Mr Bollier’s visit to Tripoli and particularly his visit to the ﬁrst
accused’s oﬃce and the presence there of Nassr Ashur provided additional evidence
in the case against the ﬁrst accused. While we accept that Mr Bollier visited Tripoli
between 18 and 20 December in order to sell timers to the Libyan army, because that is
substantially vouched by documentary evidence and it was not challenged in evidence,
we are not prepared to draw the inference that the Crown sought from this evidence.
On his return to Zurich Mr Bollier claimed to have discovered that one of the timers
had been set for a time and a day of the week which were relevant to the time when
there was an explosion on board PA103. He showed this to Mr Meister who agreed
that he was able to see a time and even a date which were relevant. We do not accept
the evidence of either of these two witnesses about this alleged discovery. It was estab-
lished, and Mr Meister was forced to accept, that the Olympus timer was incapable of
showing a date. Moreover, the evidence of both witnesses about what they claimed to
have seen and the circumstances in which they claimed to have made the discovery was
so inconsistent that we are wholly unable to accept any of it.
[47] Similarly, we reject the evidence of Mr Bollier that outside his Zurich oﬃce on
30 December 1988 he met a mysterious stranger who Mr Bollier thought was a member
of the security services (although of which country he did not specify), who seemed to
know a considerable amount about his recent visit to Tripoli, and who encouraged him
to purchase a typewriter with Spanish keys on which to type a letter to be sent to the
CIA implicating two well known Libyan ﬁgures in the bombing of PA103. (Mr Bollier
did in fact type such a false letter on a Spanish typewriter which he delivered to the US
Embassy in Vienna early in January 1989 on his way to East Germany.) This account
given by Mr Bollier belongs in our view to the realm of ﬁction where it may best be
placed in the genre of the spy thriller. The notion, also, that a rogue company in
Florida was engaged in manufacturing fake MST–13 timers on the instructions of the
CIA, to which Mr Bollier spoke in evidence, falls into the same category.
[48] Despite being examined before a Swiss Magistrate and being interviewed by
police oﬃcers on several occasions before October 1993, it was only then that Mr Bollier
admitted that MEBO had supplied any MST–13 timers to the Stasi (the East German
intelligence service). At that time he said that in the late summer of 1985 he had taken
two prototypes to the Stasi oﬃces in East Berlin where he had delivered them. He
accepted in evidence that he had said in a police interview conducted on 26 January
1994 that he had found in his desk drawer in Zurich in late 1993 an invoice dated
18 September 1985 indicating that seven MST–13 timers had been delivered to the
Stasi in 1985. Recognising that this was a principal invoice and not, as one might
expect, a copy, Mr Bollier sought to account for its presence in the drawer by saying
that it had been put there by ‘the Secret Service’. In any event, he said it was typical
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
938
 
www.ebook3000.com

of the type of false document which he carried with him on his business journeys
in order to get through Customs. This was the ﬁrst time that Mr Bollier mentioned that
a delivery of an additional ﬁve timers had been made to the Stasi. We do not accept
that the invoice which Mr Bollier said he had found was genuine. Indeed, not even
Mr Bollier appeared to have acknowledged it to be genuine.
[49] We do however accept certain parts of Mr Bollier’s evidence despite ﬁnding him
at times an untruthful and at other times an unreliable witness. We have done so when
his evidence has not been challenged and appears to have been accepted, or where it is
supported from some other acceptable source. We accept, for example, that in or about
July 1985 on a visit to Tripoli, Mr Bollier received a request for electronic timers from
Said Rashid or Ezzadin Hinshiri and that he had had military business dealings in
relation to the Libyan Government with Ezzadin Hinshiri since the early 1980s. The
potential order was for a large number of such timers. Mr Lumpert was told of the
requirements by Mr Bollier and proceeded to develop two prototypes. There is a
dispute in the evidence between Mr Bollier and Mr Meister on the one hand and
Mr Lumpert on the other about the colour of the circuit boards in these prototype
timers. Mr Bollier said they were brown, Mr Meister thought they were grey or brown,
whereas Mr Lumpert said that they were manufactured from the green coloured circuit
boards supplied by Thuring. What we do however accept is that later in the summer
of 1985 the two prototypes were delivered by Mr Bollier to the Stasi in East Berlin,
whatever be the colour of their circuit boards. This is consistent with the evidence
of Mr Wenzel who at the material time was a major in the Stasi and with whom
Mr Bollier then dealt. Despite this evidence we cannot, however, exclude absolutely the
possibility that more than two MST–13 timers were supplied by MEBO to the Stasi,
although there is no positive evidence that they were, nor any reasons why they should
have been. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that other MST–13 timers may
have been made by MEBO and supplied to other parties, but there is no positive
evidence that they were. Equally, despite the evidence of Mr Wenzel that after the fall
of the Berlin wall he had destroyed all timers supplied to the Stasi, we are unable to
exclude the possibility that any MST–13 timers in the hands of the Stasi left their
possession, although there is no positive evidence that they did and in particular that
they were supplied to the PFLP-GC.
[50] The initial order placed with Thuring was for twenty circuit boards, solder
masked on one side only, i.e. single sided. In fact Thuring supplied twenty-four such
boards. In October 1985 MEBO placed a further order with Thuring for circuit
boards but it was speciﬁed that they should be solder masked on both sides, i.e.
double sided. Thirty-ﬁve such boards were ordered, but Thuring supplied only
thirty-four.
When the Scottish police visited MEBO’s premises in May 1991, CI Williamson
received from Mr Bollier eleven circuit boards, having been shown twelve. Earlier, on
15 November 1990, following the interview by a Swiss Magistrate of Mr Bollier and
Mr Meister, CI Williamson also took possession of two sample MST–13 timers. It
is clear from this, therefore, that at least twelve of the circuit boards ordered from
Thuring were not used in the manufacture of MST–13 timers. Of the number which
CI Williamson took into his possession, four were single sided circuit boards. Of the
circuit boards in the sample MST–13 timers recovered by CI Williamson, one was
single sided and the other double sided. The MST–13 timer which the US authorities
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
939
 

obtained from the Togo Government in September or October 1986 at Lomé (to which
reference will later be made) also had a double sided circuit board. It follows that some
of the circuit boards of these timers were single sided and some were double sided, and
also that a number of the single sided circuit boards supplied by Thuring in August
1985 were not used. Mr Bollier therefore may well have been correct when he said that
the Libyan order was met with the supply of timers which had circuit boards of both
types. We also accept Mr Bollier’s evidence that he supplied the twenty samples to
Libya in three batches. In 1985 he himself delivered ﬁve on a visit to Tripoli. In the
same year he delivered another ﬁve to the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin. In 1986
he delivered the remaining ten personally in Tripoli.
[51] In September or October 1986 the President of Togo asked the US Government
to send representatives to examine a cache of arms which had been discovered in
that country. Three US government oﬃcials attended at Lomé. Amongst the captured
equipment there were two MEBO MST–13 timers which interested the Americans
because they looked particularly modern and sophisticated compared to the other
items which seemed old and worn. The Americans received permission to take one
of the two timers back in the diplomatic bag to the US. In June 1990 Mr Feraday
attended at the Explosives Unit of the FBI HQ in Washington DC and examined
it there. A preliminary examination by him determined that there were similarities
between the circuit board of the Lomé timer and the fragment PT/35(b). On later
examination he discovered that the Lomé timer had a double sided circuit board,
whereas the fragment PT/35(b) came from a single sided circuit board. Further he
observed that the board did not have the corners cut out, which indicated that it cannot
have been boxed. An attempt had been made to scratch out the letters MEBO on the
surface of a smaller circuit board contained within the timer. Counsel for the ﬁrst
accused drew our attention to the fact that amongst the equipment captured there were
ammunition pouches which were recognised as pouches of East German design. In
fact, there were, in addition, riﬂes and handguns of East German origin amongst the
equipment, but the other items, including detonators, a length of fuse, a detonator box
and ammunition, came from several diﬀerent countries, including Bulgaria, the Soviet
Union, France and West Germany. Counsel also reminded us that Mr Wenzel had
given evidence that it was his practice to remove the MEBO name from products
supplied by Mr Bollier. In these circumstances we cannot exclude the possibility that
the source of at least one of the two MST–13 timers found in Togo was East Germany,
but on any view there were material diﬀerences between these timers and the one used
to trigger the explosion on PA103.
[52] The timer recovered in Togo which, as we have said, was one of two, was con-
sidered by the witness Richard Sherrow to be identical to one which was discovered in
Dakar, Senegal, on 20 February 1988 within a briefcase found on board a passenger
aircraft which had arrived at the airport there from Cotonou in Benin. It was recovered
in October 1999 by CI Williamson from the French Ministry of Justice in Paris but was
not examined forensically. It cannot therefore be said whether its circuit board was
single or double sided. In the briefcase were found also nine metres of fuse, four blocks
of TNT, two blocks of Semtex-H, nine electric detonators, a pistol with a silencer, a
box of bullets, one empty clip and ﬁve discs for the silencer. Three persons were taken
into custody from the aircraft—a Senegalese named Ahmed Khalifa Niasse, Mansour
Omran El Saber who at the time was a member of the Libyan ESO, and one Mohamed
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

www.ebook3000.com

El Marzouk. The evidence did not establish any connection between any of these three
arrested persons and the briefcase and its contents.
[53] Mr Bollier gave evidence that he attended tests carried out by the Libyan military
in the Libyan desert at Sabha which involved, inter alia, the use of MST–13 timers in
connection with explosives and in particular air bombs. He said that the timers were
brought by Nassr Ashur. Mr Bollier attended there as a technical expert. He thought
that this was in 1986 after the last batch of timers had been delivered to the Libyan
Government, but later he qualiﬁed this by saying that it might be in the middle or the
fall of 1987. From the way in which he gave evidence about these tests we are per-
suaded that he did indeed attend such tests, although it is not clear when they were
carried out or what was their purpose.
[54] We also accept Mr Bollier’s evidence, supported by documentation, that MEBO
rented an oﬃce in their Zurich premises some time in 1988 to the ﬁrm ABH in which
the ﬁrst accused and one Badri Hassan were the principals. They explained to Mr Bollier
that they might be interested in taking a share in MEBO or in having business dealings
with MEBO.
[55] The third important witness is Mr Gauci. We have already referred to his evi-
dence in connection with the sale of clothing. Mr Gauci picked out the ﬁrst accused at
an identiﬁcation parade on 13 August 1999, using the words as written in the parade
report ‘Not exactly the man I saw in the shop. Ten years ago I saw him, but the man
who look a little bit like exactly is the number 5’. Number 5 in the parade was the ﬁrst
accused. He also identiﬁed him in Court, saying ‘He is the man on this side. He
resembles him a lot’. These identiﬁcations were criticised inter alia on the ground that
photographs of the accused have featured many times over the years in the media and
accordingly purported identiﬁcations more than ten years after the event are of little if
any value. Before assessing the quality and value of these identiﬁcations it is important
to look at the history.
[56] In his evidence in chief, Mr Gauci said that the date of purchase must have been
about a fortnight before Christmas. He was asked if he could be more speciﬁc under
reference to the street Christmas decorations. Initially he said ‘I wouldn’t know exactly,
but I have never really noticed these things, but I remember, yes, there were Christmas
lights. They were on already. I’m sure. I can’t say exactly’. In a later answer when it
had been put to him that he had earlier said that the sale was before the Christmas
decorations went up, he said ‘I don’t know. I’m not sure what I told them exactly about
this. I believe they were putting up the lights, though, in those times.’ He could not say
what day of the week it was. He was alone in the shop because his brother was at home
watching football on television. When asked about the weather he said ‘When he came
by the ﬁrst time, it wasn’t raining but then it started dripping. Not very—it was not
raining heavily. It was simply dripping . . .’ As we have previously noted, he said the
purchaser was a Libyan. He was wearing a blue suit. When asked about the build
of the purchaser, he said ‘I’m not an expert on these things. I think he was below
six feet. . . . He wasn’t small. He was a normal stature. He had ordered a 16½ shirt’.
When asked about age he said ‘I said before, below six—under sixty. I don’t have
experience on height and age.’ He also said the purchaser had dark coloured skin.
On 13 September he went to the police station where he assisted in the compilation
of a photoﬁt (production 430.1) and an artist’s impression (production 427.1). He
described the result of both as being ‘very close’.

[57] In cross-examination he had put to him a number of statements he had made to
the police. He was ﬁrst interviewed by the police on 1 September 1989. On that date, in
addition to giving the police information about the clothing, he also gave information
about the circumstances of the sale, the date of the sale, and the description of the
purchaser. In the statement noted by DCI Bell on that date, Mr Gauci said that he had
been working alone in the shop between 6.30pm and 7.00pm when the purchaser came
in. The description of the purchaser as given to DCI Bell was that he was six feet or
more in height. He had a big chest and a large head. He was well built but was not fat
or with a big stomach. His hair was very black. He was clean-shaven with no facial hair
and had dark coloured skin. His overall appearance was smart. He bought an umbrella
and put it up when he left the shop because it was raining. Mr Gauci said that he could
not remember the day of the week although he thought it was a weekday. In a further
statement on 13 September he said that the man was about 50 years of age.
[58] On 14 September 1989 Mr Gauci was taken to police headquarters at Floriana,
Malta, where he was interviewed by DCI Bell and Inspector Scicluna of the Maltese
police. They took a statement from him and showed him nineteen photographs on two
cards. Mr Gauci identiﬁed a photograph of a man in one of the cards. He said that he
was similar to the man who had bought the clothing but the man in the photograph he
identiﬁed was too young to be the man who had bought the clothing. If he was older
by about twenty years he would have looked like the man who bought the clothing. He
signed the front of the photograph of the man whom he identiﬁed as similar. He said
in his statement that the photograph looked like the man’s features so far as the eyes,
nose, mouth and shape of face were concerned. The hair of the customer was similar
but shorter than that of the man in the photograph. DCI Bell revealed that the person
whom Mr Gauci had identiﬁed was someone whom the Maltese Security Branch con-
sidered to be similar to the artist and photo-ﬁt impressions which had been composed
as a result of the description given by Mr Gauci. The man was later identiﬁed as one
Mohammed Salem.
[59] On 26 September 1989 Mr Gauci again attended at police headquarters in
Malta where he was interviewed by the same two police oﬃcers. He was then shown
more photographs. He said that he did not see the man to whom he sold the clothing,
but he pointed out one photograph of a man who had the same hairstyle. He said that
this was not the man he sold the clothing to as the man in the photograph was too
young. The person he pointed out, according to the evidence of DCI Bell, was a person
called Shukra whose photograph was included at the suggestion of the BKA, the
German police force, who suggested that Shukra might be similar to the person whom
Mr Gauci had already described.
[60] On 31 August 1990 Mr Gauci gave a further statement to DCI Bell and
Inspector Scicluna at police headquarters at Floriana. He was shown a card containing
twelve photographs. He examined these photographs and said that he could not see the
photograph of the man who had purchased the clothing, and he told DCI Bell that the
man’s photograph was not present. He pointed out one of the photographs of a man
who was similar in the shape of the face and style of hair but it was not, he said, the
photograph of the man whom he had described. He informed DCI Bell that three
other photographs he was shown were photographs of men of the correct age of the
man he had described. DCI Bell then opened another set of photographs, twelve in
number. Mr Gauci examined each of these but could not see the photograph of the

man who had purchased the clothing. DCI Bell gave evidence that in the ﬁrst series
there was included a photograph of a man Marzouk and in the second series a man
named Saber. He could not however say which photographs represented either person.
[61] On 10 September 1990 Mr Gauci again attended at police headquarters. He was
shown thirty-nine photographs on that occasion which were contained in an album. He
however made no identiﬁcation of anyone from these photographs which included a
photograph of Abo Talb. Mr Gauci had been shown on 6 December 1989 a selection
of photographs which included a photograph of Abo Talb, but he made no identiﬁca-
tion of anyone from these photographs. At about the end of 1989 or the beginning of
1990 his brother showed him an article in a newspaper about the Lockerbie disaster. As
he recalled, there were photographs of two people in the article. Across the photograph
of the wreckage of Pan Am 103 there was printed the word ‘Bomber’. In the top right
corner of the article there was a photograph of a man with the word ‘Bomber’ also
across it. Mr Gauci thought that one of the photographs showed the man who had
bought the articles from him. When the Advocate Depute put to Mr Gauci in evidence
at the trial that the man in the photograph looked similar to the man who had bought
the clothes, Mr Gauci replied that it resembled him and he explained that the man’s
face and hair resembled the person who had bought the clothes from him. The person
whom he identiﬁed in that way was Abo Talb. By the time he gave his statement on
10 September 1990 Mr Gauci had been shown many photographs but he said in that
statement that he had never seen a photograph of the man who had bought the
clothing.
[62] On 15 February 1991 Mr Gauci again attended at police headquarters. He was
asked to look at a number of photographs and a card of twelve photographs was put
before him. He said: ‘The ﬁrst impression I had was that all the photographs were of
men younger than the man who bought the clothing. I told Mr Bell this. I was asked to
look at all the photographs carefully and to try and allow for any age diﬀerence. I then
pointed out one of the photographs.’ He said of the photograph of the person he had
pointed out: ‘Number 8 is similar to the man who bought the clothing. The hair is
perhaps a bit long. The eyebrows are the same. The nose is the same. And his chin and
shape of face are the same. The man in the photograph number 8 is in my opinion in
his 30 years. He would perhaps have to look about 10 years or more older, and he
would look like the man who bought the clothes. It’s been a long time now, and I can
only say that this photograph 8 resembles the man who bought the clothing, but it is
younger.’ He went on further to say: ‘I can only say that of all the photographs I have
been shown, this photograph number 8 is the only one really similar to the man who
bought the clothing, if he was a bit older, other than the one my brother showed me.’
He was asked by DCI Bell if what he said was true and that this photograph was the
only one really similar to the man who bought the clothing if he was a bit older, other
than the one his brother had shown him, and he said: ‘Of course. He didn’t have such
long hair, either. His hair wasn’t so large.’ DCI Bell later gave evidence that the person
shown in photograph 8 was the ﬁrst accused, being apparently the same as the photo-
graph in the ﬁrst accused’s 1986 passport. He also said that before showing Mr Gauci
the card of photographs he had all the other photographs dulled down to the same
level of brightness as the ﬁrst accused’s photograph. He said that he did that simply for
fairness because the rest of the photographs were brighter and sharper than that of the
ﬁrst accused and he wanted them all to look the same. Counsel for the ﬁrst accused
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
943
 

submitted that DCI Bell’s attempts to make the quality of all the photographs similar
had failed, but in our view this criticism has no validity.
[63] Finally, so far as police interviews were concerned, Mr Gauci was asked about a
visit he made to Inspector Scicluna towards the end of 1998 or the beginning of 1999
after another shopkeeper showed him a magazine containing an article about the
Lockerbie disaster. Towards the bottom of the page in the article there was a photograph
in the centre of a man wearing glasses. Mr Gauci thought that that man looked like
the man who had bought the clothes from him but his hair was much shorter and he
didn’t wear glasses. He showed the photograph in the article to Inspector Scicluna and,
as Mr Gauci recalled it, he said ‘Well now I said “This chap looks like the man who
bought articles from me.” Something like that I told him.’ He added that the hair of
the man who bought from him was much shorter than that shown in the photograph
and he was without glasses. The photograph was a photograph of the ﬁrst accused.
[64] In cross-examination Mr Gauci was referred to a statement which he had given
to DCI Bell on 14 September 1989. In that statement he said that the purchase of
the clothing was made on a week day when he was alone in the shop. His brother
Paul Gauci did not work in the shop on that particular afternoon because he had gone
home to watch a football match on television. It was agreed by Joint Minute that
whichever football match or matches Paul Gauci had watched would have been broad-
cast by Italian Radio Television either on 23 November 1988 or 7 December 1988.
Mr Gauci had also said in that statement that the purchaser walked out of the shop
with the umbrella which he had purchased and that he had opened up the umbrella as
it was raining. In his evidence he agreed that he had said this because it was raining at
the time. When the man returned, the umbrella was down because it had almost
stopped raining. There were just a few drops coming down. In a later statement he said
that it had almost stopped raining when the man came back and there were just a few
drops still coming down. It wasn’t raining, he said in evidence, it was just drizzling. In a
statement dated 10 September 1990 which was put to him in cross-examination he said
that just before the man left the shop there was a light shower of rain just beginning.
As the man left the shop he opened up the umbrella which he had just purchased.
‘There was very little rain on the ground, no running water, just damp.’ He was also
asked in cross-examination what he meant when he used the word ‘midweek’ and he
responded by saying that he meant a Wednesday. It was put to him that midweek
meant a day which was separate from the weekend, in other words that the shop
would be open the day before and the day after. To that Mr Gauci said ‘That’s it.
Exactly. Tuesday and Thursday.’ But he then went on to say that for him midweek
was Wednesday. It was not put to him that Thursday 8 December 1988 was a public
holiday, it being the feast of the Immaculate Conception on that day. That evidence
was given on Day 76 by Major Mifsud in the course of evidence led for the ﬁrst
accused. We are satisﬁed that when Mr Gauci was asked whether the shop would be
open the day before and the day after he was being asked what he meant by the word
‘midweek’, and not whether the day after the purchase of the clothing was made in his
shop, the shop was open for business.
[65] Major Mifsud was between 1979 and 1988 the Chief Meteorologist at the
Meteorological Oﬃce at Luqa Airport. He was shown the meteorological records kept
by his department for the two periods, 7/8 December 1988 and 23/24 November 1988.
He said that on 7 December 1988 at Luqa there was a trace of rain which fell at 9.00am
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
944
 
www.ebook3000.com

but apart from that no rain was recorded later in the day. Sliema is about ﬁve kilometres
from Luqa. When he was asked whether rain might have fallen at Sliema between
6.00pm. and 7.00pm in the evening of 7 December 1988, he explained that although
there was cloud cover at the time he would say ‘that 90% was no rain’ but there was
however always the possibility that there could be some drops of rain, ‘about 10%
probability, in other places.’ He thought a few drops of rain might have fallen but he
wouldn’t think that the ground would have been made damp. To wet the ground the
rain had to last for quite some time. The position so far as 23 November 1988 was
concerned was diﬀerent. At Luqa there was light intermittent rain on that day from
noon onwards which by 1800 hours GMT had produced 0.6 of a millimetre of rain. He
thought that the situation in the Sliema area would have been very much the same.
[66] Counsel for the ﬁrst accused drew our attention to evidence which Mr Gauci
gave that according to an invoice which he received, dated 25 November 1988, he
purchased eight pairs of pyjamas about that time. Pyjamas sold well in winter and he
used to buy stock ‘when it ﬁnished’. According to a previous invoice dated 31 October
1988 he had at that time bought sixteen pairs. Since the purchaser of the clothing had
bought two pairs of pyjamas and Mr Gauci had renewed his stock around 25 November
1988, counsel asked us to infer that the purchase of the two pairs must have been made
on 23 November 1988. We are unable to draw this inference. In the ﬁrst place it was not
put to Mr Gauci in evidence that this may have been the sequence of events. Secondly,
Mr Gauci was not asked what the state of his stock of pyjamas was on or about
7 December 1988.
[67] In assessing Mr Gauci’s evidence we should ﬁrst deal with a suggestion made in
the submissions for the ﬁrst accused that his demeanour was unsatisfactory – reluctant
to look the cross examiner in the eye, a strange and lonely man, and enjoying the
attention he was getting. We have to say we ﬁnd no substance in any of these criticisms.
We are not clear on what basis it was said that he was strange and lonely, and as far as
enjoying attention is concerned, he made it clear that his cooperation with the investi-
gation was a source of some friction within his family. The clear impression that we
formed was that he was in the ﬁrst place entirely credible, that is to say doing his best
to tell the truth to the best of his recollection, and indeed no suggestion was made to
the contrary. That of course is not an end of the matter, as even the most credible of
witnesses may be unreliable or plainly wrong. We are satisﬁed that on two matters he
was entirely reliable, namely the list of clothing that he sold and the fact that the
purchaser was a Libyan. On the matter of identiﬁcation of the ﬁrst accused, there are
undoubtedly problems. We are satisﬁed with Mr Gauci’s recollection, which he has
maintained throughout, that his brother was watching football on the material date,
and that narrows the ﬁeld to 23 November or 7 December. There is no doubt that the
weather on 23 November would be wholly consistent with a light shower between
6.30pm and 7.00pm. The possibility that there was a brief light shower on 7 December
is not however ruled out by the evidence of Major Mifsud. It is perhaps unfortunate
that Mr Gauci was never asked if he had any recollection of the weather at any other
time on that day, as evidence that this was the ﬁrst rain of the day would have tended
to favour 7 December over 23 November. While Major Mifsud’s evidence was clear
about the position at Luqa, he did not rule out the possibility of a light shower at
Sliema. Mr Gauci’s recollection of the weather was that ‘it started dripping – not
raining heavily’ or that there was a ‘drizzle’, and it only appeared to last for the time
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
945
 

that the purchaser was away from the shop to get a taxi, and the taxi rank was not far
away. The position about the Christmas decorations was unclear, but it would seem
consistent with Mr Gauci’s rather confused recollection that the purchase was about
the time when the decorations would be going up, which in turn would be consistent
with his recollection in evidence that it was about two weeks before Christmas. We
are unimpressed by the suggestion that because Thursday 8 December was a public
holiday, Mr Gauci should have been able to ﬁx the date by reference to that. Even if
there was some validity in that suggestion, it loses any value when it was never put to
him for his comments. Having carefully considered all the factors relating to this
aspect, we have reached the conclusion that the date of purchase was Wednesday
7 December.
[68] Mr Gauci’s initial description to DCI Bell would not in a number of respects ﬁt
the ﬁrst accused. At the identiﬁcation parade the ﬁrst accused’s height was measured at
5’8’’. His age in December 1988 was 36. Mr Gauci said that he did not have experience
of height or age, but even so it has to be accepted that there was a substantial discrep-
ancy. Counsel for the ﬁrst accused also pointed out that when the witness having
pointed to the ﬁrst accused in court, and asked which of the two accused he was
referring to, said ‘Not the dark one, the other one’, and the ﬁrst accused was the other
one. When however he ﬁrst saw a photograph of the ﬁrst accused in a montage of
twelve, he picked him out in the terms we have indicated above.
[69] What did appear to us to be clear was that Mr Gauci applied his mind carefully
to the problem of identiﬁcation whenever he was shown photographs, and did not just
pick someone out at random. Unlike many witnesses who express conﬁdence in their
identiﬁcation when there is little justiﬁcation for it, he was always careful to express any
reservations he had and gave reasons why he thought that there was a resemblance.
There are situations where a careful witness who will not commit himself beyond
saying that there is a close resemblance can be regarded as more reliable and con-
vincing in his identiﬁcation than a witness who maintains that his identiﬁcation is
100% certain. From his general demeanour and his approach to the diﬃcult problem
of identiﬁcation, we formed the view that when he picked out the ﬁrst accused at the
identiﬁcation parade and in Court, he was doing so not just because it was compara-
tively easy to do so but because he genuinely felt that he was correct in picking him
out as having a close resemblance to the purchaser, and we did regard him as a careful
witness who would not commit himself to an absolutely positive identiﬁcation when a
substantial period had elapsed. We accept of course that he never made what could be
described as an absolutely positive identiﬁcation, but having regard to the lapse of time
it would have been surprising if he had been able to do so. We have also not overlooked
the diﬃculties in relation to his description of height and age. We are nevertheless
satisﬁed that his identiﬁcation so far as it went of the ﬁrst accused as the purchaser was
reliable and should be treated as a highly important element in this case. We should
add that we have not made any attempt to compare for ourselves any resemblance
between the ﬁrst accused’s passport photograph and the identikit or artist’s impres-
sion, nor with the ﬁrst accused’s appearance in the video recordings of his interview
with Pierre Salinger in November 1991.
[70] Prior to the start of the trial each accused lodged a Notice, in identical terms,
which was treated as a Special Defence of Incrimination. The persons incriminated in
the Schedule to the Notice were as follows:—
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

‘1. Members of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front which may include Mohamed
Abo Talb, Crown witness no 963, Talal Chabaan, present whereabouts unknown,
Mohammed Ghaloom Khalil Hassan, present whereabouts unknown, Hashem
Salem also known as Hashem Abu Nada present whereabouts unknown, Madieha
Mohamed Abu Faja, present whereabouts unknown, Abd El Salam Arif Abu

42 Triq Patri, Guzi Delia Street, Balzan.
2.
Members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command.
3.
Parviz Taheri, crown witness 996.’
[71] As with all special defences, this Notice does not in any way aﬀect the burden
of proof. That remains on the Crown throughout the trial and it is therefore for
the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime
charged. There is therefore no onus on the Defence to prove that any of the persons
referred to in the Schedule to the Notice were the perpetrators. The sole purpose of
the Notice is, as its name implies, to give notice to the Crown prior to the start of the
trial as to the possible eﬀect of evidence which the Defence might lead in the course
of the trial.
[72] In the event, such evidence was led and in his closing submissions counsel for
the ﬁrst accused made reference to it. In the ﬁrst place, however, it should be recorded
that at the end of his closing submissions counsel said that he was not suggesting that
Parviz Taheri may have been responsible for the crime charged. That was in our view
an inevitable concession given the evidence that we heard. Counsel for the second
accused in his closing submissions did not in fact refer to those mentioned in the
Notice at all, preferring to concentrate on the evidence that the Crown had relied on in
relation to his client. In these circumstances we need say no more about Parviz Taheri.
[73] We turn next to the evidence in relation to members of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (‘PFLP-GC’). No member of that
organisation gave evidence but it was clear from other evidence that we heard, in
particular from oﬃcers of the German police force, the BKA, that a cell of the
PFLP-GC was operating in what was then West Germany at least up until October
1988. The evidence which we accept showed that at least at that time the cell had both
the means and the intention to manufacture bombs which could be used to destroy
civil aircraft. On 26 October 1988, after a period of surveillance, the BKA made a
series of raids and arrested a number of individuals in an operation code-named
Autumn Leaves. In particular they raided premises at Sandweg 28, Frankfurt and
the home of Hashem Abassi in Neuss and they seized a car which had been used
by Haj Hafez Kassem Dalkamoni, apparently the leader of the cell. In these premises
they found radio cassette players, explosives, detonators, timers, barometric pressure
devices, arms, ammunition and other items, including a number of airline timetables
and seven unused Lufthansa luggage tags. From other evidence it appeared that one
of the airline timetables was a PanAm timetable. There was considerable evidence of
bombs being manufactured so as to be concealed in Toshiba radio cassette players. The
models being used were, however, diﬀerent from the RT SF–16 used in the PA103
disaster, and the timers were of a type known as ice-cube timers. These were quite
diﬀerent from MST–13s, much less sophisticated and much less reliable, and the
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
947
 

intention was no doubt to use them in conjunction with the barometric pressure
devices to detonate the explosive.
[74] While all this material was seized by the BKA on 26 October 1988 and the
principal members of the PFLP-GC cell in West Germany were arrested on that date,
the evidence was that most were released shortly thereafter. Dalkamoni, however, was
not, and he was later convicted in relation to bomb attacks on a railway line in
Germany in 1987 and 1988 and possession of the weapons found at Sandweg 28. He
was sentenced to imprisonment for ﬁfteen years. It is possible, of course, that the cell
could have re-grouped and re-stocked with the necessary materials by 21 December.
In April 1989 three further explosive devices were recovered at Hashem Abassi’s new
address in Neuss, but the indications were that these were items which had formed part
of the stock in October 1988. There was no evidence that the cell had the materials
necessary to manufacture an explosive device of the type that destroyed PA103. In
particular there was no evidence that they had an MST–13 timer. For the reasons given
elsewhere, while a small quantity of such timers was supplied by MEBO to the East
German Stasi, there is no evidence at all to suggest that any of them found their way
into the hands of organisations such as the PFLP-GC. On the evidence which we heard
we are satisﬁed that the explosive device which destroyed PA103 was triggered by an
MST–13 timer alone and that neither an ice-cube timer nor any barometric device
played any part in it. It is also to be noted that the cell’s principal bomb-maker was
one Marwan Khreesat who was in fact an agent who inﬁltrated the cell on behalf of
the Jordanian Intelligence Service. His instructions from them were that any bomb
he made must not be primed. Moreover, while he himself did not give evidence, there
was evidence of a statement given by him to FBI agents (production 1851) in which he
said that he never used radio cassette players with twin speakers (such as the Toshiba
RT-SF 16 had) to convert into explosive devices.
[75] There was also a suggestion that the PFLP-GC might have inﬁltrated a bomb
on to PA103A in Frankfurt through the medium of Khaled Jaafar, a 20 year old US/
Lebanese national who boarded PA103A at Frankfurt and then PA103 at Heathrow
with the intention of visiting his father in the USA. He, of course, died in the disaster.
The evidence that we accept was that he had come from Lebanon a few weeks before
and had been staying in Dortmund with a man Hassan El Salheli, who had himself
come to West Germany from Lebanon in 1986 and is now a German citizen. When
Khaled Jaafar arrived he had two holdalls with him containing his clothing, and it was
these two holdalls that he took with him when he left. El Salheli was present when his
bags were packed and they contained nothing but clothing. There was something of
a farewell gathering of Arabs at Dortmund train station to see Khaled Jaafar oﬀ to
Frankfurt on 21 December 1988, but there was no evidence of anything being put in
his bags there or of his leaving with an extra bag. At Frankfurt Airport the passenger
manifest (production 199) bears to record that he checked in two pieces of luggage. In
the queue to pass through passport control he was closely observed by another passen-
ger, Yasmin Siddique (who travelled only to London) and was not seen to be carrying
any luggage. The reason for leading the evidence of this other passenger was that she
observed him, as she thought, to be acting somewhat suspiciously. The suggestion
appeared to be that he was nervous and this might be because he had inﬁltrated some-
thing onto PA103A. We are quite satisﬁed on the evidence, however, that he only had
two bags with him and these were checked into the hold for PA103A at Frankfurt. We
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
948
 
www.ebook3000.com

are also satisﬁed that neither of these two bags contained an explosive device. After
PA103 crashed the two bags were found close by one another. Neither had suﬀered any
explosion damage.
[76] It remains to consider those named in paragraph 1 of the Schedule to the
Notice. Only one of them gave evidence, namely Mohamed Abo Talb. His evidence
was that he was born in Egypt and after a period in the Egyptian army he deserted and
went to Jordan and, a few months later, to Lebanon. He said that while in Jordan, in
about 1972, he joined the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front (‘PPSF’) and worked for
them thereafter in what he described as military operations, and then security and
latterly as bodyguard to the leader of the PPSF. During this period he was mainly
based in Lebanon but moved to Damascus in 1982. In 1983 he left Damascus for
Sweden where he has lived ever since. He said that after arriving in Sweden he did
not belong to any Palestinian organisation and ceased all his activities in relation to
Palestine. However, in 1989 he was convicted of a number of serious oﬀences arising
out of the bombing of targets in Copenhagen and Amsterdam in 1985 and was
sentenced to life imprisonment. He is still serving that sentence.
[77] Abo Talb’s wife, whom he married in 1979, and their children also live in
Sweden, in Uppsala. So do a number of members of her family and other Arabs
with whom Abo Talb associated. In particular, when Abo Talb was arrested in 1989
in connection with the bombings in Copenhagen and Amsterdam (and also one in
Stockholm of which he was acquitted) his wife’s brothers Mahmud and Mustafa Al
Mougrabi were also arrested, as was a friend of Abo Talb’s, Martin Imandi (also
known as Imad Chabaan). There was also some evidence that some of those in Sweden
associated with members of the PFLP-GC cell in West Germany. At that time the
PPSF and the PFLP-GC shared the same political objective, namely the complete
liberation of Palestine involving the destruction of the state of Israel. They both saw
the USA as Israel’s greatest ally. In 1988 Mohamed Al Mougrabi visited Hashem
Abassi in Neuss and met Dalkamoni at a time when bombs were being manufactured
there by Marwan Khreesat. Also there at the same time were two others (a brother
and a cousin of Martin Imandi) who were later smuggled into Sweden by Mohamed
Al Mougrabi. In addition, Ahmed Abassi, who also lived in Uppsala and knew both
Abo Talb and Mohamed Al Mougrabi, was staying with his brother Hashem in Neuss
at the time of the Autumn Leaves raids and was with Dalkamoni and Khreesat on an
expedition to buy electrical components on 26 October when they were arrested by the
BKA. There was also a suggestion that there had been a PFLP-GC cell in Sweden
which had been investigated by the Swedish authorities in 1980, before Abo Talb went
there, and Abo Talb said that a person called Hamid Al Wani, who owned a café in
Uppsala, told him that he was a member of the PFLP-GC. We should also record
that when Abo Talb’s house was searched by police following his arrest in 1989 a
barometric device was found. Abo Talb in his evidence said that that belonged to his
brother-in-law Mahmud Al Mougrabi, who lived in the same house.
[78] Abo Talb gave evidence concerning a number of journeys to various Mediter-
ranean and European countries in the course of the period between the time he was
granted right of residence in Sweden and given a Swedish travel document (1984/5)
and 1988. He went on a number of occasions to Cyprus where he met other Arabs and
relations of his wife. One particular trip was in October 1988. A somewhat strange set
of circumstances led him from there to Malta. He was in Malta from 19 October to
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E

26 October 1988 as in eﬀect the guest of Abd El Salam (who is named in the Schedule
to the Notice), initially staying at his ﬂat and then in a nearby hotel. Abd El Salam was
also known as Abu Nada and his ﬂat in Malta was owned by the Palestine Liberation
Organisation. While in Malta Abo Talb said he spent his time with Abd El Salam at
the bakery business of which he was a director. This was known as the Miska Bakery,
but Abo Talb denied that he knew it by that name and he said that he did not know any
of the persons named in the Schedule to the Notice as former directors of the Miska
Bakery. He did, however, meet Abd El Salam’s brother, Hashem Salem, while he was in
Malta and agreed to take some of his clothing merchandise back to Sweden with him
to see if he could ﬁnd sales outlets for it. That came to nothing and the clothing was
later found by the police in Abo Talb’s home.
[79] When Abo Talb left Malta on 26 October he ﬂew to Sweden on an open return
ticket to Stockholm, valid for one month. He explained that Abd El Salam had bought
the ticket for him and that it had been a return ticket because that was cheaper than a
single. He had no intention of returning to Malta and did not do so. He gave evidence
that on 10 November 1988 he visited the Ministry of Labour in Stockholm in connec-
tion with his application for Swedish nationality, and on 5 December he consulted a
solicitor in connection with the theft of his car, and there was some other evidence
which might support that. On 9 December and 16 December he attended for medical
treatment in Uppsala. These two appointments were agreed in Joint Minute. It was also
agreed in that Joint Minute that shortly after midnight on 22 December 1988 his wife’s
sister gave birth in Uppsala to a child, and Abo Talb said that he was at home looking
after his own children at that time. On this evidence, there is some support for Abo
Talb when he said that he remained in Sweden and did not return to Malta after
26 October 1988. He did accept, however, that during that period he was in contact
with Abd El Salam both by telephone and by post.
[80] As we have said, none of the other persons mentioned in the Schedule to the
Notice gave evidence, but certain facts about them and their activities were agreed in
Joint Minute 11. These, however, do not in our opinion add anything of signiﬁcance.
[81] Having considered the evidence concerning these matters and the submissions
of counsel we accept that there is a great deal of suspicion as to the actings of Abo
Talb and his circle, but there is no evidence to indicate that they had either the means
or the intention to destroy a civil aircraft in December 1988.
[82] From the evidence which we have discussed so far, we are satisﬁed that it has
been proved that the primary suitcase containing the explosive device was dispatched
from Malta, passed through Frankfurt and was loaded onto PA103 at Heathrow. It is,
as we have said, clear that with one exception the clothing in the primary suitcase was
the clothing purchased in Mr Gauci’s shop on 7 December 1988. The purchaser was,
on Mr Gauci’s evidence, a Libyan. The trigger for the explosion was an MST–13 timer
of the single solder mask variety. A substantial quantity of such timers had been
supplied to Libya. We cannot say that it is impossible that the clothing might have been
taken from Malta, united somewhere with a timer from some source other than
Libya and introduced into the airline baggage system at Frankfurt or Heathrow. When,
however, the evidence regarding the clothing, the purchaser and the timer is taken with
the evidence that an unaccompanied bag was taken from KM180 to PA103A, the
inference that that was the primary suitcase becomes, in our view, irresistible. As we
have also said, the absence of an explanation as to how the suitcase was taken into the
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M

system at Luqa is a major diﬃculty for the Crown case but after taking full account of
that diﬃculty, we remain of the view that the primary suitcase began its journey at
Luqa. The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is that the conception,
planning and execution of the plot which led to the planting of the explosive device
was of Libyan origin. While no doubt organisations such as the PFLP-GC and the
PPSF were also engaged in terrorist activities during the same period, we are satisﬁed
that there was no evidence from which we could infer that they were involved in this
particular act of terrorism, and the evidence relating to their activities does not create a
reasonable doubt in our minds about the Libyan origin of this crime.
[83] In that context we turn to consider the evidence which could be regarded as
implicating either or both of the accused, bearing in mind that the evidence against
each of them has to be considered separately, and that before either could be convicted
we would have to be satisﬁed beyond reasonable doubt as to his guilt and that evidence
from a single source would be insuﬃcient.
[84] We deal ﬁrst with the second accused. The principal piece of evidence against
him comes from two entries in his 1988 diary. This was recovered in April 1991 from
the oﬃces of Medtours, a company which had been set up by the second accused
and Mr Vassallo. At the back of the diary there were two pages of numbered notes.
The fourteenth item on one page is translated as ‘Take/collect tags from the airport
(Abdulbaset/Abdussalam)’. The word ‘tags’ was written in English, the remainder in
Arabic. On the diary page for 15 December there was an entry, preceded by an asterisk,
‘Take taggs from Air Malta’, and at the end of that entry in a diﬀerent coloured ink
‘OK’. Again the word ‘taggs’ (sic) was in English. The Crown maintained that the
inference to be drawn from these entries was that the second accused had obtained Air
Malta interline tags for the ﬁrst accused, and that as an airline employee he must have
known that the only purpose for which they would be required was to enable an
unaccompanied bag to be placed on an aircraft. From another entry on 15 December
(translated as ‘Abdel-baset arriving from Zurich’) it appears that the second accused
expected the ﬁrst accused to pass through Malta on that day. In fact the ﬁrst accused
passed through on 17 December and missed seeing the second accused. In his interview
with Mr Salinger in November 1991, the second accused said that he had been
informed by his partner Mr Vassallo that the ﬁrst accused had spoken to him and
asked him to tell the second accused that he wanted to commission him with some-
thing. On 18 December the second accused travelled to Tripoli. He returned on
20 December on the same ﬂight as the ﬁrst accused. The Crown maintained that the
inference to be drawn from this was that on that date the ﬁrst accused was bringing
component parts of the explosive device into Malta, and required the company of the
second accused to carry the suitcase through Customs as the second accused was
well known to the customs oﬃcers who would be unlikely to stop him and search the
case. This would be consistent with the evidence of Abdul Majid. Finally the Crown
maintained that in order for the suitcase to get past the security checks at Luqa on
21 December and ﬁnd its way on board KM180, someone would have to organise this
who was very well acquainted with the security controls at Luqa and would know how
these controls could be circumvented. As someone who had been a station manager
for some years, the second accused was ideally ﬁtted for this role. Further, there was a
telephone call recorded from the Holiday Inn, where the ﬁrst accused was staying, to
the number of the second accused’s ﬂat at 7.11am on 21 December. The Crown argued
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
951
 

that this could be inferred to be a call arranging for the second accused to give the ﬁrst
accused a lift to the airport, and also it could be inferred that the second accused was
at the airport from the fact that the ﬁrst accused received special treatment both at
check-in and at immigration control before departing on the LN147 ﬂight to Tripoli.
[85] There is no doubt that the second accused did make the entries in the diary to
which we have referred. In the context of the explosive device being placed on KM180
at Luqa in a suitcase which must have had attached to it an interline tag to enable it to
pass eventually on to PA103, these entries can easily be seen to have a sinister connota-
tion, particularly in the complete absence of any form of explanation. Counsel for the
second accused argued that even if it be accepted that the second accused did obtain
tags and did supply them to the ﬁrst accused, it would be going too far to infer that
he was necessarily aware that they were to be used for the purpose of blowing up an
aircraft, bearing in mind that the Crown no longer suggest that the second accused was
a member of the Libyan Intelligence Service. Had it been necessary to resolve this
matter, we would have found it a diﬃcult problem. For the reasons we are about to
explain however we do not ﬁnd it necessary to do so. The Crown attach signiﬁcance to
the visit by the second accused to Tripoli on 18 December 1988 and his return two days
later in the company of the ﬁrst accused. As we have indicated, we cannot accept the
evidence of Abdul Majid that he saw the two accused arriving with a suitcase. It
follows that there is no evidence that either of them had any luggage, let alone a brown
Samsonite suitcase. Whatever else may have been the purpose of the second accused
going to Tripoli, it is unlikely that his visit was to hand over tags, as this could easily
have been done in Malta. We do not think it proper to draw the inference that the
second accused went to Tripoli for the purpose, as the Crown suggested, of escorting
the ﬁrst accused through Customs at Luqa. There is no real foundation for this suppos-
ition, and we would regard it as speculation rather than inference. The position on this
aspect therefore is that the purpose of the visit by the second accused to Tripoli is
simply unknown, and while there may be a substantial element of suspicion, it cannot
be elevated beyond the realm of suspicion. The Crown may be well founded in saying
that the second accused would be aware of the security arrangements at Luqa, and
therefore might have been aware of some way in which these arrangements could be
circumvented. The Crown however go further and say that it was the second accused
‘who was in a position to and did render the ﬁnal assistance in terms of introduction
of the bag by whatever means’. There is no evidence in our opinion which can be used
to justify this proposition and therefore at best it must be in the realm of speculation.
Furthermore, there is the formidable objection that there is no evidence at all to sug-
gest that the second accused was even at Luqa airport on 21 December. There were a
number of witnesses who were there that day who knew the second accused well, such
as Abdul Majid and Anna Attard, and they were not even asked about the second
accused’s presence. The Crown suggestion that the brief telephone call to the second
accused’s ﬂat on the morning of 21 December can by a series of inferences lead to the
conclusion that he was at the airport is in our opinion wholly speculative. While there-
fore there may well be a sinister inference to be drawn from the diary entries, we have
come to the conclusion that there is insuﬃcient other acceptable evidence to support or
conﬁrm such an inference, in particular an inference that the second accused was aware
that any assistance he was giving to the ﬁrst accused was in connection with a plan to
destroy an aircraft by the planting of an explosive device. There is therefore in our
I N T E R NAT I O NA L  L AW  D O C U M E N T S  R E L AT I N G  T O  T E R RO R I S M
952
 
www.ebook3000.com

opinion insuﬃcient corroboration for any adverse inference that might be drawn from
the diary entries. In these circumstances the second accused falls to be acquitted.
[86] We now turn to the case against the ﬁrst accused. We should make it clear at
the outset that the entries in the second accused’s diary can form no part of any case
against the ﬁrst accused. The entries fall to be treated as equivalent to a statement
made by a co-accused outwith the presence of the ﬁrst accused. If both accused had
been proved by other evidence to have been acting in concert in the commission of the
crime libelled, then these entries could perhaps have been used as general evidence in
the case as against any person proved to have been acting in concert. As we are of
opinion however that it has not been proved that the second accused was a party to this
crime, it follows that the normal rule must apply and the entries cannot be used against
the ﬁrst accused. We therefore put that matter entirely out of our minds.
[87] On 15 June 1987 the ﬁrst accused was issued with a passport with an expiry
date of 14 June 1991 by the Libyan passport authority at the request of the ESO who
supplied the details to be included. The name on the passport was Ahmed Khalifa
Abdusamad. Such a passport was known as a coded passport. There was no evidence
as to why this passport was issued to him. It was used by the ﬁrst accused on a visit to
Nigeria in August 1987, returning to Tripoli via Zurich and Malta, travelling at least
between Zurich and Tripoli on the same ﬂights as Nassr Ashur who was also travelling
on a coded passport. It was also used during 1987 for visits to Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia
and Cyprus. The only use of this passport in 1988 was for an overnight visit to Malta
on 20/21 December, and it was never used again. On that visit he arrived in Malta
on ﬂight KM231 about 5.30pm. He stayed overnight in the Holiday Inn, Sliema, using
the name Abdusamad. He left on 21 December on ﬂight LN147, scheduled to leave at
10.20am. The ﬁrst accused travelled on his own passport in his own name on a number
of occasions in 1988, particularly to Malta on 7 December where he stayed until
9 December when he departed for Prague, returning to Tripoli via Zurich and Malta
on 16/17 December.
[88] A major factor in the case against the ﬁrst accused is the identiﬁcation evidence
of Mr Gauci. For the reasons we have already given, we accept the reliability of
Mr Gauci on this matter, while recognising that this is not an unequivocal identiﬁca-
tion. From his evidence it could be inferred that the ﬁrst accused was the person who
bought the clothing which surrounded the explosive device. We have already accepted
that the date of purchase of the clothing was 7 December 1988, and on that day the
ﬁrst accused arrived in Malta where he stayed until 9 December. He was staying at
the Holiday Inn, Sliema, which is close to Mary’s House. If he was the purchaser of
this miscellaneous collection of garments, it is not diﬃcult to infer that he must have
been aware of the purpose for which they were being bought. We accept the evidence
that he was a member of the JSO, occupying posts of fairly high rank. One of these
posts was head of airline security, from which it could be inferred that he would be
aware at least in general terms of the nature of security precautions at airports from or
to which LAA operated. He also appears to have been involved in military procure-
ment. He was involved with Mr Bollier, albeit not speciﬁcally in connection with MST
timers, and had along with Badri Hassan formed a company which leased premises
from MEBO and intended to do business with MEBO. In his interview with Mr Salinger
he denied any connection with MEBO, but we do not accept his denial. On 20 December
1988 he entered Malta using his passport in the name of Abdusamad. There is no
T H E  LO C K E R B I E  B O M B I N G  C A S E
953
 

apparent reason for this visit, so far as the evidence discloses. All that was revealed by
acceptable evidence was that the ﬁrst accused and the second accused together paid a
brief visit to the house of Mr Vassallo at some time in the evening, and that the ﬁrst
accused made or attempted to make a phone call to the second accused at 7.11am the
following morning. It is possible to infer that this visit under a false name the night
before the explosive device was planted at Luqa, followed by his departure for Tripoli
the following morning at or about the time the device must have been planted, was a
visit connected with the planting of the device. Had there been any innocent explan-
ation for this visit, obviously this inference could not be drawn. The only explanation
that appeared in the evidence was contained in his interview with Mr Salinger, when he
denied visiting Malta at that time and denied using the name Abdusamad or having
had a passport in that name. Again, we do not accept his denial.
[89] We are aware that in relation to certain aspects of the case there are a number
of uncertainties and qualiﬁcations. We are also aware that there is a danger that by
selecting parts of the evidence which seem to ﬁt together and ignoring parts which
might not ﬁt, it is possible to read into a mass of conﬂicting evidence a pattern or
conclusion which is not really justiﬁed. However, having considered the whole evidence
in the case, including the uncertainties and qualiﬁcations, and the submissions of
counsel, we are satisﬁed that the evidence as to the purchase of clothing in Malta, the
presence of that clothing in the primary suitcase, the transmission of an item of bag-
gage from Malta to London, the identiﬁcation of the ﬁrst accused (albeit not absolute),
his movements under a false name at or around the material time, and the other back-
ground circumstances such as his association with Mr Bollier and with members of the
JSO or Libyan military who purchased MST–13 timers, does ﬁt together to form a real
and convincing pattern. There is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the ﬁrst accused, and accordingly we ﬁnd him guilty
of the remaining charge in the Indictment as amended.
[90] The verdicts returned were by a unanimous decision of the three judges of the
Court.

Conclusion
[368] The Crown case against the appellant was based on circumstantial evidence. This
made it necessary for the trial court to consider all the circumstances founded on by
the Crown. In reaching its decision to convict the appellant the trial court found that
the evidence ﬁtted together to form a real and convincing pattern.
[369] When opening the case for the appellant before this court Mr Taylor stated
that the appeal was not about suﬃciency of evidence: he accepted that there was a
suﬃciency of evidence. He also stated that he was not seeking to found on section
106(3)(b) of the 1995 Act. His position was that the trial court had misdirected itself in
various respects. Accordingly in this appeal we have not required to consider whether
the evidence before the trial court, apart from the evidence which it rejected, was
suﬃcient as a matter of law to entitle it to convict the appellant on the basis set out in
its judgment. We have not had to consider whether the verdict of guilty was one which
no reasonable trial court, properly directing itself, could have returned in the light of
that evidence. As can be seen from this Opinion, the grounds of appeal before us have
been concerned, for the most part, with complaints about the treatment by the trial
court of the material which was before it and the submissions which were made to it by
the defence.
[370] For the reasons which we have given in the course of this Opinion, we have
reached the conclusion that none of the grounds of appeal is well founded. The appeal
will accordingly be refused.

POSTSCRIPT TO CHAPTER 3
ACTION BY THE UNITED
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
1. UN General Assembly Resolution 60/158 (28 February 2006)
Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering
terrorism
The General Assembly,
Reaﬃrming the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
Reaﬃrming also the fundamental importance, including in response to terrorism and
the fear of terrorism, of respecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms and
the rule of law,
Recalling that States are under the obligation to protect all human rights and
fundamental freedoms of all persons,
Acknowledging the important contribution of measures taken at all levels against
terrorism, consistent with international law, in particular international human rights
law and refugee and humanitarian law, to the functioning of democratic institutions
and the maintenance of peace and security and thereby to the full enjoyment of human
rights, as well as the need to continue this ﬁght, including through international
cooperation and the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in this respect,
Deeply deploring the occurrence of violations of human rights and fundamental
freedoms in the context of the ﬁght against terrorism, as well as violations of inter-
national refugee law and international humanitarian law,
Recognizing that the respect for human rights, the respect for democracy and the
respect for the rule of law are interrelated and mutually reinforcing,
Recognizing also that all States must fully respect the non-refoulement obligations
under international refugee and human rights law, while at the same time bearing in
mind relevant exclusion provisions under international refugee law,
Welcoming the various initiatives to strengthen the promotion and protection of
human rights in the context of counter-terrorism adopted by the United Nations and
regional intergovernmental bodies, as well as by States,
Noting the declarations, statements and recommendations of a number of human
rights treaty monitoring bodies and special procedures on the question of the com-
patibility of counter-terrorism measures with human rights obligations,
Recalling its resolutions 57/219 of 18 December 2002, 58/187 of 22 December 2003
and 59/191 of 20 December 2004, Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2003/68
of 25 April 2003, 2004/87 of 21 April 2004 and 2005/80 of 21 April 2005 and other
957
 

relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights,
Recalling also its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993 and, inter alia, the
responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to
promote and protect the eﬀective enjoyment of all human rights,
Reaﬃrming that acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental
freedoms and democracy, threatening territorial integrity, security of States and
destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, and that the international com-
munity should take the necessary steps to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat
terrorism,
Noting the declaration on the issue of combating terrorism contained in the annex to
Security Council resolution 1456 (2003) of 20 January 2003, in particular the statement
that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all
their obligations under international law and should adopt such measures in accord-
ance with international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and
humanitarian law,
Reaﬃrming its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terror-
ism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed,
regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustiﬁable, and renewing its commit-
ment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism,
Stressing that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms recognized in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights without distinction of any kind, including on
the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national

derogating from the provisions of the Covenant must be in accordance with that
article in all cases, and underlines the exceptional and temporary nature of any
such derogations;
4.
Calls upon States to raise awareness about the importance of these obligations
among national authorities involved in combating terrorism;
5.
Urges States to fully respect non-refoulement obligations under international refu-
gee and human rights law and, at the same time, to review, with full respect for these
obligations and other legal safeguards, the validity of a refugee status decision in
an individual case if credible and relevant evidence comes to light that indicates
that the person in question has committed any criminal acts, including terrorist
acts, falling under the exclusion clauses under international refugee law;
6.
Welcomes the establishment by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution
2005/80 of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protec-
tion of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism;

periodically;
10. Welcomes the ongoing dialogue established in the context of the ﬁght against ter-
rorism between the Security Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee and the
relevant bodies for the promotion and protection of human rights, and encourages
the Security Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee to strengthen the links
and to continue to develop cooperation with relevant human rights bodies, in
particular with the Oﬃce of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights, the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while
countering terrorism and other relevant special procedures and mechanisms of the
Commission, giving due regard to the promotion and protection of human rights
in the ongoing work pursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions relating to
terrorism;
11. Stresses that, while developing, as agreed at the 2005 World Summit, a strategy to
promote comprehensive, coordinated and consistent counter-terrorism responses,
full consideration should be given throughout the process to the protection of
human rights and fundamental freedoms and to the provisions of international
humanitarian law and international refugee law;
12. Requests all relevant special procedures and mechanisms of the Commission on
Human Rights, as well as the United Nations human rights treaty bodies, to
cooperate, within their mandates, with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion
